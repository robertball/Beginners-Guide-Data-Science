this was a very good homemade cake recipe.... the only reason i'm giving it 4 stars is b/c the topping didn't turn out the way i thought..it was very oooey gooey and i thought it was supposed to be kinda crispy .... (i baked it exactly as the recipe said, i didn't lower the temp.) SO READ THIS IF YOU ARE MAKING THIS RECIPE.... WHEN YOUR CAKE IS DONE BAKING AND HAS COOLED........IF YOUR TOPPING IS KINDA RUNNY/GOOEY/NOT CRISPY ENUF FOR YOUR LIKING( you can only tell by flipping it out of the pan first) COVER A PAN IN FOIL AND PLACE CAKE ON PAN (topping up) and place cake in oven on BROIL for a few minutes (depending on how crispy you want it) the pineapple will get a little brown also, but it really helped the topping and still tasted delicious!

This cake is absolutely perfect! My only complaint is my family started cutting away at my beautiful creation before I could take a picture to post. I followed the recipe as is. I did add a little, too. After I put the brown sugar mix in I sprinkled coconut on top and then layered the pineapple and added some maraschino cherries to the design. I made two cakes and after they cooled I stacked them. SIMPLY WONDERFUL -  especially the cake's texture and the way the candied sauce just melts into the cake without making it soggy. Someone said they didn't know what stiff but not dry egg whites meant. When you hit that foamy looking stage turn your mixer up and keep going for another minute or so. The egg whites will leave ripples and look shiny.

I had never made a Pineapple Upside Down Cake before this one.  I was a bit worried at first because there are so many steps, but it all turned out great!   

I thought the batter was too runny when it went into the oven, but the cake turned out great anyway and it kept for several days in the fridge.  I had zero problems with this recipe.

I never figured out what "Beat the whites until stiff bu not dry" meant.  The egg whites never got stiff, they did get foamy (kinda like soap foam) but never stiff or dry.  Oh well.

I used canned Dole Pineapple slices, 1 can for the pineapple rings (I used 5 rings) and the 3/4 cup of juice.  Other substitions:  I used margrine instead of butter and I used cheap-o vanilla flavoring rather than vanilla extract.

This recipe rocks, a perfect Pineapple Upside Down Cake!

This cake is very moist and has an excellent presentation. I just happened to have fresh pineapple in the house, but no actual juice, so I substituted orange juice, it was wonderful.

This cake turned out wonderful. For those of you who had a dense cake, you did not beat the egg whites to medium-stiff to stiff peaks, or did not fold in the egg whites into the egg yolk and flour mixture properly. The way the egg whites are whipped and folded into the batter is the key to the cake's fluffy texture. The cake part is supposed to be the  texture of a chiffon cake, something quite light and fluffy. (As this pineapple cake contains the separate foaming method.) Also, you have to get the egg yolks to a creamy or "lemony color" consistency as well.   Pineapple upside down cakes are not supposed to be dense bricks everyone! Fluffy is the key to happiness!

wonderfully light cake! this is a chiffon style cake - so be sure you whip those egg whites til they are the first stage of "stiff peaks" and are still glossy. With my KitchenAid it took about 10 minutes on speed 8. If you have a handheld mixer...it'll be about twice that. If you are using a whisk...heaven help ya, it ain't gonna happen easily.  When folding in --- take 1/3 of the white and mix into the batter, no need to be gentle. It lightens the batter. Then dump in the rest and fold in gently til all incorporated.  Note: you need a deep pan else don't put in all the batter!  Also - put some foil around the bottom curled up to catch brown sugar dribbles :)  YUM!

I made this recipe exactly as it said and it was very good! No problems with too runny of a topping, as indicated by other reviewers.  Pineapple Upside-Down Cake is supposed to be more dense, as opposed to light and fluffy, and this recipe delivers. The cake remains moist despite the density, just make sure you don't overcook it.

Excellent cake!  It came out moist, spongy, and heavy.  This cake was very filling and the flavor is very unique-- I felt that it tasted similar to cheese cake with a pineapple zest but with a pound cake texture.  Sounds weird, but the cake turned out excellent!

This is my second attempt at p-u-d-cake and much better than the first attempt.  I used a 9" glass pie plate and reduced the cook time by 5 minutes. A dense cake, but I think it's supposed to be, rather than light and fluffy.  The crunchy gooey edges were the best.  I will use this recipe if I need p-u-d cake again.

Made for Father's Day. Very moist, a hit with everyone. Used canned pineapple instead of fresh, didn't take away from taste.
As others have said, put cookie sheet underneath to catch drippings.

This tasted good and it looked great. But the directions of the order in which to do each step are wrong. If I made this again I'd make the topping closer to the end. By the time I poured the batter into the topping the butter got cold and hard. Also I'd make the egg whites last, I followed the steps and by the time I was supposed to put them in they weren't as whipped as they were.

This recipe turned out great!!  I used fresh pineapple and didn't have pineapple juice on-hand, so I pureed a few pieces of pineapple in a food processer with O.J. and used it instead.  I also added a few maraschino cherries in the center of the pineapple slices for a little pizzazz and color.  My only suggestion is when you place the cake pan in the oven, set a piece of aluminum foil under the pan to catch any brown sugar 'glaze' that might run over.  My family loved this dessert and I will definitely be making it again!

Had a good flavor, but the cake came out dry. I am not sure what I did, as I followed the recipe precisely. However, maybe I whisked the egg whites too long because it was rather foamy? The cake could use a teaspoon of pineapple extract to up the flavor.

Excellent finished product!!  I bake a lot, and always from scratch, but this was my first attempt at pineapple upside down cake.  I followed the recipe exactly except I used a can of crushed pineapple, drained, instead of the fresh pineapple and juice.  I LOVED the pineapple on top after the cake was finished.  I baked it in a 9 or 10" iron skillet, and ended up with a great firm top and had no problem with runny pineapple glaze.  I would do it the same next time, but I think I may add a little cinnamon to the dry ingredients.  I gave it 5 stars because it really is a great cake, but I almost gave 4, just because I'm not fond of multiple step recipes.  With 3 kids all wanting to help, it was easy to get lost in all the steps.  This cake certainly satisfied my 2nd trimester cravings for pineapple upside down cake!

A total flop! My first time making such a cake but assumed it was ok based on the reviews. Where to start with what is wrong with this recipe? First off, I followed the recipe exactly but the batter was much too dry before folding in the egg whites. So I added a small amount of milk and that made it a little easier to ultimately pour. Then I baked for 30 minutes, which caused the top to look very brown. Thank goodness I put the pan on a cookie sheet, which during baking filled with tons of melted sugar oozing from the pan. When I attempted to flip it over after cooling the whole thing exploded and uncooked batter dripped everywhere. At this point I was about to give up but hated to waste an entire pineapple. So I scooped the contents back into the pan and baked it on 350F for another 50 minutes. Amazingly, there was still partially cooked batter clinging to the pineapple top. I removed most of this and then put the whole mess under the broiler for a minute or so, as per the recommendations of another reviewer. least had some flavor. I served it more like a pineapple brown betty, i.e. in chunks, with ice cream. Next time I am going back to Fannie Farmer!

Solid recipe!   Easy! Well thought out. Do NOT dry out the pineapple in paper towels. The juice will combine with the syrup to make a beautiful top when plating. You might consider dropping blueberries or blackberries if you have them, just to mix things up.   Caveate: Do not walk away from your stand mixer when creating the dough. Too much mixing will make the glutens combine and make the dough chewy and bread-like and not cake-like; the way we want it.

sooooooo good! I made this yesterday with my boys. I was a bit worried because of the ratings, but I noticed that most people who rated it badly, were the ones who tinkered with it! I followed the recipe exactly, except that due to my lazyness, I did not mix the dry ingredients separately, I just added them to the egg yolk mixture, and mixed the dry ing. alone for a bit on the surface, then blended into the egg. This recipe does take some work, but well worth it. I think that adding the last egg yolk would not have been a problem. I will add it in next time, I hate having leftover half eggs! I also baked in a 8X8 in. pyrex pan, because I did not have the 9X9. I used canned generic pineapple, and they worked perfectly. I followed some reviewers advice and placed the cake on a larger pan to catch any drippings, and I lined with aluminum foil for easy cleanup. I stored it at room temp covered, and was sooo delish the next day! I just noticed that one piece in the middle was not thouroughly cooked, so I would advise to check the center before removing completely from oven. My husband and kids looooved it, and almost finished the whole thing in one sitting!

Delicious! This recipe is perfect as is. The first time I made it I followed the recipe exactly but took other reviewers suggestions and baked it at 375 for the recommended time. The cake rose beautifully but unfortunately the top didn't crisp up at all. However, it was still great. Made it again last night, baked at 400 and it turned out perfect! The topping was nice and crispy and the cake part was still moist and fluffier than I would've expected. I loved how much juice went into the batter because you can still taste it when it's baked up. I cheated and used canned pineapple rings and juice this time and didn't notice a big difference. I wasn't sure how long to beat the egg whites so I stopped when they got a little stiff but were very foamy. Definitely made the cake lighter and moister. Be very careful when turning this onto a plate! I ended up spilling hot butter and brown sugar all over the place because my plate wasn't tight enough to the pan. I would also recommend using a square cake pan just because it's easier to serve. Thanks for this recipe, it's a keeper :)

I used unsweetened canned pineapple rings and the juice from them. My husband had two pieces and my daughters liked it. It is heavy and dense as the other reviewers said, but I guess it's supposed to be like that. I'm not a cake person, and it was too sweet and heavy for me. With my family of 5 it didn't go to waste. Make sure and put a cookie sheet under the pan so it won't run over in the bottom of your oven. I was glad I did. There was some drippage.

The flavor of this cake was superb!! I have made a few pineapple upside down cakes in the past, it's one of my daughters' favorites and she has requested it on several occasions. I tried this one for her birthday cake this evening and it was a huge hit. I won't look for another recipe, this is it. Hands down the best I've ever tried. I didn't change anything at all except I doubled the recipe, baked in a 9x13 glass dish at 375 for about 45 mins. It was perfect. Oh, and I added some marachino cherries for color, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.

Very good!   I think it's the 3 eggs that makes it so moist.   Only thing I added was cherries, because hey..  you've gotta have cherries on the top!  ;o)    Thanks for the recipe!

The only thing I did differently was I made 2 cakes out of this recipe. I'm not much of a baker, but this recipe was so simple. I might have over whisked my egg whites(wasn't sure about the stiff or dry), but it was fine. I was so happy about the way my cake turned out that I had to post my pic on here. I will be making this one again :)

This was my first time making p-u-d cake so I was alittle apprehensive to try. I messed up on the batter bc I didn't pay attn to saving some of the butter n pineapple juice. After redoing the batter it turned out to be a delicious cake. Will definitely make again.

This turned out very good.  My husband's favorite cake is Pineapple upside down and he gave it two thumbs up.  Update: last time I made it the batter was too thick and it came out dry so be sure to add more pineapple juice as needed so the batter pours better into the cake pan.  I also add cherries to the design with the pineapple.

This is a really lovely cake.  I added a handful of dried cherries to the topping but other than that made no changes.  I was concerned it would be heavy and dense because the batter was very thick before folding in the egg whites but it rose up nicely.  Unfortunately, I can't really taste the pineapple juice in the cake.  Next time I may simmer a larger amt of juice to reduce and use that for a more intense flavor.  I baked at 350 and it took about 38 minutes in my convection oven, with no excessive browning and no undone center.

This was a total disaster, although partly my own fault.
I unfortunately used a springform pan  - don't try it!  When the sugar topping began boiling, it forced its way out the seams and ended up all over the bottom of my oven.  Probably because of this, the fresh pineapple didn't soften or thicken enough, so was sort of raw and runny on top of the cake.  The cake was ok at first, but the pineapple juices dissolved it to back to batter overnight.  I had to throw it away.  Needless to say, I had to clean my oven and I won't attempt this recipe again.

The recipe was.an easy recipe to make. However the family said the top of the cake was very good but the bottom was very dry. Next time I will add pineapple pieces to the batter and see if that helps.

Wow what a cake. First time making a pineapple upside down cake.  Substitutions:  Used fresh pineapple, but a few slices werent as ripe as i'd like so I carmelized them a bit. I had no pineapple juice so I used 1 C apple juice and sauteed the carmelized  pineapple in the apple juice for a little while until it reduced to 3/4c as per recipe. I also added 1tsp cinnamon to the brown sugar mixture. Unfortunately for me, my daughter didnt have a 9in pan other than a spring pan so I lost juice out the bottom. I made a reduction when the cake was out of the oven and threw it under the broiler for a few.  The cake itself was a lovely texture, beautiful in color, and light in taste. A perfect cake.

Followed directions for toppings exactly (i.e., brown sugar, butter, pineapple juice, pineapple rings & maraschino cherries) but used boxed cake mix for the cake. Used Duncan Hines Golden Butter Cake Mix and used juice from pineapple rings in lieu of water, then added 1/2 tsp of Almond Extract. Cake was delicious and very moist. Will definitely make this recipe again, but will make the cake from scratch next time.

I have made this twice now - once with fresh pineapple (using the juice from a canned pineapple) and once with canned pineapple.  Both times it turned out DELICIOUS!  I've not made pineapple upside down cake from scratch before so it may be that there are better recipes out there.  All I can say though is that I have made this one and loved it :)

maybe my pineapple was juicier than normal but the cooking time was way off on this.  Came out uncooked in the middle even after 20 extra min in oven.Also pan was full to the spilling point.

I did not care for this recipe.  I followed it exactly and it turned out a soggy mess.  There is way too much liquid for the amount of flour and there is no way you can fit a whole sliced pineapple unless the slices are thicker than the cake.  I managed to get 2 edible servings by cutting the outer edges.  The middle  was so wet it totally colapsed.

Though it turned out gorgeous, this was not my ideal type of PUDC. As another reviewer commented, the cake had the consistency of a biscuit and mine was not very sweet.

My first time making pineapple upside down cake. Wonderful recipe! Followed the instructions exactly (but pineapple was cut into chunks, not rings) and made no substitutions. Oh, I included all 3 egg yolks b/c hate to waste anything. Turned out beautifully. Wish I'd had some ice cream to go with it!!

My husband said it's the best cake I ever made!! I made exactly as directed. I bought a fresh pineapple (the already cored fresh pineapple) assuming there would be enough pineapple juice but there was only about 1/4 cup. I used canned pineapple juice to make up the difference. Baked about 28 minutes.

I used this recipe to whip up a quick dessert.  The only alteration I made was using canned pineapple as I didn't have a fresh one to hand.  I used a 20 oz can of pineapple rings and it worked out great. Everyone loved the cake.  Next time I will give it a try with fresh pineapple.

Absolutely delicious cake made as is.  I only baked it for 25 minutes and it was done.  I always test cake, cookies etc before the stated time because the recipe is just a guideline and every oven is different.  I have made this with both fresh and canned pineapple and both are hits.

Loved it! I am not a baker and I have not made many cakes from scratch but this recipe was easy and turned out well.   The only issue I had is that the top was wet and runny, but I think that is because I used a silicone baking pan. It probably needs the heat from a metal pan to get crisp. Don't use silicone.   The cake itself was sweet and light and moist and perfect.

This recipe was awesome!  I doubled the recipe so that it would fit a 9x13 pan and cooked it at 375 for 43 min. as another reviewer did.  Besides that I changed nothing and it was great. I'm keeping this one!

This turned out fabulously! The pineapple/butter/brown sugar topping tasted so incredibly delicious - like a tropical caramel sauce! - and fit perfectly with the moist, delicately dense and rich cake. Actually, it is the cake part that really won me over. It has such a great texture and taste and because it's not too sweet it allows for a ton of different topping possibilities when you're in the mood for something other than pineapple. Actually, I made this twice in the last 4 days and the second time I made it I used sliced peaches in place of the pineapple rings, but still used the pineapple juice in the cake batter; that really adds a subtle element to the flavor that mustn't be left out! The peach-variation turned out tasting just like marmalade and was totally outstanding, too! My husband's birthday is in a week and I plan on using this cake base to whip something up with... hmmm, filled with raspberries and cream sounds like it would be nice! ** Overall, this is a great recipe for PUDC, and the cake base is just a perfect rendering of an out of this world pound cake, so either way it's a winner! I followed it to a "T" the first time and it turned out spectacular. Give it a try!!!

This recipe is not right.  I ended up with burnt edges and gooey center.  I made this 3 times, and even lowered the temp.  The only thing that worked for me was splitting the cake between two pans and lowering temp to 375.  Obviously it cooked much faster than the recipe calls for.  I do have to say that the parts of the cake that weren't gooey or burnt tasted really good.  I'm sure with some more tweaking, this could be a great recipe.

I made this cake today, but it came out gooy. The cake was undone, just as raw as when I poured it into the pan. The brown sugar mixture ran over and started a fire in the oven. I  have been baking and cooking for over 50 years, first time this has happened to me.  I did use can pineapple packed in 100% pineapple juice from
Del Monte.  I thought this would be okay, apparently not. The kitchen note said to be sure to use canned juice. Does that mean canned juice from the juice isle and not the juice from the canned pineapple?  Very disappointed. I won't be making this again, going back to my mom's recipe, that one never fails.

Have made it twice, now. The first time I followed the recipe exactly and the center was totally uncooked even though the outside was very dark, on the edge of burned. The second time I reduced the heat to 350 and baked for 45 minutes. Golden brown, just done in the center and had absorbed the brown sugar mixture almost totally. I really don't see the need to separate the eggs or omit the third yolk, though. This is supposed to be a dense, sweet cake, not angel food, so why go to the extra trouble? I think next time I'll try just creaming the sugar with the butter and mixing the whole eggs in. Very moist cake with good balance of flavors, though.

Just finished this recipe.  It is delicious.  I did tweak it a bit..I melted 1/4 cup butter in a oven proof skillet then added to the skillet 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1tbs pineapple juice and added 1tbs rum. Cook until just bubbly remove from heat add pineapple on top. I made the cake as directed except added 1tsp rum in place of the vanilla  Pour cake mixture over the pineapple and cook as directed.  Mine cooked in about 20 minutes.  I used a non stick skillet.  I will definitely make this again.

Seriously delicious.  Wasn't heavy or dense at all.  Take the time to mix those egg whites properly, and don't over mix the batter.

the next time I make this, I need to use a longer pan and a shallower level of batter, it was sadly over dry.

I used this recipe, as this is my mom's favorite dessert, for her birthday a year ago. She has apparently decided that her birthday is every week, because she requests this cake constantly! Super easy to make, turns out wonderfully.

This cake is awesome!  I used canned pineapple and followed the directions except I reduced the white sugar to 1/4 cup because the pineapples were sweetened.  It looks great and tastes great!  I will definitely be making this over and over again, thank you!

Not a fan of pineapple but I like this cake very much.  I sub the white flour for wheat flour and double the amount of vanilla.  The wheat flour gives the cake more texture and structure.

This recipe is fabulouse. The cake is sort-of light but thick at thd same time. The baking soda adds a nice pop that accents the pineapple and syrup wonderfully. Fresh pineapple really makes this recipe. The cake was very popular when made for friends.

This cake is absolutely amazing.  Made exactly as written except used canned pineapple and maraschino cherries.  The cake itself was SO delicious and moist that my daughter said she wants one for her birthday without the pineapple on top (but with the pineapple juice as written.  I will use this recipe again and again!

I was skeptical when it came time to separate the eggs, beating the whites and omitting a yolk, but I did it anyway. I wish I had followed my instinct, as the cake turned out with an odd, unappealing texture. If I were to use this recipe as a guide in the future, I would cream the butter with the sugar, and simply add all 3 eggs to the mix. Very disappointing cake resulting from an unnecessary step. Bummer!

I used canned pineapple but otherwise followed the recipe and it was absolutely the most delicious cake I've had! Moist, flavorful and the crispy edges are great. My husband *had* to have a second piece. Will make again. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

This was excellent.  I had a pineapple sitting on my windowsill.  Looked up and it was ripe...EEK!  They don't last so long.  Wanted something new to try and this was it.  My husband really loved it and it tasted darn good to me as well.

My fiance loves pineapple, but I found out that he had never had pineapple upside-down cake!  I had to make it for him.  After looking at a few recipes I decided to give this one a try.  I'm glad I did!  All I had were canned pineapples on hand, but it still turned out dense, moist and absolutely delicious.  When my fiance tasted it he said.... well... what he said was inappropriate, so I'll just say he loved it.

I just made this recipe and it turned out fantastic!  I did make the mistake of using a springform pan and thus lost a lot of the sugar mixture off the 'top" of the cake to the bottom of my oven, but it turned out sweet and delicious and cakey.  I didn't have any pineapple juice along with my fresh fruit, so i used some mango juice mixed with lemon juice and it went along perfectly.

So very good.  The trick is to really get the egg whites right.  I did not the first time I made it and the cake turned out a little dense, although it tasted great.  The second time I made it, I really concentrated on getting the egg whites until they were stiff, and a little shiny.  The cake turned out great!  I will definitely make this one again.

So delicious! I made this with very thick slices of sweet, ripe pineapple, & using only whole wheat flour. Half a recipe fits in a 9"x5" loaf pan, & bakes in 27 mins.

glaze too runny...  separating egg white was unnecessary and changed the texture of this traditionally dense cake into something less palatable.  There are much better recipes than this one.

One of the most delicious cakes I've ever had! The first time I made this I found it to be a little more dense than I wanted so the 2nd time I made it I separated the eggs & beat the whites to a nice firm froth before adding them in with the other ingredients. The cake came out PERFECT!

Great recipe! My mother gave it an A+, and she doesn't just hand those out!  I made the butter/brown sugar sauce in a cast iron skillet, added the fresh pineapple, and poured the batter right over the top and stuck it in the oven.  It came out perfect!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Will definitely make again. Used fresh pineapple, 9x9 pan.  Added extra 1/4cup of pineapple juice to batter. Whipped eggs just like supposed to. Used cake flour. Used 1/4 cup of organic sugar. Used all 3 egg yolks in the batter. Added 1/2t cinnamon. Everyone loved. Used a pan under the cakepan but didnt even come close to running over. Cooked for 43min total.

Very good!!!  I had some left over canned pineapple, so I thought I would try this recipe, and I was pleasantly surprised!  I am not even a fan of pineapple, but I gobbled this up.

This cake is very moist with a nice texture and flavor.  The only reason I am giving it four stars is because after taking it from the oven it sunk in the middle and I had to put it back in for about 10 more minutes.  It then came out nicely browned and still very moist.  I will make this again.

Needed something in a pinch this was a good basic recipe and it baked beautifully. I didn't have any fresh so I used canned pineapple rings.

I made this and was disappointed.  Pineaple Upside Down Cake, but I thought this was too heavy and a little dry.  The flavor was decent, but I wasn't impressed.  I think it's about a 3 star recipe, but...I'm giving it 4 stars because someone contacted me after trying it and said it was the best one they'd ever had!  So maybe it was just my personal taste if others thought it was that good.

This cake turned out exactly as I'd wanted it to...Light, moist tasting and not too too sweet.  I substituted canned for fresh pineapple and ran out of butter so threw in some margarine to make the full 3/4 of a cup required.  Also added a bit more pineapple juice because the batter didn't seem wet enough (used about a cup in total).  None of this mattered though.  I made it for a birthday party and everyone there raved over it.  This is a simple, easy, classic cake that brings me back to my childhood.  Will definitely make again.

My cake came out undone in the center as well...I made this EXACTLY like the recipe.  I'm making two for a party, so I baked the first one JUST to see...so I'll make a second one and follow another reviewer's suggestion of more brown suger, less pineapple juice...and baked longer...then we'll see if it works.  Looks beautiful and I'm SURE it'll get eaten!  Once I've tasted and baked the other, I'll review again!

Like another reviewer, my cake came out cooked on the edged, raw in the middle. I cooked using gas, glass 9X9, at 400 degrees. After flipping had to place back in oven and bake an additional 15 minutes. THEN it was a tasty treat. Have to admit, this is a new oven for me and I'm a beginner baker. Also, used canned pineapples and were just fine. Also placed cherries in the middle-very pretty.

This cake was pretty good.My only gripe would be the watery topping. I would absolutely reduce the pineapple juice in the topping to 2 tbsps. Otherwise, great flavour and texture.A keeper!

So wonderful! I used canned pineapple, margarine instead of butter, light brown sugar instead of dark, and I used a large silicone star-shaped pan instead of the round cake pan (to test the star pan out!). I sprayed the pan with non-stick spray instead of using the melted butter. It turned out really tasty and so pretty! There was a little bit of overflow of the sugar mixture, but I had the pan on a cookie sheet, and I quickly put some foil down to catch any extra drips. Next time, I might add a little chopped pineapple to the batter, I think it would add to the pineapple flavor nicely. Thanks, Veruschka! :)

I did not have Pineapple jucie so I used milk instead in the batter. 

MAJOR FAIL!!!  dont use milk and maybe I beat the egg white too much not sure cake was very dry and not flavorful at all middle did not get done either, so I cut it out and made it look like I did it in a bunt pan. It looked good but not good. I will try again : )

I was in a hurry when I made this cake and didn't follow the egg white/egg yolk directions as written (I beat the yolks into the whites). But it turned out OK in the end. I baked it in a 10" nonstick pan and didn't have a problem with dripping in the oven. Also, it came out of the pan beautifully. It was a bit juicy on top when done, but we just ran it through the broiler for a few minutes and it was DEVOURED by all!!!

This is a fantastic scratch recipe.  It's not nearly as hard as it looks.  The only changes I made were to use canned pineapple and add maraschino cherries for color.  It was a hit for Easter. My mom was inspired to try the recipe and it came out great for her too.  All you have to remember is that you'll need 4 bowls, a saucepan and your cake pan.  Everything (except the topping) gets added into the dry ingredients bowl.

I made this cake using a 9 inch rounc cake pan as specified - the cake over ran the edge of the pan.  Next time I will use a 10 round pan. Cake was very good otherwise.

It's not a difficult recipe to make, but if you're going to attempt the "chiffon" texture, then it will be.  I did not want to break out my stand mixer, and attempted it by hand.  I read that a little bit of salt for the first few minutes and then a little bit of vinegar the last few minutes in addition with a touch of sugar to the egg whites to stabilize the peaks would work for a hand mixer.  I was using a wisk...haha, so there was no way it would've worked.  I got it to the frothing stage where the egg whites held their shape somewhat, but that was pointless, b/c as soon as they were incorporated, all the bubbles burst.   Technically, the egg peaks should be able to hold the weight of an egg.  If you're not going to take out at least the hand mixer, just know your going to enjoy one great dense cake.  My favorite part is definitely the cake portion.  It's definitely sweet, so you'll definitely like it if that's your thing.

It was very good !
I used the whole pineapple as directed, there was a lot, so I decided to put in a 9x13 Pyrex. I think if I had used a cake pan, the pineapples would stack too many layers, wouldn't look pretty like the photo shown. Even in 9x13 pan, I stacked pineapples 2 layers. When I made the batter it was not enough to spread completely to cover the whole thing ( I even used all 3 eggs, what's the point of leaving one yolk out ?) so I spread it very thin, not covering every inch.
I would have to say, after it baked, the dough did raise a little so it looked fine...But, I did not dare to turn the pan upside down, we just cut out of the pan, and it was certainly delicious, definitely more pineapples then cake. We didn't mind that. The pineapples left juice at the bottom which was really good...note :It was not thicker and caramelized like I had imagined though. The 'cake' part was more like a firm crust, which was good.
Overall it was very good and refreshing, not dense and heavy.

I'd never made pineapple upside down cake before so I had no idea what to expect. I used canned pineapple with the juice from it, and it was absolutely delicious. The cake was nice and moist, and I will definitely be making it again. I thought separating the eggs to beat separately would be a hassle, but the whole process was not time consuming at all.

This was amazing! I used tinned pineapples cause that's all I had at home so I reduced the sugar a bit, it was really tasty. The caramel base with the pineapple and the butter cake was so so good. It got over very soon :)

I don't mind going through a little extra trouble for a great dessert bit this was so not worth the effort. The end product was a small, dense cake with the texture almost of a biscuit. The separation and subsequent beating of egg white and yolk was a lot of effort for a mediocre cake. The flavor was good however but with the multi-step process and the amount of butter and sugar in this cake I was expecting something a bit more special.

excellent!  the taste was very, very good but there are a few things that need some tweaking.  first, i agree with another reviewer that the egg whites should be beaten right before adding them in.  also, once i inverted the cake i noticed that the topping was quite soupy so i followed another reviewer's recommendation to broil the top a bit to firm things up.  otherwise this is an excellent recipe and it's going in my recipe box!  p.s. i served this at a birthday party and there were compliments all around! :) p.s. don't forget when making this with fresh pineapple that you will need to buy pineapple juice as well!  i was so used to making a PUDC with canned pineapple (where you don't have to buy the juice because it's already with the pineapple) that i forgot to buy some!  i ended up using apricot juice and nobody was the wiser. ;)

This cake turned out fantastically!  I was able to use a fresh pineapple and squeeze enough juice out of the peel for the 3/4 cup. I baked it in a 10 inch cast iron pan and it made it easy to turn out onto the serving plate.  I had beginner's luck with this one and used light brown sugar since that's all I had on hand and we were snowed in.  Great smelling too!

Mine was too runny on the top but I substituted a lot of ingredients I didn't have (additional egg, and brown sugar) which is probably a huge reason.   It was all over when I flipped it over. Hopefully chilling it will help.

This cake came out really good. This was my first time making this cake so I do not have any recipes to compare to and the way this cake turned out, neither am I interested. This recipe is definitely a keeper. It was full of flavor and now my family is begging for more. I followed the directions exactly and everything came out pefectly.

I knew better than to bake the cake at 400 degrees but the first time I try a recipe I like to follow the directions exactly so I can give it a fair shot. The top edges of the cake (what became the bottom edges) were pretty dark after 30 minutes. I put in a toothpick and it seemed to come out clean. When I cut into the cake at a party later, the uncooked cake batter came oozing out of the middle. I will try this recipe again but will bake at 350 degrees and omit the pineapple juice from the brown sugar/butter mixture in the bottom of the pan. I think all that liquid contributed to raw middle.

I made this recipe as written and thought it was great!  I have never made pineapple upside down cake and was surprised with how easy this was to make.  I used a 9.5" deep dish pie plate to bake it because I was afraid it would run over in a 9" cake pan.  My family loved it!

This recipe was fairly easy to make and tasted great! the only problem was that half way through the time cooking my kitchen was filled with smoke. turns out the brown sugar mixture boiled over the pain top and spilled all over my oven!! it's going to be so hard to clean and it  made our whole house filled with smoke for a long time! I couldn't exactly take it out half cooked so i had to just cook it the remaining time. But like i said, it tastes really good :)

Excellent cake! I used less butter and more pineapple juice. Since I was out of vanilla extract, I added orange flower, which gave it a really nice aroma.

Simply the best pineapple upside down cake I've ever had. It was gooey, rich, and super moist. The only modification I made was adding some marachino cherries along side the pineapple. It took 25 minutes for mine to bake, but I have an oven that works overtime. Thank you for this recipe.

This was a very yummy pineapple upside down cake!  I love that it uses lots of pineapple juice, and the cake batter has a nice rich, smooth texture.  I scaled the servings to 22 and made it in a 9x13 pan, and added in maraschino cherries in the pineapple rings.

I loved this cake!  I added 1/4 cup spiced rum to the mix & used a can of mixed tropical fruit for the "topping."  Everyone loved it.  Mine took longer than 30 minutes to bake, more like 50 minutes, probably due to the size of my pan and the addition of the alcohol.

First time I have made and tried Pineapple Upside Down Cake. A friend of mine wanted one for his birthday and I aim to please, after a length of time I settled on this one and got to work. WOW! I must say it is a pleasure to find a recipe that turns out on the first try. Made it with no changes and tried the Creme Fraiche that was suggested.

Excellent! The only thing I added was a few cherries and pecans. Also, next time I'd beat the egg whites with an electric mixer instead of by hand.

Wonderful cake.  Moist, dense but not heavy.  The juice in the topping and cake add a great flavor.  I did have to add some orange juice as I only had the juice from the pineapple.  Batter was not runny at all.  Probably baked about 35 minutes and it was lovely.  Baked in a 9" deep-dish, glass pie plate.  Heavenly.

yummy... the best pineapple upside down cake I have ever had. I used a 8 inch square baking dish.worked out well.. It was so delicious. When I took it out of the oven, there was still a lot of the sauce that was bubbling in the oven..but the 10 minutes it stayed in the pan for it ended up soaking up all that yummy sweet sauce ... the cake was dense... but thats how it suppose to be.. so overall it was a perfect cake. And for sure use Fresh pineapple It really brings out the flavour. especially if the pineapple is sweet.  I also didnt have pineapple juice so i used O.J which tasted great also.thanks.

Flavor was wonderful.  Only trouble I had was that the part of the cake under the pineapple never cooked!  I tried inverting the cake and broiling the top, I even put it back in the oven for an additional 20 minutes to no effect.  That is the only reason that the recipe didn't get 5 stars in my book

Great recipe, however I would in the future only bake for 25 minutes.  I took it out after 27 minutes and still felt it was a couple minutes overcooked.

I thought this recipe was very easy to do and the results were very yummy.  I sliced the pineapple into small bite size pieces for the top since that is more managable to eat than the full slices.

Wonderful flavor.  Just like other reviewers stated this has more of a pound cake like texture.  The cake came out super moist and rich.

I loved the recipe! The cake turned out PERFECT, and the bottom was yummy for my tummy! I was a little confused b/c it calls for 3 eggs & you beat the egg whites, but then it says to beat 2 of the yokes to a lemmony yellow color, so that left me with one extra yoke, is that correct? It turned out great, so I'm guessing that is correct. I did bake it in an 8x8, which caused me to have a much longer bake time, 45 min at 400 degrees & the very middle was not done, but i still pulled it out b.c we had guests & i didn't mind eating the undone middle w/some of the cooked cake, it's all good b/c it's tastes great! THANKS fo this wonderful recipe. OH, and I added Cinnamon to the cake, I loved it! ****Update- I just made it again, today- double the recipe, put it in a 9x13, baked at 375 for 43min- PERFECTION!!!!

The middle of the cake was gooey after the 30 mins, although it was golden brown all around, so in the future I would cook it longer.  Other than that it was delicious and all my guests loved it!  I added coconut to the top (after I flipped it around so the pineapple was on top).

I used a 9X9 casserole dish to make this in order to prevent the sugar from burning in the 400 degree oven and I had to cook it for an additional 20min. My fiance loved it though.

I followed the directions and wasn't very impressed. The top did come out soggy and the cake itself was heavy. I was looking for a lighter cake with more pineapple flavor. I think that if I make this again I will use less butter in the brown sugar mixture and more juice along with pineapple shredded into the cake batter. My daughter who loves all things pineapple wasn't crazy about it either.

Best pineapple upside down cake you'll ever find!  I followed the recipe, but using readers' suggestions, I first melted the butter (I used Smart Balance) and brown sugar together in a saucepan before pouring it into the cakepan.  Also, I didn't have pineapple juice, so I pureed a few slices of pineapple with orange juice and used that.  I made a pretty decoration with the pineapple rings (which I had cut in half) and used fresh cherries and pecan halves. (DO NOT OVERLAP PINEAPPLE, YOU WON'T GET THE SAME RESULTS.) The finished product was the most beautiful, professional looking cake I've ever made! (And I've been baking for years!!  This is a real winner!

This is my first time making a pineapple upside-down cake - it came out perfect! The current picture of this cake scared me a little, though, because the cake appeared sort of burnt - so I lowered the temperature to around 375, and baked it for 25 mins. I also melted the butter/sugar mix together, and eliminated the juice from the topping (a reviewer said it was a bit gloopy!). My pineapple was cut into thin wedges, rather than circles, to create a sort of sunshine-look, which turned out great! The cake came out a beautiful golden colour. Yum! Definitely will keep making this in pineapple-season!

The cake taste very good but as many others have commented the top and sides were very well done, while the center was a mushy mess.  I turned over and placed in over for another 15 minutes.  Maybe cooking longer at a lower temperature would help?

I made this cake a few weeks ago, the best pineapple upside cake I ever had. I have a large family so I almost doubled it and made it in a 13x9 pan. This one is a keeper:)  Thanks for sharing!!!

Lovely cake, I added cherries on the top for decoration. The only thing I didn't like was that the topping was WAY too watery. I reduced the amount of pineapple juice in the topping to about 3tbsp and it turned out fine.

I made this for Christmas Dinner dessert.
It was really good!  I followed the recipe to a T.  The one thing I would change is maybe bake it at 375 instead of 400.  The top (bottom after it's done) of the cake was a little too brown for my taste...but I really loved the flavor of this cake!  Thank you for the recipe Veruschka!
Happy New Year!

Yum! This was my first cake from scratch, and the first pineapple upside down cake I've ever had! My fiance requested one for his birthday so I thought I'd give it a try, and I'm so glad I did. This is a delicious recipe for a wonderful cake. The cake itself is fluffy, moist and not too sweet, and the topping is decadent.

I've had very good results with this recipe, and it's definitely better than some other pineapple cakes I've tried. My only complaint is having to whip the egg whites separately, and for some reason, finding unsweetened pineapple juice that isn't in a huge jug is difficult!

I am not a cook at all and this was my first experience baking anything from scratch. And the recipe was great my family and friends enjoyed the final outcome. I just thought that the cake was to wet on the top with the glaze. But I will use this recipe again.

This is a pretty good cake.  My husband thought it was too dense and moist.  It is a heavy cake, but great flavour.  It was a great way to use up fresh pineapple.  Followed the recipe exactly.

This recipe was good, and I think it would have been better if I had used my usualy pan that I didn't have at the time. Because I used a larger pan the sauce had to go a longer way so made the cake turn out a little dry. I will have to try this again with the cake pan recommended.

This recipe was horrible.  It was not sweet like cake should be and very dry!  My 6 yearold only at the pineapples.  I had to toss just about the entire cake into the trash.

It was good but I am not sure of how well you fold in the egg whites and noticed air pocket holes in the cake. Loved the glaze it formed and came out easily in my cast iron skillet.

Delicious. Beating the egg whites makes a lighter batter I enjoyed. I passed on the cherries and added fresh blueberries instead.  I used a push pan, works great on any inversion cake, quiches etc.

My cake was in the oven for 10 minutes when I realized I left out the white sugar!  I was sure it was going to be a disaster but it was still delicious.  Looking forward to making it again in the future with all the ingredients next time!

This cake is delicious,. I have made it before, but I make it once a year so I forget that it tends to spill in the oven, it needs a cookie sheet underneath to avoid messing up the oven and smoking up the house. The top browns in 15 minutes in my over at 350, next time I will cover the pan with a sheet of foil for first 15 minutes.

This was yumm, probably yummier had I added more sugar to the bottom, bit since I was really short of it, it was rather sprinkled over the butter and then the pineapple. Other than that, just great, the cake was flufy and flavorful (following the details about the egg yolks and egg whites). I will be making this for sure!

I thought this recipe was great.  I did not change a thing and it was delicious.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because, like others have said, the topping was a little too liquid for my liking.  I would have given it 4 1/2 stars if I could, but it doesn't let you.  All in all, a great recipe.

I was looking for a recipe I could alter using stevia for my diabetic brother who loves pineapple upside down cake. All I did was exchange the sugar for 1/3 cup of stevia...and it came out perfect. I also added a bit more cinnamon because I knew using stevia would require more flavoring. It browned just right, it was fluffy, moist and light. Fresh pineapple makes all the difference, too. Great recipe! Added photo

A household favorite. I substitute a boxed gluten free yellow cake mix for the flour, baking powder, salt and white sugar mixture and do everything else according to the recipe. The gluten free requires an extra egg and slightly longer baking time. So yummy!

When I don't have fresh pineapple, I use two of the small cans of sliced pineapple (no sugar added) and that fills the bottom of a 9x13 pan and gives enough juice for the recipe.

This cake was amazing! I followed the recipe as is. I love the ooey gooey topping, the recipe was simply put and easy to make, and I baked it just a couple minutes longer so the bottom was a tad bit crunchy. I'm not the best at making things pretty, but the flavor was well balanced. The cake itself was not too sweet and the gooey topping was sweet enough to balance everything. Will definitely be using this recipe again.

I made this with the help of my husband who doesn't normally cook.   Below I suggest some changes for clarity.

4.  In large bowl, mix dry ingredients and set aside.

5.  In separate  bowl, mix egg yolks pineapple juice, cooled butter and vanilla.  

6.  Add to dry ingredients, stirring well.

7.  Beat egg whites until stiff. 

8.   Fold egg whites into other ingredients. 

9.  Pour over pineapple, brown sugar butter mixture in baking pan.

10.  Bake.... 

 I think that if you reverse steps 4 and 5 it would be helpful because the egg yolks, pineapple juice, vanilla and Hot butter (should probably add to let the butter cool ) added to the flour is a big lumpy mess.  He thought those items should be added to the egg whites because of the order given.  So, we glommed it together, had to whisk it a bit to get rid of the stick lumps.  which made the already collapsing beaten egg whites go runny.  I doubt this will turn out right, but we will see when it comes out of the oven.  
In separate bowl, beat egg whites until stiff.   Gently fold egg whites into flour mixture.
Pour over pineapple, juice and brown sugar mixture.
Bake...  I used the traditional case iron skillet.

SPRAY PAN WITH RELEASE SPRAY OTHER WISE WHEN YOU TURN IT OUT OF THE PAN FOR UPSIDE DOWN CAKE, THE CAKE STICKS UNEVENLY AROUND THE EDGES AND WON'T TURN OU EVENLY!!!!  So, we had a jumbled up cake that was dense and very unexciting.

Seeing the reviews that mentioned OJ as an acceptable substitute for fresh pineapple juice, I decided to try subbing red grapefruit juice (that was what I had on hand). It worked great. Mexican vanilla's floral aroma really shines in this recipe, too.

Good recipe. The specific directions regarding the eggs should be a bit clearer, so that people will know how important the egg process is in the recipe so that it turns out fluffy rather than dense! It's also worth noting that you'll think it's dry until you fold in the egg whites. Either way, it's a solid recipe and my cake cake out pretty beautifully! I did add a step - I seated the pineapple in a pan with butter before placing in the cake pan. I feel if I'd not done that with the fresh pineapple, it wouldn't have been the right texture after baking.

Made the recipe to a T the first time - results were dry due to high heat and whipped egg whites. Second time.. I used only 3/4 stick of butter, 2 eggs only, beating egg well  until incorporated, then add flour until just combined. Do not overbeat or you'll get a tough crumb. I used a kitchenaid mixer but mixed the flour by hand using the folding method. I uses well seasoned 10" cast iron pan and baked exactly 40 min. Cake was moist and very tender.

I baked it in a pre-warmed cast-iron skillet, on a lower rack in the oven. Cake was rising beautifully, but pineapple topping at the bottom of pan still very runny and not caramelized/crispy. Instead of broiling it in the oven, I put the cake back into the skillet and cooked it like a dutch pancake on the regular stovetop, until the bottom (aka top) had the right amount of crust. This way, the cake part doesn't dry out.

I cheated and used chunk canned pineapple because I didn't have fresh on hand when I found this recipe and wanted to make it. Other then that I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out awesome. My husband raved and I thought it was great too even though I am not the biggest pineapple upside down cake lover. Will keep this recipe to use again.

Made this cake yesterday.  It looked beautiful when it was done, but two hours later the center became gooey.  It was like it melted from the inside out.

I adapted this to a gluten free cake by using a pre-packaged yellow gluten-free mix.  Since I am eating a vegan diet, I did not use eggs but used aquafaba that I whipped and folded in.
 I ended up with a gooey center that I had to remake like julia on fire suggested.  Mine, I baked upside down on the oven proof platter.  I would suggest that it might be helpful to pre-bake the pineapple with sugar mixture in the cake pan before adding in the cake batter.  I loved adding in fruit juice to the batter.  I used apple cider and then added just a little bit of cinnamon to the sugar and pineapple mixture.  Was very good!  There is no comparison to the flavor that the fresh pineapple gives to this dessert.  Thanks for posting!

I have made pineapple upside down cake before and I have to say this is the best recipe I've tried, turned out fantastic and did not last long.  I followed the recipe to a T didn't change anything.  This one's definitely a keeper thanks for sharing

I had a very ripe pineapple that I wanted to use and of course I didn't have any pineapple juice, except for the actual fruit.  I grated a bit for the juice called for in the topping, but that was really messy.  I used milk instead of pineapple juice for the cake part and added some orange zest instead of vanilla. Almost used all 3 egg yolks, but fished one out just in time.  It looked great just out of the oven but when i flipped it over it was rather pale and uncooked in the middle.  I put it into a skillet with the pineapple side up and baked it till it was done.  It is a bit too sweet for my taste, but the cake is nice and light.  Needless to say the appearance suffered a bit from all the handling. Maybe I sliced the pineapple to thick?

Good recipe. I will be making it for an upcoming family get together for a breakfast dessert. I really like the top the cake was actually a little bit dry. I'm thinking about changing it up and putting pineapple tidbits in the batter to keep the moisture more in the cake. The top of the fresh pineapple tied in with the butter brown sugar and pineapple juice was really tasty! I just think the cake itself was not quite up to par.

This was wonderful! It will be my go-to recipe for pineapple upside down cake from here on. The only problem? I managed to spill half of it on my counter as I was attempting to put it on a plate. So it became pineapple upside down cake cobbler. No matter, the flavor was wonderful and my husband loved it too.

This was amazing - the fresh pineapple and pineapple juice along with beating the egg whites and folding in, make a superb cake.  Making it again for Easter!

I followed this recipe to the letter!!!!  The bottom did not bake as well as the top even though the top sprang back when touched.  When I flipped it over ( making the bottom the top ) it was raw in the middle but not around the outer edges.  IF ( and that is a big if ) I ever try this recipe again, I will bake for 45 min at 375 not the 30 min at 400 as instructed.  VERY disappointed.

Made it for my best friend's birthday as this is her favorite kind of cake.  The fresh pineapple is amazing - my previous experience with pineapple upside down cake was the spongy stuff with canned pineapple and ubersweet radioactive maraschino cherries - bleeeeeech!  This cake turned out delicious and amazing.  Not too sweet - I used frozen dark cherries on top, very good.  It was not at all dry, topping was perfect.

I made this tonight for my husband and our two very opinionated foodie sons! I used the recipe as a foundation, but kicked it up a bit with cinnamon infused whisky and apple juice. The initial batter had the consistancy of cookie dough, so I added about 1/4 cup of apple juice before folding in the egg whites... which did the trick!

Bought some whole pineapples on sale this week, and found this recipe. I've never made Pineapple Upside Down cake before (but I have eaten it:).  I made it exactly as written, and my family LOVED it! I do bake very well, and quite a bit, so standards are pretty high in this house. I will definitely make this again.

4 stars only because I also said a problem with it being uncooked in the middle and a ton of liquid when I flipped it. BUT...I took it to a BBQ this weekend and it was devoured in minutes. My boyfriend liked it so much I just made it again tonight. This time after I flipped it I transferred it to a pan, poured the juiced back on top (so it didn't dry out) and popped it back in the oven for about 15 more minutes. Perfect! Recipe is a definite keeper and I loved using fresh pineapple.

Very easy to make, followed the recipe to the letter, however, after letting it cool for 10 minutes and inverting onto a cake dish, IT WASN'T COOKED IN THE MIDDLE and ran all over the dish!  Very frustrating, seeing it is for dinner club tonight.  Not making this again . . . . .

great cake, but to save on time and money, i substitued a can of unsweetened pineapple slices and juice. i also added marashino cherries in the centers of the pineapples. 
this cake is a real crowd pleaser.

My husband loves pineapple upside down cake and was begging me to make one. This recipe is great!! It takes a little time using fresh pineapple, but is well worth it. The only change I made was to use Splenda for the sugars since we have to watch our carbs. This recipe is filed away to use many times!

I just made this the other day and it turned out wonderfully. I made a gluten-free version, substituting the all-purpose flour with 1 cup brown rice  flour and 1/4 cup each potato flour and tapioca flour, plus about a teaspoon of xanthan gum. Only issue I had is that I used a springform pan, which leaked, resulting in a lot of smoke from burning sugar on the cookie sheet underneath! It didn't stick to the sides at all so I'll use a regular pan in the future.

I loved using fresh pineapple rather than canned in this cake, and the recipe resulted in a very dense cake with a rich, buttery sauce.  My only problem was that after 25 minutes at 400 degrees, the outside of the cake was charring while the inside was still raw.  It solidified a bit after cooling, but was still a little doughy in the middle when it came to serving time.

I loved this recipe! It was fun and easy to make, and I am not a baker! I didnt have fresh pineapple, so I used canned, and the juice from the can. Instead of using all the butter, I cut the recipe in half and used apple sauce instead. The cake came out light, and very moist! I am not much for measuring ingredients and this recipe was very forgiving. I will definitely be making this again and next time I will share it with friends!

I made this last night and could not have been more pleased, it was very good.  I used the  suggestion from others about going with crushed canned pineapple, that really worked well.  Also, I used 3/4 cup of sugar instead of 1/2 cup and prepared the egg whites just before folding into the batter.  I baked at 325 degrees for 40 min as one user noted and it came out perfect.  I will definitely make this again.

I made this yesterday for a small gathering.  The only change I made was to use canned pineapple and the juice from the can.  Everyone loved it and had seconds so it was obviously a hit.  Served it with lite Coolwhip.

Yummy and simple..... Only changed two things. I used 8-inch cake pan, took about the same amount of time, just start watching it around 25mins. Then I broiled it for a bit like another reviewer suggested, it makes the topping less goo-like. :D Have Fun

This cake came out perfectly! I did admittedly substitute milk for the 1/2 cup of pineapple juice that went into the cake batter as I could not get a cup of juice out of the pineapple I cut. I also finely chopped about 2 cups of pineapple and put half the pieces on the bottom of the pan with the large slices of pineapple and then sprinkled the rest on top of the batter.

I altered the recipe: 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 or less white sugar, 1/2 cup butter, canned pineapple slices, the water (A little more than 3/4 cup as desired) in my canned pineapples as the pineapple juice, and only as much pineapple it took to cover my pan (a lot less than 1 whole pineapple), 375 degrees- until done. Remember to rotate the pan every now and then to prevent burning.  The cake turned out GREAT. I don't know why some people said their cake turned out dry...It's a Pineapple Upsidedown Cake!!!...Geez, it's not supposed to be moist, like your regular cake!!!....

This recipe is AWESOME! I used it to make pineapple upside down cake for the first time and it came out perfect. The second time I made it I added a can of crushed pineapple to the cake mix. I drained the juice out of the can first and then added the pineapple. I also added marachino cherries to my topping. Great recipe!

my 4yr old daughter helped me make this recipe. She loved it and it was easy to make. She kept telling her grandparents that it was healthy for them because it had fruit in it! I don't know about that but it was delicious.

I made this recipe with a few changes, I made a burre noisette with the butter to add a nuttier flavor and i used a bit more vanilla extract, and I got a dense but moist and flavorful cake. it is a simple recipe and i would use again.

the dough tastes like scone dough - mine didn't turn out much like cake but I really liked the texture. I substituted half the sugar with Steviva and next time I'll try to substitute the butter for a healthier option

The cake was delicious; however, it didn't look very appetizing.  I baked it just as instructed but the cake was a bit flat.  The topping was great, though.  I recommend doubling the ingredients and using 4-5 eggs.  Also, canned pineapple works just as well as fresh.

baked this as a surprise for my wife and it was a huge hit.  I did add a touch of caramel on top of the pineapple in the last two minutes while broiling in a CONVECTION oven.  Watch closely cause it will burn black if your lazy (ok I was lazy but only on a small test piece)

Really good cake.  Batter is so soft and moist. I just think it needs a little more sugar. Next time I'll add a cup of sugar to the batter instead of 1/2 cup.

I didn't whip the eggs as long as I should have so the cake ended up being more dense then it should have been. It was still really good. The only complaint my husband had was that the cake wasn't as sweet as he is used to.

I doubled the recipe and put it into a 14" round pan and baked for 55min at 325.  The only thing I changed was I used light brouwn sugar instead of dark. I also used canned sliced pineapple in its own juice.   Made for a silent auction at a High School function.  It was a big hit and top seller.  Beautiful looking cake.  Wish I took a picture.  Now I have to make one for the family.

I followed the directions exactly. My husband liked it but said that it needed more pineapple juice to enhance the flavor. Also, the topping was really runny so I have to figure out a way to change that next time.

This was an excellent cake!!!  I used canned pineapple chunks instead of fresh and I subbed I Can't Believe It's Not Butter sticks for butter.   I used a Bundt pan and it cooked completely evenly for exactly 30 minutes at 400 degrees.

This was great! I had never made one before and it was easy to make and very tasty too. I used chunks rather than rings since that is what I had in the panty and that worked just fine.

This recipe was rather dry, but it tasted fine. I'm thinking about adding some apple sauce to the flour mixture or maybe even some more butter or oil so that the cake bit isn't so dry. But my husband did enjoyed this recipe quite a bit and asked that I make it again.

We loved this cake.  My husband wouldn't keep saying how much he loved it.  I used fresh pineapple, and for the juice just blended some pineapple up in the blender and then squeezed out the juice (a little puree got mixed in, which was fine).  As far as pineapple upside down cake goes, this is a great recipe.

Well, I really goofed this one up, but yet it turned out great. I beat the egg whites and then added the liquid and dry ingrediaent to the egg whites. I essentially beat the air back out of the egg whites. Oops, wasn't thinking. Also, I only had enough pineapple juice for the topping, so I used OJ for the cake batter, and still it was delicious. The only thing I would like to do differently is to melt sugar in the topping better before putting it in the pan. I felt granuals in that delicious topping and I would prefer not to. All in all, it was an easy homemade cake (alternative to box) and flavor was excellent! My family gobbled it up!!!

Really delicious!  Make sure you use the right size pan though.  We used one just one inch less in diameter.  The top looked really done when we took it out of the oven, but when we flipped it over the center was still uncooked.  The edges were fantastic though!

I didn't have pineapple juice so I used Mountain Dew.  I also used light brown sugar.  Put a pan under the cake pan to collect splatter (I didn't and the smoke alarm went off).  Would be good served with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream.

As is the recipe is a little bland and dry so I am only giving it a three, but I tried to make it again and added more juice and it was a little moister.  I also used orange juice as I made it with a fresh pineapple hence no juice, that gave it a great complementary tast with the pineapple.  Also I don't think the top of the cake really needs the juice because the juice from the pineapple is probably enough, makes the top too soggy while the cake itself is a little dry.

Just finished making this cake...WONDERFUL!!!!! However, mine did not need to bake as long as it says. I only baked mine for about 22 minutes and it was already really brown on top but I did use a cast iron skillet so maybe that's why. I had to use canned pineapple since I didn't have fresh on hand and I can only imagine how GREAT this would be with fresh pineapple! Can't wait to make it again;)

Really good! Moist and sweet. Used canned pineapples instead of fresh, made it sweeter, I think.

This is a great recipe. Very simple and delicious. I will be making this recipe for years to come. Thank you for the recipe! (would have probably scored this higher if "stiff but not dry" were clarified on the insructions for the egg whites!!??? Nonetheless, my attempt was well received -rave reviews from all who ate it!!:)
Thanks a million!

One of the best Pineapple Upside Down cakes I have ever tried.  Right after making this one, I went to my recipe box and through my own recipe away.  My wife and family love it and it is gone shortly after I make it.

WOW. Just like my Mom used to make only better. I have to use Gluten Free Baking Flour (I use Red Mill) and some recipes don't do well with that substitution. But this one was absolutely fabulous. Only down side was that the sugar on the bottom came up and over the pan - making a smokey mess until I put alum foil underneath.

The cake came out excellent.  The only thing I change was the baking temp.  I bake my cake at 350 degree.  My family loves this cake. I am going to make it again.

FAB-U-LOUS! The only change I made was using splenda rather than sugar, which seems pretty silly considering the large amount of butter. It came out perfectly and is now on my husbands top 5 desserts of all time. SUPER TASTY! =P

I am so glad that I tried this recipe first before waiting until Easter to make it for my family. I followed the recipe perfectly and the top was runny and the cake wasn't cooked all the way through, though the outside was very golden brown and almost crispy. I had to throw it away. My husband was so disappointed, he really wanted this to work.

I was surprised when reading the reviews on this cake that it was rated 4 stars since so many reviewers either tinkered with recipe or had some complaint about the end result.  However, based on those 4 stars, I made this cake exactly as specified in the recipe.  The resulting cake just was not very good, and I don't believe that tinkering with the recipe will substantially improve it.  My recommendation would be to look for another recipe.
