This is a very good recipe. I added about 2x the amount of rice though. I also had to add some extra teriyaki sauce after it baked in order for it to have a teryaki flavor. All in all, it was yummy!

This was good, nice to have something different for dinner.  I know it's the basis for the recipe but I'm on a budget so I used a $0.70 block of fat free cream cheese instead of the $3 Philly Cooking Creme and it turned out fine.  I used brown rice instead of white and added 1/3 cup of cashew pieces.  I think this recipe would also work well with tuna.

I have to say that this was an amazing Recipe!
My 6 year old LOVED it. 
We all did.
I didn't have pineapple. 
I didn't have too much red pepper, so i added orange and yellow pepper.
I don't know what LBISCAY was thinking but it was AWESOME with the creme!
I am SOOO going to make it again and again!

This was pretty good. It's not a traditional asian dish if that is what you are looking for, but I really liked it. It was a quick pretty healthy meal. I've gotten so tired of chicken dishes, but this was a nice alternative.

This is so yummy.  I added about 1/8 tsp garlic powder and ground ginger to it.  Such an easy meal.

This was so easy to make and delicious.  The pineapple adds an interesting flavor! My wife loved it so I'll definitely make it again.

Very strange!!! The only reason I ate it was because I was so hungry by the time I finished cooking. First of all the ingredients are not Asian so don't make this if you're expecting that. I added a lot for teriyaki that directed and it still didn't taste like it. The cream just makes it weird. My husband will eat pretty mug anything and he even turned his nose up at it. I'll never make it again. DON'T BOTHER!!!

After only reading the good reviews I decided to make this dish and unfortunately I have to agree with the negative reviews.  The dish had a really strange taste and I won't be making it again.

I'm notorious for putting together odd concoctions, so I gave this one a try. It's not as bad as it's made out to be. A few tweaks, tho: I used brown rice, and a frozen steam fry vegetable medley. I also marinated the chicken in teriyaki for 1/2hr before starting. It's more of a soup than I expected, but not too bad.

this was horrible.  I thought it sounded interesting, but it was so bad we all threw it out and had pb&js.  The teriyaki and cooking cream just didn't go well together and it had a strange, almost bitter flavor.
