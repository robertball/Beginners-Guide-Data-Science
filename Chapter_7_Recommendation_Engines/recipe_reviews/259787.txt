My family all liked this one! I used a paleo flour mix of almond flour, coconut flour and tapioca for the gluten free flour mix.

I made another GF cornbread from here and it was thrown away. I made this last night and for my non GF husband and I, we were blown away. Bobs flour, added 1tsp salt and because I'm scared of too much sugar I only used 1/3 cup. Oh, and I only had a little milk so I had to use buttermilk too. I spread it in an oiled 10 inch iron skillet. It was wonderful, perfect and I had to take pictures!

I made this with yellow cornmeal and buttermilk in a 9 inch cake pan (I don't know what a n  8  x 13 pan is).  Next time I will add about 1/2 tsp of salt.  Otherwise, this recipe is a keeper.

I used buttermilk in place of the milk. I used the Cup4Cup brand of gf flour. It was delicious. My non gf family even loved it and didn't know that it was gf.
