I am so glad I found this recipe. We had gone on a vacation and I forgot to put my milk in the freezer. I don't like wasting anything and remembered that my mother used to make sour milk cake all the time. Only thing, I didn't have her recipe, and she passed quite some time ago. I prayed I would be able to find it in one my favorite places to go when I need a recipe. And, yeppers, there it was. I just love this recipe. Only thing I did didfferent was add more chocolate since that's my favorite food. And yes, I do use lard, cuz it makes it soooooooooo yummy. Just like mom's. Thank you again for posting this recipe, you're truelly heaven sent. :-)

Moist and delicious. I substitued plain yogurt for sour milk. I used 1/2 c brown and 1/2 cup white sugar and used mixed spices (cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, etc) instead of cocoa. I also didn't have lard (?) so I used butter flavoured margarine. Took a while longer to bake but boy was it good. Lastly, I added 1/2 a pack of yeast. Made it a bit fluffier and less dense. yum!

This cake went really well once I realised I had to use my electric mixer! I made cupcakes because I didn't have a pan that size handy - they were great! I added crumbled SKOR bars to the middle of the cupcakes and topped with chocolate icing and more crumbled candy bars - DE-lightful!

This cake didn't rise much, was dense and firm.  It's more of a chewy cake - like hot milk cake. It does have a very nice flavor though.  I was looking for a more fluffy white birthday type cake.  I would cream the sugar and butter instead of mixing in with egg, as the butter stayed in clumps rather than creamed...but perhaps that's what gave the cake the little "pockets".

A good way to use up my sour milk, but otherwise just "OK".  Previous reader's suggestion to increase cocoa was good, otherwise you need to frost or have a sweet sauce to make up for the missing sweetness.  Would make a good base cake for a German Chocolate cake - the coconut pecan sauce would more than make up for the sugar!

This was moist and pretty tasty. Not a "fluffy" pure white cake if that's what you're looking for. I would make it again I think.

This recipe was ok but not nearly enough chocolate for my taste and perhaps not sweet enough either.  The texture was good.  Others that shared it liked it well enough.  I will make it again and double the amount of cocoa, add another 1/4 cup of sugar, 1/2 tsp of salt, and substitute oil for the lard.

This cake isn't bad.  Bf told me to use up what I had in making a bday cake, so I chose this since we have some mik that's going bad.  It tastes okay, but it's nothing special.  Bf did seem to like it.  I had a container of store bought chocolate chip fudge icing so I put some on while the cake was still warm so it would melt over it.  It added some sweetness and flavor.  I also used a bundt pan instead of a square pan.  This seems very similar to the Sour Milk Spice Cake on here, which I may also try since I still have sour milk left.  Thanks for the recipe!

Sorry, I just don't see it.  I thought this was terribly lacking in any flavor and dry.  It was edible (hence a 2 instead of 1), but it almost wasn't worth eating.  I noticed people adding more cocoa, but I'm not a chocolate freak and prefer the more subtle flavor of just a bit of cocoa, so I don't see that as a solution.

looked at the reviews and did add more cocoa...used 6 tablespoons cocoa total...i thought next time would use some bacon grease as some of the lard...sprinkled powdered sugar over the top when cooled...sure tobe popular with my church family
