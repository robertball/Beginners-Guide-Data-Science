First time I made this I found the chicken to be lacking a lot of flavor. Second time I made it I added a few changes... and it came out great. I cut out about half the mayo and about half the minced onion. Then I decided to coat the chicken in bread crumbs before spooning the glaze onto the chicken. I added a few seasonings such as pepper, parsley flakes, a generic Italian seasoning mix, and a tiny bit of salt. With those changes the chicken cameout juicy and a lot more flavorful. I served it over Jasmine rice and it was great. Hope this helps a few of you.

My husband and I really enjoyed this dish! I used a packet of Lipton's Onion soup and a little less mayo... more Apricot preserves. I mixed up the sauce in the morning, so the onion soup would soak up the other flavors. I'm sure I'll be making it again, since hubby liked it so much! Thanks for the post, Retha.

I appreciate a good apricot chicken recipe but this isn't one of those. My husband gave it 2 stars and I had to agree. This dish had an odd flavor and it's looks were unappealing. There are much better uses for chicken breast. Sorry, won't make this again.

Cubed chicken, used 2 tbs. onion soup mix instead of the minced onion, and I used 2 tbs. mayo and 6 tbs. apricot preserves. It was so delicious! My boyfriend loved it too and this will become a regular in my house!! Thanks for a great recipe!

Good, and easy marinade that would also go well over shrimp, or maybe even ham? Easy to make, not too sweet, I'll hang on to this recipe.

I really liked this recipe.  The first time I made it a followed it exactly and it was good.  The second time I made 2 times the sauce and added more apricot.  I then served it over white rice.  It was a huge hit!

This was okay.  Maybe too much mayonnaise for our taste.

My husband liked this recipe, I did not.  Too much mayo and onion.  I will try again with some modifications.  I expected more of a glaze than a paste.  Glad hubby liked it, though!

Extremely simple and fast.  I used Smuckers Simply Fruit raspberry instead of apricot and it tasted great.  Also, used toasted minced dried onions. Who knew you could bake chicken so quickly?
