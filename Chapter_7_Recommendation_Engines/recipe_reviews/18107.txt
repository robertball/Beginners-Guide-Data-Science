Our family and dinner guests enjoyed this dish last night with steamed rice. I had to prepare the dish early, so I browned the chicken, then put everything together and let it cook in a crock pot on high for 4 hours. During the last hour, I added fresh thyme, and it was wonderful! Thank  you.

This was ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!  I give it 5 stars, cause seriously, I was really nervous making it... I didn't see how the olives would be good mixed with tomatoes and wine, but it was exquisite!  Will definitely make again, and I have already forwarded the recipe to my sister!

One thing I changed... only had 3 breast, which was plenty for my husband and I, but kept other measurements the same. Also used one can of diced tomatoes... drained it and added 2 fresh tomatoes quartered.
Delicious.. As recommended, I served it over Saffron rice, what a great idea.. TOO GOOD!

Like others I found this way too bland as written and I honestly think 45 minutes is way too long to cook the chicken as it ends up turning out rubbery. The second time I made this I doctored it up with loads more garlic, lots of fresh basil and oregano and substituted heavy cream for the chicken broth. I also removed the chicken breasts after browning them, made the sauce, brought that to a simmer then re-added the chicken and simmered it for 20 minutes. It turned out much better for my tastebuds.

I am embarrassed to say, I have had this sitting in my RB for over 5 years LOL and finally got around to making it.  It was a desperation dinner, but it was very good.  All I had was a dozen chicken legs in the freezer so I thought I would give it a try.  It was GREAT.  We LOVE LOVE LOVE green olives and DD had a great time cutting the olives for this.  I only had one Roma tomato and a few grape tomatoes so I used one can (10 oz?) of diced tomatoes, didn't drain and also the fresh ones I had on hand.  A LOT of green olives, maybe 30-40, mostly cut in half, and dried Italian seasoning (no bay leaf). Also, I only used 2 large cloves of garlic, next time will go for 4.  I didn't have any white wine so I used about half of the tomato can full of chicken broth and a splash of Merlot.  I covered and baked for around an hour and the chicken was falling off the bone. I served it over white rice and with English peas.  It was a huge hit! Both my 5 & 2y/o ate 2 chicken legs each.  Hubby took leftovers to work.  This is a keeper for our family for sure!!
Thanks for sharing!

Great dish. The olives mellow considerably as they cook. I skipped the white wine and added additional chiken broth to replace the liquid. I also used canned diced tomatoes. I have been making a version of this for years that involves breading and frying the chicken before simmering it - I like the ease of prep on this version. My other version doesn't include tomatoes - it's good both ways.

I made this recipe exactly as written and it turned out fantastic! To the reviewers that found it dry or overcooked, try flipping the chicken over halfway through, and I even basted it every 10 minutes or so. As per other reviewers, I was afraid the final product would be too salty, so I didn't add any salt and it was perfect. I used all chicken stock, as I don't care for wine in cooking, and used cornstarch to thicken the sauce when it was done to pour on the top. It was great!

Very yummy!  I totally forget to put the tomatoes in but it turned out great.  As a couple of people noted I added some corn starch at the end to thicken the sauce.  Served over rice.  Will make again.  Will probably bake next time because the chicken was not very tender.

Good flavors.  I used thin sliced chicken breast cutlets, pounded uniformly thin.  This reduced the cooking time to almost nothing.  I also added a few canned artichoke hearts cut into quarters, just because I had them on hand.  I also noticed if can substitute black olives such as calamata and the flavor is still very good. A keeper.  Thank you for this recipe.

Although modified a bit, I think I achieved a similar result.  Rather than thyme, I used Italian Seasoning which had thyme in it.  I also used canned diced tomatoes (no fresh on hand), 1/2 black olives & 1/2 green olives (thought the appearance would be better), and no broth as the chicken breasts were frozen which gave off sufficient liquid with the wine.  I did deglaze the pan with flour and wine but also had to add 3-4 T. concentrated dried tomato paste to help thicken it.  Having only 4 chicken breast halves, the sauce was sufficient to serve over pasta.  This is a quick meal which will become one of my go-to recipes when I just can't think what to cook!

This is fantastic! I find that the only change that I make is to omit the extra salt (seasoning the chicken, etc.) because the olives add enough salt. I just season it with Italian seasoning before browning.

....sound delicious...this is not a review , rather an opinion, breast of chicken, as like any lean meat, will toughen up the more you cook it... I think 7 to 10 mins depending on thickness will do the trick on this dish...unless you prefer to use bone in chicken legs...like the ones in the ilustratiion.

This is really lovely, very tender.  I've made it many times, and it's always a hit. Great as leftovers too.

This was alright, but even adding in some basil and doubling the garlic and olives, it was still pretty bland.

I *LOVE* the flavor of this dish - I also was skeptical cause of the olives, but I ended up eating those as well, their flavor mellowed out with the wine and tomatoes.  I loved the tomatoes - I was going to get canned but then got fresh and I'm glad I did.  I used a pino grigio which worked great - I didn't want my dish sweeter so I did not use a dessert wine or anything.  I used manzanella spanish olives.  I don't know how everyone else got tender chicken - mine was hard and flavorless. I'mg oing to use dark meat next time cause that will definitely work, or will crock pot the chicken all day after reducing the sauce.  Can't wait for lunch!

My family loved this one!  I'm an olive fan and loved the tangyness of the sauce.  I followed the recipe exactly and served it with brown rice with some sauteed veggies and a little of the chicken sauce stirred in.  This will definitely become a regular meal in our house and was a welcome change from the same ole stuff.

If cooked as written, it would not have much flavor. I started out making it as is, but quickly realized the other reviewers who made suggestions about adding cream, reducing broth, and adding fresh basil and oregano were spot on. It was better this way, but still I would not make it again.

Very yummy.  For my husband and I, I cut the recipe in half and then only used 2 chicken breasts (this gave us extra sauce to pour over rice.)  I used extras olives and thickened the sauce a little with corn starch.

Made this the other night and just getting to write a review.  It is great mix of flavors, really surprising when you look at the ingredient list.  Only thing I changed was added more garlic, we love our garlic.  I always chop the garlic really fine and leave it in the sauce.  I have also done a very similiar recipe with fish and we loved it also.  I use a firm fish like cod and quickly brown the fish on one side, remove to plate make sauce and then add the fish back and let simmer till fish is done.  Very quick, easy and everyone loved it also.

This is so easy to make, and tastes so good!  I followed the recipe exactly, and the hardest part about cooking it is waiting for it to be done simmering.  I've subbed veggie broth for the chicken broth, and it makes no difference.  And, they taste even better the day after you make them :)

My husband and I loved this dish.  I used skinless chicken thighs since I had them on hand and diced canned tomatos, otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  The flavors of the wine, olives and thyme made this dish just delectable.

I changed this recipe up just a bit.  I used kalamata olives, sun-dried tomatoes and added quartered artichokes.  The flavor was great but the olives bring a lot of salt into this recipe.  I would definitely cut back on the amount of olives and omit any table salt for seasoning.  The chicken cooked in about twenty minutes.  I think 45 minutes would have made it too tough.  I added some heavy cream to the sauce along with cornstarch at the end.  This made for a rich and creamy sauce so I served it over linguine.  Turned out fabulous!  My husband couldn't get enough.

Made this for my parents' last night to rave reviews!  My chicken cooked super fast so I had to take it out, boil the sauce to reduce it and thicken it up with a little cornstarch.  Unfortunately, I reduced it a little too late and didn't have the amount of sauce I wanted but it was still a winner!

The flavor of this dish is very good and we both enjoyed it!  I used cherry tomatoes, halved, and doubled the olives, as mine were very small.  I went about this a little differently.  I browned the chicken and removed it from the pan.  I simmered the sauce ingredients for a few minutes before adding back the chicken.  I covered my pan and simmered for only about 5 minutes at which point my chicken was perfectly tender and cooked through.  Simmering for 45 minutes is not necessary and would probably toughen up the chicken.  At the end I did thicken the sauce with a little cornstarch mixed with water, just enough to give it some body.  I served this over saffron rice, which was a wonderful idea!

This was really good.  It is a keeper in my house.  I did not peel my tomatoes but did squeeze most of the seeds out.  I also thickened my juice with water/cornstarch mix.  This was even better the next day.

Very easy and tasty.  I usually use fresh ingredients, but in this case I did use canned Italian style diced tomatoes.  I only used chicken broth due to an allergy to wine, but used 2 TBSP Italian dressing to cook the chicken in instead of oil (I halved the recipe)  as I find chicken cooked in only olive oil is flavorless.  Other than these minor changes to adapt to our taste I followed the directions carefully and served over rice!

This was tasty! I did make a few changes. I used all chicken broth (no wine) and 1 canned tomato's and fresh tomato's. Also added plenty of garlic and left it in and canned black olives. Paired it w/ lemon couscous.

I halved this recipe still using the same amount of olives as I love olives.  I did not peel the tomatoes and that was not a problem, I did however core them. The chicken was tender and it did not take 45 minutes to cook. I do think there was still too much liquid. But overall it was still a decent recipe and I got my olive fix!

Great recipe, easy to fix, great taste.  What more could you ask for.  Served on a bed of pasta with olive oil & garlic.  Perfect.  Thanks for sharing.

My family loves this chicken. I use 2 cans of Italian-seasoned diced tomatoes instead of the fresh tomatoes to make it a little saucier and serve it over rice. It even works great in the crock-pot!

The chicken was a bit dry and the sauce could have saved it but it was just too salty for my taste.  I found the recipe itself a little confusing...says to use 4 crushed cloves of garlic and then says to remove the garlic and bay leaf at the end.  I obviously couldn't remove the garlic at that point but ended up removing the olives instead because they were just too overpowering.  I don't think I would make this again, thanks though.

Very tasty. I used small vine ripe tomatoes which were sweet and delicious. I added them during the last 5 minutes so they wouldn't completely dissolve. I think I will add more olives next time because they really add a nice flavor to the dish. Watch your cooking time. This cooked a lot faster than the recommended time.

This recipe was delicious.  A++++++!!  I used thin cut chicken, and the flavor got in really well and the chicken wasn't tough at all.  In fact, it was really tender.  Definitely a keeper!

I'm lazy... I threw all of it in the crockpot and it was awesome. Made some white rice with wine and sweet onion and I just tore myself away from the kitchen eating out of the pan. I guess I should say I edited the recipe some. I used a whole bulb of garlic with the cloves just thrown in... and a lot of pepper. Will make again with more olive. Awesome crockpot recipe when I don't have time to cook.

Very good! I took the advice of others and added some seasoning...just a little oregano & basil. I also floured the chicken before I browned it & used a can of diced tomatoes since I didn't have any fresh ones. I served it over brown rice. It was very tasty. I will definately make this again...but try it in the crock pot. Thanks for the recipe. I love green olives!

This was great I did not have wine so I added a can of broth and can of diced garlic tomatos istead of fresh. The sauce was watery so I just threw the minute rice in with them. The leftovers were fought over the next day it was that good. Thanks for the recipe, try this if you like olives this is a keeper!

This was excellent!  I used diced canned tomatoes (with liquid), as I didn't have fresh, and ended up having to thicken the sauce with a little corn starch and water, but otherwise I did everything else the same and it was so good!

Used 6 drumsticks, skipped the wine, and used chicken bouillon and some chili powder instead of chicken stock. Mixed everything together, covered and baked for an hour. The result was a very rich soup that went along great with rice. Will definitely make again.

Thought this was good. I had about a half of a jar of garlic stuffed green olives that I've been trying to figure out what to use them in to get rid of them. This recipe was it. Instead of 8 chicken breasts, I took three large breasts and sliced them into thirds. Browned the chicken in a skillet and then added garlic, bay leaf, thyme, pepper, 1 large tomato(diced), my half a jar of green olives(chopped), a jar of pimentos (without the olives), 1 1/4 cup white wine, 1 1/4 cup chicken broth. Brought to a boil and reduced heat to medium and continued to let the liquid reduce. Served with saffron rice and roasted broccoli. Turned out very good and all of my green olives are gone :) Thanks for the recipe!

This is now one of my favorite combinations. I think next time I will perpare and simmer the sauce and poach halibut in it during the last 10 min of cooking. This is really, really good.

This dish was so easy to make and turned out great. I used canned diced tomatoes with all of their juices and let it cook until the liquid reduced by half. The chicken came out so tender you didn't even need a knife. I served this with a box of rice pilaf. Even my 6 year old loved it!

It smelled great, but lacked flavor.  I don't know that I would make it again, but if I did I would probably consider using two cloves of chopped garlic and frying the chicken with them.  Later, I would add the other ingredients minus the broth and just add a 1/2 chicken bouillon cube and a little bit of water.  45 minutes was too long, I'm sure it would have been fine after 20min.  Good luck, I hope you can pull more flavor out of your dish than mine had!

very nice Mediterranean dish.  Used 2 thighs and 2 legs bone-in instead of boneless breasts.  Had a sweeter wine so there was no tartness w/the tomatoes.  Added 1 medium onion cut into slices and put into the sautee w/chicken for some substance. Used black olives from family orchard and added a bit more thyme and a sprinkle of basil.  Served w/saffron rice as suggested, and was very nice meal.  Even w/bone in meat it was very quick and easy but w/quality taste.

Ok this was the most amazing tasting chicken ever. We used chicken thigh and cut it up into small 1 inch chunks. We marinated it in extra virgin olive oil and olives. Then we sauteed it along with some tomatoes, onions all the spices and chili peppers(We like it really hot). And then added some wine. Didn't even add the chicken broth. Yummy tender chicken. One of the best I have had. 
Thanks for the recipe.....This one is gonna be a regular for us from now on.

I made this as written except with all chicken broth in place of wine. The 45 minutes cooking time seemed far too long which made my chicken breast a bit tough and dry but the flavor was excellent. I think I will use a bit less liquid and shorten the cooking time to 20-25 minutes, maybe less, just until the meat is cooked through. One MUST love the green olive flavor to appreciate this recipe as it really stands out even over the fresh garlic. I found it to be wonderful, but hubby said "so-so".

This was so very good. We love olives & tomatoes, so I followed the recipe to the "T" and it was yummy. I used a can of tiny cherry tomatoes w/ some of the juice & it was almost perfect! Also added onions, as we love them. This one's a keeper!!!

I liked this recipe better than hubby did.  It's the sauce that makes the recipe!  The chicken is just chicken but the sauce is good on potatoes or rice!

This recipe was wonderful! I don't like tomato so I left those out but made everything else exactly as written except scaled down for one. My 2 yr old daughter and I ate every bit! The second time i made it, I cubed it into small chunks before cooking and added black olives.  When it was done I spooned it into a half a whole wheat pita with hummus...oh man! Spectacular!

I'd give this one 5 stars, but it ended up with way too much liquid. However, it was delicious and easy.

I Love this recipe and have made it many times. My kids (5 and 7) requested this dish while recovering from tonsillectomies. I have started making just a few slight modifications, but stay true to the heart of this recipe. I usually use boneless skinless chicken thighs. In the off season I substitute canned Italian seasoned tomatoes for the fresh tomatoes and the thyme. And I ALWAYS double the sauce (except the olives) so that I can add cooked angel hair pasta just before serving. Trick is to simmer it on low until all the flavors have blended. Definitely a restaurant quality meal!!

This was amazingly deliscious. I made it exactly as directed but used bone-in chicken and cooked it for 1 hour. It came out perfect. The dish made the house smell so good. I used the sauce on top of white rice and it was so yummy. The enitre family loved it! Thanks for an awesome recipe!

The flavors are great but the sauce is very runny. I had to remove the chicken after 45 mins. and boil the sauce to reduce it. Next time...and there will be a next, I will cut the stock in half. Thanks!!!

DH and I loved this super-easy dish! We love olives, so I doubled the amount, and used chicken broth only since I had no white wine open. I definitely recommend browning the chicken without salt, as the olives make it salty enough. (I thought it was a touch too salty, but DH disagreed!) Can't wait to try this one with the wine!

a keeper!!I changed a few things.lightly floured chicken breasts.Browned in olive oil and butter.No salt.Used canned diced tomatoes undrained.Also added a can of ripe pitted olives,as we like them.they made a nice complement with the green olives.Dry vermouth as the wine.Wanted to try out a new cast iron pot,so used that and let all simmer for about 1 1/2 hours.Really delicious.Will serve to company this week.Served with brown wild rice,salad thats all you need.

This was sooo very delicious!  I wasn't sure how the tomatoes would taste, but they complimented this dish so well!  It has wonderful flavor and my husband loved it as well.  I served it with rice pilaf and steamed spinach.  Thank You so much!!!

This is delicious!  The only change I made was using chicken broth for all the liquid.  I used four Roma tomatoes and it turned out wonderful.  The different flavors were fabulous together.

Extremely easy to make and tastes great! Chicken comes out really tender and juicy. I loved it and I don't even like green olives, although my 3 year old and my husband adore olives, and they couldn't get enough....  Tasted great with some vegetable risotto!

I gave the dish a 5; teenaged boys a 3/4.  I found the olives a nice tart balance to the chicken and wine. I added extra garlic and simmered the dish quite a long time. I will make this one again.

This is an awesome recipe.  I drain and rinse my olives (I made mine with calamata olives.).  I used bone in chicken breasts.  Because of the bone in,  I covered the mixture for the final cooking stretch due to concern that the bone in chicken breasts would dry out, as I cooked it.  I also thickened the sauce right before serving with a little bit of cornstarch.  This is definitely a keeper!  My family absolutely loved it!

We didn't have all of the ingredients, so impromised.....no fresh tomatoes so we used Rotel spicey tomatoes-one can.  We have wonderful jalepeno and garlic stuffed green olives, so we used those.  Yep-we kicked it up a couple of notches...also served it with "homemade" egg noodles!  Definately a keeper!

I decided not to use boneless skinless chicken breasts, so I just used some chicken legs that I had around. They needed the full 45 minutes. This recipe was tasty, but a bit briny for me. Perhaps that's because I don't love green olives that much. My husband, who loves green olives, really enjoyed this recipe.

I was eager to try this recipe, but was a little disappointed with the results.  The chicken became overcooked with the amount of cooking time specified.  I also disliked the thyme seasoning, which seemed to conflict with the taste of the olives.  In addition, it wasn't quite sweet enough so I found myself adding a teaspoon of brown sugar to the sauce.  I don't think I will make it again.

This recipe was very good.  the sauce was delicious and reminded me of the recipe for Spanish Cod on this website that is also very good.  The only thing I did not like about this recipe was that the cooking time listed was too long, so just be aware of when the chicken is done to avoid overcooking.

The sauce goes wonderfully over rice! I made extra sauce and mixed it in the rice because it gives it fabulous flavor. What a fabulous sauce. Chicken does cook quicker than recipe says, so just keep an eye on it.

The first time I made this I absolutely loved it.  I had leftovers two days later and it tasted even better.  Next time, I cooked it up two days in advance and had all that extra marinating flavor at the first serving.  The family agrees... this is a winner. (Used canned diced tomatoes and served over rice.)

Excellent, flavored-packed chicken. I used a whole chicken rather than breasts, canned tomatoes rather than fresh, and added a good shake of basil. I was out of white wine, so I used red, but white would have been better. This was great served over rice!

I loved this recipe.  Thank you to the other reviewers.  I did thicken the sauce by whisking corn starch into a small amount of cold water. I also added about 2 tbls.of onion.  I only had cheap chardonnay, but the taste was still good.  I served it with rice made with chicken broth. My husband who isn't crazy about olives, said that it was real good.

Fantastic!  My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe!  No flavor overpowered any other.  Very well balanced.  I served it with garlic mashed potatoes to pick up on the garlic in the chicken.  Thank you, Christine!

Cook in Crock Pot - then serve with spaghetti after taking out the juice and thickning up with Corn Starch.  Cut up chicken and put in the sauce while thickening.

I used pre-sliced olives for convenience. I added some cornstarch as someone suggested. It did cook fairly fast no more than ten minutes needed after the browning stage. It was a very quick and easy meal to put together. I will probably make it again sometime.

This recipe was a great guide, but I changed it substantially. I added Smoked Paprika and a tsp of harrisa paste, because I could.  When it was done I still had a lot of liquid leftover, so I took all the solids out and cooked the sauce down a bit, and added some Wondra (maybe a 2 or 3 tsps) to thicken the sauce.  I served it over brown rice.

We just had this for supper. Very good. The only thing I did different is that I marinated chicken in Italian salad dressing for 2 hours. Served over fettuccini.

My roomate and I made this last night!!! All I can say is "amazing"!!!! The chicken was so moist and tasty. The entire chicken, from inside to out. I would make this again. I didn't eat the olives even though they were cooked with dish. Anyway this was awesome. :)

This was delicious!  Will definately be making again!  After reading the reviews, I added flour to the chicken before browning, then removed from the pan.  I also added black and kalamata olives along withe green (stuffed w/jalepenos) and simmered on low for 25-30 minutes.  I then sliced up the breasts before returning to pan and simmered, covered for the final 15 minutes.  The sauce was perfect - not watery at all becuase of the floured breasts!  Served over Tomato, Florentine Rice - definately a keeper!!!!

I used cheddar stuffed green olives as that is what I had on hand. I thought this was a little bland so at the very end I added some cream cheese and it was just AWESOME. I also chopped the garlic and kept it all in the dish instead of removing at the end as in the recipe.

This was simply wonderful and light with perfect flavor.  My husband loves green olives.  I followed the recipe and would not change too much.  I simmered the chicken in the broth/wine for about 30 minutes after browning and..then pulled it off the heat and covered for about 20 minutes while the rice cooked.  It will be a keeper for us.

I love olives and was looking for a way to cook with them. This recipe is very good...I would give it 4 stars but feel the olives almost need to be pureed or chopped with a parmesan mix and placed inside the chicken breasts... would enhance the olive flavor within the chicken better. Otherwise... very tasty!!

The chicken was great, but I made a couple changes. When it had simmered for a while, I added some roux and a small can of tomato sauce to make a thickened sauce. Next time, I'll use black olives as the green were a bit too much flavor.

This recipe has been sitting around my house for awhile because I was nervous about making it.  I should have just made it! It was delicious.  I added more olives than the recipe called for, left out the wine and used all chicken broth and cubed my tomatoes instead of quartering them.  I served them over pilaf because it's what I had and I will for sure make this recipe again.

Great for something different. To eliminate some cooking time, i removed the chicken after simmering for about 15 wrapped in tin foil, and brought rest of dish to a boil for a few minutes than added corn starch on low to thicken. Turned out perfect! I also altered this recipe by adding fresh green beans with rest of ingredients & i removed them as well with chicken before boiling.

I love this recipe!!! It is so easy to make, I always serve with rice, frenchbread, green beans and salad!My 6 year old is the pickiest eater and he loves this, last night he said momma this is the best dinner ever. The only thing I do different is I use canned tomatos instead of fresh.

Delicious. The sauce is very runny, however so I suggest thickening it. I used cornstarch which worked OK. The flavor was delicious, and the green olive flavor was not overpowering as I had thought they would be. I used canned tomatoes with basil and chopped them up for extra flavor. Will be making again, next time with pasta (not rice).

This is an easy, tasty, versatile recipe made with simple ingredients.  It is great as is but I do usually substitute boneless thighs and canned tomatoes.  The only real change I make is adding in a bit of butter just at the finish which thickens the sauce and makes it stick better to pasta.  Also, if you are a veggie gardener like me, this is a great recipe for using up some of your zucchini.  Just put slices in a few minutes before serving.

This was different but good. I love olives...I only simmered the chicken for about 10 minutes or so...not 45 minutes..My goodness, it would have tasted like rubber...I probably won't make it again, but I am glad I tried it :)

I really really enjoyed this recipe. I'm in love with olives and garlic and the combination of both was delicious. Changes I made: I used Greek Seasoning instead of salt to season the chicken breasts before browning. I didn't have any white wine so I used all chicken broth. I also added lots of extra chopped garlic in bigger chunks. I also wanted a thicker sauce so I added some cornstarch at the advice of others. My boyfriend hates olives so I just pulled the chicken breasts out of the broth before adding the cornstarch and he loved the chicken. Will for sure make again.

This made a very nice change for our Sunday dinner!
I used boneless/skinless thighs, 1 can diced tomatoes, extra garlic, sliced black olives and green olives along with the rest of the ingredients and cooked it it the crock-pot all day on low. Served this with rice and green beans. The crock-pot made this a bit soupy so thats what I did with the leftovers, made soup!! Very good lunch at work all week! Next time will cook this on top of the stove and will hope for a more reduced sauce.

This was the best!  I used a can of stewed Italian tomatos, 1/2 of onion sliced and no chicken broth, I used a fresh squeazed lemon instead.  What a flavor... I will make this recipe over and over again.

Not sure what went wrong here but this recipe just didn't do it for me or my husband. I followed some of the same substitutions as others but we just didn't care for it. It smelled great while cooking but ended up being really bland. I think this recipe, or variations of it go best with fish.

We loved it. I just used all chicken broth and skipped the wine since I did not have any and on the tomatoes I used canned fire roasted tomatoes.
