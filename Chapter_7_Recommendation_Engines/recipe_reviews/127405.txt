Served it Christmas Eve and it was fantastic.  

I do recommend using the tiny candy canes to crush if you cannot by pre-crushed canes.  The larger ones are tough to break.

Was looking for a twist on the normal cheesecake for Christmas. This recipe is great.

Really good...had to use meat hammer to crush candy canes, but made a very pretty topping.

I agree, great recipe, but I used chocolate cookie (Oreos) instead of graham crackers.  Everything else was stock.  I had many compliments!

This was awesome.  I made one change that made a huge difference:  I used OREO cookies instead of vanilla wafers. It was so much better that way.  DELICIOUS!!!!!  No leftovers.

This is delicious! I used a pre-made graham cracker crust and sub'd milk chocolate chips for the white chocolate. Very very good. I will defiantly make it again with the white chocolate.
