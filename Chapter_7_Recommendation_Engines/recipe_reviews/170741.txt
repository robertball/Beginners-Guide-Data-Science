As a Pittsburgh native, this is exactly the way Ham Barbecue should taste. This would be one of my favorite dishes my mom made when I was younger (paired with pierogies of course). I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe.

I used half ketchup/half barbeque sauce, added in some fresh minced garlic and I spread garlic butter on the kaiser rolls THEN I toasted them.  My family LOVED these sandwiches. Simple and delicious.

This is the same as my mom's recipe except for 2 ingredients.  We use Heinz (Pittsburgh) Chili Sauce and we don't use yellow mustard.  The amount of vinegar is 2T and 1 to 2T of brown sugar. We like them sour.  I must say that this recipe is the closest that I've seen!  I grew up 30min north of the 'burgh.

I grew up on these. Can't get chipped ham here in VA so everytime we go "home", I usually bring back about 10 pounds (of Islay's) and keep it in the freezer to make my sandwiches. Can't watch a Steeler Super Bowl without them!

I am originally from Pittsburgh so when I couldn't reach my mother to get her recipe I decided to try this one. The flavors are very similar but this sauce is thicker. Also, its very important to use Isleys chopped or "chipped" ham, if your region sells it. The ham makes this sandwich! My mothers recipe is quite different though, she uses the onion and butter, 1 bottle of Heinz chili sauce, fill the chili bottle with water, 1 tablespoon of vinegar and a 1 tablespoon of sugar. So the only reason I gave it this rating was because of the thickness, was hoping for a thinner sauce.

Just what I was looking for, didn't add the optional relish, but followed the recipe exactly otherwise, and these were great!

Very good! Being from Pittsburgh, I have the luxury of buying Isaly's Ham Barbecue Sauce, lol, so I've never made my own, but thought I would give it a shot today. This was super simple to throw together and I actually had everything on hand which made it extra awesome. My family really enjoyed this, and I will definately be using this recipe again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Excellent taste and very easy. I leave out the butter, go with extra vinegar for tanginess, and add cloves (~10 per lb). If in a hurry, can skip the mustard and Worcestershire.

Super!  I'm an inner-city Pittsburgher and I always LOVED these.  Definitely use HEINZ CHILI SAUCE.  Of course, Islays chipped ham is THE best, but other types will substitute. GOOOO STEELERS!   PS:  I live in Cowboy country now, and I still drape my windows with terrible towers!

Can you say “Good, Real Good?”  That is what my dad said twice during dinner tonight when I fixed these sandwiches.  He doesn’t come to dinner often, but I knew he would really enjoy tonight’s menu.
I live in Indiana, and tried 3 grocery delis to purchased chipped chopped ham.  None of them knew what I was talking about.  I knew Ohio, where my in-laws lived carried it in their stores.  So when I went to Ohio this past weekend, I came home with 3 lbs. of it.  All it is, is cooked ham that is shaved as thin as the deli’s slicer can go.  I know I could have gotten that in Indiana, now knowing what it is.  Well, I’m here to tell you, it makes a great sandwich.  I read the reviews about how much sauce the recipe makes.  I made it as written, but I let mine slowly simmer for about 30 minutes.  It had a nice thickness to the sauce when I added the ham.  The ham then slowly simmered for about 30 minutes while my potatoes,  ‘Jalapeno Potatoes’’ from AR baked.  I didn’t have Kaiser Rolls, but did have slider buns, so I toasted those and the sandwich was wonderful on them.  This recipe has been in my recipe box since February 2011.  I’m glad I found the meat and finally got around to making them.  My family thoroughly enjoyed them, and I know they will be made again.

Best ham barbeque ever!! I am originally from the Pittsburgh area and grew up with these sandwiches being served at every picnic and family get together. A few years ago I found that the stores here had begun selling Isaly's ham (the only ham to use for REAL ham barbeque). I should also add that I have bought Isaly's at about 4 stores up here and have only found ONE deli lady that can manage to cut it correctly-it has to be so thin you can see through it but not a pile of ham dust (which I got at one store). I decided to share a bit of my childhood with my wife so I bought some and made up a crock pot of barbeque and since then have made it a few times it has never been right. I think she was starting to think I was a little crazy talking about how good this stuff was supposed to be. Then we made this recipe a few days ago. This is perfect! We made it exactly as written and recommend changing nothing. The balance of sour and sweet and the thickness of the sauce were exactly what I remember. If you want real ham barbeque do yourself a favor-print this recipe out and get into your kitchen-you're wasting your time if you keep looking.

We liked this a lot.  I made the sauce exactly as described.  I used picnic ham, chopped up in a food processor, instead of chopped chipped ham.  I don't think I've ever had actual chipped ham, but I looked up how it's made, and the chopped picnic ham seemed like a reasonable substitute.  The rest of my family ate theirs on rolls, but I made mine gluten-free by eating it on lettuce leaves instead of a roll.  I think it would also make a great topping for baked or mashed potatoes, rice or pasta.

This was a great barbecue sandwich! Super tangy and a hint of sweet.I used mesquite smoked shaved ham for this. It turned out very saucy and needed a bit more ham to even it out. I cooked it and cooked it to see if I could reduce it some and get a better ratio plus I like a thicker sauce and this was thin. Good overall though and we'd eat it again.

Good but too goopy and sweet-never realized this was  Pgh favorite!! I lived in Pittsburgh for 43 years and loved Isaly's chipped ham--but we always made our barbeques by heating the ham with a little water and a squirt of Worcesterhire sauce--them piling it on a bun and adding pickle relish and a squirt of Heinz chili sauce..

I made this according to the recipe and it was a huge hit at my house! I was thinking about what to make for super bowl Sunday and realized I haven't had a ham barbecue sandwich in about 20 years. Unfortunately my mom passed away before I got her recipe but this was spot on! I'm glad I made it and it brought some happiness to our house watching a super bowl that the Steelers weren't in!

Made it just the way it was written...delicious! Even my picky child ate this awesome sandwich. Served with pirogies fried in butter and onions! I will make with 2 pounds of chipped ham and half the butter next time, but otherwise wouldn't change a thing!

Great ham qb.  Unless your from Pittsburgh area your not going to find or know what chipped ham is.  many people believe shaved is the same but it's not.  It doesn't matter it's still a great sandwich & I'm glad to see it listed here!  If you like barbque you will like this one!

Very good!  Closest to the recipe my mom used that I can find.  Just the right mix of hot, sweet & sour.  Would definitely like to try it with chili sauce next time.

I didn't expect much out of this recipe even with all the great reviews but this was delicious!  I cut the recipe to 4 servings and had some green onions to use up so I didn't use the regular chopped onion the recipe called for.  Both the hub and I enjoyed this.  I will definitely make it again.

My grandmother used to make these when we would visit. She would have them ready for us when we walked in the door. She gave me the recipe years ago, just before she passed away. Sadly, I lost the recipe shortly thereafter. I was thrilled when I found this recipe after a quick search and made them the next day and... it was like I walked into her Pittsburgh home on a Friday night after a 3.5 hour drive!!! And my kids and husband loved them as well. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!!

I made these with a few changes, and they came out great!  I used leftover spiral ham slices cut up into bite-sized pieces.  I also greatly reduced the amount of ketchup, since my husband is not a big fan of ketchup, and used spicy brown mustard instead of yellow mustard.

This was really good and easy to make - especially to a gal who hasn't been back to the 'burgh in a while! I had a left over bottle of Heinz chili sauce, so I used that up and added enough ketchup to equal the 2 cups. I also left out the mustard just because I don't like it. It was delicious!

These reminded me of the barbecued ham sandwiches my aunt used to make when I was a child (she is not from Pittsburgh).  My family liked these, although I thought they were a tad too sweet, so I would leave out the pickle relish next time.  Would definitely  make again!

Just as good as I remember.  I messed up and used 1/4 cup butter but it was still good. Only two of us in the house so we have plenty of leftovers. We enjoyed it!

I am from Pittsburgh and this was a game day staple at our house. We never added sweet relish to ours. I would think that would make it very sweet and runny. Also, as latchkey kids, we frequently made our own as an after school snack with chipped ham and bbq sauce heated through in a sauce pan and eaten on a hamburger bun! NEVER relish though!
