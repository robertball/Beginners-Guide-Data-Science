THIS RECIPE WAS ONE OF THE WORST I HAVE TRIED. THE AMOUNT OF TIME REQUIRED WAS TOTALLY WASTED. IT HAD NO TASTE WHATSOEVER!

Unlike Susannah I found this Texas hot sauce to be very good. It's a good thing because I made a triple batch. I froze it in several small freezer bags. Everybody in this house loves it.

I did this because I live in Texas and it sounded so weird it HAD to be good-- bread crumbs in hot dog chili? I'm game. In the end it was OK.... But I will probably not make it again. I used more of every seasoning than called for except the cinnamon (as everyone likes it spicy in my house) used kosher hot dogs (as Jewish weenies are the best weenies) and used spicy pork sausage instead of ground pork. Even so was a little bland and heavy on the tomato and cinnamon... And I don't get the bread crumbs at all. I used them but they just came out like soggy bread in chili (Which is what they are). Maybe that's because I make my own bread crumbs? So if you're thinking this is a weird but well-known regional thing it's not as far as I know. This isn't very hot at all so hot sauce is a bit of a misnomer. It was OK though-- the main reason I tried it was to make a big batch of something cheap and quick for my kids and their friends and they (being kids) loved it.

I decided on two changes before I ever started this recipe. Partly due to what I had on hand and partly due to personal preference. I did not add any hot dogs to the sauce. It didn't need it as I suspected that it wouldn't and I needed the 4 hot dogs I had left served as just that...hot dogs.. The other change was to cut way back on the cinnamon and that was only due to personal preference. A little bit of cinnamon goes a long way with us. I thought this was good and had lots of flavor and it is one I'd make again.
