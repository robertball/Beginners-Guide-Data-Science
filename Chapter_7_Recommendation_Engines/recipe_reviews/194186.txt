I like how easy and delicious this is, not to mention healthy.  I don't like thousand island or onions so I altered the recipe by mixing the salmon with light mayo and adding garlic salt.  I also used the 100 calorie Orowheat bread, toasted, with the spinach leaves.  I ate this yummy sandwich with veggie chips. So good!

I made this and really didn't like it. I think with mayo it would be good but the salmon with thousand island made it sweet and fishy which I didn't like. However my boyfriend loved his so I guess it's a matter of taste.

Super easy and a nice change from tuna salad. I like to add a few more onions.

We like this alot.  I use Fat free Thousand Island dressing and chopped plain onions.  I mix the salmon and the onions in my food processor and add enough dressing to let it all stick together.  Really tasty!!!

These were actually really good!  I used fresh leftover baked salmon, white bread (all I had), and made thousand island but spread it on the bread instead of mixing it with the salmon.  I'm sure other mayo spread of your choice would be fine.
