This "simple pesto pasta" can be made even more simple.  First, since there is already garlic in the pesto I saw no need to add more, let alone 3 T. for a half pound of pasta!  Second, I saved myself a pan to wash by just tossing the pasta with the pesto (I used homemade) and butter.  Simple.  This mix of pasta and pesto is a delicious, traditional classic - by all means add the pesto "to taste" and remember that less is more. (P.S.  Be sure to reserve some of your pasta cooking water to add to your finished pasta if it becomes dry as it stands.  If it stands long enough to do that :)

This was a wonderful side dish with chicken, but could easily be a main course. I didn't have fettuccine on hand, so I used wheat spaghetti. I did use about 1/2 the butter which worked out well. I used Basil Pecan Pesto by grettagirl.

Quick and easy way to use up pesto.  Served with a grilled chicken breast on top to make a simple pasta dinner.

I made the spinach almond pesto from the website and perhaps used more than the 1/2 cup given. Also, I topped my pasta with well sauted onions, corn and red bell pepper with salt and cider vinegar. Even the husband who cannot eat pasta went for seconds. I think this is a great base recipe.

I like recipes that are easy and good, and this surely is.  I added a couple tablespoons of fat free sour cream for creamy pesto sauce, and served with rotini pasta.  Thanks MOMof5.

Simple and Delicious. I used garlic butter for an even more garlic-y taste.

This recipe worked out very well, was delicious! I added a half teaspoon of granular garlic to the sauce, and a teaspoon of chicken bullion, after reading a review on being bland. This definitely picked up the flavor, was wonderful, went back for seconds!

Love this recipe!!! Very simple and easy!! Didn't have fettuccine on hand so I used twirls instead. Used homemade pesto from this site and stuck with the rest of the recipe and it came out perfectly. If I had to change anything, will definitely save the pasta water to help it be less dry (but I like it like that personally) this can pair with grilled Parmesan chicken  and salad really well!!

I was making for 2 so cut it in half, and didn't use butter, but 2 tablespoons of sour cream, and a smidge of olive oil. I also added a sliced artichoke for additional flavour. It was outstanding, in my very humble opinion. ;o)

I have been fortunate, so far we've liked most recipe selections. This was served as a side dish. Easy and tasty. Now if I can master less calories and not too expensive. This will be a favorite, can even make it for a pot luck dinner contribution.

I used a red pesto from a bottle.  I prepared homemade spaghetti.  The combination was great.  Given the time I spent on the spaghetti, I was very happy to find a simple sauce recipe.  My husband loved the smell and the taste.  I didn't even have to call him to come for dinner.

Can't beat simplicity, but I didn't think the butter was necessary because of the oil content in the pesto. I used homemade spaghetti, but followed the recipe otherwise.

Out of fear, I only added 1T of garlic, but it would have been ok with more.  Made my own pesto.

Easy and yum. I used Oprah's pesto recipe, and the rest was from TJ.
