Great recipe, especially after a minor change!  I turned this recipe into 'Double Chocolate Peppermint Brittle' by first making a layer of dark chocolate on the foil.  Once that was set up, I proceeded with this recipe, and spread it over the dark layer (an offset spatula works great here!).  When you break it, it looks quite similar to a candy that is sold by a national kitchen chain...and it's so much cheaper to make it at home!Thanks for a treat that everyone loves!

** Update ** Made this again, and have another tip!  Put the crushed peppermint into a strainer, and shake the finest particles into the white chocolate.  Then, reserve the bigger chunks to place on top of the white chocolate, for more texture, and professional appearance.  Wow!  Beautiful...just beautiful!

I modified this recipe to make what we call Peppermint Bark in my family.  I used about 1 pound of semi-sweet and 1 pound of white chocolate.  I melted the semi-sweet choc and spread it on as the bottom layer, then put it in the freezer to harden while I melted the white choc and crushed the mints.  I used 30 Starlight mints instead of candy canes.  I crushed half of the mints into a fine powder that I mixed into the melted white chocolate before spreading it as the top layer.  I crushed the other half of the mints more coarsely and sprinkled them over the top.  Tastes great!

I love this recipe but I had to work with it a few times to make it pretty.  I found it easier to melt the chocolate on the stove top in a small double boiler.  I only melted one pound of chocolate at a time.  I crushed 4 regular size candy canes and mixed them in the cocolate and then spread it on a cookie sheet lined with wax paper.  It works best if it is spread thin, not too thick.  Then I had one candy cane crushed to a fine powder that I sprinkled on top while it was still warm, this made them shimmer and look so much more appealing.  Then I chilled it in the fridge for about 30 minutes before breaking it up!

Great Recipe. Here's a suggestion. After crushing the peppermint candies, put them in a sieve. All of the peppermint "dust" gets stirred into the melted chocolate to flavor it. After it is poured into the pan, sprinkle the bigger pieces on top.
It looks really pretty!

I also like to drop a few spoons full of melted milk chocolate (or semi-sweet if you prefer)into the white chocolate after it is poured into the pan, them swirl it with a knife and and sprinkle pieces of peppermint on top. It looks like the Peppermint Bark that you buy in specialty shops!

so good, so easy.  however, one suggestion, put wax paper or parchment paper down in the pan before pouring it in.  it makes it SO much easier to break apart.

So easy!  I don't like white chocolate either, but love this candy!  I add a drop or two of peppermint extract to the melted chocolate and it gives it a subtle boost of mint flavor.  And I just sprinkle the candies on top (instead of stirring it into the chocolate) so the small crystals give it some sparkle.

This is just about the best (and fast) chocolate thingy I've ever made.  I just grabbed the half bag of chocolate chips I had and another bag of white ch. chips.   I followed another reviewers suggestion and used melted chocolate chips (and then stirred in some chopped almonds) as one layer and spread them in two tin foil pie pans and put those in the freezer while I melted the white chocolate in the micro. I then added some smashed peppermint candies, spread it on top of the dark chocolatre, which had set up and put it in the frig.  30 minutes later, it was ready.  When it's hard, cover it with something before you give it a good bang on the counter......dish towel, foil, whatever......otherwise, some pieces may jump out and into your mouth.  This is a wonderful year round recipe and the next time, I'll forget the peppermint and use chopped nuts or whatever.  Only caution I would give is if you're not familiar with chocolate, just melt it on half power in the micro until they appear to be melting....then see if you can mix them.  Don't overmelt.  They should still be holding their shape when they're ready to stir and spread.

I took someone's suggestion and layered 1# semi sweet chocolate and 1# white chocolate with the crushed candies on top, cooling between layers. I did run into a little problem when I began to brake the candies into pieces. The top layer separated from the bottom layer.  To remedy that, I simply put the entire cookie sheet into a 200* oven for a few minutes until I thought both layers were re-melted.  With out disturbing the layers, let cool.  This time when broken into bite size pieces, the layers remained together.  It looks professional and festive.  It is also tasty.  A nice addition to a holiday cookie tray or by itself in a special candy dish.

I like to make this recipe using 6 oz of white baking chocolate and 8 oz of semi-sweet baking chocolate. I tend to use the round peppermint candies, though I think candy canes would be easier to crush. Half of the crushed candy get mixed into each bowl of melted chocolate. Then the two are spooned onto waxed paper,  swirled with a knife and allowed to cool. Mixing the chocolates gives it a pretty appearance and is great for those who tend to like darker chocolates.

This is a tasty recipe that is great for the holidays, I always give tins full of cookies and other goodies for gifts to friends and family and this is a must have in them. When making it, make sure you don't pour it in to small of a dish or the pieces will be so thick that it will be  to hard to break apart. I recommend making them a little thinner then thick. About the thickness of a hershey bar.

This brittle WAS excellent. A little expensive to make, but worth it for special occasions. It is also very easy & quick, but the result does appear so. I made this in Oct to freeze for Christmas gift baskets, but have to make another batch as it's been nibbled away by the family.It freezes well by the way...:)

really great recipe, i made this for a cookie exchange and it was a big hit.  Instead of pouring the mixture into the jelly roll pan i used a mini ice cream scoop to pour it into mini muffin cups and saved a little of the crushed canes for the top it also works well wit milk chocolate or a combination of both.

Very easy and tasty.  I used Ghirardelli white chocolate chips.  They melted beautifuly and quickly in the microwave.  I prefer the taste of individual red and white mint candies to candy canes.  The individual candies seem to have greater flavor.  This is also a terrific recipe to make with kids.  They enjoy crunching up the hard candies!

Excellent recipe. I used the suggestions by others to first put a layer of semi-sweet chocolate then used the white chocolate (not a great fan of white chocolate--too sweet). The combo of the semi and white was perfect! One suggestion-I halved the recipe and when I went to smack the pan to break the brittle it didn't break so well. Maybe I should stick to the original recipe. P.S. My husband loved this and he hates white chocolate!

Super easy, super good.  If you like white chocolate, try this recipe.  I bought Ghirardelli white chocolate from Trader Joe's.  Much cheaper than the super market!

Adding melted chocolate by spoonfulls was an excellent idea! It turns out gtreat. For the baker who added extract and ruined her batch of candy, you can never add any flavor of extract to candy, there are however, special candy flavorings you can purchase almost any place (walmart) that made a big difference adding just 2 drops of candy flavoring!

Rather than crush the candy, I use a blender to crush (pulverize) it. Be carefull when you "blend" the candy, put only a few in the blender at a time.  Sometimes the candy can stick together (especially if you use the round peppermint candies instead of canes; 1 bag candy for 2 bags white morsels) and lock up the blender.  Lean the blender on it's side (hold onto the lid) and stand it up to feed the candy into the blades.  Also, peppermint candy dust is very sticky and gets everywhere so let the dust settle in the blender before you poor it into a bowl.

Crush the candy before you melt the chocolate.

The pulverized candy gives a more even/smooth peppermint flavor and melts in your mouth along with the white chocolate.

Yummmmm

My mother loves Fannie May Peppermint Bark, but there is no store here anymore, so I tried this for her.  We thought it tasted the same!  It is very yummy and very easy.  I added some red food coloring to make it pinkish like she was used to.  We can't stop eating it!

This was sooooo easy.  I was going to make chocolate dipped cand canes until I discovered they were all cracked.  I made mine a bit thicker by using a smaller cookie sheet and then sprinkling them with multi-colored sprinkles before they cooled.  These are fantastic teacher gifts!!!  Thanks again!  :-)

It is so important to use a high quality chocolate for this to come out.  "Nestle Chocolate" products do not work well with this recipe.  Ghirardelli works best.. Bakers works well, though.  After trial and error, I changed it up... dark on bottom, white on top.  Mixed one teaspoon Organic Peppermint extract in dark after it melted.  Topped dark with tiny pecan pieces and smaller chunks of candy canes.  Strained the candy cane dust and mixed it in the white.. then topped the white with the larger chuncks of candy cane... rave reviews.

I made it as other viewer suggested--melt semi sweet chocolate and pour it on the button of the pan first, chill for bit before pouring white chocolate/peppermint mixture on top of semi sweet chocolate and chill.  It was very good:)  I gave it as holiday treats to my neighbors and got good feedback~!

I had so much fun with this recipe.  I did a couple of different varieties and everyone loved them!  I think this would be really festive if the white chocolate had red and/or green food colouring added.  The candy canes that I find in the UK aren't as strong tasting as the ones I could get in the US.  I think I would add a tiny bit of peppermint flavouring just to pump up the flavour some.

The result that you get for so little effort is awesome with this recipe. I love this candy! You can also use "white almond bark" intead of the white chocolate. It is cheaper and a bit less rich.

This is a great recipe.  I make it now every Christmas as gifts for my family.  I added an extra touch that really makes it great.  Melt 2 pounds of semi-sweet chocolate as well and pour on top of the already chilled candy.  Chill for another hour.  Delicious!!!!!

I made this for teacher gifts.  I cut a 15"x15" square of colored cellophane and put the candy in the middle, bunched it all together, and tied curling ribbon around it.  It was a BIG hit!  Thanks for this recipe!

I normally make peppermint patties and I've done a huge huge batch this year. Decided to make this recipe but make them thick, because I had leftover candy canes and almond bark. It worked out with the leftovers I had and set up quickly. Peppermint anything is great in my house.

I've made this for years now. You can switch out your type of chocolate and type of hard candy for other flavor combos. The best tip you'll ever get about this kind of candy is: NEVER let water near your chocolate :) Even 1 drop--even 1 drop of food coloring--can and will ruin your chocolate!

I followed the advise of others and did a layer of dark chocolate on the bottom as well.  It was very yummy and will do it again. my only recommendation is not to let the dark cool too much because then when you break it the dark separates from the white, if it is still soft they will bond better together.  I fixed it by putting them in the  oven for about 7 minutes on a very low heat to gently remelt it together.

I ended up making this recipes with candy canes (I used 12 large candy canes)and they turned out delicious!  Very simple to make and they add nice color to your Christmas cookies.  You could use different flavored candy canes too for a different twist to this recipe.

We do this every year for christmas. The only change that I do, is that I put a thin layer of melted chocolate chips on the bottom of a jelly roll pan. Then I like to use the Ghiradelli white baking chocolate mixed with crushed candy canes, reserving a few to press into the top of my white chocolate/crushed candies mixture...Very good!! Is a duplicate of some I bought years ago at a specialty shop in Mall of America in Mnpls.

Super easy and delish! I would not recommend microwaving the chocolate though because you need to be constantly stirring it. I wasted my first batch because the chocolate completely hardened. I heated the chocolate directly over the stove stirring the ENTIRE time and it worked out perfectly!

I loved this recipe cause I'm not a fan of dark chocolate, so the white chocolate works great for me. I did as others suggested, I melted the white chocolate in a double boiler which made the chocolate nice and smooth. I also did as another suggested and used a flour sifter to place the broken candy cane which made it easy to use the dust pieces to flavor the chocolate and the larger pieces that stayed in the sifter I used at the end to make it nice and pretty.

Add a teaspoon (or more) of peppermint extract to this recipe. Also, it helps if you own a food processor to smash up those candy canes, as it creates a little powder along with those chunks of peppermint to stir into the chocolate, which likewise boosts the peppermint flavor some.

LOVE this stuff! Everyone has went crazy for it. I melted the chocolate in the microwave, which was easy. Next I added 1 tsp. peppermint extract to the chocolate to give it a bit more mint taste. I did incorporate the mint "dust" from the candy canes into the chocolate and then push the bigger bits into the top. I also added a few drops of red and green food coloring here and there and swirled them with a toothpick. Hubby said they looked like something out of a candy store and even though he isn't big on mint, he loved them.

This recipe was incredibly easy to make and the end product was DELICIOUS!  I crushed a couple extra candy canes and sprinkle over the top of the chocolate, once I had spread it out in the pan to give it a more finished appearance.  EXCELLENT!!!

This was very yummy and EASY, which is always appreciated around the hectic holidays.  I did find that microwaving the chocolate didn't work well and I needed to finish melting it over a simmering pot of hot water to get the smooth consistency.  Also, I think I crushed my candy canes too fine... next time I will do a little bigger chunks to my preference.

I used mixture of white chips (Nestle) and candy melts.  Tried adding layer of dark chocolate as others had suggested and didn't work for me - didn't meld together.  Used as part of Christmas goodies for co-workers and told by many it was very good.

After reading some of the great reviews, I decided to try it,   I started with melting semi sweet chocolate,  put in freezer, and then went and melted a package of the white chocolate. I poured on top of the chocolate, which was semi frozen, it turned out perfect because the white starting melting the chocolate, which made a really nice swirl mixed in with the peppermint candy,  delicious!!!

Absolutely delicious! I read a few of the top reviews and took the advice. I melted two packages of semi-sweet chocolate chips for the bottom layer. I also crushed my candycanes in a food processor - it was perfect. I sifted out the finest powder and mixed it in with the white chocolate, which I then spread overtop of the bottom layer. I took the bigger chunks from the food processor and sprinkled it overtop of the white chocolate. Perfect!

Surprisingly delicious! Based on other recommendations I did add a teaspoon of peppermint extract to the melted almond bark. Next time I will add crushed peppermint candies to the bark before letting it harden.  Also, when you add the crushed peppermint on top of the spread out bark you need to smush  it into the bark.  If not, it won't stick.  It didn't harden as well as I would have liked it to.  Next time I may add a bit of cornstrach to see if that will help.  All-in-all a great dessert!  I will make again!

I did the double layer thing with dark chocolate on the bottom (1 lb of each).  Sifted the small peppermint bits into the white chocolate and then the bigger chunks on top.   I would've liked to have had more peppermint flavor tho, so I may add peppermint extract to the white chocolate next time.  The only other thing was the two layers did want to seperate some.  But most stayed together.  I think the key is not letting the bottom layer set up all the way.  This may cause a little swirling of the two, but doesn't affect the taste!

Very good and easy to make. I used half white chic. and half semi-sweet choc. and 4 regular sized candy canes. Like the other reviewers I melted the dark choc. first, spread it in the pan and then I melthed the white choc., mixed it with the the candy canes and spread over the dark choc. One thing to note if you do this, the dark choc. takes longer to harden than the white choc.

I had some problems with this... actually, quite the disaster with melting the white chocolate. I went through 4 bags of it before I got it right. Yikes. So, for beginning bakers, be careful about overheating the white chocolate. Set your microwave at level 5 or 6 heat, and check on it every 10-15 seconds. When I got it right, I only nuked it for about a minute and 15 seconds (that was for one bag). It hardens really fast, so sprinkle the peppermint decorations as you're spreading it onto the sheet, or else they won't stick onto it. After 2 tries, I got it right and they turned out really cute. I just wish I knew more about melting white chocolate.

Did half dark choc. and half white choc but the dark choc was too overpowering.  Next time will do 1/4 dark and 3/4 white.  Crush candy canes with the plastic wrapper on so it stays in one place.

This was so PRETTY and very easy!   I took others' suggestion on two things:  1).  Use starlight mints (the round, individually wrapped peppermint candies).  They have more peppermint oil than candy canes, thus more peppermint flavor in your brittle.  2). Don't stir the candy into the white chocolate, it was prettier just sprinkled on top.   Thanks for this TERRIFIC simple recipe Brenda!

Oh wow, this was good!!  So easy too.  I used approx. 20 large candy canes, but it would have been easier to use the small ones.  My kids had fun pounding the candy canes with a mallet to crush them.  I used Trader Joe's white chocolate chips (a little over 3 bags).  I didn't want to scorch them in the microwave, so I melted them in a Pyrex bowl over a pan of simmering water.  The melted perfectly this way.  Very nice and smooth.  I mixed most of the crushed candy canes into the chocolate, and sprinkled some on top.  The brittle didn't break apart at first, we had to poke a butter knife into them and break them that way.  Still super easy though.  It's hard to stay out of them!  We're keeping it in the fridge because it melts easily.  We packaged most of it to give away, and kept a small amount for ourselves- it's half gone already!

Wow, this stuff is pretty good. I used 1 bag of Nestle white chocolate chips,and 1 bag of Premier Chocolatier white morsels, some crushed up starlight mints, and a few full size candy canes crushed up too. My family loved this. They do want me to do a layer of dark chocolate to spread this on top of. Good stuff though.

Very good, but very sweet!  The more you crush the peppermint sticks the more pink your brittle becomes.

This was great, but melted too easily.  If someone could PLEASE tell me how you cook with wax (heard it mentioned a few times in other candy recipes) I would greatly appreciate it.  I think that would make the difference in this recipe being good to it being great.

It doesn't get much easier than this!  Along with Oreo Cookie Bark, it's one of those things that can be made in a trice by anyone any age.  My kids made this as their annual edible gift at the last possible minute (evening Christmas Eve).  White chocolate melts in the mikey, candy canes in the food processor, and bang!  A done deal.  It looked very pretty, and tasted lovely.

This pretty candy is easy and delicious. It's a Christmas tradition at our house.  I make 1/2 of the recipe at a time, and spread it thinly on a foil-covered cookie sheet.  Once it hardens, simply break into small pieces.  Add a few drops of red food color to make a pretty pink!

We call it Peppermint Bark and I make it every Christmas.  I first spread a layer of dark chocolate in the pan-- chill it till it's firm, then add the white chocolate layer to which I've added crushed peppermint (canes or Starlight mints, crushed in a food processor)  While the white chocolate is still damp I sprinkle it with very finely crushed peppermints (peppermint dust) - chill again till very firm and break into pieces.  Yummy!  Thanks for sharing!

This brittle was okay.  The peppermint started to "sweat" after about a day or so...Since this was my first shot at peppermint brittle, I'm not sure if that's normal or not.  I just don't like sweaty food. LOL.  The first day it was good though...

yummy and fun to make! I used white choc./almond from Walmart and it was good. As another user recommended I also put about a TBSP of peppermint flavoring into the melted chocolate for added taste which turned out good. I let it dry on wax paper outside (about 32degrees) for about 10minutes and I was able to break it up immediately then.

I thought melting the chocolate in the microwave would work out like it did for some people especially since I followed the recipe, but the chocolate burned in the microwave.  I even did it in smaller intervals knowing that chocolate burns easily when melting.  I only noticed it burnt when I started mixing it.  I didn't even have it in the microwave for 6 minutes.  Next time I will use a double-boiler.  I was pretty bummed because I was really looking forward to this and I didn't have time to run out to buy more chocolate especially since it was late at night.

So easy.  I used both dark and whilte candy coating.  To get a layered look I layered the chocolate in a silicone muffin tin let it harden.  I then put the crushed candy canes in the white candy coating then layered that on top of the chocolate.  Sprinkle a little crushed candy cane on top and it was so pretty.

I have made this for years. I use wintergreen peppermints, but any type will work. I also use half almond bark and half white chocolate, this helps make the "brittle" brittle, it will break in large nice peices without all the tiny breaks, it will also hold up to heat better, it will not melt as soon as you touch it.  You can add food coloring, layer other flavors for chocolate and even add sprinkles if your heart desires.

I received good feedback on this treat but I thought it wasn't that great. I grew up making my peppermint brittle with a few drops of mint extract but couldn't find it in this country. If you can get your hands on that then put some drops in to give it a boost.

Good recipe as is... but I followed the suggestions of others to make it great. I melted 2 bags of dark chocolate chips and spread into a cookie sheet lined with parchment. I let that cool. Then I melted about 1 pound of white chocolate, adding 1 tablespoon of peppermint extract. I separated the fine peppermint particles from the larger pieces after I crushed it by using a sifter. I stirred the fine pieces into the white chocolate. I poored this over the dark chocolate and sprinkled the top with the larger pieces, pressing them into the chocolate with an off-set spatula. After it was completely cooled, breaking it apart was a little tough as I think it was a bit thick but it looked really pretty and tasted great! It looks impressive, too.

I grew up having this candy every Christmas, and decided that I'd continue the tradition with my family.  My husband loves white chocolate, so I knew he'd love it.  I used 12 large candy canes for the amount of white chocolate in the recipe.  It takes some work to get it all chopped up small, so I'd suggest crushing the peppermint before melting the chocolate.

Very good recipe! I used 1 1/2 packages of white almond bark and used 12 big candy canes instead of the little ones. My only problem was I stirred the candy canes in too much and it turned pink in some spots. There's a lot of peppermint flavor so I don't think there's a need to add any peppermint extract. I think I will make these for Christmas gifts! Thanks!

Yum! I was craving those peppermint Kisses that I can't find ANYWHERE anymore, so this was my best shot at getting rid of those cravings. I used one 11oz bag of ghiradelli white chocolate chips, 16 finely crushed mini candy canes (I crushed them in a clean coffee grinder! Worked marvelously.), and 3 thickly chopped candy canes on top. This way, the crushed candy canes mixed in melt in your mouth with the chocolate, but there's still a crunch from the topping. Try it! Spread them a little thinner and make a little more than you would feel comfortable with ;)

Very easy addition to a candy plate.  Try with lemon drops, too.  Watch the size of the candy chips to avoid a chipped tooth.

I added a layer of chocolate down first.  When I went to break it up the chocolate and the peppermint did not stick together. Bad if you are making it for a gift. Ok if you just set the pan out for a snack or at a informal party. The flavor was really good. I crushed the peppermint sticks in the food processor until it was a powder so no one would hurt their teeth.

I took ideas from the other reviews and did a thin layer of milk chocolate bark with a thicker layer of the white chocolate on top.  I picked out coarse candy cane pieces and saved them to sprinkle on top - turned out great, perhaps better than any other candy recipe we do each year!

I'm giving this 4 stars because I used this recipe as a base... I did a layer of dark chocolate. When I pounded my candy canes, some of the candy cane became a fine powder. So I sifted that out from the chunks and sprinkled it on the dark choco layer. Then I put it in the freezer while I melted the white choco. Once that melted I added 1/8 tsp of peppermint extrace then poured the white choco over the dark choco and then sprinkled the candy cane chunks. I froze it again for a couple hours. I melted the choco in my double boiler.
SO YUMMY!!!

Great recipe! I made it using white chocolate chips. Almost all the brands of white chips you find aren't actually white chocolate, which is why the labels say things like "white morsels". The real ones are hard to find. I also did as others suggested and only mixed in the smallest crushed candy cane pieces and pressed the rest into the top. The only problem with that was I ended up with a lot of pieces that weren't pressed in well enough and fell off. I think next time I'll either mix them all in or put a piece of wax paper on top so I can press the candy cane pieces in well without getting chocolate all over my fingers.

This recipe was sooo yummy. I added peppermint extract to the chocolate, and I also made some with dark chocolate. I recommend not putting it in the fridge or freezer when its hot, because it will get sticky on top. I will make this again!

This was EXCELLENT and SUPER EASY.  Very kid-friendly if you have little chefs in the house.  I used a mixture of green (spearmint) and red (peppermint) starlight mints crushed up.  And I used melted white chocolate chips b/c I couldn't find white bars. It's so festive-looking and really delicious!

Microwave disaster. I was using Nestle Premium White Morsels (another reviewer used morsels so I thought it would suffice) and they never melted.  Instead they emitted an awful "cooked milk" aroma and became a foul blob in the bowl. I was using 70% power as directed on the bag. No festive peppermint chips bark for my giftees.  At least I'm not out too much $.  either.  Sigh.

I just finished making my 6th batch of this peppermint bark. I used Ghirardelli bittersweet dark chocolate for the bottom layer, the white chocolate on top of that. And instead of using candy canes or the starlight mints, I used soft peppermint candies (I buy them by the tub at Sam's) that I smashed with a mallet. Sprinkled on top and lightly pushed into the white chocolate.

I used to buy the peppermint bark from Williams and Sonoma every year, but I really like this recipe much better!

This turned out great, but I found it to be a bit tricky when layering semi-sweet chocolate under the white chocolate. I kept getting a muddy mess as the heat from the white chocolate would start to melt the semi-sweet layer! What worked best for me was to increase the amount of semi-sweet chips to about a bag and a half, pop the cookie sheet in the fridge for about a half hour, and then dump the white chocolate (also increased to a bag and a half) on top of the semi-sweet layer in BATCHES. By applying the white chocolate a little at a time, it didnt allow the semi-sweet layer to warm up so fast. You still have to work quickly though. By increasing the amount of chips, I felt that this batch of bark was much sturdier than my previous batch where I used only one bag per chocolate layer.

I didn't have any peppermint oil so i used "Andies peppermint chips" instead. (You find them with the chocolate chips at the grocery store)It gave the white chocolate just enough mint flavor but it did turn it pink color.

This is so easy.  I added a bit of peppermint extract to enhance the flavor of the candy.  Next time I will buy large candy canes because unwrapping all those small candy canes was the most time-consuming part of making this treat.

I make this every year and wanted to send a little tid bit out to you all who will make this yummy treat. This year I tried to put a layer of dark chocolate ontop of the white. I let the bottom white layer cool and then did my layer of dark chocolate. After it cooled and I went to cut it, some of the top layer came off from the bottom. Not too much but it did seperate. I think next time I will put down the white layer and then let that sit and do my chocolate layer and swirl it together a little bit, that might make it stay together better.

Pretty good recipe.  It does need a little peppermint extract in the chocolate, so I added it in.  I also added another layer of regular chocolate chips to make it prettier.  I don't know about everyone else, but I'm not unwrapping 30 small candy canes.  I used about 10 regular sized ones.  Thanks for the recipe, Brenda!  I will make again for Christmas.

This recipe was super easy to make, and makes a nice gift to have on hand for unexpected guests.  I think it would be something fun to make with kids, too.  I'm giving it 4 stars because I didn't LOVE it, but almost everyone I gave it to as Christmas gifts did.  It's probably just because I'm not the biggest fan of white chocolate.  If you like white chocolate and peppermint you will love it.

Super easy.  I had 6 pounds of white baking chocolate in the cabinet for awhile now and was looking to use it up since no one in my family likes white chocolate.  I made one with the peppermint candy canes and another with the spearamint ones.  I tasted both and I think the peppermint one has better taste since the peppermint flavor seems to tone down the sweetness of the white chocolate.  I plan to give bags of the pieces away as Christmas gifts.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I tried melting the chocolate both ways - in microwave and on stove top in double broiler ... and unlike some other reviewers I most definitely found it EASIER and less messy to microwave the chocolate instead of doing it on stove top (get a dry glass bowl; break the chocolate into small chunks; one minute at 50 percent power; stir; then bursts of 10 seconds each at 50 percent power; stirring in between; until melted and smooth). 

Instead of lining my pan with foil I lined it with parchment ("greaseproof kitchen paper") and it came out of the pan perfectly after refrigerating for one hour. I then broke it apart by hand. 

To keep things simple I did not bother with double layer of milk chocolate and white, and did not swirl melted milk chocolate into the bark, and did not sift the crushed peppermint as some reviewers suggested. It looked and tasted AMAZING as is (and I don't usually prefer white chocolate). My family just loved it. However next time, just for the fun of it, I may try the double layer milk and white as suggested by some reviewers, or swirling.

Easy and yummy! Make sure to watch your chocolate in the microwave though! White chocolate burns really easily!

Tastes great and easy to make. I don't know how others can be critical of this recipe when the only ingredients are white chocolate and peppermint. If you want it to be thinner then spread the chocolate out. That's up to you as how you like it. I made mine with dark chocolate first and then white chocolate on top and then just sprinkled it with the peppermint.

Tons of compliments on this.  I did semi-sweet on bottom, white choc on top.  I waited for bottom layer to cool before adding the white on top but still the layers separated.  So, for 2nd batch, I used a tooth pick to swirl the bottom & top layers a bit -- it looked nice & also helped the layers stay together.  I recommend adding the dustier parts of the broken candy canes to the melted chocolatd.

The family loved this candy, and it looked festive on my holiday cookie trays.  I added a layer of semi-sweet milk chocolate morsels on the bottom mixed with a few drops of mint extract.  (1:1 ratio of semi-sweet chips to white chips)

This was pretty easy to make and was good.  I followed others advice and strained the broken mints.  I added the fine powder to the melted chocolates and put the larger pieces on top after it was spread in the pan.  They look great but it's not my favorite tasting candy.  But that's just a personal taste.

I followed the first review (Kitchen Kimberley) and put down a semi-sweet chocolate layer first, then the white chocolate peppermint layer. The offset spatula IS perfect for spreading -- a regular spatula just makes it messy. I whipped this up last-minute for a little get together and it came out perfectly. I did not add red coloring or crushed peppermint canes, it didn't need it. I love chocolate and peppermint! This is great!

Made this around Christmas time and forgot to rate it. I used Almond Bark instead of white chocolate. They came out great! I crushed some candy canes up very fine in my mini blender and poured most of it IN the Almond Bark before pouring it into my pan. This gave it a nice peppermint flavor throughout. Thanks for such a cool recipe!!

Pretty good!  After crunching up the candy canes, there's a fine powder left in the bag.  I dumped that into the melted almond bark.  It added a nice minty undertone to the whole piece of candy.  I love how festive it looks, too.

Used vanilla almond bark instead (cheaper and easier to find) and it worked out great.  Melted very easily in the microwave  with no problems.  I put the candy canes in  a freezer bag and crushed them with a meat tenderizer...did not feel that anyone would break a tooth as mentioned before!  As suggested, I sifted the smaller parts out and added that to the bark.  Easy for my girls to help with, and broke apart well for gift giving.  I will be keeping this recipe for the future!

This is SOOO good!  I bought some of the expensive peppermint bark from a place last year.  This tasted just as creamy and good if not better.  It's easy to make too.  I did use dark chocolate on a bottom layer then the white chocolate on top with the candy canes.  Perfect!  I'll definitely make this again.

These tasted great, but the peppermint candy melted and turned all of the white
chocolate PINK.  Not sure what I did wrong.

YUM! We made ours with a layer of dark chocolate on the bottom that had a little mint extract mixed in. We mixed in the broken peppermint pieces into the white chocolate and then topped it with more pieces. It was so easy and SO delicious!

I followed advice of others and added a bottom layer of dark chocolate, and sifted out the bigger pieces of candy for the top while mixing in the smaller pieces.  I also added a bit of green food color to a small amount of the white chocolate and drizzled it over the top.  I think this recipe was well balanced with the dark chocolate, and would have been overly sweet without it.

This turned out wonderful.  First of all don't microwave your chocolate.  Melt the chocolate in a double broiler.  It turns out better this way and easier to spread.  I crushed my candycanes in a chopper.  I used Bakers white chocolate and about 10 regular candy canes.  I put in 1/8 peppermint extract into the chocolate mixture.  I saved a little less than half of the crushed candy canes and topped it off on top of the spread chocolate.  This candy reminds me of Hershey's Candy Cane kisses and is the closest I can come to my craving of them.  Great recipe!!

I took the advice of other users and used the small pieces in the chocolate. It turned out to be hit on all my candy trays I give for Christmas.

I mistakenly made my first batch with only 1 pound of chocolate, but we ended up liking that better. The batch with 2 pounds of chocolate didn't have enough peppermint taste for us. I will definitely make this again using half the chocolate. It's super easy and yummy!

This went least of all my cookies and candy this year, but I loved it. The flavors blend so well and it's SOOOO easy!!  One suggestion:  when crushing the candy canes, save some larger pieces to scatter on top for appearance, but crush the rest finer, for mixing in.  I had some large pieces throughout, and didn't care for the effect.

Worked well, and the people who are receiving it as gifts are delighted.  I used two dozen (two boxes) of regular-sized candy candy canes, and three drops of peppermint oil (not extract!!).  As a dark chocolate junkie, I had to start with a layer of dark chocolate.  I let the dark layer slowly cool at room temperature, then popped it in the freezer while I worked on the white chocolate/peppermint layer.

I just tried this recipe, I plan to make it for gifts and wanted to test it. I loved the brittle, I can't stop eating it! I followed others' recommendations to adda drop or two of the peppermint extract to the white chocolate. I also   put a layer of semisweet chocolate on the bottom, sticking it into the freezer for about 30 sec before adding the white chocolate so that it wouldn't melt into the top layer right away, allowing me to spread the white chocolate on top, but preventing it from breaking away from the white chocolate after chilling the whole thing. I drizzled some of the semisweet on top afterward, as well. Great recipe!

This is an excellent recipe. I used cooking wax to thin out the chocolate. Everyone loved this recipe. I made enough to give everyone for Christmas as part of their box of treats!

I just made this recipe with my two sons (ages 6 and 3) and we had a blast.  It has just enough work (smashing the peppermints) to keep them happy, but not so much that it becomes overwhelming.  The result was delicious (confirmed by my husband, who is not big on peppermint).

When I make this I use the regular sized candy canes, which makes for a more peppermint flavor and more pieces in the brittle.  I also processed 4 candy canes in my mini food processor to fine crumbs and add with the others.  I use Wilton's candy melts when I make mine and melt over a double broiler.  Very good!!  Thanks for sharing Brenda!

Had I known this, one of my favorite Christmas treats, was so easy to make, I would have done it long ago!  I scaled the recipe in half due to not having 2 full pounds of white chocolate on hand.  Spread in a rectangular 7"x11" glass baking dish, but would probably have been better to use a 9"x13" to get a thinner brittle.  DeLISH though!  Thank you, Brenda!

I mixed 2 lbs white chocolate with 1lb semi-sweet.  I added peppermint extract to both chocolates and actual crushed peppermints also.  swirled the chocolates together, then topped with remaining peppermint.  Took to a party, it was a huge hit!

This was so easy to make and makes SO MUCH!  I read some reviews so I tweaked it a little bit by also adding super finely crushed candy cane powder to the top to make it shiny, then I drizzled melted milk chocolate over the top before refrigerating.  I will definitely keep this recipe handy for the holidays!

This was great!! A new addition to my hoilday treats. Very easy but does not make a lot so if you are planning on making this for a large group you may want to double up. I also made a seperate batch and added toasted almonds in lieu of peppermint and that was just as good if not better. I highly recommned this recipe to anyone who enjoys sweets.

What a great tasting candy and for so little trouble!  This may well become a Christmas tradition at our house.  If you follow another reviewer's suggestion and put bigger pieces of candy canes on top, make sure to press them into the white chocolate so they don't fall off when you break it up.

mmmm!! this stuff is sooo good and soo addicting.  don't mind that other reviewer who said to only give a little since it gets old.  i could have all of it if i really wanted to! unfortunately, i was making this to give away as christmas gifts and it was a hit!! everybody loved it. and my family wants me to make more now that there's none left since i gave it all away. i also used the peppermint candies instead and it turned out fantastic. so..i'll be making this again very very soon...

This recipe has everything the novice or short on time baker wants, perfect simplicity.  We used 21/2 bags white chocolate chips, melted in the microwave, and added the crushed candy canes to the bowl of chocolate.  I don't own a jelly roll pan, so lined a 13 x 9 casserole dish instead. Wonderful, thank you Brenda!

This tastes incredible!  I use the white and milk or dark chocolate.  Some batches I do single chocolates while others I layer and I also try to marble a batch or two.  I once bought solid red and green peppermint pieces from a candy making store.  They made the finished candy look great but, in my opinion, they weren't as good as the crushed up candy canes or discs and they cost quite a bit more.  Everyone thinks I took great effort to make this candy!  Ha!  What they don't know won't hurt them!  LOL  Wonderful for gift giving!  Great for the winter holidays but hey, treat yourself to this in the summer too!  The peppermint is soooo cooling!  :o)  Yum Yum!

These are so easy, relatively expensive, and make perfect gifts for friends and acquaintances. I gave some to my supervisors at work, and they absolutely loved them! I prefer using red/white peppermint candy cane rather than the green/red/white ones. Oddly enough, I could only find them at Walmart.

Wow!  I made this with a dark chocolate bottom and it is delicious!  I put together cookie tins with five different treats, and I'm expecting this will get the best reviews.  Can't wait - thanks for sharing!

As easy as it gets.  I split the recipe and made half all white chocolate and the second half with a dark chocolate layer on the bottom.  This makes perfect Christmas gifts.

This is a great christmas treat, you can also use lemon drops,  yum :)  To break up the candy canes I put it in a plastic bag and use a hammer, it works a lot better for me than the rolling pin

This was good... not great. I'm not a big fan of white chocolate, but this was still pretty good. I think there should be more peppermint though.

So easy a kid could do it and it looks fancy in gift baskets! Also is cheap to make! I layered white and milk chocolate like others suggested and then swirled the top a bit. If the pieces are too big they hurt your teeth so make sure to crush them good. I use the fine powder that's left over to sprinkle over the top for a sparkly finish!

We make this every Christmas.  I use about 12 big candy canes instead of the 30 small. I sometimes add about 5 more in bigger chunks pressed into the top before letting it set.  Thanks for sharing this gem.

This is pretty good! The only change I made was I melted 1 bag of white morsels and 1/2 bag of Andes Candies Peppermint crunch w/ 1 tsp shortening. Then added 15 crushed peppermints, should've added a few more. This does turn pink. After spreading on the baking sheet, I added red and green sprinkles.

Soooo easy and soooo yummy!  I melted my chips in the microwave and then spread it on parchment paper on top of a cookie sheet (I don't know what a jelly roll looks like...lol).  I bought the "soft" candy canes by accident, man those were hard to break apart!  Next time I'll use regular canes.  We enjoy this VERY much!!  Thanks!!

Had a real hard time with this.....used the Ghiradelli chips (3 bags), microwaved it for 3 minutes....took it out, stirred, microwaved for 1 minute and it came out hard as a rock. We had to go to the dbl.boiler method to get the chocolate to melt....very frustrating

This makes a nice host/hostess gift in a pretty tin.  Also looks nice if you include nut brittle in the tin, too.

I made several batches for Christmas and it was a hit!  So easy to make and looks professional.  I used white and dark chocolate.  I will make this year after year.

HELP!  I have tried this recipe twice now and the layers of chocolate separate when broken.  I am using high quality chocolate.  The first time I assumed the layers separated because the dark layer was too cold.  This time I Added the white layer before the bottom layer was hardened...same result.  I am a puzzled experienced cook.  I desperately want this delightful treat to tste good and look beautiful.  Any tips??

This was a hit as a stocking stuffer!  Instead of buying a bar of white chocolate, I used the morsels and melted them according to the package directions.  It did turn out a bit sweet for me, but I'm not a huge white chocolate fan.  Next time, I will take the suggestion from others and add some semi sweet chocolate to the mix.

Delicious!  I'll never buy peppermint bark again.  I did as another reviewer suggested and strained out the big chunks of peppermint to put on top and mixed the powdery peppermint in with the white chocolate.  This would make a great hostess gift in a nice tin for Xmas.

It was okay...but I think I used a wrong ingredient. I used white chips (they didn't say white chocolate chips), so it may have been better if I used a different chocolate.

Very pretty, but not a whole lot of flavor.  I tried to add some peppermint extract but the white chocolate turned to a weird texture, almost like a curdle.

Added semi-sweet chocolate at the bottom as others suggested.  Melting the white chocolate was the hardest part - since it burned very easily.

I spread this thin between 2 standard cookie sheets. It is very good! The creamy-ness of the white chocolate goes so well with the peppermint. Melt in your mouth delicious! This will be added to our many Christmas goodies! Who would of thought that this would be so easy?

I just made my first experimental batch. I like it and I will do it again for my cookie exchange (I am a terrible baker and this is pretty easy--perfect!)but I don't like the feeling of biting into hard candy and my pieces were much too big at 1/3 inch or smaller. Next time I will either use soft peppermints, peppermint extract or grind up the pieces in my food processor. 

UPDATE: second time around I used my food processor to grind up candy canes and added the very fine pieces to the melted chocolate. This gave it a nice texture without big chunks of hard candy. I also added a little extract to the melted chocolate for a more consistent peppermint flavor. Lastly, I pressed in some Andes peppermint pieces to the top. It was the first time I used them and they are soft a soft candy in the baking aisle. They are attractive on the top. Don't make the same mistake I did the first time and try to melt them unless you want pink bark!

Fantastic and oh so easy.  I used the Hersey's milk chocolate bars on the bottom with chunks of the peppermint and also - as others suggested - strained the peppermint in a colander (sp) and mixed the powder in with the white chocolate and used the larger bits to top it.  It is beautiful and very tasty.  Thanks for such a great recipe.

I made this for a work function and everyone absolutely loved it... People thought I had bought it! I altered the recipe just slightly - this recipe is definitely one you can play by ear. I put a thin layer of semi-sweet chocolate down first and let it harden before spreading the white chocolate/peppermint mixture. I did seive the crushed peppermints so only the finest grains were in the white chocolate layer, then pressed larger pieces into the top. It's delicious, pretty and so easy!

This was horrible.  it didn't get hard enough, probably because whute chocolate is naturally pretty soft, even after i put it in the fridge.  it melted all over everything and was so sweet it gave me a headache.  I even spent the extra money on ghiradelli white chocolate and it was this bad.  do no make this unless you LOVE white chocolate.  it might have worked with a semi-sweet...

This is very good! I made one batch exactly by the recipe. Then I made a second batch except before I sprinkled some of the candy cane bits on top, I melted about a good handfull of semi-sweet chocolate chips and drizzled on the top. Then I took a toothpick and kind of swirled it in. That was very good as well. I will be keeping this recipe for future use. Thank you!!!

This was my base, but I modified it slightly. I love the Williams & Sonoma peppermint bark, so I did half semi-sweet choc chips and half white choc chips. Yummy! I recommend that you break the pieces up, so they are small. Everyone that ate it said they the little bits and the big pieces were the last to go, who would have thought that!

These are wonderful!!!  I made these twice.  The first time, as written, they were wonderful.  The second time I put down a layer of melted semi-sweet chocolate chips and topped with the white chocolate/peppermint mix.  I prefer without the dark chocolate, but others liked it.  It does seem to work best to save some larger pieces of candy cane to press into the top of the white chocolate to make it prettier.

I give it four stars only because of the microwaving piece.  I used two bags of toll house white chocolate morsels.  The chocolate was just so hard to manipulate when cooked in the microwave versus being smooth and easy to work with out of the double boiler.  I like my peppermint bark to be thin and crispy...I just couldn't get the consistency to make that happen out of the microwave.  So, essentially, great recipe but I recommend using a double boiler to melt the chocolate.

I didn't review the reviews ahead of time so I bought the cheap vanilla buttons and mini candy canes. I didn't have any peppermint extract.  I wouldn't change a thing!! Deserves 10 stars as is.

I would give this 10 stars if I could.  Make sure you use good white chocolate...the white choc chips aren't as good as the wafers.  Fabulous and easy!  *Update* This is my 2nd xmas making these...I used Cherry flavored candy canes for something different and I've been asked for the recipe a few times now.  I use the tip of sifting out the finer crushed canes and mixing into the chocolate and scattering the bigger pieces onto the top and it looks really pretty.

I modified the recipe to use 1 lb dark chocolate for bottom layer.  The top layer I used 12 oz white chocolate and 4 oz peppermint baking chips.  I crushed 6oz of 'soft' peppermint sticks.  I stirred in the smaller pieces into the white chocolate, poured this mixtured over the dark chocolate layer.  I sprinkled the remaining peppermint pieces over the top layer.  I melted 2 oz of white chocolate and drizzled it over the hardened candy.  
I brought this in for a christmas party at work, nobody believed me when I said I made it myself.  They thought it looked like something from a candy shop.  Very festive looking.

I made a lot of friends at work with this!  I would use more candy canes next time for flavor, and keep in mind that it's nice to have bigger chunks to give it texture.  I also melted some semi-sweet chocolate and drizzled it over top - a beautiful and tasty touch!  Also, a friend who made it later sprinkled some smaller bits of candy cane over the top for looks.

Tasty, of course.  I used red and green candy canes...it adds a little more color.  The better quality chocolate you use, the better this stuff turns out.  I was bought cheapo no-brand white choc. chips and it was still good, but not as good as it could have been.

You know, I'm not crazy about white chocolate, find it too sweet. Not mad about candy canes either.  Then a friend turned me on to this stuff last Christmas and I couldn't stop eating it!  Everybody got a little bag last year and, if we don't eat it all ourselves, will again this.  Pretty, and pretty easy!

This turned out perfect!  I split the batch in half and made 1/2 peppermint and 1/2 almond.  I used white Ghiradelli melting chocolate.

Looks pretty- but the flovor combination is not good- It is like eating toothpaste with your chocolate bar. Maybe it is just a preferred taste....

I followed this recipe exactly, except I used a large cookie sheet to spread the chocolate on.  Everyone really liked this, but I would add a little peppermint extract to boost the flavor a little.  Great recipe!

This is my kind of recipe--2 ingredients and instructions to slam it on a counter!  I chopped round candies in a food processor and used a double boiler to melt the white chocolate.  The mix looked like cottage cheese!  Everyone loved the brittle.

This was so easy to make - and turned out great.  When I tried to be creative by adding and swirling semi-sweet chocolate in, it was not as good.  I will stick to the recipe - simple and delicious.

people seem to like the pieces a little smaller so I bought peppermint disks and chopped them up in the blender. It's not as pretty, but it's a lot easier to eat!

WHAT A COMBINATION!!! Just so perfect and so easy!!  All I did different was grind the candies in a blender and added it to the melted chocolate.  The kids took a plate upstairs and it disappeared!!!  THANK YOU for the wonderful recipe!!

This was the easiest thing I ever made! With all the delicious fudge I made for Christmas, I never expected all the raves I got for this candy!! After I spread the mixture out to cool I pressed mini candy canes on the top about 2 inches apart and when it was hardened I cut out squares so there was a cane on each piece.

Forgot to take a picture as I’m new to this app, but this was a wonderfully delicious easy desert to make for any party.  Only slight change I made was I added bigger crushed peppermint pieces to the white chocolate after it had been spread on the baking pan for more texture

Someone made similar brittle/barks at a party and I really loved it so tried this recipe. I'm not sure what's different but I didn't care about this as much. Maybe different brand of chocolate or candy?  I can't pin point exactly what but I guess I have to experiment with different brands of candies or try different recipes which call for peppermint extract or something.  It was super easy to make and since it was very cold outside, I just left the pan out for 10-15 min and it was done.  My husband liked it very much and said it's his new favorite.

I made this last weekend and it was a hit. My only change would be that next time, I will use my glass double-boiler. I used a metal one that I had and the white chocolate tended to clump a bit. I will also use a smaller sheet. I poured the chocolate onto the peppermint pieces but it did not "spread" well. Can anyone give any tips to make the melted chocolate more "creamy?" I will definite make this again, if only to prove to myself I can :)

I followed some others advice and made the white chocolate layer as suggested but poured it on top of a dark chocolate layer to make it more like the famous one.  Very easy and delicious!
Second year - only made with white chocolate I purchased at a confectionery - better chocolate. I would have liked more candy cane. Next year I will put the 30 in to the chocolate, but put some more sprinkled on top for a better visual.

This recipe was delicious and easy! I would recommend melting the chocolate in a saucepan, though, because it is much easier to stir and prevent the chocolate from burning. It was also delicious to crush some of the candy canes to a powder, because it adds flavor to the chocolate without as much crunch. Make sure you lay wax paper on the pan before you pour the chocolate, or it will be very hard to break apart. Delicious recipe and I would eat this every day if I could.

I added chocolate first melt the bag of white choc chips add wax or shortening, whichever u like. Spread melted bits on wax paper. Next melt choc fudge chips again add  wax or shortening. Spread on top of white choc. 
Open bag of crushed peppermint pieces use hand to distribute & use back of wooden spoon or tbsp to gently press into choc.. once harden simple break up, put n sm bags with other candies u have made tie holiday ribbon & give along with other gifts or as a stand-alone gift.
Or keep & enjoy  LOL

Easiest candy ever! I used a combo of white chocolate & almond bark. I took the advice of other reviewers & used the bigger pieces on top & mixed the "dust" into the melted white chocolate. I'd like to try it with a semi-sweet layer as others did. Makes a very nice gift any day of the year but especially at Christmas.

great taste, and very easy - what could be better?  i put a layer of milk chocolate on the bottom (on foil) and cooled it completely...then added the white chocolate.  the two layers didnt stick together very well, so maybe dont cool the chocolate layer completely.  i did as another reviewer suggested, and strained the peppermint pieces into the white chocolate, then added the chunkier pieces to the top.  very festive!

Delicious!  Tastes more complicated than the ingredients indicate.  My teenage daughter made these by herself -- no problem.  She did add the extra layer of dark chocolate as suggested by an earlier post -- Perfect!  Ate them in a flash.

Very easy and pretty for the holidays.  I sifted the powder fron the chunks and the small chunks from the large chunks.  I mixed the small chunks in the white chocolate and topped with the large.  I also took the suggestion of doing a dark chocolate layer under the white.  Very pretty.

This is a hit!  I modify by using equal amounts of mint dark chocolate and white chocolate, using the melting wafers avail at the candy store.  The  mint dark chocolate wafers add a little extra flavor w/out needing to use any extract.

The first time I decided to make these, I left the chocolate in the microwave and it over cooked.  The second try I watched it carefully and took it out when it was just melted. The end result was pretty good. Nothing too special, and probably wont make it again

This was good. It was quite easy. I am not much of a peppermint fan, so with that said that is why I gave it 4 stars. I am sure if I liked peppermint more than this recipe would be 5 stars. I thought it was a great recipe though because I did like it, it was very easy, and I took it to a family reunion and others liked it. I would make this again because it is so easy. Thanks for the recipe.

This was okay. I did what others suggested and used a layer of chocolate under the white chocolate, and used shavings of peppermint for flavor, but could have used more.

Very good and very easy.  Took the suggestion of others and added a layer of chocolate on the bottom.  Someone said it was like something they serve at Olive Garden.  I don't know what they are referring to but that may mean something to others.  Thanks for sharing.

This has to be the easist recipe EVER! I put a layer of white chocolate down--then crushed peppermint--then a layer of milk chocolate down--and then more peppermint on top--it had JUST enough peppermint flavor! GREAT!

I made this as Christmas gifts this year. Breaking the candy can get difficult, so I put it into a ziplock bag and grabbed a big knife and used the duller side of it and just hit them repeatedly. Worked well!

First of all, this should be called peppermint bark, not brittle. Because it is not brittle. However, it is still very good and the whole family loved it. Crushing the candy canes with a rolling pin is not as easy as it sounds. And don't do it on your kitchen table and scratch it all up like I did! I had such a hard time, I ended up wrapping the bag of candy canes up in a bunch of paper towels, putting them on the floor and stomping on them with my shoes on! Silly, huh? Well it worked!

Flavor-wise this is excellent. I added a touch of peppermint extract to it. But mine has to stay refridgerated to stay hard, otherwise it just becomes gooey.

Very good.  As others mentioned, I swirled with semi-sweet chocolate and it was great.  Took to a dinner and it was loved by kids and adults alike.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Everything turned out wonderfully. I also used Nestle Premium White Morsels and followed the directions on the recipe, not the bag, melting them on medium power. I will be delivering gifts to friends and family tonight with peppermint brittle included and I can't wait to share!

this is a great one...i make it with a slight variation...by adding a few drops of peppermint oil/extract (can find it at the grocery store in near vanilla extract) to the melted chocolate before adding the candy canes to it. adds just a bit more hint of the flavorful peppermint!!!

I intended to make a thinner layer of dark chocolate on the bottom and then use the white chocolate on top with the mints, however, I burned the white chocolate badly and ended up throwing it out.  Rather than waste it all, I simply made a dark chocolate peppermint bark and it was wonderful! 
I will try the white chocolate again, but the dark chocolate alone is still really good.

I have made similar recipes before. It's so simple and versatile. I drizzled a little dark chocolate on top and next time I will add peppermint oil to the chocolate too.

I made this last year for the kids in my family, and they loved it so much they were fighting over it.  The white chocolate flavor is a bit strong, but perhaps could be corrected by adding a small amount of peppermint extract to the mixture.

I have been making this recipe during the Holiday season for years!  I call it "Holiday Cheer" and once you taste it, you'll understand why!  It goes perfect with a cup of home-made cocoa.

We thought this was pretty good.  It needs quite a bit more peppermint; I will use more canes and/or some peppermint extract next time.  This time, I used green and red canes; the color combination was great.

Not only is this fun to make but it is delicious too.  I used candy canes and probably crushed them to small, will use candies instead.
