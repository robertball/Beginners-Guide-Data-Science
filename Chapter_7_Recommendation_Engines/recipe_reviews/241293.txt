I am only rating the sauce part of this recipe. I needed a strawberry sauce recipe for a cheese cake and only had a 16oz bag of frozen strawberries so I did a search for frozen strawberries and this is the recipe that came up. I thawed the berries overnight in a colander set over a bowl and in the morning I only had 1/2 cup of drained liquid. Because my bag was 16oz I had to add 50 percent more to the rest of the recipe. So I added a cup of water and worried that the strawberry flavor would be diluted too much, but I needn't have worried because the sauce was full of strawberry flavor. I needed to cook it much longer, on medium heat as specified, to get the liquid clear and thick- about 10 minutes. Then I added the strawberries (which I had cut in half because they were pretty big) and cooked an additional 10 minutes until it reached the consistency I wanted. It was a very pretty red color. Both my mother and I tasted it and found it quite sweet, so if I try this recipe again I will try cutting the sugar down, and/or replacing some of it with honey, which is in my favorite blueberry sauce. We definitely tasted more sugar than berries. I think some fresh chopped strawberries (as the submitter mentioned) would improve the sauce quite a bit. Perhaps also a touch of orange peel or replacing a small amount of the liquid with orange juice would be a nice addition. Finally, I left the almonds out of the sauce, but think they could be nice sprinkled on top.*** This also looks beautif
