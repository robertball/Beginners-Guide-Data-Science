I was missing the tomatoes but otherwise made the recipe as written.  Delicious.  I was surprised to find this tasted very similar to the dipping sauce the now-closed Thai restaurant by my parents house use to serve with their satay (with more sauce and less veggies).  I can't wait to share the recipe with them!

Very authentic! I modified it for my taste; used 1/4 cup sugar, increased the vinegar, 2 tbsp of fish sauce, thinly sliced jalapenos, and basil. Very good!

I used 3 regular sized cucumbers and it still made a large bowl. I might swap the cilantro for parsley next time since we aren't big cilantro fans. I wanted to make it as written the first time. I would add more nuts too because it gave it a great unexpected cruch. Perfect amount of spice.

Perfect beginning to a Thai meal. Sooo refreshing. And the chopped peanuts add just the right crunch. Thoroughly enjoyed this!

Really great recipe and really easy! I just threw everything together and let it sit for about 30 minutes before dinner. I made it mostly because I didn't have all the fancy schmancy stuff in other similar recipes, and would make it again even if I did have that other stuff. We didn't even use the peanuts or mint, and thought is was really yummy! Thanks!

I changed the equal amounts of vinegar and sugar to 1/2 c. vinegar and 1/4 c. sugar. I like more tang then sweet. I followed everything else, except I didn't have mint or peanuts. This was excellent. I will make again.

A good choice for school projects. Flavors are different but not scary. Easy for kids to make.  Perfect blend of seasonings, try this recipe exactly as written.

Had high hopes but this was just average.  Made exactly as stated but used splenda to cut calories.  Very healthy salad and it did have good flavor- really didn't need the peanuts.  The Thai Cucumber salad from this site is similar and much better.

Delicious!! Followed everything exactly as written besides the sugar. I only added about half the amount and thought that it was perfect, but I suppose that is a matter of taste. Great recipe overall.

I used cider vinegar and a dash of sesame oil. I was surprised that cilantro and mint do so well together.

Amazing! I used 2 medium cucumbers, substituted a yellow onion, one serrano pepper, added 1/2 a sweet orange pepper, 1/2 cup of fresh chopped cilantro, and 2 T sugar. Absolutely incredible flavor that became more and more delicious each day. My only warning: if you don't like the taste of rice vinegar or ginger, stay far away from this recipe.

My husband enjoyed this spin on a cucumber salad we enjoy.  The mint and the hint of spice with red pepper were a great combo.

I think next time I'll omit the cilantro as it was strong and seemed to distract from the other flavors.  Liked the mint in it, though. I had a similar dish in a Thai restaraunt and it contained shredded carrot which gave it some extra color. I used 3 cukes in this.

This was great, I had plenty of cucumbers,tomatoes, and red onion fresh  from my garden so I tried this recipe.  I did substitute red wine vinegar for the white distilled (I didn't have white distilled).  Next time I think I may try a tablespoon or two of fish sauce also.

I followed the recipe exactly except used tomatoes from my garden instead of Roma.  This is, without question, my favorite cucumber recipe of all time.  Surprisingly, it is still good after 3 days.   It says it is 4 servings.  I would say more like 6 generous servings.

Great way to use up cucumbers.  I can't imagine reducing the crushed red pepper...wouldn't taste like anything.  I only needed to add more salt. Good recipe.

Perfect! The mint and the cilantro added some really nice flavors and the peanuts gave it a great crunch. A great salad for the summer. Used 2 cucumbers instead of 2 lbs of cucumbers, worked just fine. Great recipe thanks!

Amazing! Although the recipe makes way too much food to be used as a side dish. 2lbs equaled about 8 large cucumbers for me. even in my family of my father, husband & two teenage boys who loved it couldnt finish it after two nights. will cut in half next time.

This was so good, perhaps our favorite cucumber salad yet. The red pepper flakes add an unexpected zing. I used toasted cashews instead of peanuts as I didn’t have those; other than slightly over-toasting them (oops) they were a good substitute. Everything else was per the recipe, and I don’t think I’d make any adjustments the next time I make it.

I was very skeptical about this salad, but since I had all the fresh ingredients in my garden, I decided to make it. Everyone loved it!  I found it to be super easy and perfect for a hot summer evening book club discussion. I would definitely make it againl

Very good and easy.  I made it exactly as written except I substituted cherry tomatoes for the Romas.  I'll definitely be adding this to my rotation of cucumber salads!

I used Stevia instead of the sugar for the dieters in my house, but other than that, made it as directed.

My mother-in-law loves this.  It's a bit sweet for me, and I feel that it needs a touch of fish sauce or soy sauce, which I'll add when I make this again.

Great salad, so refreshing! Made it with my sister who doesn't like cilantro, so we left that out. Substituted the peanuts with cashews as well. Will definitely be making this salad again and again.

I love this salad. It's a perfect sweet/sour compliment to ribs or chicken on the grill. I made the recipe as is; didn't change a thing! Yum!!

This is one of my favorite recipes from this site. I've made a few changes. Less sugar to taste. Rice wine vinegar instead of white. Multi colored cherry tomatoes halved. More red onion and cilantro.  It is of course personal taste but every woman that has tasted this has asked for the recipe and the guys alway want it to be made again. Great healthy food. Yum!

This was a delicious base for me. I omitted the mint and nuts as I didn't have any on hand and made following adjustments to suit my tastes: adjusted for one serving, used more vinegar (rice) than sugar, used sriracha instead of pepper flakes, and added a little fish sauce. Served with ginger salmon so I tossed in a bag of salad mix for a refreshing salad. Will make again, thank you!  May use the dressing for a cold noodle salad dressing as well!

Use rice vinegar rather than the white stuff - flavor is more complex as well as more subtle.  Instead of coriander, use cumin for a deeper tone and a bit of heat.  Walla Walla onions make for a more gentle flavor than red onions.  1/3 cup is too much sugar.  Sweet mirin is a better choice for a delicate asian flavor.

This salad is so tasty, easy and refreshing!  It will become one of my summer staples! 
I didn't make it with the tomatoes but used everything else and it was delicious!  Thanks for sharing it!

This was a big hit, even with picky eaters.  I didn't have mint, but didn't miss it.  Actually chopped the cilantro and added it to the dressing.  Put cubes, cut tomatoes and onion in colander for an hour and redrained it.  Awesome and will make many more times.

My husband made this for dinner tonight.  He used rice wine vinegar and it was fabulous!  He made it with scallops with tropical salsa and I thought I died and went to heaven.  It may have been the best meal of my life.  Fabulous!

This is a great summer recipe.   The only change I made was to add a little more red pepper flakes to give it just a little more kick.   I'm participating in a tasting bee with an Asian theme this fall.   This may be my recipe (unless I find something else I like better in the next couple of weeks).

This recipe was SO good! The only things I changed was using Apple cider vinager instead of regular and a fresh spanish chili instead of chili flakes. Absolutely fantastic! Next time we'll use 3 cucumbers and a bit more veggies, it was a lot of leftover liquid. Thanks alot!

This was nice and refreshing! I subbed shallot for onion (I prefer the milder flavor), raw cashews for peanuts, and agave for sugar. The mint is a must--it adds that extra bit of flavor. This went beautifully with Pad Thai.

Very good..big hit.  did not have peanuts, so added 1/2  teaspoon of peanut butter to the vinegar dressing and then tossed it with the cucumbers/onions/tomatoes.  Made this as an accompaniment to Thai yellow curry, vege stir fry, tom yum soup and rice.

This was great. I subbed agave nectar for the sugar, and added a diced jalapeno. Everyone really loved this dish.
