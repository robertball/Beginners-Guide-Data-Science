i basically cut the recipe in half-- as cauliflower is $5.00 per head- i bought a 16 oz. bag of frozen @ .99-- boiled for 6 minutes- and drained while chopping celery, onion and pickles--mixed everything together- sprinkled with paprika-- was pretty and tasted just like my "tater salad"--other than chilling- it took less than 30 minutes-- love this-served with ham slices and asparagus-- a great dinner and great on the budget-- Thanks a bunch, Bibi-- another great recipe!!( i almost forgot, i did not add bacon, as i do not eat it- still perfect!)

Excellent recipe for a mock potato salad! I just steamed the cut cauliflower in a steam basket, but otherwise made it exactly as written. The flavors just keep combining, which makes this recipe wonderful as a make ahead option. We really loved the addition of bacon in the salad too. Placing the cauliflower in the freezer is ingenious as well especially if you need to serve it with your meal day of/right away. If  you like dill in potato salads, just add a little dried dill or your favorite dill blend. As written, you won't be disappointed though as it definitely hits the spot and is so delicious. Heck, this recipe is our new favorite for a mock potato salad! Thank you for sharing the recipe!

This is a real keeper!  It is so good and it really does taste exactly like potato salad.  I’ve made this twice and the amounts are perfect.  I use sweet pickle relish as per the cook’s notes.  At my hubby’s request, I doubled the amount of hard boiled eggs because he likes a lot of eggs in his potato salad.

I loved it!  I roasted the cauliflower and it tasted great.  I skipped the sweet pickles.  This recipe reminded me more of my mother's potato salad.  I added an extra egg.
