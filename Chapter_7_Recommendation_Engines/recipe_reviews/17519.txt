I made two pies for our Boy Scout Troop Steam Threshers reunion (1 of 2 major fund raisers for the troop) and they sold within an hour of opening.  It was sold by the slice.  The people wanted more.  Next year I might take 6 pies instead of 2.  Thank You very much for this wonderful recipe.

i made my own crust, which screwed up terribly. i loved how the filling came out - my parents and friend didn't like it though, most likely because they don't like pumpkins. baking time was just right. thanks for the recipe!

I tried the recipe and followed it exactly. THe result was just ok, maybe I messed up, although it isn't a complicated recipe!
