I just finished cooking this. It turned out absolutely delicious. I used regular shrimp though. Cut the tails off of course. I added more garlic, about 4 cloves. I used more Prego sauce than the recipe asked for...about 2 cups. Roasted Garlic Parmesan sauce. I'll serve this with whole wheat spaghetti. Try it guys. You won't regret it. Can't wait for my husband to get home and have dinner before I finish it all by myself :) It's THAT good.

This was SO good!  I served this over pasta with garlic bread.  It was so easy and it tasted like I spent hours in the kitchen.  I used a 1/2 tsp of red pepper and omitted the parsley completely.  I loved the balance of sweet from the sauce and spicy from the red pepper.  It's a nice twist to the regular meatballs.  Awesome!

This was absolutely delicious. It was a wonderful combination of tang and spice and the shrimp just added the extra zing to the recipe. Of course after I was done cooking this I added it over freshly made spaghetti, al dente style, and it was perfect. Although next time I would just use 1/2 a tablespoon of red pepper and 1/2 a tablespoon of garlic powder (if you don't have garlic cloves).  But regardless, this was an amazing recipe!

This recipe was so quick and easy to make but so tastey.  I mixed it in with some pasta and it will definitely be a regular at my house from now on.

This was great!!!  I'm not a pro at telling flavors, but I did think it was missing a little something, but I can't tell what it is!  I asked my husband what he thought and his answer was, "you can make it again."
