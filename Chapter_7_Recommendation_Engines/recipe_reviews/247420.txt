These were very good and pretty simple to put together. I used some leftover shredded chicken and then  seeded my tomatoes first so the juice wouldn't water down the mixture. I also added a diced jalape√±o to the mix. My cucumber was small, like a pickle, so I used two and even then I had a bit of mix left over that I served in an avocado. I also added in some Sriracha and think I will do it again next time I make them! Thank you for the recipe.

The chicken mixture with the cucumber was delicious. I took these to a party, and they were a hit. I did not use the pretzels, there was no way they could fit tucked in the small rolls. I tried eating the two together to see if it was worth it to put smaller pretzel pieces on top. I don't think the pretzel taste added anything. The ingredient list stated "English cucumber,halved crosswise". To me, this means cutting through the center of the cucumber, leaving you with two shorter cucumbers. I suppose if  you didn't cut crosswise you would get a longer slice that would fit more chicken, and the pretzel. Doing this would let the filling drop out of the bottom I felt. Please let me know if I misinterpreted the directions!
