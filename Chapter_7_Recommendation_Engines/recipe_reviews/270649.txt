This is DELICIOUS. For just two of us, I use one whole chicken breast, sliced. The mixture is all things that I have on hand, the prep takes just a few minutes, and it's quick to cook. I make some rice and put it in the micro just before I start cooking the chicken, and everything is ready at the same time (with a salad or other veg). I use a mixture of butter (not margarine) with the olive oil to fry the pieces, as I prefer the flavor of butter. I also add some half and half or cream to the drippings in the pan, to make a light sauce (or add more liquid and thicken it a bit with flour). Excellent main dish, nice enough for company.
