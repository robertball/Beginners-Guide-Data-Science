While my boys love the older type with plain crust...their wives prefer this recipe because of the cornstarch texture and grahamcracker crust and whipped cream topping so this receipe at least works here in the Pacific NW.  However I couldn't cook the reciepe with cornstarch with the older family in Texas so I have to go back to the older way of doing it.
My family is famous for their pineapple cream pie..but we make it with plain prebaked piecrust.. and we don't add eggs to first mixture... only AFTER the cream mixture thickens. We then remove from heat, temper the lightly beatten eggs before adding. Once eggs mixed well...we add butter and vanilla or whatever flavoring you use and beat till shiny.  . (My great grandma used flour instead of cornstarch and got a more old-time texture that holds up well if you want to refrig and then slighly warm.  Also the flour type holds up better if left out under the table cloth of the holdiay table for the later supper.  Since they were dirt farmers...corn-starch was not always available and flour made pies held up well to being able to set out in cupbords, less weeping or watery separation if you use meringue instead of whipped cream.  Anyone remember the way southern country folks tended to have their dining rooms unheated...then after sunday dinner after church...all left overs dishes and desserts are left on the table and covered with a clean bleached table cloth and left till supper?

Found this pie on the bland side. (I am a pineapple lover). I will add 1/2 cup of the pineapple juice and decrease the milk by 1/2 cup for my next attempt.

DO NOT use fresh pineapple in this pie.  There are enzymes in fresh pineapple that break down the custard.  That's why  AMELIAJEAN had so much trouble.

I made this for the first time for Father's Day because my dad is a pineapple fiend! It was unbelieveably good!  I made a few modifications: cut milk by 1/2 cup and added a 1/2 cup of pineapple juice, cut 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract and replaced with 1 teaspoon of pineapple extract. When made with these modifications, this pie is perfect and probably would be even if you don't have pineapple extract. I also used the "Basic Flaky Pie Crust" recipe from this site which turns out flaky and perfect every time!  You will end up with extra filling but I just put it in a dish and one of my kids enjoyed it as homemade pudding:)

A yummy unique twist on plain cream pie, and the almond in the cream is a great idea. Tasty..but don't forget the no tasting rule!! IF you taste it while cooking and then use the same spoon to stir again, a cream pie WON'T SET. (it's a saliva enzyme thing)

This is a wonderful recipe.  When I made it the first time I had to much filling for a 9 inch deep dish pie shell, so I used only 2 cups of milk instead of 3 like the recipe calls for, and I added 1/2 cup of coconut.  Now this is the most wonderful pie, and just the right amount for the deep dish pie shell.  I have made it many times, and each time someone new tries it, they just love it.  Thanks for the recipe.

Wonderful recipe! I did not make my own whipped cream, instead I bought extra creamy whipped topping and added almond extract. Oh my gosh, so yummy.

Great flavor combination of the whipped cream, crust and pineapple cream. I had never heard of a pineapple cream pie before but love pineapple. Foolishly I didn't drain the pineapple so the pie was a little runny by my mistake, but still tasted great. I will definately make this again and next time will remember the drain the pineapple. Thanks for the recipe.

I don't know what I did, but this turned out terribly--it was bitter and the filling never solidified; it was like a pudding. A very not-good pudding. Perhaps I screwed up . . . it looked like a wonderful recipe. I loathe the loss of a whole fresh pineapple, though.

This pie was a huge hit for my Dad's 6oth birthday. He loved it and so did everyone else. It was wickedly easy to make and I discovered it is a GREAT base for any cream pie. This one will stay with our family.

Very good, however it came out a little runny.  This is pie version of a cake I make.  Next time I will use vanilla pudding and use cool whip and spinkle the top with coconut.

I thought this was an award winning recipe??  It tasted like cool whip mixed with pineapple in a graham cracker crust - my guests weren't impressed and neither was I.  Very bland.

This pie was good but not great. It was all eaten though! I did prefer to use a home baked crust. I'm not a graham cracker fan for crust. I thought I would try this as I do like cooked cream filling.

Excellent!!  This one's a keeper.  The filling sort of reminds me of a pineapple pudding.  Consider preparing two crusts, however, because there's way too much filling for just one.

This pie was good but far from great.  Very filling and very sweet.  I probably won't make it again.  Also, I had to add much more powdered sugar than recipe said, but this could be due to using a wisk instead of beaters.

Have been looking for a Pineapple Cream Pie like  my mother used to make. Found it in this reciepe.  Instead of cream , I made a Meringue.  I figured since I used 4 egg yolks I would use the 4 egg white to make the meringue. Tasted just like Mother's

I love pineapple! I was so excited to make this, but I was thoroughly disappointed. The filling was extremely bitter, and almost unbearable! I think that I must've done something wrong, but I have read through the recipe a couple of times now, and I can't seem to figure out what.
