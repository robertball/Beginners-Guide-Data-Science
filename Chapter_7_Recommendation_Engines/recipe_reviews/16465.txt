Like many other reviewers the sparse number of ingrediants combined with the thought of cranberry sauce & French dressing made us skeptical but in the end it was good & we plan to make it again. I did use fresh crushed garlic & rubbed it on all sides of our 3.5lb pork tenderloin followed by a light application of salt & pepper before placing it in our crock pot. My advice on the "sauce" is to mix the dressing & cranberries BEFORE adding the onion to the mix as the onions make it difficult to thoroughly mix otherwise. Our tenderloin took only 6 hrs on low but was moist and tasty & perfect for a day when you need something easy that you can start & let cook without any tending to. My wife did use "Wondra" to thicken the sauce.

When my husband raves, I know I've made something incredible.  He couldn't stop talking about it.  I made it for him and a friend who comes from a family of chefs, and she also loved the flavor and tenderness.  My personal notes:
-I added 1 tablespoon corn starch to the sauce before putting it in the crock pot.  The sauce came out nice and thick, and I poured the excess over the pork before slicing.  It was excellent.
-Per everyone's suggestions, I seasoned the pork heavily with salt, pepper, and garlic.  No complaints here.
-I also used a rolled pork tenderloin, which came out great.
-If you're looking for a good side dish, mashed sweet potatoes and green beans worked great.  Keep it simple.
-The only problem was that there really wasn't enough food for four people.  Next time I'll double the recipe.

I made this for dinner tonight!! It made the house smell wonderful!! I used a bone-in pork loin and I seasoned it with salt/pepper and then seared it in a hot pan with olive oil.  Then put it in the pot with all the ingredients exactly as listed.  It was wonderful!!  I cooked it on high for about 3 1/2 hours and the meat was falling off the bone!! There was lots of sauce, so I made a roux with 3T. butter and 3T. flour and then added all the sauce and it thickened it up.  I sliced the meat and put it on a serving platter with the sauce/gravy poured over the top!!! It was so good!! My hubby had seconds and thirds and my 2 year old asked for MORE!!!! I served it with mashed sweet potatoes and green beans per another reviewers suggestion!! What a pretty dinner!! You could definitely serve it to company.  The only thing that troubled me is that the meat is to tender that it's really hard to cut nice even slices, it pretty much shreds when you go to slice it.  Oh well, it's still awesome!! Thanks for the recipe!!!!

I made this last night and I am glad I read the reviews.  First, I only had a 3 1/2 pound bone-in pork roast, but it worked really well.  I seasoned it first with garlic salt and lemon pepper.  I used the whole-cranberry sauce and not the jelly type. After eight hours, I took it out and took all the meat off amd placed it in a casserole dish and after thickening the sauce, poured it over it, covered it and placed it in the refrigerator.  Tonight, I heated it up and served it with homemade mashed potatos, fresh asaragus and it was fabulous.  We had unexpected guests and they had seconds and thirds.  This receipe is a keeper.  I think the secret is to let the pork soak up the "gravy" for a day.  It really had a wonderful flavor.

I have to be honest.   This recipe scared me!  The few ingredients that you use just didn't seem to go together.  I made it based on the reviews of other members and wow was I surprised!  Absolutely delicious! I used a pork loin instead of tenderloin and cooked it on high for 3 1/2 hours and you could cut it with your fork it was so tender!  Great and unbelievably easy recipe!  Thank you!

This is a wonderful meal! I took advice from other reviewers, and salt & peppered the meat, used whole cranberry sauce, cooked on high for 4 hours -- and it was great. The flavor is wonderful and you can't taste the French dressing. I actually used Ken's brand French which is a darker red color and had honey in it. I highly recommend this recipe for the ease of putting it together and its fantastic flavor.

Easy and delicious!  My husband said he could eat the whole thing - he went back for seconds, then thirds! I used a bone-in pork loin/roast and was sure to season it well and use whole cranberry sauce as others advised. I then cooked it on high for one hour then turned it down to low for six hours. We ate it straight away!  It was falling off the bone and so tender we didn't need a knife.  Thank you for a excellent recipe and thanks to all of you who take the time to add suggestions!  Don't you just love this site!?!?!?!

This one's a keeper! Only changes I made were to season the roast with salt/pepper & a mix of seasonings I use on nearly every type of meat I cook. I didn't have French dressing so used Western- which is much sweeter. I added some minced garlic & used whole cranberry sauce.  Hubby LOVED it as is, although next time, I plan to use the actual French dressing in the hopes that it will tame down the sweet-factor & some red pepper flakes to kick it up a notch!  We've already planned to use this for our pulled pork recipe (using the jellied cranberry sauce). I see us making this often!

The sauce turned the roast a reddish color on the outside, but it was worth it, the whole roast tasted lightly like cranberries. I browned the roast first and cooked on low for 10 hours.

This is the first five stars I've given any recipe.  This was so simple and so wonderful.  I loved the flavor.  I told my daughter about it and I'm bringing her left overs today so she can try it.  I gotta tell you, and I'm chuckling as I write this, I drank the rest of the gravy because I couldn't throw it away.  It was that good.   I loved this.  Thank you.   Burp.

I've seen this recipe before, except it called for a packet of Lipton Onion Soup mix, instead of onions, this might make up for missing seasonings as per other reviews.  Also, i use the whole berry cranberry sauce.

Good staple recipe for an easy, hearty, crowd-pleasing entree.  Will make again, but learned this:  In my crockpot, the cooking time is more like 2.5 hours on high (it was overdone at 3 hours).  Keep an eye on it and check the internal temp with a meat thermometer until you know how your crockpot will handle this recipe.    Other tips:  I like this recipe with way more onions and with apple slices.  I made a "bed" of them on the bottom of the crockpot, and that worked out great; they added to the sauce and, I think, helped keep the  meat moist by keeping it off the direct heat at the bottom of the pot.

OMG!! This was fantastic! My two year old had 3rds!! Followed the recipe... didn't make any changes.  I actually preped it weeks in advance and froze it in a ziploc bag.  When I was ready to use, I just thawed and dumped the bag into my slow cooker... no muss, no fuss!  Will definitely be making this a staple at our house!

This turned out really good.  I salted and peppered pork loin before cooking.  I also used Catalina dressing (I like Catalina better than plain French because Catalina is tangy).  I also added several good "shakes" of crushed red pepper to the cranberries and dressing.  I did add the onions, but I think next time I will try it without them.  I cooked on high for 4 hours and it was perfect (did fall apart like pulled pork, not able to slice it).  Once it was done cooking, I took the gravy (which was very thin) and put in a pan with some corn starch and cooked until thick.  By adding the crushed red pepper, I had a tangy, sweet, spicy gravy.  Served with sweet potatoes, green beans and rolls.  BOY WAS IT GOOD!!

My family LOVES this dish!  I do make a few changes - I use pork tenderloin to keep it healthier but I also double the sauce using 1 can of whole berry cranberry sauce and 1 can of Jellied - keeps it thick - and 2/3 cup light french dressing - My dinner guests still request it frequently!!!!

The tenderest pork I have ever made.  I think that the cranberry/french dressing sauce should be doubled, but cut back to half an onion.  My meat let out so much juice that it completely diluted the cranberry taste.  It was still good tho..we ate it all :)

I hate pork and this was AMAZING. I doubled the sauce recipe. I also used a pork tenderloin. I left in the slow cooker for a whilllllleee. About 8 hours but i went from low temp in the morning to high temp in the afternoon. The meat literally separated with a fork. AND I mean I REALLY hate pork (made it as an addition to the turkwy for thanksgiving)

I've made this many times. My husband always raves about it and guests always ask for the recipe.  The only changes I've made is that I sprinkle a little salt and fresh ground black pepper on all sides of roast before putting in crockpot.  I also chop the onions instead of slicing.  While roast is resting, I thicken the sauce with a little cornstarch.  I usually serve this with mashed sweet potatoes and green beans or broccoli.  YUMM.

I was very hesitant to try this with such mixed reviews, but am SO glad I did.  It was the best pork loin I have ever made, and so simple!  I made no changes except to rub the pork loin in Goya Adobo before covering with the sauce.  Cooked on low for 8 hours, and the pork just shredded it was so tender.  Not sure if maybe the 4 hour high cook time would give some reviewers the "sliced loin" they seem to be looking for, but I only care about taste, so it made no difference to me.  Will absolutely become a staple dinner in our house.

I didn't have a pork roast so I used 3 pork chops instead. I added 1 thinly sliced celery rib and about 1/2 t of chili powder plus the recommended garlic, salt, and pepper. The sauce was very good. It resembles the polynesian sauce you get at Chick-Fil-A. I served it with potatoes and cabbage, but with so much delicious sauce, I think it would have been much better with rice.

Unbelievably simple and delicious. I used a pork butt cut into 1 in chunks, seasoned well with salt and pepper, added dried cranberries I found in the pantry  and cooked on high for about 6 hrs. Used a flour slurry to thicken and served on top of mashed potatoes with green beans, bacon and roasted pine nuts as a side. Definite keeper.

This was really good and very tender, the meat just fell apart.  I seasoned the pork with salt, pepper and garlic powder before putting into the slow cooker.  I used 2 cans (14oz each) of cranberry and about 1 and a half onions.  Mine was finished in 6 1/2 hours on low and I served over brown rice.  I thought the flavor was wonderful, but I could also see how some people may think it's too bland.  Don't get me wrong, there is a lot of flavor but some people may want to add a touch of cayenne or more pepper to give it that little extra zing.

This was amazing! I mixed up the sauce as directed, added a squirt of honey, pepper, italian seasoning and about a tbs of minced garlic and poured over the pork. -Gotta love recipes as easy as that! The sauce is great over roasted potatoes.

I am amazed that this recipe only has a 4 star average. I have gotten some really good recipes from this site, but this one is one of the best yet.  I did take the advice of others and seared the meat first, salt and peppered it, and added 1 tbs cornstarch to make the sauce thicker.  My family LOVED this roast. It was fork tender had wonderful flavor, and was so EASY.  I have decided to make this for our Christmas dinner. Thanks Dawn for such a delicious recipe.

Oh my gosh, where do I start?!?  YUM!!!  And hubby says MMMmmm!!! I used boneless pork chops instead of tenderloin, and I doubled the cranberry sauce and french dressing.  I also forgot the onion.  Cooked on high for an hour, then 7 hours on low.  I didn't worry about mixing the sauce and dressing in a bowl first...just put one can of sauce in the crock pot, then 1/3 cup dressing, then chops, then other can and the other 1/3 cup dressing.  Gave it a quick swirl, and let it finish mixing by cooking. It was soooooooooo delicious!!!  Fall apart tender, and what a wonderful taste! A definite keeper!  Thanks for sharing!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  The beauty of this site, is to take a recipe and make it your own way.  I put cracked pepper all over my roast before I put it in to add a little heat.  I used Catalina dressing also as a previous reviewer suggested to make more tangy.  I also shook some lipton onion soup mix into the liquid.  There are several ways to avoid a dry roast.  First of all, smear the cranberry/dressing mixture all over the roast before you start cooking.  Halfway through the cooking process, flip the roast and spoon more mixture over it.  I left the string on my roast and it stayed in tact.  You also have to keep an eye on the internal temperature.  My roast was completely done in 6 hours after cooking it on low.

This sounded so strange to me, but I went ahead and tried it, and I'm so glad I did!  My family loves it.  I use a sweet onion (like a walla-walla) instead of a regular onion, as I find it's a little sweeter, and a little less overpowering that way.  I also like to use whole cranberry sauce.  The whole cranberries floating in the sauce are a nice touch.  Also, I prefer cooking it for four hours on high instead of for 8 hours on low.  It is still moist, but the roast stays firmer, allowing you to slice it.  When you cook the pork for 8 hours, it tends to shred, and you lose that roast consistency.  This recipe yields a lot of sauce - great for pouring over the meat, and also over mashed potatoes or rice!  It heats up well the next day.

I must say that I was very skeptical of this recipe.  I love all of the ingredients separately but would they be good together?  Absolutely delectable!!  I made this recipe yesterday and had the most amazing dinner last night, lunch today and I'll have it again for lunch tomorrow.  Amazing!!!  The reviews gave me the courage to try it so that's why I'm posting my first review ever on this site.  I did put salt, pepper and minced garlic on the roast before coating it with the onion/cranberry sauce (I only had the jellied kind)/french dressing mixture.  My husband decided to add a half of a package of dried cranberries flavored with cherry juice that we had been munching on for a few days.  We might thicken the sauce with cornstarch next time but that's just a personal preference of mine.  I highly recommend this recipe and thank Ms. Miner so much for posting it.  Thanks to all of the other reviewers too!  

Try this recipe!!!

This recipes was extremely easy and was perfect as is.  It's irritating when people add everything the changed to their reviews.  Then it's not this recipe...  One note of clarification, I did use the cranberry sauce with whole cranberries in it.  That's what is shown in the photo, too.  It adds character and texture to the dish, rather than plain cranberry sauce.

The pork came out so tender and moist. I put it in still frozen and cooked it on low for 8 hours. I served it with wild rice and broccoli and all the flavors worked wonderfully together. This is a recipe I will use again. So simple, yet, so delicious.

Excellent recipe even though the combination of ingredients seems odd. If you don't want to use the sweet "french or catalina" dressings there is an alternative. Another site has the recipe for the clone of Outbacks tangy tomato dressing. You can control the sugar that way or use a sugar substitute like Splenda. And of course you can always buy whole cranberries and make cranberry sauce with Splenda. Lots of options for folks who watch their sugar intake.

Awesome!  I did make some changes.  Rubbed the pork with onion powder, garlic powder, salt & pepper.  I added one envelope of dry onion soup mix to the bottom of the slow cooker.  Added 3 tablespoons of corn starch to the dressing and cranberry sauce (to thicken), poured it over the pork and cooked on low for 8 hours.  Yum, yum, yum!!!  My husband and children ages 7, 6, and 4 loved it too.  Thanks so much for the great idea.

It's true, "Less is more." A few simple ingredients resulted in BIG flavor. I've made it twice to rave reviews.  I gave the recipe to a friend and she was sure I had to be ommiting some ingredients. It's a keeper for sure.

amazing. i read loads of reviews before i made this, and was a bit skeptical. but once it hit my lips...so good. i did make a few changes that were suggested by other readers: no onion, added 2 tbls cornstarch, salted/peppered and seared the loin prior to putting it the pot. my boyfriend said this was the best thing i have made for him recently, which says a lot. cooked for 4 hours on high, till 160, and it was perfect. moist, fell apart with the fork. just great. highly recommended. this one gets saved in the "make again" file!!

I have been making this for years and espeically enjoy doing so around the holidays when I have an excuse to use HOMEMADE cranberry sauce (mmm...). Although not what I'd condider "guest worthy" (I would reserve this for a family meal), this is quick and satisfying nonetheless. Just pair wtih a green veggie / starch and you're all set! I too sometimes serve this with onion rings for a fun change of pace. Since I do not care for canned whole berry cranberry sauce, I use the jellied variety when I have no homemade sauce available. I usually add a couple generous handfuls of dried cranberries (i.e. Craisins) to add texture, but this is perfectly fine without them. Sometimes I'll sub Catalina or Western dressing if I don't have any French in the fridge. Play around with this. The beauty of Dawn's recipe is that it is VERY forgiving - for example, add a packet of onion soup mix to make a savory gravy (just be sure to omit the sliced onion in its place). All in all, this is decent and worth trying, if at least just once (but I bet you'll make it more often than that!). Thanks for sharing, Ms. Miner! :-)

I just made this recipe but used onion soup mix instead of sliced onions along with whole cranberry sauce.  It was fabulous.  Sliced it up the next day and made sandwiches topped with some of the cranberries from the sauce.

One of the best things I've made with the slow cooker.  I agree with some of the posters; season the meat before adding the sauce.  Also, sauce was a lot more than needed for the amount of meat.  I recommend upping the meat to about 5 lbs.  I'll definitely make this again.  The whole family loved it!!

Excellent recipe. We don't go for too much sugar in cooking, so instead of cranberry sauce I used whole cranberries, with a commercial sweet onion/fig grilling sauce, and just put in the sliced onion as the recipe called for. The grilling sauce gave the dish just the right sweetness for us, and the whole cranberries were nice and tart, and added a festive appearance.

Extremely wary but reviews convinced me to try this and WOW what a pleasant surprise.  Have already passed this on to a friend (via phone) who is making it for tonight.  Will try with chicken next week.  We enjoyed it and is on my TOP list for meals.

DELICIOUS!!!  Even my picky kids LOVED it!  My 11 year old daughter went back after dinner, had some leftovers, and told me it's the best roast I ever made.  Since I didn't have french dressing, I used a bottle of barbecue sauce.  I also seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder.  I'll definitely make this one again.

Yum!!!  I think this was the first thing I have made that everyone in the family gave the thumbs up to.  I totally omitted the salad dressing.  Could not be simpler.   Big chunks of onion on the bottom, pork roast, dump a can of whole cranberry sauce on top, splash of OJ, salt and pepper, 4 hours on low and viola!

We all really liked this and it was a nice change from the traditional pork roast. The pork was so tender and it made a great sauce. I served it with Au Gratin Potatoes but next time I will serve it with noodles and pour the sauce over it.

This was wonderful! Super easy, too. I used boneless pork loin chops, as it is what was to hand. Don't be put off by the cranberry jelly- it makes a lovely gravy! It was hard to resist the urge to add water at the outset, but I'm glad I did. I did thicken the liquid with a touch of instant flour, but won't do that next time round- I think I prefer a thinner boullion type gravy. We had this with egg noodles, but it would be divine with garlic mashed potatoes. This has been added to my recipe queue for fall and winter meals. Great nosh!

this was so good!  I browned the tenderloin on both sides in olive oil and salt and pepper.  After reading the other reviews I added more French dressing and 2 cans of cranberry (I had a 4 lb tenderloin)so it wouldn't be dry.  It has so much flavor...it sounds weird I know, (the combination) but it is a keeper!

This was a strange dish.  I didn't love it, but I didn't hate it.

When I came hom from work the house smelled delightful.  Then I opened the lid to the crock pot and took a closer smell - which was slighly off putting.

I tasted the dish and it was okay, but had a strange aftertaste.

I'd already salt and peppered everything, but I added more salt.  I tasted again and it still didn't really do it for me.  I added about a half cup of sweet red wine and it made it a little better.

I thickened the sauce and served it with rice.

While eating it - I found myself enjoying it.  The pork was DELICIOUS.  The sauce still had a little aftertaste.

I used whole-berry cranberry sauce and think I'd use the other type if I made it again.  The skin of the cranberries didn't fare so well in the slow cooker.  I had several leathery little cranberry jackets in the sauce.

I think next time I might omit the French Dressing and try it with Chili Sauce instead.  

Like I said... it was a strange dish, but I loved how easy it was and the taste of the pork was fantastic.  I'd make it again and just dump the sauce and slice the pork.

I've made this several times.  I take about 1/2 a cup of the liquid out shortly before its done and mix in 2 tablespoons of corn starch.  It makes a really good thick sauce for with the pork.

I must preface by saying that...call me crazy...but I don't think it's fair to rate a recipe if you make all kind of changes.  That said...this was a good solid base recipe.  Made it just as stated except for adding salt and pepper, which is usually just a given.  Very delicate flavor and the cooking aroma was fantastic.  Will keep and add my own touches next time to hopefully get a 5 star result!!!

Served it to friends and they loved it. I, along with other reviewers, seasoned roast with olive oil, crushed garlic, salt and pepper overnight in a ziploc bag. 

I wouldn't hesitate to make it again. Sliced beautifully!

I used a pork shoulder roast and added a cup of pineapple I had left over. Cooked on high for 3 hours and low for 3 hours til it was falling apart. Left it shredded in the sauce in the fridge overnight and Voila! The best pulled pork for sandwiches! Great recipe.

The simplicity of this is wonderful!  I had a 3 lb. roast and cooked on low for 8 hours - came out dry.  Should've read the reviews first!  Definitely, need to salt & pepper first.  Will try again with less cook time.

It wasn't bad, but I don't think I'll never make it again.  It's going to be hard enough to get through all the leftovers.  The sauce flavor is just too weird for me.  I adore cranberry sauce, but not in this.

I made a  few changes with this; used 3 2"-thick  boneless pork chops which I dredged in flour mixed with Chicago Steak Seasoning (from  Penzey's Catalog  - this seasoning is awesome.)  Catalina dressing and added extra dried cranberries and  also 
maybe a 1/4 cup extra of the salad dressing.  My husband thought it was a "keeper".  Oh, and I added frozen broccoli as well.  And I did it on the stove rather than the slow-cooker.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe.

I made it exactly as stated because I wanted my review to be fair.  It was really good, but a little too "onion-ey".  Will do half an onion next time.  Also, think the cranberry part should be doubled, and perhaps add some apple.  A good starting point though.  Was definitely tender, and I did brown it first as some other reviewers stated.  I definitely would not have been able to guess what went into it when it was done - it was a strong, onion-ey sauce/gravy, but it did not taste cranberry-ey or at all like French Dressing.  I will make this again, but with less onion, some apple added (and maybe fresh cranberries) and at least double the canned cranberry sauce.

Very good recipe overall; however I did make a few changes that I think improved the recipe for my taste (my family loved the changes as well).  I used Russian dressing instead of French dressing and full 8 oz bottle.  Be sure to use canned jelled "whole" cranberries.  I also sauted the onion in canola oil with 1 tsp of sugar and added to the mix once it was tender.    I've made this with both pork loin roast and thick sliced pork loin chops.  The chops work well provided you brown them on the stovetop first (typically two minutes per side).  I usually brown them with the onion mix.  Do not overcook!  This browning simply helps hold the sliced loin together during slow cooking.  I think these changes improved an already very good recipe.

Yummy, yummy, yummy.  The whole family loved it, from my 9 mo old baby to my husband and I.  The kids all had 2nds and 3rds.  I have a pork allergy so I made it with a cornish hen.  I also didn't have any French dressing so I used a Newman's Greek dressing that I had on hand and just used some onion flakes because I was feeling lazy and didn't want to chop up the onion. I also used Trader Joe's organic orange cranberry sauce instead of the regular.

This was not as good as I thought it was going to be. It did smell wonderful cooking, but to be honest we have had better pork loin roast without the cranberries etc.  I just wanted to try something different.

My husband said this recipe is a keeper and I agree!  I took the suggestions of some other reviewers and seasoned the pork with kosher salt, freshly cracked pepper and garlic powder and then pan seared it (in some olive oil) before putting it in the crock pot.  I will definitely make this again!

Love this recipe! Cooked pork loin on high for 3 3/4 hours and it was very tender and juicy when finished. The sauce tastes like a bbq sauce. WONDERFUL EASY RECIPE!!!

I made this with a bone-in pork loin.  Per everyone's suggestions, I used whole-cranberry sauce rather than jellied and added garlic, salt and pepper.  I cooked it on high for five hours, and actually, it may have cooked too quickly.  But it was still moist and very good.  Perhaps the saucy flavor didn't stick as much with the pork as I was expecting, but I boiled the sauce down and added corn starch to make a thicker gravy, which was good.  I have little tolerance for overly sweet dishes, and it was not overwhelming sweet for me at all.

I've made this with pork and chicken.  They both turned out excellent, but my family likes it with chicken best. I used whole cranberry sauce and  opted to thicken the sauce with cornstarch.  I served the meal over rice.  Really yummy.

After sing this recipe on this site, I was a little frightened and thought if everyone says it's so good, I have to try it! I have been making this dish for a while now. My husband loves it and actually requests it often!! I will upload a pic soon, I'm making it for company tonight! Also, I season a 3 1/2 lb loin after trimming the fat off. I season with salt, pepper and heavily with garlic powder, then add the rest of the ingredients. I also use a whole can of whole cranberries and half a can of the jellies cranberry. It's just so delicious! I serve with sauted brussel sprouts with bacon and mashed potatoes! Amazing!!

I used cranberry sauce without berries. Still tasted wonderful but I will be sure to use the whole berry sauce next time. I , like other, rubbed in minced garlic, salt and pepper prior to adding the sauce. Also the cook time can be reduced. I had my slow cooker set for 8 hours. I check on it after about 5 and it was perfect.

I've been making this for years with whole cranberry sauce,chicken pieces in a 9x13 covered with foil in a 350 oven.  Everyone is always surprised how flavorful with such few ingredients.  Will for sure do the pork version the next time around.

The only reason as to why I am giving this recipe 2 stars, is because it was easy to put together. And although my husband enjoyed it, I on the other hand didn't like it at all. I followed some of the other reviews by adding Garlic, Salt & Pepper, but I still wasn't impressed. I still found it was very bland, and the pork had no colour and I don't think that I will be making this again.

yum, yum, YUM! I didn't have any french dressing on hand so I used another suggestion and made the Outback Tangy Tomatoe dressing (without the sugar), used a can of jellied cranberry sauce, and added about a 1/2 C of dried cranberries. WOW. surprisingly really good stuff.

I would give this recipe a 3 because it lacked flavor, and had I not added a tbsp. of cornstarch to the cranberry mixture it would have been runny.  I seasoned the pork heavily with salt, pepper, and garlic.  Halfway through cooking, I tasted the sauce and it definitely needed more seasoning.  I had to add about 3-4 generous sprinkles of salt, pepper, and garlic to the sauce in order to get it to taste okay.  I opted to cook my roast on high, and it took a little under four hours to cook.  I used my thermometer, took it out right at 160, and then let it sit for about 20 minutes or so.  The pork was tender, but not very moist.  Maybe had I cooked it on low, for a longer period of time, it may have turned out juicy.  This is something I probably wouldn't make again.  Served it with garlic green beans and mashed potatoes.

Absolutely delicious! I used Kraft Creamy French dressing because that is all we had on hand and whole cranberry sauce. My family has asked me to make this again. Definitely a winner!

This was great! Luv the recipe, didn't need to make any changes.  My husband luv'd it I think it is best if you let it cook on low for 8 hrs so that it can soak up the flavor longer. It was also great left over! Thanks for the recipe.

This is probably one of the better slow cooker recipes I have used in a long time.  The sauce was tangy and sweet, the pork was unbelievably tender.  I was surprised how so few ingredients can make such an excellent meal.  I doubled the sauce recipe as I have about 4 lbs of port.  There was plenty of sauce left to reduce with corn starch to make a thick and delicious sauce.  I served this with sweet potatoes and there was absolutely nothing left at the end of the meal.  My friends are still raving about it because it got their one year old to eat meat.

Amazing and simple, although I was skeptical when I tried. Really good paired with rice to soak up the excess sauce. Very nice to have in your box for something that tastes SO good, but can be done on the fly!

Good Gravy!  This is one of the craziest recipes I've ever made.  My hubby kept peeking in the crock pot all day and saying "Is this gonna taste okay?".   He loved it.  I used a 3 pound boneless pork shoulder.  I liberally sprinkled it with kosher salt and fresh ground pepper, then browned it before I put it in the pot.  Other than that, I kept to the recipe and cooked on low for 8 hours.  it just fell apart and the sauce was amazing!  I made buttermilk mashed potatoes, but rice would have been equally good.  This has become a new "standard" in my recipe book.

My husband RAVED about this dish!  Says it was one of the best meals he's ever had and to please make it again soon!  I followed the suggestions offered by Cookin'NJ and added one of my own.  I dissolved the cornstarch in three/four tablespoons of orange juice before adding to cranberry sauce and French dressing.  The sauce was just right and the o.j. gave it a little kick.

Great for a fall weeknight family meal.  The meat, for the most part, was tender and flavorful.  It had the look and texture of pulled pork.  I used whole cranberry sauce and creamy french dressing, and I rubbed 2 minced garlic cloves onto the meat before putting it into the slow cooker.

Great recipe. The whole family loved it including my husband who doesn't like pork. I made a few changes. Followed suggestions and rubbed roast with sea salt, ground pepper, and minced garlic. We love garlic so I added quite a bit.(3-4 tsp ?)  Also had ken's french dressing with bacon on hand which has a bit of a smoky flavor but it blended well with the cranberry sauce. Will definitely make again.

I loved this, hubby liked it (but he's fussy so he doesn't count). One of the best dinners I've ever made.  I incorporated many of the comments from other reviewers.  I browned the pork loin in oil, garlic, pepper first.  Although I used onion in the sauce, I removed it at the end (4 hours on high) since neither one of us like it.  I thickened the sauce with flour and used it as a gravy.  So tender and tasty! This is a keeper and I will be making it again.  Did I say how easy it is?  I served it with cornbread and steamed asparagus.  I only used a 1.5 lb pork loin.

This recipe was great!  My husband wasn't so sure he'd like it as he is not a fan of cranberries, but turns out he thought it was fabulous.  We also had bbq pork sandwiches out of it the next day.

It was ok, but I thought it'd be much more flavorful.  I had to add salt to give it a kick, but the meat was moist.

Very good dish and not at all expensive, I used one can of jelled and one can of whole berries and had rave reviews... Made it a second time for Easter, this time I added slices of fresh Jalapeno without the seeds. It was so awesome, not hot but the flavor exploded...

I gave this 1 star because it did turn out very tender and just fell apart. However, I'm not sure exactly what I did wrong but it had no flavor. Maybe because I used fat free french? I'm not sure but my husband wouldn't eat it and my kids wouldn't touch it. Thanks anyway!

Awesome! My family loved this recipe - and it was greatly enhanced by the side dishes recommended over and over in the reviews - mashed sweet potatoes and green beans. This is a recipe that will satisfy the WHOLE family - even my children had seconds.

I LOVE this recipe! I served it at a dinner party and my guests raved. I used pork butt instead of pork loin (it's cheaper) and it was delicious (slightly fatty but definitely not dry at all). This recipe makes a TON of sauce for gravy and the sweet-tangy flavor really compliments the pork. I followed other users' excellent suggestions to season & sear the meat first and use whole cranberry sauce. I also seasoned the sauce with french onion dip mix (or you could use onion soup mix). I will definitely make this again!

I loved this!  My pork was very tender and juicy, and the sauce was wonderful and very flavorful.
I browned my boneless pork loin before I put it in the slow cooker.  The only thing i changed was I was out of onions, so I used half a packet of onion soup mix.  Oh, and I only cooked my pork on low for about 3 1/2 hours.  I then let it rest for about 10 min before I sliced it.  I have never cooked pork in the slow cooker for such a short amount of time, but my meat thermometer said it was done.  This is the first time my pork did not shred and become dry from the slow cooker.  Try browning and cooking your pork less and I am sure you will be happy with the results!  This is a good one!!

I tweeked the recipe a bit; I used pork tenderloins (but am sure a roast would be fine) and I seasoned them liberally with garlic salt and pepper.  I then added 1/4 cup white wine and 1/3 cup water to the sauce and dressing, using the same amounts of everything else. I made this for the residents at my work and they all loved it, it also has a great aroma when cooking.  Thanks!

This is really quite good! It does, however, need a friendly dose of salt and pepper! I thickened the sauce and poured it back over the chops (forgot to take the roast out of the freezer). The chops were tender and moist. I made this again with a loin roast and it is better with the roast as per recipe. Don't forget the salt and pepper.

I made this recipe with six pork chops and served it with spaetzle and braised red cabbage.  I thought it was fantastic despite the somewhat watery sauce--the meat was tender and tasty.

This was good.  I thought the combinations of ingredients sounded strange, but I figured that this many people liking it couldn't be wrong.  I used a pork loin roast after reading comments from previous reviewers and it still finished cooking quicker than the instructed time.  The meat was a little dry, but adding the "gravy" helped moisten it up and it was tasty.

Excellent!  For three people, I used a 1 1/2 pound boneless center cut pork roast (NOT tenderloin, which cooks too fast), and it was fork tender and moist after 7 1/2 hours on low.  The thin gravy was delicious, and whole berry cranberry sauce made it look and taste great.  This would be a nice dish at Thanksgiving for people who don't like turkey.

WOW!!!  I used WHOLE cranberry sauce & 1/2 cup Catalina dressing. Put 1 lb of baby carrots under meat & thick sliced yellow onion over meat. Topped with the sauce. Cooked 2 hrs on HIGH & then 4 hrs on LOW. Then house smells wonderful, was 5 minutes work & FANTASTIC! Family & I are now addicted. Will be making once a week!

The flavor was good, however, the meat was dry.  Perhaps altering the cooking time may help.  I added the garlic, salt, and pepper as suggested by others and it added nice flavor.  I plan to try this one again and shorten the cooking time.

Yes, I did try this recipe but made so many changes. I have to say, I am sort of a bland eater but my husband loves spice, so we are pretty much opposite. For this recipe, what did I do? Well, I cut my pork tenderloin in half so I actually had two pieces totalling a little over a pound. Used one half can or so of jellied cranberry.  Used a jar of Heinz beef gravey (yes I did). I melted the cranberry and gravey in a saucepan and it seemed a little thick so I added some beef broth-just poured it in..maybe half a cup??? When I browned the meat, I added William Sonoma garlic pepper...I am hooked. Then just a little salt since my hubby is diabetic and all the other stuff has a lot of salt. When I was browning the meat, I chopped half a small yellow onion and browned it with the roast. I have a crock pot where I can brown, so after it was browned,I put it in the heating element portion. I scrubbed baby red potatoes-you know the little ones. I was so unsure about what to do because I read put them in 2 hours ahead of time and others said to put them in for 8 hours, so... Anyway I put them in around my little roast pieces immediately and set the crock pot at 8 hours on low. Oh man, it smelled so good all day. After 8 hours, the potatoes were still a little hard (yes, they were firm after all that time). Set the timer on high for an hour. Served with broccolini. Potatoes were firm but for sure done. We enjoyed immensley. Please try as you will love this crazy recipe!!!!

This was AMAZING!  I didn't read any of the reviews before making it, but I had looked at similar recipes.  I decided to combine 2.  First I coated my roast with Dijon mustard and seared it in some olive oil before putting it in the crock pot.  I also mixed the Cranberry sauce and Dressing before adding the onion.  My kids aren't hip on sauces, so I really didn't do anything with the sauce.  I think next time, I may thicken it up a bit for my husband and I.  This is definitely a keeper.

I had a 2 pound roast on hand, but made exact amounts of sauce ONLY because I only had one can of cranberry sauce on hand.  Everyone loved it and we sopped up everything in site with the sauce.  I will definitely double or triple it next time.  Great new keeper for some picky eaters!!  Thanks!

Easy to make, and keeps the flavor. I used the sauce later for chili, and it added a slight sweetness that was an enjoyable twist.

We made this today and it was A-MAZING!!! Made a couple of additions.. We added an extra onion bc we LOVE onions and about 2 tablespoons of cornstarch.. I pulled the meat out of the sauce after the 4 hours and reduced it a little in a sauce pan. It was thick like a gravy and went perfect with steamed rice..

Perhaps people having no success with this recipe have a slow cooker that actually cooks at too high a degree. True Slow cookers should cook around 225 degrees or a little lower. 8 hours at this degree should be fine for a pork loin to come out moist.    If it is the case that your slow cooker cooks too high...purchase a boston butt or other fatty pork roast or even chicken thighs or pork ribs...the fat in the meat will withstand the higher heat and come out moist.  Also, you may want to brown this before cooking. This will help with color and flavor.  And, Pork, especially a leaner cut,  does need to be seasoned well.  If you can find Berkshire pork...do buy it. It is delish!

Hmm, I'm sorry I don't understand all the rave reviews.  I used the suggestions, salt, pepper, garlic, even pepper flakes.  I'm an experienced cook.  I just didn't think it was all that terrific and either did my husband.  There so many better ways to prepare pork. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't very good either.

This was fabulous and easy.  I used pork tenderloin and cooked it in the oven at 225 over 5 hours.  It came out perfect.  My guests all got copies of the recipe.

I have a recipe like this that also includes a package of dry onion soup mix.It is baked in the oven but I am sure it would be graet in a crock pot also. Both are very good and easy.

This is one of the easiest and tastiest recipes I've come across.  My husband is rather fussy but he LOVED this pork.  He tells everyone about it and makes me sound like the worlds best cook.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, we make it often!

This is my kind of recipe.  I doubled everything and it's falling off the bone. Supposed to serve it tonight but hubby keeps going into crockpot and eating it.  I did salt and pepper meat before throwing into crockpot and add a few cloves of garlic.  Tons of sauce which I will try for the first time to thicken.  Will serve with mashed potatoes and green beans!  Thank You for posting such an EASY and Delicious recipe.

This sounds like such an odd recipe but trust me it is surprisingly good!!! Even my husband requests this...and that is impressive! 

The only thing I had to do differently was thicken the sauce up at the end. It was a little runny and after thickening it up it became more of a gravy to pour over the meat. 

I served this over brown rice. Must try!

This recipe is fantastic! It's easy to make. My husband loved it, so I made it, doubling the recipe, for a family reunion, also, and everyone raved how delicious it was, even the leftovers. They all asked for copies of the recipe. We put the gravy over mashed potatoes, and later made sandwiches with the pork and gravy.

This was great.  I'm trying to use my slow cooker more and this was a perfect dish for that.  The subtle mix of taste made for a great taste.  I did rub garlic, etc as mentioned by other reviewers.  Made more sauce than called for and it made a great gravy when thickened.  We'll definitely be eating this again.

I have made this recipe twice now, and it is excellent!  Only 2 tweaks I made: first, for 2.5 lbs. pork, I doubled the sauce.  Also, I cooked the pork alone for the first 2-3 hours (when cooking on low)... this allowed me to dump out most of the greasy juices before adding the sauce.  This made the dish a little healthier (less grease), and the sauce thicker.

WOW!!  The Hub said this was one of the best dishes he has EVER eaten!  Of course, he is a sucker for a sweet sauce, but still. . .I have to admit that it was fabulous—thanks, Dawn, for sharing.  Cranberry sauce now comes in 14-oz cans, so I used two cans just to make sure and increased the dressing to about 3/4 cup.  I chopped the onion and mixed it in with the sauce, and rubbed the roast with salt, pepper & garlic powder and poured the sauce over it.  I cooked it on high for 8 hours because I forgot to turn it down, and it was still wonderful.  I used a slow cooker bag and he lifted it out for me, and I cut the corner of the bag and drained the liquid into a sauté pan.  I mixed about 1.5 tablespoons of cornstarch with 3/4 cup of cold water, added it to the pan and let it come to a boil, then simmered it for about 5 minutes until it thickened slightly.  I served it with white rice.  There are only two of us, so the 3.5 pound roast will make at least three meals.  Tomorrow it’s pulled pork sandwiches!!

This is a terrific recipe but I made a few changes. I browned my 3# pork loin, sauteed 3 onions sliced, added about a tablespoon of roasted garlic to the cranberry sauce, French dressing, salt and pepper. I cooked it 8 hours in the slow cooker on low (7 would have been right). Also followed the suggestion to add cornstarch to thicken the gravy. Delicious!

The key to ANY slow cooker meal is to not rush it or take TOO many shortcuts because it may not come out like its supposed to. That is kinda the whole point behind the name. "slow cook" When I cook in a slow cooker I'm usually cooking dinner for the next night. (Even though this was the next nights dinner I snuck some late at night) lol I used a already seasoned Garlic & Herb Pork Loin Filet. 1.7lbs. That saved me the step from having to season the meat. I browned the meat on all sides first. I used 2 cans of whole cranberry sauce. I layered the first can of cranberry sauce on the bottom, laid the pork loin on top and poured the other can on top. I omitted the onions. I purchased the French salad dressing but chickened out lol. I cooked on high for 4 hours and it was perfect, put the slow cooker on warm for a little while and the sauce thickened on its own. I didnt have to add anything else. The meat was tender and moist but not falling all over the place so I was able to serve it and slice it very nicely. I will definitely try this again and maybe with the french dressing next time :)

So perfect for a busy day. It took me less than 5minutes in the morning to prepare, 6hrs on the crock pot with a timer, so it went on warm until I came home. My husband loved it, and he doesn't even like Thousand Island dressing.

This was a nice addition to my pork recipes. I do a lot of pork and this recipe was very good. It had a great taste, not overpowering but tasty. Very simple and can be used with conventional oven as well as slow cooker. I used the regular oven at 300 for about 4 hours. the ingredients sound odd but taste great together. A Keeper! I wrote this review several months ago..since then I have made it many times. I just wanted to add that you can use Russian dressing, or sweet and sour most anything and the taste is good. Catalina is also good.

This was delicious!! I made this for my husband a few nights ago & it came out great just as the recipe is, no changes needed!  I made it with mashed potatoes, corn & biscuits.  I'm making this again on Monday night for my parents & I'm sure they'll love it too!!  The best part is, it was soooo easy & the aroma while it was cooking was amazing!!!  Great recipe!

This is VERY good.  I followed the directions for the most part but next time I will use whole berry cranberry sauce instead of jellied.  Jellied was all I had on hand today.  I did season my meat with salt and pepper and browned on all sides before adding to the slow cooker.  My whole family enjoyed this.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks for sharing.

This was good. It was easy to prepare and smelled great. My only qualm is that the meat is so expensive that you want a knock you out flavor. This recipe did not give me that. I need more bang for my buck.

Cooking time is too long.  I checked the temperature after 7 hours on low, and it was over 200º.  I would start checking the thermometer after 6 hours.

I used 2.8ish lb skinless/boneless pork tenderloin and mixed 16 oz of cranberry relish (not canned) with French dressing then mixed with a thinly sliced med. size onion.  Cooked H for almost 4 hrs until its temp was over 165 degrees.  Meat was perfect.  This recipe was sooooo easy, and our guests wouldn't stop talking about it!  Easily served 4 adults/4 young children.

This dish had a fantastic flavor.  I had fat-free French dressing in the house and that worked fine.  I didn't change anything.  My whole family enjoyed this. Thanks.

Pretty good! It was a bit dry, so I may have kept it in the crock pot for too long (I'm not too adept as using a crock pot). Served with baked potatoes and green beans.

I tried this recipe over the weekend with high hopes and was very disappointed that it didn't turn out as I had anticipated considering the high-rated reviews.    It was edible, however the flavor was very lacking in my opinion, quite bland actually.  I felt it needed more intensity, more ooomph.  I don't believe that I will make this particular one again.  :(

My husband and I purchased half a hog from my brothers.  We have eaten quite of the meat but we still have cured ham roasts in the freezer - which I've never been a big fan of as they have usually been just dry and salty.  This recipe had so many good reviews, I had to try it.  I used Catalina dressing instead of French since I had it on hand (it's close anyway).  I was hoping that my husband would love it as much as the others' I'd read about...and he did!  He nearly ate half of it.  The meat just fell off the bone...now I know how I'll be making those other ham roasts!  It was great with individually-baked sweet potatoes and green beans.

Needs only salt and pepper on the roast before the rest goes in. This absolutely turns out like pulled pork, so have buns on hand. I served with a jar of lingonberries as a condiment. Unbelievably good and simple! 3 lbs roast cooked in 6qt. Crock Pot for 6 hours. I pulled it apart and let it set in the juices for about 1/2 before serving.

Quick & Easy. Perfect for a busy day. Very tasteful. I followed the recipe except I rubbed garlic, salt & pepper onto the pork before placing into the crockpot.  Served with  Instant Sweet potatoes and steamed green beans.  Excellent :)  Thanks!

My family loved this recipe! I made a couple of modifications such as seasoning the meat with seasoned salt and then browning on all sides before placing roaster and I used Western dressing instead of French.  I also didn't have time to use the slow cooker so I just added all of the ingredients and baked on @ 350 for 2 hours.  Will definately make again!

This was delicious. I used a 6lb pork loin cut in half.  I patted 3 cloves of finely diced garlic into the roast, shook on some salt and pepper, increased the dressing to 2/3C because of the size of the roast, used catalina dressing instead of french as others suggested and one can of cranberry sauce, mine had whole berries. I served this tonight and it got rave reviews, especially from my son and husband who are not cranberry fans. It did cook quicker than expected.  Mine was done in about five hours but stayed moist on warm.  Plenty of juice to use for gravy.   Thanks for this great recipe.

Adding to the dinner lineup! This recipe was delicious. The only modification I made during cooking was seasoning the pork with McCormick's Savory Rub. I cooked it for 8 hours on Saturday, sliced it up and left it in the fridge in the crockpot overnight. Then I heated it on low a few hours Sunday, put the sauce in a pot with a packet of McCormick's pork gravy and about 2 tbsp of flour, served it up with mashed potatoes, sauerkraut, and greenbeans almondine for the tastiest pork dinner I've ever had! I will be making this frequently.

This was just okay for us. We ate it and enjoyed it but i think it was a bit bland. The flavor combination was good but even with adding garlic, salt and pepper, it seemed like it was missing something. Probably will not make again.

This was pretty darn good. Even my 2 year old ate it! It smelled wonderful all day. I followed some other reviewers suggestions and added 2 Tbsp of cornstarch to thicken sauce. It turned out great! I also cooked it for 6 hours, I had a pork tenderloin. I served over rice, yummy!

I was surprised to read that someone else thought this recipe was too sweet. I guess I was expecting it to be sweeter than it was. I added 1/4 c. brown sugar and liked it much better. It also needed salt. I shredded the pork and let it cook a bit longer that way. I liked it served over rice. My husband liked it as a sandwich. We will make it again with these modifications.

My family raved about this recipe. I didn't have any cranberry sauce, so I used Marion Berry jam, no onion, and a Russian type dressing. I also read reviews and added a tablespoon of starch so sauce was not thin and watery. Left overs were used in pulled pork sandwiches that was enjoyed by all. I will make this again.

So delicious.
So Easy.
Followed the directions exactly, (except at the end I pulled apart the pork and let it soak in the juices for 1/2 hr) and was astonished at the taste and tenderness

I thought this was a great dish. As suggested by others, I seasoned my pork butt boneless chops well and browned them first. I never add onions to a slow cooker, as I find the long cooking time makes changes and strengthens their flavour to the point that it overwhelms the food. I added one T cornstarch at the beginning and needed a second to thicken the gravy at the end. We made paninis with the leftover, adding some purple onion and mozzerella, then used the left over sauce for dipping. Two great meals, very little trouble. Thanks for the recipe. I will definately make this again.

Definitely salt and pepper the pork first. I only cooked mine for 3 hours on high and it was at 170 degrees and pretty tough. I let it go another hour and a half on low and it seemed a little less tough, but still dry. This does make a lot of sauce, so add the cornstarch to thicken it... I also added quite a bit of salt and pepper to the sauce to add flavor and about 2T of butter.  It was ok-- but I probably won't make it again.

Absolutely one of the best recipes I've ever made, and it is sooo easy. You can use almost any cut of pork. My husband doesn't love cranberries, so I add a can of cherries in addition to the cranberries. It makes a lot of extra sauce, which is really good as a gravy on other dishes. Today I'm making it with 2 cans of blackberries. Serve with mashed sweet potatoes and roasted green beans; guest worthy and delicious. I served this to a big group at the beach over Thanksgiving week, and it rivaled (exceeded?) the actual Thanksgiving dinner in popularity.

This recipe was just so-so for me. I followed it as directed, except that I used whole cranberry sauce. Slow cookers never really make a good presentation (overcooked, perhaps?), but I appreciate the convenience factor they provide. Maybe next time I'll double the sauce ingredients for more flavor.

My husband and I thought this smelled excellent when we cooked it, but we were very disappointed with how it tasted when it was done.  The meat did not appear to soak up the flavor very well.

EASY PREP & GOOD TASTING! Everybody here enjoyed it! I broke my ankle & am limited in what I can do in the kitchen. I was searching for easy recipes with a few ingredients.  With help, I am able to put this one together & spend the least amount of time on my feet... perhaps we should start a new category for those of us with "limited abilities?" As per others suggestions, I did season the pork loin with salt & pepper, then brown the it in a couple tablespoons of olive oil. Placed the sliced onions on the bottom of the cooker, then added the loin. Mixed the French dressing with whole berry cranberry sauce, 1/4 cup water, and poured that over the loin.  5 hrs on low & its done. Let it rest before slicing. I returned the pork back to cooker on Warm setting for 2 hrs & served with baked sweet potatoes sprinkled with brown sugar & cinnamon and a side of corn. NICE! My eight yr old had seconds!

I have made a similar recipe but substituted the dressing with about 1/2 bottle of chili sauce.  I'd love to take credit for it but a co-worker brought it to a potluck and I make it at least once a month now.  It eventually just starts to fall apart and it freezes great.  Makes ALOT of food.

This was kind of strange ; the pork was fine - not dry, but nothing special since we did not use the sauce, which was, um, strange (I used jellied cranbery sauce and Honey French dressing).  It was an unappetizing maroonish-grayish color and it just tasted off ... it had an intriguing taste, but I would not call it a good taste.  So, we ate the pork with applesauce.

This recipe turned out pretty well.  I added about 1 teaspoon of dried cilantro with the barbecue sauce and cola.  Next time I will probably cook this for longer (say 8 hours) on low instead of the six hours on high.  I think the meat will be a little more tender that way.  Other than that I have no complaints.  Both my husband and two year old son had seconds, and my husband hinted at the fact that I have another pork loin in the freezer.  He already wants to have this again!

This was really not a 4 star recipe in my opinion.  I followed the recipe exactly and what we ended up with was a dry, relatively tasteless pork loin roast.  We won't be making it again.

Another Ok recipe. Nothing to write home about. Was basically a bar-b-que sauce. It tasted nothing like cranberries or french dressing. I used chicken and once cooked it was soupy. I had to get some of the sauce and reduce it in a pan and then pour over the chicken. Will not be making again.

I made this dish using pork tenderloins.  Unfortunately, they became very stringy after 4 hours on high in the crockpot.  The sauce, although a bit watery, was delicious, and helped to moisten the pork tenderloin meat.  I wasn't impressed with this recipe, but my boyfriend enjoyed it very much.  We are having it leftover tonight in sandwiches with cole slaw.  We'll see how I like it the next day....

This was the first recipe I've tried from allrecipes.com, and it is a keeper!  My husband called me at work when he arrived home to tell me how great the house smelled from this dish slow cooking in the crock pot.....while the combination of cranberrys and French dressing sounded strange, the taste is worth it!

I made the recipe with a boneless pork loin. The meat was excellent. The sauce needed a bit of doctoring. I put it in a saucepan and cooked it down because it was too watery. I added sliced carrots,green peppers, pineapple chunks,a little ginger and some brown sugar to give it a more sweet/sour sauce. Served it on rice.

Family dinner this weekend was a big success!  The pork was very tasty and a big hit.  (Make sure to watch closely and not overcook meat - mine was a tad dry.)  However, I was still complimented with rave reviews.  The sauce, when thickened, makes a wonderful gravy and goes great with mashed potatoes!

Fast easy and my kids ate it up.  To me it tasted like very very tender pork chops with not much flavoring though.  Good but not something that makes you say wow.

We don't care for cranberry sauce so I used red plum jelly instead and honey french dressing.  It was wonderful.

Made it again using 1 1/2 C. water, 2 boullion cubes & 1/2 small jar orange marmalade. Served with mashed potatoes and made gravy out of the juice. Delicious!

Made this again last night. Its a family favorite.  Used a 3 lb pork loin and cooked on low for 8 hours.  Meat was so tender, the roast was falling apart lifting out of Crock-Pot.

Served with mashed sweet potatoes and a Waldorf salad.

I doubled the sauce because it didn’t look like enough, and it come out like pulled pork. Everyone seemed to enjoy it and didn’t have any complaints. I made a sandwich out of some leftovers, but that’s probably just the southern in me. :) Don’t be discouraged by the ingredient oddness, it comes out to taste pretty awesome.

I have been making this for my family for the past two years and it has been a big hit ever since I first made it. I find that it goes really well with some kind of potato and either or green beans.

I  always put the sliced onion in the bottom of the slow cooker, then put the meat on top. This way the meat does not overcook and stick to the bottom.
It was really good but needs a bit of zip...orange liqueur? maybe!

Not quite sure what I did wrong with this one.  I followed directions to the letter, cooking it on low.  The roast was done nearly an hour early so I turned it to warm.  The roast was dry and you could not taste the sauce in the meat at all.  I did not use the drippings as I had made scalloped potatoes, but besides drowning the meat in the sauce I don't see how it could have helped.  I might try one more time as I love the idea of the cranberry with the pork, we'll have to see.

Cranberry sauce and french dressing sounded like an odd mix but I like both so I tried it. 
It really turned out well and different than the usual preparation. Keeping this on top of my list.
The last 2 times I made this I used whole berry cranberry sauce. This time I also used chicken instead of pork. about 2 lbs chicken breast cubed.

This recipe was very easy and delicious. I rubbed my pork roast with salt-and-pepper first.    I doubled the recipe and so I was able to use one can of whole cranberries and the second can as cranberry jelly. It worked great. The only thing this recipe is missing is cornstarch, by the time it was ready the sauce was very thin and runny.

I trimmed my 4.5 pound pork tenderloin and cut it in half to make sure it would get done in time. I seasoned with garlic powder and lemon pepper, substituted dry onion soup mix for the fresh onion, mixing it in with whole berry cranberry sauce and Catalina French (used what I had.) I added a little corn starch, will add a little more next time to thicken the sauce. Four hours on high in the slow cooker was perfect. I took out the cooked meat and let it rest 10 min before slicing. Meanwhile I mixed a little more cornstarch with a half cup of the liquid, then mixed it back into the crock and cooked half an hour to thicken the sauce. I couldn't believe how easy, moist, tender, and  yummy this was, I will gladly fix it again, exactly the same way, maybe for company next time. Would be good with rice or mashed potatoes. Excellent recipe!

This dish was easy to follow but I made a few changes.

I rubbed the pork tenderloin with olive oil, minced garlic, salt & pepper.   In a hot pan seared the meat on all sides and added the sliced onions and lightly browned.   Add onions to the bottom of the crock pot, then pork and covered with cranberry jelly and French dressing mixture.  I added a few handfuls of dried cranberries.    Cooked on low for 3 hours.   I added a few tsps. of cornstarch to thicken up the sauce.  Served with mashed potatoes and grilled vegetables.  My husband and 3 sons enjoyed it.

I prepared this for a large family gathering today and it was perfect. I seasoned the tenderloin with salt and pepper first and I used the Ken's dressing with Hiney. My entire family loved it. I served it over rice with the juice. Add a salad and dinner is served. :-)

In agreement with other reviewers, I was skeptical about the sauce but it turned out delicious! I used Lite Honey French dressing (the only kind in the house). I also made homemade whole cranberry sauce.
I followed the recipe exactly.  I did not season the pork at all and it tasted great. 
I took the advice of other reviewers and mixed the cranberry sauce and dressing first before adding the onion. 
I put everything in the cooker at noon on high. At 4pm, the meat temperature was 180 degrees F. I reduced it to low until 7pm. The meat was nice and tender.  Once I dished out the meat, I added corn starch and water to the sauce to thicken it.
I paired the pork with mashed potatoes and broccoli.
This recipe is great during the fall and winter but I may make it year round since it was so delicious! Was a hit with the entire family.

The flavor was excellent but I always feel a loin cut is just too lean for slow cooker. I've never been happy with outcome. However, I would absolutely use again with a pork butt.

As other reviews have stated, the ingredients in this recipe can make you skeptical that it will be good. This dish was delicious. I followed other reviewers recommendations and used whole cranberry sauce as well as coating the pork in salt, pepper and garlic. I let the pork sit with the ingredients overnight. I also used another reviewers suggestion of creating a rue with the sauce. I used 1T OF both butter and flour, after heating mixed in the sauce. 

I also cooked the pork on low in the slow cooker and within 6 hours it was complete. Less than I had anticipated.

This was so delicious. For once I can't think of anything that I would need to add to make this recipe more incredible. Will definitely be making this again in the future.

Excellent. My family loved it. I served it with rice and mixed vegetables.  I took suggestions, seasoned the roast with salt, pepper, and garlic. I used a can of cranberry sauce, will try it next time with whole cranberries. I thickened sauce with a too (Wondra flour and water). The sauce was good over rice too.

Easy, peasy!  I have a picky 9 year old and this was just to her liking!  The pork was so tender.  The combination of flavors was great.  Even better the next day.  I will make this again for sure!

Added some red wine and a chicken broth for liquid, but other than that, made according to the recipe. I recommend you cook it slooowly, low heat over many hours to get the tenderness. Made a great sauce and the tenderloin was delicious. Will remake.

Boy was this delicious. The only thing I changed was jellied cranberries instead of sauce which is all I had on hand. The meat was fork tender with a bit of sweet and tangy sauce. Put the sauce from the crock pot over mashed potatoes. Boyfriend LOVED it. Yep, that's what was for dinner. Will make again and again...

I used a salt and ground cinnamon dry rub, with some allspice.
I browned the pork first in a cast iron skillet
This was very successful as pulled pork.
Once cooked let the meat stand for 5 mins to rest and shred with forks.  Place the shredded pork back in the slow cooker with juice and serve on bread rolls with an apple and carrot coleslaw.  really really good!  I made this for a christmas party with the neighbours.  They asked me this year when if I am going to do it again.

Excellent!  A favorite at our house.  Be sure to use whole cranberry sauce.  Sometimes I bake it in the oven.  Sooo easy and gets rave reviews from family and company.

this was soooo tasty. i used a pork shoulder, which comes out more moist that a loin. i did not have canned cranberry sauce but did have frozen fresh cranberries, so i made sauce with that. i think next time i will leave out the french dressing. but, i loved it!

This was ok but definitely needs some seasonings for the meat.  The sauce was good but a little sweet for my son and I.

Yum!  This is wonderful!  And tender, and easy.  And, since my husband is on a strict diet, this sauce doubles as bar-b-q sauce without so much sugar.

Delicious!  Turned out great and when I took it for lunch, I was the envy of my coworkers.   Didn't change a thing; just seasoned pork roast with salt, pepper, and garlic powder.

What a way to ruin a great pork roast...8 hrs on low in slowcooker way too long - produced a very dry piece of boiled meat.  I did go with others' suggestion of Lipton Onion soup mix rather than sliced onion and the flavor was way too strong.  I love Allrecipes and have made some wonderful meals using the recipes, but this one was the worst meal I have served in years.  My grandchildren are still laughing about this disaster.

Loved it! Forgot to use salt and pepper at first, so I added it later. I mixed a few tablespoons of Wondra flour to make the gravy. Serve over rice. It was delicious and effortless!!

Really yummy and easy. I only rated it 4 stars because I had to season with salt, pepper and garlic beforehand, as per other reviewers suggestions. Without question, I would have noticed the lack had I not done so. I also used homemade cranberry sauce, given the time of year, and chopped my onions instead of sliced. Great use for leftover cranberry from the holidays

This was very good.  I seasoned it with some salt and pepper and a little bit of garlic before putting it into the crockpot.  The meat just fell apart and had very good flavor.  I made a gravy with the leftover sauce and found it too sweet.  But the meat itself was fantatic with very few ingredients.  Will make again, is a good company dish.  Thanks!

Very good!  I cooked this on low setting for about 7 hours and it was perfect.  The roast was very moist and flavorful.  I wasn't able to find French dressing so I used Zesty Catalina dressing instead.  The sauce tasted great over the roast too!

This was fantastic!  I didn't have canned cranberry sauce on hand so I used a bag of frozen berries and added sugar and water.  It wasn't quite done when we got home so I drained most of the liquid and finished it quick in the oven.  This is a great company dish.

Absolutely fabulous.  Thought the French dressing was wierd, but I was wrong.  Next time I will make it with my own homemade cranberry sauce so that the cranberry flavor is a bit more intense. But definitely will try this again.

I was skeptical but all the rave reviews convinced me to try it.  I used 3 1/2 lbs of pork tenderloin tips, a 14 oz can of whole berry sauce and Old Cape Cod honey French dressing.  I forgot to season the meat with salt & pepper, but added them with the flour I used to thicken the sauce at the end.  Wow!!!   My husband peeked at the platter and began complaining about dry pork until he took the first bite - then he went back for seconds and thirds.  I'm looking forward to trying this with chicken too.

EXCELLENT... so simple, and so good. The only thing I did differently because it was what I had on hand - whole berry Cranberry sauce and Russian dressing (increased to a cup b/c I wanted to reduce liquids to a sauce). Otherwise, followed to the directions. Served with mashed potatoes and green beans -- outstanding!

I was wary of making this esp with some picky kids, but it turned out delicious and tender.  I will definately make it again.

This was great!  Had people over for dinner last night, and everyone LOVED it:)  Since I got a late start on dinner, I did it in the oven (plus I was using a 6 lb bone in pork roast).  Sauce was very good.  Will definitely fix again.

Cooked all day in the crockpot and it was absolutely falling apart it was so tender.  The sauce/marinade gave it a nice flavor. An easy weeknight dinner.  Thank you for sharing!

I have to admit; this recipe sounded strange but was so good. I used slightly more meat and shredded the left over’s for pulled pork sandwiches the next day. Very tasty!

This was fabulous, and even better the next day reheated. I did have to cook a little longer than recommended...I did the 5 hours on high and still needed a little more time. Will make again.

This was so easy and good!  It was even better left over.  I got a fresh pork loin from the butcher and sliced my onions.  Next time I would chop the onions so they were easier to eat.  Also, I would probably cook the onions a bit ahead of time because I like them softer.  Great recipe! Thanks!

I love this pork! Its easy and tastes really good, but i also suggest salt, pepper and fresh chopped garlic to be added and i also brown my pork. I also put a tbl spoon of cornstarch in with the sauce to thicken and half the sliced onions in the sauce and half right on top!

This was super easy and delicious!  I used a 2 lb. pork tenderloin, seasoned with pepper and garlic salt.  Cooked on low for 5 hours and then on high for the last hour (wanted to make sure it WAS COOKED!)  It was so super tender and shredded easily.  I served it over white rice and both my kids loved it.  I mixed a bit of curry in it the next day and it was even better.    I think it would also be great on a sandwich roll with a dash of curry powder and chopped apple!  (Mmmmm, there's my lunch for tomorrow!)  :)  I'll, for sure, make this again.  Thanks for sharing!

This was excellent. I used the jelly kind of sauce as that was what I had on hand. I made the french dressing from the Zesty French Dressing recipe on this site. I served this over rice and added red bell peppers and onions to up the vegetable quotient. Yum!

This was very similar in taste to the Cranberry Pot Roast recipe that I LOVE.  The french dressing didn't add much of a dimension in my opinion.  Still tasted fantastic though!

this was a little disappointing, i read the reviews and thought it would be awesome....it was ok. the pork itself was good, but the sauce was like a sweet-n-sour flavor which neither of us cared for, i ended up having to make a quick gravy afterall.

My family and I loved this sauce! I did tweek it a little.  I simmered the sauce seperately for about twenty minutes or so.   To tone down the sweetness from the cranberry sauce, I added a little more french dressing plus salt and pepper.  I poured it over pork chops sauteed with onion and let simmer.  I can't wait to try it over chicken!

I'm giving this recipe only 4 stars because it totally burned in my slow cooker. I followed the directions exactly as they were listed, and cooked it on low for eight hours. At around hour seven, I started smelling something weird, and went to check on the Pork. It was totally black and the sauce was unrecognizable. The directions should have said to add some water to the crock pot to prevent burning. I do wonder, however, if I missed something, because no one else seemed to have this problem. I wouldn't be surprised if it were my fault in some way because I've never been a great cook. So try the recipe based on all the other reviewers comments! :)

This was very good and I made it exactly as the recipe stated.  I cooked it on low for 8 hours then removed the meat to a serving plate & covered with foil while I thickened the sauce with cornstarch.  I used a 3.5 pound pork loin and although tender, I thought the meat was dry.  The flavor was delicious, so I am blaming it on the pig, not the recipe or the chef (me)! The presentation was beautiful and I served it with mashed fresh sweet potatoes and broccoli for a special welcome home supper for my oldest daughter.

This was DELICIOUS. My kids loved it, and it tasted even better the next day. I didn't change a thing in the recipe. For side dishes, I had loaded mashed potatoes, corn on the cob, and green beans. Definitely a keeper.

For as easy as this was, it was pretty good- definitely had a unique flavor. I used the whole berry, but I think that next time, I will use the jellied sauce and thicken it before serving- my sauce was pretty runny.

We had this for dinner last night. Hubby and I agree with the 3-stars rating because the meat was pretty dry, but the favor was good. I used pork shoulder roast. The texture is just not what I hope to be tender and moist. The combination of French dressing and cranberry seen a bit unusual, but the sauce came out pretty nice. I will try this again, but will use different kind of pork such as boneless country ribs.

You don't really get any cranberry taste after slowcooking it.  It all got eaten, but no one was raving about it.

Really great way to cook pork! I used pork steak and pureed fresh cranberries. Goes really well with a side of mashed sweet potatoes, the flavors really complement each other.

Wow. I don'e eat meat, and work during the day, so easy, delicious ideas for dinner are always welcome.  My husband said that this is the best thing I've prepared yet (he doesn't know there's french dressing in it, thank goodness!).  I also made it for my mom who wanted the recipe.  I almost hated giving away that it was such a simple recipe!  Makes great sandwiches the next few days.

This was a easy/cheap dinner and it was a hit.  My husband is no fan of cranberry or french dressing and he loved this roast and asked me to make it again.  I served it with Sweet Potatoes.

AMAZING! I used jellied cranberry sauce and I'm glad because it made a smooth sauce. I seasoned the meat as suggested. We loved it. I served it with garlic mashed potatoes and green beans.

This is so delicious and so easy! The pork loin I used fell apart after 8 hours in the slow cooker. I changed nothing and was able to make a delicious pork gravy by taking the drippings and heating them with flour. Served with mashed potatoes and beans. WILL SERVE AGAIN!

So wonderful! My husband doesn't love cranberry, but he loved the pork. It was so tender and juicy, it just fell apart into lovely pieces. I served it with rice and green beans, and it was requested for another day as well. Wonderful recipe! Total keeper.

This was wonderful!!! Do not let the ingredients scare you. We had the leftovers as sandwiches and it was even better the 2nd night. I will double the onion next time because they turned out nice and sweet, even the kids loved them. This is one of our new family favorites.

This was pretty good. I would definitely recommend making the sauce thicker and spooning it over the slices. The flavor is VERY mild if you don't do this. We had it with stuffing which seemed to be the perfect side! I also used the whole berry cranberry sauce.

just had to say that I fixed this tonight and wow. I did not have the dressing so I used cranberry juice instead.  I also cut up about 1 jalepeno pepper into pot for an added bit of warmth (seeded and cut small). turned out Great.  fixed rice pilaf to go with and had an easy dinner waiting for me when I got home just had to fix pilaf.

This was quite tasty. The pork came out tender and not too sweet.  I added some minced garlic and salt and pepper for flavor. I was afraid the color would be red after mixing the cranberry and French dressing, but after cooking it turned a nice light brown color.  I would make this again!

I have been making this for a couple of years.  The first time I made it was for a family party.  All the guest raved over it.
I do brown the roast before I put it in the slow cooker and use whole cranberry sauce instead of jellied. I will make this all through the fall and winter.

Sadly, I was not impressed at all with this recipe - at least, as is.  The photo looks great, but what I ended up with wasn't even close.  I used a pork tenderloin and the consistency after cooking was more like pulled pork.  There also wasn't much of a cranberry flavor - the whole thing was rather bland and if anything tasted vaguely tomato-like.  I should have used whole cranberry sauce, as many reviewers suggested, rather than the jellied stuff I've never been fond of anyway.  And then, I'm not even sure if I used the "correct" French dressing - there's creamy French and "California" French, which is really Catalina.  I opted for the former and it just didn't add anything to the recipe.  It's possible that I cooked the pork a little too long - it was actually in there for more like 10-11 hours, but still, the additional time shouldn't have changed the recipe so drastically.  I doubt I'll try this again.  Waste of a perfectly good (and not cheap) pork tenderloin.

Tastes pretty good.  Instead of French dressing, I substituted Catalina dressing and it turned out well.  The dish, however, doesn't look very appetizing - but, looks can be deceiving.  Thanks for sharing!

I made this a few days ago for dinner. It was very simple to make and the pork came out wonderfully tender. The only change I made was to add some garlic. However, something appeared to be missing. I can't put my finger on it. I will probably make this again, but try to tweak it a bit.

didn't have time to do this in the crockpot so i carmalized 2 baseball sized onions with 3 minced cloves of garlic in olive oil, browned the tenerloin for about 5 minutes on each side, added the cranberry mix and simmered for 2 hours.  this is a very easy, delicious recipe.

This is tasty and went over well with my family.  I added a tbsp or 2 of spicy mustard and some extra garlic, and also used a tsp or so of onion powder instead of the sliced onion.  Also seared it on all sides to help maintain moisture in the roast.

This was pretty good.  The ease of it all bumped it up even more.  I used whole cranberry sauce, seasoned my pork loin roast liberally with salt and pepper and minced garlic.  My husband didn't like it quite as much as I did, though I can't imagine why not.  Since he wasn't blown away I'm not sure if I'll make it again, but at least I thought it was very good.

This was okay. It didn't taste bad, but it didn't wow me, either. It needs something--maybe red pepper flakes or mushrooms or some teriyaki sauce or something. I am not sure. It was very easy, and I do appreciate that.

Can you say yummy!!  I was hesitant on making this recipe, the frech salad dressing just threw me, didn't think it would taste good.  But I tried it based on all the reviews and I'm glad I did.  It was so good my husband took leftovers for lunch today, which is always a good sign and I'm having my portion of the leftovers for lunch!  So thank you for the recipe, it's a keeper!!

WOW!!! I made this for my family for Super Bowl Sunday and we all just loved it. I do not own a slowcooker, so I put in the the oven at 250 degrees for about 5 hours. Next time I may drop the temp to about 225 and cook it longer. But even at 5 hours, the meat was falling apart with just a fork.

Yes, it doesn't look like much but the flavor is great!  I used onion soup mix instead of the onion and pork chops.  We served it over rice and everyone (even the little ones) ate it happily!  I will make this again!

I thought this tasted all right, but probably won't make again. Nobody that tried it just loved it, and it wasn't all that pretty to look at. Guess we'd rather have our pork with barbecue sauce.

This was delicious and very moist.  I used a frozen pork loin, so I cooked it on high for 2 hours and then on low for another 5 hours.

Good!  I followed the recipe - except added seasoned salt, pepper, and garlic.  Cooked for 8 hrs and the sauce was very "jammy".  It actually tasted similar to a recipe I make using pork ribs - and had none of the same ingredients!

This was just awful.  The sauce had very little flavor (no spice) and was certainly not something I would eat over rice.  My husband ate about 3 bites before pushing his plate away.  Needless to say, it went in the garbage.

Like other reviewers I substituted a pork tenderloin with a boneless pork loin.
 Because of the moist heat of the crockpot, the meat was fall-apart tender.
 I intend to use this recipe again but I will follow the suggestion of another reviewer & use whole cranberry sauce vs. gel cranberry sauce.
 There's room for more flavor, maybe increase the amount of onions, add some garlic.
 I'd love to hear from others about adding veggies, potatoes maybe? 
 Thank you, Dawn
 Dinner couldn't be easier.

I think it would be better using another cut of pork instead of tenderloin.If you can't watch the cooking on this it tends to  overcook the pork and you don't want to do that to a tenderloin. I wasn't crazy about the flavor but my husband liked it..Thanks Dawn

I got a slow cooker for christmas and wanted to use it.  I made this with chicken and it was excellent.  My son, who is a very picky 10 year old thought it was great and would eat it again.  Was even better the second day.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This was great.  It wasn't too "cranberry-y." My husband doesn't like cranberry anything and thought that this was just a great BBQ sauce until I told him.  HE said it is a definite keeper.  I've used a bone-in pork roast as well as boneless pork ribs and cooked on low for about 6 hours and it was incredibly tender.  The "gravy" was nice on white rice.

Turned out well.  Used 1 kg pork roast and 389 mL can of whole cranberry sauce.  Pork did not taste like cranberries at all, but was very tender and moist.  Sauce was very watery after cooking and had quite a bit of fat, so I made a separate gravy.

This was wonderful! I don't even like French dressing or pork, and I give this 5 stars--as did my husband. FYI, I cooked a 1.84 lb. bone-in pork roast for 4 hrs., 45 mins. on "low" and it was perfectly cooked and moist. We'll make this many more times. I didn't do the garlic/salt/pepper rub that another reviewer did, and maybe next time I'll omit the onions (though they were subtle). Yum!

We had this last night and just loved it.  I made it with chicken.  Cooked on high for only 3.5 hours, and was very moist. I took the chicken off the bone and served it with the sauce over a bed of rice. Even the kids had seconds.

This was delicious.  My husband loved it; even my son loved it and he's not much of a pork eater.  I used Thousand Island Dressing because I didn't have French and prior to putting it in the slow cooker I rubbed it with garlic, salt and pepper.  We had leftovers so the following day they had sandwiches with mayonnaise and raved about them also.  My son wants to know when I will make it again.  Thanks Dawn!

This is the easiest thing in the world to cook so long as you allow the time. Recipe didn't specify, but I used whole cranberry sauce.  The flavor went all the way through and the sauce served on the side was tasty. You can't even tast the dressing; don't be turned off if you don't like french dressing. Slow cooked meat can be over cooked, so don't put in too early or for too long.

For two of us - one a picky eater and one not - we were both disappointed. Followed all directions.  Cranberry texture was like paste.  So bad that I let the leftovers sit in the fridge to see if he'd eat it.  Nope.  Next recipe...

I checked the reviews before making this. I used Honey French  dressing which is like Catalina French. It came out pretty good. The 2nd time I made it without looking up the recipe, I ended up using 1/2 cup of dressing instead of 1/4. It came out a bit more favorable the second time :)  We loved it and I will be making it again. It was a very easy recipe to follow .

Hubby didn't care for it. I thought it was good,   Maybe the pork roast I used had too much fat on it, but it was very tender.

I made this with every ingredient listed but instead of French dressing, I used a tangy bacon catalina.dressing and it gave the meat a nice hint of smoke flavoring. Very good. Will make again.

I used Italian instead of French dressing. I wished the cranberry came thru stronger, slow cooker made it more watery and washed out flavor a bit. Will defonitely do again.

The taste is fabulous but the sauce could be thicker. The meat fell apart like pulled pork, maybe since I left it sitting on warm till we were ready to eat. Would make it again. Since I don’t use French dressing I made my own from a recipe, and I’m wondering if I should have left out the sugar in it, being that I made the cranberry sauce myself as well, with sugar. Thanks for the recipe!

I finally bought a slow cooker, so I've been trying some simple recipes. This looked easy enough. I  put the pork loin in a skillet to cook the outside on all sides just until browned and I used canned cranberry sauce. I cooked it on low for about 7 1/2 hours and it was delicious. I'm not sure if cooking it that long caused it to fall apart (not sliced like recipe photo) but it was very tender.

I t was good! I salt/peppered the meat and added garlic powder heavily. I only had 8 oz. of cranberries and used 2 tblsp of Russian dressing because I didn't have any French and didn't feel like making it.  My roast was small.  I did not expect such a tasty roast.

I was like everyone else...  it sounds too odd to be good... but the end result was great!.  I read a lot of reviews and put salt and pepper on the pork loin and added a few hot pepper flakes..  Did not have French dressing so I found an easy recipe on line... I never use French dressing, but in this it works.. I really enjoyed the meal with green beans and mashed potatoes. ..

I thought this was fantastic! I used the canned cranberries w the whole berries, and added a little flour at the end to thicken the sauce, otherwise spot on. Was done much quicker than the time states. Served w mashed pots. YUMM

What weird ingredients but came out soooo good! I used a BIG onion. I did not have to thicken sauce.  It was thin but was awesome. I did on high for 4 hours. So tender. It shredded nicely.

I wasn't sure I really liked this but everyone else loved it. My pork roast was smaller than what was called for so I ended up with a lot of extra liquid after it was done.  I saved the liquid and simmered pork chops in it for another dinner. I think if I try this recipe again, I will try substituting the vinegar with wine. The only vinegar in this recipe is in the French dressing and as I make my own, it may have been a little more vinegar than works in this dish. That being said, I used the leftover sauce slow cooking pork chops... Superb!

So easy and simply delicious.  Use the whole berry cranberry sauce.  Made exactly as directed.  Cooked down the sauce until it was thick and topped the sliced roast with it.  Can't go wrong!

Delicious, way better than with the onion soup mix. I also seasoned with salt and pepper, and added a peeled diced apple to the mixture. Both my teenage boys loved it, even the one that doesn't like meat! This recipe is definitely a keeper. Thank you for posting it!

I made this but due to being in a rush I changed the recipe a bit. I used Catalina dressing instead of French (it's what the store had and I saw another reviewer did the same), I added an extra can of the cranberry sauce but with whole berries and I didn't want to chop an onion (dirty dishes) so I used a packet of onion soup mix. IT TURNED OUT AMAZING.  The pork was a little dry, but with the sauce on it, it was fine.  A bit of the tanginess was lost when reheated, but my boyfriend preferred the sweeter sauce. It's his new favorite pork dish, I will be making again.

I did not make any changes. Found it a little dry so will shorten the cooking time. Will definitely make it again. Gravey is great.

This is a very simple recipe to make, but I feel like it is missing something to take it to  5 stars. Some kind of contrast herb or spice to cut the sweetness of the cranberry and french dressing might improve this.

I liked  it,  my pork hating and pregnant daughter  was not impressed.  Most of the family liked the sauce.  I may try scaring up a recipe for French dressing and try it with homemade cranberry sauce.  I don't do HFCS and used red pepper vinaigrette instead of the French.

Very simple-very good! As others have pointed out, season pork first  I used salt fresh ground pepper and garlic powder. Through whole dish together and into crock pot in five minutes before going to work. Came home to a tasty dinner. Pork was moist, tender and flavorful through the entire roast!

This recipe is simple and makes a very good meal for a busy family.  My kids really like it and it has quickly become one of my husband's favorite dishes.  He wants me to fix it almost weekly.  When we ran out of store-bought French dressing, it was nice to find the Ruby French Dressing recipe.  About a 1/8th version of the Ruby French Dressing recipe is all you need for this dish.

My mom showed me how to make this and it is super easy and delicious!  Instead of onions she told me to use 1 packet of Lipton Onion Soup.  I love that you can prepare this in your slow cooker the night before and then cook it on low all day while you are at work.

Simple and tastes great. I have made this recipe many times, today with pork chops. 
I use this combination of caramelized onions and whole berry cranberry sauce for my go to cranberry sauce, after having it served at a restaurant under steak.  Delicious .

Made this as directed with only one change. I put salt, pepper, and garlic on tenderloin. Cooked on low for 8 hours and it was incredibly tender and moist. Hubby doesn't really care for pork and loved this, our 9 year old had seconds.

This was amazing!  We rubbed some garlic,  salt & pepper in the meat before we placed it in the crock pot as recommended,  and cooked it on high for 4 hours.  It could have gone another hour maybe,  but still amazingly simple and one of our new favorites.

A strange combination but ends up out of this world! Easy and so good. I've made it several times with different cuts of pork and always good. It's not the same with chicken but still good.

This was great. I had to change a few things due to what I had. I had to make my own cranberry sauce. Which I used one cup of freshly squeezed smartie juice, one cup of sugar and a package of frozen cranberries. With the glaze I used raspberry vinaigrette. My family LOVED it. I am making it again tonight, only I used oranges this time and added chopped jalapeno. Thank you for this delicious recipe.

Outstanding!  Made it for Thanksgiving (with homemade cranberry sauce), and it was so very delicious!  I just got another pork loin to make it again and will make it over and over!

I did use two cans of whole berry cranberry sauce 14oz each. I Didn't have any French dressing on hand so I substituted thousand Island instead. I am in the process of enjoying this now! I can not believe how delicious this is! Great find!

For those of us who are in love with our pressure cookers..this recipe can be easily adapted. I followed the recipe as stated with a few modifications as suggested by other reviewers. Liberally salt and pepper your pork roast before browning. I added a sliced onion and garlic at the very end of the browning process. I used whole cranberry sauce and added quite a few shakes of crushed red pepper to balance out the sweet and tart flavor of the dish. I added a half cup of water to my pressure cooker to insure the sauce and roast would not stick and burn. I cooked the roast for one hour on the lowest pressure setting of my pressure cooker. While letting the meat rest I reduced the sauce..threw in a handful of dried cranberries..and thickened with cornstarch. The sauce is sweet and savory..a very nice change from the everyday gravy. Absolutely serve this with mashed sweet potatoes and your choice of a vegetable. Delicious straight from your pressure cooker..even better the next day!

We totally enjoyed this recipe tonight.  It was delicious.  I took the juices out of the pan afterward and I poured them into a roux (butter and flour) and it made an amazing gravy.  I also paired it with my own apple craisin compote.  I'll post the recipe.  Absolutely amazing.

Glass baking dish. Cranberry sauce, straight from can, over meat. Minced onion layered on top. Tented foil Cooked at 255F for 4 and half hours, checking for doneness with a meat thermometer. Made brown gravy with the juices while meat rested.

Made this a couple of nights ago. Did as others have suggested and rubbed the roast w/salt, pepper & granulated garlic.  Then pan seared it before placing in the crock pot.  It was D-lish AND easy!

My husband hates salad dressing of any kind & is not too fond of cranberry sauce either. Caught me putting this together & declared he was going to open himself a can of soup for dinner. Guess who tasted it &  says I can make this any time I want! He loved it!! I used two pork chops & half the amount of the rest of the ingredients. Next time, it has been suggested (by guess who) to make the whole recipe!  Quick & easy to prepare - Thanks Dawn!

This was delightful!  I have to admit I could never make a pork roast that I was completely happy with, until this came along. I made this today when I was having a guest for dinner and I received rave reviews.  It was so moist and delicious.  The only change I made was to take someone elses suggestion and add some corn starch to thicken the sauce up.  We are looking forward to the leftovers tonight.  Thanks, I will be using this recipe again!

Overall, I thought it was a pretty good meal to put together very quickly. I followed other reviewers advice and seasoned it with salt, pepper, and garlic before hand. I added cornstarch near the end to thicken up the gravy. Will make again.

This is so delicious and so very easy.  My family loves it.  It tastes like I spent a a lot of time making it, but it's prepared in a snap.  It's kinda like a chutney.  Was great Christmas Day.  Was a pretty presentation.  The only thing I changed is that I did not add the onion because my boys don't like it.  Oh, one more thing:  I used a garlic and herb pork loin, and the flavor was great!

Fixed exactly as written, except used a bone in pork butt roast, as that is what I had. My husband pronounced it "wonderful". Next time I think I will mix the juice from the roast with cornstarch to make a lovely gravy. Great recipe....thanks!

I used 2 bone-in pork chops, 1/2 cup berried cranberry sauce and a good splash of french salad dressing.  No onion ( didn't appeal to me).  Put it in cooker on high for about 4 hours; ended up with very tender chops (they had an excellent fllavor) and a cranberry "gravy".  Good with potato pancakes and green salad for quick and easy dinner.

3.5 stars.  It was good, but my BF didn't care for it.  he hates all slow-cooker food, though.  I seasoned the tenderloin liberally with salt, pepper, onion powder, and garlic powder, then seared it before placing in the cooker.  I used Catalina dressing and leftover cranberry relish I had made for T-day.  I added a chicken boullion cube, salt, red pepper flakes, and minced garlic to the dressing.  I cooked on high for 3.5 hours.  I liked it at least.

Very delicious.  I didn't think it would be, but it was.  I made it according to the recipe, except I only used half of an onion.  It smelled bad once it was cooked, but it tasted great!  I like the idea of thickening the sauce with cornstarch and will try that next time around--awesome recipe!  I'll be making this again!

Great! I added about a cup of water and 16 oz of sliced mushrooms, and that helped make it tasty and a bit less sweet. Delicious.

4 stars only because I didn't make it in a slowcooker. I was in a hurry to make dinner and really wanted to see what this cranberry/french dressing mystery tasted like.  I used 6 boneless pork chops. Seasoned with s&p and browned in pan. Then added the onions, cranberry and dressing.  Also took a reviewers tip on some corn starch in OJ to thicken the sauce.  I let it come to a boil and simmer for a an 1.5 hrs.  Was even better the next day when I warmed it up in the pan.  It's a sweet festive taste. Like when you have turkey, mash potatoes, gravy and cranberry sauce all together. That type taste. I enjoyed it.

Quick and easy to put together. I also rubbed the roast with garlic, salt and pepper and added  the onion soup mix instead of fresh onion. The family enjoyed this meal.

Super easy and tasty!  Instead of sliced onion, I mixed in a packet of dried Onion Soup mix.  This thickened the sauce a bit and made it even more savory!  Good served with rice, noodles or potatoes.  A huge hit with my family. (I have also done this with chicken with equally positive results.)

It was alright.  I took other users advice and rubbed salt, pepper, and garlic on it really well.  It still came out a little bland.  The cranberry sauce did add a fun flavor, but the meat itself needed something more.  Then again, I am notoriously picky.  My boyfriend and roommate thought it was good.  But no one thought it was great.

I tried this but we didn't like it as well as one I have been making for several years.   I always season my roast with seasoned pepper and brown it before slow cooking it. Mix 1 can of whole berry cranberry sauce with 1/4 cup of honey, and 1/4 teaspoon of ground cloves and 1/4 tsp nutmeg/or cinnamon pour the mixture over the pork roast and cook. I have added carrots and potatoes for a complete meal, or just carrots and serve with mashed potatoes.

I followed this recipe to the tee, except I used a turkey tenderloin.  It was okay.  To me, the sauce had a strange, ho-hum flavor.  Nothing to write home about.

This was really, really good. I doubled the meat and probably should have doubled the cranberry sauce and french dressing too, but I didn't. I cooked two three-pound pork loin portions five hours on high. I did thicken the liquid leftover in the crock pot with some corn starch. I could have seasoned the meat more, I didn't end up using any garlic and wish I would have. My version of it was ever-so-slightly bland, but the meat was tender and everyone loved it. Next time I'll definitely kick up the seasonings!

This was suprisingly good given the combination of ingredients. Very easy. Came out extremely tender. Served it with rice pilaf and green beans and was a hit, though not "wow" enough for 5 stars. Will be making it again though.

This receipe was really good. I changed it up a bit because of another recipe I saw. I added a can of crushed pineapple along with the whole cranberry and nutmeg and cloves and didnt use the salad dressing or onion. I also seasoned the porkloin with onion and garlic powder and pan fried it quickly till it was brown. Then threw all the ingredients in the slow cooker and added chicken stock to cover the meat. I put it on for 6 hours on high. The pork loin pulled apart very easily and was quite yummy. Served it with brown rice and asparagus for myself, hubby had green beans instead! we had plenty of leftovers so we can make some pulled pork sandwiches another day.

I made this for dinner tonight, and it was pretty good. I think the recipe may need a little tweaking though. I used thick-cut boneless pork chops instead of a tenderloin, and they turned out a little tough but that was probably my fault. The sweet and tangy together work great, and I think I'll be having this for dinner again soon.

Wow!  I'm shocked at how good this is!  Following advice of others, I used whole cranberry sauce and browned the meat first.  I cooked on high 4 hours, and left to warm for 2 more.  I used a pork  loin roast, and it was fantastic. No issues with meat falling apart, but it was OH SO TENDER!

I can not give this recipe an honest rating since Wal-mart did not have any canned cranberry, just the jellied cranberry. But the pork was on sale so I wanted to use it. So I used a jar of the Great Value Pineapple Salsa and added several cloves of crushed garlic. It was delicious. Family loved it that night and for sandwiches later.

i thought this was soooo yummy. i had to share it with 2 neighbors and they both went to get ingreients to make it for their families for dinner. i made it with chicken because i am not a huge pork fan, i also doubled the cranberry and dressing because i was scared it wouldnt be enough liquid in the crock pot. served with steamed carrots and stuffing on the side this is a keeper.thanks for sharing.

This was good.  I made a mistake and put a 8 oz bottle of french dressing, so I doubled the cranberry sauce.  Seasoned the pork tenderloin before putting it in the crock pot.  Have to believe it is even better if I had put in the right amount of dressing.  Nevertheless it is still good.

Maybe I did something wrong, but this wasn't as good as I expected - the tenderloin came out dry.  I probably should have doubled the sauce so the meat was completely submerged in the sauce, but I don't think I'll make it again.

My family hates cranberries, so of course I didn't tell them until after they'd finished raving about how delicious it was! I followed other reviewers' advice and coated the roast with seasoned flour and seared it in a pan first. Absolutely fabulous. Will become part of the regular winter rotation.

I thought the whole idea of a slow cooker was to set it and forget it.  I prepared it on low for 8.  It was dry and more like pulled pork.  The recipe states 8 hours or the internal temp of 160.  How are you going to know the internal temp, unless you open it to check.  This is defeating the purpose of a slow cooker,  it should not be opened.  My opinion change the cook time on low to 6 or 7 hours.  It will continue to cook, after you take it out.  It's also a good thing I didn't let the cooker switch over to keep warm setting or I wasn't home to take it out.

I gotta say I too was skeptical given the ingredient list, but this was very good.  The recipe didn't specify so I used a can of whole cranberry sauce & creamy light french dressing.  I love coming home to such wonderful cooking smells and my boss seemed to think it smelled great when I had the leftovers for lunch today.  Its a keeper THANKS!!

not as tart as I would like - maybe try sour cherries instead.
Use some cornstarch in the beginning or some flour after it's cooked.... just don't add too much flour - it will taste floury.

This recipie was delicious and incredibly easy.  My husband was drooling as soon as he stepped in the door.  I was in such a hurry that when I prepared it, I forgot to season the meat as suggested by other reviewers, but it was still great.  I added walnuts to the slowcooker about 2 hours into the cooking since I love any kind of nut in just about anything and that was a yummy addition.  Highly recommed this recipie!

this recipe was just OK for me.  I would suggest doctoring it up a little with some onion soup mix or other spices as some other reviewers mentioned.  It was edible, but I won't make it again.

Not a whole lot of flavor.  For us, the cranberry sweetness does not go well with pork.  Will never make this again.

We love this pork recipe. I am not a big pork loin person, but this is great. We serve it over white rice. I use a whole bottle of catalina dressing, one can of jellied cranberry sauce and one can of whole cranbeery sauce. The sauce is thin, but great over rice.. even the next day.

This was very tasty and gets an extra star for being so easy to make.  The sauce is excellent with mashed potatoes.

This was ok. It seems to be lacking something. The sauce wasn't as impressive as I was expecting from some of the reviews. It was kind of a strange, weak taste. The meat was good though.

Very moist and yummy. I am not a big fan of pork roasts, but this came out great. And all my kids loved it, a huge deal in itself. I made it just like the recipe says and used the juice afterward to pour all over the pork. Um, um, good!

This was pretty good, I thought the sauce was a little weird. I LOVE the cranberry roast so I expected something more like that. This was more sweet/tangy. Put the sauce over mashed potatoes and Hubby said he would like to have it again.

The pork had a wonderful flavor and the cranberry sauce/dressing mixture made yummy gravy (served over homemade whipped potatoes).  I gave it 4 stars  because it was very dry and chewey, not moist at all...next time I will cook it 7 hours(as other recommended)instead of 8 and I am sure hubby will give it a 5 star rating!!

Loved this recipe!! I may have overcooked the pork by a little.  I would suggest on low setting for 6 1/2 to 7 hours tops.  The meat was extremely tender but could have been a little juicier.  But overall will absolutely make again and again. Easy and delicious.

I made this recipe today because I needed a recipe that would be company ready after a very busy day.  What a winner!  Everyone raved and had seconds.  As my guest commented, only 4 ingredients and they are all things you have on hand anyway.  Yummy and easy.  This one's a winner.

Delicious and very easy!  Everyone in the family loved it.  It does make lots of "gravy", but we didn't find that to be a drawback!

This recipe is wonderful!!  I was a little unsure about the cranberry and dressing, but the flavor is great.  I cook for a group home for boys, and it's so easy to put in the slow cooker and have everything ready.  I have to use 3 1/2 pounds of pork roast, but it turns out so tender you could cut it with a fork.  I use a very large pork tenderloin.  I wouldn't change anything in the recipe.  Thanks!

Nice change.  I used bone-in chicken instead of pork and by the time it was done, the meat was falling off the bone.  My hubby loved it, but the kids did not like the sauce.  I thought it was good....a nice sweet flavor, but I doubt I will make it on a regular basis due to the kids opinion.

Wow...what can I say.  This was a perfect and moist pork dish.  My family loved it.  At first my hubby was afraid to make it but after he did he was happy with it.  I will definitely make it again for the family.

I first had this recipe almost 10 years ago and it was made with bone-in chicken breasts and baked in the oven instead of a crockpot. Loved it then and I can't wait to try it with pork.  Thanks!

This was delicious.  I cooked a  small tenderloin for 4 hours on high and I used a cranberry sauce that had whole cranberries in it.  The sauce looked and tasted great served over the pork.

I made this for Valentine's Day. My boyfriend gave it 3 1/2 stars and I gave it 4. It was very tender and tasty. I will make it again. I cooked it all day while I was at work, but next time I will try it on high for 4 hours to see if it is better. This would be good with chicken too.

I really wanted to like this. I love cranberry sauce and all of the other igredients. This was not good at all. I was very dissapointed in the appearance and taste.

This was one of the best recipes that I have found for a pork roast!! Not only did the adults love the roast and the gravy but my 2 year old granddaughter gobbled it up and she is a very picky eater!!

My kids loved this and they do not usually eat pork, and we served it with fluffy noodles and green beans.  It is in our family file for dinner!!

This was wonderful.  All three kids and husban ate like refugees!  I used Catalina Honey dressing, but I think it would have been with the French. I used the whole cranberries and it made a nice looking sauce when pored over the sliced meat.

This is a fantastic recipe and so easy.  The combination is a bit strange but don't let it put you off.  Will be kept among my favourites.
