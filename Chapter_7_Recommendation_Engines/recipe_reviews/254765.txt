How can you go wrong with fried plantains and avocado? Easily a five star recipe. I couldn't quite see the need to oil a work surface and use a coffee cup to flatten them out so I folded a piece of parchment paper, placed the plantains in between, and flattened them with the smooth side of a meat tenderizer.  The only change I made was to use garlic salt in place of the garlic and salt.
