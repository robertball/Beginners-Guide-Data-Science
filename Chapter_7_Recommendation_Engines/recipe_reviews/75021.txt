Microwave cream cheese only 17 secounds. Cook Fish 25 min. Go easy on the lemon juice in sauce. Make extra sauce. Left out lemon pepper. Substitute 1/2 tsp dry dill for every tblsp of fresh dill. Use butter instead of Margarine.

My family loved this... but I gave it only 4 stars because I changed it quite a bit. 
First, I breaded the fish with a mixture of bread crumbs, dill, and garlic.  Then fried the fish in olive oil.  To make the sauce, I used a little less lemon like other reviewers, but added some milk to thin the sauce a bit.  I also added some chopped onion to give the sauce a kick.  All in all, very tasty.

Very good. I cut back 1/2 way on the lemon- for both recipies. I also tripled the cream cheese sauce. Needs salt. Good basic recipe, you could really do a lot with this. Will make again.

When I made this my husband commented that he "didn't really like fish, but thought this was delicious".  The Dill Sauce was amazingly delicious.  I would use less lemon next time.  It was a bit tart.

This was suberb!  Instead of microwave, I used a small saucepan on the stove.  Next time, I'll use less lemon juice for a richer cream cheese taste vs the lemon.  Excellent & a keeper!  Thank you!

My daughters were a little skeptical of the sauce, but after tasting it they cleaned their plates. I used about 1/2 tablespoon of dry dill weed instead of fresh in the sauce.

I doubled this recipe for a family gathering, and it was a big hit. Followed previous suggestions to cut lemon juice in the sauce down by half, and it turned out great. Additional suggestion, make the sauce ahead of time so the dill's full flavor can come out. 
Over all, nice and light, would definitely make again!

The fish itself was very good.  Used real butter and dried dill (a little less than half the amount of the fresh listed).  The sauce, however...I love creamy sauce and this was much too tart with only barely half the lemon juice called for (and again, less than half amount dried dill) and triple the cream cheese.  I made a tarter-type sauce for the fish and that was much better.  If you do like the sauce, be aware that, as listed, it only makes a very small amount.

The sauce was both bitter and tart.  We scraped it off, but there was so much lemon baked into the fish that it was still too tart to eat.  Maybe it would be good with WAY less lemon.

I thought this was pretty good. I had this for lunch today and served the fish on a fresh bed of spinach. The heat from the fish wilts the spinach just the right amount. I found the sauce too thick. Next time I will have to add some milk or cream. I just used the amount of lemon juice I thought I would like since a lot of the reviews were cutting back on the lemon.

This was great! After reading other reviews, I decided that the sauce recipe should be 4 TABLEspoons of cream cheese and 5 TEAspoons lemon juice. I made it that way and my family and I really enjoyed it. I will make this again.

Very quick and easy! I doubled the cream cheese and used a combination of half & half, water, and lemon juice in place of the lemon juice part of the sauce. I also added chopped chives and a little grated parmesean cheese to the sauce. Seasoned the fish before baking. Baked for 25 min, and served with rice. De-lish!

The sauce on this is amazing - the lemon juice was just a little much, but other than that - delicious.  Thanks for the post.

Tilapia is not common in my country so I used a mild, white fish (hammour). I didn't not put on lemon pepper (since I don't have any) and just dashed freshly ground sea salt & pepper on the fish. I followed another reviewer and toned down the lemon in sauce. Next time I will cut it in half. The best part of the meal is that my hubby and 6 year old each had at least a 5 oz portion and my 4 year old liked it too.

I added less lemon and more cream cheese after reading other reviews.  I also used dried tarragon instead of dill because I didn't have any dill.

I just love this recipe!  i eat it all the time.  I eat it with rice and green beans.  sometimes i replace the dill with basil, depending on how i feel...and i agree...mess with the ratios of lemon and cream cheese depending on your tastes...i add a little butter to the sauce as well...you can never have too much butter! haha

Great, easy and quick.  I wrap the tilapia in foil to cook so there's not so much need for oil.  I put just a little bit of olive oil rather than butter.  Also, I don't have lemon pepper, so I just use lemon juice liberally and sprinkle with black pepper.

The fish was good; The sauce was terrible. Sauce had a very acidic & overpowering lemon flavor.  I followed the directions exactly.  In the end, I used the entire 4 oz. package of cream cheese and some regular cream just to try & neutralize the lemony taste.

Super easy, but very heavy on the lemon and butter. I cut both in half.

Delicious!  I made some of the previously suggested changes, and my whole family really enjoyed the dish.  I cut way back on the lemon in the cream sauce, and also only put the cream cheese mixture in the micro on 50% power for 20 seconds.

Loved this. I substituted lemon for lime and used dried dill. I used waaaay more dill than I was supposed to because I wasn't paying attention and used the same amount as it called for for fresh. As my bf said, "it looks like I cut the grass over the fish." But despite that, it was still awesome. Used 3 tbsp in the sauce instead of 5, added a little extra cream cheese. it is a bit tart, but I love that citrusy taste. will definitely make again!!!

Seasoning for fish OK. However, I completely changed the sauce as even using only 1 teasp of lemon juice way too much.  I added about a Tblspn of lite Miracle Whip & maybe a teasp of sweet pickle juice & it was much better.  Actually, I believe you could use dill in some tartar sauce and add about a Tblspn of cream cheese and that would work too.

I followed the recipe exactly, except halving the amount of lemon juice, spinach cream cheese instead of regular and enough milk to thin out the sauce. The taste was still overly lemon-y, and the sauce more like a dip in consistency without adding the milk. Won't make again.

I think the fish tastes much better without the creamy sauce. The lemon taste overpowers everything else and it's sour!

One of the best recipes I have tried.  I used sole instead of tilapia.  I'm sure any light fish would be great.  The only changes I made and I thought it made a huge difference, was change the lemon to 2 tsp and I sauteed some shallots and used them in the sauce.  TFS.  I can't wait to make it again.

I agree that as written it would have been far too much lemon juice. I added some more cream cheese as well as a dollop of sour cream to the sauce. I think I am going to try sauteing some zucchini, onions and perhaps mushrooms to add to the sauce to pour over the fish. It needed a bit more substance.. This is a good start for a lot of modifications.

EVEN THOSE WHO DON'T REALLY LIKE FISH WILL LIKE THIS RECIPE.  YOU CAN ADJUST THE THICKNESS/THINNESS OF THE SAUCE WITH THE CREAM CHEESE AND LEMON JUICE. I MADE MORE OF THE SAUCE (THICKER) TO SERVE WITH SMALL NEW POTATOES AS A SIDE DISH.

i gave this four stars because i have only made it once but i think it has a lot of potential. i tripled the sauce as well, but the lemon was too much and i actually cut out one tablespoon of it in the sauce. next time i am going to trying half the lemon the original recipe calls for. my husband on the other hand didn't think it was too tart. great starter recipe!!!

I made this dish for my husband and I and I actually added more lemon and more dill, and before I added the lemon I stuck a fork in the fish so the lemon would sink in. I thought it came out really well and we've never been a fan of baking fish. I will definitely be making it again.

Really? 1 minute 10 seconds for the cream cheese sauce?? Way way too much. I wasn't thinking at first and did that just like the recipe said. The cream and lemon juice curdled and I poured it down the drain. I did it again for about 15 seconds and it was great. Good taste overall. Will do it again.

I mixed the baking sauce together and brushed it on the talapia and baked it as directed.  While baking I made the "serving" sauce. It was far too harsh with 5 tablespoons of lemon juice, the cream cheese didn't tone it down a bit, so I just started adding sour cream and whisking it in until I arrived at an acceptable level of tartness (1/2 cup sour cream) plus I added a 1/4 teaspoon granulated garlic.  With the adjustments it was a very good dish.  
In todays hard economic times Talapia is a great way to get our twice a week fish dinner at just 4.99 a pound, it's an inexpensive dinner for two senior citizens.  Thanks for the recipe!

both my husband and I thought it was too much dill. Would maybe better if this was cut down. Might try with some tweaks of less dill and lemon. The sauce did not mix very well either. Just not a winner for us.

Loved the fish. I didn't have lemon-pepper, so it was omitted. Plus there was lemon juice in the recipe so I just added some black pepper, along with dill. I spritzed the fillets with "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter" since my Pam was not butter-flavored, and drizzled with melted margarine and lemon juice before baking.  I made the accompanying sauce, but did not serve it. I did not like it at all (used half the lemon as suggested). Instead, I quickly made a simple tartar sauce, and dinner was delicious.  Served with brown rice and fresh spinach.

I gave this 4 stars because of all the changes that I needed to make. Otherwise this is a fantastic dish! Changes: 1) If you are using dry dill, use half the amount specified. 2) Use less lemon juice. I used half but thought it still needed to be toned down. 3) Make a LOT of extra sauce. My sauce was thick and delicious, but I think I'll add a bit of milk to thin it next time. 4) I baked it for 25 minutes.  As a side note, I made "Baby Carrots with Dill Butter" for my vegetable side. It fit perfectly!

This turned out well. I did half the lemon juice and it still turned out alittle tart. I think bread crumbs would help this recipe out.

I changed this a lot. Added a breadcrumb crust tsp butter melted a few tbs bread crumb fresh grated romano and dill, sprinkle on top. Lemon to taste in all, thinned cream cheese sauce with cream, make sure you season fish well (salt pepper dry dill lemon butter). Cooked for 20 minutes, would have been raw otherwise. Then broiled for 5 minutes to brown crust well. Big hit after adjustments.

This was really good and easy to make. I decided not to use as much lemon juice as called for after reading previous reviews.The cream sauce was easy and tasty. Will probably make again! Thanks for a new way to top tilapia.

Very good! Only change I made was to use Neufatchel in place of the cream cheese. I probably wouldn't use the lemon pepper again on this, but that's just my tastes. Thanks for sharing :)

So easy and yummy. I do cut the lemon juice down a bit and do more cream cheese for a creamier sauce.

My husband said this meal was "Impressive". I modified the recipe based on the other reviews. I reduced the lemon juice by half. I used alot more cream cheese (about 6-8 table spoons) and added a little heavy whipping cream to loosen it up. I served this with steamed asparagus and drizzled the sauce over the fish and the asparagus. It was UMMMM MMMM GOOD!

I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to disagree with most of the reviewers here. I followed the recipe to the letter...and it was the oddest tasting thing I have ever had.  It was too lemony/tart...and the cream cheese did not go well with the fish.  Maybe it's just not my taste...

It was very easy to make. I thank everybody in the previous reviews for the warning of too much lemon. A hit with my husband. I added a little white wine to thin the sauce out a little. I was very good. Thank you.

This was very good, definitely cut the lemon for the sauce at least by half.  I also thinned the sauce with a bit of whole milk.  I also added a dash of white pepper and a dash of ground red pepper in the sauce (I didn't do the lemon pepper on the fish), which spiced the sauce a bit and was really delicous.  You could do so many things with a basic sauce like this.

The lemon in this recipe completely ruined the recipe for us. Use the lemon juice VERY sparingly. I gave this recipe 3 stars because I think it would be good with just a teaspoon or two of lemon juice.

I almost couldn't eat this because it had so much lemon in it.  I'll have to make it again with a lot less lemon.

It's a good start, but I did make a few changes. I added garlic, garlic powder and extra dill. I omitted the extra lemon juice.  I also added heavy whipping cream. I served it over rice and it was great!

I made this for my boyfriend and we both loved it! I did cut the sauce's lemon juice in half, and added extra cream cheese - I only had whipped cream cheese with chives, and it really added some nice flavor. We'll definately have this again!

This recipe has potential but the cream sauce is way, way, way too sour! I think that the cream sauce needs no lemon juice at all as there is enough in the marinade. Next time I make it I will try it that, way hopefully it will be better.

This was OK. Like most others, it was way too lemony and I only had dry dill and only used 1tsp.(didn't know the ratio of fresh to dry) and it was way to dill-y too!  I'd try again but start my own sauce.

This wasn't one of my favorites.  I changed quite a bit, initially.

1.  I halved all of the spices, and it was still too much.  I can't believe all of the dill!  Way too overpowering.  

2.  I used 5 tablespoons of milk INSTEAD OF lemon juice in the cream sauce, and I added 1/4 tsp. of salt.  That was OK.  

I'll be sticking with garlic/butter versions of tilapia from now on.

I only used the fish spices in this recipe and got a different recipe for the sauce. I didn't change any of the spices but next time I will use less margerine or none at all. I made a sauce out of mayo, lemon juice, sour cream, garlic powder and dill. It worked great with the fish and left overs can be used for veggie dip.

I did not care for this recipe.  I didn't use fresh dill but everything else I followed to a T and it was so bitter (perhaps the lemon juice).  My husband asked, "What stinks?!" when he got home from work.  I would not recommend this recipe or a least not the creamy sauce part of it.

This was good, but I did make the modifications suggested by other reviews. I substituted 1/2 tsp dried dill in place of 1 Tbsp fresh, I used much less lemon juice, I salted the fish first, and added heavy cream to the sauce because it was too thick, but you could use milk too, I just had the cream on hand at the time. My cream cheese did curdle, but I whipped it with a wisk when I added the cream and it was fine. My husband liked it and he isn't a fan of tilapia.

Although the fish was wonderful - the sauce was way too lemony - almost uneatable.  I would suggest maybe one tablespoon of lemon and definitely add some seasoning to the cream cheese - perhaps choose an herb cheese.

Really, really lemony.  In fact the lemon overpowered all other tastes.  I would definitely make again but I would cut the lemon.  Only need 1 1/2 tbs or so for drizzling on the fish and definitely need less in the sauce.

But simple, easy and tasty.

The tilapia part was very good, although I would add some salt next time.  the sauce was awful-way too much lemon juice.  I ended up melting butter and adding only a small amount of the recipe sauce which was okay.   I would make again, but need to come up with a better sauce.

There are a couple minor modifications that I would make, but this recipe is on the right track.  I would suggest a little bit of spice, maybe some red pepper flakes or cayenne, to work with the lemon.  The sauce seems a bit too thick, so maybe also add some milk or half and half to that.  I also made the sauce first and then put it on top of the fish while I baked the fish.  That helps to keep the fish from drying out in the oven.

Adjust to your liking. Make sure to not add that much lemon juice. Two tablespoons is fine for the sauce. The fish came out insanely good. This was quick and easy.

I found this recipe to be pretty good, with a few major changes.  While I did use lemon on the tilapia itself, I totally omitted it from the dill sauce. I used a little chicken stock instead of milk to thin the sauce; this keeps the creaminess factor while adding more flavor.   I put the fish on a bed of brown rice, and drizzled the sauce over the whole thing, and it was tasty!

It is a good basic recipe but like the others, I used less lemon juice and made more of the cream cheese mixture.

This wasn't bad, but wasn't anything special. It didn't have a whole lot of flavor. The cream cheese sauce was definitely the best part. I won't make this one again.

I like the simple baking of the fish, but the sauce was not as good as I would had hoped. It was definitely worth a try for something different but I won't be trying this again.

Really enjoyed this recipe with a few changes.  I cut all the lemon juice requirements in half and it was still a little tart for my taste.  I omitted the dill from the fish and sauce and added garlic instead. Baked for 20 min instead of 15. Served with brown rice and black beans. A wonderfully light and easy meal that I will make again soon.

I wouldn't recommend this recipe to anyone who doesn't absolutely love lemon. After reading other reviews, I cut the amount of lemon juice in half and it was still overpowering. I thought there was a bit too much dill as well.  I much prefer a mustard dill recipe I found elsewhere.

This is an easy good recipe, especially if you don't have alot of experience cooking fish.  It's healthy, tasty and only takes a few minutes. My husband really enjoyed it and my daughter who hates fish really liked it too.

Followed this recipe exactly and was very disappointed. The lemon was way to overpowering. That is all you could taste. I would suggest cutting the lemon juice way down.

I absolutely loved it!  My boyfriend said that the cream cheese was inappropriate.  I happen to love cream cheese, so perhaps that's why I feel so differently about this dish.  Throwing in some extra dill never hurt anyone either.

The fish tasted great, but I agree with other reviewers that the sauce was way too acidic and overwhelmingly lemony. Next time I make the sauce I'll reduce the lemon and just toss the remaining lemon in my water. This recipe was really easy since you're basically just tossing stuff in the oven and microwaving. If you're in a rush, that's really great. I made a very slight change by tossing in some garlic cloves with the fish in the oven, and it enhanced the aroma and delicate flavor of the dish when it was done. Some of that roasted garlic I mashed & added to the sauce. Recipe could be great, if the sauce had the right ratios.

This recipe was delicious.  I made it with sea bass, which was just as good, but also needed to cut back quite a bit on the lemon juice in the cream cheese...1-2T would've been plenty.  Five tablespoons was way too sour.  Very tasty otherwise!

This was way too lemony. If I make again, I will cut the lemon way down, maybe by a 1/4, and the dill by 1/2.

The fish from this recipe was ok but the sauce was terrible it tasted like nothing more than cream cheese and lemon juice and was not what I would consider creamy. Very disappointing i will stick to the parmesan tilapia recipe from this site!

My first attempt at making fish, and it was very good.  I used Mrs. Dash in place of the lemon pepper.  There was just enough lemon flavor, but not too overpowering.   I'll make it again.

This was quite good. I did find the cream sauce was a little too lemony, so I would cut back on that next time. Otherwise this is a delicious recipes

We found this recipe to be very bland, tasting primarily of dill and cream cheese, needs more spices, but not just dill, maybe onions and garlic and lemon zest.

I loved the tilapia!!! But the sauce.. was different. It had a weird flavor and I liked it at sometimes. I served it for my family and they weren't a big fan of the sauce either. But I did add breadcrumbs to the recipe and it was delicious!

I made this last night for dinner. My husband and I both agreed that the flavor was much too strong. I increased the sauce for the amount of tilapia I had, but not the lemon juice - 5 T just seemed like way too much. Here's what I did: 2T cream cheese, 4T lemon juice, and 2 sprigs of fresh dill. The lemon juice and dill were still overpowering, despite the reductions. Next time, I'll cut both in half again to give it a more subtle flavor and I think it will come out much better.

The sauce was tart but I added some another tablespoon of  cream cheese and alfredo sauce, store bought.  The addition helped to make the cream cheese sauce less thick and worked well with spaghetti. Overall, it's a very elegant dish

The fish flavor was way too sour due to too much lemon juice. After it baked in the oven, I mixed the sauce up. From the beginning until after the sauce was finished, it seemed an odd texture and nothing really combined or mixed. After the sauce went on the flanks, it looked like cottage cheese but tasted awful.

This recipe was very simple & delicious  with a few changes I used the 2 tablespoons of lemon for the fillets only, but for the sauce I made it stove top with red cooking wine instead of lemon and added a little garlic ?? Will definitely make it again!

Okay it was a good concept and good ingredients but the amounts are way off. I went easy on the lemon juice (1 tbsp) and lemon pepper (1/4 of what it calls for) and about half the amount of dill. More cream cheese so I ended up with more sauce at the end. I used salmon fillets instead (fried for 5 mins on each side) and minute rice. I put the rice on the plate then the salmon then spread the sauce over top.

I didn't read the reviews and it was too much lemon for the sauce.  We love lemon but it was too much.  Otherwise it was great and easy and a quick meal on a busy night.

Delicious, and easy. I used chive and onion cream cheese with just a splash of lemon juice and a tbsp of butter for the sauce. Also added a bit of bread crumbs to the tilapia as it cooked.

The fish was good, but the sauce was super tart. I had to double the cream cheese, add garlic salt, and 2 Tbls of butter to balance it. Included a cup of fine diced crab for a little sweet compliment and it was good. No longer the original recipe, but good.

I liked this overall, but it seemed like no matter what I do, the cream sauce comes out gritty or separated or something. Certainly takes away from the presentation.

Five stars for quick and yummy.  Decreased the lemon, increased the cream cheese and added a little milk.  Cooked the sauce over the stove.  Used dried dill.  Heard lots of "Mmmm" from my daughter...the only one that was home.  Thanks.

Rating this 4 out of 5 because while it turned out delicious, I wasn't using the measurements in the recipe as they seem to be a bit much, especially the lemon juice. I seasoned everything myself, tasting frequently, and that's what I recommend instead of following the recipe exactly. Adjusted for taste this was a really delicious dinner.

This was really good and I am not a seafood fan. My husband loves seafood so I thought I would try this and it was very good. The only complaint I had was that there was not enough sauce and I did triple the recipe, so if you like alot of sauce you might want to do more than triple the sauce recipe.

Very good, but I agree that it is too much lemon juice and on the next try I made it and I put 1/2 as much and it was better. Also, Im such a fan of dill, I used a bit more.

LOVED IT!!  Bursting with flavor!  I only used half of the lemon juice called for in the sauce and I thought it was great.  We felt like we were dining at a restaurant.  It was so easy and delicious.  This will be a regular meal for us!!

This was AMAZINGLY good.  
My modifications:  
NO butter only olive oil
Used sour cream instead of cream cheese.

dried dill not fresh because it was what I had on hand.  

During the last 5 minutes I turned up my oven to give the fish some crisp edges because I like it that way.

It really did take only 30 minutes.

good flavor. cream cheese was a little over powering for the simple fish. next time i'll add half cream chhese and half cream with slightly less lemon. 

made with plain jasmine rice to absorb some of the sauce- it's flavor was very strong.

Very good.  I would back off a little on the dill, but not much.  And it could have used another minute or two in my oven.  Again not much.  My daughter has already made this twice.  We'll both make it again.  Thanks.
