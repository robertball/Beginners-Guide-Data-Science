Brought back memories of girl scout camp. We called it campers stew and added 1 cup of barley to the pot. I like this one because I didn't have to look for bugs. ;)

My husband grew up eating a soup like this and always called it Hamburger Soup - As written it lacked a little seasoning but that was easy to fix.  I used a slightly different method - just to stream line this - cook the hamburger in your soup pot - drain and return pot to stove add butter and cook the onion, carrot and celery in the butter - add the flour - cook for a few minutes and then slowly add the beef broth stirring well to form a smooth base - then proceed with the recipe.  In addition to the canned green beans I added a can of corn too.  I added the meat, browning sauce and pepper sooner than instructed and let it all simmer together.  I did not add MSG - after tasting the soup I added some chili flakes and some oregano, basil spice blend.  That really kicked it up a notch.  Hubby loved it.
