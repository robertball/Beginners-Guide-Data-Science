I only followed this recipe loosely but it was delicious. I had leftover mashed potatoes I wanted to use (instead of instant potato flakes) so I made the dumplings a little differently. After they were done boiling I sauteed them in some oil with sauerkraut and kielbasa. Very tasty on this cool fall evening! Thanks for the inspiration!
