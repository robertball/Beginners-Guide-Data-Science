This is a good, basic recipe. Some tips to help you:
1. You can split new vanilla beans, but I just throw in used beans from other recipes. RINSE THEM FIRST and the end product will be the same. 
2. Two vanilla beans is fine, but your desired flavor will develop over time. I just keep the beans in the liquid, using it as I go. 
3. Mix up your liquor selection! I LOVE making vanilla extract out of bourbon for a richer flavor--it's great for fall recipes (pumpkin pie, apple crisp, etc). 
4. This is a never-ending process. When your batch is at strength you like, decant most of the liquid into a separate bottle. Top off the original bottle with more liquor, and start the process over again.

Based on some other reviewers' comments, I split 4 vanilla beans, cut them in 1/2" pieces, and using a well-cleaned out wine bottle for its dark colored glass, placed them in only a half-pint of vodka, and corked it for about 30 days.  I shook the bottle up everyday to thoroughly distribute the vanilla seeds, then after 30 days strained it all through a coffee filter, and bottled them!  It smells great and is a nice dark brown color.  I also did the same thing with a half-pint of rum for a vanilla-rum extract.  Wish I would have made more now.  With these changes, this is a 5-star recipe and great little Christmas gifts!  Thanks, Ginger.

I made this for myself and for friends as a Christmas gifts.  It is the best.  I used quite a few more beans (5 to 7) in 500 ml of vodka (the size of my bottles).  Just keep refreshing the vodka as you use it.  The cheapest place to find vanilla beans was on eBay.   I got about 35 of them for under $10.00

Making your own vanilla is a great idea! A few tips; my mom has been making vanilla for over 20 years..it always turns out great.  Her advice is to split the beans before putting them in the liquor to release the most flavor. A lot of people use vodka, mom has always used Brandy(J&B,not expensive)..the brandy gives a wonderful color and flavor. The vanilla really should be left alone for about 3 months(just give it a gentle shake every few weeks). This vanilla has always turned out very well,and is terrific to give as gifts.

I am so very greatful that you've solved the vanilla mystery, Ginger. (With that name, you were obviously born to be a foodie!!!)  I will never buy vanilla again, and think of the joy in giving someone a gorgeously adorned BIG bottle of home-made, low-carb, organic-as-it-gets Vanilla!!!!  I will have and share immense pleasure from this gift of your recipe.  Merry Christmas to you!

I don't think two vanilla beans is enough.  I have made this too, however I use six vanilla beans.

I was inspired to make this based on LadyJayPee's beautiful pictures.  I agree that the amt. of vanilla bean be increased.  I only had dark rum, and used 6 beans; 3 each of Tahitian and Mexican varieties.  It smells and tastes wonderful, and is good quality vanilla for a fraction of the cost.  Use only the freshest vanilla beans that are very pliable.  Thanks for this cost-saving recipe.

I love to make things from scratch but I think I like the store bought better. Mine still tastes too much like alcohol and not enough like a good full strength vanilla extract (I have one from Mexico). It has been sitting for about 8 months with about 12 split vanilla beans. I still taste the alcohol. Next time I won't buy "gold rum". Update - this works well in baked goods. Still tastes like strong alcohol in my ice cream mixes.

This recipe rocks!!    I used 4 large vanilla beans beacuse 2 beans didn't seem like much in that big bottle.  It smells and tastes like the "pure" expensive stuff in the store, but it doesn't have any coloring in it so it's a lot lighter.

The longer the beans steep, the better the vanilla will be.  Two beans doesn't get much done, even in several weeks.  I now use 5 beans (6" bourbon beans) for 2 cups of vodka, and let it steep for a full year (shaking it once a week), which seems kind of extreme, but is well worth the wait, since it gives a lot more body and flavor.

EXCELLENT, QUALITY and INexpensive!  I bought the cheap bottle of vodka ($6) and got 30 Madagascar vanilla beans on eBay for $10.  THIS IS THE BEST VANILLA.  EVER!  You will not be disappointed.  I'm bottling it, adding a recipe and giving it as gifts for the holidays!

What a great recipe.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I feel it takes 4-5 bean for a whole bottle of vodka.  I purchased my beans on ebay in bulk and used tahitian and madagascar beans to make to different extracts.  So fun to make on your own.  I've been making my own extract for 3 yrs now and it's way less expensive than store bought.  Next time I'm going to try it in bourbon.

I bought Grade B Madagascar vanilla beans online from a Frenchman on Ebay in summer 2010.  Grade B are the vanilla beans used for extract.  My friend who is Euro-trained in food service says that the resulting vanilla is the best--ever!

I started my home-made vanilla a year and a half ago in a bottle of vodka. It has since turned into 2 bottles under my kitchen sink. I love the little vanilla bean seeds in it when you make icing and whipped cream. Oh i also used about 25 beans sliced open. I got them from Ebay for a great price!

This has to be one of the greatest ideas ever! I've had my vanilla hanging out since the end of March, however, we've got six split beans in our bottle and I wouldn't suggest going with any less than that. Actually, I'd like to add a few more, but as is, the aroma is absolutely divine. Just think about how popular you'll be giving small bottles out as gifts! My qualitycook.com friends and I are contemplating vanilla vodka martinis! Thanks so much Ginger!

Doubled the number of vanilla beans and halved the amount of alcohol.  Used Tahitian vanilla beans in rum.  Much better than store-bought, more economical, and can keep a rotation going so I never run out.  Thank you!

The basic recipe is great for a mild vanilla taste. It needs 3 or 4 beans, split and scraped to develop a strong vanilla flavor desired by most bakers. "Topping off" defeats the purpose of steeping for several weeks and dilutes the extract. I suggest starting a second bottle once you begin using the first. Once you've finished the first, the second will be ready for use and you can reuse your vanilla beans in the first bottle. I don't suggest reusing the beans more than once or twice - fresh beans will give you the best flavor.

wonderful idea.  Don't know why I hadn't thought of it before.  I guess you can also use this in any martini that calls for Vanilla Vodka too.  Multinational; even better!

It smells awesome. We are going to bake with it this week because it has set for long enough. We put in 6 beans split down the middle, we found them for very cheap at World Market.

I've tried a method very similar to this, but I used three vanilla beans.  Even then, the final product (even after a year-and-a-half) is still nowhere near as strong in flavor as commercial vanilla extract.  However, even though I wouldn't use this in cooking, I do find that it makes a good vanilla liqueur, of sorts.  I like to add it to hot chocolate to give it a kick!

I used a pint of Smirnoff vodka and about 6 split vanilla beans. Been shaking weekly for about 5 months. Has a strong acrid alcohol smell and tastes bitter. Not sure what I did wrong.

I love this recipe. I will never buy vanilla from the store again. I only had two vanilla beans when I first started and it had an ok flavor. It took quite a while to get a fuller vanilla flavor. Next time I will defineatly use more beans and play with the varieties to develop my own flavor. For now the only problem I have is finding little jars to use to give some vanilla to people who would appreciate it.

As others added, you definitely need to increase the amount of beans per bottle. Between 6 and 10 is good.
You get the best results if you expose as much of the interior of the bean as possible. Give the beans a couple of whirls in a small food processor after you split them open for optimum results and allow the mixture to sit for at least 4 months, shaking about once a week, for best results. You will never get vanilla as good as you get from the store out of it (you would have to shake the bottle every waking moment to do so), but it makes a great addition to stir fry or as a topping for desserts.

I have made vanilla using a similar recipe and was happy to see the advice about washing/splitting the beans, etc.  Now my question is, how many times can I refill the liquor?  Just until it doesn't get any flavor after a month or so?  Does anyone have experience as to how many refills this might be?

This same recipe I came across in Martha Stewart's magazine a while back and have been using it for years. While I do agree that this is not as strong as the stuff you get at the supermarket, to me it's a great substitution when you consider the cost and the fact that there's generally only a teaspoon in your average recipe anyway.
