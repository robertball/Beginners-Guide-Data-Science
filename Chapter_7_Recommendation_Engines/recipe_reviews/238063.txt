I loved this bbq sauce. I liked the fact that there is no added sugar and that it is gluten free.  I used homemade ketchup to "keep it real". I needed a bbq sauce for baking bacon wrapped tofu and thought the "Asian" twist would be perfect, I was right! It went so well with the tofu and it was wonderful on the bacon. Thanks to you, Sara for this keeper recipe!

We thought this was pretty good, served it over grilled sirloin patties.  Little bit of an Asian twist to it with the tamari.
