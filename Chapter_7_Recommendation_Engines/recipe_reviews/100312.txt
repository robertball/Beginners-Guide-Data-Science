I'll give this recipe 5 stars for how easy it is to make. This is a delicious topping for vanilla ice cream. I used Splenda brown sugar to keep the sugar down and served it as dessert after a romantic Valentines day dinner.

It was really good, but for some reason I was disappointed by the flames. They weren't as spectacular as I thought they'd be.

For a little more spectacular flame, heat your Brandy up. The brandy has to be heated above 79 degrees F to reach its flashpoint (the point where it starts producing enough vapors to ignite). Once the brandy is heated, then pour, light and then stir into Cherries. This recipe is also wonderful if you substitute the brown sugar for white sugar, and the cherry pie filling with fresh picked huckleberries cooked to a simple syrup. Have fun and flame on! :)

used frozen dark cherries instead of pie filling and a pat of butter was amazing  and delicious and simple my family loved it. I would make again for sure.
