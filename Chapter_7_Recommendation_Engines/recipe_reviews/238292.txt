I was looking for a tasty recipe for supper tonight.  As I was feeding teens I only used mushrooms saut√©ed in butter and garlic.  The Alfredo Sauce was absolutely delicious.  I substituted Gouda for the Provolone as provolone wasn't available.  I'd added some Lois Kempe crab chunk to add a bit of flavor.  Thank you for this recipe!

I just threw in whatever vegetables I had on hand (asparagus, broccoli, pepper, onion, peas, and carrots) then added some garlic too. Super easy and delicious! I will probably make this one  of our regular dinners.

This recipe is exactly what I was searching for and I had to go to the very last of the search options.  So sad.  It should be a go-to for everyone.  I did add some mushrooms and a little onion and garlic but the recipe as is would be sufficient.  Excellent recipe.  Thanks for posting.

So delicious! I added zucchini from the garlic which I threw in right at the end with the peppers so they still had a nice soft crunch. Mmmmmm...

I LOVED making this dish- So simple. I was being lazy all week, not wanting to cook anything.  Now the cooking bug has returned and my family will enjoy this meal for years to come!!
