Awesome!  Just perfect.  I don't bother with the vinegar because it's not necessary.  I don't use one pound of GB's either--just a few handfuls.  

Run them under water, pinch off the ends and forget boiling them 1st. It's NOT necessary.

I add extra fresh crushed garlic to the pan and saute everything (covered) on a med-flame for 10-15 minutes so it's tender and flavorful! YUM!

I use a similar cooking method . I use olive oil instead of sesame , skip the sugar ,use the garlic , sprinkle on teriyaki sauce instead of soy, add a sprinkle of sesame seeds , then add in the stirfried beef or chicken strips Ive prepared in advance & serve it all on a bed of rice . This recipe was a result of my first ever attempt at stirfry (Im from a long line of traditional country cooks) & my kids love it                                                                                                                                                                                      m                  ,

Yum, these were good. Even two of my kids who never touch green beans had some. Frozen beans work fine. I cut the oil in half, and used just 2 T. of soy sauce. More would be overwhelming. Thanks  for a keeper.

this is an awesome recipe, a big hit in my house.  I sauteed my beans in olive oil and garlic instead of boiling, but I did everything else the same.  Ive also used this recipe to make asparagas, just as good!

as Rachel Ray would say: YUMMO!
I didn't have sesame oil though so I used olive oil and added 2 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds and was happy they worked out. Great recipe! thanks!

This was good but not our favorite.  I find that adding the garlic at the middle of the cooking time helps the garlic maintain a better garlic taste.

LOVE LOVE this recipe.  I use olive oil and fresh minced garlic.  Because of this recipe my husband asks for green beans at least once or twice a week.  Sometimes we eat them as an appetizer.  I have even graduated this to a steak marinade and it is still amazing!!!  After marinating for 30 min to an hour, I add garlic salt (omitting the fresh garlic altogether) and throw the steaks on the grill.  Perfect every time!!

Very good recipe...I cut the balsamic in half, as suggested by other reviewers, and agree that it was probably better balanced.  My adjustments: 1. I used olive oil (with a little butter added) instead of sesame oil, but had sesame seeds on hand so I threw in about a teaspoon (glad I did) 2. I added sliced onions to the garlic/butter/oil mixture and sauteed a little before adding the green beans. 3.  I added a few drops of liquid smoke, but I don't think I really added enough to alter much 4.  A little chopped bacon added at the end was delicious. All in all, I really enjoyed this, even though I made quite a few adjustments.  Not sure if it would reheat well so serve it immediately.  Will definitely make this again.

I love this recipe, but I tweaked it just a tad:  instead of balsamic vinegar, I used rice vinegar.  and I only had toasted sesame oil, which wasn't a big deal....it really gave the beans a yummy, nutty flavor.  This recipe is a keeper!!!

These were okay, but the sauce didn't thicken. Maybe I'm doing it wrong. My husband really liked them, though.

Great easy recipe. I used olive oil.  The first time I made it with 2 tablespoons oil.  That was too much.  I have now made it several times since with just about 1 tablespoon and I think it's much better.

Very good!  Hubby doesn't like green beans, but he really enjoyed these!  I used olive oil instead of sesame oil & omitted the balsamic vinegar (didn't have either) and it was great.  Thanks for the great recipe!

These were yummy.  I loved the combo of the soy sauce and the balsamic....great.  Hade these along side a juicy rib-eye steak and they went well.  I did add some toasted sesame seeds to the top.  I am sure I will make these again!  Thanks Pam and Corey's dad!

This was good, but I only used one TBS of sesame oil and it was still a little overpowering! I used equal amounts low-sodium soy sauce and balsamic, and added a half tsp red pepper flakes and a bit of arrowroot to thicken the sauce. Good beans!

Delicious! I also used 2 T. soy sauce and half the sesame oil. After I had steamed the green beans, I put them in the frypan with the hot sesame oil and garlic and really browned them. After I poured the sauce in, I cooked off most of the liquid. Then I put the cooked beans in toasted corn tortillas and they were a hit for lunch!

Pretty good; followed the recipe as state but will probably lay off the balsamic. It was just a little bit too much for us. Will make again but with less balsamic vinegar.

I make something very similar to this without the vinegar. I love the sesame oil with the green beans, YUM. I always add some type of nuts, usually sunflower seeds. Also good with some french fried onions on top as a garnish.

Oh my, what a switch from the traditional southern style green beans!  They are truly bursting with flavor.  I like that they still have some firmness like steamed green beans.  You will just not belive the juicy burst of flavor.  Did I mention they are flavorful? This recipe is a definite keeper.  I also love that it is pretty healthy without sacrificing the taste. Thanks for sharing.

I made these beans for the first time utilizing canned beans. Omission of the steaming process made it even quicker. They turned out awesum. My gal and I devoured them with baked trout. Wonderful. Thanks for the recipe.

The green beans turned out very delicious.  I added a teaspoon of sesame seeds, for a bit of crunch.  Make sure to boil them for the required amount of 5 minutes as they are good crisp.

Not bad, but too salty.  I'd use less soy or ponzu soy sauce instead.  Also, toasting some sesame seeds and mixing them in, while reducing the sesame oil would give it a cleaner, lighter taste, something this recipe  sorely needs.  Good start, but I recommend tweaking this a lot.

-Oh, I also added some hot dried chili flakes, which gave the beans a bit of a kick.  I'd recommend it.

This was excellent. I skipped the parboiling of the beans and cooked them directly in the garlicky oil and the soy sauce mixture. Also, I decreased slightly the amount of soy sauce in the sauce mixture. The result was delicious, and I even used some of the cooking liquid as a dipping sauce for other items on the menu.

WONDERFULLY tasty AND easy!  Perhaps the best thing about this dish is its ability to be changed up a bit.  I sauteed some chicken to add to the mix.  Also added some ginger and a few dashes of Chinese five spice powder...really perked the dish up!  Thanks for a delicious addition to our rotation!

Easy, fast and tasty! Made this for the 1st time last nite & substituted fresh green beans for a bag of Birds Eye Steamfresh Green Beans. Substituted EVOO for the sesame oil & cut soy sauce to 2 tbsp. Was a HUGE hit with hubby. Definitely putting on my recipe rotation!

Better than delicious!  I am always hesitant to try new recipes because my husband is rather picky.  He LOVED them, as did I.  He said he felt he should be eating at a Japanese steakhouse.  The kids didn't love them as we did, and didn't finish there's...but my husband ate the remnants.

Fantastic! I didn't have low sodium soy sauce on hand, but will definitely get it for the next time. It was a bit on the salty side. Oh, and i didn't steam the green beans first, just threw them in the pan at the same time i put the garlic in.

DELICIOUS!  I followed the suggestions of OPHELIAGRACE and didn't steam them first.  I also added about half a cup of chicken broth, since the skillet I was cooking them in was a little too big.  The flavor was wonderful - this recipe is going to become a staple in my kitchen

this turned out sooo good! at first its a bit confusing as to what youre doing, but the end result is awesome. id suggest not pouring on the sauce afterwards tho, because the green beans at the bottom of our bowl got completely soaked in it and were a bit soggy. other than that amazing!

Very good and very easy.  Tastes just like the beans at our favorite Chinese restaurant.  It is quite salty.  I think next time I may cut back even more on the soy sauce (maybe just 1 tbs) and add more oil.

This was a good recipe.  I did as some of the other reviewers suggested and cut down the soy sauce to 2 T instead of 3 (I also don't like my food to taste too much like soy sauce).  I didn't have whole fresh green beans on hand, instead I used a bag of 1 lb. frozen french cut GB and they turned out good.  I have a family of six and this was our only side with our dinner so we had just enough for all of us to have one good serving.

Super delicious. Tastes like Asian Buffet Restaurant Green Beans. A little sweet, a little complex–makes green beans a lot more tasty for kids, too. I use a little less green beans to make the flavor even more robust.

Loved this recipe. I didn't change a thing. I used light sesame oil which didn't overpower the dish.  I find the dark sesame oil to be too strong in taste. I did salt the water slightly and the beans did not turn out salty. You must use light soy sauce. If you only have regular on hand I would use 2 tbsp soy sauce and 1 tbsp water. I found these beans to have a mild teriyaki taste to them.

I made this recipe a couple of times as written, and it's pretty good. I'm lazy, so now I just substitute Trader Joe's Island Soyaki for the soy sauce, sugar, and oil. I also leave out the vinegar and just add a squeeze of lime juice after pouring the sauce over the beans. Finally, I typically add some nuts (any kind of nut will work) for some extra crunch. Thanks for the recipe!

I never rate or comment on anything, ever, until I found this recipe. I've been looking for fun and healthy ways to dress up vegetables for myself and my boyfriend. Yes, he will eat anything, but this recipe gets him excited to eat veggies. I've been using this same recipe with various other greens besides green beans. The most common thing I use is frozen steam veggie bags I had purchased before I started cooking on my own. I just throw them in the pan after the oil and garlic without boiling them and it works like magic. I have used apple cider vinegar instead of balsamic and Splenda instead of sugar and it tasted just as yummy.  The sesame oil is the real game changer.  I have found this recipe works great with any veggie. It's new, fun and exciting. Thank you for sharing your dad's recipe!

Amazing! My whole family loves them. Tip: don't use frozen they lose their integrity in the cooking process and absorb too much of the marinade.

Loved it! I actually didn't have soy sauce (I just moved and forgot that I tossed mine to avoid spilling), so I just added some extra salt and it was delicious!

Doubled the sauce for 2 lbs but it was too much.  Try it next time with just a single recipe for 2 lbs of those French green beans from Costco.  Really good.

I've made this twice, now...and both times, my husband raved over them!  The first time, I didn't boil the beans first but they were too squeaky for our preference so I definitely recommend that step.  Today, I didn't measure everything.  I just "eyeballed it" and tweaked it to taste...but I never would have thought of it if I hadn't seen this recipe so I thank you for sharing it.  We couldn't love these more!

Meh, just ok.  Can't taste much over the soy sauce.  I will definitely stick with the other similar recipe of this that I use that has honey and red pepper flakes along with similar ingredients.

Outstanding! My eldest son wolfed down his portion and I will make this again. No changes needed, but due to size of garlic cloves (1 too small, 2 too much) more garlic was used.

did not boil - just stir-fried. Note - made ALOT of mess - lots of splatter so needed to keep covered. Great taste, kind of sweet.

Very yummy!  My kids ate their veggies and even wanted more.  I used this same sauce to "saute" some broccoli and it was a hit.  Will buy more fresh green beans and make this a regular dish in our house. Simple and tasty.

I loved these green beans!  Didn't change a thing. I've made some similar in the past, but this definitely beats other soy-sauce based recipes HANDS-DOWN.  (If you happen to have some leftover that have soaked up some sauce, even better!)  YUM.

This was pretty good. I had balsamic vinegrette dressing on hand and olive oil so I had to use those instead. I only did 1 tbsp instead of 3 for soy sauce and omitted the sugar. I know it was a lot of adaptations...but I 'm sure if you have all of the ingredients it would be just as good.

Turned out fantastic.  Used 2 Tbls of Olive Oil and 1 Tbls of White Balsamic + the sugar.  Even the kids ate this one.  Tasty - fresh & light.  Will make this again with Summer's bounty.  Would be great with broccoli, patty pan squash.

I've made these a few times and there's never any leftovers. They are great as a side dish, but when I want to make a meal, I add cooked chinese brand link sausage.  Tastes like the pork and green beans at the local restaurant. I add a little grated fresh ginger and red pepper, too.

I followed the recipe exactly and I thought it turned out perfectly.  I will make these again and again especially since we get bombarded with green beans from our garden every summer.  My kids even liked them.  They took one bite and said, "Tastes like Chinese food."  Must be the soy?  Give them a try!

I was bored with my usual green beans with almonds, so I decided to try something different and made these. I'd never made Chinese-style green beans before. These were fabulous! And so simple to make. I used only 2 T. of soy sauce, and stirred the garlic directly into the sauce. I'll definitely be making these again!

These were really good, easy & quick to make.  I added a little less soy sauce and sprinkled some shredded parmesan on them after I removed them from the pan. Will definitely make again and look forward to trying this recipe with asparagus also.

I'm a little leary about rating this, but I made these for Thanksgiving and it was not recieved very well by any of us.  It just was not the right flavor for our meal in general.  It had a very asian flavor to it which isn't a bad thing, just didn't go well with turkey and stuffing in our opinion.  My balsalmic was also very rich so If I make again, I will cut down on that and I also used fresh green beans which I'd do again as well.  It smelled really good but was so tangy that we could barely eat them.  I'm glad I also made carrots, it pays to always make two of something just in case when entertaining for this very reason.  I won't rule these out, I will give them another chance, just with a much different menu!

May use Frozen Whole Green Beans.
Use Brown Sugar in place of White, starting with 1/2 tsp and then adding more after cooking 8 minutes, if necessary.  Be careful not to overcook.  These should be crisp and bright green. Sprinkle lightly with toasted sesame seeds.

These were just ok.  Nothing like the green beans at the local chinese restaraunt.  If I make these again I will leave out the balsamic and maybe cut down to to 2 tbs of soy.

Excellent and easy! I used 1lb of frozen green beans, 2 Tbl. sesame oil, and 1 Tbl. minced garlic. Once the green beans start to brown I add the soy/balsamic sauce. I hate green beans but this is out of this world, I make this often and eat it like candy.

These were reaaly good. I used a big bag of green beans, cut off 2 inches of the top corner and microwaved them for 8 minutes. Then I simmered the sauce in the sauce pan, and added about 3 tbsp. of toasted sesame seeds. I placed the green beans in a serving bowl and poured the sauce on top. Delicious!

These were so delicious!! I didn't even have to steam the green beans. I cooked the green beans in olive oil (since I didn't have sesame oil) with the garlic. Then I added the soy sauce mixture and let it cook for a few more minutes. They turned out very good!

These are really good, and a nice Asian addition to any meal.  Probably not a good choice for picky eaters however.  My hubby and I enjoyed this, but with a sticky black sauce & a taste that leans toward an adult palate, I don't think it'd go over well with kids.

All I can say is YUMMMM! I probably ate 1/2 the recipe myself, I liked it so much. My husband and daughter, who like more basic, plain foods, didn't really prefer it. Which worked out really well for me and my son! I used a 14oz package of frozen baby green and yellow beans and they worked perfectly. Crisp tender, mmmmmm!

LOVE!!!!!  Was looking for a recipe for some yellow beans & thought I would give this a whirl.  Took advice of other reviewers & only used 2 T of light soya sauce & 1 T of sesame oil.  Perfect!  This would be a nice sauce for broccoli too.  Thanks for the recipe!

I used frozen green and yellow beans with carrots.  Stirfried them with the garlic and the sesame oil, then added the soy sauce mixture.  I halved the recipe because it was only my husband and myself.  My husband asked for more (and he doesn't eat green bean usually) but there were no more left.  Guess next time, I'll make the full recipe

Was way too salty for my liking and the seasame oil too strong.  Cut the oil and soy sauce in half and maybe that would be better.  I just didn't like it.

We really liked this green bean recipe. Quick & easy. Didn't have any fresh beans so, i let the frozen whole green beans thaw first then made the recipe.  We like alot of sauce, and this sauce seemed like there wasn't much and it was runny. So i added some corn starch and water to make more sauce and thicker. We will definitely be making this again.

Yum, these were delicious.  I didn't have sesame oil, so I used a little peanut oil and tossed some sesame seeds in.  It's flavorful but yet not a heavy side dish.  I would make this for company.  On the downside, my children did not like it at all, so they'll be eating plain green beans the next time that I make this for my husband and myself.

Too much soy sauce, gave it a really salty overpowering soy sauce taste. Will try again without as much soy sauce, maybe just one Tbsp. of soy sauce would improve the taste. It's too hard to find a different way to make the same old veggies to give up so easily.

I didn't have any fresh green beans so I used canned green beans instead. Was just enough to add some zip to canned green beans. My boyfriend, who hates canned green beans requested I cook them again.

I have a ton of beans coming out of my garden right now, and I wanted something different.  I used "wok oil" and added sesame seeds.  I will definately make this again!

My husband thought this was a good recipe .  I found that it was to salty.  The salty flavor over powered the other flavors.

I really liked this recipe - what a great way to add some zest to green beans.  I wasn't sure at first cuz I tasted the soy mixture before it was cooked and thought it tasted gross but after simmering and reducing in the pan, these beans are now a favorite here.  I used EVOO and skipped the seasame seeds as I didn't have them - still turned out fabulous!

I received fresh green beans through a "mail to your home" food service and searched recipes to find something easy to do with  them. Happy to stumble upon this wonderful treat!  Easy and fast. I substituted  walnut oil for sesame oil (was all out) and it was AMAZING!  I plan to add fresh green beans to my shopping list so I can make these again! So yummy!

I didn't have a lot of green beans to cook so I translated all the tablespoons to teaspoons and it worked very well.  This is a terrific recipe to provide a nice variation on serving green beans which can grow very tiring.  Thank you for this recipe!!!

Pretty good, made it just as directed, but it could use a little something to zing it up a bit. I used frozen microwavable green beans, but think it would still be a bit quiet with fresh. Not sure what to add to perk it up. Not bad, but not awesome, either.

We thought it tasted great.  It reminded us of Mala greens beans at the higher end Chinese restaurants. We cant do any oil right now so just used Braggs Soy and a little water to saute the garlic, substitute stevia for sugar and it turned out just spectacular.

This was terrific and went well with the honey-ginger grilled salmon from this site.  I sauted the garlic in the sesame oil, when it began to brown I tossed in a bag of frozen whole green beans to begin to thaw and turned it off.  This way the beans would not overcook while I finished the rest of the meal.  When I pulled the salmon of the grill, I put the pan on high and finished them off.  With only a 1/4 c. of liquid it was flavorful and not too saucy.  Using frozen green beans mad this recipe super-fast and easy.  Will make again and again.  Thank you for sharing.

This was very good.  My husband loved it.  I followed the recipe exactly except only used 1 tablespoon of toasted sesame oil to save on the calories and it was still delicious.  I steamed the beans for 5 minutes like the recipe said, but next time I won't do that. I think it's an unnecessary step and will just add the beans to cook in the pan.  Will definitely make this again.

It was good. Soy sauce was a little over powering. Might make it again, but it wasn't amazing.

I just finished making this recipe.  I didn't use sesame oil because I didn't have any...  so I used EVOO instead and I think the recipe is wonderful.  A refreshing change for green beans without being overpowering.  If I get the sesame oil, I'll try this recipe again that way and update this review.  Will definitely be making these again!

I used the glaze part of this receipt and only added 2-TBS regular soy sauce with the balsamic vinegar and 2-Tbs sugar to thicken the glaze, you could also add a little corn starch to the slurry if you don't want your beans sweeter.I didn't have any sesame oil on hand so I chopped up three slices of bacon and rendered the fat before adding the beans from the steamer, these babies came out pretty tasty with the sweetness of the glaze and the saltiness of the bacon, thats why I only used two TBS of soy because three might have made the beans too salty with the bacon, but the glaze was the Star of the receipt that I had been missing. Thanks for a great receipt. 
P.S.. I also added three scallion onions cut on the bias and stir-fried with the beans.

Made these for the holiday "feast" at my son's school.  (I left them a little firm.) About 22 Kindergardeners ate these beans and said they like them -- enough said.  Yummay.

Glad I tried this recipe!  Followed everything as directed minus the boiling but had just eyed the amounts because I wanted to do a small batch before making a larger one.  Was surprised at how well the flavors are together; was skeptical about adding the balsamic vinegar, but it was pretty good if it's only a small amount. I didn't mix the ingredients into a bowl beforehand like the recipe states - just threw them in one at a time to save time.  Instead of boiling I just microwave them first.  Minced garlic would've been perfect, but I ran out and had to use powdered.  I thought it was pretty good but at the end, just HAD to add some rice vinegar to get a little sweeter.  Sesame seeds would've been a nice touch, too.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe and change of pace from my normal olive oil, chicken broth, salt, pepper, minced garlic green bean verite :)

My husband loved it.  I finally made fresh green beans right!  He even bragged to his friends!  I just had to exchange the vinegar for apple cider vinegar and I added the beans to the oil and just poured the soy mixture over the beans when I was finished and the outcome was great!

These were pretty good. Very quick and easy, but I found the balsamic vinegar overpowered the other flavours a little. If I make again, I will cut the vinegar in half.

I loved this and so did my DD.  I did half the sesame oil added a bit of vegetable oil so the sesame flavor wouldn't be too strong.  My DH liked them but wasn't overly thrilled.  I think we will make again since it is a nice change of pace for regular green beans.

I LOVE this recipe..I don't change anything. I have read reviews of people changing the oil to evoo. I think the sesame oil is essential. The flavour is completely different from evoo.

Family loved them!  Instead of balsamic vinegar, I just used red wine vinegar, since balsamic wasn't on sale!  And I didn't have any sesame oil, so I just used some extra virgin olive oil instead.  They were very flavorful!

I loved the strong flavors of this recipe but my boyfriend thought the vinegar was too strong.  Next time I'll probably cut back a little on the vinegar....

Very good. I have a microwave steamer so I steamed the beans while I mixed up the sauce.Two of us finished a pound of beans and I wish I had more to make.

I used the exact ingredients in this recipe and loved it!  The only change was that I steamed the green beans in a microwaveable steamer bag.  I also love Korean food which uses sesame oil so I loved the taste of the sesame oil, you will enjoy this recipe unaltered.  If you do not love sesame oil, recommend replacing half of it with olive oil.  You still need some sesame taste though so don't omit the sesame oil.  I really couldn't taste the balsamic vinegar so I will still use it again.  Will make again!

I liked the idea of this but just did not like the ending flavor of it at all. No one in my family liked them. I thought maybe it was me with all the good reviews but I followed the recipe exactly and it just wasn't our taste.

I followed the recipe exactly and these beans were great. The only thing i will do differently next time is to half the amount of balsamic vinegar but that's just personal taste.

Delicious!! My 11 year old ate 3 servings and he doesnt like green beans! Husband thought maybe cut down on soy sauce a bit but that is personal taste. This will be how i make beans from now on. Thanks for sharing.

I did not care for these at all.  Either did my husband.  It is probably just different tastes, but I didn't care for the seasame oil.  I would not make this recipe again.

This recipe is similar to how I make my own green beens, however, this is my new and improved recipe!  These green beans are outstanding.  My husband thought they were as good as the kind you would get in a restraurant.

Turned out pretty good. I used olive oil instead of sesame because I didn't want to make a special trip to the store for it and they were fine. Do not have to boil them first, it's an unneccessary step in the recipe.

These green beans were AWESOME!!  Everyone in my family loved them!!  I would agree that you don't need the vinigar, you can't taste it.  And I didn't have frozen green beans, so I used canned and it was wonderful!  Just drain the beans really well and heat them in the microwave, instead of steaming them!!  I will be making these many more times!!

My husband and I enjoyed this side very much.  It did take some urging for our child to eat it, however.  May reduce balsamic next time due to children's palettes.

A great way to spice up fresh green beans. I'm always looking for something new and delicious. This fit the bill! I did cut the following in half oil and soy sauce and it was still great. I've already made it twice. Oh yeah, I steam the green beans in those new ziploc steamer bags before adding the other stuff and cooking in the pan. Makes it a really quick weeknight veggie.

Just made this tonight for supper and everyone loved it. I had to stop my 7 year old daughter from eating it all so my husband could at least taste it. He finished it all. It was very easy to make and i really just eyeballed the amounts and it was fantastic.

These were okay, not great, don't know if I'd make them again unless I want sometime fairly quick and easy to make that tastes a little different. If I were to make these again, hubby suggested I could try adding sesame seeds.

I was once fooling around on this website and found this recipe, this was about 3 years ago.  When I first read the recipe I just new no one would want to eat it, because of the weird mix of ingredients, but I like to make crazy things in the kitchen.  My son was not big on eating veggies and when I made these for him he went crazy.  My mother ate like 4 helpings of them.  Now 3 years later I had lost the recipe and had to come back for it because I have to let everyone try this.

I thought this turned out to be pretty good.  I used canned beans since that's what I had at the time.  My one-year-old gobbled them down too which is nice since it's hard to get him to eat anything other than bananas and cheese!!

These were a huge hit at Chistmas dinner. The only thing I did was omitted the sugar and the flavor was still wonderful. will make these again in a heart beat!!

Yum! I don't like the "fresh" taste of green beans because I was raised on the canned kind that are cooked almost to disintegration.  This sauce made them enjoyable to me, even though I could still taste them.  I used red wine vinegar instead of balsamic, because that's what I had.  I used two 12 oz. bags of the beans that you steam in the bag, which made it quicker, and the sauce covered them fine.

Just ok. I think it's because I love green beans cooked simply and with this recipe all the soy and basamic vinegar overpowered the beans.

I didn't care for these.  The sesame oil overwhelmed me.  But in my house, majority rules and everybody else liked it, so I'll be making again, maybe using EVOO in stead of sesame.

Amazing, super-delicious, super fast.  Even tho I nuked the green beans and over-browned the garlic...  Served with talapia with tomatoes, mushrooms, onions.  This recipe would be a great side to any entree but would especially complement those with a milder or less complex  flavor.

The timing of using this recipe was perfect. My mother-in-law gave me a batch of fresh green beans today and I happened to have all of the  other ingredients this recipe called for. My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed this dish- very easy and tasty too. Thanks for sharing it.

Fantastic!  I have been looking for a way to jazz up green beans, and this is the best I've found!  I only had to substitute EVOO for sesame oil, but I will be adding the sesame oil to my shopping list...these will be made again and again! Thank you for a great recipe!

This recipe wasnt liked by my hubby or 10 year old son who likes everything.  I thought it was alright, just not particularly our taste.  Still doesnt beat the old green beans in italian dressing.  Maybe more balsalmic & less soy?  Sorry, just not a fav in our family.

These are great green beans.  I used canned beans that were drained and rinsed.  The longer you saute on low heat the more intense flavor you have.

This side dish is definitely interesting.  I love this type of seasoning, but it seemed as though the soy and sesame oil overpowered everything else.  I'd use about half of each next time, and perhaps add a bit of minced ginger as well.

Also, I'd watch what you pair this with.  It was suggested on the allrecipes site for a beef side dish...but definitely DON'T pair it with Beef Wellington!

Thanks for the recipe~

Yum yum yum. I cooked the beans longer because I don't like them so crisp. I used fresh haricot verts (the little skinny green beans). They were SO good. I made them for another couple and they both had seconds and asked for the recipe. And it's so easy! My husband even liked them and he claims not to like green beans!

Thanks Dad!  These green beans are great.  I used a bag of frozen uncut green and yellow beans and what a great side dish, I've tried it with slivered almonds and it's great that way too.

I've been looking for a green bean stir fry like the one served at our favorite Chinese restaurant. This isn't quite it, but the beans were still yummy. Thanks for sharing Dad!

The taste of balsamic vinegar was a little overpowering.  Not bad, but I have found better green bean recipes on this site.

Very tasty! I used another viewer's ideas of not boiling the green beans, and not using the vinegar. I used splenda instead of sugar. Very good!

A little too sweet for me, but I think that a lot of people would like this recipe.  My brother makes a dish similar to that, and we're going to combine the cooking techniques of this recipe with his marinade and think it'll be just right!  Thanks!

These were very good, with very good flavor. I used 3 cans of green beans, rinsed and drained till dry. I used 2 t sesame oil, 1 T olive oil, and 1 T soy sauce, and I subbed brown sugar and upped it to 2 t. We really like the combo of flavors, but for my taste the ingredients as stated would make it too salty and too strong for sesame oil. With my changes I will make it again. Thanks for a great recipe to work with, Pam & Corey.

This was just great. Watching the calories and fat, so I used only one T. of sessame oil, and it was still great.
Added toasted sessame seeds, and one slice of crumbled (low-fat) bacon to sprinkle on top. I'm making this again today, and I think I'll follow another reviewers suggestion and add red pepper flakes. Thanks!

All right Pam and Corey!  This was delicious!  Easy and quick, thank you.  The only thing I would add the next time is crumbled bacon (the maple flavored kind from Costco) and possibly a little chopped onion.  Thanks again!

I made these green beans last night, and the whole family really enjoyed them. I'm a novice cook, so I could have used some more specific information regarding cooking times - I think I didn't cook them quite long enough for the beans to really take on the flavor of the sauce. But I feared mushy beans!

My family really liked this green bean recipe!  It was super easy to prepare and had a nice flavor.  I followed the recipe exactly except that I used frozen green beans instead of fresh.  Definitely a keeper!!!
