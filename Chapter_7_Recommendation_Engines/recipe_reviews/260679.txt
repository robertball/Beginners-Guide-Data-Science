Great cake! everybody loved is and baking time was right. I was surprised, too, at the low baking temperature, but cake came out great. Cake is fairly thin and light, so baked through great and if oven temperature is higher, the coconut would burn

This recipe is absolutely delicious. I accidentally left off the last part once, forgetting to pour the cream over the top, but it still went fast at an outdoor party. YUM!!

I won't make this again because it is bland. Maybe a little vanilla would be helpful.
