These were tasty. I used london broil and marinated for 2 hours. I would recommend a longer marinating time than that as the flavor did not penetrate the meat as much as I would have liked. I think 4 hours would do the trick well. I also had more than 1lb of meat so I doubled the marinade as well as the garlic and garlic chili sauce since we like things hot. I only added about 2 tsp of sesame oil since I don't LOVE it and it can quickly overpower the flavor of a recipe but that is certainly personal taste. I broiled mine for about 5 mins on each side and also cut some larger than others as I like my beef "mooing" off my plate. I would certainly say to toast the sesame seeds before garnishing as it adds a wonderful flavor. Also as a side note dont forget to let the meat rest for a few minutes before you go poking em with toothpicks (I didn't use toothpicks in mine) to let the juices settle a bit otherwise they are gonna run all over the plate instead of staying in the meat like they need to. All in all a good solid recipe they will make a great appy or a great meat for dinner!!

This recipe received mixed reviews from my very picky family...some loved it, and some hated it. Because beef tenderloin is SO expensive, I used some rib eye steak from the freezer. Rib eye is not quite as expensive as tenderloin, but it is still an excellent cut! I had two pounds of meat, so I doubled the marinade, but only used 1/3 cup of teriyaki sauce later on. I also used fresh chives from my garden instead of green onion. Because of my picky family, who hates anything remotely spicy, I skipped the chile garlic sauce. I marinated the beef for 2 hours before I broiled it. After the beef was cooked through, I transferred everything to a large skillet, and brought the liquid to a boil. I whisked about a teaspoon of cornstarch into the 1/3 cup of teriyaki sauce that I used, poured this into the skillet, and brought it back to a boil. This way, the juices adhered to the beef, and locked in all that flavor. This beef does offer a beautiful presentation...I put rice into the bowls, topped it off with some of the beef, sprinkled it with sesame seeds and chopped fresh chives, and served with Ginger Veggie Stir-Fry from this site...it was the perfect accompaniment! Thanks for sharing this recipe...it is very tasty!

These are yummy! I used sirloin (because tenderloin is pretty expensive here) and it came out good. I marinated for about 2Â½ hours and the flavour was noticeable - next time I will marinate longer. Made my own teriyaki sauce and ended up putting the finished bites into a saucepan with the teriyaki (because I wanted the sauce to stick more.) Added a bit of cornstarch to thicken it up - Worked perfectly! Must have taken a few minutes to do. I didn't serve it as an appetizer, but instead served this over vegetable lo mien which I stir fried in some teriyaki sauce to compliment the bites. It was great! Yummy! I will definitely make this again - just as an appetizer or to serve with another dish. Great both ways. Thanks for sharing.

I couldn't see any reason to use tenderloin in this recipe.  I used a boneless chuck steak cut into 1" cubes but any flavorful cut of beef would work.  I ended up marinating it for 24 hours because something came up and I couldn't cook it when planned.  It had no ill effect.  We are not teriyaki fans, so I made double the amount of the marinade and heated it while the meat cooked.  I poured that over and sprinkled with toasted sesame seeds.  I also served this as a main course over wide egg noodles cooked with fresh spinach.  The plate looked good and tasted good.  We will have this again. Thanks for the recipe.

I marinated overnight and panfried instead of baking. I also mixed in teriyaki right into the marinade. Served with Udon noodles. Very yummy - the bf went back for seconds!

This was really good- I followed the recipe all the way, except I used sirloin instead of tenderloin due to the price- I also took the advice to marinate it for about 4 hours in the fridge. It was delicious! I served up some stir-fried fresh green beans with mine- this was so easy to make, I will make it again :)

I used meat labeled London Broil (=flank, I think), marinated for 12 hrs. The marinade's flavor did penetrate throughout. I tasted the broiled meat before adding the teriyaki. Tender enough, but I wanted something else in the flavor.... Once the teriyaki was added, its sweet taste overpowered most of the beef's taste. I think broiling the meat again in the last minute with only some of the teriyaki would be better, making it a sticky glaze, but not so drippy sweet. Either way, do keep an eye on the broiling, in case the juice/meat catches fire. (Mine did catch on fire. No problem: I pulled the sheet out of the oven for a few seconds until the fire went out. Maybe prevent that by having the rack actually 6" away from flame - instead of only 3-1/2" away like I'd done!)  This was served as an appetizer. It was alright, but I would've preferred it over rice & vegetables. The sesame seeds & green onions added great flavor & visual appeal.

This was wonderful!!!  DH loved it & wants me to make it again soon.  I couldn't find any garlic chili sauce at the grocery store :-(  but used regular chili sauce & added garlic powder.  We had this as a main dish & had rice & mixed veggies to go with it.  I was really, really pleased with this recipe!!  Thanks for sharing it!!

This is a very tasty recipe, and although I'm a vegetarian, I used to prepare homemade seitan, and it worked out very well-crispy edges, good flavor. I would recommend listing it as a seitan recipe so the veggie community can enjoy. The only downside, hence the four stars, is the large quantity of salt and coloring/fake stuff in hoisin and teriyaki sauces. Tasty, easy, but not as healthy as we usually shoot for.

Very delicious! I used sirloin and marinaded for about 4 hours. Turned out very tender with lots of flavour. We had as a main course and served it over brown rice with a side of stir-fried veggies. As suggested by other reviewers, make sure you don't forget the sesame seeds. They really add to the dish.

We liked this recipe but I did it a bit differently. I used a cheaper cut of steak but still marinated it for the same amount of time. Instead of cubing the meat I thinly sliced it and then after marinating it I cooked it over high heat on the stovetop like a stir fry. Leftovers were excellent also.

I decided to try to adapt this for a slow cooker. I know this is a quick recipe, but I wanted to use a cheaper cut of meat and didn't want to deal with marinating (I often forget about it in the fridge).
 I happened to have some bottom round sliced for carne asada so I just sliced it into strips and tossed with all the ingredients except the green onions and sesame seeds. (I don't think green onions lend themselves well to slow cooking).
I cooked on low til fall apart tender, sprinkled on green onions and sesame seeds and family enjoyed it over rice.  
I am giving 5 stars because I didn't change the ingredients.  This was very flavorful and i will try it again with different cuts of meat

Better than expected.  With so many different flavors, I wasn't sure how this was going to turn out.  I was pleasantly surprised!  Just enough flavor to satisfy but didn't overpower the wonderful flavor of the tenderloin.  Served it over "Quick Chinese-Style Vermicelli" and beside "Chinese Green Bean Stir-Fry", both from this site.

I don't really eat sauces, but I wanted to learn how to broil a steak. The meat itself was very good & flavorful. I left out the Teriyaki step. Next time I will just use Canola Oil, Sesame Oil to me just smells/tastes funny. It's a super quick, easy way to get a meat done. It would have been really good eaten as a steak salad. Thanks!

Ummm - delicious! The whole time I was at the store buying the various oils and sauces required for this recipe, my husband was grumbling that we needed so many. All grumbles were put aside when this came out of the oven. The only change I made was to steam some broccoli and toss it with the beef at the final stage before serving. Well, that and I think we used cut up chuck steaks as they were on sale at the time. We ate this as dinner over basmati rice, and then went back to nibble at it so often that there were no left overs to wrap up for the next day. We will definitely be making this again. As a word of caution, if you don't regularly make a lot of food with more asian geared spices and oils (and, like us, have run out of a few that we had), the start up costs for this recipe can be a bit steep for the student/recent grad cooking crowd, though there is definitely enough left over in the bottles to make this again and again and again.

Another phenomenal dish from Allrecipes.com. I used thick cut rib eye steak and followed the recipe as written. I marinaded it over night though and this was quite a hit for my Valentine and I. Served with white rice and steamed broccoli. Outstanding! I forgot to put the sesame seeds though and that would have made it even better....next time

Very good!  I marinated for about 2 hours and I think I will do it longer next time.  I liked the flavors together.  The teriyaki  sauce was a nice touch.  We served it over white rice.  I will be making this again!

This recipe lacked all sense of flavor and needs some major changes.  I will go back and read other reviews to see what others changed if I ever decide to try it again.

SO good! Doubled the chili garlic sauce because we like it spicy and used moose meat. Let it marinate about an hour and a half - flavor was delish! This will be in our regular rotation.

I pulled them at 7min and they were quite overcooked.  The sauce had a nice taste, but I think it would be better to either cook shorter or cook then cut and toss in sauce...

This was great! But to put more veggies on the table I just stir fried the meat and set it aside then addes bokchoy and one inch pieces of scallions and broccoli and mushrooms....then added the meat back with the sauce. Served with Brown Jasmine rice - was a hit.

This was very good. I served it on rice. I cooked it for four minutes because I like my meat medium rare. I stir fried some broccoli and fennel on the side.

This was a very tasty recipe.  I made a couple of changes.  I tripled the marinade and while the beef was cooking I used all of the excess marinade to stir fry some broccoli. When the beef was done I mixed it with the broccoli and added the teriyaki sauce.  Next time I think I will omit the teriyaki as I liked the way it tasted before I added better.

Pretty tasty, and easy as well. I used a top sirloin steak because it was on sale... added some soy sauce to the marinade. It would have been better if I marinaded for longer, but I only had about 20 minutes.

Used sirloin, otherwise followed recipe exactly. This was very well reviewed by my family - my husband kept wandering into the kitchen to have another bite. They also went over very well with company.

Excellent recipe; I would have given 4.5 stars, but I made many substitutions and simplified a few things .  Overall the sauce was perfect and after using the tenderloin will spend the money and use this in all Asian inspired dishes.  My primary changes are as follows:
- the marinade effective penetrates the beef after only a few minutes of shaking the bag and light tenderizing on counter.   I had very little prep time and was pleased the marinade worked in 5-10 mins.
- instead of broiling the meat I own fried on high heat including marinade.  Marinade cooked away for the most part.
-added broccoli while cooking meat; I only had frozen florets but hey turned out with excellent taste and texture.
-Multiple marinade ingredient substitutes, only because I lack many traditional Asian go-to's.   Primarily consisted of Apple cider vinegar, soy sauce, liquified coconut oil, half a white onion and added garlic (5 small cloves)

Nice flavor, but will change a few things. Next time we'll either sear the meat quickly as a stir fry would be, or put on the grill.  I won't be cutting the meat as small either, no need for how we'd use it. I did have a problem with the smell of the marinade, was pretty strong, but the taste wasn't.  A keeper.

Ok I must admit I didn't look at this recipe closely, and assumed it was an entee. So, I had to pull a major tweak! But I could tell by the flavors in the meat that this is a winner. As for now I have invented asian spaghetti.. lol.

This was the best recipe I have made from this website.  I used regular chili sauce instead of garlic chili sauce and it didn't make a difference. The only teriyaki sauce I could find in China was like a marinade but it was just fine.  I changed the servings to 12 because I had 1.5 pounds of the tenderloin.  It was a great amount for my family of 5 and my young boys had seconds which they rarely do because they are so picky.  Then I had extra for lunch the next 2 days. I rolled up the meat in a tortilla with cheese and put it in the microwave. That was even better!
UPDATE 2016. After making it a second time with a lower quality steak, the kids thought it was chewy but still good. All was eaten but I think I will spend the money on a tenderloin again. I used Sriracha for the garlic chili sauce  because that is what I had, and it was was fine. October 2017 update. Still a favorite but I now add in fresh ground ginger and  a little bit of brown sugar into the marinade. Yum

These were so easy, and so good!  I had a hard time hunting down chili garlic sauce, but I found it, and I'm so glad I did.  The flavors in this are fantastic!  I served it over brown rice for my husband and me, and we were both blown away.  This has made my personal recipe binder.

I used a chuck tender steak for this, marinated it for about 5 hours and then broiled. My husband loved the flavor of this and the kids really liked it. I thought that it was a little to salty but that is just me. I am very glad that I served it with some fried rice because it helped cut down on the saltiness of the dish. I would not want to eat this by itself. But it could be the brands that I used for the marinade.

In place of broiling the meat, cooked in a wok and served over a bed of rice.  Excellent flavor.

Used gluten-free ingredients and half pound of meat, and it came out nicely (not too acidic, not spicy).  It was easy to assemble and quick.  Use a broiler pan under broiler, no glass.  Used the entire bunch of green onions (red onion works too), but I double and triple sauce if adding mushrooms or using 1 lb of sirloin or lamb loin.  WARM THE TERIYAKI SAUCE BEFORE ADDING.

Flavor was great.  We used stew meat because i was too lazy to cute up the meat myself.  You definitely need to use a better cut of meat.  Will make again, just with better stuff.

I really liked this. My boyfriend liked it to. Would have given it a 3.5 at least but I can't seem to do half stars. I was more impressed than he was. Maybe I need to marinate it longer. Because you toss it with teriyaki at the end, it tasted pretty much like the teriyaki chicken bowls I make. I'll try marketing it longer than 20 minutes next time.
