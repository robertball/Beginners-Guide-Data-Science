In this house, we call these mini quiches. As long as you keep the eggs/milk the same, you can use whatever add-in's you like. My family loves this made with homemade turkey sausage and pepperjack cheese.

Delicious and soooo easy! I couldn't find the size container of biscuits listed, so I used 1 container of Grands flaky layer biscuits, pulled each in half and used one half per muffin cup (got 16 out of the recipe), and that worked perfectly b/c that was just about how many I needed! I used my blender to blend the eggs w/ the milk, also adding in some salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder. I blended that for about 30 seconds, and proceeded w/ the recipe. I did 1/2 w/ the bacon and cheese and 1/2 w/ just cheese b/c my dad doesn't like bacon (crazy, I know!). I topped them w/ a lttle parsley before baking, just for some added color. These smelled heavenly while baking and were the hit of Christmas morning breakfast! I can't wait to try different flavor combos...this recipe is a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

These are yummy and can be made ahead and eaten all week long for a portable breakfast.  Make sure to use either a nonstick muffin pan or PAM because the biscuits will stick!

This recipe was a huge hit for my family. I didnt have bacon so I used turkey sausage and cut it into little pieces instead. Also, we made corn meal gravy and regular sausage as a side (because someone wanted to doubt the turkey gravy). When it came out we poured the gravy on top and OHHHHHH. we ran out of gravy FAST! Perfect with the biscuits. We did have alot of leftover eggs mix. Next time Ill use half the amount. all in all though it was great. Will be having frequently now.

I served these for brunch today to a friend, my 14 year old and hubby. Everyone thought they were good, but nothing to ooh and ah over.  Mine looked nothing like the photo. They  puffed out like muffins. I baked for 3 minutes less than recipe called for because they seemed well set. I think I could have taken them out even a minute sooner because the biscuits were a little tough. I split the biscuits in half and used one half per muffin cup leaving me with 2 extra biscuits. I also had some egg mixture left over. I used more meat and cheese than the recipe called for and that could be why I had egg left over. But I liked the amount of meat to egg ratio I had. 

I made half bacon, onion cheese and half ham onion cheese. They were ok and nice for a buffet brunch but I think the recipe needs tweaking. Maybe some sharper cheese or something to liven it up. Overall a decent start and would be a hit for meals where you want something  that would please adults and kids. 

I try this again making my own biscuit dough and experiment with fillings.

Amazing turn out, couldn't find the 10 oz can of layered biscuits, so I went with a larger honey butter flavor can. I believe the name was Grands? Made 16 with extra egg leftover. I messed the first two up because I halved in the center of the biscuit(blonde moment on my part) it makes more sense to halve in layers. Love that I can save them to be reheated later. Will be making this again!

Very good recipe. I put mushrooms and spinach. It's important not to put too much stuff in each biscuit. Mine spilled over! Otherwise than that great.

Easy and tasty! I used a std. size muffin tin and cut the recipe in half. I still had enough for a can of 10 regular biscuits and I had egg and bacon left over! I used a whole biscuit for each instead of half because they were smaller than Grands. I also tried using crescent rolls for the dough. They tasted good but the dough was harder to work with.

My family really liked these and it's an easy recipe for a weeknight! There was a lot more biscuit than egg in each muffin, so next time I'll use half a biscuit for each. I also added mustard powder for a little extra flavor.

I added shredded broccoli as well which cooked with the eggs. Only change would be to not add any salt. The biscuits are fairly salty plus of course the bacon has a bunch of salt already as well.

Made this today and it was great! Changed it up a bit. Added saut√©ed onions, peppers and used sausage instead of bacon.

Great for parties and/or brunch!  My SIL brought these for Thanksgiving appetizers and I found this recipe to replicate them.  I seemed to have lots of egg, bacon and cheese leftover so I made some mini quiches which are in my opinion, the perfect size.  I would add some salt and pepper to the mix next time and maybe use a more flavorful/tangier cheese than sharp cheddar as I found them to be a little bland.  Got rave reviews at the brunch though!  Will definitely make again!

I uses only 4 extra large eggs and still had egg running over the cups even after I made the sides higher like one would a pie crust. Egg ran over the sides and into the oven, made a mess.  I won't do this one again, I'll just make a quiche instead. YMMV.

I made this recipe according to the instructions; And I also watched the video. I think the recipe should specify the type of biscuit to use. I used "Grande" brand biscuits. And according to the recipe and the video, you use a whole biscuit as the base for each muffin cup. I was only able to get 8 muffin cups filled. And after they cooked, it looked like an explosion  went off in the oven. They had risen so much that the egg spilt out and everything ran together. However, in spite of its appearance, it was still edible, but was way too biscuity.  The istructions say to put 2 biscuit halves into each cup, so I thought perhaps they meant only 1 half in each cup. Next time I will try doing that, or just buy smaller biscuits. I'm sure this is a good recipe, it just needs some tweeking. I baked something similar, with white bread,  brushed with butter, and it was far better and easier. But I thought I'd give this recipe a try.

Used diced ham instead of bacon. Added a little dill weed and paprika to egg mix. Came out delicious, but don't over fill the cups!

They spilled over so much and were a little dry. Too much effort for the taste. They are like muffins where the top is good! They looked great though!

So easy and adaptable to your own preferences.  I did use butter flavored Grands so they pulled in half easily, plus they a good size for not having to stretch too thin.  As another reviewer suggested, I did prick them.  Then I patted  out air pockets near the "bottom corners" of the cups.  I also used precooked apple smoked bacon and crisped up a few slices while I did the biscuit part.  Definitely Making these more often, probably  with some chorizo, or sage seasoned sausage, as I think it'd complement the slight sweetness of the biscuit.

some changes.   Took each biscuit dough and didn't divide it but pulled it out so it could be laid over the cup cake tin and folded it in plus pricked the bottom of the pastry with a fork. Started off with a bit of shredded cheese, then the egg. Beside adding bacon, I diced some onion and yellow/red pepper just like I do in an omelet.  Since all my crew like hot peppers, I chopped a jalapeno as the last add-in along with the cheese.

Great idea. We loved these. Such an easy recipe to tweak for everyone. We have spam lovers, bacon, sausage and vegetarians. Plus you can use so many different types of cheese. These were great at our family breakfast brunch. Thank you for the idea.!!!

It is a very rich breakfast. I did both onions and mushrooms with bacon as topping and it turned out fine. Without a muffin pan things get a little messy though.

Really yummy.. used half a biscuit per cup, egg whites, turket bacon and a delicious chili smoked salt. Would be good with any sort of leftover meat and veggie in it too
