I followed the recipe for the exception of adding chopped almonds and using homemade almond flour. I made muffins and baked them for 28 minutes. Not too sweet but very good and addictive!

I've made these before according to the recipe, but this time I used coconut oil instead of butter. Even better!! Oh, and I left out the raisins, since Hubby doesn't like them. The consistency is almost more like cookies than most muffins. I love these!
