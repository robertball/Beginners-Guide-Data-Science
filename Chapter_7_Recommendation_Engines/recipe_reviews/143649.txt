These stuffed mushrooms are amazing. I have tried to make others from recipes on this site but this one really stands out. The whole package of cream cheese is needed as it makes the filling so creamy. I also increased the green onions to 3 and chopped them finely. I doubled the crab and shrimp which I pulsated in a mini-food processor/chopper first to make it finer. The finishing touch was a ton of freshly grated parmegiano reggiano on top of the mushrooms. I also cooked the mushrooms for a bit longer than what the recipe called for as I wanted the mushrooms to be fully cooked. Then I broiled for a few minutes until the cheesy tops were browned. Mmmmmm, good. This was a huge hit at the last family gathering. Everyone could not get enough.

This is a wonderful recipe! I brought this appetizer to a dinner party and everyone loved them. I should have made more. The only change I made was to leave out the shrimp (It's a texture thing with me). Also, I doubled the recipe because I wanted to make 24 mushrooms. It turns out that a single recipe would have easily filled 24 medium sized mushrooms, or close to it. I had a lot of left over filling. I will definitely be making these again.

Absolutely amazing! I made them into stuffed portobella mushrooms, which worked great and actually used 2 cans of tiny shrimp (6 ounce) and 1 can of crab meat (6 ounce) My boyfriend and I had 2 each and we were both stuffed: SO GOOD!!!

Didn't change a thing - these were awesome! I might add a bit of parmesan cheese to the breadcrumbs used for the last step! These will be added to my collection of appetizer favorites! Use a teaspoon to fill the caps. It makes it very easy to fill and shape the stuffing!!!

I hate to be the party pooper, but I thought this was just OK. For me, it needed a little more kick -- more oomph -- not sure what. Was a little bland for my taste. Will probably keep looking for another recipe.

Delicious!  I added an extra green onion, and baked a little bit longer just to get the mushrooms really soft.  This made enough to fill 24 medium sized mushrooms.

I wish I could give these 4.5 stars!  I saw no need for the egg yolk, so omitted it.  My Christmas crowd enjoyed these, and I would make them again with a few changes--I think some parmesan mixed in would add a little something extra, and fresh chopped parsley would give nice color and flavor also.  This did make much more filling than you need for 12 mushrooms--it would probably easily fill 24.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This was excellent. I did follow the suggestion of another reviewer and added some grated parmesan and 1/4 cup of the chopped stems and I used frozen, drained shrimp cut up fine. I cut the stuffing in half and it worked out just right using a large package of mushrooms (16 oz). This is a keeper for me.

I always try to make a recipe as written before rating it.  These were OK, but needed more flavor, they were too bland for us.  We put Louisiana hot sauce on them and that helped, but if I made them again, I would add some hot sauce or cayenne to the stuffing to give it a boost, the cream cheese taste is pretty predominant,  maybe some pepper jack or even cheddar might have made them more tasty.  The seafood flavor came out more after reheating them the next day, not so much right out of the oven.

Yum! 'Nuf said.   Well, almost :)  I did add the following ingredients to the mix before stuffing the 'shrooms... Some grated parmesan, about 1/2 of the 'shroom stems, minced, and about a TBSP of red onion, also minced. I generously sprinkled more Parm' across the tops just before broiling, then sat back and accepted compliments for the rest of the day from my friends/family.  Yum was the word and I was "da --it"!

This was just okay...  I've been over the recipe many times making sure I didn't mess it up.  I made it exactly the way the recipe called for.  The filling was bland to me and it never really set.  If I were to pick this up to eat, the dressing would just drip off.

I am a true cheese lover and we really enjoyed this recipe. I added some shrimp to the cream cheese mixture and also some parmesan cheese to the bread crumbs as suggested by someone else. I can't wait to serve this as an appetizer in the Christmas season.

These mushrooms are amazing!  I love the filling.  I am thinking about trying the filling over a steak and broiling.

The filling for these mushrooms is very similar to a shrimp dip I've been making for decades.  I LOVE that dip (could eat it with a spoon) so I knew I had a winner with these mushrooms.  I took it easy on the garlic powder, using just half what the recipe directed.  Better safe than sorry  I thought.  And it was a good call.  I still tasted the garlic, but in a pleasant, delicate way.  I sure wouldn't have wanted to taste it hours later, which I'm sure would have been the case had I used the full amount!  Since I was making just enough of the these for Hubs and me, using both crab and shrimp wasn't practical as I didn't want to be left with partial cans of either.  I used all canned shrimp and filled the slight amount I was short with frozen salad shrimp. I probably added more green onion than the recipe directed, but didn't measure.  Just threw in what looked right to me.  As for the bread crumbs, I didn't have Italian bread crumbs because I don't use Italian bread crumbs.  I crushed some seasoned bakery croutons into crumbs which proved to be a delicious choice.  I served these as part of a complete dinner, broiled lobster tails and "Red Potato, Asparagus, and Artichoke Salad, also from this site, but these were so good I could have made a meal of them alone.

Outstanding mushroom.  I uses clams in place of shrimp and added old bay.  These are especially great given you do not add a signifcant amout of fat with butter like many other recipes.  Thet were great!

These were a huge hit at my last family event.  I didn't have any shrimp on hand so I doubled up on the crab.  They were wonderful and easy to make.

These were absolutely awesome.  If you can find them definitely go for larger mushrooms so you can stuff more into them.

These were incredible.  However, I'm not quite sure why the egg is necessary.??? I left it out and thought that the mixture would also be a great dip with ritz crackers.

I followed this recipe to the T and I dont think I will be making them again. I love stuffed mushrooms and have 4 or 5 different recipes I love but I havent found a seafood stuff mushroom recipe I like yet. I thought Id try this one but I didnt enjoy the canned shrimp and canned crab. I did like the cream cheese and how creamy they were, I also enjoyed the bread crumbs on top, but I will not be keeping this recipe.

These were really great. I didn't have the shrimp on hand but they were good with just the crab. Otherwise I followed the instructions exactly. They weren't dry or anything negative at all. I do suggest rinsing the mushrooms and wiping with a towel to absorb the water and then stemming. This way there isn't excess water in the pan while cooking. Delish!

I am totally in love with these mushrooms!  I added the grated parmesan in with the bread crumbs after reading the reviews and I also dipped the bottoms of the mushrooms in olive oil before placing them on the foil.  They turned out amazing.

i ve made this recipe about 3 times now. use 1/4 of a clove of garlic mince it and cook it in a stick of butter. set up your mushrooms like the recipe says but before they go in the oven dip the bottoms in the garlic butter this will keep them moist like in the restaurants.

Used fresh lump crab meat.  Delicious recipe.  Had left over stuffing so I put it in a small crock and baked it 12 minutes.  It made a delicious cracker spread.

yes!!!!!!!!!!!! Do dip your mushrooms in butter---not a fan of garlic.  Add pre cooked bacon  about 10 slices diced.  Any seafood is great.  If no seafood ?????? bacon always works! Love this-just love this!!!!!!!!!!!!!No extra cheese is necessary but does add to the presentation. Simply can't go wrong here!!!!!!!!!!

This was my first time making stuffed mushrooms.  Recipe is so easy and delicious.  I substituted fresh shrimp and left out the crab because I was serving these with crab legs.  Next time I will use both fresh shrimp and fresh crab!

This is a very easy recipe that my friends really loved.  I did not use the breadcrumbs and it was still very yummy but I admit a different texture may  have made them great.  Please not that if you plan to double the recipe you will have plenty of stuffing left. This could easily work for a double batch.

Great, just a tiny bit bland though. I wish there was something to spice it up. The texture of the seafood and the baking times are right on. I may add a small amount of diced Jalapenos next time.

I'm sorry to have to say that I didn't like this recipe at all.  I followed it exactly as stated.  It was bland and I tasted the cream cheese and not much of the crab or shrimp.  I was very disappointed and would not recommend this one.

I get asked to make these as well as pass on the recipe all the time! They are a favorite at home and in the work place. My husband and I love garlic, so I add extra to my "shrooms". I also add an extra can of crab, lemon pepper, and omit the breadcrumbs. YUM!

This turned out great. I had to cook it a bit longer as the mushrooms were not cooked enough for us. I also added parmasean cheese to the bread crumbs and brushed it with butter. YUMMY.

These are THE BEST EVER!!! I have been making these for several years now and they are great this way, but I usually mix in a little mayo and I always add Old Bay seasoning and some cocktail sauce, and a few scallions, according to taste. Many times I make this as a WARM DIP for crackers or breads and heat it in a casserole dish with cheeses and parmesan melted on top. It is fabulous either way and I hope you try it - it is the rave when I take it to Christmas dinner (since all the other food is traditional, folks LOVE it!)and I have people actually ask me to bring it to functions and no one seems to forget the wonderful flavors. IT REALLY IS THE BEST AND A MUST TRY! Thanks for this one! Rae in Virginia.

This is a wonderful base recipe for stuffed mushrooms. It's creamy without being too creamy. I always read the reviews prior to making any recipe. I did take some of the comments into consideration when making it myself. I added about 1/3 C finely chopped vidalia (sweet) onion (omitting the green onion) along with some finely chopped fresh chives and fresh parsley from my herb garden. I also added 1 T Parmesan to the 1 T bread crumbs (I used whole wheat seasoned Italian). Also used baby bella/crimini mushrooms and finely chopped about 1/2 the stems and added them to the mixture.I used 1 pound of lump crab and omitted the shrimp. I also melted 1 stick butter with about 1 clove garlic finely minced and poured that into the baking pan before adding the stuffed mushrooms. Topped with a mixture of 1/2 C whole wheat Italian seasoned bread crumbs and added about 1/2 C Parmesan cheese to that. Baked them about 20 minutes then popped them under the broiler for a very short time til golden and lovely. As noted by others this recipes as it is, makes a lot more than 12 mushrooms, so be sure to have more on hand OR take the remaining filling and put it in a greased baking dish, then bake to heat through.  Serve with your favorite crackers...YUM!!! I will add the adjusted/adapted recipe to my collection of favorite recipes. Enjoy!

These were amazing. Added parmesan to the breading.  Made 12 medium mushrooms.  I had so much filling left over I chopped up the stems and added them to the filling, put it in a glass pan with some EVOL, covered with the crumbs and baked it.  Made an amazing dip.

These were fine, but way too much cream cheese.  Next time would cut cream cheese in half and add another can of crab.  I would also add hot sauce to the mix.  To cut back on carbs, I topped with parmesan cheese rather than bread crumbs.

These were tasty, but made WAY too much stuffing. I doubled the recipe, cause I was using 36 mushrooms (about a pound and a half total) and I had more than half of the stuffing left. I guess I'll make some more!

I thought this recipe would be outstanding based on the seafood ingredients.  It was okay but not great - a little bland for my taste.  As others have mentioned, it needed something.  I did include 2 chopped green onions instead of one.  Maybe next time I'll include some Old Bay seasoning and maybe a little parmesan.  My wife liked it more than I did and would give it a 4 star rating so remember how subjective these rating opinions are.

The mushrooms need to be big. I bought large white mushrooms but they fit very little stuffing in them. I ended up making the entire box of mushrooms and still had filling left over. We stuffed crescent rolls with the leftover filling - those were so good too. I love making these mushrooms but need o find bigger caps.

The recipe leaves quite a bit to be desired. The stuffing mixture to mushroom ratio is way off; I could have stuffed twice the mushrooms I bought. I don’t find the stuffing particularly flavorful. I thought the egg might make it set a little firmer, but the filling was quite wet, so why bother with the egg?

Great taste. The only problem was that I ate 6 of them and felt bad afterward. I think eating 1 or 2 for an appetizer would be ok. Don't make as your main course.

Really bland, not sure I would even bother to rework it. Just sort of mushy and flavorless.

I had so much fun w/ this recipe, I made my filling w/ Tonys creole seasoning, and extra seafood. I kept the Leeks  out, I used peppers cut real small.  I agree the seafood needed to be put in mini food processor, to chop them real small.  Topping them w/the fresh parmisan cheese and a quick broil, I blinked and they were gone.  My husband saved me one , I love to see everyone so happy!

I followed the recipe for all except I  used  fake crab filling . My wife and son loved them .I did not care for the texture . The mushrooms had lots of moisture and the crab (fake) seemed dry. I would try again using the shrimp and crab .Seemed like a good idea. I'll just have to try again.

I made this almost exactly, using all crabmeat.  Too cream cheesy and relatively bland.   No one ate them at my party--thank goodness I had other hearty appetizers.  I will go back to bread-based stuffed mushrooms or use a deviled crab recipe to stuff them.

Like it, used canned crab and tiny shrimp.  Will improve next time using fresh crab and shrimp.  Found the cream cheese  to be main ingredient, probably due to canned seafood.  I did add parm to bread crumbs and sprinkled more parm on top.  Baked 22 minutes because my shrooms were very large. Also added dash of cayenne. Will make again.

This was a good basic recipe. I would have given it 5 stars if it had parmesan cheese added and either a few tablespoons of a diced green pepper or one jalapeño. Other reviews said it was "missing something" and its missing that green pepper or jalapeño flavor. I added three TB of parmesan cheese and three TB of pepper jack cheese along with the jalapeño and it was YUMMY. Other than that followed the recipe as is. It filled about 18 large mushrooms.

I tried to make this a low fat treat by using fat free cream cheese. Not a good idea. If I made it again with the fat free I would only use 4 oz. - it was a little runny. I had 20 large mushrooms and still had lots of filling left over. I added the parmesan and it was good. I topped a couple with pepper sauce after they were cooked and I liked the added punch.

This was great. I doubled the recipe which left way too much stuffing. I used it all up after buying more mushrooms.

This was awesome! My son (13 and wants to be a chef) and I made these. We added some Colby Jack cheese and Bread crumbs to the top. We dripped the mushrooms in butter. It turned out excellent...even with the Worcestershire sauce(ugh)!

Loved it!  I used large Portobello mushrooms, omitted the shrimp and used extra crab.  A local restaurant serves their crab stuffed mushrooms with a bit of demiglaze in the baking dish.  I used undiluted beef consomme and just added enough to cover the bottom of the dish.  It gives a great flavor to the mushroom without affecting the flavor of the stuffing.

Followed recipe exactly. Found them a little dry and bland. Made way too much stuffing, I even hollowed out my mushrooms a little bit more than just the stems. Had 12 Large mushrooms, mounded the stuffing inside and on top, and still had almost 1 1/2 cups of stuffing left over. I don't know what these were missing, but I wasn't thrilled with the final outcome.
