I actually marinated the prawns, then sauteed them in butter and garlic.  Afterwards, I reduced the marinade and put on angel hair pasta.  It was excellent.

This was FANTASTIC! I tweeked it a little. I added three heaped tbsp of dijonnaise mustard (DIJON/MAYONNAISSE), melted butter, and twice the amt of garlic into the marinade. Marinated it for one hour. Instead of grilling them i poured the marinade into a shallow pan, took the sauce up to the boil and then stirred in the rest of the prawns until cooked! The sauce was great served with freshly baked rolls.

I'm not sure why there aren't any other reviews for this recipe.  It was very good.  Maybe some people are turned off by the term prawn.  Anyway, it is a good recipe that both my family and friends enjoyed on Father's Day.  Thanks.

Pretty good Marinade.  I also have to remind myself not to marinate too long because the shrimp turns out rubbery.  I cooked this about 3 minutes a side and still overcooked it.

This is wonderful!!! I have made something very similar to this many times for parties, and people go crazy!!!!  I also add a little melted butter (about 1 T) to the marinade and leave them marinating overnight, I also add more garlic, since my family loves lots of it!!!

Great taste!  I added a little more garlic too.  I only had time to marinate for about 20 minutes and they still had a great flavor.

Only had time to marinate for 20 minutes but it was still flavorful. I didn't have lemon or orange so I added 1 tablespoon each of lemon juice and Sunny-D (all I had). It was still great!

These were very good.  I did leave them in the marinade for 2 days, and they were still yummy.  I also used fresh basil, since I had some. Very good shrimp on the barbie.

Not wanting to bother with the grill I decided instead to try this as a sauté to serve with pasta. The only thing different I did was add a little salt and pepper, red pepper flakes, a pinch of orange zest (I was juicing it anyway...waste not want not!), and some fresh rosemary and basil to the mix as written. Oh, and probably more wine than was called for. :)
I then let the shrimp marinade in it all for about 20 minutes before sautéing. I cooked the marinade until it was nice and bubbly while the pasta was cooking, then added the shrimp until they were done. I also cooked asparagus in the sauce for a side. Initially I thought it would be too mustardy (not my favorite) but that overpowering flavor seemed to cook out a little so it was fine. 
I think this recipe as is makes a pretty good marinade, and not only for shrimp. Just a note in general: When marinating something light like a fish filet or shrimp I wouldn't marinade for longer than one hour tops as it tends to make the fish or shrimp mealy.
As for this recipe, when sautéing again, I'll do it like I did this time, only cut back at least half the oil as I thought the sauce it made was just too oily. Good as is for a marinade though. However that didn't stop me and my husband from scarfing it all down! We'll diet when we're dead....

I followed another review and I heated up the marinade mixture and boiled it up.  I did add extra garlic in the marinade and used OJ because I didn't have an orange.  I then added the prawns.  It was a great meal with roasted asparagus and whole wheat couscous!

Simple yet delicious! I marinated them for 9 hours and grilled them on my health grill/sandwich press. Found there was little sauce but enough for our liking. Maybe add more garlic as found the taste could be a bit more stronger. I'd cook this again any day.

My family loved this recipe.  I marinaded it all day and then pan cooked the sauce and thickened it adding cornstarch/water.  I heated the shrimp on the stove.  I served it with the sauce.

Outstanding marinade.  Used extra-large shrimp and marinated overnight.  Grilled over hot coals exactly 5 minutes.  I will be making these again and again during grilling season (and maybe after).

So delicious ......used orange juice since I had no fresh orange. And also added about 2tblspns of olive oil and some fresh cracked pepper and a pinch of salt. Yummy marinade that I used on extra large shrimp instead of prawns. A great grilled meatless Friday dinner. Thanks!

We made these last night at a condo in North Lake Tahoe. We imrovised with what we had: bottled orange juice instead of fresh; Safeway sweet & spicey southwestern style nustard instead of dijon & we had no basil.  They tasted great!  We reduced down the marinade to baste with before grilling allowing it to stick on better since they cook so quickly.  Will do again and again!  Sauteeing them with the sauce and putting over pasta sounds yummy too.  I'll have to give that a try next.

The prawns were very good. I make them in a frying pan. I took other people's advice and served it with the sauce over pasta and that was not very good. But I would definitely make the marinade prawns again!

You have to be careful not to marinate the prawns for no longer than an hour or it will cook in the citrus juice and become ceviche.

Super delicious marinade! You can simmer the leftover sauce on your stovetop while the shrimp are cooking on the grill and have it to pour over angel hair pasta, rice, etc. Just make sure to simmer it for several minutes to cook it through. Also, if you are using wooden skewers, remember to soak them in water before threading the shrimp onto them so they don't burn on the grill.
I have to agree with the the others who warn not to marinate these for too long. Shrimp is delicate and you don't want a mealy texture. So don't marinate for more than an hour - and it's not necessary to anyway. Shrimp, when fresh and cooked properly, are always tender and they absorb flavors quickly. Enjoy!

So very good!  I marinated for about six hours instead of one and the flavor was delicious.  Don't forget to soak wood skewers in cold water first for an hour or you'll have matchsticks on the grill.

This was super good! Only thing I would change is the amount of lemon juice - just a tad bit too much and not enough garlic.

This is a favourite in my house now.  Often my teenage daughter will make it for dinner if just her and I are home (hubby and other daughter not huge fans of seafood) and I will make a simple salad. ummmmmm

Wow.  Loved these prawns.  I, too, reduced the marinade and used it to dip prawns in as we ate them.

This marinade was so easy and delicious.  We had guests that need to restrict their sodium intake, so this was the perfect marinade (167 mg Sodium).  I used fresh basil in place of dried and the prawns were wonderful.  Everyone loved them.

I made these this summer for a back yard BBQ, and used jumbo tiger prawns...the marinade was out of this world.  It did not over power the taste of the delicious shrimp!  The recipe goes perfectly with a light dry Chardonnay!

This was delicious!  I used this marinade for chicken rather than prawns.  Instead of basil, I used cilantro.  Yum!  I will definitely make this again and share the recipe with others.

I simmered the shrimp in the marinade & added buttered noodles to the sauce.  Next time I will add artichoke hearts to it as well.

This was very good and easy to make. Reminded me of scampi but with a mild citrus kick. I used fresh basil as it is summer and I am growing tons of it. Served it over couscous and thickened the sauce with a little canned chicken broth and cornstarch to pour over the dish. You can serve this with/over anything from potatoes to pasta.

I followed the recipe except I went for a smaller shrimp as I just couldn't afford the prawns. I also made them in my cast iron skillet. Amazing! I can't wait to clean my grill and get some prawns on sale!

Every garlic lover's perfect recipe, even the neighbours poked their heads over the fence and asked what we were grilling. Quick and easy.  I followed the recipe to a tee and can't recommend any type of changes. Thanks for the fantastic recipe!!

Thank's to my families allergies I never liked seafood, until now. I thought these were delicious. I made it exactly as directed but let them sit over night. We grilled them on kabob stakes...yum. Next time I will try a smaller lemon and larger orange.

Loved it & so did hubby!  I was actually surprised about the orange & Dijon involved in the recipe but this turned out so yummy!  I was only able to marinate for 1 hour but it was still flavorful.  Thank you!

I omitted the orange juice and mustard because I didn't have them on hand, but the recipe still went well. I added more herbs cos I like the smell and taste of basil.   It was a fairly good recipe, just that I prefer a milky sauce (like those I've tried in Perth).

Great recipe. I've tried it multiple times and everybody loves it. I do triple the Garlic, but thats just because I am a Garlic lover. There are lots of good prawn recipes but not alot of great ones. This one is a keeper in my recipe box.

So, so, SO yum! I stumbled across this recipe in the attempts at throwing something together quickly for dinner. The one hour marinade sort of put a kink in that but SO worth it! The only thing I had to tweak was adding apple juice with a splash of dark rum instead of white wine because I didn't have any. I also added triple the amount of dried basil. I also added a bit more Dijon mustard after tasting a bit too strong of lemon.

I substituted fresh chopped cilantro for the basil, and pan fried the (fresh) prawns (without tails);   served with a sauce comprised of low fat mayo, alioli and some hot sauce.  They were devoured as an appetizer!

Hubby gave this two thumbs up, and he usually drowns his prawns in butter. I didn't have a fresh lemon or orange. I just used 1 1/2Tbs lemon juice and 3Tbs orange juice, and it still turned out well.

Super recipe!
I ended up marinading my prawns all day (like, 10 hours) and they turned out SO good!
Perfect marinade!

I was suprised that I didn't like it. I was pretty excited w/ the ingredients. I think I'd like to try it on something like asparagus, but on the prawns (my husband caught that day) the flavor was overpowered by the citrus. There was no prawn flavor at all. To top it off I didn't care much for the texture from grilling. Next time I'll stick to the old fashioned method.

I added 1 T of melted buttter and little cayenne pepper (1/4 tsp) for some extra spice. I didn't have time to grill, brought mixture to a boil then simmered until cooked through.  Very tasty!

I loved the citrus flavours of these prawns. I found pre-skewered, de-vained prawns at the grocery store so all i had to do was marniate them. Great on the BBQ.

I tried this out when my family came to town and "experimented" on them...it was a hit!  I used freshwater shrimp and kept it on the grill a couple minutes longer...served it over coucous with green peppers and tomatoes

This is a wonderful marinade! I bbq'd chicken along with it using the same marinade. My family loved it! The only thing I did different was omit the mustard and used lime juice instead of orange/lemon (it's what I had on hand). I think this wonderful enough to entertain with as well. Thank you!

We really enjoyed these I only had medium size shrimp. Sauteed in orange flavored olive oil and minced garlic served over angel hair pasta. Yum!!!! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Wife really liked the marinade and the reduction was subtle, but great, on pasta. Accidentally added two tablespoons of basil and turned out fine.

I have made MANY recipes off this site and many of them have been great but this is the  first time one has been so good that I actually wrote a review.  YUMMMMMMY! I had 35 Jumbo shrimp and no lemons or oranges so I doubled everything in the marinade and used half a cup of lemon juice and half a cup of orange juice. Only had to grill 2 minutes each side. These were fantastic mouthgasmic!  Cannot wait to have them again!!

The only change I made was I used honey mustard because that is what I had. Great balance of flavors. Super easy!! This one goes in the favorites for sure!!

I didn't have any dijon mustard, so I added a teaspoon of horseradish to the recipe.  I also added 2Tbs of melted butter to the marinade.  It was great!

The taste of the shrimp was great. I sautéed them in butter. Added extra clove of garlic. Lots of flavour. Didn't like the marinade for the sauce though. we had pesto over pasta with our prawns, will make them again on the grill in the summer.
