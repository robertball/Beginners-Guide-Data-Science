I love how quick an easy this is while being very elegant.  Adding a little cayenne or mint or lemon/orange oil make for a different twist and flavour.  Use the best chocolate you like for the best results.

For those that cannot get it to set or that the texture is grainy.  The solution is get richer cream and different chocolate.  The cream is the one that prevents the setting.  heavy cream is in the 30% fat range.  That is the requirement.  You can try whipping cream BUT some have added sugars.  The organic types usually do not.  So do not skimp, use the good cream.  As for the graininess this is usually the chocolate.  It could be too old or simply of a lower quality.  Again this is a high end desert, not chocolate pudding.  Pay a few dollars a bar for 70%+ cocoa content.  If you find it too bitter add more sugar the intensity of the chocolate is what you are looking for.  Hope I helped.

Please help me. Mine was in the fridge for over eight hours and did not set up one bit. I followed the recipe and instructions to the T, I even watched the tutorial video.
I was really crushed when I went to serve this to my husband for an early Fathers Day treat.

Oh, this one's sinful.  I made this on a large scale for a dessert bar I had for my son's graduation party.  Out of the 7 desserts I made, this was the one people went gaga over.  It's so simple.  It's very rich.  the serving size is spot on.  Any larger and you wouldn't be able to finish it.  It's funny 2 different people at my party described it as "See's candy truffle in a dish."  This was said at two different times by two different people.  This is a very rich, thick grown up pudding.  Even my husband likes it, and he's not a real pudding person.  Thanks so much Chef John.  Ya got a winner here!

WOW. I read the reviews and considering I won't attempt any dessert unless it receives a majority of rave reviews because I don't want to waste my time making something that's just okay, I am thoroughly impressed. Chef John knows his Pot de Creme. 

Followed recipe exactly. Used Ghiradelli bittersweet chocolate. Tried first serving (husband and I split it) after 4.5 hours of set time. It was terrific and I thought it was set enough.  Just ate a whole one on my own after it set in the fridge for 20 hours and it was the best Pot De Creme I've ever had, upscale restaurants and bakeries included! The consistency was dreamy - so pretty - and the flavor perfection. This was completely unadorned too, no whipped cream or garnish. Cannot wait to makes these for friends coming over for holiday wine and dessert next week! Thank you, Chef John!

Since having this in  September, this is our 'go to' dessert recipe.  We leave out the coffee.  Since we always make at least double the recipe, we cut up the chocolate in the food processor.  One hint, the cream has to be almost boiling or it doesn't set up.

I can't stop eating this dessert! I have made it 3 times and the only change I make is that I add a little extra instant coffee. This dessert goes great with raspberry vodka and other strong liquors (in very small amounts - usually a few drops per serving). The longer you keep this in the fridge the more the chocolate will clump together and harden - but I like it better that way. Brilliant!

Wow.  What can I say.  I don 't even eat dessert ever!!! But I certainly ate this one.  So very easy to make.  The prep time and cook times are right on the money.  I used Lindt 70% chocolate and it was perfect.  Thank you Chef John this is about the fourth or fifth recipe of yours that I have tried and they are all excellent.

Instead of 70% chocolate, I used 85% and left out the whip cream as garnish and instead used more chocolate.

Fabulous recipe!!!! With its great taste and easy preparation, it will certainly become part of my "fancy" dessert collection. I can't wait to try some variations like orange zest, fresh raspberries, etc. I served it with the recommended lightly whipped cream and chocolate shavings, along with homemade chocolate biscotti that we used as spoons - YUM! 

Word of warning, though: as written, this recipe definitely makes 4 servings - I split it between two small dessert bowls instead of four espresso cups and it was waaaaay too much to eat in one sitting. 

I would also *strongly* recommend that you use really good quality chocolate. When a recipe has only a few ingredients, it is absolutely essential that you don't skimp when stocking them or the finished product isn't going to be as good.

OMG--this is far too easy to make, and therefore to eat ALL the time. Definitely choose good chocolate, because much of the taste will be affected by that choice. I followed the directions exactly, but actually divided it between five small ramekins and could have gone even smaller--it's so rich that a few bites are all that are needed if you're finishing off dinner. This is a very dense, intensely flavorful dessert that is smooth and creamy. NOT a light dish, but definitely delicious. My DH and DD both love it.

Okay, I made this loaded, rich, decadent dessert and at first thought, WOW, who do I know that can finish even a single serving? No one! So I experimented and after it had set up for a few hours in the fridge I drizzled, just a touch mind you, some Cointreau over the top, just enough to cover the top with the thinnest of layers. I left the serving in the fridge overnight and WOW! had turned into Holy Cow! just how delicious can anything taste. I LOVE THIS RECIPE!!!! And then, on my next try, I dropped about 1/2 teaspoon of PEANUT BUTTER in the bottom of the cup, filled it with the chocolate, and SURPRISED everyone at the table. I tell ya I'm a HERO around here. This recipe is endless!!!!

Absolutely decadent!  Truffles on a spoon! I topped mine with some grated white chocolate. Follow the instructions to a T and you won't have grainy chocolate or have it fail to set up.  Don't over heat the cream, just to under a boil, stir constantly to dissolve the sugar, pour it over the chocolate, let sit for the full minute and whisk, whisk, whisk, until it starts to get a little thick.  I put mine on the upper shelf in my fridge (the coldest part) and it was perfectly set in the four hours stated.  Do use good quality chocolate, I used Lindt 70%. I also used Splenda instead of sugar.  Wonderful results.  Making this again, for sure!  UPDATE! Made this substituting raspberry extract in place of the vanilla.  AWESOME!!!!!

This is incredible!  I first made it with cayenne for an amazing little bit of heat after the initial rich chocolate flavor.  Everyone I've made it for had requested it again and again--even friends who aren't dessert people.  This is the best dessert I've ever had.  Looks fancy yet is very simple.

I followed the directions exactly and it came out fantastic! 2 oz. ramekins worked perfectly. I received many compliments from my guests. On the reviews that stated it turned out gritty, I was wondering if they used regular coffee instead of instant coffee as directed. This desert was a perfect finish to a nice meal.

Mmmm. This is FANTASTIC. It's terribly rich and melts on the tongue. I used the Starbucks VIA instant coffee for this. Try garnishing with a sprig of mint and/or a slice of strawberry. Use small ramekins or soy sauce bowl sets.

This is stupid simple to be so elegant!  Everyone loves it and it is so rich and decadent that you can serve it in demitasse or sherry glasses.  I hate it when people turn down a dessert I have slaved over, because they are stuffed, but no one will turn down a wee bit of chocolate after a meal.  I have also melted raspberry jelly and put 1 spoonful on top.  Wonderful

If you are looking for a rich, chocolate dessert, this is for you.  It didn't set up as tight as I would have wished despite having it in the refrigerator overnight, but it was still good, just a little too rich for me.

Rave reviews the first time I made this for a family get-together.  Only complaint was that they were too full to appreciate it and so a lot of ramekins-full went home with the attendees.

Being a chocoholic I can say that it lives up fully to its expectations.  Unbelievably easy to make and can be prepared a day before.  The texture and taste are to die for plus it really is elegant to serve to guests. I served it with a blob of cream on top and oven dried orange peel plus a thin crispy biscuit as accompaniment.  The only change I made was to replace the vanilla with a teaspoon of brandy. Very impressive - a family member even slunk to the kitchen secretly to lick the cup!!  Will definitely make again.... and again... and again!

Made this for my parent's anniversary as part of a special dinner. My dad absolutely loved it and was asking for more the next day. It was a little too rich for my mom, but she still seemed to enjoy it.  Followed the recipe exactly as written and refrigerated for over 6 hours. Next time I will allow to chill overnight as the desired firmness wasn't quite reached. This is a very elegant dessert and I will definitely make again!! Thanks for sharing:)

Oooh my...this is extremely delicious. I used Lyndt 70% cocoa. I chopped the chocolate in a small chopper. Put the cream into a small sauce pan, added the chocolate, decafe coffee, sugar vanilla and salt. Brought to a simmer whisking till smooth, poured into 4 small bowls. It set up nicely in fridge. Since there is only going to be 3 of us for dinner, I just had to taste, right? Oh soooo good!

This exquisite recipe cannot possibly be any easier to make than it is.   I was thoroughly impressed with the end result.   No need to modify in any way to achieve perfection.   Would not hesitate to serve to guests over for dinner.   Be sure to use a nice sharp knife when chopping your chocolate into chards or you'll end up with a very fatigued hand.  YUMMY!

It didn't set properly. The flavour was really nice but I think next time I need to add gelatine

Excellent.  Takes only a few minutes to make.  I  made this for Valentine's  day dinner, I made it the day before .  The only change I made  was I omitted the instant coffee I do not like coffee,  and  I  made 2  servings not 4.  Very rich,  I love chocolate  and I  had trouble finishing a serving.  I will definitely make again.

HELP !!  The first time I made this it was great.  I have made it twice since and it has turned out grainy.  What am I doing wrong?  I would appreciate any help.  Thank you   Sandy

Absolutely divine! This is the best desert ever. Chef John you are a genious. I did make one change though by adding a single espresso  instead of instant coffee and using 50 ml less cream. It still set beautifully.

This was sooooo good. I made it for Christmas dessert and everyone loved it. My picky father said it was restaurant quality! For such a simple recipe you get wonderful results. A definite keeper! Like previous reviewers, I agree that you must use good quality chocolate. Thank you for sharing!

This was SSOO good. I used Whipping Cream and 70%+ cocoa content chocolate bar. When making again, I'll triple the recipe.

It is THE ultimate chocolate dessert one can ask for! it is so easy to put together but looks so elegant - almost like you have slogged the whole day in the kitchen just to make this treat. For that, 5 stars!

My husband brought home ground coffee instead  of instant and I had to us a strainer, but was still good. Maybe not quite enough coffee flavor.

Made it tonight for tomorrow but just could not wait...  Had the smaller dish (made 4 1/2 custard cups) and I just had to try the 1/2 dish.  It set-up within 2 hours.  A very rich chocolate flavor, but was actually a bit grainey.  Did not add the coffee but used good heavy cream and Ghirardelli 60% cacao bittersweet chocolate.  I wonder if I should have cooked the cream a bit more???  Will make it again for grands who are chocolate-lovers.

Made this for a special Valentine's Day dinner, and the taste gets the stars.  Unfortunately while I was chopping away at the chocolate the cream came to a full boil which may have been why it didn't thicken, even after a full 8 hours in the fridge.  Gee, might just have to try it again...

I love the taste, but tried making it for 24 and even refidgerating overnight it has not set up, so disappointed! I had to use it in a chocolate trifle instead...gave it 4 stars because the taste is amazing!

Decadent, delicious, and so easy to prepare! We discovered too late (as we'd consumed the majority of it) that it's delicious sprinkling some Maldon salt flakes on top of the dessert!

Loved this dessert.  Easy to make.  Will either add more coffee or try orange zest the next time.  Thought it was a little weak on mocha flavor.  But love the silky texture and creamy consistency.  Excellent recipe.

I made it as written.  Very easy and very good, but not really pot de creme....more ganache. 
We all loved it and the only reason that I gave it four stars instead of five is because I feel that the name and description are misleading.

I'm always looking for chocolate recipe. Made this last year for the holidays and it was the first thing scooped up and wished I made more.  Looks elegant in a nice expresso cup.  Will be making it again this year but doubling the recipe!!

This got 5 stars for simplicity, texture and taste!  I made no adjustments, and it was not grainy at all.  I used Lindt 70% chocolate, and heavy whipping cream.

Not sure why, but after 24 hours in the fridge, it was a solid rock. Double-checked that I added in the correct amount of heavy cream and chocolate...will try again.

I made this without the instant coffee and substituted 2T Rum which was heated then flamed to take some of the alcohol bite out of it. I also used semi-sweet chocolate because where I live is very rural and cannot buy bittersweet. I had semi-sweet on hand, broke it into pieces in the blender, added the heated cream and rum, then blended it up until smooth. It was wonderful.

I made this for Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve (new set of people!) and it was fantastic.  I found it very easy to make, followed the recipe exactly and used Ghirardelli 60% Chocolate chips. I topped it with lightly whipped cream as suggested and dusted with cocoa powder.  The whipped cream really adds to this recipe for texture, adding a softness to the chocolate and it looks pretty and more finished.  It's hard to go wrong with this recipe.

Everyone loved this rich, simple dessert. I only let it set up 3 hours, and probably will wait the additional hour next time.  The instant coffee added great flavor, but a little "grainy" texture.  I'm sure they will ask for it again.

Very easy & elegant dessert! This is one of those dishes you will make for someone and they will think you are an amazing chef. I watched the video and read a lot of the reviews.  Defiantly use GOOD chocolate. I used the regular brand cream in the grocery store and let is ALMOST boil. No problems with it thickening up and I didn't have instant coffee so I used instant espresso (same measurement.) I left it in the frig for about 4-5 hours. It turned out fantastic! Next time, I will cut the recipe in half for my husband and I. It was too rich for two "big" servings. (There's a reason why chef serves it in an espresso cup.) I plan on making this more and trying the different variations that chef suggested in the video.

This is now my go-to company dessert! Soooo easy. Takes under 10 minutes to make.  I use the Lindt 70% 3.5 oz bar, and skip the coffee. Use heavy cream, then add 3 teaspoons of Grand Marnier when I am about done whisking. Garnish with a generous blob of whipped cream, some orange zest on top. Raves from everyone!

I made this as a Valentine's Day dessert and it was perfect!  I topped it with whipped cream and a dusting of cocoa.  I thought the whipped cream softened the dark chocolate perfectly.  I had no problems with it setting properly.  I did make sure that I whisked it for the full 2 minutes so that it was perfectly blended.  My husband loved it...I will definitely make this again!

I made this with Ghiradelli 60% cacao bittersweet chocolate and it was wonderful! It made a quick and lovely Valentine's Day dessert. This one is a keeper to make again.

Another wonderful, no-nonsense recipe from Chef John.  I doubled the recipe because anything worth doing is worth doing to excess.  I know my loved ones enjoyed it, too, because at first I got lots of "mmmmms" and toward the end it got real quiet.  Except for the sound of spoons  scraping every last bit of goodness from the sides of the glass.

This was wonderful and so easy to make, but am sure it would be better if I had the correct ingredients.  I used chocolate chips and was only able to find heavy whipping cream.  It was very sweet because of this.  I added a sprinkle of cinnamon and it was great. I want to use bittersweet chocolate and heavy cream and add cayenne pepper or touch of salt next time.

Made this for dessert tonight...it turned out awesome!  I used a 72% cocoa chocolate bar and organic heavy whipping cream.  It was super creamy and set perfectly after setting for about 8 hours.  I would make this again and again

I've made this several times now, and it turns out great.  Everyone I have treated with this says it is the best ever.  I do not use the bittersweet,   That is just too strong.  I use the semi sweet and it is fantastic.

I made this twice. First time I used Mexican chocolate and milk chocolate, it's all I had in my pantry, I was too excited to wait to try it. :-) of course not using the right percentage of chocolate, the pudding did not set all the way. So I took it out of the fridge and put it in the freezer! Best decision I made. I actually turned the failed pudding into Mexican Chocolate ice cream!! Oh my goodness! Soooo YUM!  Second attempt was better, I used 72% dark caco, Mexican chocolate & paprika. Mmmmmm.....??      Super Bon

My husband just told me this may be the best dessert I've ever served him. I agree. It was decadent and very easy to prepare. I made it exactly as written, using 70% cocoa. There are a number of variations I might try another time. I think some Cayenne would be a nice touch or a splash of a liquor such as Grand Marnier, Kahlua or Chambord might be nice. Another touch of individuality would be the dish you use. I had four little Chinese tea cups and they were the perfect size. You could also use a stemmed liquor glass or come up with an idea of your own. Play with it. My next dinner party will certainly include this divine dessert.

I made this for my family for Valentine's Day. It wasn't exactly a disaster, but it wasn't very good either. One cup of heavy cream was way too much, and four ounces of chocolate was definitely not enough. It was better after I added another four ounces of chocolate and tried to mimic my truffle recipe. But even after that, there was still too much heavy cream... not enough chocolate flavor for us.

This was so easy to make--especially if you use bittersweet chocolate chips instead of buying a bar and chopping it.  I had a 10 oz. bag of bittersweet chips and decided to use the entire bag so I increased all the other ingredients 2.5 times.  I spooned the dessert into six ramekins.  It set up very well.  It could be made elegant looking by adding a dollop of whipped cream and some fresh raspberries or ribbons of orange peel.  Tasted very good.

This was simply great. I have a knack at destroying every desert I attempt but not this one. It was so simple that I couldn't get it wrong. I just made one change to the recipe...since I didn't have bittersweet chocolate at disposal I added 50g sweet chocolate and one tbsp unsweetened cocoa powder. For everything else I stuck to the instructions and I am pretty proud of how it turned out.
