Easy to make,  I used flour tortillas because I hate frying anything in oil.  Bake the fish sticks, spread some sour cream on the tortillas and microwave for 20 seconds, add 3 fish sticks, lettuce, salsa, lime juice (cilantro if you have it), and shredded cheese.  Quick and fast cure for your fish taco craving.  This may become a staple in my regular menu.

Pretty quick and easy for when I really have a fish taco craving. Use a better grade/quality fish stick. No tartar sauce though, try sour cream and salsa mixed together. And cheddar cheese.

This is close to the way I like fish tacos, except the tartar sauce isn't what I'm used to. I like the spicy white sauce that our local fast food fish taco place uses. It is more sour cream based than mayonnaise based and has a lime and chile kick to it. This is a really easy recipe though and there are many ways to modify it to suit personal taste. Like flour tortillas, extra filling ingredients such as tomatoes and beans. Don't skip the cabbage though! Also, stick with high quality fish sticks.

I can't beleive I never thought of this before! I got fish sticks, the larger so called "filets" in a box not the little ones, on sale so I had extra in the freezer. I make homemade tartar sauce (with extra dillweed, pickle & the key is a few dashes of worstechire sauce) while the oven is preheating so it has time for the flavors to meld. Chop onions & cilantro, slice cabbage, slice "filets" width ways and put all on paper plates. I heat up corn tortillas on a pan and keep them wrapped in a towel on a small plate while chopping & cooking. We assemble as we eat them. Fresh squeezed lime is a must, and jalapenos if you like it spicy. We love to sit around and pork out on these with salt/lime rimmed Tecate. MMMMMM!

Giving this 5 stars for the brilliant idea. Used flour tortillas cuz that's what I had, and used Amy's Cilantro Cream sauce from this site isntead of the tartar. Added red onions, cuz we likie. So FREAKING GOOD and easy. My kids both ate the snot out of them w/ ranch instead of the sauce. Brilliant.

These were so quick and easy it's unreal. I halved the batch due to a smaller crowd, and one was filling enough! Will definitely make again.

What a GREAT idea!  And as other's have said "why didn't I think of this?"  I used beer batter filet's instead of fish sticks.  I added some sour cream, lime juice, cumin, cayenne, and chili powder to the tartar sauce.   They were really good and I will definitely be making these again. Thanks Chris!!

I used flour tortillas (not fried) and mixed store bought verde salsa with sour cream for the sauce. I also added some shredded cheddar. I never would have thought to put fish sticks in a taco but these are sooooo good!

I don't like to rate a recipe if I made changes, doesn't seem fair.  I tried to give a review only and not a rating, but you need to do both.  I used flour tortillas and omitted the cabbage and tartar sauce.  I took the advice of others and used sour cream, cilantro, salsa and shredded cheddar cheese.  After altering the recipe how I wanted, I thought it was just an okay recipe.

Yum! Used flour tortillas, (crisped in oven) beer battered tenders (quality counts!), shredded sharp chedder, cole slaw mix, and made a sauce out of tarter sauce, light sour cream, chopped cucumber, chopped tomato and fresh pepper.  Served with a quick italian pasta salad. (rotini, italian dressing and peppers)
~ A quick, easy and satisfying change of pace. ~ Thanks for the idea! =)

I actually thought I had thought up the idea of using fish sticks for fish tacos and popped on allrecipies.com just to find advice on the sauce.  Funny that I found this!  I bought a coleslaw kit and just used the cabbage from that in my taco and tossed the dressing.  I also added some chopped tomatoes on top and warmed the tortilla in the toaster oven.  Very good and easy meal when you want something more "exotic."

Was a perfect, easy meal for my husband to prepare for the 2 of us.  He made a slaw of cabbage with red peppers, cilantro, onions, mango, lemon and salt. Opted for ranch dressing and added some Mexican hot sauce.  Very nice quick meal.  Will definitely make again.  Deelish!!

Excellent and easy!  What a great taste.

I used Essensia southwest salsa (an Albertsons brand) and homemade tartar sauce with low fat mayo and pickles.  I found this because I had left over red cabbage and didn't know what to do with it.  You do need to pan fry the tortillas (2 T. of oil worked for 2 tortillas), I tried microwaving them for less fat and it won't work (the tortillas split and fall apart).

This was fantastic. I followed the review suggestions. I added sour cream, cayenne pepper, chili powder, salsa, and cumin to the tartar sauce. I also added the general taco topping such as shredded cheddar cheese, lettuce (but I used baby spinach as it is extra healthy for you) and tomato.

Yummy!!!  My family loved these tacos!  I would've preferred a little sauce and tried to create one but it didn't turn out right!  Not enough ingredients on hand to make a decent sauce as we were on vacation.  We just ended up using salsa!  Super yummy though, give it a try!

We were shocked how good this was!  Used Gorton's fish sticks, and instead of the sauce, we used Chipotle mayonnaise.  Fantastic!  Who knew?  Frozen fish sticks?!

Great idea Chris! Made these for dinner tonight. I purchased lettuce, tomatoes and green onion to make Chicken Salad with Bacon, Lettuce & Tomato (Britt) yesterday. Not wanting to wase "quickly to expire" fresh ingredients, I opted to use leftovers as a garnish for tacos and homemade guacamole. All I had to do was purchase fish sticks, tortillas and some fresh cilantro, so tonight's meal was very budget-friendly indeed! :-) I must admit, I was not "crazy" for these, but if you are craving crunch fish tacos, this sure beats buying frsh fish, breading and frying (not to mention the mess and expense). I did change this recipe quite a bit. As I mentioned, I used shredded lettuce, chopped tomato and cilantro and sliced green onion as a garnish in place of just shredded cabbage (although the latter is more authentic). I made Amy's Cilantro Cream sauce to use in place of the sauce called for - and boy was I glad I did! You've got to try this sauce (it's the BOMB!!!). Served with my fiance's ever-famous guacamole,  homemade tortilla chips (great use for leftover tortillas!) and Spanish rice, this was a super easy, quick Sunday evening meal. Thanks for sharing! :)

Pretty good.  Definitely quick and easy!  I have no lettuce or cabbage in the house, so I just left that out and didn't fry the shells--not a big fan of that--just microwaved them to warm them.  Not a gourmet meal, and I'm sure could be made better with regular fish, but this was perfect to use some of our tortillas and the fish sticks we have in the freezer.  I ran out of sauce and used some jalapeno greek yogurt we bought this weekend, and it was really good in these.  Thanks for the recipe!

Really good.  Made with sour cream and green sauce since I didn't have salsa.  Used lettuce since I didn't have cabbage.  Will try with correct ingredients next time.

My rating is more for the idea of using fish sticks!  I used Van de Camp fish sticks and flour tortillas.  I topped with homemade mango salsa, lettuce, tomato, and mont jack cheese.  Delicious!

These were good for something different from the 'norm'! I mean, they're not gonna blow anyone away, afterall, they're just fish sticks, but they are a tasty and fun recipe to make. I omitted the salsa and tartar sauce and made 2 different sauces- AR's Southwest Dipping Sauce and a guacamole cream sauce. Both went really well with these. I also decided to go with shredded lettuce and diced tomatoes, to suit our tastes. I wrapped my son's, who, by the way, is a fanatic for fish sticks AND tacos, lol,  in a WW flour tortilla and used the corn tortillas for ours. Thanks for sharing this quick, easy and fun recipe! :)

Everyone in the house loved this one!  I did make a couple of changes to suit our tastes: I used flour tortillas (the kids won't touch corn tortillas); mixed sour cream & salsa for the sauce (again, the kids won't touch tartar sauce); added cheese & tomatoes to the finished product.  Great idea!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

These were okay. I did add a little lime and cumin to the sauce. It was a quick meal, but just not something I would make again.

These were pretty good. They're definitely not authentic, but good for a quick dinner. Next time I will top with fresh cilantro for more color and flavor.

These are so great. They're easy to make and you can switch up the ingredients however you want and they are still good. We like to put pineappple into the tacos and the tarter sauce and salsa go very well together. Thanks a lot!

I used store bought taco shells, a bag of coleslaw mix, and Mrs. Pauls battered fillets.   Topped with store bought pico de gallo and the sauce from this recipe.  I doubted the sauce would be any good because it sounded gross, but it was awesome!  Tastes like a spicy Big Mac sauce, or special sauce.   I made the sauce with Kraft Tartar Sauce and store brand restaraunt style medium salsa.  It was fantastic!!!  Our newest favorite!!!!!

I had a huge craving for fish tacos yesterday and this filled it.  This is a good basic recipe that is easily adaptable to what you have on hand and your personal taste.  I cooked reduced fat fish sticks in the oven and heated corn tortillas in a dry non-stick skillet for 15 sec per side rather than frying them.  For the filling, I used shredded green cabbage since that's what I had and I also added diced onion, chopped tomato and shredded Mexican cheese blend.  I skipped the tartar sauce and instead combined salsa and sour cream per the suggestions from other reviews.  I also squeezed fresh lime on each taco.  Yummy!  My husband was a huge fan of these tacos so I'll be making them again soon.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I like this recipe, it stays very true to its name. Quick and easy, but also tastes great. I made it even quicker by buying coleslaw mix that was on sale and use it instead of shredding a whole cabbage. I also squeezed lime on top and sprinkled little bits of Mexican lime salt, added avocado, and crunchy tortilla chips on top.  It was yummy and healthy!!!

Had been looking for recipes that helped w/my overabundance of fish sticks, and also for a good fish taco recipe. This met both. It is super easy. I make a pico de gallo by using diced tomato, red onion, cilantro and lime juice to serve with. I also mix sour cream w/ Lawry's Baja marinade to taste to put in the tacos. This is a new favorite!

I also omitted the tartar sauce and added cilantro- as for the salsa, I used a peach salsa, it was a little sweet and brought out the flavor of the fish. And i used taco shells to save time.

Delicious and simple for a weeknight family meal!  Obviously it is a very flexible recipe and easy to make changes on preferences.  I used flour tortillas and heated them dry in a skillet.  I used both sour cream and tartar sauce.  Chopped a salad mix fine since I didn't have cabbage.  Squeezed fresh lime on and topped with salsa.  I will make again and again!

We used lettuce instead of cabbage and Chipotle Ranch dressing rather than tartar sacue but who knew a fish stick could taste so good in a taco?  Really good quick dinner, we've already had them 4 times!

These were great, for what they are. I'd been wanting a fish burrito from Taco Del Mar but don't have ten bucks for a monster burrito. 

I used Sarah's Salsa from this site and exchanged sour cream for the tartar sauce because I thought it would flow better with the salsa. I added shredded cheese, too. Tasty and worked out great to iron out my craving. 

I think if I make this again, I'd use the
Gordon's fish fillets, to have more of a fish taste and lose the coating of the 
fish sticks.

I have to admit - I was a bit skeptical at first given that you're using fish sticks, but the taste was great and it really saved time! My husband loved these. I will be making these again next week. Thanks for the great recipe!

I never had fish tacos before. I am glad  I tried these. They are so good. I prefer them without the salsa. I used sourcream, lettuce, onions, and red cabbage. I also used gortons popcorn fish. Thank you for posting. I will make these again.

I am giving these four stars with the understanding that you know the only things in it with much flavor are the salsa and the tartar sauce, so the quality of those will determine your outcome.  I make my own of each and they are excellent :)  Make yours at your own risk.  I also added sour cream to the final tacos.  Yum.

I've been lying to my kids for the longest time saying "These are Chicken fingers not Fish sticks!" So with that being said, i tried this on my youngest and told her they were "Chicken Finger Soft Tacos" and She devoured them. Great idea Chris!

This was great.  I used the higher end breaded fish filets - more fish adn less breading.  We HATE cabbage so used chopped iceberg lettuce.  I didn't use tartar sauce either.  We mixed salsa and mayo mixture - it was fabulous!

So simple and so good. I used fish fillets instead of sticks and flour tortillas instead of corn. I also warmed the tortillas in the microwave instead of frying them. I wasn't sure my family would like them but they loved it.

I really wasn't expecting much, but I ended up loving these! What a great idea! Now I can have awesome, easy fish tacos when I make fish sticks for the kids! I really wish I had tried this sooner, because do you know how many fish sticks I've choked down?! I wasn't too sure about the salsa and tartar sauce--some reviewers didn't do it. However, I wanted to stick to the recipe this time. I liked it! It sounds weird, but the flavors really went together. I had a bag of coleslaw mix that I used instead of just red cabbage. Thank you for this recipe!

We love this for a simple, quick, easy meal! We have also made a cabbage slaw to go over the fish by mixing a small amount of sour cream, salsa, lime juice and salt and pepper to taste and mixing that with the cabbage. We ave also added tomatoes, onions and whatever toppings we would like that we have on hand.

It was so delicious....I used sour cream instead of tarter sauce!  I recommend others do the same!

I did make changes. Instead of cabbage I used lettuce, tarter sauce & mexican shredded cheese in the corn tortilla. I also microwaved the tortillas for 20 seconds.I made corn & brown rice as side dishes. It was delicious & I will definitely make it again & again.

Made this one last night, exactly to the recipe except I used flour tortillas.   Served with refried beans, chips and salsa.  I made sure they were good quality fish sticks.  Not bad for a very quick dinner.  you make this one for ease, not culinary delight.  Still, not bad.

These were so easy and good.  I agree with the other poster, you need flavorful tarter sauce and salsa.  I would also make sure to add some fresh avacados or guacamole.  Black beans and sour cream also help to make this a little more filling.
