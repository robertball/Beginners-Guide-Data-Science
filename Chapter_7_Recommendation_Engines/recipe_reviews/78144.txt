Tasty but Do not use fresh rice.  I was so excited to try this that I cooked the rice specially, then made the recipe while the rice was still hot and sticky.  The flavor was still pretty good, but the whole thing was sticky and gloppy. The texture would have been better had I actually used leftover cold rice.

This recipe has become a staple in our house. I just have one word of caution: the peas make all the difference! The first time I made it I used organic peas and the second time I used Walmart peas. It was like a completely different recipe.

Oh my goodness!  Super fast, tastes great and easy.  I didn't have any vinegar so I added a about 4 tablespoons of water to make the rice easier to coat and so the subsequent steam could revive the rice.  I had been pondering for a week what to do with that leftover rice. (I never throw out anything unless it's grown something else.)  That last little bit of chicken and rice was so much tastier than what I was thinking of and could have imagined.  Please try it.

Delicious! 4 stars as written, 5 with the following changes: replace veggie oil with sesame oil, add 1/2 tsp of powdered ginger, and I marinated the chicken for two days in a marinade of soy sauce, sesame oil, garlic, and ginger which gave it excellent flavor! I also added egg.

This recipe is dangerous...it was so good I ate until my stomach hurt! The only changes I made were to substitute white onion because that's what I had on hand, and used a french wine vinegar, again because that's what I had on hand.  Delicious!

On a shoestring budget, but this still impressed my girlfriend! Good way to stretch leftover rice and grilled chicken. Try it on your mate.

This recipe was easy and delicious.  I especially liked that brown rice was used instead of white. So much healthier.  My husband commented how much he enjoyed it several times during the meal. By the way, for the other reviewer that was concerned about the plate presentation, we are rating the taste of the food, not what it is served on.

I had leftover grilled chicken so I wasn't able to follow this recipe exactly but it was still really good and would have been as written. I did jazz it up a little after it was cooked and on our plates by adding some bean sprouts and cilantro.  This is a great standard recipe that could be changed up according to what you have on hand. I am definitely keeping this one!

Great, simple recipe. I did not have rice vinegar or red bell pepper. I finely minced a serrano pepper(great if you like a little bit of heat), and used a cup of frozen mixed veggies instead of just peas. I also tossed the chicken in a light flour, season salt and breadcrumb coating before sauteeing. Excellent!

We really enjoyed this quick dish! This is a great way to reimagine leftovers. I doubled the recipe, added 1 tablespoon of sesame oil and some finely chopped leftover carrots. My green onions were extremely strong, so I only used 1/2 the amount called for and added a little chopped sweet onion that was also leftover from another recipe. I like that this uses brown rice, and we'll definitely be making this again.

This was good...my bf liked it.  I found it to be a little too tangy/salty for my tastes.  Not sure if it was the rice vinegar or if I used too much soy sauce.  I also added some chicken broth for added moisture.

I was really excited to make this dish. It was a huge disappointment, however. I think it needed some type of sweetness to it. It really was not good.

I had already cooked, shredded chicken meat, and leftover brown rice, so this recipe was very fast and easy for me to make.  I think it took abtou 10 minutes to cook and the kids and I finished it all at dinner.  We all really liked it, and I liked that it was easy as well as delicious.  Thanks!

Quick and easy for week night dinner.  I used 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts cut into bite size pieces.  And, to prevent rice from turning into mush, make rice night before and add cold rice to step #3.   I also sprinkled completed dish with a little red pepper flakes to add a little kick.

Love this recipes, however I did not have just brown rice I had Uncle Bens 90 min rice and used that instead, I just heated it up and mixed it with the rest of the ingredients and then I add the soy sauce, I also did not use the peas or the rice vinegar and it was still  GREAT! Will make this many times over.

We all loved this! The only change I made wasn't a major change - I used frozen broccoli instead of peas because my husband hates peas - it was so tasty and filling! Will definitely make this again!!

Yum! I didn't have red pepper so used some carrots instead, otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  I didn't have leftover brown rice though, so I made some in my rice cooker.  When it was done I spread it out on a baking sheet lined with foil (for easy cleanup) and let it cool off and dry a little while I prepared the chicken.  Worked perfectly.  Oh, I also added some egg (scrambled) because we like that in our fried rice.

This is a good recipe.  I did not think there was enough flavor, will add some spices next time around.  I did not have any issues cooking the rice right before making the dish like others have.

This was "ok"... Flavor was good and my two kids ate it, but for me the texture was a little too soft... probably because I'm used to white rice instead of brown.  Will probably make again, but wasn't uber-impressed.

Great recipe.  The first time I made this, I left out the garlic just as a mistake and kept wondering what was missing.  Then I remembered oh yes it is GARLIC fried rice.  The second time around was sooo much better.  I did use white rice and added some more bell pepper just for taste.  It was absolutely fantastic thank you so much!

This is a great recipe for a quick and easy side dish.  Be sure to use leftover rice...fresh rice can make it too squishy.  I use brown rice with the recipe, and my husband loves it!

I can't wait to try this as I love fried rice! And using brown rice is great! As for the person who said they were a profession chef and didn't like the way it was plated, well, I have had many a meal fixed by professional chefs that were plated beautifully and tasted liked dog do! Then I have had meals that really didn't look like much, but let me tell you they were some of the best meals I have had!

Really, really good. I used frozen mixed vegetables instead of frozen peas and jasmine rice instead of brown. Everyone in my house was very happy with dinner!

Yes I did make this recipe using leftover chicken and rice but used more of the original as compared to the published one.  This recipe had been changed from the original submitted by JOYCE.  It went from 4 servings to 3.  Also ingredients were either drop in size or dropped from the list altogether. The spices were dropped altogether which is probably why a lot of reviewers found it was missing something.  In the original recipe it does say black pepper, paprika and parsley to taste .  I used half tsp. black pepper, 1 tsp. paprika and 1 tbsp. parsley.

My partner and 3 year old son loved this.  This recipe is almost identical to one I normally use, but this time I used sesame oil.  I think I was always adding too much soya sauce in the past, and partner complained it was too salty.  This seems like the right balance.  Will make again.

Wonderful side dish!  I made a couple changes but it turned out excellent.

I cooked teriyaki chicken separately and had this on the side.  Used white rice and substituted french cut green beans instead of peas.  Also added a couple drops of sesame oil.

This will be in the "go to" recipes!

We've been making this for about a year now, and even my 2-year-old loves it. We double the amount of everything, and use half sesame oil and half olive oil, as well as throwing in broccoli or whatever veggie we have on hand. We also cook the rice ahead of time. It works fine if you make the rice in the morning, then refrigerate until you make the recipe. Tasty and healthy.

This was great! I didn't really measure the ingredients, I just kind of eyeballed it, and everything came out perfect! I also substituted garlic powder and garlic salt in place of the garlic cloves. Overall, a REALLY GREAT recipe!

Okay I know I didn't follow the directions that well so I assume it's my fault that I'm not super impressed with this recipe. Also I'm really not much of a fried rice fan. I just happened to see this as the daily dish and thought hmmm sounds good and I have chicken in the fridge. With that said, this is what I did which I would say refrain from.... I didn't have any cooked rice on hand so I did make some (brown) from scratch. I then cooled the rice off before using. I did not have a bell pepper so I didn't use. Instead I used green onion, yellow onion and carrots. I chopped all. But I think the biggest mistake was using canned peas. For this step, please follow the actual recipe. I guarantee it will turn out much better than mine. Another mistake was using Tamari soy sauce rather than light. I think that tamari is even lighter than light soy. I also did add an egg, which I can't even taste. On a positive I added ginger as did some other reviewers and I think that it added a nice flavor.  Once again I'm not normally a fried rice eater, so I'll have to see what my husband says when he gets home.

First time eating brown rice. I used instant brown rice and tasted it plain and didn't really care for it, but in this fried rice it was delicious. Will make again, thanks.

This recipe was an excellent variation of fried rice using brown rice. I left out the rice wine vinegar as I already knew I don't care for it in fried rice, I also added a tablespoon of sesame oil in substitution for 1 T. of the vegetable oil (I used sunflower oil for health benefits)...the sesame oil makes this taste more like a restaurant-style fried rice. Easily customizable, I only took one star away because I feel it would have been very bland without the sesame oil.

Found this recipe yesterday after making a big batch of brown rice and wondering what to do with all the leftover rice.  I made it exactly as directed, but with the addition of chopped water chestnuts.  I agree with other reviewers that the peas really make it awesome.  It's really tasty.  Definitely a keeper -- I did add a little extra soy sauce to my bowl, but that's entirely based on my tastes.  Yummy!!!

This dish is fabulous and versitile too. Several combinations comes to mind.
 I did't have some of the ingredients on hand, so I had to be creative. I substituted brocoli for the peas, red onion for the green, red wine vinegar for the rice. I added 1 Tbs. of brown sugar and 1/2 tsp. of sesame hot chilli oil to the soy mixture. 
Mmmm Good. This was a real hit with my husband too.  Next time I will prepare as written I know it will be delicious too!

I thought this was a quick, easy, and healthy filling dinner. I substituted fresh green beans for the frozen peas and enjoyed having all fresh vegetables. Next time I will definitely experiment with adding more seasoning... otherwise it was great!

Deicious! I had some leftover basmati brown rice and this recipe was a great way to use it. The only change I made here was to use peanut oil instead of vegetable oil.

All I have to say is WOW!  I didn't want any chicken in the rice, but used all the other ingredients and also added one egg at the end.  The rice was amazing!  This is a keeper!

Very tasty, my only mistake was not planning ahead and having left over rice. I made fresh rice so it was a little sticky. Lots of flavor. Can't wait to make it again and try a couple variations with the veggies.

This is the best meal for me with young, very picky, kids! Oh, and my very picky husband! HA HA! 
I have had to make a few adjustments. I don't always have the foresight to make enough rice the day before. So, I have found that this is very good if I just make the chicken and veggies on top of my fresh rice. 
I sautee bell pepper, add diced chicken breast, cook a bit, add diced white onion, garlic and salt/season etc. I then add Chicken stock and my veggies (usually frozen carrots, corn, peas and green beans, because I seem to always have that) I add a lid and allow to simmer. 
Then I dish out my brown rice, spoon on the chicken/veggie mix. I sprinkle soy sauce to taste and I seriously, honestly, do not ever have enough!!! This is a meal that repeatedly I am asked for thirds on from a 4yr old, 7yr old, 9yr old and 43yr old. I feel like a champion after this one! I highly recommend it! Also, I have (as of tonight) learned to double my recipe ha ha!

Really good....added a few more veggies I had on hand....diced carrot, corn cut off the cob, and added an egg I scrambled when I cooked the rice in the tablespoon of oil. Also added a shot of soy at serving time.

Loved it. Of course, use thigh  not white meat since the health benefit is actual the opposite of common belief. Also, if you have time, follow the advice of the reviewer to marinate the chicken in soy sauce, rice vinegar, sesame oil, garlic, and ginger. Be sure to cook the chicken quickly. The small pieces cook in just minutes and are tender and juicy like a Chinese restaurant (using thigh meat).

Very good and easy.I used Trader Joe's Brown Rice Medley (cold leftover) and roasted pistachio oil. I was out of sesame oil as suggested by another reviewer and wanted to use something besides just veggie oil however I couldn't even taste the pistachio oil.  I also didn't have green onions and I know it would have been even better with them, but regardless it was really good.  Definitely a do-again! Thanks!

A good recipe. Needs egg. Also I added garlic and onion towards the end of cooking instead of beginning to keep it from over cooking and losing flavor. A sprinkle of sugar is recommended. Added corn too. Yummy.

I made it with leftover white rice and added scrambled egg to it.  I only used one garlic clove because I was afraid that it would be too garlicky for my kids.  Next time I will add a 2nd one.  I thought it needed more sauce but I might have used more than 3 cups of rice (I didn't measure it).   My family loved it.

Very easy and tasty! I did have to substitute apple cider vinegar for the rice vinegar but it turned out great. Also added in some scrambled egg. Very easy and straight forward recipe though. Paired with some miso soup and egg rolls it was a perfect meal!

I liked this recipe even though I altered it AND messed it up. First, I wanted to make 5 servings so that it would last me more throughout the week but instead of 5 cups of cooked rice I had 5 cups of UNCOOKED rice....I had so much rice at the end that, even though it was still delicious, some of the ingredients and flavoring got a little lost.

I'm rating this 4 stars because I feel like the recipe "as is" is very lacking in veggies. Besides increasing the number of servings to 5, I also altered the recipe by adding the following ingredients: red pepper flakes, powdered ginger, chopped asparagus, and sun dried tomatoes. Instead of frozen peas, next time I will use a bag of frozen mixed vegetables.

I liked it, but it would be better with corn, and carrots on top of all of the ingredients. Needs more flavor, next time I will use sesame oil and ginger. Also, my family likes to crumble up cooked bacon and mix it in fried rice, will add all of those things next time and I added clam juice.

I loved this and changed it a little. I like Jasmine rice, and used it instead. I also used some poached chicken I already had on hand. I also used seasoned rice vinegar and about 1/2 tsp of sesame oil. I also added a bit of dried ginger for added flavor. I loved it!! Will make again. Just about any meat or shrimp would work with this.

This dish was great!  I didn't fuss with the brown rice, I just put it in my rice cooker and put enough water (up to the knuckle of your index finger)in it and it came out fine.  I also used a portion of a mixture bag of frozen corn, peas and carrots in lieu of just the frozen peas.

I made this tonight.  Both my hubby and I didn't think it had much flavor. Not sure what I can do next time to add more flavor. Other than that, this was pretty good. I did add 2 cut up fried eggs to this dish...haven't seen fried rice without egg, so was surprised it wasn't in this recipe.

The recipe was amazing! I had to omit the onions and peppers because we are a picky family. My reasoning for 4 stars and not 5 is the calories. I have added and added each ingredient individually and get 343 cals per serving but recipe says 486 cals. What am i missing or is a mistake on the site? I am a calorie counter so this is VERY important to me!

I marinated the chicken breasts and grilled them separately from the rice and used a combination of brown and wild rice.  I used green pepper because I didn't have red.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. This was a very easy and enjoyable dish.  Thank you!

Can't wait to try this recipe.  Seems easy enough with  ingredients one usually has on hand.  As to the reviewer that will not try it due to plate presentation, my feeling is plate presentation is synonymous with "going away" hungry.  My pets will be quite happy to see what's on my plate since they will probably get to eat some of it too.

This was good as written.  Which is how I made it the first time.  I have made it 2 more times since then and now I make the following changes.  I use sesame oil instead of vegetable oil.  I added sliced fresh carrots, I cooked boiled the carrots for 3 minutes, added frozen peas to carrot water just before draining.  Drained them both immediately and then added them to the wok just before serving.   I served with a sesame tilapia and it was an awesome taste sensation.

Good but needed a little more spice. I used frozen chopped peppers and corn for the peas. I also used pre-cooked chicken and this literally was ready in 20 minutes.

It was very good. I added every thing but I didn't add the chicken. I added a fry eggs instead and fry chicken leg, thigh on the side.   I use whole grain rice not brown rice. Me like whole grain rice better :)

It was really good, other than our brown rice came out a little more gooey than the restaurants.We will also add a couple of eggs next time.

Made this recipe as written using chicken thighs instead of a whole chicken. Cooked about 45 minutes. Very tasty however I think next time I would cut the salt amount in half. The salt was slightly overpowering, thus the four stars. I did like the fact that it was quick and easy using pantry items.

this is delicious and easy! A little heavy on garlic but that's easily adjusted. I added some shredded carrot and used white rice (what I had). loved it. it was colorful and appetizing to look at, too.

After I started fixing it I forgot that it may have been a good idea to make sure I have all the ingredients. I ended up just using garlic salt, chicken, onion, and Cauliflower Rice, along with soy sauce. I didn’t think I’d be good with the Cauliflower rice but that gave it more flavor. It was really good. Overall I think it was amazing. Next time I just need to make sure I have all the ingredients.

Quick to make, however I found it a little bland. Jumped it up a notch by adding a couple tablespoons of fish sauce and a splash of hot chili sauce. Excellent.

I used a peas and carrot mix instead of just peas. This is my second time making it but this time just for one. This time I used white onion cause had no green, and leftover roasted pulled chicken. Cooked rice from raw both times specially for the recipe.

We liked it fine but I would like it a little saucier.
Changes:
I did add a couple of eggs. Next time I will add even more egg.
I used bacon grease instead of vegetable oil. (I use bacon grease for most things). Next time may try coconut oil.
Next time we make this I may try adding a little bit of chicken broth as well.
Overall the meal was good and well liked.

just got back from two days of non-stop meetings. Wanted a quick meal that was satisfying. This is so good. I even had the leftover rice - just waiting for this recipe. Used a bag of frozen mixed veggies and half veggie oil and half sesame oil. Love this. Even my 92 year old mom - who, by the way will not eat "Chinese" food, loved it. Made so much food, lunch will be a snap for several days next week. Thanks for a great, easy, and fabulous tasting recipe. I will use this often.

I love this recipe. It helped me find a creative way to feed my husband brown rice without any complaints. We like to double the recipe for meal prep for the week but with a couple tweaks. I triple the meat because it’s being used as a main dish (not a side) and I add 1 tbsp sesame oil (partially because I am not using nonstick pans and need more oil for this recipe and partially because it adds so much flavor). I also marinate the meat beforehand in teriyaki sauce. And I tend to use more soy sauce because we prefer a darker rice. Overall this recipe lends itself very well to personalization. The photo I submitted shows it with a double batch with onion in place of scallions & triple meat (3 lbs total, 1 each of chicken, shrimp and steak). My only complaint about it as written is the small amount of oil. My first attempt at this had me reaching back for more oil in the middle of cooking because I don’t use nonstick cookware.

I made this as a side dish, leaving out the chicken, in an effort to get my husband to eat brown rice. He loved it! I make a big batch of brown rice and then freeze into serving sizes and microwave for 30 seconds before adding to the other ingredients.

Very easy to make and quick. Perfect meal when you don’t really want to cook. I added a scrambled egg (cooked on the side and then added) and some sea salt and pepper for flavor. I also added red pepper for spice. Do not add more than the recipe calls for oil because it’s more than enough. I used ready made frozen brown rice from the frozen food aisle at Trader Joe’s and 4 cups instead of three. My son loved it. I don’t think I’ll be ordering fried rice any time soon for take out.

Kids & husband loved it.  I added pork, shrimp, quinoa, and carrots.  Was out of rice wine vinegar, so used cider vinegar.  I think I’ll add a few more veggies next time; bok Choyi & water chestnuts.  Will be making it again!!

This rendition of fried brown rice had a sour flavor. I think it was the vinegar.  The red pepper added a floral flavor and was not as mellow as carrot that is most fried rice recipes.   I will DEFINITELY  try this again using carrots and NO VINEGAR!

I liked this recipe a lot.. all I had was turkey tips so I marinated them in soy sauce, garlic and dried ginger..added a lot more veggies to it. Will absolutely make this again.. light, healthy and easy to make.

Very tasty! Very easy! Very quick! This has become one of my family's favorites. I use toasted sesame oil to heat the rice which adds a nice flavor and 10 oz. bags of frozen organic rice, and whatever veggies I have on hand. It's never quite exactly the same, but it is always very good!

Soooo simple to make, which is necessary with a toddler and infant. I added yellow peppers and egg whites to the recipe because I had them in my fridge. It's delicious....even if my toddler refuses to try it ??.

didn't have restaurant fried rice taste. Just tasted like soy sauce. May be better with a fried rice spice packet, but the sunbird brand has too many chemicals. Tried one from sprouts, gave the dish an odd flavor

I added more vegetables , it was not good at all. I thru it out, it had a very sorrow taste. I was really 
looking forward to eating it.  So very disappointed. A big waste of good ingredients. I really like fried rice, but not this one.

This was very good! I even used freshly cooked rice since I rarely have leftover rice. I just put the rice in last after the chicken and veggies were cooked and mixed with the soy sauce and vinegar.

Made the fried rice for my wife and myself (cut ingredients in half).  Used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. Had a small portion left over. Ate for lunch the next day; excellent reheated Next time will add an egg and not  halve the ingredients

Very good - I did add carrots as well, and a tad bit extra soy sauce. The whole family ate it all up. Two thumbs up!

I'm very excited that I found this recipe! I made some changes: omitted red pepper and fresh garlic (I didn't have any) and used garlic powder, carrots, and scrambled up some eggs in there...I doubled the rice and the chicken and it's great!

Family liked it, I added some ginger and more soy sauce than was called for.  I loved how simple the recipe is to make.
