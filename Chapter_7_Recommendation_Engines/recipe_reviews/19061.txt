What a great shortbread crust.  I use this on bars now too.  It's my 'secret ingredient'!  Everyone comments on how delicious squares made with this crust are.(I've even used it on recipes from friends and their comments are..."Mine never tasted this good!"

This is THE BEST crust to go with pecan pie! It is very easy to make & my inlaws insist that i bring it for the holidays- I always bring home an empty plate. I wouldn't change a thing!

Fabulouse pie crust!  I used it for a chocolate cream pie.  It received rave reviews from my family and was gone in no time!  Thanks for sharing!

Made this a couple of times now, but no more. It is easy, but has way to much marg, & can't taste the cinnamon. The type of filling for the pie crust is very limited so with all things considered that is why I gave it a 2 star rating. I think using it with a pecan pie filling might be the only things you could use.

Love this recipe w/ pumpkin pie.  I don't prebake it though--just pour in the pumpkin mixture and bake.  I also substituted a gluten free flour, and it worked just great.  Thanks so much!

This was fantastic with pecan pie! Buttery and crumbly and delicious, it was like eating pecan shortbread cookies. I doubled the cinnamon for a bit more zazz :)

This is so easy!  I used Blue Bonnett and very finely chopped pecans.  I baked both the Pecan Pie IV and Lorrie Sterling's Sweet Potato Pecan Pie using this and it was wonderful!

This crust was awesome and a breeze to make.  I wish I could say the same for the pecan pie I put in it but the person I made it for liked it.  I will definitely be making this crust again and experimenting with the fillings.

I made this crust for my pecan pie this Thanksgiving. Everyone who tried it noticed the difference and loved it. I will definitely use this crust for other pies as well. Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!!!

I just made this crust with my first pecan pie, it was super easy and taste great.  My husband said it was the best pie crust he ever had with a pie.

So much more than a simple pie crust. Apart from being delicious on its own - it makes a nice cookie - it makes even a plain filling stand out. I made a butterscotch and banana cream, but am sure chocolate would be a welcome compliment. I used a gluten free flour mix and real butter instead of margarine. If using gf flour, you might want to add an egg. Making mini-tarts, I allowed the crust to sit overnight but they were still fragile, so I think we gluten freebies, will need some binding help. What a nice, versatile recipe. Thank you!

This is a great recipe. I used cold butter instead of margarine, and mixed it all together in my food processor.  It made too much for my pecan pie, but tasted amazing!!!
