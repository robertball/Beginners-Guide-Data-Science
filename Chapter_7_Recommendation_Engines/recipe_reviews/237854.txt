Sent my hubby to the store with a grocery list, and he came home with avocados instead of mangos...hmmm?  I know we’re in the minority, but we’re not huge fans of avocados, although we don’t totally dislike them either.  We enjoy a little guacamole every now and then, and this recipe is a good one.  I did add a bit more lime juice and some chopped cilantro, personal taste preference.  We enjoyed the creaminess and fresh flavor of this guacamole and definitely how easy it came together.

OUTSTANDING! I had huge end of summer roma tomatoes so I used 1 1/2 and could have gotten away with one given the size of my avocadoes. I will certainly make this again!!

I liked this very much. I made it just as written. Next time I will reduce the amount of onions, which I thought was too much...it overpowers it if the onions are strong.

Will definitely make it again!
Used a total of 20 avocados, split the batch & added finely chopped jalapeño to 1/2. There was none left of either the mild or spicy.
I used ‘sweet onions’  and it was perfect!!

04-10-16 ~ We enjoy guacamole and this was a good one. I made as written using 'as needed' salt rather than 1/2 teaspoon. It paired nicely with soft shelled tacos and refried beans.

Very good, easy and basic. I added 1/2 minced cucumber and about 1/2 cup minced raw broccoli. I also added a little sea salt and cayenne pepper, along with 1 drop of therapeutic grade cilantro essential oil.

Kinda did my own amounts of the ingredients!! Also added pepper....and I didn't have any fresh garlic, however I had minced fresh in the jar, and added a little powdered garlic also.....I'm 34 and this was my first time I've ever did my very own fresh guacamole, I always thought it was easier getting the packets of seasonings and mixing it with the avocados.....This was easy, and so much healthier and fresh!!!! Thank you

I made a half recipe since I live alone. Loved it and so simple. Then added some Mango and a dash or two of chipotle chile pepper. Gave it a slightly smokey taste with a kick.  For my taste I prefered to original recipe but would make both if I were having company.

Awesome! I'm not very good at anything in the kitchen, but once I finished making this I couldn't stop eating it!

Made just as written in recipe.  The onion was a little overpowering.  I would try again, but with much less onion.

Tried this out for my husband's birthday party and I had people coming up to me say "I don't like Guacamole, but this is good"!

Have you tried Avocados from Mexico?  Well, YUM!  I made this guacamole to put on top of Patty Cakes' Spicy Alfredo Chicken Bacon Taquitos from this site.  Excellent recipe!  Thanks so much, Paula!

Simple and easy, this recipe made a delicious guacamole.  I used a little less garlic (personal preference) and added some cilantro because I had a ton of it growing in the garden.  Thanks for sharing!

Perfect, just perfect.  I minced the garlic and onion together very small.  Mixed everything together and added one finely diced green onion as well.  Thanks Paula!
