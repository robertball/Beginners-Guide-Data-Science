This is definitely a keeper! there is only two of us so i scaled back the recipe to suit the one can of mixed beans (kidney, chick peas and cannellini beans) i had. the dressing is to die for. i didn't have any honey mustard, so i mixed in a little honey to my bold and spicy mustard. i also used green onions cause thats what i had. this is a great tasting bean salad with the addition of the feta, which i was kinda leary of. but all for nought:)

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I made it with fresh tomato, as tomatoes with green chili peppers are pretty much impossible to find in Canada.  I only had a scan half cup of feta, and I'm sure it would be greatly improved with extra feta.  I also used about 1 tbsp of Greek seasoning and no garlic powder, as there was garlic already in my Greek seasoning.  I chopped my red onion very finely, but I think next time I will grate it, as suggested.  I also used 1 tbsp of mustard and 1 tbsp of honey in place of the honey mustard and added the juice from 1/2 a lemon to brighten up the flavors.  I let it sit overnight in the fridge and the flavors were really nice the next day.
The recipe makes A LOT.  A great simple recipe to take to a party, or for a yummy lunch on a hot day!

I used only 1/4 cup of olive oil because I misread the recipe, but we really liked this one and will make it again.

Not bad at all. I brought it to a scouts picnic and every last bite was gone. Would make again and play around with additions.

I made this for a staff luncheon. The only change I made from original recipe was the use of 3 cans of the 6 bean mix instead individual cans of beans.
It recieved mixed review, although some had 4 helpings!
I like that it was different than what you expect from a bean salad. It kept well over 6 hours of luncheon, so that is a plus

I made a smaller quantity with one can of kidney beans. I also added a stock of celery and some walnuts. I was looking for a salad with feta with some hefty to it and this fits the bill. Nice lunch dish.

I followed the recipe pretty close:I had no white beans, so I used chickpeas, and I having no canned Rotel-type tomatoes, I used fresh. The fresh tomato was really quite nice but still, overall, the salad seemed lacking in flavour, even after it sat for 3 hrs.  So I added a Tbsp of granulated sugar, 2 TBSP of white vinegar, increased the feta to 1c (we really like it), and added an extra Tbsp Greek seasoning - that brought the salad to life.  I'll make it again with these amendments.  The recipe makes a lot. I'd say the servings should say at least 12, not 8.
