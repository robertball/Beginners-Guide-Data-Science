Our 9 yr. old  made these for dinner and they were awesome! She used ground turkey in place of the chicken. The nuggets were reminiscent of sausage. We will request these again!

We love these chicken nuggets! I can’t remember how many times I’ve made them. I reduced the salt to 1/2 -3/4 tsp.  in the meat mixture but kept the full teaspoon in the coating. We never get tired of them.

I’ve made these twice now because we loved them so much. They are filling and delicious. I added some sriracha to the meat to make the nuggets spicy and I’ll definitely be making them again soon!
