It really is easier to just not change the water again, but you might get a slightly less appealing looking broth.  The other thing is that these are not "refried beans", so if that's what you are looking for you wont get with this recipe.  One suggestion though (from a Mexican), follow these directions as they are.  Once you have your cooked beans, take a skillet and pour some oil (maybe about 1/4 cup) heat the oil and take beans from the pot (drain the liquid first) and fry them in the oil.  Mash them up while they are frying.  You could also stir in some milk for a creamier texture.

The first time out I made them as per the recipe.  They were ok.  Second time, I added some chopped onions, diced tomatoes cilantro and salt and pepper to taste.  Much better...

I enjoyed it the first time, doing exactly what the recipe called for, but I loved it the second time when I added onions, jalapeno, garlic, diced tomatoes, cummin, cilantro, chili powder, and a copious amount of sea salt. It's a great recipe for starting out and finding what else you might want to add. Don't forget to soak your beans!

My family loves this dish! My husband is Hispanic and he loves beans served this way. Even my mom, in the South, thinks it's wonderful. They're easy to serve as refried beans as well. Just heat oil in a pan, add beans and mash with a wooden spoon as they cook. Ready in about five minutes!

Great start to the guaracho beans like at the Mexican Restaurant and I've tried to duplicate at home.  Add onions to the first cooking, some cumin,  and some garlic.  At the last few minutes , add fresh cilantro.  Delicious side dish without all the added fat to refry them.

They're beans!  They are supposed to be somewhat bland - they are a side dish to compliment the other items in your meal.  This is not a soup recipe.  The only thing I change is when adding the water the second time - add one whole beer.  Any beer, but a medium ale is really good.  Not all beans taste good cooked with beer, but I think it really makes pinto's great.  Another trick, you can try covering and cooking them in a 350 degree oven instead of the stove top.  For some reason, the all around heat makes the texture better than the stove top.

I thought these were very bland. I couldn't taste the flavor of the peppers at all and they needed A LOT of salt. I also thought there was too much water. It diluted the flavor.

the reason you drain the first water is so your beans won't give you GAS!!!

This needs a few more ingredients (salt/pepper, for instance) to make this a decent dish. My folks were from Texas. We had beans almost every day, including pinto beans. Mom cooked very plainly: pinto beans, salt and pepper, bacon or ham hocks or a ham bone. That was pretty much it for her bean recipe. I prefer something with a bit more ingredients. If you don't like the heat from the hot peppers, cut them first, and remove the seeds. Alot of heat are in those seeds. The reason you let the beans sit after the first cooking of an hour is so they will get soft. Oh, if you add salt, add it just before the beans are done. Salt will toughen the beans. Most people prefer letting the beans soak overnight and then change the water. That takes the "toot" out of the beans.

I added a finely diced onion as well.  If you want more heat, split open the peppers after it's cooked and stir it around a bit to distribute the heat.

This is a very good basic recipe for pinto beans. Like other reviews suggested I also had to add a bit more flavor, that's why I only gave it 4 stars. I added 1 tsp salt, 1 tbsp of powdered chicken broth and 1/2 chopped onion. I only had jalapenos on hand so I used 2 of those instead. I also didn't change the water. I like a more concentrated bean broth. I let it simmer for a total of 2 1/2 hours and geez louiz was it good. My husband loved it! I might cut the bacon back a little next time, but I won't tell him that. :) Thanx for the recipe.

I didn't like this much at all. My husband thought they were ok but they taste more like ham hock & beans that Mexican beans. 
I put in bacon, onion, garlic, tomatoes and chopped jalapeno along with the serano peppers. It wasn't terribly flavorful and not remotely spicy, even with all of that.  
Also I don't think the beans should cook so long, mine began to fall apart. I wonder if they lost some of their flavor from cooking so long.

This is a pretty good soup recipe. It's very similar to the way my mom makes them. But faster with the "quick soak" method.

This is simular to the way my mom made them, but we do it in a pressure cooker so don't have to cook so long. Sort beans, bring to a boil with about 1 inch of water. Let set 1 hour. Put in pressure cooker with any other ingredents like onion, bacon, sausage, hamburger, pepper, spices. Put on lid tight. Bring pressure up and let cook one half hour then let pressure come down on it's own.(about another half an hour) Beans should be done. Good with cornbread, rice or fried potatoes.

Pretty good - I cook them uncovered for the last 1 1/2 to thicken - and I use a couple of Goya Ham packets to punch up the smoky, ham flavor... they're ALMOST like our favorite Mexican restaurant here in Central Jersey...

Last time I put in 5 of the small Chinese chili's and this was ok, next time I'd do the same.  I also used a piece of stomach cut from the wet market. I'm going to get a bigger piece for the same purpose this time.

Like many slow-simmered recipes, this one is better the second day. The liquid is thicker, and the flavors are blended, so the bacon flavor is more subtle. If you're not familiar with serrano peppers, do note that they're quite a bit hotter than jalapeños, and provide quite a kick when they get soft enough to break open in the pot of beans. I've found that one, simmered whole and then broken with a spoon and stirred around provides a moderate amount of heat, which  is always easier to add than subtract, of course. 

This is a good base recipe that lends itself to a lot of experimentation and customization: I recommend heating a bowl of it, melting a cheese single and stirring in some chunky salsa for a great bean dip.

I had to give it 5 stars because this is how I have seen it done here in Texas my whole life and they taste like they should. Pinto Beans. We always added hot chow chow, or some sliced jalepenos, or what have you to our own bowls and salt and pepper as you want. Just reminds me of lazy Sundays. Oh, and make a big skillet of HomeSteaders corn bread found on the site.

The only thing I did different was cut a poblano pepper in half and placed on top. Our grocery store did not have serrano peppers but I did shop one day before Cinco de Mayo. We actually really liked this dish!

This recipe was good but very bland. I added some chopped onion and salt, which made it a lot better.

I'm trying to figure out if the simmering for one hour is a misprint or if you really do it twice as the directions state???  I can't find any other "refried bean" recipe out there and this is as close as I can find, but I don't want to mess it up, did you all do the simmering twice?

The recipe is okay. You have to add alot of salt to get the correct flavoring. As just regular beans I would give it a 3. But, if you make refried beans mixed with sour cream in it. I would make it a 5. My daughter would only give it a 3 both ways and she loves homemade beans. She said it was to bacony.
