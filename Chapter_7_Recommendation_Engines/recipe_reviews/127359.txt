This recipe is the BOMB! I have been making it for a few years now. It bakes perfectly everytime. I do prefer to use chocolate chips over chopping up the chocolate for the inside and the glaze.  I like that you can "lighten" it up with using reduced fat oreo's and light cream cheese, and dark chocolate for the filling and top. Also us 2 egg whites and 1 whole egg instead of the 3 whole eggs.

This cheesecake was the first one that I have ever made.  It was easy and it was so good.  If you like chocolate, you will LOVE this cheesecake!

I am a chocolate lover/dessert lover and this was way too rich for me.  I baked it 50 minutes.  When I cut it 6 hours later the center and most of the edges were "soupy."  I recommend substituting the chocolate chunks for chocolate chips.  I would still use the bakers chocolate for the glaze on top though.  I doubt I'll make again.

I have been making this for years, and it is the birthday cake of choice for several members of my family.  Like the other reviewer, I use semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of the baker's chocolate now, and it is fantastic.  I discovered via this recipe that cheesecake does not need vanilla!
