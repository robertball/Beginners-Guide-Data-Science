I used a store bought graham cracker pie crust (9 inch) and I had some filling left over. I actually made the pudding first and used 1 1/2 cup heavy cream and 1 1/2 cup milk and it make it thick and rich more like a thin custard. It also made the pie hold up much better. I let the pudding set up in the fridge while I made the rest of the pie. I piped on the rest of the whipped cream and placed strawberries on for decoration. It was beautiful, and tasted wonderful!

Yummy!  My daughter and I made this for our 4th of July Dessert.  Here are the changes we made: We used the premade graham cracker crust, added 1 1/2 cups heavy cream & 2 cups whole milk to the pudding and chilled. We made fresh homemade whipping cream in place of the whipped topping.  We did not add the sugar to the cream cheese mixture because we sweetened the whipping cream.  We also added fresh Raspberries intead of Strawberries and decorated it with both Blueberries and Raspberries for the Holiday.  Easy to make!

This is a great recipe, very light and sweet. It is great way to feature fresh strawberries. I cut the filling ingredients in half, and used a pre-made graham cracker crust. It turned out really well, very creamy, not too heavy. A wonderful summer dessert.

I love this recipe and like many others I ALWAYS get requests for the recipe. This recipe is also good w/many different types of Berries...black berries, rasberries, blueberries, boysenberries...I even tried it w/fresh peaches...I recommend that you stick w/the berries, though...

Used a premade graham cracker crust and strawberry cool whip.  Made for dessert on Football Sunday, I think everybody had at least 2 pieces.  Only used one box of pudding since I was put it in graham cracker pie crust, everything else I did the same.

I luv this so much!!!  It has a great mix of flavors!  I bake this all the time for partys and there are never any left overs.  People are always asking me to bake it for them.  I use 2 1/2 cups of graham crackers instead of 1 1/2.  I you want the graham crackers to be soft and melt in your mouth lather them butter and push all the graham crackers together (My preference).  If you like a crunchy harder texture for graham cracker put less butter then more and crack them in big nickel sized chunks (parents preference).  I Used banana pudding and it made it so extremely good.  Low fat cream cheese is not to bad either.  Its A MUST TRY!!

I prepared this recipe for a cook out and it was great. Very easy to fix.  But next time I think I will use less sugar because it was extremely sweet.

My husband and I really liked this recipe.  It would be great for a potluck or party.  Be sure to eat it in 2 days or less...any longer and it is just too soggy and runny.

Made this dessert for easter and my hubby and guests enjoyed it very much.  Fairly easy to make, yet light and refreshing with the layers of strawberry, cream cheese, pudding and graham crust.  I did layer the cream cheese mixture with the strawberries by spreading 1/2 the cream cheese, then 1/2 the strawberries, the other 1/2 cream cheese, then remaining strawberries.  Pudding went on top.

This turned out really good! I didn't add sugar to the crust since it seemed like there was enough sugar in it already.  I also added frozen blueberries, fresh sliced bananas, and used frozen strawberries. I would recommend using fresh fruit because the frozen fruit made it a little watery.  Other than that this was great!

I had such rave reviews about this.  Friends even tried remaking it themselves the very next day, because they finished off the pan I brought!This is so delicious and I made w/light butter, 1% milk, sugar free pudding mix, Splenda, light cool whip. Very summery dessert!

This was good - I used cheesecake pudding. I did put it in the freezer for about an hour before serving, easier to cut and the presentation was better.

Tastes absolutely delicious! Not sure if it had an odd error since I'd used low fat cream cheese & whipped topping, but once you've cut it up into slices (and stored for later), the entire layer of pudding & topping spreads out and you've just got to re-shape it all into 'pie like creation'... We had it 3 times among 3 people, knowing this sad fact, but still fully enjoyed it 101%, though!

Everyone enjoyed this - but the presentation left a lot to be desired. I would use less milk for the pudding, as it was a sloppy mess when taken out of the pan. I did double the berries too, and it was the perfect amount of berries. I think I will try it w/o the pudding and just whipped cream next time.

I made this for Easter... I gave it three stars because my family claimed it was good - but I thought it was way too rich.  Also, it's less of a "pie" and more like a "blob" of different ingredients...just make strawberry shortcake, it's a better bet.

Wonderful recipe, served it a BBQ and people loved it.  Made a few changes, left out the sugar in the crust and used almond shortbread cookies instead of graham cracker crumbs.  Also suggest doubling the amount of berries.  Light, cool, and tasty for a hot summer day!

This was a tasty treat.  It was a little too mushy for me.  (I have a thing with soggy texture)  I was surprised about the amount of work it took, like lots of dishes,so I probably won't make again.  Not the best dessert...will try something else next time.

While this dessert tasted good, it was very messy and didn't impress my family too much when I made it for a birthday party.  To help with the "mess factor", I'm going to try freezing the pie overnight and then letting it thaw for an hour or two before serving so it's more firm.  I also mixed cool whip with the pudding mix (and cut back on the milk), then added a thin layer of cool whip on the top of the pie with strawberry slices for decoration.

I made this recipe tonight and it was excellent. I did take the advice from the other reviews. Instead of using pudding and milk I took one small box instant pudding and one pint of heavy whipping cream. Makes a wonderful mousse which I use to fill my cakes. I will definetly make this one again. Thank you!

This is a terrific dessert! I use frozen strawberries instead of fresh and next time I may do a layer of plain whipped topping instead of pudding. Overall, it's a great dessert to please everyone.

I absolutely love this pie! I have made this about 7 or 8 times now. Sometimes I'll do the recipe as is with the vanilla pudding and the strawberries. Other times I'll do a banana pudding and top with bananas. No matter how I do it, it always turns out great. The graham cracker crumbs just pull it all together with the perfect texture, and they just melt in your mouth. So delicious and so creamy.

This is great!  I did use Oreo pie crust and took the advise of others to use heavy cream & milk for the pudding. I also mixed in the strawberry pieces into the cream cheese mixture.  Looks much better as a presentation. It was way too much filling for one 9 in.  pie crust. I poured the fillings into a pie dish and sprinkled crushed graham crackers on the top. Everyone loved it. I think next time I'll try to mix the pudding and cream cheese filling together and see how it comes out. Overall, my family loved it. Great for an abundance of strawberries!

Great recipe.  Enjoyed by everyone. Preferred by friends and family over my strawberry pretzel dessert--which always gets rave reviews.  I did use lite cool whip, light cream cheese and used 1 1/2 cups each heavy whipping cream and equal amount of milk.  I also used pre-made graham cracker crust.

My family loved this pie.  So easy to make.  I did not put the whipped cream on top of the pudding and I did freeze it a little.  Wonderful and easy

It was amazing. I served the vanilla pudding on the side because I didn't have enough room in the pie plate and I didn't want to cover up the beautiful stawberries. I loved it both ways! My dad who is very picky about his desserts said that it was his favorite dessert in the history of desserts. That is quite the compliment.  I used reduced fat ingredients and it was still delicious! Thank you for the recipe.

Strawberries are some of my favorites so naturally I make a lot of strawberry desserts. This one was a hit with my guests - could use even more strawberries and some other fruits as well - maybe blueberries.  I also used French vanilla pudding instead of vanilla.

This became an instant family favorite!  So much potential to experiment with other berries, and decoration.  Crunchy bottom, fluffy and lightly sour layer, tart and fruty, and a mild top layer to even out the whole thing.  Thanks Carol, We Love It!
