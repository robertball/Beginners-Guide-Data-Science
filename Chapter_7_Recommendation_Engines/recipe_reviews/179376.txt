This was so awesome and easy. For a cold day what a feel good dinner. I substituted a large can of cooked chicken instead of making a chicken breast seperate and cooked it in a glass pyrex bowl. It was perfect. I used cream of mushroom soup to but you can use whatever soup you like it is that easy!! This is a make again over and over!

I used this recipe for my leftover turkey. I didn't have any frozen mixed vegies so used 1 can niblets corn & 1 can peas. I looked on the bisquick website and saw that some used 2 cans of soup so that's what I used 2 cream of chicken - added 1/2 can milk few shakes each garlic powder and onion powder. To the topping I added a shake of garlic and about 1/2 t dried italian herbs to impart some more flavor. I found that it was ok but DH loved it and said I should make again. I really feel it would have been better with the mixed veggies. Perhaps subbing 1 can for cream of potato would also be good(?)

Yes this is an "impossibly" easy recipe and I did follow the recipe as written but we felt the flavor was rather blah. I ended up serving a bit of cranberry sauce to give it a bit of help. Should I use this recipe again I'll be adding some onions celery etc. to punch up the taste.

I use poultry seasoning Montreal Chicken seasoning Onion powder little Adobo and. Smidge of Sazon on chicken while cooking it in frying pan with cooking spray. We also use cream of chicken and cream of potatoe soup fresh celery and fresh baby carrots ( nuke them till soft before putting in oven ) sometimes we add a nuked potato with skin on ( washed ) or green beans we also love Bisquick so we double it to 2 cups mix 1 cup milk and 1 egg place into a large casserole dish and voila! Bon appetite!

We LOVED this. Perfect for those days when you come home from work hungry and don't know what to do. Easy and everything can be stored for those emergency moments. I didn't have Bisquick but I had a packet of Bisquick instant muffin mix where you just add water. I made that and plopped it on top and it came out great. I already purchased instant mix canned chicken soup and frozen veggies for my next hunger emergency. Thanks.

My husband can't get enough of this recipe! He's not a "casserole" type guy. I made it for me and the kids for years but he would turn his nose up. Finally he tried it. LOVES IT! The filling can be very bland so I sprinkle poultry seasoning pepper and Mrs. Dash Chicken seasoning into the veggie mix. Also I add cheddar cheese and melted butter to the bisquick mix. Also I use rotisserie chicken bought from the deli 1 large can of cream of chicken soup. He asked me to make it again! True winner!

I have made this recipe for many years. It is really delicious just as the recipe is written... However I do add Bell's Seasoning (to taste)...just a personal preference.

It was very bland and frozen vegies just didn't help. I would recomend fresh vegies or even canned and season the filling a bit.

Great dinner experience! I doubled the recipe for two pie plates. Sauteed chicken pieces in olive oil with onion powder. Used 1 can cream of chicken and 1 can cream of mushroom. Seasoned soup mixture with Tony's. Baked as directed 2 pie plates for 55 minutes. Golden brown perfect texture! I did add salt at the table though.

I used can chicken warmed it on the stove with the vegetables I also added some diced onions with it to give it an extra kick. I used normal frozen vegetables I added the cream of chicken soup and milk cooked until warm or a good consistency. I also added some seasonings to the mixture. Lemon pepper garlic pepper a dash of salt or whatever your preference. I added the mixture to the pan. I also added about 1/4 of cup or a hand full of cheddar cheese to the bisquick mixture poured it on top of the chicken mixture. It was amazing I started to do this to add a little more calcium in my diet when I was pregnant. now I just do it out of habit.

I used fresh baby carrots ( nuked in microwave) along with fresh celery ( nuked) Also 2 cans of soup one is cream of potato and other can be cream of mushroom or cream of chicken I also put in milk into one empty can to get remainder of soup out anyway I brown chicken breasts in cooking spray with a splash of EVOO seasoned with Adobo ( Spanish seasoning) additional garlic powder or chopped some Italian seasoning dash paprika onion powder some poultry seasoning. Cook chicken thoroughly searing it gives it nice flavor make sure cut up baby carrots in smaller chunks and celery too both of them HAVE TO BE COOKED BEFORE putting into the oven as 30 min is NOT enough time for veggies to cook we don't generally use frozen mixed veggies I buy fresh you could put in some good peas too and if you like a potato that's been nuked as well we try to avoid a lot of carbs so potatoes are a treat lol sorry I don't measure I've been cooking since I was around 8 years old learned from my mom I always use spices and avoid using salt

This is a recipe my mother in-law introduced me to and it is a family go to on busy weeknights! My husband always has a smile on his face when I tell him it's what's on the menu and even the pickiest toddler in my family will eat it up. I use slow cooked chicken and frozen peas and carrots.

Another rocking recipe! I had mild variations. Used one can Cream of Chicken and one can Cream of Potato soup. Added 1/2 can of milk. Cut up 2 stalks of celery and microwaved for 3 minutes with some baby carrots a little salt and pepper. Cut up baby carrots and added into mix with the soup milk one cup frozen mixed veggies 10 oz can of cooked chicken dashes of onion powder garlic powder and Italian seasoning. Topped with Bisquick mixture and baked. So easy so tasty and a make again meal. Served with stewed tomatoes and garlic bread.

Impossibly easy but not impossibly good. With some substitutions/additions such as added spices (garlic oregano...) and maybe different soup (mushroom cheddar broccoli) it might be better but there's better and equally easy recipes for chicken pot pie on this site.

It is easy but the crust does not add any taste. I stirred in 1/4 teaspoon of sage and thyme when mixing the bisquick crust. Then poured melted butter and garlic salt over the crust when done. Let it sit for a few minutes while the butter soaks in. Yummy AND easy.

I always use 2 cans of soup. either cream of chicken or mushroom. A can of vegall or two chicken bouillon onion powder. we like ours soupy so there's plenty of liquid for the biscuits to absorb so i eyeball milk into it. if you don't have bisquick you can use the EZ Drop biscuits on this site. This is definitely one of the hubby's favorites

I use this recipe as the starting point. I usually use a bit more chicken and saute onions and carrots and add frozen peas instead of using the frozen mixed vegetables. I also add a bit of thyme and/or poultry seasoning to the chicken mixture and the topping. A nice comfort food dinner.

It s pretty meh. No flavor whatsoever in the bisquick topping. The rest of it was ok because I sautéed carrots celery onions potatoes and added peas to the soup mix. If you make this I d add some flavor to the bisquick - cheese onion powder salt and pepper or something. I d probably also add less milk and drop it on top like dumplings.

So incredibly easy and tasty! If you have leftovers I d recommend storing in foil and reheating in the oven to keep the crust crisp.

I added poultry seasoning thyme and sage and thickened the sauce with some chicken broth and cornstarch in addition to the mushroom soup. I made it for 8 servings but next time I'll make the crust thicker.

This is so easy to do.  The only change I make is that I use an extra can of the condensed chicken soup because my family loves that part.  I also up the chicken and veggies just a bit more to make up for the extra cream.

It was rather bland and not enough gravy. Next time I will add some milk to the canned soup and season with more salt and pepper. Was thinking possibly adding a touch of poultry seasoning as well.

Very dry and I can t imagine what it would taste like with no seasoning as the recipe states. I used chicken tenderloins seasoned with herbs de Provence and salt which lent the only flavor this dish possessed. Not worth making again.

This is so delicious and so easy. Homey comfort food that takes no time at all to make. I like to add a pinch of thyme and because I love corn and peas a little extra. I've made chicken pot pie from scratch but almost why bother because this is so good.

This was so easy and tasted great. I added a little seasoned salt to the filling and used ready-made pie crust instead of the Bisquick topping because what I was going for was a true chicken pot pie without all the fuss worked out perfectly. I also used rotisserie chicken. So good!

Enjoyed this recipe using some info from France and other reviewers. Doubling the Bisquick was a good idea! I thawed frozen green beans and peas and chopped carrots potatoes onion and celery. Precooked the potato chunks by boiling them for about 5-7 minutes until almost done. Sauteed the carrots with the onion and celery and a little bit of crushed garlic in some bacon grease until I could easily stick a fork in the carrot chunks. I added chopped rotissarie chicken and about 1 tsp of Better Than Bouillon Roasted Chicken Base to 1 can of Cream of Chicken Soup and 1 can of Cream of Mushroom Soup. Salt ground black pepper Montreal Chicken Seasoning and Parsley to taste. I also added about 1/2 cup of Almond Milk. Mixed all together in a 9"x13" dish. Baked per instructions at 350 but it only took about 25 minutes using the convection toaster oven. Turned out great but needed a little more liquid. Will add about 1 cup to 1 1/2 cups of Almond Milk next time and a little less pepper. This would be great with ham too!

I've made several different pot pies over the years and they've always came out great. I was hoping this is the one I used but it clearly is not. It was very bland and the dough never cooked properly in the middle. Onion and celery are needed along with a few other seasonings. I'll be searching for my old recipe.

My toddler and husband have celiac's so I used Bisquick gluten free flour. I was nervous the crust would bake differently but it came out perfect! This is easy and budget friendly. When I make it again I would add a little more soup for more gravy and garlic for an extra boost in taste.

I used chicken and veggies that had been cooked earlier in the slow cooker. Those along with the cream of chicken soup were tasty. The crust was easy but not very flavorful. Next time I will add some seasoning to the crust.

Was a bit skeptical after reading numerous posts about lack of flavor. I had some leftover cooked white chicken breast meat that I wanted to use up after making a roast chicken; we love the 'impossible quiche (bisquick)' once in awhile so wanted to give this a shot too. I doubled the recipe also added some milk into the chicken mix to make it less dry as some reviewers were saying it was dry. (I added about 1/2-3/4 C of 1% milk to make it a little more runny.) I also added lots of freshly ground black pepper some onion powder a shot of tobasco and a shake or oregano to try to improve the flavor which some reviewers were saying was on the bland side. I used 2 of the small cans (10oz?) of (Campbells) condensed cream of chicken soup. My oven runs hot so I preheated mine (convection) to 365F instead of 400F and I used a heavy glass bakeware casserole dish. After 30 minutes I could tell it wasn't quite done enough (there were still patches of topping which had not yet browned sufficiently) so left it for maybe 10 more minutes or so. When I took it out it was beautiful nicely browned all over with a couple of spots bubbling out over the topping. We thought it was very good not bland according to our taste buds (and we tend to like spicier foods) and incredibly easy and fast to make.. definitely will become a fav for a quick weeknight meal. Note: We buy a very good quality frozen mixed veggie.. big bag for 5.50 which includes peas carrots corn and green beans

This recipe was great for a quick week might meal. I added half a cup of shredded sharp cheddar cheese to the filing. And subbed Carbquick for the bisquick.
