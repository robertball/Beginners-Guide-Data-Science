Used the dry rub the day before and let ribs sit in fridge till next day.  I have a propane smoker and used the 2-2-1 method.  Ran the smoker at 220 degrees and added wood chips every 45 min.  2 hours in on the rack then pull out and wrapped ribs in foil for the next two hours then last hour unwrap ribs out of foil add sweet baby rays bbq sauce and put back in to finish.  My meat pulled right of bones

I love this rub. I used it on boneless ribs, coated the ribs, cooked on rack in electric pressure cooker with orange juice in the bottom. I finished them in my oven with BBQ sauce. Thanks

Excellent rub! I used this actually on a pork butt, which I slow cooked for 12 hours in the oven. It tastes fantastic without over-powering the taste of the meat itself. It is generally easy to put together as we had most of the ingredients in the pantry.

I didn't have time to let these marinate as I should have, however, these were delicious off the grill!  Can't wait to order the smoker for the grill now!
