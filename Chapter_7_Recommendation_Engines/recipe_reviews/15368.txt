These eggs were good!  I used prepared mustard instead of dry and sprinkled the paprika over the stuffed eggs instead of mixing it in.  I also put the filling in a sealed sandwich bag and snipped off one bottom corner...voila!  Less mess filling the eggs.

This is a nice basic recipe.  I recommend a little more mayo be used and a little minced sweet pickle (to taste) be added.  As for the cooking method, there's a easier way.  Place the eggs in a pan and cover with at least an inch or more of cold water.  Bring to a full rolling boil, remove from heat, let sit for 15 minutes, drain, and cover with ice water until thoroughly chilled.  This will eliminate the ugly green/blue ring around the yolk.  Proceed with the recipe.

I recommend regular mustard & mayo.  I always get asked what I do to my eggs because there's "something" about them.  My secret? A teaspoon of white vinegar.

On its own, this recipe would probably just be decent, but I'm still giving it 4 stars because it's an excellent recipe that anyone can easily tweak to their own liking. I added more mayo, and didn't use mustard powder. I used a mix of regular yellow mustard and dijon mustard, and used a little more than the recipe called for. I also didn't mix the paprika in but sprinkled it on top. They came out awesomely!

Good basic recipe, but it can be made even better with some of the additions suggested by other raters: sweet relish, horseradish,etc.

My mom and I always make these for Easter and other holidays.  We change from this recipe a bit.  I do use a bit of pickle juice to help with some flavor, and use dijon mustard instead of powder.  These are alwasy a hit with the family.  Thanks for posting.

Deviled eggs are my signature.  Whenever we have a get together at my place...rest assured these eggs are on my appetizer table.  I did double this recipe and added some pickle relish, onion and garlic powder, and a good dose of salt and pepper.  Every single one was eaten.  Thanks Martin.

Everyone's a critic, aren't they?  This is a simple deviled egg recipe and tasted just fine.  If you are all experts at making deviled eggs, why did you feel the need to look up a recipe on this site?

I make this recipe using 1/4 cup of salad dressing, 1/2 tsp prepared mustard instead of the dry, and I add 1/2 tsp vinegar to give it some zing.   The "stuffing" is creamier this way.

This was just OK. Not a bad tasting recipe but I have had much better deviled eggs and the amount of paprika in the recipe gave the filling a wierd orange color which some people found unappealing. Not sure thatI would make this again.

First, don't boil your eggs as indicated!  Bring water to boil, cover, then remove from heat and allow the eggs to sit in the hot water for 12 min. then put them into a cold bath.  This will give you a perfect yellow yolk w/out the green ring. Putting the paprika in the egg yolk mixture will give it a ugly colour! I just sprinkle mine on as a finishing touch. This recipe also doesn't call for enough mayo, it needs more! I  used a baggy w/ the corner snipped off (or you can use a decorators bag) and piped the egg yolk mixture into the white cavity giving it a pretty presentation.

Okay, people need to stop rating things with 5 stars, and then say, "I changed this and that and then this, and it was great!".  You should rate the recipe based EXACTLY on the recipe.  This one was not very good.  Not enough mayo, needs salt, and mixing in the paprika was not to my tastes.

This was my first time making eggs. This recipe was good, but not as creamy as I hoped.  Next time I will add more mayo and sprinkle paprika on the tops, mixing in with filling made it a funny color.  A baby spoon is perfect for scooping out the yolk and then stuffing the eggs!

I just made this and its great! I would make changes like a few others suggested about using real mustard and sprinkling the paprika on top!  ALSO: If you know nothing about eggs...if you buy your eggs and wait a week and then make this...your eggs peel much easier!!

This is basically my mom's recipe too - can't verify amount of mayo because I just eyeball it.  And I usually just use a squirt of prepared mustard.  One thing my mom would do is to push the cooked egg yolks thru a sieve, this would make a smooth consistancy.  A little time consuming but nice.  I also pipe in using a ziplock bag with the tip cut off.  And instead of sprinkling paprika have started sprinkling with Old Bay seasoning.  Nice!  Usually gone quite quickly.

I didn't like the way this recipe was written because it left out the step of shelling the eggs and then cutting them in half.  One could assume that is obvious, but with new cooks, that is an important consideration.  I love these deviled eggs, or any deviled eggs.  I experiment with them all  the time.  I would love to see a cook book just on deviled eggs.  Different flavored mustards are great.  And putting the yolk mixture in a baggy and then cutting the corner off it so you can pipe the mixture into the half egg is fun also.

Just to let you know this is the very basic recipe for deviled eggs.  I usually omit the mustard powder and substite dijonaisse.  Also a little more mayo.  Refridgeration before serving makes them taste a whole lot better.  I Am Forced to make these for every holiday and family get together.  I usually have to make 2 trays,  The men usually have them all gone before they are totally uncovered.

This was the most disgusting recipe I have ever tasted.  The mustard powder and paprika were overpowering and made the eggs the color of baby poop.  Very gross recipe.

My son and I always make deviled eggs but don't follow a recipe. The ingredients are similar to this only we use prepared mustard. I would guess around 1 T for 6 eggs and enough mayo to make fluffy and creamy. Sprinkle with paprika and top with real bacon bits( Hormel in jar). Sometimes we mix some of the bacon in the filling. Yum! Experiment with flavors to get to your liking. This is why I gave this 5* Definately use prepared mustard. Thanks Martin!

I did not care for this. This is WAY too much paprika, and it shouldn't go INTO the yolk mixture! It turned it an awful color and makes it taste like paprika, which is supposed to be a GARNISH--not a flavor. The mixture was also way too dry.

To help peel the eggs, which can be the most frustrating part of this recipe, I immediately dump the hot water out and fill with cold water, letting it run until it stays cold. Then I bathe the eggs in it for about 20 minutes, changing the water once or twice as it warms up. This usually results in most of the eggshells slipping off quite easily so you have more "perfect" ones to stuff. I also add a few drops of hot  pepper sauce to the stuffing, which gives it a little bite. None are ever left after a gathering!

This is a classic, no-frills deviled egg recipe, which was exactly what I was looking for. They turned out beautifully, and there's plenty of room for additions/experimentation. I just added a touch of garlic salt.

Perfect!  Just a good old deviled eggs recipe, just what I was looking for!  I added some white vinigar and PERFECT!  Only thing is DO NOT mix in the paprika, it should be on top like the picture shows.  And I added some parsley because (funny story) I was making them for my sons baptism and after I was all done making them I realized I couldn't serve 'deviled' eggs at a baptism!  So I sprinkled parsley flakes all over them and I called them Christmas eggs.  Still very tasty!

I had to add mayo to make more creamy.  I also added salt & a little chili powder.  I used a teaspoon of spicy brown mustard instead.  I also sprinkled some bacon bits and paprika on top right before serving.

Delicious and so simple to make...nothing fancy, but wonderful! I didn't have mustard powder, so I substituted the same measure of dijon mustard. I made them for a recent neighborhood block party and everyone loved them. I served on a bed of leaf lettuce and garnished w/ sliced black olives and a light sprinkling of paprika. They were gone in no time!

These are the exact ingredients I use in my deviled eggs. I use a little more mayo then listed, however I also boil at least twice the amount of eggs for a party. And, then I sprinkle the paprika on top for color with a very light dusting on each egg. It is not an actual measurement. I do not put any in the actual mashed yolks though. The ingredients really are simple, but this is the classic method in my opinion. I would just adjust all the ingredients to taste. Deviled eggs are not an exact science. And, a little salt wouldn't hurt.

To keep the egg shells from sticking I put them in a ice bath before peeling.  I also used Dijon Mustard instead of dry mustard, a little pickle juice, garlic power and sprinkled paprika after assembled instead of mixing in.  A traditional favorite!

This is the way my grandmother, my mother (on the few occasions she cooks), and I all do our deviled eggs. We love it! Sometimes the simple things are the best things, and this is an example of that!

The picture is misleading because the paprika was sprinkled on top.  Do not mix the paprika in!  Your eggs will be this absolutely disgusting color, and the flavor will overwhelm the other flavors.

I have been cooking for years, but never made deviled eggs before!  Hubby loves them, so I thought I would give it a try the other night - chose this recipe based on being classic and simple - it was great!  I added a bit more mayo to make the filling creamier, used prepared dijon instead of dry mustard, and didn't mix in the paprika - I know enough about deviled eggs that I think it should be sprinkled on top, so thats what I did.  Added a bit of salt on top too to bring out the flavor.  I think these are best served not right away, but after being chilled for at least an hour.  I think I know what I'll be making as an appetizer all summer!  Thank you

Question, as per instructions. How much salt should be placed in water? How much water? Are the eggs to boil for 10 to 15 minutes or is the water cold when you start and then bring to a boil? Total time 10 to 15 minutes. Do I shell the eggs or cut the eggs with the shells on? One more thing as per recipes instructions say to place mixture back into the SHELL of the egg! I have tryed I can't cut the egg shell in half without destroying it and the thought of eating the shell is not very pleasant.

Very simple but very good recipe. Used regular mustard instead of mustard powder. Always easier to put filling in ziploc/sandwich bag, snipping corner and using that to fill eggs.

Followed other reviewers' suggestions and used prepared mustard and just sprinkled the eggs with paprika afterward.  This was so easy and the eggs were gone the next day.  The only thing I would do differently is add a pinch of salt to the yolk mixture.

The recipe was simple and easy to follow. I took advice from other reviews and used prepared mustard instead of powdered. I put the mustard, yolks and mayo into a freezer bag and mashed it all together in there. Then I cut a corner of the bag off, and squeezed the mixture into the shells. So much easier than spooning!! The paprika was sprinkled on after, instead of mixing it in with everything else.

Good basic recipe. I added a dash of white vinegar and some onion powder, and some of my other favorite things! Then piped into the egg-white 'shells' with a frosting tip.

This is a great basic recipe, since everyone has listed some of their "additions", here's mine - fresh or jarred horseradish.  I agree that it needs a little more mayo and I also used a little prepared mustard instead of the mustard powder - it adds to the creaminess  and the horseradish adds a little "zip"!

This is a good recipe, but for the best ever recipe, use salad dressing (Miracle Whip) and regular yellow mustard.  Never use salt.  For the creamiest eggs, after mixing the ingredients, push through a strainer to remove lumps.  Dont use electric mixers.  This is how you make Dodie's Deviled Eggs.

These are delicious! I added a few teaspoons of pickle relish, too. I made them for a Superbowl party, but sent them with my boyfriend who was going to be at the party a few hours before me. Not only were they all gone when I arrived, I came to find out that my boyfriend and his best friend had finished all but three on the car ride over to the party!

well as is I have to give it a 3, I had to add lots of mayo to save it from being overly dry.  With the added mayo and paprika sprinkled on top and not mixed in, it could definitely be a 5!

This is a great recipe, but someone once told me to put a half of a green olive on top to decorate, and I have never done it any other way! It makes the PERFECT Deviled Egg!

I was looking for a basic recipe that I could tweak and this is it! I found the best way to hard boil eggs (as another reviewer suggested) is to cover eggs with water and bring to a boil on high heat. Once the water is boiling, cover the eggs and turn the burner to simmer. Cook for 15 minutes. Generously adding salt to the water in the beginning makes them easier to peel. I used miracle whip, regular mustard, salt & pepper, and a dollop of sweet pickle relish. Also used paprika as a garnish rather than in the recipe.

I think simple is best when making deviled eggs; however I did add salt and pepper.

I grew up on this recipe, my this is how my grandmother made deviled eggs, but she never wrote it down.  I've been looking for it, but everything I have found up until now has all sorts of extra stuff in it, but this is how it should be done! Nice and simple, the way I like it.

This is basicly the same recipe my family has used forever. The only thing different I do is use a squirt of yellow mustard to taste instead of the powder. I also make an extra egg to chop up fine to put in the egg mixture. My son-in-law showed me that one.It's just to make alittle more filling. Will always make it this way.

I used this recipe but I did not have mustard powder so I used plan mustard and it worked!  I am not sure if this tip is already listed but, use eggs that are a close to being out of date. They peel easier.  Also, use an ice bath when cooling. This makes peeling easier as well.  My grandmother recommends leaving the eggs out for an hour before boiling as well.  Whatever helps!  The only bad  thing about making deviled eggs is the peeling required!  Thanks for the recipe. My husband ate 4!

good start for a basic recipe. i add a little white vinegar, a little pickle relish, a few tablespoons of mustard, and salt and pepper. for a little extra kick, sprinkle on top with a little cayenne pepper in place of the paprika!

Hold on, folks. This is the basic Deviled Egg recipe. It's the one we all started out with. I give it a perfect score for what it is.

Now, I too add sweet pickle relish and less paprika. I've gotta try the White Vinegar thing. Thanks.

Like a lot of others, I livened up this recipe with some sweet pickle relish, a little bit of white vinegar, and dijon mustard.  Also, instead of mixing the paprika in, I lightly sprinkled it over the deviled eggs as a garnish.  5 stars once I was done with it.

Excellent.  I used Miracle Whip since that's all I usually have on hand and these are just like my mom used to make them.  I did add a bit of extra miracle whip and used prepared mustard.  I only sprinkled paprika over top with some parsley flakes, didn't add to the yolk mixture.

Great basic recipe!  I added a bit of sweet relish (just enough to give a hint of sweetness), a little more mayo, and sprinkled the paprika on top rather than mixing it in.

I thought this recipe was perfect for what I wanted - something simple. I'd never had a deviled egg, and wanted to try them. I omitted the paprika, because I didn't have any, and added a splash of vinegar, some salt and pepper, and a pinch of garlic powder. I also used prepared mustard based on previous reviews' recommendations. Yummy!!

This is very similiar to a recipe my mom and granny used to make. Except they use a lot more mayo, a tsp or more of prepared yellow mustard and that's it. Going all by taste. Then they top the eggs with a sprinkle of Lawry's seasoning salt. Hands down the best deviled eggs I've ever had!

I followed this recipe to the letter except for adding a little more mayonnaise because it was to dry. I'm sorry, but this recipe did not turn out well at all. The color was brown and it tasted powdery.

My husband and I love deviled eggs.  However, I like mine with more mustard than he does.  I made these for a dinner party and all my guests and husband loved them.  In fact, when my husband returned from Iraq, he requested I make this recipe for him!!! I gave it 4 stars only becuase I prefer more mustard.

A great base recipe.  I added dill, sea salt, black pepper, garlic powder, and used prepared dijon mustard.  I sprinkled the paprika on top also for better presentation.

Very simple, yet enjoyable.  Took the advice and used honey dijon mustard in leiu of mustard powder.

Good receipe. I did add about a tablespoon of actual mustard as I thought the mix seemed too dry with it. I also added more mayonnaise for the same reason. Aside from that, this is a quick and easy little receipe. Thanks

I would not make this recipe as written again.  Color was not good.  The mixture was way too dry so I added a lot more mayo.  I didn't like these at all.

These were really tasty, I'm pregnant and they really satisfied that craving. I did a few of my own tweaks -- I added a little bit more mayo than asked, I sprinkled paprika over them at the end instead of in the middle, put a dash of pepper and a splash of white vinegar as well.  Topped it all off with a sliced olive..Came out great, I put the mixture in a ziploc back and cut the tip off and it was so easy to fill the halves.  Definately a hit, will be making them again. My husband is not a fan of deviled eggs but he wolfed these down.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a good basic egg recipe but boy do I wish I had read other reviews before making it.  DO NOT put the paprika in with your egg yolk mash.   The paprika turns the filling this weird orange color.  It is VERY unattractive.  I made them for a bridal shower and (whereas they taste fine) only about 3 or 4 of the eggs got eaten because of the appearance.

These were really creamy. This is a good basic recipe for deviled eggs. this seemed to be missing something though and it had no tang, no zip, no bite, just creamy creamy egg. Maybe a prepared mustard instead of powder would fix that? Overall, pretty good, but a bit bland for my personal preferences.

This is exactly what I needed, a basic deviled egg recipe.  I did use prepared mustard and I sprinkled the paprika at the end rather than mixing it with the yoke mixture.  I did make a few changes.  I added sweet pickle relish to half of the mixture; my husband likes them that way.  I left the other half as is and garnished each with an olive, that’s the way Mama likes them:)  They were gone within minutes…I will make this recipe again and again.  Thanks!

I made this recipe because of the high rating, but I did not like it.  The paprika was too strong in this mix and the mayo was too little.  I would use more mayo and just sprinkle the paprika over the finished eggs rather than mixing it.

The powder gave it a dry feeling and not a good flavor.  Mixing the paprika in gave it a nasty color.  Just sprinkle on top.

Like other reviews, I agree this recipe has potential.  But on its own, it is dry and too much paprika.  The second time I made them, I followed other reviews and added prepared mustard and dijon mustard instead of powder and sprinkled paprika last - much better.

My son and husband love to make these at the holidays and in the summer time!  This is their favorite version of deviled eggs and won't let me try any other recipe on this site.  The only change is we use regular mustard in place of the mustard powder.

This did NOT work- I tripled this recipe and adding all that paprika RUINED it! The eggs were a horrible color along with being VERY spicy and chunky! I think you need to HOLD the paprika and just Sprinkle it on the top. I would also say to use regular mustard and add a little vinegar and salt. 

Thanks

This recipe is great for the beginners like us, however there are a few things we could suggest...1) double the amount of mayo.  (We use miracle whip and love it.)  2) I would agree with an above comment about the paprika leaving a funny color....so we suggest halving what the recipe calls for and using the other half to garnish with.

Ok, this is a good base recipe but it needs to be changed a little bit to become a winner. I just gave this 3* because i'm sure i wouldn't like it the way it is posted. Added a splash of vinegar and substituted dijon mustard for mustard powder. Used garlic mayo 'cause that's what i had on hand,  a dash of cayenne pepper and the best of all, a small onion finely chopped. Sprinkled with paprika and voilá!!! Got rave reviews!! 
Next time i will use regular mayo since in my opinion the one i used gave them a funny taste.

I prefer prepared mustard over mustard powder, but this is the perfect good old fashioned recipe. A sprinkle of dill weed on top is also great.

Simple basic recipe.  I ended up adding a lot more mayo than suggested because it was turning out pasty and dry.  I also added a little more mustard powder and a bit of chili powder for some zing.

I actually liked this quite a bit. Instead of using mustard powder, I used good ole yellow mustard, which I think made it creamier!

This is the way I always make my deviled eggs, however more mayo is used as well as regular mustard and a tiny bit of relish. I've never heard of paprika being mixed in, but sprinkled lightly on top. Overall a good basic recipe if you want to add whatever you want.

needs at least a tbsp of mayo to soften, regular mustard works fine, and I add relish to the mix as well. Paprika should not be mixed in, it is a garnish and should be seperate from the egg taste, it gives you a spicy taste right before the tang of the egg mixture hits your tounge

This was fine, but not as creamy and good as some I've had.  And definitely needs the pickle relish/pickle juice as others have noted.

We didn't like these at all. Way too much paprika!  Weird color, like others have mentioned.  Go for a different version.

"Mom" liked these eggs very much, but "The 5-Year Old" didn't care for them. So I'm giving this recipe a middle-ground rating. It's certainly easy and very quick to make so it was definitely worth a shot. Thanks for sharing it, Martin!

It needs an additional tablespoon of mayo to make a creamier consistancy, but it was wonderful other than that!

Really easy to make. Didn't take that long. But while making the eggs, I added a little more of the mayo and mustard because the yolks were a little bit too dry.

Has a lot of potential, On its own, this recipe would probably just be decent, but I'm still giving it 3 stars because it's an excellent recipe that anyone can easily tweak to their own liking. Good basic recipe, but it can be made even better with some of the additions suggested by other raters:

Really great eggs.  Went off another review and added 1T of pickle juice, then topped the eggs with a little sprinkle of cayenne at the end.  At a picnic, these eggs were gone in a flash.

I have just recently started to add green onions (minced) in the the mix and a little to the top!  It is very good, as well as some sweet relish in the mix.

This recipe wasn't bad. I used a mixture of light Mayo and miracle whip, which gave it a slight zing. I also used smoked paprika to (obviously)give it a nice smokey flavor, which I thought was tastey. Regarding the review above; the tint of the yolk mixture doesn't matter so much if you sprinkle more paprika over the eggs when finished, like the picture above.

I threw this recipe together while I was having a picnic.  I used all the 'suggestions' including using ice water to cool them more quickly AND added the tsp of vinegar to give it a little "kick".  They were a huge hit but the best suggestion was to put the filling in the sandwich bag and squeeze it into the halves...I know it seems simple but to a beginner like me, it saved me a HUGE mess!  I also impressed my guests with such a great idea! Also, I didn't follow the instructions by measurement, I did all ingredients by taste.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because I personally like mine with a little spicy kick - I guess horseradish is where I would have gotten that but didn't have any on hand. They really did turn out terrific, made 36 deviled egg halves, all were devoured within 30 mins... I'd say they were a hit!

Great basic recipe, and thanks for posting! I remember my first try at this. I used too much mustard and salt...  So I cut it (literally) and added a bit of sweet pickle juice from gherkin jar and a dab of honey.  People raved at the company potluck and all wanted recipe (even though there were 4 other deviled egg bringers). I wish I knew the exact measure of ingredients, but I just "winged it", LOL!  I told them it was a family secret, hehe. Doubt I could ever reproduce the exact taste.

Tasty recipe. I used dijon mustard instead of the mustard powder. Mixing the paprika in with the yolks made it orange, though and it looked a little funny. I prefer dusting the top with paprika- it makes for a better presentation.

My fiance loved these. I dont care for them much, I like the egg whites by themselves but anything more I dont touch it. So I didnt try these but my fiance who is EXTREAMLY hard to please when it comes to cooking for said they were quote on quote "EXELLENT!" Didnt even have to ask. Thats rare. I dont think he's ever told me that so they must have been. I added a little extra mayo, looked kinda dry and took the advice of reviewers and used prepared mustard (store brand, couldnt even tell) instead of Powdered. Also didnt measure paprika, just shook a little on each egg by sight.

this recipe is so good! just about the way i make mine. i use prepared mustard, and a little more mayo, and i find if i mash the eggs while they're still warm-ish, they come out much smoother.  1/2 of my family likes sweet relish, the other hates it...lol. so, i make both. on the ones without relish, i put slices of black olives. on the ones with, i put sliced green olives (w/ pimentos) on top.  it looks fancy and tastes really good! i always put a bowl of both olives on the side.  thanks for posting this!

Nothing like a quick and easy refresher on how to make deviled eggs! I skipped the powdered mustard and went with the spicy brown variety instead. Just as good!

Very tasty but mine did not look anything like this picture. The "filling" came out redish/brown and not very appetizing. Other than the appearance everyone loved them.

Excellent recipe! I used a little more mayo than the recipe called for and used prepared mustard instead of dried.. delicious!

Very basic easy recipe.  Tasted bland though.  Next time, I will add more seasonings to the egg mixture.  Also, I put the egg mixture in a baggie and cut the tip off and squirted it into the shells.  So easy!

This was my first time making deviled eggs. I used regular mustard, a pinch or two of relish, less than a tsp of white vinegar and a pinch of salt and pepper.  I topped the eggs with paprika (did not mix it in the recipe).  Before squeezing the filling into the egg white shells, I did a quick taste and I added a a bit more mayo (up to 1 tbsp) and mustard (1/2 tsp).  They were a hit!

This was my first attempt at making deviled eggs, and I couldn't believe how easy this recipe was. The only thing different that I did, was saved the paprika to sprinkle on top instead of adding it to the mixture. I'll use this recipe again and again.

This deviled eggs' recipe is simply delicious, witnessed by the fact that I've made this recipe on at least 10 occasions.  I always combine this recipe either with the cajun deviled eggs or the bacon / cheddar deviled eggs recipe before serving a variety of deviled eggs for supper or for a late night snack.  I always add a tiny touch more of paprika to make the make the egg mixture redder.

This recipe needs a little something  - try Dijon mustard, and add a bit of salt and pepper to the yolk mixture.

Some of the reviews state that this recipe was missing something & "it" is sweet relish.  I also recommend as many others have is not to mix paprika in mix, it is great on top & to replace mayo with miracle whip for a wonderful zing! My secret in getting rid of the lumps is to mash egg yolk with fork before adding the miracle whip, mustard & sweet relish to it.

This recipe was great…..I’m glad I read the reviews first because I used prepared Dijon instead of powder and did not mix the paprika into the filling, instead I sprinkled it on top.  I made them for my husband two days in a row and he is still asking me to make it for him to bring to work for breakfast.  My husband is not so easily satisfied but this hit the mark.  Thanks……

This was my first time making deviled eggs, so a nice basic recipe was just what I was looking for. I found the mixture to be rather dry and chunky, so I added about a tablespoon of extra mayonnaise, and that did the trick. Also, I didn't have mustard powder, so I used about 1/4 teaspoon prepared mustard, as well as Lawrey's seasoning salt instead of paprika, as I was out of that, too. Again, this is a great basic recipe. Thanks for sharing!

Read the reviews and followed some suggestions to add to basics. More mayo, and added garlic powder, white pepper, spicy brown mustard and a bit of Old Bay.  Then added chopped shrimp cooked in some olive oil.  Sprinkled with Old Bay.  They were gone in seconds - everyone loved them!

This recipe was dry and needed more mayo. I have tasted better stuffed eggs. Also this not a true deviled egg recipe. Deviled eggs have cayenne pepper, and Stuffed eggs have paprika. They have been eaten since the days of the Roman Empire. Just in case you ever need to know.

Great recipe, but I made several changes. I used three eggs, sprinkled some paprika on top of the eggs, and instead of mayo I used some French-Onion chip/veggie dip we had in the fridge. I had to use more dip than the recipe suggested mayo because it seemmed too dry and crumbly. Also, instead of the 1/4 tsp mustard powder that was suggested, I used 1/4 TBSP prepared yellow mustard. It sounds strange, but tasted DEVINE.

I enjoy deviled eggs and especially at Easter time.  I thought the recipe had the right basic ingredients but it was dry and somewhat bland.  I added more mayo, a little onion powder and some pickle juice.  I topped the eggs with paprika and they were great!

I don't know if I did something wrong, or what, but this recipe was very bitter.  I had to throw them out.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I'm sorry, but these were terrible.

It was easy to make...I didn't like it at all. The musterd didn't go well with the taste of eggs. It was missing something

As with others I found this a good BASIC recipe.
I use salad dressing (Miracle Whip) instead of mayo. It gives it that extra tang without adding vinegar, and also a teaspoon of finely grated onion and a dash of Worcestershire sauce. I have used this recipe (with my additions) for more than 40 years and have never had a single leftover.

I had never made deviled eggs before, so I wanted a simple recipe.  This tasted great!  I ended up putting a little more mayo and using regular mustard as others have suggested.  I also put in about 6 shakes of garlic salt and sprinkled the paprika on top of the mixture.  I had melon ball scoops to fill the eggs and that worked well.  I'll try using vinegar to help with the creaminess next time.

Great recipe! I also used prepared mustard and topped the eggs with little slices of sweet pickles which was a huge hit. I can never make enough eggs for the family!!

Too dry!  They had good flavor, but I had to add more mayo.  Should have used prepared mustard instead of the mustard powder.  Made them a little too mustardy!

This recipe is a bit dry and bland. We'll still eat all of them, but I might find a different recipe next time. There's always the chance I screwed up the recipe, but that seems hard.

These remind me of my mom's growing up. Made a batch of these awhile back and loved them. My husband didn't care for them but I thought they were delicious (next time I may need to add a little bit of salt.)

A very basic recipe. I'm not a big fan of mayo so I thought this recipe would appeal to me. I definitely would add at least an extra teaspoon of mayo.. the consistency just wasn't right. Otherwise.. a fine standard recipe that leaves a lot of room for you to be creative with.

This recipe as written is bland and the filling is too dry.  My family loves deviled eggs and this recipe only got an average rating from them as well.  Next time would try some of the additions from other viewers to give this basic recipe a little more moisture and flavor.

i prepared this recipe the way "HARMONYRN" suggested in the review that they made of this recipe then added the paprika on top. the eggs were excellent that way. and i highly recommend them being prepared that way, cause the ingredients are usually staples in every household and it makes the filling nice and creamy.

When I made this following the recipe the yolk mixture was very dry and bitter from the dry mustard. I added a Tablespoon more of Mayo and a tabelspoon or more of sweet relish. I read another review that suggested using prepared mustard and I think that would be better.

I enjoyed this recipe as my guide line.  I gave my mayo more zip.  If doing 12 eggs = 24 deviled eggs - 1/4 cup mayo (I used half wasabi mayo and half regular mayo).  Left out the salt.  Sprinkled the tops with paprika and called it done.

same recipe my Mom had, except we used real yellow mustard, sometimes after I use the paprika I slice a green olive in 1/2 and place that on top of the egg to dress it up.

I added a bit of dill weed (even better than the pickle juice!), as well as 1/2 Dijon mustard, a bit more mayo, a bit of minced onion, & garlic powder with the paprika & an olive slice atop each one! I received many compliments...

I've never made deviled eggs before so I decided to try it. . . yum!!! I made these for Easter and everyone absolutely loved them! I just used regular mustard instead of the powder, tasted them as I went and added more of what I wanted and they turned out great! I hate adding weird stuff like celery or relish to recipes like this because I don't know  anyone who likes that stuff anyway.

I added salt and pepper and slightly more mayo; however, this was a really strong mustardy flavored deviled egg.  I'll probably go with just a pinch less dried mustard next time.

A very good basic recipe.  I prepared this much like a previous reviewer - Added a little more mayo, used prepared mustard, added salt and pepper and sprinkled the paprika on top. The possibilities are endless!

This is a great start, but if you want to kick it up, add a splash of pickle juice and hot sauce. Salt and pepper also. My friends can't get enough of them.

This is basically our family recipe too!  Only minus the paprika.  I no longer measure anything and tend to make more filling than needed for the egg stuffing -- I like the filling plain or as a half-sandwich ;-)

I use a "blop" of Kraft Real Mayo and a shake of the dried mustard. (great instructions, no? :-D )

Often we add some beano and fibersure powder to make healthier and to help digestion for some members of the family.  The fibersure lends a softer texture to it that some family members find nice.

I added a bit more mayo to the mixture, also added a little bit of salt and pepper for flavor. I sprinkled the paprika on at the end. I've had better deviled eggs, but they satisfied my craving!

YUM! I made a couple of very minor changes, simply to adjust to my taste. I substituted about 1/4 of miracle whip for the same amount of mayo (I love the sweet-zingyness of it), and added a tad of vinegar as well. I also just sprinkled the paprika on at the end, as suggested by others. I made one batch to try it out and am now making a double batch for later.  :)  Thanks for a yummy recipe!

The egg yolk mix was pretty dry. I added about 2 more tablespoons of mayo. and it was also a lot of paprika.

I put a little twist on this one, added dijon mustard instead of mustard powder and also added some relish to the mix. Hubby loved these. No more leftover Easter eggs left now! With the addition of the dijon and relish, this is just like my moms recipe. Will make again.

I liked this recipe because I didn't have to purchase a lot of ingredients to make it.  I agree that it should have more mayo to make it a bit more creamy (I actually used "whipped dressing"--not mayo).  I also added relish for a sweet contrast to the bite of mustard powder.  I had a hard time not eating the eggs as I prepared them---hmmm, yummy!

I made this recipe and it is a good basic deviled egg, I did not add or take away anything, and made them exactly as the recipe stated to do. I will use this recipe again, but as a beginning step to add my own ingredients, thus, making it my own. Thank you for the beginning steps to an awesome deviled egg!

I always make mine like this, but I add more mayo to it( don't know how much.  I just keep putting it in until it looks creamy enough)I also don't put the paprika in the mix I put it on top. Miracle whip works the best.

I'm one of the traditionalists who doesn't think deviled eggs should have "stuff" in them. Enough mayonnaise to make them creamy and a little mustard for seasoning. Perfect! I do save the paprika for dusting over the top, not in the yolk mixture. Plain yellow prepared mustard will work if you don't have dry.

Fantastic with a few changes!  I doubled the mayo but used light... yolks are so heavy anyway!  I also added a pinch of seasoned salt and pepper, and sprinkled on the paprika instead of mixing it in, it certainly looks prettier that way!  So easy to prepare!  If you're feeling extra fancy, you might try adding a dollop of caviar on top.  Sinful!

A very good recipe for deviled eggs. I made them for Christmas and everyone loved them, gone in no time, I even doubled the recipe. The only thing I would suggest is adding a pinch of garlic salt, pepper and a dash of hot sauce such as Tapatio salsa picante. I also used Heinz yellow mustard instead of the powder and a little more mayo. I like the consistency a little more creamy. Very good!

I have never made these before, because I don't like them. But I did make these for a party and enjoyed the simple recipe. However, just as most people agreed, it needed more mayo than called for.

I added dill weed and horseradish and sprinkled the paprika on top of filled egg shells.  Also, I piped the filling in the egg shells with a pastry bag.  Delicious and pretty!!

With prepared mustard, pinch of salt, paprika sprinkled on top, A+.

Mixing the paprika in, tastes same, but it is pink.

These were OK, but on the bland side. I added 1/4 t. Himalayan sea salt and a teaspoon of dill leaves, and sprinkled paprika over the eggs instead of mixing it in.

Great basic recipe, I use a blend of honey mustard and Dijon mustard with a splash of cider vinegar and milk for creaminess. I also top with fresh chopped parsley and paprika. Every thing else in recipe is pretty much the same.

Everyone loves this recipe. I do add diced yellow onion and sweet relish to my recipe. I mix in the paprika and sprinkle just a bit on top for colour.  I use my cake decorating  utensils to pipe it into the eggs to make them look more festive! This is a definite hit with my family and friends!

The first time I made this it was a little plain for my taste so to flavor it the second time I made them I altered the recipe a bit; I substitute dijon mustard for powdered and added a little pickle juice.

This is a very good standard recipe. I sometimes add a bit of celery seed or very finely minced fresh dill. I put the paprika on top not in the mix. Also you can use a more flavorful mustard for extra zip.

I personally never had deviled eggs before so this was pretty good; however it had a overpowering mayonnaise "taste" to it. Maybe next time i will put less mayonnaise, but over all it was pretty good.

Very disappointed - way too much paprika.  Should have read the reviews first.  I always use Miracle Whip in place of mayo, and would lightly sprinkle the paprika on top next time, instead of in the recipe.

Had a weird taste to it...I tried another recipe that called for prepared mustard and it turned out better.  Also, prefer to sprinkle the paprika instead of mixinig it in so it doesn't turn red.

This is very similar to the recipe my family has always used.  For us the Mayo is a bit more (never measure it just eyeball) and we use mixed mustard.  I have tried dry Mustard and the taste is not as good as with already prepared mustard.  Excellent recipe because it is so adaptable.

Good basic recipe.  I used prepared dijon mustard, more than the recipe stated, and a little more mayo (soy mayo) than called for.  I omitted the paprika and put in some fresh ground tri-color pepper instead.  Pretty good, easily customizable.

An oldie but a goodie.  My step-son wanted to make these for dinner so he looked up this recipe printed it out and made them.  Quick and easy and tastes just as a deviled egg should!

I thought the mixture too dry.  I added more mayonaise and also some sweet pickle relish because I though the dry mustard gave it a funny taste.  Next time, I will add the paprika on the top as the mixture was a funny color

I don't know what people who rated this with five stars are used to, but this recipe was awful.  I had to add a lot more mayo, stadium mustard, salt and pepper just to make them taste good.  The color with the paprika mixed in looked terrible.

I didn't think that this recipe was real flavorful.My family uses Miracle Whip instead of mayo.Also,we add dill pickle pieces and sometimes its juice.To spicen them up,we use horseradish.We do use paprika and rinse our eggs out.

I doubled this recipe.  The yolk mixture seemed a little crumby and bland when I was micing it, so I added a little extra mayo and mustard powder, and a little salt.  I only mixed some of the paprika in the yolk mixture -- the rest I sprinkled on top.  They came out well and were a hit with my guests.  I woud use this recipe again, with the modifications I made.
