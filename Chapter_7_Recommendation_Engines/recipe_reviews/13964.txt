This recipe may seem like a strange mix, but my boyfriend called me a 'genius' when I served this as a side. I made the yogurt myself in my new yogurt-maker (hence the experimentation with strange yogurt uses) and cooked the foil-wrapped beets in a slow-cooker on low overnight. The outcome was fun, interesting, and packed with flavor.

Excellent! Very easy to make, and a great contrast of flavors between the cilantro and the toasted walnuts. Yum!

I am a huge fan of baked beets. So, I served this as a pre-dinner appy-type dish. I served it at room temp. My guests thought it was so wonderful in flavour,pretty to look at and creative. I'm going to make it again for my Thankgiving dinner buffet table. Excellent recipe!

This was delicious.. I used both regular beets and golden beets. I'll make this again.. only change will be using red pepper flakes instead of raw peppers. I didn't care for the raw pepper texture, but I did like the heat

I did not care for the sauce.
