This was good but the meringue really overwhelmed the orange custard.  I think next time I would double the amount of orange custard so it is a thicker pie.  The filling was kind of thin and the meringue was more than twice as thick.  It didn't have the orange flavor I was expecting.

I'm not the biggest fan of meringue so instead of using it, I placed the orange segments decoratively over the orange custard, sprinkled some suger over the top and caramalised it. A great recipe for those who have a sweet tooth

I enjoyed my pie but I did double the orange and meringue  I used 6 yolks, 3/4 cup sugar, 4 tbs flour, 2 tbs butter, 2 tbs zest, 2 cup orange juice for the orange pudding.  The meringue was made of 6 egg whites and 8 tbs sugar.  I kept the cooking time the same but plan on covering the edges of the crust with tin foil for 25 minutes, then remove and let the pie bake for 10 more minutes. Make sure when you put the meringue on it touches the crust edges or it will shrink.  The meringue was the perfect amount for me, but I love meringue. 

I made the french pastry crust recipe from allrecipes and it came out thicker than I wanted but was perfect for this pie.  The orange pudding was watery after setting  but the thicker crust soaked it right up.  I plan on baking the pie a little longer next time but the crust edges were too brown to try this time.  I used honeybell oranges which are in season right now.  The tart and sweet orange made the flavor perfect.

This pie was pretty good, but the layer of orange filling was too thin.  If I make it again, I will probably double the filling ingredients.

I jut did not care for the taste.  it reminded me a lot of chess pie.  the orange flavor was just waaaaay to sweet. I am just used to having a citrus pie with a "tangy" flavor .  there was nothing like this here just sweetness.  will not be making again

This recipe is very easy and very good. I don't usually like meringue pies, but this one is unique and delicious. Oranges are abundant this time of year, so I was looking for something using fresh orange. This fit the bill. There is no wonder this pie recipe has been around so long!

I am not sure what I did to goof this up but the orange middle came out liquidy. This would have been so good if not for that. Still we ate up the whole thing!

Good pie, but I encountered troubles with the meringue, which shrunk more than I expected it to. Next time, I'll bit egg whites a little less and I'll care for properly sealing it to the crust. Otherwise, taste was the kind I was looking for.

Really disappointed with this pie. There was very little custard (should be doubled) and the custard didn’t set well either. The meringue wasn’t good either.

I will not be making this again. Followed the recipe to the tee and I did not like the texture. Was not creamy more like a gelatin consistency. Was totally under the impression it was going to be like a custard.

I made this recipe for my dad's birthday.  Everyone LOVED it!  I did a couple of things differently.  I used all orange juice instead of using the 1/2 cup of lemon juice.  I made a graham cracker crust instead of a regular pie crust.  And I topped it with a sweetened whipped cream instead of the meringue.  Absolutely fantastic!

The recipe is very tasty but there is only 1/2 inch of filling when done. Double the amounts and you will have the perfect pie.

I made this pie today, and because my kids drank almost all the OJ I bought yesterday for this recipe, I barely had enough but added some sour orange that I had from Spanish recipes I make. It came out possibly better!

I stuck a tiny paper Confederate flag in the finished product in honor of the pie's namesake, and it looked cute! Unfortunately I can't upload the pic since they're telling me on allrecipes that its not the right size. Boo.

Will def make it again! Perfect recipe . I didn't have the pie crust so I  used  a packet of coconut biscuits and 100g melted margarine. I also added about a tsp of grated orange peel to the meringue mixture for added flavour!  Thoroughly enjoying it !!

I made the meringue with a few tablespoons of cocoa and a touch of instant coffee - the combo was excellent and very addictive! The custard seemed insufficient but left space for merengue at the end. Of note, it took way more than 35 min for the custard to set... I was almost an hour and had to tent it to protect the crust.

This was really good and a very nice change of pace. I did double the filling but my pie pan is a little on the big side and a double batch was perfect. We also don't care for meringue so I left that off and covered the top in cool whip. We all really enjoyed this. A tip, don't use orange juice with pulp in it. The pulp rises to the top and leaves a weird looking layer on the top of the pie it doesn't detract from the taste by any means just looks strange.

I made this for the first time a couple of years ago for a family gathering. One of the attendees and I had been discussing pies, and how we had seen pies for citrus fruits like lemon and lime, but not orange. So I went on the hunt, and found this. One year I didn't make it and did not hear the end of it the entire gathering, it has already become a staple and the one thing people expect me to bring.

DELIGHTFUL! I just bought a box of oranges and my daughter (10) suggested an Orange Meringue Pie - I am so glad it existed and was so delicious! I was faithful to the recipe and it turned out perfectly! 

Thank you, thank you!

Surprisingly good!  I thought it would be overly sweet, but the filling is medium sweet/tart.  There is more meringue than filling in the finished cross-section, but it doesn't seem to affect the blend of flavors.

lee's orange pie recipe was quite awsome and all i did was add just a little tiny bit more zest because i love oranges. this a recipe that i will use agian in the future.
