This recipe is wonderful! Instead of bread I topped it with polenta - I just bought the sort of pre-made polenta in a tube then sliced it and layered it on top of the bean and vegetable mixture. The polenta browned up nicely in the oven and it was great. My boyfriend is a vegetarian so I'm always on the lookout for recipes that we'll both enjoy. This one was hearty and savory and we loved it. I think the spices could also be easily altered to make it a "southwestern" bean casserole - next time I'll try chili powder and cumin and top it with cornbread mix. Wonderful!

My husband really liked this and it's easy to make. I used a 7x11 casserole. I have no idea how you can fit 1/2 a pound of bread on the top though. Next time I will try it with mashed potatoes instead of bread.

I put this together and left it for the kids with baking instructions. There was nothing left when I got home and they all raved about it - they even washed the casserole dish!

Good recipe for a cold night. I did swap out the french loaf for a whole wheat bread and added some romano with the parmesan.

This recipe takes a while to put together. I like the fact that it is very healthy. However we found it very bland and added a shots of HP and barbecue sauce in our bowels. Next time I will add a few table spoons of these sauces to the recipe. It will also add some needed moisture.

I am surprised how good this is. These are the changes I made and I doubled the recipe. My 1.5 year old loves this: add chicken broth for water add Italian seasoning for the spices use can of the tomato paste use one can Kidney beans and one can black beans crumble the roll of polenta (no bread) on top and add Parmesan. Very yummy and good for you

I just made this for the 1st time today. Prep time was longer than 5 minutes but no big deal. I did try to use mashed potatoes on top instead of the bread and even tho it tasted great it looked like a mess. I will make it again with bread next time. But it was delicious.

Delicious! Made tonight and was very easy. I substituted potatoes for the bread (boiled separately for 15 mins) sliced half the boiled potatoes and layered on bottom on top of pasta sauce then mashed the other half and smoothed over top followed by a cup of shredded cheese and fresh parm mix. Will definitely be adding to rotation thanks for sharing!

This was strangely wonderful. Made as written but added a can of black beans. Would be great with a fried or poached egg on top of each serving.

I make this pretty often and love it. I have celiac disease so I can't use the bread. I either have it over rice or in a corn tortilla. I make no changes to the original recipe other than doubling it, delicious.
