I prepared exactly (except for the fennel seeds....none on hand).  This IS the best lasagna I have ever made and will be the only way I make it from now on.  I was skeptical with putting the noodles in hot water but it turned out awesome...YUMMY and thank u for sharing

I followed this recipe exactly and made it for Father's Day dinner. Everyone said it was the best they've ever had! It's even better this afternoon for lunch.

This is so good and will be the lasagna recipe I go to from now on! Besides changing the ground beef/Italian sausage ratio to 1 1/2 lb beef to 1/2 lb sausage (family preference), and using no boil noodle sheets,  I made as written. I did 4 layers because of the thinner noodles I used. This recipe would be easily adaptable to personal preferences or delicious exactly as written!
After reheating the leftovers the next day, I HAVE to add how delicious they were! So much so that the next time I make this, I plan to cook it ahead, chill in the fridge, and then reheat it! Outstanding!!!

This tastes so good!  Maybe it was the brand of crushed tomatoes I used, but I had to add about 1.5 cups water to make the sauce loose enough to simmer.  I also had a lot of sauce left over - I don't use a deep-dish pan.  The sauce tastes great though and I'll be saving the rest for another meal.  I really liked the tip about soaking the noodles rather than boiling them - worked great!  Highly recommend!

I have tried a lot of lasagna recipes and this by far is the best one I ever made. I give it 5 stars and will always use it. Only thing I left out was funnel seeds. Just did not have them on hand. I also used cottage cheese in place of ricotta. I just do not care for ricotta. It was the best lasagna I ever had!

Just made this basically as written (I added a tweak here and there based on personal preferences) and it is undoubtedly the BEST lasagna I have EVER made!  Highly recommended!

This was a really great recipe!  And I was a first timer, so it took me half the day!  I know  my way around a kitchen, yet I do know the infamous lasagna and it's reputation;)  I hesitated in putting all the sauce during the final steps because I was afraid it would be too much; it ended up being too dry.  I froze the rest of the sauce for another dinner, and the lasagna was very good...I prefer my lasagna to be a bit "wetter."  But, that was my fault.  Everyone ate it up, and the sauce was SUPER tasty.  Once I hone my personal skills, they will be lining up at the door:)

Thanks so much!!  Now for round two....ding-ding!

My husband and I really loved this lasagna.  I tried many lasagna recipes before, but this one is the best.  We like the use of mixture of ground beef and sausage.  Also soaking the noodles is a good idea.  The only extra step we did was to broil the lasagna in the end for real quick to create a nice golden look.  Will definitely make it again.

We haven't cooked it yet but the sauce tastes good.  I was disappointed that the instructions didn't indicate which order to add the sauce in each layer.  Not all the ingredients showed up on my cell phone but they did on my printed version.

I modified it by increasing the amount of sauce by another 28 oz can of tomatoes, and I doubled the amount of ricotta mixture by using 2 15 oz containers. I would rather have too much than not enough sauce, and it was the perfect amount. I had some asiago cheese on hand so threw some of that in as well. I should have added more garlic, will next next time.

The family is pretty snobby about good lasagna, so I was nervous about putting this dish in front of them. Everyone enjoyed it and even with the richness of the dish they kept coming back for more. Great recipe!

Excellent recipe.  Reminds me of one with ricotta cheese and nutmeg I used years ago.  I personally much prefer ricotta to cottage cheese.

This was so good!  I was worried about soaking the lasagna noodles, but that is such a great idea :-)  I made the following modifications:  no sugar, salt and fennel seeds, because of dietary restrictions; more garlic because we love it.  My dad called me and said it felt like he was in Italy, and he did not stop raving about it for days - he was sad there when there were no more leftovers.  Husband loved it too.  I will absolutely make this again and I will win Wife and Daughter of the Year!  Thanks so much for this terrific recipe.

I was ready to try a different lasagna recipe and have found the new  family favorite.  The flavors in the sauce get better over time - I simmered it for 3 hours.  The sauce really thickened and I ended up adding more plain tomato sauce.  I don't have fennel in my pantry, so that was omitted.  This is an excellent recipe - thanks so much for sharing!

This is hands down the best lasagna I've ever made.  I've made some really great ones in the past but this takes the cake.  For me, the sauce is perfect as is, but for the particular company I made it for I felt it might be a little too tomatoey so I added 1/2 cup beef stock to cut some of the acid.  They loved it.  That was the only thing I altered but if making it just for myself I wouldn't bother doing it.  I also loved the noodle soaking method and it worked perfectly.  Wish I would have thought to do that during all my years of cooking!

Other than no fennel seeds, which were optional, I made exactly as stated, took it to my son's for a baptism weekend and -  WOW -  rave reviews all around!  Everyone wanted the recipe.  This will be my go-to lasagna recipe from now on.

I made this exactly how the recipe said and it was great!  I did not quite use all the sauce that the recipe made in the lasagna but had people put the extra sauce on top as desired.  Soaking the noodles in hot water gave them the correct consistency for the dish.  Will make this again

Excellent!  I have made it twice for company. I had people say it’s the best lasagna they ever had! And it’s the best I have ever made. I ended up with about a quart of sauce left over both times, which was fine. The first time I heated it to serve if anyone needed extra sauce,  and no one  felt they needed it. So I didn’t bother putting  the extra sauce out the second time. We just saved it for another meal for the two of us. I doubted the used of fennel in the recipe, but I’m glad I didn’t leave it out. I also doubted the prep of the noodles in hot water. That worked like a charm! I will never boil lasagna noodles again!

Since I have prostate cancer, I had to substitute the eggs for chia seeds and the cheese as given for goat cheese. My wife said this was the best lasagna that she has ever had and I agree with her.

I made this when we had friends over for dinner.  One of my friends took a small piece to start and said he wasn't that hungry.  I found out later that he doesn't always care for lasagna.  He followed that first small piece with a second, much larger, one and then took some leftovers home.  This is the best lasagna I've made and took less effort than some of the recipes I've used in the past.   I did let the sauce simmer for about 3 hours and the refrigerated it overnight before assembling the lasagna.  It was wonderful!

This makes a great lasagna. However, the recipe only says to use the sauce at the very bottom of the pan. Obviously that's not correct. It should be included in each layer as well. Hopefully the recipe can be revised for new cooks?

I made it for a Christmas celebration. Subbed a pound of sliced mushrooms for the meat to satisfy the Pescatarians in the family. It was great.  Everyone loved it. I had to cook it about 15 minutes longer than called for to get all the cheese melted. Probably didn’t let it sit long enough after cooking because it was hard to get out in a solid piece, but that didn’t affect the great taste!

Tastes great and looks great. Didn’t use fennel and did some broiling to brown the top. I made a mess by soaking the noodles too early, still turned out just fine.

Delicious!! Made it last night -- my first time ever making lasagna. I followed the directions as written but left out the fennel seeds because I didn't have any. I must've missed it somehow, but I didn't see where it said how much nutmeg to add to the ricotta cheese mix so I only used a pinch. The only thing I would add would be more ricotta. It seemed a little dry last night when I made it, but today for lunch, it wasn't like that at all. Go figure. The leftovers were sooo good and I agree that it's even better the next day. Thanks for this tasty recipe!

This was a lot of work but turned out great.  I simmered the sauce in the crockpot on low.  I also took the suggestions from others and doubled the ricotta.  I also broiled the top for that nice bubbly browned cheese look.  The sauce is thick.  I think I would thin that out a bit next time.

My partner said was the best lasagna he’s ever had!!  I will say it was  good. We added fresh mushrooms to the sauce as it was simmering, just after affront the sauces before you layer it, to reduce the size of the mushroom. Was amazing!!

Made tonight and really liked it. Let me address a few things. I used all the sauce. Instead of one cup a layer I used 2. This helped with the “dryness” others commented on. Next time I will make a half more ricotta mixture because it wasn’t cheesy enough. Put the fennel in! It adds a brightness that is soooo good. Soaking the noodles worked perfectly. Like any good sauce the longer it cooks the more it melds. 1 hour is enough time. But I’m looking forward to the leftovers tomorrow.

This was so delicious! I changed a few things based on my resources (broke college student status). I actually used ricotta and cream cheese and mozzarella cheese for the filling and it was to die for! The sauce was outstanding, I loved the brown sugar! Great recipe!!

I followed the recipe to a T (omitting the fennel as I didn’t have any) and I must say...WOW!  I let the sauce simmer for 3 hours. It was delicious for dinner, and even better as a late night snack. I can’t wait to see how it is for lunch tomorrow!

Amazing!  I've never rated a recipe on this site, but I have to now.  I just used sheets of fresh pasta instead of dried lasagna noodles and layered with about two cups of sauce rather than one cup, but I followed the rest of the recipe exactly as written and everyone raved over it!  (And this was only the second time in my life that I've made lasagna.)  I will definitely be making this again!

For me, the sausage and various cheeses (and even the egg) provide enough sodium that I omit the salt altogether and make a point of using only "no salt added" versions of the various canned tomato products.

Followed the recipe with one exception - used all Italian sausage.  Wow!  Probably the best lasagna I've ever had.  The sauce is wonderful and I like the trick of soaking the noodles - never heard that before.  Definitely will make this again and recommend to all.

I opted to leave out the fennel seeds, decreased the tomato sauce, and increased the crushed tomatoes - mostly just to use up the cans that were open.  The results were fantastic!  The amount of Italian sausage and fresh herbs added to both the meat and the ricotta gave the perfect flavors to this dish.  We were looking for a great lasagna recipe to serve friends during a ski trip and we found it!  This is by far the best lasagna I've ever made and it is now going to be a regular mountaintop meal for us. - THANK YOU!

Very good flavor but dry, dry, dry. The meat sauce needs more sauce. May try it again but will probably double the sauce.

I made it exactly how the recipe is but with a couple of substitutions, and the exception of the fennel seeds. Instead of beef I used ground turkey and sweet Italian turkey sausages. My family was in love with this. I also, used some sharp cheddar and white cheddar.

If you make it like recommended, letting it simmer for hours, it is too dry. I recommend using the 28 oz sizes of crushed tomotoes and italian crushed tomatoes and just adding a little more of the spicse to compensate.
