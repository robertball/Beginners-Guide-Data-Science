I used this recipe, but cooked it 48 hours as most bone broth recipes call for.  It was very good and "gelled" perfectly when chilled.  I'm making it again as I type!  May add a few more spices/herbs for extra flavor.  But it was very good as the recipe states.

First, I would like to point out that Home Made Bone Broth is in fact good for you. BUT the multiple studies and reliable sources that FO 
As most others have said, this is good.  I do change the directions just a bit. I roast the bones, and use the ingredients. But I place just the roasted bones in the crock pot with the vinegar and water (DOMETIMES unsalted, or lower sodium beef stock from a  carton). I them let that cook for 12 to 16 hours. Then I add in the veggies for another hr or so till those are soft and quite tender. I find that cooking g the veggies for  the whole time just is overkill, and begins to change the flavor in a less than appetizing way. Even though  it all gets tossed out anyway, b/c all nutrients in those ingredients have given all they had.The taste is better if you don't stew the veggies beyond  well done.

Wonderful! Tomato paste and vinegar works so well. I made per recipe only changing Swanson's Beef Broth in place of water. Left slow cooker on simmer all night.  The bones from supermarket had lots of meat so the result is a very tasty vegetable beefy bone broth. This is a keeper for me as husband asked me to make (he's ill) and I didn't think I would like it but I've had three bowls today - soooo good.

Loved it!!! Other than using beef bones from a roast  I made this as stated. Wonderful flavour and the stock "jelled" when cooled as a good broth should.

I am breaking a water fast. I did add a lot more garlic, a little ginger  and a couple cloves.  I put it in the show cover for 20hrs. This was surprisingly flavorful and delicious. Had a cup with fresh cilantro and a dash of salt.  So satisfying.  I can definitely see myself using this for ramen and pho or a detox soup. So with it I will never buy that stuff in the box again.

This came out beautiful! It gelled on my first try. I did add a cup of Marsala wine instead of the vinegar. It tastes wonderful.

I added extra bones & cooked an hour longer, but followed everything else according to the recipe. Extremely disappointed with results.  Not the bone broth I was hoping for at all. It never jelled. A real flop.

I prepared the recipe as written, no changes (In my opinion, a recipe should be tried as written before making modifications).  The flavor was very weak.  I reduced the volume on the stove top by half to intensify the flavor with mediocre results.  The broth did not gel; poor to mediocre collagen extraction. I don't normally use vinegar when making stock.  I did not enjoy the aftertaste it left.  Finished with four cups.

Out of curiosity, I tried the recipe in an Instant Pot (two hours, natural release; without the vinegar)  It turned out a bit better, mild beef flavor, no vinegar aftertaste, and it gelled.  Finished with eight cups.

If I make this recipe again in the slow cooker, I will cook on low for 12 hours.  I will also use more bones.  My fav recipe calls for five pounds.

A fairly standard and tasty bone broth recipe.  These are rich and flavourful and worth effort.   Just don't expect any magical medical benefits.  There is not a shred of evidence supporting the medical benefits attributed to bone broths - other than maybe make you feel  a little better when you have a cold.

Although it has good flavor, the texture was not there.  I cooked it in my instant pot on low slow cook for ten hours. The bones did not break down at all. Next time I will try different bones and cook it in slow cook high.

I love to make this every week. I skip roasting the bones and I think it still tastes great. I put mine on low for 14 hours.

I make it all the time both chicken and beef  I use it as meal replacement  as well as stock for stir fry  put it in sealer jars and it will keep for the week.. great way to use up scraps of vegetables and I found you can use the bones twice to cut the cost. Delicious ??some bones don’tjell As well as others so often add  pig feet  and also cook it for 24hr..I’ve recently been doing it ina pressure cooker to save time..

Roasting the vegetables and bones for 90 minutes made the house smell so yummy!  I’ve finished the 10 hour crock pot and strained the broth about 15 minutes ago. I will definitely add sea salt and I’m hoping this is the new beginning for healthier choices
