Used Thousand Island Dressing III from AR and added some chile paste for the hot sauce.  This had just the right amount of heat and right amount of tang from the mellow rice vinegar.   I really have never seen angel hair-style shredded cabbage, just tried to thinly slice some green cabbage and threw in a little shredded carrot.  This one’s a “no brainer” folks, we enjoyed it.

we love cole slaw and their are plenty of terrific ones here. I don't care for 1000 island dressing, but had some to use up. I made this last night to serve with the baked Maryland crab cakes ( from here ) and oven roasted asparagus. I did increase the tobasco( to hot ) and had to add a pinch of sugar to it. after sitting in the refrigerator a couple hours, it was terrific! wife ate all the left-overs after I went to bed.

I used bag coleslaw with carrots.  The bag was 14 oz so I added another tablespoon of light Thousand Island dressing.  I  also used balsamic vinegar to give some more tang.  It was good and it was a compliment to BBQ pork.

I liked this pretty well. Served it with Chef John's sloppy joes (which is excellent!). I shredded my own cabbage with a little bit of carrot. The dressing has a nice kick to it. Simple and good recipe. Thanks!

I made this per the directions adding Sriracha for my hot sauce.  Very quick to make (maybe a little longer than 12 seconds) but quick and easy.  This is very tasty and with the hot sauce gives coleslaw a little different twist than just your run of the mill regular coleslaw.  I love coleslaw and will make this again.  I tend to favor a creamier type of coleslaw but this is a different twist on something that is usually just overlooked at any gathering.

Really easy and tasty! The first time I made it, I had to add more Thousand Island dressing than the recipe called for, because it was too dry for my taste. The next time I made it just with the dressing (no hot sauce or rice vinegar), and it still tasted really good! Super-easy to put together, too. Adding this to my "Party dishes" list. Thank you!

This did not have enough kick or flavor for my tastes.   I used Frank's Red Hot for my sauce.
