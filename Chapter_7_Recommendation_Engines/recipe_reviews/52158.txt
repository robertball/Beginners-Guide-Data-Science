This was yummy.  I followed the directions with just a few changes.  I too subbed fresh basil/oregano at the end for parsley just for a little kick.  And added fresh diced tomatoes.  I added the butter and the tomatoes at the end, and then put it in a covered dish and let the butter melt on the way to the party, and the tomatoes just warmed, which was perfect.  Good flavors here, and colorful to boot.

This an OK start, but it needs a kick in the pants! Try adding cherry tomatoes- several colors, fresh basil, fresh oregano, red onions, instead of boring yellow ones, and some bell pepper or roasted red peppers. Now you can serve it over rice or noodles with fresh French bread and have a whole meal. It really doesn't need all that broth just a couple of tablespoons. You don't want to make soup.

Nothing extraordinary, but quite tasty.  I love squash cooked this way.  I added some diced tomatoes (from a can, but fresh would be better), and added fresh oregano and basil at the end rather than parsley, since I haven't grown that yet.  The butter flavor was a nice touch; I wonder if it would taste better if the veggies were sauteed in butter rather than olive oil at the beginning?  Also if I had had white wine on hand I would have used that instead of veggie broth.  Anyway, good recipe for summer veggies, thanks!

2 of my very favorite summer vegetables, so how could I not try it?  The recipe is not meant to "stand alone", though it surely could for a vegetarian, but is a perfect side dish to pair with spicy ribs or chicken for a family friendly BBQ.  Nice meld of flavors and easy enough to dress up with basil, oregano, or cherry tomatoes fresh from the garden.  NOTE:  I bbq'd my corn on the cob and then added to the squash right before serving.  The smokiness of the corn from the bbq added another layer of flavor to this dish.  Enjoy!

I made this recipe into a full meal.  I added sliced kielbasa, and served it over yellow rice.  It was DELICIOUS and all dozen people at the dinner loved it.  Not a drop was left over.

I happened upon this recipe while looking for a way to use some veggies I had picked up during a day trip to a local farm in Cottonwood, AZ. Everything was so fresh and deliciously sweet and colorful! I love this recipe. Photo available on my profile page.

This was also fantastic.  Since we are dieting I omitted the butter all together topped it with a strong white cheese and broiled it under the broiler until lightly browned.  Thanks

My roommate said this was her second favorite meal of all-time (I served it with BBQ pork ribs, mashed potatos and garlic-cheese biscuits). 

I loved how simple this was to prepare, and the aroma while it's cooking is fabulous. I had the recipe scaled to three, and used 1/2 cup water with 1 vegetable boullion cube instead of the broth. I omitted the onions (I'm allergic) and added cherry tomatos instead. The tomatos really did add some color and texture to the appearance of the meal, as did the fresh parsley. 

Great recipe! Thanks, Melinda!

A very simple, yet delicious way to serve zucchini.  I didn't have fresh corn, so a can had to do.  I will make again for sure.

This was very good.  I made it just like the recipe stated.  Next time I will add tomatoes, and omit the corn.  Very good, simple vegetable.

Very yummy. Didn't have any zucchini, so just added tomatoes and another ear of corn. Also tried what others had wrote and did fresh basil instead of fresh parsley.

I have been doing squash and corn like this for years. In "spanish" we call it "calabasitas con maize". We love it as we look forward to harvest time for the squash and fresh corn. Works with frozen and canned as well.Do away with the broth its not needed or add very little as the squash and corn cook in their own juices and for a nice kick add a diced jalapeno. I dont add basil or other peppers but I'm willing to give it a try, thanks. Serve it with rice, beans and tortillas. OMG! My mouth is watering...mmmm!

Did this dish last night and it was fabulous. Followed the instructions, and just added 1 tsp. Old Bay seasoning just before serving. Both my husband and I loved this one. Easy recipe to do.

This is pretty good. I am doing the first stage of The South Beach diet so I subbed diced yellow pepper for the corn. i also sprinkled in a little red pepper flakes for a kick. Very good side dish.

Loved this! Summery veggie goodness. Only thing I did different from the written recipe was add some minced shallot that I had leftover. I will make this over and over again. Thanks for the yummy recipe!

This is good, but I agree with others -- it really needs a little more kick!  The second time I made it, I subbed garlic salt for regular salt, and added basil & oregano & a dash of cayenne pepper!  That pepped it up!!   (I used frozen corn, instead of fresh and it was just as good!)

This was delicious. The only thing I'd recommend adding is some garlic salt. It was a teensy bit bland. I added it at the end.

Unfortunately, I didn't have any fresh corn, so I had to use frozen instead.  Because of the extra liquid with using the frozen corn, I only used 1/4 cup of the broth.  This recipe still turned out wonderful.  It took only minutes to cook and the flavors were wonderful.  I added some shredded parmesan cheese with the salt and pepper at the end.  This was a delicious side dish to our turkey burgers.

This can be tasty, but could use more kick, as others have mentioned.  I used basil instead of parsley and added cherry tomatoes at the end.  I had it with corn and french bread and I'd definitely make it again, but perhaps toy around with seasoning.

A great base recipe, easy to put together and useful when you're trying to use up extra zucchini and yellow squash.  The flavors are a nice and fresh but a bit bland for my tastes so I added dried oregano and basil in the end. A good side dish for summer. Thanks for sharing!

WOW - I couldn't believe how good this was!  For the "yellow squash" I used yellow zuchinni and did everything exactly according to the recipe.  (Although I don't think it needs a full 10 minutes of cooking after the veggies are all in the pan together.)  It's amazing how much flavour this dish has - truly delicious!  And it was very quick and easy.  This dish could be paired with so many entrees and would be a great side at a barbeque.  I really loved it and plan to make it again and again.  Thank you!!

This is a WOW recipe!!!  I made this yesterday for a potluck, (for 12) topped it with 1 cup shredded cheddar, 1 cup of grated parmesan, and sprinkled bacon over the top.  I put it into a hot oven to melt the cheese and lightly brown the parmesan....as I said...WOW!!!

I added 1 can of diced tomatoes instead of the broth.  After it was finished, I put the mix in a casserole and topped with a little low fat mozarella and parmesian, heat/broiled to melt.  My husband rated it 10 out of 10!

That was the best squash ever! My husband even ate it! Oh, I did leave out the corn, but the squash was awesome. Oh yeah, I also didn't have any broth. I just used water instead. I think I may have added some scallions, too.

Really liked this! I never look for recipes for sides but needed to get out of the steamed veggie rut. I read all of the reviews and did decide to add cherry tomatoes. Very yummy combination of veggies. Thank you!

I try this one for the first time and I used what I had.. One summer squash, one zucchini and 1/2 red onion. I didn't use vegetable broth, I added fresh basil and cherry tomato. Plus oregano also lemon pepper. It was yummy !! Thank you for the great recipe :-)

I liked this. Per other reviews, I only sprayed my pan with olive oil rather than using the entire 2 T and also added an extra ear of corn because I'm teaching myself to appreciate summer squash.  Finally, I realized after deciding to make the dish that I only had summer squash and not zucchini, so I doubled the summer squash.  In spite of those variations, I think I stayed true to the recipe and found it quite good and I would be willing to make it again.

Simple, fast and terrific! I didn't deviate much from the recipe as given: two ears of corn kernels instead of one, only about 1/8 cup onion, and as I had no fresh parsley I sprinkled in a bit of dried. Came out fresh and delicious. i served it to guests who raved about it. This will be a go-to summer side dish for me from now on.  EDITED TO ADD: A fun thing to try with this is to throw in some shrimp at the beginning of cooking the squash and zucchini. Delicious!

This was wonderful.  I had limited ingredients on hand so omitted the onion (used a splash of onion powder), no broth (according to other reviews), all zucchini, and added about 1/4 cup grated parmesan at the end.  I loved the sweetness of the corn against the savoriness of the zucchini.

This was really tasty. I think the fresh corn made this dish. I cut back on the calories of this by sauteing the onions in vegetable broth and using Butter Buds at the end instead of butter. I seasoend this with a Cajun salt blend that had salt, pepper, cayenne and other spices in it and it was very good. It also reheats wonderfully.

My husband avoids veggies for the most part, but he loved this!  He said all veggies should taste this good. I got a little heavy handed on the olive oil and the garlic.  I didn't have fresh parsley so I used dry, and thought it was fine.

This is a GREAT recipe!  I made it just as written, except I mistakenly used cilantro at the end instead of parsley.  It was wonderful.  I've made this 4 times, a big hit.  Once, I threw in some shrimp at the end - awesome!

I had frozen corn and frozen squash but followed the recipe with that in mind and this came out awesome.  I will definitely enjoy doing this with fresh items.

Instead of using chicken broth, I sprinkled chicken flavoured buillion and then added 1/4 cup water. Squash is naturally high in water content so you don't need much liquid. Amazing dish that compliments chicken or fish!

Delicious!  I've never been a huge fan of summer squash - but I LOVE this recipe!  I added a small can of diced green chiles, as well as some fresh grape tomatoes, sliced in half.  I will definitely make this again!

This was fantastic - My husband loved it and it was the perfect way to use up the last of my summer squash stock. What a fresh and light summery treat! I followed the recipe completely, except I added a few kinds of squash. I will definitely make this again!

Great recipe for the summers veggie bounty. You really need to tweak it a bit. I used a can of whole tomatoes crushed instead of the veggie broth,skipped all salt and used some beef flavored soup base and some fresh herbs (oregano and Thia Basil with fresh ground pepper. A nice vibrant dish!

You know, this was good but it wasn't great.  The picture on here shows the dish with tomato and I think it would have tasted better if I added some.  It was a little "oily" for me and also had too much onion for my taste.

This was a tasty side dish.  Shamefully, I had ran out of garlic cloves, so I had to use it dried.  Used dry parsley as well.  Even still, it turned out pretty good.  Quick, easy, and my family approved.  Each medium to large sized squash was the equivalent to a cup.

OMG this was SOOOO good!! I omitted the zucchini as I didn't have any and added fresh mushrooms to the mix.  I can't believe how good it turned out to be!  My hubby is not a vegetable fan, but he loved this!  I will definately make this again, next time I think I will add some green pepper to it.

This was delicious!  My garlic cloves were huge, so only used 2.  I'm on Weight Watchers, so cut the fat by spraying the pan with Olive Oil spray and only adding 1 tsp of butter. It was wonderful, very easy and quick!

Made it w the following adjustments: doubled the corn, used diced red onion, one small yellow and one small green squash, halved and sliced 1/4”) all butter, no oil, chicken broth and white wine, a roasted jalapeno I had, a handful of quartered cherry tomatoes and fresh basil and dill instead of parsley.  

I changed up the order a bit: sauteed onion on low heat 10 minutes, turned to med-hi, added more butter and added squash and s&p, spreading out and browning on one side before turning. Added garlic, sauteed one minute, added corn, jalapeno, and healthy splash of both chicken broth and the white wine I was sipping, checked seasoning and partially covered and gently simmered 10 minutes then turned off heat. When ready to serve I turned heat to low, added tomatoes and fresh herbs, a squeeze of lime and checked seasoning. I served this w a bit of brown jasmine rice and a grilled steak  Delish, will definitely make again!

I have to preface this with the fact that I substituted carrots for corn and chicken broth.   Very tasty.  Easy to prepare and probably can be pureed for a soup.

I made it with two zucchini and one ear of corn as that is all I had.  Added one chicken sausage, jarred garlic, onion, fresh basil and oregano and about four big tablespoons of spaghetti sauce.  Mixed it with rice and it was enough for two with enough left for lunch tomorrow.  We loved it.  I never would have thought of mixing fresh corn and squash together and since I didn't have vegetable broth, spaghetti sauce seemed a good idea.  Fresh tomato would be my choice next time.

My family has eaten a variation of this for years. I myself make it several times a month. Instead of parsley I use cilantro, add some minced red or green jalapenos & top it with mexican cojita cheese. I usually grill the corn, it adds an extra depth of flavor. Skip the broth, the squash release enough natural liquid.

I was doubtful at first because I really don't like zucchini or squash, but  I was given a batch of each and needed a way to prepare them.  This was delicious! Especially with the fresh home-grown tomatoes that came with the  gift!

I made this for a large family dinner as a colorful side dish. I didn't expect much. Boy, was I wrong!  It was very tasty and simple to make.  I did adjust the cooking time of the squash, because I like it a little firm. I used basil and chicken stock instead of parsley and vegetable stock, because those are what I had.  Very nice summer dish!

7-9-2016  ~I love zucchini and can eat it six ways from Sunday, but this one not so much.  The vegetable broth wasn't necessary - in fact, this needs no liquid at all, as there is plenty in the squash itself.  I found I had to spoon out a lot of the liquid I reluctantly added in order to follow the recipe. This really didn't need to be covered either.  Everything turned out more "stewed" then, which I didn't find pleasant.  Finally, I didn't think the fresh parsley belonged here and after trying it my suspicion was confirmed. This would have been much better sauteed, allowing the squash to release it's own juices, and omitting the parsley.

I tried another reviewer's recommendation to cut down on the broth, but that was a terrible idea! The veggies ended up sticking and burning! (Didn't want to knock the rating because of that though because I think they would be great when cooked as specified.) I would definitely stick to the full amount or at least keep an eye on it and add more along the way if necessary. I did add some fresh herbs and tomatoes as someone else had suggested. Seems like a great way to use up pretty much any veggies!

Made this one evening as a side to a Greek Halibut.  It was incredible!  I of course added extra garlic.  I didn't have fresh corn and used frozen corn.  I also didn't have vegetable broth and used chicken broth.  Those were the only changes I made.  It was an awesome side dish for the fish and just was good to eat on it's own.  Will be definitely making this again.

REALLY very good! I subbed red onion for yellow, chicken stock for vegetable and dried parsley.  The flavors are so fresh tasting. I served this along side an Asian inspired dinner and the presentation was beautiful. 1 of each squash is perfect but I think next time I'll use 2 ears of corn. A little parmeasan next time will be great with Italian food. This is good, simple food.

I used a bag of mixed vegtables with corn and asparagus. Cooked them in the micro and the squash in the skillet with the butter, olive oil and garlic. Tossed together to serve.

Tried this tonight, and it's really good.  I also added the fresh diced tomatoes.  I like things spicy, so I added a little bit of crushed red pepper, and that gave it just the right kick.  Next time I'm going to add some diced green chilis.

This was very tasty - the only change I made was adding red pepper flakes at the end of cooking - about a 1/2 teaspoon. Perfect amount of heat to spice it up. Hubby loved it!

I have made this recipe several times with slight modifications depending upon the ingredients I have on hand(frozen or fresh corn, fresh or dried parsley, water instead of veggie broth, fresh garlic or garlic powder).  It always turns out great.

As per some of the other reviews, I added tomatoes, basil, and oregano.  Also, before serving, I placed it in a casserole dish, topped it with fresh grated parmesan cheese, and broiled it for a bit to melt and brown the cheese.  While my parents enjoyed this dish, I found it good but lacking.  I mean, I realize it's squash, but I was hoping for a little more... bite, I guess.  Thank goodness I at least added the cheese.  I'm giving the recipe three stars considering how much I had to alter the recipe.

However, I'll likely try it again, perhaps with a bit more tweaking.  I'm thinking of reducing the amount of broth, too.

This dish wasn't that impressive. The description sounded tasty but it was pretty bland even after I added oregano and parsley.  I added some Romano cheese and that seemed to perk it up a bit.  I would not make this again.

Very yummy and quick. I used 4 cups of zucchini, since I didn't have yellow squash. I used homemade chicken broth and also subbed light butter. I didn't use parsley; just some salt and a little cayenne pepper. DH and I ate this ALL up!

A simple yet delicious way to serve veggies.  This was a big hit with my guests and I plan to make it again.
