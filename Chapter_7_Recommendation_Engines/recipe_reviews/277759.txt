Made these for my dog Molly today and she  really likes them .
My dog biscuit cutter  was small so I got 22 biscuits, and the rest of the dough I cut with a regular biscuit cutter and got 10.
32  biscuits all together..
I read Always Hungry and Bren’s reviews and liked what i read.
I myself didn’t find the dough to sticky, but I did have to use some ground oats on my board.

Thank you for the recipe.

Today, I made Pumpkin-Apple Dog Treats for Abigail. The recipe said 24 and I only got 18 - guess my "bone" cutter is a little larger.  I figured if it is good for Annie it is good for my Abigail, too. Abigail LOVES them! They were easy and fun to make. I had to bake them longer because of their size.

Two paws up from Annie. I found the dough difficult to work with. I couldn't roll them out because the dough stuck to the rolling pin,  I considered flouring the pin but that would have comprised the gluten-free factor.  In the end I used a spatula to even the dough out and then used a pizza cutter to form into treats.
