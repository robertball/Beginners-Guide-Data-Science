This just didn't turn out for us. It wouldn't thicken to form a brownie so kept cooking and then it burned and was just thrown out. Nice in theory, but just didn't work for us.

Looks good, smells good, but 3 hours isn't long enough! The center hasn't baked at all! We haven't even gotten to taste it yet because it's been baking for about 4 hours and it's still not ready! :( we followed the directions exactly. I'm not giving this a bad rating because I know it'll taste good.. But why isn't it ready in 3 hours?

Like most of the others, 3 hours on low and not done. Continued cooking and bottom and sides burnt, Saw some other recipes that used a higher heat and I will try one of those. Allrecipes bombed out big time this time around, I have never had any issues with their recipes before.

Delicious! Only thing I did differently was to add a cup of water and mix everything in the cooker before closing the lid.

I didn't like that the sides burned and the middle was raw.  I did try it and it was not bad, but with 4 eggs, I was a little concerned about salmonella.  I had to soak my slow cooker for 2 days to get it cleaned.  I don't recommend this recipe.

It was delicious. Others have mentioned that it didn't cook all the way through, but I think the gooey center is how it's meant to be. Everyone at my prayer group loved it.
