Great recipe!  This so easy to prepare and yet so good.  The lemon and garlic paired together really make this broccoli side dish stand out.  It's delicious all by itself and makes a great side dish.  Before serving I topped it with a little lemon zest. YUM!

I broke my broccoli into smaller florets, mine were done in just under ten minutes. I used homemade roasted garlic in this recipe. To make the roasted garlic easier to use, I just smushed it with the back of a spoon into a paste, then mashed it into the butter before adding the butter to the skillet, then the broccoli (I skipped the browned garlic step). I did add just a touch of crushed red pepper when I added the fresh ground black pepper. This was delicious. My one issue with this recipe is there wasn't enough for bigger servings, we all wanted more. Next time, I'd double the recipe in the beginning.

This is sooooooo gooooood. I threw some nuts (hazel and pecan) in for extra flavour, as I used this for a mine course, but honestly, I thought that the nuts dragged it down and that it would have been tastier without them. Definitely the way I will be doing broccoli as a side dish in the future.

I tried this tonight as a side to my tenderloin. It was tasty! It's best straight from the pan to the plate to your mouth, so make it your last item removed from the stove. I gave it 5 stars because overall the recipe title says it all- it's easy to prepare, lemony, and garlicy.

Edited: after making this recipe multiple times (we LOVE broccoli!), I now steam my broccoli in a steamer basket instead of cooking it in a pan. (I didn't like that the broccoli turned brown). I pour my lemon juice over the broccoli and leave it to steam. When finished, I place the steamed broccoli in a glass pyrex bowl and squeeze 1/2 fresh lemon over it, pour the melted butter & slightly browned garlic directly in the bowl, cover, shake and serve. DELICIOUS!

I thought the flavor was good, but the recipe didn't call for nearly enough liquid to steam on the time scales described. After only a short time, the liquid was gone and some of the broccoli was burnt. I recommend a steamer basket with more water.

I cut the recipe in half and used frozen broccoli and minced garlic from a jar.  Good flavor; more lemony than garlicky.  Tasted good but the browning of the broccoli was a bit of a turn off.  I haven’t seen brown broccoli but the flavor was there.  I will try steaming with an actual steamer next time and just add the lemon juice during the second step.  I added grated parmesan at the end.  I rated 4 stars only because of the brown broccoli being a bit off-putting.

Really good!! BRIGHT GREEN broccoli has antioxidants in the green color at their peak, and 10-15 minutes is too long. I cooked it for about 4 minutes, cut in smaller pieces so the stems were tender crisp.

I am giving this a 5 for flavor. It was very tasty! I was trying to copy the broccoli, served on the plates at restaurants. This came pretty close. The only thing I changed was cutting the black pepper in half. I also only needed to cook the butter garlic sauce for 4 minutes and the garlic was golden browned. I weighed the 1 lb of broccoli out and it came to 7 3/4 cup of fresh brocoli florets. I put them in a pan with 3" sides to steam. I felt the steaming method, with so little water, was literally dry steaming. For that reason, the larger pieces stay a bright green, but the smaller ones get a little browned. I might tinker with that a bit next time. I would also like to see if a lighter sat fat version of butter will work, like butter with olive oil or canola oil blend. As is, though, I ate 2 servings and had to stop myself! As it cooks down a little, this will only yield about 2 good sized servings. Thanks!

Garlic, lemon and butter - not really a recipe, and a pretty basic seasoning for vegetables, but still good.

Avoid cooking with lemon, or any acid, when cooking broccoli. Add the lemon after broccoli is cooked. This prevents the broccoli from turning brown, looking over done, burnt and just being an okay dish. I looked up on web why my broccoli turned brown. Good to know for next time, could be a great broccoli dish.

Amazing! I followed the directions exactly (which I rarely do!) and it was perfect. I don't think I've ever eaten so much broccoli in my life. I would definitely encourage everyone who is making this to use only fresh ingredients. I can't imagine it'd be the same without fresh lemon juice.

This was really good and very easy. The reason for only 4 stars is the cooking time was way off.  I took it off the heat at 6 minutes and it was already starting to turn from the bright green.

The flavor was too concentrated, should cut back on the ingredients. The broccoli started burning before it was done. temperature was too high for it - should lower oven temp. Recipe has promise though. I think I'll try it again with alterations and maybe revise my review.

The lemon and garlic were extremely overpowering for broccoli.  We use those ingredients in a lot of dishes and I will never use it for broccoli again.

Yummy!!!  I read other reviews and used a steamer basket and decreased the cook time.  I was also out of fresh lemon juice and used a little fresh and a little lemon juice in the plastic "lemon" container.  Once the broccoli cooked, I drained it and added some lemon/pepper seasoning that I had and put the lid back on so that it would absorb the liquid.  It was delicious!

This recipe turned out OK, not great. It seemed to have a really strong flavor, and maybe I got a little too much garlic in it. I think I would add some kind of seasoning salt or other spice flavor to it.

Still great even though I messed up the recipe.  I thought it needed more liquid...it didn't. I thought it needed to cook longer...it didn't.  Even then it was a hit. Loved the flavor.

Not enough water for the initial steaming; I would say double that just so there is enough liquid to actually steam the broccoli. Also I would not add the last 2 tsp of lemon juice. Mine came out way too sour.

My broccoli turned out mostly black because I apparently do not understand how to steam broccoli. I think it needed more water than the recipe called for, and it probably could've been one notch lower as far as temperature. I added another squirt of lemon juice to the finished product and my husband was wise enough to pretend he didn't notice the extra charred flavor.

I just needed a added dish for a meal I was making for friends, this was excellent. They loved it. It wasn't to much lemon, and tasted just right .

Definitely add more water, lemon juice and/or bouillon when steaming the broccoli - and really watch the time, mine were burnt a bit and overcooked by following the method and time indicated. Next time I make it I'm sure it'll be much better.

Love this tastes so good, follow recipe exactly but add more water when steaming (like maybe 1/4 cup) or broccoli burns. Forgot to add extra water and burned it again tonight. Will get it right next time.

This was a pretty easy and tasty twist to one of my favorite veggies.  It adds calories, though, so I won't make it for every occasion.  It's nice enough for company, though.

Flavor was okay. It had more lemon than garlic flavor. Perhaps my ratios were off. 10-15 minutes to steam was too long. I will give the it a try again; however next time, probably steam for 5-7 minutes, with less lemon.

I cut the steaming time for the broccoli a lot, and some of the heads were browned.  Not sure if more water would've helped.  Next time I may try to steam broccoli in steamer basket and pour garlic butter sauce over it before serving.

Tasty dish.  Next time I'll keep my eye on the garlic and butter so as not to over sauté them, came out pretty good regardless.
