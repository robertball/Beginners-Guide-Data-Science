This recipe was fast, simple and tasted ah-mazing! My husband said it was better than any restaurant pasta we've ever had, and we've eaten all around Italy. I used fresh zucchini, yellow squash, broccoli and carrots as that's what I had in the house. We generally don't eat frozen vegetables. So the only adjustment was to add the carrots, finely chopped, in with the vegetables at the beginning. Also, I used homemade chicken broth and pasta. This will definitely make it into our spring/summer meal rotation!

I didn't have squash or zucchini, but I followed the rest of the recipe anyway and it turned out fantastic!

OMG!  This was sooo good.  My boyfriend said it was too rich so if I make it again, I'll use half n half instead of cream.  I love capers too so I would probably use more capers.  SO YUMMY!

Mmmm, lemony capers!  I was actually only looking for an intriguing sauce to add to my pasta.  Devoid of linguine, squash, peas and carrots and the fact that I despise zucchini, I made spaghetti.  Instead of the other veggies, I just wanted my simple and I quartered up some fresh orange & red grape tomatoes.  For the sauce I followed the recipe but I also added the zest of one lemon and I used 4 tbsp of lemon as I like my sauce lemony.  In addition, I added 2 tbsp of chopped fresh basil.  Once the pasta was done, I added in the sauce and dropped crumbled feta cheese on top along with the tomatoes and fresh basil leaves.  It was incredibly awesome.

I loved the sauce for this. It's savory yet quasi healthy (at least when compared to an alfredo). I added chicken since I'm a meatatarian.

Made this for the second time tonight, so I took a few minor liberties after following the recipe to a T the first time (gave it a B- with potential), and I think I improved it enough to call my search for a primavera recipe over (though I'll probably tweak some more). YAY!!!  I skipped the frozen veggies and used fresh sliced carrot
 and 1/2 a sliced red pepper with the asparagus and zuke.  I cut the lemon juice to 1T and used some of the zest (plenty of tart).  Also added some red pepper flakes when I added the S&P.  Like another reviewer, I made the sauce all in one pan, just have to watch the timing of when to start the sauce step so the veggies don't overcook to mushy. And I used a mix of fresh parsley and basil--may throw in some thyme next go 'round.  Paired well with seared jumbo scallops.

This recipe was delicious!! I took other reviewers' advice and used a 10-oz can of chicken broth, and that was perfect. I only used onion, asparagus, a red bell pepper, and mushrooms as my veggies. I also added some Italian seasoning and fresh basil to the veggies at the end. 

Let's just say I've attempted many recipes, and I usually just think they are ok. I'm a pretty picky eater. I went back for seconds with this one!!

This came out great! Per my usual style, I didn't measure anything and it still worked great. My modifications were using very little linguinie and replacing the rest of the noodles with zoodles (zucchini and squash noodles.) I like mine really lemony so I would add more juice next time. I used the juice from about two and a half lemons and it looked like that was about 1/3 cup of juice.  So more than that next time for me!  And I think some basil would be a great addition.  The house loved this dish and I will be making it again!

Very good.  Used one-pot.  Used all of the ingredients except that I didn't have zucchini, so used one cup diced carrot and one cup frozen peas. Also used rigatoni..would have used campanelle if I'd had some...a shape to hold the sauce. One-pot method:  cook pasta, drain in colander, set aside. Saute onion and carrot in same pan until slightly softened, add asparagus, peas, and garlic, cook a minute or two more. Add butter, stir to melt, sprinkle flour over (as in making gravy), stir gently and cook a couple more minutes to cook flour. (Mixture may look pasty.)   Add broth, bring to low boil while stirring.  Add capers, lemon juice, and pasta.  Break pasta apart gently.  (Pasta will be stuck together but will break apart easily in the heated sauce.)  Add parsley and cheese at serving. Will definitely make this again...excellent recipe for using asparagus; excellent flavor.

Fantastic!! It doesn't matter what vegies you use, as long as you prepare them to be done simultaneously in the final combination.  I'm allergic to citrus so I substituted white wine vinegar, added 1t fresh chopped basil and a little red pepper flakes. This is the Best and now, my FAVORITE primavera!!

Wow!  I have made many versions of Pasta Primavera and this is the one I will keep & make forever!  The sauce is fantastic....  I used the frozen peas, but had to do fresh finely diced carrots (just saute them first) and I had no asparagus (even canned would have been nice, but NONE), so I diced a fresh green bell pepper to substitute.  I think this yields well to a couple variations on the veggies.  I stuck to the sauce though and it is wonderful.

Used the one pot method.  Great way to use up pantry staples and assorted veggies.  Added cooked chicken for more heartiness.

Absolutely loved this dish. Made it with angel hair pasta and omitted the peas and carrots. I went with yellow squash, zucchini, and asparagus. I had no idea how easy it was to make pasta primavera. I also paired this with tilapia cooked on a bed of baby spinach, scallions capers, lemon olive oil and fresh lemon slices. A little salt & Pepper backed in foil pockets it was perfect!

Yes, I would make it again.....the sauce is awesome, could be used in other recipes.
My big gripe with reviews ------- make it the  way it is written first, then make changes.  Also, one review stated "next time she would use half and half, not cream".......where is there cream in the ingredients?????

This was really yummy! the lemon caper sauce was nice and light, and no one complained about meatless Monday! :) Followed the recipe to a tee, other than seasoning the veggies with some Italian seasonings. No need for any changes, this came out great!

It was delicious! I was out of frozen peas  and fresh asparagus was too expensive so I substituted  couple of handfuls of crispy pea pods. I also thin sliced a grilled chicken breast and added it. I will definitely make this again.

Love this recipe!! I used fresh carrots and broccoli instead of three zucchini only because it was what I had. The sauce is amazing and even better the next day as leftovers  (if it makes it that long)!

We used angel hair because it soaks up all the yummy sauce!
For the veggies I used red peppers, carrots and yellow squash for color plus cauliflower because I like the crunch :)
I added some chicken cutlets that I quickly cooked in olive oil and threw some Italian Dressing on it for flavor while I was chopping the veggies.
I added some white wine to the sauce while it was boiling.
My husband was looking for something with veggies that he was craving.  
He was very happy with the way this turned out and thanked me for making it for him!

My doubting husband and son were wowed by this recipe.  I only made a couple of changes out of necessity: I used whole wheat spaghetti, minced garlic from a jar, and fresh baby carrots (along with frozen peas).  I also used fresh lemons.  It's true that the recipe never says when to add the peas and carrots or salt and pepper--I added the peas with the squash but sautéed the fresh baby carrots with the onion, and I (luckily) added the salt and pepper when mixing everything at the end.  I used one zucchini and one yellow squash with a little extra asparagus and onion, and I cut back slightly on the chicken broth.  There were three of us eating, and it's all gone.

this recipes is all about the sauce, which is excellent!!  I sauted red onion,red and orange peppers then added some shrimp while the pasta was cooking and I made the sauce. Combined all in the pan once pasta was done. Mixed and heated and served with just a bit of cheese. Family loved it will add this to regular meal rotation

The directions left out cooking the pasta and when to add the peas/carrots. I cooked it on the side and added the frozen veggies when I added the asparagus and squash. I also needed to cook the veggies about 5 extra minutes because they were borderline raw. They still came out crunchy. Overall a great recipe and the sauce was excellent.

Excellent recipe! We used broccoli and zucchini (which we steamed), red onion, fresh carrots, red, orange, and yellow bell peppers, cherry tomatoes, and kale from our garden. Instead of sautéing the veggies in oil, we "sweated" the veggies that we didn't steam. We did make the sauce according to the recipe, but we only used half. We then used whole grain spaghetti instead of linguine because we didn't have any linguine. It was amazing! Our three year old ate every bite, and we had enough left over for my husband and I to each have some for lunch tomorrow.

Light & delicious.  Made vegetarian with vegetable broth.  Replaced 1/4 c broth with a few gluts of white wine.  Topped w fresh tomatoes and basil from the garden.  Makes a lot of sauce!
