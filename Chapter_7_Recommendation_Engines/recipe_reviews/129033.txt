If one is mindful that this is not intended to be cake, then the sweetness is just right and the flavor spot on. Just as I expected, these had more of a pure pumpkin flavor, not too sweet and not buried by frosting (which certainly has its own place too, with pumpkin cake or cupcakes). I was tempted to skip the step of cooking the pumpkin with the spices but I'm glad I didn't, because it's clear the process makes the flavor of the spices bloom.  These are just the cutest, rustic looking little bite-size muffins, but in addition to 24 mini-muffins I got eight regular muffins as well (400 degrees, 15 minutes). I wanted the glaze to be visible and not soak into the muffin, so I just added enough orange juice to the powdered sugar to get it to an Elmer's glue-like consistency.  This is just what I was after for Hubs to take to a morning meeting to offer with coffee -not too sweet, tasty and no fork required!

The orange drizzle definitely makes these muffins go from a regular pumkin muffin to something extra special!  These were very moist and delicious.  I changed up the spices a bit.  To the pure pumpkin I added 2 tsp. of cinnamon, 1 tsp. of ginger, 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg, and 1/4 tsp. of allspice.  I left the cloves out completely.  I also added 1 tbsp. of vanilla.

I was happily surprised by how well this recipe turned out! 

Initially, cooking the canned pumpkin seemed strange, but I think that cooking it with the spices must give the pumpkin a greater depth of flavor. However, it did make the muffin batter seem rather thick, but don't let this worry you! Despite the thick batter, the muffins turn out very moist with a cake-like consistency--not super dense or dry at all.

FYI, I made a few minor alterations to the recipe: used 1 tsp of ginger instead of 1.5; used 2 tsp of cinnamon instead of 1; substituted light brown sugar for dark. I also made my own cinnamon glaze instead of the orange. (Hubby doesn't like orange, though it sounded tasty to me!) But the basic muffin recipe itself is great! I've tried a few pumpkin muffin recipes on allrecipes.com, and this one is my new favorite! Will definitely make again.

Oh-my-god good.  I skipped the pre-cooking step, and prepared these as usual (mix wet, mix dry, mix together, fold in nuts.)  I also skipped the drizzle -which I'm sure would have been great, just thought if they're good without it, why add calories??  But seriously really good.  Oh, I cut the oil in half, substituting plain yogurt, upped the cinnamon a bit and added 1/4 ts of allspice and about 1/4c chopped pecans. Yummy!

Very good.  I have been selling these at a local farmers market I set up at.  They always sell out.  The only change I made was to the orange drizzle--I made it thicker (more conf. sugar & less OJ)than the recipe calls for, only because I package the muffins and the original drizzle recipe doesn't set up, making a mess when trying to get them neatly into a little treat bag!

I decided to use a disposable plastic pastry bag to put batter into those mini cups. I cut the bag's end a bit bigger and had those cups filled in no time!  I then dipped fingers into water to press tips down.  They smelled wonderful. Will definately make again!

I really enjoyed these. I added approx. 1/8 tsp of all spice to the flour mixture to give it a little more spice. I have a convection oven so I had to bake them at 400 F. I made 2 different glazes: one with confectioners sugar and grand marnier and one with confectioners sugar and orange juice. I preferred the orange juice glaze- the one with grand marnier was a little too strong for the pumpkin flavor. Just a tip: Always sift the confectioners sugar before making a glaze- it will always come out smooth. But if there's lumps in the sifter afterwards, don't force them to go through, just throw them out. It can give you specks through out the glaze. I still feel like the batter could use a few more spices, so next time I will add some pupkin pie spice to the mixture. I will definately be making these again!

Excellent, easy and moist!  I replaced the pumpkin puree with pumpkin pie filling to make it easier and skipped the heating on the stove.  I made 18 large muffins and baked at 375 for 15 minutes.  My 4 year old loves them too!  Will definitely make this again.

These were a hit for Sunday brunch.  I didn't do the glaze.  I just mixed some powdered sugar, cinnamon & a little ground ginger & sifted it over the muffins.  They baked nicely & came out of the pan easily.

Awesome muffins! So moist. I only had pumpkin pie spice, but it didn't make a difference. I didn't make the orange drizzle, but I don't think it needed it. Oh, I didn't have a mini pan, so I just made 18 regular sized muffins (only 5 minutes more in the oven). And, to lower the fat, I used 1 egg, 1/2 cup egg substitute and 3 Tbsp of applesauce in place of half of the oil. And the muffins were still divine. My husband, who isn't a fan of muffins, gobbled them down.

I used whole wheat white flour, my own organic pumpkin puree and because I didn't have dark brown sugar, I used light brown sugar. I also cut the sugar back by half. These were quite good, very moist and flavorful. The orange glaze seemed to be just right with the pumpkin flavor. I'm glad I cut the sugar back, I think they'd have been a little too sweet had I not. I think these would be good with raisins, too.

These are really good. All the flavors of fall in one little bite. Not overly sweet, moist, tender and perfectly spiced. The orange glaze is a great match. I used a little less orange juice to make it thicker and added a little more zest until I reached the orange level I was looking for. Hubby, kids and grandkids all love these. Thanks for sharing!

This recipe produces 36 of the most delicious and moist mini muffins I have ever tasted.To accommodate my family's taste for spicy pumpkin and nuts, I doubled the cinnamon and cloves and added 1.5t of pumpkin pie spice and 1 cup of toasted chopped walnuts. I left the glaze off. Yummy! Thanks for sharing.

Wonderful!  The only changes I made were: 1) I used light brown sugar instead of dark (that's what I had on hand), and 2) the glaze/drizzle seemed a little to runny to me the first time I made them, so the next time I made them I just added a little orange juice at a time until it reached a good consistancy.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Muffins were really good!  I wasn't overly fond of the pumpkin and orange together.  I will make them again, and maybe try a different flavor icing.

As someone who has managed to avoid the kitchen most of my adult life (but now a newlywed), this one is a MUST in your recipe collection.
I was even brave (inspired) enough to substitute a Powdered Sugar with Ground Ginger (to taste) to dust the tops instead of the Orange Drizzle.
To all, I am a star at our Church Fellowship hour!
Any questions??

Sorry but these did not do it for me... or any of the 15 hungry people that I had over for Thanksgiving this year. They were tasteless. I followed the recipe almost to the 'T' including heating up the pumpkin which was a total waste of time and energy. The only change that I made was to add MORE ginger (about 1/2 a tsp) because I love ginger and these muffins were totally tasteless. Will not make again.

I followed this recipe exactly, except used light brown sugar instead of dark.  The muffins were very tasty.  You definitely need the glaze.  I doubled the recipe as I needed enough to feed my family and a for a party, and think I used triple the amount of glaze.  I just kept making more as needed.  I probably used more glaze than the original recipe called for, as my family has a sweet tooth!  The only minor drawback about these lovely little morsels is that although cooking the pumpkin mixture brings out more flavor, it makes the muffin a bit spongy in texture.  I may try using it cold next time I make them to see the difference.

YUMMY!!!!!! I am not a big fan of pumpkin, but these were absolutly awesome! I did change a little, I subbed half the flour for oats, and added some vanilla to the batter and the glaze. I also used fresh squeezed orange, instead of oj. Oh and I added some orange zest to the batter. These are amazing, and they made my house smell so good!

This recipe is SOOOO good!  My 5-yr-old asks for these muffins all of the time.  The only thing I do differently is cut back on the cook time a little bit if I use a darker pan.  For the drizzle, I suggest the Simply Orange Mango-Orange juice.  The mango plus the pumpkin is delicious - much better than just the orange!

Awesome pumpkin muffins.  The only thing I changed was to make the drizzle alittle thicker by reducing the orange juice to 3 teaspoons.  Will definately make again!!

The only changes I made to these were to sub. applesauce for oil, and I used a mixed pumpkin pie spice. They were fabulous! I love the spice and the orange zing. My only problem is that the muffin seems to be sticking to the wrapper quite a bit on bottom, but that may be due to the applesauce, not sure- besides, I am not above eating it off the wrapper, are you?! Regardless, these should do good a my friends Breast Cancer bake sale! Thanks!

Very good and very quick & easy.  I was really strapped for time so I skipped cooking the pumpkin bit and they still turned out great.  Love the orange glaze, and orange + pumpkin is great together.  I did add a little dried orange peel and vanilla extract to the muffin batter (about 1tsp of each) as well as some grated nutmeg (around 1/4tsp.)

Yum-oh!  Took these to work and left them in the teacher's lounge.  They disappeared with a quickness and got lots of compliments.  My husband took some to work and shared with his fellow police officers and they loved them as well.  Wouldn't change a thing.

I made these last night and created an account here at all recipes just to leave feedback.  These muffins are unbelievably moist and delicious. I made jumbo muffins with this batter and got 8 nice sized muffins.  This is a total keeper!

EXCELLENT muffin. Following recipe exactly yields a perfectly moist, perfectly pumpkin-y muffin. Be sure to take the time to cook the pumpkin with the spices - it creates a deeper flavor. I made some with and without the glaze and both are exceptional. Normally I tend to modify recipes (for fun or out of curiosity), but I wouldn't change a thing about this one! This certainly cured my craving for a pumpkin treat!

These make very moist and tall-rising mini-muffins. I too, took the advice of another reviewer and used a baggie to pipe batter into the muffin tins. They took no time at all to fill and rose beautifully over the tops. They are not too sweet so the orange drizzle goes perfectly with the spicyness of the muffin. Really nice and easy Fall treat! Thank you!

Just made a batch of these. I made a couple of changes due to taste and necessity :) I only used cinnamon due to taste, I used light brown sugar due to necessity (all I had) and added 1/4c more sugar to taste, added vanilla to the batter and glaze [I'm addicted to vanilla :) ] And I used whole wheat flour. My biggest change due to necessity was to use 1 medium banana instead of the 2 eggs. I was unaware that the last of my eggs were used this morning so I scrambled (no pun intended) to find a substitute since i already had everything started. I found out online that in muffins you can substitute eggs for banana so long as you compensate with a rising agent. Since this recipe already had 2 tsps of baking soda I was not concerned. I baked for closer to 13 minutes and these came out wonderful! They are moist and not heavy at all! The glaze is perfection on these muffins. I am very happy with this recipe and will definitely make these again. I hope this helps somebody :)

I made these this morning and enjoyed them.  Although I was looking forward to it, I realized that I didn't have any orange juice to make the drizzle.  I will make sure I have it next time.  Because I like chunks in my muffins, I added white chocolate chips to half of the muffins and I think I liked it better with the chips.

I skipped the step of simmering the pumpkin and spices but wish I hadn't, I think it would have given these a stronger flavor.  Still, they were very good.  A strange thing though, I had some regular and some nonstick mini-muffin tins; the ones in the non-stick tins burned on the bottoms.

These are possibly the best muffins I have ever tasted.  The only change I made was to add twice the spices just because I prefer the extra pumpkin pie flavor.  Mine were done in exactly 7 minutes.  I used the orange drizzle but also made one with butterscotch extract and both were excellent.  
My advice: Make a double batch because they are that delicious!  Thanks for sharing

This is a super easy recipe - basically the only thing making it a little more difficult is that you cook the pumpkin first (but come on, that is not difficult at all!)  I added extra spices to the pumpkin (allspice, etc.), but I wish I had some pumpkin pie spice to throw into it.  It cooked up easily, and you could easily tell when it was "done."  I did not have dark brown sugar, so I used light, but I bet dark would have been even better - yummy.  Before baking, I sprinkled finely chopped pecan pieces (the kind often used in cookies) on top.  The 36 muffins puffed up and browned so nicely, it almost looked like they didn't need a glaze, but I did make a slightly thicker drizzle using 3/4 C 10X sugar (sifted again per previous suggestion).  In about 10 minutes the glaze was hard and easily transportable.  I can't wait to make these again for my daughter's school party!

I would definitely recommend waiting till the next day to eat these. The person who left the one star review made me think with all these great spices and flavors how could it be tasteless. I tried the muffin just after baking and I would have to agree it was somewhat flavorless. I bake a lot and noticed there is a lot of pumpkin for the amount of flour/egg/spices. That is a good thing health wise and why I picked this recipe. After cooling the muffin to the touch I recommend putting them in a un zipped zip-loc bag and wait several hours before serving. The flavors and moistness come out and definitely made a difference.This is not a sweet muffin. If you compare the Libby's pumpkin roll recipe they use almost half the amount of pumpkin used to the same amount of spices and less flour. For me I will make them the day before,try doubling the spices(clove and cinn.) and put a real good cream cheese icing on them if your looking for more of a dessert. We are not big fans of the orange glaze. The other reason I chose this recipe, aside from the large amount of pumpkin used is, there was no dairy used (our son is allergic)
I have made these now many time's (always the day before)  I eliminated the heating in sauce pan process I have done it both ways and it has made absolutely no difference. Everyone who eats them loves them.

I thought it was "stick to the roof of your mouth a bit"  I like my muffins more cake like.  I think using the orange glaze will give them a lift.  I would not make them again.

I made this today, for my grandson (18 mos) wanted something homemade & not too sweet . Had a 29 oz can of pumpkin so doubled the recipe.  Did not do the simmer part.  Did pack the brown sugar.  Added 1/2 tsp of all spice.
Did not use the drizzle but dusted with powdered sugar.  Baked in muffin top pan... reduced  temperature to 400 & baked for 10 mins.   I thought they came out great as did my Daughter ... my Beau thought great with coffee could be sweeter if for dessert.

Easy and tasty. The orange drizzle really set off the pumpkin taste. I would add more powdered sugar to the drizzle next time. It was more like a glaze as I mixed it. Kids & adults will like this!

Super moist! Lots of flavour! I skipped heating the pumpkin as well. I didn't have any oil left, so melted 1/4cp of butter to replace it. Replaced the white flour with whole wheat, and added 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice and a bit of nutmeg. Took the cloves out. The drizzle is really good on top! (I used a 2/3cp of icing sugar so the driz was a bit thicker) Overall very impressed.

This recipe is amazing. I did tweek it a little, I added raisins, the zest from 1 orange, 1/4 cup of hemp heart, and a small carrot grated. I skipped the drizzle, they did not need it. I also did not cook the pumpkin, I just made them how you would normally make muffins, moist ingredients into the dry.So yummy.

Perfect!  Doubled the recipe and now I have over 4 dozen mini-muffins for my students!  

I added 1/2t allspice.

A note about the glaze: I didn't have enough ingredients to make either orange or cream cheese glaze...so I mixed them. OJ + 10x + Philly cream cheese. Awesome!

This made 24 mini muffins and 4 regular size muffins and they were awwwwesome. I didn't have ground cloves so I just used extra cinnamon (as other reviewers also recommended). I also didn't have an orange so I made the glaze out of just orange juice and powdered sugar and it was great. Rave reviews all around!

We love these Pumpkin Muffins!  Great flavor, not too sweet.  The glaze is great, and I made and used extra.  I didn't have orange rind, so I used orange extract, and it was fine.  I made these into mini-muffins, standard muffins, and loaf bread.  The only change for the loaf was I lowered the temp to 400 and cooked a little longer.

Great little muffin - hard to eat just one.  Thick and dense texture.  I would play with the drizzle a bit to get a thicker consistency but the orange was a yummy companion to the pumpkin!

this recipe is amazing. although i chose to make regular muffins instead of minis, they still turned out great and moist. I made a streusal for the top with brown sugar, flour, and walnuts and did the orange glaze over that. IT was very pretty. They are great to take to parties because they are not messy and everyone thought they were delicious. To the recipe, i did add about half a tsp of pumpkin pie spice. If you are going to make regular size muffins however,  suggest that you double the recipe. Although i wasnt too crazy of the idea of the mini choc chips in the recipe at first, i tried them in the second batch and those seemed to be everyone's favorite. Great for the fall season!

disappointing.  by no means a bad muffin, but certainly nothing special either.  I do really like the orange glaze however, and will probably use it again when I find the perfect muffin to accompany it.

I thought these were pretty good.  They were very moist, but a little lacking in flavor.  I love the orange drizzle, but next time I wouldn't put it on the muffins while warm as directed, because it soaked in and I prefer a more "set up" glaze.  Overall, pretty good, but next time I make them, I may alter them a little to spruce up the flavor.

These are a winner!  I make them all the time and my 4 year old loves them.  I have made a couple of changes to the recipe over time.  I use pureed butternut squash instead of pumpkin because I grow the squash in my garden.  I also make them a little healthier by using the Sneaky Chef flour blend in place of white flour.  The flour blend is 1 part white flour, 1 part wheat flour, and 1 part wheat germ.

these were pretty good & I don't really care for pumpkin flavor.  I made them for a playdate, my kids ate them up okay.  The icing soaked into the muffins when I stored them so they were a bit sticky.  this seemed to make a ton, I gave away a dozen or so & we had plenty leftover.  I might make these again, but only if i need a lot of something for thanksgiving season.

The batter for these muffins is thick, so they don't look especially pretty (lumpy on top), but they are delicious little morsels!  I used the small Pampered Chef scoop to fill my mini-muffin pans, and I ended up with five dozen rather than three.  I made the icing a little thicker, and there wasnt' enough for all the muffins.  Maybe 3/4 c. powdered sugar instead?  Pumpkin isn't usually my favorite flavor, but I will definitely make these again!

I loved these. Pumpkin is my favorite muffin flavor and the glaze gives it just the right sweetness.  I followed the recipe exactly except the glaze I didn't measure the ingredients I just used the sugar and orange to my own consistency.

Pardon my French, but  these are good! I made the recipe exactly as written, except for adding a little vanilla to the pumpkin mixture. I doubled the recipe and made 36 cupcake sized muffins. I will definitely be making these again!

I have been craving some sort of pumpkin muffin or cake for a while now and decided to try this. I'm not sure if cooking the pumpkin with the spices really did much but it did make the brown sugar "melt" more into the batter.

Like the other reviewers, I made some changes...
-used 2tsp of pumpkin spice blend instead of the individual spices (it's all the same just in one)
-i used medium brown sugar instead of dark (it's just what I had...doesn't make a difference)
-i made regular sized muffins instead of the minis (made 16 muffins and I cooked them 20 mins instead of 10mins)

I will definitely make these again!

I took advice of previous reviewers and used 2 t. cinnamon, 1 t. ginger, 1/4 t. nutmeg, 1/8 t allspice and 1/8 t. cloves.  I added 1t. vanilla and 1/4 c. pecans.  Turned out well but overflowed the muffin tins a bit.  I added orange extract to the icing  to pump up the orange flavor a bit.  The muffins need the sweetness and flavor of the drizzle.

I used 1/3 less sugar and subbed 1/2 the oil called for with applesauce. The muffins came out moist and delicious. The orange glaze added just the right note to it.

I made these today and they were sooooo good. If a thirteen year old with barely any baking experiences can make this anyone can! They are very tasty and have a good texture. It took me an hour for preparation and baking and like 2 minutes for the drizzle. Definitely will make this again. Oh and you really don't need cloves I made it without and it is fine??

I did not make the mini version, rather the full sized kind; oven at 350 for 20 minutes.  Sadly, I was out of ginger, but I ground the clove berries myself, and added extra cinnamon,  raisins (we love raisins around here), used mostly butter, and a little bit of olive oil.  I made the drizzle with extra zest, and they disappeared quickly!

Absolutely delicious! I took the advice of another reviewer and cut the ginger down to 1 tsp, and doubled the cinnamon; it worked out amazingly. My kids (age 5 & 7), ate half the batch for breakfast, then asked for more. I got 36 mini muffins and 6 regular sized muffins out of it, but the regular muffins were a little on the small side. All in all, a favorite recipe!

I make these muffins ALL THE TIME!  They are so great.  I always make a double batch and just use the large can of pumpkin.  My kids (3 and 1) love them, too.  When I give them to the kids as a snack I leave off the drizzle.

I thought these were just okay.  I loved the orange glaze with the pumpkin flavor, but the muffins themselves didn't have much flavor to me.  I will definitely do te orange glaze again though on pumpkin breads.

What an easy, easy recipe!  I love it so much I've used it at least three times within the past week.  I subbed wheat flour for half the required amount, and it tastes just fine.  These muffins are definitely on my go-to recipe list.

My 5 year old, my 2 1/2 year old and even my 11 month old gobble these up.  They are so moist and delicious.  A perfect treat for a cool fall day, especially with a good cup of coffee. (for me, not the kids)  The only thing that I do differently is to use paper cups instead of greasing the pan.  When I greased the pan, the bottoms always got burned a little.  This recipe is bookmarked!

Very moist and flavorful!  I added a little orange extract to the glaze.  I will be making these again!

So So So goood!!! The recipe was perfect and easy, and of course so delicious and moist! I omitted the orange glaze (just this once) and my 2 and 4 year old still devoured them!! I added 1/2 cup of bran instead of the last 1/2 cup of flour for a little fiber.

This was an excellent recipe.  I didn't use any drizzle on them at all, and they were still a big hit.  They have a cake-like texture, perfect for muffins!
