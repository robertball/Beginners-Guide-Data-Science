WOW! Great recipe! Definitely roasting it in a parchment bag works!  Enough steam escapes from the fibers so that you aren't "steaming" it (like in an oven bag), but roasting it. I chunked up some potatoes, carrots, and onions and roasted them in the bag w/ the chicken. I also put a little crunched up aluminum foil under the bottom of the bird as a make-shift rack so the juices would settle on the pan. I added fresh rosemary to the thyme, and stuffed the bird with lemon wedges onion, and the fresh herbs. Topping it with the lemon slices is a great way for it to self baste. It is incredibly moist and flavorful. I used the juices to make a quick gravy. Drain the bird and pour off the pan juices. I added 1/2 cup water b/c I see it was very lemony. I added fresh rosemary, no salt was needed. Heated it up on med-low, added cornstarch (cornstarch mixed with a little water), and stirred til thick. It was a skoosh over-lemony, so I added a small pat of butter to cut the flavor. That did the trick! And yes - the skin looks gross b/c it's not browned...but I don't eat the skin anyway...so it was fine by me. Be sure to let the chicken sit at least 15 minutes before slicing into else the juices won't run back into the meat. Great recipe!

This was very good.  However, next time I would open the parchment paper for the last 20 to 30 minutes of cooking time to brown the chicken.  Although the chicken tasted great it looked almost uncooked as it was not brown.

I used a combination of 2 recipies from this site. This one, and "Juicy Roast Chicken" It turned out great! I generously seasoned the outside, and cavity with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. I didn't have the thyme, so I just left that out. Next time, I will probably use rosemary though. I loved the addition of lemon. The flavour was really mild, yet there just enough. All in all, wonderful dinner. Thank you for sharing this recipe :)

Excellent recipe. I baked it in a roasting bag and also chopped the garlic and thyme, added it to butter, and rubbed down the chicken with it. The juices in the bottom of the bag make an excellent gravy.

I made this recipe almost exactly as called for with a couple small exceptions.  I substituted freash basil for thyme because it is what I had, and I added a bit of olive oil to the stuff I rubbed all over it to disperse the basil and garlic and make it all stick well.  I also added some salt to the outside skin.

It turned out beautifuly moist and I think many variations on stuffing and spices would be possible.  The parchment paper makes it stay moist but you will also notice that it doesn't brown attractively.  This didn't bother us since we don't eat the skin anyway, but browing/braising it for 20-30 mins opened at the end would help.

This was a good, simple recipe.  Instead of slicing the garlic I used a paring knife to poke holes in the breast and inserted the whole garlic cloves right in.  There was a nice garlic flavor throughout the chicken.  I took another reviewer's suggestion and opened up the parchment paper during the last 30 minutes so the chicken could brown.

This chicken was absolutely delicious! I followed the recipe "to a T", and it was perfect. And my husband even said that it made the best gravy he had ever tasted. So what are you waiting for? Go buy some parchment paper! ;-)

This was the most moist chicken I have ever cooked! The family loved it.  I added celery, and green onion to the sliced garlic and lemon in the inside of the chicken, and placed some garlic and onion under the skin as well.  Salt, pepper, and a little Tony Chachere's seasoned the outside as well.  Yum!

Declared delicious by my whole family!  Prepared it according to the recipe but then cooked in a slow cooker for 1 hour on HIGH and 7 hours on LOW.  I put in a little chicken broth to cover the bottom.  Served with "Mexican Rice III" from this site, but without cilantro & cumin and with peas and corn added.

If you don't have parchment paper use a brown paper bag large enough to fit chichen in.  Coat the inside of the bag with oil first, staple closed, open for last 30 minutes to brown. Works like a charm every time!

Very tasty. Will definitely use again. I followed someone's suggestion of stuffing the chicken celery. It really helps keep the chicken moist. Now I do that any time I roast  chicken.

I have fresh thyme in my herb garden and was looking for a roast chicken recipe to use it in. Loved the flavor, and the chicken came out very moist and juicy. We like a crispier crust though, so next time I'll stuff everything in the chicken and roast it under a foil tent (my normal method). Thanks for sharing!

I will never roast a chicken without parchment paper again. It was so moist and tender!!  In addition to putting the sliced garlic on top I made about 10 slits in the skin and shoved the garlic into the chicken.  This is a very flavorful bird.

This did produce a very moist chicken.  The dish was low on taste.  I prefer a more flavorful dish.  It also seemed like it needed a sauce.

Very moist chicken; however, I did have some trouble with the baking time. I did have a larger bird (~5lbs) so after 1.5 hours, I increased the heat to 375F and also opened up the parchment sheet for about an hours time. Amazing. Also used whatever herbs I had on hand. Stuffed it with celery, carrot greens, two heads of garlic, and lots of seasoning. And added some nubs of ghee on top of the bird during the last hour of cooking. Thank you for a great alternative to turkey for this past Canadian thanksgiving! Boyfriend loved it.

This recipe is awesome. I modified it because I didn't have any lemons on hand, but I did have fresh 'poultry' herbs, which I put inside the bird, and outside, marinating overnight. I used a cover, and baked for about 2 hours. Check your bird after one hour though, because I overcooked mine a little too much.

I love this chicken recipe.  I tried another one on this site and wasn't happy with it but this one was delicious.  I ate all the crispy chicken skin off it before I cut it up for serving, so delicious!

This is a great way to roast chicken!  So moist and juicy.  I did open parchment and broil slightly at the end of cooking so skin would turn golden and crisp up.  Very good!

Followed this recipe as close as I could....I did stuffed the chicken cavity with onion, garlic, parsley, rosemary and lemon....tucked the garlic inbetween the skin and breast meat....seasoned the skin with olive oil and a bit of lemon thyme seasoning mix, since I didn't have any fresh thyme on hand.   I did follow other's advice and opened up the parchment for the last 30 minutes or so to brown the skin, as visually it wasn't very pretty.   This chicken was one of the moistest and most flavorful birds I've made.  The juices added a very unique flavor to the gravy as well.  Just delicious !!!  Will definitely make this over and over again.  Thank you...

A WINNER!  I made this last night for dinner.  There was nothing left.  I usually try a recipe the first time as is and then make chages to our liking after but I had to use what I had on hand.  The only changes I made were:  I had a already cut up whole chicken in the fridge so I used that.  Instead of stuffing the chicken I just seasoned the peices with salt and pepper and then put the slices of lemons and garlic underneath and on top.  Then I had to use dried thyme because the stuff I bought was bad and just sprinkled it on top of the chicken.  But I still wrapped it and cooked it and unwrapped it the last 20 minutes like others suggested.  These changes did no matter.  The flavors were there and they were excellent.  This will become my go to roasted chicken recipe.  The kids loved it!  Thank you for sharing.

Loved the taste. I just put it in a stoneware baker from pampered chef and it tasted great. The skin didn't crisp but that's OK as skin isn't good for you anyway!

Thank you for sharing this recipe. The chicken was moist , however there was no flavor from the thyme, nor the lemons.  It was a plain steamed chicken. The
Concept is good, but needs more tweaking.

Wonderful, moist chicken - we aren't fond of thyme and I have rosemary growing in my garden so I used it instead, otherwise I made it just as recommended.  This truly was the moistest melt in your mouth chicken I've ever made.It took a long time to cook.  Since I'm still learning how to use my new convection oven I can't say for sure it took longer because of the parchment paper or because the chicken I used was a very big one.   I will definitely make this for company, it's a pretty bird both before it goes in and after it'd cooked.

Delish! If you want brown colored skin, just rub outside with Kitchen Bouquet, also good to add to any gravy. Or, if color is unappetizing, just cut up chicken in kitchen before anyone sees it and sprinkle with fresh parsley. Don't miss out on great recipe for cosmetic reasons.

The color of this was a bit off-putting, particularly to my husband.  Once I got him past that though we both thought the taste and moistness of the chicken was remarkable.  I don't know if I will make this again because I don't know if he will eat it due to the gray/white appearance of the meat that is caused by basically steaming it in the parchment paper.

I loved this! I mixed it with the Juicy Roasted Chicken recipe and used all the ingredients but didn't wrap it as suggested. I popped it in a pyrex dish (my roasting pan didn't fit in the European oven!) and added all the ingredients + some extra spices (chopped onion, garlic salt, garlic cloves inside/outside, lemons everywhere, provincial herbs, butter) and then brushed the liquid over (no baste tool in Spain!) once and it was still perfect. Near the end I covered it loosely in aluminium, turned off the oven and let it rest in there for a while as I prepared the other food. It came out soo juicy, flavorful, delicious, it didn't even need something to dip in because it's so yummy.  Would make again definitely!

This was good but I prefer to cook my chicken to a safe temperature which took close to 2 hrs.  Also I did not enjoy how the skin was turning out so soft (my family loves crispy skin), so I uncovered about 40 minutes before it was done, but the skin was still sort of soggy.  I will make again but with my own changes.  I also found that the lemons & thyme kind of disappeared in the overall flavor. Next time I will add more.  Thanks for submitting.

Didn't have lemons so used limes which was also very nice.  Agree with others, it didn't look great so carve before presenting.  I will definitely make this again.

I thought this was simple and delicious!! I threw some chopped celery into the cavity with the lemons.  I also opened up the parchment paper and removed the lemons from on top of the chicken the last 30 minutes.  Made a gravy out of the juices left after cooking.  SO GOOD!!

This was a delicious and simple recipe. I cooked it last night and my family absolutely loved it. I wasn't sure what it meant to form a loose parcel so i just folded the parchment paper on top and secured it with a clip and the chicken was very moist. I tweaked the recipe slightly by using dried thyme instead of fresh and using garlic salt in addition to fresh sliced garlic. The only problem I encountered was that the chicken was not fully cooked in the 1 1/2 hours specified so I increased the temperature to 350 degrees and cooked it for an additional hour.

Didn't have lemons or thyme. Rubbed it in olive oil and sprinkled garlic salt on. Slid sliced garlic under the skin and put rest on top. Had an almost 6lb bird and cooked it for 2 1/2 hrs. Opened parchment for last 1/2 hour. I will never cook a whole chicken any other way. The most juicy and tender chicken we've ever had.

Made it tonight although I did put in a few cloves of garlic (in cavity and sliced under skin).  It was incredibly moist and full of flavour.  Would definitely make it again in a heartbeat.  Going to crock pot the bones to make a small soup out of the rest.

While the chicken was indeed moist, it was a gray color. It looked like it had been boiled. I ended up shredding it, and using it for taco meat.

I really like this, and as the other reviews I added onion and garlic under the skin, and opened up the parchment paper for the last 30 mins.
I have 3 kids and 1 loved it the other 2 Ok. I would make again thought , very easy and I loved the smell in the house

We followed this recipe as written.  It took almost 3 hours to get the meat thermometer to the desired temp.  We do know our oven is at the correct temp.  While the meat was moist we found it did not have any special taste.  Just tasted like baked chicken.  Will not be making this again.
