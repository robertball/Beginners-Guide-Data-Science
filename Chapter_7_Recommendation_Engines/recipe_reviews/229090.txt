Excellent!! Smooth taste! I added portabella mushrooms and scooped the Storganoff onto a baked potato. I am passing around the recipe and will definitely make it again!!!!

I made this for the weekly recipe of the week. My family said it was more than a five star recipe. I doubled the recipe since I had 5 to serve, but kept the ground beef to one pound and added in 8 ounces of sliced portabella mushrooms. Served over egg noodles. There wasn't any leftover, since a few had seconds. Certainly a hit at my house.

* The original instructions said UP TO one hour. I don't do it for that long, but Mitzie doubles this recipe and that might be why she says "up to one hour". I'm pleased people enjoyed it, and by all means add/subtract stuff to taste. Mitzie did originally call for fresh mushrooms but I don't like those so I tweaked it myself. Make it fit YOUR family -- Mitzie and I sure won't mind :)

Pretty good recipe, and easy to make. I added a bit of red wine as well, and used herbed cream cheese because that was what I had in the fridge. Taste was quite good! I'll definitely use this recipe as a starting point in the future.

I thought this recipe was great! To me it was like a "Hamburger Helper" meal but so so so much better because it is made with real and fresh ingredients. Easy to put together and I did add a small can of sliced mushrooms, left the meat cook for about 1/2 hour on very low with the lid on and did add about 1/2 c. more broth to make sure I had enough sauce (love sauce). Added the sour cream and cream cheese right before serving and had a fabulous meal. When making meals that call for broth I do not use salt but do add to taste some boullion so not only do I add salt but more flavor too. Thanks Jarrie! This recipe is a keeper for me. (recipe made for *RECIPE GROUP*) #Update# - had leftovers for lunch over toast served like an hot open faced sandwich and liked it even better than having it over noodles.

Recipe Group Selection ~ 29, December 2012 – I’ll admit, I only made this recipe because it was the Recipe Group pick for this week.  I grew up with my great-grandmother’s stroganoff using beef not hamburger.  Well, I was very pleasantly surprised with this recipe.  It was nice and creamy and delicious served over egg noodles.  I made a double batch so that we would have leftovers.  We actually liked this better the second day; the flavors seemed to be more prominent.   The one change I made was in the cooking time.  I only let the mixture simmer about 15 minutes rather than 1 hour.  I think the recipe would have lost the creaminess if it cooked for the entire hour.  Fifteen minutes worked well for me.

I was looking for a stroganoff recipe that didn't call for "cream of..." And this was perfect! Great flavor! I only simmered for 10-15 min while my noodles were cooking. It was a bit thick so I had to add milk to thin it down so next time I'll use a little less flour (maybe 2T.). Picky kids and hubby all ate it.

Very good but I have to agree w/sassy that something seemed to be missing, maybe it was the mushrooms that I typically add?! IDK. Anyway, my sauce was "gravy-like" immediately so I just heated thru for a few minutes. It was thick so I think it would've burned go nothingness in an hour's time. Is that a misprint? If I were to make again I'd double the broth.

Yum!  Added fresh sliced mushrooms with the onion, and only needed to cook for about 10 minutes before it thickened up.  Delicious!!

Great recipe. Family loves it. I found that the cook time is a LOT less. The flour pretty much thickens it within minutes. Will definitely make this again!

Made for Recipe Group. Easy to make, good flavor, but missing a little something. I did not cook this for the hour. It would have been seriously dried out by that time. After you make the roux, it only needs about 10 minutes to cook out the flour. Satisfied hubby's craving for beefy creamy noodles. Thanks for the recipe.

Recipe group selection of 12/29/12.  This seemed like a very good start.  That small bit of tomato in my usual recipe does add quite a bit to the flavor and of course the mushrooms.  I am not a big fan of cream cheese so I eliminated that and increased the sour cream to 1/2 a cup and just cooked it until it reached the right consistency.  I also cut back on the flour to about 2 tbs.  Thanks for sharing, Jarrie!

This recipe was a great starting point - I made a few modifications based on likes/dislikes of ingredients and what I had on hand.  I used shallots instead of onions, beef boullion instead of broth (but will add more water next time as it came out a bit too salty with regular dilution), left out the sour cream (as I didn't have any on hand), and added frozen peas in the last 5 minutes of cooking.  I served this over baked potatoes, as suggested in previous reviews, and my whole family loved it!  It definitely did not need 1 hour of cooking time - more like 20-25 minutes.  This was a delicious, quick and easy complete meal that was great for a busy weeknight.

This recipe doesn't mesure up to the Stroganoff made with pieces of meat, but still makes a tasty and budget friendly meal. 
I added 8 OZ of mushrooms. The mixture was  very thick and I had to add a splash of water few times. Next time, either I will reduce the flour to 2 Tablespoons or up the broth to 2 cups. Also, the dish didn't need to simmer for that long, 30 minutes was plenty. I served over buttered egg noodles.

Delish! I made it exactly as the recipe was written.  It was a little thick early in the cooking process so I added a little more beef broth.  We like well seasoned food so I added a little more salt, pepper and worcestershire towards the end.  No different added ingredients.  I cooked it for approx. 30 mins. and put it over baked potatoes only because we eat a lot of pasta. My teen boys ate every bite!

Very good. I did add mushrooms and a tablespoon of tomato paste. It made plenty for a family of 5 with leftovers for my husband & I for lunch the following day and I think it was even tastier the second day.

Added a little milk to make it a bit more liquidy. My husband told me he'd give it 9 out of 5 stars. It was delicious!

Loved this recipe.  I was looking for a recipe that doesn't use wine (never use) or cream of mushroom soup.  I think if you use canned soup in a recipe, you make it taste like canned soup or a casserole--neither of which I like.  I used beef bullion cubes and water and left out the salt  instead of broth because I didn't have any.  I , like others, had to double the liquid.  I also added mushrooms.  The recipe cam out rich and creamy and delicious!

My family loved this stroganoff! The only adjustment I made was to saute 8oz of mushrooms with the onion and garlic. I also added slightly more broth.  A perfect creamy dish over wide egg noodles.  Delicious comfort food!

Sauce turned out a little too thick. Ended up trying to thin it out at the end. I may try this again with a little less flour.

An excellent ground beef version of stroganoff.  I don't even add the cream cheese at the end.  It is delicious as is.  Thank you for a great use for ground beef.

I made a double recipe.  I also added mushrooms.  I used 1/4 cup cream cheese and 1/2 cup of sour cream and that was plenty. I also needed much more beef broth to maintain consistency and flavor! Over all it tasted yummy enough to make again! I served a salad and Texas style toast as sides...

I just made this--without the flour and over rice (gluten free version).  It was quite yummy--and way easy.  I can't wait to try it with mushrooms and maybe another veg...I missed the veg....but will definitely make this again and again!

This is a hearty, creamy dinner that almost anyone would enjoy.  I followed the recipe except I added fresh shrooms with the onion.  I also put in a full can of broth. The mixture was thick in about 30 minutes.  I am saving this to my recipe box and will make again.  Thanks for sharing!

This was quick and easy to make.  I added 8 oz of mushrooms.  Agree with the others that it was gravy like immediately.  I cooked the noodles and had dinner on the table within a half hour.  Great week night meal.

Wasn't too terrible impressed because there was a huge loss in flavor from cream mixture at the end. I was really looking forward to it considering all the rave reviews. I followed the recipe as written. The sour cream and cream cheese took away a lot of the beef/onion flavoring that went into this dish. However, the texture and consistency was perfect, and maybe just a little too thick because I had to add a bit more beef broth because it was soooo thick at first... just seemed to be missing something in flavor. I think cream of mushroom soup, or maybe even half the sour cream/cream cheese, might have worked better? We thought it was much too bland for our liking. I tried to cook as written, but will have to add my own flair to it next time. I was happy with how the 'gravy' made so easily for quick results, but it certainly doesn't need very long to cook once your gravy is done. This would be a great meal for a someone looking to make a quick dinner! We will try this again and tweak to our liking with more flavor, but it was a great recipe to work from...

Wow! This is so good! I add a little more garlic and will use regular sour cream but besides those minor things just as directed. It is delicious and is a huge hit in our house. I do think it becomes gravy-like much sooner than an hour so you don't have to start it so early. Thanks for this recipe!

I made this for my family because i wanted real homemade beef stroganoff using ground beef.  I didn't want to use prepared soup in the recipe.  This was delicious.  The mustard added a surprisingly good flavor.  I added beef broth because the gravy was too thick, served with sautéed mushrooms and egg noodles.  I made the recipe for 10 so I would have plenty for 6.  Everyone had seconds.  Even my picky 13 year old loved it!! This will be a favorite for years to come !!!!

Pretty good.   I did add more broth...probably another 3/4 cup or so, along with some canned mushrooms, and only simmered for 10-15 minutes.

Me and the kids really liked this, I will probably use a little less mustard and I used a cup and a half of beef consomme instead of one cup. I simmered it for 30 minutes and it turned out the consistency we wanted. I will make this again!

This really went beyond my expectations!! I did double the sauce. And I'm glad I did. I cut down on the flour-4 tbsp so it would not be too thick as some other reviewers commented. It did have a gravy-like consistency immediately but I continued to let it simmer on low for the full hour. This did not loose creaminess at all and actually I think intensified the flavor.  I also added extra Worcestershire and garlic. I used Dijon mustard and added a bay leaf and 8 oz of mushrooms. Wonderful!!! Thank you Jarrie for a fantastic recipe!

Pretty good.  I was surprised it didn't taste like hamburger helper, which is gross.  My picky husband liked it too.  I ended up adding a lot more beef broth because it was too gummy.  It needed a little salt too.

Easy to make and my daughter loved it. I did not have any beef broth and used chicken- I put in more broth than called fir. Also I did not have cream cheese and just used more regular sour cream. Next time I want to try it with mushroom for an increase yum factor

I really wasn't crazy about this... not sure if it was because it was the ground beef instead of thinly sliced beef? Too heavy on the mushrooms? I don't know... I wanted to love it, but it was meh...

DEE-LISH! The mustard gave it that extra little twang that was so subtle, yet so important to the overall flavor of this dish.  I doubled the sour cream and omitted the cream cheese (as I didn't have any on hand) and I added a few splashed of white wine for another level of flavor. Oh, and fresh mushrooms. It was fabulous! Surprisningly decadent.

I was very satisfied with this recipe. I followed exactly but didnt have beef broth used veggie broth and it was still very good, can only imagine it with beef broth and will use that next time for sure.
The cooking for an hour is a bit much I cooked about 20 mins and it was perfect. Next time I will try adding mushrooms, cause that sounds good and maybe a splash of wine... Thanks, will be a keeper for sure.

Made this for Recipe Group...We thought this was great! I added sliced mushrooms and more broth then called for, so it would be a little 'saucier'. Really good flavor and something that I will definitely be making again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Easy to make, most of the work ahead of the dinner hour, which I like very much.  It was a little bland and heavy.  It could use more spice and a bright note.

Best stroganoff I’ve made! Only changes: added ground cayenne pepper, a couple dashes hot sauce, and a can of cream of mushroom soup. (We boiled frozen green peas with the egg noodles for an extra veggie).

This one has become a staple around here with my son asking for it a couple times a month. I add a healthy serving of sliced mushrooms to the onions and garlic. I've never added the cream cheese though, still great without it. Otherwise I pretty much follow the recipe, but I don't measure most of the spices and other ingredients anymore, just throw it in. Can't go wrong.

This was a very yummy meal. I did have to improvise because I failed to read the directions all the way through about simmering the sauce for an hour. My husband jumped in and helped by using the fat for the gravy instead of draining it like it said. All in all it was a wonderful Friday night meal and 2 out of my 3 picky children liked it!

Easy to make!  The only change I made to the base of the recipe was I used only a 1/2 teaspoon of mustard (and I'm glad I did).  I also added 8oz sautéed baby bella mushrooms right before the sour cream and cream cheese was mixed in.  I served it over egg noodles.  It reminded me of hamburger helper but better because it was homemade.  I'll make it once in a while and next time I'll double the sauce and add more mushrooms.

I made this recipe exactly as is and it was pretty bland.   I added additional cream cheese and sour cream, as well as quite a bit more salt, black pepper, mustard and worcestshire to taste.  I also cooked up some kale simply using some olive oil and garlic powder and simmered that, and tossed that in at the end.  My husband had thirds- he LOVED it.  With my modifications I made what tasted like a comfort food favorite- Hamburger Helper- but organically.  Delish!  Will make again for sure.

I added mushrooms to the recipe. I decided to fry them separately in butter, and then add them at the end. I also used mushroom broth instead of beef broth, and I added more liquid than one cup, as I deemed necessary. I did not cook the ground beef mixture for one hour, I felt that was too long. I let it simmer for about half an hour. Good recipe. Made 4 servings

Very good! I subsituted the ground beef for ground venison as I have a freezer full of it, and added mushrooms. Smooth and creamy texture of the gravy. I will make this again.

This is a good recipe, but the consistency was off. One cup of beef broth is not near enough. I used two, and it was very thick without any sort of gravy consistency. As a result, it was rather dry. Could be a four star recipe if you added more broth-maybe 4 cups.

My son made this as part of his cooking merit badge for boy scouts.  He followed the recipe exactly as I was standing there watching him the whole time.  It was good, but not great.  The "gravy" was too thick per the recipe, so we added in another 4 oz or so of beef broth (what was left of the can).  It still came out pretty thick.   Was a little bland...next time I think I'll use less flour and add a splash of sherry.

Easy and tasty. I also substituted extra sour cream for the cream cheese. Could have used mushrooms or peas for sure. My family liked it!

I wanted to sauce a little thinner, so I added mushrooms, a can of golden mushroom soup and one can of water. Came out great!

Exactly what I was looking for!  I didn't want something with a can of condensed soup or a package of gravy mix -- this is fabulous!  I followed the recipe exactly and my husband loves it.  I didn't have noodles, my husband doesn't like rice, so I put it over baked potatoes.  Will definitely be making this one again -- thank you!

Very good.  I used this as a base recipe and then made it my own because that's how I like to cook.  I serve this over butter noodles.
