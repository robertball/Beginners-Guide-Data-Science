I thought this was an excellent recipe.  As you can see from my photo, there are a lot of blueberries in this one.  I would reduce the blueberries to 1 cup next time.  The crumb topping is what makes this one a winner.

I made these muffins and was very underwhelmed with the results.  The topping just melted and spilled over the edge and got the muffins all soggy.  The directions needs to say to fill the muffin pans only half way not 3/4.  I will not make these again.

Delicious!  The crumb topping really makes it a step above other recipes.  I made a few without the crumbs for people in case they didn't want the extra sugar, but the first ones snatched up were the wonderful-looking crumb-topped muffins.  This recipe was a hit and I had almost everything on hand.  My only change: too many blueberries in the recipe, I only used about 1 cup, and the muffins were still very moist.  I only baked them for 18 minutes.  Thanks for a winner!

These muffins are fantastic. I didn't have any problems with butter melting into muffins..or burning etc. They came out picture perfect as you can see and just enough blueberries(can never be too much) I did add a little cinnamon and vanilla(two of my favorites)! I didn't read all the reviews until they were happily in the oven and I was a bit freaked out and was a worried I had picked the wrong recipe.
I even made extra crumbles but they came out delicious! I cut them in 1/2 warm and put a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top and they were to die for! Will make again and again!

To reviewer Joeys_girl_73, don't get disheartened--I still have flops after 35 years of baking! The flavor of these muffins was OK--could have benefitted from the addition of vanilla and maybe a little spice in the batter--but the amount of blueberries was too much for the small amount of batter. I wouldn't recommend making larger muffins like I did (I made eight) because they were too moist and turned out more like a blueberry cobbler, in spite of baking for 30 minutes.

These were so heavy and sweet.  I didn't like them at all.  The whole point of blueberry muffins to me is to have sweet berries.  The sweet in this recipe killed the blueberry flavor.  And I don't like cinnamon with blueberries either.

These are very good.  I followed the recipe except that I added buttermilk instead of milk. I always substitute applesauce for the oil in muffins and did so here.  I used equal amounts of applesauce and 1T of oil in place of 1/3 cup oil.  I used frozen blueberries tossed with flour and they worked fine.  I made 9 and they rose beautifully!  I made sure to spray the top of muffin tin so the tops would not stick.  Baked for 30 min (I live at high altitude) and they were beautifully golden brown and crisp on the tops but moist and cake like on the inside.  I would probably add a little more sugar, possibly a 1/4 of a cup, to the batter.  I only put a small amount of the topping on as I wanted to see how they rose.  I will definitely make again but try apple next time.

Tart and moist.  I don't like my pastries too sweet so this was perfect but I can see if you do, then this recipe isn't for you.  I personally liked the 1-1/2 cup blueberries where other reviewers thought that was too much.  It gave it a nice tartness that I prefer.  I will add a pinch of all-spice to give it a little more flavor next time.  Mine only took 20 minutes and they were perfectly done.

I have no idea what I did wrong... I followed the recipe to the T and they came out like burnt stones. The butter from the crumb mixture melted down and burnt the bottoms, the sugar mixure on top melted and burned and cemented itself to the pan... Everything that could have possibly gone wrong did. I will try this recipe again, just because I have never in my life burned anything before this and I am terribly disheartened. Maybe when I make it again, I will nix the crumb topping. In any case, I'm out the blueberries that where ridiculously expensive and a surprise breakfast treat for my boyfriend. :(

These are simply delicious! The perfect amount of sweetness with the crumble on top. Made a double batch for a couple friends who are recent moms and ended up saving a bunch for us because they were too good to part with!

This muffin recipe is absolutley delicious!  My girls ages 4 and 5 gobbled it up.  I did however add 1/2 tsp. of vanilla and used buttermilk in place of the milk.  A little difficult to get out of the muffin tin even after spraying with pam.  Next time I will use muffin liners.

I did enjoy the muffins, but I would say substitute the oil for applesauce.. keeps them moist and they come out amazing. also blueberries I'd say 1cup is PLENTY maybe even over kill! All depends on what you feel is enough, and the batter make sure you taste it before it goes in the oven. I ended up adding a little bit more cinnamon to it, but it all depends on taste!

I just baked the batch of these.  The batter is ok but the topping is not what is crumb really is.  The ingredients for the "crumb" has too much butter and not enough flour hence that is why it sinks..I would use batter again but I would use different recipe or change up the topping like add more flour, cut back on butter add baking powder, baking soda as this would actually "crumb" up even though cutting with a pastry utensil.  I would though change the baking powder  and add baking soda to the batter as it would help it rise more as I filled the muffin tins almost to the brim so I could have a "muffin top".  This recipe is certainly not a crumb kind..its more of a sugary topping at least that sinks as the butter melts and its to heavy for the batter..For future.. I would let the muffins bake for about 12 minutes to set up, then add crumb topping (revised version) so topping won't sink nor melt all the way through.  I would use starbuck's recipe for crumb topping!!

I used this recipe since it didn't require an elctric mixer, and my mixer is on the fritz. First off, the crumb topping melted right off the bat in the oven and the butter went straight to the bottom, seeping through the muffin paper liners and made a mess when you tried to eat one. The overall taste and texture were barely ok. Really underwhelming. I did give this 3 stars since my husband was the only one that liked these. My children and I let him eat them, and I will be looking for a different recipe to use, this one was not even close to what I was hoping for.

So whatever you do, don't follow the crumb topping recipe. First, there are better ones and I have never seen one with so much flour and so much butter. I made my own following another crumb topping recipe which was much better.  I am not sure how those of you following the recipe did not have issues with the topping.  Otherwise, the cupcakes were good.

I hardly ever review but I felt compelled because this crumb topping is not well done.  For a better topping, try this one:

1/8 teaspoon cinnamon
1/3 cup of brown sugar
2 tbls flour

In a small bowl, mix together brown sugar, 2 tablespoons flour and cinnamon. Cut in 1 tablespoon butter until mixture resembles coarse cornmeal. Sprinkle topping over muffins.

Very good!  I only used 1 cup of blueberries.  Added in a package of vanilla instant pudding mix to the dry mix.  They came out lovely in 20 minutes!  Crumb topping was yummy!

i thought this recipe was a good jump-start. i added vanilla and a bit of cinnamon. didn't do the streusel... instead i just sprinkled with white and brown sugar. next time i won't add as much blueberries because the muffin was hard to eat in one piece. otherwise, really delicious and great moist and cakey texture!

Very yummy!  I changed the recipe a bit:  I added only 1/4 cup of oil and added the 1tsp cinnamon to the batter instead of the topping.  For the topping, I used 1/4 cup of flour, 1/3 cup of quick oats, 1/3 cup of brown sugar, and I reduced the butter to 2 tbsp.  Also, I used wild blueberries, which are smaller than regular blueberries, and I added some raspberries to make the 1 1/2 cups of berries.  I'll definitely be making this recipe again!

I followed everyone's comments and added 1/4 cup of oats to the crumble, a 1/4 tsp of vanilla extra to the mix for flavor, and filled a little less than 3/4ths and baked it 18 minutes. Turned out excellent! Thank you all again for your comments.

I tried this recipe this morning..for breakfast. I left out the crumb topping because I needed to get it done quick so that my hubby could eat them before he left for work. As per other reviewers' suggestions I added 1 tsp of vanilla and a 1/4 tsp of cinnamon to the batter to spice it up a notch. I also added only  1 Cup of blue berries instead of 1.5 Cups. I did find that the batter was way too thick for my liking so I added a bit more milk to thin it out. I baked for 30 mins in the convection oven and overall I am pleased with the result. I will definitely make these again.

This recipe turned out wonderfully with a little tweaking.  I added 1/4 tsp Cinnamon and 1 tsp vanilla to the batter.  I also had to add a little more milk to thin out the batter.  I also added cinnamon to the topping as well as additional flour and sugar to get the right crummy consistency.  After these changes, they came out excellent and I was very pleased!

Just OK but, of course, we still ate them!  They were just around a little longer.  I made this and decided that I didn't like the oil flavor.  Also all I had was skim milk so I'm sure that didn't help.  The topping was not so crumbly, more like paste.  Next time I won't use oil and I'll use the topping recipe from the Banana Crumb Muffin recipe which was MUCH more crumbly.  I think it called for alot less butter for the topping.  I'll try this again sometime with the changes noted.

Surprisingly good muffins - I had some doubts as the recipe uses oil instead of butter. They taste just as rich, light, and fluffy as the butter versions of blueberry muffins. I did use a little less blueberries than the recipe called for - next time I might coat the blueberries in flour as the batter turned purple, but they were no less delicious. I'd also cut down on the crumb topping as there was way too much - the topping probably needed a little less butter as it was more moist than crumbly. Overall fantastic recipe and it's my new favorite for blueberry muffins.

Frozen berries. That's the key to making these muffins pop. The berries don't break and it cools the batter and it's easier to pour. I make these for my co-workers and they fight over them, I usually make 24 mini muffins.

Was in a hurry so I made it without the crumb topping. Rated it an optimistic four stars since I'm sure it's better with the topping, but without the recipe lacks any pizazz.

I'm a first timer and this looked like an easy starting point for blue berry muffins. I kept to the recipe for the most part and only adjust it a little bit after reading many reviews. I substituted half and half for the milk, added fresh lemon zest, cinnamon and vanilla. I also adjusted the crumble: 1/8 cinnamon, 1/3 brown sugar and 2 Tbls of flour. Mix dry ingredients then cut in 1 TBl of butter, mix all till it resembles cornmeal. It make more than I needed and was a lovely addition.

The only thing that I changed was I used 1/2 Whole Wheat Flour & 1/2 White All-Purpose Flour for the batter. The only grievance I have is, it says to fill the cups 2/3 way full unless you want a larger muffin top--well, there's not enough batter. Needs a tiny bit of adjusting, otherwise, turned out great!

I was kind of disappointed in this muffin. I had picked fresh berries that were on the tart side, so I thought, "crumb muffins!" I was imagining a soft, fluffy muffin with a beautiful peak, covered with a crumbly sweet topping. The muffins baked up with flat tops, and the "crumb" baked right down into the muffins. Some of them look like volcanoes.

Taste good. Used buttermilk instead of regular milk. Crumb topping needs some work. Some vanilla couldn't hurt either.

These blueberry muffins are the best! They absolutely disappeared. I used frozen blueberries and maybe even a smidgen more than the cup and a half called for and they were perfect. We all loved the crumb topping. It wasn't your run-of-the-mill finish as it had a nice little caramel flavor. These would be good with raspberries too. I'm happy to have found a great recipe for blueberry muffins to replace the store bought option with excess fat, sugar, and chemicals for preservation.Thank you for sharing.

I have to agree with the reviewer who was disappointed that the crumb topping made a mess.  Mine ran all over the pan.  There wasn't much crumb left, just a kind of glaze.  I'll look for another crumb topping for my next try.

I used this recipe for the larger muffins that are 6 to a pan.  That crumb topping is sooo good!  When I first tried the muffin I didn't think it was sweet enough.  It tasted like all the sweetness was in the topping.  Once it had time to really cool and set, the cake had the perfect sweetness for the insanely sweet topping - did I mention just how good it is? ;)  I did what others suggested and used only 1 cup of blueberries and it was a good ratio.  The only other thing I did was split the flour to 1 cup all-purpose flour and the 1/3 cup to whole wheat white flour.  I'll definately make these again.

These were OK...not the greatest.  The crumb topping melted all over the place.  Maybe it would be better to add this later in the baking process or something.  So...not very crumbly.  Also they are very plain, they could use some vanilla or cinnamon or something in the batter itself to give them more flavor.

This recipe was out of this world.  I added 1/2 a cup of chocolate chips.  Today I am going to try a lighter version with splenda in the base mix and wheat flour.  This should be exciting.

I'm giving it 4 stars because I must have done something wrong.  The crumb part sunk to the bottom and made the bottoms mushy.  I made them for dessert but called them "Blueberry Upside Down Muffins" cause we inverted them onto the plate.  Next time I'll dot the crumb part around instead of 1 blob.

I am NOT good at baking & I had to make some muffins for my son's class on his birthday. This recipe was fabulous- the best muffins I ever made. It was very simple and the crumb topping was so yummy. I substituted 2 T of yogurt for each egg called for since we don't eat eggs. The muffins were very soft and moist and were loved by all. Going to make them again next week. The serving size was exact too, I typed in quanity of 48 and got exactly 48!

I thought I followed the recipe, but I made an entirely different recipe. I don't know if I mixed the topping ingredients for too long or what, but it sank to the middle of the muffins. I cooked them for 18 minutes and they came out looking great. I will try this again and try adjusting the topping step. I am also going to make these again as I did the first time, but use minced apples in place of the blueberrys. The "filling" will be awesome with apples. I'm drooling already. lol

Excellent.  I had only one cup of blueberries and so added a handful of walnuts.  I don't think the muffins needed the added nuts as my berries were quite large.  I think one cup is sufficent unless you really love blueberries.  All in all I found this to be a very good muffin recipe.

These were very good.  The only thing I did was broil them for a few minutes till they browned on top to make the topping a little crunchy.  My sons love them.

This was very good, I would agree that there are WAY too many blueberries.  If I make this again I will most likely cut the amount of blueberries in half.

These muffins are absolutely WONDERFUL!!! The crumb topping didn't turn out crumbly, it did melt, however, this gave it a wonderful cinnamon flavor.  They are moist and delicious!  I will make these again for sure!

By far the best BEST blueberry muffins EVER! It was a big hit at our team fundraiser. ESPECIALLY the crumbs at the top! but the big bummer was well... i turned them blue but that was my fault. 

great recipe!

Fantastic! VERY popular at Easter brunch this year - they went within 5 minutes of taking them out of the oven. Moist and sweet, they're delicious. Easy recipe too.

I have tried a lot of blueberry muffin recipes to use some of the berries that we grow.  Until now, all were dry and bland.  These muffins are great.
