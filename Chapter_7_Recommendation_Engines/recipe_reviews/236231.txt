This is a great soup that is super easy to make in a pinch! Plus, you can easily build upon it if you'd like to add more flavor or spices. I increased the recipe because I needed more servings. I saut√©ed an onion in olive oil and added some cumin in my soup pot before adding the mashed beans mixture. After the soup was done, I used an immersion blender to blend the soup up just a bit (not too much because I didn't want super creamy soup). I also added some spicy organic chipotle chicken sausage (that I grilled ahead of time) to the soup along with the cilantro, cheddar cheese and sour cream toppings! My Hubby loved it!

This is great for a quick easy meal on a cool night when you don't really feel like cooking. It was enough to fill my big soup mug, if my husband was home, I'd double the recipe. I did use my own homemade chunky salsa and vegetable broth, chicken broth would work fine in this also. Dinner ready in twenty minutes with no fuss, doesn't get much easier.
