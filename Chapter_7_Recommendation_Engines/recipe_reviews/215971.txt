This was awesome. My family loved it. I made it exactly as described and it turned out wonderful. It refrigerates well and made a great lunch/dinner. Thanks!

ThIs was really good.  I did add a bit more sauce, and did double the recipe for my family of five, and had only a little bit of leftovers.  Everyone had seconds!

This was bland, but very cheesy and filling. I did not like the pie crust. Next time, I think I'll leave it out and add more spices.
