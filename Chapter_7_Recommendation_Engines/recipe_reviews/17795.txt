I was curious how the celery soup would make this recipe, it added a nice touch.  I added chicken and mushrooms. Then omitted the shrimp, carrots and celery.
After tasting the mixed wet ingredients, I added a lot more than 2-3 tbsp of curry and some tumeric.  Served over basmati rice.
Not authentic Indian food, but still pretty good on a weekday night.  I'd make it again.

This was a great base! I added/substituted a few things. I omitted the carrots since my family isn't a big fan, but added 3 cloves of garlic. I also didn't have any coconut milk on hand, so I added about 1/4 cup of honey for the hint of sweetness, and two drops of hot sauce for some zing. It was really wonderful and so easy! I had all of the ingredients right in my cabinets! Thanks for a great new favorite!

My husband and I really like this recipe.  We did use about 3 times as much curry powder and we added more vegetables than it calls for.  We also added a touch of cayenne pepper to spice it up a little more.  We've made it several times.  This makes TONS, so if you don't want a lot leftover cut it in half.

Very delicious, I had most products on hand so it worked nicely. Easy to make and easy cleanup as well.  Thanks

I made half the recipe and that alone gave about  6 to 8 generous portions.  The recipe is very creamy and tasty but you do need more curry powder.  I used 3 tablespoons of extra hot curry powder bought at an Indian Store and that was just about right.   Certainly not an authentic curry but very good nevertheless.   I will probably make it again but use chicken next time.

This was yummy but there was no way for me to fit all the liquid suggested for 5 servings. I just did 1 of each except for the canned milk. Added brown sugar for some sweetness. Served with noodles but tasted so much better with rice. Delilah!

Really great recipe, but I made a few adjustments.  I didn't have coconut milk or cream of celery, so I made a smaller batch with a bit of coconut oil and honey.  I also added some garlic and ginger to the vegetables for extra flavor, and fried the curry powder in some olive oil for a few minutes before adding it.  It worked well over rice, or just on it's own.

This is a great, easy recipe! Like the other reviewers, I added extra curry powder. I also put in some garlic and extra vegetables. Peas went well in it.
