I made it as written with the exception that I used prepared horseradish instead of fresh (at the same amount) and white wine vinegar instead of rice wine vinegar because it's what I had. It was a big hit. It looked great on the plate and tasted delicious.

Excellent.  I thought restaurant quality but I made it all separate so my husband would try it (he is not a tomato fan).
Separate the flavors were not good - together it blended perfectly.  I did make substitutions, New York (it was cheaper this week than top sirloin and Greek yogurt that I had on hand.)  Served with simple mashed potatoes and green beans  and it helped to have the horseradish stand out.

What a great recipe. The simple and easy to make recipe balances the sweetness of the tomatoes with the acidity of the vinegar to highlight A great cut of meat. As several of the other reviews I did not have fresh horseradish and had to use prepared horseradish but it worked out quite well. I also used a large amount of salt pepper and Cayenne pepper which only added to the flavor instead of overpowering the steak itself.

Surprised at so many good reviews. Neither my spouse or I enjoyed. Followed recipe. Found cayenne too much. Tomatoes needed something more.First Chef John disappointment.

We loved this recipe. It was so simple yet very flavorful. Like some others, I used prepared horseradish because I didnâ€™t have fresh in the house. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. An absolute keeper.

Excellent!  Minor change - instead of the creme  fraiche, I used lactose free milk with melted butter mixed in.  I also doubled the amount for more sauce.  After removing the steaks from the pan, I added a little hot water to scrape up the bits and then added the milk mixture in.  Added a little bit of flour to thicken into a sauce.

Pretty good. Quick and easy. Cutting the tomatoes took the longest.

Excellent made exactly as written. Easy and cheap (with one change). The fresh horseradish was good but not spicy enough for us. We added prepared horseradish. And the creme fraiche was also good but pricey at my store. I think sour cream or Greek yogurt would have also been great and a lot cheaper.

When my husband came to the table to eat he said he kind of wanted to go out to eat. By the time he finished this dish he said, " this was better than going out! It was different from how I have ever served meat before but was so delicious! Love the videos along with the recipe! I could' get fresh horseradish so used prepared and it worked great. Can't wait to make this again!

This is one of my favorite meals. Followed the recipe as written. Left overs make a great meal for the next day. Thanks Chef John.
