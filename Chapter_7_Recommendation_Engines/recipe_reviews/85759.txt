This was tasty, and easy to make. I cant say that this was a dish I couldn't stop eating, I rate it good, but not the best.I can say that the photo shown did not match the recipe exactly. I think the photo shows garbanzo beans? This was a nice change.

****Ive change this to 5 stars instead of 4******
Reason being.... I let it sit over night, and it really made a difference in the taste, and I think this is one of my favorite side items now.

This is a classic recipe! I also grew up in Massachusetts and have had this at many different restaurants around town.  I even see it at the local grocery stores now-a-days labeled as Boston Bean Dip.  When I make it, I like to put about 1/2 the beans into a food processor to smooth out the consistency.  Very yummy!

This makes a ton, but you can cut the recipe down. Try this once and you will get hooked!

Scaled it down to 3 servings and used 2 cans of beans.  Unfortunately (or fortunately), I only had 1 can of kidney beans and 1 can of garbanzo beans.  Let it sit overnight and had some as a salad for lunch.  Fantastic!  I will try it with crackers as an appetizer, but it was real yummy!

Thank you so much for this recipe. I also grew up in New England and this bean relish was served at a local Scituate restaurant. I started thinking about it and couldn't get it out of my head and then I saw this recepe and said...THATS IT!!! Yeah, It's so good and easy. My favorite is served with good old ritz style crackers. Thanks again, Mary

I cut this recipe in half and it still made a ton.  Keeping to the recipe, I refrigerated it for a couple of hours before giving it a try.  It tasted pretty boring at that point, but the next day...!   It was a completely changed dish!  The directions should read, "Refrigerate overnight."  This recipe is a keeper.

Thank you Kathy!  What a find for me. I live in Massachusetts and when I go out to dinner I eat so much of the relish the tray needs to be refilled.  Now I can have it at home.  Since there are just the two of us I had to change the the amounts and it was a little too moist-I think I should have drained my relish more carefully.

This is amazing! I didn't have dry mustard, so I just used a little of the real thing (sorry if this is a no-no in the New England version--if so, forgive me, I'm from Illinois!). The mustard and sweet relish give such a great flavor to this dish. The nice thing about this dish is that it's one of those that doesn't really require measuring--just add ingredients to taste. I used dried beans to cut back on the sodium a little, and mashed them up just a little. We ate it with Wheat Thin crackers. Delicious!

Addictive! I did not have white pepper, but otherwise followed the recipe. I did lightly smash the beans with a fork, though.

SO EZ & DELICIOUS--I MADE THIS CHRISTMAS MORN, JUST AS AN EXTRA FOR THE ALWAYS HUNGREY MEN--IT WAS SO QUICK TO PUT TOGETHER, VERY TASTY. ADDED FEW SPLASHES OF HOT SAUCE, BUT ONLY BECAUSE WE ARE IN THE SOUTH, IT'S NOT NECESSARY. OH,ALSO EXCHANED SOME OF THE RED BEANS WITH GAZ'POs (as other reviewers suggested) FOR APPEARANCE & VARIETY. IF ANY IS LEFT, MAKES A GREAT SIDE TO DINNER NEXT DAY. REALLY ENJOYED-THANKS SO MUCH FOR SHARING %)

I scaled this recipe down to use one can of beans. I didn't have dry mustard so I subbed wasabi powder (1/4 tsp.) I used 1/4 c. mayo and 3 T. relish and a dash of granulated garlic in lieu of the garlic. I added white pepper and a ground pepper medley. I mixed everything together and let it sit in the fridge overnight; delicious! I wish I would have made more since everyone loved it. It reminded me of my Dad's homemade ham salad replacing the ham with beans. We prefered serving this over Ritz crackers which adds a buttery dimension to this recipe. Next time I will definitely make more and drain the pickle relish and perhaps add some white beans if I don't have several cans of the kidney beans. Thanks for sharing!

Can't say, I totally liked this. I have to say. I scaled the recipe down to 2 cans, made it to a T for all measurements. And it was very runny and very very pickly tasting. Even tasting the beans, the relish totally over whelmed th taste buds. Don't get me wrong, I know it's a BEAN relish. But the underdog in this recipe is the beans. I ended up adding a 3rd can to accomendate the runny-ness of the mayo and relish...it helped. Not sure if I'd make this again. It just didn't do it for me. Sorry.

I didn't really care for this, but I think that it is one of those tastes taht you either love or don't love. The predominate taste was the sweet relish. I scaled the recipe back to use 2 cans of kidney beans.

Delicious. I've never been to New England (hopefully someday!), but we always had kidney bean salad along with potato salad & macaroni salad at every BBQ. This recipe is the same that I had growing up, with the addition of garlic. I can't believe that this recipe calls for SEVEN 16-oz cans of beans for 10 servings. No wonder we are such a heavy nation. I made my version with fat-free mayo. I made no other changes. It is so good. If you find fat-free mayo a bit too sweet, add a splash of vinegar.

In Indiana, we call this recipe kidney bean salad.  The recipe sounded great as it was, but it was late when I made it and I wanted to be sure it was made in time to sit in the fridge overnight.  So, since I didn't have white pepper, I used black.  I had only 4 cans of kidney beans, so I added a couple cans of garbonzo beans.  I also added 1/2 cup of finely chopped celery just for the crunch.  After tasting, I added a bit more black pepper.  I had a cupful for breakfast this morning and it is excellent!  I can hardly wait for my husband to taste it!  Next time, I'll double the amounts of onion and celery simply because we like onion and celery.  This will be so good for summer cook outs!

Mira, a sweet relish is a sweet pickle relish found in the condiment aisle of your grocer.  Hope this helps.

Very tasty and works well as a side dish or as a snack.  I tried to half the recipe using three cans of beans and one cup of mayo and sweet relish.  I should have used 3/4 cup for both as it turned out too  soupy.  But it still tasted great.

Used 2 cans of beans. Added chopped red and yellow peppers, gr. onion, red onion, garlic, relish and brown
mustard seeds. Used 1/4c Latin mayo w/reg low fat mayo. It was probably more like a salad than relish but it was delicious. Used smoked salt and pepper. Much better if it sits at least  5 hrs or more.

I just made this with White Cannellini Beans(white kidney beans) because thats what I had in my pantry. I followed the rest of the recipe and added fresh chopped parsley, a little cumin and a pinch of cayenne pepper. Turned out great! cant wait for dinner to eat with turkey burgers. I think I might try with black beans, corn and cilantro. If you use a light mayonnaise and cut down on the relish, this will be less calories than shown.

I reduced it using  2 cans of beans, rinsed and drained,  and used red pepper relish, also well drained.  Another recipe I had for this called for a spoonful of white horseradish, so I added that.  Also, let the flavors mingle overnight tightly covered.  It is a heavy concoction so I find original Triscuits are sturdiest.

Not too bad...I wouldn't crave this, but I'd put it on my plate if I saw it.

We always added chopped boiled eat to this and some celery.  Great with Easter ham dinner!
