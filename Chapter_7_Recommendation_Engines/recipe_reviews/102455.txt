First of all, this was really salty! Secondly, I felt there was too much lemon zest. I won't make this again, but I enjoyed trying it.

Delicious. Will make again. A nice, cool dish in summer. Ate with pretzel crackers.

I did not think it was too salty. Too salty could be caused by the salmon (if the person who smoked it left it sitting in the brine too long, it gets too salty), the capers (if concerned, rinse them before use to totally get rid of salt brine), or the chips/crackers you're eating the stuff on. But for what it's worth, I didn't rinse the capers and I used salted crackers, so if you find it too salty I'd probably point the finger at your smoked salmon.

It was meh and salty. I used it with BBQ Kettle chips. I highly recommend making this earlier enough to give the flavors time to meld. It was definately better the next day.

Excellent! Just added a bit of cilantro. Everything else worked perfectly as described.
