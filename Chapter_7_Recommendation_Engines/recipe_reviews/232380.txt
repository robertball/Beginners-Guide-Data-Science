Only deviation from the recipe was sprinkling a handful of chopped peanuts on the top of the batter before it went into the oven.  Texture was more cake-like rather than traditional bread-like, but plenty moist and tasty.  Only one criticism...it was very crumbly and difficult to slice; we ended up eating it with a fork.  Both the peanut butter and the banana flavors come through, with not one dominating the other.*****UPDATE 4.23.13******The slicing issue may have been a result of the bread not cooled "completely" because it sliced just fine this morning (guess we were a little too eager to test it out).

I used melted butter instead of shortening and I threw in a half cup or so of mini chocolate chips. I made muffins out of this instead of one big loaf--I got 12 medium sized muffins out of one recipe. Baked at 350*, they were done at just over twenty minutes. Everyone loved this banana bread, we had over half gone for breakfast and the remaining muffins were gone by the end of the day.

I made these as muffins with 3/4 cup of mini chocolate chips. Tasted great! I didn't have buttermilk so I used three tablespoons of yogurt and one tablespoon of milk and mixed it together. I used butter instead of shortening. I also used two normal sized bananas to keep them moist and one teaspoon of vanilla. They filled the muffin hole to the top so I cooked them for 24 minutes at 350.

The second time I made these, I used applesauce instead of butter, added a teaspoon of cinnamon and half a teaspoon of nutmeg and cooked them for 20 minutes at 350.  They were perfect!

I love this recipe! I am picky about my banana breads too, had to try this one because of the peanut butter, so glad I did! ! went with 1/2 Whole wheat & 1/2 White flour, used butter instead of shortening, a little bit more banana, and a hair less sugar than called for.
Excellent! Don't know why another reviewer said she couldn't taste the banana or the peanut better very strongly, I found both the flavors very robust & well balanced in this recipe! Everyone I shared it will loved it, I have 2 more loaves in the oven now!

Very nice.  Family LOVED these as muffins topped w Peanut Butter and Banana Frosting from this site.  I used egg white substitute for the eggs (no one ever notices, so if you're watching calories in baking it's a great sub) and used sour milk instead of buttermilk, and otherwise left everything the same.  I filled the muffin tins about 3/4 full and still got 16 rounded muffins out of this recipe.  The muffins were done at about 25 minutes.  They didn't brown much as muffins, though, so if I hadn't topped with frosting I'd suggest a topping of peanuts or something before going in  the oven for visual appeal.  As another reviewer commented, this results in a  pretty smooth result, so if you like some fruit or nuts added into your bread/muffins I'd suggest using chunky peanut butter and/or adding in some dried fruit.  Really, though, if you love banana bread and you love peanut butter, you will more than likely enjoy this recipe.  Both are noticeable in this.  Thanks for the recipe!

Made this peanut butter banana bread recipe, but made them as mini muffins since it was for a bunch of kids.  I did make a couple changes, though. I swapped out the shortening with softened butter and use sour cream instead of butter milk since I didn’t have either on hand.  Kids loved these. I had a little batter left after making 3 dozen mini muffins, so added a handful of chocolate chips just to see how the flavor would come out. Loved them!!  Glad I saved these just for me! I got the chocolate flavor, but still a good balance with peanut butter and banana.

Made this today! Easily doubled the recipe. Loved the texture of the dough! I think next time I will either use chunky pb or add chopped peanuts to it and maybe some mini chocolate chips. Yum yum! Kids loved it! Great after-school snack!

Delicious.. I made it exactly as written, and it baked in precisely one hour. Perfect consistency, moist in the middle with a hard, crunchy top and you could really taste the peanut butter. I had been searching for a peanut butter muffin recipe for a long time, to no avail, so having found this recipe, it will take the place of the peanut butter muffins I was searching for.

Excellent! Used butter, not shortening and also white whole wheat flour. Added some mini chic chips.  I also did 12 good size muffins (not a loaf of bread) baked for about 25 mins @ 350.

I used 1 c. of all purpose flour and 3/4 c. of whole wheat flour. I used 1 c of chunky peanut butter ((rather than the 3/4 mentioned in the recipe) Recipe didn't specify which type to use, so I used my favorite.  I also changed the sugar to 1/2 c. white sugar and the remainder in Demerara sugar.  Also sprinkled a little Turbonino sugar on the top for a little crunch. I added 3/4 c of chopped walnuts and 1/4  dark chocolate chips.    (Side Note) I really don't like to change a person's recipe and rarely do so, but today I was trying to recreate a recipe I had for years and somehow I can not find it. (:  Not sure I mentioned I also added more bananas to 1 1/2 c.

I really enjoyed this banana bread and will make it again. I made a few changes just based on what I had on hand and trying to keep it lower sugar. Instead of the 1/3 shortening, I used some shortening, butter, and oil adding up to 1/3 total in my measuring cup. Also I used unsweetened peanut butter and added 3 tbsp of both white sugar and powdered sugar instead of the amount of white sugar suggested. It still turned out great and not too sweet. Thank you for the recipe :)

I made one loaf as the recipe called for and then made a second batch, but substituted the banana for cinnamon applesauce and made it in a brownie pan.  Tasted great both ways!!

I substituted butter for the shortening. Aside from that, no other changes. We did not like the flavor of the bread. It was odd tasting and we ended up throwing it out. I will not be making this again.

Great recipe! It made 15 good sized muffins (baked at 350 for 25 minutes). I added chocolate chips and used coconut oil since there was no shortening in the house.

Loved it. I found the flavor to be very pleasing and it made a large loaf. I expect it will taste even better tomorrow.

Yummy.  I  used Planter's NUTtrition Banana granola peanut butter.  It was more banana with a subtler peanut butter flavor (which I expected since I didn't adjust the amount of banana I put in), although very good. Next time I will make it with a regular crunchy peanut butter to balance out the flavors better and give some texture to the finished product.  I doubled the recipe, yielding  8 jumbo muffins (baked for approx 45mins)  and 2 mini-loaves (approx 30 mins).doubling the recipe.

I found it to be very dry and I couldn't really taste the peanut butter. The only alterations I made was to use butter in place of the shortening and we added mini choco chips. Maybe I'll make a peanut butter frosting to put on it.

I love peanut butter and bananas together.  The best snack is a peanut butter and banana sandwich. When I saw this recipe, I knew I had to try it right away. It turned out very good; however, I thought that it would taste better than it did. I couldn’t really tell there was peanut butter in it. It has much more of a banana taste than I expected. I think maybe next time I will try to had peanut butter without making the batter to thick. I didn’t have a loaf pan so I used a 7 by 11 baking dish. I had enough batter to fill up the entire backing dish. I would suggest using two loaf pans when making this recipe because you will easily have enough batter. I found the bread to be incredibly dense and a little bit dry. My mom suggested adding banana pudding to the batter to make it denser. However, by doing that you will also be taking away more of the peanut butter tastes. All-in-all, this is a good recipe for peanut butter banana bread. My fiancée asked if next time we make it to add chocolate chips to make peanut butter chocolate chip banana bread.

This recipe uses buttermilk which is new for me in a quick bread. I used a peanut butter that had chocolate, honey, and bananas included. I didn't have mini chocolate chips, so I used the regular sized milk chocolate chips. I added 1 teaspoon hazelnut extract. It turned out good, but I will continue to tinker with it.

We liked it okay but can't say I'd make it again just as written. It's very smooth and moist, but it's almost too smooth. I put some chopped peanuts on top and wished I had put them in the batter or even had used chunky peanut butter. I think Sarah Jo is right-- it would almost be better as muffins instead of a loaf of bread, and adding mini chocolate chips would make it a 5 star recipe.

I cut the sugar by half, used whole wheat flour and 2 egg whites but everybody loved it at home. Excellent recipe!!
