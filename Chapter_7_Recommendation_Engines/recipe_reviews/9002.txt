Excellent recipe! I added sesame seeds about 1TBl. in second step. After,I took the wings out of the sauce and put them on a cookie sheet lined with foil and a couple of Tbl. of the sauce and let them crisp at 450 degrees for 15 min. Then I thicken the sauce. With 1 cup of the sauce and 2 Tbl.of cornstach whisked well and put the constarch mixture into the pan of sauce and returned the baked wings to the sauce for 3-5 mins. on medium heat. Wow! this was delicious over white rice! Enjoy

These chicken wings were delicious -- even my husband loved them and he's not a chicken wing fan! The name of the recipe is slightly deceptive -- usually wings have a dry quality to them, but these were stewy. I made a few modifications which made a big difference: add much more garlic (2 Tbsp minced), ginger (1 tbsp minced), hot sauce (sweet Korean red pepper paste, 1 Tbsp), 1 Tbsp brown sugar, 1 Tbsp vinegar, 1/2 cup chopped cilantro (coriander leaves). These had to cook way longer than 15 minutes for me, more like 40 minutes. Then, to dry them out, I placed them in 1 layer in a casserole dish and baked them at 200 for half an hour. Fantastic with steamed rice and broccoli  : )

These were excellent.  If you have the time, let the wings sit in the soy sauce, garlic and green onions, before adding the water.  This allows them to absorb the soy sauce flavor.

Wow! These were awesome! There is a special place in my heart for sesame oil and now I know why.  So aromatic, so full of flavor, so wonderful!  I did take one person's suggestion and put some toasted sesame seeds on them and thickened the sauce with 1 TBSP of cornstarch and 1/4 cup water and poured it over the rice we served with the wings.  Great recipe.  Sure to impress anyone.

This is THE BEST wing receipe I've ever tried and it's SO easy to do!  If you like Sesame Oil you'd be crazy not to try it!  For variety and looks, I added Sesame seeds in the second step.

My very picky husband thought these wings were delicious.  I simmered the ribs in the soy sauce for 15 minutes and then followed someone's suggestion of sprinkling them with sesame oil and baking at 450 for 15 minutes.  They were crisp and perfect.  I served them with rice and carrots.  Yummmmm

Absolutely delightful! I followed some of the suggestions to bake it in the oven on a foil-lined cookie sheet for 15 mins. at 450F degrees.  I also thickened the sauce with 1 C water and 1 Tbsp corn starch.  After the baking time, I put the chicken back in the pan and let it simmer in the thick sauce for 15 minutes.  I served it with rice and Pan Fried Asparagus (found here in AllRecipes, too.) and it was a quick and huge hit with the family!  Thanks Joshua for sharing this recipe!

I made the recipe exactly as stated.  I felt the saltiness of the soy overpowered all the other flavors.  After trying it as is, I put toasted sesame seeds on top and that helped alittle but not enough.  I am glad I tried it but will not be making it again.

better than Hooters

Marinaded the wings in the sauce for 2 hours(longer the better) then baked for 40 minutes at 400F. Then with the leftover marinade boiled down to a thick syrup and poured on top of the wings.

Super easy to make, and both of my children loved it! It is not often that both of my kids like the same thing.  The only change I did was after it cooked on the stove I tossed it on the grill for a couple of minutes to crisp it up a bit.  Serve it with rice and some mixed Chinese style veggies and you got yourself a meal!

I loved these wings!!  I wish there was a 4.5, because I feel it's not quite a 5, but very good.  I crisped them in the oven at 450, and I doubled the recipe because 2 pounds of wings isn't very many.  Then I used the sauce left in the skillet for some fried rice to go with it. I'm a salt lover, and this was a bit salty, so if you don't like salt, use all low sodium soy sauce.

These "Sesame Oil Chicken Wings" are so tasty! They are quick and easy to prepare to boot! I substituted the light and dark soy sauces (15 tablespoons almost equals 1 cup) with 3/4 cup of LOW-SODIUM gluten-free tamari; however, my change (not the recipe) resulted in slightly salty wings. The next time I make this I will use only 1/2 cup of low-sodium gluten-free tamari to replace the soy sauce. I will also get the butcher to split my chicken wings. Thank you GAN55 for sharing your recipe.

This was really good, and SUPER EASY! I only made a half recipe to see how we would like them. (10 wing pieces) The water and soy and garlic reduced to at least half, and I turned the pieces 1/2 way thru the first 15 min., since they weren't covered. Then discovered I only HAD about 1 TBSP. sesame oil! So I put the chicken on baking sheet w/ alum. foil and sprinkled my sesame oil on the pieces and baked at 450 for 15 minutes. So--total cooking time was half an hour. Wings were moist and tender. Tried rolling a  couple in the sauce, but it was too strong, I thought. Dribbled some of the thickened (w/cornstarch) sauce on the rice, but still strong to me, so I switched to buttered rice with a side salad of romaine & Olive Garden house (yum!)dressing. PERFECT with this meal!

I thought these were great - the man didn't like them so much.  I thought they were great - tender with just the right amount of sweetness.  Next time I may add some peanut oil.  I served these with rice and asian noodles with duck sauce - thanks!

This was really good. I used chicken thighs and seasoned with garlic powder, Mrs. Dash original, a teaspoon of cayenne, and black pepper.  I used a cup of low sodium soy sauce and diced half a large white onion.  I used about 15 dashes of seasme oil and half a cup of water.  cooked stovetop 30 mins,, then placed chicken in oven with a bit of sauce, to crisp for 15 mins. Deglazed remaining sauce with water, and served over buttered rice. Delicious! Will make again.

I made this and it was good, but a little too salty for me.  I was looking for something with a little sweetness, but decided to try this instead.  I will make this again and add rice and vegetables for a dinner.  Easy to make.

Last night I followed this recipe in a single skillet on my stove to produce an excellent dish of chicken wings: my children loved it (5*), which is really what counts. Why I chose this wings recipe over others is that most of the others involve ovens and crispy skins, which is not what I was looking for this time. What I like about this recipe is it is easy to prepare and cooks quite quickly. And of course, that the dish was extremely well received.

In the interests of improvement - not that its necessary but just to suggest:

(1) When I make this again I might cut the amount of sesame oil in half, then the next time leave it out all together. I don't think this will improve the taste of the dish BUT it will come across healthier to me. The experimentation would be to find if cutting the oil out diminishes the dish to an unacceptable level.

(2) I would really like to have an extension of this recipe so as to do something with the stock that is left - make a sauce? freeze and reuse? something. Since last night I have found one suggestion for a sauce right here among the reviews. I would welcome other suggestions. 

In conclusion I commend this dish to you. I would encourage you to try it and leave your feedback.

Excellent. My family loved them. Nice and moist with a little of sweetness to them. I'm going to make them for my next get together.

It was very nice. I used yellow onions & chopped Garlic instead of what was listed & it was amazing. I used wings as well as thighs... Loved the sauce and how soft & succulent the chicken came out. My mom is a picky eater & I got her thumbs up for this recipe. I will definitely make it again and introduce my friends to it. Great over Brown Basmati rice with a side of black eyed peas & veggies.
*i also tried baking the chicken & thickening the sauce like another person in the comments area. 
You can't go wrong with this dish??

I'm kinda meh bout this recipe, on one hand, it tasted okay, but it didn't really have that taste that makes it unique, but still, it's easy to make so I'll prob use it in the future
