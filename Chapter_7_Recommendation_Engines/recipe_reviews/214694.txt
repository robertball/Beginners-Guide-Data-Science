This was a hit with the whole family even without having the cheese to sprinkle on top. I left out the celery since we are not big fans of it but I did add some fresh minced garlic with the onion. I also used fresh mild italian sausage and for those who like things spicier use a spicier sausage. It was a fast meal and served with a salad made a complete meal.

Very tasty - my favorite kind of meal for a cool fall evening! I added fresh garlic to the onion/pepper/celery mix and used whole wheat penne instead of egg noodles because that's what we had on hand. Served it with a fresh green salad - delicious and a hit with the whole family.

Made this for dinner tonight. It was awesome. We all loved it. It's only 3 of us and there is only one helping left. Didn't change a thing. I used fresh veggies out of my garden. Will defiantly make this one again. Thanks for sharing Sandi.

It wasn't horrible tasting but was very bland and lacked anything that made it special.

A nice casserole that I liked but my DH really enjoyed. I saut√©ed the veggies in a little olive oil rather than 3 TB of butter and oil. I had to use an orange bell pepper as that is all I had on hand. I had a package of cooked pulled pork in the freezer that I used in place of the bulk sausage and it worked great. I also had a bag of cooked medium shell pasta that I was wanting to use up so that was in place of the egg noodles. This mixed together very well and the house smell great while it was baking. If I make this again I'm going to up the spices and use fresh garlic in place of the garlic powder. The flavor was very mild and DH spiced his up with Tabasco. The casserole was served with 'Cranberry Salad' and 'School Lunchroom Cafeteria Rolls' both from AR.

This was awesome!!!I used stewed tomatoes as that was the only thing I had on hand.I also used fettuccini as i didnt have any egg noodles...Also no green peppers so I had used the orange yellow and red peppers only...OMG this was so good so knowing I didnt have the green peppers tomatoes and egg noodles I know it would have had the same effect on the meal itself...For my critic of a 17yr son that thinks he is a better cook than me he liked it alot...A keeper!!!

I love the recipe but I think either more cheddar or possibly change the cheese to mozzarella. This also reminds me of goulash so I may choose to only complete the recipe on stove top in the future. Really good as is though!!
