Delicious! Here's a thought for all the negative-nancy types though...If you don't like salt, lemon or garlic--hmmm. Maybe don't TRY a GARLIC LEMON SEA SALT dish?? Just sayin'! ;o)

A subjective matter perhaps, but while hubby and I both love broccoli and eat it often, this was just unpleasant. Bitter and an unappealing color due to roasting, this basically just made our house smell strongly of broccoli.  Very disappointing--maybe we just bought a bad bunch of broccoli.

I can't quit eating these! I had no idea you could cook broccoli this way. It is SO good! Thanks! Update since some found this salty - I never use salt in any recipe (except breadmaker). These are really tasty. If you fear the lemon might be too strong, use less the first time.

Broccoli fixed this way is addicting!  I cut broccoli vertically and use the stalks too.   Toss in bowl, sprinkle w/ montreal seasoning, drizzle w/ olive oil and bake in oven.    You won't be able to stop eating!!!   My fave way to make broccoli.

EXCELLENT!!!! I tossed the broccoli with garlic olive oil, plenty of garlic (we love garlic so I doubled the amount), kosher salt, pepper and a few shakes of crushed red pepper. I covered w/ foil for the 1st 10 min then removed the foil and let cook another 20 min or so tossing the broccoli occasionally. I finished it off with the squeeze of fresh lemon (we used extra). My husband and i loved this so much we made it 3 nights in a row. Make extra!!!
EDIT: In the years since finding this recipe I've made this probably 100 times,we love it that much. I've made it with the broccoli the recipe calls for but we've also made it with asparagus, zucchini and fresh green beans. I've made it in the oven but we also found these veggies turn out fantastic on the grill (we have a grill basket which prevents little pieces from falling thru the grates), the green beans do turn out best on the grill. Its a great way to use up summer veggies and also nice to be abe to do the whole diunner on the grill in the summer and not have to turn on the oven when its hot outside.

This was really good, and so easy. I steamed the broccoli in the microwave, then added garlic powder (generous shake), salt, pepper, and juice of half a lemon. I skipped the olive oil, and it was fine without. It was really delicious, super fast, and very healthy.

Very tasty way to cook broccoli!  I thought it was delicious.  The only very slight negative is that I cut the amount of salt recommended in half and my husband (who likes salt), commented that it was a little salty--although he still loved it!  Next time I might cut the salt a little more.  I used Kosher salt (which I think is the same as sea salt).

Followed recipe exactly and it was way too salty.  I will try again using 1/2 the sea salt. Also will only roast 15 minutes as we prefer a little firmer cooked vegetable.

Excellent dish!  I was skeptical on how little oil was used in the dish, but I stayed with the recipe, and it turned out great.  My husband LOVED it!  Healthy AND delicious.

I have always just steamed broccoli with lemon and butter before, never experimented with roasting, but this is definitely a great way to prepare it! I also like to add a little crushed red pepper with the garlic and oil toss. Yesterday I had no lemon, so I tried a different "acidic flavor" to brighten it up. I made a little balsamic vinegar reduction (reduce 1 c. good balsamic with 1/4 c. sugar and a pinch salt till it gets down to a syrupy 1/3 cup or so). YUMMMMMMM!!!! It was such a treat.  WARNING: DON'T BURN. I think the woman who said this was really bad may have burned hers a little. Burnt broccoli is very unpleasant smelling. The little fluffy green parts of the florets will tend to cook faster, so be vigilant and err on the side of under-cooking.

From the reviews, it seems that people who really enjoy the taste of broccoli don't like this recipe, but people for whom broccoli is just a so-so veggie love it.  Broccoli is not our favorite vegetable, and I'm always looking for ways to make it more interesting, so I decided to give this recipe a try.  We loved it!  More importantly, my two-year-old couldn't stop eating it and asked for THIRDS!  I roasted the broccoli for about 18 minutes, stirring after 15 once the sides touching the pan had browned.  Like others, I significantly cut the amount of salt, and I also doubled the amount of olive oil.  We found the lemon to be a personal preference - I didn't think it needed any; my husband wanted a lot - so next time I will serve it with lemon wedges on the side so people can doctor it to taste, rather than pouring lemon juice over it in the bowl.  Thanks for a great new way to cook broccoli!

Excellent! The seasonings and roasting really brings out the flavour in the broccoli. This whips up so fast, and makes an excellent side-dish. Definitely a new regular on our table!

A refreshing change from steamed broccoli!  I know I will make this over and over again.   I would have rated this 5 stars in a second, but in reading some of the comments, I do wonder if "2 heads broccoli" shouldn't be quantified to some specific measurement as not all broccoli heads are made equal.  I found that 2 teaspoons olive oil wasn't nearly enough to moisten the 2 heads/bunches of broccoli I used.  I increased the olive oil to appx 2 tbsp and tossed the ingredients together in a plastic bag to ensure the broccoli was evenly and very lightly coated.  I think using enough olive oil to lightly coat all the broccoli is important for flavor and so the baking doesn't dry it out.  I must admit I did add a couple more cloves of garlic too.....  For an added tastebud treat in addition to the lemon, I sprinkled with some grated parmesan cheese before serving.   I was tempted to eat a whole plateful!

My FAVORITE way to eat broccoli now!  I agree with the review that said it is "addicting" and I can think of lots worse things to be addicted to!  YUM!  Make sure the broccoli is DRY when tossing it with a small amount of olive oil.  Use fresh garlic, a small amount of freshly ground sea salt and fresh lemon juice...you can't go wrong!  Did I mention...YUM! :)

This recipe was so good! I found it a bit salty the first time around, but it was still totally edible. The second time I halved the salt and it tasted even better. I also tried mixing in some zucchini with the broccoli, and it turned out great!

Fantastic!   So easy and flavorful... I was in a huge hurry and just sprinkled the broccoli with garlic salt and pepper to taste and tossed with a good drizzle of basil flavored olive oil.   I squeezed a few drops of lemon over it when it came out of the oven and it was delicious.  UPDATE--made it without the lemon and sprinkled with a little shredded parmesan. Very good.

Not my favorite broccoli recipe from this site. The broccoli came out almost crispy, and we didn't even leave it in for the full cooking time. I think I liked how it tasted before putting the lemon

Being an avid broccoli lover I was thrilled to find a little different method of preparing one of my favorite veggies.  The roasting turned my beautiful broccoli into a very unappetizing sight but I wasn’t too concerned about aesthetics and dug right in.  For some reason my broccoli had a very strange smell and tasted bitter and dry.  I roasted it for about 12 minutes, less than the recipe called for, but perhaps I roasted a tad too long.

My family is not vegetable friendly, but in an effort to change the trend, I gave this recipe a try.  
We used to eat broccoli only if coated in cheese.  I am proud to say we have had this recipe (exactly as written) once a week for the past four weeks and there are never leftovers.  I even doubled the recipe tonight because the carnivores in this house can't get enough of this!   
Thank you, NerdyCheesecake, you've made us a vegetable loving household.  The recipe is simple enough for a novice like me and tastes fantastic.

I really liked this recipe a lot and followed it exactly.  My only suggestion would be to cut the broccoli into very small pieces otherwise it takes a very long time to cook.  Roasting the broccoli brings out an entirely different flavor of it, and it is a nice alternative to regular steamed broccoli.

I didn't really care for this. It's just my taste I think as there wasn't anything specifically wrong with, the flavour just didn't agree with my taste buds. I love broccoli but this was the first time I've roasted it. I didn' care for the parts that got a bit brown and crunchy and I didn't really like the lemonyness either. I won't make this again but if you like roasted broccoli this might be right up your alley. I'll say that I definitely think it needs more olive oil. I used only 1/2 head of broccoli and still used a bit more than the 2 tsp.

so yum. great way to enjoy broccoli. i particularly enjoy how the roasting process offers even more of a variety in tastes and textures than the vegetable already inherently possesses. i ended up roasting it on the high end of the time suggestion, cause i like the smaller bits coming out a little charred and crispy. i added a dash of essence of emeril, two cloves of garlic, and a minced shallot to this original recipe. and then tossed them with gomasio (sesame seeds and sea salt, i use 'eden organic' brand). so good. my husband and i have recently transitioned to veganism and its versatile recipes with snackable qualities like this one that really help us stay on track and keep things interesting. thanks, nerdycheesecake for this simple, yet 'aha!' moment type recipe. delish.

Not enough oil (I needed 2 tablespoons), way too much salt (I used 1/2 teaspoon and would use 1/4 next time), and definitely not enough lemon juice.  Once the amounts are adjusted though this is a really good recipe :)

very good, but you might try using a large freezer bag to put the brocoli, oil , salt, ect. shake in bag till completly mixed then put on baking sheet, its easier, save a bowl also , dont forget the lemon juice

I really liked this, and my toddler ate it too, though she said it was spicy. (I think I may have put too much pepper on it.) I roasted for the minimum time because it looked and smelled done, but it was still pretty firm. I'll probably leave it in for the full 20 minutes next time. I also reduced the sea salt and increased the garlic, but not my a whole lot.

There's gotta be a step missing here. Broccoli tops were burnt after 15 mins, and the stims were still raw. Not much flavor either. Tastes like burnt broccoli.

Tasty! I was cooking something else at 375 so I stuck it in there and cooked it for about 25 minutes. The broccoli did burn a bit but it still tasted good! This was a bit salty for my taste, and I really like salt so that's saying something! I forgot to put the lemon on at the end but it was still good...who knows though, the lemon could have kicked this up another notch! Will try that next time.

I did not like this at all. I agree with a previous reviewer, if you like the taste of broccoli, you will not like this recipe. It tastes nothing like broccoli and ends up with a weird texture.

Our family loves broccoli but this wasn't for us.  The broccoli tasted strange, slightly acidic for some reason, and it was fresh.  I usually just blanche for a minute in heavily salted boiling water, keeps things tender with a little crunch but wanted to try something new.  Think I'll just stick with that.

This is definitely a good option for broccoli but we didn't love it. The lemon juice gave it a huge kick so I think next time I'll back down on it a bit.

Ugghhn I must have used tiny heads of broccoli, this had WAY to much salt, pepper, and garlic! I tried to rinse the broccoli off but it was still too much.  Next time ill half the dry ingredients as the amount of oil was perfect.

At first I thought I wouldn't like these.  They smelled very strong and I tasted a bite right after adding lemon juice and the flavor was unpleasant.  I let them sit while I finished preparing the rest of the meal.  By the time we sat down to eat maybe 10 minutes later, the broccoli was delicious!  I think the lemon juice had somewhat gone to the bottom of the dish by then.  Next time I will use very little lemon juice.

Simple, fun, delicious and healthy way to cook your broccoli.  There were no leftovers.  The second time I used this recipe, I had a head of fresh cauliflower that needed to be used.  I prepared it the same way and it was fabulous, and I'm sure there are other veggies this method would work well for also :)

I am sorry.  I love broccoli and especially broccoli with lemon and garlic, but this was awful in my opinion.  I followed the recipe to a tee and my broccoli seemed a tad bit dry and had a roasted but burnt flavor.  I really wanted to like this but cannot describe the disappointment I felt after I realized I'd just wasted my broccoli.  Maybe I did something wrong.  My husband took one bite and said, "I'm not eating this!"

I followed the instructions to the letter except I used Kosher salt instead of sea salt.  It was WAY too salty, the garlic was overly browned and bitter and the broccoli itself was tough.  We're big broccoli eaters at our house (2-3X/week for dinner) and everyone gave it a thumbs down. :(  If you want a great oven roasted veggie recipe, check out oven roasted cauliflower -- it has rosemary in it and is absolutely delish!

I ate it, but didn't really care for it. It needed some water too because it was barely cooked after 15 minutes. I'll eat plain steamed broccoli before eating this again.

Came out great but a little salty. I will use 1/2 salt next time. My boyfriend loved it and thats a challenge since it is hard for him to eat fresh veggies. My house smelled great to.

This was FANTASTIC! I added a little lemon pepper seasoning before roasting. I could have eaten it all myself. My new favorite way to cook broccoli!

This was a delicious way to cook broccoli that I had never tried. At the suggestion of other reviewers, I decreased the salt to 1/4 teaspoon. It is always possible to add more to taste after the broccoli is baked. I also prefer to double the garlic amount, and sometimes I use both fresh garlic and powdered garlic. I've made this recipe both with and without the lemon and don't have a strong preference for it one way or another. 

I often double this recipe because it's easy for us to go through a lot of broccoli. I've also reheated it briefly in a pan with oil for a rice stir fry if I have leftovers and it's great that way too. 

If you are fond of vegetables in as natural a state as possible and recipes with simple, natural ingredients, this is the recipe for you. If you prefer veggie dishes loaded with cream, cheese or bread crumbs, skip this one.

I really enjoyed this, but when my mom took a bite she said, "Eww." Lol, but I still thought it was good. I added extra garlic and lemon and skipped out on the salt. Yummy, yummy!! Thanks for sharing:)

I was surprised at how good this was! I left my broccoli in the oven on 400 for about 25 minutes.  Served Italian dressing as dipping sauce, but it really didn't need it. :)  Nice, light side dish!

I was pretty disappointed with this.  The broccoli was too salty and burned a little in the oven.  15 Minutes is waaay too long in the oven at 400.  The salt was not necessary at all considering the lemon.

This was  just broccoli, nothing to write home about. I did have to add a little butter as I didn't like the olive oil flavor as much as i thought I would. This sounds exotic with the title, but it was just basic broccoli. I'd fix this again. Thanks it went well with our chicken dinner.

I would've given this recipe five stars but there was way too much salt for my liking.  Afterwards I read some of the reviews and realized I wasn't alone in this.  I wound up adding way more lemon than the recipe called for and actually added it to the bowl by mistake rather than at the end as per the recipe.  The lemon tasted just fine and it was an excellent and different way to make broccoli, even my boyfriend loved it.  It only took 10 minutes to roast in my oven.  I'll definitely be making this again and again, thanks for the great recipe!

So simple and so tasty.  I forgot to add the lemon juice and it was still great.  Actually, I'm not a big lemon fan when it comes to savory food so I may just keep skipping it :)

I was so excited to make this because of so many good reviews, but I have to say they were just okay... I followed the recipe exactly (except I added 1 tsp olive oil), and baked for about 13 minutes. At 13 minutes, they were already a little brown, so I took them out. I found the broccoli to be too dry and a little bitter. Maybe I cut them up a little too small? Next time, I'm going to try steaming broccoli first, then toss them in olive oil mixture, bake them for 5 minutes or so. But for now, this only gets 3 stars from me.

Delicious broccoli! Followed the directions except I always salt & lemon to taste (probably used about 1/4 of the amount of salt called for & a lot more lemon) and these flavorful florets roasted up nicely in 15 minutes. Thanks for a new quick, simple, & beautiful side dish recipe! :)

I just love this recipe.  It is so nice to make something different with broccoli other than raw or with cheese sauce.  I love the flavour that the lemon juice adds.  I added almonds to the dish as well and it was terrific.  I will most definitely make this again.

This is absolutely delicious. I had never thought of baking broccoli before. I didn't really measure the salt/pepper kinda winged it by a using a few grinds from our salt/pepper grinder. I love how there are parts of the broccoli that get browned and slightly crunchy. The combination of the garlic, olive oil and the LEMON (which really makes this dish) are SO tasty. It's such a simple recipe, healthy, EASY to do and tastes SO good.

Delicious.  I included the lemon juice in with the other ingredients before baking.  Cooked a little extra and the browner pieces were still firm but had a terrific roasted flavor.

For some reason, these burned after only 10 minutes. I followed the instructions exactly, but maybe I needed to have the florests bigger.

My family loves broccolli fixed this way.  I have also tossed it with balsamic vinegar before roasting instead of using lemon juice.  Yummy!

I added cauliflower to the recipe and it was great!!! I did not use sea salt I used 1/2 t seasoned salt instead. I also added dill and thyme 1/4 t of each and the kids were asking for more! You can replace the oil with butter if you like.

Nice variation on the regular old steamed or sauteed broccoli. I didn't think the salt was too much, but then I'm a big salt-eater. The lemon juice at the end is crucial. I may try sprinkling on some red pepper flakes next time to add a little spice.

Very good. I followed RaisinKane's advice and added a little sesame oil. That took it over the top. This is going to be made often.

Really great!  I always simply steamed broccoli and topped with butter and salt.  This is a great change.  I need to work on evenly coating them better.  My teenage son made the comment that some florets had more seasoning than others.  Blame that on my technique.  Great recipe.

Roasted Garlic Lemon Broccoli Haiku: "We love 'little trees' prepared in, well, any way! But this was was great!" Good, easy recipe that I did w/ a produce-bagged mix of broccoli and cauliflower. Gave them a stir/flip at 15 min. and roasted an additional 10 min. to ensure to nice patches of "char."

Made this for dinner last night but combined it with cauliflower. Basic roasting recipe that I have done before but never thought to finish it with a squeeze of lemon.  The lemon took it to the next level. DELICIOUS!  My husband's favorite....Make sure your florets are substantial in size so they don't disappear or turn to mush when roasting.

This is delicious.  I did, however, make *small* modifications.  No salt.  I only use salt for baking.  Otherwise we use Mrs. Dash.  I always use an olive oil mister rather than measuring.  (I highly recommend an oil mister!)  This was each piece gets a light mist, and I use less oil.  Instead of lemon juice, I used lemon zest instead of lemon juice.  Lemon zest gives it a deeper flavor and fantastic aroma.  The aroma rather lends to the taste.  I also tossed the zest, garlic, broccoli and oil in my baking pan.  One less dish to wash.  

Lemon zest instead of juice is great on salads, chicken, pasta salads.

really good! although I added a alot more lemon and i recommend it. I'm used to dishes in which the spices are so cooked and mixed together you could hardly taste them, so it was pleasantly surprising when I could taste everything individually. Makes a wonderful quick snack

Great side dish! Some tweaks: I used cayenne instead of black pepper for some extra heat and only roasted them for 15 minutes. Any longer and they would have burned; 15 left them just the tiniest bit charred on the ends. I wasn't shy with my use of garlic and lemon and probably used more than is listed here. Also, I used 2 medium-sized heads of broccoli and barely had 2 servings, not the 6 listed here. Anyway, it was absolutely delicious and I will definitely be making this again!

This recipe was YUMMY and so easy to make, everyone in the family loved it!  I "winged it" a bit with the measurements - probably added about 2 Tbsp of oil.  After taking it out of the oven and adding the lemon juice, I grated some parmesean cheese for a bit of extra flavor. So good, a nice change from my standard steamed broccoli.

I really liked the broccoli this way, minus the lemon juice.  I have a toddler so I cooked mine until they were pretty tender, but you can adjust cooking time to your preferred level of tenderness.  Some people were complaining about the salt, but I didn't think it was too salty, maybe because i didn't use the lemon.  You can also throw in some cauliflower with this and it also oven roasts pretty well.

Really yummy.  Good flavor... maybe even a little too flavorful.  Next time I will cut salt down to about 1/4 tsp.  Seriously... very salty.  Also, I didn't have lemon, but it was great without.
I did have to leave in oven for much longer than 20 minutes... probably closer to 30, but that might be because my pieces were not very tiny.

A nice change from boiled or steamed.   I would echo the comments on the salt.  While not dreadfully salty a little less salt would be an improvement.

I just loved how easy this broccoli was to make and how delicious it was to! I left out the black pepper because I don't care for it and used Kosher salt as that is what I had in the house. I lined a square baking pan with 2 sheets of foil and sprayed with cooking spray. Although, my broccoli took 35 minutes, to be just at fork tender! I didn't mind and figured it would take longer than suggested anyway. I don't know where 6 servings came from though, because I could at most get 3 servings from the recipe. That would still put it 98 calories, not bad! I was worried about the amount of salt, but it didn't seem over-powering. I might try to reduce it just a tad next time though just for health reasons, and see if it doesn't affect the taste. Will definitely be buying more fresh broccoli now, thank you submitter.

I love making broccoli like this for the boyfriend! It's his favorite veggie, and he ALWAYS requests this when I cook. Super easy, too.. one of those things you can throw together and in the oven while you cook the rest of the meal. Roasting the broccoli really makes the flavors stand out. I love using a TON of garlic, sea salt and cracked pepper. Occasionally I'll use other seasonings too, but it's perfect plain because of the flavor roasting creates. Never had it with lemon--- can't wait to try!

Made this one night when my 7-year-old nephew was over...when I took it out of the oven, I asked him if he thought he would like it or should I make another vegetable for him.  He turned up his nose, so I turned around to look in the cabinet for a can of something....by the time I turned back around he had eaten 1/2 the baking sheet!  Now I make it every time he comes over.  This is definitely the best way to make fresh broccoli!

This recipe was ok, I think the salt should be cut in half. It was way to salty for my taste, but I did enjoy the lemon. I will probably make this again just with 1/2 a tsp of salt next time.

My family is not really big on eating broccoli and I think this is the recipe that will change that. I basically followed the recipe as written although I only had one head of broccoli which forced me to make adjustments to the seasonings.  I'm sure I will make this again.

I've made these twice.  The 1st time I made them as stated- way too much salt.  The 2nd time I used 1/2 tsp salt and it was so much better.  What a great and easy way to have broccoli.  I shook it all in a ziploc bag.  I only added a few drops of lemon juice at the end b/c it tasted so good without the lemon.  Next time I will cut the pepper down a bit.

Wow! I love broccoli, but this was something new to me. After reading the reviews, it seems like many people either it or hated it. I used 2 really big florets, used three cloves of garlic and sliced them so each piece laid flat on the sheet. Cooked for the full 20 minutes. I added squeezed the lemon which added more juice on some pieces than I would have liked but it was still awesome. I will definitely be making this again soon.

Very good, but I recommend more garlic. I am a lover of garlic though so if your really not a garlic fan stick with the recipe. It was just slightly bland other than the lemon flavor. I will try it again and next time will put more garlic and maybe leave off the lemon juice.

I must have gotten really big broccoli heads b/c the oil indicated didn't get close to covering the broccoli and would've turned out very dry.  I ended up pouring enough oil to lightly coat the broccoli and it was still a bit dry but was a nice crisp dish.  Don't skip the lemon, it's a refreshing twist.  Might add pine nuts next time per another review to give it some more pep.

The entire family liked this but it was a bit too salty for us. Next time I will cut back on the salt. That's why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  Also could have used more oil.

We love this recipe and ever since finding it we have not had cooked broccoli any other way.  My kids love it!!  I also like to add a bit of freshly grated parmesan to the broccoli and then toss with lemon juice.

Delicious! I didn't have to roast it very long--the color was a deep green and the texture was perfect for me.

I topped with parmesan cheese instead of the lemon.  I think this is the only way I will cook fresh broccoli from now on.

Two stars... I'm no cook, not yet at least, but I cook the broccoli at 3 times at 3 different temperatures in the oven, and they still kept burning when I adjusted the time. I guess the olive oil is NOT THE PROPER OIL TO USE. I know its healthy, but roasting at high temps. is a no no for olive oil- it made my broccoli burn 3 TIMES! BACK TO STEAMING THEM I GO UNTIL SOMEBODY FIX THIS RECIPE!

Very good spin on broccoli! I was finishing a steak in the oven at 500 degrees, and put the broccoli in too, unsure of how it would work at such a high temp. It was great and only took about 6 minutes!

Holy salt!  This did not work for my family at all :-(  I followed the recipe exaclty, but the broccoli came out waaaaaayy too salty and dried out.  It stunk up my house, and for no good reason (and I love broccoli).  Sorry, but I won't be making this again.

not sure what went wrong exactly.  I followed the directions to a tee, but ended up with a burnt salty mess.  I should have checked this a good five minutes before the end of the given cooking time, just to keep an eye on it.  That still doesn't explain the overly salty flavor though.  I am still interested in trying to make this work however.  I think a couple of alternations next time might turn this into a tasty dish.  As is, not so much.

I'm probably giving this a few more stars than I should compared to things like fudge. It was a weird side dish but very flavorful at the same time. Will probably make again so I guess I like it :)

This was a simple way to prepare broccoli, but it made it seem a little more special than regular old broccoli.  I will blanche the broccoli next time by boiling or steaming for 2-3 minutes first so that it doesn't dry out in the oven while it's baking.

So good!  Thank you for introducing me to a new and much better way to prepare broccoli.  I have always steamed it and been happy with it even though I have always thought its texture was a bit rubbery.  Pretty sure I will only roast garlic from now on.  The small amount of olive oil in this recipe is worth the extra calories.  Delicious!

We love this.  I made it at a family gathering and someone thought I was burning it but it was just getting good.  I like to place the broccoli so there is room around each piece.  I find this makes them crispier and that's how we like it.  It does kind of start to look burnt as mentioned, but it tastes great.  My 6 year old actually whined for more broccoli!  That must mean it's good.  The olny change I make is to use a little more oil, but otherwise everything else as called for.

I followed the directions to the letter and burnt the broccoli.  The seasonings sounded good and the oven I used actually runs at a lower temp, so I don't know what happened except it had black tops.

very good, but i have a few adjustments that may improve this recipe: add 1-2 teaspoons of sugar with the salt (this will help the broccoli caramelize and give it a crunch), I preheated the oven to 500 degrees, and put the pan in the oven while it preheated so that it was hot when i put the broccoli on. This along with the temperature adjustment reduces the cooking time to 8-10 minutes. After the broccoli is done cooking i added fresh oregano along with the lemon juice. These adjustments make it a five-star recipe!

If you have never tried roasted broccoli before, you MUST try it!! It gives broccoli such a wonderful flavor. MMMMMM!! I usually omit the lemon juice in this recipe just because I rarely have it in the house. It is just fine without it.

Really good!  At the advise of others, I cut the salt in half (kosher salt-- didn't have any sea salt).  I don't care for roasted broccoli, so what I do is that I steam my broccoli first so that it is tender crisp, then mix it with the other ingredients and then roast.  This seems to cut down on the bitter taste that roasted broccoli has, but still changes it up a little by roasting with all the spices on it.

Wonderful recipe! The texture of roasted broccoli is so much better than steamed or boiled. My friends described this as the best broccoli they have ever had. I might use a little less salt and lemon juice. Thanks so much!

Oh! This is so good.  I love recipes like this; easy to fix, healthy, natural ingredients(fresh garlic is better than garlic salt) and common ingredients that I usually have on hand.  I peeled the stalks and used them as well and they were deliciously crunchy.  I didn't have lemon but a fresh lime and used just 1/2 teaspoon thinking that it wouldn't be enough but it was perfect - just a hint of citrus.  Thanks, Nerdy -this is a keeper.

This was VERY simple to make and I absolutely love it. My only complaint is that its very salty. I'm a huge salt fan though, so I didn't mind. I think next time I'll make it with cheese sauce and half the salt, and maybe more garlic as I'm also a huge garlic fan.

I have never liked broccoli, but I really like the way it tastes with this recipe, so I try to make it at least once a week now and my husband loves it.

I've never had broccoli like this before, very tasty!  I sauteed the broccoli in a pan on the stove instead of putting it in the oven.

Made this last night. It was yummy. My husband and I are both garlic lovers so I added a little more garlic and and lemon.  I would also maybe reduce the salt a bit.  Every oven is different so I would start checking it at the 10 minute mark. This dish will be on out table again.

We love roasted broccoli, so I was excited to stumble up on this recipe.  However, neither one of us really cared for it.  The tang of the lemon juice just really didn't work for us.  THANKS for the recipe!

This recipe sounded delicious, but I was worried after I read negative reviews that my penchant for steamed broccoli would be unsatisfied if I baked it.  So as I steamed the broccoli in my food steamer, and as I set out all the remaining ingredients, I also decided to brown the garlic in the olive oil.  While the broccoli was steaming, I browned the garlic in a pan on the stove, and then stirred in the browned garlic and olive oil, seasoned it with salt and pepper, then added the final flavor of fresh lemon juice.  I LOVED IT!  It is such a great variation on my old steady: plain steamed broccoli!  Thanks for the recipe + inspiration!

I have made this several times and love it very much.  I make it with baked chicken and after seasoning the broccoli, I like to throw it in the pan with the chicken for the last 15-20 minutes.  It cooks nicely together and fewer dishes afterward.  Its a good, somewhat intense flavor, so I bet it would work well for those who aren't normally broccoli fans.

This is probably the tastiest and quickest way to make broccoli. I don't eat vegetables very often, so this is a huge gain in my diet. The oil and salt actually makes these taste more like french fries than broccoli. I didn't add any lemon and they turned out fine. They might taste good with only the salt, pepper and oil. A total win for broccoli.

I make a similar recipe, but change some things up, which results in a 5 star dish--bake the broccoli at 425 for 20-25 minutes, add lots of freshly chopped garlic, and toss with a healthy amount of parmesan cheese after it's all done. I also add the lemon juice after the broccoli is cooked. Only roasting it for 15 minutes in a 400 degree oven would result in still-crunchy broccoli!

This was ok. But I know I cooked it too long and was lacking lemon juice, so I used some lemon pepper, hoping to get a tad of the citric flavor. My boyfriend enjoyed it though, he even asked for seconds. I would make this again, I feel I learned from the mistakes I made and can see how this would be good.

Nothing to write home about as far as taste. I agree with other reviewers who said the oven made the broccoli look unpresentable. We eat broccoli regularly and will not be using this recipe again.

I absolutely LOVE roasted broccoli!  If I am making a nice dinner, this is the only way I will make my broccoli.  
This is just so good and you can tweak it to your spice tastes!  I do recommend watching how much salt you use, as roasting brings out the saltiness!

Well, now I know how I'm gonna be cooking broccoli from now on!  This definitely beats boiling.  I used only one head's worth of florets, about 1 Tbsp. olive oil, 1/2 tsp. sea salt, and 1 tsp. lemon juice.  YUM.

I made this for the first time tonight. It was fabulous! The lemon juice kept the broccoli bright green.  I only used a small amount of salt.

Very good. Made as directed (including the salt; others cut in half) and took 20 minutes to cook @ 400*. We loved it and will definitely make it again.

This was pretty good. Next time I will cut down on the amount of salt. It was a little too done for my taste, so next time I will bake it for 10 minutes.

This was excellent!!  I did add more garlic since we are garlic people and I also added some crushed red pepper for the spice in our life.  I roasted the broccoli for 15 mins but will do 10-12 next time.  Loved the lemon flavor with this dish!!  Would recommend and will make again!!

Loved this...I am just getting starting making vegatables a big part of my meals and so I only had frozen chopped broccoli.  I was online looking for a good recipe for broccoli and came across this.  I made it the same way (Thawed the broccoli in microwave and patted dry with paper towels first)  and roasted it until parts of the broccoli were dark brown.  It was AMAZING.   As I mentioned I am trying to get more vegatables in my diet so I don't stress about whether it's fresh or frozen...I'm going for convenience until I get more familiar with it and this was so simple and so tasty and I'm thrilled that I've finally found a great recipe that will encourage me to keep going on my new year's resolution.  Thanks!

We really like this.  I've made it with minced garlic and garlic powder.  I prefer to make it with almost a whole tbsp of garlic powder as minced garlic tends to burn.  Cooking time is about 15 minutes.  It's great with or without lemon juice added at the end.

This turned out well!  I did a half broccoli/half cauliflower mix.  Instead of sea salt, I used a garlic and herb seasoned salt mix (one of those grinders with all kinds of mixed things).  I also tossed in some fresh grated parmesan.  I didn't use lemon and I will have to try that next time.

Excellent and simple recipe!  I modified it a bit by using less salt, a combination of toasted sesame oil and olive oil and skipped the lemon juice because i didn't have any.

LOVE THIS!!! I felt it was maybe a BIT heavy on the pepper, and I usually love pepper so much that I over-pepper my food! But other than that, delicious.  I did use juice from an extra-tart mandarin orange: I'd run out of lemons, but I wanted that citrus tang, and those mandarins were too tart for my tastes.  It was a decent substitute, but next time I'll be sure to have a lemon on hand.

I normally just grill asparagus with garlic salt, fresh ground black pepper and it tastes great.  This sauce to pour over the asparagus was nice but I prefer the basic garlic salt with pepper.

After reading through the mixed reviews, I decided to play it safe with the lemon juice and put it on the side of the plate to dip a piece lightly in before sloshing it all over the brocoli. Thank goodness I did too, because the broccoli itself was wonderful grilled with the mere oil, salt, pepper and garlic. The taste of lemon on it was just plain weird to me and completely ruined the gentle taste of the broccoli. I'll make broccoli like this again for sure, but will simply exclude the lemon from now on.

Tasty, tasty! I used garlic salt instead of minced garlic and salt. After I finished baking I squeezed a tad of lemon and tasted it. I can definitely see why some people would find this weird tasting...I added a small dollop of butter and that really made all the difference.

I would like roasted garlic, fresh lemon and a little salt and pepper if you put it in a fruit smoothie.  I thought this simple recipe was delicious.

Way too salty for us and the pepper was so overpowering that each bite tasted more like pepper with broccoli, rather than roasted garlic broccoli. I'll give it another try but will cut down the salt and pepper by half.

As others stated you end up with slightly burned broccoli. The lemon juice couldn't save it either. Adults and kids had the same feeling. Thanks anyway.

Amazing!  I cannot express in words how great this dish was.  I'm a "new" broccoli eater and I'm always on the hunt for ways to change things up. I've made this three times now and only the last time did I tweak it.  All I did differently was add an extra clove of garlic - since we really like garlic, and I shaved some romano cheese on the broccoli when it came out of the oven.  To die for!

Simply delicious, my hubby and I eat broccoli 4 times out of the week normally just plain. This adds a nice elegant taste and touch.

This was pretty good.  As others said be careful just how much lemon you add.  I lightly squeezed half a lemon and it was a little too much.  I suggest squeezing it into a separate bowl first then tossing the broccoli in it.  My hubby and I like firmer vegetables so we didn't cook it quite as long.  How I judge when vegetables are done is when they get that beautiful bright green that roasting gives them.  If you over cook them, they scorch and become really bad tasting.  I never thought to put fresh lemon on broccoli.  I'm sure it will taste better next time when I put less lemon.

Tasty!  I used fresh broccoli and instead of tossing the veges in seasoning, I just cut the broccoli into chunks, covered a baking sheet, drizzled oil, tossed on some salt, pepper and garlic powder and roasted it.

Yummmmmmm!!!!  This broccoli is awesome and really couldn't get any easier.  I used 2 cloves of garlic though cause we are garlic lovers.  If you toss the broccoli in a ziploc bag and then line the pan w/ foil there is hardly any clean up!

I have made this recipe a few times, and the best thing to do to avoid the broccoli getting too soft is to just make enough for a serving.

Great recipe!  I spread my florets on a cookie sheet, drizzled with olive oil and sprinkled with Montreal steak seasoning.  Tossed, roasted and then sprinkled with parm cheese before serving.  Skipped the lemon.  Yum!

I loved this recipe!  I did tweek it a little.  I started by blanching the broccoli for one min.  Instead of mincing the garlic I thinly sliced it.  Tossed everything together, and placed it on a broiling pan.  After baking, i sprinkled parm cheese over and squeezed half a fresh lemon over it.  Now i'm not a huge veggie fan but i did go back for seconds.  Yum!

For a lighter flavor use fresh lemon instead of the lemon juice, it made a huge difference.  The taste was more subtle.

Sorry, this did not work out for me. The garlic burned a bit and the broccoli turned brown. We ended up throwing it away. Could have been my oven or something I did, but probably won't make again. Sorry!

As written I have to give this 3 stars, I love salt and this was too much for me.  Maybe the heads I used were too small but next time I'm just going to eyeball it and use 1/2 the amount.  All of the other flavors were there in the right amount.  We sprinkled them with grated parm-romano, definitely better with the cheese.

Very good! Didn't have lemon juice so used lime juice, and it was delicious. Note, I used the Montreal Steak Seasoning per another review, it was good, but use sparingly! Kept getting bites of chunks of salt. Will make again. THANKS!

I did this recipe as is, no substitutions or additions and it turned out great!  I was wary that there wasn't enough salt, but it ended up being the perfect amount!  I tossed everything in a ziplock back to make sure it was coated evenly.  A super simple super yummy recipe.

This was really good.  I grated the garlic on my microplane, so it was more like a pulp. I think this may have helped avoid the bitterness other reviewers have described, because minced garlic becomes bitter if it burns.  I rubbed it all over the florets, then seasoned with salt and pepper, then drizzled it with olive oil.  It took about 20 minutes to get tender, and i stirred it halfway through. I forgot to squeeze lemon over it, but i will do that next time.

I love this! I use this recipe for brocoli, asparagus, cauliflower and brussel sprouts (all together or one vegetable at a time, depending on what i have on hand). You can also add cheese in the last few minutes of cooking but watch it closely because it'll burn fast.

This was a very good way to prepare broccoli; I liked the fresh taste that the lemon, pepper, and garlic gave to the dish. It was also very easy to prepare, but was a little salty for my taste. I will make it again, but will add less salt next time. Thanks for a very tasty and nutritious recipe!

Pretty good, too salty however. Next time I will cut the salt in half but overall really yummy and a unique way to eat broccoli. Great way to get your vegetables in that you not only enjoy but don't loose all the vitamins by method of cooking.

Inspired! Another successful veggie to roast! The lemon is key in this, and I only sprinkled lightly with sea salt. I also included thick sliced carrots and sliced red onion, because I was trying to make a dinner out of this. I roasted yellow squash and mushrooms on other pans, and tossed with a bit of whole wheat rotini. Thank you for the recipe!

Needed a good vegetable for a spur of the moment dinner and the only thing I had was a bag of frozen broccoli! This recipe sounded so good that I defrosted the broccoli (microwaved slightly until it was no longer frozen, but still firm) and then made this recipe. The only other change I made was that I had two fresh sweet Italian red peppers, which I sliced and added. Now this is my favorite broccoli recipe. Loved it!

Yummmmm!!!! I used a big bag of frozen broccoli, mixed lots of olive oil, salt, pepper, and jarred minced garlic into it then baked it as directed. I didn’t defrost it at all. It was so good when it was done roasting that I didn’t even add the lemon! The one year old ate 2 helpings.

Very good! Made following recipe and it was excellent. Nice change from steamed broccoli. I’ll add some red pepper flakes and Parmesan as some reviewers suggested and cook a little bit less for more crunch. Thanks for the super easy tasty recipe for a healthy veggie!

This is fabulous! I line a baking sheet with foil and toss the Broccoli with olive oil and salt and pepper on the pan to save a dish and start it in preheated oven at 450, then once I've put the pan in, I reduce to 400...Fabulous!

Absolutely foolproof; simple and delicious!  In a pinch, I've sprinkled with garlic powder when out of fresh garlic.  Use some of the stalk by cutting vertically.  So good, and done in 20 minutes!  Way better than steamed!

We have been putting more effort than usual to eat healthy meals and broccoli has been my go to as a side dish. We were getting bored with just plain broccoli and needed to mix it up. We had guests over the other night and we made this dish to replace the potatoes we would normally make.
It was a HIT! Everyone enjoyed it. I think we cooked it a bit too long but the flavor is great.  The beauty is you can alter it to fit your tastes.

Absolutely amazing! This stuff was like veggie crack. I couldn't stop eating it! I made it exactly as the recipe stated except for cutting the salt in half and adding a little lemon pepper seasoning. The brightness of the lemon at the end really brightens this up.

I'm just now getting to where I can eat broccoli, but this recipe would make a carnivore turn herbivore.  I had to smack my husband to get him to stop snacking on them before dinner.  Even without the lemon drizzle at the end, they are still FANTASTIC! No need to add, omit, or tinker... this recipe rocks.

This is a great recipe.  I made this once and everyone was really impressed.  The garlic takes on a crunchy goodness that is almost impossible to describe. The second time I made this I added cauliflower and it turned out just as good.  Well, the third time I made this recipe I added a pound of shelled, deveined, and towel dried  shrimp to the recipe (use a little more olive oil to coat) and had a wonderful new low calorie dish!  Thanks ever so much for the recipe.

I have to admit that I didn't measure the ingredients so maybe that's why mine wasn't salty as others reviewers complained. I laid out the broccoli on a cookie sheet and sprinkled the oil and seasonings on top then stirred them around on the pan (no need to dirty a bowl!). My son ended up adding parmesan cheese to his.

One word--- Awesome!!!!  I love broccoli, but this has become my favourite way to prepare it.  I suggest serving it with lemon wedges on the side for those with 'sensitive' tastebuds. Oh, yeah, baby!!!  Bring on the broccoli!!!

This was a VERY nice change from the normal steamed broccoli! I have a VERY PICKY husband and was almost positive that he would not approve, BUT HE LOVED IT! ...even though I may have cooked it a bit to long :-)

Great recipe and I followed it totally except I must have misread it for I minced 5 cloves of garlic. Oops!!  Will cut that back next time but I love garlic so it was fine with me. Did not find it to salty (I don't like salt) and since I was out of sea salt I too used Kosher salt.  Will make this again for sure and will probably also try this on other types of veggies. Very good!

This is absolutely delicious! I love fresh vegetables and find that they are so much better when roasted. I used to steam them all the time with a little bit of butter and this is so much better. It's now one of my favorite ways to eat broccoli. Thank you for the simple, yet wonderful recipe!

Me and my husband and daughter loved this!  This was my first time using sea salt and I used the coarse sea salt and it was perfect with the whole teaspoon of coarse sea salt.  I didn't find it too salty at all.  Hope to make a double batch next time!  It really was great.

This is soooo goo.  I don't have the sea salt so i just sprinkle a little table salt and pepper on.  I can never make enough.  Ive done it with frozen bags of broccoli as well before when in a rush and I did 2 bags and it is just never enough it seems.  My sister and I can eat it right off the pan before plates are made, it is so good!!

I love finding new ways to cook broccoli. You definitely have to keep an eye on them and get them out of the oven as soon as they begin to brown.

This was great! I did not even make it to the lemon juice part: with some of my family members being into a raw food lately, half of my broccoli was gone before it made it to the oven and it was DELICIOUS! I baked the other half for about 10 minutes, and it was VERY TASTY as well.

I have been making this for years, passed down generations. However, I steam the broccoli to maintain color and firmness. The oil, garlic, s&p, and lemon are added after the vege is steamed. Just use the ingredients to taste.

We tried this last weekend and enjoyed it so much we've bought twice as much broccoli to make it again tomorrow. My husband loved it! I followed the recipe as shared except for the salt.  Since we don't cook with salt at all it was omitted.
Thanks for sharing this great recipe.

A great way to add variety to the taste of broccoli. The taste of the garlic and sea salt amped up the flavor of the broccoli. Highly recommend.

I am not a fan of broccoli. This recipe changed my mind. I put only 1/2 tsp of salt as suggested by others and it was perfect. I also didn't have any lemon but will definitely use it next time. I sprinkled it lightly with Parmesan cheese. Delicious. A keeper for me.

Excellent recipe, super easy and very tasty!! I did 1/2 the salt as other reviewers suggested and Im happy I did. Perfect healthy, tasty way to eat/cook broccoli!  I even forgot the Lemon, cant wait to try it with the lemon squeeze!!!

Ok well I tried this again tonight and added the lemon and did not like it at all! I will continue to forget the lemon in the future!

I do not like broccoli!!!! Hubby does so I made it for him and thought I'd give it a try. This was the first time I've ever enjoyed it. The oil didn't seem like enough at first but turns out the recipe is perfect. Very flavourful. Thanks NERDYCHEESECAKE!

I make this at least once a week. It's great for university students, as it is both easy and healthy, and broccoli isn't as finicky as some other vegetables about hanging out in the fridge for multiple days.

I love this recipe but use fresh LIME juice instead of lemon and had a sprinkle of oregano once it's out of the oven. the two add a wonderful yummy taste.

I always think it needs more lemon for my tastes. but some think its too lemony as it is... Either way, it always goes great with Alfredo. And the beauty of cooking is adding more or less to taste. :)

this was a hit! I used 3 broccoli heads instead of 2 but kept the rest of the ingredients the same. Mine needed 20 minutes but turned out great. will definitely add to the rotation when lemons are in season!

Yum! I was looking for an alternative to roasting veggies with balsamic, and this recipe was a winner! It was SO simple and fast, and my husband and I both loved it. I did reduce the cooking time to 13 minutes, and it was perfect. Thanks!

Really, really good.  I made it with a cauliflower/broccoli mixture.  Me, my husband and my 11 year old son loved the way this turned out.  Will be on a constant rotation in our house.

Just like the side dish of broccoli you receive at steak houses (like LoneStar)!  I even set the oven temp down to 325 degrees because I was baking pork chops at the same time, and it didn't seem to matter.  I just baked the broccoli a bit longer than recommended.  I'd go light on the lemon juice, though.  Just a few squirts was more than enough.

I'll just start by qualifying that I love broccoli, I love garlic, I'm not salt sensitive and I like lemon. So I'm not predisposed to not liking this recipe. But to us it just wasn't that great. I used three heads florets and still halved the salt based on previous recommendations. I'm really glad I did, to use the amount called for on two heads would have been a disaster. I roasted for 16 mins stirring halfway through. I sparingly used a half lemon's juice on the three heads. The flavor ended up being weird. We really liked the texture, and the taste before adding lemon was pretty good. I think I'll keep the roasting method and in the future swap the lemon for shredded parm during the last 5 minutes.

Easy, tasty recipe for broccoli! I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone keeps begging me to make it again. It was a bit garlicy for me, so I would suggest powdered garlic for those feel the same, but everyone else in my family loved it!

This is very good. Inspired by a friend's recipe, I spinkled pine nuts over the broccoli and also added red bell peppers to the broccoli. Both were excellent additions. I love how easy this recipe is. It would be a great option to serve as a side dish to a more involved recipe, since it takes so little time to prepare.

Mix ingredients in bowl , mix in broccoli, wrap in nonstick foil wrap and throw on the grill on low setting for 15 - 20 mins turning once.  Can remove or put to the side while grilling meat. Then if needed last minute heat up. Delish.

Overall very delicious.  The only negative was it was really salty.  I used kosher salt (didn't have sea salt) and used the amounting the recipe.  I would probably use 1/3 tsp next time.

I made this tonight for my family as a side dish.  It was so quick and easy to make.  My family loved it and I loved the fact that it put a new twist on our broccoli!  I didn't have any lemon in the house, but it was just as delicious without it.

This was fantastic!!  I had to use frozen broccoli because that is all we had on hand.  I was really impressed with how good this turned out!

I make this with frozen broccoli and/or cauliflower (fresh veggies always go bad in my house before I get around to cooking them).  I usually just toss some frozen veggies with olive oil, sea salt and garlic powder, but occasionally I'll chop up some garlic and squeeze some lemon on it.  I actually think it tastes better with just garlic powder, salt and olive oil, though.  This is a good way to cook frozen chopped broccoli.  I never buy chopped broccoli, but I bought some by mistake a while back and this recipe made it SO GOOD.  I cooked a small pack of broccoli florets and a pack of chopped broccoli together and the chopped broccoli was so much better than the florets.

YUM! I only tried these once but we have more broccoli so will try them again soon. Some pieces got a little dark because I left it in a few minutes too long, but even they were delicious. They were crispy on the ends! I will definitely save this recipe. My husband had seconds!!!!!

My kids, who are not the best veggie eaters, all loved this.  This may be the first time that all three of them have eaten all of their veggies without complaint!  I did forget to add the lemon juice at the end.

what a great new way to make broccoli! And you dont lose any nutrients in the cooking process like you do in steaming.  I did not use the lemon juice but instead i sprinlked some lemon pepper seasoning on top before cooking, added just that tiny hint of lemon.  I would recommend that for people who are wary of the lemon flavor in this recipe.  It is perfect cooked for 15 minutes.  I left it in for 20 once and it started to burn.

Loved the texture and flavors of this! Followed ingredients exactly, adjusting for more broccoli. I used 3 whole heads cut into florets and there was only a tiny bit left over with four of us. Definitely doesn't feed 6, so adjust accordingly.

This broccoli is soooo good!  I used a bit less salt and pepper (I think my heads were smaller) and it was perfect.  I pretty much ate the whole batch myself.  The lemon makes it taste so fresh.

These were quite tasty! I loved the fresh lemon-zing, they made a crispy, flavorful side-dish to some pork chops. Thanks for sharing!

I goofed something up and used the juice of one whole lemon which is decidedly more than 1/2 the teaspoon that the recipe calls for, but it still turned out great.  It was quite a bit lemonier than it should have been but I still give it 5 stars.  I'm ready to try this again with the correct amount of lemon juice because it was just so darn good!  This is a great way to fix broccoli!

This was fantastic!  I followed the recipe exactly the first time I made it and omitted the lemon the next few times not because it was bad, simply because it wasn't available.  It was still delicious.  I don't think I'll make broccoli any other way.  I cooked the broccoli until it was almost burned turning part way through the cooking time.  The crispiness was SOO delicious!  I also subbed the fresh garlic and sea salt for garlic salt once because I was out of garlic and it was almost as delicious.  Thanks for a great recipe.

this is a great way to eat broccoli! I am giving it four starts only because the recipe (as written) calls for a bit too much salt for my tastes.  However, the combination of ingredients is wonderful and once I cut back on the salt a little bit it turns out beautifully.  Thanks for the recipe :)

Finally!  A way to cook broccoli without it getting mushy.  Love it!  I usually leave out the lemon, but it's good with it, too.  Cooked like this it doesn't need cheese or butter or anything else!  Thanks for the recipe!!

The lemon gives it the needed kick.  Lemon pepper seasoning is what I used to use, and it just wasn't quite enough to make frozen broccoli more flavorful.

I didn't care for the brown sugar, and cooked the Broccoli longer than the recipe suggested. Other than that the dish was very enjoyable.

I enjoyed this method, it can take get used to the texture, but it was very flavourful and I added some hot pepper flakes to balance out the lemon and garlic yummy!

This is AMAZING.  I tried with just a small sprinkle of lemon juice, because I didn't have any fresh lemon and had a feeling the bottled kind would mostly likely not work out.  Also went with less sea salt, as others mentioned.  Even halving it wasn't enough of a cut.  Next time, I'll just be sprinkling it on.

This didn't turn out as good as I'd hoped. I cooked as instructed and it was still pretty crunchy. I would have cooked it longer but it was looking pretty ugly and I was afraid of serving black broccoli. I also thought it was too salty but I use kosher salt for cooking so that could be why.

Maybe you have to dislike broccoli to*really* love this, because I do! I salt less, like some others. For a great alternative, try fresh minced ginger instead of garlic. Wow!

I LOVE broccoli and olive oil! This was so tasty! I used fresh squeezed lemon juice and minced garlic from a jar since I was in a hurry. I also  added steamed cauliflower so it was double the goodness! Was enjoyed very much!

Good tasting broccoli!  My family likes broccoli to begin with, but this added a little bit extra.  I probably will add a little less olive oil & maybe use either light cooking spray or I can't believe it's not butter spray to cut some of the fat to a healthy side.  Very good!

Excellent! So easy to make and tastes soooo good. It has a nutty flavor to it that is really addictive. I skipped the lemon juice (because I simply forgot about it) and used kosher salt instead of sea salt--it was yummy. I sprinkled a little parmesan on top before serving. Totally a keeper!

My new favorite vegie side dish!  I did make a few changes based on another recipe I saw on a different site.  I used broccoli, cauliflower and brussels sprouts. Two cloves of garlic, sliced.   Baked at 425 for around 18 minutes.  When it was nicely browned I pulled out of the oven, added a little splash of olive oil, fresh lemon juice and a little parmesan cheese.  I've eaten 3 out of the last for nights.  Would have been 4 but went out to dinner. Love it!!!

I thought this was fabulous! I used 3 head of broccoli (it still didn't yield that much) and put the spears, the oil, garlic and 2 tsp. of parmesan cheese in a gallon-size bag to shake up together. After I laid it on the baking sheet I freshly ground the sea salt and pepper over it. They were delicious as is, but I did squeeze a small lemon wedge over my portion. It was good with that addition, but if I didn't have a lemon, I would just eat it as is. Yum!

Delicious. I may have went heavy on the garlic but I can't hold back when it's garlic! This is a wonderful recipe to work with and add flavors and spices as you see fit.

This recipe is amazing! I equate it to brocolli french fries. I found a teaspoon of salt to be a bit much, but half a teaspoon worked well. I highly recommend this!

Really good - just adds an unexpected zing! Watch the broccoli on the last 5 minutes in the oven... mine was done before the time was up!

The first time I made this I followed the recipe verbatim, and thought it was really good but needed a bit more garlic.  Since then I have prepared this using 3 cloves of garlic- perfecto!  It's probably my family's favorite way to eat broccoli- thanks!

This had a good flavor and we loved the texture of roasted broccoli, but there was perhaps a little too much salt. I also parboiled the broccoli first to prevent the color and odor other reviewers complained of. I will make this again.

First time cooking broccoli this way and my family ate the whole pan. I didn't notice it being too salty but I also didn't measure out the salt or pepper. The lemon juice on top gave it just the right touch.

Made this last night for hubby and me and it was delicious!  Perfect way to serve broccoli!  We loved it - did use Montreal Staeak seasoning instead of salt - great flavor.

I don't usually care for broccoli but had to go back for seconds with this dish.  I pretty much followed the recipe to the letter and unlike some others I did not find it too salty.  Thanks, will definitely be making this again.

This was super delicious and easy to make.  I eyeballed the ingredients and used more of everything that was called for.  I accidentally added the lemon juice before baking, so I squeezed some more after it was done and it was still amazing.  I roasted it until some of the pieces were charred and crispy.  Everyone loved it!

This was extremely good. I couldn't roast it because I was already using the oven for other things, so instead I sauteed it. We all tried it before it was cooked and it was already amazing. Once I cooked it, however, I felt some of the flavor was lost. Looking forward to roasting it in the oven next time. Only difference I made was to use lemon pepper in lieu of regular pepper. YUM!

A little salty for my taste. I will cut the salt in half next time, but otherwise very yummy! I also left out the lemon juice which was easy to do. Thanks for a great new way to fix broccoli!

yummy yummy yummy.  I only roasted it for 12 minutes and that was done enough for me.  Really good with the addition of parmesan cheese just before serving.

Way too salty (and I decreased it to 3/4 tsp)!  After 20 min they were still a bit crunchy. Loved the subtle lemon flavor, as well as the other seasonings, but probably won't make again... we prefer them steamed.

This was fabulous.  Despite the few bites in which I got a mouthful of salt (will cut the salt and toss alot more in the future), the broccoli was delicious.  My son and husband, neither of whom are big veggie eaters, were annoyed that I didn't make more.  Will definitely make again in the future.

Because I have to mess with every recipe it seems, I started off by roasting baby new potatoes with the broccoli, garlic, oil and s + p, and added fresh parsley, dried thyme + oregano. Once about half-way done I then added a few chicken breasts, coating them in the roasted garlic, spices and oil from the pan. With a generous squeeze of lemon over each plate, it made a complete meal that was a huge hit at our house.

I'm always looking for new ways to make broccoli because my husband loves and I only like it so-so. So, anyway I can spice up broccoli is a perk for me. This was pretty good! The only thing I did differently was to sprinkle some of the lemon zest over the top of the broccoli before it went into the oven. It was quite good and the Hubs loved it too! Thanks for a new idea!

Like most everyone else said, this recipe is awesome! I did make a few changes I think only made it better: 1. I used about 3 cloves of garlic as I    L-O-V-E garlic 2. I added just a pinch of red pepper flakes when tossing with garlic and oil 3. I sprinkled the finished broccoli with some parmesean cheese. I have to say I personally ate ALL the broccoli because it was so good! Thanks for the great, simple, healthy recipe!!

Loved this! It was a nice change from our normal broccoli. I used frozen broccoli and just defrosted it in a colander and then baked for 15 minutes it was great!

Awesome!!  We loved it!  If you love this, you must try the roasted brussel sprouts from this site too.......I always at least triple the garlic (cuz we are garlic freaks!).....We do these as appetizers.  Super good hot or cold!

BFs sis turned me on to this dish and now I make it regularly. We saute it rather than bake it and add red pepper flakes for an extra kick. Wonderful side- easy & healthy!

This was very good, but I did have to add extra oil to coat the broccoli completely. I didn't find it too salty, but I didn't exactly measure the salt, just sprinkled it on. I will say that any spot that wasn't coated in oil was dry. I used the full 20 minute cooking time and my broccoli was still somewhat crisp. I was a little skeptical about the lemon, but I enjoyed the zing and freshness it added to the dish. Thanks for a keeper.

This is just like a recipe my daughter found on the internet except that freshly grated parmesan is missing - it's key, so don't omit this.  When you take it out of the oven, sprinkle about 1/2 cup and toss it in the bowl with the lemon juice.  Lemon zest kicks it up a notch too.

WWWOOOWWW!!!! This was INCREDIBLE!  I didn't know you could roast broccoli and it was FABULOUS!  I didn't measure the ingredients because I wasn't making a full recipe and I think I eyeballed it pretty well.  I made a test sample of almost one crown as a side dish with my lunch. It was so yummy and slightly blackened, that I ate it all wth my fingers off the cookie sheet.  It never made it to my plate!  I made more for dinner and my husband loved it, as well.  It was an unexpected explosion of robust and delicious flavors in his mouth, he said.  I am really excited to have found this recipe.  It's my new favorite and it will be a staple in this household!  Thank you!  Mmmmm!

i do the same thing with brussel sprouts.Trim ends of brussel sprouts, cut large ones in half. Throw into a large zoploc, drizzel with olive oil and kosher salt. toss to coat. lay out on a baking sheet and put into oven at 400 degrees and broil for 40 to 45 mins. They are great and the leaves that fall off taste like potato chips. My 13 year old son actually asks for these.

This was pretty good.  I didn't think 2 tsp. of the olive oil was nearly enough - I had to add more and my stems never got tender in the cooking time but I like mine crunchy.  They were beginning to dry out so I did not want to leave them in any longer.  The flavor is great as with all roasted veggies.

We never eat broccoli. My husband brought some home and I googled to find a recipe. I came across this one and we tried it. And loved it! Easy to prepare. Light, lets the flavour of the broccoli through without over cooking it.
Definitely will make it again.

DELICIOUS! This was so, so good. It was a nice spin on my normal broccoli that I make. The lemon at the end added a nice zing. I paired this with honey Dijon chicken thighs and my husband licked his plate clean. I'll definitely make this again!

A simple, yet tasty side dish.  WARNING adjust the salt.  This is so easy to make that all I do is throw the broccoli on the sheet pan, lightly drizzle oil, sprinkle with salt and pepper and toss.  No measuring required.  Squeeze lemon after baking and done. This is a quick weeknight way to make broccoli.

Before I try a new recipe, I look to see how many reviews it has and I read a handful of reviews in order to tweek the recipe.  This recipe did not disappoint.  I cut my broccoli into rather large pieces asnd I even cut the stalks and baked those, as well.  I put the broccoli into a ziploc bag first with a generous amount of EVOO and shook the bag to coat the florets evenly.  I used 1/4 tsp of Kosher salt, 1/8 tsp pepper and 2 cloves of garlic.  Popped it in the oven for 15 minutes and they were cooked.  I transferred the broccoli to a bowl and added a little melted butter - because butter makes everything better.  The broccoli is just as addictive as everyone has indicated.  This made a great easy side dish for my brined herb baked boneless chicken breasts.

Tastes great, simple. I had to cook it a little longer to get it a little softer (but still firm). Might reduce salt a bit next time, or just leave it out and let everyone add salt as desired.

I forgot to add the lemon juice after cooking, and it was still delicious! Next time I will use the lemon, because I think it would really add to the dish, but even without it the broccoli had good flavor.

I LOVE this recipe. My boyfriend made it due to me sending him to the kitchen and he made it perfect. Honestly couldn't have asked for a better broccoli recipe. This is amazing want to try this same recipe with all vegetables now to see which is my favorite. Will be making this on the regular from here on out. Thank you for sharing this recipe changed our meal prepping routine.

If you have to eat broccoli--I don't always want to, but I know it's good for me--this is an excellent way to prepare it! :) I added twice the amount of garlic and lemon, because I love it. Thank you for sharing this!

It’s a great way to cook broccoli and this recipe provides a good starting point.    I do think it needs more than 2tsp oil.  After roasting, I omitted lemon and sprinkled parmesan cheeses on top instead and broiled for a couple of mins.     Yum!

Love it!

This is one of my favorite healthy recipes when I want something healthy that actually tastes good. Everyone I've ever made it for has loved it, even people who don't normally like vegetables!

I do recommend not adding the lemon because I think it adds a weird flavor to the broccoli. You can also use garlic powder and/or garlic infused olive oil, instead of regular garlic, to save a little time.

You can cook carrots, onions, peas, and cauliflower in a similar way. I often get two large pans, and bake 2-3 of these vegetables along with broccoli, and have plenty of healthy good tasting vegetables for the next several days.

I made no changes.  It is awesome.  I never steam broccoli because it tastes nasty. Besides the taste, don't  half of your nutrients  fly out the window with that method of cooking?  This recipe is really simple and I was surprised at how tasty it is.

Only change is I tossed it with grated parm and sprinkled more on op when I roasted it.   I cooked 20 min at 400 and tossed them 1/2 way through. Delicious!.

Soooo good! And easy! I only had 1 head of broccoli so I cut the salt/pepper in half and used full amount of other ingredients. I probably will reduce the salt even a bit more next time, but I paired it with mashed potatoes that needed more salt so it ended up perfect with the meal. Will definitely be my go-to broccoli recipe.

Made this on a whim for Christmas dinner and it was a huge hit!  The kids, who don't normally like broccoli that much, were shoveling it in.  Next time I would halve the salt, though.

Instead of using the oven, I made it in a skillet on the stove top. I added all the ingredients plus a touch of water, covered it to keep the moisture in, and let it cook slowly for about 30 minutes. Serviced it with tender chicken breasts cooked slowly in a pan with oregano, chili powder, salt & pepper, and homemade mashed potatoes. The meal was delicious!

Try steaming for 5-8 minutes. Place in bowl, wait just a minute for steam to dissipate. Add a bit of butter and Weber’s Zesty Lemon seasoning. Mix well. Family favorite!

I made this with cauliflower added for a side to the one dish rockfish entree found here. Complements it very well. Obviously, you should love lemon and garlic. If you do as much as I do, it’s amazing!!

This recipe was very good. I had some pre-cooked/blanched broccoli. I used them instead of raw ones and followed the recipe as is. Very good and crunchy!

Delicious--husband and I both enjoyed this easy way to fix broccoli!   I like my vegetables on the crisp side so was hesitant to cook over the recommended time but, either I needed to cut the stalks smaller or cook a little longer!!

Am not a broccoli fan but our son is so I tried this recipe. Adjusted it by using more  olive oil and left out the lemon. Baked for 20 min which was a bit too long. Taste was great and everyone (including myself) loved it. Will definitely do again!

I absolutely adore this recipe. The roasted garlic adds a great smoky flavor, and lemon adds a wonderful tartness. Also tastes great reheated for lunches, etc.

The fewer ingredients the better.  This is minimalist at the very least.  Quick and easy, and delicious.  If you like broccoli, this should become a regular.

Not bad at all. I used coconut oil instead of EVOO but everything else stayed the same. The kiddos ate this with no complaints! I was light with the salt.

It was very good and easy to make, and the kids devoured it (no fighting about eating veggies!). Saving it, will definitely make again. The only comment is: careful with lemon juice.

Oh, my goodness....this is an amazing recipe!!  I did use less salt (1/4 tsp) and more garlic. I also sprinkled some onion burger spice on it too. This is really delicious raw also......we ate a 1/4 of the recipe before we cooked it.  LOL  But then  I covered it with foil for the first 10 mins and then cooked for 20 uncovered.  Mine did get just a touch chared and we loved the flavor it gave!!

Worked out really well, needed more like 25 minutes to cook, and my husband didn’t care for the lemon juice. But everyone else liked it.

Ummm. I'm rating this dish because I HATE broccoli. It tastes as bad as it smells when it's being cooked. Well, I hate serving food that I haven't tasted. So I tasted a tiny, mostly limp, floret. OMG!! Did I actually enjoy that???!!!!! I ate another one.... then another. I did tweek it by adding a small amount of herb de provence and canjun seasoning (we put Tony's on everything.) I baked it on parchment paper because in the past when baking broccoli it would stick really bad and it was a pain to flip. This was great! I'd eat it again.
That says alot from a broccoli hater!

I agree with another review, this was horribly bitter and a waste of broccoli.  I love lemon, garlic and broccoli but the roasting ruined it. Maybe lower temp or less time and less lemon.

This recipe is fantastic as long as ONE important change is made: The salt should realistically be no more than 1/4 teaspoon, I might even recommend taking it out completely and seasoning with salt to taste at the end. Like many other commenters have been saying, adding an extra clove or more of garlic will do wonders if you care for it.

This broccoli is addictive! I followed the recipe exactly, aside from adding a teaspoon of paprika for extra flavor. In addition to serving this as a beautiful side dish to almost anything at dinner, you could also keep it chilled and mix it into a delicious salad at lunch.

Very good recipe.  Broccoli turned out very tasty, tender. Will do it again.  Next time will add at the very end cheddar cheese

So easy and yummy.  Great way to get through the ginormous bag of broccoli from Costco!  You can save the roasted broccoli and eat it later as a salad topping

I am a huge broccoli lover,  absolutely love this simple recipe.

I did not add the lemon as I'm not a fan of lemon on my food outside of my daily lemon and hot water.

I have changed my eating habits drastically and needed a simple recipe to change up steamed broccoli.

Love it!!
Thanks for this simple but flavorful recipe.

We make this at least twice a week. We have a toaster oven that we use more than our regular oven and tweaked the recipe for it. Cooking at 420 degrees for 18-20 minutes has the broccoli coming out with a slight crunch, which my husband loves. We use this broccoli in pasta, quinoa bowls, and as a general side dish.

I have been put on a low-salt, low-fat diet, and normally make broccoli with cheese, which my rather picky hubby loves.  I found this  recipe and cut back the butter to 2 TBS, and he loved it.  We both did.  Filling,  satisfying crunch, plenty of flavor.  He wants to make sure we do it again.  We will.  thanks for a great side dish!!!

This recipe was delicious, I chopped the  garlic , using 3 large cloves because I just love the flavor of garlic. A little sprinkle of red pepper flakes added a little bite to it as well.

This recipe as written has way too much salt.  I would reduce the salt by at least half next time to make it palatable and let the garlic stand out.  As it is, only the saltiness stands out.

Very tasty, but VERY salty.  I only used about half of what the recipe called for, and next time I will use less.  Otherwise, this was absolutely delicious, and I will definitely make it again.

Mmmm... yes salty like others mentioned but I was having it with a delicate tasting salmon and it was the perfect complement with it's salty flavor. Easy and delicious.

I love simple, healthy and delicious recipe like this one.  The squeeze of lemon is truly refreshing to the palate.  I had been searching for broccoli recipe without cheese or cream of mushroom.  This is a side dish I can make again and again.  Thank you for sharing.

I prefer a stir-fry in skillet type cooking for broccoli.  Add toasted slivered almonds to enhance the broccoli flavor.  So delicious!  Thank you for the recipe.

Awesome new way to make broccoli, instead of simply steaming.  I used frozen (thawed in microwave) broccoli; it came out great with 15 minutes in the oven.

I've been making this forever! I started out with roasted cauliflower, but then I added the broccoli.  I put a couple T lemon juice in a giant Ziploc bag with the florets, garlic, and olive oil (I omit salt & pepper - you can always addit at the end).  Just shake it a few times and dump it in a big roasting pan.  We like for the broccoli to get almost burnt on the ends (makes it sweet!), so it goes in the oven for about an hour.

So good! I didn't have a ton of broccoli and had some extra cherry tomatoes around, so I threw those in too and roasted them with the broccoli and it was delicious! And so easy. This is going to become a new favorite for me

I LOVED it! I used 2 cloves of garlic instead of one (I'm a garlic kinda girl) and I added a bit of cheese in the mix. The taste of lemon with the brocoli was awesome. I could eat a whole plate of those.

The lemon juice really topped off this dish! It's perfect and make sure you don't over cook the broccoli. It's nice to have a little crunch.

Love broccoli and cheese, but we have to cut back.  This recipe was so delicious that we didn't miss the cheese!  There wasn't any leftover either.

Not bad, but I think broccoli is a veggie I prefer steamed. Almost all others I love roasted!

I halved the salt based on the previous reviews and pulled after 15 minutes. I sprinkled with grated Parmesan before serving.  The broccoli had just enough crisp and tasted amazing!

It was good, but I think the salt and pepper amounts were very overpowering.  I'll definitely be cutting back next time I make this.  I could barely even taste the garlic, and garlic is a strong flavor!

Still, I liked the idea of it, and we still ate it so it wasn't bad.  Next time I might sprinkle on some parmesan cheese for a bit of extra flavor.

A little too much salt...maybe 3/4 tsp would be better.  Forgot the garlic and it was still divine!  Added parm cheese - a nice addition but definitely not necessary.  Bob loved.  No more steamed broccoli!

excellent!  My family loved it.  I didn't use the lemon, but didn't need to!  Even the dog like it.  Jumped on the counter when i turned away and ate the remainder.  No leftovers!  LOL

Added lemon pepper prior to roasting. Next time I will cut back the roasting time or keep a closer eye as a few of my florets got a little too roasted. Will make again for sure, very tasty!

I make this all the time. It's pretty much my go-to veggie. I buy a giant bag of broccoli and a jar of minced garlic at Costco and keep a back up bottle of lemon juice in case I'm out of fresh. This is so easy & delicious & I never have any leftovers.

It tasted so good, healthy, and easy! I  recommended putting the broccoli in a tin foil 'basket' then placing it onto the baking sheet to roast it. It smoked up my oven.

I added Tumeric and Red Wine Vinegar, I also added carrots, it rocked.   I did a cheese sauce for my daughter who is 8 and is extremely picky.  She ate a huge bowl of it. My dog even ate one of the carrots.

I found this recipe elsewhere and the only difference is that after adding the lemon juice, they also sprinkled parmesan cheese over it. I never tried it without.. I have also seen another variation that I haven't tried--mix the cheese in with the oil, garlic....ingredients. THIS IS MY FAV SNACK and more addicting that potato chips. BEWARE though, I've made it 1/2 dozen times already and burnt the last batch by leaving it in an extra minute. Watch it carefully.

This was a fantastic side dish! Probably one of the best tasting broccoli dishes I've ever had. The only thing I would do differently next time is sprinkle the salt, pepper and garlic on after the broccoli had been tossed in the oil and put in a single layer on a baking sheet. Other than that - perfect!

Pleasant, just be sure to only add the listed amount of oil or it will leak onto the foil when it is finished

This was a great and tasty way to make broccoli. I used lime instead of lemon and it was great! I still like steaming broccoli more though! I recommend this recipe with all my heart! If you like broccoli with a kick, you will love this!

I made this as a side for a BBQ.  My guests enjoyed them and even commented that they didn't know you could bake them like this.  Love the combo of garlic and lemon in addition to the crisp edges.

I love broccoli, but I'm always looking for a different recipe to mix it up. This was good, but it was definitely too salty for my taste. I'll probably cut the amount of salt by half when I make it in the future.

I will have to tr y it again but with a little less salt next time and 10 minute cook time instead of 15 minutes. I love all the ingredients so I'm sure it's just tweaking to taste :)

I loved the flavor, but even after cooking for 20 min., they weren't done enough.  Next time I will cut them into smaller pieces before baking.

This was decent. I wasn't sure about it at first, but as I ate it, it grew on me.
I found the lemon to be a little overpowering, so I will cut back on it if I make this again. It is definitely a unique departure from my normal broccoli prep.

The only thing I left out was the lemon juice.  These potatoes were wonderful! Oh! I did add 1 extra ingredient though. When they were done I sprinkled a little Colby-jack cheese and put them back into the oven while I served up the rest of the meal. They tasted like the potato skins you get in a restaurant. I will make these many more times!

This was a really delicious recipe! For those who thought that the broccoli turned out bitter and an unpleasant color, try cooking it for only 10 minutes.

I would make again. My dad especially enjoyed it, because it was a delicious way to eat veggies. I made more of the sauce because I had a little extra broccoli. It ended up being very salty, so next time, I would cut back on the salty ingredients.

My family LOVES this recipe! It's easy and delicious and healthy too. We always add more garlic and a bit more olive oil.  You may want to reduce the salt amount but we like as/is.

Thank you very much for this recipe, but i will admit that i made a couple of changes. First of all broccoli is a new concept in our house, so i was very happy to see such a simple and yummy way of using it. Second, the only reason i added a couple of changes is because we dont have an oven, so instead i cut the broccoli into little slices (they were already boiled) and fried them with garlic slices, and then added salt and pepper. My sister squeezed the lemon, and she said she liked it very much, and shes the picky one!

Surprisingly, really good! I've never eaten broccoli anyway other than raw or in a salad before. I will take 1 star off simply because roasting it made an odd texture in my mouth AND cuz roasting almost burnt the tops of the broccoli a little (and yes I had it only 400 degrees like the recipe said) which made some of the pieces taste a little burnt. Maybe next time I'll keep the oven down a little. Other than that, it was delicious.

This side dish was very good. I'm trying to eat healthy and usually  eat broccoli with cheese. Happy i found this healthy alternative.  I added 2 garlic cloves instead of 1 (Garlic lover). Mixed ingredients  together then poured over broccoli. Mixed in bowl and put in pan as directed. I also scooped out the leftover garlic in the bowl i mixed it in and put on top of the broccoli. Tasty!

Less salt next time and i used coconut oil instead of olive oil. My hubby, no joke, stereotypical meat and potatoes guy loved this recipe! Our first night of "eating healthy" and his response was i never wanna eat broccoli any other way! Enjoy! Less salt!

This was absolutely wonderful. Family loved this. I will use the sauce part and add other veggies to be roasted. Great flavor. Did not change one thing.

This was really good! My kids who normally turn their nose up at broccoli actually asked for seconds. I accidentally forgot to add the lemon juice, but it was still excellent without.

I loved this dish! I steamed the broccoli in the microwave for a few minutes and then added it to the rest of the ingredients. only had to roast it for about 17 minutes and it turned out perfectly! drizzled some lemon juice on the top and was good to go! my family also loved it

Excellent recipe. For couple of years, this has been the only way I like  to cook broccoli, unless the oven is busy. I do turn  the pieces of broccoli, half the way through the cooking time. 
When in a hurry, I just use garlic powder for the fresh one and lemon pepper for pepper and lemon juice.

Really, really good! This  is a healthy tasty way to make not only broccoli but also asparagus and zucchini.  I put lemon wedges on the side because I like more lemon than others. If  you need to cut down the salt you can use a Mrs. Dash lemon and herb salt free seasoning. This still tastes great and some even like it better!

I never loved broccoli until I tried this recipe.  I will never go back to steaming broccoli.  This is was so simple and easy.  I will say that I cooked the broccoli for only 10 minutes and I think had I cooked it for as long as the recipe suggested, it would have been mushy.  I prefer crispy vegetables.  I did accidentally added the lemon juice to the oil before cooking the broccoli instead of adding it afterwards, but it was great.  This broccoli is amazing!

I have made this recipe many times. It is one of my very favorites for a fast, simple broccoli side that pairs with many entrees. Occasionally I use a sea salt mixed with dried lemon peel.  This recipe only goes wrong when I accidentally leave the broccoli roasting too long. It helps to toss or turn them over half way through roasting.  Keep an eye on it near the end or else you may end up with florets that are too charred. Don't skimp on the fresh lemon.

Delicious.  Added a little more olive oil and garlic.  Be sparce with the lemon unless you love lemon taste.  Broccoli absorbs this well.

I don't usually like broccoli but with this recipe I actually enjoy it! The only thing I'll do differently is less salt next time. I may have just been using small heads of broccoli though.

I made this tonight for my broccoli hating preschoolers. I love broccoli, my 4 kids hate it. Tonight, my 3 year old asked for 4ths... 4THS!!! My 5 year old asked me to make it every night. It's so easy and I will make this a hundred times again. I didn't really measure the oil... and used Wildtree Roasted Garlic Oil instead of EVOO. Because I had it. I used almost 1tsp of kosher salt. Next time I'll stay closer to 1/2 tsp. I could see why some might think it was too salty. I used a tsp of minced garlic and tossed it again halfway through cooking. I cooked it uncovered for 15 minutes. And I squirted most of a half lemon over the finished broccoli. So good!!! SO SO GOOD!!! I will try it on zucchini next.

When I tried this recipe, the broccoli ended up far too salty.  As well, it didn't roast so much as it shriveled.

Love it! I usually have to put some sauce or something (like ranch) on top of broccoli just so that I will eat it.  With the lemon juice on this, I didn't need anything, it's delicious!

This is the first time I roasted broccoli and not sure about this flavor. The garlic burned and I felt like there was not enough oil.  Thus the broccoli came out a bit bitter and dry and burned (I had to pull the broccoli out after 15 minutes). I may just stick with stir frying.

I absolutely love this recipe! I followed the directions exactly the first time but thought it could use a little bit more of a lemon flavor. The second time I used a couple dashes of lemon pepper and it was just even more amazing.

Will do this again and again. Everything we love and very simple. We make big batches because it doesn't last. The only difference is spritz the fresh lemon juice on about 10 - 15 minutes before done. Seems to really pop.

Tasted pretty good! I do suggest cutting down the salt level-- I used less than the suggested amount and it still seemed on the salty side-- but it tasted fine anyway.

Made as written first time, too salty. Not a big salt eater.  I salted after taking out of oven, I tweaked to my liking, added garlic power and a pinch of Nutmeg, always use on my green vegies.  With these changes, was loved by all and have made it over and over. LOVE IT!  Thanks for posting, sorry I tweaked, but it worked for us.  The basic is great, and do whatever ya like.

Amazing!  It even tasted good before roasting.  I added in some mushrooms because my broccoli heads were small, and completed the meal with a baked potato with spices.  The lemon really seals the deal.  This was delicious.

A delicious broccoli recipe.  It was something a little different, which I liked.  I added extra garlic just because I love garlic.  Just be careful not to overdue the lemon juice.  I love lemon juice and ended up putting in a little more than called for, which was more than was needed.

This recipe is beautiful and what makes it even better is that hubby loves it!  Its kind of surprising because it is rather bland until I added the splash of lemon which really livened it up!  I've made this recipe four times since the first time and I see it many more times in our future!  Thanks for this!

Instant family favorite!  Freshly-squeezed lime juice instead of lemon juice is also great.

I loved this recipe. It was easy to make. I did use parchment paper for easier clean up. I had small broccoli florets. It took only 15 min. to make this side dish.

I didn't have sea salt so I used table salt instead and omitted the lemon altogether. Simple and delicious. Best broccoli I've ever had. Thanks so much for posting this!

LOVE. LOVE. LOVE!  We are big broccoli people and I almost always steam it with a dash of sea salt, so the idea of doing anything "too much" to my broccoli intimidated me and left me thinking I was going to end up with a bitter, mushy side dish but that couldn't be further from the what happened. This was delcious.  I made it with the easy baked tilapia recipe here (http://allrecipes.com/recipe/easy-baked-tilapia/detail.aspx) and it was perfect.  Will definitely do this

Great way to change broccoli. I loved the sea salt although you need to mix everything well since a few pieces came out saltier than others. Baked for 20 minutes

My boyfriend made this, and he added the lemon juice before cooking accidentally, but besides that he made as is. This is super delicious and surprisingly addictive, I cannot stop munching on them whenever they're made now. For me, they are on the border of being too salty, but that is a really easy fix, and so far I just keep making it as is. We've even given the recipe away to a few people who found them as irresistible as I did!

I made this for Christmas dinner with friends. Everyone loved it! Anyone who cooks much knows that you need to adjust ingredients in a recipe to suit your personal tastes. I made it exactly as the recipe calls for (which I hardly ever do) and it was great.   Roasting vegetables makes them special. Keep a watchful eye on the broccoli while roasting, I almost burned it :) Thanks for sharing this great recipe, and giving me the perfect vegetable side for our holiday dinner.

The flavors were wonderful but it was WAY too salty.  I'll make this again for sure but use half a teaspoon of salt next time, if that.  I also sprinkled grated parmesan cheese on top and thought that added a lot of flavor as well.

I found the lemon juice too sour.  I think I would make this again but without the lemon juice. Maybe serve it on the side for those who want some.

Very good broccoli recipe, and I am not a huge fan of broccoli.  I made it without the lemon, and there was still plenty of flavor.

I added more garlic and cooked it longer.  I stirred it half way thru.  It was very good!

Husband of 12 years who will eat anything, took 1 bite and said no.  Too salty and dry.  It needs more olive oil.

Simple, healthy and flavorful.  I did add a bit of garlic spread to the tops of some of the vegetables which added a bit more flavorful.  I also used a broccoli and cauliflower combo.

I love this recipe!  Hubby and I eat it all the time, but I top with fresh grated Parmesan Cheese (I buy a chunk of Parmesan and grate it at home as needed, just to clarify which type) and put it back in the oven for about 2 minutes.  YUM!

It was really good and I will definitely make again; however, I may cut back on the seasonings just a bit.  The lemon at the end really made the dish.

Even though I increased the amount of garlic, the dish was still pretty tasteless for me.  The best part was the addition of the juice of a whole fresh lemon.  That gave the broccoli a fresh, welcomed zing!

Very good and as usual i added some extra garlic.
This was my first time actually mincing my own garlic, normally I buy it minced.  It was not that difficult and it was far more flavourful.

I drizzled the broccoli with the olive oil and tossed it with the seasonings and cooked it according to the directions.  The flavor itself is great.  The downside is (and it's a serious downside) that the house smells like broccoli afterward.  I'm wondering if blanching the broccoli first (or using frozen broccoli that's already been blanched as a part of the packaging process) would eliminate the "broccoli" smell.  The taste is good enough to make it worth trying again with the blanching step...

Excellent.  I made the recipe with only one head of broccoli and kept the rest of the recipe ingredients the same, except I added a touch more oil because it sounded low.  Also, I put in the lemon juice with the mixture before I cooked it, I didn't sprinkle it on after.  This was very tasty.

I thought this was great.  I'm giving it 4 stars because after I pulled the broccoli out of the oven I realized I didn't have any lemon or lemon juice on hand, so I was missing one of the flavors.  I plan on making this again with lemon juice and bet that I will change this to a 5 star at that point.

Roasted broccoli is always good, but this needed double the oil. And the lemon juice was interesting.

This was very delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly.  This is a very nice way to incorporate more veggies into my families diet.

I totally overdid the lemon juice and it got a bit sour, but even with the sourness, I can still tell that the broccoli were absolutely delicious. I will definitely make this again, but will leave out the lemon next time. Quick, easy, healthy and delicious!

Very good!  Followed the recipe with no changes.  Was a bit too salty as mentioned in previous reviews.  Will definitely cut way back on the salt but definitely a great way to serve broccoli!

Yummy! The only way I cook broccoli anymore! Even my 2 year old eats this! I omit the salt as we watch our salt intake and broccoli has a fair amount of salt in it naturally, but that is the only change I make. Great recipe!

I prepared this for the first time tonight.  It was great!  My picky 7 year old ate every bite and asked for seconds.  (My 2 year old wasn't so thrilled but he's not a broccoli fan yet!)  I cut the salt a little and went easy on the lemon, but otherwise I pretty much followed the recipe.  This is going in my recipe box for future use!

These were really good. I found the salt strong and i couldnt taste the lemon. I doubled the recipe so maybe that's why it tasted like that. I will keep this recipe but i just have to be mindful.

Delicious, crunchy, savory and oh-so-easy! That said, I halved the salt and still found it a bit salty; I think 1/4 teaspoon would be enough.

Simple, tasty, and tangy.  Just the broccoli recipe I was looking for.  I used less salt as recommended by other reviewers and so glad I did.   Will be making this side dish over and over again.

It's a nice change from just steaming broccoli. I used frozen broccoli that I had thawed and think it would have been much better had I used fresh.

I really am amazed at how simple and delicious this was.  I had my oven at 350° because I was also making a marinated baked pork chop and I didn't want to change the temp.  So I put the broccoli in for 25 minutes at 350° and it turned out very tender and fantastic.  I omitted adding the salt (since I figure people can always add salt if they want it) and the flavour was quite exquisite. Thanks for the recipe--will be using this one again!

I love the concept of adding both garlic and lemon, it adds wonderful flavor to the broccoli. However, next time I am going to cook it for less time. The smaller florets came out burned and inedible. But with some small cooking tweaks, this makes a delicious veggie side dish!

This was fine, not outstanding.  I didn't taste the garlic much, or the lemon at all.  I halfed the salt and was glad I did.  Worth trying again with more garlic and lemon juice. I may have just had more broccoli than the recipe called for?

Yum!  I don't think the olive oil added much to the flavor in that little quantity.  Next time I may just use butter flavored cooking spray for ease.  I roasted whole garlic cloves too.. the flavors blended nicely.

I added a little Parmesan cheese to mine at the end which was great. My oven is a little crazy so it didn't take as long as the recipe called for so mine burned a little too. Overall it was pretty tasty!

How much is two heads? I think I must be off because I doubled the olive oil and doubled the garlic, but put in less salt and pepper than stated. More s&p could have been added at the table but not necessary. I tossed it in a plastic bag (actually added the lemon juice in the bag too by mistake). 12 minutes was fine for me (20??? at 400? maybe at 350 degrees instead).  Added more lemon juice before serving too. Anyway, we were pleased with the results, and my ingredient amounts.

I really have to work at eating vegetables. Let's just say that they are not the first thing I think about eating. I tried this recipe. YUMMY! YUMMY! YUMMY for my tummy! I ate all of my broccoli first then the rest of my food. This is high praise indeed!

I thought this was very tasty-with one provision-i thought the roasting time was way too long.  my broccoli was a little too burnt for my taste.  liked the flavor however, and next time will cut down roasting time.

First time I ever cook broccoli. My wife and five year old girl loved it. I used frozen broccoli so I baked it for 25 minutes, right after I added little chunks of avocado and a little of Parmesan cheese and back into the oven for five more minutes.

Roasted Garlic Lemon Broccoli was extremely flavorful. I thought it was good but my boyfriend thought it was excellent. He ate all I made! I only cooked it for approximately 12-15 minutes and it was done slightly al dente - just the way we like it. Be careful with the lemon juice because the flavor comes on very strong, so pour conservatively. I also sprinkled some mozzarella cheese on at the end and let it melt before serving which I thought really added to the dish.

So so so good, I could eat them like candy!  I sprayed them with EVOO instead of trying to toss them in it, it worked well, and got a more even coating on them:)

The main problem I had with this recipe was that it was too salty.  I used regular salt instead of sea salt, so that could have caused a bit of a difference in flavor, but I don't think that regular salt is much more salty than sea salt, so that doesn't account for the problem.  This was an interesting way to eat broccoli, and I may try it again, but I will definitely cut back on the salt.

I really liked the flavor of the roasted broccoli.  I sprayed the broccoli stems and tree part with canola cooking spray.  Then salt & pepper and into the oven.  When it came out I sprinkled some Molly McButter on top and I was good to go!  I'm not a lemon fan but the technique is spot on for the broccoli!

Broccoli is my favorite vegetable. I parboiled and then roasted to prevent the drying out some had. The moisture was fine, I just didn't care for the taste though.

I liked it but didn't fall in love like some of the other reviewers.   I didn't find the recipe too salty as some have suggested.  I used the stalks cut like carrot sticks so they cooked at the same speed.  I doubled the garlic and added too much lemon, so I will have to watch that next time.  Thanks for a new side dish...I'll have to try it with Montreal seasoning too, as recommended by another reviewer.

Vegetables are great roasted. Make sure you only cook until tender crisp for the least amount of time. I baked this for less than 10 minutes and it was great. It was even great the next day and the lemon blended great.

i have just tried the recipe out and finished the broccoli! it is great! i love the idea of baking them : )  Skipped the garlic as i did not notice i have none of it after i sliced the broccoli. another thing i did was wrapping the broccoli with aluminum foil so as to protect the moisture and prevent it from roasting too much.  the lemon juice at the end is a wonderful delight to the broccoli and i would definitely try the recipe again. : )

I was a little skeptical with making this recipe because I thought I read alot of negative comments. But we had this for dinner and it was very very very good. My two year old liked a lot. This was a a very good different way of changing it up a bit with broccoli. Thank You

I am not a big broccoli fan, mostly due to the fact that my husband likes it cooked to almost baby food consistantcy and it makes my house stink when I cook it.  However,  love this recipe, but did add a small sprinkle of parm cheese.  Yum, yum!!

This was amazing! Best broccoli ever! Just a drizzle of oil and a little salt and paper with some pre-minced garlic was amazing! I did not have lemon but it was just as good! Make sure to keep an eye on the broccoli so the top does not get brown! I served it with a baked mahi mahi with similar seasonings and it was perfect! Very healthy! love it!

I eye-balled all the measurements on this and just sprinkled what I thought was a good amount of salt, pepper and oil.  It turned out so good and better than I expected.  I only added lemon to 1/2 the broccoli because I wasn't sure I would like it.  Turns out I like it best without.  Too much zing for me.  15 mins was enough for me.  May use a little Pam next time to avoid some sticking, but this receipe couldn't be eaiser.  Will definitely make again.

I had to try it twice to get it right. First time didn't bake fast enough. Second time, I baked it at 450F (but my oven isn't the most reliable, so that could be the discrepancy). Extra garlic for us and lots of extra lemon juice. Now, it's mom's favorite thing to eat!

Good change on broccoli. I made it all on the stovetop because it took less time and I thought maybe the oven would dry the broccoli.

I've never roasted broccoli before but this was great.  You don't get the rubbery feel like you so with steaming them.  Loved this...

Great idea. I seasoned the broccoli, and then sealed it in an aluminum foil tent and cooked it on the grill for about ten minutes. I'll do this recipe again. Next time, I might try to sprinkle in some almond slices as well.

never will you see teenagers take 2nds and 3rds of broccoli until you make this tasty dish! in fact, my 2 yr old is a solid fan of the little trees after this one! **try any spice variation you'd enjoy - we like to omit garlic, add basil, and make sure to MIX WELL to avoid that one piece doused in pepper ;) ENJOY :)

This tasted pretty good, but visually I was just a little put off by the pieces of broccoli that browned - probably just my preference, as I love steamed broccoli and the bright green color of it.  I'll make this again, but maybe I'll try going for a more steamed approach by covering it while baking.  Still, no complaints on the flavor!

I made this recipe according to the recipe. I have never had broccoli cooked in the oven, but it was very good. The lemon was a unique flavor. I didn't feel it was to salty as some other reviewers did, but if you are worried I would just leave the salt out and put it on later to taste. Very good recipe!

This is quite a delicious recipe. Nobody new broccoli could be baked, but everyone I've fed it to has loved it. Some of them even said they were going to bake all their broccoli from now on.  The only thing I change is the salt content, which I just cut in half, because it is VERY salty.

Just cooked this - ate the entire dish by myself which I've never done before - was always able to control myself - have to come up with another veggie for dinner and I can't focus because I am so full!  By the way - have never been a great fan of broccoli but this was addictive for me!  Listened to other reviewers and cut salt in half - next time I will cut it back even a bit more.  Thanks submitter!!!

Very good!  I added extra EVOO to keep it moist.  It was very easy to make.  The amount of sea salt was perfect for us and the lemon gave it a nice tang.

I loved this recipe.  My fam thought it was a bit salty, so I'll cut back on that.  Also need to watch that it doesn't burn or it looses appeal with the kids.  Also seemed like I used more oil than it called for.

Interesting flavor on this one.  I like the tang, but I'm not sure I'll make it often.  Anyway, it's a sure healthy side dish and one that deserves a try.  My partner really liked it, but I give it 3 stars, so we'll average at 4.

Slightly Salty but maybe I didn't cook enough broccoli :P  Also I baked it for no more than 10 min at 375 degrees but it came out GREAT :)  My Boyfriend LOVED it and finished everything.  Will definately make it again...probably with more broccoli :P

Wonderful flavor and color!  Looked nothing like the picture though.  
I cut ours long and larger florets like the restaurants do with roasted brocoli, so had to add about 10 minutes and little more oil & lemon juice.
My picky eaters who don't like to try new things turned their noses up at it since used to steamed, but at least they ate it.  Still deserves 5 stars.

My girls are now totally addicted to roasted broccoli because they love how the florets get all toasty and crispy brown. The only thing I did differently was significantly cut back on the salt. So good and thank you!!

This broccoli was so good! I loved the crispy heads. I took others advice and used less salt. I added red bell peppers to roast with the broccoli. Yum!
