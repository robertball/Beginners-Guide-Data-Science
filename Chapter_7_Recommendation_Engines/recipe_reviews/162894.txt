This recipe really is superlative. Here's how I make the curry paste without a blender:  Grate an onion (this is easier and takes less time than you'd expect). Grind two tablespoons of black pepper (don't reduce the black pepper--it's too distinctive to the recipe's flavor). Cook the onion on medium for two minutes. Then add the ground black pepper and cook for four minutes. Then add the coriander and curry powder (I used two tablespoons in place of the curry leaves) and cook for one more minute. Throughout this process, add up to one cup of water as needed to keep things from sticking to the pan.  After that, proceed with the recipe as written. In order to reduce spiciness, I cut the cayenne pepper in half. I'm also guessing (although I don't know) that two tablespoons of curry powder is less hot than a half cup of curry leaves. With these reductions, the recipe was still almost too spicy for my taste buds, so many might want to go down to a tablespoon of curry powder and half tablespoon of cayenne.  Adding spinach at the end of the simmering process worked pretty well for me as a way to add some vegetable to the recipe.

This was a great dish and had a good amount of heat to it, the way I like it...A few of the changes I made were, to do the dish in the crock pot for six hours. I liquefied two onions in the food processor  and then added all of the seasonings. I browned the goat meat after dredging in seasoned flour, first, then put everything in the crock pot.

Great recipe!  Nice and spicy.  In reading the other comments, thought I'd share that curry powder, which is a blend of many spices, is NOT the same as curry leaf (which is, well, a leaf). If you use curry powder, you will get a different flavour than what is intended in the orginial recipe (not bad, just different - and likely more spicy). Also, if you do find it too spicy, you can stir some plain yogurt in to the curry to tone it down. Overall, very yummy (with curry leaf OR curry powder)!

**Caution** Recipe AS IS is very, very spicy!
This recipe had a good flavor, but the spiciness was just too much even after I reduced the amount of Cayenne Pepper to 1.5 Tbsp. and the Salt to only 1.5 tsp.  
And instead of fresh Curry Leaves I used 1 Tbsp. Curry Powder.  I will probably make this recipe again with even less Cayenne Pepper.  I'm sure it would be even better with lamb!  Yum!

This recipe was really delicious.  My husband orders goat curry when we eat out, and he thought it tasted as good as the restaurant.  I omitted the cayenne pepper - it was plenty spicy with the peppercorns.  One of my three kids liked it, but the other two thought it was too spicy.  Next time, I will decrease the peppercorns by 1/2 to suit their tastebuds.  I also used 1 Tbsp curry powder instead of the leaves.  It was really delicious.

Indeed this curry will be very spicy. I used only 1 tsp. of black pepper and no other pepper, yet it was quite spicy. Next time I will use lesser pepper. Oh, I did not even make this curry with goat meat, instead boca burger as I am vegetarian. Though, I am sure, that this original will taste quite good if you can take the heat.

We are not light weights in the spice department but even after cutting back dramatically based on other reviews, this was just too spicy for us.  Unfortunately, with spices so overpowering, we could not even taste the locally raised goat I got at the farmerâ€™s market.  This is the first time in years I can remember having to trash a meal and make something else.

This was our first time eating goat meat and the first time making a curry. We thought the recipe was delicious, however very hot! My husband can tolerate hot and spicy food and he also found it too hot.
We are going to experiment and add some yogurt to try to cool down the leftovers and next time reduce the cayenne pepper. 
We used the fresh curry leaves and thought the paste was excellent.
We plan to try this recipe again with lamb.

The texture and color remind me of my favorite dishes at my local Berkeley Pakistani restaurant. I used less than half the recommended spices and it was too spicy for me. Meat was a bit tough (maybe needed to cook longer) but the taste was really good.

this was very good.  i was afraid of the amount of spices so i cut back a little.  even doing that it still had quite a bite to it.  i know what our limits are and this was perfect for us as i made it. if i do make it again, i'll use lamb, as the goat i used was a little too fatty. thanks for the post Tarama!

We really enjoyed this! We only used one TBSP of cayenne pepper and found the heat just about perfect. One thing I will change next time is grinding the peppercorns by themselves; for some reason my grinder left most of them whole and they were pretty chewy. All in all, a great recipe, just make sure you have a big batch of raita handy!

Made as written and everything tasted amazing. Definitely not to spicy. As other commenters have noted, curry powder is not the same as curry leaves. Substituting it for curry leaves will not give you a similar dish because they are different! Very tasty!

Loved it! Added diced carrots and substituted nutmeg for ginger.
