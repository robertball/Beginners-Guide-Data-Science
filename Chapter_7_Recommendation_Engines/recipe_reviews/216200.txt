I made no changes to this festive dessert, and it was very well received.  Everyone commented on the how there were lots of different flavors and textures, but how they worked so well together.  Honestly, I wish that the base was not from a mix, and think that a shortbread base would be delicious, so I may try that next time. Great holiday colors!

I loved this!! I made it for Thanksgiving, and it went over great! Of course, they had to compete with the oreo truffles I made, so they didn't get eaten up right away. But I ate the leftovers really fast! I accidently used a whole bag of white chocolate chips instead of the 1/2 cup. (It was the end of a very long day of baking and I wasn't really paying attention) It still tasted great. I had to spread it like frosting, and it was a little messy trying to take it out of the pan, but they tasted amazing! I actually think they would taste better with more of the chips instead of drizzling them like the original says. And it didn't take long for the chips to melt. I stuck them in there for 30 seconds and they were all melted. Oh, and DON'T store them in the fridge. They get hard and chewy and I almost broke my jaw trying to eat them. I'm definately making these for Christmas! :)

These were ok, nothing exceptional or poor. The dough needed to cook 5 minutes longer than stated, and heating chocolate like that did not work for me. I liked them, but ended up throwing away half of them after a week as no one else ate them up. Mostly a taste preference though, I liked them just fine.

I made this into a dessert pizza and I think the 1/2 cup of white chocolate chips is actually too much, I used just about 1/4 cup and thought it was fine.

These were just average.  Easy to make but I won't be making again.  I followed the recipe exactly.
