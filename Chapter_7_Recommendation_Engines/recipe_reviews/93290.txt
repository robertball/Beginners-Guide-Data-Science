Don't add eggs or oil!! Have a little bit of faith - it's an anomoly, but they don't need added liquid. Set aside everything you know, and just do it - experience the miracle! 

I make this recipe even easier by buying the pumpkin pie filling instead - no spices needed, just cake mix and pumpkin. 

Make it the right way, first - without the eggs! It's part of the beauty of this recipe, don't miss out!

I LOVE these!  Yes, the batter is stiff (more like drop biscuit dough in texture) and the muffins are not as pretty to look at, but you just can't beat 'em.  They're quick and easy, have lots of fiber, and they're unbelievably moist!  (If yours are dry, just underbake them slightly.)  Here are a couple of tips:  Skip the spices and just use spice flavor cake mix.  Same flavor, but quicker!  Also, try making these with dark chocolate cake mix.  You absolutely cannot taste the pumpkin!  They taste a lot like brownies!

Turned out pretty well, but the recipe itself is flawed.  As is, this recipe makes batter that is very dense, not the consistency of muffin batter.  I added 2 eggs and about 1/3c vegetable oil to make the batter better, and about 3/4c chopped walnuts for fun.  I also would have liked about twice as much of the seasonings for more flavor.  Overall ok, nice and moist but not a strong pumpkin flavor.  Finally, these were enormous muffins, but still cooked completely for the recommended 25 minutes.

These muffins turned out great!  Only suggestion... is I sprinkled a little brown sugar on them to get a crust/crunch... I love muffins with a crumb topping.

These muffins are marvelous!  I made them using a spiced cake mix, and they came out SO good.  With just 2 ingredients, the prep time is about 3 minutes, and  two of those minutes are spent filling the muffin cups!  We will be making these again, and again,

I used a spice cake mix and a 15 oz can of pumpkin.  The muffins turned out great, very moist.  It is hard to believe that the can of pumpkin will provide enough moisture, but it did.  I will be making these AGAIN.

Absolutely fabulous!  I used a spice cake mix with a can of pumpkin. The recipe says EASY and it is.  For a mother of three, one of which has a serious egg allergy, this recipe is a godsend.  All three kids ate them up and asked for more.  I am constantly experimenting with egg replacer powders and cannot believe how well these muffins stayed binded and puffed up without egg or a replacer!  They are dense, but great! I cannot wait to try the many possible variations and additions(raisins, chocolate chips etc). Thank you!

Ok, I wouldn't go so far as to say they're the best muffins I've ever had, but they are so easy to make and what a great way to sneak some extra vitamins and fiber into the family diet.  I've made them with chocolate cake mix, spice cake and yellow cake.  All are good.  I even tried frosting the chocolate ones and they totally taste like yummy cupcakes.  I make these about once or twice a week.  My kids love 'em.  I use mini muffin pans mostly which only need 15 to 17 mins to bake.

These were incredibly easy and delicious, likd by all ages. I made them into 4 dozen mini-muffins, cooking 15 minutes. Also instead of all the different spices, I just used 1 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice. I like pumpkin, but don't love it, so I appreciated the mildness of it. My husband who doesn't even like pumpkin liked these! I plan on experimenting with different cake mixes, adding white chocolate chips, or maybe spreading with cream cheese. My daugher wanted them with ice cream! :)They are good hot or cold. These would be good to send in lunchboxes or take to brunch or as a gift to someone sick.

OK, I really hope my review will help everyone making this... first off, I have made it two ways... the first was to the letter, as written.  And as many have reviewed, it is extremely dense, and not very pumpkin-y, but still a solid 3 1/2 stars.  I then changed it up, and added in 1/2 c. applesauce (one of those little cups that come in the multi-packs is conveniently exactly 1/2 cup!) and got rid of the spices and simply used 1 and 1/2 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice.  I used my electric mixer on HIGH for at least a minute, giving the batter a heavy "mousse" like texture.  Used loaf pans as well as muffin pans, and baked MUCH LONGER than called for... over 45 minutes instead of the 20-25 called for, and the loaves could actually have been good with five more.  Five stars all the way with my revisions.  Just a tip to all - go ahead and taste the batter.  It will give you a very good idea of how it will taste when cooked, and give you the opportunity to play with adding more spice to your liking.  As this doesn't have any raw eggs in it, you don't have to feel guilty about doing it!  Good luck everyone!

I took a lot of advice from previous reviewers.  I used lemon cake mix because that is what I had and I liked the flavor.  I also made mini muffins and only cooked them for 15 minutes.  I'm only giving these 3 stars (an average rating) because  the batter is dense and so the tops of the muffins don't turn out smooth like regular muffins.  Maybe moisture from water or oil would help.  Form the blobs of batter neatly into the cups because they tend to come out the way you formed them from the spoon, jagged and awkward.   Nevertheless, they are moist, tasty and so easy to make.

I made these muffins and sent them to Afghanistan where my husband is currently deployed to. I told him to try the muffins before sharing (to make sure they were good)but when he opened the box his soldiers saw and could smell the spices and they all wanted what was in the box and they dove right in. My husband said they were very moist and it made him miss home even more. It took almost a week for my husband to get the muffins and they were still fresh.. I'm going to make about 100 more to send to them.

These were great, and my toddler won't pass up a chance to crumble one into her mouth! :) I used spice cake mix, canned pumpkin, and added 1/3 cup of finely grated carrot for more veggie power.  And I made mini-muffins - 15 min. was perfect.  Before I baked, I sprinkled a little oatmeal (quick cooking) and brown sugar on top, since they are not the prettiest things to look at. ;) Oh, I put the batter in a ziploc bag and cut a corner off, then used it as a piping bag to fill the muffin cups.

Easier way to make these is DUMP everything into a  1 gallon zip lock bag.. and seal and knead in the bag until completely mixed.. then snipe the tip off one of the bottom corners and PIPE into the Muffin lined tins. No Mess, no Clean up and  Perfectly formed Muffins...  SEE MY PHOTO

I made these once with just a yellow cake mix and the pumpkin and they were ok, but quite dense.  This time I tweaked it a little. I used yellow cake mix, 1 3/4 cup solid pack pumpkin, 1 heaping teaspoon pumpkin pie spice, 1/3 cup unsweetened applesause & 1/3 cup water. The batter was thick but easier to work with and the muffins came out with great flavor, very moist and less dense.  Wonderful.

Oh my!  I bake all the time, trying new recipes as I go along.  I am not one to just change ingredients though.  I read about 100 reviews before I decided to make these muffins.  I used a carrot cake mix and a can of Libby's Pumpkin Pie Mix.  I doubled the recipe and used my stand mixer because many reviews said it was difficult to mix.  I ended up with 48 mini muffins, and 10 regular muffins.  Plenty!  I added the crumble topping from the banana muffins.  I brought these to work, and had to refill the serving platter within an hour.  In addition, I got about 20 requests for the recipe.  Many couldn't believe that there weren't any eggs in the recipe, and how moist they were.  I was so skeptical, but have now become a member of allrecipes just so I could review them and keep them in the recipe box.  Don't wait, make them!

i lack confidence when i cook and love this site because of everyones advise and opinions.  my father-in-law is a retired baker and is very critical, but honest.  he is 88 years old and needed something to welcome home neighbors thanksgiving day.  i made this recipe and read reviews and added 1/3 cup of unsweetened apple sauce and topped it with another suggestion of brown sugar, flour and butter.  he can't stop talking about it!  i made 2 breads from the recipe - one for him and one for the neighbors.  walking out the door today he said "you can make me one of those breads any time."  now i have to make one for myself to try!!!!!!  and to boot.....it's weight watcher friendly.  this recipe was discussed at last weeks meeting.  can't wait to make it again and thank you for all the reviews, giving me the confidence to bake for mr. critical!

F-A-N-T-A-S-T-I-C!  We used spice cake mix.  We also added a crumb topping (I keep a big bag in the freezer for such a reason) The batter was very thick and made me nervous.  I was worried it would be corn muffin texture so ....(now don't freak - )  we added 1/4 cup Kraft fat free mayo.  I use this brand in any box mix we make in place of all the oil.  It makes the cake velvety and NO FAT bad stuff!  It worked perfectly here too.  Made the muffins light and fluffy.  these were so easy and fun - my daughter did it all by herself.  We will definitely be making these again!

I KNOW I CHANGED THE RECIPE AND SHOULD NOT RATE THIS A 5, BUT YOU HAVE TO READ THIS!  I used a Devil's Food cake mix, a 15 oz. can of pumpkin and I dissolved 1 tbsp. of coffee granules in 2 tbsp. hot water and added it, too!  My kids and husband are going crazy over these.  You CANNOT taste the pumpkin!  Chocolatey, dense, fudgy and with added fiber! :) How much better can you get?

I wish I could give these more stars!  They are SUPER easy and smell wonderful while they're baking.  They taste as good as they smell if not better!

The second time I baked them I changed the recipe a little.  Instead of adding ground cloves, I increased the nutmeg to 1 teaspoon.  I also added 3 tablespoons of ground flax seed, 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla, 1 cup chopped dates and 3/4 cup fresh applesauce.  Then, before baking I sprinkled the tops with a little brown sugar as other reviewers have done. I did not add any oil or eggs even though the batter did seem very dense and stiff.  The muffins were as moist as they could be both times I made them.  My daughter said they were the best muffins she's ever had in her life!
  
Thank you so much for a wonderful recipe that is easy, delicious and very flexible.  Make these - you won't be disappointed.

Awesome!! I just got through baking these muffins and I have gotta say...they are sooo simple and fast. I was a little worried at first, I thought the batter was too thick, and it felt funny not adding oil or eggs, but seriously TRUST this recipe, they are moist and tasty. Actually they are so moist, that I thought they were undercooked, but once I broke one open I saw they were completely done. So YUMMY!!

I trusted the recipe and made it as written except for using pumpkin pie spice ( 1 3/4 tsp) instead of individual spices.  I also sprinkled brown sugar splenda on top. DELICIOUS!!!! Moist, fluffy, and attractive (when smoothed with a rubber spatula before baking).  I love that they're healthy and easy!!  Thanks Cindy!

This recipe is incredible!  I have made it with spice cake, adding a little extra pumpkin pie spice, raisins and walnuts; lemon cake mix, adding nothing and getting a great light lemon/pumpkin flavored muffin; and chocolate cake mix, adding mini chocolate chips and getting a great, moist chocolate muffin without a hint of pumpkin.  I've made 6 large or 12 small muffins from the recipe. If you don't like the lumpy top, smooth out the batter with a wet finger.Thank you CindyCosta for a real keeper!!

I made these today and they are really good. I used the 29 oz can pumpkin to make more of a batter consistency and baked for 30 minutes. It made 20 muffins.

These muffins are really, really good! Made the original recipe exactly and sprinkled with brown sugar before baking. Have made these several times and people have asked for the recipe every time. Thank you for posting for this delicious and super easy recipe!!! UPDATE: If you want to cut calories even more on this recipe, use Pillsbury Reduced Sugar cake mix. I have made them several times and can not even tell the difference.

Super easy, and delicious when warm! The dough is dense, but the muffins turn out great! I used 1 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice, in place of the seperate spices listed. They still turned out great!

I made these exactly as written.  I was worried these would be a dry/terrible waste of ingredients, boy I was so wrong.  These were great right out of the oven with a little butter.  Will be making again for sure.  I get 17 good sized muffins in 1 batch.

It's funny that the reviews that say something is wrong with the recipe changed it before trying it the way it was written.  It does work without adding oil or eggs or anything else.  I love that there is a lot of pumpkin it it - I did the calculations based on the nutrition info on the can of pumpkin, and each muffin has over 75% of the RDA of vitamin A!  How's that for sneaking something healthy into your diet?  
My son is allergic to eggs, so this is a fabulous recipe to have in my file.

I did not actually use this exact recipe, but it so closely resembles a recipe I usually follow that I decided to review it.  I usually make this recipe with one box of spice cake mix and one can of plain pumpkin (not pumpkin pie mix with the spices already in it).  You just have to make sure to cook it until the top becomes browned and forms a somewhat crunchy layer on top.  I agree the properties of this recipe are strange - it's not really a dessert, but it seems too dense to be a regular bread or muffin.  Despite this, I love this recipe for its versatility and because it's so dang easy, and these make a great on-the-go breakfast and snack. Sometimes I add raisins, nuts, and if I'm going for a dessert, I'll add a crumble on top (brown sugar, butter, oats, cinnamon).  Would also be good baked with dried cranberries, or plain cream cheese icing on top.  Very moist and yummy.

With a little tweaking, this made the moistest muffins I've ever had!

When I first followed the recipe, I found the pumpkin flavor too muted, so I doubled the pumpkin and spices, and stuck with one box of cake mix.  As another reviewer noted, you have to even out the thick batter in the muffin pan - it bakes up exactly how it starts in the pan,  jagged edges and all.

The muffins are great plain, but I also added a rum icing to some of them.  Mix 1/4 c. spiced rum with 1/2 c. powdered sugar, poke holes in the warm muffins and spoon the icing over top, letting it soak in.  Makes a great holiday treat!

It definitely works with no added liquids! But if you want to add something, try mini chocolate chips- yummy!

I added some FAITH...lol and you are right, the recipe doesn't need no eggs or oil as it comes out very moisture. I do have to say that if you wait and let it cool off, add some whipping cream on top... you will be in for a treat!!

I used the spice cake mix and Libby's Pumpkin Puree, mixed the two, spooned mix into muffin tins and baked at 350* for 20 minutes.  They are the moistest muffins ever!  Super fast and easy and Super delicious!  What a find...thank you!

I love to make these, and so does my family!  I use a spice cake mix, or carrot cake mix, for more flavor.  Pumpkin pie spice can be substituted for the individual spices.  I also use a cup of milk, like the Weight Watchers 2 point pumpkin muffins (except they call for water).  They're super-moist, and the house smells fabulous whenever you make them!  My kids think they taste as good as Panera's.  Be sure to dust with confectioner's sugar for the added bakery touch.

These are GREAT. I used a spice cake mix and added one egg, mini chocolate chips, and walnuts. Made them as mini muffins for a work function and they were a huge hit. I was afraid they'd be too soft and cakey, but they were a great muffin texture.

Love these muffins! The key to light and fluffy batter is to whip the batter. I put my mixer on high for around 2 minutes to get more air into the batter.

These are very easy as far as ingredients go.  I added about 4 teaspoons of applesauce because the batter looked too dry.  It took a while to spoon the batter evenly into the cups.  I thought the taste was ok, but the hubby and co-workers loved them.  Cream cheese frosting helped the taste.

These cupcakes/muffins are really yummy. I use a spice cake mix so I don't have to add each spice. I couldn't help but thin out the batter a bit with about 1/4 cup oil and a few splahes of water, but you really don't need it. I don't know how it works, but you don't need eggs and they actually taste good! I added some peacans for protien and chocolate chips for a treat :) Try this!

I made this even EASIER... if you can believe that!

After reading how difficult the dough was to work with, I put everything into a big ziplock, squished it around, added a few raisins.  

I cut the corner off the ziplock and piped it into the muffin tins, pretty, simple and NO dishes to clean up. 

Wow!

This recipe is really great. I read through several reviews before making changes and this is what I came up with. First, I used spice cake mix instead of yellow and it eliminated the use of all the other spices that were needed for this recipe. Then, I left the eggs and oil out of the cake mix recipe and only added 1 cup of milk to make sure they would be moist enough. Finally I just used a regular can of Libby's pumpkin pie mix. That's it! They came out so delicious and moist. They melt in your mouth and they are so good for you. Hope this is helpful. :o)

I changed the yellow cake mix to a spice cake mix and omitted the spices indicated. I also added one egg and 1/3 cup of oil for moistness. I sold these muffins at our bake sale and every one of them was gone about half way through the day! These muffins have a great fal flavor!

Really easy and delicious with white chocolate chips added in. The texture is a bit gummy but delicious. 
I had a little extra batter, so I put it in a mug and baked it in the microwave for one minute. It turned out pretty good. I will use the mug idea at work with therapy patients for an easy cooking activity. :-)

The mood suddenly hit me for some pumpkin muffins and I came here for a different recipe - one I have used often with good results, but more labor involved.  Then I saw this!  I couldn't pass up something so simple.  This was SO easy and tasted good!  I made 18 regular sized muffins, and put chocolate chips into a third of them for something special for the kids.  I made a quick streusel topping for the remaining. The recipe was so simple that I just couldn't help myself and needed to do something more, lol! (2 tbsp softened butter, 3-4 tbsp brown sugar, 1/4 c. each of rolled oats and flour, sprinkling of cinnamon or whatever spices you prefer) 

If you make pumpkin muffins from scratch often, you might be disappointed if you compare the two - they will not be the same texture, heartiness, etc.  But, for something quick, these are good.

I made these using only a spice cake box mix and a can of pumpkin. They are very good with subtle spiciness. I might try amping up the flavor with additional spices next time.

These tasted kind of sticky and chewy.  I didn't care for them (thought they tasted weird), but my mother liked them.  Really easy to make, but the batter is so thick it just doesn't seem natural.  Won't be making these again, sorry.

Followed the recipe verbatim and was pleasantly surprised.  It really is that easy.  Will play around with this now as it makes an excellent foundation for other possibilities.

The recipe is simple and delicious.  But it took me about twice the time given in the recipe to bake.

I've been making these muffins for four years.  My daughter asks for them every fall.  I have tried several suggested  variations--followed recipe exactly, used pumpkin pie filling with yellow cake mix, and spice cake mix with pumpkin puree.  Everyone loved all of them!  My least favorite was the yellow cake mix with pumpkin pie filling--too sweet for me.  To deal with the thick batter, I use an ice cream scoop, muffins come out perfectly.  To lighten the muffins and to avoid flour "bombs" I sift the cake mix (and spices) before adding the pumpkin.  I sometimes also add 1 teaspoon of vanilla.  Trust the recipe!  Don't add oil or eggs!

Love these!  I make them all the time adding a cup of mini semi sweet chocolate chips.  Duncan hines mix makes a lighter more cake like muffin and puffs up nicer.

I was skeptical about the oil/eggless aspect of this recipe, but they turned out great. Very dense and moist with good flavor.

For ease alone, this recipe rates 5 stars.  There really isn't a need to add anything additional to this recipe - no eggs, water or oil.    I took the suggestions of other cooks and used a spice cake mix & canned pumpking pie fillilng.  No need for any additional spices.    I've made 3 batches thus far, adding chopped Cranraisins, and pecan chips.  They're delish!   A single recipe will make 24 mini muffins plus 2 jumbo muffins. I've used foil cupcake liners and paper ones and they've all turned out very well with no sticking.   Try glazing them with the Orange Drizzle icing found in another recipe on this site (Mini Pumpkin Muffins w/Orange Drizzle).   If you want a quick, warm treat, try microwaving for 15 seconds. Taste just like they've come right out of the oven. Cindy, thanks or sharing this wonderful, economical recipe.

For a guy who loves pumpkin, these were ok.  My kids liked them but what kids does not like muffins! They were really easy to make.  I think I will try them with a spice cake next time.

Have faith - this really is as simple as the recipe states.  No need for eggs and oil.  I whipped these up because I needed something new for lingering houseguests after Christmas and I had everything on hand.  They were gone in a flash.  The only suggestion I would have is to break up some of the lumps in the cake mix before adding the pumpkin.  It will make it easier to get the batter smooth.

I really wanted to like this recipe, and even made it twice.  I made it as written, and while the consistency is good, the flavor is not.  It tastes like a can of pumpkin and cake batter-that's it.. It gets a few stars for being very quick, but it's not very good.

I love to cook entrees and hot appetizers.  I do not get excited about dessert recipes; but this looked so simple!  (Please see Carly's review on 11/4/06.  She hit the nail on the head.)  I used two yellow cake mixes and one 30 oz can of seasoned pumpkin mix.  The first dozen I baked I did exactly as Carly recommended...just the pumpkin mix and cake mix.  They looked like smooth, un-frosted cupcakes.  On the second dozen I sprinkled just a smidgen of brown sugar on top of each one (like others have suggested) and they came out with a really nice texture on top.  They were baked at 350 degrees (middle rack) for 25 minutes.  I used 3.25 ounce souffle cups and got 30 muffins.  They are really nice and taste great.  I will be making them for my niece's baby shower brunch.  Five stars for ease and taste!!!

I agree with adding some moisture to this recipe, it would've been too dense. I only added 2 eggs to the recipe and it turned out beautiful, moist and delicious. Add some whipped cream cheese on top,...mmmm

I make these quite often at home.  I use spice cake, substitute spices for pumpkin pie spice and use 1/2 C. egg beaters (or equiv.) I measure 1/4 C. into each muffin well.  Made this way they are 2 Weight Watcher's points each.  I also like to "frost" them just before eating with (fat free) Cool Whip.  My husband hates diet foods, but I have to hide these muffins from him if I want to keep any, they are so yummy.

Although it doesn't say so in the recipe, I believe you are supposed to follow the ingredients on the box mix (adding eggs and such according to the directions.) I haven't made it yet, I'm about to experiment, so I will let everyone know how it turns out.

These are so moist and delicious!  I used carrot cake mix rather than yellow cake mix - came out a bit spicy but still very good!  I'll try it with the yellow cake mix next time.

The reviews I read were good but I really wish I had read some of the negative reviews too. The batter was quick to put together, but it was very stiff and it was very difficult to get it into the muffin pan without making a mess.  These muffins definitely do not look like the picture ... but I guess I should have read more reviews before making this recipe since there appears to be some tricks to getting these muffins to look more like a normal muffin and not like some strange spikey cup cakes.  I lot of people didn't like the texture but I didn't mind that so much because they were very moist .. more like a cupcake then a muffin.  They were just way to bland .. the muffins have the texture of a cupcake without being sweet .... which is just weird.  I love pumpkin and yellow cake mix, but together (even with the spices) these muffins just don't have much taste.  I would have given these 1 star but the recipe was realy quick and easy and I think with some tweaking the muffins could be better especially with some of the suggestions made by other reviewers ... I think I can salvage the remaining muffins by adding either cream cheese frosting or a glaze, but don't think I'll be making this recipe again.

I was surprised how tasty these were!  Was a bit concerned about the texture, but it was pretty good as well.  I used what I had on hand which was a Golden Vanilla cake mix and a teaspoon of Pumpkin Pie Spice and adding 1/3 cup ground pecans.  Gonna try with raisins next. I frosted half of them with cream cheese frosting. Thanks for sharing a simple recipe that is also quick and delicious. Sharing my pics.

My family enjoys these super moist muffin/cucpcakes. I prefer the flavor of a spice cake over the yellow cake mix and added spices combo, however.

Instead of mixing by hand, I find using a hand mixer to whip the batter yields a better texture and appearance. Since the batter is so stiff, it doesn't really settle the way other batters might. If you have stiff peaks after spooning into the muffin tin, the baked results with also have stiff peaks. Grease your fingertips and smooth the muffin tops prior to baking for a better looking muffin.

My cupboards were practically bare, but I needed a quick breakfast on a busy Saturday morning.  I didn't have eggs or milk, but I remembered hearing about a simple muffin recipe.  A quick search on allrecipes.com, and I was all set to make these delicious little muffins.  I used a butter recipe yellow cake mix and followed the directions exactly.  The result?  A moist and tasty treat that the whole family enjoyed.  Sure, you can add extras. Streusel topping?  Go for it.  Chocolate chips or cream cheese filling?  Sounds good to me.  But, if you're short on time, ingredients, or both, give this recipe a try as written.  You won't be disappointed!

I was a little leery - but these were excellent.  I used white cake mix, 1/4 cup vegetable oil, 1 egg, 1+ tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 tsp ground clove, 1/4 tsp ginger, and 2 tsp vanilla.  It made 12 large muffins and cooked for 23 mins at 350.  I would definitely make these again.  Super easy!

Holy cow!  Is this for real?  So simple I couldn't believe it.  I used white cake mix, and it took about 5 minutes to mix up.  The batter is thick, more like dough than typical cake, but turns out perfect.  I will probably use an electric beater next time, my hand kept cramping up using a spatula. Cooked for 20 min, then topped with cream cheese frosting once cool.  Pretty much the yummiest fool-proof pumpkin desert ever.

8/16/2012 - we make these 2-3 times a month now. I enlist the help of our 3yo for stirring, and then adding sprinkles for flair on top.  Probably not the healthiest, but we love these for grab and go breakfasts. Hey pumpkin is a vegetable.. right? :)

Great recipe. If you want the top of the muffins to come out smooth, try using an ice cream scoop (the kind with the trigger handle) to dispense the thick batter into the muffins tins.

These are so easy and so wonderful...I used 2 1/2 teaspoons of pumpkin pie seasoning instead of other seasonings just because that's what I had.  I've made these countless times and someone always asks me for the recipe!

I've used variations of this recipe twice now for parties and had rave reviews.  The first time I used a fresh pumpkin* instead of the canned stuff, mixed it with the yellow cake mix and 1 tsp of pumpkin pie spice. The second time I did use canned pumpkin and mixed it with a spice cake mix,  and topped them off with cream-cheese icing to be more like cupcakes.  I think the first version was a little better, one of the best muffins I've ever tasted. But both were very good. The batter is quite dense, you need to scoop it instead of pouring but, they come out great. They do rise well but not as much as other muffins which include egg so if you want the tops to spill over and have the classic muffin shape, fill the cups all the way to the top. In my opinion they taste a little better warm but my guests loved them cooled as well, I would recommend this recipe to anyone looking for something easy to do that is sure to impress.  [*to prepare fresh pumpkin, I started with a pie grade pumpkin, about 7" tall and 13" diameter, cut into 4" squares (leaving the outer peel or skin on) and placed on a cookie sheet,  put 1/8 cup water in the bottom of the cookie sheet, covered loosely with foil and baked at 400 degrees until tender and translucent. Then, cooled until able to handle, peeled off the outer skin by hand and mashed.]

Overall it's a great easy recipe.  I didn't know whether or not to follow the yellow cake directions along with everything else so instead I just added 2 eggs and 1/3 c oil and they turned out perfect.  I got a nice rounded muffin that was so moist and perfectly amazing.

This was pretty good. I did have to add and egg because I just couldn't get it to become anything like batter otherwise.  I used a spice cake recipe and it was very easy and fuss free.  My picky son won't eat them but everyone else thinks they are great.  Freeze and reheat very well.

I used spice cake mix and 2 cups of fresh pumpkin puree and they turned out GREAT!  They were moist and delicious.  They didn't last long in our house.

These were easy to make, but didn't really taste like pumpkin, more like spice cake.  But my husband and I couldn't get past the texture.  I won't make these again.

I'd rate this about 4 1/2 stars for taste and 20 stars for simplicity. I'll just round that down to 5! What a quick and easy recipe! This makes almost 5 dozen mini muffins. I sprinkled brown sugar on top, as per other suggestions. This is a must! Absolutely yummy!  I also used 1 3/4 tsp pumpkin pie spice instead of the individual spices. Do watch that the muffins cook long enough (mini's about 17 min's) as they're pretty gummy if underdone. I love the kind of recipe that you can remember correctly after just one use and share w/ anyone who asks without looking it up!  Thank you CINDYCOSTA!

Yummy and easy! I'm all for recipes that call for so few ingredients but taste so great. I do recommend storing these in an open container (or just right on the counter top) because they are sooo deliciously moist that they got a bit soggy on the tops in an air-tight bag.  Thanks for this keeper. :)

These are pretty good for the easiest recipe ever! I was skeptical, but they turned out really nice (strangely addictive...I keep eating them). Obviously not high-class, high-quality baked goods, but really yummy in a pinch. I used a vanilla cake mix because that's what I had. Followed the rest of the recipe as written. Mine took closer to 35 minutes to cook. Thanks for the recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly and was a bit skeptical when I realized how dense the batter is.  So, I came back here and read the reviews and decided to just try the batch as the recipe states.  I did smooth out the tops first before sticking them in the oven.  Let me just say... these muffins are AMAZING!!  I don't even like pumpkin that much (they are more for my husband), but I'm loving these muffins!  My husband thinks they're pretty amazing too!

You weren't kidding when you said they were moist.  The first time I made them I used spice cake mix and added some applesauce.  The second time I made them I used yellow cake mix and 2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice.  They were great both ways.  I took them to a birthday gathering and they were a hit.  My kids even like them.  I will definitely make them again.  Only three ingredients!  They get a little soggy if not all eaten up right away, so I just put them in a low heat oven for about 15 minutes.

Easy Is just the word for these muffins. and the taste well I added more spice I'm a cinnamon fan. also added pecans,and a crumb topping. They are going to Hubby's office. The taste was wonderfull firm and moist. Had some batter leftover so I added oatmeal and made into cookies, light and fluffy real cake like but the grand kids loved them. I did think of adding oil and an egg but held off, glad I did. next time I'm going to use reduced sugar cake mix.

5 stars for fast, easy, and moist. I tried the version as posted, and with the other half can of pumpkin, tried the version suggested by reviewers using spice cake mix and no added spices. I liked the spice cake one much better. Also, I used paper liners for my muffin pans, and both versions stuck to the paper. Foil liners worked best. I took both types to work, and they disappeared before I could even get one for my breakfast!! Thanks for posting!

Made a healthier variation and they were still wonderful. Added grated carrots, raisins, flax seed, and oat bran. Made 18 muffins.

I have been making this for years and love the ease of making them and the moistness!  You HAVE to make them like it states.  Do not assume that you are smarter than the recipe - they are perfect without eggs or additions.  I always make mine with a spice cake mix and a can of plain pumpkin (not pie mix).  That way the spices are already in it.  I do the minis as well and they are perfect for everything.  Bake for 10-12 minutes instead.

These muffins are great! Easy to make, they are a great base to add additional ingredients to. Next time, I will experiment by adding dried cranberries, blueberries, and pecans.  Also, contrary to the other reviews I've read, my muffins turned out quite soft. I baked them for an additional 10 mins to achieve the correct consistency.

these were very good, a review only enhanced by the novelty of them!  i find them a bit dense, but i don't mind that, and they improve the second day...i would, however, recommend sifting the cake mix as the lumps stay in the cooked muffin and are unappealing...these are lovely with butter, jam, or cream cheese!

Really enjoyed this recipe.  I used a carrot cake mix, added the recommended spices and 1/4 to 1/2 cup of water.  The recipe made 22 muffins.  So easy and very yummy.  I've shared this recipe with several friends already.

Fast to throw together.
I had no cloves and it was just fine with the cinnamon and nutmeg.

I totally thought I was going to love this recipe, but i didn't.  I did not like the dense texture, nor was the muffin appetizing to look at.  Yes it is easy peasy to make, but that is about it.  Would not make again nor would I pass on the recipe.

Great recipe- I also added 2 eggs and 1/4 c oil per other reviews and sprinked brown sugar on top of each muffin.  I also added a cup of raisins to the batter too- next time I'll try soaking the raisins in a little brandy bedore adding- can't wait to make another batch- I think I'll try making it in mini-muffin pans next time too.

I tried this recipe twice. Once with spiced cake mix and once with yellow cake mix and pumpkin pie spices. The only complaint was the texture. I baked them for 25 mins to get them done. They stuck to your teeth and roof of your mouth. Everyone said they would be great if the consitency wasn't so terrible. I think I will try adding eggs and oil.

I agree with another review. I added two eggs and 1/3 c oil, it made the muffins light and fluffy. I Think they would have been too dry without it, but it is a really handy idea (I may add more things to cake mix!)

I made this using spice cake mix and 15 oz pumpkin pie filling.  I omitted all of the spices and sprinkled some brown sugar on top as others suggested.  The muffins tasted wonderful and looked great too!  I will definitely be making these again!

SPICE CAKE MIX-PUMPKIN-COOK-EAT... 
My three year old had been begging for "pumpkin cupcakes" for days. I didn't want to go to much trouble (grin) so I thought I'd give this recipe a try. I really debated with myself as to add the extra ingredients like a lot of other reviewers suggested. But since I wanted to keep it as simple as possible I took the advice of one reviewer and "trusted the recipe" as she put it! Except I decided to make it even easier and used spice cake mix. We did frost them and they were absolutely wonderful.

I liked this they were so easy to make, but I had to change a little. I did not have puree so I used pumpkin pie filling.  Since it already had the spices I did not have to add more.  I did use 15oz instead of 10 and I used 1 egg to make a little fluffier.  I made 3 batches into mini muffins and they were gone in 3 days.  My kids friends couldn't get enough. Thanks

I think this recipe is a good idea for a time-saver, but it definitely needs some help. Like previous reviewers, I thought this needed 1/4 oil and an egg. I also doubled the spices and added vanilla as well. I used a poundcake mix, as that was all I had on hand, and I still felt that these muffins would have been rather bland without the addition of more spice. However, after those additions, I really, really like these a lot! I was looking for a recipe that replicated the pumpkin spice muffins at Dunkin' Donuts, and the taste and texture come very close. Next time I will experiment with adding a streusel topping and/or maybe some maple flavoring as well. These muffins (probably due to the cake mix I used) was not very sweet and would lend itself well to a streusel topping, since that can make an already sweet dish much too sweet.

I was looking for a quick, simple dessert to make with the few random ingredienta I happened to have in the house, and this was perfect! Based on the other reviews, I added one egg, 1/4 cup of oil, and a generous dose of apple pie spice to taste. I then folded in a few handfuls of toasted almond slivers, butterscotch chips, and dried cranberries. The recipe made 14 large muffins that puffed nicely on top (which I aprinkled with sugar and cinnamon before baking) and were very moist. It took 32 minutes for them to cook all the way through, but the wait was worth it - my family loves these and I will definitely make them again!

These were really easy and good. I would add more spices next time because they didn't have a whole ton of pumpkin flavor.  It's nice how none of the ingredients are perishable.

The spices and pumpkin were good.  The texture is gluey and nasty. They have no muffin or cake texture.

I will start by saying that I am a really good cook but, I CANNOT bake. Everything bake turns out wrong; like some mutant version of what it should have been. Imagine my amazement when I gave this recipe a try and the results were spectacular! I used a carrot cake box mix and added about 1/4 cup of apple sauce. Went over like a dream! I am going to attempt this again with chocolate cake mix and chocolate chips. Being adventurous, I know, but if the results are as good as what I experienced with this recipe I am all in!

I tried this recipe this evening. I was looking for a way to use up some canned pumpkin I had in my pantry. I did not have baking soda on hand, so it eliminated most of my options. When I saw this recipe I was so excited. I read review after review positively raving about this recipe. I have to admit I was skeptical because of the ingredients, but I had them on hand, so why not try it. Ugh, I feel so bad. I have never written a poor recipe review :(  I wanted to like these I really did! I followed the recipe to a T. Really though how could you mess this up, it's so unbelievably simple. I kept adding more and more cooking time, because the mushy almost raw texture was something I could not palate. No matter how much cooking time I added it was just an awful texture. I don't mind dense baked goods. Using whole wheat and healthier ingredients can yield very dense breads, cookies, etc. That was not the case here. Just EXTREMELY mushy? I can't even describe it. My family of five tried them and did not come back for more. Will not be making these again.

I tried the recipe with both yellow cake mix and a spice cake mix as others suggested. I like the spice cake a little better. Both cake mixes were good. The second time I made them I added the cake mix to the pumkin a little bit at a time to make for easier mixing. Next time I will add walnuts and raisns to the recipe. Very good and easy to make.

I used a Dark Chocolate Fudge cake mix and the 15 oz can of Pumpkin.  Added about 1/2 c. of water and a handful of mini semi-sweet chocolate chips.  YUMMY!  Very moist and rich  - a great treat for my children's lunch boxes.  I've used spice cake in the past and it turned out great as well.

These were fantastic!  I kept the recipe simple, yellow cake mix, 15 oz. pumpkin filling, chocolate chips, a little apple pie spice, and cinnamon.  Half way through I pulled them out and shaped them and drizzled brown sugar over them.  Can't wait for my husband to take them to his work tomorrow!

This was very easy to make but a little on the bland side.  I even used 2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice.  A very good start to a good muffin, I think next time i'll add either, nuts, raisins or chocolate chips.

These are soo good and so easy.  Great for using up an extra can of pumpkin.  I frosted some with cream cheese frosting but my husband stated that it isn't necessary since it takes away from the pure deliciousness of the muffins, I agree!  I will be making these again this week just cuz they were so yummy and so easy!

This recipe can be made VERY easy, using only 3 ingredients: 1 Yellow cake mix, 1 can of pumpkin puree, and 1 bag of Hershey's cinnamon chips. Stir together (stiff batter) put in lined muffin pan, Bake 350 degrees about 20-25 min. Very moist and freeze well.

These muffins were absolutely delicious!  I used the spice cake mix and one can of pumpkin per other reviews and I am impressed.  I made mini muffins and took some to a party, they disappeared in no time.  You cannot beat the simplicity of this recipe.  YUM!!!

So easy and absolutely delicious!!!  I have spent so much time making muffins totally from scratch and these are just as good!  The only problem is you cannot eat just one.  I topped them with cream cheese icing and a candy corn.  Awesome!!!

I LOVE this recipe!!! I used a package of spice cake mix and a can of plain pumpkin puree. Just to "kick it up a notch" I mixed in some macadamia nuts and sprinkled splenda brown sugar on top of each one before baking. I took mine out at exactly 20 minutes and they were PERFECT. Super soft and moist.

This recipe was super easy and turned out delicious! I made a couple of changes to it that, I think, helped a lot. I used spice cake instead of yellow cake and I added one egg to the batter to give it a smoother consistency. I also combined brown sugar, confectioners sugar and pumpkin pie spice in a bowl and then sprinkled it over the muffins before baking. So good!

I can't believe how good these turned out.  They puffed up like those fancy muffins sold at the deli.  I used fresh pumpkin, doubled the spices and added pecans in the batter and did a brown sugar topping.

I've made these muffins for years, it's actually an old ww recipe and very low cal.  I make as is w/ any cake flavor mix, my favorite is dark choc. (no spices). They are very dense, moist and tend to leave peaks on the top.  If you prefer a smoother top add 1/4 cup water and this should give you the smoothness your looking for.  Red velvet and lemon are great as well, you don't even notice the pumpkin flavor.

I made a recipe like this last year but did not call for spices. Instead it used cinnamon chips. I had never  heard of them until then. Easy and a hit whenever served.

These muffins are AMAZING!!!  We were looking for a yummy pumpkin chocolate chip muffin recipe, so I added about 1/2 cup of chocolate chips to the batter.  Also, we grow banana squash in our garden, so I cooked that and added that in instead of the pumpkin, and we couldn't tell the difference!  They were delicious!!!

SO easy!  It definitely sounded strange but I had faith and went with it.  I used pumpkin with a spice cake mix and took them on a camping trip as a hearty breakfast cake or a sweet snack.  Add nuts and they are even more hearty.  Cream cheese frosting makes them like dessert.

I love this muffin! It is soooo easy, moist, and delicious. Plus, you can make the batter in 2 minutes. I used a spice cake mix since I had one on hand. I added cinnamon, nutmeg, and a little vanilla extract for some extra flavor. These were AWESOME and I plan to make them often for a quick, healthy, breakfast.

These get 5 stars because they are easy and tasty.  I used a vanilla cake mix, 1 can of pumpkin, 2 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice and a little over 1/4 cup applesauce as suggested in another review.  I read one review where they said they didn't rise at all but mine rose very nicely. Very moist as well. These are definitely a do over!

These muffins are the best!  So easy and yummy!  Great for my kids who are allergic to eggs.  I used a little pumpkin pie spice and sprinkled the tops with some cinnamon sugar.  I made them for my son's class last Thanksgiving and they were a huge hit!  Thanks for sharing!

These were a big hit in our house and karate class.  We have allergies to dairy, eggs, and nuts so this was super easy since I did not have to hope modifications changed the recipe at all as I just used (our safe box mix) Duncan Hines Butter Golden cake box.

Love these muffins! They are a family favorite. I also use spice cake instead of yellow cake. You can also use pumpkin pie filling instead of regular puree for a little more spice.

This is a real winner! I upped the spices and added a 1/4 cup of applesause to loosen the batter a bit then topped them with oats for a bit more fiber. This recipe could not be easier. The muffins were quite soft and sweet.

It is delicious exactly as written.  I have used every kind of cake mix there is, and even left out the spices on occasion...  They have all come out delicious... my favorite was using Angel Food Cake mix -- yum!  This is a FABULOUS recipe!  I make mini-muffins for my 2 year old everyday for breakfast and it's the only thing he'll eat (literally) at that time of the morning.  I have even added a few extra "nutrient ingredients" for added vitamin/mineral punch from time to time, and as long as you don't veer too far from the original recipe it still comes out great (1/2 tsp Nutritional Yeast add all our B vitamins for the day).  One batch makes 48 mini-muffins for us (two mini-muffin trays full), and I bake for 7-12 minutes and they are delicious.  I freeze the rest for the week, and they freeze great too.  Amazing recipe!! I'd give it 10 stars if I could!

This recipe is insanely wonderful.  True to other reviews the muffins are ridiculously simple to make.  I now have made it with a white cake mix and added pumpkin pie spice, and the spice cake version mix (no added spice) and both were terrific.  I made it once with 1 egg and 6 ounces of evaporated milk and it turned out cake like, but yummy.  A different time I also once added in a cup of soy milk, and still fantastic.  Usually I use my mixer to blend with great results.  Without liquid add-ins the batter is very thick, but excellent.  Once I hand-blended and had annoying cake mix clumps to contend with, so I will always use my kitchenaid mixer- just be careful to not over mix.  Others reviewed that these stay moist for days, and I completely agree.  I have not tried freezing/thawing but I expect that this would also be just fine as well.  This recipe was so good I just picked up a case of pumpkin to make sure I have it on hand for this recipe.  If you are a pumpkin fan also try the pumpkin soup recipe on this site as well.

This is a great recipe! So easy and yummy! I increase the amount of spices a little and always make them as mini muffins (cook for about 10 minutes). My kids love them.

Only thing I'd suggest is that you mix the dry spices with the cake mix before adding the puree to make sure they are evenly mixed.  I didn't have cloves so I substituted allspice and still LOVED the muffins!  This is a keeper!

DON'T ADD ANYTHING.  Don't fret about the dough being 'too tough' I have worked with biscuit dough that is much more of a pain, this was no sweat.    Also, if you are annoyed at the appearance smooth them out with a knife of spatula so they puff up nicely.

Wow!  These came out perfect!  I was shocked at how it only took the two main ingredients.  I did pie filling, so it had the spices.  All I had to do was mix the pie filling and cake mix.  Then I topped them with cream cheese frosting, YUM!  Next time I want to try a streusel topping.  I love these.

SO yummy! my kids licked the bowl clean!!! they absolutely loved it, as did hubby and I!   We added one egg for added moisture. And, did mini muffins, as I feel they taste better and made our own cream cheese icing piped on the top.   Went over VERY well! :)  Thanks!

My husband has a catering company, and as a special request, the client wanted Pumpkin Muffins. I used this recipe and everyone raved about them, (even our chef, who is a CIA graduate!) So we will definitely be using this recipe again. Too easy and good not to!

Used a spice cake mix so only added a good dash of cinnamon instead of the spices.  Love these muffins for breakfast; not too sweet and very moist.  I'm sure to make these often to take to work for coffe break time.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made this for Easter and everyone LOVED them.  No one could believe that I used only 2 ingredients.  I used spice cake mix and a 15oz. can of pumpkin puree with the spices already in it.  They were yummy!!!

I'm giving this an extra star because its really really easy, but I'm somewhat on the fence for this one.  They don't really taste like muffins, there more like a combination of cake and pumpkin pie filling.  They also turned out really dense and doughy.  I followed this recipe exactly, but I doubled the spices.  I think I would go with what another review said and use chocolate next time.

These were amazing! I took the advise of some other reviewers and added a little more spice. To make the tops look nice, I used the Pampered Chef large scoop, and dropped the scoopfuls into the muffin tins. It worked great!

These muffins are so moist and delicious.  I used spice cake so I didn't add any of the spices in the recipe.  Sprinkled some brown sugar on top before baking.  My family loved them and they are super easy to make.

I first started making these way back when I was using Weight Watchers to lose weight. I used a spice cake mix instead, added a little plain lowfat yogurt and a handful of raisins or chopped apple. Sometimes, I even used dried cranberries. Tasty!

I made this with carrot cake mix. These are great. didn't add additional ingredients. next time will probably add chopped pecans or walnuts and sneak in finely shredded carrots. to make these look better i swirl a toothpick in the top-gives it a more professional look.

I used a box of moist yellow cake mix and a can of (unspiced) pumkin. I didn't use any additional spices. I was shocked at how these turned out! Simple and wonderful, my family continues to ask for them. I also added cream cheese icing to the top of the muffins. Super easy and fast!

Good in a pinch.  I used a spice cake mix and the muffins were very moist.  I needed a quick dessert (it baked during dinner) and this fit the bill as well as making the house smell yummy!  Taste was good for so few ingredients- although eye appeal leaves something to be desired. I'm glad I tried them and will make them again when I need something quick and easy.

YES THIS RECIPE IS DENSE...BUT THEY ARE LOWFAT!!  GREAT!!  I love pumpkin and decided to try this recipe on others using spice cake mix and a can of pumpkin!  They loved them.  For those that need that extra bit of sugar I add cream cheese frosting.

I needed to make a healthy-ish and orange snack for my son's Halloween party tomorrow, so I decided to give these a try.  I just tried one (you know, to make sure they weren't *bad*) and I am actually quite surprised by how good they are!  I did use a spice cake as recommended by many others, and I sprinkled a little brown sugar on top too.  I will definately make these again, especially because to someone not in the know, it looks like I actually BAKED, instead of mixed 2 things together!

These came out really well! I took other reviewers' advice and added an egg and a splash of milk. I liked it with the yellow cake mix but it was even better with spice mix. I used pumpkin pie filling to avoid having to add the spices, although I like mine with just a bit more spice, so I will probably add extra next time. The recipe is definitely a keeper!

I made 2 batches, one with devils food cake and one with spice cake. I omitted all the other ingredients except the pumpkin and cake mix but added an egg white and a little bit of milk.  The spice cake ones are awesome!  Would be good as a bread instead of muffin with a little butter. Added choc chips to the devils food and they are really sinful and moist.  Definitely WAY better than I expected. I am not sure how it would taste with yellow cake, but I highly reccomend the spice cake!

I also used spice cake mix, omit the spices and added just a 1/4 cup skim milk to make the mixing easier. We love them! I send them to school for class snack and had several of the moms ask for the recipe. This is also a great recipe for kids with egg allergies.

As weird as it sounds, this recipe also works with chocolate devils food cake mix, without the added spices--just pumpkin and cake mix.  The kids don't know they are healthier than cupcakes--they eat them up.

Sooo good! My kids love them, adults love them...they're easy and good for you, what could be better? In fact I know that these are part of a famous weight-loss group's plan. DON'T add eggs and oil; that defeats the whole purpose! These are delicious without them!

Doubly delicious using carrot cake mix!  I've made this in cake form, also, and it's so good.  You can play with the recipe... use pumpkin and carrot cake mixes, add a little oil and egg or not... the possibilities are endless and always perfect.

These were too dense for my taste.  Actually, I found another recipe that worked GREAT!  Try this:

1 box spice cake mix
1 can pumpkin puree
1/2-3/4 cup water

Mix together - be sure to get out all the lumps.  Put in muffin cups (I make 24 smaller muffins - they don't rise much.)  Bake according to the cupcake directions on the cake box.  Easy.  Yummy.  Healthy.

These are so easy! I just used what I had on hand. 1 can of pumpkin, 1 yellow cake mix, 2 tablespoons of cinnamon and some honey for extra sweetness. I mixed them very, very well with my handmixer. I baked them in mini-muffin pans (make sure to grease the pans very well), they were so cute! Once they were cooled I flipped them over and stuffed them with cream cheese icing using a simple piping bag. I took them to work and the buzz spread quickly, they were gone in less than an hour.

i loved the simplicity of this recipe.  at first i thought the mixture would be too dry, but the pumpkin puree ended up moistening the batter very well when i just kept mixing.

Super easy and super tasty. I made one batch exactly as the recipe states and then another with walnuts stirred in and ontop... walnuts gave it an extra bit of texture that put them over the top. I also sprinkled a tad bit of brown sugar ontop as others suggested. I wouldnt make them without that!

Very good as is except in a review I read they added brown sugar on top for a little extra crunch, that was a GREAT IDEA! Put these muffins over the top. Also, these need to cook for maybe 30 min. or a little longer. Today I made these muffins and I forgot the brown sugar and they were no where near as good as the first time I made them with the brown sugar.

I love this recipe, it was so moist and the flavor was really good! I used Libby's canned pumpkin, it worked really well. If your muffins turn out dense then it might be the brand of pumpkin you're using. I also used cinnamon chips in addition to the cinnamon in the recipe, this added alot to the flavor.

I actually doubled this recipe and added 2 cans of pumpkin pie mix instead of the ground cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves. It was great. I baked some in a mini muffin pan for 12 minutes and them baked some in a regular muffin pan for the time suggested. Before I put them in the oven I sprinkled the top with a mixture of cinnamon and sugar. The muffins came out very yummy.

These muffins are good, though I took advice from other reviews.... I used one egg and 1/4 cup oil. I did not have clove, so I also used a bit more cinnamon and nutmeg for added flavor.

This was excellent!  I used butter-yellow mix and although the recipe didn't call for it, I found that I had to add two eggs and a tbs. or two of water. The batter otherwise seemed too dense and dry. They came out perfectly! I recommend them with the brown-sugar cream cheese icing also found on allrecipes!

For those who were confused, you are not making the cake batter and then adding the other ingredients. The can of pumpkin provides all the moisture! I used a spiced cake mix instead of the yellow cake mix and they turned out GREAT. I would use 1/2 a teaspoon of cinnamon though. They were very moist and taste great with a cup of coffee!!

Mmmmmm these turned out yummy, I was a little skeptical at first but once I ate one it was tasty. 
They were so moist and so easy to make I made a second batch with extra pumpkin pie spice, walnuts, and craisans. Made these for the morning and they taste even better reheated the next day!

We used a white cake mix, 1 can pumpkin,  1 tsp. of Pumpkin Spice and 1/2 tsp. of Cinnamon.  Baked at 350 for 20 minutes in glass 9X12.  Just used what we had on hand and it was perfect!

Considering the simplicity of this recipe, it is awesome!  I used a spice cake mix instead of measuring in my own spices.  I made it with my preschool kiddos, and they loved it!

I just pulled these gorgeous little delights out of the oven. Super easy recipe to make. BE BRAVE and follow the recipe and not be tempted to follow the cake mix directions. These muffins are dense in a "substantial" way, and extremely moist. Amazing! I used fresh sweet potato puree that I had on hand from another recipe. I also left them in the oven for an additional 10 minutes...my choice...not because they needed to cook longer. I prefer the tops to be a bit more golden. I used an Immaculate Baking Company yellow cake mix. I plan to have my nephew try this recipe during one of our baking classes together. Enjoy!!!

I used the spice cake mix cinnamon and nutmeg.  I eliminated the cloves.  I also sprinkled brown sugar on top to give it a sweet crunch.  Very moist and delicious warm.

Was quick recommend smoothing them out a bit in the cups cause mine came out a bit bumpy. It was very thick used table spoon to fill cups. And next time gonna try spiced cake w/pumpkin and skip spices. But my kids really liked them and I like how quick and how cheap and for me made dozen and half not 12 but may have medium muffin tins.

These are great.  A boy in my daughter's preschool class had severe allergies to peanuts, eggs, and milk, so finding a recipe I could make for my snack week was difficult.  The kids all loved these and at home I make them with cream cheese frosting.  Very good and easy recipe!

I cannot tell a lie - I was worried when I started mixing the batter it was so tight.  I added a 1/4 c sour cream and a couple of tablespoons of flax seed (for health)and they are moist and delicious and will be a regular visitor to our house! I almost added a couple of eggs but read the review that says DON'T ADD EGGS so I didn't.  Glad I listened.

Great recipe!! No need for eggs or oil, just follow the recipe. Adding nuts would be good, but they are yummy without them.

Thanks for the recipe. I wanted to mix a box of yellow I had with some pumpkin puree and wanted a head start on portions- landed on this recipe of yours which worked out great. I had two boxes Jiffy cake mix- one yellow and one apple muffin so I used those. I did notice the lack of eggs, oil or milk, which is great- I've done the same myself. Here though, I wanted them added so I added two eggs and a quarter cup olive oil. Also about doubled up on spices. Made fabulous soft, tall and moist muffins.

Love this recipe, especially when we need a little something different for breakfast.  I also just use a spice cake and omit the spices--super easy.  My 2 small children love them.

I only had a white cake mix on hand and no nutmeg.  After reading some of the reviews, I added one teaspoon cinnamon and one teaspoon pumpkin pie spice.  I had cloves on hand, so I put in a dash, but you wouldn't have to.  I also added on tbl oil and 2 tbl water.  I had walnuts, so I threw them in too.  Then I smoothed out the tops by running the back of a tablespoon around the muffins after filled.  I also sprinkled them generously with brown sugar before baking, following another reviewer's advice.  I baked them the full 22 minutes and they were awesome!! They taste and looked great.  They would be good enough to take to a bake sale!!

These were delicious, soft, and so easy to make!  We thought about using pumpkin pie spice instead of the three spices mentioned, but stuck with the original recipe and it turned out great!  The next time we added some chocolate chips which really made them outstanding! Mmmm!!!

This is a great base recipe, after reading suggestions these were the changes I made: 1 box spiced cake mix, 2 eggs, 1/3c oil, 3tbsp brown sugar, extra nutmeg and cinnamon to taste and 1 peeled & grated zucchini (for an extra healthy boost) 
They came out moist and light and YUMMY!

Only change I made was to add 1 cup of applesauce per other reviews.  Used the lowest fat yellow cake mix I could find (1.5 grams).  Made mini muffins. Very moist - so yummy - my daughters love them!!

We've made these a dozen or more times--we have a good friend who has milk and egg allergies!  SO GREAT AND EASY!  I use a store-bought chocolate cake mix (instead of yellow) and don't mention the pumpkin--and the kids love my "Ugly Chocolate Muffins."  I've never figured out how to make the dough (and thus final product) look pretty, but they taste great. I've tried it with and without the spices--it's better with,  but kids still like it without.  Spice cake is a better option than yellow, but chocolate gets the best feedback from my kids. We have also, on occasion, added mini chocolate chips with success.   
However, once I tried substituting a gluten-free cake mix and it went terribly (didn't cook right, had weird consistency, and the kids refused to eat them).  Overall, a HUGE success!

The trick is to beat on medium speed until fluffy, the recipe is not flawed it is fabulous; as is!! If you want to add something, add ground flaxseed and a little plain greek yogurt for protein and fiber.

I used a sugar free cake mix (yellow) and 1 can of pumpkin puree.  I doubled the spices and added 1 egg, pecans and dried cranberries.  I also whipped the batter with my mixer and folded in the nuts and cranberries. They baked in 20 minutes and are delicious!

Yummy muffins! I read the other reviews and since the batter was so thick I too added 1 c. Applesauce to my pumpkin and spice cake mix, spices I used were 1 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp nutmeg. I tasted the batter and was very pleased. My finished muffins are very good! I give this recipe 5 stars. It's quick,easy and very tasty

I'm giving this 3 stars for how easy it was to put together, and it did smell really good when it was baking. If you can't have eggs, or need a low fat recipe then this might be for you. However I did not like the results of this recipe, it tasted like something was missing (maybe because there is)! I made it exactly as written with one exception (going by many reviews), I used a spice cake mix everything else was to a T. I do think this recipe has potential, maybe add an egg or two, some vanilla, and I think it needed a little brown sugar (spices were good, but there was no sweetness). But I'm a firm believer in reviewing a recipe as (or as close as) written, otherwise it's not the recipe. Sorry Cindy but thanks anyways, it was worth a try.

Awesome way to use up leftover cans of pumpkin. The batter does come out a little thick, so using a pastry bag to get it into the muffin cups would be handy. You could actually make this even easier believe it or not by using two teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice instead of three separate spices.

I had a butter yellow cake mix so I used that for this recipe. These pumpkin muffins are YUMMY, MOIST, everything I was looking for this morning! When I baked them I baked half with brown sugar sprinkled on top (as another rater suggested) which added just a bit of a crunch on top. Either way you bake these delcious EASY PUMPKIN MUFFINS; they are YUMMY! Try them, you will not be disappointed!!! This recipe is definitely a keeper!!! Thank you Cindy Costa for sharing : )

Made these with a spice cake mix and 1/2 of a 29 oz. can of pumpkin while making pumpkin bread as well.  I did add a little pumpkin pie spice b/c we like pumpkin with lots of flavor!  My batter was dense making it super easy to scoop with an ice cream scoop but they did not turn out dry and dense after baking.  I cooked mine for 22 minutes and they came out extremely moist.  Though they tested done I had to take a second look b/c they were almost too moist when we were eating them.  Sure enough they were cooked through.  Yummy little muffins.  Love the ease of the recipe!  Enjoy!

Super easy!!! I did like a few before me and added one small cup of applesauce to the recipe. It was perfect. I also made a little topping for the muffins (T of the cake mix, some brown sugar, a few pecans and T of butter chopped in the mini chopper). So moist and so good!!

These are amazingly delicious!!! The only thing I did different was add a 1/2 cup of applesauce. My husband asked me if I had the ingredients to make another batch because he doesn't think these will last the next 24 hours with guest coming over! Enjoy!

I just made these and they are delicious.  Usually I am a 100% from scratch baker, but decided to try these because I wanted something quick.  I added 1 one egg, used 2 tablespoons pumpkin pie spice and 1 teaspoon vanilla.

I just made them,,, and DELISH!!! I am allergic to eggs and was SO excited to see this recipe...I amde it exactly as the recie called for and 1 addition...1/2c water as another reviewer suggested. This is by far THE best....I used a carrot cake mix and it had all the flavor just right....I also made 6 Muffins/Cupcakes call it what you may...The 6 servings is done by using a extra larrge muffin tin...Once I place the batter in by spoon I tapped the tray on the counter to even it out and baked... Have Faith and give it a go...Use Spice cake or Carrot Cake...Looking forward to trying the CHocolate with Pumpkin next..Great wayt o get kids their veggies and me too ;)

Amazing!  I cannot wait to make them again.  I made mini muffins and I used Spice cake mix.  Then on a few of them I put cream cheese frosting on.  Delish!  Someone suggested using Devil's food cake, that is what I'm going to try next.  Thank you SO much the this delicious and EASY recipe.

These were so easy and SO good. My five year old daughter kept asking for more. So easy that they will be my next go-to recipe for any occasion that requires me to bring baked goods!

There have been several comments about how they look. Toy do have to smooth out the batter if you want them pretty, but if you leave them "rustic" you end up with yummy crunchy bits on top!

I added a little extra pumpkin, and about 3/4 cup quick cooking oats. They were delicious! Made about 18 medium sized muffins.

OMG!  These were amazing.  I read some reviews re: the spices but decided to follow the original recipe and I think it was bang on.  I added a little more pumpkin and some apple sauce to thin the batter and ended up cooking them a few extra minutes.  I didn't make them as large though and ended up with a dozen and a half.  Love the ease, timing and flavour of these muffins!

Light, fluffy, flavorful, and truly easy! I used 1 1/2 cups fresh (cooked & pureed) pumpkin, 1/4 c. dried cranberries (Craisins), and accidentally measured a 1/2 instead of 1/4 tsp cloves - not a bad mistake! These are delicious and almost qualify for cupcakes. The recipe made 17 muffins instead of the 12 it said, perhaps because of my use of fresh pumpkin? Not complaining!

Not well received here, too sweet and cupcake like, I guess we like our muffins more "hearty". I can see why some said "non-muffin" lovers liked these. And the pumpkin was too light a flavor, we love pumpkin, but could barely taste it.

I found this recipe but didn't have a yellow cake mix BUT did have a chocolate cake mix.  I decided to experiment and used that!  I still added the cinnamon and added some dark chocolate chips.  I thought they were very good (very moist and chocolatey) My daughter liked them but my son (17) knew there was pumpkin in them and decided he didn't like them. (I don't think you could even tell that there was pumpkin in them!!!) LOL

Such an easy recipe! Just cake mix and pumpkin pure! Everyone loved them at my sond school play. I added brown sugar and white chips on top for some yummy crunch. For thanksgiving I'm going to try spice cake mix and the pumpkin pure... so it will be just a 2 item recipe. Awesome! That's why it deserves 5 stars for such a 1 2 3 steps recipe!

This is an awesome recipe, but I did tweak it a bit.  I added about a half of a can (pumpkin can) of water and 1/4 cup of oil.  I also used pumpkin pie spice (and a bunch of it).  I mixed in some softened cream cheese into the batter and added some brown sugar on top so they'd have a nice crunch.  They were PERFECT! They taste like autumn.  My family LOVES them too.  Thanks for the recipe!

these are great exactly as written (no eggs or oil, really) - I used a spice cake mix & pumpkin pie spice.  ONE WARNING, if you decide to use a streusel topping -- go lightly.  I used 1 tablespoon per muffin and the muffins would not come out of the pan. They were just top heavy -I lost a whole batch except for the 3 I did not top.  the 2nd batch I added 1/2 c applesauce & some dried cranberries - frosted with cream cheese frosting.  Very yummy.

These are the best! I took another reviewers suggestion and added a small container of applesauce. I then doubled the batter, this made me 12 large muffins and 2 mini loaf pans. The last thing that I did was to add a streusal topping. My family devoured them!

I have to give these muffins a 5 just because they are so ridiculously easy to make!  Sure, I've had better pumpkin muffins--but given the minimal time investment, these are well worth making.  I usually throw in a handful of dried cranberries and maybe some chopped pecans, just because they go so well with pumpkin.  I almost always do some type of glaze for my muffins, and for these I make one with powdered sugar & bourbon.  My family is pretty particular about the quality of the baked goods they'll eat & I've been asked to make this several times.

Soooo easy!  I made this with a box of Pillsbury's sugar free yellow cake mix and a freshly cooked pie pumpkin and 2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice.  Before cooking I wet my fingers and smoothed the tops a little and came up with beautiful muffins!  They are very moist and quite tasty as well.  I think I've just found a new "go to" fall recipe.

I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE pumpkin muffins and bread this time of year!  This is a GREAT recipe, SO easy, quick (made them on a busy "school" morning!) and amazing that it actually works w/out eggs, oil, etc.  I was skeptical, but gave it a try, and will be using over and over! :D I do think next time I will try with the Spice Cake mix for a bit more spice....will be fun to experiment!

i made it just the way the recipe said and it came out fab. The batter is really sticky, so a mixer helps. This is great, for the price of maybe 2 muffins at Dunkin I made 9 jumbos of these

Being that nutmeg and cloves are an acquired taste that I have never acquired, I just used what I use in my pumpkin pies - cinnamon & ginger. I also added a little almond extract just because we loooove it. Not wanting them quite so dense and sticky, I did add an egg and about 2 T melted butter. After baking I brushed the tops with melted butter and dipped them in a cinnamon-sugar mixture. The came out extremely moist and delicious, without being so gooey & sticky as when I haven't added the egg or butter. 
These may be healthier than regular cupcakes, but don't fool yourselves - this isn't health food!

Fantastic and beyond easy! Upon suggestions of other members, I used a spice cake mix that was extra moist. I added a couple tablespoons applesauce and mixed it on medium speed for 2 min. These were incredibly moist and absolutely delish! It took longer to preheat my oven than to make these muffins! Fantastic! Thank you.

Made this with a German chocolate cake mix and skipped the spices. Quick and easy for the kids to mix up, and tastes great! Like a gooey cakey brownie, couldn't even taste the pumpkin. My kids couldn't get enough...will be keeping this one on hand.

These are great, especially if you're watching your weight.  I used spice cake mix at the suggestion of another reviewer and they turned out very good...delicious and guilt free!

Used ALK5B's suggestions + 1/2 cup of dried cranberries and they were moist and delicious. Also, it made 19 muffins in a regular muffin tin.

The results when following the recipe reminds me of a cookie gone wrong.  You know the biscuit recipe on Bisquick..here it is.  And if presentation means anything to you be sure to shape the batter once in cups..otherwise they will bake exactly as you see..they don't rise at all either.  Taste is ok..but bland.  Easy is the key word here.

I also used the spice cake box mix and used pumpkin pie spice rather than the indiv. spices. Turned out great and everyone loves them! The first time I made them, we ate left overs for several days afterward and I didn't notice any extra wetness as others mentioned. I live in AZ which is really dry though, so not sure if that makes a difference.

LOVE THESE! I was a little afraid of the consistency as well but TRUST THE RECIPE! Also, I used Butter Pecan cake mix (YUM!) and made mini muffins topped with cream cheese frosting to take into the office.  Big Hit!

I have never written a recipe review before, but this time I really felt compelled because these muffins are delicious!  I used the yellow cake mix, canned pumpkin pie filling (so you don't have to add the cinnamon and other spices) and sprinkled powdered sugar on top and they are mmma mmm good!  Don't add any other ingredients as they really don't need any!

Five stars for how easy these muffins are to make!  I used a spice cake mix so did not have to add any additional spices ... two ingredients is all you need: the mix & pumpkin!  Although the batter is very thick the muffins do turn out very light and cake like.

These were wonderful!  We used lemon cake mix, fresh pie pumpkins, and added 1/2 tsp. vanilla and a 1/4 tsp. cumin, which you don't taste but adds a nice warmth.  The muffins came out incredibly soft and tasty.  I'm not a huge pumpkin fan but these were just amazing.  For those that want to use fresh pie pumpkins: I split one in half, removed the seeds and stringy stuff, and then baked for about an hour in a covered dutch oven with water at the bottom but not in the pumpkin.  (Cooking time will vary depending on the size of the pumpkin.)  This is extra work but worth the time.

I didn't really like these too much, only because I cannot figure out why my pumpkin creations never come out how I want them to. The boyfriend and roommate loved them, and now the boyfriend keeps asking for them. So they are a hit with him, which means they work for me. ( I did use white cake mix because it was all i had on hand, and it worked perfectly fine)

Just took these muffins out of the oven. I couldn't wait until they cooled off and took a bite out of one. They came out very moist and delicious. I think they will taste even better spreaded with butter. I also used a box of spice cake mix and a can of pumpkin puree and left out the spices. I also added one cup of chopped nuts and dusted the tops with a mixture of cinnamon and sugar. Yum! Will make these again.

What a fantastically simple recipe!  I used spice cake mix, plain pumpkin puree and sprinkled a little brown sugar on top before baking.  They came out moist, springy and delicious.  I can't wait to try this trick with other types of cake mixes and purees.  TIP:  Because the batter will be extremely thick, use a spatula to spoon and smear the mixture into your muffin cups.

Excellent basic recipe! So quick and easy. I used a spice cake mix, added 1/2 c of ground flax for a boost of fibre, and a 1/2 c of golden raisins. I also used prepared pumpkin spice instead of the individual spices. I topped each muffin with three pecan halves - this really added to the visual interest, as they roast and turn a deep brown, adding a beautiful nutty flavor. Rave reviews from family and friends. THis will become a staple.

These definitely live up to their name:  Easy.  I prepared them exactly as the recipe stated other than using a mini muffin pan (baked for about 10 minutes).  They weren't the best muffins I've ever had, but I'll probably make them again just due to the simplicity.

GREAT basic recipe.  Can't be easier.  I used a box of spice cake mix and a can of pumpkin puree.  No additional spices needed and no need for oil, egg, etc.  The only thing I added besides the cake mix and pumpkin was a handful of choc. chips AND a handful of butterscotch chips.  YUMMY!  *10/21/10 I thought I would come back and add to my review that I have made these muffins now once a week for the last month!  They are that good and easy!

I did not follow the recipe completely but catered it more towards the chocolate lovers ~ they are amazing!  Here is what I did: I used a chocolate cake mix instead of yellow, I added 1 1/2 cups chocolate chips, only 1 tsp of pumpkin pie spice, and then after they baked I drizzled the tops with cream cheese frosting. These were so moist and delicious...I definitely recommend this version!

I used a spice cake mix and pumpkin puree, no added eggs or oil. I also added about 1/4c oat bran, to boost its fiber a bit (without tasting too grainy). The muffins rose beautifully and were moist and fluffy. I used an ice cream scoop for uniform muffins. A slightly raised scoop yielded an even dozen. Easy and quick.

I have been making these for awhile now.  I use spice cake mix ( all the spices are already in there), one can of pumpkin and one cup of water.  They are fabulous! Made them last night for breakfast this morning, my kids think they are the best ever and have asked for this instead of cake for their birthday! Will try some add in ideas for a variation!  Only complaint I have is not being able to find canned pumpkin all year round!

This is a big hit in my home with the kids. Don't add eggs or oil, it makes it way to moist. Because the mix is very dense you don't even have to put it in a cupcake sheet. You can drop them right on the cookie sheet and make cookie "mounds". Add some butterscotch chips in the mix for fun and drizzle with royal icing, Yummy!

Like the other review said HAVE A LITTLE FAITH! This is the BEST recipe EVER! Thank you whoever discovered this. My fifteen month old was wild over this, and my husband, who absolutely HATES anything pumpkin ate 6 muffins...good thing they are low in cholesterol! I LOVE THIS RECIPE, and if anyone know of a recipe that uses a different puree, PLEASE POST IT! FYI, I used a 30 oz can of pumpkin pie mix because thats all I had and I didnt want to waste half of it. Still, the recipe turned out beautifully. GOD I LOVE THIS RECIPE!

Wow!   I expected these to be very edible but they're great!   I used the spice cake mix and because I can't ever leave well enough alone I grated an apple into the batter. Wonderful recipe!!!!
*addition - someone suggested using chocolate cake mix so I thought I'd try it.   Yuck!

These are wonderful! I can hardly believe they were so easy. I substituted pumpkin pie spice for all the spices, added about 3/4 c. walnuts, and sprinkled brown sugar on top. Absolutely delectable.

I used a chocolate cake mix and a can of pumkin- nothing else.  They turned out great- kind of like brownies but healthier!  Definitely the easiest recipe I have ever made!!

These muffins were a mega-hit at my office pre-holiday brunch!!  I tried the recipe as written, substituting the yellow cake mix for spice and they turned out pretty well but, as usual, I had to tweek it some more to make it my own.  I like a nice, overflowing muffin top so I filled the cups to almost full because the batter doesn't have very much rise to it.  I also added some walnuts & dried cranberries to the batter and topped it with a classic streusel topping.  I'm now making them as holiday gifts and adding them to my Christmas morning breakfast menu.  Soooo easy and soooo delicious!!!

AMAZING! These are more of a cake-like muffin, but quick, easy, inexpensive, and very tasty. I actually used squash instead of pumpkin, added a cup of chocolate chips, and did have to add about a TBS of water. I'll definitely make these again. My family liked them a lot.

Fantastic easy recipe. These were so quick to go it was unbelievable. I would make them the night before personally. There is something about letting them rest that makes them even more moist. Fantastic!

Very yummy.  The 2nd time I made them I added about 2/3 cup of water.  This made them a little smoother on top and still kept the flavor.

This was a perfect recipe to make with my 6 year old.  She was able to make the entire thing all by herself.  They turned out delicious.  The only thing I added was Pampered Chef sweet Cinnamon sprinkle to the top.  It added a little bit of crunch to the top.

I have tried these with many different cake mixes and they are ALWAYS a hit! Just don't tell anyone how easy they are to make ;P  Using the pumpkin makes them a power food! A really great snack or breakfast. Also, they really do stay moist for over a week- make sure they are covered though!

I've made these many times, following other reviewers suggestion and using the spice cake mix.  2 ingredients people!!  This could not be easier.  I did try this as a cake - it doesn't even spread in the pan it is so dense, so muffins once again.  I have sprinkled with brown sugar and called them muffins, most recently spread with cream cheese frosting and called cupcakes.  They were the hit of the church potluck.  My kids and husband love these; they are a great way to add fiber to the family diet.  Can't say enough about them, I have shared this recipe with many and always heard great results.

hi, i made these while cooking thanksgiving dinner yesterday. the only change i made was that i used a few generous shakes of pumpkin spice and two tablespoons of oil. they were baked in a texas size muffin tin that i just bought that morning and was dying to use it. long story short i have 6 nice sized muffins for breakfast....yummy with a cup of hot tea or coffee and very fulling. next time i will add a cup of walnuts. i find this to be very calorie or "point" friedly. even with the addtion of the oil that i added.

These are tasty considering how easy they are to make - how refreshing that I didn't have to crack open an egg, or measure out the oil, as seems standard for many cake/muffin recipes .... I did use a spice cake mix instead, as I'm not a fan of yellow cakes.  The recipe leaves room for personal improvements on a basic, but good flavored muffin.

I was skeptical, but these are really good. I used a Pillsbury Golden Butter Recipe cake mix because that's what I had and Libby's solid pack canned pumpkin. I followed the recipe and mixed it up in my stand mixer because some reviewers said it was too stiff to hand mix easily. It only took a couple minutes to mix and put in the pan. It goes into the pan easily because it's almost dough-like, so no drips. I filled the cups level with the top and used clean wet hands to smooth over the top of each since others said they bake up pretty rustic. I used a standard size silicone muffin pan and baked for 20 minutes. They look pretty good and they taste great. They are so good with nothing on them, not even butter and I am a butter fanatic. My kids love them for breakfast and they are pretty healthy for something that tastes like cake. Cheap, easy, healthy, delicious, what else do you want? Thanks for the recipe. I'll be making these again.

I made these muffins and they were very easy and really really good!  And I do not usually bake anything!  They were very moist too, my son really liked them, I made them with the yellow cake mix and with carrot cake mix, both time they came out really good, try them.

This were great and so very easy to make.  The best part is that they have only the fat from the mix and are better for everyone.  I made them the way as directed the 1st time.  The next time I used spice cake mix and added 1/4 cup water and did not add the spices.  Much easier to scoop and lighter.   YUMMY.   Thanks for such a quick, easy and Yummy recipe

These aren't too bad, and considering how easy they are, this is a great standby recipe! I used a carrot cake mix with the pumpkin and my son (who rarely lets a fruit or veg cross his lips) loved them! They do turn out bumpy because of the thickness of the batter, but they do rise a bit and just look hearty and rustic! Mine were slightly gummy the next day, but maybe I should have baked them slightly longer. Will try with other cake flavors!

Great recipe, but I did alter it...I added two eggs, 1/3 cup melted butter, and my home-grown butternut squash (15 oz).  Also, I skipped the cloves and added a tablespoon of ginger powder.  These were so darn good that all 18 muffins were gone in 24 hours (I have teenagers who swim daily).

This is the best muffin I've ever made and is so moist you won't believe it!  Also, if you think about it, the calories aren't bad either.....can't wait to try other cakes mixes.  You could even use the splenda cake mix and drop the calories more....but around 200 a muffin, I'm not complaining

I used the spice cake mix. These were just OK. They are moist, the texture is abit strange. My kids do seem to like them. They are just a little bland. After tasting one plain I decided to add a streusel topping to the rest and that helped alot with the taste. Not sure if I'll be making these again or not.

This is a great recipe, but can be improved upon.  I add 2 cups All Bran cereal soaked in 1 cup water for 5 min. then add the rest of the ingrediants the recipe calls for.  This greatly improves the texture, plus makes it even healthier!  I also add 1 tsp. vanilla.  I love this recipe with the changes!

These are so ridiculously easy and the absolute best pumpkin muffins I've ever had!  I used a white cake mix, and used pumpkin pie spice along with cloves and a teaspoon of vanilla extract.  I like it spicy!  Make sure you pay attention to the shape of them when you fill the cups because they don't expand much and whatever shape you made them is pretty much how they stay!  A definite keeper!

I followed the recipe exactly and love how they turned out. I am not a chef by any means and these were SUPER easy! one reviewer said there was an aftertaste, and I sometimes tasted it, but generally, a very yummy treat.

I only had a spice cake box mix around, so I used that- added a pinch of cinnamon, and then, after mixing in the pumpkin, I added a 1/2 cup of applesauce, for body and extra moisture. These turned out INCREDIBLE- so easy, and wonderful. mmmmmmm!

These were GREAT and really easy, I took them to work and it was a big crowd pleaser!  I used pumpkin pie mix and spice cake mix and nothing else and they were perfect! Also, I sprinkled brown sugar on top for some extra sweetness.

Nice, easy recipe.  Will be good with nuts added next time.  They took a bit longer to bake for me, I think it's because the batter is so dense.

I made this with a yellow "butter recipe" cake mix and a 15 oz. can of Libby's pumpkin and they came out absolutely delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of leaving out the ground cloves.  They weren't dense as others have said.  I made 1 dozen, so they were good sized muffins and baked them 25 minutes and they were perfect.  I'll try this with the spice cake mix next...and who knows where it will go from there.  Great easy recipe!

I'm so surprised even after reading all the reveiws.  I love to bake and was really questioning this recipe but it works great.  I used a spice cake mix and no spices.  I did top them with a  mix of oats, butter and brown sugar.  Some people said they didn't care for the appearance and the topping helps the rustic look.

YAY!!! These are really good. They make the cutest mini muffins! I opted to use white cake mix- I had way too many boxes of that and I happened to have pumpkin pie spice- so I used just over a teaspoon of that instead of the other three spices. I used a small ice cream scooper to get these into my mini muffin compartments. This recipe makes 48 perfectly-ish. My boys 5&6 are gobbling them up as I speak. I am missing the oil a bit but this a nice step away from that. They bake up nicely(17 minutes in my oven). I think I'll dress em up a bit next time around- a drizzling of glaze or icing or a bit of streudeling...a pat or two of butter...A nice no fuss recipe, also great for when you want something sweet and have no eggs...

I can't say anything bad about these muffins. This was very easy and quick to put together. I did cut down on the cloves by half and did not add any egg or oil. They turned out perfectly. My husband ate them quickly and told me to hold on to the recipe.

These muffins were delicious, however the spices were a bit too strong for my taste.  I took out the cloves, and needed to decrease the cinnamon slightly.  However, for an extra yummy touch, I sprinkled brown sugar on top before I baked them, which really helped.  Oh, and if you have honey butter, it goes GREAT with these!

Sorry, I just think these are AWFUL!  I went into the recipe with a total open mind, thinking ... "very cool" regarding the ingredient list.  I guess I just have too much of a discerning palette.  :-)   I made them as directed ... no changes, and couldn't taste the spice, but primarily did not like the texture.  Sorry ....

I absolutely loved these.  They were delicious and incredibly moist.  I probably used about twice the spices, because I like a stronger taste.  These weren't pretty, but they were absolutely amazing.  I'll keep the ingredients on hand for this one!

This is sooooo yummy!! Don't put eggs or oil in it. Just the dry cake mix. It looks like drop dough for drop biscuits. They don't look pretty but oh they taste so good!! I had to cook a little longer than 25 min. but it just depends on each individual oven. I also put in a 1/4 cup of ground flaxseed meal to boost up the nutritional value. I won't feel guilty about giving these to my 13 month old. These will deffinately become a staple in my house.

I would have given them 5 stars but my daughter and husband didn't like them. I loved them.  I think if I cut down the cloves in the recipe that they would like it more. They both seemed to be adverse to the spice. Otherwise they were perfectly moist and delightful.  I loved that you don't have to add eggs or oil.  Great way to get rid of a ton of fat!! Lovely!

Okay, so I made these this morning and they were delicious.   I first want to make note that these little delightful muffins are weight watcher approved!  They are 1 point for 3 mini muffins!   Secondly, if you want more pumpkin flavor, use spice cake mix,instead of yellow cake (which is what I did, and they have a great pumpkin flavor).   The consistency is very sticky but the end result is very moist.  I made a cream cheese icing and drizzled it on top!   Yum!!

Nice pumpkin flavor.  The batter did look a little strange and I think there are cake mix clumps, but overall very easy and tasty.

I didn't have pumpkin on hand, so substituted organic sweet potato puree. I also added chopped pecans and white chocolate chunks.  They were very flavorful and of a decent density when warm and right out of the oven.  However, a few hours later after total cooling they became too thick and dense, less flavorful and not very good.  My advice is to eat right out of the oven, or forget it.  Even in warming them up later..

This is a fabulous recipe that I have made numerous times.  It is delicious as well as nutritious (0 fat and only 180 cals/muffin). I like to use a spice cake mix instead of yellow.  If you use the spice cake you don not need the spices. I also like to add raisins or other dried fruit.  The batter is very thick; almost brownie like.  The muffins, however, are very moist.  I've also used a chocolate cake mix and added chocolate chips to trick my kids into consuming the healthy pumpkin.  They love the chocolate muffins, but I prefer the spice ones.

These are EASY and awesome just the way they are.  I might not have gotten the spices right because I just guessed, but other than that, I kept everything EXACTLY the ways it was written. No oil, no eggs, just YUM.  In the 2nd batch, I added nuts to them because my husband likes that - just as yummy!

I thought this was one of the best and easiest recipes for pumpkin muffins.  It was very moist and had a strong flavor!  It does surprise you because the dough is so stiff and a little hard to work with but it turns out great!  I have shared this recipe and had others asking for the recipe!

These were very good although I did follow other reviewers suggestions and used spice cake mix, 1 egg and 1/4 cup oil.  There were very moist although the pumpkin flavor was hidden by the spice.

I, too, used spice cake mix after reading other reviews.  Very good!

I bought a mini-muffin tin a few weeks back and have been trying out a few recipies - this is a great extra.  I baked them the Sunday before Thanksgiving, brought @ 14 to my brother's for Sunday dinner.  I'm saving the rest for Thanksgiving Day at my house - I think they're good to have out during apps, dinner, and dessert.

Great tasting.  Used the spice cake with the pumpkin puree.  Awsome.  Cooked them on Sat. and on Wed. the last one was still moist.  Very easy, not the prettiest of muffins but very yummy.

Easy and delicious.  I just made two and a half dozen of these to take to work tomorrow and am sure going to hate to admit how simple they were to make when I'm asked for the recipe.  Next time I think I'll make a streusel topping, but having just taste tested one I can say they are excellent just the way they are.

ok.  A little bland.  Would be much better with cream cheese frosting.

I didn't believe these would turn out well but they did.  Very moist. However, the reason I give 3 instead of 4 stars is that I followed suggestions to use pumpkin pie filling instead of plain pumpkin and this meant there was an extra dose of sugar (there is sugar in the cake mix already).  So they turned out a little too sweet for my taste.  Maybe cream cheese would offset the sweetness.  However, I'm sure if I had followed the original recipe it would be a 4 star, so I will make again but following the original.  The tops came out fine, not too lumpy so I don't see that as an issue.( I used organic cake mix and organic canned pumpkin pie filling.)

I have made these muffins a lot and I really like them.  They stay moist and fresh for a long time.  I also use a spice cake mix, add in about 1/2 cup of unsweetened applesauce, double the spices or use pumpkin pie spice and usually add in a small container of Egg Beaters (the kind that comes in the 3-pack).  This recipe will then make approximately 18 muffins and if you are doing Wt Watchers, they count as 2 points.  So easy and so good!!

i just made these muffins exactly as the directions said to and they are YUMMY!!! very moist and lots of flavor!  was skeptical when i was preparing the batter because it was lumpy and thick but it came out perfect.  i topped off the muffins with whipped vanilla icing for extra deliciousness.  i only baked for 23 minutes so they would not get too dry and they came out perfect.

Absolutely Delicious!!!  I baked these with the spice cake and then sprinkled Splenda/Brown sugar on the tops. My father and I just loved them.  Wonderful light snack after dinner or anytime.  I will definitely bake these again and again!  Not only delicious but very easy!

I had to make 4 dozen pumpkin muffins for my children's school Halloween parties.  I was glad to find this very easy recipe.  I made cream cheese frosting to top them and they were a hit.  I didn't get any muffins back at the end of the day. I had some extra at home and they didn't last very long either! Thanks for the easy recipe!

I used a spice cake mix with pumpkin pie filling. I could only find the large can of pumpkin filling, so actually used two boxes of cake mix and made six muffins and two loaves! Easy to make and it turned out wonderful!

I just made these for the first time tonight for my sons' classroom Halloween parties for tomorrow, and they are mucho yummy! Even my one kid who doesn't like pumpkin gobbled them up. They are very moist. Just used spice cake mix, but still added dashes of ground cinnamon, clove & nutmeg.  

Sprinkled the tops with brown sugar AND also some orange colored sugar I had on hand just for some festive color on them before baking.  Had to slap hubby's hand away after he ate four mini muffins!

My husband loved these.  I was looking for something easy and with less calories and this is it.  I will make these on a regular basis.  I did add about 1/2 tsp ginger and they had great flavor.

I too used a spice cake mix and the canned pumpkin.  They are good but very dense - more of a pound cake.  I might try adding an egg or two next time.  But the flavor is great!

This recipe was so easy and I ended up with tasty and moist muffins.

Per the suggestion of others, I used spiced cake mix and added some dried cranberries because I love these fall flavors together. 

Finally, I sprinkled some sugar, brown sugar, and cinnamon, as someone else suggested. I think this was a perfect way to make what could be a stiff looking top look like a gourmet muffin.

My kids loved this recipe...just for that it gets 5 stars!  I use spice cake, added 3/4 tsp pumpkin pie spice, and sprinkled the top with cinnamon & sugar.  will definitely make again--looking forward to using chocolate cake mix also.

My family and I did not enjoy these muffins at all!  I took the advice of many others and used just a Spiced Cake mix and a can of Pumpkin.  I put them in a mini muffin pan- but we couldn't get over the gummy texture.  I even baked them 4 minutes longer than suggested, but couldn't get them right.  You should try them though- a lot of other people loved them!  It just wasn't for us!

The ease of this recipe was extraordinary, especially with the use of the gallon-size zip-top bag for mixing as others suggested.  I didn't even have a clean-up which was wonderful!  However, the muffins were just okay.  Very thick and heavy, left feeling like a rock was sitting in your stomach.  The flavor was okay, but nothing to write home about.  Could be improved, hopefully with some tweaking.

I had serious doubts about this recipe as I mixed the cake mix and pumpkin together in that somewhat cement mixture, but it really did turn out well. I made mini muffins b/c of the density and mixed it with spice cake mix. VERY EASY!!

Was delicious.  Not as pumpkin-y tasting as I'd hoped.  I'll probably add a little more pumpkin and cinnamon and nutmeg next time to bring that out.  Otherwise- delicious!

Super easy, great tasting and so moist.  I am not a person who usually does well in the kitchen, but these came out great.  I actually made the puree from pumpkins I grew in my garden.  I used the spice cake mix instead too.  One other thing I tried was adding chocolate chips to the second half of the batch...these were even more popular with my wife and kids.

This recipe looked to easy, I just had to try it them morning. The house smells WONDERFUL! I made both yellow and spice cake in the Zip Lock bag (what a great idea!). Both very good flavor, dense (no eggs or oil - that may be why). I would make these again for the family when we're craving pumpkin muffins and want to save on fat. But if I'm making for company or to take to someone's house, I will probably stick to the traditional full egg/oil method. I wonder if these would make good pancakes???

Super easy, super tasty, and not horrible for you! : )  I used about 1/2 of a 29 oz can of pumpkin, only the cinnamon & nutmeg, and added mini chocolate chips both mixed in the batter & sprinkled on top.  Very moist and not too dense.  Definitely don't overcook, and don't add any extra liquid or eggs, it really doesn't need it.  If you find it hard to mix, try sifting the cake mix before adding it in so there are less "lumps" to break up.

I don't know why these were rated so well.  They really weren't that good.  They were very dense and just didn't have a very good flavo.  I love pumpkin muffins, and since this was rated so well and was so easy, I thought it'd be great.  Instead, I am just going to make muffins the old-fashioned way.

Have faith in this recipe!  It really does work, just keep stirring the pumpkin into the cake mix, and it will turn into batter.
We love this, I also make them using chocolate cake mix and no spices.  They're very good.

Good for everyday eatin'. Don't try altering it to get a better muffin batter consistency - you'll ruin it! Just great as is. Very moist.

Good Muffins. I added a topping to increase texture as follows: brown sugar, diced pecans, rolled oats, a little whole wheat four and some cinnamon. I also added an egg white to the batter. These came out soft, fluffy and flavorful. Next time I will cut back on the cloves, they were just a little too powerful. The topping I added was good, but the muffins were sweet enough without it. I felt it was a little extra "bonus".

I love these muffins!  A friend of mine makes these for her weight loss plan and her son, a high school wrestler, eats them for a snack for an alternative to junk food. They have a great taste and they come out really moist.  I would not change a thing except you can sub the yellow cake mix and spices for just the spice cake mix and it works great.  Also many reviewers complained about the mix being to dry.  It seems impossible to stir 1 can of pumpkin into the mix but it takes a minute and it actually does stir in nicely.  This recipe is cheap, tasty, healthy, fast and it never fails.  Thanks for posting it!

It's a good base recipe. I would definatly recommend some sort of liquid in the recipe though, but that's just by reading the recipe, I havn't tried it without any added liquid. I used 1/2C. Milk, 1/4 oil, and 1 egg. I also added 1/4c. of raisins and 1/4c. walnuts. Oh and for the spice, spice cake mix works but if you have yellow cake I'd just use pumpkin pie spice so that you only have to get out on jar of spice. For even better cupcakes make this cream cheese filling. add 1/4c. softened cream cheese, 1/4c. powdered sugar and 1 large egg (beat together of course). after filling the muffin cups with the batter spoon a T. of filling on top of each one. It makes them look better (the egg makes the muffins gloss), taste better, and makes you feel better about using the box mix! ;) no one will ever know!

I made these for my son's Fall party--they disappeared in minutes. Several parents and even the teacher asked me for the recipe! I've made them a few times and every time, I think "Wow, these are so easy and so good!".

This is a pretty good recipe. I used spicecake mix and added some chopped pecans and dried fruit chopped up and baked them in clean soup cans. I made about 10 of them and took them to my friends for after dinner. Everyone thought they were so neat. I saw a similar muffin mix idea in left over tins from soupand thought how neat it would be to take since I had to bring dessert. I am going to make them for Chritmas this year and maybe use gingerbread mix. yummy yummy.

Although these muffins came out very moist, I found the batter very dense, and hard to work with. I had a hard time scooping the batter into the muffin tins.I did get more muffins than the recipe said, I got 18 muffins.Even though the muffins were cooked all the way, my husband and I tasted an after taste from them. I won't try this recipe again, but will look for  different muffin recipe.

I needed a quick and easy recipe for my daughter's first grade holiday brunch at school.  I was amazed at how good they tasted.  I wasn't expecting much considering the ingredients,(I used canned pumpking and a spice cake mix) but the tray was empty.  I will make them again and again.

I used 2 boxes of spiced cake mix and a large 30 oz can of pureed pumpkin.  I then put them in foil cupcake liners directly on a cookie sheet (no cupcake pan needed) so that I could bake more at a time.  They came out so moist and delicious!

I made this recipe, but added 2 eggs and 1/4 cup of water. Plus, I used about 2-3 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice, instead of the individual spices mentioned. I also sprinkled some brown sugar on top (per other recommendations)and they came out so good! They are not real sweet and don't have a strong spiced pumpkin flavor. Everyone seems to like them, especially my 6 year old daughter!

Here's what I did:  I used a lemon cake mix, a 14oz can of pure pumpkin, added 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, and 1/4 tsp ground ginger.  I also added 2 large eggs and 1/4 cup of safflower oil.  They turned out silky smooth and airy light.  Delicious!  Before baking I topped them with walnut crumbs and brown sugar.  Really good.  With these additions it's a 5 star, without it wouldn't have worked at all.

These are so easy! I added 2 eggs as others suggested, and I added 1/2 C applesauce. They rose nicely, and the recipe easily makes 18-20. I gave only 4 stars since they are more like cupcakes than muffins (fluffy and pretty sweet).

These didn't work at all for me.  The texture of the batter was very thick.  The only way I can see this working is if you made the cake batter first, then added the pumpkin?  I tried adding an egg and water to the batter I had left after the first 12 muffins went in, and still didn't end up with an edible product.  Sorry, I was looking forward to these, but just can't seem to make them work.

Took these for a treat at library storyhour for 1-5 year olds (the world's pickiest age group) and the kids loved them!  All had a second muffin, and some asked for a third.  My 3 kids were arguing over the leftovers later at home, so I ended up making another batch.

Made the following modifications:
1.  Used Cinnamon Swirl cake mix that has a packet of swirl-in cinnamon mixture in the box.  Used half of the cinnamon mix in the muffin batter, and used the remaining amount to sprinkle over the top of unbaked muffins for a strusel-like topping.

2.  2 eggs

3.  1/3 cup applesauce

4.  Baked in cupcake liners 1/2 full for 20 minutes.

5.  After cooled, drizzled cream cheese icing over the tops of the muffins.

The muffins are delicious per the recipes directions.  The only thing I added was some raw sugar on top prior to baking. We ate these for breakfast and at night topped them with ice cream and caramel sauce.  If your looking for a recipe to set your mood for fall and the upcoming holidays then this one is it.  Thank you for sharing it!

These are extrememly easy to make which is nice, deserves 5 stars just for that!  But like other reviewers, I thought that they needed to be smoothed out with a small spoon or spatula prior to baking.  I didn't like the cloves in the recipe.  I think this spice is too overpowering...it was all I could taste.  I used a couple teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice.  I used an organic cake mix, just to make them a little healthier for my kids.  
All in all, I think next time I make them I will prepare the cake mix as directed on its box, like one reviewer had stated, as well as eliminate the cloves.  
Oh, & another plus is how moist they are!

All and all, this was a decent recipe. Instead of yellow cake mix, I used spice cake mix,(it was what I had on hand.) this eliminated the use of the spices the recipe says to add. They came out very moist.

Amazing!  I just had to try this and was very happy with it.  I've made it several ways.  The kids liked it best made with coconut cake mix.  I almost always add a brown sugar crust to the top, sometimes mixed with nuts and/or coconut.  WOW!

I made the muffins exactly as stated, but they came out looking rather unattractive and though they tasted good, were heavy and somewhat dense. I made this a second time, and prepared the cake mix according to package directions, and it was fantastic! Very moist and airy and flavorful. I do not know which way these were itended to be made, but I would recommend preparing the cake mix as directed before adding the pumpkin and spices. I also stirred in some walnuts to give it a nice crunch.

These were yummy and easy to whip up.  I like that it only takes two ingredients and a few spices. I made mini muffins with these. I took another reviewer's suggestion and added brown sugar on top. That was a great idea! This made the muffins more appealing and added some texture.  I took these to a church brunch and people kept coming back to snag more.  Even as I was leaving, they were grabbing them out of the basket. There were none left by the time I exited the room -- that's the best compliment there is! I will be making these again.

I also doctored the recipe a bit.  I added 2 eggs, 1/2 cup of water, and a 1/2 stick of butter to add a little more moisture and less density.  They turned out much better than the first batch which had none of the above ingredients.

The flavor for these was pretty good, but too sweet for me.  I like my muffins to have a crispy top, but the consistency in these is more like a cupcake.  I followed along in adding an egg and 1/3 cup of oil.  I also added about 1/2 cup chopped pecans for some protein so we could have these as breakfast.  I'd say it's good, not great although they are easy enough for my seven year old to make on his own with some supervision, which is a plus.  That bumps my score from three to four.

these helped with my pumpkin craving... had all ingredients on hand.  Took other suggestions and added 2 eggs and 1/3 c oil.  I also added a little water since it seemed rather dense.  Sprinkled with cinnamon sugar on top.  I did the mini muffins and they needed to cook a good 15-19 mins.

I have a picky 13 year old who doesn't like muffins or pumpkin and came back for thirds. Very simple and delicious. Followed other reviews with the egg and oil and I sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top for a little crunch. Served with a pot roast and were just as wonderful for breakfast the next morning.

As the oldest of 13 I have a lot of NIeces and few Nephews that want to learn to cook with me (been cooking 40+years), this is simple and easy enough for the youngest 7 years old,  that I dont have to worry  about huge messes. I changed the spices to 1 Tablespoon in a double batch and made them in a mini-muffin pan. baked them for 15 minutes and they turned out wonderfully.

These muffins are very moist. I  was a half a cup short on pumpkin so I  added half a cup of applesauce.  I  also added some mini chocolate chips. I will certainly make these again.

Can’t complain about the taste, followed the recipe and they’re delicious! They are definitely pumpkin cupcakes though - very sweet, I had to bake for a little longer than 25 min.

I made exactly as written. I love the texture and they are really moist. I'm just not loving the flavor. I used a yellow cake mix so next time definitely will try another flavor such as chocolate. Easiest recipe ever!

My older daughter has declared these muffins to be her new favorite! I found out about this recipe at my WW meeting. Depending on the brand of cake mix used, this is (with the current WW plan) only 2-3 points per muffin! At my meeting, it was recommended to use a spice cake mix and pumkin - no other ingredients needed. I used yellow cake mix as recommended here and 1.5 tsp of pumpkin spice blend. The batter is very thick, but that's totally FINE. It bakes up nicely and makes lovely, moist muffins. Thanks for posting this recipe!

We made these tonight exactly as recipe read with yellow cake mix.  We iced half with cream cheese frosting and kept the others without frosting. We really loved them plain.  They tasted just like pumpkin pie.  They were so good!  I might try them the next time with spice cake mix, but can’t imagine them any better.

This is a great starter recipe. To create a less dense muffin I added 1/4 c. melted butter, 2/3 c. milk, and doubled the spices for flavor. Then I mixed with a blender until well blended about 2 minutes.  I folded in 1 c. mini chocolate chips. This made 18 delicious muffins.

Perfect just the way they are! Even my finicky son loves them and they store or freeze well. Trust in the recipe you will not be sorry. I keep yellow cake mix and pumpkin on hand just for this recipe, it's my go to muffin recipe.

Read previous reviews regarding eggs and oil and denseness of batter.  I had some leftover cinnamon applesauce in the fridge so added that to the batter.  Easy to do and loosened the batter a little.  Made more than a dozen muffins with the added ingredient. For ease I would make them again, flavor was good but a little too cakey for muffins.  If you're not much of a baker, could use 2 tsp. pumpkin spice mix rather than all the spices.

I made these with a spice cake mix...(another recipe out there),
adding 1/2 cup water and no spices. Added nuts and raisons in half of the batter.  I put a cream cheese icing on some, orange for Halloween, and  appropriate picks for the holiday. My local grocery store had the canned pumpkin and cake mix on sale for $1.00 each. Not bad for 24 muffins !

I made one bread loaf, but I ran out of bread pans. So I ended up putting some of the mixture into muffin pans; baked 12 mins. They're the best pumpkin muffins I've ever had!

Yummy,  I wanted to make mini-muffins for daycare and so I read other reviews and did make a couple changes, I used a spice cake mix for extra flavor, I also added 2 eggs and 1/2 cup oil.  I realize it would have baked without but I really didn't want a super thick consistency for mini muffins.  Really great recipe.  Thanks!!

The batter didn't have a lot of pumpkin flavor to it. Will see how it taste when I get it out of the oven. Easy recipe though. Do like that...

These are great. I did not have cloves   I used cinnamon nutmeg and ginger. I substituted spice cake mix. I topped with rum flavored buttercream.

Followed the recipe as described and used a mixer to mix the ingredients . The clover and yellow cake mix kind of over powered the pumpkin in the muffins. Food was still edible but not a favorite.

Didn't change a thing. Made for a work potluck. These got rave reviews. Couldn't have been easier. None were left and co-workers were looking for more. Thank you for submitting.

They really were yummy. Didn’t do five star only because I should’ve mixed with a mixer to get all of the mix really stirred in

I make these often.  You can use ANY flavor cake mix.  I use white or yellow.  I always add half of a bag of mini chocolate chips, a dash of pumpkin pie spice, and a splash of milk. They are fluffier with milk in them instead of dense.

These are hands down the best muffins I've ever made. I was shocked with how beautifully they turned out! Moist yet dense and so, so tasty! I am absolutely making these again come Autumn and/or Winter. I might even experiment with different cake mix flavors, I bet chocolate would be amazing!

Five stars for the simplicity. I actually used a spice cake mix and also threw in a random amount of cinnamon, cloves and pumpkin pie spice. I put chocolate chips in and on top of half and raisins in the other half of the batter. Super delicious especially if eaten right out of the oven With butter. Definitely a keeper. Makes 12 muffins. They plump up nicely without overflowing.

This simple recipe is nearly a glorified dump cake with additional spices thrown in for delicious measure.  No extra moisture is needed! Seriously.   I used a devil's food chocolate cake mix, doubled the spices shown and boosted the pumpkin puree with (2) teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice. Finished off the muffins by pressing in a walnut.  Devilishly (pun intended) good smells are wafting from the cooling muffins.

I just made these and this is a great and easy base recipe that can be tweaked to your liking! The main changes I made were - I used 1 T pumpkin pie spice sincere that is all I had. I think next time I will even increase that to 1.5-2 T since the spices were not the most noticeable flavors. Like others mentioned the batter was really thick and I had a bit of a hard time getting it incorporated (I was just using a spatula) so I added 1/2 cup of water and it smoothed out nicely. This added about 10 minutes to the baking  time. Finally I added mini chocolate chips to the batter and sprinkled walnuts on top. I also just sprayed the muffin tin and the muffins popped right out. Again with a few tweaks this is a great easy and cheap recipe!

This was such a simple recipe.   I used a spice cake mix and still added the spices.    I served this at a Quilter's meeting and was asked for the recipe by members.    Needless to say, I can't take a picture because the dozen of muffins disappeared in a New York Second.

This recipe is very good! I have made a version of this before, and I was so happy when I found it here again. The spice is perfect! I made a few changes, instead of yellow cake batter I used french vanilla, and I have heard some people use chocolate. It would be a good idea to split the batter in half and add some cocoa powder to half if you have some chocolate and some vanilla fans as we do in our house.  Also, I only baked for 18 minutes and they turned out FABULOUS! Thank you for posting this, it is one of our favorite fall muffin recipes!

I used a spice cake mix and added 1 and 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice.  I read another review of this procedure and followed the "do not add anymore fluids" note.  The batter is very thick, but there is enough moisture in it to carry off this recipe.  The muffins are very tasty, very moist!

Very dense, which was fine, but no taste. We could barely taste the pumpkin, inside was very moist, almost too much. We even cooked an extra 10 minutes because we were sure it should have been more done inside. The next morning the muffins were the same inside, but the taste was even more bland. It needs more spice for sure. Plus a brown sugar crust on the top to help bring out the flavor. Muffin paper did not peel off well.

I am the cook at a child care center, and I made these for the kids this week. The batter is unpleasantly stiff so I added just a touch of apple sauce to loosen things up a bit.  Personally, I did not like them. They have an odd texture and are way too sweet for my taste. However, the children LOVED them. All the classroom teachers came back looking for more. So, yes! I will definitely make them again.

Great base recipe!!  i have made as directed and they turn out well but i usually mix it up.  I add some coconut oil or applesauce to loosen up the batter a bit so it is easier to work with.  great with spice cake or carrot cake.  also really tasty with shredded carrots and a pecan crumb topping ;0

This recipe is AMAZING. I only did the cake mix, pumpkin and cinnamon. Add a little butter on top once they're out and it's now my favorite breakfast. I did NOT add anything that the cake mix needed. It's frustrating to mix up (especially when your KitchenAid is dirty) but it's so worth it in the end! Use an ice cream scoop for absolutely perfect muffins. Love, love, love!

So shocked at how easy it was.  I've done it twice now.  Once I omitted all the spices and substituted a box of spice cake instead of the yellow cake (looks like I'm not the only person to do it this way).  So, they are not gourmet muffins.  They still have great vitamins in them and for a busy mom there is nothing easier that my kids love more (the man of the house who loves to bake from scratch was super skeptical and ate MANY of them).  Yummy and some added vitamins!

Love it!  However, I use "spice cake mix" in place of the yellow cake mix.  Use cream cheese frosting, with a little pumpkin pie spice added! Oh!! one more thing! I also add pumpkin seeds (pepita) to the batter for some extra texture!! YUM!:-)

These muffins were wonderful!  Ok, I have to admit that I didn't use pumpkin.  I was looking for a recipe for "muffins" which took a cake mix.  I used 3 mashed bananas, 1 egg and 1/4 cup oil with the cake mix.  (And no pumpkin)  I baked it the same and these are the most delicious muffins I have ever made!!

Delicious and so moist!  I used Pillsbury sugar free yellow cake mix (no one would have known), and it was fantastic!  I made this in a 9x13" pan, but will do muffins or mini-muffins next time for portion control.  Made "Warm Apple Compote" from this site to serve on top.  So yummy & a great way to welcome autumn!

I thought these were disappointing.  Made them for a party.  They did not rise, despite 25 minutes in the oven.  Very easy except the density of the mix made it a little difficult to spoon into cupcake papers.  The guys liked them, which is the only reason I even gave two stars.  The consistency even after baked was soft and in the heat outside they ended up soft and mushy. Very little pumpkin taste, awful consistency.  I had 20 muffins filling cake papers 2/3 full.  Will not make again.

Just made these this morning to help kick off fall. I would say they are a cross between a muffin and a cupcake. Without a doubt super easy and yummy. Next time I will kick up the spice a little bit or use a spice cake mix instead of yellow and figure some type of topping or add in like some of the other reviewers did. They would be nice with a small bit of cream cheese icing or a crumb topping.

Just made this the other day. Wow, super moist and no eggs. I did change it up just a bit because I was concerned about the thickness. I added some water maybe about 1/3 cup and used evaporated milk 1/3 or little more. I used pumpkin spice,all spice, and vanilla. I wish I would have used more of pumpkin and add cinnamon. I didn't make cup cakes rather 2 smaller cakes and used creamy vanilla frosting BIG HIT!!!!!! I'm going to make this one again today!

I made these muffins about 30 minutes before I had to leave for work-they were mixed and baked-and I made it to work in time! This is as easy as it gets. I had a hankering for something pumpkin and this fit the bill. I did as others suggested and mixed all the ingredients in a large Ziploc bag. I snipped one corner and filled my muffin pan easily. No clean up-no mess! Very moist, mild pumpkin flavor. Grated fresh nutmeg set these off for me. Yummy! Not light and airy like a cupcake, more like a muffin-for those concerned about using cake mix. I got my pumpkin and cake mix from Aldi. For  about $2 I have enough muffins for at least 4 days breakfast and snack! Not bad! Love this recipe!

Love this recipe!  I've made it probably 4or 5 times now using various suggestions by other reviewers.  The best version I made is to use the suggestion of one reviewer to use spice cake mix, rather than yellow cake mix and add in the spices yourself.  It was delicious!  I also always add chocolate chips because my kids wouldn't eat it otherwise. I am also able to "hide" some wheat germ and flax seed and the kids have no idea. Making this with a chocolate cake mix is also wonderful but I think the spice cake mix is the best!  So easy and semi nutritious with the fiber from the pumpkin.  My kids take this as a snack to school all of the time.  Freezes really well too.

These were quite good and so quick and easy!  The texture was great, light and airy but more dense than a cupcake.  As per the instructions, I just mixed the pumpkin (2 cups), spices and dry cake mix. The batter was thick but easily scooped with a spoon.  I sprinkled with brown sugar before baking and ate them with butter.   We all enjoyed them but I will cut back on the nutmeg and cloves next time.

I make these often, by often I mean at least twice a wee when pumpkin is available. when it's not I have used drained, mashed canned sweet potatoes.  really works just the same, ( think pumpkin pie or sweet potato pie) my personal favorite this month is caramel flavor cake mix.  for an extra treat and a few more calories I split in half like a layer cake and put a tablespoon or so of a pre made Philadelphia cheese cake filling. oh, and if the uneven top bothers you as it does me, I use my cookie scooper to fill the muffin cups then dappen my finger tips with cold water, (damp not wet) and tat the tops .  does not need eggs, water, oil.

I did not have a cake mix handy so I made my own spice cake mix recipe. 

I then added 1 can of pumpkin. I used an ice cream scoop to easily fill my muffin pan. I did use an oversize muffin pan ( makes 6 large muffins. I sprinkled brown sugar over the top of each muffin before baking. They took a little longer for them to cook through since they were large. They rose nicely and smell great. Upon eating I did notice the texture was different than most muffin recipes though it wasnt unpleasant. It almost has the texture of a dense bread.

Good recipe, not bad. Simplicity I would give it a 5, taste a 3. They were very dense, and could have used more flavor in my opinion. Not bad though overall.

This is so good! I added 2 teaspoon of cinnamon instead of 1 and sprinkled the top of each one with more cinnamon and a little bit of sugar. I did add about 1/4 cup of water and an egg. Oh my goodness, they weren't dense at all! They were so moist and fluffy even after they set for a couple of hours. I know they are suppose to have the muffin dense texture but I didn't mind the fluffiness. Next time I'm going to try them without the egg!!

OMW these were the best and easiest muffins EVER!I can't believe I'm just finding this recipe NOW after decades of baking plain old muffins and struggling to find a better way to make them more moist! The recipe was perfect- the only addition I made was about a cup of dark chocolate chips :). Everything tastes better when you add chocolate! :) My 4 year old had two muffins before they even cooled down! This is now my "go-to" muffin mix! Thank you!

I followed some of the suggestions & added one of those individual cups of cinnamon applesauce & sprinkled brown sugar on top. I used 1 1/2 cup real pumpkin that I previously cooked & stored in the freezer. They turned out moist & everyone loved them!

Followed recipe but added 3/4 cup semi sweet chips. Made 48 mini muffins. Cooked for 15 minutes. They turned out perfect. Thanks.

A co-worker made these and after finding out how easy these tasty morsels were, I had to give them a try myself.  3 words or advice:  Add cinnamon chips! (if you can find them).  I also used pumpkin pie spice mix instead of the individual spices and sprinkled a little cinnamon sugar on top for a little cruch.

I thought these were very good.  The only change I made was to add a bit of water to the batter to make it a little easier to work with. It was very stiff which made mixing difficult.  They were, however, a big hit with my family!  (I made 6 extra large muffins instead of 12 regular ones)

This was so easy. Very moist. One batch is not enough here. I used Spice cake mix instead of yellow cake mix. Also I used pumpkin Pix Spice.

I made these with the prescribed amount of pumpkin & yellow cake mix (no spice to be found at the stores) and used 2 tbsp pumpkin pie spice in lieu of spices the recipe calls for because I didn't have any of it individually. I also added one egg and a tablespoon of vanilla. I haven't tried it without the egg, so I couldn't say whether that's better, but my batter was very dense anyway. I also topped with brown sugar per some other reviews - definitely do this! It makes them look so much more appealing. I would add that you should sprinkle it on when you put them in the oven and not wait for them to bake a little while like I did.

Very good (got rave reviews) but in MY opinion it's missing something... maybe a little acid? Nuts? Also I agree they are a little on the bland side even with my doctoring.

I made these but used the Pillsbury No Sugar Added Yellow Cake Mix and it is heavenly!  Wonderful for those of use who are dieting and/or have diabetes.  I also used 15 oz homemade applesauce in it and they were good too!  The pumpkin ones end up being between 10 and 15 calories a muffin depending on there size.

I used spice cake and pumpkin pie filling and baked in mini muffin pans.  At 15 minutes they were a bit too moist for me so I cooked the rest at 17 minutes.  I thickly sprinkled brown sugar on top of 1/2 of them and that gave it a muffin taste with thick crust.  On the other half, I put an orage glaze which gave it more of a cupcake flavor.  I liked both ways.

For the simplicity of the recipe I think this is a great muffin. I did add about a quarter cup of applesauce and left out the nutmeg. I used a French vanilla cake mix. Sprinkling powdered sugar on top definitely improves the presentation. I can't wait to try with chocolate like others suggested.

A GREAT and EASY recipe!!!! Milk & egg free make this top choice for people with food allergies like me. Look for Ducan Hines cake mix, they are usually milk and egg free. Like others have said, try the recipe as it is, it is great!!! You can always create your own twists from this recipe like using different flavor mixes, or adding chocolate chips. Can't wait to make these again!!!

Sooooooo quick and easy and sooooo yummy.  I used the spice cake mix for a more authentic pumpkin taste.  Because several people mentioned how dense the muffins came out, I also added 2 tablespoons of apple sauce to the mix.  Topped with brown sugar for a crunchy/sweet top... Everyone in my house loved them!!

These muffins ultimately came out very good. But the can of organic pumpkin that I used lacked enough moisture for the box of cake mix.  Perhaps non-organic pumpkin might have worked better?  I have a Weight Watcher recipe that uses 1 can of pumpkin and an angel food cake mix. That works fine. But when I couldn't get the Easy Pumpkin Muffins to work, I added some organic cinnamon applesauce (unsweetened). It took about a cup of applesauce to finally get the moisture needed to mix.  Baking took a bit longer (30 minutes), but the finished product is tasty! The addition of applesauce turned out to be a nice touch.

I used spice cake mix and raisins. This is the best recipe EVER!! My kids will not stop eating them! I will add grated carrot next time. If you use spice cake, do not add any nutmeg or cinnamon. I made several  batches, and for me, they are perfectly done at 27 minutes.

I made this recipe, but did it as a cake instead, 8 x 8, turned out like a rich pumpkin torte!  Added a powdered sugar frosting, and OMG, was it tasty!  Just add about ten minutes for cook time.  Thanks for posting this amazing and easy recipe!

I was amazed at how easy this was, I'm glad I read all these reviews before I made it or I would have thought something was wrong with the mixture!  I didn't want to pay extra for all the spices or even just pumpkin spice so I got pumpkin pie mix and yellow cake.  Mine didn't come out as fluffy as the ones in the picture above, they looked more like little cornbread muffins, but the taste and moistness was amazing!  I did add a little applesauce for more flavor and then some brown sugar (splenda) to counter the wet texture from the applesauce.  When warm they were a tiny bit mushy but after wrapped in saran wrap overnight they were perfect the next day.  Someone brought pumpkin pie to the pot luck so the muffins weren't devoured, but I got some compliments and my boyfriend gobbled them up at home!  Next time I'll put more batter in each cup so they will be bigger, probably a few minutes more cooking time will be needed.  Mine were pretty small even in a normal muffin pan and just cooked enough at 25 minutes.  I can't wait to try other variations!   I'm taking these to my family's Thanksgiving dinner for sure!

Very easy & taste great .  Used mini muffin pampered chef pan & used small pampered chef scoop.  Done in 10 mins and sprinkled powdered sugar on top immediately after taking out of pan.  Great recipe for my niece to take to her kindergarten class for her pumpkin dessert! Just her "right size"!

Super Easy and loved by all pumpkin fans just as written!  Great with stir-ins too, if you are feeling like jazzing things up a bit with raisins, nuts or both is my fav!  Chocolate chips are a nice addition too!

There is something about the texture of these muffins that I don't care for. I don't know how to describe it other than to say they have a somewhat slimy mouthfeel. Adding 2 eggs and 1/3 cup oil helps the texture problem. This increases the batter to make about 18 muffins rather than 12. The ease of preparation still makes this a good recipe for busy days.

Awesome and easy recipe! Loved this as muffins! Another idea I got from this is baked pumkin cake doughnuts. I added a large (5.1 oz) box of vanilla pudding and 3/4-1cup of flour. Put the dough in a doughnut pan and then baked at 400 degrees for 8-10 minutes. Yummy! Also, I got to thinking that you might be able to use this recipe with applesauce, bananas, or other pureed fruit to make different kinds of muffins and without the eggs, they are cholesterol free!

These muffins were ok.  I used fresh pumpkin, hoping that would give the moist muffins more substance.  Unfortunately they were still a little on the mushy side. Great if you like moist muffins!  Disappointing if you're looking for something sweet and hearty.

I needed to make muffins in a flash for a work staff meeting.  I had everything in the pantry.  These came out really, really good.  It's a quick and easy way to make pumpkin muffins and I will certainly make them again.  Thanks!

I make delicious pumpkin bread and thought since yellow cake is my favorite it would be great. It looked odd when I spooned it but worse when it baked. I even tried to salvage with cream geese frosting.

These muffins are SO easy!  I read a couple of reviews first.  I did add the brown sugar on top of the first batch and added some mini chocolate chips to the second batch.  Both were fantastic.  (I threw in some salt too, because everything is better with salt.)  Also, I used an ice cream scoop, filled up about half way, so the muffins looked better on top.

My class makes this for our preschool's Thanksgiving Feast. It is so easy, moist, and has a nice, mild flavor that the kids enjoy (they won't get near pumpkin pie). I disguise the lumpy top with a tiny dollop of cream cheese frosting.

Best and easiest pumpkin muffine recipe!  Delicious!  I added a streusel topping: about 1/4 cup each of oats, chopped pecans, brown sugar, and flaxseed meal, plus a sprinkle of cinnamon, and about 3 tablespoons of melted butter.  Stir and put on top of the batter after you've filled your muffin cups.   Don't change the recipe for the batter--have faith, and just follow the recipe.  Excellent!

Fab!  All my kids loved these, and I loved how easy it was to pull off on a school morning!

* add on review: I tried this again today, first with a Krusteez Cranberry Orange Muffin Mix, and again with a Duncan Hines Decadent Carrot Cake Mix (which came with a separate raisin/dehydrated carrot package).  Both came out FABULOUS! I split a large can of pumpkin between the two mixes, using slightly more for the carrot cake as it was a larger mix (probably 3/5ths of the can).  In both cases I skipped the spices: I didn't want to overpower the Orange muffins, and the carrot cake already had spices in the mix.  I think I'll try adding nuts to the next batch!

I made these according to the original instructions.  I used Betty Crocker Gluten Free cake mix because they are for my son's class and there are allergies (I wanted to try spice cake but couldn't find in gluten free and there was no pumpkin pie filling at the store either!  I might try again with those tips others have listed).  The gluten free mix, however, is only 15 oz, but I still used all the pumpkin puree, though, because some had said they could be a bit dry.  Anyway, I think they turned out quite yummy and I was glad to have a recipe I could use for his class - with their gluten and egg allergies.

Oh emm gee!! I love pumpkin muffins from the coffee shop , but they're so expensive, fattening, and not available all year long. I happened to have all these inegredients, so I made them. Instead of all the spices, I used a tablespoon of pumpkin pie spice. I also topped them with brown sugar like another reviewer recommended. I thought the batter was too thick and was going to add an egg, but decided not to. They came out FABULOUS! So moist and chewy. I love the spice. And the brown sugar didn't melt like I thought it would, so it stayed a little crunchy. I'm definitely going to make these again and I think next time I'll make a crumb topping with flour, oatmeal, brown sugar and butter. So so easy and so delicious :)

These are deliscious and so easy! I normally make my own muffins from scratch but these are great as a time saver once in a while. I added 3 tsps of pumpkin pie spice and a 1/2 tsp of nutmeg as well as adding a a tiny bit of oil (maybe 2 tbsp) and chocolate chips of course! :)

These are some of my daughters' favorite muffins. I have a child who doesn't love overly sweet desserts and these mild and moist muffins are perfect for her!  I love them topped with a cream cheese icing, but she eats them plain. Easy, fast, and delicious!! I use pumpkin pie spice to make it even faster! In fact - I'm baking a batch today in Halloween liners to send in her care package to college!

Love these! I didn't have any chocolate, vanilla or pumpkin spice cake mix, so I used what I had on hand--strawberry cake mix. Wasn't too sure how the flavors would go together, but they came out REALLY tasty! I used my mini muffin pan, added a big chocolate chunk to the middle of each muffin, then sprinkled it with sugar in the raw. Came out great. 

Since I used strawberry cake mix, I didn't add the seasonings either. Just the mix and a can of plain pumpkin.

I'll definitely be making these again. Super easy, cheap and flavorful.

Wonderful! I made the recipe just as directed except I added a small sprinkle of brown sugar on the top of each muffin. I baked 12 muffins for 23 minutes and they came out moist and delicious! I am definitely saving this recipe!

These are the best! I love them! So easy. Followed directions as described, but omitted the ground cloves (not my favorite flavor) and added chopped walnuts. Delish! Followed other review and added some brown sugar to top. Baked 15 minutes. So moist and a sure flavor of fall!

Awesome!  Follow the recipe to a T - don't add egg or oil.  They raise just fine.  They may be moist enough to last a week, but too good to last that long in my house!

Five stars for the simplicity of this recipe! TWO ingredients: Spice Cake Mix + 1 Can Pumpkin Puree. These cupcakes are VERY moist and yes, dense. But for being a bit healthier without the egg and oil, it's worth it! Made some cream cheese frosting to go on top which them taste pretty much like a pumpkin roll...which I love. Took them to a reunion and they were devoured!

I kept it simple, just a yellow cake mix & a can of pumpkin... for the first batch. Then I got excited and did a batch with chopped walnuts and another with dark chocolate chips. Of the 36 that I made, 7 are left the next day! I am thinking of doing a dried cranberry addition, as well as an apple chunk addition. Yum!

I have made a cake out of this recipe instead of muffins, and I gotta say - it's just as good! I'm amazed that there were no eggs or oil added into this. I followed the recipe to a T, minus the cloves since I didn't have any. It was REALLY good, and very moist. I can't wait to make this easy recipe again! :)

Best muffins I have ever made 3x over. I have used this recipe THREE times and EVERY time they have come out PERFECTLY. They are moist but not soggy, if you follow the directions they bake perfectly!!!  (I suggest adding blueberries to 6 of the 12 and putting extra brown sugar on the top of the other 6, the displacement of the blueberries leaves extra batter for the non, so the non blueberries get "muffin tops"!)

I thought the muffins were very sweet and had too much cinnamon. they were very easy to put together. I too was scared when I realized there were no eggs or oil, but the consistency was fine. They are moist, but lacked flavor. I would suggest cutting back on the cinnamon and using pie mix seasoning instead. I also added walnuts to the top.

These are fantastic!  I've already made one batch and will be making 2 more tomorrow!  I tried another recipe similar to this but it had oil and eggs and they came out terrible!  I followed the recipe exactly as written except added tastefully simple mulling spices along with the original spices!  PERFECT!  You will be asked to make these all the time so be warned!

I changed this a bit and my teens can't get enough of em and they raised up nice and puffy.  I used white cake mix, 2 eggs, a lil vanilla, 1/2 cup of milk and 15 oz pumpkin oh and pumpkin spice (I doubled all of it to make 40 cupcakes)  WOW!!! So delicious!!

These are definitely easy, and I I did use pumpkin pie spice which was a good flavor.  The gal who wrote in that they weren't great to look at but easy and tasted good was on target.  I am wondering how anyone can make the muffins look like the picture.  I was very disappointed in that.  Please let know how they got them so rasied and rounded.  Mine didn't look like that.  Thanks.....Manakin-Sabot, Virginia

These are fantastic! I first heard about them at a Weight Watchers meeting, but came online and searched to find out how to bake them. I used a 15-ounce can of pumpkin, a spice cake mix, and a little less than 1/3 cup of water, and it made 16 muffins. My kids LOVE them!

Very moist and yummy! Great for small kids to help out with. I found that it tastes even better with spice cake mix. I just substituted the yellow cake mix and spices for the spice cake mix (because I was out of cloves). Turned out great!

This recipe is geat. It is easy. I made it using carrot cake mix and 1/2 cup raisins & walnuts. It is very moist. The batter is a little thicker but it doesn't matter as long as it taste good. My family loved them.

Easy & tasty--my favorite! I use a spice cake mix; you can eliminate the spices that way or add to your taste.

These turned out great! My three kids, even the pickiest, loved them! Good plain, or with cream cheese icing.  Only changed one thing out of necessity: I used 1 tbsp pumpkin pie spice instead of the spices listed, since didn't have ground cloves.

I make these as mini-muffins for my kids to bring to school parties.  Kids and parents gobble them up and everyone asks for the recipe.  The batter is dense, but I use a cookie scoop to fill the muffin tins.

I really like these muffins. They are so easy and taste great.  After reading other reviews, I tried it with Spice cake mix and then with yellow.  With the spice mix I added addtional spices (including ginger).  With the yellow mix, I doubled the recommended spices and added about 1/2 tsp. of ginger.  Also to make the batter easier to handle and moist, I added about 1/2 c. of apple juice. Everyone loves them...even kids of all ages!

my husband works on a farm and since fall is harvest season, there is little time for coffee breaks; i needed something easy transport and easy enough for him and all the staff to eat on the go. these pumpkin muffins are delicious and convenient for fast paced eating! i topped them with cream cheese frosting; sprinkled some nutmeg, cinnamon, clove & sugar for decoration :D

After reading all the reviews, and NOT wanting really dense muffins, I split the difference on my spice cake box instructions: I used 2 eggs (instead of 3), 1/4 cup oil (instead of 1/3 cup) and NO water. I added 3/4 cup of golden raisins and 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice. DELICIOUS! I plan to make these at Christmas for gifts using dried cranberries and nuts or chocolate to jazz them up.

To stretch the batter I added a little applesauce, 1 egg and about 2 tablespoons milk.  They were gone with in 24 hours all 3.5 dozen!  They don't rise as much but are moist and flavorful - also used allspice once when out of nutmeg.

I made these this past Sunday.  While mixing the ingredients I kept looking at the recipe. No egg?  No oil?  They baked up really nice.  My husband who dosent care for pumpkin tried  one and really liked it.  I used the second half of the batter for mini muffins and added chocolate chips.  He didnt even want to try those.  He LOVED them!  I will make this again and again

I thought these were delicious! I used spice cake and canned pumpkin. Since the batter was very thick I added about 4 teaspoon fulls of applesauce. Also threw in cinnamon, cloves & nutmeg. I topped it with a cream cheese frosting (made from scratch)

SOOO YUMMY! The dough was delish and we almost didn't cook it. My brother-in-law said it was the best pastry he had ever had (and he's had a lot of pastries). Used spice cake mix and a can of pumpkin and added some cinnamon and vanilla. Will make this again and again!

I did as other reviewers: added 1/3 cup oil and 2 eggs, and then I added heaping measurements of the spices and then I sprinkled in some Apple Pie spice as I didn't have any pumpkin pie spice.   I used my "8 mini loaf" pan and divided it out evenly (used a measuring 1/2 up to start).  Then I used the back of a spoon to smooth out.  Cooked for 25 min...PERFECT!  These are outstanding.  These are going to be added to the Christmas goody give aways!  Will post my picture later.

I had to change the flavor of cake mix.  I didn't have the yellow on hand, so I used Butter Pecan, and it was fabulous!!!    I also added about 1/2 cup of golden raisins.  This recipe was so simple and tasty; the muffins are extremely moist!  Thanks!

I have used many recipes with cake mixes over the years - some are great and some okay.  This one is just okay.  The ease of the recipe gives this at least  2 stars, but the texture of the result isn't really a muffin in my mind.  And, they stay so moist they almost become soggy if left for several days.  I don't plan on making these again, but enjoyed trying them out.

I was just too curious not to try this one.  These are fantastic!  My family loves pumpkin and these muffins are perfect-- not too overwhelming with the flavor, but just enough.  I would tell anyone to try the recipe as is.  I used a butter flavored cake mix and added the spices as directed.  Next time I'll try it with a pumpkin pie fillling to make it even faster...although it is quick and easy as it is.  Thanks for a new favorite breakfast/snack/dessert muffin!

Easy and delicious! Makes great mini-muffins and they freeze beautifully.  I have been known to add a little applesauce to thin out the batter a bit.

These are so good and so easy! I used a french vanilla cake mix and added some cinnamon chips and no other spices and they are wonderful. I mold my tops a bit to give them a neater look, but even the ugly ones are tasty!

Wow!  These muffins are delicious-- even the pickiest of eaters will love them! The only thing I would suggest is to smooth out the tops of the muffins before baking.  They turned out more like scones than muffins, but still awesome.  I also spooned a little brown sugar on the tops before baking to achieve a crumb topping.

Easy muffin recipe.  I made a few changes.  I added the spices with the cake mix and reserved 1/2 of the mix.  I added on large egg with the pumpkin.  To the reserved cake mix I added a tablespoon of margarine and a 1/4 cup brown sugar until it was well mixed and crumbly.  I sprinkled it over the batter in the muffin tins and lightly pressed it down.  Next time I will reduce cloves and add more cinnamon.  A definite make again recipe!

Wow! If I could give this 10 stars, I would. I didn't  have cloves but it still tasted great. All my co-workers rave about it. They can't believe it's so easy. Sometimes, I added chopped pecans and topped it with brown sugar and oats.

These muffins were an instant hit with family and friends.  I use two cups of fresh pumpkin instead of canned, and they are very moist.  I added extra spices for a stronger taste.  I used an ice scream scoop to fill my mini muffin tins, and they came out the perfect size.  Add some cinnamon cream cheese frosting for the perfect topping,

Good flavor, but muffins had a very heavy, doughy consistency.  I think that adding eggs would be a great idea for next.  Think about it, the cake mix calls for 24 cupcakes & were only making 12.  I also thought that the recipe needed more spices.  I would defintely try making again, but making these changes.

Othe people have debated whether or not to add eggs and oil to this recipe.  I added one egg and a dash of oil because I wanted to make sure mine were a little fluffy but plenty moist.  I also added some pinapple chunks (1 small can, well-drained) because I had them once in a delicious carrot muffin.  These muffins came out great, except they were almost too moist! The pinapple did not add that much to the recipe, and since I wanted someting simple, I'll probably just leave it out next time instead of trying to cut the chunks smaller to make them work.

These are great! I made mini-muffins and only cooked them for 13 minutes. Once they cooled, I topped them with an orange flavor icing (made from powder sugar) and they were wonderful. Everyone that tried them loved them! Great recipe!!

These are fantastic!!!!  I used a 16 oz. package of Trader Joes vanilla cake mix instead of the 18.25 oz. package of yellow cake mix.  I also used 2 teaspoons of Pumpkin Pie Spice instead of the cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves.  I baked them for 30 minutes.  They turned out great and the batter was not thick and doughy as some complained of.  They were very moist and yummy.  My husband said they were the best he's ever tasted and he is very picky.

Excellent recipe for those with egg-allergies or looking for egg-free recipes.  My neighbor made these and brought them over, they are INCREDIBLE.  You can even jazz them up w/chocolate chips.

Tastier than I expected. I used lemon cake mix and an extra 1/2 cup of pumpkin puree since it didn't seem very moist at 15 oz (I have a ton of puree from Halloween), I also added a little ginger. I definitely recommend dusting them with brown sugar for a sweet crust that also makes them a little more attractive. Thanks for the easy recipe.

These were great!  I used spice cake mix and added some pumpkin pie spice because I really love the taste of pumpkin.  Also, I turned them into a sweet dessert by frosting them with cream cheese frosting, which was really good.

I LOVE this recipe! I found it about 2 weeks ago and I've probably made about 5 batches since then! It is so easy and they are really yummy...my family eats them up in a day or two! Much healthier than other muffins as well.  I think I will go make some more now!

I just made these for my little boys.  I doubled the batch and used spice cake mix.  I also added 4 eggs, 1/3 cup of oil, and 4 tsp of pumpkin spice.  I made 24 mini muffins and 24 reg muffins.  The boys liked the mini muffins the best.  I loved the taste and thought texture was a little thick but still yummy!

Very moist.  Followed the recipe except I used Pumpkin Spice ( 1 1/2 tsp) plus 1/4 tsp clove and added 1/2 cup applesauce. I also added raw pumpkin seeds.  I would make them again but maybe roast the pumpkin seeds next time.

Not bad. I added an egg and a little oil. They are light and fluffy. Too sweet though, because of the cake mix. I wouldn't feed them to my kids for breakfast but they'll be a nice after-school snack. Don't honestly think I'll make these again unless I need something really quick.

Was delicious, the texture of the dough is a little weird, so the tops didn't come out smooth but they are good! Very fluffy and flavorful. I was expecting them to be a little bland. I will definitely make this again, VERY EASY!

Yummy!  I still added 2 eggs and 1/3 cup of oil, b/c I like fluffy muffins.  Even yummier with homemade cream cheese frosting.  Maybe these should be called pumpkin cupcakes.  :)

To be honest with you, I thought they were just OK. Mine were a bit gluey, and I followed the recipe exactly. I did use a cake mix with pudding in the mix because it was all I had on hand. This could have made the difference in the texture. I'll try again with plain yellow cake mix. You do have to be very careful to make sure all the cake mix lumps are mixed in really well.

A great quick and easy recipe!  2 ingredients is all you need.  I used a spice cake mix and pumpkin puree.  It is a bit difficult to mix by hand.  You can add cream cheese frosting for a sweet dessert too!

oh my gosh!  These were so yummy and easy.  I actually was surprised they turned out so well!  I followed the recipe ingredients exactly.  I used a hand mixer though, which helped the muffins rise.  I added a crumb topping, but I'm sure they will be just as good without it!  Yummy!

These muffins are very moist and delicious. I tried the suggested spice cake mix and sprinkled brown sugar on top of each.  Really yummy and easy!  Will definitely make again, but double the recipe so there are more to enjoy!

Very Yummy! I was a little concerned with the consistency when I was mixing so I added 1 egg white and about 1/2c water. I used 1/2 TBSP pumpkin pie spice instead of each of the other spices. I baked them in mini bundt pans and then placed them on top of eachother to make pumpkin shapes! Cute and very yummy!

These are quick and easy to make. I used a package of spice mix instead the yellow cake mix. I added just a dash more of each spice, with about 1/2c no sugar added applesauce. These are dense, moist and taste great. I rate 4 stars because I would like them to be a bit more fluffy, but when using canned pumpkin for baking it is hard to get anything fluffy.

THese are WONDERFUL.  A great source of fiber as well.  I tell my daughter they are cupcakes and add a homemade frosting of powdered sugar, vanilla, butter nutmeg and a splash of milk.  not good for you at this point, but still better than a cupcake!

Quick, easy and very, very yummy.  I beat them by hand but will use the mixer next time in order to mix the cake mix into the pumpkin better.  I added 1/2 cup water which I will leave out next time. I made 24 muffins out of this recipe. Each equals one point on the Weight Watchers plan. What a great treat.

Delicious!  More like a cake than a hearty-breakfast-kind-of-muffin - obviously since it uses a cake mix.  I added 1 egg and just a little oil since I only had about 2/3 can of pumpkin.  Would be a fantastic cupcake with some cream cheese frosting.

Can it get any easier than this?  These muffins were delicious and gobbled up by my family before they were cool!  I'm going to try them again with the Spice Cake suggestion, but the recipe was stupendous as written.

I love to make this recipe for my kids. I make them into mini muffins so they can take them for lunch. I make about 2 batches at a time and I freeze them in individual baggies so we can just grab them each day for them lunches. Highly recommend this recipe

I'm going to give this recipe a 5 because not only was it good, but it was soooooo easy.  Took the advise of others and used the spice cake with the spices already added to the pumkin.  2 items, and basically no clean up!  Thanks

Definitely easy- I used 2t Pampered Chef's Cinnamon Plus spice instead of the individual spices listed.  They were tasty, but even though cooked 35-40 minutes, they still had a raw batter feel/taste when cooled and cut.

I actually didn't really care for these but my husband and daughter thought they were great.  Plus, I didn't want to discount the great simplicity of the recipe since I think the components that I used made it less than ideal for my taste.  I used the Trader Joe's Vanilla baking mix, 2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice, and a can of sweet potato puree.  The pumpkin pie spices and the strong vanilla in the cake mix competed to heavily for my taste.  I'll definitely try again with different flavors.

I have made these muffins twice now. I'm not all that sure about them. The consistency is odd. Even though they are cooked through, they seem to have an unbaked feel. I don't think I will make them again.

This recipes is awesome and very versatile.  I have used the spice cake mix with the pumpkin to make the muffins, a bundt cake, and cookies.  I used two bundt cakes put together to make it into a pumpkin with cream cheese frosting for Halloween.  I also made cookies and added cinnamon chips.  Today I made the muffins for tomorrow at work with cinnamon chips and frosted them with cream cheese frosting.

Even though I thought they were too dense, I'm giving this 4 stars because everyone else who tried these loved them.  I used 1 can of pumpkin pie filling and used pumpkin pie spice instead of nutmeg.

It is SCARY how fast and easy this is. Mine was 2 items: spice cake mix and one can of pumpkin pie FILLING, then into the muffin pan.  Furthermore, they come out great!?!?!  A baking miracle...no doubt. Can't wait to experiment with more combinations!

Say no to eggs and oil with the recipe. The pumpkin batter doesn't look like it should work, but have some faith. I used funfetti cake mix, and it came out wonderfully. My second batch I added two single serving portions of quaker instant oatmeal maple brown sugar flavor. I also added some pumpkin pie spice with the cinnamon. Absolutely delicious!

I loved these muffins!  I also took some advice from the reviews and made a couple changes:  I used spice cake mix and pumpkin pie filling, so there was plenty of flavor.  I also added brown sugar to the top, because, well, everything's better with brown sugar. :) I would definitely make these again - maybe I'll try mini-muffins next time.

These are not pretty, but they're delicious, super moist, easy, and very cheap to make!  I used a can of pumpkin pie mix instead of plain pureed pumpkin and skipped the spices.  I'll definitely be making these on a regular basis!

I've made this recipe with my pre-school class and it was a big hit! As others have suggested, I use one box of spice cake mix and one can of pumpkin puree. For home enjoyment, I add dark chocolate chips. These muffins have become a snack-time staple. Thanks for a great recipe!

Yummy! These were so simple to make! Just 4 ingredients! (I don't like cloves.) They were incredibly moist!

Needs a little more spice.  The consistancy was okay, and the overall flavor was fine, but the pumpkin undertone was rather bland. Maybe doubling the seasonings or adding a cream cheese frosting would help.

Wow, these things are addicting and so much easier if you cheat and use a spice cake mix like previous reviewers suggested!  I was going to make these with the spices indicated, but I only had one - and they were too expensive to purchase them, so Spice Cake mix was used and these are amazingly delish!  DON'T put ANY eggs or oil or anything else in these - they are *supposed* to be very dense.  You can even make these as cookies if you so desired.  I have my friend and her husband addicted to these, just like me!

made it today with some Cinnamon Honey butter (recipe on this site too!) and they were a BIG hit.  Had some friends over for a Christmas brunch and they all raved about how good the muffins were.  I felt guilty cause they were soooo darn easy!

Make your life easy and use SPICE CAKE instead of yellow cake. You will NOT need to add the cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves if you use spice cake instead of yellow cake. All I do is use the pumpkin puree, spice cake and add 1/3 cup milk.Now for the rating...these are absolutely the BEST muffins. My whole family love them and they stay fresh for so long.

Not the prettiest muffins I've ever made... They're really not that attractive at all, but muffins can be like that sometimes. I was a bit skeptical about not adding eggs or oil or anything, but I decided to take a chance and they really are miraculous. They're very moist and tasty. I used a spice cake mix instead of yellow, and they're much more flavorful this way.

Easy to make. I made according to recipe. I did not taste pumpkin..I tasted the spices. It is more like a cupcake than muffin. Good..will make again w/ spice cake mix.

Easier then pumpkin pie.  My kids loved them.  I put a strussel topping on them for crunch.  I used a mixer to mix the ingredients and I think it might have given too much air to the muffins as they were not as dense as muffins should be.  Today I am making them again but will sift the cake mix to get any lumps out and mix by hand.

Great Recipe!  I love anything pumpkin!  I used what I had on hand... I substituted Butter Pecan Cake Mix for the yellow cake mix... and 3/4 tbsp of pumpkin pie spice.  I also had an egg yolk in the refrigerator from another new recipe so I threw that in as well.  The muffins turned out wonderfully!  I served with butter and honey!  Delicious!  I'll definitely make again!

This is a great recipe. I chose to go with the yellow cake mix instead of substituting a spice cake because the mixes themselves really do have a different flavor. These are delicious. I think that I still prefer regular muffins. These are almost too sweet but this recipe is fabulous when time or laziness is a constraint.

I have tried this recipe but using a Spice cake and adding the spices if you want more is easier for me. Also I always add a teaspoon of vanilla.

Very easy to make. Since the batter was thick I put it in a pastry bag and piped it into the muffin tins. Then I wet my finger tips and tamped down the top to make it smooth. Really tasty and now my house smells good!

i made these muffins for a nutrition group and was pleasantly suprised at how tasty they are considering they are so simple and relatively healthy. We opted to use a packaged spice cake mix and add only cinnamon for the spice. I agree with the reviewer who said these do not need any liquid. I too, thought the batter was way too thick but the end result was a moist, delicious muffin. We didn't frost them (some diabetics in the group) and although they werent the most attractive muffin i've seen, they tasted great and im sure if you added frosting they would look just as great!

These were really good.  I used a devil's food cake mix since it is what I had.  Also, I used pumpkin pie filling since it has all the spices in it already.  I made cakes instead of muffins because I do not have cupcake tins.  This was so easy and quick to make but tasted like they took more time to make.

OMG! The easiest thing that I've done all week. These are great! I was quite skeptical at first but I was thrilled at how moist that they are.  I added rasins and some brown sugar on top but just delish inside.  I will make these again soon.

I love these - and they are a low fat option.  Of course, they do not stay moist as long b/c of that, but they are super easy and good.

I made these with a chocolate cake mix. They were very easy to make (especially using the freezer bag idea), but the taste was odd. I didn't like the doughy, dense texture either.

Not bad, but I've had better. They were a little too sweet to be seasonal in my opinion. I think using a spice cake mix would be better.

The entire family loved this recipe. I made the batter as is and we loved the dense, doughy texture. I did sprinkle a little brown sugar on top for a crunch and in some we put cream cheese in the middle and that was very yummy too. Will make again!

I added one egg just because I was unsure about the recipe..and it turned out great.  I also topped it with cream cheese frosting.  So good!  Next time I think I'll try the recipe as is and skip the egg.

Very good and a good recipe to keep in your "back pocket" because it is easy to have the ingrediants on hand.  I baked as the recipe stated and the result was very good.

These were the beast muffins I've ever tasted.  They were very moist but done all the way through.  I added a few chopped walnuts, but it would be still great without them.  I baked them for only 20 minutes.

My kids can't get ENOUGH of these muffins. I took somebody's suggestion and used a spice cake mix and no spices, and they turend out PERFECT!  My kids would eat the whole dozen if I allowed them too! I've also made this recipe with a chocolate mix and talk about a chocolate FIX! HEAVEN! I've frozen them and simply reheated in the microwave for 30 seconds and they are just as good! SUCH AN AWESOME, EASY, AND DELISH recipe!

I added chocolate chips to the batter, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  The combination of chocolate and pumpkin is delightfully yummy!  I too was skeptical of the stiff batter, but they turned out lovely.

These were good as well as easy to make.  I added an egg and then put dried cranberries in half the batter.  I frosted some muffins and sprinkled brown sugar on others.

these were alright. nothing special. the taste was good, but the consistency was much too doughy for me. it helped get rid of leftover pumpkin , but it's not likely i will make these again.

These are fine, but probably wouldn't make again. I mixed them in a ziploc bag, as suggested, and they were really easy and clean to make. However, I cut a small hole in the corner of the bag and when they came out of the oven they looked exactly like dog poo! This would be great to use as a practical joke!

5 stars for super easy and great flavor.
i used spiced cake instead of yellow so i didn't have to add any spices. the dough is sticky and a pain to work with but made a great, high fiber treat.

Yummy muffins!! I made the muffins exactly as the directions called for, except that I added 1 cup of milk because the batter was a bit difficult to work with, and the muffins turned out perfect! This is another recipe that I will make again and again!

This recipe is super easy!  It's great when you need something fast and simple.  For people who are confused about the directions, it just takes the dry cake mix and a can of pumpkin.  (I used pumpkin pie mix and dark chocolate cake mix.  I also threw in some chocolate chips.  Yum!)  As other reviewers have stated, the muffins come out of the oven shaped like they went in so if you want a more presentable muffin, use an ice cream scoop or smooth out the tops before baking.  These muffins are rich, heavy, decadent ones that are great for using up leftover cans of pumpkin or must making something at the last minute.

I made these with a can of 30 oz. pumpkin pie filling.  I obviously didn't read the recipe.  Anyway they turned out pretty darn good.  Next time I will use 3/4th of the can of pumpkin pie filling.

I made these (mini muffins) as a snack for my daughters Sunday school class and the kids loved them! Her teacher said his son is so picky, and he ate 4 of them! I followed the recipe almost exactly, I just omitted the nutmeg and cloves- the cinnamon stood alone fine and made them more kid friendly. I have also frosted them w/ cream cheese icing for dessert. This one's a keeper!!!

Excellent recipe!  I found the batter a little too thick and after reading some of the other reviews, decided to tweak the recipe just a little.  I added 1 cup of milk to the batter to thin it out a bit and add a calcium punch!  Worked great!  I also used a carrot cake mix instead of yellow.  Will definitely be making this one on a regular basis.

These are very easy, but I made some pumpkin bread at the same time (also from a recipe here), and these muffins just didn't compare.  They are moist and tasty, but I am not sure if I will make them again. My family seemed to like them though.

SO good! I didn't have any ground cloves or nutmeg, so I used allspice instead; I also added an egg. I'm sure the recipe would be wonderful without these minor changes. I definently recommend it!!

They were okay. Second time I tried this: One box SPICE cake mix, the pumpkin and one egg. That eliminates the spice mixture and these were even moister and had more of a "harvesty" flavor. They did not last a day. Great for breakfast, snack, etc..

Since I most certainly wanted a muffiny muffin, I took the advice of adding the milk and eggs. I love it. YUM! This was a great base.

I prepared the yellow cake mix as directed on the box and then added the pumpkin pie filling and spices.  Also added walnuts and raisins.
Was a little nervous at how wet the batter was.  They did need additional baking time which I feared was going to dry them out.  I never got to sample one as I made them for my church group.  I dropped them off since I wasn't able to attend the function. At our next meeting I was bombarded by women who wanted the recipe.  They raved about how tasty and moist they were.  You never know!  Next time I'll cut the eggs to 2 and 3/4 cup applesauce instead of oil.  I'll just watch the consistency of the batter as I add the ingredients.  Can't wait to make them again and finally taste one!

Tasty but a little dense for my liking.

These taste good and hopefully my toddler will like them as an eggfree Halloween treat while his friends feast on cupcakes and cookies. I needed to add 1/2 cup of water to get the pumpkin incorporated into the cake mix.

These are wonderful! The texture is somehow dense and fluffy. I used 2t cinnamon, 1t fresh nutmeg, and 1/2 c chopped walnuts. I added no extra liquid, and they couldn't be more moist.

Solid recipe - I made some modifications per the reviews, and used a box of yellow cake mix, 2 eggs, 1/3c oil, a tablespoon of honey, and instead of cloves, used 1/4tsp of allspice (didn't feel like grinding the whole cloves I had).

In a mini-muffin pan at 350F, sprinkled the top with brown sugar and left for 28 minutes.  Perfection - maybe a little more cupcake than muffin, but the audience were little kids and they loved 'em!

I used: 
1 Box of Betty Crocker Super Moist Carrot Cake Mix
1/2 can of Libby's Easy Pumpkin Pie Mix (30 oz)
1 egg
2 Tbl butter (I had this left over from buttering the bottom of the muffin tins and didn't want to throw it away).
No spices, since both the pumpkin and cake mix already had it.

It was great.  My kids loved them!

These muffins are good, but not great.  I did top them with brown sugar as other reviewers recommended and that definitely made a big difference.

The flavor of these isn't what I wanted at all. I think the spices have too much of a bite to them. They are moist, however, and at least my roommates are eating them. I was really excited about making these and was extremely disappointed. They also became moldy after about two days.

I just made these muffins and was not impressed.  I followed the recipe exactly.  They didn't have the texture or flavor I was looking for. Maybe I beat the mixture too long?  The only reason I give this 4 stars is the my 2yr old loved them, but he was the only one.

This recipe is great and easy to make. I made it for a holiday party at work and everyone loved them. I followed the recipe exactly but it took me 30 minutes to bake.

This recipe is just okay. I used it because I was out of eggs, and this is extremely easy with just a few ingredients. It tastes pretty good, but it's nothing exceptional.

I followed the cake box mix directions, adding three eggs, though only half a stick of margarine instead of the required full stick, because the canned pumpkin added some moisture.  I added about double the amount of spices in their proper proportions, then about a teaspoon of sugar.  The recipe made 24 regular-sized, moist and chewy muffins.  It was a real hit with my friends!

This recipe is totally yummy and extremely easy. You can also add a cup of white chocolat morsels or walnuts or butterscotch morsels or whatever you fancy.
