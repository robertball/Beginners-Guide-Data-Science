I made it, it was great.  I would give it 5 stars, but I made modifications, I made it by reydrating dreid cranberries to give it a little zing.  Was simple and deilcious.  I may try omitting the brown sugar all together next time.  Thanks for the recipe

I really liked the spices in this recipe. I will leave out the raisins next time because I don't think they are needed. The carrots with the spices are flavorful enough.

Made this a puree for baby, yum! Used apple juice instead of wine, halved the butter and skipped the sugar. I'm sure he'll love it and our house smells amazing! Thanks for the recipe :)

this was really yummy -- I used cider instead of wine - but it was very sweet, especially with the raisins.  I made it again without the raisins and it was plenty sweet - sometimes I make it without the brown sugar too.  still good!

I love the spices. I will definitely keep this recipe  and use it again. I was looking for a good recipe for carrots that didn't use sugar. Thanks for sharing.

Like others' suggestions I used butter and a small number of raisins. Guessed on proportions as I made just 2 servings.

Delicious and very easy addition to my pot roast with potatoes as I'd eaten all of the carrots originally cooked in the gravy. Thank you for this recipe. Will be making it again.

I made this recipe last night and it was a hit with my husband. I did make a few revisions. I used butter rather than margarine and as others commented I didn't use the full amount of raisins. I used regular raisins as I didn't have any golden raisins which I think would be better. I'll be making this recipe again for a family dinner but I think I will use dark brown sugar next time.

I made this for a side dish for dinner tonight. I like how the flavors are subtle but distinct nonetheless! It’d be great for a special dinner if you wanted something less sweet but still classy! Thanks for sharing this recipe! It’s a keeper and easy to make! (I used a 12oz. bag of frozen carrots and reduced the servings to 3 so the other ingredients would be proportionate.)

Delicious!  It tasted like a quick tsimmes!  It was a big hit with my group.  I did go with butter instead of margarine and used about half the amount without sacrificing any taste.

Not what I expected. Used wine and apple cider to cook the carrots in. Too many raisins.

I used Apple cider instead of the wine then reduced the juice to a glaze, added dark brown sugar and salt. Yum!

Uhhhhh...YUM!  I tried this one on my son and his girlfriend and we all loved it.  I followed the recipe almost exactly (something I never do) using marsala wine because it was all I had on hand.  I think that 2/3 cup raisins was a bit much so I'll cut that back a tiny bit next time but I will certainly make it again.
