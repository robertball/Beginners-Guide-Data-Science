This recipe is easy and delicious.  I usually leave out the hard boiled egg however.

Seemed a little heavy on the corn starch. I am thinking this is the cause of some of the negative comments. I backed it off to 4 tablespoons and was much more like gravy as I know it. Will try 3 tablespoons next time. Also, the water quality makes a difference. I now use Reverse Osmosis purified water(I have an RO system). Makes a difference in many dishes.

This was the best giblet gravy I have ever tasted.  My family has never consumed my giblet gavy in the past.  This one they ate every bit of it and were wishing for more.  It made a medium sized bowl full of gravy.  I'll double it next year so there will be plenty for my very large family.

I think the starch should be cut in half. I usually follow all directions the first time and the taste was great but I like my gravy a little more runny...

I followed recipe exactly, big mistake. The amount of cornstarch was too much making the "gravy" very gelatinous and runny at the same time, like a jello soup. Thanks but no thanks, I will go a different route next time.

This recipe was easy and very tasty! I went with the advice of another post and used 3tsp of cornstarch instead. As the gravy sits, it thickens. It was great!

After reading reviews, I adjusted the cornstarch. So it was not super thick, like my grandmotherâ€™s, but it had the wonderful flavor I remember.

This turned into a gelatinous mess. Tasted ok, but felt like a film of it was stuck to my palate until the next morning.

Followed directions but it turned out extremely gelatinous. Taste was ok but couldn't eat it.

I didn't have corn starch at home so I used potato meal. I didn't measure anything, but it turned out great! Thanks!

Love the receipt, had all the ingredients needed in the pantry. This was my first time ever making giblet gravy and it turned out good.
