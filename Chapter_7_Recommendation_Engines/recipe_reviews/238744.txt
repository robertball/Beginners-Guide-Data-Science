This was excellent.  I increased the recipe and added sliced mushrooms as I was cooking the onion and bacon pieces.   Also used sharp cheddar cheese.  I didn't have corn tortillas on hand,  but I did have flat whole wheat lavash bread--it worked wonderfully well as crust in a 9 x 13 pan.  The corn added a nice texture and as a leftover, this quiche tasted better the next day.  Will make again.
