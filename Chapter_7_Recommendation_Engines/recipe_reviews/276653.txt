This is a great dish! I made it with chicken, but pork would be great too, and I pan grilled the corn to a golden brown with a tablespoon of oil and a half a jalapeño and a pinch of red pepper flakes before adding it to pot. I also cooked the chicken in the oven, sauted onions on the cooktop.  Cooked it the whole pot down on the stove instead of using instapot, though I was not intending to do that when I started the dish. It is wonderful, family loved it.  I don't quite understand the negative reviews.  I used frozen roasted hatch chilis.  Served over rice. Yummy.

Some reviewers need to take a chill pill. I actually made this chili and it is quite tasty.  I served it over black beans and rice; probably another faux pas that I don't care about.  Maybe the poster should change the name to just Chili Verde to eliminate the controversy.   Anyway, I added an extra can of beans and some more chicken to increase the number of servings.  (In addition to serving over rice.)  Also, I used Poblanos since they were what was available to me.  (Gasp!)    The family loved it!

I made it with our superior, local Pueblo chili’s and it turned out great. Try it on mashed potatoes, it great, or on an open faced burger, both are Pueblo, Colorado traditions!

Okay, it's a pretty good Chile Verde, but really, you should be using pork shoulder, not chicken. Substitute cubed pork, trimmed of some fat, for the chicken and follow the rest. Much more succulent and delicious to me. Oh, and if it's not Hatch season? Buy frozen ones and defrost. They're not available fresh in the winter.

This is NOTHING like the regional green chile you will find in CO or NM.  What it is, is a shameless promotion of the NM Hatch chile pepper, which is mediocre at best.

Very good flavors and my whole family loved it.  I added an orange pepper and did not have white beans, so I used kidney beans.  Also did not have corn on the cob but used a can of hominy instead.  I served it over rice and we used tortilla chips on the side. Would make again!

This was absolutely delicious.  I’m from Colorado, but a transplant to California, and this recipe reminds me of home :). The best smothered burritos on the planet come from Colorado.  The only change I made was adding a package of bacon that I cut into chunks.  Because bacon.

Easy to make- great flavor. Couldn't find the hatch green chilis in the recipe, so I used Anaheim chilis and roasted them in the oven. Didn't use potato starch and it was plenty thick. Served Chili over diced avocado and topped with tortilla chips.
