I used precooked rice with this recipe - it was fantastic!  I agree that there probably isn't enough water to fully cook dry rice, however, this dish turned out great!

This was really good, my Husband doesn't really care for rice and he loved it. I did substitute long grain rice for the minute rice because that was all I had at home.

This was a super quick and delicious side dish.  I used shredded sharp cheddar in place of the pasteurized cheese product.  In addition, I happened to have some homemade chicken stock that really added a ton of flavor to the rice. Everyone at my dinner table had seconds. I will definitely make this again!

This went over okay at my dinner table. Due to suggestions from the children (5 of them) I will use "real" cheese next time. Regular rice will suit us better too I think even though it will take longer to cook. We will try again!

I don't think this recipe is written correctly because there isn't enough liquid to cook the rice. The idea is good though. I used part cheddar and part swiss cheese because I don't like the processed stuff. Good taste but too dry even after I added more liquid. I'll try this one again some time with some modifications.

This was good. I added corn, peas, and leftover chicken to make it our meal rather than a side dish. I also used brown rice rather than white.

With or without cheese, this is a good side dish.  It's a great way to get in some extra vegetables.

I think this recipe is fine...not sure why so many others are having a problem with the liquid amount...when you make Minute Rice, the recipe is equal parts rice and water...so two cups of rice to two cups of broth is exactly right...

This was delicious, and easy.  I did use cheddar cheese, instead of cheese product, so it was a bit watery.  I might try a different cheese next time.

This is so easy and so, so good!  I use a mix of cauliflower and brocolli so my 2yr old doesn't know what shes eating and she loves it!  Didn't change recipe at all.

Easy to make. Kids weren't big fans of it.  Probably won't make again.

The only change I made was to use shredded mozzarella instead of the cheese product. MMMMm It had a great flavor. This will definitely be incorporated into our menu choices.

i love how easy this was! i made this for my 3 year old and 10 month old and the broccoli was gone in front of them far before the rice.  instead of using block cheese, i used a fair amount of shredded mozzarella. but other than that little change, i followed this recipe exact.   definitely will make this again!
