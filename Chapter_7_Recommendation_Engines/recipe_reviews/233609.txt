I altered this recipe by using a cast iron dutch oven and finishing it in the oven instead of on the stovetop.  I set the oven at 225 and let it slow cook for three hours instead of on the stovetop as the recipe says.  I also used barbeque sauce instead of ketchup.

This recipe is a winner and I will definately add it to my favorites.

Made it the first time following the instructions to the dot. It just tasted like ketchup, that was the only flavor we could taste. Out of desperation, I added about 2 table spoons of Worcester Sauce  because ketchup brisket did not taste pleasant. That was it! Just add a bit of Worcester to taste and this is amazing! There's a ton of sauce left over from the brisket and it's really good with shredded chicken too.

Great base recipe! It would've been on the bland side without adding a few ingredients to make it BBQ style. I used white balsamic vinegar instead of apple cider, I added a little more salt, a little less chili powder, and added a good "shakin'" of McCormick BBQ seasoning. It came out so dang good, we are looking forward to the sandwiches tomorrow!

I made this as it was stated, but I left out the cayenne. My family all liked this a LOT, I liked it okay. I have never liked sweet and sour dishes though, which this reminded me of. I could taste the vinegar and sugar over anything else. I would make this  again but i would tweek it somehow. I also used flour to thicken the sauce and make it like a gravy and ate it over mashed potaoes, the potatoes seemed to  even out the taste for me. I started on the stove top and finished it in the oven 225 for 4 hours. Meat was tender.

It was very good the first night. The next night the gravy thickened up and made it a lot better.
