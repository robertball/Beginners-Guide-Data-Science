I changed this a bit I used 1 TBS lemon juice insted of lemon and lime (also winter in England so lemons aren't exactly in season). I also added two spring onions and 2 cloves garlic chopped up and 1/2tsp honey when cooking the chicken. Then I served it on top of a romaine salad that had been tossed with a bit of olive oil lemon salt pepper and Parmesan. Yummy! Very good for the diet effort as well!

My boyfriend loved this - he was still talking about it 3 days later! I kept the chicken breasts whole and coated in the dijon mixture browned in the skillet and then mixed in more dijon mixture along with about a 1/2 cup of chicken broth and a heaping spoonful of sour cream. I did find the dijon mix to be a little tart and on the salty side (due to the mustard I presume) and the broth and sour cream helped with that. I finished cooking the chicken in this sauce and covered with foil so it wouldn't dry out. I also mixed in some dried parsley at the end to help balance the flavors. Served with white rice and green beans. My boyfriend has already asked for it again - thanks the great quick idea!

Quick and easy both for cooking and clean-up. I've made this several times already. On all occasions I added a small bit of soy sauce and worcestershire sauce to balance the citrus and dijon just a tad and also added a dash of garlic salt to the recipe. Very tasty and cooked on very low heat it comes out very juicy! Served it with white rice and steamed veggies.

The lemon & lime gave this a nice depth. Based on other reviews I reduced the Dijon by half and it was about perfect.

It was really quick and easy to make and it tasted pretty good. Although I love lemon the lemon flavor was a little overwhelming. However I was eyeballing it and may very well have put in too much lemon juice. I'll follow the directions to a T next time I make this meal.

This was a pretty good recipe. I made it exactly as specified except that I probably used less Dijon mustard than the 4 tbsp. specified. (I wanted to use up a little 2 oz. bottle I got from a hotel and it measured out to probably less than 3 tbsp.). Also I cooked the dish for 18 minutes instead of 15 just to make sure the thick pieces of chicken were well-cooked. Even still they stayed juicy not at all dried-out. I'm not especially a fan of mustard flavors but the resulting dish was mildly mustardy and I thought the citrus flavors were mild too (my palate isn't discerning enough to tell the lime from the lemon). I didn't much notice the pepper and Creole-style seasonings when I ate it so I wish I'd put more in (I usually like strong flavors). I served this on a simple bed of white rice and it lasted me for about three meals. The flavor didn't wow me all that much but it was pretty good; and since the dish is so quick and easy to make I'll give the recipe overall a 4-star rating.

Quick and easy! This recipe is definitely a new go-to meal for weekdays when I have less time to think about it and prepare. I'll use a little less Dijon next time per some reviews I added soy sauce and sour cream. Served over rice with steamed vegetables. Healthy quick and tasty!

This was okay. The flavor was good but a skillet is the wrong way to go. Next time I'd try to bake it I think.

Many points for easy tasty and healthy. Not a full 5 stars because it was a little dull to my taste. Although the lemon and lime juice cut the mustard taste a little it still tasted like Chicken coated in mustard. But since it is so easy and so healthy I'll make it again but next time I'll double the lemon and lime juice and add more Creole seasoning. By the way- I don't know why I've never made a very simple dish of cut up chicken breast without a lot of other stuff but boy cutting up the breast makes it seem like a bigger serving for those who are dieting and tired of that little chicken breast on their plate.

This is a great "back-pocket" recipe. It is quick easy delicious and healthy. No added salt or oil here! I made the recipe with no changes and it was fabulous. If you are not a huge fan of Dijon Mustard you might consider cutting it back just a little bit. Although I did not find the Dijon flavor overwhelming at all when prepared according to the directions. Served over salad greens with a light greek vinaigrette.

I just love this recipe! It's my go-to on a night when I don't have a lot of time or don't want to make a lot of effort. I use a garlic-Dijon mustard (b/c that's what I keep in my fridge) and it's great every time. Steam some rice and veggies in a rice cooker and voila!

My husband loved this! I skipped the creole seasoning and used Mrs. Dash hot and spicy (just a little) to help with the sodium content. I also added chili powder to taste and sprinkled a little on top before serving. I too only used lemon juice instead of lime. This tasted great! Served it with caramelized onions on the side the sweet and sour went great together!

I doubled the recipe for my family of four. Husband daughter and I loved it. Youngest thought it was a little too spicy. Based on other reviews I cut down the lemon juice and dijon mustard a bit. Next time I will use the original direction's recommended lemon juice measurements but will continue to reduce the dijon mustard. I served over rice and with a green salad. Yummy dinner!

Great recipe! I had some ground mustard in my fridge too so I threw it in there with the dijon mustard and it added a fun texture. Definitely a very fast and easy recipe that I will repeat!

The lemon lime and Dijon flavors were so overpowering my husband and I could not eat it. We both really like a strong mustard but it was just too much. I would recommend halving the mustard lemon and lime juices as the citrus flavors were also way too strong. Made my mouth pucker!

We really liked this. One thing we did though was to not cook it with the cajun seasoning-- we left it for each of us and our kids to decide if and how much to sprinkle on. We also chopped up some red bell pepper and cooked it with the chicken.

This recipe was awesome. I perked it up a bit adding some honey using cajun spice instead of creole and only using a bit of the dijon to taste. I served it with chopped peppers onions and celery and cooked that in the same pan after the chicken was mostly cooked to braise it in the same spices. I added a bit of white wine and chicken broth. And then put the chicken back in the pan to finish cooking. I served this on a bed of rice. It was amazing. Next time I think I may even throw in some pineapple.

I hate to give a low rating but this was really overpowered by the citrus and especially the mustard and I used less of both. It wasn't horrible but it wasn't that good either; it just had too much of a very strong flavor. I won't be making this again.

I used ingredients as instructed and added garlic powder dash of soy dash worcestershire splash of white wine. It was good & I'll prepare again. Next time I'll use sliced fresh mushrooms and small amount of chicken broth. I'll try thickening it w/sour cream (after sauce has cooked) as someone else suggested and serve over whole wheat pasta. Easy recipe to modify to your own personal taste.

I cut the chicken up into bite-size pieces and dredged them in eggs & flour mixture before cooking to make it easier for my toddlers to eat. I also doubled the sauce and used Herb de Province in place of the terragon because that is what I had. Very tasty with rice pilaf.

I used the juice of one lime and did not use the lemon at all. I also marinated the cut up chicken in the spices and lime for about 15 min. added the mustard then put all in the preheated skillet. I cook covered and added chicken broth as needed to get the liquidy consistency I wanted for covering my pasta. Very very tasty!

It's an o.k. taste but definately not something to eat alone. I put it into a salad with mushrooms and honey mustard dressing. It wasn't too bad but I think something else would go better with it than mushrooms.

This recipe is really easy to make. However the dijon is a little strong for me. It would be better if I could find a way to tone down the mustard taste.

Really good after I changed it a bit. But after that it was FANTASTIC! We will be making this a lot more. First (for 4 person serving) I used about 3 tablespoons of Dijon and 3 tablespoons of whole grain Dijon mustard. The same amount of lime and lemon that it call for. About 2-3 tbls of honey. I didn't have creole seasoning so I used about a teaspoon of "Bone Dust" seasoning. Salt and pepper to taste. I added mushrooms to the dish. First browned 1 1/2 shallots and 2 cloves of garlic in olive oil in my Le Creuset dutch oven. Tossed in the mushrooms and let them cook for about 3 minutes. Then I added 2 1/2 lbs of Chicken breast tenders. Poured in the sauce and tossed. Covered with the top and let it cook over the stove for about 10-15 minutes. We served it with the option of mash potatoes or white rice. It was equally good with both. Cauliflower tasted great with the flavors.

Excellent dish. Easy to make and few ingredients. Very flavorful. Could use a good base like rice or a more delicate hand than my own with spices. Cook time is forgiving and chicken can be left on heat without drying out for 5-10 minutes to allow other dishes to be ready.

I used 1 tbsp of the creole seasoning and took into account some of the previous reviewers suggestions: halving the Dijon mustard adding 1/4 cup chicken broth 2 tbsps of fat free sour cream 1 tsp honey and a splash of soy sauce. It was still a little tangy for my taste so I think I will just use the lime juice and 1 tbsp of dijon. I too served over brown rice with steamed veggies. All in all it was really easy and the sauce has the potential to be amazing! Thanks for a great recipe!

My husband loved this! But it was just okay for me. I liked the combination of flavors but it seemed like it needed sugar or honey to cut the sour flavor. I think this could potentially be a 5 star recipe for me if I experimented with adding other ingredients to make it sweeter. However my husband doesn't want me to mess with it. He made sandwiches with it and I ate it with rice. I'll probably make this again sometime because it's healthy and easy.

Used Zatarains Creole and this just made it really salty. I would use a different Creole seasoning.

I thought this recipe was okay. It's not my favorite but I'm not a huge fan of Dijon mustard. My boyfriend really liked it though. I served it with steamed broccoli and wild rice. I followed the recipe exactly minus the Creole style seasoning only b/c I didn't have it on hand. Pretty good though.

I thought this recipe was great! I did change it a little though.... omitted the lime added a bit of chicken stock and added minced fresh garlic. I used all fresh ingredients and this came out wonderful! A nice easy dish for a way too busy person!

My husband and I both like this one very much! It's a little too heavy on the mustard for me but when paired with wheat pasta that helps soak up some of the overwhelming taste of the mustard. For mustard lovers like my husband it's perfect.

My boyfriend and I LOVE this recipe! I actually have to give him credit since he was the one who made and discovered it first. Such a flavorful easy recipe! I've been making it for over two years and I plan on keeping it around many more. Great for last minute meal idea since the ingredients are basic items most people keep in their fridge. The only suggestion I have is to cook the chicken on low or you'll burn through the sauce too fast and your chicken will end up dry if you cook it the full 15 minute on medium.

This was a great recipe and very easy to make. I used honey mustard instead of dijon and cajun seasoning instead of creole seasoning. Even doing so it was delicious! My parents thought it was very flavorful too. I served this with some rice and peas yum! I will definitely make this again.

I can't give enough stars to this fantastic recipe! So juicy and tender--we used plastic knives to cut into it effortlessly. And the flavor! I used only half the recommended amount of Dijon and it balanced perfectly with the lemon which was all it needed. Delicious relatively fast and super easy; I will DEFINITELY make this again if only to see my peckish boyfriend clear his plate like that more often!

This was really easy to make and had so much flavor..I love that you can adjust the ingredients as you'd like to make it to your liking. I added a dash of Soy and a dash of Worcestershire sauce in addition to a little honey to cut out a little of the tartness of the mustard. Also added more lemon and lime juice as I cooked it until I got it to a good tasting for us! Very Yummy! Will be making this again! THANKS! Even the kids liked it!

This had a really nice tangy flavor. I really liked the Creole Seasoning. It's not something I would've thought to add to something like this but it tasted great. I think I would've prefered to just bake whole breasts with the sauce. I felt the sauce evaporated a bit on the stove. But for a quick meal it worked out great.

The flavors in this are fantastic however I didn't find the recipe well put together. I followed the directions exactly as specified and nearly dried up the sauce. I would cook the chicken at least half way through first then add the Dijon mix toward the end. I had to add water to keep mine from drying out completely.

Sorry to ruin a good rating but I just couldn't get this to work. The sauce is very thick and by the time the chicken was done my pan was completely covered in burned mustard. I tried it three times thinking I was doing something wrong. Under the burned outside it actually tasted good but the clean up time defeats the purpose of a quick meal.

My fiancee and I loved this! It was a very strong lemon/lime taste when I made it but spicy too--a very interesting combination of flavors. I eyeballed the lime juice (had some in a squirt bottle no limes) so I could have put too much. I cooked the chicken on low heat for a longer period of time and it made the chicken a little tougher but made the sauce thicker. I'll try it on medium heat for 15 minutes next time.

The whole family really liked the Quick Lemon Dijon Chicken. It paired well with asparagus. I used lime and lemon juice instead of juicing them myself. The lime however was a little overpowering so the next time I cook this meal I'll use a little less. I included chicken broth in the recipe adding a little more flavor and juice. Overall a quick and easy meal that tasted great!

Update: I started with giving this a 4 but now after making it a couple more times I'm upgrading to a 5. This is so easy and the chicken comes out so tender. Past review:I liked this. A couple reviewers said it wasn't that mustardy but it was but I love mustard so it was ok. I put extra lemon in it because I love lemon and I left out the lime. I love how quick it is so I'll be making this over and over.

I've made this for 2 separate friends/family and both said it was delicious and thought I was a gourmet chef. I was afraid to tell them how EASY this recipe really was! I didn't have the "creole style" seasoning so I just looked it up on the internet and found that all the spices were there in my cupboard. Just basic stuff really. It is a very forgiving recipe. If you get the amounts "wrong" it still tastes good.

I was skeptical about serving this to my children but had high hopes for my fiance and I. Everyone LOVED it! We substituted Boeje's Mustard but followed everything else. Next time I will serve it with rice (used egg noodles this time). I can't wait to make this again!

A tasty 0 prep time meal perfect for a weeknight when you don't feel like spending an hour cooking. I served it with green beans salad and buttered bread and was pleased all around. Easy to cleanup...

I rate it a 4 because I did change some things. I used it as a marinade and baked the chicken. So Yummy. I did add a squeeze of honey a grated clove of garlic and a little less mustard.

While the chicken turned out to be quite tasty the look was less than appealing. The mustard ended up clumping up in the pan and burning around the chicken. If I were to make this again I would suggest coating the chicken with the mustard first so it has a nice even layer to it and then baking it.

We really like the recipe but we customized the recipe heavily based on some other reviews. Substituted: - Whole Grain Mustard - Hot sauce instead of creole seasoning Added: - 1/2 onion cut into strips - 2 cloves of garlic diced - 1/2 can of pineapple chunks - Dash of soy sauce - Dash of Worcester sauce Served over whole grain spaghetti

I loved this dish. It was quick and easy not to mention yummy. I did omit the lime juice and used more lemon juice then called for. I also made my own creole seasoning. I had plenty of sauce left over and it didn't burn or dry out. Served it with a salad and brown rice. Wonderful!

I didn't have a lime but used a tbsp of lemon juice. I used lemon pepper and cut the dijon down to about 2/3 of what the recipe called for. I also added some garlic that I sauteed in a little olive oil a splash of soy sauce a splash or worcestershire sauce and a little salt. It was a hit and smelled wonderful.

The recipe as is was pretty unbalanced. I ended up altering it quite a bit and by the time I was finished I had a completely different meal in front of me. The biggest issue I found with the original preparation was that it was too acidic without any heat or sweet elements. I ended up throwing the original sauce and using a combination of half a lemon worth of juice about 2 table spoons of dijon mustard a generous amount (to taste) of the creole seasoning and about a tablespoon of honey (I didn't measure this) with just a splash of balsamic vinegar. I threw the chicken into the sauce and let it sit while I preheated my pan. Then I tossed my chicken into the hot pan and cooked it while I had some quinoa on the other burner. The two finished at roughly the same time since I reduced the heat so I could thicken the sauce. I also added half a small red onion to the finished product which I quickly cooked in olive oil with 3 splashes of marsala cooking sherry salt and pepper. Despite the disaster that was this recipe dinner ended up delicious. Thanks for the inspiration.

I absolutely loved this recipe. I did not have any lime juice but the lemon was enough and I had to improvise my own seasonings but it tasted great. The only thing wrong with this recipe is the amount of time she says to cook it. 15 minutes on medium heat is not enough time unless you like your chicken pink on the inside.

I did like this recipe but the amount of mustard needs to be cut down. It was too strong for us. Hubby didn't care much for it so we probably won't make it again. But I may try it again with a lower amount of mustard.

I cut the Dijon in half and made up the difference with low fat Italian dressing and chicken broth (and added the lemon and lime juices as called for). I thickened it all with a little corn starch. With the adjustments it was quite tasty! Served over rice with steamed asparagus.

The mustard is very overpowering in this dish. I made the marinade with the proportions suggested but ended up adding juice from the whole lemon and the whole lime as well as a tablespoon of honey to take some of the extremely mustardy taste out. If I am to make this recipe again I will certainly cut back on the mustard.

The chicken was good but it was very strong. My family is very picky and they loved it. I thought it should have a little less dijon but I was told that the strong flavor is what made it so good. For my family to eat it and say they would eat it again says a lot for this recipe.

I'll give this 3 stars because it was certainly quick and easy but I didn't like the flavors. The Dijon should definitely be reduced and the "sauce" needs to be thinned out. I'll try it again and add chicken broth as others have suggested and perhaps a little honey to sweeten it.

Awesome recipe! I make it all the time. Great for folks on a diet I tend to play with the amounts of juice and seasonings but I always like the way it turns out. Pour the sauce over white rice and you'll love it. I use chicken tenderloins to save a little cash and you're slicing them up anyway. I'll be making this dish for a long time I'm sure.

I used 4 chicken breasts so doubled.the sauce ingredients using the juice from an entire lime instead of 1/2. I also used 2 teaspoons of cajun spice. The sauce was delicious but was even better when I added 1 cup of sour cream. Sauce alone would be fabulous on just pasta. Great easy meal.

Since it was my first time making this I followed advice of reviewers. I used only half of the Dijon but the next time I will use the full amount. I also covered the bottom of the pan with chicken broth which helped to make more sauce. Served it with rice and sautéed mushrooms and sweet peppers. We really liked it!

I tried it but made it a little different because I did not have lime I used more lemon and I did not have creole seasoning so I used Mrs.Dash Southwest Chipotle And cracked black pepper. By happy accident used honey mustard and wanted it saucy so added some sour cream at end of cook time so it would be creamer on white rice an I have to say having eye balled the ingredients it was Fantastic! For those of you that thought the Dijon was too much try the honey mustard. And if your not liking this! Then your doing it wrong! making this again definitely! With my recipe thou!

As with most recipes and as other cooks do I did my own spin on this one two simply because I don't have all the ingredients on hand and generally I don't run to the store every time I'm cooking and don't have all the ingredient. I only gave it a 3 star because the way I made it it tasted too lemony for my teenage kids (they're the fussy ones) and my wife. I thought it was a little too lemony too so if I make it again I'll cut down on the lemon. I don't have any dijon so I just used a little regular mustard and little powder mustard. I also subbed some chicken seasoning we have in the house as I didn't have any creole seasoning. It was very simple to make which is great for us house-husbands so that definitely earned a couple of stars. I definitely suggest playing around with this recipe as many cooks do until your family pallet likes it. Bon mardi gras everyone! Laisse les bons temps rouler!

Really great weeknight recipe for when you have chicken and don't know what to do with it in a short amount of time. I also didn't have many ingredients in the house at the time so this is an easy recipe to whip up with just a few basics on hand. I didn't have fresh limes or lemon juice so I just used bottled lemon juice. The lemon flavor is pretty strong as some users have mentioned but I liked it that way. I also think if you have real lemons on hand you could add maybe a teaspoon of lemon zest to the mix also for some more lemony flavor if you'd like. I also didn't have Dijon mustard so I used regular deli mustard and then added a tablespoon of mayo as well. Just be sure to whisk well when cooking the sauce to blend the mayo smoothly into the sauce. Delicious!
