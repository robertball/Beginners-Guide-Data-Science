I have been making this recipe for years and everyone loves it, some dont want to try it but then once they do they cant get enough, I add black beans, canned corn  you can also use kidney beans its really endless what you do to this recipe. and I like more tomatos  then it calls for. It is way better if made the night before.

This recipe is great, especially in summertime. I always crumble a few crispy slices of bacon up in mine, and it's even better!

I would have given this recipe 5 stars but i add a few more ingredients. We like more vegetables and crunch in the salad, so i chop up some cauliflower, cucumber, and celery along with the bell pepper and onion. WONDERFUL salad. and great served with pinto beans along side.

Try this variation--also add chopped cucumber, chopped green onion and crumbled bacon that's been fried to a crisp, otherwise it will get soggy after it sits in the mayo, or you can use Miracle Whip or ranch dressing if you prefer.  We are from southern West Virginia and put a scoop of this right smack in the middle of a bowl of fresh cooked pinto beans--yummy!

The first one or two bites is o.k. but after that it's just too much.  It is very rich and thick.  This is for people who could eat a spoonful of straight mayo without blinking.

This is very yummy.  I only added 1/2 the amount of onion and it was still too much.  Also this makes a lot of salad!!!  I would recommend cutting in half unless you have a large group.

Hmmmm, I'm not sure what I think of this salad, so I'm giving it 3.5 stars. It definately has a different type of texture, which I was expecting, but I think the green pepper was too overpowering, and I felt it could've maybe used more things added to it, like maybe black beans, bacon or even shredded cheddar or something. I halved the recipe and eye-balled the mayo until I thought it was the right consistancy. All in all, it tasted good, but I would definately cut down on the green pepper or omit it, and add in the extras. Hubby didn't care for this at all, but I didn't think he would due to his 'texture' issues, lol. Thanks for sharing. :)

Love this recipe, my grandmother made this  before and I liked it but hers had a little too much mayo. I cut the ingredients in half and the mayo and it came out perfect. I will definitely be making this more often.

I had never had cornbread salad until a couple of weeks ago at a new Barbeque restaurant in town. I loved it and knew my husband would to. I needed a recipe, so I hopped on AR and found one. It was wonderful. I did make a few adjustment though. I didn't put as many onions as it called for and also added some roasted red peppers. It was wonderful !!!

One word....AWESOME!!!! I made this for the 4th of July and all of my guest reved about it. I did however add some celery, ranch dressing and shredded cheese. I also think it could have used more tomato but never the less this is a keeper. =)

I'd never heard of cornbread salad before, but needed something to take to a salad luncheon. I prepared this as written plus the corn and black beans. It was the hit of the luncheon. Everyone loved it and went back for seconds!

I made it and it's really good!  I took the advice of other reviewers and added pinto beans, corn, celery, bacon and shredded cheese.  I also cut the mayo part in half (I used lite mayo) and then split that up by adding ranch dressing.  So I only added about 2 1/4 cups total of dressing mixture.  I will definitely make this again!

Something different to offer.  Made kid friendly by omitting onion, added black beans, corn kernels, and bacon bits.  Could easily cut recipe in half and still have plenty.

very good and easy salad.  I didn't have enough mayo, so put one cup sour cream.  I also crumbled up some leftover bacon....YUM!  I halved the recipe as my family are not salad lovers like I am.

5+++++ starss!  I had leftover cornbread I needed to use up, so I decided to give this a try.  This was sooo good...I used white onions instead of red and also added an avocado.  I will be making this often!

You should also try adding kidney beans.
