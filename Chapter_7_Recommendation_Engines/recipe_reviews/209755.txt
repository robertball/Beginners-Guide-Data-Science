This is an excellent and easy recipe. To give it more flavor, use pumpkin pie spice instead of plain cinnamon.  I use 2 tablespoons of pumpkin pie spice and the cake tastes so much better.

I made this recipe in bundlettes -- makes 12 one cup bundtlettes.  (Baked for 27 minutes.)  I didn't add the streusel this time and it stands well on it's own.  I will try the streusel in the future.  So yummy, easy, and pretty!  I would make it again!  (BTW 8 oz. sour cream = 1 cup.)

Cake came out very good! I did make a few modifications; I added ground cloves to cake batter & pumpkin pie spice in lieu of cinnamon because I love a lot of spice. When I added the flour mixture tu the butter mixture, it felt too thick to me, so I added a few splashes of apple cider.

I made this cake and entered it into a "bake-off" contest at work and won First Place!  Followed the recipe exact, thought I had made a mistake due to the thick consistancy of the batter but it rose nicely, presented beautifully and the taste was excellent.  Thanks for the recipe, i now have added confidence to enter my second baking contest!

This was awesome!!!  I added 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce to the mixture to make them even more moist, and melted down a little cream cheese frosting to drizzle on top as opposed to making the glaze.  Everyone said it was delicious, and I will definitely make again...plus, it freezes beautifull! :)  Thank you!

This is a delicious recipe!  I made these in mini-bundts as well and turned out great.  The only alteration I made was the glaze.  I used a different topping from the Pumpkin Cupcake recipe, and it was perfect!

I didn't get to eat this because I made it for someone else, but it was very easy to make, looked great, and smelled fantastic!  I did hear from the recipient that it was delicious  -   they raved about it.

Tastes great! Needs more than 1/2 c of brown sugar for the streusel filling. You can substitute pumpkin pie filling for the all spice in the brown sugar. Be sure to make the glaze very thick, or it will run off the cake.

This cake was delicious! When I saw that the recipe called for 1 cup of butter I just knew I had to substitute applesauce for half. Then I accidentally put a whole cup of applesauce in while it was mixing. Oh well, I thought. It turned out so moist and delicious. I also added finely  chopped walnuts to the streusel and ended up only baking for 50 minutes. I only had tangerines in the house so used the zest and juice for the glaze. Perfection! Thanks for the great recipe. I will be making this often.

It was a little dry, but excellent flavor.  Next time I will try adding the apple cider like the other reviewer suggested.

Could have been a little moister.  Maybe watch the baking time and start checking at 45 minutes.  I mixed some apple cider with the powdered sugar for the glaze.  Cream cheese frosting works also.

This cake is more delicious than any cake has a right to be.....  As with most baked goods, it was tastier on day 2. I screwed up and used 2 Tablespoons of butter for the streusel, which in hindsight was a big plus.  Everything about this cake was moist, delicious and irresistible!

Very good cake! I followed the cake directions exactly but purchased cream cheese frosting and drizzled it on top instead of using the glaze. It met with rave reviews. The only request from the crowd for the next time they wanted two layers of the streusel.

Great cake.  As another reviewer suggested, I substituted 2TBSP of pumpkin pie spice instead of the cinnamon in the cake mixture.  May try the cream cheese frosting next time and walnuts in the streusel!

Don't know what happened...it came out a little on the dry side and I followed the recipe exactly as printed.  The flavor was good but just too dense and dry.

Made by a friend with modifications "I used 1.5c wheat flour and 1.5c unbleached organic. instead of white sugar I used natural unpast honey, instead of sour cream I used french vanilla organic yogurt. and I used more pumpkin then they called for too. (and only 3 eggs, but could have used two) for the glaze I used powedered sugar and apple cider :) SOOOOO YUMMY!!!"

Delicious...says everyone in my house!!  I followed the recipe for the cake and filling exactgly except I baked them as cupcakes (for 24 minutes at 350). Since some reviewers used different topppings I couldn't decide what to do. My 4 year old and I decided to make 3 types, store bought cream cheese icing, the glaze, and plain. All were great! For the glaze, I put it on a plate and turned my cupcakes upside down in the glaze. It worked great. One reviewer said that the glaze tasted like orange Beyer aspirin, which it did by itself but is delicious on the cupcakes. Will definitely use this recipe again and again!! Yummy!

I prepared this recipe as written but chose to make this into 12 one cup mini bundtlettes. I baked them at 350 degrees for 25 minutes. The batter was easy to make and I noticed it was thick but it rose up nicely while baking. I also enjoyed the wonderful pumpkin aroma that filled up my house. The cake is moist and delicious. I can taste the pumpkin flavor in the cake. I made the glaze a little thicker. The orange flavor is lightly sweetened and does not overpower the flavor of pumpkin cake. The mini bundt cakes look great and tastes great. The brown sugar streusel filling is a wonderful addition and makes this cake extra special compared to other pumpkin cake recipes I’ve made. I made these for hubs to take to work so I dusted the rest of the mini bundt cakes with powdered sugar for easier transport. If I were to make this again I would double the streusel next time.

Delicious! The perfect dessert for a fall dinner party.  Didn't alter the batter, except to add more spices; and I followed the advice of other reviewers and made a cream cheese frosting.  The bake time was spot on for me.  Only thing I'll change next time is to double the streusel filling.

A friend made this for our chuch's Thanksgiving Dinner.  I then asked her for the recipe and she sent a link to this recipe.  Absolutely scrumptious. My whole family lapped it right up.  Definitely a keeper.

I made a mini version of this in my 6-cup bundt pan.  My review, however, is only for the cake, as I didn’t use the specified glaze, but another from this site.  I halved the recipe and made this exactly as the recipe instructs.  The taste is very good with a nice amount of spice.  However, when I sliced the cake I noticed that my streusel sort of melted as the cake baked, leaving a hole in the center of the cake.  So next time I would swirl the streusel throughout the batter.  Other than that, a nice little cake.

I am planing on making this cake again, but this time with less sugar. It was also a bit dryer than I thought it would be from the reviews, which makes me thing I need to make the cake again. All of you can't be wrong. Mainly I thought it was a bit too sweet. It is a beautiful looking cake too, loved the orange glaze, but may leave out the Streusel.

This is delicious! I didn't have sour cream, so I guess I need to call my cake Yogurt Pumpkin. I used a whole can of pumpkin & then filled the can half way up with plain yogurt. I mixed the streusel up in the food processor - makes it SOOO easy. You don't get a lot of streusel & while I can taste it, you dont' really see it like in the pic. It makes a big bundt cake. I was afraid my bundt pan wasn't the 12 cup size, but in the end it worked. It did rise a lot & make a big one. Grease it up well & it should come out of the pan. It's seriously tasty!

I tried this recipe based on the number of positive reviews. However, I'm not sure what all the great reviews are about. I found the cake to be a little dry and have zero pumpkin flavor to it. I used fresh pumpkin which had nice flavor...but the cake did not take on a pumpkin flavor at all. I will not make this cake again.

Absolutely delicious...I've made this before with wonderful results.  I had a major craving for this yesterday, but had difficulty finding canned pumpkin.  After going to 3 stores, I could only find pumpkin pie filling.  I substituted the pie filling for the pure pumpkin (and followed the rest of the recipe), and I think the cake came out moister!   This is a great recipe!

I liked the flavor of this cake, but after the 2nd day it was kinda dry above the streusel and still moist at the bottom.  The glaze tasted like orange Bayer aspirin.  Next time I will use a light cream cheese frosting or just milk instead of the orange juice.

This was a huge hit for Thanksgiving! It really wasn't as heavy as I expected, which was great. It did, however, take almost two hours to bake - next time I'm going to experiment with the temperature a bit. The batter seemed a bit overwhelming for my 10-cup bundt pan; perhaps making the bundt and a smaller loaf with the remainder would help the baking time. It didn't burn, though, despite the extra hour in the oven - wonderfully moist!

Fantastic recipe!  I added some additional spices to the cake batter (about 3/4 tsp. each of nutmeg and ginger).  But otherwise, didn't change a thing.  This was SOOOOoooo delicious, and a real hit at Thanksgiving.  Be sure to use all of your streusel and glaze!  Oh, and baking time was about 75 min. for me using a convection oven.  LOVE this!

This is the best cake EVER!  I've made it 3 times now; the first time for a work birthday where someone almost cried it was so good, the second time for my boyfriend to take to work but he wouldn't let it out of the house, and the third time I won first place at a bake-off!  I use pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon in the cake, canned pumpkin pie mix (all they had left at the store), and microwave cream cheese frosting to pour over the cake.  It tastes even better the next day!

I loved this cake but made it mine with more than a few modifications.  Changed out butter with canola 3/4 C  and added entire 15 oz can of pumpkin and most importantly added 1/8 C molasses to liquids and added 1tsp of cloves and 1/2 tsp of ginger and allspice to dry ingredients.  All added pecans to the Streusel filling.  It cooked in 60 minutes and was perfect!!

Very moist and tasty cake. The streusel gives it that yummy something extra that other pumpkin cakes don't have. I used some rum liqueur mixed with the powdered sugar for the glaze and that worked great too!

The cake was fine.  I certainly wasn't overly impressed vs other pumpkin bundt cake recipes.  But truly, I am giving this one star because the picture is so incredibly misleading.  The filling calls for 1/2 c of brown sugar.  That picture is NOT 1/2 cup of filling. The streusel was not nearly as impactful considering the extra work.

This cake is awesome.  I made it as is, no changes, and it came out moist and delicious.  It earned raves from my coworkers, and I had all I could do not to go back for a second piece myself.  This one's a keeper.

Wonderful recipe!  I followed the directions to the letter and it came out wonderfully.  Lots and lots of compliments.  My icing didnt come out as thick and white as the picture, but, maybe I should just make more icing next time...and there will be a next time!  Thanks for sharing the recipe.  Oh, and it was done probably about 5 minutes before the cooking time.  Probably due to my oven.

Wow -- this was great!  I did add just a little extra pumpkin (couple of tablespoons) in response to other reviews, but I suspect that I didn't need to.  I started checking for doneness at 45 minutes, and wound up baking for one hour.  We like strong flavors, so I used orange juice concentrate instead of orange juice for the glaze.  We will surely make this again!
