Quite nice, i made a few adaptions though.

I used 1/2 the amount of olive oil, as me and my family are on a low calorie diet at the moment.

I used halved shallots instead of pearl onions.

I added 1/2tsp of sugar, in order to help the vegetables to retain a lovely colour.

I reccomend putting it in the oven for 50 minutes, instead of the full 1 hour. And remember to take the tray out of the oven halfway through cooking, and stir around a bit, to avoid burning.

The beets were good, and the pearl onions were tasty, but the turnips were really strong. Not many big fans of this.

This is delicious.  Only added 1/2 tsp turmeric (for health) and did not use salt.  Used green onions.  I would cut beets smaller than turnips next time.  Wonderful with baked fish.

Easy to make and delicious.  I used white onions and sliced thin.  Baked for 50 minutes.  It's become a household favorite.

I didn't have any turnips so I used carrots, plus some fresh garlic & ginger. I reduced the oil, so I added some V8 juice and used a covered dish. It turned out great and was even better the next day! :) I'll try the tumeric next time.

The recipe is okay.  I tried to give it a little more dimension by adding both golden and red beets, as well as some blue fingerling potatoes.  But even with all that, I didn't get fantastic results.  My partner liked the dish, but I would've been happier with a beet salad.

Just ok.  A bit greasy for me.  The best thing about this recipe is that it's really easy.  If I were to make it again I'd use fresh rosemary instead of dried and half the amount of oil.

i made this recipe for one of my Canadian Allstar Challenges.  First thing....my husband absolutely, hands down, HATES BEETS! i on the other hand love them, so i told him he could just pick them out, LOL! Well, he didn't pick them out. he had a second helping, and said they were "outstanding" :)  i didn't have pearl onions, so i added some radishes. i had a potato that i wanted to use up, so i added that as well. the colour of this dish before and after being roasted is just beautiful. i added  pat of butter when they came out of the oven. i will be making this again, and will make sure i have pearl onions on hand, as i think they would are an integral part of this dish. This recipe is sooooo delicious and looks lovely on the plate. this one is definitely a keeper. Thank you Gemini00, for sharing a superb recipe.

I had something like this recently, but it had sweet potatoes instead of turnips and used garlic aioli instead of the oil and rosemary.

I added chopped fresh ginger and a sweet potato. I thinly sliced half of a white onion because I didn't have shallots. It was amazing!!!
