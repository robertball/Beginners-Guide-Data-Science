We use a similar recipe (minus the cinnamon) to slow bake pork chops.

Very, very good. I made this sauce as the recipe called except for the cinnamon. I didnt have a cinnamon stick on hand so I added about 1tsp of ground cinnamon. I cut up chicken breast and simmered it in this and it came out delicious.

I thought when I read this that the sugar amount would be too much for us...so I decided to start with 1/4 cup, because the cranberry sauce and the orange juice were already so sweet. That made it just right for my family. I also cut the orange juice to half. It's a good and simple glaze, but if I make again- I will add in a few more spices to kick it up a notch. You may want more sugar seems others liked it sweeter.

I made this and put it on a pork tenderloin that I grilled. It was very simple and delicious with plenty left over for dipping. My father in law that never says he likes anything, gives a standard answer of "its palettable" loved this so much I had to send the recipe to my mother in law first thing the next morning. This will be a standard in our house as it pairs well with different meats very well.

This was really easy, and tasted delish!  I applied it to the turkey with about an hour left to cook, again at half an hour left, and at the end just  before I carved it.  There was tonnes left over, so I think you could easily half the recipe.  I'll use it again.
