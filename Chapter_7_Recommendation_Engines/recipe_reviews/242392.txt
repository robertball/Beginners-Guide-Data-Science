This filling has the perfect tartness and the bright red-pink color contrasts beautifully in white cake. I used a 12-oz package of frozen raspberries thereby halving the remaining ingredients. It made enough to fill a 3-layer 9" round "White Almond Wedding Cake" from this site. Cream cheese frosting atop made this a lovely Valentines Day treat for my coworkers who raved.  I'm anxious to try this in chocolate cake with mocha frosting. Excellent recipe!

I followed Quiltloverly's advice and used a 12-oz. pkg. of frozen raspberries and reduced the other ingredients by 1/2. I recommend that you take your time to press the fruit through the strainer when straining out the seeds.  I used a spatula and pressed on the mixture and dragged the spatula.  It's very thick, so you'll need to scrape the fruit off the underside of the strainer (I used a regular soup spoon).  It was a bit time consuming (took a few extra minutes), but I think the result was excellent.   Very easy recipe and it made enough to fill the inside of my 9-inch chocolate cake layers.  The flavor combination was incredible and everyone raved about how delicious it was.  Thank you so much!

Made this Raspberry Filling for the Cream Cake recipe on this site. I will admit, I was lazy and did not strain out the pips. Additionally, I reduced the amount of sugar in this to a 1/4 cup since the cake and frosting were going to more than make up for the missing sugar. I used frozen raspberries so I also reduced the water to 1/3 cup.  While changes were made, the spirit of the recipe was maintained. This is sublime. Not only did I use this in a cake, I have used it on PB&J sandwiches, and filled thumbprint cookies with the last bit of it.  Thank you for this recipe Alisa Provost, I will make this many times over!

So I've never done a fruit filling before but i tried it today for something different. I used frozen did 48 oz because i wanted leftovers and doubled cornstarch to be on par w the reader who did the 12 oz frozen and 1/2 recipe etc.....it did not firm up enough i feel. I made it work but next time more cornstarch.

So I used strawberries and added a very liberal amount of fresh lemon peel gratings to give the flavor a little more complexity. Flavor-wise it was 5 stars. But I made it for cake filling about 2 days before it went in the cake (stored in refrigerator).  On the stovetop the filling seemed thick enough.  When it was time to go on cake it was clearly far too runny and watery. Perhaps I didn't let it reduce enough?  At least it is delicious and goes really well on top of vanilla ice cream, waffles etc.

This was delicious! I used this filling with a chocolate cake and it was perfect! It wasn't too sweet and it thickened nicely. Everyone raved about my cake and I will definitely use this recipe again.

I used this raspberry filling in a black magic cake, and wow! It not only has great texture, but it also tastes absolutely amazing! The only problem that I encountered was that you should let the filling simmer for a little longer if you want it to be thick and not runny. Overall, this recipe was great, and the cake would not have been as good without it!

I made this with hopes of using it as a cake filling. The recipe is far too runny. It is more of a thick syrup consistency. I threw it back into the pot and added a second cornstarch slurry in attempts to salvage it.

The flavor is great and a little on  the sweet side, however the cornstarch to liquid ratio is way off.  The  raspberries also release liquid and with the cup of  water you need at least 4 T of cornstarch to make  a thick filling,  otherwise you end up with a gravy consistency which will seep into your cake.  The  ration  of cornstarch to water to make a gravy is 2 T cornstarch  to 2 cups liquid....so.....you can see that more constarch  is  needed here.  Otherwise...it's fine as a sauce.

I gave it 2 stars because the flavor is ok.  But this is not a filling, it's a sauce and a runny one.

The flavour is spot on. If you thicken it slightly more, as others mentioned, it becomes quite versatile. I used it as the base layer for a lemon meringue pie. If your lemon filling is sufficiently tart, you can greatly reduce the lemon juice in the primary recipe.  Unchanged, this is a great sauce for cheesecake.

I was afraid because I added in a little bit of cornstarch too early. It ended up turning out so tart and so tasty! Me and my family all loved it!

I have made this filling a few times and the only change I made was to add more cornstarch to the slurry.   The filling has a fantastic flavor and consistency.

I used a 12 oz bag of frozen raspberries therefore decreasing the other ingredients to match. Otherwise followed directions exactly. Still had enough to fill a 4 layer cake. Great flavor, slightly tart, perfect consistency to put between cake layers. I would even love this as just a jam on toast- excellent!

Tangy deliciousness!  Loved this on a lemon yogurt sponge cake.  I was afraid it would have a cooked flavor, but it was like fresh crushed raspberries.  Thank you for sharing!
