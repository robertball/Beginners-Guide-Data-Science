These were excellent! I made the cucumber topping from this recipe and also another one from the site and the other actually had more flavor. Try adding some cilantro and jalapeno to it to kick up the flavor some. The only thing I would change next time is the chicken. Although the thighs add more flavor, trying to cut them off of the bone was a hassle and the skin falls off anyway. Next time I will either use boneless skinless thighs or even breast. Overall great recipe though with unique flavors. Two thumbs up!
