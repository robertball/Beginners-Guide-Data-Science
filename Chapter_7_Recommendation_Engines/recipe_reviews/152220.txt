This dish is delicious! A note for first-time makers: when making the cornstarch & water mixture to thicken the sauce, don't add the cornstarch to HOT water or you will end up with a dish full of glue. Add it to cold water and then stir in to thicken the sauce. This may be common knowledge for some but it wasn't for me!

Just to say that in Chineese cooking there are two types of soy sauce "light and dark". Both are used to add salt to a dish, but the dark soy also adds colour. There is no need to add extra salt to a chineese dish if you use soy sauce. You are just doubling your salt intake. You can also get low sodium soy sauce to reduce your salt intake even more.

This recipe turned out waaaaaaaaaaay too salty.  I had to use Black Bean with Garlic sauce b/c our store did not carry regular Black Bean sauce.  Maybe this was the problem - but 6 tablespoons of that stuff was ALOT.  I didn't look at the sodium content before hand and I regretted it - This was almost too salty to be edible.

I have had this dish in many restaurants, and this recipe ranks high on the list!  It was very yummy!!  I ran into a problem when adding the cornstarch mixture at the end.  I added the whole thing at once and my sauce turned into a blobby mush.  I just added some water to thin it back out, and it tasted really good.  So next time I make it I don’t think I will add the cornstarch or just a little, because the sauce looked perfect before I added it.  I will definitely be making this again, and passing on the recipe!

After reading the reviews. I left out the salt and subbed the bouillon cube for broth. My only other change is that I added shrooms but only because we love them. Very tasty but too salty as written so I am glad I read the reviews and made my changes beforehand.

Okay, the secret to toning down the saltiness of this dish is to omit the salt, chicken bouillon, and the soy sauce.  Then  increase the water to 1 cup.  Use 1 1/2 Tablespoons (4 1/2 teaspoons) cornstarch dissolved in 1/4 cup additional water to thicken.  Also, stir in 1 teaspoon sugar.  Without so much salt, this is delicious.

I followed the recipe exactly , Black bean sauce is salty and then adding salt and salty chicken bouillon made it inedible.  I also found the sauce slimy.  Luckily I made fried rice and had spring rolls.

This tastes just like the one I had in England! So YUMMY! I didn't add the salt. I added water chestnuts, pea pods, and zucchini. I added most of the corn starch mix, but I did it a little at a time. I will be making this again VERY soon!

Fabulous recipe.  Served it at an ethnic dinner club and received several thumbs up.  Few small adjustments; substituted 1-2 Tbsp HOT black bean sauce for some regular for more spice, used chicken broth vs. bouillon.  I found the bean sauce salty so cut out the salt and used light (vs. dark) soy sauce.  Not sure exactly where to find or what to do for 'toasted' seasame oil so used regular seasame oil heated in toaster oven.  I'm always nervous to make a recipe for the 1st time for a big groug but it worked great & pretty easy to prepare.

It makes way too much sauce. I recommend halving the amount of black bean sauce and leaving out the extra salt. I like to add mushrooms and snow peas to mine.

Very simple to make & very tasty.  I marinated the chicken in the black bean sauce & garlic before stirfrying the chicken in the sesame oil.  The black bean sauce is pretty salty...I didn't need to add any additional salt, or the soy sauce.  I did add some pre-sauted mushrooms & zucchini, as well as some black bean tofu, which really worked in this dish.  Didn't need to do the cornstarch...the sauce was thick enough.  Will definitely make again!

This recipe was excellent! Very easy to make and tasted great that night and for left overs the next day. I left out the cilantro (as I hate it) and only used 1 green pepper.

I'm glad that I did not add any salt to this- this is very salty- in the black bean sauce there is a whopping 1120mg of sodium so you can skip the salt and the soya sauce in my opinion. If you don't like salty dishes you won't like this. Also I only used 3 TBSP of the Black Bean sauce and it was just fine- served on a bed of Basmati rice and I used 2 very big chicken breasts and it was good enough. From start to finish it took an hour- its the prep. that took most of the time. Also I only used 1 tbsp of corn starch mixed in with a 1/2 c of hot water- and it concistancy turned out perfect. I'm not sure if I'll make this again- I have alot of black bean sauce left that will most likely sit in the fridge for a long time. :-(

Made as written, aside from adding a bit of heat (Sriracha)... super easy to make and tasted awesome !  The chicken was very tender and there was plenty of sauce for the dish.  This is a keeper :)

Fantastic!!!!  I didn't add the salt, used chicken soup base instead of the bouillon, and used green and orange peppers.  I used low-sodium soy sauce, instead of regular, to cut the saltiness.  My husband doesn't like cilantro, so I cut the amount in half....still tasted great!  I served it with brown rice.  I will make this again.... so good!

This had a great flavor. I think the cooking time on the chicken is way to long though. You end up with tough chicken. Either take the chicken out of the pot at some point or take away the 6 minute cooking down of the boulion. Cornstarch not absolutly necessary as the black bean sauce is pretty thick itself. Amount of ingrediants looked a bit long but it wss pretty easy once you get cooking and it really didn't take all that long like someone else had mentioned. Skip the salt too.

I cooked a full authentic Chinese dinner for about 10 people, and doubled this recipe. I had leftovers for the next week (I also served 4 other main dishes). It was fantastic, delicious, easy, and a huge hit!

This really shocks me that so many people rated it so highly. 

I am completely disappointed. First off, following other commenter's advice, I cut down to add no salt to this, and reduced the 6 tablespoons to 3, and cut on the soy sauce. It was still too salty. I'm suspecting that might have been a typo, and in fact it should be 6 teaspoons, or 2 table spoons (again, with no salt.)

This was very good.  Did not have fresh cilantro but dried worked fine.  The sesame oil was fragrant and delicious- it really adds to the taste of the dish!  I was almost out of soy sauce, so I also added a tablespoon of hoison sauce toward the end of cooking.  If you happen to have some on hand I recommend trying a bit- it added the perfect dash of sweet to make a great dish with a complex variety of flavors!

LOVED THIS!!!  I just used a bag of stir fry mixed veggies because I wanted more variety.  Turned out perfect!  I also omitted the cilantro, as I'm not a big fan.  This is definitely going into my rotation!

Delicious recipe. Very "chinese authentic." Don't add salt while cooking.Soy sauce, black bean sauce and chicken broth are enough salt for me.

This was great.  Skipped the salt, used low sodium soy sauce and a little chicken broth rather than the bouillon and it was not too salty at all.  Added a splash of Sriacha and tons of different veggies.  Thanks for sharing!

I've wanted to use black bean sauce for quite some time now, so I decided to give it a try starting with this dish. Holy salt! I did read the reviews and didn't add any salt, and I used chicken broth instead of bullion and it was still WAY TO SALTY! In light, I was able to add about 3/4 cup of water and it ended up being right where it should be. Edible, but scary at first.

This was totally awsome! I served this with the Vegetable Lo Mein, fried rice, and the schezwan shrimp recipes from this site.  We had a great dinner party. I also has some extra black bean sauce, so I got my butcher to cut me some chinese spare ribs (shortribs cut lengthwise and about 1/4 inch thick) and marinated them in the black bean sauce and BBQ'd them....Yummy!

I like it.  My son would not eat it.  The smell was very strong.  I guess from the black bean sauce since I had not used it before.

First time tasting black bean sauce, and found out I'm a big fan. We're big pepper fans in this house, and I could eat chicken for every meal of the day, so I'd say I was bound to love this recipe. The only thing that keeps me from giving this 5 stars, is I think I'll use either light soy sauce or a mixture of light and regular, it was just a tad too salty for me.

Good recipe!  It looks a little intimidating because of all the list of ingredients, but when it comes down to it, it's not difficult at all.  I used black pepper sauce (that's what I had at the time) and it ended up being good.  It's pretty much the same consistency and similar in taste, I think.  I didn't add any salt and I used about half of the soy sauce that the recipe called for.  Otherwise it would have been too salty.  There's enough flavor in the sauce itself.  I also used chicken stock in place of the chicken buillon and added water chestnuts.  Tasty and not very hard to do.

I made this exactly as stated and did not like it at all. It was the black bean sauce that I did not care for. My husband ate it and said it was okay but this is something I will not make again.

I was looking for a recipe for Jalapeno Chicken that we order at a local Chinese restaurant & this comes very close. I substituted 4 sliced jalapeno peppers for one of the green peppers & it was great. Thanks for the recipe - if you like spicy food try it with the jalapenos!

The black bean sauce makes it work.  I used the jarred black beans to save some time.  I omitted the water/bouillon/cornstarch and the soy sauce because black bean sauce is so salty on its own.  Add some chili paste for a little kick.  Next time I may add a small dash of lime juice.

I found this to be far too salty. Perhaps it is because my black bean sauce was too salty to begin with. But I would advise to not add the extra salt or even use the soya sauce if your sauce was like mine. I also only added as much cornstarch as I felt I needed to. I put in a little at a time and didn't end up using 4 tsps. Any time cornstarch is used, I feel the need to reiterate what another reviewer wrote for novice cooks: it is an absolute MUST that you melt the cornstarch in cold water before adding it slowly to the rest of the pot.

This was a stable in my house growing up.  My dad use to marinate the raw chicken in mixture of cornstarch and soy sauce which made the chicken very tender, eliminating the corn starch in the recipe.

I tweaked this recipe a bit. i added in half of a small head of cabbage, 4 stalks of celery, the greener parts of a leek, mushrooms and crushed red pepper (to taste), and left out the extra soy sauce, salt, and cornstarch slurry. I also used 5 heaping tablespoons of Lee Kum Kee Black bean garlic sauce. It turned out really good. almost as good as my favorite local chinese food restaurant.

I'm Extremely excited,  This is definitely going into the the recipe Box.  This easy to make Dinner meal took less than 30 minutes to prepare and make.  The recipe was very easy to follow and the ingredients were not hard to find.  After taking the advice of several reviewers,  this turned out to be a great dining experience.  my advise is to go easy on all the salt additives like Soy sauce, chicken bullion,  Note; I only used 3 Tbsp. of the Black bean sauce, not the recommended 6 Tbsp. also I used only half of the amount of cornstarch to help thicken the sauce.  I added 1 can of mushrooms and 1 can of waterchestnuts.  I will be making this recipe again very soon.  Thank you
Sam

As good or even better then the local restaurant. Used boneless/skinless thighs (marinate for 10 mins with 1 tbps sake, pinch of white pepper and kosher salt). Couldn't find plain black bean sauce so we used AMOY Black Bean & Garlic Sauce and reduced to 1 minced clove of garlic. Only used 2 tbps of Sauce, omitted extra salt and the soy sauce. Used half cup of regular chicken stock in place of bouillon.  Also threw in a bunch of enoki mushrooms. For the cornstarch slurry at the end, mixed it first into a bit of cold chicken stock, before stirring in with green onions. Great over steamed rice or rice noodles!

Most people has same comment, the chicken came out bit salty.  I would not add any additional salt apart from salt content in black bean sauce.

Apart from salt taste dish is delicious!

This was really good but I did what a lot of the others did with regard to the saltiness.  I only used 3 tbsp of the black bean sauce, no salt, no soy sauce, and just a bit of the broth mixed with a lot of water.  I also doubled the amount of the chicken.  My family and I loved it.  I will definitely make it again.

I will rate only 3 stars because as is, it's too salty, almost inedible.  I LOVED what I did though, but here are the changes I made:
- 4 TBS Black Bean sauce (insted of 6!!)
- No additional salt
- No Chicken bouillon, just unsalted chicken stock
- After adding the veggies, just cook for 5 more min (8 is way too much)
- 3 Tsp Cornstarch (insted of 4)

I just remade this recipe and it came out better. I just eyeballed how much of each item to add based on what I thought might taste good. I skipped the salt & pepper, used less black bean sauce & soy sauce. I didn't use a lid, so the sauce thickened a little, but since I already made the cornstarch mixture I added some of it, anyway. I was generous w/cilantro and let it cook down. What I liked about this recipe is that it was easy and pretty quick. I'll give it 4 stars now.
I made it again and I really don't think the soy sauce is needed. This time I added chopped tomato and it was good.

Excellent, very yummy! I used trimmed, deboned and skinned chicken thighs instead though (more flavorful) and since the black bean sauce is already quite salty, I omitted the salt and cut down on the soy sauce to about 1 tsp. Forgot to get cilantro so I omitted that as well. Also added a little Chinese cooking wine.

I liked this recipe but it took awhile to make. I cooked the chicken first and then added it to the recipe. I didn't like the idea of using raw chicken in a black bean sauce. I also added waterchestnuts and added just a little cornstarch to thicken it up. I used a low-sodium chicken boullion and low-socium soy.  I thought it was pretty good, but my husband said it needed more salt. go figure.
