Marinade pork chops in 4 parts apple juice to 1 part soy sauce for at least half an hour before browning - will avoid blandness.

We just didn't like this. Its that simple. I'm not sure if its the recipe or just our preference.  I thought we would like it because its similar to "Caramel Apple Pork Chops" also found on this site - which we like alot. I thought this recipe would bring a new twist to apples and chops. Unfortunately, we didn't like it at all. Maybe it was the apple juice, or the weird texture the apples got or a combination of issues. We choked it down but, sorry - I won't make again.

The pork chops were bland and the stuffing was just as bland with an apple flavor to it.  Since trying this, I am wary of any recipe submitted by a brand or company.

The pork chops had no flavor.  I used Granny Smith apples (as suggested by the recipe) and the dish turned out awful because the apples were too sour.  I would not make this dish again.

It was okay.  If I make it again, I'll spice up the porkchops first.  They were kind of bland.

This was not bad for a one skillet meal.  My 21 month old daughter and I liked it.  I made a few changes.  I seasoned the chops well with seasoned salt and pepper before browning.  I also used 3/4 cup apple juice and 3/4 cup chicken broth.  I thought it had a nice apple taste that was not over powering.  I used red delicious apples since that was what I had.  

This recipe serves its purpose...I had dinner on the table in less than 30 minutes and I didn't have to go to the store.  For that reason alone I will keep it in mind.

Changes I made:  
-Extra thick pork chops, marinated in concentrated Apple juice and 1/4 cup soy sauce. Overnight.
-Saut√© apples with pork chops. 
- In place of 1 1/2cup-apple juice I added 1/2 cup of concentrated apple juice and Soy Marinate and 1 cup of water.
-Also I did substitute with Best Yet brands Stuffing.

I think this would be a winner with kids.

Don't cut the apples in too small of pieces or they will be too mushy. Also..we left the skins on and they were a little tough. Son wasn't too thrilled with it but hubby liked it and he's just as picky. He even made it a second time himself so it's pretty easy to make!

This was a really great recipe to work from.  I followed the advice of another reviewer and used half apple juice and half chicken broth.  I also seasoned the pork chops with seasoned salt and black pepper before cooking them.  I only used about one a half apples because I thought it looked like a lot, plus I couldn't stop eating the apples while I was cutting them!  I am a single mom, and I need fast, easy recipes.  This one is gdefinitely going in my archives.

I followed the recipe exactly but both my husband and I found the pork chops too bland.  I think it would be pretty good if the pork chops were marinated or seasoned before browning them.  My husband did enjoy the apples with the stuffing.

I liked the stuffing, but the pork chops were certainly nothing to write home about.  My husband wasn't thrilled with this dinner so I won't make it again.

This was a horrible recipe.  The pork chops were incredibly dry (despite merely searing the pork to avoid overcooking), the stuffing spongy and the apple juice overly sweet.  This was an embarrassment to serve, especially when pork chops are normally my "specialty."  I had doubts when I read the recipe and the results confirmed them.

If I made this again, I'd sear the chops, add the apples, liquid and flavoring (while making the liquid half wine and half apple juice), bring it to a boil, then let it simmer for 20 minutes or so.  THEN, once the chops were cooked, I'd remove them, and cook the stuffing mix in the liquid.

I wasn't crazy about this recipe (other than the fact that it was quick and easy), and my Husband just plain didn't like it.  The pork chops really needed seasoning, which I didn't add thinking the stuffing mix would make it salty enough, but somehow the apple flavor even made the stuffing rather bland, other than having a rather overwhelming taste of apples.  If it's up to my Husband, I know I won't be making this recipe again.

I really enjoy this recipe. My husband is a fan also, well, sort of.  He says that it is a bit too sweet for him and he is not a fan of all the apples but the stuffing he likes as well as the chop.  I enjoy it and my dinner guests enjoyed it as well.

I really liked it, and my kids said the stuffing tasted like apple crisp.  But my husband just plain doesn't like fruity meat.

This is a good, easy recipe, but calls for way too much liquid. I would reduce the amount of apple juice to 3/4 c. or 1 c. The stuffing was way too mushy with 1-1/2c. of juice. The pork chops were also a bit bland. Next time I will try sprinkling them with thyme or rosemary before I fry them.

I enjoyed the stuffing with the apples (Granny Smith) but I thought the pork chops could use more flavor.  Also, the stuffing I bought didn't have a separate seasoning packet so I had to improvise and just add it all at the point I added the stuffing itself.  I'll probably make this again, just season up the chops a little more!

I almost liked it, but my boyfriend didn't. He said the apples made the stuffing too tart. If you like Stove Top you'll like it I think.

My husband and I really loved this dish. The only thing is there was a little too much liquid, as the stuffing was on the mushy side. I did spice up the dish a little by putting a dry Jerk rub mixed with olive oil and applesauce on the pork before searing. I then sprinkled a slight amount of the Jerk rub in the stugging. The clove taste of the Jerk rub went very well with the apples.

My husband loved this dish! I thought the stuffing was going to be mushy but I let it sit on warm an extra 5 minutes and it turned out great. Thanks for the easy dinner idea!

A lot of people think this is too sweet, but you really have to use tart apples and unsweetened apple juice.  It's healthier that way too.  This is one of my husband's & my favorite recipes when we want something warm & comforting without too much work.

Added a little wine to the juice, used cornbread flavored Stove Top, partially peeled the apple, and seasoned the meat with brown sugar, seasoning salt, and a pinch of chili powder and all the taste cooked off. Need to find a way to make the pork have more taste! The stuffing mixture was excellent.

Oh my goodness! Those pork chops were sooo good and tender.  I think it came out that way because #1 I didn't use the thick chops and #2 I seasoned the chops before putting them in the skillet (I always do that whether or not the recipe calls for it)!
