This was SO good! I eyeballed the measurements, and it was super quick and easy to make. The only change I made was adding a sprinkle of sea salt. This recipe will be going into regular rotation for sure!

I believe we have a new favorite way to fix asparagus! This came out perfect. Tender crisp and oh so tasty! This is definitely my new go-to recipe & I will use it often. Thank you.

I wrap asparagus in wax paper and micro 3-4 min. Then put under broiler 3-4 min. I add truffle powder to toooings. Absolutely the easiest and best asparagus I’ve had!  Thanks!

Perfect as a veggie side.  I chose to add some very thinly sliced filet mignon I had left over and some sliced grape tomatoes on top before placing in the broiler. Made a great one pan main course. Garnish with extra Parma cheese.  Thinly sliced cooked chicken would work well;  as would any fish or seafood.

I made this with every intention of only eating half, but I ate the whole thing! I even halved the butter AND the Parmesan, still delicious! I’m definitely making this again.

This was delicious! I made it just as the recipe was written.  Even my kids ate it.  The hint of lemon was the perfect "surprise".
