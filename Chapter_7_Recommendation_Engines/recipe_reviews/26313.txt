This is how my Grandma makes her pies. A couple of notes for the readers having trouble: remember that anything thickened with cornstarch MUST come to a boil to get the full thickening power. It really just will not work otherwise. Look for your pudding to have big bubbles forming and then it's good and cooked fully. Also, for 4 egg whites, I use 1 cup of sugar. This was a very tasty recipe and no preservatives or additives like with packaged puddings!

absolutely THE BEST BANANA CREAM PIE EVER!!! I decided to use splenda instead of sugar...1  cup.  I stirred it while cooking with my wire whisk...cooking until very thick.  I also used 2 bananas, one layer over the bottom of the pie, then half the custard filling, one more banana and then the rest of the filling.  The meringue, I added a pinch of baking powder along with the cream of tartar, it kept it from shrinking away from the edge (something I"ve always had problems with). I used the regular sugar for the meringue.  I will most definitely make this pie again, thank you for a wonderful recipe!!! I have also used just coolwhip on the top of this pie after cooled or when serving. Absolutely delicious!

Straightforward recipe.  Hints for the novice.  Stir the cooking custard until very thick so butter doesn't thin.  Then cool before filling pie crust.  Also, makes a very full 9" pie.  Consider letting your child make a baby pie with the excess in a tart pan.

I made this last night, it tastes great. But the center was runny, it didn't set up at all. Any ideas from anyone as to why this would happen? Do I need to add more cornstarch then the 1/4 cup called for?

Delicious!  I cooked the filling until it was very thick and then let it cool off completely before I put it in the pie shell.  It turned out beautifully.

I tried to make Banana cream pie one other time and it flopped.  I tried this one and it was great!!  It was so easy.  One tip is to use cold eggwhites for your meringue and to chill your bowl and beaters before whipping!!  It is so delicious!!!

This pie is wonderful.  I loved the idea of NOT using a package of instant pudding.  The trick to not having it turn out soupy is cooking it until it reaches the desired thickness.  I used two bananas and added an extra dash of vanilla.  Superb - everyone loved it.

I liked the idea of this pie...made from scratch, but I had the same problem as other reviewers.  I cooled the custard and it was thick and wonderful, but after cooking the meringue it was soup-like and never set again.  It tasted OK and the meringue was great.  Next time I might use the same custard recipe, but not bake it and use whipped cream on top instead of meringue.

I read the comments before I started, and I was sure to make the filling very thick and let it cool before filling the crust.  The pie still turned out like soup.  The meringue topping turned out well though.  Not sure what the problem was...

mmmmmmm....finally a real banana cream pie, not an artificial one made from instant pudding. I've been looking for a home made recipe because my husband loves banana cream pie, just not the kind out of a box. I didn't have a problem with it setting up at all, of course i did make a few changes. I've never had meringue on a banana cream pie so i didn't put it on, and topped with whip cream after it cooled. i also used a graham cracker crust (my hubby's favorite), and doubled the amount of banana (put one on bottom and one in the middle). It was AMAZING! the filling is rich and creamy and delish! It cooked up nice and thick for me. People must be having a problem with it being runny from cooking it with the meringue. This is the best cream pie i've ever made!

Great tasting custard - but had the same outcome as others.  Cooked exactly like instructed here.  All was fine until I cooked the meringue and what was beautiful custard before, turned to soup after.  Will make pudding again, but won't cook a meringue onto it!

This is awesome!  I used a Graham cracker crust and extra banana, but otherwise followed the recipe.      For those that don't want raw eggs (meringue doesn't cook to 140 degrees with this method), just cook 4 whites with 1 cup of sugar over a double broiler until it's 140 and immediately whip as usual.  This will stabilize the meringue also, so it doesn't weep.  It's a tad sweeter than typical meringue, but awesome.    Thanks for a great recipe!

The pie had very good flavor. I cooked the filling up the night before and let it sit til the next morning in the fridge. When I checked it the next day the filling did not seem to have set up very well so I decided to heat it up again and added an extra T. of cornstarch, after it came to a boil I let it sit a few minutes in the pan while I sliced banana onto the bottom of the crust, I added half the filling and then sliced another banana and then the rest of the filling. I had a bit of filling left that I just put in the fridge to have as pudding.  I opted to use the whipped topping rather than merengue, there was no way I was going to chance the filling failing after I'd worked so hard on it!  The pie turned out very tasty and both my husband and I have enjoyed it. I can see where it would also be good as a coconut cream pie. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is due to the trouble in getting it the right consistency.

I have been eyeing this recipe, but reading all the comments about problems discouraged me a little. Then I did some reading about puddings and meringues and techniques for combining, and I attempted this pie. It turned out amazing! The tips I found and followed were:
1.The pudding shouldn't just get to the boil, it should reach rolling boil, meaning you can't stir it away. That will ensure it stays nice and thick.
2.Add more cream of tartar (or white wine vinegar) - 1 tsp; and equal amount of corn starch to the egg whites, not immediately, but after you have already mixed them to the point where they foam. This makes meringue even more stable.
3.The meringue should be added on top of the very hot pudding - don't let it chill. This starts cooking the meringue from the bottom and prevents weeping.
4.Spread the meringue so it touches the edge of the pie crust completely, to make sure no air goes in and separates the meringue from the pudding.
5. Before assembling the pie, I soaked the banana slices in some lemon juice. This added a mild, but very nice zing to the flavour.
Lovely pie, will make again!

Calculated to 3/4 recipe, and it filled my deep dish pie crust.  DELISH, but as I suspected, the pudding is too soft and runs out of pie even after a night in the fridge. Presentation not good, but great flavor.

The pie was too sweet for my taste but hubby said he loved it.  
I think this would be very cute if served in individual single serve pie crusts.

To get the most of the the pie presentation you need to cool completely before serving.

This pie tasted great and everyone liked it.  I think next time I would add more bananas to make it more banana-y.  One word of advice: make sure to take the time  to cook the pudding until it's VERY thick.  A couple of times I almost took it off the heat before it was done, not realizing how long it would take or how thick it should be.

After being married for 17 years I finally found out my husband adores merinque pies, (banana and lemon) and I have never made them. The first thing I did was long on to allrecipes to find some good recipes. I made this and it turned out great! It had a fantastic flavor. Next time I may add more bananas but other than that I wouldn't change a thing! Thanks for sharing!

This was delicious! It was my first meringue pie and I didnt have enough sugar so I substituted with Splenda and it still came out perfect! I also used the microwave to make the filling instead of the stove top and it worked perfectly!

I needed a pie for a birthday at work. I made individual servings and used oatmeal cookies the "crust". Super easy, I folded chopped Nanas into the pudding and used whipped cream to which I added some banana extract to. Just Yummy!Thanks Loretta!

I cooked the custard for a long time and  threw in a little extra cornstarch based on the warnings that the pie gets watery from other reviewers. I also allowed it to cool overnight. After making this pie, I learned from a friend that meringue pies break down after a day and get watery - it's just how meringue pies are.  This isn't a make ahead recipe - I'd recommend constructing the pie and making the meringue and baking just before serving. This pie was a gift (given immediately after baking) and my friend really enjoyed it.

I like baking lemon meringue pies and the technique to making this pie sounded similar.  So I tried it and mine was soupy too.  If the filling needs to cool then please add that step to the recipe.  I won't make this one again, unless the directions are more specific to eliminate the soupy outcome.

The pudding looked and tasted great until I poured it in the pie shell, added the meringue and cooked it.  Then it turned into soup!

My husband swears this is just like the pie his Grannie used to make! I tweaked it just a bit on his description of hers. I food processed one banana and added it to the pudding mixture while cooking it to make banana pudding. Next time I will use two less ripe bananas for the layers. Note* it must have a 1/2 teaspoon cream of tarter for the meringue to be stable. Thanks for the recipe!!!!

Didn't set up for me. I have never made a banana cream pie so I read most of the reviews first. I was careful to follow the directions and applying what I read in the reviews. 

The egg whites seemed to take a long time even with chilled bowl and beaters. I shut off my mixer to find an answer and I read on-line if there is the smallest amount of yolk in the whites they might not peak. I went back to try finish beating and they finally started peaking. Clueless. Anyway, the meregue turned out fine but I'll probably not waste my time on this recipe again. Maybe I am one who just needs to use instant pudding mix :/  but it tasted good anyway.

I tried several other banana cream pies to find one for Thanksgiving and after a lot of soupy pies that tasted good but never quite set, we found a winner!  Good thing, too, because we had just about had enough.  This pie, cooked until very thick, worked great.  It was easy to make, easy to serve, and tasted great.  I didn't use meringue, so just cooled it and served with whipped cream.  I will keep a can of sweetened condensed milk on hand so I can have all but the bananas on hand for an "emergency" pie.

Warning:  does come out excellent, but thickened, in this case, is bring custard to a boil.  Otherwise it does turn runny!  Suggestion about using 2 bananas is good too.  When done right, it's an excellent pie!

This was just as easy to make as a packaged mix without any preservatives. I made it for Thanksgiving and everyone enjoyed it! Would definitely make again. I usually bake desserts the day before but I wouldn't try that with this because the crust would get soggy.

I had not made a Banana Cream Pie in more than 30 plus years.  I used to use a recipe from my old Betty Crocker cook book, but it was destroyed several years ago.  I tried this recipe and had the same problem and some others of it being runny.  I should have read the other reviews before I made the pie  I am sure now that I did not cook the custard long enough and I should have let it cool before putting it in the pie shell.

I wish I'd read the reviews before I made this!  Although the pudding does taste delicious, it was completely watery.  I boiled it for quite a while and let it cool before pouring into the shell, and it seemed to have set up well at that point.  I think putting it in the oven while baking the meringue ruined it.  My graham cracker crust completely dissolved in this wet mess!  I liked the idea of a meringue top, but think I'll stick with whipped cream next time so I can keep it cold.  I also added an extra banana, and was very glad I did. One wouldn't have been enough.

I made this with high hopes and made sure to let this boil and thicken and stir the entire time and it still turned to soup once it baked. It looked wonderful before it went into the oven.

I didn't make the meringue, only the banana cream part, but it was SO GOOD!!!  I sliced 2 bananas into the bottom of the crust, so it was completely covered.

This was amazing! Although this recipe needs to be written much better- it leaves out a lot of stuff- just google how to make the top and you won't mess up, I learned a lot of useful stuff! I also doubled the bananas!

This was a very good pie!  I have never made a banana cream pie before, and it turned out beautifully!  The meringue was awesome!  I did let the custard cool before adding to pie.  I also put my mixing bowl and beater in refrigerator before mixing the meringue.

What an incredible pie!  We practice a whole food lifestlye, so I was thrilled to see a recipe that did not require me opening a box of pudding mix!  The custard was perfect alone, never mind mixed in with the bananas.  Although it takes a while, it is well worth the time!

This is a great recipe!! I did make a few changes though. We like a Banana flavoured filling, so I added some Watkins Banana extract, made a Whipped Cream Topping instead of the meringue and topped it with fresh Banana slices when it was served, instead of the layer inside the filling. I also made the pie crust from scratch, and my family and friends Love it. They insist I make it every year for the holidays.

This was awesome! After one bite my sister told me that I had to make it once a week for her! I used cool whip to top it. I cooked the custard until it was very thick and then put it in a dish in the refrigerator for about an hour after reading some people's reviews saying that it got runny. I used twice the bananas and let it sit in the fridge put together for about 8 hours. It was perfect, my new favorite recipe!

By far the best banana cream pie out there.  I took off the merigue and just used whip cream and it was fabulous.  Just keep stirring and cooking and it will go to the right constintly.

This is the best banana cream pie recipe out there, although it will be soupy if you don't up the cornstartch. Also, it makes too much pudding for one crust. I normally buy some smaller graham cracker crusts and fill those with the leftover.

I made this tonight and it turned out really great.  The custard was really thick and creamy.  My husband really enjoyed it.   I used sugar substitute instead of regular white sugar and you can't tell the difference!!    I used Marie Callenders frozen crust.

Very good pie and I will be making it often.  A bit of advice for some of the other reviewers is....
To keep your bananas from turning  brown all you have to do is slice your bananas in a bowl and add a little bit of fresh or bottled real lemon juice, then lightly toss until all your slices have a tiny bit on them.  You don't want them swimming in lemon juice just lightly coated.  This won't have any effect on the taste of your pie at all but will help prevent premature browning of your bananas which I think is unappetizing.  
For the lady who had problems with her meringue pulling away.  All you have to do is make sure that when you spread your meringue on your pie that you bring it all the way to the pie crust edge and push it slightly against it to form an attachment to the crust.  This will prevent it from pulling away while baking.  Also never use less then 3 egg whites per pie.  This makes a nice lofty meringue with plenty to seal at the edges and still have a nice looking pie.
Finally for the lady who stated to only use cold egg whites, I'm sorry but she is wrong there.  Using cold eggs only makes tough meringue which will pull and tear as you cut it.  Ask any older cook and you'll find that using room temperature eggs when baking, especially meringues yields a much loftier and tender meringue and be sure not to brown it too much which also dries it out and makes it tough.  Finally never beat your egg whites in a plastic bowl.  Always use either a clean metal or glass

Not as banana as I would have liked but good... 
As for the runny custard in the middle after the addition of the meringue... meringue weeps as it toasts/stiffens. To fix: 1) pop the naked pie in the preheated oven for about 7-10 minutes  until a light skin forms on the top of the custard, think barrier! 2) fully heat the meringue to 140-145 for 5-7 minutes, until you see big puffs of steam escape. Plop your meringue on top of your pie and pop it back in the oven as the recipe directs.  Cheers!

This is just what I was looking for; a cream pie that does not require the use of a box of pudding! I have made this pie several times, it is my oldest sons' favorite! I have added chocolate chips to this pie with great results. The only change I have made to this recipe is to add more bananas to the pie; one is just not enough.

This is a great tasting recipe, however, it can be frustrating to make if you haven't made a lot of cream pies. I have finally mastered it but have changed how to make it.  More the procedure then the ingredients, Here are my tips and changes. Must be done in a double boiler, heat 2 C milk  (whole) and 1 C 1/2/& 1/2 heat until almost scalding but do not scald. Take out 1 C of hot  milk and add to your whipped till foamy eggs (3 not 4) mix together well, add milk and eggs back into milk, cook for 20 minutes. stirring occasionally (This breaks down the eggs to allow for thickening process) Mix 2/3 C sugar, 1/3 C cornstarch & 1/2 tsp salt (mix together well.) After the 20 minutes add cornstarch mixture and stir constantly for 2 minutes and whisk it into the milk and egg mixture. Cook for another 15 to 20 minutes for the pudding to become thick and a spoon should be able to stand up on it's own in the pan. Take off and add 2 tbsp.  butter and 1/2 tsp vanilla. I will start doubling this recipe, its a lot of work for 1 pie. Allow to completely cool in the fridge with a cover  on top so that the pudding won't have a skin. Put in a cooled pie shell.

Great flavor, but let it sit a long time and it only firmed up on one side of the pie. That still didn't stop my aunt from eating it up though!

Served this along with some other desserts for a "Supper After Hours" group of 25 and got great reviews.  I used whipped cream for the topping as I personally like Banana Cream Pie not Banana Meringue Pie.

We loved this pie so much that we made 3 of them in one weekend.  We couldn't get enough!  I'm currently trying it with strawberries instead of bananas.  I can't wait for it to cool!

This was very tasty and as suggested, I made sure to let it get very thick before adding my bananas. Will definitely use this again.

My sister loved this pie. I think I over whipped my egg whites because my meringue wept after a while. I would definitly put this pudding with bananas and nilla wafers. Much more my style! : )

I honestly don't know what went wrong here, but it went very, very wrong.  The finished product separated into a clear liquid and chunks of "pudding" floating in a pie crust.  It was disgusting to look at and absolutely inedible.  To be fair, the meringue was beautiful.

This recipe does a great job of accentuating the banana flavor. The meringue was beautiful, but I will probably leave it out next time. Had an issue with a clear liquid forming between the custard and the meringue while chilling in the refrigerator. Not sure if it was caused by the meringue preventing heat and steam from escaping during chilling.

I made this pie and it was so easy, it turned out perfect, I was told this recipe is a keeper. I did not change a thing in the recipe, patience is required to get the filling to the perfect set. Made it for a friend and it was his favourite!!

Oh my gosh!  I remember my mom making this pie when I was a very small child.  I never knew the recipe, but this is it!!  Thank you.  I grew up on an Air Force base and for some reason my mom was always baking lots of pies (Iwas very young).  This was my fave.  I loved the meringue rather than the cream topping.

First time making this! Very easy to make both the meringue and the filling, both of which I was nervous about.  The meringue topping I made turned out a little more brown and I put it in for 9 mins, but it looks awesome!  Can't wait to try it!

I followed the recipe and i used almond milk for the first one and the second one i used heavy cream.  The recipe did have alot of extra liquids but every time i made the recipe that is what happened.  The pie came out with a custard texture and everyone loved it.  The flavor was really great and i will definitely make it again.  The only thing i did differently was mash my bananas instead of slice it.

my first time making any kind of pie! had a problem with the meringue.  It separated from the crust and I believe it was the meringue that made the pie wet.  The pudding was firm and delicious.  Not sure what went wrong.

Filling didn't firm up as was expected? Possible goof on my end. The taste was choice, The only variance was I cooked the pudding in a double boiler. The scorch problem does not occur.

Very good pie! I did as others suggested and did not cook pie, just let it chill. It took approx 25 mins for pudding to thicken but it was worth all the stirring! I made whipped topping, not meringue so can't comment on that part of the pie. Got lots of compliments. I will make again.

Do not use the  meringue recipe.  I consider myself a decent cook but I got the "soup" pie like so many others. A good recipe but just use whipped cream and the meringue doesn't work. A liquid mess surrounds the crust. What a disappointment!

Easy to follow I have never attempted a pie with meringue . Worked out great! My husband will be happy for his bday. I use more cornstarch to thicken as I went. I could of had extra water in it from double boiler .

I wish I had read comments before making this.  I had the same issue with the custard being thick before baking the meringue and soup after.  Sad because the custard tasted fine.  I've generally used flour to thicken custards and not had this problem, and wonder if using cornstarch is the problem?

This was my first attempt at any custard or meringue. It turned out very well, with some tips from the comments section (boil custard, extra banana etc.)  I'm sure there's some part where the pie is supposed to "set", but it doesn't say that anywhere. I didn't wait to add the meringue & there didn't seem to be any consequences for that. I allowed it to cool about 1 hour before surprising my husband with it. It was a custard outer shell and pudding center. But what was left of the pie was perfect the next morning.
The custard was excellent as directed.
For the meringue I added some nutmeg & vanilla, as well as sugar to taste. I saw a suggestion to add baking powder, which I did too. But since I've never done this before I have no comparison, but no complaints either.
I would definitely cook this recipe again. Only next time I may allow it to set a while longer.

This is a good recipe but ingredients have some errors.  You call for 1/2 cup of sugar but call for sugar in both the pudding mix and the meringue.  I put a 1/2 cup in both.  Also same with vanilla, recipe calls for 1/4 tsp but text asks for  vanilla in both pudding mix and meringue top.  I put in both.  In text for pudding it asks for 1 Tbl of vanilla.obviously way to much.  The pie came outbreak.so I guess my changes didn't hurt.  I gave it 4 stars on.

Delicious! I was a big fail after 2 attempts at the Meringue, so I just used whipped cream. And I added 1 Tablespoon Banana Flavoring in with the Vanilla flavoring in the pudding.BEST PUDDING EVER!!!! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!! PS- Read through tips in reviews before making, they probably would have helped me be successful with my meringue. But cool whip is yummy with it too!

I have made banana cream pies for years, suggestion so the pie won't be runny, use a 1/2 cup of cornstarch , (the meringue will not cause the pie to be runny).  If you don't use enough cornstarch or flour, whatever thickener you prefer, the pie will not set up.  Once you top the pie with the meringue, set oven to broil and only leave  pie in long enough till meringue is a light brown no more than 3 or 4 minutes leave oven door open a crack, keep a close eye on pie so it does not burn.

Yes and there is an Error. It says " Remove from heat and stir in butter and 1 tablespoon vanilla." this should read and the 1/4 teaspoon.

AMAZING!!! My first time making ANY sort of pie and this recipe rocked!! My family was extremely impressed and I already have requests to make this for an upcoming party. The meringue was delicate and wonderful, the custard was yummm (I even licked it off the pan later!). I did put in two layers of banana though, one at the bottom and one in the middle. Great recipe!!! Thank you!!

Flavor was great until I put pie in the oven to brown tips, 15 min, way too long, Pie turned out runny, next time I may not even put the pie in the oven.

My husband requested banana cream pie for his birthday, so I decided to give this recipe a try.  He said it was wonderful (and since he had 2 pieces, I believe him).

Thank you!
