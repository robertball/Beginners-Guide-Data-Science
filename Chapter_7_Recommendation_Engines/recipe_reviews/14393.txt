hmmmm... tomatoes and mustard... 2 of my least favorite things yet 2 of my husband's faves. But they say a way to a man's heart is through his stomach and I am jonesing for a new digital camera that costs 900 so I made the salad. And to my surprise it is quite good. We had nicely ripened yet firm tomatoes and this made huge amount of salad. My dh hasn't tried it yet but I know he will love love love it. You think the mustard is going to be to much but it isn't. It makes a great summer salad! I will make this again and I will eat it too even though I doubted the recipe at first.

This was a wonderful addition to my Easter meal. The trio of mustards complemented the ham beautifully. Much to my husband's dismay there were no leftovers so I'll have to make this dish again very soon. Can't say enough about it - it was just so good!

LOVED this! The dressing was tangy but not puckeringly so and it went perfectly with the crunchy juicy veggies. I omitted the onion because I don't like it subbed olive oil for veg and toasted the mustard seeds to bring out the flavor and add a nice smoky touch to the dish (which probably mellowed the tang a bit). I served it over romaine but it's delicious on its own as well. This is a new favorite!

I was surprised that this had such a kick and I omitted the hot pepper sauce all together. This was a good way to use up fresh everything from my garden.

I was really dissappointed in this salad. It wasn't bad but I didn't find it very flavorful and I'm not sure why. Especially the second day. Probably won't make again.

Easy to prepare and great for summer veggies. I went light on the hot sauce. I want to try it tossed with boiled potatoes chopped veggies and capers then chilled.
