I had coconut milk and chicken broth leftover from making dinner last night. This used the leftovers and was perfect for my lunch today. It definitely needs salt, but I think next time I will double the curry, chili, and ginger to give it more flavor.

Wow, really enjoyed this for lunch today.  I added a bit more ginger, salt & pepper.  The curry flavor is subtle, and I would have liked a little more spiciness, so I'll try red curry paste the next time to suit our personal tastes.  This made two servings (appetizer size that you'd get at an Asian restaurant).  Thanks for sharing, I'll be making this again.

This soup is incredibly delicious. I added red chile paste, two teaspoons. We all love it!
