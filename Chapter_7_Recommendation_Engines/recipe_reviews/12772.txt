Because I love haddock, I am always trying new fish recipes.  This one was good.  Next time I may add a little something because it felt too oniony and maybe a little bland.  Maybe broccoli would do it.  Also, this should definitely be served with potatos not rice.  I won't make that mistake again.  It took away from the wonderful fish flavor!

This is easy and quite good.  We have also made the same recipe substituting condensed lobster or crab bisque for the mushroom soup and found it to be fantastic.

This recipe is excellent! Of course, i didn't follow it exactly (I never do follow recipes to a "t") but it sure was a hit. I baked a mixture of haddock and shrimp with onions, mushrooms and asparagus. The cream of mushroom soup was excellent. I paired it with garlic mashed potatoes and voila! instant comfort food. I am making it again this week, except I will use chicken and shrimp, cream of chicken soup, fresh broccoli and mushrooms.

Thanks for the fantastic recipe!

My husband and toddler loved it. I personly do not like fish but this was very good, but i was confused about the soup was not sure if I should make it by direction on the can or just pour it over. I made it by the can and realized I should have just pour it over. The cheese in the recipe is the dairy to be added to it. Enjoy it!

This recipe made for a wonderful dinner.  I used cream of asparagus soup and added a can of asparagus to the baking dish, which turned out to be very good.  I'll be making this dish again soon!

My husband loved this dish.  I used pollock fillets, and it turned out very well.  I added some lemon juice to mine because I found it fairly bland.  Next time, I'll need to add something to spice it up.  But...there will definitely be a next time.

I seasoned the fish with salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder.  I put chopped broccoli, carmelized onions, and mushrooms on top of the fish, and then added the can of mushroom soup, and topped it all with the shredded cheese.  This exceeded my husband's expectations. Very good!!

Great recipe - easy & delicious. I used very little onion (we aren't onion fans) and added fresh sliced mushrooms. Even my 2 kids liked it.  Definitely will make this again.

This is a very easy receipe.  Full of flavour.  Its a good receipe because you can get it ready, put it in the oven for 40 minutes while you prepare the other food.  Will definitely make this again!

I thought this was wonderful and easy to make.  My husband had two servings for dinner and took what was left for lunch.  That's saying something since he 'hates' leftovers.  Thanks!!

This recipe was a bit bland. It needed something but I don't know what. The fish, however, came out perfectly moist and flaky. Also, I would skip adding pepper next time because even the tiny bit I added was overwhelming.

My family loved it! We don't usually eat fish, but when we were given some haddock I tried this recipe and everyone wanted more. We will definitely be adding this to our regular menu line up and sharing it with family and friends!

I have made this several times now and I have to say we don't eat a great deal of fish but this recipe has certainly changed that!!  I have made it just as the recipe calls for and I have also added broccoli under it first. Making it for Sunday dinner for company tomorrow...again!!

Easy fast recipe. I am not a fan of can soup, so I made my own white sauce( flour& butter and milk) . I love making this recipes for family & friends, they always ask for the recipe.

I would have rated this a 2 but my husband would have rated it a 4 so I think this is really a matter of taste.  I found all the tastes very distinct:  like I was eating haddock, onion, cream of mushroom soup, and cheese rather than a dish where those elements combined nicely.  That didn't bother my husband, though.  I think the onion needs to be sauteed before adding.  If you leave the onion raw (even thinly sliced), it's still crisp and raw tasting after cooking.  I think adding some crushed ritz crackers on top would have improved the taste as well.  While I won't be making this again, my husband is certainly glad we tried it once!  Thanks.

VERY good.  I used 5 haddock fillets (2 rectagular blocks) and thawed them for 2 and 1/2 days in fridge before using. I added whole carrots along sides of pyrex dish.  Carrots were good in the dish. I didn't have cream of mushroom so I used cream of asparagus.   My kids ate it.  Was Very easy.  I think you don't need to add any extra salt because soup is salty anyway.   Thanks for a nice recipe.  S.A. Shay

This was very delicious. I took advice from other reviewers and added broccoli. I also substituted green onions instead of regular onions. I steamed the broccoli for 10 mins before adding it to the fish. Then spooned the soup over fish and broccoli,added cheddar cheese and for a nice twist topped it off with crushed Ritz crackers. Baked 350 for 30 mins. My fiancee doesn't care for fish but he really liked this and had seconds.

Wonderful and Easy. My 8 yr old said "Most Awesomest Fish". I sauteed a can of mushrooms with the onions. Sprinkled the fish with Mrs. Dash with the salt/pepper. Layered 1 lb of shrimp on top of fish, then onions, soup, and cheese. Thanks for the recipe- this one is a keeper!

This was a winner.  I used frozen haddock loins, fat free low sodium mushroom soup, vidallia onion and fat free cheddar cheese slices.  My husband got home late so it spent 2 hrs. on warm in the oven and it was still tasty.  Served it with mashed potatoes, sauted red & yellow peppers & onion and roasted yellow and green squash.  Loved it.

What a surprise! I try to make fish different each Friday, but I was iffy on this since the ingredients sounded more like a beef or pork dish. It was so good! Not to mention easy! The kids asked if I would make it again this week too!

I omitted the cheese to save some fat cals, but even without the cheese, this was great!  I used garlic salt and freshly ground pepper...yum!  This was so easy to make.

This recipe is easy, good for you, and open to all kinds of tasty variations..what ever is in your pantry. I like to saute the onions, with added chopped garlic before baking.Very good recipe!

This was good.  I used Kingfish instead of Haddock because that was what we caught and it was perfect as kingfish (aka - bluefish) is a fishy fish and the soup gave it a very pleasant flavor!  I carmelized the onions and added several carmelized cloves of garlic as well.  I also thined the soup a bit with skim milk so it wasn't so overbearing.  We served it up a fresh salad, crusty bread and asparagus. I plan on making this again and using a condensenced shrimp bisque adding chopped shrimp to it and doubling the onion and garlic.

I wanted a different way to prepare haddock last Friday night and found this recipe. I spent more time finding the soup aisle in the supermarket than it took to prepare this recipe. Our meal was great and this recipe is a real keeper.

We were looking for an easy, tasty fish dish for Lenten Fridays, and this one is IT!  We also have adapted it for lower calories, using lowfat condensed soup and fat free cheddar cheese.  Still tastes great!

Instead of Haddock fish, I used orange roughy.  It really had a good taste and not fishy. We needed something different besides frying.

So excellent!! We didn't vary much from the recipe. We added brocolli, and only baked it for 30min, covered for 20min. We served this with baked potatoes - we really loved it!! We did use cream of celery, but really any of the cream soups would work depending on your preferance. We also added garlic. Oh ya and we used less onion, maybe by half based on so many of the reviews. Will definitely be making this again!

Wonderful, easy dinner idea! I use Cream of Broccoli instead. If I need a larger, all in one meal, I use a large casserole dish and after putting the fish in and pouring the soup on top, I put fresh cut broccoli around the edges of the dish...then once I used a can of cheese soup and spread over the broccoli. (Didn't have shredded on hand) MMM...hot melted cheese and broccoli :) I also sprinkle a little parmesan cheese on the fish before covering it with the shredded sharp cheddar. Just gives it a little more flavor. My daughter always goes back for seconds with this meal! Oh, and always rice as the side :)

we (one new yorker & one pennsylvanian) thought the recipe was good and are scoring it 3 1/2 stars. i lightly sauteed my onions & sprinkled a few ritz cracker crumbs over top for added texture. this haddock dish goes well with brown rice & corn on the cob. thanks susan!

Wow, what a great dish!  Very easy and very hearty.  I used Amy's Organic Cream of mushroom soup -- so so good!  Next time, I'll dice the onions.  Excellent.  Wouldn't hesitate to make this for guests.

As written is is okay but prefer to saute the onion first and also use an older cheddar cheese.  Definitely great comfort food.  Actually you can use any cheese that you prefer and just results in a different taste. Thanks Nova Scotia...............

This was simply fantastic! So easy and SO SO SO delicious! I served it with peas and roasted potatoes...but mashed potatoes would be wonderful, too.
I used 2 cans of mushroom soup (instead of one), and I got this wonderful sauce (that tasted fantastic over the potatoes and peas!!) I only used 3/4 of an onion because it seemed like enough at the time - but now wish I had used more, as they were a nice addition (even my husband, who isn't a big fan of lots of onion, even remarked on how he enjoyed the onions). Also - I made this in a large baking dish, so I had a single layer of fish on the bottom. Not sure if that matters. This gets HIGH marks with us!

Might I first say that there are much too many onions in this dish. I made it because I, for one, hate Haddock and thought I might try out a recipe to try and give it some flavor besides vinegar and bread crumbs. I even followed the other reviews and still nothing. I'm very sorry, but for my palette, this dish needs further revision.

I first tried this recipe a year ago after having been served it at a dinner while visiting friends in Nova Scotia.  Have made it 3 times at home so far & we enjoy it very much each time.  Whenever i see fresh wild caught haddock at the market, I know what we will be having for dinner.  Thanks for passing this gem on.  I agree with others that this is wonderful served with mashed potatoes.  Veda

Absolutely yummy. I added 1 TB of lemon juice and changed the cream of mushroom to cream of broccoli.  Also added chopped broccoli around the edge.

My family really enjoyed this dish a lot and want this served again. This is great too because it uses things that are staples in any kitchen pantry. I used Orange Roughy. My son liked it so much he ate 3 pieces. There was too much onion though and next time I will cut that in half. Thanks for the great recipe!

Thought this recipe was ok....I did carmelize the onions and added extra mushrooms.  I also added some garlic powder, but was still a little bland.  I will try this again adding more spices or even using a different type of cream soup.

Very good, but the time stated to bake as 40 min. is way to long for any fish fillets. I shut the oven off after 20 min. and let sit.

My husband and I LOVED this dish! I sauteed onions along with fresh mushrooms first and then followed the recipe.  I used some other white fish that was on sale, instead of haddock and I used shredded Colby-Jack cheese instead of Cheddar and that was very good.  I served it over Basmati rice (or any other white rice).  It was awesome!  I will definitely make it again!

Awesome!  I sprinkled about 2 tbls of breadcrumbs on top of the soup.  I also used fat free cream of mushroom soup and it was still great.  My husband loved it as well.

I must confess, I'm Nova Scotian and, before tonight, I'd never eaten this dish. It could have something to do with the fact that I flat-out refused to eat any type of seafood as a child. Apparently, every single person I know has eaten this, and all of them rave about it. I'm a big seafood eater now though and this dish is really tasty. It's definately comfort food. We had it with heaps of garlic mashed potatoes. Mmmmmmmmmm.

I'm not a huge fish fan, but wanting to change up our meals I searched for an easy fish recipe and found this. It's amazing what you can do with canned soup! The fish was so moist and so tender. Very delicious! I've also made this with cream of cheddar cheese soup and left out the grated cheese on top.

This needs some chicken bouillon mixed with the soup and maybe some garlic and other seasonings.  Not very tasty as written.

Just had this tonight, and it was a smash hit!  I did make a few little tweaks, tho, thus the 4-star rating.  I had never cooked with haddock before so, not knowing what to do with the skin, I left it on---it was fine.  I seasoned the fish lightly with salt / pepper and some garlic powder;  the mushroom soup I mixed with 3-4 tblsp of skim milk and the juice of a whole lemon.  It was delicious!!!  We will definitely be having this again in the future---thank you!!

Yummy yummy yummy!!!! My husband buys haddock in 10 pound boxes, so am always looking for new ways to cook it.  This recipe seemed to appeal to my effort level and the ingredients I had on hand tonight.  Dinner was made easily in under an hour and complete with green beans and rice, we enjoyed it thoroughly!!!  I will make Bubbly Bake again and I would not change one single thing!  I highly recommend this one. Thank you Susan! :-)

Very good - did do a few modifications. I like to add more veggies, so I sauteed the onions with a red pepper, orange pepper, and 2 small jalapeno. After sauteing, I added 1 small zucchini, chopped, and a can of chopped mushrooms. I changed the cream of mushroom soup to cream of chicken and served the whole thing over pasta. My husband and I both loved it!

The ingredients are a good basis for a quick and easy dinner. Three stars because I think a little difference in prep will make for better flavor. I sauteed sliced onions and mushrooms in a little butter. I splashed a little vermouth in, let it reduce and then stirred in 1/2 the mushroom soup. I spread this over a well-patted dry piece of haddock. I baked about 20 minutes. I added 1/4 c. of vermouth to the rest of the mushroom soup. I poured over the dish then baked 5 minutes more. After baking removed the haddock to a serving dish, sprinkled with the cheese and let it sit 10 minutes. Stirred the mushroom soup and veggies, then served the sauce separately. Turned out pretty good. A friend suggested a few chopped tomatoes on the top might even be nice. Served it with steamed broccoli and wild rice. Garlic mashed potatoes would be yummy too!

I changed a couple things: old cheddar instead of mild ( gave it a sharper taste) and put broccoli right in like someone else suggested. I added a touch of garlic and seasoning salt.
It was very good! Even those who don't normally enjoy fish would probably quite like this one! My 3 year old tolerated it and my 1 year old gobbled it up!

We really liked this (well we are Nova Scotians too).  Unfortunately, I didn't read the rest of the reviews before making it and didn't saute the onions.  Next time I will, they weren't cooked.  I used low fat cream of mushroom and also added broccoli.  Other reviewers found that the ingredients didn't mix, and the soup overpowered the fish. I didn't find that at all.  As another reviewer said, I just can't give a 5 star to a canned soup recipe, however, we really liked it and will def make again.

Love this recipe!  I had it a lot growing up but we used a very small amount of minced onion so as to not over-power the dish with onion flavor.  Also, can't imagine having it with anything but rice (white or pilaf).  The extra sauce on the rice is yummy.  Potatoes just don't go with fish IMHO!

I will say it's easy to make and it offers a nice alternative to the typical New England style Baked Haddock dishes.  I do suggest covering with foil as to not burn the cheese and brocoli.  I will probably make this again and next time, will add some shrimp to the dish for variety.  I served it with a side or risotto and it was very good.

Mmm. Comfort food. I used a garlic cream o' mush soup but I didn't think I would have enough sauce to drizzle on both the fish and the mashed potatoes I'd made (I also made sauteed apples from this site). I had about 8 oz. of light sour cream in the 'fridge, so put 1 tablespoon corn starch, 1/4 cup milk,1/2 teaspoon white pepper, and a dollop of Better than Bouillon lobster base in a jar and shook it. I mixed in the sour cream and added it to the soup on top the fish. So amazingly good, especially with the mashed potatoes and sauteed apples. Definately comfort food. :)

This dish was very good, I think I cooked it a little too long though because the cheese was rather brown on top. I used ritz crackers under cheese which gave it a little crunch. Hubby loved it. I will be making this again!

This was a fast and easy recipie.I had 6 perch filets in my freezer just waiting for a recipie to try. I doubled this recipie using 1 can of cream of mushroom along with one can of cream of shrimp soup. I also cooked the onions first like others said to do and put crackers on top. It was a little salty on top, so I will use unsalted crackers next time. I have a 14 year old son who is a picky eater and he absolutely loved this!! My boyfriend loved it too! there were no leftovers tonight! thanks for a very easy and delicious way to cook my fish!!

Excellent recipe. Very easy to prepare. I, too, sauteed the onion first and used cream of chicken with herbs soup. Will definitely use the recipe again, probably with different fish.

The recipe was easy and quick to follow but my family just didn't care for it.  Normally, we never had leftovers with Haddock before so this was a first for me.

It was a good easy recipe but lacked that certain "something" I look for - I agree w/ previous reviewers that it was quite bland - I think it would have benefited greatly with some additional seasoning.  I would advise people to use thawed fish that has been drained as my fish didn't come out soupy or watery at all.

This was ok,  I added white wine to my soup before pouring it over my fish. It SMELLED WONDERFUL, but it was a little disappointing.  Sorry, but I probably won't make this again.  Oh yeah, I used snapper, I don't think that had anything to do with us not liking it though.

Excellent recipe.  I hadn't any mushroom soup so made up a thick white butter & flour & milk sauce and added 4 chopped mushrooms.  This worked well.  Doing it this way the fish wasn't soupy as some have found. I baked two sweet potatoes (scrubbed and quartered - serving 2 people) and baked them alongside the haddock dish in foil with olive spread and garlic.  They complimented the haddock well.

Everybody who had it loved it.  I actually used Tilapia on which I robbed garlic powder/lite salt/ fresh blk pepper.  To make it somewhat healthier used: lite salt, Healthy Req soup, Fat Free Cheddar Cheese.  Also used red onion and extra virgin olive oil to "grease" dish. 
To make it taste even better you can add:thin sliced potatoes, or cooked ziti (or similar), sprinkle bread crumbs on top of cheese.

This is my husbands' favorite dish, and it is so easy and quick to make.  I add some fresh mushrooms to it, too.  Every time I try a new recipe, my husband will tell me, "it's good, but it's no haddock bubby bake!"

I melted a stick of butter in my casserole dish first then added 3 blocks of Icelandic haddock.  Added salt and pepper and minced onions to the fish.  Then I topped the fish with frozen diced potatoes and added a little more salt and pepper with some Mrs. Dash salt free seasoning.  I mixed two cans of cream of mushroom soup with one can of carnations evaporated milk. Poured half of the mix over the potatoes and fish then added broccoli on top of the potatoes and poured the remaining soup mixture over that.  Topped it off with mild cheddar cheese and a little bit of Mrs.Dash.  Cooked it in oven for 50 minutes at 350•.  DELICIOUS!  Next time I’ll try golden mushroom soup.

I have made this dozens of times in the last several years, since originally finding the recipe here. It's delicious made as stated, and I've also had success making a few tweaks if my pantry didn't have all of the correct ingredients. I've used Haddock and Tilapia, I've used breaded and non-breaded, and I've used frozen and thawed fillets. All have been a success. This is such a great cold-wet-weather crowd pleaser... something about it just warms you from the inside!! It is best with mashed potatoes, and we like it with green beans or asparagus!

When I make this dish...I sauté onions and garlic in olive oil,  once they are translucent I add garlic powder,  parsley, green onion, salt & pepper and a dash of paprika and a can of cocktail shrimp liquid drained.  Mix well and heat then a can of cream of mushroom soup and a can of cream of celery and using the empty can I add 1 and half cans of milk. Blend and warm all ingredients together... (this alone tastes wonderful )  I place my fish in a casserole dish pour my soup mixture on the cover with grated cheddar cheese (old) bake at 375....serve with mixed veggies and mashed potatoes. .....I'm a Scotia girl too!

Very good, some people don't like how the onions turn out though. I think next time I will caramelize them beforehand. Once I used a golden cream of mushroom soup. I personally didn't like it as much, but try it for yourself!

Had a similar recipe and it just adds 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice poured over the haddock before the cream of mushroom...yum!  Adds a great tangy taste to this fish dish.

My husband made this recipe tonight for supper and we absolutely loved it.  He followed the recipe exactly as posted.  He found it very easy to follow and the ingredients blend perfectly.  Thank you from one Maritimer to another.

I loved this recipe and so did my family. Even my 15 month old grandson gobbled it down.  I did sautee the onions and I added a bag of california mix veggies. Served over garlic mashed potatoes. Definitely making again!

Not bad....I'd like to try it with chicken. Didn't put salt and I'm glad because the cream of mushroom has plenty.

Quick, easy and TASTY! In addition to the slices of onion, I also put slices of scotch bonnet peppers onto the fish, and added fresh broccoli flowerets to the dish before spooning the cream of mushroom soup over everything.

I'm from Nova Scotia too and have been making this recipe since I learned it in a Jr. High Home Economics class!  My recipe is the same but uses slightly less fish and a lot less onion, plus a tablespoon of lemon juice. It can be baked at 450 for only 15 minutes or so. (In case you're in more of a rush!)  It is also good with scallops or any other whitefish (cod, etc.)  I usually serve it with rice and a steamed veggie such as broccoli, carrots or green beans.  Going to try to make it in the slow cooker today!

I liked this recipe.  I used cod instead of haddock and it worked well.  I would saute the onions first next time and use less of them.

I think the recipe as-is is okay so I added a layer of boxed bread stuffing (stove top stuffing) and I mixed a bit of celery powder into the the soup.

I've also had it with scallops added to the white fish....wishing I had some this time around :)

I used brussel sprouts and Brie and it was delicious.  Except the use of sodium-filled canned soup concerns me and I would like to adapt with that new Greek yogurt that is everywhere now and sauteed mushroom and onion and fresh herbs!

I thought this recipe was pretty good, my boyfriend loved it.  One thing I will say is that it's tough not to end up with a watery casserole.  I thoroughly patted my fish dry...maybe it was the onions?  Anyhow, I used 1/2 an onion instead of a whole based on previous comments, it seemed like just the right amount.  Also, I didn't have any cream of mushroom, so I used condensed cheddar soup and light monterey jack cheese.  I put the broccoli on the side because it was frozen and I didn't want all the extra water, and that was great.  A good variation, other than my water troubles.

Excellent! I diced my onions and used perch as that was all I had. Served with garlic mashed potatoes, peas and sweet & sour red cabbage. Very tasty. Since my 2 year old ate it, I will make it again.

This is my favorite way to cook Haddock!  I usually add some thyme and fresh parsley for extra pizzazz. Good accompanied with brown rice or mashed potatoes.

Great recipie!  I used the healthy request cream of mushroom soup instead of the fattening version...watch the amount that you actually put on though because I realized after the first time making it that it tasted a little too salty with the haddock smothered.  I also used a lighter cheddar cheese to keep the calorie count down.  I would absolutely make it again!

We've been making this recipe for so long now, that I decided I had to rate it. It's easier than making a sandwich and it tastes great. Sometimes we add sliced mushrooms and a sprinkle of breadcrumbs for a change. We always look forward to making this on week nights. I give it a 4 because I could only give a 5 to a recipe that didn't include condensed soup.

This was a disappointment.
It was bland, even with extra shredded cheese.  Mushy, watery, no harmony whatsoever.  If I would have had a bottle of ketchup on hand I would have dumped it all over the plate just to wake up my taste buds.

I read somewhere that the soup overpowers the fish. Perhaps a strong mushroom soup would but I used cream of chicken as that's all I had. And there was no problem with the fish's flavor coming through. It IS soupy though, then again some of my fillets were stillpartially frozen. The cheese when it melts adds wetness too though, but I think, served over rice, taht'd take care of the problem. I added paprika and used sharp cheese.. next time I'll use milder cheddar. I suggest serving it over rice.

This doesn't deserve more than 3 stars sorry.  Although the flavor was good, I suggest you use a cheaper fish like talapia or pollock.  The soup takes over most of the flavor of the fish.  Chopping the onion would have been better too.

I love this recipe!  I made it last night using pollock and it was a hit with my family!

My only comment:  it was soupy -- no pun intended.  Maybe because the pollock went directly from freezer to casserole dish and, I only had a pound of the pollock.  I will definitely make this dish again;  I think it will be good with tilapia.

Great recipe! I wanted to find something different to do with my fish instead of the usual lemon and dill. I used shredded tex mex cheese and it tasted fabulous.

Delicious, not one complaint.  My finace is wicked picky about food, especially fish.  He loved this dish.  It was so easy, perfect for a weekday dinner.  I used cream of broccoli instead of mushroom (my finace doesn't like mushrooms)  I also added some fresh broccoli to cook with it.  I served over seasoned rice and viola!!!  Thanks  :)

I'm not a big fish fan, but I made this for dinner last night and it was great!! The best thing about is that it works with my low carb diet. The only thing I changed was that I made it without the onions. It made me want to eat fish more often! I can't wait to have this again!
