Yum, this recipe turned out wonderfully with some slight changes! I made this recipe the traditional way w/out a bread machine by proofing yeast w/ 1 tbs honey and warm water for about 10mins. Then added the rest of the ingredients (I cup of flour at a time until elastic),  kneaded the dough for about 6-8 mins and let it rise until doubled.

Changes: 
•	I made these into 12 large sweet rolls instead of breadsticks. Since the dough is pretty sweet I didn’t add any additional sugar, I just left out the seeds.  If you are making breadsticks I'd decrease the sugar to 2-3 tbs. and you might want to try adding some garlic, oregano, and onion powder to the dough to make it really tasty. 
•	The trick to getting a crunchy exterior is by spraying the dough with oil before baking. You will get a better texture if you use bread four instead of all-purpose (although, all-purpose still works well).  If you are still getting a tough breadstick try decreasing the sugar (sugar competes with the yeast for liquid), and/or increase the butter to 4 tbs). 
Wonderful recipe besides those small changes!!!

SENSATIONAL!  I am having company from out of town tomorrow, and will be serving a spaghetti and meatball dinner.  I wanted something extra special and different for a bread.  After finding this one, I decided to try it.  Ite was easy and wonderful!  However, instead of rolling the dough into 18 separate balls and then rolling them out individually, I rolled the dough into a rectangle, and took a pizza cutter, cutting the dough into strips.  It worked perfectly, and was time saving.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

These were great.  Crunchy on the outside and soft and chewy inside.  I added garlic powder, oregano, basil, and parsley to the dough.  I used the stand mixer and did not double the recipe.  I kneaded by hand for aobut 10 minutes, and let the dough rest for 10 minutes before shaping.

Excellent recipe. The dough was extremely easy to work with and easy to add any personal touch you may want I.E. garlic butter, oregano etc. I took the tip from STACERP and LCAROLINE to roll dough out in rectangle and cut  with knife or pizza cutter. For crispier sticks cook at 400º for 8 min then reduce heat to 350º until golden brown.

Easy & delicious!  I baked the bread sticks on a pizza baking stone - didn't need to spray it with nonstick spray - they came out golden brown and perfect.  I liked being able to use the bread machine to mix it and go through the initial rise.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe.

These are the best homemade bread sticks I have had. They are also very quick and easy.  I vary the recipe by substituting olive oil for the butter and adding a liitle salt.

I must admit I changed the recipe.  Trying to be more healthy, I substituted 1.5 cups wheat flour and added 1/4 cup wheat germ; left out the sesame seeds because children don't like them.  LOVED this!  Will definitely be making as often as I have time.  Also, don't have a bread machine, so I just mixed it all together, kneaded 5 min, left to rise, then shaped and baked.  Not sure why they say "3 hrs." it takes me about an hour and a quarter.

Still love these!  Still don't have a bread machine, though, and don't keep powdered milk on hand, so I just substitute regular milk for the water, add sugar and yeast, let sit for a few minutes to proof, add to rest of ingredients, mix, knead for a bit (4-5 min) then proof in slightly warm oven for 30-45 min.  Then, bake and heavenly!  My family fight over them.  Depending on the meal, I also sometimes add garlic and/or Italian herbs.  Absolutely the best!

Took a leap of faith and the suggestions of some of the other reviewers and pleased to report that these breadsticks were fantastic! I do not own a breadmaker but am experienced in bread baking, no problems. My first alteration was because of ingredient constraints - no powered milk. I have never used it. Subbed 2/3 cp milk and 2/3 water.  Omitted the sesame seeds as I wanted them to be Italian bread sticks. So I added 1 tsp Italian dried spices and 1 tsp garlic powder to the proofed yeast mixture along with the salt. I did try the water-spraying trick another cook mention but I didn't find that the sticks were particularly more crunchy on the outside. Ten mins into baking time, I basted them with a melted butter, garlic powder and parmesan cheese combo and continued baking another 10 mins.  I weighed the dough to 2 oz a piece to insure uniformed size sticks and even baking. Perfection! Thanks Paula and thanks for listening!

Great basic breadstick recipe.  I mix the yeast, 2/3 cup warm water and 2/3 cup cup milk (instead of powdered milk).  I let it sit for a few minutes and then add other ingredients.    I knead it by hand and let it rest a few minutes before rolling it out into a rectangle.  Then I cut it with a pizza roller.    Breadsticks are best eaten in a day or so.  I often put the dough in refrigerator for a couple days to have fresh breadsticks later.  Then I let dough return to room temp and cut breadsticks.

Awesome! Addicting! It taste soft, tender, and slightly buttery.  My modifications: (My first time) in a bread machine  I used 2/3 cup water and 2/3 cup milk.  4 TB butter 2 cups bread flour 2 cups all purpose 2tsp salt 2 TB sugar 2 1/2 tsp yeast. I made them in rolls instead and waited for 30-45 mins to rise. Then baked for 5 mins then added garlic parmesan butter. Then baked for the remaining of the time. It was soft and had a crunchy exterior.   The second time, I used the same recipe above, but used 4 cups all purpose flour. My bread sticks were soft on the outside and inside! It depends what texture you like!   Sooo addicting and good!
_____________________________________

Guess what? It gets even better! I used this dough for making pizza! Oh it was amazing. Roll out the dough in a pizza pan/cookie sheet. Place toppings: pizza sauce first and follow with veggies, then top with mozzarella cheese and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese! Bake at 450 for 13 mins-15 mins! Enjoy! My friends raved about this pizza and the bread sticks! Fantastic!

I love these!  The first night I only made 9...the second night I made 27 and froze them.  They freeze and reheat well.  Just pop them in the oven at 350 for about 10 minutes.  I made a few changes to these, mostly for personal preference.  I reduced the sugar by half, and replaced it with raw honey (so 2 tbsp. raw honey instead of 4 tbsp. sugar).  I omitted the powdered dry milk as I didn't have any.  I also used half whole wheat flour.  These are crunchy on the outside and chewy and soft on the inside.  I brushed them with melted butter when they came out of the oven and sprinkled with garlic salt -- they taste a lot like Olive Garden's this way.  :)  Will make them a lot, keep them in the house!

BTW, without a bread machine -- proof the yeast in water with sugar or honey, mix in butter and salt, then flour.  I kneaded for about 10 min. until the dough was the proper consistency.  I let it rise in a warm oven for about an hour.  Then I rolled the sticks out, and let them rise another 30 - 45 min.  Then, I baked them for about 15 min.  This is a great BASIC recipe.  If you want them to taste any particular way -- cinnamon, garlic, etc. -- you must add your own topping or add some spices to the dough.

Pressed into a cinnamon/sugar mixture. Whoala...healthy cinnamon rolls

Very delicious! The first time I made them they were extremely heavy, but that was definitely my fault as I hadn't kneaded the dough enough. The second time was great, I added garlic, oregano and some basil to the mixture. I let the dough rise in a warm oven and after 30 minutes I rolled it out and used a pizza cutter to cut them into strips - a tip from another member that worked great! I spread some olive oil on the top and 10 minutes into baking I put butter, a little more garlic salt, and oregano as well as some Parmesan and mozzarella cheese. These were very scrumptious and I will definitely be making them again in the future!

my husband loved it!  I followed some of the other suggestions and made the following changes:  changed the water and powdered milk to 2/3 cup milk and 2/3 cup water. Omitted the sesame seeds I added 1 tsp Italian dried spices and 1 tsp garlic powder.   7 mins into baking time, I basted them with a melted butter, dash of italian seas and garlic powder and parmesan.  Took about 14 min too cook.    I'll try sesame seeds next time with out the Ital. Seas.

My favorite breadsticks come from Sisley Restaurants in the Los Angeles area.  Paula's are good.  I've made these a few times, (using a mixer), they are fast and easy to make. I have a few changes to suggest.
Use about one third whole wheat flour, and bread flour for the rest.
Instead of sugar, use 2 - 3 Tablespoons honey, that makes them moister.
Use milk in place of half of the water, and skip the powdered milk.
Brush with olive oil before baking.
I didn't have sesame seeds, they're fine without.

I tried making a cheesy bread stick tonight- YUM!
I cut some mozzarella cheese sticks lengthwise in quarters, and cut some cheddar cheese into similar sized lengths.  I rolled the dough into a log shape about six inches x 3/4 inch, then flattened the log, wrapped the dough around the cheese, pinched the seam together, placed the seam down on a buttered baking sheet, let rise while oven preheats, then baked about 12 min. at 375f.   Wow!   the kids liked the mozzarella, and I liked the cheddar.

This recipe can be doubled, and the breadsticks still disappear too fast.  I'm not sure if my mixer can handle tripling, but I will have to try that if I want any left over.

Didn't use sesame seeds because I didn't have any....Used 1 & 1/2 tsp. salt & 1/2 tsp. garlic salt; added a bit of garlic powder & onion powder & then sprinkled with parmesan cheese.  Plain tasting, so sprayed with Butter Flavored Cooking Spray, sprinkled parsley, onion & garlic powder & parmesan.  Better...but still not amazing.  Very plain-tasting.  Served with Baked Potato Soup (From This Site) & a Fresh Salad with chopped veggies in it.  Next time, I will load up on the flavorings before rolling out

The first time I made these, I only made 8 out of the dough. They were really good but rather large. Now I make 16 to a batch. I melt a tablespoon of butter, mix in some garlic salt and brush it on the bread sticks about five minutes before they are ready to come out of the oven. They taste alot like the bread sticks at the Olive Garden. Awesome, thanks.

Paula, I've used this recipe several times and just wanted to say "Thank you, they're great!"  I've used whole wheat for some of the flour at times, also.  I occasionally substitute brown sugar or honey for the white sugar.
I was happy to find these...they ARE great to send with the kids as snacks!
Great job!

We loved this - omitted the sesame seeds and brushed butter on top just out of the oven and sprinkled with fairy dust (4 parts dry Parmesan cheese, 3 parts garlic powder, 2 parts onion powder, 1 part oregano).  Tasted just like the Olive Garden bread sticks.  A definite keeper.  Thank you!

These were very good! I didn't have powdered milk so I used a generous dollop of greek yogurt because I had already put the full amount of water in. Also, I don't have a bread maker. I like to do mine the old fashion way by combining the water yeast, and sugar first and let sit for a few minutes. Then I added the rest of the ingredients ( I melted the butter) and finally the flour. I let the dough do a double rise (quick 30 min rise in the bowl then a second rise after they were rolled into sticks). I added a Tbs. or so of garlic powder and some basil.  They were devoured!

I bake alot of bread recipes and have tried a few different bread stick recipes and these were so good. My kids loved them, we dipped them  in marinara sauce and my daughter must have eaten 6 of them. And when i asked them what they wanted for dessert they said they wanted more bread sticks. They told me to make these every night. I brushed them with parm cheese butter with garlic and oregano just before they were done. My kids had fun making different shapes with them.

These couldn't have been better. I halved the recipe but kept it the same otherwise. I threw the ingredients in my bread machine, took out the dough when it was done, rolled it out and cut the sticks with a pizza cutter, as someone else suggested. I twisted them lightly so they were prettier and let them rest for a few minutes before baking, but I don't know if that was necessary. I baked them for 10 minutes, taking them out just as the tops were starting to brown. They rose perfectly. Then, I brushed them with melted butter and sprinkled them with Parmesan cheese and garlic salt. They were so soft and delicious and were amazingly quick and easy to make! I know I'll be making them again frequently. Thanks, Paula for the keeper!

to make it healthier, i used 3 cups of whole wheat flour and 1 cup of breaf flour, added 2 tbsp of vital gluten.  instead of sesame seeds, i used italian seasoning (to reduce the calories.)  I don't have a bread machine, so I mixed the dough for 10 min in the mixer, rise for 1 hour, shape dough to breadstick, rise for another hour, then baked as directed.  I followed one of the reviewer's instruction to use egg white wash and sprinkled the breadsticks with sea salt.

Made these for a family event and they turned out great!  I don't have a bread maker so i put the water and yeast with a T of honey and let it get cloudy before adding the rest of the ingredients that had been blended together.  I let it rise for about 1-1 1/2 hrs covered and then rolled it out and cut it with a pizza cutter into small breadsticks (they doubled in the oven so make sure they're half the size you want).  I also added italian seasoning and some garlic powder to the mixture.  I topped it with tons of butter and garlic salt.  Next time i will baste every couple of minutes with butter to give it more flavor.  Awesome recipe!

These were so yummy.  I made a couple of small changes and I loved the results.  As another reviewer noted I dropped the sugar to 3 tbls. I also increased the butter by 1 tbls more.  I increased the yeast to 1 rounded tbls.  I added everything and then used a mixmaster to blend it with the first 2 cups flour for about five minutes.  I only added about 3.25 cups flour total and that was plenty.  The only other thing that I did was to melt .5 cups of butter with a little garlic powder and pour it into the bottom of my pan and then roll my breadsticks in it.  All in all my new favorite recipe.  Thanks so much!!!

I gave this recipe 4 stars, but it was darn near 5.  I used my KitchenAid and didn't double the recipe and not sure I understand the reasoning behind that.  I didn't have powdered milk, so I used warm milk.  I also decreased the sugar to a couple tablespoons (if that).  Instead of putting the sesame seeds in the dough, I brushed each with an egg wash and sprinkled the top with garlic salt and the sesame seeds.  The recipe wasn't clear about rising times if you didn't use a bread machine, so I let the dough rise until double in a bowl, then punched down, rolled out and used a pizza cutter to make my breadsticks. I just popped them in the oven without a second raise. The first batch was not browning as nice as I'd have liked, so on the second batch, I cranked up the oven to 400 degrees and they turned out MUCH NICER!  I baked them right on my pizza stone.  Will use this recipe again for pizza dough and my oven set a touch higher - maybe 425.  Good overall recipe though.  I like a crunchy outer texture and next time I will not butter when they are out of the oven.  Made them too soft.

Excellent basic bread stick recipe, very tasty. It's been added to my recipe box. For something a little different, I used California Style Garlic Salt w/Parsley instead of everyday salt, after the bread machine had mix a couple of minutes, I also added a tablespoon of Thyme and Oregano. As soon as the bread sticks came out of the over scooted all the bread sticks together and grated cheddar cheese over the top and then sprinkled well the parmesan cheese, it was to die for!

Love them! I baked them late, around 10:30pm just to test before making for thanksgiving and I couldn't stop eating them even thou I don't eat at night... Crispy on the outside and soft inside! Easily managing dough. I made them by hand. Didn't add any dry milk as I like to use natural stuff in my food and dry milk doesn't sound as from a cow... Anyways, I redused sugar, put only 3 tbsp. It took 15min in my oven. I will be making these again for Thanksgiving.

Absolutely wonderful!  I made the dough using a bread machine.  I love that once the bread machine is finished, the breadsticks go right into the oven--no waiting for another rise.  Whole family devoured these!  After they baked, I brushed w/ melted butter and sprinkled w/ parm. cheese.  YUM!

These were excellent!  I just added some italian seasoning, garlic and onion poweder.  Other than that, I followed the recipe. I did allow my dough sticks to rise for 2 hours. The dough was so easy to work with.  
    I also made cinnasticks with the same recipe and was able to make 2 batches out of one recipe.  I added cinnamon and vanilla to the bread dough and sprayed with cooking spray then, sprinkled cinnamon and sugar on top.

These were a little too sweet for my taste. That said, everything else was great! I think next time I'll scale back on the sugar. I'm not sure you would need the full amount of fat. I'll scale back on that, too, next time since I like to melt a stick of butter in the pan and roll them in it before rising the second time, then let them just cook in the rest. They come out with an amazing texture and taste!!!

Very good and easy. I used my bread machine on dough cycle. I used half wheat and half white flour, 3 T sugar, and added 1 T italian seasonings, and 1/2 t of garlic powder to the dough. Rolled into the 18 sticks just fine. Before putting in the oven to bake I brushed with 2 T melted butter and 2 T grated parmesan cheese.

easier, easier than you think! I used to buy them, never more from now on! my kids got a kick out of it, too, having to model these small ropes from the dough, straight from the bread machine! we put rosemary and onion flakes, they are a comparatively healthy appetizer or snack, better than chips anyway:-)

This recipe is so easy and amazing! It will make it look like you really do know ho to cook.
**I jazzed it up a bit by taking the cooked breadsticks and rolling them in butter or olive oil and then shaking them in a parmesean cheese and garlic powder mixture**

I tweaked the spices around to my family's liking but the basic recipe was great! I let the dough rest for 20 minutes before making the breadsticks. I then let the breadsticks rise for 30 minutes before baking and brushed with garlic butter. They turned out medium fluffy on the inside and chewy on the outside which is the way we like them. It's a keeper for us! Thank you!

After experimenting around a bit with this recipe, I found that they taste delicious if you add some grated cheddar cheese to the ingredients; just to give it a little cheesy flavouring. Or, iif you prefer just a bit of cheese, sprinkle cheese over breadsticks before you put them in the oven. I found they needed to be cooked longer than the set time. Also, so they don't burn underneath; use two baking trays.

I make a lot of bread. I thought these were a little heavy and a bit on the sweet side for breadsticks. I baked one pan at 375 and one at 400. The 375 batch did not brown nicely. At 400, they were browned but still soft.

I had to make bread sticks for a charity fund raiser for over 150 people.  This recipe worked great with my bread maker.  My bread sticks were supposed to be in the shape of a 1 so I rolled out the dough and used a cookie cutter.  I opted to not put sesame seeds in it and still tasted wonderful.  Thank you for the great recipe

These breadsticks tasted very similar to regular white rolls.  I added some garlic powder to the dough, and brushed on some melted garlic butter, and a sprinkling of parmesan cheese to the baked breadsticks.  They were great; the perfect accompaniment to Spaghetti and Meatballs.

Mixed the dough in the bread machine.  Baked half the rolls and refrigerated the other half of the dough for a later time.  Great bread sticks!!

This made some CRAZY good bread, if you get my drift. ;-)  I made the dough in the bread machine (without sesame seeds).  After I baked the breadsticks I brushed them with melted butter, then tossed them in a gallon size bag with a mixture of Parmesan cheese and Lawry's Garlic Salt. Very reminiscent of one of my favorite carryout treats!

Husband and son approved bread sticks! This recipe was so simple to make and the taste was wonderful.  I made as directed and placed on parchment paper to rise and bake.  Once they were removed from the oven, I brushed them with butter and sprinkled 'Prissy's Pizza Dust' from AR on them.  To reheat the next day, I wrapped in foil and placed in the oven at 350° for about 8 minutes.

Very good. And very easy. Husband and kids gobbled them up.  I brushed melted butter on top and then sprinkled parmasian cheese on top. Also, I didn't have dry milk powder so I used 1 cup milk and 1/3 water instead of the 1 1/3 cup water and they came out just as good. Will definitely make bar again!

I used my pizza dough recipe plus garlic. the machine dough was sticky when it came out of the dough cycle. 
they baked 20 min & were overdone (too crisp, lightly golden brown) - they looked too light to take out at 14-16 min. OK, but not great.

This is a really good bread stick recipe.  They taste awesome and my kids also love them!  Okay I love them as well.   Perfect to go with a meal or as a snack.   I don't add the sesame seeds though, although I do roll them or top them with cinnamon sugar if they are going to be a snack.  They are also yummy dipped into a maranara sauce which adds a veggie for a snack.  *grins*  Although we don't lack fruits and veggies consumption in our house.   

I do use a scale often in the kitchen so when I make these, I weigh the dough in grams and then divide that number by 18 servings.   Then weigh out the dough before forming each bread stick.  This way they are uniform in size but they also bake more evenly as well.  But I'm not left with an odd amount of dough in the end.   A little over the top for this extra step but it's really worth the effort. 

I highly recommend this recipe, we have made it multiple times and I've promised the kids I'd make it today again....  

~enjoy~

Made these for the first time today. Used half bread flour, half whole wheat.  Brushed melted butter, garlic powder and parmesean cheese before putting in the oven to bake. Came out perfect. Tastes great !!

This was an on-the-fly grab for me while I was preparing stuffed shells for dinner one night. I don't own a bread machine, so I used my stand mixer w/ dough hook. Apart from too much sugar, which I reduced to just 1 T. (just our preference), these were just the best ever with such good texture! I added the recipe to my regularly used file. Thanks very much for a "keeper" recipe!

These were really good. I twisted some, and tied others into knots. Then I topped them with sausage and garlic. They were great with some marinara on the side. I reserved some dough to make cinnamon twists with, and my daughter loved them. Thanks for a yummy and easy to follow recipe!

Great breadstick!  I used my bread machine.  They came out soft.  We loved the sesame seeds in there and the sugar definitely gave them a sweeter taste.  After baking, I removed and added shredded mozz and ched cheese and put back in the oven until the cheese had melted...gone in minutes!  Thanks Paula!

This recipe turned out amazing the first time I tried it. I followed the advice of others and used 4 tbsp. of butter instead of 3, and decreased the sugar from 1/4 cup to 4 tbsp. I sprinkled the top of the breadsticks with salt and garlic powder just prior to baking as well. Delicious!

I have made these 2 days in a row.  They are incredibly easy and very tasty.  There are endless options of spices you can use to adjust the flavor to suit the tastes of your family.  I do find that the cooking time to get them brown & crusty on the outside and soft on the inside is much longer than the suggested 10-12 minutes.  It is more like 20 in my oven and that is basting them with a garlic butter about 1/2 way through baking.  When my daughter can do quick breads for 4-H, I am certain she will present this as one of her projects.  Thanks for the resume.

These are absolutely wonderful breadsticks.  I did let them rise a little too long so they were huge, but nonetheless they were perfect.  I was a bit skeptical about being bland, but the sesame seeds add just the right touch.  This is now going to be my go-to breadstick recipe.

These were just what I was looking for, nice and crunchy on the outside, but soft inside.  Made one batch plain (Not as fond of these).  The best tasting was to add Italian herbs, Garlic and olive oil together in a dish and then brush over the top of the sticks before putting in the oven.  Also to make them crisp I sprayed the sticks in the oven twice within the first 5 minutes of cooking with water.  Will certainly be making these Italian herb bread sticks again!

I can make tasty biscuits and cornbread. I can make popovers that pot right through the roof. But I've never been able to make decent rolls despite trying dozens of recipes, some that seem to work perfectly for other people. These bread sticks are a wonderful substitute, and as an earlier reviewer noted, they reheat beautifully after freezing (15 minutes in foil at 350).

These came out pretty good.  I had a hard time rolling them, so they werent very pretty!  I omited the sesame seeds, and I brushed garlic butter on them before baking.  I will make these again, and I will experiment with adding different herbs too.

Not great, just OK. They're kind of flavorless (so I recommend dumping some herbs into the dough) and definitely not as tasty after a day or so. Great right out of the oven though.

Mine stayed soft all over. Made them twice, both times I got the same result. Not going to save this one. Sorry!

This was truly delicious! I dont have a bread maker so I got some quick rising yeast and combined all ingredients-(ALWAYS put the yeast and water first, then combine all ingredients in a bowl.) Then after I combined and had a big ball of dough, I put coconut oil in a bowl and let it rise for 20 minutes in a warm oven. (Remember I dont have a bread maker) 

After 20 minutes, I ripped pieces of dough and rolled it out into long strips and sprayed pam onto a pan. I had to let my bread sticks cook for about 20-25 minutes because of the amount of dough that I used for each one(Thats the only reason why I gave this recipe 4 stars instead of 5.). It almost came out like individual loafs.(Who cares how they looked, they were great!!) But I took garlic powder and melted butter, mixed it together and topped on the bread. Then I sprinkled some parmesian cheese onto it. Man this was great. My family wants me to make this again! Thanks Paula!!

YUMMY!!!

These are so good and so easy. I left out the sesame seeds. When they came out of the oven I brushed them with melted butter and sprinkled them with garlic powder and parmesan cheese. Yum!

These little bread sticks are great, so easy.  I used olive oil instead of butter and skim milk instead of water as I didn't have any dried milk.  I look forward to making these again.

Great recipe, I simply added garlic powder on top of the breadsticks BEFORE putting them into the oven...Heavenly.  My son even said to hide these before Dad came back from work because he would eat them all!!

Wow! I cannot say enough about these. Doubled the recipe. I proofed the yeast with a little honey- about 1/2 tsp and the water. I did follow the other reviewers and didn't use the powdered milk, but added water and milk. I also cut the sugar in half.  Used my kitchenaide mixer but finished kneading by hand, adding garlic powder and Italian seasoning at this time. I rolled them out, and then cut them and twisted them a bit. Gave them a quick rise. Then baked at 400 for 8-10 minutes. They came out with a crispy crust without even having to spray them or use steam in the oven!  These are going on my Thanksgiving menu! Thanks for the recipe!

We had these with spaghetti and they were very good!! I used liquid milk instead of dry, I didn't warm it. I also used olive oil in place of butter and added 1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese, 2/3 tsp. onion powder, 1 rounded tsp. garlic powder, 2 pinches of sage, and some oregano sprinkled in as well to the dough mix before starting up the bread machine. I also used olive oil to coat a portion of the table (spread with a folded paper towel) to roll dough pieces out. After laying them on the sprayed cookie sheets, I  brushed the tops of them with melted Blue Bonnet margarine (didn't have butter but this worked out fine) and then sprinkled grated parmesan cheese on them and placed in oven. Right after the breadsticks came out of the oven,I used one end of a margarine stick to swipe the tops of them once more and served. One of my daughters told me they tasted like Little Ceasars breadsticks, and everyone loved them!

These were amazing. I followed the recipe exactly but without a bread machine. I divided the dough into 16 parts. For 2 of the parts, I flattened them into rounds & stuffed them with cooked ground beef& onions & some mozzarella cheese (I only did 2 as a trial) they turned out great. Half way through baking, I brushed the top with a mixture of butter, olive oil & garlic herb mix.
It would probably work great with any stuffing sort of like a calzone!!

These did come together well; but I followed the recipe without editing and find these to be too sweet and not terribly interesting. Maybe best with the cinnamon/sugar others mention? I think the sugar could be lessened without altering the chemistry and I'm going to try that if I make them again.

Awesome!  I did put in a little Italian seasoning, both in the bread machine, and on top of them prior to going in the oven (with a little parmesean too)!  Also used them to make the Cornucopia on this site, instead of using store dough...so good and crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.  The sesame seeds really make it!

My kids really enjoyed this recipe.  I proofed the yeast with a little sugar and water first.  I don't have a bread machine (not a lot of bread made in my house), so I used a stand up mixer and just let the dough rise on the counter.  Thanks for this recipe.

Very good. A little tough but that could be that I may have rolled it out a bit much. Much more dense than the kids are used to. I put a garlic butter spread on them 1/2 way through. No seeds.

I ended up making 2 batches of these last weekend. The first I made as written and the second time I added garlic powder and italian seasoning. Delicious either way and good both with soup and dipped in a variety of dips. Thanks Paula

My husband and I both enjoyed this recipe.  Instead of sesame seeds we used a bit of minced garlic and it was delicious!  This recipe can easily be adapted for non-bread machine users.

These are, by far, the best breadsticks I've ever had. I did not have powdered milk, so I subbed milk for the water. I didn't have any sesame seeds, so I left them out. When the dough came out of the bread machine, I rolled it out into a rectangle and used a pizza cutter to cut into sticks. When they had just a couple of minutes of baking time left, I took them out and brushed them with melted garlic butter, topped with some cheese and put them back into the oven.  These are absolutely divine.

I'll definitely use this recipe again.  I used olive oil in place of butter, and 2 cups all purpose flour plus 2 cups stone ground whole wheat flour in place of 4 cups bread flour.  My bread sticks were soft--just the way I wanted them.  Perfect with soup.

I was looking for a recipe like one I made in home-ec - and easy for my daughter(8) to make mostly on her own. These were perfect and YUMMY! I added garlic and parmesan as a topping and we will make these again!

These were great!  I didn't have sesame seeds, but it worked out just fine.  I brushed the tops with olive oil and chopped garlic and a little kosher salt before baking - then with oil again once finished.  Served with chicken wings and cobb salad - was fantastic!!

These are really good and simple.  I had to make some substitutions for my dairy allergic son.  I used "Dairy Free" which is a powered (dry) milk substitute and olive oil instead of the butter.  I also added some italian seasoning and garlic powder.  I used the bread machine dough cycle and an hour and half later it was ready to be shaped and baked.  Mine turned out  nice and crispy on the outside and just the right amount of chewy in the middle.  Tasted like a pizza crust to us.  A definite keeper!

I loved that I could make the dough in the bread machine.  I had never tried that before.  The sticks themselves were a bit bland.

This is the first recipe I have used in my attempt to make bread sticks. We absolutely love it! I like to make them a little thicker & shorter, but I am sure any way you roll them out, they are delicious. for the topping, I only mix parmesan cheese with melted butter & then I brush the mix on top before I cook them. I also brush the mix on top after I take them out of the oven. So yummy!

I enjoyed this recipe although it was not what I was looking for originally. I took the advice of some other people and cut back the sugar and add garlic salt...I think next time I will leave the garlic salt out and I will do it on the outside, Good recipe however...my boyfriend wanted more!!

My first time ever making breadsticks and I was VERY pleased!!!  I did cut back on the sugar to 1/8 cup or 2 TBS. and didn't use the dry milk.  I melted the butter and added it to the rest of the ingredients.  I don't have a bread machine, so I did it all by hand.  The kids loved helping.  You DEFINATELY need to have your oven at 400 to get them brown!  Thanks for our new recipe we will be using for who knows how long.  I am going to try something with the leftovers at breakfast tomorrow.  Maybe with icing and a cinnamon sugar.

It's not a phenomenal recipe, it's okay as a base. A little too sweet for me. If I make this again I'll cut the sugar down and make sure to do an egg wash on the top. They look extremely bland and unappetizing without it. I even topped them with garlic, fresh grated Romano cheese and oregano. This recipe could be much better with a bit of tweaking.

Good soft breadsticks.  Need a dipping sauce though, a bit bland to stand alone.

I didn't bother with cutting them individually. I patted the bread onto a cookie sheet, cut them as best I could with a pizza wheel, brushed with garlic butter and baked.  YUM!

I just thought these were okay. I tried them a few different ways: substituting a bit of wheat flour and also tried some with cheese sticks in them. I'll keep looking for another recipe though.

I agree with a lot of the other reviewers--they taste like long, skinny dinner rolls.  They weren't bad, just not what I was hoping for.  I didn't do sesame seeds; I put melted butter and garlic powder on top.

Fabulous! My kids love these and they are really easy. We melted butter and added 1 Tbsp. of minced garlic to the butter, then basted the bread sticks before baking and then again halfway through. Very good!

These were good. I did what a previous reviewer did and cut the bread into strips with a pizza cutter. Next time I will brush with butter and dust with parmesan cheese when they come out of the oven.

This was mediocre. I made no substitutions in the recipe and followed it to a tee.  The resulting breadsticks were dense and a little bland.  This was easy to prepare,  I'll give it that.  Not sure if I'd make this again, and if I do I will be tinkering with it.

I don't have a bread maker so I used my KA with the bread hook. I cut the sugar back to 1 tsp, I'm not fond of sweet bread, and I used garlic and parm instead of the sesame seeds to go along with a pasta dish. They were a little pale so I put them under the broiler for a few minutes. Thanks for sharing.

Delicious! I used less sugar (just a couple pinches to feed the yeast); almond milk; bread flour (just because); no seeds; added some onion and garlic powder to wet dough. I definitely will make these every time I want breadsticks!

Made exactly and they were great! I did take one tray and sprinkle on some onion powder, but they don't need anything to go great as bread sticks! Mine were all done at 12 minutes. I enjoyed the texture of the added sesame seeds. Will make again!

Made as directed. Loved the ease of the bread machine! Followed another reviewer's suggestion of rolling the dough out into a rectangle.  I brushed the rolled out dough with melted butter, sprinkled it with garlic salt and parmesan and  then, using a pizza cutter,  cut the dough into strips  before transferring them to a parchment-lined pan. I brushed them with a tiny bit more butter when they came out of the oven, and they were phenomenal!!!  The only unfortunate thing was that  they disappeared so fast!! :)

I've made this recipe as it is written a few times (minus the sesame seeds and add a little garlic powder).  We've loved them every time. Soft, chewy, delicious, and easy to make!

Great recipe!  I followed it exactly, except I did not have any sesame seeds.  It was quick and easy, and the dough was a dream to work with.  Everyone loved them.  Next time, I will make them into garlic bread sticks to serve with pasta :)  Thanks Paula!

I made the dough using the recipe but instead of bread sticks I made hotdog buns by  rolling the dough out a little larger and placing them close together on the baking sheet. They came out great!! I will make these again.

Delicious!  I used the bread machine and added some garlic to the dough.  I also substituted honey for the sugar.   Before  baking I brushed with a butter/garlic salt mixture.  My kids say they tasted just like Olive Garden breadsticks.   Definitely a keeper!

I didn't completely follow the recipe but they were a hit. I didn't have dry milk powder so I subbed 1 1/3 cup 2% milk for the warm water and left out the powder. I also didn't have sesame seeds so I used some Italian seasoning, garlic, and onion powder to "spice" it up.

I'm in love with this recipe!!! I've made breadsticks, buns, and loaves out of it. Love its consistency. Not too wet, not too dry. Think I'll throw away all my other dough recipes. Can't wait to try it as pizza!!

This is a really easy basic bread stick recipe that is very customizable. I've made these as written, as cinna-stix, and with mozzarella cheese in the middle. All ways are delicious!

after changing this recipe it is now Awesome. I only gave this recipe 3 stars because of the alterations. First leave out the sesame seeds then I add a half envelope dry italian salad dressing and 1 to 2 diced garlic cloves to the bread machine. Bake according to directions. when done baste with melted butter and sprinkle with plenty of parmesean cheese. With these changes its a 5 star recipe.

I've made these twice.  Once exactly as stated, and the other time using 2/3 cup water and 2/3 cup milk, due to being out of powdered milk.  The 2nd time I also added 1 tsp. garlic granules to the dough and brushed the baked bread sticks with oil and sprinkled with grated Parmesan cheese.  They were great both ways, although the sesame seeds were kind of lost in the dough... I think they'd be better sprinkled on top of the bread sticks.

These were pretty good but I didn't have a bread maker so I had to wing it with letting the dough rise and kneading it on my own.  I couldn't get them to brown, either.  I did add italian seasoning and garlic, and then some garlic butter on top for the last few minutes of baking.  It took a lot longer than 15 minutes to cook, as well.  But they were pretty tasty and all of those issues may just be related to the way I made them, so in the end so I give them 4 stars!

I'm sure these are good as the recipe is written.  I used wheat bread and some garlic powder in them (that some people recommended).  We hated the sweet bread with a garlic taste.  Threw them away.  I hope to make the "as written" recipe soon.

Very yummy. Only complaint is that they came out a little chewy. Not as light and fluffy as I wouldve wanted. BUT they still tasted great. I brushed some melted butter with garlic on them too.

I agree with some of the other posters that these bread sticks have the potential to taste just like regular, skinny dinner rolls.  The trick is to make them really long and skinny . . . they're not going to taste like Olive Garden fluffy bread sticks, but they will get that perfect crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside Italian bread stick texture.

Very good recipe! I twisted mine, made about 12 instead of 18, and I used egg wash after 12 minutes of baking (needed to bake for 18 minutes, because I made them bigger than the original recipe).

They are chewy and WONDERFUL. They have a soft pretzel type texture. Wonderful with your favorite pasta! This recipe will get heavy rotation!!!

Despite all the good reviews, I thought this recipe wasn't very good at all. I followed some other people's advice and added more garlic and spices to the dough and omitted the sesame seeds. It was dense, bland, and slightly chewy. Everyone thought the texture was pretty bad. They were also too sweet. I would suggest either not using this recipe or finding a way to make it less rubbery.

My kids loved them just as they were but my husband and I found them a bit bland.  They had cooled off a bit before I poked a few holes in them and brushed them with a garlic salt and butter mixture followed by shaking on some parmesan cheese.  I then put them back in the oven under the broiler until they browned lightly on top.  I was quite liberal when brushing on the butter mixture and would even put a bit more on after I pulled them out from under the broiler.  4 stars only because it wasn't a "fantastic as is" recipe.

I used the stand mixer method and it didnt come out good for me. Im sure I must have did something wrong and I may try it again in the future. the only thing different I did was used regular flour instead of bread flour.

Excellent! My family & three young kids loved these breadsticks.  I made them two days in a row and each day the entire recipe was devoured. Highly recommended!

Did not turn out well. No flavor. Might try again and add garlic, basil and oregano.

These were pretty good.  I made them for a dinner party - to go along with the lasagna.  I may experiment with more melted butter, and different herbs sprinkled on top.  This time, I just stuck to parmesan cheese.  I'll make these again - thanks!

My breadmaker is broken, so I made these by hand.  It took a while, but with the proper equipment, I'm sure it is well worth the time.  I made some with garlic and parmesan, at the suggestion of another review, and think that made them better than they would have been, just plain.  Best hot out of the oven - they're not so good when cooled off.

These didn't turn out so great for me, but then I never seem to have any luck with yeast bread recipes.  They came out heavy and doughy.  What am I doing wrong?
