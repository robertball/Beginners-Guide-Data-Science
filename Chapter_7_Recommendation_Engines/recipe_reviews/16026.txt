This punch is a family tradition and everyone in my hometown uses it for bridal showers, baby showers and weddings! The sherbert can be changed to different flavors according to your taste, or the color you wish to achieve. However, I've never added ice cubes to this punch. Keeping some of the sherbert frozen keeps it cold and ice would water it down (unless you used frozen pineapple juice cubes). It's a delicious punch!!

This punch does not look appealing but it is my favorite. My mom has made it for every function in my life and I never get tired of it.

Great party punch... I added a handle of Vodka to it.  Needless to say, was a big hit.

Super easy and tasty.  The store was out of lime sherbet so I had to substitute raspberry.  It was good, but I personally prefer lime.  I didn't use the ice cubes.  I did pop the juice and ginger ale into the freezer about an hour before I made the punch.  It kept well for a long party--about 3 hours.

Yummy! I was worried about not adding something red to this punch but it was definitely a keeper!

The flavor of this was good, but the way it looks after settling is pretty strange. The mixture separates. Mine did not look like the photo. Like I said, good taste, poor appearance. People said it looked like punch that belonged at a Halloween party.

I made this for a wedding shower and it was an overall hit.  I think the only people who didn't like it just didn't like lime flavored beverages.  I forgot to put in the ice cubes but my sherbet was still mostly frozen when I added it, and it stayed cold through the whole shower.  I'll be making this recipe again.  Thanks!

Made this for a friend's baby shower and loved it. Substituted the ice cubes for vanilla ice cream - the entire bowl was gone in no time.
