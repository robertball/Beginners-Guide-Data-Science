Tried this today, and I did not change anything.  My husband gave it a 10 our of 10.  The weather was not great for making it--90 degrees, but it was worth it.

My daughter made this for the family for Easter dinner.  I had planned the menu, but was admitted to the hospital on Good Friday, so couldn't do the cooking. DD made a couple of fatal mistakes the first time around, so had to make a second batch.  They brought dinner to my hospital room.  Although the taste was wonderful, this dessert was a little too sweet for my taste.  The rest of the family (fourteen of them) loved it.

Delicious!   I made a graham cracker crumb crust instead of the flour-based crust. 

Graham cracker crust:  2-1/2 c graham cracker crumbs, 1/2 c sugar, 1/2 c just-melted butter. Combine graham cracker crumbs and sugar in a bowl.  Add melted butter and mix with fork.  Transfer to 9x13 pan, spread out and press down gently with a spatula. Bake at 375 for 10 minutes.)

Friends enjoyed this dessert and asked for the recipe.  I would definitely make it again.

Absolutely delicious. It took me forever to make it, partly because I had to run around town looking for neighbors' rhubarb to borrow, but it's well worth it. I won 'best desert' at a rhubarb festival with this recipe a few years ago!

I don't like rhubarb. Never have. But this is seriously the best dessert I have ever made, and I've made a lot of desserts. I did find that I had to cook it much longer than the recipe states until it looked like it was bubbling and starting to set. From then on, absolutely fabulous!

I have made this many times! Absolutely the best thing to do with rhubarb. Other than the numerous times I have made it using the original recipe, I have also used whole wheat and or almond flour, or a combination of all three (whatever I have on hand) for the bottom crust. The sugar in the bottom crust as well can be light brown, dark brown or white. A sprinkle of cinnamon or nutmeg also adds something to the flavor.  A little bit of vanilla and nutmeg spices up the custard and the flavoring for the meringue can be whatever you like. my personal favorites are almond or strawberry.

I just made this dessert tonight and it isn't the first time making it. couldn't wait for the rhubarb to ripen so I could make this again. we absolutley love it!
just the perfect balance between sweet and tangy.
I will for sure be making it a few times this summer!

excellent. the filling was a little bit too sweet for my taste, but still, wonderful. the filling caramelized at the edges , the strawberries really improved the overall dish (usually they just dilute the rhubarb) - one of the best rhubarb desserts i've ever made.
