Excellent basic cheese lasagna recipe that can be tailored very easily for family preferences.
Suggestions/changes I made:
--Increase the spaghetti sauce to 64 oz to have enough to pour-over.
--I've had really good luck with Barilla's no-cook lasagna noodles. These completely avoid precooking the pasta and handling hot noodles.
--Based on the amount of noodles I have, I do a slightly different layering sequence which adds more volume. [the amount of ricotta mixture still works I just use 1/3 of it for each layer instead of half.
--Greasing the foil is a great reminder - hate to lose the cheese on top!

My family loved this recipe, I made my own sauce and put in about 42 oz of sauce insted of the 32 oz so that it was not dry.  Will make again!!

Way too much cheese. Way too much egg.  Not nearly enough sauce.

this was good, but next time i will only use 3 eggs and less lasagna noodles since i didn't end up using the entire 16 oz package. make sure you season the ricotta/egg/parmesan mixture well with salt and pepper - this may be why some had a "bland" result. also,

Divided all recipe ingredients in half to fit in 8x8 dish.  Added more mozarella to ricotta layers and added Italian seasoning and red pepper flakes.  Also, added more sauce.  Nice ricotta/cheese flavor good for people who like cheese. Delicious, and fast to make! Big hit with hubbie.

Sauteing the garlic in olive oil to flavor jarred sauce is brilliant! What a great tip to incorporate into other dishes. This recipe made a great tasting lasagna.

Good recipe, but like other reviewers, I found it dry.  Definitely add more sauce!  I served it with minced fresh parsley sprinkled over the top, and it added a nice touch.

I'm a vegetarian and have had a lot of trouble finding a meatless lasagna recipe that I liked (the veggie ones aren't really that good, in my opinion). This one definitely won my heart, perfect in every way, and I was able to freeze the leftovers so I could use them as lunch for work. Awesome recipe!

Wayyyy too much cheese. I cut the recipe in half and I had enough cheese to do the full recipe with the whole box of noodles! I had a lot of sauce left and it seemed more like a soup with noodles layered in it than lasagna. I used 1 egg instead of 2 (1/2 recipe) and that seemed to work. Didn't eat it yet but we'll see how it tastes.

Great recipe!  I didn't have quite enough ricotta cheese so I threw a little cream cheese in there; also, didn't quite have enough mozzarella so threw some Parmesan in there as well.  Then, as I was about to put it in the oven I realized I forgot the Italian seasoning so I just sprinkled some on top.  I definitely, definitely want to try adding spinach next time.  As some other reviewers alluded to I think you could do with using slightly less noodles and slightly more cheese and sauce.  Thank you for the great recipe!

Made this last night for a dinner party.  Everyone liked it a lot. I used egg replacer (e.g. Ener-G) instead of eggs, and used the equivalent of around 2 eggs after reading other reviews. Everything else I followed, using a bit more sauce. Easy recipe, good results, I would make it again!

Sooooo yummy! I didnt have fresh parmesan on hand so I had to use store bought grated. I also added spinach to the cheese, and only used 3 eggs. Loved it last night, and had it again for breakfast!!

I've made this one quite a few times now.  Its amazing!  I use the no boil noodles and cut down the ricotta to about 3 cups instead of 4 because DH seemed to think that 4C was just a little bit too much.  All in all, we love it, and eat it quite often.

Made this last week and everyone loved it.  I added spinach to a batch and extra sauce and garlic.  It was too good.  And, I also used a new dried tomato/basil shredded cheese that our grocery store is offering.  It was delish!  Keep the wonderful recipes coming.

over all it was a good recipe to go by if you have no clue where to start but some adjustments should be made.. a whole pack of lasagna wasn't even needed i had to end up making 2 lasagnas and i used more sauce than the recipe called for because dry lasagnas aren't tasty (about 35oz).. also i used whole wheat pasta and skim ricotta and on the top layer i threw in some chicken.. my husband loved it didn't even know it was good for him! :).. also if you eat it right when it comes out of the oven it doesn't taste as good as the next day straight out of the fridge and into the microwave (out of the oven it's too hot.. the cheese and sauce were watery) but the next day it was fine not watery at all

Definitely needs more sauce.  Everyone said it was too dry.  Otherwise, delicious.  I'm making more sauce to put over it.

Sorry, but I need a little more flavor!  I used 3 c. ricotta cheese, 1/4 c. dried parsley, and 3 eggs.  I also included 1 layer of sliced sharp cheddar cheese to increase the flavor.  Other than that, I followed this recipe.  Thanks Molson7 for a tasty recipe!

Loved the lasagna. This is a fast and simple recipe to follow. The only change I made was I added a spinach mixed with ricotta layer. Delicious!

This is a great recipe. It is good for someone picky, like myself and my husband, who like it simple. instead of using a jar of spaghetti sauce, we use 16 oz plain tomoato sauce and 16 oz tomato paste, and season it ourselves. We also use whole wheat lasagna noodles. comes out great!

This was a great recipe but I changed several things. I used cottage cheese instead of ricotta and only 3 eggs instead of 4. When mixing the cheese and eggs I added in a bag of mozzarella cheese to it to get the extra cheesey flavor throughout the dish (otherwise it would not have been cheesey at all). Also, on top I added some mild cheddar cheese as well to make it look more like lasagna. With those changes it came out fantastic. - Thanks for the recipe.

Perfect quick lasagna recipe. Second time I made it I browned a pound of ground beef in saucepan before adding sauce - and the sauce I use (whole foods marinara sauce) had just the right amount of seasonings, so I didn't need the Italian seasoning. I also used whole wheat noodles once and it was still very good. Great, easy homemade lasagna.

I used only one egg, added some mozarella to the layers, and cooked it with the foil off for the last 15 minutes.  Also, I used no-boil noodles, so I added a some more sauce.  Its easy and delicious!

This recipe is simple and adaptable. You can add whatever you happen to have on hand. I have gotten rave reviews when I make this for company even if I haven't done anything special like making my own sauce or adding meat and veggies. This is a great dish to sneak in food that your kids normally don't eat. Add some fresh spinach to the sauce and if it is cut small they don't even notice. I've also added VERY finely chopped broccoli.

This was an easy recipe to make and my husband and I really enjoyed it. I used cottage cheese instead of ricotta and used about half the amount called for. I also didn't need an entire 16oz package of lasagna noodles. This will be my basic lasagna recipe from now on.

REALLY enjoyed this recipe...simple; you probably won't need the directions the second time around. I only used 2 eggs, and sprinkled some crushed-chili flakes in the sauce for a kick. Easy and delicious! My finicky fella - who almost hates pasta - just loved it!

It didn't come out too well for me.  Perhaps not enough seasoning or the right sauce?  I felt 4 eggs was a bit much and could definitely taste them in the ricotta mixture once I tasted the lasagna.  The recipe has value however, but needs to be modified.

Halved the recipe because I had an 8x8 pan and only used one egg, which was fine - this recipe does call for too many eggs.  Good otherwise!  I added a little garlic salt because I didn't have minced garlic and crushed red pepper per other members' recommendations.  It was very good!  My fiance cleaned his plate in about 2 minutes!

This just did not work for me. I used 2 28 ounce jars of sauce, and it was still dry. I added spinach to the ricotta, but it was just too much cheese. It was better the next day,but I still would not make again. I just can't place why it was so bland. Maybe with fresh herbs it would improve?

We liked this very much. I used 6 fresh egg noodles, fewer eggs (3)and fresh spinach. We also used a meat sauce from Trader Joes, but it would have been good with plain sauce, too. My husband likes meat.

I personally did not like this lasagna and neither did my mother.  My husband however ate it for dinner the rest of the week.  I did not like the eggs in it.  I am a vegetarian and don't eat eggs by themselves and the eggs in the lasagna looked and tasted like scrambled eggs.

As others commented, it did need more sauce. Fortunately, I had a half jar in the fridge. My kids liked it.

Something was missing, but I couldn't put my finger on what. The recipe is super easy and everyone said it was delicious, maybe it was just the sauce I used.

I did change some things. I didn't use a full box of lasagna because it wasn't necessary.  It was the first time I had ever made lasagna, so I didn't know exactly how many noodles I would need, so cooked the whole box. They were whole wheat noodles.  Used 2% milk mozarella cheese and low fat ricotta cheese. Used chunky tomato pasts sauce. Could have used a little more than 32 oz., at least in my opinion. But the in-laws went back for more. They couldn't believe it was the first time I ever made lasagna.

this was PERFECT for what i wanted! i am not a fan of lasagna with meat in it. i did use only three eggs (thats all i had!) and i added spinanch but it still was soooooo yummy! great for vegetarians in the world too as you really can alter it to your specs and it will be all good.

I only use two eggs and add a tsp or two of dried basil to the ricotta cheese mix.  Sometimes I also add 1/2 Cup of six blend Italian cheese by Sargento and 2 cups of blanched baby spinach to it.  I always use homemade spaghetti sauce.

I admit that I did not really follow the recipe but I used the main ideas. Cheese, noodles, eggs, sauce, ect. I added spinach and it turned out wonderful. I used Newman's Own spaghetti sauce which gave it a wonderful flavor. Delicious!

Not enough cheese for us we added 6 cups of ricotta instead of 4 and added an extra egg yolk and a little spinach. We used whole grain lasagna and only made it 2 layers because we wanted it to be like stuffed shells/manicotti. We never use jar sauce because of the corn syrup and other junk. We used San Marzano tomatoes and tomato paste with spices (garlic, onion, dried basil, oregano and crushed red pepper), to make Marinara sauce.

I scaled this down to 1/4 of the recipe and made it in an 8x8 pan. I used the precooked lasagna noodles and made into three layers. I also added a little mozzarella cheese on top of the ricotta mixture (to which I added some garlic powder). I used the jarred sauce without adding anything else to it. I covered with the pan foil and baked at 350 deg F for about 30 minutes, removed the foil and baked for another 10 min. Very good and easy!

Delicious.  I found the ricotta layer too dominant and will make 2/3 of that layer next time (although my husband loved it with heavy ricotta). A+.

This is a good recipe. We made our own sauce, added Italian herbs and a 6-cheese mix to the ricotta mix. We also only needed two eggs. And we used extra cheese on every layer. Yummy! Everybody loved it.

Followed the recipe.  It was very easy, but it was too bland for my taste.  If I make it again, I'd have to add more Italian seasoning or saute mushrooms or something to give it more depth.

It's ok, but not amazing. The ricotta bechamel sauce in this recipe is overpowering. I used only 2 of the 4 eggs called for & the lasagna was still way too strong on ricotta & egg flavor. I added extra parmesan & mozzarella to help balance out the bechamel as the bechamel seemed really thick & worrisome, but those cheeses couldn't compete with the amount of ricotta involved. I heard other people say the sauce needed to be increased so I increased it dramatically but it was still not enough sauce. This recipe is great for teaching the basics of lasagna, and the end result was still ok, but it wasn't the astoundingly fantastic experience that lasagna can be.  Thank you for a good starting point!

Followed the recipe to a "T" - and it was not so good.  Very bland.  It needed WAY more sauce.  Why does it call for a WHOLE BOX (16 oz) of noodles?  I didn't know what to do with them all - so I doubled them up.  It turned out tasteless.  I was so sad.

Came out great! We bought our noodles in bulk, though, and 16 ounces seemed like... a lot... and it was about twice as much as we needed. If you have a 9x13 pan, and the noodles are standard size lasagna noodles, then you'll only need to cook 9 of them (maybe 1 or 2 extra, in case one tears) to make the noodle layers.

Crowd pleaser. Made the following adjustments: extra sauce, 3 eggs instead of 4, added an additional 1/2 tsp. Italian seasoning to the ricotta and added 1/4 cup shredded Parmesan to the mozzarella. Baked an additional 10 mins with foil off until cheese became golden on top.

Sort of DRY. Definitely needs more sauce. Next time I will mix in the mozzarella with the cheese mixture, too.

I added sautéed portobello mushrooms.. Extra fresh garlic.. One tip.. The more layers the better in my book.. Added fresh sliced mozzarella and used probably twice as much shred and made an extra layer.. For the meat lovers in my family, I mixed sauce with browned beef and added a layer of that on part for their extra layer. I’ve made this recipe probably a dozen times now and it keeps getting better..

I have used this recipe several times so far, each time it turns out just as good.  Excellent all around.

By far my best attempt at cheese lasagna. I did take others advice and used 3 eggs instead of 4. I added fresh basil and parsley in the ricotta mix. Big hit in our family!

I have made a similar dish for yrs from a handed down recipe in my family. You do not have to boil the noodles ( just use the regular noodles)  layer as usual, mix 1/2 cup water with sauce left in jar, prior to baking pour around edges of dish, cover tightly w foil , when done let stand w/ o uncovering. Then just serve as usual. 
(I usually mix 1 thawed, squeezed, pkg of frozen chopped spinach to the ricotta mixture). Can also be made w meat in the sauce.

Delicious! I added vegetarian sausage, black olives and 50 oz of sauce. I will definitely make this again!

I followed the recipe exactly, and it came out great. Hubby loved it, too. The only change I made was that I used lowfat ricotta instead of full-fat, and I took the foil off after 40 minutes, and set the oven to broil for 5 minutes to brown the top.

I have made this twice. Once it was perfect and once it was a watery mess - followed recipe each time. I think it would help to uncover it a bit during cooking time? Possibly cook a little longer and definitely let it sit awhile after cooking to soak up juices before cutting.

This was FANTASTIC! But I did chance a couple things in it.. I made it on a week night and want something practice. 
For the sauce I used a jar of ready tomato "olive oil and garlic" flavored. 
In the ricotta mix I used same cheeses but for taste I used black pepper, a pinch of salt and my (current favorite) Johnny's Parmesan & Garlic seasoning... No regrets! Will be making again soon

Loved this lasagna! I made homemade sauce instead of using sauce out of a jar and I mixed a cup of mozzarella cheese in with the ricotta mixture too.  I had extra sauce on hand for the family to put on their pieces if they wanted too. So Yummy!! This recipe is replacing my other one for sure!

Based on the reviews, I only used one egg in the ricotta cheese. I added a can of Marzano tomatoes with basil to the marinara sauce and used about twice the amount called for in the recipe. Came out really good.

As others have said, too much ricotta & not enough sauce. I made it as is (added ground beef) and I will add more sauce (2 jars, not one) and maybe 3 c ricotta & 3 eggs next time. A good base recipe & I'm a beginner :)

Easy and  delicious.  Make sure you really like the sauce you use since that is where most the  flavor comes from.  I used Mid's, it's excellent.   Also, I halved the recipe.

Made this with my own homemade sauce, which i thought elevated the flavors of the dish. Delicious. I used dried Italian herbs, oregano, and parsely. I added some dried herbs to the ricotta as well. To top of the lasagna, I added Parmesan and Italian bread crumbs along with the mozzarella for crunch.

Delicious! I used ready to bake noodles, added fresh chopped spinach, a little cottage cheese in the low fat ricotta mixture along with red pepper flakes and oregano.

My family and friends love this recipe.  I had to stop my son after the third piece.  The only thing I do different is add a layer of sliced provolone in the middle.
