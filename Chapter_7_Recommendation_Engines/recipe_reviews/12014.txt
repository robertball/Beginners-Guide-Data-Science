I only used a cup of chopped turkey pepperoni (trying to stretch what I had on hand) and instead of green pepper, I used 2 red peppers.
I did add one large chopped zucchini and for the dressing, I made homemade--Nonna's Tuscan Salad Dressing, also from this site (one recipe of her salad dressing was the perfect amount for this tossed salad). I was able to stretch this side dish and add in fresh, organic produce which was a huge bonus for me. Summer or not, it was quick and easy and was the perfect side for seasoned pork chops.

Rather different using spaghetti.  Pretty good but not "fabulous."  Kind of on the fattening side, but that Parmesan also kinda "made it," tho it could use a bit more dressing.  Easy to make.

Good salad. I subbed a stick of pepperoni for the salami & added some black olives. I think this would serve 4 as a main dish but as a side probably twice that many. It's very filling!

This was very easy and yummy.  I didn't have any salami, so I used pepperoni.  It worked well.

Think was very simple, easy, and fast to make.  I reduced the parmesan to 3/4 cup and the salami to 3.5 oz, which made it a little bit lighter but still flavorful.
