Wow! this chili is great.  Easy to make with the rotisserie chicken  and packed with flavor.  I actually added too much cayenne pepper but my family is still eating it. I made white rice to go along with it and they like the combo.

Chile Chicken Chili Haiku: "Guess we're of the few. Salsa verde overwhelmed. But easy to make." The salsa verde really took over this entire crockpot of chili making it less than enjoyable for us to eat. I followed the recipe exactly, except using a can of crushed tomatoes instead of puree (close enough, if not same), homemade chicken stock instead of veg broth, and a chicken that I'd cooked, shredded and frozen into meal-time portions ahead of time (that had produced said chicken stock.) If I made again, I would saute the onions and peppers in olive oil, adding garlic, prior to putting in the crockpot, and would sub small cans of diced green chiles instead of the salsa verde.

this is excellent! i left out the cayenne powder, chili powder and cumin. i use  mile rotel tomatos and canned corn. after picking over a roto bird for 1 dinner, i shredded the rest of the bird into a large cast iron stock-pot. the slowcooker is not needed here. i used fresh red bell-pepper. this is BETTER the next day. i made some sweet cornbread and a salad. excellent stuff!!

I added 1/2 c. cream, 1-1/2 c. cheese, 1 large can diced chiles and 1 head chopped cilantro.

I also sautéed the onion and garlic and then added broth and remaining ingredients.

This is very good.  I was really surprised that something so easy  would be this flavorful.  I love it as written, and I love how easy it is to change it up using whatever is in the house at the time.  Very good!  Thank you :)

I made this according to the recipe except I  couldn't find  any "sweet white corn" at my grocery so I used "white shoe peg" and to this day, I'm still not sure if there is a difference in the two or not?  I had some friends over for New Year's Eve and everyone loved it!  I will make this again!

The only changes I made to this recipe was to switch the beans to one can of Black beans and one can of Pinto. I also cut up fresh peppers instead of frozen. I actually won my works Chili Cook Off with this. It has great flavor and just the right level of spice. Pair with some cornbread and it is even better.

Didn't have corn but was still good. Great use of leftover chicken I had grilled.

We make this all the time - there's just something about this chili that we love. We sometimes substitute turkey for chicken (especially in the days following Thanksgiving!), and we never put in corn or red pepper, but we do put in tons of beans: black beans and kidney beans were in the most recent version. Don't skimp on the cumin!

Excellent recipe, very customizable. We reduced the heat for the kids but it still had great flavor.

I used fresh diced bell peppers and added 2 diced jalapeños. I sautéed the peppers and olive oil before adding to the slow cooker.  I substituted Heredez guacamole salsa for the salsa verde and only used one jar. This was easy to make and had a good flavor. Thanks for the recipe :)
