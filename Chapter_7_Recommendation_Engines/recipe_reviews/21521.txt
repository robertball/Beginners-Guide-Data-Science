I loved it! I originally tried this dish when one of my friends from South Carolina's mother made it. I found this recipe and made it for an office potluck! My colleagues were a little skeptical of the dish based on the title, however, they tried and loved it! I've received several requests for the recipe and I am making it for a cookout today. TIP 1: Make sure you drain the pineapple and THEN only add 8 tbsp of the remaining juice. 

TIP2: It tastes better with only 3/4 cup of sugar.

FANTASTIC! Reduced the pineapple juice to 1/4c.  Used 1 can crushed - with juice and 2 cans tidbits, drained (save 1/4c. for mixing in).  Everyone LOVED it.  Warning: Very Addicting!

Excellent. This is the same recipe that my Granny has been making for about 15 years now. The biggest thing to note is that IF you are using pineapples in heavy syrup then of course you don't need extra sugar (as some reviews has said, because heavy syrup is sugar). If you use pineapples in their own juice with no added sugar then you can safely add the sugar. Also I made this recipe gluten free by changing some of the ingredients to gluten free ingredients and it came out just great. You can buy gluten free crackers and use gluten free flour in place of the gluten filled ingredients

This was a really tasty side dish.  I only used 1/2 cup of sugar and that was plenty. Also I like to use pineapple tidbits better than chunks since they are smaller and make the flavors and textures mesh better. I drained my pineapple out of the can and reserved the juice for later uses, also I did not add the 8 tablespoons of juice since the pineapple were still very juicey. I think the extra 8 tablespoons would have made this casserole too mushy for many tastebuds (including mine.)  Thanks for this recipe, it's a keeper.

I had a friend bring this to our Thanksgiving potluck at work and asked her for the recipe. She emailed me this page! I followed the directions for the most part except I doubled it and used 1/2 crushed pineapple and 1/2 pineapple chunks. I also used less sugar, 3/4 cup per instead of a whole cup. It was excellent.

I have eaten a lot of delicious food in my day but this surprising treat was addicting.  I couldn't stop eating it!  I had it instead of mashed potatoes, I had it instead of dessert, it was truly one of the most amazing things I have ever eaten.

I can't wait to try a low-fat version of it, with Splenda and low-calorie butter!

i cut the sugar in half and still thought it was too sweet, next time i'll try it with no added sugar, i think the pineapple is sweet enough on its own.

I have tired several different recipes for the pineapple casserole but this one is by far the best and easiest. My family loves it with ham and also as a dessert.

This is the hugest hit at pot-lucks! I actually got this recipe a few years ago, and it was really wonderful! I got it from Paula Deen, but it's been around for a long time!

The flavours were very nice but it was far, far too sweet. It was like a pudding, I served it up but noone could eat more than a spoonful. I might try it without the sugar entirely.

DEFINITE CROWD-PLEASER!!!!
I always make it with crushed pineapple because I like the texture better, but it works either way. WARNING it is addictive. I highly recommend it for potlucks because it is easy, relatively inexpensive and delicious.

I cut the recipe by 2/3's and used one 20 oz can of crushed pineapple and then just added a bit extra of the other ingredients.  I had to bake it for about 5 extra minutes to get the top a little crispier and it turned out very nice.  We were having grilled burgers and fries, wanted another little side dish.  Very good.

I expected to love this recipe, but really it was.. Well, it was pineapple, cheese and crackers.  I kept thinking I "might" try to update this by adding some jalapeno or something with some bite - but I enjoy cooked pineapple too many other ways to make again. Sorry! Having said all of that, I did have friends who LOVED it, so it's something you'll just have to try for yourself, I think.

I make this for 3 out of 4 gatherings. Everyone loves it.  The original recipe has way too much sugar. I cut that down to 1/4 C and use 1 20oz can chunks, 2 20 oz can tidbits, and 1 20 oz can crushed for a 9x13 pan. This results in just the right consistency, not too much liquid but still moist and yummy.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving at my inlaws last year.  People raved about it so much they requested that I make it every year.  The creamy/saltiness of the cheese is the perfect counterpart to the tangy/sweetness of the pineapple.  I cut the sugar in half because I was afraid it would be too sweet -- and the dish came out great.

I used one can crushed, one can tidbits and one can chunks. Since some reviewers thought their casserole was too sweet, I reduced sugar to 1/2 cup. I did not have enough cheese so I was only able to use 2 cups.
 It was good but next time--I will not used crushed pineapple; I like big pieces better. I might also use 3 20 oz cans instead of 15...I like a lot of pineapple. I will probably keep it at 2 cups of cheese.
One of my favorite parts was the Ritz cracker topping. I might make a little extra next time and mix some brown sugar (and maybe even some cinnamon and pecans?) into the mix.
Overall, it was good. I've had it once before prepared by someone else. This is a great recipe and easy to "play" with...you can't really go wrong if you mix up the amounts of the ingredients!

My family loved this recipe.  They were skeptical when they looked at the ingredients, but absolutely LOVED the final results.  I did make a few minor changes. 1) I used 2 cans of 20 oz pineapple chunks, drained 2) I did not add the 8 tbs pineapple juice and finally 3) I did not use the full 1/2 cup of butter slices for the top.  I only used about 1/3 of a cup. Will definitely be making this again.

Ok, so I opened a #10 can of pineapple yesterday to make a lime cottage cheese jello dish for St. Patrick's Day and I had lots of pineapple left over. Today I went searching for a recipe to use the pineapple and found this one.  I was skeptical because of the cheese, but the ratings were too good to ignore, so I thought "why not".  I went searching for Ritz crackers and couldn't find any, so I decided to use saltine crackers despite the fact that no one else had posted saying they had tried substituted them.   I have to say that I can't stop eating this.  I've already eaten about a third of whole dish myself!  Who knew pineapple and cheese would go so well together!  Yum! Next time I will have to try the Ritz crackers cause everyone knows how yummy they are. Oh... I melted the butter and mixed them in with the crushed saltine crackers before topping them over the dish.  Thanks for the recipe. It's a keeper!

Fabulous.  I made this for our Fathers day get together and have already recieved request to make it for our next family get together.  I used half the amount of butter and it still tasted great -- that way you don't have to feel so guilty eating it.

Everyone liked the recipe.  I think I'd like it better as a dessert heated up with vanilla ice cream.

This is a wonderful recipe!  I used 1 fresh pineapple instead of canned,but using 1C sugar was still too sweet.(the sugar tends to dilute the tangy tartness we expect from pineapple) Next time I'll cut the sugar in half.
Also, I can't seem to find pineapple juice anymore, so I used O.J. instead and it was fine.

I make this unusual dish every Christmas and Thanksgiving. People often mistake it for macaroni & cheese, and are usually weirded out when I tell them what it is, but I love it and so does my family. It's an addictive salty/sweet combination.

Turned out really well.  My boyfriend doesn't do pineapple, but he didn't realize what it was until after I told him.  Surprisingly tasty & went well w/ pork.

I thought I had reviewed this, but couldn't find it, so doing it for sure this time! The first time I made this I didn't have any crackers, and didn't find this out until I had gotten started on the recipe. Instead, I put some unsalted mini pretzels that were sitting on the shelf in my blender and mashed them up. That was the only difference that time. The 2nd time I substituted the cheddar cheese with Velveeta shreds and used the butter crackers. We all, me, hubby and 14 yr old son, liked it better with the Velveeta and didn't like the butter crackers. So now, I use Velveeta and unsalted pretzels on the top. Everyone loves it! The crackers were the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of five.

Thanksgiving 2010 was the first time I'd ever cooked or eaten this recipe. I'd tasted something similar at a Thanksgiving potluck last week, but we did not care for this. So, you've got this sickeningly sweet pineapple-y thing with butter and crackers (SALTY!) on top. So country. So Southern. So fattening. So greasy. So sweet. I'll never make this again.   I'll do an informative, step-by-step review:  First off, there are no 15-oz cans of pineapple at the grocery store. Only 20-oz and I believe 8-oz.  Mixing: At first, it sounded way too sugary and dry. Somehow, those 8 Tbsp of pineapple juice really thin down the dry ingredients though. It's more runny than pancake batter. I added the pineapple and cheese & poured it into a buttered 9x13 pan. Didn't have any problems with it sticking.  Topping: By "buttery round crackers", I assumed they meant Ritz. The crust was absolutely disgusting and did NOT taste like it was supposed to go on this sickeningly sweet casserole. It was more of a vegetable or chicken casserole topping. And that's WAY too much butter.  The only reason for the 2-stars is because I like pineapple.

I was very surprised how good this was. Even my husband liked it.  I did half the recipe and only stuck in about a 1/4 cup of sugar only because my pineapple was pretty sweet.

My mom has been making this for me since I was a little girl and now I make it for my children. When my friend asked me for the recipe I had to look it up because its one of those "until it looks right" recipes in my family. Thanks for putting it up.  Just a suggestion, if your casserole is getting greasy substitute crusted bread in large chunks (not bread crumbs) for buttery crackers and use 2T of butter instead of 1/2 c.  It comes out a little bit crusty on top that way.

Just made it.  Adjusted all ingredients for 1 can of pineapple, because that's all I had. I had all the ingredients on hand and needed to whip up some foods for a cookout. I had to convince others that it was good (because it sounds a little weird) but everyone ended up loving it!

This is by far the recipe my friends and family request the most for me to bring to get-togethers. I also reduce the sugar to 1/2 cup as did some others and it tastes just fine.

First my pet peave:  I HATE when a reviewer takes a recipe and completely changes it, then rates it...like the person down below did who used 3 different cans of pineapple.  By the time that person was doing with the recipe, it was not even the same recipe. Please don't rate a recipe when you've changed it that significantly.

Now my review.  This is a delicious recipe! However, my kids were not fans of this recipe.

We have a weird friend at work, who always brings this to our potlucks.  I didn't try it for the longest time, just because of her weirdness.  Boy was I missing out.  It's really surprising how good this is, just to be so simple and offbeat.  I think I'll make it the next time we have a ham.  Delish.  Thanks for adding it on here.

I tried this only because of the high ratings, it sounded kind of weird. What a wonderful surprise. I left out the cracker topping due to high cholesterol, but it was delicious and everyone said it tasted like a cobbler. Thank you; I'm keeping this recipe handy and making it for potlucks so others can enjoy!

I tried this recipe on a whim and was I ever surprised!  Who would have thought that pineapple and cheese go so well together.  I make this regularly now, except most times, I reduce the recipe since I'm only feeding two.

Thanks to Kerri for posting this, and to several other reviewers for suggesting that it could be made with less sugar too.  Your first bite kind of confuses your tastebuds, but then you just don't care, as it's so yummy!

I made this for my husband to take to work.  It was very easy to make.  He said everyone loved it, and there wasn't any left over for me to try when he came home.

Although this recipe adds ingredients that you never dreamed would go well together they work well to create a tasty, one-of-a-kind sidedish.

Who in the world would have thought to combine these ingredients?! But it works. I used brown sugar. Tasted delicious.  Obviously very sweet, but an interesting side dish.

Love this recipe, but I use very little sugar and two whole tubes of Ritz crackers (my preferred brand). A great holiday dish that is easily adjusted in quantity to fit the number of guests!

We have this every time we visit Amelia Island, FL.  There's a funky restaurant right on the beach that serves this as one of their side dishes.  Each serving is in an individual foil ramekin, and we're so nuts about it that if 2 side dishes come with the entree we make them both this casserole!  I was thrilled to get the recipe here.  Such a great resource this is!!

Pineapple Cheese Casserole is so delish! I only gave this recipe 4 stars, however, because I cut the sugar in half. Also, I think I will cut back a little on the flour next time, as it seemed a little gummier than I thought it should be.

We had this at a potluck and just LOVED it!  I sought out the person who brought it and she gave me the recipe.  She lowered the sugar to 3/4 c.  It was perfect.  I can't rave enough about it.  I never would've paired cheddar cheese with pineapple but it is out of this world and so easy!

I scaled it down for 2 people. I followed the recipe but thought it needed a little more pineapple juice and cheese. It was great though. I served it with baked ham-yummy!

This was as good or even better than I had had at a restaurant.  I had to serve 40 and they had requested this.  I used this recipe and changed the servings to 40.  IT WAS PERFECT!  Just the right amount for each person!  THANKS!

I think this recipe is good, but everyone else that eats it raves about it so I gave it five stars.  No real changes.  I use one sleeve of ritz for the topping and I normally use one can of crushed pineapple and two cans of tidbits. Thanks!

Great recipe! Always a favorite in my house.  Grew up eating this on family beach vacations at the Gift Horse in Foley, Al and finally have a way to replicate it at home.  Thanks!  It really compliments ham!

I served this as one of my side dishes for Christmas Dinner, a little hesitantly because of the odd ingredients, but am so glad I did.  It was a huge hit with all of my guests and will definately make again!

This did not go over well at all.  I followed directions exactly except for adding the 8 tbsps juice.  I just used the juice from the canned pineapple and it was plenty.  I divided the recipe into two pans and took them to two separate gatherings.  Only one person at one of the gatherings liked it and everyone else did not care for the dish.  I thought it was way too sweet and just did not like the flavors.  I think that this must be one of those recipes that you either really like or really don't...

Just a really great dish. Easy, different. Would be a nice holiday dish. Served it right out of the oven as a side dish. Some ate it then, others after it cooled a bit. Try it, you will be surprised.

Delicious!! I prefer to use pineapple tidbits. I omit the cheese, but it is still tasty. This will replace my aunt's pineapple casserole recipe.
