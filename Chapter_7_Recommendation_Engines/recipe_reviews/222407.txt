This dip does have a nice fresh taste. I served this with crackers, carrot and celery sticks. I also made a turkey wrap with lettuce, tomato and bacon using this dip as a spread for the tortilla. Great flavors. Thanks Challena

I really liked this recipe. However, I adapted it quite a bit, based on my needs. I used a cashew cream and extra lemon juice instead of the dairy ingredients, and omitted the parsley, since I had none. It turned out great!

This makes a lot, so I cut it in half.  Even so, 1 cup of basil is a lot of chopping!  This dip tastes so garden fresh... don't leave out the lemon - it adds a brightness to the finished product.  I found my pieces of basil to be too big and a little unappealing in the dip, so I suggest chopping it really, really small.  I served with baked pita chips, but I think it would go nice on potato chips too.  I used full fat dairy products.

I used sun dried tomatoes instead of fresh and added mozzarella...after sitting overnight it was really outstanding.  Took it to work for a potluck and everyone loved it! Will definitely make it again.

I think that this would be better used as a sandwich spread than a dip.

I don't care for the fat free cream cheese or sour cream so I used LOW fat instead and let the cream cheese come to room temperature before I started.  I think it would be a good idea to salt the tomato slices first and drain them for awhile before you put them in the dip, to remove some of the liquid, and substitute onion powder instead of onion salt.  This would give the dip a better consistency without changing the flavor.  You could also roast the tomatoes first or use sun-dried packed in oil, just drain and pat the oil off with paper towels.

Since this recipe had such high reviews I thought it would be "safe" to make for a party the next day.  I followed the directions exactly and I should have mixed the softened cream cheese first.  I should have known that. It's not my first time in the kitchen.  But - what I got when I mixed everything together was a lumpy mess that looked like cottage cheese mixed with salsa.  I can't serve that for a party!

So good! Our whole family loved it! I wouldn't change a thing. The combination of the tomato with the fresh basil and parsley make a refreshing summer dip with crackers.

I made this recipe exactally how it said and all i could taste was cream cheese. you couldn't taste anything else. plus no matter how long i mixed the dip was still very thick and wouldn't have been good for anthing but carrots. i finally added in some ranch dressing and that helped thin it out and give it a flavor other than cream cheese. will not be trying this again.
