Delicious!  I used fresh strawberries and fresh pineapple chunks instead and it came out so yummy.  Thank you for the recipe.

I changed the recipe a little because I like my smoothies thick. I also changed the servings to 5. I used a cup of greek strawberry yogurt and did not add the milk, and I used one 20oz can of pineapples in natural juice. The kids loved it and so did I.

I changed it up just a tad. I had a large amout of fresh sliced pineapple, so I used pineapple in place of pineapple juice. I also used fresh strawberries in place of frozen and skipped the ice cubes as I am not an "icy" kinda smoothie person, I like it smooth and fresh. I have wheat germ, so I used it in my smoothies. It turned out excellent and I will make this again!

What a great base recipe for smoothies! I used frozen fruit instead of adding the ice, added about 3 TB of sugar instead of 2, and omitted the juice altogether (I like my smoothies thick and I found that it didn't really detract from the overall taste). Can't wait for summer - lounging out in the sun with my smoothie ^_^

I thought this tasted like watered down yogurt, but don't judge by me because I'm no smoothie lover to begin with. Judge instead, by Hubs' report, calling this more refreshing than most, a "light" version if you will. A nice tart/sweet strawberry flavor, but had I not told him there was pineapple juice in it he wouldn't have known.  I asked him if he would have preferred this without the ice cubes and he said he would not - they are what made this particularly light and refreshingl

This was so good! Not too icey like some smoothies. Instead of pineapple juice I used the crushed pineapple in juice..and I also threw in some coconut. My bf asked for a sip & made me make him his own smoothie.

Fabulous recipe. To mix things up, I substituted the plain pineapple juice with pina colada juice and it was fantastic.

I thought this was pretty good. I was looking for a smoothie and happen to have all of the ingredients. It made 3 good sized glasses to. It was handy that the small pineapple cans are 6oz or 3/4 of a cup and the 3.5 oz packages of Greek vanilla yogurt actually measured out to be 1/2 cup, the amounts needed in the recipe. I used 2 packets of Truvia for the sugar. I don't normally care for smoothies with yogurt, but the ice seemed to lighten the heaviness of the yogurt some. The pineapple, was a nice sweet change to bananas to. ty

This recipe is amazing. I did it without the pineapple juice and wheat germ and added about another cup of milk cause it was too thick but it still tasted great.

oh wow is this good!!! I am a smoothie girl. Smoothies are that rare edible that can be as healthy (and still delicious) as you want or can be just pure sugar and satisfy that craving you have for something "bad for you." This one fits both bills at the same time. I used frozen strawberries, a small can of crushed pineapple, plain unflavored yogurt (and I added a splash of vanilla to compensate), skipped the ice cubes (its the middle of winter and I am tast-testing smoothie recipes to make up a recipe book for all my nieces for Christmas and I actually like thick smoothies and without the ice cubes this was the perfect consistency to me)and added 1 T ground flax seed which makes every smoothie good for me!!! LOVE IT!!!

Good all purpose recipe.  I substituted soy milk for the regular milk as I have problems digesting milk.  Light Vanilla soy milk works great in this.  Made the recipe as written for my family and they liked it.  Looking at using raspberries in this with pineapple next!

Very good. It didn't get a 5 star because I didn't use all the ingredients.   I didn't add the sugar, because it was sweet enough for me.  I also didn't add the ice cubes.  Plus I left out the wheat germ.

What a cool, refreshing smoothie! I didn't add the ice since the strawberries were frozen, nor did I add the sugar. It was plenty sweet for me. A delicious way to start the day!

Used frozen pineapple instead of juice and ice cubes. Plain yogurt, a little vanilla extract, and Splenda instead of sugar. Not much flavor. Would have been better with vanilla yogurt ( per the original recipe) and more pineapple.

The milk I used was almond milk, the yogurt was technically Honey flavored and I used about 1 cup of frozen pineapple chunks instead of juice. Didn't do the extra sugar, did do the wheat germ. This was light, refreshing and perfect. I was looking for a smoothie that wasn't chunky or have bits to chew and also wasn't super sweet. This was it :)

It is a great recipe. I added about 1 tablespoon of extra yogurt. I also used fresh pineapple and strawberry's.  I also used vanilla soy milk instead of regular milk. I will definitely make it again!

I gave up desserts 5 years ago, and this was so reminiscent of strawberry shortcake for me. Thanks for a great recipe that is also great for health!

Simple, tasty smoothie recipe. I'll add my variation to the list of reviews... fresh strawberries, pineapple juice, 5 oz vanilla Greek yogurt, 1/2 cup milk, no sugar, no ice cubes. Add one screened porch and a ceiling fan. Delicious, if you like a tart, creamy smoothie.

I'll be honest and say I didn't even try the recipe as is.  I didn't have pineapple juice or vanilla yogurt.  What I did have was a good portion of a 20 oz. can of pineapple tidbits with juice and vanilla bean ice cream.  I used the exact same measured amounts for both - as called for in the original recipe.  I omitted the ice since I used the frozen strawberries and vanilla ice cream.  (Wheat germ was out of the question.  This drink was all about the yumminess factor and not the nutritional value.) They turned out AMAZING!  Sure, it's more of a milkshake at that point, but still a yummy treat.  Even my toddlers loved it and asked for seconds.  Use the servings adjustment tool if you need more than two servings.  In my case I needed enough for six!

Wow! Tasted so good I decided to add more ice and make popsicles. Didn't have pineapple juice so I used fresh pineapple. Also, I used the wheat germ and 1 T flax seed. After I got the kidlets' portion out, I added a few handful if frozen swiss chard to make my green smoothie. The pineapple did well in covering the swiss chard taste. Awesome recipe and a definite keeper!

Great recipe, I also substituted  frozen pineapple chunks instead of pineapple juice and  lemon/orange sherbet instead of yogurt. It was hit for my family.

I made this with crushed pineapple instead of pineapple juice.

I also used plain vanilla greek yogurt, and it turned out well.

Finally, I replaced the milk with coconut milk, and boy did it turn out smooth & creamy!

This is by far my favorite smoothie recipe I've yet tried!

This was pretty good, but not as thick as I would have liked. I left out the sugar, and didn't  think I would like it sweeter. I used tropical blend juice instead of pineapple, because the cans of pineapple juice were huge and I wouldn't have finished the rest. Also, I didn't  have wheat germ, so I added a little ground flax instead. Thanks!

Very tasty and easy! I followed the recipe but used fresh strawberries and can pineapple chunks. I think next time I will try it without adding the sugar. It was good, but sweet.

Very tasty! I changed it up a fair bit - I used pineapple chunks instead of pineapple juice, added a full scoop of vanilla whey protein, and added a lot of ice; also I left out the sugar, b/c if you have all that fruit and yogurt, it's sweet enough for my taste. Came out very well, though next time I will add more ice for a thicker texture.

This is a great easy smoothie. We tried it as written, but like it better with flavored yogurt (we did strawberry banana) to give it added sweetness (we thought the original was a bit tart) and more flavor. Also, we don't do ice, and it has a great texture!
