This was OUTSTANDING!  I omitted the cottage cheese and added an extra can of mushroom soup.  I own a Cafe and do catering and this recipe will be one of my favorites (especially during Lent).  I'm catering a lunch for 90 tomorrow and guess what the vegetarians are having!  ;)

I added fresh spinach and some sliced zucchini, used low fat versions of cottage cheese and parmesian and the skim mozeralla and let me tell you that between my bf, my 18 mo. old and myself there is just one little piece leftover for tomorrow's lunch!  Will make again and possibly add chicken.

A very tasty dish.  This is one of the few meatless lasagne dishes my children eat and love to help make.  We use the no-bake lasagne noodles and try to use fresh garden vegetables.  I also push the cottage cheese through a sieve to make the cheese a bit finer.

This is a great recipe! A very nice change from a tomato or heavy alfredo sauce.

Pretty good, but next time I will eliminate the rosemary. Altough subtle, the rosemary gave this dish an odd flavor.  I added some cayenne pepper to the cheese mixture to appease my husband, the spice god.  Next time I will try adding some sauteed onions & garlic as well fresh mushrooms.

As far as lasagna goes, this was a very quick and easy recipe. It won the Dad & Kid seal of approval which doesn't come easily! Quite tasty although I think I will leave out the rosemary next time. Thanks for the great recipe! It is definitely a keeper.

This is a keeper! I am always looking for meatless dishes to stretch the grocery budget, and also to have during Lent. My husband and kids are wild about it. I use fresh broccoli and carrots, lightly steamed. I also use half cottage cheese, half ricotta (both low fat). I find that is a good combination of texture and moisture. And instead of parmesian cheese, I use a Italian-style cheese blend from Aldi's. I recommend spraying the pan with cooking spray, cooking the pasta in the water that you steamed the veggies for added flavor. I would recommend letting the dish stand 5-10 min before cutting so it has a chance to "set up". This is delicious with warm Italian bread and a green salad.

My husband and I LOVED this recipe. We were having a guest for dinner (who is vegetarian), so I chose this recipe. The result is a hearty, creamy, delicious lasagne. I used one can of Healthy Request cream of mushroom, and one can of cream of mushroom with roasted garlic. Next time, I may try to lighten it up a bit by using light cheese. This is a keeper and I will make it again and again. Thanks!

Very good!!  I used oven-ready noodles, so I added some water to the sauce and started with a layer of sauce before the noodles to be sure that the noodles cooked.  I used 2 cloves of fresh minced garlic and skipped the paprika and rosemary.  I also used ricotta instead of cottage cheese.  Great flavor and 
texture!  I thought I would need to play with spices, 
but there is plenty of flavor here!

FANTASTIC! The only things I changed was, I left out the rosemary and I mixed everything in one bowl instead of setting one portion aside and doing the veggies and whatnot in another bowl. I figured it was all going to be mixed up in there together anyway. Even  my youngest, who tends to be my pickiest, LOVED it! He asked for seconds which he rarely does! YAY! Definitely making this one again!

ETA: just as good if not better as leftovers! the garlic powder really kicked in after it sat overnight in the fridge and made the flavor even more amazing! we finished every last bite of this awesome lasagna and have added it to the regular rotation!

Excellent! I had some leftover gruyere and fontina cheeses that I mixed with the mozzarella. The sauce looked a bit dry while mixing it so I added about 1/4 cup sour cream. I wish someone would come up with a recipe for 'homemade' condensed soups. I hate using the canned stuff. But this was totally worth it!

Followed the recipe and a really good lasagna. Can be better. Next time I'll use Alfredo sauce instead of mushroom soup, use favorite veggies & seasonings.

I was inspired to make vegetable lasagna after I saw a frozen one in the supermarket.  It looked really good but I figured I could recreate it without all the junk the factory puts in.  I changed this recipe to be more like the one I saw at the store, plus, I don't really like cream soups.  Instead of the soup and all the different types of cheese, I just made a cheese sauce like you'd make for mac n'cheese.  Flour, butter, milk, chicken base (or boullion), onion powder, garlic powder, pepper.  Steamed the veggies and chopped them really small.  Layered noodles, cheese sauce, veggies, noodles, cheese sauce, veggies, noodles, cheese sauce.  Then I topped it all with a buttery crumb topping.  It has to sit for a while out of the oven for the sauce to firm up.  But my family liked this dish.  It was familiar enough to mac n'cheese the kids ate it up and substantial enough for the husband.

I used 2 cups of fat free mozzarella for the filling and 1 cup of regular mozzarella for the topping, and I only cooked my lasagna noodles for about 4 minutes, just until they were pliable so they would not over cook in the oven.  My husband and I both really enjoyed this dish, and there is so much left for leftovers.

this worked out great with pasta shapes, too.  substituting sour cream since I was out of cottage cheese panned out well, too.  I sauteed the veggies for some added flavor.  great recipe!

This was really good, but needed some tweaking. I added chicken, fresh garlic and onions, and substituted cottage cheese with about 1/4 cup of half and half. I also used frozen veggies, just thawed them and steamed them. It was really easy and filling. Next time I would add a bit more spice because it was bland for my family's taste, but a really good start.

I really liked this recipe, but my family did not love it.  My husband is a meat & potatoes kind of guy though, so to be fair, a veggie lasagna is probably just not right for him.

Now... I totally skimped on this recipe and it still tasted very yummy! Though it ended up being a sauce for the sheets of lasange I still enjoyed every mouthful! Only had the condensed soup and cheddar cheese so I had a go at it with these ltd ingredients (and the veg, pasta and spices of course) and I was happy with the results. Though, like I said it becomes a sauce rather than a dish. I cant wait to add the cream cheese because I think that is the secret ingredient! Thanks for a super easy mmmm recipe!

This is a tasty recipe.  I made a few changes: used 3/4 cup fat free ricotta instead of the cottage cheese, used shredded parmesan cheese, omitted the rosemary and used part skim mozzarella.  I also used chopped asparagus, zucchini, shredded carrots and broccoli.  I loved the use of the cream of mushroom soup.  It was a big hit. Thanks!

This was really good.  I like some others substituted Italian seasoning for the Rosemary.  Other than that I made it as written.  My 6 yr old son loved it.  It is the first time I have seen him turn down garlic bread because "the vegetables are more yummy."

This was the first veggie lasagna I've ever tried to make and it both looked and tasted amazing. I used 2 cans of cream of broccoli since I don't like mushroom and whole wheat lasagna noodles. I also added a package of spinach and reduced the amounts of all three cheeses to make it a bit healthier and it still turned out great! Will definitely make again.

I substituted an alfredo sauce found on this site and added cauliflower.  The carrot sticks I used still remained slightly crunchy which was an added bonus for me. My husband, however, picked out every one.  You could microwave carrots for a few minutes if you don't like the crunch.

This was a pretty good recipe.  My husband and brother both liked it, and my husband generally doesn't like lasagnas.  We didn't have any garlic powder, so I threw in a few cloves of fresh garlic.  I substituted the rosemary with Thyme. I will probably make this again.

This was an excellent recipe and the first time I've make lasagna!  I sauteed a chopped red onion in butter and added it to this recipe just for a little extra flavor.  The only things I would change other than that is maybe a little less paprika in the pamesan mix and a some real chopped garlic mixed in the layers.

Followed the recipe almost exactly except that used 1 cup broc (instead of 2) + 1 cup zucchini because it is what I had on hand and sauteed the veggies adding onion and garlic to the mix. Thought it was kind of bland... but has good potential. Next time I will add fresh chopped mushrooms and more (fresh) rosemary and perhaps a dash of worcestershire sauce. Worth trying.

My wife will not eat mushrooms so I used 1 can cream of broccoli and 1 can cream of asparagus. I added some peas and corn, and I used whole wheat noodles.  Everyone loved it. I found the Rosemary to be too stong, but when I made it again and cut it in half I missed it. Go figure.  Any way an awesome and simple recipe that will become one of my main stays.  Thank you

This is very good!  Fiance and I started a diet yesterday, so I made a healthy version using the Campbell's lowfat soups and lowfat cottage cheese.  We each had seconds and I just had more for lunch today.  I accidentally used one cr. of mushroom and one cr. of chicken and it was still delicious.  Oh, and I added some sauteed onions and garlic at the suggestion of another user.  Meant to throw in some spinach but forgot; will probably do that next time!

I loved this, but my significant other thought it was just okay. I'll definitely make it again though. Next time I'll use more cheese and spice. I also scaled down the recipe for two servings, and the servings were very small. I'll just make the whole 12 servings next time.

My wife and I loved this dish (we are non-vegetarians).  I did tweak this recipe a little bit:  I substituted 1 can of cream of broccoli for one of the mushrooms, and I also scrapped the rosemary/paprika and instead opted for some "Italian" spice mix.  It was great!

I did not like this very much the first day but the next day it was great. I steamed frozen broccoli florets, and shredded carrots right into the chesse mixture, also added a package of frozen chopped spinach thawed and squeezed. I skipped the rosemary, used lowfat cottage cheese and cream of mushroom and roasted garlic soup also used no boil lasagna sheets. Next time I make this I will make it a day ahead of time realy is a great recipe.

This lasagna was really easy, tasted ok and used a lot of ingredients that I had on hand.  I served it with alfredo sauce, but in hindsight I didn't really need that.  I used ricotta, not cottage cheese, I imagine that made things a little more solid.  My only complaint was it was a little on the thin side, this taste was all right, I don't know if I'd serve it for any reason besides it was lent.

This was great!  I didn't have carrots, so doubled the broccoli - that worked.  Added just a little cheddar for even more color, and added some extra mushroom soup.  My husband raved about it. Thanks for a great recipe!

I loved this!  I changed it up a little and added spinach and mushrooms.  Also subbed out the rosemary for basil. And I used low fat, fat free where I could. It was delicious, my husband loved it too.

This was a pretty impressive recipe.  I followed the recipe to the letter, except I subbed ricotta in for cottage cheese.   sauce was delicious, though I would double the rosemary and add some fresh garlic next time to amp up those flavors.  The texture was good.  The flavors were mellow, but delightful.

This recipe was perfect on a cold night. I sauteed fresh garlic, mushrooms, leeks and bell pepper and added it to the veggie mix which I think added a lot of flavor. I also topped it with a mix of bread crumbs and parmesan cheese.

extremely delicious side dish when having a barbeque.  It could have fed an army and was not expensive in supplies.  Will definately make it again.  The recipe IS kid friendly- it's just that my kids are NOT friendly!! They would not touch it.

This is a great recipe. My 9 yr old is a very picky eater and she loved it. Next time I will add some spinach and maybe some alfredo sauce to jazz it up a bit. I recommended this to anyone who wants to step away from red meat and eat fresh veggies for a change.

This recipe is absolutely delicious! I served it to two people who initially thought the recipe sounded "gross" and they ended up loving it. In addition to tasting wonderful, it's really a very simple, time-efficient recipe. I agree with reviewers who suggested making the lasagna ahead of time--I made it two days before I served it and by that time the flavors were beautifully mixed together.

This is an excellent recipe! I typically prefer a meat dish for my main couse, but love this lasagna. I typically use the Garlic Cream of Mushroom soup to give it a little extra flavor. I find cottage cheese works better in most lasagna, because ricotta seems to dry up too much for my taste. This is best when it is made a day or two ahead, it allows all the flavors to 'melt' together nicely. It is definitely worth the effort!

It took a little over an hour to make.  I used a full box of noodles (16 oz), extra carrots, extra broccoli and a box of chopped spinach (10 oz).  I overlapped the noodles more, and placed some on the top layer.  Then I covered that with some extra cottage cheese and parmesan, then added the left over mozzerella, .  The spinach added extra vitamins and a little zing!  I accidentally added regular Rosemary (not crushed) but it still turned out flavorful.  My 2 year old loved it! (except the carrots of course.)

One of my favorite lasagna recipes if I’m wanting something different. Instead of rosemary, I use Italian seasoning (same quantity). It is even better the next day!

This was really surprisingly good. I think the only change made was using more cheese, because cheese. :)

Wow...very tasty vegetable lasagna! I made the recipe as written but only omitted the rosemary as I though it would overpower the recipe and the cottage cheese since my children don't care for it .  I saved it to my favorite recipes and definitely will make it again. Thank you for sharing!

My wife and I made it with no-boil lasagne noodles.  We hesitated at first because of the lack of liquid but it came perfect.  This combination of cheeses and veggies is absolutely delicious.  Other than the noodles, we would not change a thing.  It is great.

I wasn't quite sure about the rosemary at first, but after a few bites, I decided it was the right spice and no substitutions should be made.  I steamed the broccoli and sliced (I didn't chop) carrots for 8 minutes.  4 cups of broccoli was about 1 pound and 2 cups of carrots was about 4 large carrots.  9 lasagna noodles is half of a box.  Substantial and yummy.

This was pretty good!  The leftovers were even better.  I made my own sauce base instead of using the canned soup (boil milk with chicken bouillon cubes and stir in flour) but used the garlic and rosemary.  Subbed grated carrot and zucchini for sliced carrots and broccoli.  I was a little afraid the carrots and zucchini would make the lasagna soggy after it was cooked, but it turned out fine!  I'll probably make this again some time.

This lasagna was awesome, and such a great break from traditional lasagna.  I threw in a whole bag of frozen broccoli and whatever carrots I had.  I also put in some extra shredded chicken I had, but it didn't really need it.  This will be a regular for me.

I really liked this. I skipped the cottage cheese and rosemary, and used creams of broccoli and mushroom. I also added peas. My 4 year old picky eater said it was "very very good" which is a huge compliment.

Oh my! Delicious! I did modify a bit after reading other reviews. Used no boil noodles (I'm lazy) make sure to spray dish bottom w Pam. Used one bag frozen broccoli, one bag froz broc,onion,pepper (cooked prior to mixing) instead of carrots. One can cream mushroom w garlic, one half can cream broccoli. Everything else per recipe. Truly excellent! Thank you.

We didn't care for this one.  I found it had a bland, yet slightly strange taste (maybe from the vegtables?) and the texture was very gluey.

The only thing I did differently was to add paprika directly to the sauce mix as well as on top. My daughter liked this which is just as well as I made the amount in the recipe and froze the rest for her. Thanks.

I left out the rosemary but otherwise followed the recipe precisely.  I really don't think I will make this recipe again.  I have bought frozen vegetable lasagna in the past that has tasted much better than this recipe.  I love cream of mushroom soup but it seemed like an unusual flavor to have in lasagna.  It was good but none of my guests raved about it.

On the advice of the other reviewers, I left out the rosemary, but I did add a spoonful of dry italian dressing mix to the soup mixture.  Next time I will leave out the paprika, it was a bit too strong for us.  This was pretty good the first night (but very sloppy), and improved in taste and texture on the second night.  Next time I will add chopped chicken.

I have made this recipe several times.  Every time, people have raved.  This is a great recipe for everyone, not just vegetarians.
