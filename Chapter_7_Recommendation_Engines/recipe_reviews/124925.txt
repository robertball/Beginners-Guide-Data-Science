It was great to find a venison recipe instead of adapting beef recipes.  I made some changes: soaked the venison in milk to remove any gamey taste, sauteed the onion in butter before mixing, and used 1/3 cup catsup instead of vinegar.

I could tell it was venison, but hello! if you don't like venison, don't make stuff with venison in it! I just took it out (it's been 70 minutes) and the middle was still a little raw so it's back in the oven. I did try a bite off the side before I put it back in though and it's amazing! I made minor (very minor) changes to the recipe. I used a cup of crushed saltines and omitted the salt instead of dry bread crumbs, I used the equivalent of two eggs with the egg whites that come in the carton and I used extra tomato sauce and a little more pepper. I also don't like mustard sauces so I made a concentrated brown gravy and poured it over the top (still liquid, not thickened through cooking) and it was really good. So for those guys out there that don't like mustard, try some brown gravy! Also, it's super moist. And whoever said there were too many ingredients....what? This is minimal and took two minutes to get everything chopped (food processor), mixed (used my hands), and put in the oven.  ***UPDATE**** While it was initially delicious, it did not refridgerate well. It looked/smelled like catfood, although it still tasted like the venison loaf. I was not able to get passed that, but when it first comes out of the oven it IS delicious, so just make sure you have a large enough group of people to finish it that evening.

The BEST meatloaf I have ever had. I used a 1 1/2 of ground venison that my husband shot. This vension had 10% pork added to it to give it some fat content. I did not have tomato sauce so I just used some ketchup, bbq and worcestershire. I also used up some leftover panko bread crumbs. I also substituted the onion for onion soup mix. I didn't not add any extra salt due to the soup mix. I followed the rest of the directions. I did cut the bread crumbs to just under 3/4 cup. This was super moist and absolutely delicious. Def. a keeper!

OMG! The best meatloaf I have ever made!!! My husband agrees! No grease on the bottom of the pan, and the flavor was wonderful!! I used old fashioned oats for the bread crumbs, 1 1/2 tsp. of a spice mixture I bought on Amazon called Spike instead of S&P, and added 2 Tbs. catsup to the topping (which I won't do the next time. I feel it would have been fine as is written). Can't wait to make this again SOON! Thank you so much for this basic recipe. Served it with mashed cauliflower and it was a meal to remember!

This venison loaf was so flavorful - it's far better than any meatloaf I've ever tasted.  Made no adjustments - and the glaze was delightful!  Thanks for the recipe.

I used venison that I had ground with just a bit of pork, and found this recipe very flavorful. I did use a bit over 2 lbs of meat, and ended up with two pans of meatloaf. I will cut the breadcrumbs by half, the next time I make this. And I topped each loaf with three, 1/2 strips of bacon before adding the glaze that I thought was a nice change from any type of tomato topping. (I used cider vinegar and it was very good). I've been sampling since the loaves came out of the oven. This is a really nice addition to my comfort food recipes. Thanks Liz.

This meatloaf was just ok.  It could have used some ketchup, or bbq sauce, and some more seasonings.  I definitely tasted the deer in this recipe.  I knew I was eating deer with my first bite, but that's ok because I like deer.  It definitely needed something though.

Not a big meatloaf fan, but this was yummy. Pretty much followed directions , but did add a splash of Worcestershire sauce and used Grey Poupon harvest coarse ground mustard. When it was hot out of the oven it did not stay together very well, but the next day it firmed up nicely and was not dry at all.

This meatloaf is delicious.  My husband is a big deer hunter, so over the years I've learned to make many meals with ground venison (spaghetti, chili, etc).  I was looking for a good meatloaf recipe and this is it.  I didn't change a thing - wonderful.  Thanks Liz for a great recipe.

I have never reviewed a recipe but I've been using this site for years.  My husband is a hunter and I barely like beef let alone venison!  But lo and behold every year I'm proudly presented with tons of it...  I try new recipes all the time to find something I like so we can eat it.  Finally we have a winner!  I soaked the meat in milk overnight and after that I added a piece of bread torn into pieces to the meat mixture.  This was fabulous and I finally will be able to eat venison!

I made this recipe using 2 lbs of venison and 1 lb. of pork. The rest of the ingredients were the same. Something about the brown sugar and vinegar...mmm mmm good. Everyone loved it and it made great leftovers for sandwiches.  I will be cooking this again and again!

This was good but I have to agree, once it is cooled off and/or leftovers, it isn't too appetizing.  But however this opinion from me could also be the result of unfamiliarity with venison.

This recipie was great!  My kids loved it and my husband didn't even know it was venison!  I only changed 2 things.  I used aple vinegar instead of reg. vinager because I'd heard that apple takes some of the game taste away and I didn't have spicy mustard.  I used 2T of ketchup and just added a little bit of reg. mustard.  The ketchup was good with the sauce!  Will definitly  be using this again!!  Thanks!!!

Absolutely delicious! I loved it, my picky kids liked it, even my meatloaf adverse husband liked it. I made a few substitutions out of necessity because I didn't have the exact ingredients called for. I used crushed ritz crackers for the bread crumbs and dijon mustard instead of spicy brown. Thanks so much for the great recipe.

Guess I can't really rate this fairly since I made a change or two....but wanted to share what I did because it turned out well.  I followed recipe amounts, but did saute my onions before adding to the mixture.  I also added a packet of Lipton onion soup mix to the meat mixture.  This added alot of flavor!  Lastly, I baked this in muffin tins, so if was mini-meatloaves instead of one big loaf.  You can freeze leftovers so much easier this way!  It made about 14-16 mini loaves.  Baked them at 375 degrees for 18 minutes or so.

This is possibly the best meatloaf I've ever had! I'm not a huge venison fan, but we had some given to us and so I wanted to find some good recipes to use it. The only thing about this meatloaf is, that it looks absolutely disgusting before you bake it.  LOL   I didn't let my husband see it before I baked it because I knew he wouldn't have tried it. However, after it is baked, it is absolutely DELICIOUS!!! I'm sure I'll be making this on a regular basis now.  :)

I read and appreciated the comments on this recipe. I agree it is very good and well worth the effort which was rather simple.  I didn't understand why people might not like the leftovers. I just finished enjoying this meatloaf and I can see there is texture to consider - its very soft and doesn't hold form as much as standard meatloaf and that was a little odd at first. Still it tasted great. I think it would make a great sandwich option.  I used 1 lb of venison and one lb of venison sausage. I made a lot more of the top coating and modified it a little based upon all the comments. I only had yellow mustard (not dijon - with honey) so I mixed in hickory farms sweet and sour instead of brown sugar and also the same amount of ketchup. I would do that again because it wasn't too sweet and made a nice top coat on the meatloaf.  I also used ketchup instead of sauce as many people indicated.  I can imagine the only improvement to make on this recipe would be to firm up the loaf with related ingredients so it holds its form better.  I too almost never eat meatloaf but will use this to consume the many lbs of ground venison in our freezer. The calorie count is also excellent.

This is an excellent recipe.  Awesome flavor and very moist.  Baking this leaves the house with an aromatic smell (yum).  I had several coming to dinner and not enough venison so I added 1.5 lb ground beef and followed the rest of the recipe but put in a 9 x 13 baking dish.  I cooked for 80 minutes and let sit for 20 minutes.  Everyone from adults to younger kids loved this.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Definetely is a great way to tone down gamy meats. One way I found help out with the dryness was to grind in a couple strips of bacon to add a bit more fat, also instead of adding the sauce on top I just mixed in the mustard and vinegar with everything else and threw it in the oven, comes out great everytime

This was delicious!! Though we like venison, you couldn't even tell it was venison! Loved the mustard glaze - so different than typical BBQ or ketchup, it was a nice surprise.

I did use 1lb of venison as opposed to 1.5 (as that's all we had) and used cider vinegar as someone else mentioned, but those were the only changes - thanks so much Liz!

This is the best meatloaf that I have ever had hands down!  It was moist but held together nicely.  Add some whipped potatoes and corn and you have comfort food to the max.  Nice!

AMAZING!!!!  I had a group of people coming over last night.  Some liked venison, some were okay with it, and some didn't like it at all.  They all loved it!  Instead of using S&P, I used an Italian seasoning and I also used apple cider vinegar after someone else said they had.  I also used quick oats instead of bread crumbs.  I made 2 loaves since I doubled the recipe, baked it for 10 minutes longer.  The thermometer read 180 (I thought I had burnt it since it was supposed to be around 165) but with all the seasoning and sauce it stayed so moist.  You couldn't tell it was venison!  This is definitely one of my go to recipes now!  Thank you for sharing!

I made this recipe as written with only one change- I didn't have any tomato sauce so I used ketchup instead... It turned out awesome!!! My husband isn't big on meatloaf but he had two plates of this one! One reviewer stated that this doesn't refrigerate well- I have to disagree. We had this the next day and it was still great. This recipe is great in that it doesn't have the typical ketchup topping. I will be making this again!

Followed the directions exactly and found it so-so at best.  Family wasn't thrilled either.  Won't be making this again.  We like venison so that wasn't the issue.  The recipe was pretty bland.  Not awful, but no-one wants the leftovers for lunch tomorrow either.

This is probably one of the best uses for ground venison that I have ever made.  This meatloaf was phenominal.   I did 3 things different.  I used crushed white cheddar cheezits instead of bread crumbs, I used a half of pound of pork since I only had 1 pound of venison thawed, and I smoked it in my Bradley smoker while I was making ribs.  The mixture seemed a bit wet, but it cooked up good.

Amazing, simply amazing! Ok, even after reading all of the rave reviews, I didn't have high hopes for this recipe. Everytime I make something with venison, you can usually tell. I followed the recipe exactly and it was fabulous. DH couldn't even tell that it was venison! Thanks for a great recipe!

This was great! I'm not a big meatloaf fan & i've never made it before but had some venison to use. And my husband loved it, too! I changed some things- used 1/3 cup barbecue sauce and 1/3 cup chicken broth instead of tomato sauce. I also sauteed half the onions with 1 clove garlic. I used fresh-made breadcrumbs, too. Then, I mixed it all together and let it sit in fridge for all day before I cooked it- I think that gave the flavors time to meld. Great meatloaf!

Keep in mind this is my first venison meatloaf.  I didn't like the mustard sauce on top, we're ketchup or bbq sauce kind of people. Ha!  However my sons had seconds.  I will make it again, minus the brown sugar, mustard, vinegar topping.

My husband came home from hunting trip last week. I searched the site for recipes for moose. Didn't find too many. Found this recipe and tried it. I thought it was very good. I usually don't like meatloaf. I liked this because there weren't alot of ingredients that you had to add, most I had on hand. I also don't like onions and peppers. The only thing I changed was to use a little bit of dry onion flakes in stead of real onions. Thanks for the recipe, I'll be using it again.

This meatloaf is very good! I couldn't tell it was venison at all. Because I didn't have bread crumbs I just used a 1 cup of oats instead and it turned out just fine! That is the only substitution I made.

My husband loved this recipe. I found it a little soggy. But I fine most meatloaf to be soggy. It didn't hold its shape very well. We like to make meatloaf sandwiches for leftovers and it was hard to use this meat loaf for that because it crumbled too much.

I had 2 pounds of ground venison and didn't know what I was going to do with it. I found this recipe and followed it exactly and was not disappointed. Only one thing I changed, added 4 slices of bread, torn into pieces, since mixture was too wet as it was. other than that, very tasteful.

A friend of mine, who is an advid hunter, had some ground venison in his freezer that he didn't know what to do with.  I made this receipe....Oh my gosh!!!  It was an immediate hit.  We then tried it on a few friends, without telling them what it was made with, and they couldn't tell the difference.  This is a wonderful recipe and nothing needs to be changed.

I made this dish for my husband, who is generally skeptical about meatloaf. He really loved it! However, I did make some changes. I added 1/4 pound of ground pork. I decreased the bread crumbs to about 1/2 cup and added 1/2 c of mirepoix (vs. just onions); cooked 4 slices of bacon, crumbled + added to the meat mixture. Insted of putting the tomato sauce IN the loaf, I mixed that with the brown sugar and vinegar (didn't use the mustard) and smeared that on top of the loaf. Wonderfully juicy!

A good meatloaf, but I guess we prefer ketchup to the mustard topping. Next time I will add ketchup to the top the last 10 minutes and see if it meets my husbands approval. Thanks for a good recipe.

I am new to wild game. Never thought venison tasted so good. Hubby "declared" the best meat loaf ever. I used steak seasoning instead of pepper, for the spices. Mustard topping is a must.

I've never made Venison before so I took a chance with not only the recipe but cooking it as well.  My fiance and his best friend loved it!  I'm making it again for dinner tonight.  The topping is so much better than traditional ketchup.  No changes necessary and super easy to make!  This is definately a keeper!

Excellent recipe. I did not use as much of the mustard mix as called for because we do not like mustard very well, it was very tasty without it, though. Next time I will use less bread crumbs because the loaf seemed to be a little mushy and mealy. Taste was excellent, though. Definitely a keeper. Thank you, Liz!

This was awesome! I made the recipe exactly the way it was posted. I made new potatoes to go with it. My husband really does not prefer meatloaf but he took his first bite and was set back at how amazing it was. He went back two more times for seconds and thirds. It was also the first thing gone on my kids plates, they also wanted seconds. Phenomenal taste! Thanks for posting.

This recipe made me love venison!  FANTASTIC! It doesn't taste at all gamey.  It just tastes like really good meatloaf.  My husband and I used to grit our teeth and oblingingly eat venison if served to us as guests.  He and our boys went hunting for the first time ever and we now have a freezer full of ground venison.  We'll be making lots of this meatloaf!

Excellent recipe! I added a teaspoon of steak seasoning, but otherwise followed directions and it was easy to make and tasted fantastic!

Very very good. You really can't tell that it's deer meat. I used Hunt's tomatoe sauce for meatloaf and added a little more breadcrumbs and sauce than the recipe called for. Other than that I followed the recipe exact. BF loved it!!

This was by far the best meatloaf I have ever eaten! I am thinking of trying the glaze that goes on top with a ham maybe.

This was great!  I used some deer meat my husband killed and processed himself.  There was no fat added, so I was a little concerned that the meatloaf would be dry.  This was not the case at all!   I followed the recipe exactly, except I cooked it for 80 minutes since one review said it wasn't quite done at 70 minutes.   Will definitely be making this again and again!  Thanks!

It was alright. I'm not a huge fan of venison but I figured if I made it into a meatloaf I might be able to disguise the flavor enough for my liking. I did make it with half venison, half ground pork though to make up for the very lean venison. It was moist, but I could still taste something 'off.' The second time I made it (needed to use the rest of the venison) I made the glaze w/ ketchup, mustard and brown sugar, then I topped it with bacon. It was more to my liking that way.

This is my family's favorite meatloaf.  I follow the recipe as it's written, except, I sauté the onions first.  I also pour off any grease  after baking for an hour and then I add the glaze.  Yum!
