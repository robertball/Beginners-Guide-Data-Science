I have been making a similar salad for years and will suggest that you might like to add some toasted Walnuts or toasted slivered Almonds (for crunch). This is an EXCELLENT salad! Jeanne A.

This was delicious and very light and refreshing.  Maybe a bit too light in flavor.  We tripled the green onion to really have the flavor come out, otherwise it would have been a bit bland.  But with the additional green onion it was wonderful.  We have salad every night with dinner, and this will make a nice addition to our repertoire, especially during the spring and summer months.  Edited to add:  We've since had this several times in the last month.  I still recommend lots of green onion. I've started adding a couple TBSP of orange juice and some orange zest to really bring out the flavor of the dressing.  With these changes I'd bump up my rating from a 4 to a 5.  We also toss on some flavored almond slivers to complete the salad.  Yummm!

Delicious!  I didn't use the oranges or green onion.  Instead I tossed it with dried cranberries, almonds and feta.  This was quick, easy, and delicious!

My husband and I both enjoyed this salad. I followed the recipe. It is very easy to make.  I did substitute a can of mandarin oranges for the fresh orange.

This was really good.  I added a little orange juice to the dressing.  I had some kiwi so I chopped on up with the orange.  My husband isn't much of a salad eater but he eat every bite in his bowl.  Will definitely make again.

This was a nice fresh tasting salad! I love the fresh orange taste in this salad compared to other salads that use Mandarine oranges which give an atrificial and overly sweet taste. I reduced the oil and used about 1/4 cup olive oil, and I increase the honey to about 3 tbsp. I added some chopped red onion to give this salad a little more color - I will probably take "KymInNM" advice and add some thinly sliced fennel for some extra crunch and flavor next time. Thanx for the recipe!

The red wine vinegar, green onions, and oranges work perfectly together.  I did modify the proportions of the dressing a bit, using about equal amounts of vinegar & oil, and slightly more honey.  After I sectioned the orange, I squeezed the remaining juice and added it to the dressing.

This was a very refreshing salad.  The only alteration I made was reducing the amount of oil to a half cup - swimsuit season is coming soon!  It was still delightful.  Thanks!

A great dish for kids!  I used white wine vinegar, virgin olive oil and a teaspoon honey (plenty).   My kids also added fresh shredded parmesan (which they add to everything).  It was great!

Super easy, super good salad with a light dressing. Loved the orange pieces and took another reviewer's advice to add some toasted almonds. A nice alternative to a common tossed salad. The leftovers kept fairly well for a second meal. Give this one a try.

This is my kids favorite salad! Yay for kid friendly!!!!

I have made this a couple of times. The first time i didnt have honey or red wine vinegar. I used apple cider vinegar and maple syrup. Turned out very good. Second time I still didnt have red wine vinegar so apple cider vinegar again and honey it was still awesome.

This is a great recipe and similar to one I have made before, but lost. My recipe calls for mandarin oranges - which is easy & out of the can - no peeling. Also adding sliced almonds - carmelized in a frying pan over the stove with 1-2T. of sugar. Just watch carefully and stir frequently with a wooden spoon to make sure the almonds don't burn.

We liked this a lot. I had to add more honey, the red wine vinegar was very overpowering (for us). How good your oranges are REALLY makes a big difference in this. If your oranges are crummy and stringy, then your salad is going to be chewy and gross. I used cheapo oranges to start with and then switched them out for canned mandarin oranges later, but in the future I'll probably make this salad when I buy a bag of Clementines (as I often do and then wonder what to do with them all!) Thanks for the recipe!

The salad dressing is very tasty.  The oranges were a great touch.  I was joking with my wife that I could add blueberries & sliced strawberries to make this into a fruit salad salad.

Great salad!!  I have not been a fan of fruit in my salads, but this changed me.  I have tried it with toasted and non-toasted walnuts and did not notice a difference.  I also have used white and green onions, and both were very good.

This salad is very easy to make.  I added grapes at the last minute because I thought it needed something a little extra.  I also used red onions instead of green which worked well.  The dressing was a little bland, I could barely taste the onion.  I would recommend not being afraid of upping the ingredient you want to shine through whether that is the honey, onion, or pepper.  Or adding more of all of the them wouldn't hurt this dressing.

I loves this recipe! I altered it by adding the zest of a small orange, juice of 1/2 orange, and 1/4 cup pineapple juice to the dressing, and only used 1/2 cup oil. For variety I added 1 stalk of celery and instead of green onions I used 1/2 of a yellow onion thinly sliced ans 1 cup of pineapple chunks. I used sea salt but only 1/4 tsp.

I could not stop eating this--it was so delicious! I absolutely love the dressing (I used olive oil)--I'll use it for other salads, as well. I squeezed a little bit of orange juice over the salad before serving. Next time, I'll try this with some fresh basil. I also think it would be good with fresh fennel.

The amount of dressing suggested was way too much for the salad, so I just added a portion of it and saved the rest. This was so good and very refreshing. As others suggested, I added some toasted walnuts. Thanks!

Great recipe! The dressing was a little much but I think if you are just careful with the amount that you add, it'll be great. Also, I agree that toasted almonds or even adding pecans gives it a little extra crunch. Nice and healthy!

I added the juice from one orange to the salad dressing and only used 2 oranges for the segments in the salad.  This was such a nice salad that I will be repeating many times over the upcoming summer months.  I added toasted sliced almonds but I won't do that again as the salad really didn't need it.  Very good.

I made this exactly as it was written, and the dressing was too salty. Next time, I'll use 1/4 tsp of salt instead. Otherwise, it was very good!

I really liked this salad!  It was super refreshing and quite good. I added pink radish and only used one large navel orange- SUPER JUICY!!
The only issue that I have is that there was WAY TOO much dressing.  I cut back the oil to 1/2 cup and it was too much- and I only put 1/2 of it on the salad and it was swimming.

I didn't have green onions so used thinly sliced red onions and sprinkled with  sliced almonds. This was a light, delicious change to a regular green salad. Will definitely make it again.

I loved this salad and I think that the green onions are the key on this recipe. I added a couple Tbsp of fresh squeezed orange juice and orange zest to the dressing, I also added some almonds and feta cheese.

This is a delightfully refreshing and tasty recipe but doesn't save well because the oranges make it a bit juicy after the first serving, so make just enough to be finished at the first sitting.

I really liked this light and easy salad.  Like others, I felt that 3/4 cup oil was too much.  I used 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil, 1/4 cup vinegar and a tbsp. of honey.  I was unable to buy just a couple of oranges, had to buy an entire bag, so I opted for a large can of mandarin oranges, drained.  I also used more green onions as others suggested.  Then I added some Orchard Valley Salad Toppers glazed pecans with dried sweetened cranberries & pepitas.  Delish!  I liked the added crunch.

I made this salad for a BBQ.  I received many compliments.  I did as others suggested:  added sugar toasted almonds, extra honey, and some orange juice.  It needed the extra flavour.  Will definitely make it again.

Perfect for a light, easy meal! Made this on a day when the heat index was 109f & we wanted nothing to do with cooking a hot meal!! Would have been great if we had some breadsticks to go with, but it was yummy on it’s own.

Love this salad. I substituted apple cider vinegar and added sliced almonds before serving. Light taste and the sweetness of the orange made it an excellent side dish for a BLT sandwich. ; )

Very refreshing. I reduced oil slightly and as fresh oranges are not available where I live, I used a tin of drained mandarins. Added some dried cranberries for colour and crunch.

I was looking for a simple alternative to Caesar Salad. I served it to company and they really liked it. I made it again a few days later and it is a winner. Simple but very tasty. I did not change any thing.

Sometimes its hard for me to just leave it at simple - but with this recipe I did just that - I made the dressing exactly as described - using just a little more red wine vinegar than called for since I like that kind of twang to my dressings. This honey vinaigrette makes an excellent salad. I did add some carmelized pecans and feta cheese the first time I made it (I was bringing it to a party) but its not necessary - I made the simple version tonight and even left our out the oranges and this dressing is the key. Its perfect. Really.

Very good salad. It is great for hot weather! My lettuce was getting ready to bolt so I added a little more honey. I used can mandarins and added just a tbs of the juice to the dressing.

I just made this tonight for the first (of many) time.  Delicious! I'm having the little bit of leftovers for a bedtime snack and I can't wait to dig in again! A keeper for sure! I did not make ANY changes.  In my opinion it is a perfect salad as written.

I wanted a new way to use romaine, instead of Caesar salad, this was nice and refreshing, used clementines instead of cutting up oranges, but that's about the only thing I changes, it was delicious

As-is this is pretty bland.  A little orange zest in the dressing and some very thinly sliced red onion, along with some toasted pecans bring it to life.

The husband didn't really care for this, but I thought it was fabulous. I added cinnamon sugar almonds to the salad and cranberries - otherwise everything was exactly as is. A tasty, light, refreshing salad for summer on a patio!

Loved this salad, I added a few things b/c I had it in the house; pecans, gorganzola cheese, and crasins.  Just enough to really jazz it up.

I've been making a similar salad for years.  Sometimes I add fresh pineapple if I have on hand (living in Bolivia pineapple is always available and inexpensive), and always, carefully, toast the slivered almonds.  Yummy.
