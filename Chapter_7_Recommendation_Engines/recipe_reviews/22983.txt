After reading the recipe its obvious that people have forgotten the basic of eggplant! Slice and lay the slices out on a rack or paper towel or towel, lightly salt the slices to draw the MOISTURE out (this is what makes it soggy) rinse off after an hour or two, and then pat dry, finish the recipe and the chips will be a whole lot crisper. 
Learned that when I made Moussaka the first time, and it works with tomatoes for tomato pie. This will make crisper zucchini chips as well.

I LOVE Eggplant and this was pretty bad. Sorry, but I don't know what else to say. I followed the recipe exactly as it was written, and still I'd have to say, pretty bland and the texture was unpleasant.

This recipe has quickly become a staple of my family's summer diet.  We have made it three times in the past two weeks, and plan to make it frequently.  We have tried both Japanese eggplant and globe eggplant, and prefer the Japanese. We have also substituted parmesan cheese for the Romano and olive oil instead of plain vegetable oil. This is a great recipe!

I tweaked this recipe just a bit.  I preheated the over to 350. I sliced the eggplant so they'd be chips..big chips :-).  I then dipped them in egg. I only used seasoned breadcrumbs and parm cheese.  I dipped them in this mixture after dipping them in the egg.  I oiled a pan and placed them on there, then I drizzled the eggplant with oil.  I baked for 15-20 minutes and turned over and let cook the same amount of time.  I then turned the oven to 425 and cooked for another 5 minutes or so.  They were nice and crisp, even after cooling. They were also firm and not mushy.  I hope this helps.

I tried this w/ a few tweaks (in light of previous posts)...i zapped the slices of eggplant for a min. in the microwave before putting them on a cookie sheet (lined w/ parchment paper), put olive oil on both sides, sprinkled seasonings on one side, and flipped/reseasoned halfway through. They weren't "crispy," but they were good! Had to watch for burning  b/c i didn't slice as evenly as i could have.

Everyone, including eggplant haters, kids and teens, loved these. But I did what other reviewers did. I did the salt trick and also dipped in egg before dipping in bread crumb mixture. Baked at 350 for 20 min. Flipped them. Baked 15 more min and then raised temp to 425 and baked 5 more min. Perfectly crisp. Thanks to the other reviewers for those tips.

I have had experience with eggplant. I opted not to drizzle the oil.  I used olive oil PAM spray over it after placing on the cookie sheet.

I also made sure the eggplant was as dry as could be, then dipped it in the bread crumb mixture to coat well.  I turned them over after one side was browned.  They came out crispy on the outer part.

Not bad, the family liked them and thats what matters!

I made this last night and it turned out great. I followed the additional advice of 'mjonestammy' (who's review is attached to this recipe). In addition I used a little hand slicer to get nice and even 1/8" slices. I used two cookie sheets, flipping slices and swapping racks 20 minutes into the 325 degree setting. Then an additional 20 minutes. Then about 8 minutes at 425. But I did get a little burning on some pieces. So my timing was probably a little too long.

I also think it's important to do this in a gas oven. But I feel that in general for anything that is baked. I only have a gas oven, so I'm not sure how this would turn out in an electric oven. But I have a feeling it wouldn't be as good as gas.

I followed this recipe and had a similar outcome as Holly000 - soggy/funky texture. I cooked them even longer hoping they would become crispy...to no avail. I was quite disappointed.

I altered this quite a bit and it turned out good, even when cold. Whether you eggplant chips are soft versus crisp is determined by your cutting skills!

I used coconut oil, smearing both sides before placing on the cookie pan.  I then sprinkled my spice mix and baked at 400 for ~12 min per side...  Until golden.  Watch or you'll have overdone chips!

2-4 T coconut oil
1/2 t salt
1/2 t pepper
1 t gran garlic
1 t parsley
1 t oregano
Mix spices together and place in a shaker to get even distribution over eggplant.

I only sprinkled one side, although I did turn them half way to ensure even baking.

I sliced the eggplant in half.  I then thinly sliced into moon shapes. I dipped into egg, then into Italian breadcrumbs with Parmesan cheese.  I baked on non stick foil and sprayed a bit of oil on top.  Turned after 12 minutes, baked another 10, then crisped at 425 degrees for 6 minutes.  They did turn into chips, but they don't have much flavor, and are dry.  I salted with a sea-salt garlic 
mix, and they are still basically tasteless.

Nice little chips, although mine turned out more chewy than crispy, and it really appears to depend on the thickness and size of your slices.  I sliced into rounds and used baby eggplant (a mix of white and purple) since that's what I had and what I prefer anyway.  I also didn't spray with cooking spray or drizzle olive oil on them, so that probably changed the texture a bit too.  I sprinkled with salt and soaked out the liquid, then rinsed, drained and put on paper towels to dry.  Then I brushed with olive oil and dipped in the mix to coat.  Then I baked as directed.  Turned out very good, but hubs turned up his nose since he's an eggplant snob (as in, he won't try it at all!).  More for me--this doesn't make a lot of eggplant chips anyway!  Thanks for the recipe!

Healthy snack 
I cut them up in half so they bake up better I didn't add the cheese this time just my go to herbs 
I used a watered down egg wash to help keep the bread crumbs on 
I get the oiled baking sheet hot in preheated oven 
Then add eggplants with more oil on top 
for sauces I made a cilantro pesto with  jalanpenos  and added wasabi almonds to it also did a sour cream pesto for the coolest

Very tasty, but far from cripsy. I followed the instructions plus other reviewers' selections, and my chips looked just like the picture, but they were not crisp or crunchy.

I love eggplant and I was really excited about trying this one, but it was just awful.  It stuck to the pan and I could barely peel them off.  I tried to make these without salting/draining as written, and they were just too mushy/bitter.  I tried again with salted/drained eggplant, and i just couldn't find a way to make these work.

Followed recipe. After 25 minutes- eggplant was still mushy. Cooked longer and it ended up burned in the center and soggy around the edges. We threw it out.

Have read reviews and would use salt to reduce moisture, also would use egg dip, cover with bread crumbs bake as directed and warm tomato sauce for garnish. Use herbs and spices. Oil for cooking. Will try this soon. Thanks.

It took me a few tries with the recipe until it got the way I liked. 25mins turned out WAY too long. I had completely charred eggplant. I used a mandolin to slice the eggplant thin, so that was probably why. I also did not care for the breadcrumbs. I ended up cooking the eggplant for 15mins and seasoning with garlic salt, garlic powder, pepper, and cheese. The eggplant was still soft in the center, but it was delicious. I will continue making it this way.

No stars yet because I'm going to try this again and try drying the eggplant slices first. There was no crispy factor at all, just burnt toppings. Next time will be better I'm sure.
