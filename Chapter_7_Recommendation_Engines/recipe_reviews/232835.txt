I used to own a baking/candy supply store and these were one of our biggest sellers! I like to put some m&m's or other small candies in the bottom of the cone before putting the marshmallow in...the kids LOVE these! :)

These were really fun to make. I found using chocolate wafers instead of chocolate chips. I also softened Mimi marshmallows so they clumped and made a more soft serve ice cream shape. I also used colored wafers to create a colored dip cone look
