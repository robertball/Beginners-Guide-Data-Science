These muffins are delicious!  Very moist with a hint of sweetness, and the molasses give the muffins a great rich flavor.  I've made these a number of ways and like them best when adding 3/4 cup of quick oats to the dry ingredients for the base muffin.  A mashed banana added to the bran/buttermilk mixture is yummy.  I have also added a teaspoon of blackberry butter (can get from an Amish store) or any fruit jam to each muffin tin in between scoops of batter in each muffin tin for a nice filling.  I have also substituted unsweetened dried apples (soaked in the butter milk for 10 minutes before adding the wheat bran) or a fresh chopped apple for the raisins and it came out great.  For a nutritious breakfast, I like to eat these muffins split and spread with almond butter (or peanut butter) with a banana on the side and a glass of milk.  A great way to start the day!

Excellent muffins!  I like the gooey bran muffins from Mimi's Cafe, but my husband thinks they're too heavy. This recipe had all the sweetness, but was just moist instead of dense. I did use applesauce instead of oil, white whole wheat flour (from King Arthur) instead of all purpose, and increased the molasses to 2 tbsp. and the golden raisins to about 3/4 cup.  Baked in jumbo muffin tin (six giant muffins) at 375 for about 25 minutes.  Yummy!

Excellent recipe! My man and I love it as a low fat snack. I substitute the oil with apple sauce, use low fat buttermilk and typically add a bit more raisins. To switch things up as I make at least a batch a week, I will sometimes use honey instead of molasses and blueberries with cranberries instead of raisins. Thanks so much for this now staple recipe!

Made exactly according to the recipe (except I used currants, rather than raisins, 'cause that's what I had).  Tasty and nicely sweet, in a bran-muffin kind of way.  Thanks!

People need to realize that bran muffins seldom rise much above the rim of the tin ... it's the nature of the beast.

This is the best muffin recipe! I'm starting a small muffin and orange juice business and using these muffins. I wish that I was one of my customers. I've tried these muffins.

Simply delicious. I chose this recipe over the "Classic Bran Muffins" because this one had a little more sugar and molasses that I thought would make a sweeter muffin. I was right. This has the right amt of sweetness. The other recipe would not have enough. Also, left out raisins, don't like them. Overall, moist and wonderful.

This recipe is awesome!  I didn't have buttermilk on hand, but substituted 1tsp of white vinegar in 1 cup milk (let stand for 5 minutes after mixing).  Light, fluffy and moist!

Delicious recipe! I used honey instead of molasses.  While the muffins were warm out of the oven, I added a teaspoon of a combination of honey, melted butter, and brown sugar to the top of each one.  Kept them moist and gooey and delicious.  Thanks for the great recipe!

These muffins are AWESOME. The changes I make: 'sour milk' instead of buttermilk (1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar with 1 cup 1% milk), unsweetened applesauce instead of oil, decrease brown sugar to 1/2 cup (or even a little less), whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose. They are delicious and very nutritious!

Yum! These are very, very good. So similar to Classic Bran Muffins on this sight, but are a bit more moist and less crumbly. I didn't think it was possible to find a better recipe than those (which I've made many, many years), but I think this one is. It received rave reviews from everyone. I added more golden raisins than called for, but other than that I found these perfect for my taste.  I was a few tablespoons short on the buttermilk so I added some plain Greek yogurt to make the difference. Thanks! I'll make these again and again.

I switched out the oil for applesause and added some ground flax seeds, but otherwise followed the recipe the first time I made these.  They were tasty but lacking the sweetness I wanted.  Next time I made them, I added chocolate chips instead of raisins.  I make them almost every week now and can't keep my husband away from them!

Ever since my water aerobics teacher had to rush out of the pool and came back saying, "Maybe I shouldn't have had that bran muffin before I came," I've been thinking about the benefits of fiber. I made these today and loved them. I did substitute applesauce for all but a Tablespoon of the oil and I found a streusel topping from another bran muffin recipe here on AllRecipes that I added. This is going to be a regular thing, but then isn't that why we eat bran muffins, to be regular?

LOVE these muffins!!!! I will be getting married soon, and my hubby and I will love being able to just freeze these babies and pop em into the microwave for a quick, tasty breakfast in the mornings. I'd add a teaspoon of cinnamon next time, but besides that, absolutely perfect!!!

Loved it!!  I used whole wheat flour and I only had white sugar so I put in more molasses...perhaps a lot more.  I LOVE it.  It's not dense even though I used whole wheat.  They're so light and fluffy and rich.  I love the molasses flavour.  Oh ya...no raisins in the house, it's sweet enough without them!!

Great muffins! I've made these a few times and they're always so yummy. Just the right amount of sweetness and a great texture. The only thing i did differently, was substituted butter for oil-but i do this for all baked recipes.  This was actually the very first recipe i saved in my box after joining allrecipes.com and in my box is where it'll stay! :)

I first made these muffins about 5 months ago. I make a batch every 2-3 weeks. I tried a few recipes before I found this one. I have made a few modifications:  1) Applesauce instead of oil -- I use cinnamon normally  2) 3/4 c. whole wheat flour and 1/4 c. white flour  3) I use powdered buttermilk and add an extra tablespoon of water 4) I wanted LOTS of fruits in my muffin so I add 2 cups of various fruits -very small diced apple, raisins-regular and golden, dried cranberries, dried apricots-cut very small, and I will be adding a small amount carrot shredded the next time I make them - BTW 2 1/2 cups of fruit was to much. THANK YOU BRIAN for a great recipe -- it is a staple around here now!

This recipe was calling to me… I had buttermilk to use and needed a not so sweet muffin…. My hubby loves raisins AND his name is Brian… how could I not try this?  Seems like a very classic bran muffin albeit more moist than some I have tried.  Made exactly as written including the wheat bran with one exception…I did sub applesauce for the oil…. they turned out very nicely.  Hubby gives 2 thumbs up.

The taste alone is worth five stars, I just had a few little problems with the result.  First, they were super flat - I would have hoped that they would be a little more rounded.  We didn't care for the raisins - we made half without, and enjoyed that bunch much more.  Lastly, while the muffins are super moist, they fall apart quite easily.  Not a big deal for at-home use, but if I was making these for a brunch or something, I'd like for them to be a little more stable.  Overall, a great recipe though!  Will definitely make again with a few changes.   **Just made these again with applesauce instead of oil and "white whole wheat" flour instead of white -- they tasted just as great as before, so I'll stick with this healthier version.  We love to eat them hot out of the oven with a drizzle of honey!

Yum!  Sweet, very tender, and delicious.  I used nectarine sauce for more of the oil (random, I know), but that tasted really good!  I also went generous on the raisins.  Keeper!  Thanks.

I have been looking for a recipe that calls for regular bran (instead of the bran cereal). This is delicious and easy. The only changes I made were substituting applesauce for the oil and I used half wholewheat flour. Thanks.

What did I do wrong?  I substituted apple sauce for the oil and lowfat milk soured with 1 tsp lemon juice for the buttermilk, and ended up with flat-topped, sticky, spongey muffins.  They taste pretty good, but the texture is just weird!

Nice, moist muffin, but a little sweet for us. I'll decrease the sugar next time. I also added 1 tsp cinnamon, and I'd try to replace some of the oil with applesauce next time.

This is an excellent sweet bran muffin.  I make bran muffins for the high fibre, so am not concerned with high calories that may come with the sugar content in this recipe.  This is now my favorite.

Everyone in my family loved these muffins!  My almost-four-year-old ate three and then asked for another!  The only change I made was to use 2% milk soured with some vinegar instead of the buttermilk.

This recipe is great.  I did a few changes though.  Substituted 1/4c. apple sauce for half of the oil.  I used Oat Bran instead of wheat bran.  I used dried cranberries instead of raisins.  And I also added a litte more molasses - maybe 1-2 tsp more.  Oh, and used 1% milk with 1 tbsp lemon juice for the buttermilk.
I may use all apple sauce instead of oil next time.
Really great flavour and they weren't flat at all.

We used to be able to buy bran muffins in the shops here in the UK, but they had not been around for years, so this recipe has been a godsend (and better tasting too).

I have substituted the wheat bran for oat bran, and in place of molasses I use treacle.  It's still very tasty!

Thanks for a great recipe!  I love bran muffins and was looking for a recipe to make them.  I do adjust this recipe somewhat.  I substitute apple sauce for the oil, and reduce the brown sugar and molasses a little.  Even my 1 1/2 year-old and 4 1/2 year-olds love these!

By far the best bran muffin recipe I've ever made! I used raisin bran, coconut sugar, 2 T molasses and a hint of cinnamon and ginger. Officially my go to recipe for Bran muffins!

Maybe a bit sweet and I did cut the sugar a tad by 1/8-1/4 cup less. Didn't have brown sugar so used white.  And I  used fresh buttermilk that I cultured with kefir grains. 
Definetely addictive.

OK. This is it.  No more searching for the perfect bran muffin recipe!   I made this for my daughter's family, and without my asking how they liked them, they All commented on how good they were.  I made a couple of changes but none that would make them any better than the original--only different.  I cut the brown sugar to 1/2 cup and used half whole wheat flour.  No kidding.  These are the best.  Oh, I also used bran cereal because I didn't have regular bran, but I'm sure the quality would be good either way.  (I crushed the bran cereal somewhat before measuring.)    Love the molasses flavor.  I've tried SO many recipes, and I can't tell you how good it is to have found this one!   They're so light and delicious!  Make these!  You won't be sorry.

Just made this recipe and it turned out actually better that the picture of the one at the top of the recipe. I took a shot of it and its floating around on the site some where. Going to see if I can find it.

These are PERFECT.  Exactly what I was looking for.  Very moist and just the right amount of sweetness and molasses flavor.  I'm going to make them every week.
