I made two of these pizzas. On the first one, I used the full amount of dough in my large cast iron skillet. On the second pizza, I used about 2/3 of the dough. I found that both pizzas had too much dough for our tastes. I will make it again, but make two pizzas with one recipe of the dough, and I believe that we will STILL have deep dish pizzas. The taste is good; I love the texture that the cast iron brings to the crust. Good recipe...you just have to love a tremendous amount of crust/dough in order for this recipe to be exactly for you! Ours turned out way thicker than the picture shown. I will try to upload the picture of our first pizza. Thx for the recipe!

I have a "Pizza Maker", which is basically a deep dish pizza pan with a heating element.  You put everything together in it and close the lid and it bakes the pizza.  I have been looking for a dough recipe that made the right amount, since most make too much.  This was it.  It came out amazing.  I took it from the pizza maker and stuck it under the broiler for a few mins to brown the cheese and it was perfect.  Thanks!

Great recipe, pizza crust was chewy, but not tough.  I added more cheese.  Instead of canned or jarred pizza sauce, I used "Delicious Pizza Sauce Recipe" from allrecipes.

I've tried this recipe twice, the first time I used all the dough but it seemed like far too much, 2nd time I used about 1/2 and that was in a massive 15" cast iron skillet. I also added cheese inside the crust with some garlic butter too. Amazing! 1/2 the dough works great and can make two pizzas.

Using a cast iron skillet is a great idea. Since this makes a lot of dough I made two pizzas; one in a 12 inch skillet and another in a 10 inch skillet. I also subbed one cup of whole wheat flour for one cup of A/P flour because we like a whole wheat type of crust. One pizza was a meat lovers pizza with Italian sausage, ham and pepperoni and the other was a supreme type pizza with meats,green pepper, red onion and mushrooms. I also like extra cheese so I doubled that.
Cooked both at 430 degrees for 25 minutes and they were done. Brushed both crusts with the butter and garlic powder mixture.
Excellent!!! Will make this again and again.

Measuring from the top, I used a 10" pan. It was a perfect "Deep dish" pizza, chock full of toppings. I would not want any less dough at all or it would not be a deep dish pizza. Thanks for sharing your recipe, Sara 
* I added my photo, it is up top in the description now.

This was delicious, easy & fun to make with my son! Directions were easy and the end result was delicious.  I would add a little garlic seasoning to sprinkle over the top when you put it in the oven.

Be aware: This recipe makes A LOT of pizza dough. I had MORE than enough for my two cast irons, a 12 inch and 8 inch, and even though the dough was super thick.

Taste is good, but a lot of dough.

My family loved this pizza. It took longer to bake (at 400 degrees it took 35 min to get golden brown).  I followed the crust recipe exactly and I thought the dough was the right amount for a "deep dish" pizza.   I upped the cheese from 1/3 cup per layer to 2/3 cup per layer and will even go a little heavier next time.

Was too bland. I ended up adding. one teaspoon of garlic powder.  one teaspoon oregano. One teaspoon basil. Then I cooked it on a pizza stone. After it was cooked I drizzled garlic butter on the crust and served. Very good.

I cut the dough recipe in half and used a 10' pan but used the same amount of meat and cheese. Honestly, I wasn't overly impressed the first day. But the second, WOW WOW it tasted fantastic.

Im looking forward to making this again and putting a little twist on a few things but this is a great starting point.

This  turned our perfect. I eyeballed my flour and ended up with the perfect amount of dough for my 12 inch pan. I used vegetable oil rather than grapeseed and  I added a bit more garlic salt and also put oregano and garlic salt on the crust once baked. It also took longer to get golden brown. Approx 30 minutes. I will use this recipe again.

The dough was delicious! buttery and soft. But it made waaaay too much! i used some of it to make a breadstick, but my pizza was still extremely thick. I will definitely make this again, I'll just make less dough :)

Dough was super dry when i was mixing it so I added a little extra water and oil.  It rose perfectly and was super easy to spread in my oversized cast iron pan. I should not have used all the dough, crust was very thick! We just used sauce and cheese for toppings, and it took about 35 minutes to cook. Super easy to get out of pan and slice. Will definitely make again.

Used a 14 inch cast iron skillet and still had dough left over for breadsticks.  I misread the garlic salt as garlic powder and it still came out well but you could tell the dough lacked salt and didn't brown.  Used turkey sausage, smoked gouda, sharp cheddar, green olives, onions and garlic because that what was in the house. Also used olive oil in place of the grapeseed oil. We gobbled it up.  Will make again and again and change the toppings.

Very good! I used bread flour instead of plain and did not use all the flour the recipe. Probably should have cut back the yeast amounts too as it made very thick edge! But loved it!

This recipe makes a lot of dough.  The crust was too thick so next time I will make two instead of one.  The flavor was great and it cooked beautifully in the cast iron skillet

Made this - changes.   I used olive oil where butter is called for because I don't think they use butter in Pizzas.  Second, what is the red sticking out of the sides and the green on top, not mentioned in the recipe.  Crust is delicious and cast iron makes anything taste good!!!

I’ve made this dough 5 times now. As suggested it’s enough for two pizzas. I do one in my cast iron and another on a stone. Both are awesome. I use my own ingredients and this recipe for the crust only. It’s always amazing. I also add the butter to the dough last. As it wraps around the dough hook I then add the softened butter and let it run a tad longer. Keeps the sought lighter and creates an easy surface to roll them out.

I never have luck with pizza dough, so the fact that it turned out the first time is a miracle.

I followed the instructions for the dough and did my own thing for the toppings.

For the crust, I used one pack of yeast (assuming this was close to the measured amount in the recipe), and substituted the garlic salt with two teaspoons garlic powder and one teaspoon table salt.

For the toppings, I did more of a Chicago style with tomato sauce on top.  This turned out to be a much better plan since instead of the recommended 25 minutes, it ended up being closer to 50-60 minutes to make sure the crust was completely cooked and the thicker amount of toppings were heated through.

1st pizza dough that I made that turned out edible! Success. I will say  I only used pepperoni and a full 8 oz of cheese.  Also, I made it on a Saturday night, popped it in the fridge and made it Sunday afternoon. I was worried this would affect it, but I let it come to room temp, and popped it in the oven. As others said it took about 40 minutes and was pulling from the sides/done. I took it out as I didn't want to burn it ... the very top layer was still not quite done how I would like it ...so next time 45 minutes. All in all, very straight forward and easy. Oh and I used all my dough in a 12" cast iron skillet ... I thought it was the right amount of dough to pan... nice thick crust when it baked and rose.

Not a favorite.  I am not sure why, maybe the ratio of crust to topping.

This was pretty good-- changed up quite a few things. Used the crust recipe from the "Chicago-Style Deep-Dish Pizza" King Arthur flour website (except I halved it, used the bread machine to make it, and not having corn meal I used a TBSPN from a corn bread mix). Used turkey bacon and added onion, green pepper, mushroom and black olives to it. I really like the cast iron skillet angle here.

I made the recipe exactly as written.  Like others have said, it's a lot of crust!  You could make two pizzas with this amount of dough.  Also, with this recipe the dough has a more bread-like consistency than traditional New York style pizza crust.  Next time I will likely increase the amount of sauce and cheese.

I do not own a mixer so I made the dough in my bread machine. I followed the rest of your recipe and it was wonderful. Thank you for posting it.

Had enough dough to make both a 12 inch and 9 inch pizza thanks to other folks for that suggestion. Tall and thick crust but not too bready for our taste - turned out great!

This was really good my husband me and my 3 year old ate the whole thing in one sitting! I did cut the dough recipe in half as others suggested and thought it was perfect! Im making it again today because it was so easy and yummy and adding a bit more sauce then what is called for cuz i like my pizza saucy!

I used different toppings but found the dough recipe made enough for three 12" pies. The dough was also somewhat mealy and less chewy and crisp than I would like. Perhaps I overkneaded it? Next time I would bake the dough for five minutes before adding toppings as the dough/topping boundary was a bit doughy, but realistically I probably won't make this again.

I used about 2/3 of the dough for pizza in my 10.5" pan, and the rest in an 8" pan for cheese bread with butter, garlic, herbs, and cheese. The smaller one needed about 5 mins less cook time. This is a great quick and easy dough!

I read all the reviews before trying this one and it turned out good. Not great for us though. I took into account the excess dougha Dan planned on making 2 pizzas, one in my 12in skillet and another in my 10in. Made with 'Delicious Pizza Sauce', but toppings were bell pepper, tomato and basil. Plenty of dough for both pizzas. Still came out very thick, but hey, it's supposed to be deep dish!

25 minutes is not enough!! It was a soft, doughy mess. I put it back in for another 30 and it was actually cooked
