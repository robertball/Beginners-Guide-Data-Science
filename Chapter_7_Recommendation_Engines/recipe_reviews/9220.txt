this recipe was simple, quick, and hit with my family & coworkers.
I used canned sweet potatoes, and it came out great, 1 one pound can with this recipe.
I added a dash of vanilla extract just for kicks. I made this recipex3 to make enough, then
when I had left overs I scooped it into a graham cracker crust with fresh marshmallows on top,baked @350 degrees until marshmallows are light brown, the pie was a hit too.

DELICIOUS!!!  I got many compliments on this at the Thanksgiving table. 3 hours after dinner was over my sister went back to heat up more of this!  I made the recipe as is, but I added a "streusel" topping - mix 1 cup packed brown sugar, 1/2 cup all-purpose flour, 3/4 cup Quaker quick cooking oats with 1/2 cup softened butter until it is like coarse crumbs and sprinkle this over the marshmallows.  It tastes just like the Sweet Potatoes at Boston Market! I also covered mine with foil and baked for 10 min., then uncovered and baked an additional 5 min, so some marshmallows had melted but most of them got toasty.  The only change I would make next time is to add some milk when mashing the sweet potatoes - I would have liked them creamier...all in all extremely yummy.......I will make this at Christmas too! ('05)
P.S. Thanksgiving '07- I used this with 3 cans of canned yams this year to save time.....worked great!!!

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and it was good but didn't seem to wow anyone. I agree with the other reviews about that "orangey" taste -- it just wasn't something that many people warmed up to. If I made them again I would nix the orange juice as well. I tried a diff recipe for Christmas and overall it was a much bigger hit with the same people.

Very easy to make. I used canned potatoes and it turned out well. Next time though I will use a little less orange juice. Found it a little to prominent in the overall taste. My family loved this recipe.

I made this dish for Thanksgiving last year and was looking for it again for this year's menu and realized I hadn't rated it!  Of course it was wonderful or we wouldn't be coming back to this recipe.  I loved a lot of things about it -- you can add anything, coconut, pecans, or just keep it as is and it will be great.  You could use a little less sugar, but we are used to the sweetness of this recipe with our traditional Thanksgiving dinner.  

My absolute favorite part of this recipe is no eggs!  I hate the eggy taste in some casseroles and this one holds together just right with no eggs.  Great for people with allergies too.  Thanks for this recipe which will be making it's second Thanksgiving appearance with my family!

Wow, really yummy! I added some graham crackers, brown sugar and butter to make a crunchy topping.  I also only used 1/2 the bag of marshmallows.

I'm wavering between three and four stars, but I decided to err on the side of generosity. :) I made some changes to the directions which I find easier: cut the tops and bottoms of the sweet potatoes and bake them on a cookie sheet in your oven for about an 1 hour and 30 min. No need to preheat the oven, just turn it directly to 350. Once they come out of the oven and cool a bit, take the skin off by slicing the skin (which should have sort of separated from the potato) down the middle (like you would a hot dog bun) and peeling it off.  I think it's so much easier to take the skin of after you bake them. From there, mash them up with the sugar, butter (I used about 3 Tbsp), orange juice, and cinnamon. Follow the rest of the directions from here. :) Bake for approx. 20 minutes in the preheated 350 F oven. Yummy.

I did not care for the consistancy of this, but I did use a hand mixer to "blend" the mixture. If I had just mashed them slightly it would have possibly been better.
This was way too sweet. All sweet potato casseroles will be sweet. The key is to get the ingredients, textures, and flavors to blend to a sweetness which compliment each other. This was not so. Sorry!

Excellent recipe.  This was my sister's dish to bring over on Thanksgiving, but she's moved away and didn't join us this year.  I was very happy to come across your recipe. My sister's ingredients were the same, but I didn't have the exact measurements to prepare.    Now I can continue the traditional sweet potato casserole for Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners. (The only thing I added was a pinch of vanilla extract.)

The reason I rated it low for Kid Friendly was that my 8 year old daughter and her 4 & 6 year old cousins wouldn't touch it since it was "orange and mushy."  I'm sure if they would have tried it they would have loved it.

This was pretty good but I don't really like the "orange" flavor in the potatoes.  If I make this again, I'm nixing the orange juice.

Oh what a delicious dish! We adore sweet potatoes around here and eat them at least once a week in various forms. I made this recipe for Thanksgiving the first time, and it was just awesome. The only changes I made were to add some powdered ginger, and to use a potato masher to mix everything up, because we like a few lumps. So yummy, and good for you!

This is a classic holiday favorite! I think it's so much easier to bake the yams until fork-tender, about 25 minutes, rather than boil them because then the skin just comes right off. I mash them up with the ¼ tsp. of cinnamon, 1/8 tsp. of nutmeg, ¾ cup of packed light brown sugar, ¼ cup of real butter and 3T. of fresh squeezed orange juice. Lastly, I sprinkled a layer of crushed pecans on top of the sweet potatoes and mini-marshmallows. I place the sweet potatoes back in the oven and bake at 350 degrees for 2 to 3 minutes until the mini-marshmallows melt and becomes slightly golden brown. The yams are always sweet and creamy, the marshmallow topping is nicely toasted, ooey and gooey- a nice touch. The crunchy pecans and brown sugar topping which adds a nice carmelized crunchy texture on the top of the sweet potatoes! The orange juice gives a nice layer of flavor! The yams (sweet potatoes) are high in fiber so I indulged with absolutely no guilt!

I made this for Thanksgiving.  I omitted the orange juice per other reader's suggestions and I forgot to put the butter into the potatoes so I put it on top of the potatoes, which was a mistake!  It didn't blend in.  However, my family LOVED it and they were raving over it all night.  Will be making this again for sure!

Made this for Thanksgiving for my parents, followed the directions exactly, but it wasn't well received. I think for out family, it was just the spices. Normally the sweet potatoes are prepared without spice and I didn't realize since I never actually eat them. Thanks for the recipe, might just have to try it out on them another time.

My picky eaters loved this!. I did it for Thanksgiving and will be doing it again this weekend with a ham just because it was so easy to do. I used frozen sweet potato cubes and did mine without the marshmallows but with some extra brown sugar crumbled on top (only a tiny bit). (We're not marshmallow eaters here.) It was a huge hit.

I made this for Thanksgiving, used canned sweet potatoes with syrup and all other ingredients...No one in my family cares for sweet potatoes so of course everyone frowned when i put this dish out...It was fantabulous!! It was gone, I wish I wouldve made more, I was so proud of this recipe!! Thanks Stephanie!

I made this for Thanksgiving this year.  I got lots of compliments on it.  It was very easy to prepare.  I made it the day before and baked just before serving time.  It will be a regular!

Delicious!  Very easy to make.  My roommate, however, was a bit disappointed that it wasn't the "real" kind that's baked in the oven for hours...

Very nice for Thanksgiving dinner. Good basic recipe that I have been making for years. Next time though: use less sugar and a touch of nutmeg. Also my 2 "pinches" of cinnamon were a little overpowering. (how much IS a pinch?)

This recipe is great! I couldn't find vegetarian marshmallows so I followed "MomSavedByGrace"'s suggestion and made a streusel topping, and it was fabulous! The brown sugar made it just sweet enough and the addition of pecans gave it a bit of crunch.

Leave out the orange juice and you have the perfect straight-up sweet potato dish! On theory the flavors SHOULD be good together, but in practice it's just a little off. Without it, though - homey goodness on a spoon, covered in marshmallows... what's not to love?! I use one 29oz can, smoosh them up with a potato masher (leaving some lumps) and add back approx 1/4 - 1/3 cup of the canned syrup until they're not quite so stiff. I'm pretty generous with the "cinnamon" (which in my house is actually pumpkin pie spice) - a good 5-6 shakes. With one can, you'll fill a pie plate rather than a 9x13 dish. I'm dying to try the streusel topping that MomSavedByGrace added to her review, but it's definitely yummy without it!

I love sweet potato casserole.  Especially at Thanksgiving.  I used this recipe as a starting point to create my own.  I used all of the basic ingredients, added more cinnamon (I couldn't tell you how much, I just added until I was happy with the taste) a bit of ginger, nutmeg, honey, and honey-roasted almonds for added texture.  I also sprinkled a layer of the almonds on top and then covered it all with marshmallows.  I tossed about a handful of the almonds on top for good measure and presentation.  Instead of baking until the marshmallows were golden-brown, I ROASTED the casserole (roasting cooks from the top of the oven, so it took less time to toast the marshmallows to perfection).  Thanks for your recipe!  :)

OMG! So easy & so good! I too omitted the orange juice and added a pinch of nutmeg and a dash of vanilla.  I love the crunch on the marshmallows as well.  Super yummy!  Thanks for a great no-fail recipe!

Used this recipe for Christmas and it was a big hit - I received may compliments and was asked for the recipe. Very easy to make and the marshmallows were a nice addition. I did not use the whole bag of marshmallows, though!

Used this recipe for Christmas and it was a big hit - I received may compliments and was asked for the recipe. Very easy to make and the marshmallows were a nice addition. I did not use the whole bag of marshmallows, though!

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving...I used 3 one pound cans of cut sweet potatoes instead of fresh ones because I was in a hurry. I kept measurements and all the same, but I did only use 1/2 a bag of marshmallows.  Not many people at the meal normally like sweet potatoes but the ones that do, ate it and said it was pretty good.  My son said it tasted like pie.

Recipe is quick, easy and unfussy (although I dulled my potato peeler).  The dish was too sweet for my taste, so I may try again with half the sugar and marshmallows.  I used about half a cup of o.j. which I found just right; I may even try 3/4 cup next time.

OH YES!!!   I loved this recipe.  No changes what so ever.  
The citris flavor does surprise you but it is so light tasting in your mouth instead of heavy/overpowering like a traditional sp casserole. 
YUM and Thank YOU for sharing.

Yummy and sweet recipe!  I will probably cut back on the brown sugar and butter next time though, and I only added 1 tbsp of the juice, but still a great recipe with minimal ingredients!

This is awesome! Didn't measure the brown sugar or OJ, just did them to taste. It is WAY more than 8 servings though. Everyone went back for seconds & we still had tons of leftovers! I will say this though: people use "yams" and "sweet potatoes" interchangably and they are not! They are two different things. If you want the pretty orange casserole like the pictures show you want to use yams. Sweet potatoes barely have more color than a normal potato. I used 1/2 of each as I like the orange, but sweet potatoes are supposed to be better health wise.

What I liked the most about this recipe was that I was able to put it together ahead of time and just pop into the oven when the turkey came out. As a time saver, I used a 40 oz can of sweet potatoes. While I do not like sweetened potatoes, this went over well on our Thanksgiving table.

So Good!  I omitted the orange juice and marshmallows, but added sea salt.  The salt really pulled out the flavor of the potato, and the sugar and cinnamon was just the right touch of sweet.

not my cup-o-tea.   My mom always makes just sweet potatos out of the can on the stove top with brown sugar. So they are big chunks in a sweet sauce.  I wanted to try something different, and I will not do that again, for sweet potatos at least.  I didn't like the consistancy.  I took the suggestion of mashing instead of blending and it didn't help much, kindof dry and bland.

Good. But you need an extra sweet potato, another 1/4 cup of brown sugar, gotta use real butter!, 2 tsp of cinnamon, add pecan chips over the top and bake the mixture alone for 35-40 minutes before adding the mallows and baking for an additional 10... try it ;)

This is the first time in my entire life that I've EVER liked sweet potatoes! This was delicious even before I baked it! I added pure vanilla extract like one reviewer suggested, and it was deLISH! This is the easiest and tastiest sweet potato dish I've ever tried. Thank you!

turned out a little mushy, like baby food. Will try and firm up next time by mashing the potatoes instead of blending them.

This is a great recipe.  Last year, I made it as is, and got rave reviews.  This year, I increased the cinnamon to 1/2 tsp, added 1/2 tsp vanilla, and added "a few pinches" of nutmeg.  Delightful!!

When you add the "Streusel topping" suggested by Momsavedbygrace this is a 5 star recipe every time.  This will be my second year making this recipe for the family holidays and it is always a hit.

Oops, there are two Sweet Potato Casserole II by 
Stephanie Phillips & Kraney's review is on the other one. Sorry. The only change I made was using red garnet yams and less brown sugar (to taste). Family loved it.

This casserole is amazing, I am not big on eating leftovers and I ate this for 5 days! I did add 1/2 cup of chopped pecans to the potato mixture to give it some crunch. This was a hit with my entire family, even the 18 month old loved it!

Very good. I made this for Thanksgiving. It was wonderful. I added a splash of orange extract as well as the orange juice to give it a little more citrus flavor. I also didn't whip the potatoes, I just lightly mashed them because our family likes them chunky. Excellent recipe...will make this again - every year.

Really good recipe.  Next time I will cut back on the orange juice to 1 tablespoon as it was a bit too "orangy" for our taste and increase the margarine to compensate.  Served this with the Fruity Grilled Pork Tenderloin and applesauce on the side, and it made for a delicious dinner!  Will be making both these recipes again.

I never had sweet potatoes mashed before.  I had only ever had them in chunks.  I LOVED this and will never eat chunky sweet potatoes again.  Mashed is the way to go!!! Everyone loved this.  I will probably continue to make this each Thanksgiving and maybe throughout the year!!!  I didn't have orange juice on hand, so I used apple. I used canned yams instead of peeling and slicing the sweet potatoes. SO SO easy.  It was great - the best sweet potato recipe ever.

I used this recipe as a guide so I'm giving it 5 stars because it was close enough. Just a word of advice! You know the whole Thanksgiving day mad dash to the finish line? Well do not take this (or any other marshmallows topped recipe) straight out of the oven, cover it in tinfoil  to avoid messy spills in the car and/or to keep it piping hot if you're taking it to another destination. When I uncovered what was a masterpiece out of the oven, it was a molten mess with a few marshmallows floating around on top. I've always thrown the marshmallows on top of the mixture & browned them off under the broiler once I reach my destination in the previous 50+ years I've been cooking. It was so dumb!!! Don't know if anyone else has made this mistake, lol :) but you've been warned!

Simple. Classic . I added a bit of vanilla extract, more light brown sugar (Instead of half a cup, I used 1 cup)a dash of nutmeg and about 2 1/2 tablespoons of orange juice.  This turned out to be awesome. I added more sugar only because I doubled the amount of sweet potatoes.

I love this recipe!! It was very simple and easy to follow. The only tweeks I made was to add a splash more of orange juice which enhances the flavor, 1/3 cup more of brown sugar to decrease the bitterness, and sprinkled a little more cinnamon to where it was just enough, not overpowering. But I will definitely be incorporating this more in the future.

I did a test run before taking it to a Holiday feast, and with the marshmallows in addition to the brown sugar, it was too sweet for me, and I have a pretty big sweet tooth.  When I make it for the feast, I will leave out the brown sugar altogether, add salt, and drastically reduce the number of marshmallows used.

When I make it for the feast, I will leave out the brown sugar altogether, add salt, and drastically reduce the number of marshmallows used.

I loved it and so did my whole entire family (all picky eaters)! It tasted more like a dessert than a side dish. I'm happy to say there are leftovers.

This is the exact recipe I grew up with!  The only thing my mom adds is 1/4 cup crushed pineapple (strained).  I went above that and add a dash of nutmeg and fold in a few handfuls of fresh cranberries in there too.

SO DELICIOUS!

It was a great base.. But I did 1/4 of the marshmallows, and omitted the orange juice. Just cause I didn't want for it to be sooo sweet and desert like.. By not putting so much of the marshmallows i was able to control the sweetness of it.

Very easy and delicious.  Highly recommend that you go with fresh sweet potatos.  Little effort for a delicious pay-off.  I forgot the orange juice and didn't miss it a bit.  Will add nuts next time, I think.

Yummo! I think I may be in love with these sweet potatoes! The orange juice really gave them that extra something :) I also sprinkled the top with a bit of brown sugar,  cinnamon and nutmeg. So happy to have this recipe for future meals! (I also baked the whole potatoes instead of boiling, it was easier that way - the skin just pulled right off and I sliced them before mashing.)

I cut corners and used a 2 pound can of yams ( aprox size). I was happy with the results! When I have more time I will use fresh may try a topping also.

Great recipe. I added a pinch of nutmeg and used pineapple juice in place of orange juice. I baked my sweet potatoes whole instead of boiling them, much more convenient when cooking multiple recipes at once. Also you can bake them the night before!!! Love these Traditional recipes.

Easy to follow directions.  Tasted good but not great.  I will add more cinnamon next time.

this was fantastic and just as I remember Sweet Potato Casserole should taste!  I didn't use orange juice as recommended by other reviewers.  I also added some vanilla and used 2 cans of sweet potatoes instead to save my sanity.  It came out perfect!  This is definitely going in my recipe box.  Thank you for the basics!

This is the best Sweet Potato Casserole I have made. Two years ago I couldn't find my old stand-by recipe for Thanksgiving so I used this one.  This year my nephew heard that I might not make this for Thanksgiving dinner and he started to cry! Obviously it was a hit the first time around. I did make it again this year, and everyone loved it. The only modifications I make are that I use butter instead of margarine, and I throw in a pinch of nutmeg and a pinch of salt. Delicious.

I thought that this recipe was very good, however the family said it wasn't sweet enough. I also omitted the orange juice because of some of the other reviews. Again I thought this was very tasty.

This recipe has been a family favorite and a tradition for many years.  The OJ gives it a bit of tang, but the butter and brown sugar give it something special....and the marshmallows - well!?!  Our family likes this better than candied yams

These were really delicious.  The splash of OJ keeps them from being too sweet.  My father-in-law is not a huge fan of sweet potatoes and he loved them.  Will continue to use this recipe.  Thanks!

My family loved this recipe.  It was simple to make, I actually used a can of yams which had been in sweetened syrup and I added a small can of crushed pineapple.  .  One of the comments was that it was "very sweet".  I think that's because of the yams being packed in syrup.  But, my point is, this was super easy to make and was a big hit with my family.  I will use this recipe again, and again, and again.......

Delicious! I wanted it to be more of a souffle style, so I added 2 eggs and 1/4 cup of evaporated milk. Will definitely make this again!

Absolutely delicious. I used half the orange juice it called for and added a bit of vanilla extract, but otherwise kept it the same.

This recipe was okay.  I'm unsure why it calls for orange juice.  It kind of takes over the flavor.  Thank you for posting the recipe.

A word of caution.  Do not use colored marshmallows as I did one year. Simply easy recipe that always tastes great.
Oh, also if you cheat and use canned sweet potatoes, DRAIN them first!

This dish reminds me so much of Texas Roadhouse's loaded sweet potatoes! The first time I made with the exact ingredients. Like other reviewers, I was turned off by the orange-y taste so I leave the juice out. As sweet potatoes raw are hard to peel, we cut them in half and boil them with their skins, then after they cool, the skin peels right off. This is a new favorite holiday dish.

Omg. It was so easy and so good. I did add two spoonfuls of sugar. I microwaved the pots. Scooped out the inside. Smashed with a fork added rest, mixed, poured in dish added marshmallows and baked.  So good.

Another great recipe. When I make it again though, I'm going to cut back on the Orange juice. I could REALLY taste it in the finished product here. Not bad, just not the flavor I was ultimately going for.

By far, my favorite sweet potato casserole recipe.  Instead of boiling, I baked the sweet potatoes as I had other things to do in the kitchen.  This was a time-saver as I only had to split them open and scoop them out.  They weren't too sweet.  My husband actually liked them where he normally does not care for them.

I made this recipe on Thanksgiving because it looked easy. And everyone loved it so much that I made it for Christmas and now am making it for Easter. The only thing I did different was bake the sweet potatoes whole in the oven. I find that boiling them 1 is more work and more importantly dilutes the flavor of the sweet potatoes. I baked them at 375 for about 30 mins give or take once they cool enough to handle I am able to easily peel the skin right off. I also don't measure each ingredient as I think if you do it will mask the real flavor of the potatoes and find that squeezing and zesting a fresh orange right in lightens the sometimes heavy sweet potato casserole. I will make this whenever asked to bring a dish to a large family dinner because it seriously is so easy to make and all seem to enjoy it!!

My boys and I loved this (hubby isn't a fan of marshmallows so his review doesn't count :D ) Added some Allspice (like we do in our sweet potato pies) and omitted the orange juice the second time around. Great dish to bring to family get togethers!

I did this for Thanksgiving this year.  First of all, I do not care for sweet potatoes but it seems that everyone looks for this as a side dish, so I decided to use this recipe.  I have to say that it was the hit of the dinner, everyone loved it.  There was no left overs for this dish. The only thing that I may have done differently was that I made this dish the night before and reheated it. I will keep this recipe and make it for Christmas as well.

Delish! I've always been a HUGE fan of sweet potatoes covered in toasty marshmallows (mmmm...). It's been a family tradition for as long as I can remember. Every bite of this was like taking a trip down (childhood) memory lane. :) My only (minor) gripe is that this was not sweet enough for my liking (yes, I like SWEET potatoes!). My potatoes were quite large, so this could be the reason why. To compensate, I added ~ 1/4 c. additional sugar, another T or so of OJ and a t of pure vanilla. NOTE: For those of you who don't care for "stringy" sweet potatoes, use a mixer to combine them with everything else. All the strings will "wrap" themselves around the beaters. Just be sure to NOT scrape after beating! Thanks for sharing your recipe, Stephanie! This is and always will be one of my holiday favorites! :-)

Excellent!  Loved the flavors.  I used about 1 tsp of orange zest instead of orange juice just because I didn't have any.  Worked great.  I also used allspice, extra cinnamon, and the streusel topping like other reviews and loved it!  Thanks so much!

Excellent!  Loved the flavors.  I used about 1 tsp of orange zest instead of orange juice just because I didn't have any.  Worked great.  I also used allspice, extra cinnamon, and the streusel topping like other reviews and loved it!  Thanks so much!

I started making this on my own a few years ago after having it at a party. However, like some I did not care for the orange taste and replaced it with molassas. This gave it a smoky flavor and my family really likes it.

This was so good. I didn't have regular marshmallows, but Halloween ghost ones. My kids(4&6)loved it they only tried it because they thought the ghosts were so cool!

I tried this recipe this Thanksgiving and loved it.  My variations: I mashed the potatoes instead of whipping, used fresh orange juice for a very nice subtle taste, and added 1/2 cup raisins just for fun.

I myself truly loved this recipe for thanksgiving this year.  My oldest son loved it. Not sure about other members of the family.  I have one son who is Autistic and is very picky regarding food and texture.  I found myself eating it as a dessert it one point.  I did find though that the marshmallows on top were a bit chewy if not warmed up again.

Personally, I don't like sweet potatoes very much, but my family adored the dish! I added the streusel topping that another reviewer suggested - it really made the dish. I also only used 1/2 a tbs. orange juice, threw in a splash of heavy cream, and added a little extra cinnamon - we are cinnamon fanatics in my family!  I baked it covered in foil for 15min at 350 degrees and then broiled it, uncovered, for a couple of minutes to brown the marshmallows. Delicious!! Thanks for the simple recipe!

Fantastic!  Tastes just like the sweet potatoes at Boston Market, which I love!  I used the streusel topping that MomsavedbyGrace suggested in her review.  I also deleted the o.j. and added a splash of vanilla and a few pinches of nutmeg.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  It's a keeper.

The best sweet potatoes I've ever made; even my husband, who doesn't like s.p.'s liked them.  I used fresh orange juice from half an orange, and didn't mash the potatoes (it's hard enough to keep them from being too heavy anyway, I thought the chunky texture would help out) but had them cut into 1/2 - 1" chunks, and added about 1/4 c cream to the brown sugar and butter sauce, and went light on the marshmellows.  Very pleasant flavor, not heavy as some can be.  This will be my go-to recipe from now on.

A little brown sugar and cinnamon makes everything taste better :-)
I cut out the butter and they still tasted great.

Excellent, easy recipe. Took it to Christmas Dinner and everyone loved it-from the 5 year old to the 65 year old. Definitely will use it again

This rating comes from others who I served this dish to since I do not care for sweet potatoes.  I am not sure they were being completely honest though as only a little portion of the casserole was eaten!  One of the problems, could have been my fault.  I did not have any plain cinnamon so I used pumpkin pie spice.  I thought that perhaps the mixture of spices would give it good flavor.  I had one person comment that they didn't care for the spices very much.  That it almost tasted bitter.  I explained that it was probably the nutmeg in the pumpkin pie spice and they agreed that was probably it.  So, just using cinnamon may have helped but I still don't think much more of it would have been eaten.  I am done trying sweet potatoe casserole as this is the second year in a row and second recipe that has just not been a hit with my family.

This was pretty good.  But as is usual for recipes in allrecipes, it is pretty sweet.  I cut the sugar in half and used a whole lot more cinnamon and it turned out pretty good.
