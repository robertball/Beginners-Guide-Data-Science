Whoa, did I ever eat this right up!  This is not your everyday, ordinary, boring Mexican rice!  For once I enjoyed something with real flavor rather than the nondescript stuff I’ve pretty much learned to expect.  I don’t know, maybe it’s because I used a good squirt of concentrated tomato paste from the tube because I didn’t want to open up a can of tomato sauce for the couple of tablespoons I needed for the half recipe I made.  I also used chicken stock instead of water and chicken bouillon but I don’t think that can account for how flavorful this was.  I didn’t use the Serrano pepper in deference to Hubs’ sensitive innards but it truly wasn’t missed.  Maybe it’s because the rice is browned before simmering.  Whatever the case, viv85e has come up with a Mexican recipe that’s well worth repeating.

This is the best Mexican rice dish that I've ever made. I didn't have chicken bouillon so I used 1 cup chicken broth in place of 1 cup of the water. Using the serrano pepper whole really did make for nice flavor without being too hot.

This was really good -- as good or maybe even better than many of the authentic Mexican restaurants we have here in TX. As another reviewer mentioned, though, mine also turned out a bit more watery than I'm used to, and I also like my rice a bit on the dry side (just a personal preference). Letting the rice sit for 5 minutes after it's done helped, though. The best part is that it's easy to make this vegetarian-friendly by omitting the bouillon and substituting one cup of the water for a cup of veggie broth or one of the many varieties of vegetarian "chicken" broth.

I love Mexican food, and as a native Texan I can attest that this is the real deal.  I used brown rice since that's all I had on hand, so I had to simmer it longer.  I also added fresh jalapeno slices instead of the whole serrano which gave it great flavor AND the kick I wanted.  In addition, I think I went a little heavy handed on the tomato sauce (not recommended for next time) and omitted the salt (highly recommended).
Everyone knows you have to "fry" Mexican rice before boiling it, so I had high hopes for this dish and it delivered.  It makes a LOT of rice, which is fine because although I originally served it with homemade pork tamales from a sweet neighborhood abuelita, I have used some of the leftovers to stuff bell peppers (mixed with leftover "Best Black Beans" by Cameron on this site) much to the delight of my fiance.  And there is still some rice left!
Follow the instructions, but don't be afraid to add peppers to the pot not just to discard but to mix into the rice depending on your personal taste.  Thanks for sharing... this is going into my regular rotation!

Excellent rice.  Just what I was looking for.  None of the flavors were over powering.  I hate when people change the recipe and rate it, but this time I did make one change.  I wanted a little more rice so I added an additional 1/2 cup.  Next time, I would do the same, and the only other tip would be to lessen the amount of salt.  I would cut the salt in half.  I don't think it needed that much, and I'd rather add more salt, if desired, at the end, because you certainly can't take it out then.  Yummy, the whole family loved it.

Delicious! Perfect rice. There are many Mexican rice recipes out there. THIS is the one that's spot on to the best of the family-run restaurants I used to visit when I lived in San Diego. Really, if you want authentic Mexican rice, look no further, you've found it!

In place of tomato sauce, I used some mild red salsa and also tossed in some peas and carrots.

This is essentially the same recipe I grew up eating and learned from my mother, who learned it from hers. We're California-Texas Mexican-Americans, so I can call this authentic and delicious.

Look no further for an authentic Mexican rice recipe, this is it. My mother ran a very successful Mexican restaurant with my aunt in chihuahua Mexico for many years before marrying my dad and this is the recipe she uses to this day. I have never had a better tasting rice in any wannabe Mexican restaurant here in the states. She adjusted the recipe for my brothers who won't eat onions without loosing flavor. Instead of sautéing the onions, she blends it with a clove of garlic and a quarter cup of water and adds it along with the water. This eliminates the use of garlic powder and uses the healthier option of real garlic. If you are out of tomato sauce, you can also blend a fresh tomato to the onion and garlic mixture. We never add pepper and cumin though, the chicken bullion and salt should be plenty of flavor. Taste the broth once all the liquid an spice has been added to the fried rice before it is absorbed, this will be a great time to taste test for flavor, if any is needed add more, if it has too much, add more water. A can of mixed veggies can also be added at this point, we always use peas and carrots.

This was tasy and very easy. I am latina and like a lot of flavor and this dish was flavorful. I used brown rice instead of white since we are trying to eat healthier dishes. If I make it in the future with white rice, I would probably cut down on the water because otherwise 2-1/2 cups of water would make the rice soupy, which I do not like. I used a red hot chili pepper (whole) from our garden and it was not super spicy at all. Just mild amount of heat. I did not use salt since the chicken bouillon is salty enough (i used one cube). cooked it in a rice cooker and it turned out perfect!

This is wonderful rice. Added a can of diced tomatoes, just because I love it in Mexican rice, and a whole onion.  I also used a second serrano, and I'm glad I did. You can definitely taste the pepper without getting much heat. Was a bit heavy handed with the cumin, but not too much.  The key is toasting the rice before adding the liquid, adds a lot of flavor and coating each grain with the oil makes for a really great texture. Make sure to get the rice brown. I also "bloomed" the spices before adding the liquid. Used stock instead of water+bouillon, and only 2 cups. This really has a deep, well balanced flavor with a very nice texture.  I'm keeping this one.

I made this exactly as written.  Very tasty, salt level was fine, and much milder than I expected; makes a nice compliment to a spicier main dish.   Not sure the serrano pepper imparted a lot of flavor overall so I probably wouldn't go out of my way to add it next time unless I wanted to chop the pepper and kick up the heat a little bit.  Thanks, nice recipe!

I scaled this recipe up for 16, and it was wonderful. Made it just as written, a d everyone loved it, even a couple that are very critical of food. Next time I will open the Serrano chilies for a little more spice as stated, but it was wonderful. I cannot wait to make it again. Thanks for the best rice ever!

This is a fantastic rice!  I went with my instincts and doubled the cumin and halved the salt.  It would have been far too salty for us and our toddler especially.  The bouillon provides plenty of salt.  Skipped the serrano since I hadn't realized mine were no longer fresh enough.  With these changes, I think this is the new go-to Mexi-rice recipe for our house!  I'll have to try it with the chile next time.

The flavors here were good, but far too salty, and I felt like the bouillon came on a little strong. (I used reduced-sodium Better Than Bouillon; maybe I should have used a different kind, but that was what I had!) Next time I make it, I'll omit the extra tablespoon of salt, as well as one of the tablespoons of oil, since my final product was a bit oily. Also, I used brown rice, and as usual, this recipe took far longer to cook than plain brown rice would. I would allow at least an hour; I let ours cook for 55 minutes and it was still a bit crunchy. (This might also have made the oiliness worse, and if so, that's all my fault!) I also only used 2 cups of water, which is my usual rice-to-water ratio, but next time I'll try it as written. There will be a next time, though; I liked the flavors enough to try it again. Thanks!

Ok, the 1st time I made this, per 1 reviewer I skipped the serrano pepper because I didn't have one. Truly a mistake! It adds sooo much flavor and NO heat (if kept whole)! I've been looking for a Mexican rice recipe for years, this one ends my search. And my husband, knowing I like to tweak things, said "don't change a thing!" It is even better than Filibertos or most restaurants here in Phoenix, AZ. Oh, and be sure to follow the cooking method exactly, you won't have wet rice! I always double this one.

I doubled up on the ingredients and substituted the water for chicken broth and substituted one of those cups with a can of La Costeña homestyle Mexican Salsa and instead of the bullion added a packet of Sazón Goya con azafran and fresh garlic and it is to die for!

This is a keeper. I replaced the tomato sauce with Picante sauce. That is what I had opened in the fridge. It is by far the best Mexican rice I have ever made or ever have eaten. Thank you for sharing your recipe!

This rice was good, probably the best Mexican rice I've made at home.  I used a 4 oz. can of diced green chilies instead of the serrano pepper.  I thought it was going to be too dry by the end of the 15 minutes, so I added a little chicken broth.

This is fabulous!!!!!! I made it with oregano and cilantro, but the serrano pepper was the kicker. It was better than any Mexican restaurant rice I've ever eaten. Thank you!!

I used long grain brown rice (not instant) and it took forever to cook!!!  As in, probably close to 90 minutes, maybe even longer.  The rest of the meal was long gone and dishes cleared before this was ready to eat, and even then it was al-dente.  I'm sure some of it was my fault because I kept removing the lid to check it every 5-10 minutes after the initial 35 minutes had passed and it was still super crunchy.  I also had to add a lot more liquid (used some vegetable stock i had on hand) or it would have completely dried out since it cooked so long.  Despite all of that, I liked the flavor a lot, and it was really easy so I will make it again.  I'll just have to use a different type of rice or start dinner at the crack of dawn. :-). Thank you for sharing the recipe--it really was tasty, and not the recipe's fault I used a long cooking rice.

O.K. so it usually annoys me when people review a recipe when they haven't followed it but... I had to. This rice is awesome! And thats without the onion & chili pepper. Didn't have it but really wanted mexican rice to go with my shredded chicken tacos. I have made dozens of recipes for this kind of rice and never liked any of them. This one is light & fluffy and flavored just right. Like my favorite mexican restaurant. I can't wait to try it with the onion & peppers! 
Just try it. Its sooooo easy!

I made this in bulk for a work potluck/ freezable leftovers.
I read a few reviews and concluded with this:

I minced a large yellow onion, Jalapeno (2), Serrano Pepper (3),  1 tbsp Black Pepper, 3 tbsp Cumin, 4 tbsp light olive oil, and fried with the rice before adding the stock and plain tomato sauce (2 Cups) and then followed the cooking instructions.
I used 4 cups of white long grain rice, 6-7 cups of chicken stock instead of water.

Yes it made  a ton, but i have enough for the 14 people/meals, and it is a huge hit. Thanks everyone for putting a spin on this dish and making suggestions.

Who knew it was this easy to make authentic Spanish rice! This recipe was great! I made as is with the Knorr chicken bouillon cubes and the Serrano pepper. I chose to not de-seed and chop the Serrano, but next time I will for sure. This finally ended my search for a Spanish rice. Gracias Maria!

I added some corn I had, and having no tomato sauce on hand I subbed store-bought salsa. I used beef bouillon because it's all I had, and besides I was serving this with carne asada.... Perfect accompaniment.

This turned out great!  I used two small Serrano peppers and actually three cheese pasta sauce (no tomato sauce on hand).  Also, I found the rice was done much sooner than the recipe said.  Yummy addition to any Mexican or Spanish meal!

The only rice recipe you'll EVER NEED! I've been making this once a week for the past couple years and it's the BOMB every time. My friends and family devour it. The pepper gives it a subtle flavor, and you can play around with the spices, etc. just as long as you utilize the correct amount of liquid. I've made a lemon version and an Indian-spiced version. Super versatile.

This is a good recipe. Easy and fast. I did decide to make it last minute, so I didn't have everything. I threw in some ketchup in place of the tomato sauce and used 2 bouillon cubes instead of the T of bouillon. I also reduced the amount of salt to 1 t. (and will probably reduce it a touch more next go round). I didn't have peppers so I tossed in some frozen peas. Yum!

This was delicious. My boyfriend said its just like his mom used to make who is from Mexico. I did use brown rice so I cooked it a little longer. Also, I personally would use less salt but my boyfriend thought the salt was perfect. I guess it comes down to personal preference. This is going to be my go to recipe for Spanish rice.

This came out great!!! I'm always trying to find the perfect Mexican rice recipe to compare to what my Mexican mother and aunts made in the past and this comes very close. My husband enjoyed it so much that he didn't want to share. hahaha.... I did use a Jalapeno over Serrano because that's what I had on hand but it came out great!

This rice was really good. I used chicken stock instead of water and had a jalapeño pepper on hand and used it instead of the one recommended. My mom who is the pickiest eater I know loved it. Will definitely be making this again.

I made as directed and it wasnt great. Next time I will definitely reduce the liquid to 1 cup of Chicken broth. Making as instructed leaves it way too mushy for my liking and that was even in a rice cooker.

I have made this recipe many times and it never disappoints! Do not skip any steps in the recipe and use the Serrano pepper, it adds great flavor without any heat. Also, instead of using the chicken bouillon, I substituted chicken stock in place of the water, simply because I don't use bouillon.

This rice is so yummy and my family loves it.  I've made it in a rice cooker and I've also made it with precooked rice I had as leftovers.  (I adjusted the water as a result) and it turned out great!  Awesome and authentic recipe.

I enjoyed this recipe. The only changes that I made were that I substituted the water and bullion with chicken stock and prepared it in the rice cooker. 

Next time I would add some extra cumin, beans and maybe a little corn to make it a bit more hearty because my daughter didn't like it (because of the tomato sauce) and then I can have the leftovers as a meal on its own.

Wow! This was a delicious recipe! I continued to add salt, pepper, and cumin to taste as it finished simmering and also added chipotle chili powder to give it some more spice. It seemed very watery at first but I let it sit for about 5-10 minutes before serving and the rice soaked it all up. I used brown rice as well so that is probably one of the reasons for the issue. Overall this was a huge hit and I will definitely make it again!

This is exactly how I like Mexican rice. It's simple and flavorful. I don't want peas and carrots in my Mexican rice! I'm not sure why people are having issues with too much water leftover, mine has come out perfectly every time. Maybe the type of rice? I use the Calrose. Anyway, thank you! I moved to California from South Texas and this rice tastes like home.

I love this recipe! I usually use a jalapeno pepper chopped up into it.. a little fresh lime and chopped cilantro on top. DELICIOUS!

I made this for dinner and my husband said I should get this brand again at the store. He was surprised that I had made it from scratch. It isn't difficult to make and it's yummy. I really scored with this recipe.

Woah!! This rice was amazing! 
I did sub salsa for the tomato sauce just because it's what I had on hand. But this recipe is definitely a keeper.

I tried so many recipes looking for the perfect Mexican Rice, and I ended my search here. This is, hands down, the BEST rice I've ever had. My picky husband can't even eat rice at Mexican food places anymore, because he says, "It doesn't even compare to your rice." Usually at restaurants, the rice is just bland and so-so...it's just kinda there on the plate. But this rice steals the show. I make it exactly as written, and it is PERFECT. Try this one, and you won't regret it!

Made the rice exactly as in the recipe. The only thing that got changed is that I did not have tomato sauce. Instead I used 1/2 can of Campbell's tomato soup that was in the fridge dying to have a purpose. We all loved the rice. Went great with our chili con carne, tortillas and nachos.

since this was my first time making Mexican rice, I'd say it was a success. i only made a few minor changes including leaving out the water and adding more bouillon which was beef instead of chicken. can't wait for dinner tonight. we're having chicken and rice burritos with horchata!

Excellent recipe.   I have tried many different Mexican rice recipes and this is the one I will make again.  I did leave out the salt as I figured the Better than Bouillon tablespoon had enough sodium for me.

This rice has exactly the flavor that I was looking for. It is very easy to make as well. I've made it twice now and I highly recommend using the serrano pepper. It really does add quite a bit of flavor. The only thing I would do differently is to omit the salt. The first time I made the recipe, I used a little bit but still thought it was too salty. Other than that, this recipe is perfect.

I've made this twice in less than a week. The first time I didn't have any serrano peppers, but the second time I made sure to and I definitely think it makes a difference. I have to say I've tried many Mexican rice recipes and have never been happy. This one is WONDERFUL!!!!! I always have cartons of chicken broth on hand, so the only change is that I use that instead of the water/bullion combination. Love it! Thanks so much for the delicious and easy recipe!

OMG!!! The best ever. I did change it up just a tad.  I doubled the recipe using 4 cups of chicken broth and 1 cup water. Also, I used some tomato paste from the tube rather than what the recipe originally called for. Once I added liquid I covered the pan, cooked on med - high for 10 mins and turned to me - low for 20...never touched the lid! It's important to leave the lid alone and trust that it's cooking properly.

Very good flavor!! Next time I make it I will cut back on the water,
it came out very mushy. Next time I am going to add only 2 cups of water. Also instead of it simmering and trying to burn, I boil the mixture initially for about 3 minutes, Stir, cover and turn off the burner and let it steam to finish, about 20 minutes.(Do this for all of my rice).

Great recipe, added it to my recipe box!

Loved this recipe. Made it without the chicken bouillon and tasted great. Used the serrano but may try it again without since everything else is a pantry staple.

Can you say delicious!! My husband and I tried this recipe with some homemade chicken enchiladas and it was the best Mexican Rice ever!! I didn't change the ingredients at all except for adding a little color to the rice with Goya Sazon. Just a pinch did it. Thank You for sharing I know we will enjoy this Mexican dish everytime!! :-)

I'm on a quest to fund a recipe that is close to my bf's grandmas rice. I'll definitely make this again, but I think I'll cut back on the onion. I think it probably less a problem with the recipe and more a problem with the size onion I picked up. Thanks for the quick and easy recipe.

I tried this recipe for the first time last night. It was good although I added too much water and I like my rice on the dryer side. The flavor was good and almost what I'm used to. I added some seasoned ground turkey and made sort of a mexican dirty rice. Que rico!

Yummy! Didn’t have Serrano pepper, so threw in a good amount of Valentina hot sauce and it added a nice earth to it. Good recipe!

I added chopped jalapeno with the onion for a little extra heat.  I also used brown rice and had to add quite a bit to the cooking time.  It is really good.

I’ve been making a variation of this for years, passed down from my mom and it’s so good! My only real change is to use El Pato in place of regular tomato sauce. Sometimes I will stir in some salsa at the end, sometimes I like it drier....just depends on my mood ha!

This recipe is absolutely perfect! I don't change a thing, it's fabulous just the way it is.... I do sprinkle fresh cilantro on it occasionally before serving, but other than that I follow the recipe to a tee! I've made it at least five times now, and both my boyfriend and I love it! Give it a try!

I made this rice as is other than I did not have a seranno pepper on hand to complete the written recipe.  My kids LOVED this rice sans the pepper, but I felt like it was missing something...I will definitely try adding in a pepper of some sort next time.

This was good but WAAAYYYY too much salt for my tastes. A tablespoon of chicken billion seasons 3 cups of water and this recipe only has 2.5. Then another tablespoon and a half of salt was just overkill. Otherwise the flavor was great. I will make this again for sure and just do the tablespoon of billion and skip the additional salt.

My family in general hate Spanish rice, but we have a daughter who has to eat gluten-free and dairy free. She loves Spanish rice, so we tried this recipe for her. Hands-down, this is the best rice we have ever had, beats every restaurant we’ve ever eaten in.  Everybody in my family wants this recipe. I do add extra cumin, Trader Joe’s lime and chili pepper seasoning, and garlic,  and I used jasmine rice, which I think makes a difference and adds more flavor.

Great recipe. I leave about 1/4 of the seeds in the peppers to add a true Mexican kick. I double the recipe, and for a family of four with two teenage boys, it is exactly enough to stuff everyone.

This rice is easy, simple and delicious! I’ve been searching for a great rice recipe and this is by far my favorite. The only thing I did differently is that we left out the onion since our family doesn’t care for them. I’ll be making this again and again!

Absolutely delicious and tastes WAY better than the Californian Mexican restaurants’ rices I’ve had. I would use slightly less salt next time. Because I made this on a whim and didn’t have tomato sauce, I used about 2/3 cup of fresh cut up tomatoes and it was still great.

I made this rice and the wife and I loved it. But I think it should be cooked like plain rice. I cooked it according to recipe and it almost burnt during the 15 to 20 min boil. I turned down to low added a half cup of water . I also added to the article recipe with 2 toes of garlic 2 jalapeños instead of Serrano pepper instead of sauce I had one of those small cans of Mexican sauce. Dam good and I couldn’t taste the burnt.

I make this with the Baked Chili Relleno Casserole.  My husband and I love it.  I always substitute chicken broth for the water, and omit the chicken bouillon.

I made this per the recipe with these additions/modifications:  added one clove garlic with the onion
added  1/4 cup diced bell pepper with the onion
subbed 1/3 cup enchilada sauce for the tomato sauce
diced 1/2 serrano pepper with seeds added with onion/garlic/pepper

The rice came out a bit mushy.  I think this recipe has too much liquid.   The flavor was fine.   I would make again but would use less chicken broth to hopefully get a more fluffy texture.

This was delicious that I decided to give my first review! I followed the recipe exactly, aside from the normal tomato sauce (used hot tomato sauce) & it was so delicious! It had a little extra kick, but still not too spicy. My entire family loved it (including my picky five year old, and two year old) and it wasn’t too spicy for them. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Great recipe! I am not a fan of Mexican rice, so I am super picky. This is the only Mexican rice I like now. It is that good! I get volunteered to make it every time a function comes up needing Mexican rice. Tip to make it super perfect - decrease the water to 2 cups and it is perfect and fluffy when done! Thanks for the great recipe!

Deserving of the almost 5 stars it has! Versatile enough to add, substitute or omit a lot of different things; love this recipe!  I saute onions and fresh garlic before sauteing the rice (that's how my Great-Grandma did it). And I added a "caldo de tomate" bouillon since its all I had. Very delicious, very close to Fidel's Mexican Restaurant here in San Diego!

It was extremely tasty! The only thing I didn’t like was that it never got less wet and sticky. I want fluffy rice!

I really liked this recipe.  I included the serrano pepper and it was pretty spicy, very enjoyable.

This recipe is excellent--by far the best I've ever had. Make it exactly as described to get the right texture. (A lot of times Mexican rice -- even at restaurants -- is kind of wet and mushy. If made according to the directions, this rice turns out moist but firm.)

I didn't have long grain rice, used short grain white.  Turned out fine.  Doubled the amount of cumin and pepper (my family likes things tasty).  Would consider adding the serrano finely chopped (if you like hot).  Easy, tasty side dish that compliments most Hispanic foods.  I served it with fish simmered in green salsa.  Will also use with our carne asada.

I have made this dozens of times at this point, and it never fails. It is always delicious and tastes so much better than those processed box mixes. I do add a couple of garlic cloves in with the serrano pepper. This is my go to for mexican rice.

I started out making this as written but discovered I was out of chicken broth so took a chance and used beef boullion and a can of mild green chiles instead of the chilie called for however, even with these changes the rice turned out well and went great with steaks.

Delicious and easy. This is my go to Mexican rice recipe. I use 1/4 teaspoon of cumin (family likes it) and substituted salsa for the tomato sauce this time. Kicked up the flavor.

I thought nothing more today than making enchiladas with Frijoles and Mexican rice and this recipe definitely fit the bill. My kids don't have a tolerance for spices like I do so I did not add any chilies but I did add a whole large Yellow bell pepper for some extra flavor "Finely chopped". Everyone loved it.

I've made this exactly as the recipe is listed. I've also made it using chicken broth in place of the water and bouillon. I've made it with and without the Serrano. I've also added frozen mixed veg to it. All ways come out delicious! I have to adjust the recipe to make 18 servings (3 cups uncooked rice) because our small family (2 adults, 1 picky toddler, and 1 infant) gobbles it up  and we MUST have leftovers of this rice for subsequent meals! So good! My Mexican mother in law loves it too.

I feel badly for not adding a review for this recipe long ago, I've made it at least a dozen times, sometimes with minor changes but generally I follow this recipe faithfully.    It's really great, my absolute favorite Mexican rice recipe.  Sometimes I make it a little spicy, sometimes not, depending on the crowd,  I love cumin so I double the amount occasionally, as well.  Even my picky nieces and nephews like it.  I 've tried a lot of different recipes but this has been my go to for several years,  my thanks to the cook and her mother for sharing.

My mother-in-law is from Mexico & makes the absolute best Mexican rice.  I have never been able to make anything close to hers...until this!  My husband said it was the 2nd best he's ever had (I'm ok with that review considering whose is first!) & my whole family raved about it.  The only substitution I made was I used vegetable Better Than Bouillon instead of chicken bouillon because I'm vegan.  Will definitely be making this again!

This was fantastic!! Pretty much followed to the letter except I didn't have a Serrano on hand so I diced up half a red bell pepper and sautéed it with the onion. Everyone loved it.

Most recipes are just the building blocks for a dish that's amazing. The first time I make a new recipe, I always go according to directions. After that I add or subtract ingredients to make it good. This recipe doesn't need any alterations. It is perfect just the way it is! I make this rice all the time now. To the one who posted this recipe: can I come over to your mom's house for supper??? :) I can only imagine all the tasty foods that come out of her kitchen!

I love this rice, and so does my family! Tonight I used brown rice instead of white and couldn't tell the difference (except for the extra 20 minutes I needed to cook it). 
I also cut the salt down to 1/4 teaspoon, didn't use bullion, and increased the cumin to 1 teaspoon. I never use the Serrano because I'm not compatible with too much spicy!

This was REALLY good. My boys all loved it! I thought it was a little salty, so I would probably cut that back next time to 1 tsp. I also substituted in about 2 tbsp tomato paste (bc I didn't have any sauce!). Delicious. Trying it again substituting in salsa

This was EXCELLENT AS IS! I made this to go with shrimp tacos. It was the star of the dinner. For those that said it was too much liquid-- the key is to really BOIL the rice UNCOVERED for the first 10 minutes (this went against every rice instinct in my body). Don't walk away and stir occasionally. After the 10 minutes then reduce the heat & cover for an additional 10 mins. Voila...magic!

I used a little less onion than the recipe called for, but the rice was really good. My family ate it up! Would definitely make it again.

I absolutely LOVE the flavor of this rice, but being a new cook I'm finding that I either burn very bottom, or if I cook it on a lower heat it comes out a bit crunchy. Any recommendations?

My wife is hispanic and I am not, and I made this for her Hispanic family  and were all shocked at how good it was and some actually asked where we bought it. This is THE recipe for Mexican rice. I have made it with and without the Serrano, and it is way better with it. It is not a hot pepper, just really adds a good flavor.

Thank you for making true Mexican rice! There are so many tomato slurries online that claim to be Mexican rice - but wet rice is Spanish not Mexican. Mexican rice is distinct and fluffy and delicious and I'm making some today.

I thought this rice was just what I wanted...authentic Mexican rice. Only reason for 4 stars is it needs a tad bit more flavor. I will add oregano, a hint of cayenne pepper and more cumin. Overall, I will make again.

This is a great recipe and super easy.  I used the whole serrano (not chopped up) and the level of spice was perfect!   I did make the mistake of putting all of the salt in at once instead of seasoning and tasting, so it was just a little too salty for us.  I countered the salt with a cup of drained, diced, stewed tomatoes and  fixed it right up.  I will be making this again for Christmas with my favorite green chile beef recipe.

Many compliments this was the best mexican/spanish rice ever!  I did transfer to a rice cooker after pan frying the rice and onion.  It came out slightly wetter than would've liked, so next time may reduce the water from 2.5 cups to 2 cups.

It was delicious . Everyone ate it up. The only variation I made was adding 1 diced bell pepper and 1 cup of frozen corn. Perhaps when I make it in the future I might add some garnishes that are in season (cilantro,  jalapeno), but the recipe is perfect regardless.

This is one of the best rice recipes I've tried! Followed directions listed, except I didn't have any peppers. So I substituted a scant teaspoon of chili powder. We loved this and my husband told me to make this again! If you don't want a spicy kick, then reduce chili powder.

This is the best Mexican rice recipe I have found on this site.  It was easy to make.  I didn't have bouillon granules on hand, but had bouillon cubes. I added 5 chicken bouillon cubes trying to approximate a Tbsp.  I think it might have been a bit too much, and made this rice a little salty for my taste.  I think this was my mistake.  I will definitely be making this with my tacos and refried beans again!

I made it as is, but thought it was way too salty. Maybe the boullion I used was already salty, or maybe there is a typo in the recipe and it should be 1/2 teaspoon of salt, not tablespoon, but next time I make it I will probably leave out the salt alogether. I had to make another cup of plain white rice and mix it in, and after that it was perfect. Very delicious with a dab of Greek yogurt and some scallions on top.

This was a good Mexican rice. Easy and tasty. Followed recipe minus pepper. Unfortunately I made this with a black bean main dish that was not very good and so I think the rice didn't get the full credit it should've with the kids. Oh well next time.

I made this recipe exactly as written. I didn't find it too salty at all, but it was on the bland side. Don't think I will make this one again. Maybe with adding a little bit more tomato sauce, and add some shredded cheddar cheese might make this more flavorful.

I used brown rice too because I didn't have the white. Like the other reviewer, I had to simmer longer. Maybe next time if I boil it longer, it will take less time simmering. I thought it was a bit chewy, but my guests gave it a thumbs up. I'd like it a bit spicier too. Next time, I'd add a chopped jalapeño and cilantro for more flavor and spice.

This was everything I wanted it to be.  I did use a Serrano chili for flavor.  Fixed for company dinner.  They raved about it.  No leftovers.  A keeper.

The directions were very clear and it was easy to make, but it had zero flavor.  We cooked it with the serrano chile and it was still very bland.  We will have to do some adjustments next time we make it to give it some flavor.

I left out the salt because the Knorr boullion is loaded with sodium; otherwise I would recommend this recipe. Add more tomato sauce or Rotel for more flavor.

Its was easy and delicious, a little soggy might use less water next time, and I might add a little more cumin not much more but definitely could use more seasoning, other than that perfect!  Thanks for posting!

Served this with chicken. Everyone thought it was very flavorful. I was worried about the serrano chile but it did not over "heat" the recipe. I made it exactly as written. Thanks for sharing.

I used brown rice and thought I browned it correctly, but after cooking out all the liquid the rice was still crunchy.  Next time I'll use a different rice and barely brown it.  The flavor was there, but the texture was awful.

This turned out great!  Only very minor tweaks were made based on personal preference and ingredients on hand.  I was a little worried about "runny" rice, so I decreased the water by about 1/4 cup,  When measuring my rice, I didn't measure out exactly a cup - it was just a tad over.  I used basmati rice since I have 20lbs of it!  I didn't have any onion, so I had to do without, unfortunately.  I can't wait to make it again WITH onion!  I added some minced garlic with the other spices (about one clove).  I will add more next time.  I didn't have a serrano on hand, but I had a jalapeno, so I used that.  I love the hint of flavor it gave to the rice.  I was happy with the results and will be using this recipe again.  For me, it was perfect!  THANKS!
