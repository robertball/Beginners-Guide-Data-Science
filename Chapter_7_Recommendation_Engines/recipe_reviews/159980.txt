Delish! I used just one large fennel bulb and cut it into thick slices. This ended up being about half the fennel I think so I halved everything else. The goat's cheese really made it. I've made fennel before and everyone rejected it. This time my hubby asked for seconds!

Good but needs some clarification. I used Moscato wine (dessert wine) which brought out a very unpleasant sour/pickled taste in the fennel - assuming this is my fault for not heeding "DRY white wine". Goat cheese and herbs go well with both the fennel and wine. Took off 1/2 star for not listing the size of the baking dish or explaining "arrange fennel". I used an 8x8 dish for 3 regular-size fennel bulbs (sliced) I have never seen baby-size in any store; the slices were layered like a gratin. Another 1/2 star off for the excessive liquid - the end result was submerged. I will make this again but will try replacing the liquid with 1/2C of the water used from boiling (to increase the fennel taste) and 1/2C of Sauvignon Blanc.

This didn't turn out the way I had hoped -- perhaps it needed to roast longer? I used baby fennel in whole-bulb form and it was a bit tough on the outside (perfect on the inside) and the goat cheese kind of took over the flavor. My husband liked it and requested to have it again.
