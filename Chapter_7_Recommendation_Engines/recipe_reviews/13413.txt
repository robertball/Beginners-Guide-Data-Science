10 Stars!!!  Loved this soup!  I made this more of a mushroom brie soup by using just over a pound of sliced mushrooms and I sauteed them in marsala (substitute for sherry) and butter along with diced carrots with the lid on to keep all the juice. Added the whole mix to the broth after I strained it - OMG, the BEST mushroom soup I've ever made!

this one is heaven in a bowl.
it is now on the menu forever, a guest of mine asked that I never run out of this.
  I cook the vegetables in the broth and strain them out at the thickening stage.
less chancce of splashing or lumpiness.

A definite 5 star!!!  This is such a delicious and impressive soup.  I served it for friends in individual bread bowls and everyone LOVED it!  Seconds were had by all and they could have ate more if I had made more!  Next time I make this, which will be soon, I will cut back on the brie, add more mushrooms and use the lowest sodium broth I can find.  It was a bit too salty for my taste.  However, don't let that put you off.  It is a scrumptious must try!!!!!

This soup sounded so divine, I had to give it a try.  At the dinner, everyone enjoyed it so much, they all asked for seconds and didn't save room for the main course.  Definitely deserves 5 stars!

OK, I made a few changes to this recipe to meet my family's preferences.  I appreciate the recipe and that's why I'm giving it five stars.  I had a large wheel of Brie to use and this took care of half of it and my kids ate the soup, asking for more!!!

I changed the veggies to 1/2 leek, sliced thinly, and about 1/2 cup chopped carrots, and added them at the beginning with the butter.  I therefore didn't really do the roux, but did let the flour brown slightly.

I probably had at least 16 oz of Brie, maybe a few ounces more, and trimmed off all of the end and most of the rind on the top and bottom-I left some as I like the flavor.

This was a yummy soup our family enjoyed as a main course with rolls-thanks for submitting it!

Simple and delicious.  I used 1 carrot, 2 stalks of celery, and half an onion in this recipe.  Also used a 1:1 ratio for the chicken broth and skim milk (substituted for the heavy cream).  I poured this in the blender and lightly pureed it.  Voila!  Topped with green onions.  Delicious.

This soup is AMAZING! We omitted the mushrooms because I dont like them. I also put the sherry in with the brie to let them marinate and melt together. Once the veggies were al dente, we pureed everything together. I forgot to put the cream in and the soup didn't need it, so try it before you add the cream.

This is a soup that suffers with an identity crisis. It didn't bowl me over but it also was far from spectacular. It wants to be a vegetable soup but appears to taste like a cream of chicken. Very disappointed with this one.

Followed the recipe to a tee and got a bland train wreck of odious consistency.  Maybe we messed this up somewhere along the line that I'm not seeing, but it was awful.

This was a perfect lunch for a cold rainy day.  We really enjoyed the luscious texture and the sense of  decadence it gave to a simple soup lunch.  I added 8oz of mushroom just because we love them, but otherwise followed the recipe.

This is a wonderful soup!!!  Suitable for 4-5 star entertaining!  However, use “Ghee”, (clarified butter) rather than butter!
