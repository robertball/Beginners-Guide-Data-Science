I used half mayo, half sour cream so it wouldn't be too much of a mayo flavor. Because I had it on hand, I used one package frozen spinach that I thawed and drained like whoa. My husband, older child and I really liked it. I think next time I might add some red pepper flake or hot sauce and maybe more cheese....like an italian cheese blend? We had this with reduced fat Wheat Thins. It was literally gone in fifteen minutes. Next time, I'll double it, too.

We've made this recipe for many years and love it as it is but over time have made a few changes to accommodate tastes and health. 1. Halve mayo and sub in low fate sour cream or low fat cream cheese with some additional skim milk to thin. 2. Add a small can of chopped green chilies with juice for some kick. 3.  Add a splash of lemon juice to 'brighten' the flavors. 4. Add a defrosted 10 oz box of chopped spinach.
When there are leftovers (I make a double batch) we take what remains and either thin it or add Alfredo sauce and toss it with pasta for a great side dish. It's very forgiving so you can make additions to make it more substantial .  .  . shopped chicken or tuna, pepper jack cheese .  .  . talk about grown up mac and cheese!

I've made this dip for several years.  We love it.  The only difference is that instead of cloves of garlic, I mix the other ingredients, and sprinkle some garlic salt or powder over the top.  I usually make a double batch and put in an 8x8 pan.  Warning..we also call it heart attack dip.  It's delish and addicting.

Everyone devoured this dip!  The only addition I made was to add a tablespoon of hot sauce (the rooster one) not to make it spicy, just to give it a little bit more dimension.  Perfect! Great with baguette too.

I really didn't like this.  It was mayo overkill.

As the recipe stands written - 3 stars.  The mayo was just far too overpowering, even for my mayo loving hubby.  With the mods I did the second time around - 4 stars.  Added more garlic (we love the garlic), did 1/2 mayo, 1/2 sour cream as others have suggested, and then threw in half a bar (4 oz) of cream cheese, just because I had it lying around.  I also used fresh grated Parmesan cheese, and sprinkled it on top of the dip before baking, and before topping it liberally with paprika.  Next time I think I'll even add some spinach to the mix.

I have been making this, thanks to my mother-in-law for 30 years but never added garlic, yum. I will say if I use regular mayo I use 3/4 of a cup. If I use low fat then I go to the full cup.

I too have been making this for years exactly as written  It is good hot, warm and even cold leftovers if there are any. If you use your large holes on a box grater it makes quick work of the artichoke hearts. Also for a change, throw in a box of thawed spinach and some pepper jack cheese.

Easy and yummy!  Will be making again for sure.  After reading reviews I decided to use 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream. My family loved it.

Substituted the mayo with soy yogurt & used marinated artichokes--big hit :-)
