Love them.  I cut the coconut oil in half  and then used butter for the other half.  They were a bit more buttery.  I also used Swerve Sweetner 100% Keto.  LOVED Them.   Thanks for sharing.

I switched out the fats a bit- did half a cup of coconut oil, 10T of ghee, 90% cacao bar instead of cocoa powder, almond butter instead of peanut butter and macadamia nuts instead of peanuts FANTASTIC!!! And DEF eat them frozen! The macadamia nuts w the ghee made it taste like toffee bits in them! Oh- and four packets of Splenda. Made 28 the size of Reeces minis at 127cal and 1net carb- surprised everyone w the awesome flavor!!!

I am one of those people who tastes "bitterness" with Stevia, so I substituted 1/3 cup of Splenda for the Stevia, and these taste very much like peanut butter cups!

The coconut oil was overwhelming, so added half cup of coconut milk (which balanced the oil) and extra tablespoon of cocoa, and used monk fruit in place of stevia. 
Next time will reduce the coconut oil by half

I used a 1/4 cup of Swerve sweetener instead of the stevia.  Then I poured it on a cookie sheet covered in parchment paper and froze it and broke it up like bark.

Holy cow - so good! Threw these down like it was my last meal and I have no regrets! I used Swerve granular sugar substitute instead of Stevia. Will be making this again....in about 10 mins.

After being on the Keto diet for just over a week, I really wanted something sweet and this really did the trick!  Good combination of good oils and nuts - I thought it was fabulous!  I just used the mini muffin cup liners in a tray and froze.  They came right out of the paper because of all the oil in them.

This was beyond bitter. Iâ€™m not sure if the brand of liquid stevia matters, but I had to throw out the whole batch because of the bitterness. I would consider trying to make this again and just omit the stevia altogether.

I made these today minus the Coco powder forgot to add it. Also I can't do stevia so I used 1 tablespoon of Monk fruit sweetner and whole salted and roasted peanuts just gave a small chop. Mine taste just like Chick-o-Sticks candy.

These are absolutely delicious!!!  I tried one from a friend & it was also good but this recipe is so much better.  These are so creamy & even taste better than  a regular chocolate bar.  They are salty & sweet which I love.  Will definitely be making this recipe a lot!!!

Used a Stevia packet instead of a liquid, and mixed with a blender after warming the Oil. Chunky peanut butter let's you skip the adding of peanuts.

These are a favorite. I make them in ice cube trays, easier to freeze that way. I mix the nuts in instead of putting on top.

I used 1/2 cup coconut oil and 1/2 cup butter based on other reviews. I added a  little bit of extra peanut butter. I poured the mixture on a parchment paper covered cookie sheet. Turned out great. Will definitely make again!

Healthy fast food! I didnâ€™t add any sweetener because I like the bitters...dark chocolate etc. I also didnâ€™t add salt, I used salted macadamia nuts instead of peanuts. They came out perfect for my liking. Our three year old granddaughter really likes them too. Quick. Easy. Yummy!

Yummy! For our family's taste would add more nuts next time, and use the kind of nuts without the roasted coating (just plain salted peanuts). Used flexible neoprene cupcake liners and they pulled out perfectly.

I made this and was pleased with the results. However, If I were to make them again I would cut the amount of coconut oil in half, if not, replace it completely with butter. The coconut taste was not strong, but I could still taste it among the other chocolate and peanut butter flavors, and that's not a flavor I want to be tasting in peanut butter cups. The other change I made was that I used miniature sized cup cake molds instead of full sized.  Other than the above mentioned changes - the recipe came out great. and I highly recommend it.

These are actually really good! It's my 4th week on keto and I hadn't really tried any desserts yet- I was pretty sure they would all be terrible. But these are super tasty! I also substituted half butter, half coconut oil as suggested by numerous reviewers. They were very simple and quick to make, I actually did it on break between double shifts. And I only had 6 silicon popsicle molds, so I used those and then cut each into quarters so they'd be more like fat bomb size. Have already recommended to another friend on keto. Thanks for the recipe!

I'm new to keto and bought liquid stevia from trader Joes.  I also used half coconut oil, half butter and there was something off about these.  Bitter and salty and breaks apart like coconut oil out of the jar.  Oddly enough eating them was awful but the after taste was good.  I just had to choke it down to get to that point.  Please tell me what might be wrong here because chocolate peanut butter is one of my favorite things in the world

These are awesome, I will be making them again!  I use 1/2 cup coconut oil and 1/2 ghee as other reviewers suggested.  I don't have stevia so I used 10 drops of Monk Fruit as the sweetener.

These are a good "sweet" treat for ketogenics. They are very easy, although I'm not sure how they got the peanuts to stay on top of the mix.  Mine sank to the bottom. They were still good, but a little oily due to the large amount of coconut oil.

Excellent for keto and tastes too sinful to be keto :). Using fresh ground organic peanut butter a small amount of extra sweetener may be called for since my wife and I both detected a difference.  Iâ€™ve made these several times both with â€˜regularâ€™ PB and fresh and that seems to be the difference.  Never quite get the full dozen out of a batch more like 10. Stir frequently while pouring the cups or youâ€™ll have more solids in the last cups.

Way to slick!  I followed the advice of other's who gave feedback and used 1/2 of the coconut oil and substituted the other half with butter.  It was still very slick and too much of a coconut flavor.

I love this recipe as a base for all kinds of keto friendly snacks. I added up the nutrition info from my ingredients and the fat was way lower. I didn't have cream so I used third less fat cream cheese. I skipped the sugar replacement entirely. I added 4 squares of 70 percent cocoa. I love these. I will add different nuts next time... Some pecan or walnuts will make this even better. I did lightly throw a pinch of salt on these. Excellent contrast.

Great for my sweet tooth. The kosher salt did not blend well and all went to the last poured cup.  

I used a muffin pan with muffin cups. Easy clean up. 
I also followed other reviews and cut the coconut oil in half.

I chose not to add nuts and these are like a meltaway!  Very good. Smooth. Flavorful.

Incredibly easy to make, even easier to eat!  These hit the spot.  Even my husband (who told me, does not like Stevia) told me how much he liked them. (He ate most of them) A friend offered to pay me to make them for her.  (I'm not taking her money but will certainly make a batch for both of us).

Good tasting but very oily and slippery in your hand. It melts easily because of the coconut oil, I wonder if using less would make it better. The taste is good for keto!

Love these. Awesome fat bombs. I made them in small silicon candy molds - it made 30 little bite-sized treats. Thanks!
