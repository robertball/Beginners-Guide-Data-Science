This recipe is delicious! I have been making scones for a while, particularly in the past few days... This recipe's base is wonderful. Buttery and flakey, instead of crumbly. I had a few people tell me this was their favorite scone - and I think I will save this recipe, even to use the base and switch out the cranberry for something else from time to time, such as blueberries and blackberries and chocolate chips.

By the by, I used regular milk - we didnt have buttermilk. Turned out great anyway. Just to let others know.

This scone recipe is perfect! I add the dry ingredients to my food processor & give it a quick buzz. Then drop in chunks of cold butter through the feed tube while pulsing until the butter is the size of peas. Pour the mix into a bowl & stir in the chopped cranberries. I also add the zest of an orange & chopped, toasted walnuts at this point. Make a well and pour in the buttermilk. Stir the dough just until it comes together. Gather the dough and work it into a ball, then flatten into a disc, handling the dough as little as possible. Cut the scones, using a pizza cutter dipped in flour between each cut. The key is baking these on a hot pizza stone. Give the stone a generous coating of Crisco and pop it in the cold oven to get hot while the oven preheats. Gently put the scones on the stone & bake until lightly browned, about 15 minues. Cool the scones on a rack - another key to keeping the bottoms crispy. I opt to serve these with a glaze. Simply mix sifted powdered sugar, softened butter, milk & vanilla. Put it in a small zip-lock bag with the corner snipped off for piping ease. I recommend serving these right away. If you store them air-tight, they'll still taste yummy, but loose the amazing crunchy/crispy texture you worked so hard to get. For a lemon poppyseed version, add 3 T. of poppyseeds & the zest of 1 lemon to the flour mixture. In a 3/4 c. measuring cup, add the juice of 1 lemon, 1/2 tsp. lemon extract & add milk to fill the cup. Proceed combining as usual.

I loved this recipe! If you add too much flour more that what is in the recipe your scones will turn out heavy and dry.
If you think the dough is too soft just make sure your board is well floured, you will pick up more as you knead. I didn't add any extr flour other than what was on my board when I kneaded. Fabulous serverd with "Orange Honey Butter" from this site. I also served with my homemade Cranberry Walnut Jam. I will make again!

I *love* cranberries, but most recipes call for dried ones.  They do not have the zing of fresh!  So I went through and found all the recipes I could with fresh cranberries, and I decided to try this one for a party.  They are very tender and light and quite easy to make.  I don't actually like butter on things, but since this was for a party I made the butter (the night before so the flavors would meld).  I used frozen cranberries and chopped them in the blender.  I only used one stick of butter instead of three.  I used the zest from half an orange, and put the other half of the zest into the scone recipe.  I also squeezed some of the juice of the orange into the butter.  My guests said they loved it and were actually eating it on baguette!  Other than the orange zest, I didn't change the scone recipe except to brush the tops with butter and sprinkle with a little bit of sugar before baking.  I can't say the scones are too different from buttermilk biscuits with cranberry, but hey, I like biscuits.  The cranberries are not too puckery even though there's relatively little sugar in the scones.

Fabulous recipe.  I don't alter a thing, except that I just use the scone recipe, it doesn't even need the cranberry orange butter. If you opt to just make the scones, add 2 tsp of orange zest right to the batter. Don't be scared by the "crumb" consistency - they bake perfectly.

I just wasted three sticks of butter because this recipe is really unclear. I except scones to take a lot of butter, but this needs to be rewritten more clearly to reflect that the first four ingredients are for the cranberry orange butter!!

Funny thing happen to me when I was making this recipe. I didn't have but 3/4 cup of cranberries. SO I had to use them wisely. I made the butter wrong...dummy me. I used 2 tbsp butter with 1 cup of confectioner's sugar and a zest of orange and when I realized what I did, I didn't want to scrap it. SO when I made the scones. I just poured the glaze over the scones and let them dry and cool at room temp...and OMG!!!! Talk about making them taste awesome!!! I think I baked them slightly underdone, but they were so soft that I can't complain. WOW!!! What an excellent goof up. Next time I'll make it the way it's written, but then again...I totally like my goof up. Thanks TOH.

These are yummy. I also made mine in the food processor, but I think I over processed it a bit. Still turned out great. I did not want to make orange butter. My intent was to add orange zest/juice to the dough to recreate a scone I had at a coffee shop. However, I forgot to purchase oranges. I ended up using a little zest and a couple tablespoons of fresh lemon juice instead. I liked it even better than the orange. I also used dried cranberries because I like the flavor/texture. I needed to add a lot of flour to the board when cutting them out, but it worked out fine. Brushed on a little egg wash and sprinkled just regular sugar on top because I couldn't find the large sugar crystals. Worked just as well.

I made these scones for breakfast Christmas morning and they were delicious!  I did add the zest of about half an orange to the scones, I love that flavor combination.  I made the cranberry orange butter the night before, (it makes a lot!) and it was good on the scones, but everyone that tried them agreed that the glaze was the better choice on them, but it just depends on whether you prefer them sweeter or not.   I made my glaze by melting down the cranberry butter and added powdered sugar and a little milk.  Great recipe and I will definitely be making the scones again soon!

Excellent. I mixed the dry ingredients in the food processor. Then added chunks of cold butter along with the frozen cranberries and pulsed until mixed. Then I poured half-and-half with vinegar and almond extract added through the feed tube until mixed. I spooned the soft batter directly into my Williams-Sonoma scone pan and baked for the recommended time. Tender and delicious. NOT crumbly. My husband loved them and the fact they are relatively low in sugar.

I was so disappointed with these, but I'm pretty sure it was my fault. This was my first attempt to make scones. To start, the recipes calls for cranberries, but doesn't say to do anything other than leave them whole - so I chopped them. The dough wasn't really dough, it was more of a gooey substance that almost resembled something that could be edible at some point. I even tried adding more flour but to no avail. Talk about gooey sticky messy! There was no chance I could knead or roll it so I just glopped it on the baking sheet. They tasted ok, but I wasn't impressed. HOWEVER - the butter = AMAZING!!! I'll be making that again for toast or biscuits or *store-bought* scones, haha.

Beware: the first four ingredients listed in this recipe as shown are apparently for the cranberry orange butter not the scones! This is unclear and unlabeled in the ingredient list so I made the mistake of adding these first 4 listed ingredients, including the 1 1/2 cups of butter, to the dry ingredients of the scone recipe. Then wondered why butter and cranberries were listed twice in the ingredients list.  The dough turned out too sticky as a result so I added another 1/2 cup of flour to compensate. The scones turned out fairly flat , probably as a result of way too much butter! But I did get rave reviews of them at the bake sale I made them for. So stick to the 3/4 cup butter in the latter scone recipe ingredient list and don't make the mistake I made. I think these would be fantastic!

I made a mistake with recipe: I thought I would add some orange to the scone recipe so I added the zest and juice of 1 orange and rehydrated some dried cranberries because I didn't have any fresh and although I drained them with that and the orange juice the dough was sticky without adding any buttermilk at all.  As a result the scones didn't rise and turned out more like cookies.  They were very tasty and I will try again paying a bit more attention to detail.

these are really nice scones. I've used craisins in the past and not true cranberries. I love the flavor that cranberries give the pastry. The only comment I had during the prep time is no where does it tell me to chop the cranberries that go in the butter. I decided that it needed to be chopped and not left whole but this really should be identified as chopped as listed for the scone part. The cranberry butter is wonderful! Takes the scone over the top! 1 1/2 cups of butter for 16 scones is just too much though. I will cut it by at least half next time. In all, I have added this to my recipe box and WILL make them again.

Not quite as good as I expected. I'm a scone novice so I may need to do more research before trying it again to get some help with the dough process.

These scones are moist and delicious.  They were so easy and everyone loved them so I am making more tonight. The recipe for the cranberry orange butter above the scone recipe makes WAY too much.  It makes two times more butter than was put in the scones.  It seems unnecessary and I now have way more butter than I need.  Make about 1/4 that much.

Sprinkled a little bit of sugar on top before baking.  The butter was a great addition too.  Best when warm.

These came out excellent.  I shopped my fresh cranberries in the food processor and did the rest by hand.  I didn't make the butter as I had orange jam on hand.  They puff up nicely so I cut my second batch into smaller pieces.

This is a delicious and tender scone.  I just tweaked it a little: used dried cranberries that I re hydrated in some hot water.  I also added the grated rind and the juice from one orange (about 2 T + the buttermilk to equal 3/4 cup).  I also brushed the tops with cream. Will make this again and again!!

Lovely recipe! Do not over mix otherwise the scones turn out tough and dry. I grated orange peel into the scone dough- about a tablespoon and instead of orange butter I topped the scones with an Orange Glaze. Super yummy! The Orange Glaze is also featured on this site. Orange Glaze I is the official title of the recipe.

I followed Julie62's review entirely (except for excluding the walnuts and leaving the cranberry's whole), and I must say they scones turned out AMAZING! My family (and myself included) all ranted about the scones. This recipe is definitely a keeper. :)

I love this scone recipe and have used it more than once.  I skip the glaze all together and add some orange zest and a touch of orange juice to the dough to get orange flavor that way.  Yum.

I loved this recipe. They are just as fresh today as yesterday. I did use powdered buttermilk (3 T.) and 1/2 cup water, and 1/4th cup of orange juice. Instead of regular buttermilk. Also I used the zest of one orange in the batter. My kids/grandkids loved them and said "Make more"! Thanks for a great scone recipe!

Delicious.  I made them with ranier cherries and added a splash of vanilla and some salt.  Very tender and moist.

I made these and added the zest of one orange and they are heavenly! I didn't make the butter- I just eat them as is and can't get enough. Thanks for this delicious recipe- I will be making these often!

This is the best scones recipe I have made yet. It's also the first time I ever used fresh cranberries.  My family loves these. When my husband ate 3 of them after dinner I knew it was a hit. He never does that!  I didn't make the butter for the top, we just eat them like they are.  Fantastic recipe, this will now be my primary scones reipe no matter what I add to it.

These were the best scones I have ever eaten! Very light and full of flavor! I used a dried berry mix (blueberry, cranberry, and cherry) instead of fresh cranberries, and instead of making the butter, I melted 2 Tbsp. butter and added 1/3 c. powdered sugar. I pulled the scones out when they still had about 2 minutes to go, and brushed it on top. Then I finished baking the scones and served them hot with homemade Devonshire Cream. They don't get any better than this recipe!

I only made the scones and as they were great, I think they needed a touch of salt in the recipe just to pull out all the yummy flavours more. I look forward to trying the butter next time!

Recipe perfectly scrumptious as written.  I had to use dried cranberries and will soak them first next time, but the scones were yummy and GONE in minutes.

1/4 cup of the cranberry butter was enough for the half-batch I baked tonight.

I used Splenda one-for-one in both recipes (butter and scones).  Can't wait to make them again.

Thanks for a wonderfully flavorful and EASY PEAZY recipe!

My god these scones are good!  The butter recipe is massive, so I halfed it and it was still plenty, it sure added a wonderful flavour to the scones, especially with the orange peel.

My husband gobbled them all down and still talks about how good they were!

I made a few tweaks to make it my own. I like to add a Tablespoon of fresh grated orange zest, and instead of adding 3/4 cup milk, I did 1/2 cup milk, and 1/4 cup orange juice.  I only added 2 Tb of baking powder, I used a recipe similar to this, and I remember being able to taste the baking powder in the finished result. To compensate, I did a little more baking soda (3/4 instead of 1/2).  When kneading, I had to add extra flour, because it was a bit too sticky.  I used dried cranberries, and it worked well as a substitute! I added a bit more cranberries, because that's what my family likes.  Also, instead of making the butter,  I drizzled a bit of melted butter when the scones came out of the oven, then sprinkled sugar over them. Overall, good recipe

I just made these tonight. So good and easy to make. Forget the packaged scone mix, make these. Thinking about throwing in some white chocolate chips in next time like my favorite tea house makes them. I'll be making this for the mother - daughter tea I'm having next month.

These are wonderful! I opted to use the dried cranberries, and may make them again with one of the flavored cranberries (blueberry or pomegranate).  I made these for my coworkers, and had waaaaay too much of the butter, I guess many of the people who tried them did not want butter.  The next time I made them, I only made 1/3 of the butter recipe, and did not put in any cranberries, just the powdered sugar and orange zest.

Really, really good.  I'm getting tired of sweet things around the holidays, so I omitted the glaze.  I also substituted 1 cup of whole wheat flour for some of the all purpose, and then added two tablespoons of sour cream.  The texture and the flavor are amazing!  Perfect for a not-too-sweet dessert.

Pretty yummy - used soured half and half instead of buttermilk and half whole wheat flour.  Added frozen mixed berries instead of cranberries and scooped with ice cream scoop instead of kneading out into a circle and cutting.  Also, included some cinnamon and a dash of cardamom with the dry ingredients.  Maybe I'd add a little salt next time?

I did the same thing as someone below and wasted three sticks of butter, not realizing the first four ingredients are the ORANGE BUTTER. Could be more clearly labeled, but I also should have thought through what I was doing. Cooking rookie here. 

Anyway, once that debacle was out of the way, this recipe turned out great! I used chocolate chips instead of cranberries (despite the recipe title) and they still turned out great. For the second batch, instead of 8 wedges, I cut 16 smaller triangles, and baked 11 or 12 minutes. I like that portion size better.

Such a delicious recipe! I use dried cranberries and use lemon zest instead of the orange. And instead of buttermilk, I use half and half and add about 3 table spoons of fresh lemon juice. I'm always amazed at how well these turn out!

This was an amazing recipe. We had to add a bit more flour when kneading, but other than that, it was perfect! Everyone loved them, and we shared them at the kids' school. The teachers raved!
