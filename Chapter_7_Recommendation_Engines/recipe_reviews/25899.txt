This dish is excellent.  The sauce is just perfect and makes this dish work great as a side with a great plain meal like filets and potato (baked and mashed).  The only thing I changed was I did not use canned mushrooms.  Instead, I used fresh shittake and/or crimini...whatever was available at the time.  I think it made a big difference.

This is more like a main dish. If you added chicken and served it over noodles it would be even better.  This was just too hearty and rich to be a side dish. Also, I added basil instead of tarragon.

Really good.  Cooked carrots can be less than interesting, but this recipe was great. The celery, mushrooms and milk gave the carrots a nice mellow flavour.

These were tasty, but more of a cold weather dish.  I made it with garden fresh carrots in the summer.

Pretty tasty! I was specifically looking for recipes that use tarragon.   From experience using creams with flour and milk before, I find it easier to mix the milk and flour together before adding them to the pan.

I just fixed these for supper tonight and no one has tasted them yet except me but I can assure you my family is going to have a whole new attitude about carrots as a side dish. I didn't have any celery and I believe I'll try it that way next time but I used some celery seed so at least the flavor is there. I used a bit more chicken stock seasoning too.

Tried this recipe for a holiday sidedish as an alternative to candied carrots.  It sounds delicious by description, but I was disappointed even after substituting fresh mushrooms in lieu of canned, and adding some diced water chestnuts.  Maybe try as a puree and feed to tots using airplane sounds.

I found this recipe to be simple and really really good.  Everyone in my family raved about it, and ate it "all gone" (a feat).  I did not use the mushrooms, as I was out, but it turned out well.  I added a bit more chicken broth and it gave it a little more sauce.  Mmmmm what a great way to eat your veggies!

I made this with leftover frozen vegetables including cauliflower, broccoli,and carrots. We did need to make extra sauce, and it was very good. We plan to make it again.

My husband ( beginner cook) found this and made it exactly as written. Very good, I added a bit more milk at the end when he called me to look at it just to make it a bit more creamy our preference.  Will make again.

I made this by the recipe. I was expecting it to be very tasty, but my family and I just did not like it. It was ok, but won't try it again.
