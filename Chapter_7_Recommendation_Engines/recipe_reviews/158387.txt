This was great! Make sure you keep to the time frame suggested for cooking the kangaroo meat as it gets tough very quickly. Have the vegies ready to go so the meat doesn't lose its heat. A really tasty, healthy meal. Thanks!

Delicious. If cooked right, the kangaroo is tender and tastes a bit like lamb.
