I loved this! You do need a very thin layer of black beans or it all squeezes out when you roll them. In a pinch, you can throw the rolls in the freezer for 15 to make cutting them easier later.

I thought this recipe was ok, I don't think I ground the beans up enough, they were a little hard. I added garlic powder to the cheese mixture instead of the onion salt, and just realized I didn't add the sour cream to the mix, but that part of the wraps turned out great (the cream cheese, jack cheese and garlic powder), I will use that as a spread for crackers at a party I am having soon.  I might try this recipe again and make sure I get the beans well ground.

These are so good!!  A co-worker brought them to one of our office birthday parties; she told us how easy they are to make.  I'll definitely make them for get-togethers or just for a quick snack!

Good flavors.  I added fresh garlic and some tomatilla salsa to the benas before I processed them.  I tried both a mini food processor and a blender and also added a lot of salsa for liquid but still had a pretty lumpy mixture.  Next time to make them even quicker I am going to use canned refried black beans and just mix the cheese mixture by hand.  I also use Amy's Cilantro Sauce as a a dip and both were devoured!

Very good and very easy.  I used plain Monterey Jack cheese, so it definitely could have used more spice.

I made this for a Mexican-theme party and it was a hit.  As suggested, I used a can of refried black beans instead of blending black beans - very easy! For the cheese, I used a Mexican Blend.  I also served it with Amy's Cilantro sauce.

Ugh.  Maybe I did something wrong, but I didn't like this at all.  And it was a pain in the neck to make for little reward.  We're going to try heating it to save it...

I made these once for a work party and everyone RAVED and I am requested to make them often.  I have since modified it and everyone still loves them.  I use an entire large can of refried black beans (less fuss and easier to spread), an 8 oz block of cream cheese, 8 oz container of sour cream and a whole bag of shredded cheese.  This makes about 8 burrito size rolls (80 pinwheels) with no leftover ingredients.  These can also be made with reduced fat ingredients and still taste great!

SO TASTY!Very easy,no cooking involved.I served it as a dinner not an appy.I also served it warm from the microwave.I didn't slice it up I served it whole like a burritto.I suggest using 2 tsp. of onion powder instead of 1/4 tsp.onion salt.I serve this once a week when I'm in a hurry.

My toddlers (2 and 4yrs) love these, on the plain side.  I make the bean spread very smooth, cream cheese, shredded mexican blend cheeses, tiny amount of onion or garlic salt, no salsa or spice.

This was good, but next time I want to pump it up a little.  I might add some turkey or chicken to cut the richness of the cheese and sour cream.  Also, I put the salsa in the roll instead of serving it on the side.  Yum!

Made with whole wheat tortillas, these are fun to make and eat.  I used yogurt instead of the sour cream to make them a bit lighter. Jalapeno peppers are needed as a garnish to make them colorful.

I added a few red pepper flakes to the cheese mixture to give it a little bite. I also used canned black beans to make the whole process a little quicker and easier. I made them for a bridal shower and everyone loved them.

I was worried about the lack of flavour that some mentioned, so I added juice from one lime to the beans and tspn of taco seasoning and diced green onions to the cream cheese. The cream cheese bit was a bit runnier than I would have liked, maybe don't need the sour cream. But I forgot to add the jack cheese when mixing the rest (had to unroll them and add it - what a mess). My onion salt was dead so I used garlic salt and they turned pretty good. Next time will try with just the taco seasoning and skip the garlic. The onions gave it a nice flavour and some colour.

I used refried black beans rather than mashing them myself.  The salsa makes them a little watery...I used diced chipotle peppers instead.  Very good.  Chill well before trying to slice.

Used canned black refried beans instead of processing whole ones. Turned out great. Do not overfill the tortillas, that could turn into a mess! I served with Paul Newmans mango salsa. If you haven't tried the fruit salsa(s), it is a must. Great flavor!

This is a snack that my husband, my 2 year old and I love.  I did change a few things.  I didn't put in the onion salt because I didn't have it and then I added some salsa with the black beans in the processor.  It made it a better texture.  I also added Cheddar Cheese right before I rolled it up.  Loved them and will make them all the time!

I used green spinach tortillas and served at my St. Patty's Day Party; they were a big hit.  I omitted the salsa, doubled the pepper jack and used a taco seasoning mix.  These last well (for a few days) unsliced in the fridge.

These were pretty good.  The only thing is that you kind of have to eat them right away.  They get a little mooshy when you leave them in the fridge to eat.  Maybe I should have sliced them right before I served them.

Although these were not as easy to roll as I would like, they were good.
I did find refried black beans, and used garlic & herb cream cheese.
Do not put too much on tortillas, or you will have a mess.

Very good.  I used Mexican style shredded cheese, galic salt instead of onion salt and I put the salsa in the pinwheel instead of serving it on the side.  Big hit with everyone.

The pinwheels look inviting, and the plate was empty before other choices. Must encourage dipping in salsa . This adds alot to a somewhat bland taste when you expect a mexican spice flavor. I added sliced black olives with jalapenos. The base recipe is great but has room for improvement.

It was okay but nothing great. A little bland. We served it with some fruit salsa which improved it greatly. Definitely too much cream cheese. There must be a better recipe out there than this one.

These are great!  I spice them up a little with cumin and chile powder.  They are my "go-to" food for potlucks.  They also transport well.  I have taken them as part of a picnic lunch when canoeing and I leave them rolled up like a cheesy bean burrito - yum!  When you are serving them as pinwheels, it definitely helps to chill them first befor cutting.  I leave them in the fridge overnight then slice them in the morning.

Very good, but a little bland.  I added fresh cilantro to the mix, and it improved it quite a bit.  I'll be making these again.

Amazing and easy!  I added cumin and chili powder, and used garlic powder instead of onion salt.  Also took the reccomendation of using refried black beans.  Threw them in the freezer before cutting, and they were a snap!  Thanks for the recipe.

Yummy!  Whole family liked. I made fresco salsa to cover them with and I mixed all ingredients together instead of layering the beans with the cream cheese mixture.  Definitely a repeat.

Kind of a bland flavor. I added a 1/4 tsp of taco seasoning, but it could have used much more.  I served it with salsa.  I will make it again, but with more taco seasons.

Made this for my 18 month old picky eater. It was hard for him to chew through the tortilla so I put mixed the bean mix and cheese mix and spread on crackers.

These were pretty quick and easy to make.  I took other reviwers ideas and added a can of green chilis.  I made enough for the following day to see if they held up well overnight and they did.  You could make these ahead of time for a party.  I think if I make again I will add diced red bell pepper to add texture and color.

These are always a hit and I always get asked to make these for parties. I serve them with Amy's Cilantro Dip and they always disappear quite quickly! Enjoy!

I made these for a bridal shower, and they were a hit.  I didn't puree the beans, just kinda rolled them in.  Also, I poured some salsa in the bottom of a dish, and stood the rolls up in that.  It looked nice and they gobbled them up!  They were a little bland, so next time I'll probably add some green chiles or hot sauce to them.  A keeper!!

I added some diced jalapenos and green onions, and they were still bland. I don't think I'll try these again. If I do, I'll try taco seasoning like another reviewer suggested.

Yummy.  Made these for a Texas Themed Baby Shower.  Everyone loved them.  They were a nice, COOL contrast to the spicy dishes that were also served.

These can be a little on the bland side. However, they are easy to make, can be made ahead of time and make alot. I use refriend beans instead of black beans to make things easier. Serve with really good and fresh salsa.

I had a little trouble getting the beans to mash in the blender. Next time I'll try the foodprocessor. I added hot sause and a little red pepper to the cheese mixture. It needed a little something. That's why the 3 star.

We love these!   I have never taken these to a party without them being devoured.  I double the batch of filling since I use the burrito sized tortillas.  It makes a lot.  I also add a bit of garlic, and serve with mild and hot salsa.

These are pretty good--a little bit of a fuss to prepare and assemble--but a nice make ahead appetizer.

I'd definitely make these again - they were a hit at our fiesta.  I did spread a little chipotle sauce between the cream cheese and the beans (we used canned refried beans too) for extra kick.
