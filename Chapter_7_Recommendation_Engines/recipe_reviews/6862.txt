Your mouth will start to water 40 min. into the baking time as the aroma invades your home!!!  Since this makes 3 loaves, it is a great gift to bring over to neighbors and relatives, also great to freeze and  have on hand.
I will definetly use only half of the oil, and substitute the rest for unsweetened applesauce since it is 10g fat per slice.  It stays fresh in the fridge for a little over a week.  I had to cook mine for 70-75 min. but that is probably due to my oven.********So I tried this recipe again and put only applesauce and no oil.  The result?  Better!  It is so moist and delicious and healthier!  I have made it this way 10 plus times now and I will never go back to putting oil in it!  
********This lightened version is: 168 calories, 1 g fat per serving (36 servings).

This is really great.  The only thing I did differently was I didn't measure out 3 cups of pumpkin.  I just used a 28 oz can.  You get about a half cup more pumpkin than called for, but it sure doesn't hurt it any, and I have no recipe that only calls for a half cup pumpkin.

Very good for gifts!  I even cut back on the sugar and oil slightly for health reasons and no one notices the difference!

This is the best pumpkin bread!  I added rum soaked raisins to the batter and I also doubled the spices which really brought out the flavor.  Delicious!!!!!

I made this recipe for muffins and mini muffins and they were wonderful!  I tried a small loaf pan of bread but it seemed to get too done on top before the middle.  A dense bread!  Excellent for muffins....I took them to preschool for snack and kept some for home!  I'll use this one again!!!!

I've made 2 batches of this yummy bread for the holidays as gifts.  Of course we taste-tested 1st...really, really good!  I added chopped pecans to one batch.  ONLY PROBLEM I ENCOUNTERED WAS: had to cook for at least 15 mins longer than recommended for 1st batch...it made 7 mini loaves.  2nd batch I made 3 minis and 1 reg. sz. loaf...cooked 20 mins longer for the lg., 10 mins longer for the minis.   Otherwise...GREAT!

I discovered this recipe about a year ago and have made it at least 20 times. Everyone raves about it, it is simply delicious! My daughter likes to eat a slice of this bread with a dallop of whipped cream on top- it tastes just like pumpkin pie, only better. Highly recommended!!

MMMM MMMM MMMMMMMMMMMM!!!!  This pumpkin bread recipe is the best ever!  I made it last year for the first time and it's wonderful, only change I made is I added more spices and added Craisins to one loaf, chocolate chips to one, raisins to one, and left the rest plain (made a lot).  I actually think it's best plain!  Oh and the bread has a gorgeous color and TASTE, even my four and five year old cousins loved it! :o)

I've been asked to make this again and again.  We added walnuts and/or raisins with yummy results.  Little loafs make great winter-holiday gifts.

This was awesome!  The bread rose well and had a delightful texture and taste.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is becauset the original recipe would have been WAY too sweet with 4 cups of sugar that were called for.  I made it using 1 1/2 cups white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar as some other reviewers had suggested. And I think next time I may cut back by 1/2 cup.  I used applesauce in place of 1/2 the oil and thought that worked really nicely. I also recommend upping the spices to at least 2 or 2 1/2 tsp.  Especially the nutmeg!  Overall, a very yummy recipe--It made 2 loaves and 24 good sized muffins for me. (Muffins take about 22-24 min at same temperature).

This is similar to a recipe from the Joy of Cooking that I have misplaced.  It was delicious and moist.  I used pumpkin pie spice instead of the cinnamon, etc. as that's all I had handy and it tasted great.

Yummy, yummy for my tummy!  Rarely do I follow a recipe to a T, so here are my additions: I added 2 tsp. of all the spices instead of the 1 1/2 tsp.  I also added 1 tsp. of allspice, 1 tsp. ginger, 1 tsp. pumpkin spice and my own secret ingredient, 1/2 tsp. dried Orange Peel.  One reviewer said they used Rum Soaked Raisins, but since we are not big raisin fans, I decided to add Brandy Soaked Dried Cranberries instead, which turned out great!  This recipe yielded 36 muffins.  Also, for those of you who are lost as to how long to bake the muffins, they bake for anywhere around 22-24 mins. depending on your oven.  P.S. I also just threw in a whole 29 ounce can of pumpkin puree.

A good, dependable, classic pumpkin bread recipe that turns out just the way it's supposed to. Great as is, but would also be good with your favorite additions like raisins, nuts, or dried cranberries (which I had planned to add but couldn't find).  Prepared the recipe with no changes, only scaling this down to 24 servings for two loaves, using a 15-oz. can of pumpkin.  Baked perfectly at 1 hour.

Excellent!  Per others suggestions, I made a few changes: I used an entire 28 oz can of pumpkin, only 1/4 c. oil, and 1 1/4 c. applesauce.  This decreases the fat to 2 g per serving.  I also decreased the nutmeg to 1 tsp and decreased the sugar to 1 cup white sugar and 1 1/2 cups brown sugar.  It was delicious and still plenty sweet; it tasted like you could eat it for breakfast, not just dessert.  I also substituted all of the all-purpose flour with whole wheat pastry flour.  If you don't have whole wheat pastry flour, I'd substitute half of the all-purpose flour with regular whole wheat flour.  I also added 2 cups frozen cranberries.  Yummy!

HANDS DOWN THE BEST EVER EVER EVER!!!!  Moist and simply fantastic!  Perfect for the holidays because it makes so much and it’s a real winner in the gift-giving department!  Here’s what I’ve done to it, but again as is, it’s just wonderful!  I use 2 cns. (15oz ea.) Pumpkin, 2 t. salt, 2 t. cinnamon, 2 t. nutmeg & 2 t. cloves.  Everything else stays the same.  To make it even more special, I make a topping for it that consisted of walnuts and sugar, and people often have told me that the topping is the best part too!  The topping may be good, but this fantastic bread deserves all the credit!!   Try it!! You won’t be sorry you did!!

Scaled this recipe to make 1, 9X5 loaf; maybe that was the beginning of the end.   I found this bread to be very dry & there was no "pumpkin" flavor at all.   I will not make this again, it was very disappointing. Sorry.

Having pumpkin bread for Thanksgiving has always been a tradition in our family and we have always followed the same recipe for years until it was lost. After trying this recipe, it is now our new family recipe. This is the best pumpkin bread yet.

Great bread recipe.  I have now made four loaves.  One of my loaves was a bit undercooked and had the effect of pumpkin pie in the middle.  It was actually very good.  My husband and brother were fighting over the middle.

I don't know if my review counts since I altered it a little, but it turned out beautifully! I substituted pureed bananas for half the pumpkin, and cardamom and ginger for the nutmeg and cloves, and added walnuts. It was SO GOOD. I took a basket of it to 2 Thanksgiving dinners and it was a hit. The leftovers (there wasn't much!) were awesome with coffee the next day too. Oh, also I used fresh pumpkin instead of canned.

This is a wonderful Recipe. I have made it 3 times in two weeks for family, friends, a party and my sons school. As soon as the first batch was gone I was begged to make more. You wouldnt believe the rave reviews. I added my homemade cream cheese frosting.
It's easy and makes a great quantity.
Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

This one, by far, is the BEST!  I have tried three different recipes from this web site with 5 stars and this one is IT!  Why?  Because this bread doesn't have that dense, heavy home made texture.  This one is light, spongy, and moist.  I made 2 cupcacke trays and a loaf.  I put both cupcake trays in at the same time for 35 min.(then baked loaf seperately).   I made just  2 small changes:  I cut the oil  to 3/4 cup and added 3/4 cup of unsweetened applesauce.  I also put in 3 parts wht sugar and 1 part brown.  I sprinkled chopped pecans on the top and beautiful! Thanks Cheryl~ Love it!

Very good!  In an effort to be a little more healthy, I made the following changes.  . .  Reduced sugar a little (used 1/2 brown & 1/2 white).  Used 1/2 canola oil & 1/2 applesauce.  Used 1/2 all purpose flour and 1/2 white whole wheat flour.  Doubled cinnamon and added a little vanilla.  I think it still could have used more cinnamon and other spices.  Sprinkled tops w/ turbinado sugar - Yum!  Baked mini-loaves for 30 min. & they were perfectly done.  Thanks for a nice pumpkin bread recipe!
UPDATE:  This time I made the full recipe.  Used whole 29oz can of pumpkin.  Used 
1 1/2c of white sugar and 1 1/2c of brown sugar. Added 2 T vanilla.  Used 2/14c all purpose flour and 2 1/2c of white whole wheat flour.  2 heaping T of cinnamon and about 2tsp or so each of cloves and nutmeg.  Definitely needs more spices than it has in original recipe.  Also still used 1/2 canola oil and 1/2 unsweetened applesauce.  The consistency and spice was perfect w/ the changes.  This is the best pumpkin bread recipe!

This is a great recipe!! The other pumpkin breads I have tried from here weren't very good, so I was hestitate to try this. I sure am glad I did! I pretty much followed the recipe except I reduced the sugar by about a 1/2 cup (still was plenty sweet, believe me), used less oil (maybe 1/4 c less), used 2 cans of pumpkin 14.5 oz, added an extra tsp of each spice, added raisins, and nuts. My oldest daughter is allergic to nuts but the rest of us love them, so everything I make I fill one pan with batter, then add a cup of walnuts to the remaining batter so we can all enjoy what we like. Been working like a charm for 17 years. I would give this recipe more stars if I could. It is the exact texture I like my pumpkin bread, not dry, but perfectly moist. Even after 3 days it was better than when it was first baked. Keep it wrapped tightly in plastic so it won't dry out.

This was the second recipe I used for pumpkin bread this week.  The first was just so-so.  Thought my walnuts might have been rancid but decided to try another recipe (sans nuts).  This was fantastic.  It was so moist.  Very easy.  I increased the spices a bit as well since I like very flavorful things.  I'm a huge pumpkin bread fan and this is my new favorite recipe.  I didn't add nuts, chips, etc. and don't think it needs it.

I added this recipe to my recipe box in 2001 and have made it several times every year since then.  Very easy and people love it!

I made this recipe into muffins that my family could snack on during the day. Pumpkin is always great because it adds a lot of extra fiber, which sometimes is a much needed component of most diets. I cut this back to twelve servings. I didn't want to use a whole half cup of oil so I cut the amount by half and added an extra quarter cup of pumpkin puree. I also cut the sugar back to a scant three-quarters of a cup. The batter was a little dry (could have been because I messed with the serving amount) so I just added what was left in the pumpkin can (Trader Joe's 15 ounce can) and I threw in a teaspoon of vanilla extract. The muffins ended up getting a little overmixed which made them a little tough but they were very moist and had a nice flavor. 350* for about twenty minutes was just right--I got 12 biggish muffins out of a 12 serving adjusted recipe. Because I know what to add for next time to avoid that from happening, I'll write up my own custom version.

This is the best pumpkin bread with these changes!  Double the spices (except for cloves... they are very strong and will overpower).   Top with a simple crumb streusel (flour, brown sugar, butter, cinnamon & walnuts).  Just had a nice slice of this wonderful bread warm out of the oven, with some freshly ground starbucks whole bean Sumatra.  Heaven on Earth!   P.S.  I individually sliced and froze the extras so I can take to work and not spend $$ at the coffee shop  ;)   Enjoy!

Love this bread recipe but after reading many reviews decided to go for a healthier version. I used 4 cups whole wheat flour & 3/4 cup wheat germ in place of the flour;4 1/2 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice in place of all the spices; 1 1/2 cup applesauce in exchange for all of the oil; 3 cups of Organic Sucanat (free-flowing organic brown sugar in place of the regular sugar;and a 29 ounce can of pumpkin. I made muffins without muffin cups sprayed the pan with canola oil and baked at 350 for 20 min. Turned out good I am bringing them to a potluck at my son's school! YUMMY!

I thought the batch was going to be too large when I made it yesterday but all I have left is one small loaf.  We are planning on making muffins in place of dinner rolls for Thanksgiving!  Fantastic pumpkin bread!!

This was so moist and delicious.  I was looking for a way to sneak in vegetables/fruits for my 3 year old and this did it; especially with the addition of the chocolate chips!  (I made mini muffins.  Cooked at 400 for about 12 minutes.)

Love this recipe. I've made it just as is as well as with many variations....adding raisins and chopped pecans....or craisins. Have doubled the spices at times (I like strong flavor in pumpkin bread), I've used white whole wheat (my favorite), substituted 1/2 c applesauce for 1/2 c oil, used splenda in place of some of the white sugar, used a bit of brown sugar in place of some white sugar. The point is, I just don't think you can go wrong with this recipe, whether you use it as written or as a starting point for your creativity. LOVE IT.

This recipe was unbelievable.  I used the suggestions of other reviewers, and reduced the oil to 1 c., plus 1/2 c. melted butter.  I did 4 c. sugar, but half white and half brown, and I changed the spices, too: 2 tsp baking powder 2 tsp cinnamon 1 tsp nutmeg 1 tsp cloves.  With those changes, the spice combination was PERFECT.  Tasted just like what I think pumpkin bread should taste like.  It cooked faster in my glass loaf pan, but both loaves were incredibly moist (I made two loaves plus about 30 minimuffins).  I can't wait to show them off on Thanksgiving, and this is definitely my future pumpkin bread recipe of choice.  I can't imagine anyone having something bad to say about this bread.

In a word, WOW! This always turns out wonderfully moist. I have made it with pureed sweet potato, as well, and there is very little, if any, difference in flavor or texture. I sub Splenda for half the sugar, and no one who has not been told is ever any the wiser. I increase the spices according to my family's tastes, with the exception of cloves, and add 1-1/2 tsp ginger plus a generous dash of cayenne pepper for a hint of warmth. That never fails to make the guys go wild for this! I also add 2 Tb dark rum, which you can't taste in the finished product, but which adds a great depth of flavor, underscoring the spices to perfection. One noteworthy item...If made in a 9"X13" loaf pan as indicated, the resulting loaves are a bit shallow. It makes a much more impressive presentation if you bake it in a loaf pan of 8"X4", adding about 10-15 minutes to the baking time. Test at 50 minutes, then add time accordingly as necessary. Freezes well. What a fabulous recipe this is!

Everyone in the family (and preschool class) loved this recipe. I thought 4 C of sugar was going to be too much but the bread was not too sweet, just perfect.The only changes I made were to substitute applesause for the oil and use the entire 29 oz. can of pumpkin. From a single batch I made one large loaf, one mini-loaf, one dozen regular muffins, and two dozen mini-muffins. The mini-muffins took about 18 mins, the regular muffins about 30 mins, the mini-loaf about 40 mins, and the large loaf about 60 mins.

This could possibly be my very favorite allrecipes.com recipe! I often cut the recipe in half and using one can of pumpkin I get two perfect loaves. The first one is gone before it's cooled. I don't change a thing, it's perfect!

First of all, I am not reviewing my variation of this recipe that may or may not resemble the original, my reviews are always on the recipe as written. 

As written this is one of the best pumpkin breads I've had. It's sweet but not excessively so, very soft, and almost perfectly spiced. Made in loaf or muffin form it's yummy, especially the day after you make it. 

Having made this recipe several times the past couple of years, both the recipe as written, and with some tweaks there are some changes I make that result in a five star recipe. You will note that I rated the recipe as written four stars. 

The four cups of sugar is excessive. I've been reducing the sugar a little bit since the second time I made this. At three cups this is still very yummy, and I prefer the level of sweetness. While I always recommend making a recipe as written the first time, ESPECIALLY if you intend to review it, this is improved with less sugar. Additionally, I now make this with an extra half cup of pumpkin, not only is this more convenient, but the bread is denser and I find the flavor to be a bit better. I have tried this 1 cup of oil and 1/2 cup of applesauce. The taste of the bread was unchanged but I'm not a fan of the sticky moistness that resulted on the top of the bread. Also, I find that adding 1/4 - 1/2 tsp more cloves than called for really elevates the flavor of this bread.

Love this recipe as written, although I do use whole wheat pastry flour instead of all purpose and it turns out light and fluffy, not dense at all.  I like to make these into muffins, too, which I bake for 25 minutes at 350.  I also add in 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts.  Yummy, thank you for this recipe!

For Canadians, the contents of a 796ml can of pumpkin is perfect. This recipe is a keeper! I made 1 loaf pan and a 10x13" snacking cake...delicious and so easy!! I added more cinnamon since we love it, and used mace instead of cloves, but that's just a personal preference. Excellent recipe!!

Yummy. I tried it with subbed applesauce and my husband and I loved it. I didn't tell him it had no oil until after he raved about it.

Mmmm this recipe is great! I just found this recipe and I have made it twice in the last 3 days. All my friends and neighbors LOVE it! The only thing that I changed was I added a little bit of allspice and only added 1 teaspoon of cloves and 2 of cinnamon. I also made a glaze (just water, powdered sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg) to put on top of one of the loafs which was pretty good! Anyways...I love this recipe!

I took out all the oil and used applesauce. I like to do this because it gives the bread a great chewy texture. I made sure to  beat the eggs and pumpkin until it was light and fluffy which made the bread also spongier and lighter- which I love in quick breads. I added a bounty of walnuts and pecans and threw this all into a 9x13 and baked it for an hour. Delicious! Will make it again for sure but will experiment with vanilla extract and chocolate chips next time.

Mmmmm, Mmmmm, Mmmmmm! So moist! Unfortunately I cut the recipe down to make only 1 loaf. That was a big mistake! After cutting into the bread, it was devoured by the mouths of my family! The photo I took was the only reminance left of it! The only change I made was adding a touch more cinnamon. Otherwise I left everything as it was listed. I will surely be making this again and again!

Used 1-16oz. can pumkin, 1c. oil, 1/2c. melted butter, 2c. brown sugar, 2c. white sugar, 2 tsp. baking powder, 2 tsp. cinnamon, 1 tsp. nutmeg, & 1 tsp. cloves instead of what the recipe called for. I thought the extra spice called for might make it a bit too spicy and take away from the pumpkin flavor. It turned out to be the most delicious pumpkin bread I have ever made - moist & flavorful!

Very Good Recipe. I did alter this recipe just a little bit. Instead of 4c. white sugar,I used 2 cups of brown and 2 cups of white sugar. I doubled the cinnamon & nutmeg to 3 tsp. (left the cloves the same) Instead of 1 1/2 c. veg. oil, I used 1/2c. butter+1c veg.oil. I also added 2 Tbsp of vanilla exract. I made muffins(plain, with walnuts, and with choc. chips)and they were devoured by the entire family. This is a recipe easy enough for children to enjoy.

Being English, I've never made nor even tasted anything with pumpkin in before, but when my American fiance said his mom made the best pumpkin bread ever, I knew I had to rise to the challenge! This is a good easy recipe, and I was delighted with the results! I made one plain loaf, one with pecans and another with choc chips. My only complaint was that it was a little on the dry side - next time I will add a little more oil. Thanks for a great recipe!

I've tried other pumpkin bread recipes on allrecipes and this one is the best. Like other reviewers I use one large can, which adds a bit extra pumpkin, so I reduce the oil just a little, maybe 1/8 cup and I add an extra 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, just because I like it. You can definitely taste the clove flavor. I think it's nice, but if you don't care for cloves, you might want to reduce it. It makes excellent muffins also. What I offen do is make one loaf with mini chocolate chips (my fav), one loaf with chopped walnuts on top, and a dozen muffins, and I bake them all at once. Keep an eye on it. Mine sometimes gets done a little early and starts to get too brown on the edge so I reduce the heat part-way through to about 325. I took this to Thanksgiving this year and my husbands grandmother said it was the best bread she'd ever had.

This recipe received rave reviews from all ages tonight!  I was in charge of non-pie desserts for Thanksgiving and with all my planned baking done, two hours left to spare, and two lonely pie pumpkins sitting on my counter, I decided to throw this together.  I made a few slight mods... 3 cups of fresh puree (so much better than canned - worth the small effort), replace half of the regular sugar with dark brown sugar, replace half the oil with apple sauce, and replace half the white flour with wheat flour.  I baked it in a bunt cake pan for 50 min.  There was so much extra batter that I also made 12 cupcakes and a 8" round flat pan (each of those baked for 25 min).  Finally, I drizzled it all with a simple icing. Wonderful!  I will certainly make it again.

This recipe is amazing!!  I made it for Mother's Day Brunch and everyone loved it.  Next time I make it, I will use less oil and perhaps some applesauce - just to make it a bit healthier.  For special occasions though, this recipe will come out again and again.

I thought 3 cups of pumpkin was kind of an awkward measure, so I cut the recipe by 2/3 to use exactly 1 15oz can for 2 loaves. I followed the recipe exactly, baked for 1 hour, and they turned out great. Leaving one at home, and taking the other into the office tomorrow.

I have made this twice and my family LOVES it!  The first time I made as written and it was a five star bread.  The second time, I made it a bit healthier by following Sara Jane's recommendation of replacing the oil with applesauce, and I also cut the sugar to three cups (two white and one brown) because that was all I had in the house.  My family liked it even better that way!  We've eaten the full batch (yes, three loaves worth) in just a week!  My kids love it spread with peanut butter.  This makes great muffins, which cuts down the baking time and makes for a more portable snack.   This is the only recipe for pumpkin bread I will ever use.  Thanks Cheryl!

This is exactly like the recipe my mom gave me, I was so upset because I couldn't find it.  I started making this with fresh pumpkin, then switched to the canned pumpkin puree, and now use the pumpkin pie mix which eliminates having to add the spices separate.  My own mom didn't even notice (she makes everything from fresh pumpkin) and it saves a few steps, always received many compliments.  I will try it with unsweetened applesauce instead of oil like I read in one of the reviews.  I have never had a dry loaf, after I take them out of the oven, let them cool for a few minutes then wrap them in plastic wrap while still warm and put em' in the fridge immediately, leave in overnight.  Even if the top is a little hard (had a crappy oven once; temp issues) it makes everything moist.

This has always been a family favorite, just as is and great to give as a gift.  Since I make it so often I have lightened up the recipe.  I use applesauce instead of oil, I use all egg whites, only 3 cups of sugar and I add 1 cup of flax seed meal.  That way I can still make some with the mini chocolate chips and enjoy it too!  Try roasting your own pie pumpkin and pureeing it yourself, so awesome!

Great bread! 

I made 3 loaves like the recipe calls for-- using 2 whole cans of pumpkin. The glass dish seemed to bake best. I would reduce heat when using darker pans.

I substituted 1 C applesauce and 1/2 C Butter for the oil, and 1/2 tsp ginger for the clove. I also added 2 tsp's vanilla, for a smoother flavor.

A great holiday treat!

Very good. *A little bland for me. Next time I will up some of the spices. You don't usually see the same measurement for cinnamon, nutmeg & cloves. I also halved the recipe and made 2 decent sized loaves. 

*I am editing this review. I made this in the am. I am going back in the pm for another slice & the spices have had a chance to "meld" with each other & it is so much better. I would no longer call it bland. Thanks for sharing!

This was a great recipe!  I followed it exactly and put walnuts in the third loaf.  Save yourself some time measuring 3 cups of pumpkin, though.  It takes a whole 29oz can of puree.  I was craving pumpkin this fall and it made my house smell great!

I loved this recipe.  A wonderful fall-time nasty weather treat.  It made the house smell so good while it baked.  Smelled like holiday time!  I did make some modifications though, that some may want to consider:

*Only did 1/3 recipe to make a single loaf
*used whole wheat flour in place of 1/2 of the regular flour
*used applesauce for 1/2 of the oil
*used 1/3 cup brown sugar, the rest Splenda
*added 1/3 cup stewed raisins (raisins are so much better if you soak them for a bit in hot water before adding to a recipe!)
*added 1/2 cup chopped pecans
This recipe is sooo good.  Lots of raisins and nuts make it like a dessert, but without fat or much sugar and whole wheat flour, it is pretty darned healthy!

Awesome!  This is the best pumpkin bread I have ever made.  The outside is slightly crispy, and you can adjust the spices to suit your taste..(I added a bit more:).  Served it toasted w/jam and my hubby loved it.  Will definately make alot!

I made this recipe on a whim for the holidays and have made it half a dozen times in the past month.  This is amazing, moist and tasty and a nice change from cookies.  I only make one loaf at a time and replace half the oil with applesauce and cut 1/3 C sugar out and it is absolutely amazing.

Loved that it made three loaves.  I used 1 cup honey instead of sugar, applesauce instead of oil, freshly ground wheat flour instead of regular, and added about 1 1/2 cups chocolate chips.  Next time I probably won't add cloves.  (I'm just not a big fan of that flavor.)  I could also throw in some chopped walnuts if wanted to.  The amount of pumpkin equaled two cans.

Wish I could give this more stars!  It is out of this world good!  I made it exactly as directed however I did add about a 1/2 cup of chopped pecans and  I cut the recipe into 1/3's and made one big loaf.  I used real butter and melted a couple tablespoons in the pan and used it to grease the pan well before putting in my batter.  Made for a buttery crust.  I had to cook for about 20 minutes longer than directed probably because of my cheap oven.  The bread came out moist and dense on the inside and nice and crunchy on the outside.   I will be making this over and over again!  Perfect recipe for fall!!!

I made this pumpkin bread this morning so that I could take some to my Mom for Mothers Day.  (She was whining saying I never bake for her)  She (and I) was amazed at how great this stuff it.  I used the whole can of pumpkin and it turned out beautifully.  This is a keeper for sure!  Thank you for sharing!

SOOOOOOOO YUMMY.  I;ve made this with both the pumpkin, and also with zucchini (3 cups shredded) instead--and the family went overboard about it.  Since we are a family necessarily having to go gluten free, if you find you are in the same predicament, please see my custom version for gluten-free diets. :)

I made only one loaf and just divided each measurement by 3. I also added a little brown sugar to the top before baking. It turned out fantastic!

Super easy recipe.  When I first made this and pulled it out of the oven I was really worried because the tops of the loaves were hard.  After the bread cooled I stored each loaf in a gallon size ziploc bag and by the next morning the whole loaf was super moist and soft.  It had a wonderful flavor. The whole family loved it.  I will definately make this again because it was a nice change from my usual banana bread.

Yum! I made just 1/3 of this recipe, which made a medium-sized loaf. I replaced all of the oil with applesauce, used just a cup of sugar, and used part whole wheat flour. I also added 1/2 tsp of  ginger, vanilla, and salt, and 1/3 cup each of pecans and chocolate chips. I recomend cutting all the spices in half except for the cinnamon.

Delish!! I took some advice and I used less oil. I did 3/4 cup oil and 3/4 cup apple sauce. It was moist and tastes just like th pumpkin muffins at Panera. I can't wait to make again!

This was a great bread. I took it to my sons first grade Thanksgiving feast and all the kids that tried it went back for seconds. I did leave the cloves out as I don't really care for them. This recipe turned out three nice sized loaves. I will be making again!

This is my new favorite pumpkin bread recipe!    I subbed 1/2 cup of the oil for applesauce and changed the spices around a bit to suite my tastes.  Very good, make sure you dont overbake - mine went from almost done to done very fast.    ETA:  I've made this twice now and have figured out I need to take the bread out when the toothpick has some "doughy" crumbs on it...when I let it cook till it comes out clean, its just a bit overcooked - still moist and good, but better when taken out just a little sooner than I think I should.  I also like to glaze my pumpkin bread - I use a box of powdered sugar and pour in milk, small amt at a time till I get a nice thick consistency.  Add a tsp or so of maple flavoring and drizzle over the top of the loaves while still warm.  I use the throw away pans and pull them out so the glaze runs down the sides of the bread.  I like to freeze the bread, it seems to be even moister after thawed out.

So good! I used up the last of our homemade pumpkin puree (soooo easy to make...Cut the top off, cut pumpkin into wedges, clean out the "guts" and seeds....no need to be perfect...roast the wedges at 350 degrees for about 45 minutes. Then, use a serrated knife to peel away the skin. It will come off so easily. Mash the pumpkin, adding a little water at a time to get the right consistency, then use or freeze it in freezer bags....WHEW! That was a lot of typing!). Anyhoo, this was some delicious pumpkin bread...One of the best recipes I've ever used. I substituted about 1 1/2 tablespoons of pumpkin pie spice for the cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves. I also added about 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract, and it was so yummy! Thanks for an awesome recipe!

If I could give 10 stars to a recipe this would be it! This is the only pumpkin bread recipe I make. It is soft, pumpkiny, and spicy all at the same time. I have made it in loaves, muffins, and mini muffins.  It freezes VERY well, that way I don't eat all three loaves at the same time. ;-) I add a 29 oz or large can of pumpkin with no other changes and they come out perfect every time!! You have got to try this!!!

I love this recipe.  I usually make cookies out of it so I don't have to wait too long for the bread.  I scoop about 2-3 tbs. per cookie and they're huge, moist, cake-like cookies.  My oven is pretty hot so I bake them for about 14 minutes.  Everyone always asks for the recipe.

DELICIOUS!  I followed the recipe exactly as instructed (although I did have to cook the loaves an
additional 15 minutes) and it was exquisite.  This is a keeper.

This bread is excellent!  It is very moist and thick, but not too heavy.  It should be noted that I live in high altitude area before I give my tips...

First, I usually try the recipe as is before I change it.  But since I am not a fan of cloves, I added 1 tsp of pumpkin pie spice and a half teaspoon of ginger.  Also, for some reason, I felt the urge to add brown sugar, so I substituted 1 cup of white for 1 cup of brown.  
This is probably a no-brainer for an experienced baker, but for a novice like me, you want to make sure to rotate the loaves in the oven so each one is in the middle for the same amount of time.  I ended up leaving the loaf in the middle for too long before rotating, and that one had to bake ten minutes longer. Also, I thought the tops were getting a little hard towards the end (not burnt, just hard), so I added foil to the top of each one for the last 10-15 minutes of bake time.  Two loaves baked for about 50 minutes, and the other for an additional 10 minutes or so.  After they cooled in the loaf pan for 15 minutes or so, I quickly removed them and covered them in foil again.  This definitely kept the moisture in, and the top of the loaves were soft again!  
Thanks for the great recipe!

This is the second time I've made this.  People can't believe I made it myself.  They are amazed at how moist and tasty it is.  My friend who is a gourmet chef asked me for the recipe!  The only changes I made was that I scaled down the recipe and made two 8x4 loaves.  I added some ground ginger and used half the amount of ground cloves called for.  Store it in a ziplock bag and it tastes even better the next day.

I tried this recipe today I made 3 loafs with regular sugar and I made another recipe with splenda instead of sugar i used the same amount of splenda as reg sugar and I added an additional egg to it as well. For both I added  more 2 tablespoons more of cinnimon, 1tsp more of nutmeg, I then added 1 1/2 tsp of allspice. Both turned out excellent the one with splenda tasted just as good as the one with reg sugar.

Yup, this is the one to die for.  I liked this recipe a lot because you can use the large can of pumpkin puree, unlike most pumpkin bread recipes.  The other plus is that this calls for half baking powder and half baking soda.  Don't fall for those recipes that call for all baking soda because you can really taste it in the bread.  The only change I made to this was to cut the oil down to one cup.  This recipe really is "the best".

Tip: 2 cans pumpkin should equal the 3 cups you need. I added finely chopped pecans to one loaf and it was very good.

One word: AMAZING!! I halved the recipe, on the off-chance it might not turn out the way I wanted, and now I'm going to have to make more as we've already demolished half of the warm bread! I used half brown & half white sugar, and added dried cranberries to one of the pans. Delicious both ways! I used a wooden toothpick to check for doneness, because the "spring-back" test wasn't quite working. The bread came out with a great cracked top and slid out of the pan quite easily when I transferred to cooling racks. Thanks, Cheryl-- my family has a new favorite pumpkin bread recipe, just in time for the holidays! :)

Simply awesome! I made two loaf and the rest in muffins (don't recommend muffin papers). I used fresh pumpkin, too. The amount of batter involved was overwhelming at first and I had to transfer twice to a bigger bowl to get it all mixed properly, but, who cares? It was truly amazing stuff - and it goes fast! Next time, I'll sprinkle Sugar-in-the-Raw on top for a sweet/slightly crunchy bonus :o)

I adjusted the recipe for 12 and made it into a muffin type of pan. I do not remember how long I let them stay in the oven but I kept good track of them until the knife i stabbed them with was clean. I put one fourth of a cup of chocolate chips in. I was not sure how much to put in. I think this was a good amount. They came out great! Nice and moist. So far everyone that has had one loves em! This is the first thing I have ever baked :D. Very Happy with the results. I will make more! They are for thanksgiving! Yay me.

This is a simple, but well received Pumpkin bread. I had my sister in law come up from Tennesse with her husband to my sister's house, so I took two loaves and kept one for my family. The sweet bread was still warm two hours later as I wrapped two loaves in foil 10 minutes after I took if out of the oven. The pumpkin comes in first, along with a hint of cinnamon, but it is the nutmeg that pops in your mouth. Delicious. The cloves come in last. Delicious, simple and warm. I would make this again. Watching the video helped in the process. I added the dry into the wet, but slowly. Cheers!

This recipe is fantastic! I also substituted applesauce for oil and used two cans of pumpkin instead of measuring out 3 cups, and the bread turned out wonderfully moist and delicious. I added chocolate chips, flaxseed meal, and I used a combination of whole wheat and all purpose flour to give it a little more fiber. Even with those changes the bread was extremely moist and wonderful not to mention how good it smells while it is baking. My family walked in the door and all exclaimed how delicious it smelled.

With the variations that I made my cook time was 75 minutes, but the bread turned out perfect. I would suggest just making the 3 loaves from the recipe because they get eaten quickly!

5 stars is not enough!  This is an amazing recipe.  I scaled it back by 1/3 to make 24 muffins. I love pumpkin pie spices ..which is essentially what the spices in this recipe are, so I increased them by 1/2. And added ginger and vanilla extract. An important key to making muffins or any quick bread is to not over mix the batter.  Doing so will make them tough after baking. I love this recipe.  Ill be making it again at least 2 more times before the new year!

I made this with my gluten free flour blend I found on the land o lakes web site (which I now use for everything) and it was yummy. I made them into cupcakes and threw in some walnuts and made a coconut frosting, per my bf's wishes, and it was GF heaven!

This is easily the best recipe for pumpkin bread I have ever made.  I followed the recipe exactly except that I replaced half of the oil with applesauce.  Made an already yummy recipe even better!  My family raved about it!

ridiculous, add nuts or rasins if you want. use half brown half white sugar and i use 2 small cans for a little extra pumpkin. also IMPRTANT: 1 cup of applesauce and 1/2 cup of oil cuts this to almost no fat and makes it taste waaaay better i swear.

Yum!

I look for ways to make recipes more healthy...so here's what I did. I used 1 C of applesauce and 1/2 Cup of oil, 2 C of Swerve (art sweetener) and 2 C of sugar, I added some pumpkin and decreased some baking powder (high altitude) and used 100% whole wheat flour. It was heavenly!

Love love this recipe!! I had previously tried the Maine Pumpkin Bread recipe (also on this site); but this beats it, hands down.  I did make some modifications per the recommendations of other users.  First, I replaced all the oil for applesauce (1:1 ratio).  Second, I only used 2/3 of the recommended sugar servings.  Third, I doubled the cinammon & nutmeg servings.  Fourth, I added ginger and pumpkin spice, as well as a dash of vanilla.  Lastly, I threw in some chocolate chips ( I would recommend mini-chocolate chips).  The result was pure deliciousness.  Here's another tip:  Heat the bread for a few seconds so that the choco chips melt into the bread.  
This is my go-to bread recipe.  Seriously delicious and easy to make.

Does anyone have any suggestions for how to avoid over-browning the crust? I've made two batches of pumpkin bread in the past week, and in both cases, I've had to leave a loaf in the oven 15 to 20 min longer than the recipe recommends, in order for a toothpick to come out clean. I've tried lowering the heat for the final 20 minutes, but the crust still gets browner than I'd like. Thoughts? Should I just lower the temp even further, and be patient? Does the toothpick need to come out completely clean, or no? Thanks!

I hate to be different, but I really thought this bread was ok, but not spectacular.  The amounts of eggs, oil, and sugar could really be cut back and the cooking time was off for me.  I think it's a great starting point for making your own recipe with derivations, but as it is, it could use some work.  There are a lot of pumpkin bread recipes out there that work better as they are written.

Warning--If you're not too fond of cloves, reduce the amount to less than 1 tsp.  I had already reduced cloves to 1 tsp. and increased the cinnamon to 2 tsp. and I felt the bread tasted way too much of cloves.  I would suggest 1/2 tsp of cloves.  The recipe is technically good, and i did replace half the oil with applesauce.  Very good other than the cloves!!  I will make this again with less cloves.  Good quantity for sharing.

I cut the sugar by 1 cup. The next time I'll reduce the cloves by 1/2 tsp. I thought the cloves were a bit over-powering. But over all, this is a very good recipe. IT'S A KEEPER!

Nice recipe! Made as written except for two things. I added 3 cups of chopped pecans and used the whole 29oz. can of pumpkin puree. Baked for 60 minutes but added another 10 to get a clean tooth pick. After cutting a slice, I noticed that it could have gone another 5 maybe. Didn't alter the taste however!! I like the size of the recipe too. When you have the oven hot and you're making dirty dishes, you may as well make it worth while!!

Great bread, but it didn't have enough of the spice flavor, and also I prefer larger/taller loaves. I used 4 1/2 cup sugar, between 4-5 tsp cinnamon (maybe more), an extra shake of nutmeg, and between 4-5 tsp cloves (maybe more). Also, instead of making 3 small loaves, I divided the batter between 2- 9x5 bread pans.  After these small changes, it went from 4 stars to AMAZING!!!!! :) Great recipe!!!

I doubled the spices but omitted cloves, as I didn't have any. Baked about an hour in disposable 9.5x6 pans. This bread is excellent -- Very moist and dense, but not TOO dense, just fluffy enough. A nice mild pumpkiny flavor that's not too spicy or sweet. Next time I would probably add more spices and perhaps use ginger as well so there's a bit more bite. I imagine this will taste just delicious with a cup of coffee. I made a loaf with milk chocolate chips as well, which came out good, but the milk chocolate was a bit too sweet and overwhelms the pumpkin flavor -- I'll use less chips next time and maybe use semisweet or white chips instead. Overall a tasty bread and I'll make it again.

I made this recipe with two and three quarters cups of the flour being whole wheat, with three and a half cups of pumpkin, and also cutting the sugar to two cups, cutting the oil to 1/2 cup (the rest of a one cup measure I filled with applesauce), and using only 5 large eggs.  I also increased the cinnamon to 2 teaspoons, added 1/2 teaspoon of allspice, and added chocolate chips.  What would have been the third loaf I put in muffin tins while two loaves started baking, and put them in when there was 30 minutes left on the timer.  Everything comes out at the same time, and my family eats this pumpkin bread like it's dessert!

If I could give this more than 5 stars I would!  I have been making it for a couple of years. I recently made them using mini muffin pans (13 minutes).  I freeze them in baggies w 3 then put them in the kids lunch box!

Outstanding! I made half a recipe, which made 10 jumbo muffins. They were done in 35-36 minutes. I added 1 cup chopped walnuts and 1 cup raisins, which I put in a bowl of water in the microwave for 1 minute to plump and soften. These were sooooo good. I should have made a whole recipe. I know I will next time. Best pumpkin bread/muffins I've ever had!

This recipe is very good as is.  I had to use a can of pumpkin pie mix because my local store does not have regular canned pumpkin, but everything worked out great. I've baked with the regular pumpkin before and it always comes out great. Everyone who tries this bread loves it.

Let me start by saying I'm a terrible cook - definitely a beginner! This recipe has become my go-to for impressing people.  My family and my husband's family can't get enough of it! I make two substitutions in this recipe: I use applesauce instead of vegetable oil and I use Splenda in place of 1/2 the sugar.  Delicious!

Really good!!! I made half of the flour whole wheat, used 2/3 cup applesauce and 1/3 cup olive oil rather than a full cup of oil (next time I'll use all applesauce), and added a tablespoon of pumpkin pie spice, a tsp vanilla, and a tsp maple flavoring. I also sprayed the top of the loaves with butter-flavored PAM and sprinkled a little brown sugar on top. YUM! Baked for an hour and came out perfect! Thanks for the recipe! :)

Fantastic!  I made a half recipe and ended up with one full loaf and 14 mini muffins.  I used egg substitute for 1 of the eggs and used a half and half combo of applesauce and canola oil.  Next time I'll reduce the sugar by about 1/2 cup and will increase the spices a little bit.  The texture was perfect.  I baked the loaf for 1 hour and the mini muffins for 20 minutes.  I'll make this again but also want to try the Downeast Maine Pumpkin Bread recipe on this site to compare it - don't see how it could be better though!

I cut this recipe by 1/3- just a "test" batch of muffins. Excellent! I made 14 muffins, baking 350 for 35 minutes. Made it just as is, except I didn't have cloves so I doubled the cinnamon, but I think I'll substitute pumpkin spice next time. I'll make these when guests come next week for the holidays.

This recipe seems similar to other listings, but because I picked it because it has both baking powder and baking soda, which (I believe) gives it a really nice rise (perhaps it is more like cake than bread).  My kids went crazy over this, and it really does keep well. Loved it!

This was an excellent recipe, although I did tweak it (like I do to most recipes).  I added about 1/2 teaspoon of rum extract and two teaspoons of vanilla extract.  In addition, I doubled the nutmeg and the cloves and tripled the cinnamon.  I also added a couple cups of raisins.  I took this to a community thanksgiving meal and it was a huge hit.  Although it does make a ton of bread!  One thing I noticed was that even if I use different ovens, I always have to cook it longer than they say!

I love this recipe.  I followed someone else's advice and used unsweetened applesauce instead of oil and the results were wonderful.  I've made this in loaves and I've also cut the recipe in 1/2 and made muffins which work well too.  You just need to adjust your cook time if doing muffins.  Great for sharing with others!

This was a delicious recipe. I gave it 4 stars only because it had too much clove flavor in it. If you love cloves do the full amount. Next time I will probably use 1/2 a teaspoon. I also used 3 cups of sugar and a splash of vanilla. And replaced the oil with applesauce. Made a loaf and a bunch of muffins. 30 mins for the muffins and a little over an hour for the loaf.

I was a bit leary over the size of the recipie...but I had two 15oz cans of pumpkin to use, so I figured 'what the heck'.      I brought a piece to my boyfriend, who had just gotten out of the shower. As soon as he had the bite in his mouth, he dropped to his knees in front of me on the bathroom floor and said, "I want you to stay with me for the rest of my life." =) I'll be using the recipe again, for sure!    I think the original recipe calls for way too much sugar- I used 2 C lightly packed brown sugar, and 1 C Sugar in the Raw, substituted 1/2 C gingerbread yogurt and 1/2 C butter for the oil, and added 3T pumpkin pie spices, 1 T cinnamon, two pinches clove, and a pinch of nutmeg. The recipe baked quickly with 3 minutes to spare from the 1 hour mark. They were very dark brown on top, and at first I was afraid I had burnt them- but it's just a darker bread. The bread is *very* moist. I wouldn't use any more than 1 C of oil/butter substance if you use 30oz pumpkin puree.  I made it in one 9x5" pan and a larger 9x11" pan. I will be taking some to my families' Thanksgiving....if we don't eat it all first!

Phenomenal!  I substitute the vegetable oil with light tasting olive oil, use the whole 29 oz can of pumpkin and add 2 cups crushed walnuts.  The additional pumpkin makes it extra moist.   I have received so many complements on this!

Excellent! My family loved this for breakfast today! It took 55 min. to bake in my oven. Used all unsweetened applesauce-no oil, half white sugar/half brown sugar, and instead of spices recommended I used 5t. pumpkin pie spice & 1.5t. cinammon. Chill overnight (for more intense flavor), warm up a slice & add a dallop of whipped cream on top for a fun dessert! I will try adding raisins or mini choc.chips next time.

This is the best Pumpkin Bread I have ever tried!!! It is so moist(even the next day)and flavor rich that there is no reason for butter or cream cheese and with me that is a must. But this bread is just too good to to mess with! I followed the recipe almost exactly only a few minor changes, like someone else I used the whole can (29oz) of pumpkin, I always add a little extra spice(just about doubled what was called for). I added a pinch of salt (be careful more than a pinch would ruin it fast!) and a bit of vanilla and of course walnuts. Oh yeah I replaced 1/2 cup of sugar with 1/2 cup of brown sugar. Also I baked it on 350 for 50 than turned the oven off and left it in there for about an hour because it was not fully cooked and i had to leave. What a wonderful thing to come home to! The whole family loved it and so did the neighbors who could smell it cooking at their house and had to try some.  I am going to try it in my pumpkin roll for the holidays. This recipe is a keeper!!! Happy Baking!

I just finished making this bread.  Once it cooled, I tasted some with cream cheese.  That's all I can say is, "Delicious!".  As others stated this is very tasty.  I made the recipe as is except I only used 1 tsp. cloves, and added in the pumpkin pie spice, as recommended by someone else.  I also adjusted to cooking temperature down to 325 F, and cooked for and hour and 20 minutes.  Came out very moist.  This is a keeper.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was sooo delicious!... I made 2 loaves and 12 muffins with this recipe.  I couldn't stand to put more than 1 cup oil I substituted 1/2 cup more pumpkin for the rest of the oil.  I baked the muffins 3/4 full for 30 min. and they were perfect; I baked the loaves for 1 hour but needed about 5-7 more minutes.  I had a quarter sized douhy spot in the middle that I didn't notice until we ate most of the loaf!   I also made Cinnamon Honey butter to top it.  Yum!!

Really good.  I reduced the recipe to 24, which makes 2 loaf pans and makes all the ingredients more "normal"--one can of filling, 3 cups of flour, 1 tsp of most of the other dry ingredients.  I added walnuts, and just a touch more of each spice b/c I like that.  Delicious.

Wow I was surprised at how moist and delicious this pumpkin bread is! I did make several substitutions for a healthier recipe. For the oil I used 1/2 cup applesauce, 1/2 cup banana yogurt, and 1/2 cup oil. I also used 1 cup of wheat flour in place of a cup of the white flour. I made three 8x4 loaves and they came out wonderful. One change I will make next time is to reduce the spices slightly (I enjoyed it as is but it's a little strong for my family). Thanks for the recipe!

I am sure this recipe is wonderful as is, but for anyone who wants to change it up to make it a bit more healthful, here is what I did.  And it was very tasty!!

For the oil, I used olive oil and substituted half of it with applesauce.  I used turbinado/raw sugar in place of the white sugar, and cut it back 3 cups and added 1/2 cup of molasses.  I used 4 cups whole wheat flour in place of all-purpose, and added 3/4 cup of wheat germ.  I left off the cloves because I didn't have them.  I also threw in about a cup of chopped walnut pieces, then sprinkled some of the chopped nuts over the top of each loaf before putting it in the oven.

I guess by the time I finished, it was like a whole new recipe, but it tasted really good and I was able to feel pretty good about eating it!

I made this as Christmas gifts this year and received rave reviews.  This recipe made 8 small loaves.  I glazed them with a cinnamon glaze made of 1 cup powdered sugar, 1 tsp cinnamon and 2 tbs milk.  It was a nice compliment.

This was delicious!  I was overwhelmed with all the leftovers though, guess I should have stuck the extra loaves in the freezer.  Will do that next time or reduce the recipe.  Used a cream cheese frosting as a topper- YUM!

Wonderful! I've made this multiple times - everyone loves it! To make slightly healthier, I use half whole wheat flour, and half regular flour (because it is so moist, there is no taste difference). To make slightly unhealthier, I put cream cheese frosting on the muffins - Yum!

I've made this recipe twice for get togethers with my parents and everyone has loved it.  The first time, I used a cup of splenda, cup of brown sugar, and a cup of white sugar.  The second time, I followed the recipe with the full 4 cups of white sugar, and I added walnuts and raisins.  I liked this version much better. I feel like it was moister and had a better flavor.  This is such a great recipe that encompasses the feeling of fall! I plan to use this for all my pumpkin bread recipes now.

Really delicious!!!! I only had a 29oz. can of pumpkin puree in the pantry so I added the whole thing, I substituted  one of the cups of white sugar for 1 cup of unpacked brown sugar, and another cup of white sugar for splenda....couldn't taste the difference except that I feel like the brown sugar made it even better. I also added about 2 tsp vanilla! Make sure you add that clove because it really kicks up the flavor in your pumpkin bread!!!

This pumpkin bread is sooo good!!  Years ago I had a recipe for pumpkin muffins that was given to me in a home economics class I had to take in high school.  They were the best tasting pumpkin muffins I had ever had, but being young and careless I misplaced the recipe and never found one that came even close to having the same wonderfully moist and delicious flavor.  I've tried many different pumpkin muffin and bread recipes over the years and not one could compare...until now.  This pumpkin bread is the absolute closest I have come to finding a recipe that could replicate the great flavor of those pumpkin muffins from years ago.  I love it and this recipe is one that I plan to hang onto for years to come.  Thank you so much for sharing it!

I made this recipe a little healthier and still found it to be the very best I have ever had!  I replaced 1/2 cup of the oil with 1/2 cup plain lowfat yogurt (reduction of 885 calories!) and I used half whole wheat flour.  It turned out so well that next time, I will try replacing half the oil with yogurt.  A great recipe!

This recipie is wonderful. I made a couple of batches for friends and people at work last christmas time and now in September with the first chill in the air  I am getting calls for more bread. I added a little vanilla extract and about 1/4 of a cup of  maple syrup, which was the flavor no one could place but everyone loved!

SUGAR FREE/LOWER FAT VERSION: I lowered the fat my using 1 cup apple sauce mixed with 1/2 cup veg oil. I also used egg substitute instead of eggs. I sprayed the pans with pam spray instead of using butter. I used 4 cups of splenda in place of the sugar. I added 2 boxes of raisins and 1 bag of walnuts. It was fabulous! I also needed to cook it a bit longer (like 5 minutes)

Very tasty, moist and delicious!!  A few tweaks like the half brown/half white sugar idea and the half butter/half oil made this recipe perfect!!

Very good! This bread disappeared fast when I brought it into the office. The batch with the mini chocolate chips was my favorite.

I had a craving for pumpkin loaf and had been missing my Starbucks fix with the fall. I followed the recipe almost to the tee. I swapped out 1/2 cup of oil for unsweetened applesauce but kept everything else exact. The loaves came out PERFECT!!! I took them out about 7 minutes too soon so I had a super soft spot in the center.  My husband and I have been eating a slice with our morning coffee. SO delicious! I froze the other two loafs initially but will be taking another out soon as the first one is almost gone, 2 days later. Does anyone have this recipe but with smaller ratios? I'd love to be able to make just one loaf here and there.

This is about the best pumpkin bread recipe I have ever had.  I used a 28ox can of pumpkin rather than measure the 3 cups.  I used applesauce rather than the oil and used 2 cups brown sugar + 2 cups regular sugar.  I also added a pecan streussel topping to it and that just gave it a little crunchy sweetness.  I would definitely make this again.

Best Ever!  We made muffins out of it as well, baking approximately 20 min. and they were to die for.  We then made 2 loaves.  Everyone in our home loved them, and my husband shared some a work and everyone wanted the recipe.

I make this recipe every year and it is fabulous.  Best pumpkin bread recipe I've ever tried.  As others have suggested, may try substituting the oil with applesauce next time, just to make it a little healthier, since I have a hard time stopping at just one slice!

I scaled back this recipe to make 2 9x5 loaves and it came out fantastic. I also added 2 cups of dark chocolate chips and 1 cup of chopped walnuts and reduced the sugar just a bit since I was adding the chocolate chips. Baking for 55 minutes was just the right amount of time. I made this to bring to a work function, but will definitely be making more for my family and I to enjoy.

This bread is moist, robust, and full of spice flavor! It cuts beautifully and you can add chocolate chips, walnuts, whatever you want to it! Warm out of the oven with some butter and a drizzle of honey...heaven! I made this exactly as the recipe is written and it was amazing!

Wow! This pumpkin bread was outstanding! I made 2 9X5 loaves and a dozen medium muffins to take to a gathering. I made very few changes: used 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce in place of part of oil; used all of a 29 oz. can of pumpkin; subbed 3/4 cup of whole wheat flour for part of the 4 3/4 cup called for; used 2 cups white sugar and 1 cup brown; and added chopped pecans to 1 loaf. The amount of spices called for was perfect! This bread is moist and flavorful. The recipe was similar to one I've used for 40+ years, but was much better! Thanks for sharing it!!

I've made this recipe twice this week, as written. Next time I'm going to try reducing the oil and adding applesauce, but it is amazing with all the oil. Right now my kitchen smells amazing! I didn't change anything except I added walnuts. Yum!

Excellent bread.  I had 1 cup of leftover frozen pumpkin and found this recipe.  I cut it down to 12 servings (1 loaf) and added chopped walnuts.  I also used my homemade pumpkin pie spice (1 1/2 tsp) so it's just perfect.  Thanks Cheryl for this yummy recipe to use my 1 cup of pumpkin :)

Love this recipe!  I've made it too many times to count and it always turns out perfectly.  Key is to make sure it's done after the 1 hour of baking.  Toothpick can't have a drop off wet dough on it or the  top of the loaf will not be done.  Be patient! :)  I love the large recipe as it uses up 1 large can of pumpkin exactly even though it's slightly too much pumpkin and it turns out great.  I freeze the extra loaves that don't get devoured in the first 2 days.  My kids and husband LOVE this recipe and it smells amazing while baking.  Perfect fall and winter recipe.

Pumpkin Awesomeness. I have been making the recipe for years. Its the first thing we do to celebrate the beginning of Fall.  I am always asked for the recipe. It is easy to make and very adaptable. It is perfect the way it is, however we change it up sometimes by adding nuts (pecans, walnuts, or even pumpkin seeds), or dried fruits (raisins, cranberries). Its sweet like a cake, you can reduce some of the sugar and it is still great. The recipe is huge, it makes 2 loaf pans (one for us, one we share with friends), but you can easily halve it. I can serve it to my dairy free friends, it makes great french toast, or a fall flavored bread pudding. The blend of spices is perfect. My husband was a former pumpkin hater, after eating this he was willing to eat pumpkin in other recipes as well.  Would not be fall without it!

Made this for the first time a few weeks ago and made a loaf, then made some batter into muffins to which I added chopped walnuts and garnished with a half walnut on top half way through baking.  This let the walnut toast just a little.  I packed them in a pretty box for another friend's birthday.  They were a HUGE hit! I made the rest into mini loaves.  NOTE: This recipe makes a TON of batter, I had to use the crock from my slow cooker to do the final mix as I had no bowl big enough!

O.M.G. This was great! The only change I made was to use 1/2 tsp. less cloves and add 1/2 tsp. ground ginger in their place. Also, FYI, a 29-oz. can of pumpkin puree is just about 3 cups. That's what I used. People raved about this one. I think it would be great with walnuts too, and maybe dried cranberries! Oh, and DO make it at least a day before you plan to serve it. It's MUCH better ... more flavorful and moist ... the next day and beyond!

Delicious bread!  Very moist and light.  I switched out the oil for applesauce and used wheat flour for my husband's diet and it was still excellent!  Thanks for the recipe.

Love love love this recipe!  I make this into regular sized and mini muffins.  They are perfect to throw in my (very picky) 1 & 3 year olds' bags for breakfast when they're at daycare.  I do change it a little to make it a little healthier.  I put half brown/white sugar, half wheat/white flour and half oil/applesauce.  Also, I only add about 3 total cups of sugar because it seemed too sweet with 4.

This is a delicious recipe. I did add 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract (I made a half recipe); and I had some zucchini that I grated and added into the batter. Also, I substituted applesauce for the oil, to drop the fat content. I baked one loaf for an hour and used the extra batter for mini muffins (15-18 minutes at 350 degrees). So yummy!

Why the insane amount of sugar in all the pumpkin bread recipes?  I'll keep looking for one that doesn't give me cavities just reading it!  I could cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup which is all I ever use, but given the large amount of sugar used, not sure how it would effect the bread.

Amazing flavor!  I found that I had to put less in the bread pans otherwise it would not cook completely in the middle.  Once that was fixed this bread was a raving success!

I make this bread for my dad who is a diabetic. He LOVES it and it doesn't affect his blood sugar levels too much. He lives in Ohio and I make him 3 loaves to take home. He freezes it and eats a little at a time. Great recipe!

This bread was amazing.  Moist, flavorful, easy to throw together.  I made 2 big loaves and 5 mini-loaves.  Sprayed pans with veg spray instead of fat and flour.  Honestly was delicious but definitely a holiday treat - not healthy for everyday consumption!  Thanks for the recipe, Cheryl!

I make this bread throughout the Thanksgiving and Christmas seasons.  My kids love it and always beg for more.  The only change I make is the bake time.  I always have to bake this over an hour.

I got a lot of Acorn Squash and some butternut squash from my CSA. So I pureed that and added an equal amount of Pumpkin Pie Spice as the other spices and it turned out very good.

I first made this recipe following it to the letter - it was WAY too sweet. The next time, I cut the sugar (making 36 muffins - I used 3 cups of sugar instead of 4) - still too sweet IMO. Next time I am going to just cut it in half. I also added 1t of ginger.

This recipe is a keeper! It is so good! My husband and our three kids love it too. I made some slight changes. I use half the amount of veg oil and sub the other half with unsweetened applesauce. I also increased the spices as suggested and got it perfected. This is a really moist loaf and I've made it several times now and it's always perfect! Smells and tastes delicious!! I bake it in mini loaf pans and bake for 35 minutes.

This recipe is fantastic and easy! Thank you for posting it! I've made it three different times now; once as muffins and a large loaf, and twice as triple loaves. EVERYONE loves these! You know how some recipes have a different outcome each time you bake them? Not this one, its a no failure, same results, wonderful dense bread. You can eat plain, cold, warm, add stuff to it, or butter it. It tastes better the longer you leave it in the fridge(hopefully not too long its so good), and from what I hear-freezes well. The only thing I did differently was add the entire can of pumpkin, and it was actually pumpkin pie filling, not puree so there was tons of flavor. Also, I just substituted 4.5 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice for the single spices, which is the exact equivalent of adding up the three individuals. Make this, you won't regret it!!

Very good!!!  I baked one in a bundt pan because I only had two 9 x5 loaf pans and the recipe was plenty for the bundt and the two loaves.  

The only changes I made were to replace 1 1/2 cups of flour with and to add about 3 tbsp of ground flax, for the sake of nutrition (though there is a lot of oil and sugar in this recipe ;-)  Overall, delicious!

I made this exactly as listed, although I reduced the portions for 2 loaves (24 servings) instead of 3.  Very, very good - nice and moist - and very easy to make.  Now that I've made it once, I'll play around with some of the others' suggestions, using applesauce for some of the oil, more spices, etc, just for fun, but I'll definitely make this again!

This bread is delicious! As many others posted, I also made a few changes. I added the entire can of pumpkin and used half apple sauce and half oil. I also used 1 less cup of sugar and the bread was plenty sweet. If you don't own a massive mixing bowl I'd suggest making this in a dutch oven style pot. As I was making it I was alarmed by how much bread there would be, but my family of 3 ate it all in 4-5 days and they're asking me to make more already!

It was my first try to make pumpkin bread. Used fresh pumpkin puree and added 1tsp of ginger to the above spices. I reduced oil to 1 cup and sugar to 3cups. It was sweet enough. Will surely make it again.

Delicious! Nice and moist! I used fresh pumpkin puree, and added more cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves. I also put chocolate chips in one loaf. This recipe can be easily altered to make just one or two loaves. It was very popular in my house!

This was soooooooo good. Every time i go to get a bite of it, i can't stop eating it! Everyone who has tried it has loved it too. As it was the first time making it, we tried making one loaf with apple sauce substituted for the oil, and one just with oil. I liked the apple sauce one better, (plus its healthier!) but i know of other people that liked the oil one better. Overall, this is my favorite pumpkin bread i have ever tried!!!!

I made cupcakes out of this, frosted with cream cheese frosting from another recipe and sprinkled the tops with chopped walnuts.  Delicious!!  I have a thermometer in my oven, cooked them a dozen at a time, 350 for 25 minutes, set them to cool on a little cooling rack and frosted.  So YUMMY!

I made one large loaf in a 9x5" glass Pyrex loaf pan and 17 large muffins.  The muffins were done in about 32 minutes, (I sprayed the muffin tins with Baker's Joy and they slid out perfectly when done) and I had to bake the loaf for an additional 20 minutes (checking every 10) because the middle was gooey.  Both the loaf and muffins were so delicious!  The spiciness is on the milder side so if you like your pumpkin bread spicier, definitely increase the spices. My 8-year-old and husband went wild over them.  They are even better the second day.  My family just finished everything up and are already asking when I am making more.  Next time I will increase the spices and try them with less oil to see how they taste, but honestly these are incredible as is!!!

This recipe is incredible as is!  Absolutely wonderful!  In an attempt to make this amazing recipe more healthy, I replaced 1 cup of the oil with unsweetened applesauce and cut out 1 cup of sugar.  THE RESULT - not as amazing as the original recipe, but still pretty good.  Don't believe the other reviewers who say it will be "just as good" without the oil.  It's not "just as good", but still yummy and much more healthy.

The flavor of this bread was delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly, and think everything was well balanced, except it is very oily.  In my opinion, 1 1/2 cups vegetable oil was a LOT of oil.  Next time I make this, I would substitute apple sauce (or even more pumpkin puree) for half of the oil.  Also, I was missing some kind of textural contrast... some kind of crunch or chewyness.  Next time, I will add walnuts, or raisins, or craisins, or a combo.  This is a solid, basic, and delicious recipe, but I look forward to making it again with these changes to better suit my tastes.

This was a really quick & easy recipe. I made a few changes: I used 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 white flour, 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar, replaced the oil with unsweetened applesauce, and used pumpkin pie spice instead of the cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves. The result was a dense, delicious bread that was ready in 1 hour. My big complaint with this recipe is that there is just WAY too much sugar. When combining the sugars in the beginning I just kept thinking that it sure seemed like a lot, and I was definitely right - the crust on my loaves are sticky to the touch! Next time I am going to use half the sugars and I'm sure it will turn out just as good.

Delicious!! I scaled the recipe to make 1 dozen muffins, added chocolate chips (per my daughter's request), and used pumpkin pie spice instead of the cinnamon/nutmeg/clove mixture. They cooked for about 25 minutes, and turned out perfectly. They were simple to make, and I had everything on hand. Thanks for a keeper!

The most moist, incredible bread ever.  It's better than cake!  I have made it three times in two days.  I scale down to 12 servings and make a loaf at a time.  This stuff is to die for!

Made these as muffins instead of bread.  They raise very little, so fill the muffin cups full.  I cut the sugar and oil by 1/2 cup each and they were still great.  Dense, moist, flavorful.  Froze half the muffins.

Great recipe--my family LOVES this bread!!! I took some of the suggestions here and used only 3 cups of sugar plus used half oil/half applesauce to keep the fat under control. I didn't have nutmeg and cloves so I used a tablespoon of pumpkin pie spice and a heaping tablespoon of cinnamon. I also added raw sugar to the top before baking, it gives the bread a nice sugary crust.

Awesome.  I've made other pumpkin breads before but not like this one.  The butter adds a delicious flavor.  Didn't add the 3 cups of sugar, just 2. Was great.

Great tasting and moist recipe.  I'm not much of a baker, but I did three of these batches over the xmas season and baked them in 16 ounce mason jars (half full with batter) and gave them as presents with great compliments on the taste.

This is one of the BEST bread recipes I've EVER made! The bread is so moist and delicious and SO easy! This has become my new favorite. We made it in Mason jars and gave it out as gifts for my work at Christmas. Everyone loved it! I didn't realize it was going to make SO much, as the batter filled my whole 5qt. Kitchenaid, so make sure you have a large bowl when making or reduce the servings if you don't want too much. Really amazing recipe. Next time I'm going to add nuts or chocolate chips and make as muffins.

This is a fall tradition in our household. Always comes out perfect. Gave a loaf to my next door neighbor who said she would have shared with her sons but ate it all instead. Also given to a friend who happened to stop by after I made it- he said he had eaten almost the whole loaf on his ride home. Great recipe!!

Great basic recipe. I used half white flour and half whole wheat flour. I doubled the spices and only used about 2/3 the amount of sugar it called for (I don't understand why so many bread/muffin recipes are so laden with sugar). I mixed half of the batter with chocolate chips for the kids. The other half got dried cranberries and pecans.

Really good recipe!  I used applesauce in place of oil and it turned out really moist.  Then made another batch and used half cup applesauce and the rest oil since I didn't have any applesauce left.  Honestly, I think the one with all applesauce is more moist than the one with oil. Loved it!

Finally made this! Verdict: Good, moist and flavourful. No nuts or raisins or chocolate chips required to oomph it up. AND, this has more pumpkin and less oil/sugar (albeit still a lot of each) than most other such recipes I've seen. Thanks for sharing!

Very delicious! Made 2/3 of recipe and got 27 muffins/cupcakes which I baked at 350 for 22 minutes. Used 1/2 apple butter 1/2 canola oil, so I decreased the white sugar a bit to compensate. Tripled the cinnamon and used 2 tsp pumpkin pie spice instead of the nutmeg & cloves.  Topped with "Cream Cheese Frosting II" and some fun fall decorations. Will definitely make these again!

Very good!  I am sure the original recipe is amazing but trying to eat a little healthier here so I made some changes:  I subbed applesauce for the oil and used 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 all purpose flour.  I decreased the sugar to 1 cup (for one loaf) and doubled the cinnamon and nutmeg.  I made one loaf of bread to test out my modifications, which took about 50 minutes to bake.  It was great!

Very nice moist muffin.  I substituted unsweetened applesauce for the oil and used brown sugar instead of white reducing by a cup (3 total).  I made muffins using my large cookie scoop and cooked for about 25 mins.  I also doubled the spices.  It was still sweet but not too much

What a wonderful recipe! I just made a batch into 2 loaves and 15 muffins. Tastes delicious! I used two 15 oz. cans of pumkin because thats what I had in my pantry, I substituted unsweetened apple sauce for the oil, used 2 cups brown sugar and 2 of white suger, and 4 1/2 tsp apple pie spice rather than the separate spices (my apple pie spice has cloves, cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg). I baked the loaves for 45 min, the cupcakes for 20 min and they all came out beautifully. Thanks for a great recipe!

This receipe was so easy and delcious! I made 1 9x5 loaf and one bundt pan of it. I baked the bundt for 45 minutes and it came out perfectly. The loaf I baked for 5-10 minutes more. I used all applesauce in place of oil, reduced the sugar to 3 cups instead of 4, and used 2 3/4 whole wheat flour and the rest of the 2 cups was all purpose and added a little more of each spice. I also made a cream cheese glaze to put on the bundt. YUM :)  Next time I will use all whole wheat. I made this for a crowd this time and was afraid that it was going to come out too dense if I used all whole wheat...but I believe I was wrong!  Great go to recipe.

Followed the recipe to a T and it came out PERFECT! Very, very yummy!  I baked it in 2 large tin loaf pans, at 325 for exactly 2 hours (they are quite large loaves). They came out so moist!   Will definitely be making this again!

This is the BEST pumpkin bread recipe ever!  It does taste a lot better with fresh cooked organic pumpkin (if you have the time).  I cut the recipe in half and it still made 1 large loaf and 5 large muffins.  YUMMY!!!

I made this for the first time last winter, and it has become a family tradition!  I couldn't even count how many loaves I've made, for family and friends, and as soon as its gone, the kiddos start asking for more!  Moist, dense, flavorful, simply scrumptious! The only thing to note is, it does take a little longer to cook in my oven as well. Well, off to bake more of this goodness up:) TYTYTY Cheryl!!

This recipe was really good. I made it using a 28 oz can of pumpkin puree because I wasn't going to waste the little bit left over, and it turned out fine. I also replaced oil altogether with applesauce. It tasted great, but when adding applesauce I would say let it cook a little longer. I thought mine was done when the toothpick was clean, but it had gooey spots in the middle. Overall, a very good recipe. I will make this again.

Absolutely wonderful! I made a few changes, 1 1/4 cup oil, and 1 cup brown sugar, 2 1/2 cups white sugar. It probably could have done with even less sugar if you really wanted to save calories. I had two storebought cans of pumpkin, so it was a little more than 3 cups. This was SO good and made a ton!!

Absolutely wonderful pumpkin bread!  I followed the recipe exactly and was perfect.  The mini ch chip addition is wonderful with the pumpkin flavor.

This is my favorite "base" recipe for pumpkin bread...and I don't change a thing when I'm not worrying so much about sugar/white flour and I want reliable rave reviews. My kids LOVE these all the time (even when I sometimes fiddle, using less sugar or subbing in some whole wheat flour)! When I'm REALLY naughty, I put in as much chocolate chips as I think the batter can hold! YUM

This is truly a great bread. As another reviewer had said I did not use 3 cups of pumpkin. I used a whole 29oz. can and I saw no ill effects in doing so. I also did not have the spices but had pumpkin pie spice and it worked well. I also doubled the spices. I will absolutly be using this again. Thank you so much for posting it.

I cut the the recipe by 1/3 (scaled it to 24 servings) and used 1/2 cup of oil (instead of 1 cup)and 3 cups of pumpkin instead of 2.  I baked it 55 minutes and it was perfectly baked.  I used a silicone loaf pan and it fell right out of the pan--no sticking--I use silicone bakeware exclusively by the way.
Anyway, the pumpkin bread was very good, we all loved it.  It wasn't as sweet as I thought it would be, but that's OK, it was still delicious and I will make this over and over again.  Next time I am going to add an extra teaspoon of Cinnamon and a tsp of ginger.  I'll let you know how it comes out!

HEAVEN in a loaf pan!  This bread is absolutely, positively AMAZING!  I did sub 1/2 applesauce for the oil, added 1/2 tsp vanilla and based on personal preference for spices used: 2 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1 1/2 tsp nutmeg and 1/2 tsp cloves.  The result?  A perfectly moist, not overly sweet or spiced, OH SO YUMMY bread!  It baked up beautifully in just over an hour, and not only did we get delicious pumpkin bread after that hour, our house smelled beautifully!  I live in Australia where anything "pumpkin" (cakes, cookies, breads) is very rare and all of our friends who have tried this bread just LOVE it and ask for the recipe!  This is most definitely a keeper!

Good but I recommend not doubling the spice as it a bit overpowering.  I agree with another poster as the clove is a bit strong.  Other than this...good recipe

This was so moist and yummy! It does make A LOT of bread so I'd recommend making some mini loafs for your friends with the extras. The only change I made was using 3/4C applesauce and 3/4C oil (instead of 1.5C oil). It is great!

I gave this 4 stars because I changed a few things. I doubled the spice as some reviewers suggested. I cut the sugar by 1/2 cup and it was perfect. If I used what the recipe called for it would have been way too sweet.

 I used one whole can of pumpkin  (28 oz) which was a little more than the recipe called for and it didn't one bit!  I also used 1 cup of butter and 1/2 cup of oil. I prefer the taste of butter. I sprinkled some brown sugar on top of the loaves before cooking.

Some great additions would be walnuts or raisins.

My hubby and son loved the bread. They ate all 3 loves in two days. It's even better the next day. The loves freeze well if you don't need all of them at once. I am making them this week for a bake sale.

No need to try out any other recipes, I'll be using this one over & over.. I made one loaf, regular sized muffins, and mini muffins and each turned out great. The versatility is a big plus. I did add chopped walnuts and the flavor is fantastic.

My apartment smells great and my husband decided we're having muffins for dinner.

This came out so moist.  I too doubled the spices, did not have cloves so I just skipped it.  I had 2 cook two loaves for an hour that were in glass bakeware and one loaf I had in a metal pan took about an hour and 10 minutes.  Served it to guests on Halloween, everyone loved it.  I also subbed applesauce for the oil.  Great recipe I will be making this one every year around this time of the year!  Froze 2 of the loaves, think I may be defrosting them soon!

This recipe is so delicious!  A couple of changes I made was instead of oil I used a 6oz container of vanilla yogurt, and 3/4c of unsweetened applesauce.  I also just used a whole large can of pumpkin which was 30 oz I believe. 
Instead of 4c of sugar I used the equivalent of 1c in regular splenda (I think it was 24 packets, or you could use splenda granulated), as well as 1c of splenda brown sugar blend, and it was plenty sweet.  Instead of regular flour I used whole wheat flour.  It ended up cutting out so many calories, and I got excellent results!  This is a great recipe, so easy to make.        I think next time I will use half whole wheat half regular flour, as they did taste a tad "healthy", but still sooo good.

so delicious. I've never made pumpkin bread before and this turned out perfect. I made one large loaf and 2 dozen muffins to sell at a craft fair. They were the best seller of the day. Would definitly make again! The only changes I made in the recipe were I subtracted one egg and used an entire 28oz. can of pumpkin. yummy!

Very tasty!! Like other reviewers suggested, both sugar and oil can be cut back. I made this recipe into muffins (bake at 350 for about 18 minutes). Next time I make this, I think I'll add some chopped walnuts and some sunflower seeds. Thanks for the recipe!

I'm giving this 5 stars for the direction of the recipe because I hardly changed this and it was YUMMO! It's a perfect recipe for making gifts for neighbors and family. The batch really makes a lot.  I got two 8.5" x 5" loaf pans, and 10 very large muffins out of just one batch.  This is super-moist and easy, easy, easy.

Here is what I altered: 1)You can definitely reduce the sugar! I used 2 1/2 cups sugar and 1/2 cup packed brown sugar.  Then, I drizzled  1/8 honey into the wet mix. 2) I pureed my own pumpkin and did not use canned pumpkin. 3) I added 1 tsp each vanilla and butter flavoring. 3) I only had 3/4 cup veg. oil, so I used another 3/4 cup of applesauce.

Give this a try!

I have made this twice and it is delicious...here are my substitutions.  I used 1 cup oil and 1/2 cup of applesauce, 3 cups white sugar and 1 cup golden brown sugar, I used pumpkin spice instead of cloves.  I made 1 loaf (45-60 min), 3 small loafs (40 min), and 12 muffins-filled high (20 min).  I freeze them and pull them out when I have guests.  They taste even better after they have been frozen.  Tip for moms...my two year old did all of the measuring and I did all of the stirring, it was a great memory.

Wow.  Excellent.  I actually had to make it twice during the same weekend because they were all gone.  I did follow oter comments and chose the lower fat options and added 1/2 whole wheat flour.  I wasn't sure if  my teenagers would like these but they were a hit.  Thanks for sharing.

I found this recipe a year ago and have been making two loaves monthly since! My 2 year old loves it. I  use walnuts and sometimes flaxseeds for an extra nutritional kick. Also, I decrease the sugar and oil just a bit, and add more pumpkin to keep it moist. Nobody seems to mind! Also, I replace the flour with 1/2 c. whole wheat flour per loaf. Before we stopped using soy, I would replace 1/2 the oil with tofu. If it is blended well in a food processor, you truly cannot tell it is there. This recipe can become extremely  healthy with a little tweaking.

Best pumpkin bread I've ever had!!!
I followed others advise and substituted 1/2 the oil w/ applesauce, and 1 1/2 c. white sugar, 1 c brown sugar...also added chocolate chips and walnuts and doubled the spices.  Quick and easy to make.  It will be a regular in my home.

Wonderful!  Loved having 3 loaves.  We ate two and froze one. I use one fairly large pie pumpkin and it was perfect. Following other reviewers' suggestions I did the following: substituted applesauce for 1/2 the oil, substituted brown sugar for half the white, upped the cinnamon to 2 t and cut the cloves to 1 t.

This was very delicious moist bread but here is what I did differently.  Subbed half of the oil for no sugar added applesauce, used splenda instead of white sugar and used half white flour and half whole wheat flour.  I also used pumpkin pie spice instead of the others but next time I make it I will use the recomended spices....LOVED IT!

Wonderful bread! The only small changes I made were to add a teaspoon of vanilla, 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger, and 1 cup of chopped walnuts. I topped one loaf with cream cheese frosting for a special treat. Dang...it was amazing.

This recipe is awesome - moist and just the right blend of flavors!  However, instead of 3 regular loaves, I make 5 mini loaves (and bake for 30-35 minutes).  For gift giving, I wrap each loaf in aluminum foil and put a bow on top.  I then place it in the middle of a doily covered decorative plate and add Christmas cookies all around it.  I then place it in the middle of a large sheet of colored cellophane, draw the cellophane around the plate and tie with fancy curled ribbon.  People look forward to my "Christmas Platter" every year!  These loaves freeze very well, so I make ahead and then thaw when ready to use as gifts!

This bread was very tastey! I used 3 cups white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar. Also did not add cloves or nutmeg since we were all out and used 2 teaspoons of cinnamon.  I did add one bag of mini chocolate chips. I made two 9 by 5 loaves and one pan of mini breads (like a muffin pan but the shape of mini loaves).  I took some of the mini breads to the neighbors and the loved them and wanted the recipe. We called it Halloween bread since it had pumpkin and chocolate.  My husband did not like it because of the chocolate chips... Also we froze a loaf and this bread does not freeze well, it tastes best after sitting a day or two wrapped at room temperature, freezing seemed to dry it out a lot and I ended up throwing the defrosted loaf out.

Very tasty!  People in the dorm gobbled this up, very, very quickly.  It turned out soft and fluffy and very strongly pumpkin-flavored, not oily or wet like I was worried it might.  I added 1/3 cup mixed dark and milk chocolate (for one loaf) and that was definitely a good idea.  I think I'll add a generous 1/2 cup next time.  
Thanks for the recipe!

I made two loaves and 12 regular muffins, thinking I would have some leftover to freeze.  For our annual pumpkin party, there was a ton of food and a range of ages from newborn to grandma.  ALL of this bread was eaten and so many people told me it was delicious.  I wish I had made more to keep for myself.  Easy, yummy and a crowd favorite - definitely going to be a staple in my cookbook from now on.

Oh this is fantastic! I did make a few changes, substituted applesauce for one cup of the oil, used only 3 cups of sugar, used a whole 29 oz can of pumpkin (3 1/2 cups)and one less egg. I also added dried cranberries - WOW. I love it!

This recipe went from Maine to Florida, Ohio and out west at Christmastime, and it was a big HIT all over! My kids and I baked 6 loaves to send in the mail and all of it arrived perfectly. We added pecans and walnuts to some, and cinnamon chips to others...all scored HIGH on the taste-o-meter. Thanks for a great idea!

This was a good recipe.  I cut it down to enough for one loaf, but decided to make muffins in the end.  They turned out good, and were a hit with my family.  The only change I made, and the reason I only give it 4 stars, is that I ended up almost doubling the amount of spices that went in to get it to a flavor level that I like, based on the aroma coming from the batter.  My instincts turned out to be right, because I, and my family, thought the spice level I chose was just right.  But I would guess that if you don't like strong flavors, the amount called for in the original recipe is probably perfect.

This cake is amazingly moist and airy light. While baking this, my small apartment was filled with a great holiday scent. I whipped eggs seperetely before mixing all together, which made this cake even lighter.

This was very good. However, I suggest making the bread in mini loaf pans so that it is easier to eat and it just comes out moister. I did four small loaves and one big loaf, and the big loaf was dry and too big of slices for most people. The mini loaves came out moist and just the right size sliced for people to eat. I did as others suggested and substituted half butter and half oil for all the oil.

This is a keeper!  I substituted 4 1/2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice for spices, used 3/4c applesauce and 3/4c oil, and the whole 29 oz can pumpkin as other users recommended.  I also used dried crans instead of raisins- It made 24 muffins and 3 small loaves.  I also preferred 2c white & 11/2 brown sugar- so it wasn't toooooo sweet.

What a nice recipe! The house smelled heavenly and the bread turned out wonderfully! I might experiment here and there the next time but I can't complain at all. I am taking two loaves in to the Radiology Department in the morning and I am making this again tomorrow afternoon to give to neighbors! Thank you and Enjoy!

This was the best pumpkin bread I have evermade, I have been making pumpkin bread for a lot of years. The only changes I made was to cut the sugar in half and I used 1 cup, cooking oil and 12 cup butter, I also used walnuts in one loaf and mini chips in the other, it was super moist and tasty...Thanks for submitting this recipe :)

Great recipe!!  The bread smells great while baking,  and tastes delicious.  I made it with the mini chocolate chips (to entice my three year old who otherwise probably wouldn't have touched it), and both my kids loved it.  I thought the bread was sweet enough on its own, and would probably have preferred it without the chocolate.  Even so, I thought it was very good.  Next time, and there will be a next time, I'll do one loaf each way!  Thanks for sharing!

Rather disappointed with this recipe after all the rave reviews.  Maybe it was all the hype, but the pumpkin bread was just plain average.  It was perhaps on the sweet side, although the combination of spices was alluring the overall bread wasn't anything to write home about.

I made this recipe over the holidays and added mini chocolate chips, people went crazy for it. I had so many requests to bring a loaf to the office and holiday partys. I altered the recipe slightly and made three loafs instead of two and they seemed to be a more suitable size for giving out to friends and family.

Followed this recipe as is, just reduced to 24 servings instead of 36 and made muffins instead of bread. Absolutely delicious!!! Next time, I will add mini chocolate chips, but they are wonderful without themas well.

Absolutely perfect!! Lightly crispy top with a wonderfully flavored soft inside :)

It's a week later, I've made this several times now each batch a little different from the last. 
1 - the first batch was exactly as the recipe recommends. Perfection!
2 - the second I made with sweetened applesauce instead of oil,  reduced the sugar, and used pumpkin pie spice instead on the other spices. tasted like a lovely harvest bread with the pumpkin and apple!
3 - this last batch I ran out of sugar so it was half white sugar half Splenda type sugar, again with pumpkin pie spice. Still so very good!

Delicious!  I've been making this recipe for years now.  I use a Kitchen Aid mixer and put everything in the bowl at once and beat until smooth.  I also put raisins in and boil them about 5 minutes before putting them into the batter.  This way they do not go to the bottom of the pan. My family likes pecan nuts best of all, so that is what I use. I give at least 15-20 loafs out every year as Christmas gifts.  My family and friends look forward to getting one as they say it's the best pumpkin bread that they have ever had.  Also, it's a good gift for the mailman, paper man etc.

If I could give this recipe 10 stars, I would!  We added semi-sweet chocolate chips (YUM!!!!!). I only had one bread pan so I improvised: used the bread pan and spread the rest in a 9"x13" pan.  That baked quicker than the bread pan and I cut what was in the 9"x13" into 3 loaves once it cooled.  Kept one loaf out to eat and froze the rest.  I have been pulling one loaf out of the freezer daily since we can't get enough of it!  Defrosts easily and doesn't change the taste!

Best recipe ever, sometimes I use more pumpkin and less sugar, but this recipe never disappoints.  Can't wait to make it again this fall.

Yum!! This is so good! I've never liked pumpkin before until this week-I've been obsessed. This bread has a very light and smooth texture. It's not dense or heavy tasting like most breads. I wire wisked all my dry ingredients together - I'm not sure if that had anything to do with it but I know when I sift my dry ingredients using a fine mesh strainer (when I bake cakes) it makes the texture light as air. This bread is very moist. The top center of mine was still a little raw when I took it out of the oven. I put it back in for 5 more min and it still wasn't completely cooked. I couldn't wait any longer so I just ate it like that. It tastes like soft pumpkin bread with pumpkin pie in the middle. Next time I make this I'll add pure vanilla xtract but it's perfect the way it is.

Made this once and I will absolutely make it again!!  CHANGES: 1. I only had 2x 9x5 pans and 1x 8.5" (STILL WORKED JUST FINE, but I had to cook for an additional 10 minutes. 2. I added 3 cups of mini semi-sweet morsels. Next time I plan on adding more of the spices; probably 2 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 2 tsp nutmeg and 2tsp cloves. Delicious recipe! Thanks!!

I loved this bread although I did make some changes. I scaled it down to only 1 9x5 loaf and I used a stick of melted butter instead of oil. Used 1 1/4 cup of sugar and 3/4 tsp cinnamon 3/4 tsp nutmeg a scant 1/2 tsp cloves and a scant 1/4 tsp ginger. It's delicious. Next time a may use a mixture of brown and white sugars (the outside was a little crisp from the white sugar I think) and might substitute half the butter out for extra pumpkin (or yogurt). Very versatile recipe!

I made and had pumpkin bread for the first time with this recipe and it became a Fall tradition in my home. My first time, I took a loaf to my previous office and I still get requests for it whenever I stop by. Perfect moisture and you can tast the pumpkin but not over baring (like another poster, I too used the whole 28 oz can) I also like to add walnut bits. They make good cupcakes too!

The consistency was different. I thought maybe it was because of all the eggs. I took the advise of several other raters and replaced the oil for apple sauce and didn't use as much sugar. Every thing else was the same. It was moist but bland.

I made this recipe with a few simple changes. I added a half cup of chopped dates, substituted Spenda for sugar, used half whole wheat flour instead of all white, and as others mentioned, was generous with the spices. I also grated in about 1 1/2 TSP of fresh ginger. The loaves turned out wonderfully moist and fragrant. This recipe is a real keeper. I think it would be great with chopped peacans too.

No changes needed, very good and moist. This is actually the exact recipe the restaurant Bob Evans uses for their pumpkin bread. Made the first batch and it was so good I went to the store and got enough to make for Christmas gifts. Delicious!!!!

This recipe was the first recipe I ever followed for Pumpkin bread and it turned out amazing and very moist! The flavor profile was out of this world, pumpkinish, and full of spice and flavor, a perfect balance for sure! I followed the recipe exactly except I cut the serverings down to 1/3 and my bread pan was slighly smaller than what the recipe called for. Nonetheless It came out great. This is the first Pumpkin bread I have ever made or eaten so the other recipes out there might be just as good, I guess someday I will have to make them and find out!

Absolutely perfect every time. I make two loaves and a dozen muffins. The whole family scarfs the muffins down the first day. Such a simple recipe. Would not change a thing! I don't usually measure the canned pumpkin either, just use one large can...

This is the 2nd time I've made it.  The first time I followed it exactly, this time I made several changes. I used applesauce instead of the oil, used 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar. I also used 2 cups white flour and 2 3/4 cup of ground oatmeal. I also used less cloves and added 2 tsp vanilla. It was delicious and healthier!

I really love this recipe, I have made it twice.  The first time I used regular flour, the second time I used whole wheat and made muffins instead of loaves.  Both times turned out beautifully.  I will likely continue to use whole wheat flour.

I just had to comment on this luscious recipe! It's quick to put together, and you are rewarded with "3" plum, delicious loaves! I made the recipe "as is", adding some chopped walnuts and raisins stirred into the batter at the end before filling the pans. My bake time was longer as well - 65-75 minutes, depending on the amount of batter in the pans.....the results, however, were superb! Just what I wanted....fragrant, not-too-sweet, wonderfully moist pumpkin bread!  I kept (1) loaf and gave two away as gifts.....the recipients were very happy!  I may try using one part white whole wheat flour in place of the AP white flour, and, as others have suggested, applesauce, to replace some or all of the oil. I hope it turns out as well with those changes. Overall, a WONDERFUL recipe!  PS...while it's baking, take a few minutes to wash the bowl, etc....when the bread is done, so are you! Just put on the coffee, cut a fat slice, and enjoy!

Used applesauce instead of oil. Used paper liners with the first batch and they come out better without out them. Just spray the tin with Pam. Only used about 60% of the sugar and they were sweet enough (added semi-sweet chocolate chips). Will try plain and with raisins next time.

This was fantastic.  Moist and excellent combination of spices.  The kids couldn't wait while it was cooking and it's a big hit.

Thank you for the recipe.  I plan on making this a lot during Fall!

This is a great recipe.  I made it as written.... delicious, but not very healthy. But no one knew that my new version was good for you.  The pumpkin and spices are what makes it so good (and the chocolate chips of course).
I substituted white, whole wheat flour for the all purpose flour.  You can always use a combination of the two to equal the 4 3/4 cups.  There is way too much sugar...it's not necessary. I used 1 1/3 cups each of white and dark brown sugar (I might try all brown sugar next time). I used 2 whole eggs and 7 egg whites (again, you can change the combination). I also substituted 1 1/4 cup of unsweetened applesauce plus 1/4 cup oil. And of course, I added a handful of mini chocolate chips.  Delicious!

I've made this many times. Awesome recipe! Even my kids love it! Been asked for the recipe by several friends. I use unsweetened applesauce in place of the oil and add a little extra of the spices. Perfect for the fall/winter holidays!!

Throw out your other recipes for pumpkin bread.  This is fabulous!  I have been baking over 50 years and this one is a keeper. It has a nice firm yet light texture and excellent flavor.  Nice and pumpkiny.  It tastes even better the next day.  I had a slice with cream cheese for breakfast and I kept thinking, "This is so yummy!"   I cut the recipe in half and it yielded 2 good size loaves.  I added raisins and used half oil and half applesauce to reduce the fat.

I tried this recipe, and got great reviews. I substituted oil or unsweet applesauce, and used whole wheat flour. It tasted delicious, and I felt better about it being a little "healthier." I think adding raising or pecans next time would really spice it up. I also added more of the spices for added flavor and it was great.

Made this recipe but only used 1 cup oil & replaced remainder with 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce. Took recommendation from another baker that only used 1 1/2 cups white sugar & 1 1/2 cups brown sugar. Increased spices to 2 tsp for cinnamon, nutmeg & cloves....turned out delicious & much lighter than normal dense pumpkin bread. My girls loved it!!! The recipe made 8 mini loaves cooked for 30 minutes & 2 large loaves cooked for 55 minutes.

I love the ease of this delightful pumpkin bread.  I replace the individual spices with 4 1/2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice.  It is a hit no matter where I take it.  I love that it makes 3 loaves - 2 to take to holiday gatherings and 1 to leave at home.

Very good,moist bread.  Very pretty loaves and perfect for when you need to make several at once.  I cut back on the sugar and oil a bit and it still turned out fantastic.

This recipe is really...REALLY good! I used fresh puréed roasted pumpkin instead of canned (WAY better!), half white and half whole wheat flour. Also, I used only 1/2 cup oil and 1 cup unsweetened apple sauce. I thought that 4 cups was a lot, so I only used 2 cups white sugar, and 3/4 cup brown and it was perfectly sweet. I made one large loaf, two small loves with walnuts on top, and then mixed in dark chocolate chips and chopped walnuts and made blondies and everyone raved. This recipe is a keeper...with my modifications it was lower fat and calories (I am on weight watchers...with my subs it is 4 points per serving)

I've been making this recipe (with all organic ingredients) for years now with a few changes. I use one 15 ounce can of pumpkin (of course, fresh pumpkin is always best when available!) and then halve all of the other ingredients for two nice loaves. I use whole wheat flour, instead of all-purpose, and add walnuts and rasins. This is a "good for you" nutrition-packed snack/meal. Quick and easy to make. I love to eat it with a little sour cream!

Changed the recipe to 24 count since I had never made anything like this and didn't want to make a lot just for my family. I filled up my loaf pan, and used the rest of the dough (after adding chocolate chips) to make muffins. They were fabulous! My extremely picky teen had four before I could stop him! I even used splenda brand sugar and brown sugar so I could have some too and nobody could tell the difference! Great recipe! I can't wait to make it again, especially around the holidays!

It is great. I used half wheat/ half white, only a cup of sugar( honey), 4 eggs and a flax seed egg, 1 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesause.  Sometimes I add three bananas and 2 cups pumpkin.

My 16 month old daughter loves this bread.  As others have said, the large batch is great to make loaves, mini muffins, etc and freeze them.  I also swapped out some of the oil, white flour and sugar with apple sauce, whole wheat flour and honey to try to add some additional nutrition.

The only thing I changed was put in appleasauce instead of the oil. It was the best! I have also made this several times using chocolate chips in the recipe. I think it tastes much better without.

I had half a baked acorn squash that I wanted to use up so I reduced this recipe by a third and replaced the canned pumpkin with the squash (pureed in the food processor). It was very good!

Perfect!  Only change was I used Pumpkin Pie Spice instead of Cinnamon & Nutmeg, but otherwise I followed and cut to one loaf and it was gone in 2 sittings (just me and my husband)  Now I know I need to make multiple loafs at a time - Thank you for posting this recipe, I will make often!

It is springy, moist and has a nice tender texture. I added 100 gram more pumpkin because the can of pumpkin I used is a 30 oz / 850 g can so I just threw it in. The canned pumpkin was sweeten so I used 600 gram of sugar instead of 800gram. It was still sweet, so I can't imagine using the full amount.

I changed things around for my personal taste. I followed the directions for only 12 servings/1 loaf. I only used 1/2 cup of sugar and I doubled the cinnamon and did a heaping scoop of nutmeg. I did not have any ground cloves on hand, but I didn't notice a difference! Very yummy! Nice to have in the freezer!

I just made this and it is DELICIOUS!  I did make a few changes (I know, I know - everybody hates it when people do that, but I couldn't help it!)  First, I was running low on oil, and I had a 29 oz can of pumpkin, so I used the whole can (3.5 cups) plus 1/2 cup applesauce, and 1/2 cup oil.  I don't think this hurt the recipe one bit, as it's still moist and yummy.  I was also running low on sugar, so I used 2 cups white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar.  Finally, I did increase the amount of spices used, but that's personal preference.
This recipe makes a LOT of batter.  A LOT!  I made 12 muffins, a 9x5 loaf pan, and another smaller (8x4?) loaf pan.  For half the muffins and the smaller loaf pan, I added "Cheese Filling" from Pokey-Turtle.  Historically, I have issues with cakes and muffins never rising for me - they always turn out flat and ugly.  I don't know if I overmix or what.  But these turned out BEAUTIFUL!  The tops were nice and round.  I was so proud to pull them out of the oven!  I baked the muffins for 30 minutes and the two loaf pans for one hour.
I thought the cheese filling was the perfect touch - like a pumpkin roll without the hassle.  
I will definitely be making this bread again!

This was wonderful.  Makes a big batch, so was relieved that they were tasty.  Made half with chocolate chips.  I liked with chocolate chips and my kids liked without (such a surprising twist!).  Even better the next day.  Made recipe exactly as specified too.

I cut the recipe down to 24 servings and it made one loaf and about 12 cupcakes. Fresh out of the oven, this is the best, most moist pumpkin bread ever. I didn't add any nuts or raisins or anything. After a couple of days it gets a little dry and less appealing (both in and out of the fridge).

great recipe either way though :D

First review .. long time user... I have used this recipe 5-6 times and I must say this is one of the best bread recipes on here.. super moist and freezes well! I make muffins and this recipe has not failed me once. I add in pecans and maraschino cherries to mix it up once in a while

This is a great pumpkin bread. I use this recipe for muffins and is great too. I like to add allspice to mine make the muffins/bread have a little more spice to them. I love making the muffins and the recipes is super easy to follow.

Made this bread but substituted 5 t. pumpkin pie spice for nutmeg and cloves as I was out of cloves.  I kept the cinnamon the same.  It turned out great!  I made 2 loaves of bread and 12 muffins from this recipe.  This recipe is a keeper.

I basically cut the recipe into a 1/3rd. The problem with this recipe is that it doesn't specify the size of the cans. I found a 29 ounce can of pumpkin puree and realized later it's actually 15 ounce can by going to another recipe after the fact! Even though the instructions weren't clear... and I put too much pumpkin puree, it still tasted pretty good. I'm going to attempt this again and hopefully it will come out better.

This is my favorite pumpkin bread recipe.  It's moist and dense, which is what I look for!  I do scale back the sugar, but otherwise leave the recipe as is.

I made muffins from this recipe. They were so moist and yummy. My husband thought they were amazing. This is a keeper. I baked tons, since it makes 3 loafs. They took 18 to 20 mins to bake.

First time making pumpkin bread...I needed a much bigger bowl than I thought I would. It came out delicious though! I made muffins, and two loafs. The little girl I tutor loved loved the muffins and scarfed down two, she normally takes ten minutes just to eat a mini sized candy bar, so that surprised me. I didn't put at much sugar...because it seemed a bit too much and used a little more pumpkin puree than called for and added vanilla extract. Delicious. :D

I cooked and pureed a small pumpkin and it yielded around 4 cups puree, which I used for this recipe. I also substituted 2 cups flour for whole wheat flour, and the bread was still moist and very tasty. Also increased cinnamon to 2 tsp and decreased cloves to 1 tsp.

This is a wonderful moist recipe! I have made it a couple times and have gotten rave reviews.  The first time I froze a loaf and I think it was better!  Very versitile, I have added chocolate chips, and I also tried some walnuts ground with brown sugar and cinnamon sprinkled on before baking. They were all very good variations.  I will make many more times I am sure!

A friend had given us a pumpkin so I decided to make this.  I ended up with enough pumpkin puree to make 9 loaves, figuring I would freeze some.  Not a single loaf made it to the freezer! This bread is absolutely fabulous and everyone who tried it raved about it. Thanks for sharing!

5 stars!  I altered the recipe somewhat, and it came out great!  Used 28 oz can of pumpkin; reduced the oil to 1 cup; reduced the sugar to 3.5 cups (but added 1 cup of raisins plumped in warm cranberry juice at the end for sweetness); replaced 1 cup of the flour with whole wheat flour; and added 1 cup of toasted chopped walnuts at the end with the raisins.  Came out great!  A huge Thanksgiving hit!

First time making a quick bread of any kind and came out good but need to tweak a bit.  I'm going to take advice of others and sub some oil with sugar free applesauce.  And also some oil with more pumpkin.   Also going to try some other suggestions and cut sugar down a cup, then 1/2 amount of sugar with white sugar and other half with brown sugar.  Also going to double spices, and add nuts.  We will see how that turns out.

Wonderful moist and dense bread.  I did as others suggested using half oil and half unsweetened applesauce.  It made 6 mini loaves and one regular size loaf.  I sprinkled a sugar and cinnamon mixture on the bottom and top.  It made for a sweet crunchy topping and I do this with a lot of my quick breads.  Will definitely make again.

Wow, this is really good pumpkin bread. I lost the recipe I've used for over 30 years and I'm so happy I found this one. Mine didn't raise enough, but my b. soda and/or b. powder may not be fresh. I just bought them, but sometimes I've found it isn't fresh from the store. I'll buy new and try this recipe again. If it still doesn't raise enough, I'll add 2 teas. of each. :)

Excellent recipe! I wish they had more stars to add to this recipe.  I added 1/4 teaspoon more of the cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves because I love those flavors.  It was a great decision and very well received as it really added a POP to the warm and savory taste.  It was a great texture. I sliced it fairly thick and served it warm with a little pat of butter.

The best pumpkin bread recipe I've tried and I've tried quite a few so far this year!  I prepared almost as written, but cut the oil in half and subbed apple sauce for the other half.  I also used half white flour and half wheat and doubled all spices but the nutmeg, and threw in a bit of ground ginger for good measure.  YUM.  Keeper for sure!!

Holy cow this is delicious!  I substituted all of the oil for no sugar added apple sauce and it turned out magnificent!  I recently moved to a high altitude (7,300 feet) and this is the first bread I've been able to make that came out without a hitch.  Definitely suggest making a melted butter  cinnamon/sugar mixture to pour over top once it comes out.  It give the crust sooo much flavor.  DELICIOUS!

Use applesauce instead of oil. Reduce sugar or sub 1/4 c maple syrup. Great with dried cranberries and pumpkin seeds.

This is a delicious and easy recipe. I broke it down to 24 servings (2 loaves) and substituted half of the oil with half applesauce and it was very moist. I think it actually enhanced the flavor. I also added 2/3 cup dried cranberries, which made it even better. I took it to my staff meeting, and everyone gobbled it up. The good thing about breaking it down to 2 loaves is that it is perfect for one small can of pumpkin without any waste. Great recipe, will definitely do again with the cranberries.

fantastic!  

I used 1 c. Whole wheat flour, and the rest unbleached white.  I also used 3/4 c. Applesauce + 3/4 c. Oil.  
Also, added 3/4 c. Spiced nuts (chopped) to the loaves.  

The best recipe I've tried..moist and flavorful!

Loved this recipe! Quick and easy. I adapted it for a gluten-free/dairy-free diet and you would never know the difference! So delicious!!! I also used a cup of applesauce and 1/2 cup oil as others suggested. My gluten free flour tends to have my baked goods end up dry and dense but this was super moist and fluffy! Thanks for the great recipe! Nice to have something that tastes "normal" again!

The only thing I changed was that I subbed applesauce for half the oil called for; healthier, yet still so delicious. I added large chocolate chips to half the batter. I think loaves of this yummy bread would make great gifts.

oh yay -- pumpkin joy! i halved the recipe and got 2 mini loaves and 2 muffins, the latter baked in ramekins. subbed in 1/2 of the sugar requirement with brown sugar, and since i didn't have ground cloves, split the difference between the nutmeg and cinnamon. also, used melted butter instead of oil. a total hit! thanks!

Oh so yummy! Changed this a tad. I used homemade pumpkin puree, so I decreased the liquids- 1 cup of melted butter instead of oil, and 4 eggs instead of 6. Plus, I used 2 cups of white sugar and 1 cup of brown sugar, and just under 2 TBSP of pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves. Made muffins, my boys love them, even the one who hates pumpkin anything! Will be making again. And again!

I liked that this recipe is versatile and that it makes more than one loaf. However, I put in chocolate chips as suggested and it became chocolate chip bread. It just made it too sweet and overpowered the pumpkin. It didn't taste like pumpkin bread at all. I think if I made this again, I would leave out the chocolate chips.

Love this recipe! I haven't made it exactly following recipe but only because I wanted it a little lower calorie/ sugar for my kids. I use applesauce in place of the oil and only 2 cups of sugar. Nobody seems to notice and my girls looove this pumpkin bread! I'm sure it is delish with the oil and full amount of sugar.

I made this with roasted pumkin and it was delicious. Thanks for a great recipe!  I changed the spices only because I also made a pumpkin pie on the same day and wanted some variety. So I used cinnamon, cardamon, ginger, allspice and some black pepper!

This is delicious.  I just cut it down to a 2-loaf recipe.  Also had to let it cook for about an hour.  I didn't have any apple sauce, so had to use the oil, but will substitute it next time for sure!  Great recipe, tastes like pumpkin pie!  They were gone in a second at home and work!

Excellent.  Great spices.  Nice and moist.  Perfectly pumpkin-y.  I even followed one of the comment versions and substituted applesauce for oil.  My only issue is that now the muffins stick to the paper wrappers--so maybe get foil ones or just grease muffin cups!

This was good, but not amazing.  Someone mentioned it needs some contrasting texture, and I think I agree ... might try it again with nuts, or even some kind of cinnamon streusal topping.  I did use 1 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup oil, and it was very moist.

This is a pretty foolproof recipe for a delicious pumpkin bread.  Extremely easy to follow and to make, and how do I love that there are two extra loaves waiting for me in my freezer?  I may make another batch next weekend!

Very good recipe.  I removed one cup of the sugar, it was fine without it.  That just is too much sugar.

Mmmmm, I took the advice of another user and doubled the amount of cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg used, as well as using half oil/half unsweetened applesauce. I always fold in chocolate chips in pumpkin bread.

This recipe was GREAT.  I actually used a pie pumpkin, cooked it in the microwave for 9min before pureeing since I was out of canned pumpkin.  Fabulously moist and TASTY result.  Would've been great with canned pumpkin, as well!

This was excellent and very easy. I followed the suggestion of others by doubling the spices and adding nuts. We loved it the first night, can hardly wait to taste it the second day.

I took this recipe, substituted some ingredients to make it healthier and gluten-free and it turned out great!  My kids love it!

Instead of the oil, I use the same amount of apple sauce (I love "PC Just Apples").  Instead of sugar, I use 2 cups of Agave.  Instead of flour, I use the same amount of "Bob Mill's Gluten-free Flour".  Then you need to add about 2 tsp. of Guar Gum to bind the flour.

It turns out moist and yummy every time!  And there's little guilt in eating it!!

Wonderful Bread!  Nice and moist.  I think I may add a little more cloves next time, but this is a nice taste.  I did cut down the recipe to 2 loaves and it worked out well.

I've made this several times to rave reviews. I make these into mini muffins (12 doz) and freeze some of them for the kids to have as snacks in their lunches.  My changes: reduce sugar to 3 cups, Replace 1 c oil with 1 c unsweetened applesauce, Increase to 2t cinnamon, reduce to 1t nutmeg, add 1t pumpkin pie spice.  Sometimes I add pecans or mini chocolate chips too.

My first try at pumpkin bread.  I substituted 1/2 cup butter for part of the oil and added 2 bananas. I only had one 15 ounce can of pumpkin but I had a 9 ounce jar of Pumpkin butter so I used that to bring it up to 3 cups.  Had to bake it a little longer and I might cut that back a tad to about 65 minutes.  It is very tasty. I think it would be good warm with vanilla ice cream or with a lemon curd sauce.  I will be baking this one again.

Very Yummy!  I used 2 whole cans of pumpkin puree.  I also subbed in 1 cup of unsweetened applesauce and only about a 1/2 cup of vegetable oil.  I made them into muffins and it made almost 4 dozen.  They were very moist and flavorful, especially the next day.  I also did not have any cloves, so I omitted them and added about 1/2 tsp. ground ginger.  These were exactly what I was looking for in a pumpkin muffin/bread recipe.

I want to give it 5 stars so badly, but no matter how delicious I thought it was, there was a major caveat.  This bread lacked pumpkin flavor.  I followed the recipe exactly, except for adding 1 Tbs vanilla extract, which didn't even come through that much.  If I were to make it again (and I will), I might try subbing a little extra pumpkin in for some other ingredients.

I did really like this recipe. It was simple and very easy to put together. I had a whole pie pumpkin cooked, I guesstimated it to be around 3.5 cups of pumpkin pureed, and used it all. Sub 1/2 of the oil with baby food pears, and baked in 10 mini loaf pans. Everyone liked it and it was even better two days later as leftovers. Thanks for sharing

this was AWESOME. made it this morning, it's 10pm right now, and i'm pretty sure it's all gone alreayd.... pureed my own butternut squash, added about 1tsp more cinnamon, no cloves. this made 2 loaves (1 with walnuts, 1 without) and a whole bunch of mini-muffins.  the muffins took about 15 minutes, and loaves took about 45 minutes.

Very easy recipe, came out beautifully tender and moist.  I made mine like a cake (slightly shallower) and monitored the cooking time closely.  Next time I think I will add a little frosting (1/2 c butter, vanilla and confectioner's sugar) and frost it while it's still warm so the frosting melds with the cake.  I will definitely make this many, many times.

Scaled it down - I only had three eggs on hand. It was amazing! Only thing - not sure if it's my oven or not, but temp seemed too high. Outsides were crispy and inside was gooey. Next time I'll lower the temp and see what happens.

I've found my go-to recipe for pumpkin bread.  This was more moist and flavorful that the Downeast Maine pumpkin bread on this site.  A crumb topping made this great bread even better.

I have made this bread at least 20 times over the past couple of years and it is always a hit! I use mini loaf pans and I decrease the oven temperature to 325 and bake a bit longer to reduce the chance of a crunchy top on my bread. I have made batches with Pecans, a great addition if you like nuts. Enjoy!

Fantastic recipe! I scaled it down to 12 servings (makes one 9x5 loaf), used 1/4 each unsweetened applesauce and oil, used 1 cup sugar, added 1 tsp vanilla (probably doesn't really make a difference) and it was out of the oven in 50 minutes. I whipped up a little batch of cream cheese frosting to go with the loaf. I'm excited to taste it tomorrow when the flavor of the spices have really come through. Thanks for the great recipe -  will definitely make again!!

I've made this several times.  Such an easy recipe to make!  I do use the foil pans for this recipe though.  They are smaller in size than regular loaf pans, therefore, this recipe will yield four pans of bread which means, depending on your oven, the bake time will be a little longer.  I also use applesauce instead of oil.  This makes the bread quite moist even after being in the fridge for a day or two.  Excellent recipe!

This bread was delicious.  The author is right, you will be glad you made so much of it!  I substituted half whole wheat flour and 2 cups of agave nectar instead of the sugar.  It was plenty sweet and delicious!

as good as any pumpkin bread I've made but not spectacular.  Used 2 small cans (15oz?) pumpkin and used applesauce in place of oil.  Added a little extra cinnamon and I'd use less clove next time...too strong in my opinion.   Had to bake a bit longer than called for.

This bread was so moist and it has just the right amount of spices. My son loves taking it to school for snack time.

LOVE this recipe!  I tweaked it a little... since I don't like the ends of a loaf, I used the equivalent of 24 servings and used a bundt pan. I added 1 cup toasted walnuts and 1 cup whole frozen cranberries.  325 for about 2 hours.  YUM!!!! Thanks for a great base recipe :)

i baked this recipe for my family on Thanksgiving. it came out wonderfully and was very easy! my family is very health conscious so i used a little less sugar and oil than the recipe called for and it was still delicious. my mom and grandma have both asked me to bake it again for Christmas. to make it even more like a decadent dessert, i would make a glaze and drizzle it over the loaf. definitely something the whole family will enjoy!

this was so delicious! and so easy to make! i actually made the recipe for 12 bc i couldnt fathom needing 3 pans of bread, so wrong! i wish i had more pans to share bc no one is getting any of my loaf. i made some swaps just due to what i had on hand: used dark brown sugar instead, used butter instead of oil, used allspice instead of nutmeg, and threw in about half a cup of raisins. i dont know if i'll ever try this recipe to the T since the changes i happened to make this time resulted in such an amazing loaf.

I thought this recipe for pumpkin bread turned out excellent. I only used 1 cup oil and a half cup of applesauce. Also, I used only 3 1/2 cups sugar. It was so popular, I had to make another batch!

I want to thank all of you who have taken this recipe and made it their own. I too make adjustments.  I continue to make all size breads and muffins as gifts wrapped and tied with fall ribbon, as well as for my boys who are now men and still cannot wait  for Oct. and Nov. when I make this bread for the fall. (sometimes Dec. I am a seasonal baker.)  What I do for gifts is to take my batter divide it,  put mini chips in one part,  hold my loaf pan kind of holding it on a tilt, put half choc.chip batter one one side and then fill the other side with plain batter smooth the two together and top with roughly chopped toasted walnuts.  This way I can give a choice when cut from both sides. I did post a photo finally.  Not a cut look though.  I will take another photo to show how that looks this week and post another photo. I just wanted to take the time and let  you all know that I appreciate your kind words. Thanks Cheryl

This bread was fantastic.  I followed the instructions and measurements to the letter and 3 perfect loaves of pumpkin bread were created.  My family loves this recipe and it's so easy.  I'm off to the market for more cans of pumpkin.

This recipe is AWESOME!!! Just a few simple tweaks and they are super healthy and yummy! I use fresh pumpkin puree and fresh apple sauce in place of the oil. I also use half whole wheat flour, only 2 1/2 cups organic sugar, a full 2 tsp of cinnamon, 1 tsp ground ginger, and 4 tbsp ground flaxseed.  My kids beg for these in their lunchboxes!!! Thanks!

I have tried this and the other highly rated pumpkin bread recipe and much prefer this one.  It's easy to make and is absolutely delicious.  I have made it for several friends and family members who raved about it.  It's perfect as-is ~ no modifications are necessary.  I am making some now to take into my son's school tomorrow!

Sinfully amazing.  I make these into muffins and this recipe makes three dozen.  Just use the whole can of pumpkin as it's just over 3 cups.  I've been toying with ways to make it healthier, but after ruining the recipe once with too many substitutions, currently my only change is to use 1 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup oil instead of 1-1/2 cups oil and 1-3/4 cups whole wheat flour in place of the same amount white flour.  Honestly it is perfect with no changes, I am just doing what I can to make it slightly less sinful!

I used real pumpkin and cut the sugar in 1/2.  I also used 1/2 the oil and subbed apple sauce. I also used 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 white. This is AMAZING!  As a final touch, I sprinkeled sugar over the top and it made a glaze as it baked.  YUM!

This is an awesome recipe.  I made some substitutions to cut back on the fat/calories.  Instead of the 1 1/2 cups of oil, I used 3/4 cup oil and 3/4 cup of regular applesauce.  Instead of the 4 cups of sugar, I used 3 c. sugar and 1/2 c. of sugar/splenda blend.   The bread was very moist, just the right level of sweetness and the flavor of the spices creates the perfect pumpkin bread.  I will be making this for years to come.  I also like the idea that it makes 3 loaves.  No one would ever know that I made the substitutions.

The only reason I'm giving this 4 stars is because I modified it slightly. I used a full 29 oz. can of pumpkin so I didn't have to measure it. I replaced the oil with unsweetened applesauce (great idea!) I split the sugar half white and half light brown. Used 2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour and 2 cups whole wheat flour. (I have a 2 year old.) Omitted the spices and replaced with 5 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice and 1 teaspoon cinnamon. Also added 1 teaspoon vanilla. I made muffins and it yielded 48+ (I ran out of muffin cups after that so I had to toss the remaining batter.) Sprinkled the batter with decorator's sugar before baking to give it a sweet crunch. Bake for 15-20 minutes depending on your oven at 325. So delicious!!!

This was excellent... I only made 1/3 of the recipe.  I used 1/4 cup oil and 1/4 applesauce, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Bake time was around 80 - 90 minutes.

Only change was replacing the 1 1/2 cups of oil with 1 1/2 cups of pure applesauce.  The four year old LOVED them as did hubby and I.  Great recipe.  I made 29 cupcakes and one loaf from this recipe.  I used my new silicone pumpkin muffin pan for 12 of the cupcakes.

This is a perfect pumpkin bread. I couldn't bring myself to use so much oil, so I subbed in 1C unsweetened applesauce (with 1/2C canola oil). I'll probably work my way to using only a tiny bit of oil. Other than that, it makes a huge quantity of bread, which I love during the holiday season. It's simple, uses ingredients I usually have on-hand, and smells amazing. I also used the entire 28oz can of pumpkin, rather than measuring out 3C, and it came out perfect.

Very good recipe. Too much oil for my family so I added 4oz cup of cinnamon applesauce and 1/4 cup of oil. I also used 2 1/4 pumpkin pie spice to cut down on supplies. We love cinnamon so I added more to taste. 1/2 batch made 36 muffins 350 for 21 min frosted in homemade cream cheese icing....Wonderful!!!

I have to say, I think this bread is just ok. I made it exactly as called for except I didn't add any raisins, chocolate chips, or nut. I think these might of made it better. It was however a nice, moist loaf which I like, just a little plain.

Fabulous!  I used a 50/50 ratio of applesauce to oil and only half of the sugar called for.  I baked at 350 for 1 hr and 20 min, and it came out perfect.  This bread is so moist and so easy to make.  Will definitely make again!

This recipe made some very tasty pumpkin bread.  I only made two thirds of what the recipe called for and only made two loaves.  I made a couple of changes: (1) I wound up using more pumpkin than the recipe called for - this may have made the bread slightly more moist than I anticipated. As a result, my bread was not 100% cooked through after one hour.  It was close though.  (2) I added a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice and slightly reduced the amount of cloves called for. (3) Instead of oil, I used half oil, half unsweetened applesauce.  This resulted in a delicious bread with a strong pumpkin flavor.  Thanks for the recipe!

Perfect, absolutely perfect. Changed one thing though: Due to the sheer volume of reviews that called for extra cooking time I lowered the temp to 325 and baked for about an hour and a half, the loaves came out perfect! Moist and cinnamon'y. Finally!! A pumpkin bread that isn't dry and bland tasting!!

Loved this bread!  I always was on the lookout for a great Pumpkin Bread recipe and this is it.  To cut down on fat, I did equal parts vegetable oil and applesauce to make up the amount called for in the recipe.

We just moved to Nepal (4,000 ft above sea level) and I decided to use this as my first trial baking recipe. I was tempted to up the flour as most high altitude recipes suggest, but decided to just try the recipe as is. In short, it came out great! I was waiting for the bread to sink and turn into a hard lump of bread, but no such thing. It rose up (and stayed up) beautifully. It wasn't overly moist, I will definitely keep this in my collection. Thanks!

I followed the instructions of another reviewer and did 1/2 the recipe and made 4 mini-loaves.  I tried one with rum-soaked raisins, one with walnuts, one with mini choco-chips, and the last one plain.  I did substitute half the oil with applesauce and hardly found a deficit in taste and texture.  The walnuts were definitely the most popular, and we all ended up slathering the breads with some cream cheese frosting I had leftover from another recipe.  That was definitely a tasty addition!  I only give 4 instead of 5 stars b/c I think the spice ratio needs to be tweaked - maybe more cinnamon and less nutmeg.  Great, nutritious bread - lovely with tea.

This made 2 regular sized loaves, 1 medium loaf & 3 mini loaves.  The texture is good.  I did use 1/2 cup apple sauce in place of 1/2 cup of oil and 2 cups white sugar + 2 cups Splenda, to cut down on some of the calories & fat.  I did not have the cloves, so I used the 1 1/2 tsp of each spice and then added 1 1/2 tsp of pumpkin spice.  I sprayed the pans with non-stick cooking spray and then dusted them with cinnamon/sugar mixture.  I used one of the mini loaves to sample.  Nicely flavored sweet bread.  I can't wait to give these as gifts!

This was very good pumpkin bread. YEAY no more money to Starbucks for pumpkin loaf !!! I did however substitute all the oil with applesauce (I can't stand to use oil if I can at all avoid it). My hubby does not agree with my stance on oil & he did not know the differnce. I dare say there was not a differnce to tell of. overall very very good bread

I made this recipe with a few adjustments to make it healthier and it was delicious! All I did was use Whole Wheat Flour, 9 egg whites and applesauce instead of the all-purpose flour, 6 eggs and the oil. My hubby took one loaf to work with him and it was a hit there also.

Great Recipe, I used fresh pumpkin (which was probably not worth the 5 hours of added effort). I added Walnut Pieces and Organic Raisins which I soaked in Capitan Morgan's Rum for 5 Days.

WONDERFUL!! I made this for a little Pre-Thanksgiving party this last weekend and had nothing but compliments and requests for the recipe.  I did put a brown sugar & walnut topping (with a little butter to make it stick together) on the top of the breads prior to baking.  I used the 29 ounce can of pumpkin and it was so moist!  I will be making this a traditional bread for the fall because my children have not stopped eating the leftovers!

This bread went over brilliantly with my workmates.  The first time I made it, I didn't realize I was out of cloves, so, I added Cardamom instead.  I later made another loaf with the cloves.  Frankly?  I adore the Cardamom more!  Gives it a bit of a different twist!

This recipe is so easy, a novice cook could do it.  I added raisins to mine and it added another layer of texture to the bread.  This recipe really can't be beat and my wife who is notoriously picky about her food loved it.  Thanks for the recipe...it will be a family favorite at Christmas time.  God Bless!

We thought this was a great recipe. We did different variations in each loaf - plain, with pecans, and with mini chocolate chips. All of them were great. Ours didn't get fully baked in the time specified, so had to keep baking, and the outside got a little browner than I would have liked. Wish I had put the foil on top sooner. We would definitely make again!

This recipe is moist and wonderful.  I downsized to 1 loaf and added mini chocolate chips.  The bread smelled so good while baking and came out perfect.

I knew it would be great before it went into the oven! Great recipe, I made two loaves and 12 muffins from this mix for my husbands training meeting!  I followed the recipe without any changes.  I did notice that my non stick pan worked better than my glass loaf pan.  Other than that its a keeper..will use this recipe again.

I've made this several times and this time used only wholewheat flour and increased the pumpkin to the whole 28 ounce can, but omitted all the oil. It was still very moist but did take a bit longer to bake. I also used a light cinnamon glaze on it and everyone loved it!

A definite keeper! Reduced recipe to half which made one 4x7 loaf and 6 good sized muffins I made these originally for a bake sale, but they never made it out of my kitchen!Deliciously moist, very flavorful (I really loaded in the cinnamon til you could REALLY smell it.)
I guess I'll just donate money to the bake sale!

I am crazy over anything pumpkin flavored- This bread is AMAZING!!  I use canola oil but cut it back by about 1/2 cup and use an entire can of pumpkin since I love that extra flavor.  I make sure and add all of my basic pumpkin pie spices and I could just eat this bread all day long!  THE BEST EVER!

*Tip* To get a soft, moist crust just cover the loaf in plastic wrap or place it in a covered cake dish/tupperware for a couple hours when it it still slightly warm! YUM!

I'm giving 4 stars cause the flavor was good with the right amount and blend of spices.  Way too much sugar - even my boys thought it was way too sweet.  I might try making it again with a lot less sugar.

Everyone said = Really Delicious. this recipe calls for a vast amount of ingredients, so I cut back white sugar to 2 cups and used 1/2 cup packed brown sugar, 1/2 cup applesauce in place of 1/2 cup of oil and had to use a little pumplin pie mix, which has a bit of sugar already in it. It made 32 muffins and I filled the empty muffin cups with 1/4 of water to even out the baking process. 30 minutes in 350 convection oven. MMMMMMmmmmmmmmmm

I was in need of another goodie to take to our Thanksgiving family get-together. Everyone loved it! I did scale the recipe down, as I didn't have enough eggs. I made 1/3 of the recipe. Perfect for 1 loaf. I topped the bread with a glaze made of evaporated milk, butter,vanilla and sugar. I also added a dash of pure vanilla to the batter. This recipe is a keeper! Thanks for sharing!

I love this recipe.  I have been using it for a few years now.  I made few adjustments by unsing sweet pototoe's instead of pumpkin.  I only use 1 cup of oil and 1/2 cup maple syrup to make the 1 1/2 cups liquid.  I also added 2 tbs. spiced rum. Chopped pecans are a must.  Best on the second day. Very good.  It is a favorite to share with others.

Great results!!! The bread is really moist, delicious, and easy to make. My only criticism is it is a little sweeter than I like so next time I will cut back on the sugar.

I make a very similar recipe to this one every year around Thanksgiving and Christmas. You add a bag of mini chocolate chips though and it's wonderful. I have a friend who asks me for this every year for her birthday.

This is a very good bread recipe.  I'm only giving it a four because I thought the spices were a little strong.  Next time i would use a little less of the nutmeg and cloves.  We made mini muffins out of the batter and used cream cheese frosting on top and it was delicious!  Thanks for the good recipe!

I added a teaspoon of ground ginger and substituted 1/2 of the oil with applesauce. Also added a teaspoon of vanilla.

OMG!!!!  This is just awesome!  I did use the 1/2 applesause 1/2 oil as suggested and added 1-1/2 tsp. ground ginger.  When using mini muffin tins you only need to bake them for 15 minutes.  My family and are are completely addicted!  Thank you for a great recipe!!

This stuff is delicious! I brought 2 loaves to a party (where they were promptly devoured), and we kept the 3rd for ourselves. This stuff gets better every day! I did make a few minor changes. I added roughly an extra cup of pumpkin. Instead of 1 1/2 tsp of each spice called for, I added 2 generous tsp. I also threw in 2 generous tsp of pumpkin pie spice, and a handful of mini chocolate chips. With those little changes, this was THE perfect pumpkin bread. Super-soft, cake-like texture.

My 15month old at a loaf all by herself in three days!  She loved it!  (My husband and I did too, but our daughter ate it all!)  We're going to have to keep a loaf of this in the house at all times, it's the healthiest thing I can get my toddler to eat!

This was SO good!!  Everyone I have shared this bread with has asked for the recipe!  I took others' suggestions and substituted applesauce for 1/2 cup oil, used less sugar, and substituted 1/4 of the flour with whole wheat flour.  I made it last weekend and froze most of it.  I'll have to make it again this weekend becuase we've already thawed and eaten the whole batch!!

This is a hit every time I make it.  It's a spicey fall favorite/  I get requests for it every year when the leaves fall.  I took the advice of other users and used apple sauce instead of the oil. Sometimes I do half and half.  This is a no fail recipe.  Too easy!

I made these into muffins and they are wonderful (especially warm out of the oven!)  I scaled the recipe to 24 servings and used one small can of pumpkin (15 oz)instead of the 2 cups of pumpkin (in the scaled down version).  My children loved them!

This made a wonderful moist loaf and I was delighted to have one for the freezer. I used one tin of pumpkin to make 2 loafs which was a bit less than I should have had according to the converter but it appeared to make no difference.

My whole family loved this pumpkin loaf!  Although, I took a few suggestions from others here and altered a few ingredients. I added 2 cups of brown sugar in lieu of just using white.  I also replaced 1/2 cup of unsweetened applesauce and only used 1 cup of oil instead of the 1 1/2 cups. Lastly, I added 2 tsp of vanilla and only 1 tsp of the ground cloves.  The loaves turned out great!  Oh... I did have to alter my baking time also. It ended up taking an hour and 15 minutes for the loaves to bake fully.  I am not sure if that was due to me changing the amount of oil and adding the applesauce or if it was because I used shiny metal pans instead of the dark non stick kind. But whatever the case, the loaves turned out moist and so flavourful!  This recipe is definitely a keeper! Thanks! :)

I used this recipe to make a heaping amount of mini loaves for people around Christmas time.  Everyone loved them - several people told me it was the best pumpkin bread they've ever tasted!  In some loaves I added chopped walnuts, which was great!  I might try adding different nuts next time around.

This recipe is wonderful and tastes so good! I actually made this into muffins instead of bread. I used olive oil (that's all I had) and also an egg replacer and made these into yummy Vegan pumpkin muffins. My non-vegan extended family also loved them. I took some to a family get together for Christmas and they were a hit! Thanks so much for the recipe!

I made this for Thanksgiving and it went over well.  It gets even moister after a few days making it a good recipe to make ahead of time.  

This recipe also made a good base for Banana Nut Bread Substituting 3 cups Pureed Banana.  And I added 1 1/2 Tsp Vanilla, 1 tsp Banana Extract, and 
1 1/2 c. chopped walnuts. It made 10 mini loaves and of course, we had to try one now and it also was moist and good.

Really great recipe!  I also cut the oil in half and used applesauce which worked out fine.  I used 2 fresh sugar pumpkins which gave me about 4-1/2 cups of pumpkin puree so I just used it all!  Great pumpkin flavor, really makes such a difference in taste when you use fresh.  I cut the amount of cloves to 1 tsp which was still a little too much.  It overpowered the flavor of the other spices.  I will definitely make this bread again with less cloves.

WONDERFUL!! My friend and I had to make 120 mini loaves of bread for our children's middle school staff appreciation day! We used this recipe and whipped them out in no time.  We even wrapped and decorated each one! Thank you for the great recipe!  P.S. My family LOVED it as well!

I brought this bread to Thanksgiving and it was a hit!  It was so easy to make and so yummy and moist.  You can adjust the serving size to fit your needs.  I halved the recipe and it made more than enough for 10 people and we had left overs.  Beware if you make a full batch, you will have A LOT of pumpkin bread.
VERY, VERY YUMMY!

This was excellent.  My whole family and friends enjoyed it.  I substituted the oil with sugar free applesause as recommended by previous reviewers 
and it turned out great.  I highly recommend using fresh pumpkin.  I think it makes a big difference in taste.

Taste great. Loved the texture and the pumpkin taste. Added chopped pecans and reduced the amount of cloves while upping the cinnamon. Served with some pecan butter from Williams-Sonoma.

An easy recipe, not overly sweet at all, simple to throw together. The only way I deviated was substituting pumpkin pie spice for the clove, because I was out of clove. Make 1 regular loaf and 6 mini loaves. If you want a sweeter pumpkin bread, try playing around with using a mix of brown and white sugar instead of just white.

I could have sworn that I followed this recipe to a T and it was way too dense and too moist.  I'll try a different recipe next time.

Simply Wonderful! Thanks for the recipe. I will make cream cheese frosting next time. I made the 3 loaves yesterday. My family was all over and I have only a half loaf left! That tells you how good it was.

This recipe is pretty darn good, it's a little plain by itself, and we have found that adding about 9 oz of craisins to the batch really livens up the bread.

A very yummy and easy pumpkin bread. :] At first it seemed like there was too much oil, but it turned out great after baking. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because the excessive amount of oil put me off a bit. Still very good though, thanks!

This recipe is fantastic.  I have used it four or five times and everyone loves it.  I use fresh pumpkin that I puree because I live overseas and it is hard to buy canned.  But it still tastes great and the texture doesn't change.  I also add a few more spices more cinnamon, a bit of ginger, cloves and sometimes nutmeg.  This recipe makes alot of bread but don't worry if you take it to work like I did everyone will love it.

This is a fantastic recipe, and very forgiving for the changes I made. Used 1/2 cup oil, 3 1/2 cups pumpkin (one 29 oz can), 3 cups sugar (instead of 4),  1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour, and 1/2 cup plain lowfat yogurt (thanks to the other reviewer who suggested it!). Moist, delicious, and got raves from everyone who tried it!

There were so many pumpkin breads to choose from, but I chose this recipe.  I'm not sorry I did! The bread was the easiest thing I've made so far this holiday season.  It's got nice mellow spicy pumpkin flavor and a light but dense, moist texture.  I made mini-loaves and baked them for about 35-40 minutes each.  They're in the freezer to be thawed later and given as gifts.  Great recipe! Thank you!

Great recipe!!  Added mini chocolate chips, a must, otherwise bread may be a bit boring.  Baked several and gave as holiday gifts.  Baked better in non-stick 9x5 loaf pans;  in regular pans, bread tended to stick to bottom even with the pans well greased.

This bread was awesome.  I had made it for my bible study group and everyone raved about it.  Infact, I just got a phone call asking if I have ever thought about selling them because her husband loved them so much.  
The problem I had with the recipe is that it fell apart too easily and stuck (even on the pampered chef stones).  I would make again as muffins using paper cups.  I think adding a light cream cheese whip on the top would be awesome. Thank you so much.  It's a keeper.

Thank you so much for this recipe!!!!  It was a huge hit at my Thanksgiving dinner!  

I used the whole can of pumpkin puree and I substituted 3 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice for the nutmeg and cloves.  I bought some little disposible bread tins and made 8 little loaves.

I sliced up 3 loaves before dinner and everyone wowed and raved.  Then everyone took a loaf when they left.  I WILL be making this again!

This bread has great texture, but you definitely need to mix-in dried cranberries & bump up the spices for the ultimate flavor. I added A 6-oz. bag of original Craisins, and increased the cinnamon (1 tbsp. total) and nutmeg (2 tsp. total). Also subbed applesauce for half the oil and used 1 cup brown sugar + 2.5 cups white sugar.  Super yummy!

this is so delicious!  i used half whole wheat flour and half brown sugar, and half apple sauce instead of oil.  i also added some ginger, and used 2 teaspoons of each spice instead of 1.5.  finally, i added 2 grated zucchini in addition to the 3 cups canned pumpkin and it was excellent

I made this for a church fall festival cake walk and they loved it. Before the festival even began there was someone trying to buy it from the silent auction. The other loaves were fought over. I will be making this again and again and again!!!! I found that it cooked better in mini loaf pans. Thanks for such an awesome recipe A+++

I was looking for a good pumpkin bread recipe and I think I've found it. I made this recipe yesterday and it went over well with my husband and son.  I even brought my co-worker a slice to work  today and she loved it. I adjusted the recipe to 24 but I only made one loaf and made 6 big muffins with the remaining batter. I did substitute 1 cup of sugar for 1/2 cup of brown sugar and I used 1/2 cup vegetable oil and 1/2 cup applesauce.  So moist and delicious!

This is the best pumpkin bread I have made.  It is super moist and very easy to make.  Perfectly spiced.  These loaves freeze well.  Also, for a variation try a struesel topping!  Great recipe!  Thanks!

This is a great recipe.  I changed it a bit to add a slightly different flavour.  I use a scale for metric and converted the recipe to metric. I used 131 grams of whole wheat flour, 131 grams of oatmeal, and 131 grams of white flour. Bascially that means I substituted white flour, whole wheat flour and oatmeal in equal parts to replace the all-purpose flour.   I also doubled the cinnamon, because I love cinnamon.  I will certainly make this recipe again.

This was a wonderful recipe! I scaled down the recipe to 24 servings and ended up making 1 9 x 5 loaf and 8 muffins. I ran out of white sugar, so I ended up using 1/2c white sugar, 1/2c splenda, and 1 1/2c brown sugar. Also used 1c all-purpose flour and 1c and 2T of wheat flour. The result was absolutely divine. Be sure not to overbake it! I think it's best when the middle is very moist and even slightly undercooked.

Excellent recipe!  I added a few more spices and a nice cream cheese ribbon (6 oz. cream cheese blended with 1 egg and sugar to taste (1/4 to 1/2 c.)) and had some delicious pumpkin muffins.  It would also be really good with some hazelnut cream cheese spread on after baking.

I've reviewed this in the past as five stars as-written, but the recipe just almost begs to be played with by adding raisins, craisins, or nuts (or all).  It's absolutely perfect everytime, and I'm always proud to share this bread - when there's actually any left to share!

***update*** Making a big batch now and thought I'd add:  Remember that the freshness of your spices will dictate how this turns out. I've seen several reviews which made me think ppl might need to update their spices. (I just threw away FOUR little bottles of ground cloves floating around my cabinets - four. Really.)

I thought it was great.  I used only a third of the recipe and got a small loaf and some muffins.  I also replaced half the oil with applesauce and added cranberries.  YUM!  I also didn't cook for as long because I wanted it to be super moist.  I cooked for probably 40 minutes, and it was good.

All I can say is.........WOW!!!  Look no further...this recipe is IT!!  Perfect amt. of spices, delicious flavor, and ohhhh so very moist!  I made two loaves plus a batch of mini muffins with the excess.  Everyone loved it, even the kids!  I sprinkled a little cinnamon sugar on top of the batter before baking which gave it a nice sweet crust.  I will make this again and again and again!!!  Thanks for the great (and simple) recipe!

Just finished baking this bread. It is WONDERFUL. No need to "test" this recipe before making it for guests. Made a few changes as follows:
> Used the whole can of pumpkin, about 3-1/2 cups.
> Used a cup of whole wheat flour and 3/4 cup of wheat gluton flour in place of plain white.
> Ran out of eggs, so used about 1/2 cup of cream cheese in place of 2 eggs. It's a substitution I'll do again, next time on purpose!

Delicious! Gluten free all purpose flour, applesauce instead of oil, 1 cup of sugar.

I tried this recipe tonight for the first time. After reading several changes other people had made, I did the same thing. I replaced the oil with unsweetend applesauce in place of the oil. I also reduced the sugar to 1 cup white sugar and 1 1/2 cups of light brown sugar. For the flour, I used self rising flour so no need for the baking powder, soda. or salt. The spices I increased to 2 tsps each. I used one 29 oz can of pumpkin. At the end I added a cap of pure vanilla. This made 4 loaves. One I made plain, one with raisins, and 2 with raisins and chopped walnuts. This is a dense bread but delicious! I couldn't wait for it to cool. I cut 2 small slices and put butter on top because the loaf was still warm. Delicious! My little dog thought so too! I will be making this again! Great idea for Christmas gifts!

I make this recipe every holiday season and everyone raves about it - I usually have to make multiple batches to keep up with the demand! I actually use 3 - 8" x 4" pans, which make for a puffier top loaf. Adding crushed walnuts adds a little extra texture, too. This recipe is super easy and comes out perfect and moist every time.

Didn't complete my review: so I made this last week and at everyone's suggestions, I halved the oil and added applesauce- also halved the white sugar and used brown sugar. It was delicious and moist!!  And like everyone said, can't tell that I substituted!!      THEN I made it again this week and left out the applesauce, used all oil (still did the half brown sugar).... it was absolutely FABULOUS and you definitely CAN tell the difference between the applesauce version and the original: make the original version, it is soooo much better!!!

Perfect with these modifications: use unsweetened applesauce instead of oil; double the spices;  and, use 29 oz canned pumpkin for no waste and a bit more pumpkin flavor.

This is the best pumpkin bread I have ever made.  The spices are perfect and it is very moist.  It makes 3 loaves so you can freeze one and keep one out. Definitely making this again!

I've made this bread three times and have not been disappointed.  You can taste all the spices - it's  the perfect combination.  My grandson loves this bread, especially  when I add chocolate chips!

My family loves this.  My daughter's family just left for a trip, but before leaving, my 2 YO grandson brought me an empty loaf pan out of the cupboard and said "more pumpkin bread, Jamma!".  He didn't mean for when they got back either - he wanted it to take with them
That's as good as endorsements get in my book!!

This turned out nice and moist, and made three nice big loaves.  I did use half brown sugar and half white sugar because I do love the taste of brown sugar in baked goods.  Also, instead of the different spices I just used pumpkin pie spice instead.  And, of course, it had to have pecans!  A delicious bread, a keeper!!!!

Followed some of the excellent suggestions  - 1 cup brown sugar; 1 1/2 cups white. 2 tsps on all the spices; 1/4 oil; 1 1/4 cup apple sauce (unsweetened)...2 loaves and 24 muffins. Plus I use a sugar pumpkin..so it is made with fresh puréed pumpkin. YUM!!

I found this recipe several years ago.  This is my go to Pumpkin Bread recipe.  It is moist and flavorful.  EVERYONE loves it. I have made it for co-workers, family dinners, and just because.  It can barely last the morning in the office.  I have scaled it to make one loaf and also made the full recipe.  As soon as the weather  gets cooler, this recipe comes out of the box.

This was the best pumpkin bread recipe I have used so far and believe me that is saying something. I only gave it four stars because I did add more spices and more pumpkin. That being said I am certain any novice could follow the directions implicitly and still be very happy with the outcome. Thank you for a very good recipe I am very tempted to change it to five stars but I didn't follow it completely.

This bread was excellent. I made it for dessert at a friends house  and  everybody raved. I did make a couple of changes because I don't use vegetable oil or that much fat in my baking. I substituted an additional cup of pumpkin and a half cup of butter for the one and a half cups of vegetable oil. Also, unfortunately my friend did not have any cloves, so I omitted that. The bread was exceptionally moist and delicious. I know it would have been delicious with the cloves as well. I will definitely make this again, next time with the cloves and maybe increasing the spices as one reviewer suggested.

I make this recipe entirely too much. If you change portions to 24 you can use one 15 oz can of pumpkin puree and make two loaves of bread. 
Yummy all year 'round! 
Thanks for the recipe Cheryl

Scaled down to make only 1 loaf.  Cooked for full hour.  Delicious.  Would consider adding walnuts next time.

Other than pumpkin spice face masks I never use pumpkin, but I had some unopened cans & wanted to test it out! I loved the recipe! I only had canola oil so I used that, & only used 2 cups of sugar instead of 4, I still absolutely loved it! When my husband gets off from work I'm sure he'll want to try it too!

YUM, loved it!!! Here are my healthy alterations: used only 1 cup of white flour and substituted 1 cup finely ground raw sunflower seeds and 1 cup finely ground oats for the rest of the flour. I used 1 cup of sugar instead of 2, added 1/2 cup of honey. I also added 3 tsp of vanilla, one egg, used only 1/2 cup of oil and increased the baking powder by a smidge, and added 1/4 tsp of cardamon. I made them in muffin tins. The muffins ROSE (I was surprised thinking they would be flatter because of the gluten free ingredient additions!). EXCELLENT texture and will definitely make these again and again!!!!!!!!!

While this was a good basic recipe, I think I would change a few things the next time I make this. It had an overwhelming flavor of vegetable oil.  I would have preferred butter.  Plus, the ratio of spices to the amount of batter was too little.  I would probably increase it to 2 Tbsp. Cinnamon, 1 Tbsp. Ground Ginger (not a fan of cloves) and 1 Tbsp. of Grated Nutmeg.  I also don't own 3 loaf pans, so I made a dozen muffins (baked for 20 mins.) and served them with a cream cheese frosting.  My frosting was the only way I could mask the flavor of the vegetable oil.

I made mini-loaves instead of the large loaves and they turned out beautiful, moist and delicious.  I did, however, set my timer to 30 minutes and kept a close eye on the loaves as they were baking.  Since I made the mini-loaves, it only took each batch around 30 minutes to bake.  This recipe was very easy to follow and it will definitely be a keeper.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe.

It fell flat as a pancake.  Very disappointing.  Stuck one of the loaves back into the oven and am waiting for it to come out.  Will report back on taste and if it helped.

Hands down, this is the best pumpkin bread recipe of three with 5 stars that I've tried.  It was super easy to make and baked perfectly in a stoneware loaf pan.  The taste was out of this World!

This is an awesome recipe.  I made it almost just as written, but I used a full 28 ounce can of pumpkin, slightly less sugar (1/2 cup less or so) and I used 4.5 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice in place of the individual cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves.  I made this into 3 dozen muffins: plain for the first two batches, then added chocolate chips for the last batch.  I sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top and baked each batch for 22-24 minutes as other reviewers suggested.  Deeeeeeelicious!

First I  didn't realize I used a 11x5" pan....but other than that kept everything the same..Had to increase time another 30mins or so and after a few toothpick pricks. Voila it was done..very moist and tasty..Used 2/15 oz cans also after reading a few reviews..Filled 2  pans halfway.the 3rd  was leftovers about an inch..the 2 baked up nicely to the top and the smaller one was ours right away..would make again.

I made this recipe last week with four 9th loaf pans. they came out great and everyone loved them. so much so that they wanted more for thanksgiving. As I prepped the recipe I noticed it said only three loaf pans, so I used three. I don't know what the hell happened but they are overflowing in my oven as we speak. not drastically, but I'm not enjoying the burning smell in my home now. looks like I'll have to get up early in the am and try to redo this before dinner at 3. And I'll be sure to use four pans next time. that's the only reason for the 4 stars, otherwise it would 5 all the way!

Wonderful recipe!  Love that it makes 3 loaves!!  Just a few changes. I used whole wheat flower completely. I used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar. I used unsweetened applesauce instead of the oil.

Just like everyone says, this makes delicious, beautiful loaves of pumpkin bread. I tried to make it as written this first time so I'd know what I wanted to change. I did end up adding a bit more cinnamon than called for. The only thing I would change to this perfectly good recipe would be to cut back on the sugar somewhat and make the sugar a blend of white and brown. But that's just personal preference. Enjoy these great loaves and thanks for the recipe!!

YUM YUM YUM!!! I made this into cupcakes since I didn't have the pan it called for. I doubled the cinnamon and nutmeg based on the reviews and it turned out delish! Had enough to give out to co workers and everyone loved them! It really satisfied my pumpkin spice craving. Enjoy!

We always add a cup of chopped pecans. And to the lady who found it dry after rescaling to a 2lb loaf, don't blame the recipe, the problem is what you did with it. I've been making this for 40+ years and have never had it turn out bad. The first recipe I used, used 1 lb. coffee cans to make it. Don't mess around with a recipe and then blame the recipe when it goes wrong.

I made it twice, both times just like the recipe states.  After cooking for 55 minutes, I took the bread out of the oven, checked for done-ness with a toothpick, and then put them on a cooling rack.  Both times, the bread fell from a nicely-rounded top to a caved in mess.  The taste is okay, but I won't serve this to friends or give as gifts.

I'm not a fan of pumpkin pie spice so I used apple pie spice instead and substituted 1 1/2 cups Equal for the white sugar and added 1/2 cup diced dried apricots.....best pumpkin bread ever!!!  Moist tasty and not over spiced, really does taste like pumpkin pie.

Today I had a can of pumpkin puree sitting in my cabinet. I wanted something sweet and found this recipe. The bread is delicious! I used a 29oz can of pumpkin and I added about a teaspoon of Mexican vanilla to the pumpkin batter. I added brandy soaked raisins to one 9x5 loaf. I baked at 350°F for one hour. My 3 yr old daughter will not stop eating the bread. I ended up with two 9x5 loaves & one 4x8 loaf. Next time I will add toasted pecans. Excellent recipe! Thank you

This was a fantastic recipe.  I don't normally change up a recipe until after I have made it exactly as written but I did not have all the spices on hand so I substituted with pumpkin pie spice and used a whole 30oz can of pumpkin.  Other than that I made no other changes and managed to get one loaf and almost 2 and a half dozen muffins from this recipe.  It's very simple to make and holds very well for at least 4 days (that's how long they lasted with only 3 people in my household).  I will definitely make this again, may even add a bit more pumpkin.  Thank you Cheryl for the tastey recipe.

Used Honey instead of sugar and applesauce instead of oil.  Will add more cinnamon next time and half as much honey (using some sugar) to see how it turns out.

I have made this recipe 3 times in the last week and a half. I received a good sized pumpkin in my Farm Share and it yielded a lot of pumpkin! Every time I made this it turned out great. My mixer isn't large enough to accommodate the recipe as is, so I shrunk one batch to 1/3 of the recipe and the other two batches to 2/3 of the recipe. Each one turned out great.  The only change I made was adding 1 tsp of vanilla extract. YUM! I made a couple loaves, and lots of muffins and mini muffins. They will be great to freeze and add to my kids lunches as a sweet surprise. Thank you for this recipe!

LOVE this recipe, bursting with spice flavor! Co worker said it was absolutely the best pumpkin bread she ever tried so I gave her the recipe with my minor changes.  Used 2 full 14 oz cans pumpkin puree. Completely substituted oil with 1 1/2 cups of cinnamon apple sauce since that is the kind I had. Added 1 1/2 tspns of allspice and 1 tspn vanilla. Added chips for kids, but I love it on its own. I may try Ginger next time just for fun (I love ginger). I made 2 loaves and about 18 muffins from the mix in same oven. Muffins took about 20 minutes. I will make this for my niece's baby shower.

This was the first time I've tried to make pumpkin bread. It was super easy and turned out perfectly. Great, moist texture. I added pumpkin seeds on top of the loaves and even made some mini muffins with the leftover batter. Saving this recipe to make it again!

Great recipe. Used part brown sugar as I was running out of regular sugar and also added 1 cup mini choc chips and maple glaze. Everyone loved it as cupcakes baked for about 20 min.

Not sure what happened, but I scaled this back to 1 loaf and it turned out pretty sad.  I used unsweetened applesauce in place of the oil, as I usually do for recipes.  It baked for 45 minutes at 350 but then I had to lower the temp to 325 for another 30 minutes.  It never cooked properly.

I was skeptical at first just because I live at high altitude and baking doesn't always work here. I did this recipe exact except I added 29 oz of pumpkin purée. Let me tell you this was absolutely amazing!!!! It is so yummy. It made 3 loafs plus 18 full muffins. I'm glad I did the muffins they took 28 min and the loafs took 1 hour each. I put two loafs in the freezer hope they taste just as good. Try this one out, you won't be disappointed.

I gave only 4 b'cos the sugar is way too much and to me the cloves should be reduced. Otherwise it is soft and moist and my house is full of such sweet smell and waiting 4 my hubby and kids to taste it. I have only one loaf pan so I reduced in to 2  thirds baked 1 part in loaf pan and other half in to 8" round cake pan. The cake pan took 40 mins and loaf pan took 50 mts. I also substituted applesauce 4 oil and buttermilk 4 eggs. Next time going to reduce sugar. Thnks 4 the wonderful recipie

I first baked this to use in a Pumpkin Trifle but it's so moist and delicious that I just make it to snack on now! I use allspice because I never have cloves and I'm generous when adding the spices. Turns out great every time!

This is amazing! I omit nutmeg and cloves because I am not a fan and double the cinnamon. For a low fat version I substitute pear sauce (or apple sauce) in place of the oil and voila! A healthier version of the best pumpkin bread. It is very moist and not super dense either.

This recipe came out great!  I made it using a mini loaf pan and it came out perfect after being in the oven for 40 minutes.  I added walnuts for texture, and the only other change I think I'll make next time is adding a bit of ginger.

I made this as written.   It came out perfect.  Three loaves, very nice and moist. It took 1 hour and 10 minutes plus.  I only gave it 3 stars because it lacked pumpkin and spice flavor.  I would double it and use the whole can of pumpkin rather than 3 cups. Unfortunately, I was disappointed.

Cheryl, just thought you'd like to know that this recipe is well, well loved in a little, northern Canadian town - Haines Junction, Yukon! I always make these as muffins and in fact, I have a bunch in the oven right now for a community breakfast at our school this morning.  The youth gobble them up (and I even put in one less cup of sugar)!  My fame around the school for "Mrs. S's Pumpkin Muffins" is all because you shared a recipe.  Thank you!

Exact measurements for a perfectly moist savory pumpkin bread. I discovered this recipe last year and every time I make it, it's an absolute hit! I added 2 shots of dark rum to my most recent batch.

Really good! I made 1/3 of the recipe and made 12 muffins. (It's probably enough batter for 13 though) I didn't think these were too sweet at all. I recently made boxed pumpkin muffins and those were way sweeter. The only change was canned pumpkin pie filling because I didn't have regular pumpkin.

I scaled this recipe down to only make one loaf - I figured I'd make sure I likde it before I committing to three loaves.  Based on other reviews, I cut the sugar back by 1/3 cup, and subbed apple sauce for half of the oil. I also topped the bread with walnut pieces.  I always omit nutmeg from my recipies as I simply do not like the flavor.  The flavor was great and the bread was still moist.

When I first told my hubby that I was going to make this, he did not look pleased. He said he didn't like pumpkin bread. I used a cushaw pumpkin puree that I had made and it turned out great. The hubby really enjoyed it and so did the group I shared it with. Although it made more than I had anticipated... I had no leftovers.Will definitely make again.

This is a fantastic recipe, I have made it several times already, and I am doing so again now.  I have juiced it up just a bit, I make my own pumpkin mash, add 2 teaspoons Nutmeg and 2 Teaspoons Ground CLove 2 teaspoons cinnamon.  Also I like to add 2 apples that I have covered in sugar and cinnamon cut into small pieces,  After the batter is mixed I add the apple chunks and just kinda fold them in.  Comes deliciously moist, the extra spices give a really great fall smell and taste.  Your mouth will be watering as it cooks and once they come out 3 loaves does not last long!

I tried this recipe for my husband who is doing chemo treatments and wanted something good to help with preventing nausea.  They served that purpose amazingly and the entire family loves them.  I have tried changing the servings and all of them have turned out wonderful.  I use the recipe to make cupcakes and they are scrumptious.

I changed this recipe as I was making it because when I halved the recipe the proportions seemed way off.  It was very dry, almost a dough rather than a batter....SO, I added twice as much pumpkin puree and I'm glad I did.  They turned out great (I did jumbo muffins, 30 minutes at 350)...One more tip is that I beat the eggs with a whisk for a minute before adding for a bit of airiness... and I also added ground ginger and less sugar.

OMG  These were great.  I made a few minor changes replacing 1 cup of oil with apple sauce and only using 1 tsp of nutmeg (that was all I had).  I made 2 loaves and a dozen muffins.  Cook muffins for 23 minutes at 350.

I made only one loaf, so needed to adjust the recipe, otherwise followed exactly as written.  I also made it two days ahead.  It was moist and flavorful.  I did sift the flour with the other dry ingredients.  I don't know if that makes a significant difference. I also kept in wrapped in a double layer of aluminum foil and kept if in the fridge.

I have made this two times now.  The first time I substituted a half a cup of oil w/ apple sauce.  It was soo delicious! Two loafs went to work with my hubs and they loooved it! 
The second time I substituted a majority of the oil with apple sauce.  Not a fan!!!!  I know its healthier but it was just not good.  My husband did not even want want to take it to work for the guys.  Actually most of it got thrown out.  I would not suggest making it this way.  I know its healthier but it is also not good.  
Both times I sprinkled the bread with sanding sugar and that gives it a pretty look and an extra yum!

Easy and delicious!  My 14-yr old daughter wanted to try a new recipe, so I challenged her to this one.  She followed the recipe exactly and the result was wonderful!  We decreased the ingredients to make 2 loaves (24 serving size) and ended up with two large loaves.  60 minutes in the oven was plenty.  My family gobbled up the first one within 24 hours!  We will make this again for sure to share with the rest of our family:)

After reading reviews I substituted oil for apple sauce (had some home made) and half sugar for brown sugar, added 3 tsps pumpkin pie spice and 1 tsp of cinnamon. Turned out great made three large loafs and only took 45 min to cook :) will make this again

Delicious! I halved the recipe and made 18 regular-sized muffins. Baked for 29 minutes in my oven. For the halved recipe, I used one whole 15oz can of pumpkin. I also used 1C white sugar and 1C packed brown sugar, instead of 2C white sugar. Because I hate having to scrub muffin tins, I did use cupcake wrappers and the muffins did not stick at all for me (as another reviewer had mentioned they did). Cooled for about 10 minutes in the tins and then removed them to the cooling rack. They've only been out of the oven for 1/2 hour and I've already eaten two!

Just made these muffins and a little less flavorful than I had hoped but still really good.  I am wondering if there should be a teaspoon of vanilla?  One of the banana bread recipes I have tried before calls for 1/2 cup of sour cream and it comes out moist every time.  Might try for next time?

My family love this recipe!  I do, however, make a couple changes.   The oil is cut to 1 cup, and the sugar content is reduced to 2 cups.  I would like to remove more oil, but it is a main moisture ingredient and applesauce would be carb enhancing.  Otherwise, an excellent version!  Thanks!

This came out great.  I made it lower in fat by using 1 c unsweetened applesauce and 1/2 c oil. I made 2 loaves (filling the pans 3/4 full) and 12 muffins out of this much batter. I  made a streusel topping out of brown sugar, butter, flour and cinnamon for one of the loaves and the mufffins.  My only mistake was using cupcake papers in the muffin tins.. they stuck to the paper pretty bad so next time I will try to remember to just grease the muffin tins. Thanks for the awesome recipe!

I love this recipe. The bread is very moist with a nice, crispy crust. I sprinkle cinnamon and sugar on top. I love that the recipe makes three loaves! The loaves freeze very well, too. My children are extremely picky eaters, and they devour this bread. Perfect for fall and winter!

This makes a good pumpkin bread. I did do a few things suggested by others to make it healthier - cut sugar to 1 cup white and 1 cup packed brown sugar, and used 1 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup oil. I upped spices to 2 teaspoons each. I made muffins for my daughter's kindergarten class, and the recipe made 24 large muffins plus enough leftover for a very small loaf.  Recommended!

This recipe is great! I make this all the time and it gets better and better. One thing I did do is cut down on the sugar. The puree is sweet enough that 4 cups of sugar isn't necessary. I also added chopped walnuts and they were great!

This was an amazingly simple and tasty recipe.  I didn't have vegetable oil so I substituted coconut oil which I was concerned with but it turned out fantastic.  I also had a real pumpkin one medium made the 3 cups of puree I needed.  I used whole wheat flour as well.  My husband does not like pumpkin bread and he was a definite fan.  I recommend making this one again and again.

Absolutely amazing!! So most and great texture and the taste is to die for! I halved the recipe and it made 12 perfectly sized muffins (bake for 20-25 minutes at 350). I also used applesauce instead of oil. SO GOOD! Thank you!!

Substituted oil for applesauce and I think this recipe is very good, but maybe a little too sweet.  Next time, use the oil.

This recipe was so delicious!  I did use half brown and half white sugar and used pumpkin pie spice (that was what i had on hand) doubling what the recipe called for.  I halfed the recipe for my trial run and it made 3 medium loaves.  Next time i will make the full recipe and give some out as gifts.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I had never made pumpkin bread before this. This recipe is superb. My whole family loves this bread- including my 1 and 4 year olds. There were two slight changes that I made: I didn't have cloves so I used a teaspoon of Allspice; and I used and entire 29 ounce can of pumkin which ended up being just slightly over 3 cups. I got 3 loaves out of this recipe. It's almost cake-like. My son tried a bit of whipped cream on his and thought it was tasty. It was perfection on its own though. This will be a new Fall staple in my house. Absolutely amazing bread.

Yum yum yummmmy! My family LOVES this bread. So easy to make and doesn't last long in the house. Thanks to the other review on muffin cook time. I also agree with the 10 minute longer cook time for a full size loaf. Eat it warm with whip cream on top and a cup of hot chocolate!

Wow!  My family and friends LOVED IT!    It was PERFECT with 3/4 cup unsweetened applesauce and 3/4 cup of canola oil. Next time I'll take the advice and try making it with only applesauce and no oil to see how it goes.

Delicious!!  Like a previous review stated - I used unsweetened applesauce and lowered the sugar.  Also I used fresh pumpkin and sinc it was more liquid than canned I had to up the flour about 1/2 c.  This is a new favorite!  I might try adding chocolate chips or pecans next time.

Used others' suggestions of cutting back slightly on oil and increasing spices to 2 tsp each. These changes worked great. Next time I might even add a little more of the spices. Bread is great but maybe a bit plain (sort of like a pumpkin pancake in loaf form). I think raisins would be the perfect antidote, adding another level of texture and flavor. Made a pan of 12 muffins (baked for 25min), one 8x4 loaf (baked for 50min), and one 9x5 loaf (baked for 1hour25min). Baked all three at once in the oven.  The only issue with baking was the very top of everything would be slightly undercooked despite the rest being perfectly done. Haven't figured out a solution to this, but perhaps I'll just have to bake longer and hope it doesn't dry out.

This was so easy to make and it was delicious!! I've been making it often during this season. It's super moist. I've also added some pecans to the mix and I love it!

I bake a lot, and my roommate just told me "I think this is the best thing you've made so far". I made a few modifications: 
-reduced recipe to 2/3 original volume
-omitted cloves (didn't have any)
-added 1 tsp ground ginger
-(from reduced recipe) replaced 2 tablespoons of flour with 2 tablespoons cocoa powder
-added ~1 cup chocolate chips
-baked as muffins, 20 mins at 350

amazing. I'm saving this recipe and I will make it again!

I make this every fall, exactly as written. It's super moist and flavorful. You'd think that three loaves are a lot, but with a family of all boys, they go within a few days. Really yummy with a cup of coffee.

This was very tasty , moist bread. I have tried others that I liked too. However, this one is awesome. I did make some changes though. I put half white/half whole wheat flour, half applesauce to replace half oil, only 3/4-1 cup honey, 4 eggs plus a flaxseed substitute egg. It seems like I completely changed the recipe, but 6 eggs seemed a bit too much. The bread came out tasting great.

So good. Cut down on nthe sugar slightly, and used applesauce n place of the vast majority of the oil...and was still so moist. Also added a bit more spices than what was called for. Used walnuts in, and on top of the bread. Very good. Will absolutely make again!

I used the advice of using apple sauce instead of oil, I used two of the single servings of apple sauce with cinnamon and it was wonderful!! made mini muffins for the kids, bigger muffins with chocolate chips and a loaf to give a way...love this recipe!

Very good and a pretty recipe as well.  I'll be making it for my rummage/bake sale next month.  I will double the spices like one reviewer did, only because I love alot of spice.  Thank you for a great recipe!

I agree with another reviewer who said: too much spice, not enough pumpkin flavor.  It's good, just not what I would expect from pumpkin bread.  It should be called "spice bread."

Even for an amateur, this recipe was easy and turned out great.  I modified it a little bit by doubling the nutmeg and wanted to add a little bit of fiber so I substituted 2 cups of the white flour for whole wheat flour.  It was a success!  Even friends that cringe at the thought of "whole wheat" didn't even know it was in the bread!  Overall, this recipe is quick, easy and delicious!

I halved the recipe and made 12 muffins and 1 mini loaf.I used fresh pumpkin and replaced part of the oil with applesauce.I thought it was pretty good but it wasn't as moist as other pumpkin breads I've made.

complete hit with the family... I used white whole wheat flour in place of the white flour and used EVOO instead of veg oil in an effort to make it a little healthier. Next time will try using splenda and see how that goes...

Delicious, although very sweet. I tried to make some healthy modifications and used unsweetened applesauce in place of the oil and used half ww flour. Next time I think I would decrease the sugar by at least 1 cup.

I cut the suger down a half a cup, but it was still a little too sweet.  I'll use three cups the next time I make this. Other than that, it wasn't too bad.  I'd make it again.

Love this recipe.  I doubled the spices and added 1 bag of Skor bits.  I tripled the recipe and gave a loaf to each of my neighbours and a few friends for their opinions.  It was unanimous.....this recipe is a keeper!

I followed the recommendations from the comment from Sara Jane--I substituted unsweetened apple sauce for oil--and it was great! Really moist and just so good! I am making it again already and I only just found this recipe last week :)

THIS RECIPE IS AMAZING. I have no insightful tips to add because it's absolutely perfect! I've made it four times now, as both loaves and muffins. I always 2/3 the recipe because a small can of pumpkin puree is 2 cups, but then I always kick myself for not buying an extra can.

Oh my, this was so very good! I made this in bread and muffins and it was great.  We also added chocolate chips to it which my daughter loved!  We used home made pumpkin puree and just added a touch of cornstarch to thicken it up.  Turned out wonderful, thanks for the recipe!

This pumpkin bread is amazing!  I use fat-free margarine instead of the vegetable oil and use half splenda half sugar.  Turned out great.  The whole family loved it and ate all 3 loaves in about 4 days.

This was excellent - a bit dry but I only had one can of pumpkin and that was 2.5 cups, so I probably should have added a banana or something.

I made 3 loaves of this bread last night.  Like another reviewer I did not measure the pumpkin I just used 1 28 ox can.  Also, I doubled the cinnamon because I love it and instead of cloves used all spice.  I also decreased the amount of flour to 4 cups.  It was delicious!  The mouth watering aroma that came while this was baking was heavenly!

This was really good. We made this for Thanksgiving & it was super easy to make. We made the first batch exactly to recipe & it turned out really good, but too sweet. It's really a cake, not bread. The second batch we used only 3 cups sugar & substituted unsweetened applesauce in place of the oil. (Also cut down the cloves to 1/2 teaspoon, but just for personal taste.) It turned out a lot less sweet, but had the same moist, fluffy texture. I'll be making it again for Christmas as a bundt cake with a cream icing cheese drizzle. ^_^

Delicious! Reduced to two loaves but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Next time I'll make three so I can give two away. I like to give home-baked goods as gifts when money is tight as it is this year. This is fantastic!

I give this recipe 5 stars for its reliable texture and moistness.  I have just a few suggestions:  If you factor the servings to 24 you get a very simple recipe to follow and two 5X8" loaves to be proud of.  If you make the 36 serving recipe it will produce 2-5X8" loaves and 24 cupcake sized muffins.  Save yourself the stress and use paper cups...  Do not put more than 2lbs. of batter in a loaf.  The top will be too dark by the time the bread is cooked (200F).  Don't be afraid to play with it.  I added 1C. each of raisans and craisans maserated in 1/4C. Marsala wine.  You can reduce the sugar for your own taste, but I found that it needs the oil.  One last pointer, use freshly ground spices.  It makes all the difference!  Bon Appetito--Chef Chris

taste is great...needs less oil or something because the bread was flat and slightly crunchy on top...will have to work on that.

SOOOOO good. I made both muffins and loaves with this recipe and the muffins took exactly 45 minutes, with the loaf taking a little longer. I'd say 10 minutes longer. These are excellent and I can't think of any way to make them better.

Very tasty! I halved the recipe since I didn't need so much and though some of my measurements were at best approximate - it still turned out fine. I substituted some plain yogurt for 1+cups of oil then made up the difference with oil. I was really pleased with how it turned out. I baked 2 small loaves and one large. The small ones were done perfectly in about 45 minutes but the big one had to bake about an 1 1/4 hour to get the center done.

My 8 year old who does not like anything new, LOVES this.  I made mini loaves and it still took nearly an hour to bake.  Mixed in mini chocolate chips into a few of the loaves and left the others as is.  This is a winner in my book!

My son and father (both pumpkin lovers) said this bread was very good. I am not a pumpkin "lover". I will comment that it was full of pumpkin flavor -- just a bit too sweet for my liking. Perhaps the addition of walnuts would counter the sweetness. Will make again, if requested.

Good basic pumpkin bread recipe! Made it as is and it was great! Cut back to make one loaf on next batch using applesauce for the oil, brown sugar, whole wheat flour, and added ginger with the spices. My husband loved it!

I was so excited to make this recipe for an annual brunch...what a disappointment! I followed the directions, changing only the spices (I'm not a clove fan), and my bread turned out VERY gummy. Even after baking it for SEVERAL extra minutes, it was a disaster. I gave it two stars instead of one despite thae fact that "bread" went into the garbage, because I did taste it and the flavor was great. Too bad!

I was looking for a Pumpkin Bread recipe that tasted like the bread my mom used to make, and I found it!  I added 1 c. of chopped walnuts to half of the batter, just because I like them in my bread. This is a great recipe and one that I will bake often.

I keep making this bread over and over! I subbed applesauce for half the oil, other than that, changed nothing. Perfect!

My husband says "delicious!" This was actually my first time making pumpkin bread, and it turned out awesome! Next time I'll try replacing some of the oil with unsweetened applesauce like many others have suggested. Will make again!

Made this recipe twice. First time with applesauce, was so bad had to throw it away. 2nd time made as written. I thought it was too bland, but my husband liked it. That's why 3 stars.

Awesome recipe.  I used 4 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice instead of the cinn/nutmeg/clove.  I also added a bag of cinnamon chips .  . . yummy!

This is the most moist pumpkin bread I have ever made! Delicious! I added walnuts and raisins. I even forgot to add vanilla and it still turned out wonderful! Thanks!

I've tried lots of pumpkin breads and they all seem to be good, but this one is for sure the best.  Just sweet enough, just moist enough, just the right amount of spice.  Yum!  I added a bag of semi-sweet choco chips, and that made it very chocolatly.  Next time maybe half a bag?  Delicious though!

Delicious!  Cut the sugar by 1/2 cup, used half oil and half apple sauce.  Still good and very moist.

This bread is fantastic!  I divided the batter into 3 and added chocolate chips to 1/3, nuts to 1/3, and left 1/3 plain.  I made them into 24 mini loaf pans which needed about 25min to cook in my oven.  I also substituted 1/2 cup apple sauce for 1/2 cup of the oil.  Didn't change the health factor by much, I'm sure, but made me feel a bit better.

My family loved this recipe.  I made the recipe as written except I added nuts and raisin, a family preference.  The only complaint is that it got a bit too done on the outside before the middle was done.

Love this recipe and have been using it for 2 seasons now...although, I do use a cup less sugar and 1/2 cup less oil (canola, not veg). I get requests from friends/family for more loaves after they've tried it. And, it's great with homemade pumpkin butter!

I used the fresh pumpkin pulp from our jack o lantern cuttings and scrapings. This even left me with plenty of pumpkin to make a soup with. I used 1 cup apple butter and 1/2 cup canola oil. 2 cups white sugar and 2 cups brown. 4 eggs and 1/2 cup egg white beaters, allspice instead of cloves. Yummy!

I cooked one loaf and one bundt with this recipe. The bundt came out perfectly and tasted amazing! The loaf pan required longer cooking time than called for and was still a little too moist in the very center. But the taste of this recipe is wonderful!

Excellent, moist pumpkin bread - my new favorite!  I decreased the sugar to 3 cups instead of 4 - I thought 4 seemed like a lot.  And I used fresh pumpkin puree that I had cooked down, and the results were perfect.  Oh yes, and I did add a cup or so of mini chocolate chips!

Wow! This is a great recipe. I used 2c. of white whole wheat flour (for added fiber) and 2-3/4c. white flour. It tastes great! I also baked a bit to long but it still turned out wonderful. I will definitely be making this again!!

I've made this twice now, cutting the recipe in half both times and making it in one 9x5 pan but not using quite all the batter.  I've made it with oil and with an oil/applesauce blend and its fantastic both ways.  I chose this because it didn't have any ginger, which I was out of.  Its my staple pumpkin recipe now!

This was super good! I brought it to my book group and everyone liked it. I did change a couple things, however, because of my preferences. First, I had read in another review that you can substitute all of the oil for unsweetened applesauce to make it healthier, and wanted to give it a try. We didn't have any applesauce, so my mom had the idea that I mash up some canned (unsweetend) pears and use that instead. It worked beautifully! I did use a 3 to 1 ratio of pear puree to oil, just to be safe, but in the future, I'll use all pear. Also, I decreased the amounts of nutmeg and cloves and increased the amount of cinnamon, just because that's how my family likes it. Thanks for a great recipe!

Mmmmmmmmm...what a great autumn bread!  I added chocolate chips and nuts and made mini loaves.  I had plenty for home, the kids to take to school, and send a couple with a friend.  I liked this recipe as it wasn't heavy and thick.  It was also seasoned properly for the fall...not too sweet.

Unbelievably good!  The only pumpkin bread recipe I'll use from now on.  I followed the advice of others and substituted apple sauce for half the oil.  Moist and delicious - you'd never know it had half the oil.  I also cut it from 36 servings to 24 and it made one regular loaf and 4 mini loaves.  Perfect!

Great recipe.  I was looking for an easy recipe with not a lot of ingredients.  this was perfect.  It was super easy to make and taste great.  I cut back on the ingredients to make two loaves instead of three.  I will look forward to making this again.

Awesome pumpkin bread! Exactly the taste I was looking for. I've been making this recipe as muffins (30 min) and mini muffins (15 minutes) and everyone begs me for more! Can't wait to bring a loaf to Thanksgiving dinner.

Terrific recipe!  I cut it by 1/3 and baked it in 4 mini loaf pans (make sure they are heavy - ceramic/glazed enamel  is what I use).  Came out beautifully.  Will definitely make again with nuts.

I used a 75/25 ratio of applesauce to oil, and the bread came out wonderfully! I baked for about 55 minutes and might decrease the time by five minutes next time. Like others suggested, I would add a little more spices, but that's mostly a matter of taste. I might also reduce the sugar by 1/2 next time to allow the pumpkin and spices to really shine. Great recipe!

The best. Pumpkin bread. Ever. No need to use all the oil; I substituted half the oil for unsweetened applesauce, and the bread was moist and delicious.  All that oil simply isn't necessary. Might try all applesauce and no oil next time as another reviewer noted. The perfect fall treat.

This is by far the best and easiest pumpkin bread recipe known to man. Cut the recipe by 2/3 so I only came out with one loaf but it is so good I probably should have made more!

Very easy recipe. I took the suggestion of others and used pumpkin pie spice but didn't omit the ground cloves in the original recipe. I think this was a mistake on my part and next time will omit the cloves and just use the pumpkin pie spice and maybe a little more cinnamon. I actually reduced the recipe amount to make 24 servings and used 2c of sugar instead of the amount called for. I felt 2 cups was plenty and could use even less. The 24 serving size yielded 72 mini muffins and I only had to bake the mini muffins for 15 minutes. Great recipe - thanks!

I love this Recipe! I added the 29 oz can of Pumpkin. I also have a whole grain wheat that I grind for my flour. I used this and it works wonderful. The bread is very moist and very yummy. It is so easy to make too. I would maybe add some more spices to it next time, for my personal preference, but it is good as is. I also only had 2 bread pans so for the leftover batter I made muffins. They are perfect and so tasty. I might like to try the muffins with a streusel top next time. That seems like it would be a very holiday desert/treat.

Really good and warming for a chilly morning. I scaled the recipe down to 6 servings to make a small loaf for breakfast. Also, to replace the oil I used 2 Tblsp veg oil and 2 Tblsp applesauce. For the sugar, I used 1/3 cup sugar and 1/3 cup applesauce.

This was a great recipe. I only wanted to make one loaf of bread (I converted it to 12 servings) so I chose to use one whole can (14oz) of pumpkin. I reduced the oil to 1/4 cup and probably could have used less w/ that much extra pumpkin. I also put a little more flour in. It turned out very rich but very good. I would have liked it a lot more if I had put in some walnuts but I have a young daughter so I didn't. Oh and make sure you bake it long enough.

This was reallyyy good. I used substitued 1 3/4 cups of the flour for whole wheat and 1 cup of the oil for applesauce. It was reallyyy good. I added chocolate chips to the batter. I also used a 28oz can of pumpkin. Maybe wasn't that moist, but it was probably because of the subsitutions I made. It's delicious though. I froze the mini loafs I made. (I made 3 mini loafs and two regular sized) and I gave the other large loaf to my grandma for her birthday

Wasn't as moist as I'd hoped.  Slices nicely.  Made enough to share and was good, just not great.  Would have been smart to have a spread/sauce.  Butter does not work and the cream cheese spread I made was still overwhelming to the bread itself.

Fantastic!! Moist and wonderful.  I think I'll add a little more of the cinnamon next time and maybe add some pumpkin pie spice, but otherwise it was perfect!  It makes a lot - enough to freeze for next time.

I am diabetic so we made ours with Splenda rather than with regular sugar.  My family loved it so much we now make it in the sandwich maker so we get it done faster!  In the sandwich maker all you do is poor some in, close the lid and when the light turns green (about 5 min) it's done and ready to eat!  HIGHLY RECCOMENDED RECIPE.  :o)

My sister and I love the Pumpkin Muffins from Panera Bread and I have long searched for a recipe that would be equivalent. This is nearly it. I think the cloves were a little stronger than what Panera uses but it was still awesome! Panera uses a cinnamon walnut streusel topping on the top though so I will be doing that next time(I used to work there-lol)  For anyone wanting to make this in a bread machine: I was able to do this easily. The recipe was rather large so I cut it down to a 1/3. I added all the ingredients into the bread pan in the order listed in the recipe. Then I set my bread machine to the 'express' setting. It may be called 'cake' or 'quick breads' on some machines. Some machines may not have it but mine did so it works well. Cutting the recipe down to 1/3 made for a small loaf- probably about 1.5 pounds but my machine can make up to a 3 pound loaf so will probably just half the original recipe next time.  My hubby loved it and says that I have to make this all the time now. The real test will be when my sister comes over tomorrow for some. ^_^

this bread is very good, I baked it for an hour and I would probably bake for another 10 minutes because it is really dense.  I gave 4 stars because it is so sweet.  I'll try to put less sugar next time.

Really good.  Made them Sunday morning for my sister... her in laws came to town.  Instead of a bread I made muffins, 15 medium/large muffins using  1/3 the recipe.  I also only baked them for 25-30 min.  I made them with out the oil and used applesauce instead. So moist and really good.  You would never know these were virtually fat free and really low cal!  Thanks

I have made this recipe many times. Everyone loves it, especially kids. The recipe is delicious exactly as it appears here.  It is also delicious modified to make it healthier. I've replaced some of all of the flour with wheat flour; some all of the vegetable oil with apple sauce (the more you use the more the flavor becomes pumpkin-apple); and and I've replaced some or all of the sugar with agave and/or honey. The recipe is always good. My only complaint is that the top gets sticky the second day, whether you store it on the counter or in the refrigerator. The only way I've come up with that helps is to replace some of the sugar with brown sugar, which is also delicious. (Or, just toast it and spread cream cheese on it.) Oh, and, don't hesitate to thrown in some extra pumpkin, and just plan to cook it a little longer. And, it freezes well (but the top is a little sticky). Delicious! A family favorite.

This pumpkin bread is wonderful and moist.  I substitute the canned pumpkin puree with fresh pumpkin puree and reduce the sugar by half since the fresh pumpkin puree adds natural sweetness and great flavor.    For another great alternative substitute the fresh pumpkin puree with fresh butternut squash puree.  This bread has a fabulous flavor!

Used whole wheat flour instead of all purpose flour - Superb!!!  Gave it the best texture you can imagine.  EVERYONE young to old loved it and it was gone in two days.  I also only made half the recipe and cooked it in a 9x13 pan.  This must have helped it cook more evenly.  Will try some apple sauce instead of oil next time.

I always use nearly 2x the pumpkin it only makes it more moist but it does spoil fast refrigerate or freeze ASAP. Coconut and raisins make it taste amazing. Oh yeah a bit of vanilla extract i have found adds a nice touch also I am always generous with the spices. Wow this is fun!!

This recipe is extremely easy for all cooking levels and the bread is quite moist and flavorful.  I personally prefer more spice to my pumpkin bread and increased the spice measurements but I recommend you try this recipe as is first before making changes.  I received many raves and recipe requests for this bread.

I made this with applesauce instead of oil - and it was wonderful.  I made 1/3 of the recipe, so it would only make 1 loaf - I had no need for 3.  It worked out perfectly.  I will definitely make this again.

Very good pumpkin bread recipe--it got rave reviews.  I added mini chocolate chips (a half bag), and I substituted all of the spices with an equal amount of pumpkin pie spice (less measuring for me).  I used my own homemade pumpkin puree, and it came out perfect.  This will be my recipe from now on, and I have had requests for it already.  This recipe made 10 little loaves, in case you want to make them for gifts.  Thanks!

This was really good. We made it in a large sheet, actually 2 9x13 pans, and frosted it with cream cheese frosting as a dessert. The recipe makes a ton, so be prepared to share!  We added 1 cup Crazins soaked in spiced rum to the batter, I highly recommend it!

I made this bread as directed except I used 1 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce.  I made mini loaves for teachers.  I cut one to sample.  My kids said "we don't think we like pumpkin bread".  I told them to just try it.  "We likey the pumpkin bread"  they shouted!  Yipee - another keeper from Allrecipes.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe.

I am giving the 3 stars, it could be better. I think it could be a bit more moist. The flavor is there, just not quite moist enough for me. I also made 3 different loaves in 2 different ovens. It is the recipe. Would make again with some tweeking.

This is the best pumpkin bread ever! I used to be addicted to Starbuck's pumpkin loaf, but this is much less expensive. I usually cut the recipe in half and it makes 18-20 muffins, so it only takes about 15-18 minutes to cook, or they'll get dry. My very picky two year old will eat 3 of these in a row. They're great for lunch boxes and sharing with neighbors. I just tried adding chocholate chips to some of the muffins and about died when I had one~ YUM!!!

This recipe was really easy and yummy!  I substituted all of the oil with natural applesauce. The applesauce does change the texture a little, but if you are looking to cut calories, it is not too noticeable and worth it!  I didn't double my spices but put heaping amounts in and it was very tasty.  (My spices are brand new, so very strong.) I made 6 mini loaves (all connected in one pan) which took about 20 minutes to bake.

DELICIOUS!!  I use an entire 29-ounce can of pumpkin... the flavor and texture are perfect!  I also use unsalted butter to grease my pan.  The smell that fills the kitchen while this bread is baking is wonderful!  Thanks for a fantastic recipe!

This bread was amazing!  With or without the raisins that I added to one loaf, it was all gone at our Thanksgiving get together.  I followed the recipe to the "T", yet sprinkled some brown sugar on the top for the last 25 minutes of baking.  FANTASTIC!!!

I will not make this recipe again. I followed this recipe to a "T" as well as added an additional 6 oz of pumpkin puree for extra affect. This bread came out tasting just like a sack of flour with a hint of cinnamon.  I don't know what everyone else did to make them love this recipe but I did not care for it.

This was fantastic!  I divided this into a large loaf (1 hr bake time), a small loaf (45 min bake time), regular sized muffins (30 min bake time) and mini muffins (15 minute bake time).  All were delicious.  I also mixed up the toppings, adding chopped pecans to some and drizzled powdered sugar glaze to others.  I had neighbors for coffee & everyone, kids included, loved them.  I had 4 requests for the recipe after the first batch!  I'm not a very good baker, but this recipe was easy & will definetely be a repeat recipe in my household!

I only had 1 cup of pumpkin so I cut everything into a third. Turned out fine!! It did take over an hour. I covered the top with foil so it wouldnt get too brown the last half hour. Top turned out perfectly.  I didnt add nuts or anything because of my kids. Everyone loved the bread. Next time I will make a full batch and add nuts to one loaf.

Just wonderful!!!! I only have one loaf pan so I used that and made one in a 9 x 13 cake pan... turned out GREAT!! We love this recipe..I cheated and bought chopped walnuts to add..next I'll chop my own--we like a litter bigger pieces.
Thanks! I used pumpkins out of my FIRST
garden Very easy to make and I baked it for about 1 hr. 10 min. both were done about the same time. Will make again and again! Also made the whole house smell 
soooooo yummy!!! Thanks again

I made this tonight and it was to die for! It's definitely going in my recipe box for all time use. Instead of 3 big breads I made 8 small loaves in the mini loaf pans. I wanted to make them small so I could share with my friends & neighbors.

Very good recipe (I used an electric mixer)& will be great for gift giving as I baked it in FOUR 8x4 disposable loaf pans placed on a large cookie sheet.  The compactness of it made thin slicing a dream.

This is a wonderful pumpkin bread recipe. Very easy and comes out so tasty and moist. Really feels like fall when you eat it! Only thing I would have done different is sift the flour. I got little "balls" of flour in the bread. Can't taste it but I now have 3 loaves of bread I can't really give away any because of the flour chunks. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

This bread is super tasty. It has the perfect blend of spices. I consider myself a novice baker and had no problems with this recipe. No tweaking needed- it is great just as it is!
Definitely make the large batch as stated because it really did go quickly!

I only had 4 jumbo eggs but I still had great results.  I put a bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips in the batch.  It made 2 loaves and 10 muffins.  My family ate all but 2 muffins on the way to the event.  At the event, the first loaf was gone just as soon as I put it out.  I went to go cut the other loaf and couldn't find it.  Turns out the hostess hid the other loaf since she wanted it for herself!  She laughed and told me, "don't you cut that one -- I'm keeping it!"  Needless to say, it was a big hit.  Thanks for the recipe.

This bread has the perfect texture and is so moist.  It is an easy recipe too!  I took the advice of some other raters and used the whole can of pumpkin.  Since this added more moisture I decreased the oil by 1/2 cup and it turned out great.  I left two loaves plain, and added some dried cranberries and walnuts and made it into muffins.  YUMMY!!!  I love that it makes a huge amount too, it saves me having to do the math to double or triple the recipe!  Thanks for my new favorite bread recipe.

Even though I accidentally reduced the recipe to 24 serving when I printed it, used 2 can of pumpkin and baked it in 3 square cake pans, it still came out great. I did add about 1 cup of chocolate chips. We don't even like pumpkin bread but I find my self in need of another batch since we gave two as gifts and the one I kept for us is just about gone. Definitely a winner!!!!

This was awesome! It was very well liked in our home. I didn't measure out the pumpkin puree I just added the whole can. I also doubled the measurements of the spices. It was moist and very delicious.

Absolutely delicious! I didn't need very much, so I thirded the recipe, and it still turned out beautifully. The only alterations I made were adding a teaspoon of vanilla and (as others have said) a little pumpkin pie spice. It was wonderful! Very moist!

Wow, I made this for a bakesale with my friends but we ate it all up before even selling it! I did take other people's advice by taking away the cloves and adding a tsp. of vanilla and subsituting half of the oil for apple sauce.  I would reccomend the cinnamon-sugar glaze on the top!

love this bread.  Other posts have probably already said it, but a 15oz. can of pumpkin will make two loaves and you can decrease the oil too.  I use Penzeys baking spice and it is a perfect sub for the spices.

My husband and I are not a huge fun of pumpkin, but since I had some canned pumpkin I tried this recepi.
And we both liked it!

As other people suggest, I used 1/4 cup of oil and 1 cup of brown sugar.
(I made only one loaf)

My husband wanted me to add more sugar and cinnamon next time.

This was amazing.  I scaled it to make 2 loaves, added more pumpkin than called for because I needed to use it up, and used part whole wheat, white whole wheat, and regular flour.  If you use whole wheat a secret is to add a splash of orange juice, they just go together, even though it sounds odd.  Even the picky kids liked it.

Update: just made it again used a whole 290z can of pumpkin, and doubled the spice or more than doubled.  It was great, the husband and kids loved it.  I added a cup on whole wheat and you didn't notice it.  I made 2 loaves and 12 muffins.  The muffins were obviously done and a little more than half the time of the loaves.

If you're looking for a recipe that is super moist and doesn't fall apart, this is it.  I used Libby's canned pumpkin and the loaves came out a beauiful deep pumpkin color.  I also cut back on the nutmeg quite a bit.  Next time I will try putting in some orange zest to enhance the flavor, and I probably won't leave as much nutmeg out.

Okay, I am in love with this bread.  It took me 5 minutes to whip it together.  My oven baked it perfectly in the exact time the recipe posted.  I did add an extra 1/4 cup of flour because I live in a high altitude.  It made a beautiful Bundt cake and one large loaf.  I did post a picture of this recipe. As with most quick breads, it tasted better the next day. You will have to hide it from the family though or it will never last that long

Yummy recipe - but unfortunately I did not follow the advice of so many others and add anything.  This would have been awesome with raisins or chocolate chips.  Also - it made 4 loafs for me.  Next Thanksgiving, I will do it again and try raisins in one, chocolate chips in one, nuts in one, and the other I'll leave plain.  This is moist and yummy!!!  A definite keeper!!!

Delicious!  For the first batch, I used 1/2 oil and 1/2 applesauce and the bread was wonderful.  Next, I used all applesauce and cooked it longer but it still seemed raw in the middle.  Has anybody tried all applesauce and if so, what did I do wrong?  At any rate, a great recipe!

Can only say WOW! We are not a fan of pumpkin  but it is that time of year, so I thought I would try this. We both shared at our  work. WONDERFUL..... Yum, everyone said. Never knew pumpkin tasted this good, so moist, spices were great would not change a thing cloves in a bread? DO NOT OMIT THIS, wonderful flavor. Will make this again and again, Thanks for this recepie!

This recipe was wonderful!!! Here are the modifications I made: I added 1 small shredded zucchini (I couldn't decide if I wanted to make zucchini or pumpkin bread, so I made both), used fresh pumpkin, used whole wheat flour instead of white, used only 2 cups of white sugar and about 1 cup of pure maple syrup (it was still plenty sweet), and used only about 1/2 cup of oil and 1 cup of apple sauce. The bread came out super moist and everyone gobbled it up - even the picky kids. Enjoy!

This recipe is awesome!
It baked up nice and dense, just the right amount of spices. Everybody asks me for the recipe, so I carry around print outs of the recipe from this site.

I did use a full 29 oz can of pumpkin for this, I didn't want to waste any.

I used 4 cups whole wheat flour and 3/4cup regular. Will probably just use all whole wheat next time, the texture was great. Also used unsweetened applesauce for half the oil, turned out fab. I ended up using a very large lasagna pan (don't have bread pans) and also 6 large muffins. I topped the muffins with crushed walnuts, yum! The big loaf took over an hour to cook (1.5 maybe? I just kept checking it) and the muffins took about half an hour. Already ate some warm from the oven, delish! The neighbors are saying how great it smells!

Pleasantly sweet and not too spicy, this bread is perfect. I say "is" because I'm eating it right now! The top is slighty crispy (maybe from the oil?) and the inside is tender, very moist and flecked with spices. I wanted to follow the recipe exactly so I picked up everything at Walm*rt, but since they were out of loaf pans, I used 3 8x8 cake pans and baked them for 1 hour.

This recipe is outstanding.  I added chocolate chips and cream cheese icing to the top. Even my 3 year old loves it. The only problem I had was that my bread took an hour and 35 minutes to bake and it still looked gooey at towards the bottom middle.  The top was deep brown, but certainly not over cooked.  I did make sure that the top sprung back when lightly pushed on.  I baked the 3 loaves together, two in metal pans one in a glass pan.  The one in the glass pan had to be left in ~5 minutes longer than the others.  I plan on baking this for others as a gift, or just to share. Great!

Turned out very nice! Before I baked it I tasted the batter, not enough spice for us, I added 1/2 tsp of coriander and a tsp of ginger.Also followed the 1 cup of oil advice and I cut the sugar to 3 cups. I got 2 good size loaves, and 12 muffins ( I added chunks of white chocolate to the muffins) Great! A nice time of year to make this, one loaf will go to work with me this week for a Halloween treat.

Outstanding!  Everyone in my house LOVED it! If you take a little extra time and make some cream cheese frosting, it really tops it off!!  Be prepared, I found the recipe makes a lot - 3 loves plus enough for a batch of mini muffins.  Well worth it though.  Thanks for sharing!

Excellent!!! I made it for my sons Pre-K class and it was a hit with the students and teachers as well. I did make a couple of changes though, like using mostly whole wheat flour and subbing half of the oil for unsweetened applesauce. It was so yummy!

I made two loaves and a batch of muffins.  I replaced 1/2 a cup of the oil with apple sauce; I'll probably try 1/2 and 1/2 next time.  It's a good recipe, although not quite pumpkin-y enough.  I jused a 29 oz can and didn't measure based on what was written here.  Next time, I will definitely add mini chocolate chips.

Love this recipe.  It was messy but I think this was my own issue.  I brought the clove down by 1/2 tsp and added 1 1/2 tsp ginger.  Also, I wound up having to bake for 1 hour 15 minutes.  Loved the flavors and the fact that I have three loaves for my efforts-this means there will be some left for tomorrow's coffee.  Very nice recipe, thanks for sharing!

I thought this was excellent and worth 5 stars, partially because it is ridiculously easy to make. I used 1/2 whole wheat flour and made it into muffins. Half of the recipe makes about 24 medium sized muffins. Chopped walnuts are a nice addition to the batter and crushed walnuts added to the top of the unbaked muffins dress them up a bit. The only thing I would do differently next time is lower the sugar amount: a wee bit too sweet for me!

I've finally made a loaf of bread I'm proud to share with neighbors!  Based on reviews, I too cut the oil back to 1 cup and added 1/2 cup applesauce.  Perfect texture and very delicious. Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

My wife is pregnant and had some pumpkin bread at a patch nearby and loved it so I thought I would make her some.  This turned out perfect!  I made this at halftime during a Sunday game with almost no effort.  Three loafs, 45-50 minutes and a perfect texture.  

I used 1/2 cup less sugar and added 1 tsp on ginger as well.  Next time I will modify just slightly and use 2tsp of nutmeg and cinnamon, 1 tsp of cloves and 1 tsp of ginger.  I didn't add ginger as some say, but that couldn't hurt.  Also, there is a post saying how a 28oz tin of puree gives an extra 1/2 cup, well I measured a 29oz tin (don't know why they'd have this size) and it just barely filled the three cups.

Delicious! I made a few changes though as recommended by other reviewers. I didn't change the oil amount (because I didn't have any applesauce and I also figured a cup and a half divided over 3 loaves wasn't too too bad). I used two 14 oz cans of pumpkin, 1 and half cups each white and brown sugar, cut the cloves to 1 tsp, upped the cinnamon and nutmeg to 2 tsps each and added 1/2 a tsp of pumpkin spice and topped it all with cream cheese icing!  It is fabulous and was awesome this morning with my coffee. My husband and two year old love it too!

Outstanding recipe. The aroma was wonderful in my kitchen. I did cut the white sugar in half in exchange for brown as well as cutting 1/2 the oil for applesauce.  My guests loved it and it was gone that day.

This recipe is great!! Thanks a lot!! I made this for a Christmas party and everyone loved it so much that they want me to make it for a big New Year's party. My question is whether I can make it for 100 people and instead of baking in loaf pans, can I use big foil pans? Appreciate any help....

I made oversized muffins with this recipe with a cream cheese frosting and they came out great.  They had a mild pumpkin taste and were nice and moist for quite a few days.  This has replaced my old recipe for pumplin bread.

This is a fabulous and delicious recipe! I followed the suggestion given by many of using half oil and half applesauce. And used two tsp of cinnimon and nutmeg and 1 1/2 tsp of cloves. I thought vanilla would be a great enhancement and it was perfect using 2 tsp. I made two loaves one without chopped pecans and one with pecans just to have some variety at Thanksgiving. And with the rest of the batter I added cranberries and made muffins for snacks and breakfast. I recieved many complements about how flavorful and moist the bread is and I'll be sure to make this tasty treat a tradition at Thanksgiving. Also having whipped pumpkin cream cheese on the side was a great addition for people to spread on the pumpkin bread that didn't have any pecans or cranberries in it. Go to your local bagel shop like Einstein Bros Bagels or Noah's and they usually carry this around in October and November.

Have made this several times and I really liked it...especially warmed with a little butter.  I made two loaves, then made muffins out of the remainder of the batter...kids like it better when it's in muffin form. Delicious!

This was excellent! I don't even like pumpkin but couldn't stop eating it! I added some mini chocolate chips as others suggested but followed the recipe exactly other than that. We'll make this again and freeze some.

Cheryl, where have you been all my life??? PLEASE send me all your recipes, if they are half this good! I can't believe I actually made this bread - it tastes like Bob Evans' pumpkin bread. I didn't have any cloves, so I subbed in 1/2 t allspice, and I had bought two 15 oz. cans of pumpkin, so I put it all in - almost another full cup of pumpkin, but it's PERFECT. One more thing - the loaves "sprang back when pressed gently" but they weren't done, so I used the toothpick for good measure. I fear I will eat a whole loaf before it cools...

The best!  Always a hit!  
One time I cut the recipe down so it only made one loaf.  As stated in the recipe you might as well make all of it.  It goes fast.  Freezes well.

MMMMM so good! I just made one loaf, but I used an entire can of pumpkin. I used crushed cloves instead of ground (just to give it an extra kick), and topped it off by pouring two coats of simple icing over top. This was delicious! The only problem is I'm having trouble not eating the entire loaf!

This is fab!  I divided the recipe in thirds because I had only a partial can of pumpkin.  Plus, it was a good teaching tool for my 2nd grader!  It came out perfect and my picky kids even asked for it in their lunches.  I replaced half the oil with applesauce to cut the fat a bit and baked it in an 8x8 pan for 50 min.  We'll be giving this away at the holidays this year.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Delicious, very tasty and nice moist texture.  I used half applesauce for the oil as others recommended, and frosted with confectioner's frosting.  Very yummy, thanks!

This is SO easy to make and not too spicy -- just mellow and pumpkin-y!  I replaces half of the white flour with whole wheat and it was great!  I also tried making it into muffins (which are great to freeze and pop in the toaster on school mornings).  I baked the muffins at 375 for 15 minutes for regular muffins and about 12 minutes for mini-muffins.  They were yummy and the kids all love them!  That's a healthy snack!

I will never make another pumpkin bread... this is the BEST!  Gave it as gifts this past Christmas and everyone raved.  Freezes well too.

Great recipe! It's easy for a novice like me and adaptable.  I've made it with sweet potatoes instead of pumpkin.  I've added shredded coconut, walnuts and a cream cheese topping from another pumpkin bread recipe on here. We love it.

I found this bread to be a bit too soggy for my liking. I followed the original recipe, however I used the smaller "mini-loaf" pans. Even so, the loafs came out well-done on the outside and soggy on the inside. Also, the amount of oil seemed excessive and made the bread greasy; maybe sub-ing apple sauce would have been a good idea.

This is a great recipe- especially with alterations. I added some walnuts, used 3 whole eggs, 2 egg whites, instead of six. I also used half a cup of splenda baking blend in place of one cup of sugar and half a cup of splenda's brown sugar blend and a cup of regular  brown sugar in place of the other two cups. I used cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger and pumpkin spice liberally (well over 1 and a half tsps of each). I used a cup and a half each of white flour and wheat flour, and 1 and 3/4ths cup of oats. I made both muffins (about 24) and a full sized loaf out of this batch, which I topped with a little brown sugar and some oats. Excellent- very moist, flavorful. Wonderful base recipe, but use your imagination and some cooking sense and you'll end up with something fabulous.

This recipe made me look good!  It was an absolute hit even with the pickiest eaters in my family.  Served it for Thanksgiving and there were no left overs from the three loaves of bread.

This was excellent. I 2/3rd it to make two loaves and it worked well.  Topped it with cream cheese icing and it is like cake.

A good way to give this as a gift is to bake the recipe in 1lb coffee cans, let cool and then wrap the outer can in pretty wrapping paper. Top off with the lid and a bow! Everyone always thinks it looks so pretty!

I made this Pumpkin bread for Thanksgiving and it was a big hit. I went by the recipie exactly and I made 4 giant loaves with it. Next time I am going to make one or two more. My neighbors all want the recipe. I am so excited about making it again. Next time I am going to make it in the smaller loaf pans. I think that I can make about 8-10. Thankyou and looking forward to making more great food.

I halved this recipe,using Libby's easy pumpkin pie canned pumpkin, and applesauce instead of oil. Tastes great, very sweet. With the addition of nuts and rasins or chopped apple this would be off the charts!!

I love this recipe!!!  It made 3 huge breads, I added the syrup to it from another review, and I sprinkled a small amount of crumb topping on the top made of brown sugar, oats, and sugar.  Just a very light layer though, too much took away from the taste of the bread.  This recipe completely rocks!! Thanks!!

YUM!!  The only change I made was to reduce the cloves to 1 tsp....next time I would reduce it even more as I find cloves to be overpowering.  But YUM! Even my husband who doesn't care for pumpkin, thinks this is delicious.

Absolutely delicious!  Followed the recipe just as it was and it turned out perfect.  I made one loaf and 28 muffins.  I added mini chocolate chips to the last batch and they are SO yummy!  Going to share them with my neighbors as a fall treat! Great recipe!  Thanks!

Was moist, and texture is nice. Light flavorful taste. Not overly sweet. Just perfect to go with evening tea. Keeper recipe. I added a little walnuts , and in one loaf added mini choc. chips for my children. Yummy! House smelled wonderful too during baking.

This recipe makes a LOT, but it is delicious!  I only have 2 large loaf pans, so I make 2 large loaves and 12 regular-sized muffins.  I usually add mini chocolate chips to at least one loaf (my husband prefers it without the chocolate chips).  I bake the muffins for 30 minutes, and they come out perfectly.  I have made it with half applesauce/half oil, and I couldn't tell a difference at all.  Great recipe!

Delicious!  Used fresh pumpkin puree, 1 tsp of cloves as suggested by other reviewers and it was fabulous!  It's A LOT too!  Used freshly ground whole wheat flour, 2 cups white and 2 cups of brown sugar.  I made two 9X5 loaves and a whole bunch of muffins!  Moist and yummy!

Came out very good! I had to make a few subs: used 3 1/2 cups of pumpkin as that was what was in the can (Couldnt see saving half a cup!) I used half white sugar, half borwn sugar and omited the cloves (didnt have any) I found that this made a dense, moist bread (exactly what i wanted!1) and It made 2 large loafs. I could see stretching it out to 3, but I like 2 better. Thanks!

This was spectacular.  The blend of flavours was superb.  I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  I also followed the advice of one of the reviewers and substituted some whole wheat flour and rolled oats in place of some of the white flour.

THE BEST!! I've made this recipe many, many times and it always comes out perfect with rave reviews! I grind fresh nutmeg (not as hard as it sounds, just buy whole nutmeg and use a grater) and use corn oil for utmost flavor.  I rarely even get a chance to freeze anything as my husband and neighbors eat it too fast!  Everyone loves the moist, dense texture and pie-like flavor.  It's requested at ever party and function.

Everyone asks for this recipe.  It's a family favorite.  I save some batter and add milk to get pancake batter consistency, cook the pancakes on the skillet in metal acorn/pumpkin/leaf cookie molds and they're so easy yet impressive for fall get-togethers.

I used half the recipe to make one big loaf of bread.  I had to add a banana to make up for the pumpkin that I lacked. I also added half a bag of choc chips.. What a recipe this is!
DELISH!

Fragrant, moist and delicious. I like to follow a recipe as is the first time for reviewing except as a few others stated I did use a whole large can of pumpkin, which is maybe an extra half cup. I also like the large amount it makes at one time. It is wonderful as is but next time I might try adding ginger, nuts or raisins. Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe is jam packed full of flavor!  It's not a heavy dense bread, but more light, which I like.  It made 4 mini loaves and one large loaf.  I used raisins and cranraisins.  Perfect for a winter day!  If I make this recipe again I would definately use less clove and less sugar since I felt if was a little overpowering.

I didn't care for this recipe. The bread didn't get done in the middle, it was too heavy and tasted gummy. I'm going to have to find my original recipe which was a real winner!

Incredible bread!  I substitued unsweetended applesauce for ALL of the oil and it came out so moist and perfect!  I also tossed in some raisins and pecans for a great texture.  Perfect bread highly recommended (even for my low fat version!

oooh. yumm.  No really, YUM.  I used fresh pumpkin with this (drained overnight).  I love spices but I had no cloves, so I went a little heavier on the cinnamon and nutmeg and I added a splash of ginger to give it a kick.  It was flavorful but even with the changes the flavor was well blended and none of the spices were overpowering.  And it's soo moist and fluffy.  Try a slice with cream cheese! This is a keeper!

This recipe is perfect.  I made some last night and could not wait for it to cool so we tried it when it was still hot.  Everyone loved it.  Will keep making this bread.  Thanks.

I cut the recipe down by 1/3 and made one loaf. I found that it needed to bake for slightly longer than one hour. It looked great but it was a little too sweet tasting and there weren't enough spices. I think that by using half brown sugar / half white and adding an extra tsp per loaf of pumpkin pie spice would really improve the taste.

This bread was not bad, after i made some changes. It needs more spice, but less cloves. Less sugar, used half brown. More punpkin. Then, quite good.

I made the triple recipe with one loaf of each: raisins, walnuts, and chocolate chips. The walnuts won, raisins a close second, but could have done without the chocolate chips.

I made this pumpkin bread today and everyone loved it.  Very easy to make..I made the muffins and the bread.  I like the muffins better.  I will be making this often.  It is as good as the pumpkin bread I had at Bob Evans in Buffalo, N.Y.

This is such a great recipe - Thank you Cheryl.  I used 1c. applesauce and 3/4 oil and it was so moist and delicious.  I also added 1 c. chopped walnuts.  I made 2 large loaves and 4 small.  On a couple of the loaves, I frosted with cream cheese frosting.  Yum!

I reallllly liked this bread. The reason why I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 is because I had to increase the spices a great deal. I also didn't have nutmeg, so I added more cloves, and ginger. I also added ALOT more cinnamon. Try eating the bread with honey butter. 3 parts butter, and 1 part hunny whipped. The recipe is also on this site.  =)

Best Pumpkin Bread I've ever made!  Even my husband commented on how good it was.  We are already on the second loaf.  I added a cup of pecans but it wasn't quite enough.  Next time I will make it 1 1/2 cups.

This bread was great!  I think I love pumpkin now.  (Plus, I really like the color orange.)  It was very moist, but that was probably my fault for not baking it long enough.  The spices were perfect.  A little different from pumpkin pie, but equally good.  High praise from my office-mate as well.  Kept well in the fridge.

This recipe is excellent!  It got rave reviews from all my family this Thanksgiving.  I made 3 loaves with chocolate chips.  The top got a little brown, so next time I may bake it at 325 for a little longer.

This is a great recipe.  Tastes like Thanksgiving. :)  Next time I make it, I'll try adding less cloves, though.  1 1/2 teaspoons was a bit overpowering.  Actually left a funny after taste.  Maybe half the cloves and more cinnamon.  One might even try a dash of ginger for even more kick.
The bread has a great shelf life, too.  It was still fresh and moist after 5 days at my house.

This is a great recipe, but I just couldn't bring myself to use 4 cups of sugar.  Instead, I used 1-1/2 cups white sugar and 1-1/2 cups dark brown sugar.  I made 3 dozen mini muffins and 2 dozen regular muffins instead of the bread loaves.  My 12-year-old son LOVED the batter - just had to lick the bowl!!  I'll definitely make this again.

This recipe is EXCELLENT! I made it this Thanksgiving and it was a hit - even with non-pumpkin fans! I had to bake mine for over an hour (but it could just be my oven). I will definitely be making it again, and I will pass it on to all my friends!

***Adjusted for one loaf only**** So tasty! I followed the recipe but used 2 cups purée, 1 1/2 cups flour, only 1/2 cup oil, 2 eggs.  For the baking powder I used 1 tsp, soda 1/2 tsp, and I upped the other spices to 1 tsp each.  Baked for 65 minutes and it’s delicious. I’ll be making this again.

I made this twice during the holidays and it is delicious, very most, and ages well agree a day or two. I'm not much of a cook, but this is an easy recipe to make and now one of my granddaughter's favorites.

This is a great recipe, first in flavor, and to make three loaves is amazing!  I've made it 3 times now and will use it when I am expecting to have company or go to a potluck.  Thank you!

I cut the recipe in half, which made one large loaf and one small. I didn't bother to measure the pumpkin, just figured one can was abut what was called for...it worked out perfectly. I'm not sure how long I baked my loaves, but obviously the smaller one less time. I think I started checking it after about 45 minutes, and just let it go until a toothpick came out fairly clean. 

The only other modification I made was to sprinkle raw sugar on top of the loaves before baking. My family just likes the crunchy, sweet topping that makes, so I do that on most quick-breads.

The end result---we loved these delicious, most pumpkin loaves!  We will definitely make this recipe again.

Reduced the sugar and oil and added pecans to half the batter to make one large loaf and 3 small sized keep at least 2 pecan halves each loaf that contains pecans so it will mark the loafs as having nuts.

Love this recipe.  I added shopped dried cranberries and a very small amount of chopped pecans.  I used cooked cushaw squash instead of pumpkin and I did add some allspice.. just for extra zing.   It rose nicely and is moist and won't last long around here.  

This is a large recipe.. makes a lot!!   I'm making even more to give as gifts to neighbors.. I have to use up the squash somehow!

Added chocolate chips and subbed half the sugar to brown sugar, since my home roasted pumpkin wasn't as sweet. It complimented the flavors well and added pepitas on top! It was a hit. Made Dozen muffins and two bread loaves.

Great recipe for a rich, dense bread. Like others, I used a full can of pumpkin (29 oz.) and substituted half of the oil with cinnamon applesauce. I also doubled the spices, except the ground cloves (a little overpowering) where I used 1tsp. ground cloves and 2 tsp. allspice. I cut the sugar back to half and substituted brown sugar for white. These are great as they are, but sometimes I fancy them up with cream cheese frosting!

This is an amazing recipe! I adjusted the recipe to 24 servings and it made 24 delicious muffin that my picky little loved! I used my own home-made pumpkin puree and even it asked for 1 cup of oil, I used half a cup of oil and an extra half cup of pumpkin puree and they turned out great! I wonder if I can make without any oil! This recipe is a definite keeper and I will make it again each fall!

I've used this recipe for 2 years in a row. I love it. Instead of all oil, however, I use 1 cup of melted butter and 1/2 cup of the oil. I, also, brush it with butter out of the oven and cover it in a glaze drizzle. It's a bread that freezes well, so you can eat it throughout the year.

Woot! Having made this recipe now 5 times and gone through 3 huge pumpkins for the fresh pulp I can say this recipe rocks. The measurements are easy to remember. The combination of cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg gives the bread a rich taste and delightful olfactory bang. It’s a relatively quick prep if you just want to use pulp from the can (one occasion). The best part though is that you end up with 3 loaves and the creative juices begin to flow. So far this year I’ve treated a few neighbors to surprise loaves and snuck a loaf into the freezer for a certain Turkey themed holiday. In return folks have offered me Canadian Ale and glad smiles... what standard recipe does all that

I have done this one 3 times and all came out great. This last round I did half in white sugar and half in brown sugar, and I always increase the cinnamon because I love it! I tend to tweak all my recipes with ingredients I like! For sure a great recipe. Try it!

I first bought the canned pumpkin in hopes of enticing my finicky senior dog to eat; read it was great for them and they loved it! Well, he wasn't interested, so ... now what? Looked for a great pumpkin recipe and this one jumped out at me. Changes I made: Like some of the others, I just used the whole can of puree (minus a teaspoon, lol) which at 29 ounces is  just over 3 1/2 cups; used 1 1/2 cups (sweet) applesauce instead of veg oil; halved the sugar; and doubled the spices. Made two loaves (an hour in the 350 oven was just about right) and 12 muffins (40 min.) The result? Moist, slightly chewy,  flavorful pieces of autumn that my husband can't stop eating. Really delicious! I'm going to try some of the other cooks' takes -- chocolate chips, nuts, raisins.  This is a recipe I'll be using for a very long time. (Gave a tiny piece to my dog -- who of course loved it. Go figure.) ;)

This pumpkin bread is wonderful. I have made this recipe several times each year. This bread freezes great and is so moist. I always put in chocolate chips, our favorite way, and give this bread for birthdays and Christmas gifts. It is always well received and requested. Best recipe ever!

Delicious!  I added chopped walnuts.  I cut the recipe down to only 1 loaf pan (divide by 3).  It was not a tall loaf but still flavor is excellent and not too sweet.

I also used more spices. I weighed them at 1 pound 4 ounces and got 4 loaves which made the cooking time more accurate. Git done in the middle without drying the edges. Very good ! Also didn't  use that much sugar !

This is the best pumpkin bread recipe I have ever tried. I make my own pumpkin purée, which I measure into 3 cup bags and use my food saver to close, then freeze. I have made this in a bundt pan, muffin tins and loaf pans. You have to adjust the baking time but always turns out wonderful. Large recipe so good to make to take to the office and still have at home.  Throw away all those other recipes, this is the only one you will ever need.

I made it and it's super yummy and pumpkiny! However to make it healthier and tastier for my family I made following changes: substitute 1/2 cup butter  1/2 oil 1/2 cup applesauce. (For the oil). Also, used only 1 cup white sugar. 1 cup brown sugar. ( Half of sigar in original recipe!) I added a tsp of vanilla too, just because. This made two loaves of bread, and nine muffins.

It made 6 little loaf pans for neighbors AND. Regular loaf pan! So plenty to go around. I think the spices come out a lot and taste a bit like a spice cake with pumpkin but still tasty! So a great gift for neighbors and friends/family and tasty.

This is a wonderful recipe for making three loaves, no need to alter a regular recipe for one loaf. I only changed one thing, I added a Tablespoon of pumpkin pie spice mix to it because we like it spicier and it was perfect! A really delicious and moist bread. I gave two away as gifts and was told it was the Best Ever! I had to make another batch!  In fact I will make more for Christmas because it was more enjoyed than any pie  we had.

This recipe is amazing! So moist and flavourful. I followed the advice of one reviewer - instead of 1 1/2 cups oil, I used 3/4 cups oil and 3/4 cup unsweetened apple sauce. Also added pecan pieces in batter and on top. Otherwise, I followed the recipe. I don't like cloves or nutmeg but I'm really glad I used them. I made 11 mini loafs. This will definitely be a do over for many years to come.

Amazingly delicious! I like to use all ingredients and measurements as indicated to follow the recipe to the T. This pumpkin bread is addicting. I’ve made this recipe 3 times and it always comes out super moist which it love. I did however had to leave it in the oven for about 10 minutes longer. You should definitely try this recipe as is.

Made it in a spring form Pam so I could make the recipe in one pan to take to a function. I made a simple glaze for a topping. It came out nicely, I will make this again.

This recipe makes a lot. I've made 1/2 and 1/3 of the recipe. Also, since each can of pumpkin is about 4 cups, when I make the full recipe I use less oil so it's not SO sticky and moist.

I used 3.5 cups pumpkin because I had a 15oz can and didn't want to leave behind 1/2 cup  that would've been left over. I split the flour between unbleached all purpose and whole wheat; used cane sugar, and olive oil (EVOO). I cooked it closer to 60-65 minutes because of the extra half cup of pumpkin puree and it tasted great!

Made with half whole wheat flour, added chopped walnuts, and reduced sugar to 3.25 cups- it was plenty sweet. Instead of 3 loaves, I made 2 loaves, 12 muffins, and 12 mini muffins. Delicious!

Yummy pumpkin bread!  Easy to make!  Will be a repeat recipe for me!  Only change I made was to increase the spices to two teaspoons and also added two teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice.  I love loads of flavor!!  My family gave this ten stars!!

This is the Best pumpkin Bread recipe ever! I have made the Downeast Maine recipe in the past but this recipe is a winner! I used 2 cans 15 oz. of pumpkin and 2 teaspoons of all the spices. Made a pecan, walnut, cinnamon sugar topping and sprinkled on top before baking! On my favorites list for sure!

I am completely confused on your pumpkin amount. But! Maybe it is the site that says a 15 oz can of pumpkin. 3 cups does not equal 15 oz. I adapted to scant 2/3 recipe and it turned out great.

This was sooo good. I normally don’t love pumpkin things, but wanted to make something festive for a Halloween party. Everyone loved it and so did I! I added mini chocolate chips and it was perfect. Will definitely make again!

Wonderful Recipe!! Only adjustment I made was using pumpkin pie slice instead of the individual spices. There was enough to make a loaf and 20 large muffins. Family and friends raved about it. This is now my go-to recipe!

I cut the recipe to make just one loaf. added a Tbsp of maple syrup, a pinch of ginger & a dash of pumpkin pie spice, plus extra of each spice, and used 1/2 white sugar & 1/2 brown instead of all white. After it came out of the oven, I added a sugar syrup wash to keep it moist & then drizzled with a powdered sugar icing. It was phenomenal - amazing texture & delicious.

I love this recipe and have made it many times.  The first time I made it, I had to substitution one cup of the white sugar for brown sugar since I ran out.  I thought it turned out great so I continue to do that.  I also double the spices, and I add a couple teaspoons of ground ginger as well.  This recipe is super moist and delicious!

I made this vegan and without sugar. I substituted all the eggs for bananas of various size (so 6 bananas), and I added a bit of stevia (probably about 1 tbs). I also added maybe 1 tsp of ground ginger. It came out great! The tops are a little hard, as this will happen when replacing eggs with bananas in baking, but it is so moist, and I'm pleased with the amount of sweetness. :) If you want to go the route I did, I would probably suggest adding more stevia to taste! Also as other reviewers suggested, I would cut the cloves by half. I'll make this again for sure.

Spices were a bit strong - use the full amount of cinnamon and cut nutmeg and cloves to 1 teaspoon each.

This bread is amazing. I did change a couple things because of my availability of ingredients. I used two cups of white sugar and 1cup of light brown sugar, added about 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract and I used 3 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice for my warm Spices. Very delicious. Will definitely make again.

Too much clove for me, and I would have taken out at 40 minutes instead of 45 as it was crunchy on the outside. Next time I will shorten the cook and use premixed pumpkin pie spice instead of the spices listed and I know it will be perfect for my tastes. This is a solid recipe, though. Saving it for future use.

We have made this recipe at least 20 times - it's THE BEST.

I often make a loaf or two plus another 12 muffins... just to have fun options for eating/sharing it.

My 7 year-old says: I think the recipe is great - it isn't cakey, it's just right!

Excellent pumpkin bread. I did make some of the modifications suggested - 50/50 mix of brown and white sugar and substituted applesauce for 1/2 the oil.  For fun holiday gifts, I baked the batter in 8 pint wide-mouth canning jars as detailed in "Banana Nut Bread Baked in a Jar" recipe on this site.  The bread was terrific and the presentation in the canning jars was really fun to do.  The canning jars work nicely not only for gifts but for smaller families if you don't want to commit to eating two whole loaves at once (although it is tempting).

Made this into muffins and it yielded 42. Also, I baked at 18 minutes (some other reviewers noted baking muffins between 22-24, but that would have been way too long for mine). Not sure why my bake time was so much less, I'm at a super low altitude (Pensacola beach, FL) but keep an eye on them!

I also substituted unsweetened applesauce for half of the oil. I used almost all of the sugar (~3.5 cups) called for because I didn't want to move to far away from the original recipe, but I wonder if I could have used cinnamon applesauce (sweetened) and cut more of both oil and sugar. I'll have to try that next time.

Funny story, I was making these late at night and in my tired state, used almost 2 TABLESPOONS of cinnamon (face smack). I had meant to increase from 1.5 tsp to 2 tsp, not TBS. I shrugged it off and still added the additional spices (but at the suggested amount) and they still turned out great! Not too cinnamon-y, which of course is what I was worried about. I do love cinnamon though but my husband didn't notice so I think it's safe to say, you can definitely go heavier on the cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves. 

Yum, typing up this review is making me hungry - time to go eat one of my muffins! You can't go wrong with this one :)

This is my favorite go to recipe for pumpkin bread. I’ve made this several times and it always comes out great.  Everyone also asks for the recipe. I’ve even subbed banana for the pumpkin and it makes a great banana bread.

I use this recipie for every event I need to make something. I get rave reviews from everyone that tries it. Because of this, I bake pumpkins every fall and separate it into 3 cup containers so its all good to go (I've made upwards of 20 batches in 2018 alone, that's 60 loaves total).

Deeelicious!!! I made 2 large loaves & 4 small loaves w/this recipe! Why bother using any other one when you can make this much all at same time???   Wonderful for Christmas gift giving & SOOO MUCH APPRECIATED!  Everyone says how moist it is & how well it keeps in fridge during holidays. I will never use another pumpkin bread recipe!  I add a cup of chopped walnuts to batter.  Next time, after I pour the batter into the large 9” x 3” pans, I plan on adding mini chocolate chips to the batter that  goes into the mini loaf pans... for something a lil bit different.

This is a great recipe! I used fresh pumpkin instead of canned pumpkin and the bread is very moist and a big hit will my family and friends.

I didn't even have proper measuring tools and this came out wonderfully. I cut out (approx.) one cup of sugar, as I don't like overly sweet foods and was making this for a health-conscious family with two small children. I made one large loaf, and put the rest of the batter into mini loaf pans. Both types baked well; neither dried out. I'm not a huge fan of pumpkin, but I had one of the mini loaves and it was very good.

I made muffins with this recipe, and they're AH. MAZING. 

I can't speak for loaves, but the muffins were so moist, and stayed that way. I would add a little more salt than recommended to really bring out the pumpkin flavor, or else they could turn out a little bland.

This is the best pumpkin bread I’ve had!! The spices are subtle but noticeable. I didn’t have enough bread pans so I made one loaf and 22 muffins. The bread took a little longer than a hour, but I put the muffins in for 30 minutes and that was the perfect amount of time for my oven. I also sprinkled some raw sugar on top for a little added crunch! Here’s a picture of mamma bread and all her baby breads…

I followed other reviewers' lead and used 1/2 applesauce, 1/2 oil.  I also doubled the spices.  I baked the loaves for 53 minutes and they were totally done.  Next time I will set my timer to 50 minutes and see what happens.

Delicious! Moist and flavorful, and spiced like pumpkin pie. I added walnuts and used fresh, homemade pumpkin purée. The recipe is huge. I only have one loaf pan, so I made muffins too. This made one loaf, 2 dozen full sized muffins, and two dozen mini-muffins. We'll be finding out how well this freezes, as we can't eat all this at once!

I made half recipe this evening. My 3 year old (and super fussy) daughter can't get enough of them. I made a dozen of them in the cake pop maker and the rest in a cake tin. She already had 5 of the ones made in the cake pop maker and keeps saying 'I'm gonna eat all of them'. This has never happened before for any food. Thank you so much!

LOVED it!!!  Best recipe I’ve ever used. Better then my all time favorite Starbucks pumpkin bread. As suggested in another review; I reduced the sugar; 1.5 cup white sugar and 1 c brown. It was Plenty sweet.  1 cup oil, 1/2 apple sauce.  It’s perfectly moist.   I chop pumpkin seeds and sprinkle on top. I use Nonstick tin liners,  and after 45 min I start to check center of the loaf with a toothpick, and every 2-5 min after, until toothpick comes out clean.  It’s very disappointing to over-bake and dry out the bread. I cool the bread, slice it, wrap it in Reynolds freezer paper, stick it in a freezer Gal bag, and freeze it. Every morning I take out a slice and place it in a ziplock bag. It’s perfect by mid morning school snack time. My kids Love it!!!

You have to be very careful and make sure it is cooked thoroughly. Ruined my first batch due to under-cooking. Second one came out great.

Loved this recipe.  I made muffins (about 23 min bake time).  I made some big changes because I needed to use up some butternut squash I had cooked the night before and didn't eat.  I peeled it, pureed it and then used it exactly like pumpkin.  I did add more spices to this bc I didn't want to taste squash and had to add a little milk to it as well because butternut squash seemed to be much stickier.   So just FYI: I lowered the sugar by a cup, lowered the oil by 1/4 cup as well, I also replaced 1.75 cups of all purpose flour with whole wheat flour because I just wanted to make it a little healthier and no one even would taste the difference at all!!   I know, I know, I know... I changed the recipe... how can I rate it??  Well, I'm not rating it poorly.  But I needed to use my squash up and this little switcharoo turned out GREAT.  (and I have LOTS more butternut squash puree left... 3 cups was about 1/2 a good size squash)  My boyfriend heard I made butternut squash bread and he almost didn't want to try it when he stopped by this evening, but he did and was very surprised it tasted just like pumpkin muffins.  It was wonderful.  Thank you!!!

Made this in three smaller tin loaf pans. They were not quite the size the recipe called for so I ended up having to cook it about 10 minutes longer than the recipe recommended. It came out moist and great anyway. Next time I’d put it into 4 tins instead of 3 - it was just about all I could fit in 3. Otherwise it’s great. Followed the recipe pretty much as is except I used a little extra pumpkin since I had a 28 oz can. I’ll make this again tho.

I think this is a great recipe, not as much pumpkin flavor as I like but very good!  I actually only added 1 1/4 sugar because I am cutting back on white sugar (and 4 cups sounded like a lot).  I then added some semi-sweet chocolate chips to one of the loaves.  They both came out great!  I liked the one with the chocolate better, ha!

I made this recipe substituting unsweetened apple sauce for the oil and cut the ingredients to make one loaf instead of three since I did not have enough pumpkin on hand. It smelled wonderful and I got compliments from a friend. Fresh spices are a must. Will be making this again

Made this a few days ago.  Cut the recipe in half just in case it didn't turn out.  One 15-oz can of pumpkin yields 1-3/4 c. pumpkin, just a little more than  what would be needed for 1/2 the recipe so I used the whole can.  I also did not have ground cloves so subbed pumpkin pie spice.  It made two loaves.  Took about an hour bake time.  

When the loaves cooled, I drizzled some icing left over from a package of cinnamon rolls.  Bread was very nice and moist.  

Rating it four stars instead of five because of the high amount of sugar; also, flavor didn't "knock my socks off"--pumpkin itself is rather mild so the spices are what boosts the flavor.  The icing added a bit to the taste.  Keeping the recipe and may come back to it.  Have plenty of other pumpkin bread recipes I plan to try.

I've made this several times and it is my go to recipe for pumpkin bread. I usually make 2 loaves and a dozen muffins. I lost the recipe for a couple years and had to try and alter some others but nothing else competes. You will have people that aren't big pumpkin fans devouring this and asking for more.

I used actual pumpkin purée from the pumpkins we grew in our garden.  I'll be freezing many more packages this fall so that I can make these loaves all winter!  This is a definite favourite of my family's!

This bread is delicious, very flavorful and moist. I got two loaf pans out of the recipe.   I also added caramel chips to it but they sank to the bottom.  Didn't hurt the flavor at all.  My family loved it.

I think this is the best pumpkin bread recipe on this site!  I have made it several times....I do cut the sugar back by about 1/4 as I like it a tad less sweet.  But it is very good both ways!

I make this recipe for the BNB I run and it is always a hit! I scale it down to 12 servings and make muffins. I use just shy a cup sugar and it is definitely sweet enough. I also add some vanilla.

Absolutely delicious...little changes I added pumpkin pie spice because I didn't have the cloves . Yummy, I gave some away because I made too much and was asked to provide more and even to make individual loafs. This is a winner

I used 1/2 cup coconut oil with 1 cup veg oil 
The entire large can of pumpkin 
Used whole wheat flour for 1/2 the flour
Cut the sugar back to 3 cups 
Added raisins to 1/2 the batter
I made 12 muffins and 3'medium sized loaves. 
I will definitely make it again.

I really liked this recipe. The only changes I made was cutting ground cloves by half . It was a hit and because it made 3 loaves  I got to feed 2 other families I will  make this again for sure. Also I always put sugar glaze on  my sweet breads for a added touch.

I made this for Christmas. It was very yummy I did make couple substitutes to make it healthier. I traded out oil for unsweetened cinnamon apple sauce and I cut the sugar amount in half. It was still plenty sweet.

I've made this recipe so many times now. Over the last three years I've made mini loves as Christmas gifts and everyone calls it pumpkin pie bread. I don't change a hung in the recipe- maybe cook a little longer for regular size loaves. It is great as muffins! This bread also freezes great! I freeze whole loaves, slices and muffins and they are great. One final note, I see several people say they skip the different spices and use pumpkin pie spice- I'm sure it's delicious that way but to me the hefty amount of ground cloves make this bread.

The batter I made from this recipe was a bit thick and it had me worried (Was it the homemade pumpkin puree?),  but the bread turned out super moist and delicious.   I like that it is a larger recipe, as well.   That way I can save a few small loaves in the freezer for later.  This is just a nice, simple recipe.   I will use it again and again.

Made 23 muffins using just half the recipe - it was perfect.  They rose beautifully and tasted wonderful, even with halving the oil and doing the other half with applesauce, and same with white sugar/brown.

I replaced half the oil with applesauce and 1 cup of white sugar with brown sugar.  I also used a full 29-oz. can of pumpkin.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious -- super-moist and cake-like.  It made two large loaves (which baked in 50 minutes) and two mini-loaves (which baked in 35 minutes).

I overcooked it a touch but it was still okay. The soft texture of the hot bread fooled me into thinking it needed more baking. Next time I make this recipe I'll probably just cook 55 minutes and see how it turns out. 

I also used an electric mixer to combine the ingredients which made the batter more smooth.

The flavor was good. Perfectly fine pumpkin bread.

3 cups sugar is plenty, i used half white flour and half whole wheat, spices need to be doubled.  add 2 tsp of ginger.  use 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup oil.  delicious with a sprinkling of choco chips.  reduce baking time.  delicious!  Reduced baking time.

Very moist .
Did substitute 1 1/2 cups brown sugar and 1 1/2 cups of white sugar for the 4 cups of sugar. Did use 30 oz of pumpkin.
For a dessert or breakfast muffin - I added a crumb topping with 1 cup flour, 1 cup of sugar riced with 1/2 stick of butter.  Delicious

I made muffins using this recipe and used a large can of pumpkin like another reviewer. I put cream cheese frosting on half of the muffins and left the other half untrusted. They were yummy and moist! Took some to work and everyone raved. Great recipe. :-)

epic fail!  inside of bread was basically raw and bottom was starting to burn (& my oven bakes a few degrees cool).  Only thing I changed up was using pumpkin pie spice vs the nutmeg, etc -  definitely won't be making this again

Made it again and much better with the following changes: 3/4 c unsalted butter and 1c unsweetened applesauce (3 containers of apple sauce snacks) for the oil; 1/2c brown sugar & 2 1/2c coconut sugar ( or just use brown sugar if you don't have coconut sugar) ; 1 3/4c whole wheat flour; 3 c all purpose flour; 1 1/2 tbsp cinnamon; 2 tsp nutmeg; 1 1/2c raw shelled pumpkin seeds; 2c dried cranberries ( craisins). I also used parchment paper to line the loaf pans so no need to grease the pans! Top with some craisins prior to baking and lowered temperature to 325 degrees to bake at 55 mins and turned out super moist and full of flavour!

It came out ok. I made it as written. The bread itself came out good, but it was too sweet, not enough pumpkin flavor or spices. If I make it again, I will add more pumpkin and spices and much less sugar.

This is a great simple recipe! The only changes I made were: I cut the recipe in thirds because it was just a test run, so I only made one loaf. I also only added about 3/4 cup of sugar (instead of the 1 1/3 cups that it called for) because the original recipe called for a lot. Lastly, I used 1 1/2 tsp. of Apple Pie Seasoning from Penzeys instead of 1/2 tsp of cloves, nutmeg, and cinnamon. It turned out a little bit dry, and it wasn't like "WOW!" which are the only reasons I didn't give it 5 stars, but it's definitely good for a simple recipe. :) Might add chocolate chips next time.

Excellent recipe, easy to put together and I love that you get three loaves out of it! I used 2 tsp of each of the spices like other reviewers and I also put chopped pecan pieces on the top of each loaf (rather than mixing nuts into the batter). In my oven, these took a good hour and twenty minutes to bake, I suspect due to the addition of the nuts. This recipe is a keeper, I know I'll make this bread again and again!

While I read many of the reviews and made some modifications (used all applesauce instead of oil; added ginger and allspice) I was not completely impressed with the results.  It didn't have the flavor I was expecting.

I added a splash of vanilla to be fancy. I only made one bread pan, so I cut the serving size down to 12 instead of 36. It was a big hit. The bread was moist and delicious. I will definitely make this again. I will say, after an hour, I took the bread out and it was still soft on top and in the middle. I set the oven on broil for a FEW minutes to finish the job. Turned out perfectly. Yum.

This was a big hit! I made a couple tweaks: I used only 1 cup oil & then increased the canned puréed pumpkin to (2) 15 oz cans. I also added one regular sized bag of milk chocolate chips- because chocolate makes everything better! Kids and adults alike loved this bread- what a great fall treat!

I altered the recipe by using pumpkin pie mix  (that's what I had in the cupboard). I omitted all the spices, used half the oil & apple sauce for the remainder of the oil amount. Lastly I only put in 2 cups of sugar bc the pumpkin pie mixture has sugar in it as well. I baked for close to an hour. Pop a slice in the microwave for a few seconds with butter and yum-me! You have a treat.

I had no white sugar, so I used light brown. I had no vegetable oil, so I used olive oil and applesauce (1/2 and 1/2). I had no bread pan so I used a brownie pan. I added some walnuts... Because if there are walnuts in anything then it's healthy, right?
IT WAS REALLY GOOD! great texture, not overly sweet but very satisfying.

Delicious light muffins and bundt cake! Thanks for a great recipe. I used fresh pumpkin puree (our own). I did substitute 2 cups whole wheat flour for AP, and 1 1/4 cups yogurt for the same quantity of oil. I added a tsp of baking soda and one of powdered ginger. I used 4 eggs instead of 6. It had a beautiful brown slightly crisp crust, with a soft, well-baked and spice-flavored interior. I had tried other recipes before without much success, so I am really pleased with the way this one turned out.

My kids love Pumpkin bread and I am constantly trying new recipes to see if I like one better than another.  This one was a hit and baked properly and evenly.  I did add a little extra of the spices just because we like it that way.  I froze two loaves for future breakfasts.

Great go to pumpkin bread recipe. I added 1 tsp of ginger as I have used that before. Also I only have 2 9x5 pans, so i also made a dozen muffins. For those I baked them about 25-30 minutes.

I have made this so many times .   I love that it makes three loaves it doesn't take any extra time and I put two in the freezer for later. 
 Like everything else I make I alter the recipe.  I don't use any vegetable oil I, use equal parts butter, coconut oil, and avocado oil.  I substitute some coconut flour for a portion of the flour, and some coconut sugar and Stevia for a portion of the sugar 
 I also grind nuts to a texture of almost a meal and then add that in with the flour.  I also add in some small dark chocolate chips and I add in about a quarter cup of molasses to the batter 
 Finally I use cooked pumpkin that I do in the fall. Sometimes my portions are short of 3 cups. If they are I make up the difference with mashed bananas

I make snacks for 100+ children at a daycare, so I tried this, leaving out the nutmeg and cloves to make it more toddler-friendly. I made just one other change, because our daycare avoids the use of oil in baking: I substituted melted butter for the oil, and I can't detect a flavor difference.  Instead of greasing and flouring the pans, I just spray with oil spray, which works perfectly and is less trouble. I baked six loaves and it was a big hit with both the kids and the teachers. The kids asked for "more cake" in requesting seconds! It's really easy to make in quantity, too! This has now become one of the daycare's standard snacks in rotation. Thanks, Cheryl, for a great recipe!

The best pumpkin bread. I steamed my own pumpkins and instead of oil I used one cup of unsweetened applesauce and only 3 cups of sugar. I gave away mini loaves during the holidays and it was a big hit. I'll be making this again.

If you have extra pumpkin from opening a can(s) containing more than the recipe calls for, throw it in too! I accidentally read "can" instead of "cup" the first time I made this and it was the most moist and perfectly pumpkiny bread I've ever had... And I have worked in multiple bakeries that sold pumpkin bread.

Good not great. Added golden raisins to make it a bit more interesting but still lacked some 'wow' flavor. But decent enough recipe if you're looking to get rid of extra pumpkin puree.

So easy and so good!! I did put less pumpkin only bc I had 3/4 of a can left from making pumpkin cheesecake pie, but the bread still came out great. If your family isn't into super sweet desserts, then this is the recipe for you.

Super moist and gets better with age.  I have also made it subbing in applesauce for the oil and you can't tell the difference.  Also subbed one of the cups of white sugar for brown sugar.  Still delish.  You just can't make this taste anything but moist and yummy.

I used real pumpkin, Splenda sugar blend and not the full amount.  Didn't have nutmeg so I used pumpkin pie spice and extra cinnamon.  Since I modified I couldn't give it 5 stars, but my version was a hit with the recipients.

Substituted applesauce for the oil, and it was very moist. Baked perfectly. I added dried cranberries  and  chopped pecans.  It disappeared quickly!  Everyone commented on how good it was.

Absolutely Scrumptious! Made 1 loaf so I scaled it back to 12 servings on this site's servings adjuster and it came out perfect in one 9x5 pan. Next Time (and there will definitely be a next time), I am going to add 1/2 cup of chopped pecans. Great stuff!!

This is the real deal.  Wouldn't change a thing.  Makes a large batch so is great for holiday gift giving.

It really does take at least an hour to cook (in my oven anyway) or otherwise will be mushy in the middle.

This was wonderful. I've never had pumpkin bread before and so it didn't taste as strongly of pumpkin as I expected it to but that might be on the fault of the pumpkin I used. I made the puree myself from an extra Halloween pumpkin. Next time, I'll use either a pumpkin pie pumpkin, or just buy a couple of cans of pumpkin. 

With that said, I loved it. I halved the sugar due to personal preference and it was perfect. Really moist, tender crumb. Smells fantastic, and it's really filling.
I made one loaf with nothing added, one loaf with raisins and walnuts, and one loaf with chocolate chips and they were all wonderful. 

Definitely making this again.

You can also make muffins with this recipe - SO much better than the other pumpkin muffin recipes on here! Just bake 25-30 minutes for regular sized muffins (mini muffins are about 10-15). These are perfectly sweet without needing icing. We actually cut the sugar a little bit to make our dog a special treat :) she loves them!

I don't think this recipe is meant to be scaled down. I scaled this recipe down for one loaf.  Taste like something is missing.  Will try again.

This recipe has been my favorite so far for pumpkin loafs. I adjusted the recipe a little bit to fit my ingredients on hand and it turned out perfectly (I didn't include the ground cloves and used only 2 cans of pumpkin puree). I'll definitely make it the same way next time. 

It also made a lot more than I realized, two loafs and one dozen muffins. I was too tired to bake it all the day I put it together so I actually refrigerated half of it and it kept well for 3 days. When I baked the last portion, I actually think it tasted better after the ingredients set in the fridge! This will definitely be my 'go to' recipe from now on.

I scaled it down to make one loaf since I was just using leftover pumpkin puree.  The only change I made was to add about 1/3 cup of chopped pecans and it turned out perfect!  Love the spice!

I've made this lots of times - it's delicious every time!  I have made some changes over time: cut the oil down to no more than 1 1/4 C, cut the sugar down to 3 C, use the entire can of pumpkin,  1T each cin & nutmeg, 2tsp clove, add about 1 1/2 bags of chocolate chunks.  Oh, and I use a hodge podge of pans- smaller "gift" tins and medium loaf (and usually one regular loaf).  This means I have to do two rounds of baking but 45mins is usually fine for the smaller ones.  My son LOVES this! :)

OH MY GOODNESS! These are divine. Only changes were 1/2 oil and 1/2 apple sauce. My apple sauce was sweetened so I took away 1C of sugar. I also did 2T of the nutmeg, cinnamon and cloves. THANK YOU!

This was perfect pumpkin bread!  I measured it down to one loaf pan (12 servings) and added chocolate chips.  I gave myself a pat on the back when it was done.  Great recipe!  Will absolutely make again!

way too much clove flavor for my liking. I'll try the recipe again with much less ground cloves or omit it completely. otherwise the texture of the bread itself is great. I made muffins I got 32 muffins all together. added chocolate chips in the last half of the batter.

This recipe was very easy and made very good bread. It was less dense and moist than other breads but quite tasty. There was also an interesting spice combination that seemed to be heavy on the clove (proportionately), resulting in a slightly atypical flavor (but still good).

This recipe is so easy and amazingly good. You might think 3 loaves is excessive, but trust me, they're going to go fast. It's only mid October and I'm already on my third batch of this stuff! It makes a great side to bring to parties and great little gifts to give to family and friends to know you are thinking of them!

I made it WAY healthier and it was still fabulous.  We used whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose, 30 oz of pumpkin, cut the sugar in half, reduced the oil to 1 cup, and added chocolate chips.  I had to grind my own nutmeg and cloves, the fresh spices may have helped a lot with the flavor.  I will make this monthly for my kids for snack, good way to get more pumpkin into the family.

This recipe turned out very well, good flavor and easy to make.  Sometimes we even make it into large muffins for a quick and easy breakfast snack.  I did add a whole large can of pumpkin which comes out to about 4 cups instead of three and I add rehydrated raisins too.  I just soak the raisins in water until they plump up and they stay chewy in the bread.  Good stuff.

Perfect! 

(If you want to be healthier, you can decrease the oil and sugar and it will be fine! It's already very sweet.)

I scaled down the recipe to yield 2 loaves.  Instead of using 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp nutmeg and 1 tsp cloves, I doubled the cinnamon and added 1 tsp pumpkin spice.  I also added 3 tsp vanilla extract and a handful of chocolate chips!  The loaves turned out moist, sweet, and delicious every time, and I had friends asking for the recipe.  This one is a keeper!

This recipe is scrumptious!  The only changes I made were to increase all of the spices a little and I made them into muffins instead of loaves.  It took 24 minutes to bake the muffins (regular sized, not jumbo).  I will definitely make this recipe again.  Thanks for sharing!

Wundebar! I've made a few adjustments: fresh puree left over from my Halloween pumpkin which is so much tastier than the canned stuff, wheat flour instead of white (better taste and texture), 3 cups of raw sugar instead of 4 cups of white sugar (better taste), sprinkle top of bread batter with chopped nuts of your choice and cinnamon/sugar mixture. I've also mixed craisins in the batter, too!

This was amazing!! I added slightly more spices and some pumpkin pie spice.  Everyone loved it!! I scaled it down to 2 loaves instead of 3...this made 1 loaf, 2 mini loaves, and 3 muffins.  Had no trouble with anything when scaling it down.  Thanks for the recipe!!

The best recipe.  I didn't plan ahead the first time I made this and only had 1 cup reg. sugar.  So I used that, the remaining 1 1/2c raw sugar I had on hand (ground fine in a coffee grinder), and 1/2 c honey.  Turned out wonderful.  Not sweet but very flavorful.  The second time, I followed the directions as-is (actually, the video) and it turned out wonderful.  Sweeter than my first attempt and a more subtle flavor, but still great.  So now I have 2 variations from 1 recipe!!

I was looking at my unused Halloween pumpkin and had to try and save a few dollars and actually use my pumpkin instead of just composting it. I pureed my pumpkin and added two teaspoons of vanilla. Also I used pumpkin pie spice instead of cloves, cinnamon and nutmeg...approx 4 to tsp. This turned out great. I like it and family loves it. Will make it again for sure.

Delicious! Made into muffins, halved the recipe & it still made almost 2 dozen muffins (25-30mn baking time). Added chocolate chips. Fantastic taste, although I might try substituting applesauce for the oil next time & cutting down on the sugar a bit, but it's delicious just the way it is as well :). Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

This will now be my favorite of all the pumpkin breads!  I made only half a recipe which resulted in two breads--one 9x5 and one 4x8.  The one change I made in the recipe was to use 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup oil instead of the 3/4 cup oil, and everything else was the same.  This was gobbled up by my family!

We absolutely loved this recipe! I did 1/3 batch (just to make 1 loaf) and it was delicious! We added about 1 cup chocolate chips and about 1/2-1 c. walnuts, which we really ended up liking. It added interest to the bread and made it more exciting. In the end we cooked it about 5 minutes longer than the time printed here. It was moist and super flavorful! I thought I wouldn't like the cloves in it, but I actually did!

Fantastic, it goes fast! Add chocolate chips. Only had whole cloves so I smashed them with a hammer in a ziploc bag (double bagged), used less then the recipe suggests and the taste is still great.

I was looking for a recipe for fresh bread and muffins. My pumpkin was too small so I reduced the recipe and made one loaf of bread and six giant muffins.  They are so good.  I had one at the major donut chain I get my coffee at and was so disappointing, so I bought the pumpkin and made these.  Just a great recipe from start to table.  Easy to prepare (esp. if you used canned pumpkin) leaves the house smelling FANTASTIC and great taste.  This recipe is EXACTLY what I was looking for.

Wow this recipe is wonderful!  3 people polished off entire batch in less than 3days.  I added a little ginger.  1/3 of batter I placed in large muffin tin with brown sugar crumble on top w/pecans.  Delicious-will definitely make again.

I have made this recipe several times and it is very good.  I add toasted walnuts as they stay crisper after being baked in the batter.  I also add chocolate chips sometimes.  I am thinking of maybe adding some cream cheese ...maybe but it does not need it.

I made this last night and it was outstanding. This was the most moist and delicious pumpkin bread I have ever had...and I can't believe I made it. I gave some to a neighbor who didn't try it in front of me, but he sent my husband a text telling him that he loves me because although he didn't know what pumpkin bread was before yesterday, he said it was amazing. I didn't add as much sugar as the recipe called for so it could have been a tad sweeter (to my husband and son) but I think it's perfect. I will definitely make this again, for my house and to give away.
One thing I would like to note is I made this for 24 servings and added a teaspoon and a half of vanilla extract, two teaspoons of cinnamon, instead of one and a teaspoon and a half of nutmeg instead of one. Without those additions, I don't think it would have been as good.

This is delicious, but I was expecting something bolder.  The flavor as it is written is very mild (I did add pumpkin pie spice instead of all three spices, but I don't think that would change it).  I think next time I would double the spices.

This bread was wonderful.  I've been asked by several friends to pass along the recipe.  I followed the suggestions of past reviews and substitued half applesauce for the oil and added nuts (will do even more next time).  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks for sharing.

This couldn't be easier and was really tasty! I made one loaf and 24 muffins.  The muffins are perfect for freezing or grabbing as an on-the-go snack...until you remember the recipe has 4 cups of sugar in it.

I really like this recipe. I use a little less oil and sugar and it is still amazing! I also use more like a tablespoon of cinnamon.

After reading the reviews I couldn't wait to eat the pumplin bread, but I was let down. Bread was good - but not great. Next time I will add nuts for sure, and do some more tweaking. I didn't use applesauce in the place of the oil - but it definitely would have made it better!

OK, this isn't bread, its un-frosted cake! SOOOO yummy! The first time I made it, I ran out of oil so I substituted butter. It was extremely decadent. This time, I tried using only 3 cups of sugar, and its still awesome. I asked my 5 y/o if it was as good as the first one, and he said, "even gooder" so you wont miss that extra cup. You could probably use even less, but don't skip the chocolate chips. Oh, and this time I used 1/2 bag chocolate chips, and 1/2 bag pecans.

This was very good.  I've had 2 people ask me for the recipe!  Next time I make it, I will definitely cut the oil at least in half and substitute applesauce for what I cut.  I ended up getting 2 loaves and 12 muffins out of the recipe.  The comment about using a 28 oz can of pumpkin puree is right on.  The rum soaked raisins are also a great addition!

FABULOUS!!  So easy to make and so delicious. I made 12 muffins with this recipe and only left out the cloves (because I didn't have any). They were done in 35 minutes and very moist & flavorful. I had many compliments on them! This recipe is a keeper! Thank you for sharing it.

Wow, this recipe was such a hit!  So incredibly moist and flavorful!!!  And SOOO simple to make! The only thing I did differently was to double the cinnamon.  I prefer healthier recipes (I am trying to eliminate white flour, sugar and canola/veg. oil), but once in a while it's nice to indulge in something as delicious as this, and the fact that it was so easy to whip together was a major bonus! Thank you for sharing this recipe!!!

I made this exactly as written and it turned out  beautifully. I added raisins and nuts to one loaf, (I loved it that way!) and left the others plain. This was perfect-just spicy enough, moist, and a wonderful crust. It makes 3 large loaves-which is a good thing in my house! Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this recipe just substituting the sugar for Splenda. I used the 3 loaf pans 9 x 5. It is really dry and tasteless. I think it uses too much flour. I won't use this recipe again!

WOW!  Very esay to make, and everyone that has tasted it has commented positively on the taste, and the moistness of it.  I normally make a mixture of loaves and muffins together.  One person was torn between her dislike of pumpkin, and her desire to eat more because it tasted so good.  Have made this many times.  The only change I make is to substitute some of the oil for a pureed apple.  Cut up, and cook one apple in mocrowave with water 30 seconds, puree it, then add oil to make the 1 1/2 cups that the recipe calls for.  Delish!

I subsituted applesauce for the oil.  I halved the recipe and used 2 8x4" pans, froze the leftover batter.  The 2 8x4 pans took 30 minutes to bake. Pretty awesome, especially with some butter soaked in!  Note - I used the exact amount of spices the recipe calls for - the pumpkin flavor come thru perfectly, and the spices were well balanced.

Delicious!!!!  Only made 1 loaf.  Came out fantastic.  Baked for 55minutes, but it probably could've used another 5-10 minutes.  I think next time I'm going to add a little more cinnamon and a little less nutmeg/cloves.  Otherwise, absolutely scrumptious!

Awesome recipe!!! I just made this last night and added raisins to 1/3 of the mix and made 2 loaves with raisins and 1 without.  Turned out great and very delicious and moist, not too dense, will definitely be saving this one!

Very tasty and easy to make.  It wasn't too sweet or pumkiny, so it was a great balance.  Also it was moist enough to eat alone but I love a bit of butter on pumpkin bread! I made one loaf of bread and used the rest of the batter to make muffins.  In a few of the muffins I added some chocolate chips which was great.

This recipe is AWESOME with fresh whole cranberries, orange zest and pecans! Nice change from the usual pecans or chocolate chips. :)

As recommended by another user replaced 1/2 oil w apple sauce and left out a cup of sugar. The loaves were still more than sweet enough. Also made some muffins which I baked for about 25 mins. Have kids of only put in 1 tsp of cloves and nutmeg to tone down the spice and I thought the loaf was still very flavorful.

Yummy, my house smells like fall and the muffins are so tasty.  I ended up making one loaf and 24 muffins, a little variety for my kids.  They just came out of the oven and my husband already gobbled down 2.  I did a little over-pour on all 3 spices and I think it turned out very good.

This recipe was very easy to make.  I baked the entire recipe at the same time. It took me 25 minutes to bake a dozen muffins and 55 minutes to bake two loaves.  The only change I made to the recipe was replace half the oil with unsweetened applesauce.  The bread was moist but I found the clove flavor too strong (will definitely cut back next time). It was also lacking something...perhaps vanilla?  My boyfriend said it tasted good which is always a good thing for me to hear.

So moist! Definitely add the whole can of pumpkin and sub half applesauce for half the oil. Also this bread was a little too mild for me so I did double the spices for the perfect flavor, yum! This morning I lightly toasted in the broiler a thin slice and topped with a sprinkling of cinamon and sugar! So good!

Want the same amazing flavor and consistency but with a whooooole lot less fat? Substitute 1 cup of the oil for a cup of unsweetened applesauce. (That's a trick I learned from others on this fab site.) No effect on the outcome except to reduce the calories by a monster factor. I found cook time to be an hour.  Absolutely delicious.  AMAZING consistency.  Just perfect.

UPDATE: I have been making this recipe for 7 years now. It is absolutely the best there is! I now use a 29 oz can of pumpkin and pumpkin pie spice in place of measuring out pumpkin and individual spices. I like it this way even more!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I did change a few things: I used 1.25 cups wheat flour, and 1/2 brown sugar 1/2 white.  I also only added 1/2 tsp cloves as I don't like an over powering clove flavor.  That being said they could have use slightly more cinn. and nutmeg.  Next time I would like to try applesauce in place of some of the oil.  Thanks for the recipe my 3yr old and I enjoyed these!

This was great! I only had cinnamon on hand so I didn't use the other spices, but it was still marvelous. I also put brown sugar on top before baking--it was a nice streusel-like topping.  It took quite awhile to bake, probably a little more than 60 minutes. I don't have a convection oven, though, so that could have been the issue.

Scrumptious.  Next time I will probably attempt cutting the oil in half and replacing with applesauce.

So very good!  I admit, I did substitute the oil for applesauce.  I don't usually do that, but I had some applesauce to use up.  It came out so moist!  My whole family loved this recipe.

I had to bake for 60 minutes, it was very runny in the center after 45 mins. I did one with walnuts= yummy. I think this is a LITTLE BIT dry, so next time I will try the applesauce instead of the oil. Great flavor though!

This is my go to pumpkin bread recipe!! I have made it probably four times in the past couple months. I always make the whole recipe because everyone loves it... I usually add half a bag of mini-chocolate chips for an added bonus and I always use applesauce instead of oil- you would never know! So good! Definitely try it!

This pumpkin bread is so yummy!  My 5 and 3 year old boys love it!  I used 2 cans of pumpkin (15 oz. I think) instead of measuring 3 cups.  It's very moist.  I didn't have any cloves in my spice cabinet and I never measure spices so I put a dash or two of cinnamon and a dash or two of pumpkin pie spice in.  Great recipe!  I planned on giving this as a gift so I used the foil loaf pans and got 3 loaves out of this.

I baked this last night and it is the best recipe.  I doubled the spices because I love them.  Thank you so much for sharing this.  This morning when I got up, my whole house smelled like Christmas spices.  So moist, and I LOVE that it makes a big batch.

What a difference a day makes!  I tried a slice immediately after the bread finished baking and wasn't that impressed with the taste.  After the pumpkin bread cooled overnight, I tried another slice.  WOW!  Great pumpkin bread.   Easy recipe to remember!

This is a good pumkin bread recipe. But I prefer one I found on the "Libby" site, which added cranberries and walnuts. This was a little to bland for me, but my husband liked it.

I love this recipe.  (Pumpkin bread is my favorite.)  I increased to 48 servings and just used my two 15 oz. cans of pumpkin.  I also reduced the oil to 1 1/2 cups.  Not too dense.  Added choc. chips.  I cooked 3 different sizes so just had to check with a toothpick every  once in a while for doneness and covered with foil if getting too done on top.  Perfect!!!!

This recipe was only so-so for me. I tried it twice, once with Fresh pumpkin, and once with fresh AND canned pumpkin.  It did NOT taste like pumpkin, I must say.  The first time I overdid the spices (my fault) and ended up with to much cloves. Second time though, I doubled the recipe and added both fresh and canned pumpkin.  Still had not a whole lot of pumpkin flavor. It tasted somewhat like Banana Bread, minus the Banana flavor. I will probably go back to using my mother's recipe for pumpkin bread, which was WAAAY better, and requires yeast. Only reason I didn't use that is it calls for yeast and I just didn't have the time this year to commit to a yeast recipe. I will MAKE the time from here on out!

I made this recipe to put in gift baskets for Christmas. I put it in 9 mini loaf pans, and instead of using plain pumpkin, I used pumpkin pie mix, and it turned out amazing.  My whole house smelled so good.  I wll be making this one part of Christmas tradtions.

First time making this  and it was wonderful.  Made it for my kids' teachers, but made a test loaf first!!  My kids loved it!!  I then made 2 more regular loaves out of that batch ( 3 loaves total).  Then I made another batch & got 7 mid-size loaves for the teachers!  I used a streusel topping like in the pic...but, my bread was much darker.  Don't think the pic is a good representation of the way the bread looks!!  But, the taste is FANTASTIC!!

Definite keeper!  I subbed 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce and cut back on the sugar by about 1/2 cup.  It made one large loaf, 6 mini loaves and 24 mini muffins.  SO easy, super moist and definitely delicious!  Can't wait to bring them to work tomorrow and also give out to neighbors!  Oh, and I would probably cut back on more of the oil and the sugar without missing it...once I sprinkle a little bit of confectioner's sugar on them, they'll be perfect!  Thanks for a fabulous recipe!

Great recipe!  I've made it multiple times and it always disappears fast!! I make it with applesauce instead of oil. Cut the sugar to 2 cups with 1/4 tsp of powdered Stevia.  I also add 1 tsp of powdered ginger.

This is my favorite fall (or anytime) recipe.  I sub 1/2 the oil for plain applesauce and leave off the cloves.  I've made it into muffins or used regular pans.  De-lish!!!

Three loaves was a bit much for this recipe... so I thought.  The first two loaves disappeared in two days with my family of four.  The third was frozen and will be for Thanksgiving morning.  We can't wait.

I added nuts and raisins to mine just because I like that and I substituted pumpkin pie spice for all the spices because I didn't have nutmeg.  This was excellent.

looked and smelled good in the oven but as soon as I let it cool it deflated to about half the size. Good flavor but I made the mistake of adding allspice which I think was not needed. either I screwed something up, or this pumpkin bread isn't all that everyone is raving about. I really had high hopes from reading all the other reviews, but it's not what I had in mind.

The recipe made way more than I expected so I took a loaf to work and gave another to my husband's single sailor buddies who don't get baked goods very often - it was such a hit!! It was moist, flavorful, and absolutely delicious! I keep getting harassed to make more. Added the whole can of pumpkin because I didn't want to toss a cup. Thanks for a recipe that's going to be in the family forever!

Great recipe! Made with applesauce instead of oil and used real pumpkin instead of canned pumpkin.  The smell was amazing and it tastes great.

I keep making, and it keeps disappearing. Even hiding a loaf or two in the freezer won't keep my kids from devouring this. So moist and soft and full of flavor. Thanks for sharing such a yummy recipe.

This bread smells wonderful in the oven, and looks beautiful when you pull it out.  It's super moist and flavorful.  I used unsweetened apple sauce instead of the oil, and it was delicious!

Excellent.  My house smelled wonderfully and I timed it so they came out of the oven as guests were arriving.  I had to cook it for about 75 minutes to get it to cook through.  I will definitely make it again.

This was my first pumpkin bread I've ever made and it turned out delicious. I'm allergic to eggs so I used the Ener-G egg replacer and the bread still turned out moist and fluffy. SOO good! (My friends even liked it a lot!) Also, I happened to only have 3 cups of sugar in the house so I used 1 cup of brown sugar. Still turned out great!

Tasty and easy! I made one 9x5 loaf and two 8x3's. The bread not only smells wonderful, but is super moist and not too sweet. The flavor is very mild and perfect with butter, or just plain (how my Mom prefers it). I plan to give these out as gifts, and was delighted with how they turned out. The only thing is I did end up baking them for around 75mins as other reviewers have stated. They came out perfect. Next time I'll try substituting the oil for applesauce!

This is a very good recipe. It is very moist and has a great flavor. I did use 1 c. of apple sauce. I also used 1 c. of Splenda. Think next time I  will use only apple sauce and no oil. I will also use 2 c. of Splenda and 2 c. of sugar. Will make again.

This is wonderful.  Made for grandchildren so substituted a cup of flour with whole wheat flour.  Ran out of sugar and used a cup of dark brown and it still came out heavenly.  I also put a handfull of chocolate chips in to entice the kids. I hope they don't like it so I can eat it all!

This bread is amazing! It is very moist, and the spices taste fantastic in it! I cut the recipe to make 2 loaves I did have to bake it a little longer than the time on the recipe..I'm not sure if it was because of my oven or not. I ended up cooking the two loaves for 1 hour and 15 minutes instead of the 45 mins-1 hour. This recipe is so simple and takes no time at all to make! Of the two loves, I brought one to a family get-together this weekend, everyone raved about how great it was! The other loaf I kept at home for my husband and roommates - I made the bread on Saturday morning, and the whole loaf, except for two pieces, had disappeared by Sunday evening! This would be a great item to bring to Thanksgiving dinner! I will definitely be making this pumpkin bread again this fall!

Delicious!  I'm not even a big fan of pumpkin desserts, but I do make them for my husband who loves anything and everything pumpkin.  I cut down the recipe to 12 servings and baked in an 8x8 square pan.  It was perfect.

I think I overdid the clove and nutmeg just a tad, but it's still amazing. I did add 4 cups of pumpkin because I'm just a huge fan of pumpkin and I thought the worst it could do to this bread was make it more moist. I was right! The bread turned out super moist with just a little bit of buttery crunch on top (I put butter on the outside as soon as I got it out of the oven). I can't wait to share this with my family!

This is definately the best pumpkin bread recipe ever!  I made it exactly the same as the recipe except I used unsweetened applesauce in place of the oil.  It turned out great and really moist.  Only thing about this recipe that I would say is innacurate is the baking time.  I baked mine for about 65 minutes.

Unbelievable! Easy to follow and amazing results. I received so many compliments. I did add mini chocolate chips and followed another's advice about upping the spices -- I added another 1/2 teaspoon of each -- and it was perfect! Thanks!

I used 1/4 cup oil and 3/4 cup applesauce and it turned out great! Very moist and fantastic with pecans!  I think next time I'll dust the pans with a mixture of pumpkin pie spice and sugar for an extra kick.

Absolutely delicious!! I didn't add the tablespoon of flour. I also did a version with splenda, 3 egg whites and half applesauce, half oil...good flavor, but definite splenda aftertaste. Didn't rise well either. Stick with the original...soooo goood!!

This recipe is awesome! Very easy to make and delicious. I left out the oil and instead used applesauce like another user suggested. I also used half white sugar, and half brown and added 1 cup chopped and roasted pecans. I made only 2 loaves and they were gone in 2 days. I only gave it 4 stars because I changed the original recipe. I am keeping this recipe. Well done!

This was my first time making bread from scratch and this was a fantastic recipe! Very easy and tasted delicious! I need need to leave it in the oven an extra 15-30 minutes than the recipe says. Overall, awesome and great for the fall! :) Will bake again next year.

Delicious!  Took ~75 minutes in the oven.  We wrapped it in plastic wrap and it kept for at least 3 days.  It was so tasty!  I loved it toasted with butter; supper, breakfast, any time.  We'll make it again!

Perfect! I upped the spices a little and added raisins to one loaf and left the others plain. DELICIOUS. I think it would be even better with walnuts. Great pumpkin flavor!

Great recipe! I substituted applesauce for some of the oil and used whole wheat flour for half of the flour, as well as added wheat germ to make it slightly more nutritious and sneak in some folic acid since I'm pregnant. It took a little longer than the recipe stated to cook, but turned out moist, delicious and picture perfect! Great recipe!

This is best when mini choc chips are added.  I use the muffin top tins, which make them easy to freeze and take out individually..

Moist and delicious. I used "no sugar added" applesauce instead of oil and reduced the sugar by one cup. Thanks for sharing this recipe Cheryl, we love it.

Excellent moist bread, especially when made a day ahead and refridgerated.  Took to church coffee hour and was asked by quite a few people for the recipe.  Did have to bake a little longer than the recommended time.  Will definately make again.

It was good. Not remarkable. Easy. Recipe makes a lot so I sliced it up and froze it in sandwich bags for the kids lunches. Included a tiny cup of cream cheese frosting to make it interesting at the lunch table. Tasty

great easy recipe. Mine took a little longer than I thought, maybe about 75mins. Very good though. I added about 1/2cup of raisins to it and it was great.

Wow!  I made half this recipe for muffins and it still made two dozen!  I also added walnuts and raisins, and substituted part of the flour with wheat germ and ground flax.  Very tasty and moist!  I will make this again.

This is a fantastic recipe.  I did make a few changes, but I am sure it is wonderful as is:  I used unsweetened apple sauce in place of the oil, and I also added an equal amount of Pumpkin Pie Spice in addition to the cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg.  I halved the recipe, and still used about 2 cups of pumpkin puree, and about 1/4 cup more flower to help balance out the extra puree.  I got two 4.5 x 8.5 loaves out of it, one plain and one I added raisins.  I baked them in glass loaf pans for a good hour.  They turned out wonderful!!  This is now my got-to pumpkin bread recipe.  I didn't find it too sweet, but next time I will try cutting back on the sugar as well.

Very good! I had to make some changes based on what I had & after reading other reviews. I used sugar-free applesauce in place of oil, used half splenda & half brown sugar splenda, used 1 540ml can of pumpkin pie filling (oops!) and made muffins & i loaf. They turned out super moist & after we topped them with a cream cheese icing, they only lasted 15 mins with my family of 6.

Wow this is awesome!  I used baby applesauce (finer texture) for half of the oil.  I think next time I'll only use mini loaf pans because I can't seem to get the timing right on a regular loaf pan...either too done or not done enough.  The mini ones come out perfect. A lot of sweet breads end up being too oily for me and this is just perfect, moist but not greasy feeling.

This recipe is really easy to do, and very very tasty!!! Everyone who ate this bread just raved about it!! I actually used more pumpkin puree than the recipe called for, I used 3 3/4 cups (the size of the can i had) and still it was delicious!!

I've made this twice. The first time it was the hit of our Christmas dinner! My boyfriend begged me to make it again! I followed the directions except I substituted pumpkin spice for the cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves. The second time I made it... I have to admit, I messed up. I didn't have the pumpkin spice and I only had cinnamon and cloves. So I made it without the nutmeg and forgot the salt! It wasn't as good... everyone could tell something was missing. I also used half oil and half apple sauce to make it a bit healthier. I'm not sure if it affected the taste also, but it definitely didn't affect the moisture, because it was still nice and moist.

I made this with frozen squash which was wonderful!  I cut the oil down 1/2 and added applesauce as suggested.  I also cut the sugar back which I don't think I'd do again.  We like it with butter (there goes the benefit of cutting back on the oil) for breakfast.

I am not really a great baker, I tried this receipe and followed it to the T, it was fantastic.  I have very fussy 4 year old but she loved this and asks for it all the time.  I used fresh pumpkin which I boiled and cooled down.  I make this at least 3 times a month and its gone with a day

I actually overcooked the 2 loaves I made and found something very interesting. The first loaf we ate was dry and over-cooked tasting. The second loaf I wrapped and stuck in the refrigerator for about 2 weeks. When I finally took it out to see if it was edible or if I should throw it away - it was delicious! Something about sitting made everything as moist and delicious as it should have been. Any bread that springs back from a mistake like that is a winner in my book!

Really great flavor!  I baked over an hour because it didn't seem quite done in the very center, but then I remembered most reviews said it would be moist.  I added a powdered sugar glaze over the top.  Everyone loved it!

This bread was OUTSTANDING and made 3 large loafs as indicated.  I used 2 whole small cans of pumpkin which was slightly more than the recipe called for but it did not make any difference.  I added spices as indicated and then added 1 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice for extra zing as I like allot of spice.  Baked for 55 min and came out perfect. Gave a loaf to my elderly mother and she LOVED it.  Will make again for sure.

This bread comes out great EVERY TIME.  I increase the spices for a more flavorful version.  Texture, moisture, density are balanced.  I tell my kids it is "Cinnamon Bread" - they love it; a good way to get healthful pumpkin.  I have also used my own pumkin puree, also came out wonderful.

Easy to make and very moist!  I couldn't help but add chocolate chips and chopped pecans to the loaves.  I might try cranberries next Thanksgiving.

I followed the recipe exactly, and the bread was almost perfect.  The only complaint I have is the bread was too sweet, and I think it was just me because the others who tried it disagreed.  I will make this recipe again, but cut down a tad bit on the sugar.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great.  Next time I might try a few subs to make it healthier for the family, but a very tasty recipe. Gave it as bread and muffins to the neighbors for Christmas. **muffins baked at approx 19 min, maybe 1 or 2 longer, not sure!

SOOOO GOOD!  As another reviewer suggested, I added a topping of walnuts and sugar (I just pulsed them together in a magic bullet until it looked like coarse crumbs) and it took this recipe from good to unbelievable!  I was proud to give some to the neighbors for a Christmas treat!

Fantastic! I cut this recipe in half and used 4 mini loaf pans.  Cooked just about 40 min and they were perfect.  Taste GREAT!  This recipe will be used again and again and again!

This recipe is so good!  Everyone loved it, even my husband who isn't a huge pumpkin fan!  I am going to try it with applesauce to lighten it up a little next time though!  Thank you, this will be a holiday staple in my home from now on!

I had some leftover pumpkin to use at Thanksgiving and searched for something else to make with it.  I came across this recipe and after reading the ratings decided to try it. The only negative thing I can say is that I only had enough to make a third of the recipe which made three mini loaves.  They were gone in one day. This recipe was amazing! The flavor was so smooth. We spread some cream cheese on the slices and my family could not stop raving about it.  I already bought another can of pumpkin so I can make it again.  This is certainly not a recipe to save just for Thanksgiving!

I just made this exactly as the directions stated for 1 loaf, then with 12 muffins, the 3rd loaf I added pecans (cookie piece size) They are all so delicious with butter and a glass of milk. My house smells wonderful! You will love this recipe so go ahead and make it.

I tried my hand at several new dishes this Thanksgiving, and this pumpkin bread by far received the most rave reviews. I brought it to 2 separate Thanksgiving dinners, and EVERYONE loved it! It was so moist and delicious. Thanks for a great recipe!

I really love this recipe!  I will use this recipe always when I am in the mood for pumpkin bread.  I did double the spices, because I read other reviews that advised the additional spice.  I also added a cup of raisins and a 1/2 cup of rum.  Yummy!!!

Excellent! I did not make any changes to the recipe itself.  However, I did not want to make such a big batch the first time so I change the quantity to make 1 loaf instead of 3 and it still came out perfectly.  I'll be making a full size batch tonight to bring to work.  Highly recommend this.

I've made this a few times now and everyone who tries it absolutely raves about it, myself included.  Just fantastic out of the oven, and tastes great if you can manage to not eat it all the first day (probably a good idea since the sugar amount alone tops 3000 calories).

Very Good Bread! This is the first time I have ever made bread and I will make this every holiday now. I did sub some oil for applesauce. I used 1 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup oil and I couldnt tell the difference. Great Recipe!

Great Recipe!  I made it using cupcake tins.  They worked out great, they were done in about 28 min.  Very moist and delicious!  I sprinkled powdered sugar on them.  I think next time I will try to use some applesauce in place of some of the oil.  Will make again!

This is wonderful. Only change I made was to do 3/4 cup applesauce and 3/4 cup vegetable oil. Everyone at work loved it. I will make it again and maybe add more applesauce and even less oil to see how that will be.

Greatest.  Pumpkin.  Bread.  EVER.

I made this at the request of a coworker who was bummed because the Starbucks kept running out of Pumpkin Bread before she could get some.  LOL.  I made her her own loaf and she carried around the loaf pan and a fork everywhere she went for about 3 days until she ate it all.  I baked it as is, and wouldn't change a thing.

Smells and tastes heavenly!  I have made this several times and I follow the recipe exactly, with no substitutions.  Every once in awhile, I'll stir a handful of raisins or nuts into one loaf pan for myself, since my husband prefers his "plain".  I have never been disappointed in the results.  If you want to stir in a little something extra, I highly recommend dried cranberries and chopped almonds.  Yum!

This recipe is great!!!!  It makes three big loaves, but I have to keep making more because they keep disappearing!  (Probably because they make such great gifts.)  Also, my four-year-old refers to this as "the yummy bread" ;-)

Just made this with a few changes (I never follow a recipe 100%. I only made 1/2 of the batch (18 muffins). I had cooked pumpkin in the fridge so used almost 2 cups of that instead of canned pumpkin. I used about 1/4 cup canola oil and 1/4 olive oil and 1/4 cup cooked peaches (cooked without sugar). I put the oils with peaches into smaller blender and mixed thoughly. Instead of 2 cups of sugar I used 1 cup splenda and 1/2 white sugar. Instead of using all flour I took large oatmeal flakes and put them into the food processor and made into oat flour (bit courser the flour) and used 1 1/3 cups of that with 1 cup all-purpose flour. Used all the spices as if I was making a full recipe and also throw in about 1/2 tsp cardamon. These came out light and fuffly and as I seen in one review served with cool-whip which I happened to have thawed and in the fridge. These are really good and think I will make some more and bring to work to treat everybody.

This is amazing bread! I've been in a pumpkin mood lately and have been searching for as many recipes that use pumpkin puree as possible. This one is a keeper! I love how with applesauce there is very little fat and it is super moist! Instead of the reccommended amount of flour, I used about half whole wheat flour and half whole wheat oats, then a few tablespoons of flax seed. It has a wonderful texture, and with dried cranberries and chopped walnuts, there are little flavor bursts throughout. I'll definitely be making this again - especially as gifts for the holiday season

Made 1/2 of this recipe exactly as written.  It made one large loaf and some small muffins.  Took the loaf to work for some meetings where it was a big hit.  Loved by some for the spiciness and by some for the moistness.

It was very moist, I used applesauce instead of the oil. The reason for the 3 stars is, that was all I could taste was the cloves. I will try this recipe again but without the cloves.

Huge hit in my house!  Everyone loved it!  I used 1/2 the batter to make bread and 1/2 to make muffins.  I added chocolate chips to the muffins.  Yum!  I topped the bread with a sugar glaze rather than powdered suger.  Excellant!

Followed recipe exactly with the exception of using fresh cooked pumpkin instead of canned.  I'm sure it would be good w/canned as well.  This bread held together nicely when sliced.  I just hate it when quick bread crumbles when you slice it!  The family loved the first loaf and I froze the rest.  Looking forward to making another batch!

I also added a very simple cream cheese frosting. It added a boost of sweetness!

This bread was tasty and very good!  I followed it pretty much to a tee the only thing I changed and I thought that it was hit was I shifted cinnamon and sugar on the top when it first came out of the oven and it was just a nice touch.
Thanks .....

I made this recipe today and it was fantastic!  I used freshly roasted and pureed pumpkin instead of canned and I only had four eggs so I used 2TB applesauce for each of the two remaining eggs.  Otherwise I followed the recipe and it turned out great even at our high altitude.

This is really good. I made three 9x5 loaves like the recipe said and dusted them with powdered sugar. Everyone that tried it really liked it. But I did have to bake about over an hour, probably more like 1h15m or else the top middle was still gooey.

I give it 4 stars only because it didn't really "wow" me. It was good, everyone that tried it thought it was good, I even gave one loaf away as a gift, so it turns out well, but it jut wasn't as exciting as I had hoped.

Delicious!  I was a little hesitant to make this because it sounded like it called for large quantities of everything (which it did) but I'm glad I tried it.  I used half whole wheat flour and half regular flour and it still turned out fine.  This is a great recipe to make and give as gifts.  I will definitely make this again!

Wow!!! This was delicious! It seemed like a lot of sugar, so I decreased it a little, and also skimped on the oil. I halved the recipe and made muffins with it. This is a great recipe!! They were soft and moist. I added chocolate chips to some, and sprinkled chopped pecans on another. Delish!!!

Thanks so much for sharing this recipe. After testing several Pumpkin Bread recipes, this one was declared the "best" by my family. It's requested for school treats, is a favorite for breakfast on the go, and always receives rave reviews. Kids and teens love it! I couldn't even begin to count how many times I've made it over the past five months...

It was good, but didn't have the as much pumpkin flavor as I would have liked.  Next time I'll try adjusting the amount of pumpkin for more flavor.

This is a wonderful easy recipe just as written!  I just used 2 cans for the full recipe instead of measuring.  Everyone at our family gatherings loves this. I find it takes the whole hour to cook.

I made this in two separate batches, one with sugar and one batch with Splenda (white and brown). I made mini-loaves. Both batches turned out fine.
However, the batch made with real sugar was moister than the sugar-free batch.
But then again, the sugar-free batch was better as a quick "bread" in comparison to the sweeter sugar version, which was more like a dessert cake.
I also added different add-ins to each little loaf. I tried dried cranberries, whole flax seed, hazelnuts, chocolate chips, and all the loaves came out great. 
Great recipe...so versatile.

delicious and accommodates alterations nicely. used part whole wheat flour (1/3) and part applesauce for oil (1/4) and bread was still very moist and flavorful.

Who knew such an easy to assemble recipe could turn out so good?  I scaled down the recipe to make one loaf and it was beautiful and moist.  I'll rate five stars because it IS a nice bread, but personally, I like more spices.  I've also made this with pureed acorn squash (hey, it was in the freezer!) and it was equally as good.  Many people will be receiving a loaf of this tasty treat for the holidays this year and for years to come.

This was the first time I've ever made or eaten Pumpkin Bread.  The aroma was delightful while it was baking, and the bread was super moist and tasty.  Very easy to make.  This will definitely be on my list of goodies to send to family this holiday season.

The Pumpkin bread came out perfect. Very moist and full of flavor. I roasted a pumpkin for this and added walnuts and lots of raisins. Very good bread. Will use as my standard for pumpkin bread every year.

This bread recipe is an awesome addition to my Thanksgiving feast! Thanks so much! I did make the full batch, and I also added a cream cheese ribbon from another recipe because I was not going to freeze them. I gave out loaves that we didn't eat to my guests as they left my house the night of our Thanksgiving Feast.

I have been making this recipe for the last 2 years, and I get so many compliments - the only thing different that I do is add about 1/2 - 1 bag chocolate chips to the batter, and omit nuts as I like it better that way! Great quick and easy bread to make for the Holidays!

This bread was awesome and delicious for me, for my friends and their friends. They cannot believe that it was homemade until they took that very first taste. This type is even better for the Fall season. I have make some for other people so they can have it especially the same week of Thanksgiving Day.

My husband and I love this pumpkin bread! I cut the recipe in half since it's just the two of us eating it but I am thinking of making it again for Christmas and sending it as gifts. It's really moist and made the whole kitchen smell wonderful. Tastes great with a cold glass of milk. Thanks!

I made this recipe without any modifications and it came out perfect.  Although I did scale it back to one loaf and baked it for an hour which worked out pretty well.  Will definitely make this recipe over and over again, only next time I will make all three loaves.

I didn't need or want three full size loaves, so I made 1/3 of the recipe. I thought it called for too much ground cloves so I cut them by half, but still, the fragrance was overpowering (but fortunately didn't taste that way). I also added some ground ginger. The flavor and texture of this bread was wonderful - smooth and very moist. I'm giving it four stars only because of the amount of cloves called for, and having to scale the recipe down. But I'll definitely make it again.

Great recipe.  I used fresh pumpkin (cooked like a squash) added 3/4 cup of raisins and baked it in 9" cake pans rather than loafs.  Cooks quicker (35-45 mins)and looks great with cream cheese frosting that has some red and yellow food coloring added to make a orange color.

We love this bread! I changed it up a bit by halving the recipe and using 1 1/2 c brown sugar instead of white sugar. It made the bread moist and good compared to the first batch I made w/Splenda. I also added some sliced almonds and white chocolate chips.....soo yummy. I didn't have nutmeg on-hand so I just doubled up my cinnamon. My husband took some of the bread to work and everyone loved it there too! I will definately keep this recipe and make it a few times over the holidays!!

I really should have waited to bake this since I was out of half the stuff, but what I did worked great.  I didn't have the right amt of pumpkin, so I finished off with 2 cups of pumpkin and about 1 cup of applesauce.  I was out of cloves so instead of the individual spices, I put in the same amount of pumpkin pie spice and instead of all white sugar, I had half sugar and 1/2 Splenda.  This was a GREAT mix, though.

Simply awesome.  Very rich and delicious.  We ate it for breakfast, for dessert, for snack and a little with a ginger smothered fish dish we had.  The 3 loaves just weren't enough.

First know I am a pumpkin loaf fanatic, I eat it all year round. My faviort has always been from Starbucks.  I decided tor try this recipe b/c of all the great reviews. I downsized the serving to just test out the recipe.  Instead of a loaf I made them as muffins.  Didn't care for them to much. They were just ok, needed more of a pumpkin flavor.

This recipe was a big hit with my co-workers.  I added the extra pumpkin puree left in the can and a little extra flour.  I sifted the flour and ground whole clove in my coffee grinder.  This recipe made 2 loaves and about 9 muffins.  It's definitely worth a try.

Absolutely Delicious. Very moist and soft.  Not too sweet. I cut down on the sugar by 1/2 cup and I made them into muffins for my daughter so she can take them to school for breakfast. A keeper.

This is the best Pumpkin Bread. I made a double recipe, so I could give all my family a load to take home after Thanksgiving dinner.  Everyone in my family loved the bread. My son and Grandson told me to please make again for Christmas.  I will add nuts & raisins this time and see how it is.

While this pumpkin bread was good and is getting rave reviews...I found it light on the spice flavor so I docked it a star for that.  It almost seemed to not have any cinnamon or nutmeg in it, so my recommendation would be to up those measurements and this bread will be perfect.  Also, I used fresh pumpkin and it worked out well. (and really don't think that would have made any taste difference on the lack of spice flavor.)  Thanks, I'll keep this recipe.

Wonderful Recipe!  I made about 6 dozen muffins and my 3 year old ate about 1/2 a dozen already!  The last batch I added in chocolate chips and they tasted great, too.  I didn't have cloves but had ginger...nice flavor.  Will be making again for the Christmas Holidays.

This was very good.  First pumpkin bread I've ever made.  Next time I think I will add more spices as some others suggested to give it a bit more flavor.  Was definately better the second day.

Delicious!  Very moist.  It was a huge hit.  I topped it off with some icing - confections sugar with a small amount of milk.  I was expecting more pumpkin flavor.  I will add pumkin spice next time.

I have been making this same recipe for years (ever since I found it here on Allrecipes) and it is our favorite- hands down! Try freezing it after it has cooled down a bit and then eating it in a few days. After it's been frozen and thawed it's even more amazing.

VERY YUMMY. Make entire recipe because it doesn't matter how few people are eating it...they will eat it all!  I made a single loaf because I wanted to ensure I knew what I was doing and didn't want 3 messed up loaves, but it's pretty hard to mess this one up.  Will make more and add nuts, chocolate or raisins next time!

A very simple, easy, basic recipe.  I like that it makes a lot!  I made this bread to use in Ibby's Pumpkin Mushroom Stuffing from this site and it was perfect.  I made one loaf pan and one 8x8 pan.

This was not the greatest, but that could have been of my own doing. I cut the recipe back to 1/3 of its original because I couldn't imagine what I would do with three whole loaves.  Furthermore, I made it bundt style.  What resulted was a dense, heavy, overly  moist bread that was teeming with spices and lacking in pumpkin flavor.  I'd swear I followed the recipe (conversions and all), but I'm open to the idea that maybe the ingredients form a different flavor when the entire recipe is made.

Definately not the best.  The spices were off, too much clove and not enough cinnamon. Other wise the consistency and everything was good.  Next time I will swithc it around a bit or try a different recipe.

Awesome pumpkin bread, I am sold!  I took the advice of others and used half applesauce in place of oil.  Next time I will try all applesauce.

I didn't have nutmeg so I used some ginger in place.  I took the advice of others and cut back on cloves and added more cinnamon.  

Didn't have whole wheat but i will try it next time.

I'm going to bring these into work tomorrow and share, thanks for the great recipe!

My friends and family loved this pumpkin bread!  I substituted 1 1/2t. of Pumpkin Pie Spice for the 3 individual spices, and also added 1 cup chopped walnuts too. It came out moist and flavorful!  Delicious plain or topped with a bit of cream cheese or butter or better yet, whipped cream!  This recipe is a keeper!

This is a good recipe. The bread is dense and sweet. However, in my opinion it could use more pumpkin flavor and definitely needs more spices.

Very good.  I thought it was going to be too much for my kitchen aid mixer, as when I started adding the flour, it got bigger and bigger in my mixer, but I was able to contain it all. 
My first two loaves (I only had two loaf pans) took much longer than 1 hour to cook through, but the second pan took only about an hour.  I may have overfilled the first two pans, though.
I froze two of the loaves and have already polished off the third.  Thank you for sharing!

This is my first time tasting pumpkin bread, let alone making it!  I was very skeptical at first, but would give it SIX stars if I could!  I made enough for 24ppl, but only had one can of pumpkin which is about 1-3/4 cup instead of 2.  It was deeelicious!!  I also sizzled honey on top as soon as they came out of the oven.

yummmm...will make again!

Mmmm...this-was-heavenly!! Rich, yummy pumpkin pie reincarnated in bread form. I will most definitely make this again. I cut the recipe in half and baked the bread in two mini-sized loaf pans and a regular. Yum. Great gift also.

SO SO SO GOOD!  This bread really needs to be made a few days ahead of time and wrapped in foil.  The flavors really develop and it gets soooo moist after a couple days.  I did use 3 tablespoons of pumpkin pie spice instead of all the seasonings.  Served with cream cheese frosting off this site- The BEST!!!!!!

this recipe is wonderful!  not too spicy, and really moist.  :)  i used fresh pumpkin instead of canned; i cut the pumpkin up, de-seeded, steamed and then blended it up.  i managed to bake this in a toaster oven, so no excuses about it being to difficult!  Thanks much for adding in the celcius baking temperature as well.

PERFECT! This is THE best pumpkin bread recipe I've ever used! And the only one I'll be using from now on! I did not change the ingredients at all, and it was great! The only thing I did differently was to cut the recipe in thirds because I only have 4 mini loaf pans and wanted to make that size. It worked great! Made 4 batches that way and every one was perfect!

I loved this!!  I have made it two different ways. The way the recipe is presented with mini chocolate chips added. Fantastic. The other way was my attempt at a lower calorie version. I used Splenda instead of white sugar, applesauce instead of oil and Egg Beaters instead of eggs. I baked the bread in a mini loaf pan (as I remember, I had to adjust the baking time to less time, but I don't remember by how much). I froze what we weren't going to be eating, and they were still yummy when thawed out. My lower calorie version was a touch drier than the original recipe, but not by much. Good stuff!!

This bread is awesome! I like adding dried cranberries for a festive flair around the holidays. It pairs nicely when served with apple cider, too. My whole congregation LOVED this bread.

I took the advice of another review and substituted pumpkin pie spice for the other spices.  It was very bland.  Next time I try this, I won't make any substitutions.

This is the best pumpkin recipe I've ever made.  The taste is great and the bread bakes just right.  I have used both glass and metal loaf pans with equally excellent results.  I also used fresh pumpkin leftover from Halloween, just be sure to cook it a bit first to reduce some of the moisture, then puree it in a blender or food processor.  I always give some away and get HUGE smiles in return. YUMMY!

Wonderful recipe! I make this every Thanksgiving and get high praise every time; it's becoming a tradition! In fact, this last Thanksgiving I wasn't able to make it and it was sorely missed, some almost teared up! I've noticed that the people who don't like this recipe used the mini loaf pans, so I would suggest not making it that way.

Followed the recipe exactly...delicious and my co-workers loved it. Moist and just enough spice.  
My daughter doesn't like any kind of "breads" but absolutely loves this...her schoolmates love it too.  I made 2 batches so far and the second batch I added walnuts...so good.  I baked some in jars for gift giving..got that idea from allrecipes too (banana nut bread in a jar).  I just can't get enough of this bread and I just can't stop raving about it...thank-you for a wonderfully easy and delicious treat.

I really didn't care for this recipe too much. I followed it as stated. I chose to make 8 mini loaves, but I didn't like the texture, maybe too much oil. I will try another recipe next time.

This is quite simply the very best recipe for pumpkin bread ever.  So moist and the aroma is wonderful!  I am so glad to finally have a recipe that the family asks for over and over again!  I always sprinkle a bit of sugar on these before I bake.  Yum!  Other than that I suggest you follow the recipe exactly!  It doesn't get any better than this folks!

I had some leftover dried cranberries and white choc. chips and other hangers-on from cookie bakes so decided to throw them together in this pumpkin bread.  this is equally as good as the downeast maine pumpkin bread recipe on allrecipes.  I used the rest of my white choc chips, dried cranberries, pecans, a few raisins, and a few mini choc. chips to add to this recipe.  The breads looked like a picture and so festive with the red and white specks within.  The only advice I have is to use the biggest mixing bowl you have.  My favorite bowl is a heavy stainless steel bowl that came with an old mixmaster stand mixer and it was near the top!  next time I'll use a bigger bowl.  I did double up on the spices and added allspice instead of the ground cloves(didn't have any).  It made 2 8x5 loaves, and 3 minis.  Oh yes, if u haven't tried the white choc. cranberry cookies on here...please do...they are scrumptious!

Awesome bread!!!  I need more loaf pans.  I cut the recipe in half and put it all in one regular sized pan...not a good idea! Definitely use the rest for muffins next time.

I added chocolate chips and more cinnamon. I also ended up using all spice since I didn't have nutmeg and that turned out just fine! Great bread, super yummy and so easy!

WONDERFUL!!!  I cut the recipe in half and made mini loafs.  They turned out great.  Very moist.  The only change I made was used 2 1/2 tea of pumpkin pie spice instead of cinn, cloves and nutmeg.  Had alot of flavor.  My husband hate anything pumpkin and he liked this.  Will keep this recipe.  I bet this would be good with cream cheese frosting, maybe I'll try it next time!

I have been using this recipe for over 5 years now and it is an absolute hit each and every time! It has become a fall tradition of mine and I am always asked to bring some for Thanksgiving. Everyone looks forward to it! My only twist to the recipe: I use a little more pumpkin than the recipe calls for (approx 30oz) and I top it with a cream cheese frosting. Yummy!

This turns out quite a bit of bread and is always a hit around my house.  I tend to add a little more of the spices than it calls for as we love the flavors.

Wow- what a wonderful recipe!  We baked 2 loaves and made a dozen and half muffins and it was a huge hit!  My daughter's preschool class loved it.  I added cream cheese frosting to the loaves which gave it a little more sweetness and more options for presentation.  Thanks Cheryl- we will be doing this one again and again!

This recipe was fantastic!!! Just what Cheryl said! Big hit at my daughter's Thanksgiving party at her school. The other parents wanted the recipe!!! I cut the recipe to 24 servings, used 1/3 cup less sugar and omitted the cloves. (didn't have any to put in)! Recipe made 24 mini muffins and one loaf. GREAT!! Will become a Thanksgiving tradition at my house!

this was my first time making pumpkin bread and i was quite pleased with the results. LOVELY, LOVELY texture, not as tall as i thought it would be. i might double the recipe next time and make three loaves with that. a handful of pecans and raisins would be nice too. definately a keeper!!!

Wow!  Absolutely fabulous!  This is a great recipe.  My children loved it.  I made 2 loaves of bread and a dozen muffins!  I also used whole wheat flour instead of white.

I made this using 2 cups of granulated sugar and 2 cups of brown sugar as suggested by other reviewers.  It was very good, however, I still thought that something was missing but I'm not quite sure what that "something" was.  I baked them in some really super cute wooden baking baskets from Panibois (picked up from Crate & Barrel last year) and gave a few away as gifts.  I also added a streusel topping to half of the loaves.  I liked the loaves much better with the streusel than without.  That being said, I think that next time I will add a couple of tablespoons of molasses to see if that adds some depth to the flavor.

This was so good! I used the less calorie version and if I didn't tell people, they didn't know.  They think it's wonderful.  I will surely make this often.  Thanks for the keeper.

I have made this recipe each fall for the past 2-3 years.  It is always a hit with my family and those that I share my loaves with.  I modify a bit by using fresh pumpkin puree and part white flour and part fresh ground whole wheat.  This year alone I had three individuals request the recipe.

Very good recipe.  I used 6 tsp. pumpkin pie spice instead of the spices listed.  I also used 2 cups splenda, 1 cup sugar, 1 cup brown sugar, 1 cup canola oil and 1/2 cup melted butter instead of the 4 cups sugar and 1 1/2 cups oil.

This is a perfect pumpkin bread recipe!  It was really easy to prepare, smelled heavenly while in the oven, and the finished product not only tastes fantastic but is pretty as well.  It's wonderfully moist without being greasy or too heavy.  I scaled down the recipe to make two loaves instead of three, and I made one plain, and added 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips to the batter for the other.  This bread has a place on my Thanksgiving table.  Definitely a keeper!

i used hints from other recipes and used 2tbsp light margarine, 3 tbsp applesauce. i used the splenda/sugar combo in place of regular white sugar, one egg and one egg white, and used extra spices which was the key, i think, because the whole cake tasted like ginger snaps, which are my favorite! i would definitely recommend using less eggs for more moisture, cut the fat, and add spices adn chocolate chips.

Excellent!!  I did some of the changes like some ofthe others did.  Half eggs and half egg beaters, half oil and half applesauce and half white and brown sugar.  I didn't have enough pumpkin so I used canned squash with it and just added some pumpkin pie spice with the rest of the spices.  So moist and yummy!!!

I just made this a few days ago and it was absolutely delicious. Two of the three loaves have gone and there is no way the third is being gifted away! Easy to make and just so light and moist to eat, especially the top. Definitely a repeat recipe in our house.

WOW!  This was wonderful! It's extremely easy, fragrant and moist.  I followed the recommendations of others and used 1/2 applesauce with the oil and half whole wheat flour with the all-purpose.  I didn't have any mix ins, so I will add those next time.  I can only imagine how great this will be with pecans and raisins.  I made the recipe for 2 loaves, and it will be something we make over and over again!

I made this great recipe and gave one loaf to my sons teacher.  She loved it and told me the next time I want to pick up my son, there had better be more pumpkin bread.  Wow!  That is a great compliment.  Thanks for the recipe Cheryl.

This turned out okay, it wasn't the greatest though.  I cut the sugar by a cup and added alot more spice.  Even so, it didn't have much of that pumpkiny flavor that I love.  Will continue to look for one.

You know a recipe is good when you bring it to work, and someone gives comes and gives you a hug for bringing it!  I was low on white sugar so I used half white and half brown.  Came out great.

This has become my favorite pumpkin bread recipe.  I've made it several times and every time I make it, my kids yell, PUMPKIN BREAD, YUM!!!  It's easy to mix up and stays so nice and moist, even for leftovers the next day, which hardly ever happens!

I thought this was ok, it's one of those dense breads.  I prefer the maine pumpkin bread to this, much fluffier.

This is a great recipe.  I used this recipes the very first time I ever baked bread.  It was wonderful.  I added walnuts, raisins and a simple glaze.  After my extended family ate it around Thanksgiving, I am asked to bake it all the time.  You can use mini loaf pans as well!

AWESOME.  I found this recipe right before Christmas and have made several loaves of it to share.  My only regret is that I didn't have more bread pans to make is easier to make more at once!  This is going to be a holiday favorite in my family.  Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful recipe!

This is the best pumpkin bread I have ever made.  I enjoyed making so many loaves (didn't waste any of the large can of pumpkin) because it freezes really well and can pull out a loaf for company.

I'm very impressed with this recipe.  I made it for my finicky family and they loved it.  I did add some walnuts.  Because it was such a large amount (I'm not complaining, believe me) I took some to work and received many raves.  Will definitely be making this again in the future.

Yummy!  This is the best pumpkin bread I've made yet.  The only change I made was to increase the pumpkin, and the only reason I did that is because the large can of pumpkin yields 3 1/2 cups - I couldn't see wasting that measly 1/2 cup.  These breads turned out so moist and delicious that I'm giving mini loaves out for the holidays!  Definitely a recipe that will be made again and again.

This is great! I didn't have any cloves, and i added a few drops of vanilla and a pinch of ginger.  I made 2 loaves and some mini-muffins.  Turned out lovely!  Only problem - it wasn't as moist as I like.

We have made lots of pumpkin breads, but this one is our favorite.  I sprinkle demerara sugar on top of the batter and it gets crunchy while it bakes.  That's the only change we make.  This is an autumnal staple at our house, our revolving door of company loves it too!

I really liked this recipe. The only thing I changed was I added a little more pumpkin(1/2c,because it was the whole can). It was very good.

I've made a variation of this recipe several times and always get great compliments. I cut back on the cloves but add pumplin pie spice and increase the cinnamon since I like other reviewers like it spicier. I make it healthier and I think moister be replacing most of the oil with applesauce. Splenda works fine for half the sugar also. I add walnuts to the whole batch and then in each loaf pan I add chocolate chips or Orange flavored Craisins (dried cranberries).

I dson't think I'll make this again.  It was way too dry...too much flour, perhaps?  I thought 4 and 3/4 cups seemed like a lot.  It was also short on pumpkin flavor and spices.  I even added 1/4 teaspoon of my "Secret Pumpkin Spice" and I still felt it was a little bland.  It also took about 10-15 minute longer to bake than the recipe suggested.

So far, this is my favorite pumpkin bread recipe.  Medium spice, very moist.  I added fresh cranberries for contrast and nuts for texture. Definitely a keeper.

Excellent.  I love pumpkin bread right from the oven with some butter.  I used freshly pureed pumpkin.  I have so much pumpkin, I have made bread twice in the last four days (3 large loaves and 24 mini loaves).  The mini loaves baked for only 20 minutes.  I will be giving them away as gifts in my holiday baked goods boxes.  Thanks so much for sharing.

This was the first pumpkin bread I have ever made and the first pumpkin bread I have ever eaten, and it was really good. The recipe makes A LOT. I made two loaves and some muffins, and it all turned out really well. I served it at the holiday potluck at work, and everybody liked it.

Excellent.  Moist and delicious.  I added about a cup of raisins and chopped pecans.  I took this bread to work and my co workers loved it even a co worker that doesn't like pumpkin.  She said it reminded her of zucchini bread.  Another keeper!

I have never made pumpkin bread before so I decided to try this recipe. It turned out fantastic!  I made four small loaves of bread for at home and made six Texas-sized muffins to take to work and share with my co-workers.  They were really impressed with how wonderful they tasted.I chopped up some walnuts and added them to it also.  I would recommend this one to everyone!  I plan on making some more bread and freezing it for the holidays! Thanks so much for making the recipe available to me!

Great recipe!! My husband and 2 year old loved it. Easy to make and it goes fast. I did have a problem getting the center cooked all the way through. Next time I am going to try to reduce the amount of sugar and use some brown sugar also.

This recipe was very good, but the middle of the bread never fully cooked for me.  I even cooked it 10 more min but the middle still seemed raw.  Otherwise it was tasty though.

This is an awesome recipe.  Does an awesome job blending the pumpkin flavor into a sweet bread.  Kids love it too. Especially with added chocolate chips or raisins, although I prefer plain.

This is the first and only pumpkin bread that I have ever eaten.  But I'm 26 weeks pregnant and got a craving for it.  Made the recipe exactly as it is written.  It's very good and my husband (who's had lots of pumpkin bread before) also really, really likes it.  Next time I would use more cinnamon and possibly a little less cloves.  Raisins would be a must in the next batch.  Pretty sure that I will be making this again.

Great recipe. This sounds exactly a recipe I have except the ingredients are tripled. The only difference I make is I add quite a bit more pumpkin pie spice for  more flavor. Everyone eats this up everytime. It is hardly completely cooled before it has been devoured.

This is a good recipe. It was moist, but it didn't pack the flavor of other pumpkin bread I've had.

This was very tasty bread, and everyone I offered it to gobbled it up.  However, the time and temperature seemed a bit off.  The middle of my bread didn't get quite done, and the edges were a little overdone.  My oven bakes a little warm, so if I make this again I'll try turning the temp down a bit.
