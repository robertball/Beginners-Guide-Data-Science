A little too crumbly and dry for my tastes.  It really just wouldn't hold together... it broke into a million pieces just trying to get it out of the pan.  However, it tasted pretty good.

I served this recipe today with barbeque chicken and potato salad, it went over very well, however I did make a few adjustments to the recipe. I cut the chili powder back to 1/8 cup and substituted onion flakes/powder for the parsley.

Tweeted this a bit! Left the corn whole; swapped the heavy cream for Greek yogurt; and only used one teaspoon of chili powder!
