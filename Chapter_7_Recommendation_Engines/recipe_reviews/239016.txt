Christina's Slow Cooker Chili Haiku: "Husband and daughter ... well, they loved this chili lots. I was not on board." After just 2 hrs. on high, this chili was scorching around the edges b/c there really weren't any liquid-ey ingredients. I cut it back to low, trying to stay faithful to the directions, but a couple hrs. later, had to add some chicken broth to prevent it from turning into a clumpy, burnt mess. Maybe the "burnt" gave it some unusual flavor that my family loved, but I just didn't enjoy very much. Not thrilled w/ the onion and bell peppers going in raw rather than them being browned w/ the ground beef, but that did ultimately make this a very easy chili to prepare. Oh and lastly, the only thing that I did differently was use black beans instead of kidney, and a small can of chile peppers instead of jalapenos.

I'll admit that I did not read the recipe before making this chili. I looked at the ingredient list and modified a few things for example I don't like chunky tomatoes so I used plain tomato sauce instead. Also I did not have dried oregano so I substituted with Adobo seasoning. I also did not have cayenne pepper so I left it out. I figured the jalapeños were enough heat for the recipe. I left most of the seeds in the jalapeños as I chopped them. I also did not fry the ground beef and drain the fat from it before putting in the slow cooker I put everything into the slow cooker at once. IMO it's pointless to cook ingredients before putting them in the slow cooker. The whole point of the slow cooker is to not have to do that and also the fat from the meat made the recipe much more moist. Very tasty and moist!

Great Recipe! My teenage boys said it was their favorite. I added a bit more chili powder and an extra can of diced tomatos.  A winner!

I used this as a base recipe for a personal chili. I used 1.5 Lb of ground beef, and 1.5 Lb of steak tips, which were chopped up. The result was fantastic. I will be tweaking my recipe over time and will reference this one as my base.

I put 4lbs of ground and 2 x 28 oz diced tomatoes and final topping (after all mixed and ready) an additional 28 oz whole stewed tomatoes to ensure no burning on edges. Also cut back on the chili powder to 1 tbsp 1 teaspoon

Good recipe. I needed to add water to keep it from burning and some brown sugar to balance it all out. When all was said and done, it was delicious.

Great recipe! Made a smaller portion size but followed the recipe with a few exceptions. 1. Went half and half with the beans using equal portions of black beans and red kidney beans. 2. Went half and half with the meat using equal portions of ground beef and ground hot Italian sausage. Next time I might try adding a touch of cinnamon sugar. This is a great recipe!

It's a really good recipe, but if you don't like to eat hot, I recommend to cut back on the spices used in this recipe.

I am very picky when it comes to chili. I like a variety of beans, not too spicy, and not too thick. I put white kidney beans, shell beans, and pinto beans. I think that 6 hours is too long, so I cooked it layered for 2 1/2 hours and mixed for 1 hour. Lastly, I added 3 tbs of sugar to lighten the spicy taste at the very end.
