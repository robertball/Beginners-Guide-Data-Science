I was cooking my very first Thanksgiving Day turkey and I had no idea how to make stuffing. I usually don't even eat it.  But this recipe was so simple, and the results were so good, that I ate two helpings! Everyone loved it.  I added salt and pepper to taste, increased the poultry seasoning to taste, used whole wheat bread cut instead of torn, and I also added about a half cup of turkey broth made from the neck, gizzards, and giblets.  Yum!  This will be my standard stuffing recipe from now on.

This is a great stuffing that I used for Canadian Thanksgiving.  However, next time I woulnd't add as much celery, just for personal preference.  Really easy and really fast...

This would be the dressing my family has made for years except for that much celery, onion and egg, we would use FOUR loafs of bread and alot more for the seasoning. This dressing always gets raves!!! I think the most important part is to buy the best bread, cheap bread crumbles up...not good.

Very good. I wans't sure it would be okay seeing as there is no broth to keep it moist.  But it was moist.  I used thyme, sage, salt and pepper as the seasonings. Turn out great.  4 stars because my husband said it was slighty eggy and it is not as good as his mother's recipe (which is the best stuffing I've even tasted - it's made with a loaf of bread that is called Turkey Time it is baked with seasoning it it, can only find it in Canada).

Light, fluffy, and delicious side-dish.  I did not stuff my turkey with it, but rather cooked it in the oven.  I'm not realy a stuffing eater, but those who came to my home and tried it, loved it! :)

Simple to make and easy. This was the first stuffing I ever made and it turned out to be both delicious and especially quick to make. It took me about 20 minutes to make, and I'm both very slow and amateur in the kitchen.

This stuffing was really great. I also added a bit of sage , italin seasoning and a little bit of garlic powder. This Thanksgiving we stuffed the Turkey with the stuffing and also made a pan by itself and it didnt last long. It was a great , Thanks for the recipe and I will have to fix this for Christmas dinner also.. Thanks again :)

Definitley easy to make.  Kind of plain (actually tastes a lot like Stouffers)  Not my favorite but works if youre in a pinch.  I did add some italion seasoning and salt, which helped, but this wasnt anything extra special.  Great for beginners.

It was very good. However, I like my stuffing less dry, so next time I will add a little water.  I also added a little salt, since there is none in the recipe.
