I’m not too crazy about the addition of lemon to asparagus. I find adding a tart acidic item such as lemon to something incorporating a salty taste (prosciutto) doesn’t match up on a flavor palate. It wasn’t bad, but just not a combination I would use. I didn’t use toothpicks either. I started rolling the prosciutto around one spear of asparagus and then added the remaining spears. It worked beautifully.
