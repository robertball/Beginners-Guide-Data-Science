Really messy to work with but gets 5 stars cause my sniffling boy ate something with a lot of pleasure. These indeed are delicious if a picky 4 year old loves them and asks for leftovers. We used all salmon and sprinkled some lemon pepper afterwards.

My family absolutely loved this! Even my little one who swears she hates halibut. I used halibut that I had cooked in the crock pot with mango salsa the night before and this added a wonderful extra flavor to it.  I found that I was out of Worcestershire sauce so I was a little concerned that it wouldn't have alot of flavor so I did add extra pepper and sea salt with a tough of extra nutmeg also.  Being cooked with the salsa the  night before it turned out fabulous!  We will definetely be making this again.

The cook times took a little longer for me, maybe due to the type of potato or thickness of fish.  To help the messiness, after forming the patty, I used a spatula to carry & flip the patties in the egg & bread crumbs.  I added a few crumbs to the mix, but the patties were still messy, though I didn't mind.  All in all, the patties came out great tasting!  I'll try different potatoes & different seasoned crumbs next time for a different flavor.  Maybe I'll try a different fish too.  I used Italian crumbs & red potatoes this time around.  I didn't have any halibut, so I used extra salmon.

Big hit with my whole family. Very yummy. I added some bread crumbs to the fish mixture before making patties. This helped firm up the mix and made it less messy. Also increased the nutmeg and Worcestershire to a teaspoon and added some Old Bay seasoning.

I made these because so many people said they were outstanding.  Not only did my kids not eat them, I almost didn't either because the consistency was off-putting and mushy.  They weren't awful but certainly not worth making again.  The effort of boiling the potatoes, cooking the fish and making the whole thing into a cake, dipping in egg and bread crumbs to fry was a whole lot of effort for something with so little flavor.  They definitely need something more than nutmeg and Worcestershire.

This is so so good.  Even my picky 2-year old ate it. We made our own seasoned bread crumbs and used our left over salmon.  It's messy, but thanks to the previous reviews, I was prepared.

I think you could very easily spice up the flavor with a few extra ingredients but you can't do much about the texture without a major recipe overhaul.  For those of you who do like these, try making the patties then refrigerating before dipping in egg and breadcrumbs to cut down on the mess.

This Recipe is tasty, but it was a bit messy to make the Fish Cakes.  I used Fresh Atlantic Pollock, from my NH Community Seafood Weekly Share.  I also used Peeled, Little, Red Potatoes.  I recommend that you also include a 1/2 of the Bread Crumbs into the Fish and Potatoe Mixture (before you make the Fish Cakes, so they will hold together better).  I stuck to the Recipe, but you could add a few more Spices (i.e.:  Hot Pepper, Parsley, Oregano) so it isn't so bland.

I thought this was OK but not 5 star.  Had trouble keeping these together when cooking.  Flavors were good.
