This was so good. I am a push-over  for cranberries and this recipe didn't fail to bring some serious smiles, well-dones, and pats-on-the-back. I browned the pork chops, without a lid, long enough to achieve a good color and have plenty of yummies on the bottom of the skillet. Using the water and a 1/2 cup of whole berry cranberry sauce, I deglazed the skillet and when all the goodies were loose from the bottom of the skillet I added the remaining ingrediences. I returned the pork chops to the skillet and added enough liquid to almost come to the top of the pork chops.  I simmered them on Low/Med-Low until they were done having to add liquid twice. The pork chops were savory and sweet, but not too sweet,  I will certainly be making these again. For those of you who enjoy tweeking recipes, this has so much potential. My thoughts were along the lines of adding orange zest and toasted pecans to the cranberry sauce. Something else I was thinking about was,  using a mixture of water and cranberry juice instead of just water.

There's one thing that I didn't like about this recipe and that's the fact that the cranberries cooked to mush.  I would not add the cranberries until the last 10-15 minutes of braising.  Taste is good, and this really is easy, but it's not too appealing to the eye.

Excellent!  I used canned whole-berry cranberry sauce and omitted the sugar (forgot it!  opps!)  Because another reviewer mentioned that the cranberries "cooked to mush" I only added about 2/3rds of the cranberry sauce at the beginning.  Then, with about 10 minutes left, I added the rest of the sauce, mixing it in well.  Because of this, the sauce was perfect, and we spooned it over the meat when it was served.  Again, an EXCELLENT recipe!  Thanks for sharing!

I had fresh cranberries that I never made into sauce during the holidays, so this recipe was perfect!  I sliced a boneless pork roast into 8 "chops" and browned. Doubled sauce ingredients.  Used 1/2 Splenda and 1/2 white sugar. Added zest and juice of one large orange just because I love orange with my cranberry.  I'm sure it would have been great without it too.  Covered chops with water.  Thirty minutes later, we had wonderful pork chops with a sweet cranberry sauce (used two bags of fresh cranberries because the sauce is what makes it so fabulous!).  The extra sauce went well with the wild rice mix.  Great recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

I was skeptical but this was delicious! I followed the recipe exactly except for substituting Splenda for real sugar. Next time I plan on adding some cranberry juice for extra zest as per a previous reviewer. Perfect dish for date night with your significant other if you're looking for something new to try.

Really good and so easy.  I only had dried cranberries so I used less berries and added a little more water.  No mushy sauce.
Even my son (age 24) who is picky loved this.  Thanks!

I can't believe that I forgot to rate such a great recipe.  This is a wonderfully versatile recipe that never fails to deliver, and I've even received compliments from people who don't care for cranberries.  Different versions have included orange zest, orange juice, cranberry juice,  mace, ginger and combinations thereof.  All were excellent.  Thank you for the recipe.

We really liked this recipe and will make it again!  I altered slightly, added 1/2 water 1/2 orange juice and added a generous 'dollup' of dijon mustard.  Very tasty!

Very flavorful and tender.   The only thing I did different was to use sugar instead of chemical sweetener, and reduce the recipe by half, since there's only two of us.  Put in more water than was called for because I was afraid it would cook off too fast.  It didn't, so I had to reduce the sauce a little at the end, but it came out amazing!  I would serve this to company.

I used sweetened Craisins and added no sugar. Also, I added 3/4 cup chicken bouillon  extra. I let it simmer  till it was fork tender, and thickened the sauce with a little tapioca flour mixed with a little water. Dead easy and delicious. A KEEPER.orange juice and ginger  could be a nice addition well worth a try next time.

This was very unique and a great way to use the bag of fresh cranberries I got with my farmer's market basket! However, I highly suggest using real sugar and NOT Stevia/Splenda. I used Stevia in the Raw and it had an icky aftertaste once the sauce was blended and had simmered for awhile. I threw in some sugar and it helped. My son thought the cranberries were too tangy, but my husband really liked this. I used almost 4 cups of fresh cranberries and about 1 cup of water and it was too runny towards the end so I let it boil uncovered about 10 minutes to reduce and got a good consistency. I would definitely try this one again!

My family loved this recipe. I altered it a a bit though. I marinated the pork chops in liquid smoke and worcestershire sauce and Ms. Dash for a hour then pan fried them in grape seed oil with cut up { thinly sliced} garlic cloves . Cooked for 3 mins each side then drained and put on napkins to soak up the oil. Then I added onion powder, salt,black pepper and 1/4 cup of real sugar to the 1/2 cup of water in a new pan and put the cranberries in. Brought it to a boil and added the pork chops and let them simmer for 20-25 mins. Poured a little of the sauce over some wild rice and served it with blanched asparagus. Will do again!

Yummy! These were so good. The pork came out nice and tender and the sweet and tartness of the berries was super flavorful. Will definitely make again!

I used a pork loin cut into medallions.

Since several people commented that their pork dried out, I salted the outside of each piece (Learned that one from Samin Nosrat's Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat. It worked.) 

I have a bag of Halos (little mandarin oranges). I peeled and segmented two of them, cut back the (real) sugar, and continued the recipe as written.

Delicious! I made this with Whole Berry Sauce as another reviewer did. I deglazed the pan with a bit of orange juice, held out 1/3 of the can to add at the end. Added in a spoonful of sugar and a bit of cornstarch to thicken the gravy once the chops were cooked, and added the rest of the can at the end of cooking. I only cooked it for about 20 minutes or so after browning the chops. They were pretty thick, but that was plenty of time.  I highly recommend this recipe.

It was fantastic. Just added some sweet vidali onions to eat and it was awesome. Passed on the splenda and used half of the sugar. You only live once.

I marinated the pork chops in cranberry juice for several hours, then used the juice in place of the water in the recipe.   I used sugar instead of splenda, and cranberries I had in the freezer left from the holidays. I topped each serving with toasted almonds. The almonds not only made it taste good, but prettied up the dish considerably.

Made these last week and needed to let everyone know how great these are. My pork chops always turn out dry, so I rarely make them, but not these. Not only did they look great but they were moist and really delicious. I used canned whole cranberries so didn't need to sweeten. I plan to make this again and again. Hmmm I think I may pick up some chops tonight. :)

It was so good and my husband was so impressed with me. I made a few changes: I used regular sugar, added rosemary, savory spices, and rum to the cranberries. It was delish!

Perhaps our favorite pork chop recipe. The best was when I had plenty of cranberries and doubled the cranberries and reduced sweetner and used part sugar. I also used juice of an orange and the orange zest.  Regardless of substitutes--it's a great recipe with wild or brown rice.

This recipe was excellent- super easy and turned out perfect, even after sitting a little longer when my husband got home late from work.  I used dried cranberries and a splash of orange juice, along with regular sugar.  Definitely a keeper for an easy dinner!

Pretty good.  Liked the sauce, just not sure about with Pork Chops.  Will keep recipe for sauce.  Think it would be great at Thanksgiving.  Used brown sugar.Just "fair" for me, but thanks for sharing.

I used sugar instead of splenda and canned whole berry cranberry sauce. I just put a little less sugar than the recipe called for since I was using cranberry sauce. Also, I didn't have a problem w/ the berries cooking to mush...maybe since I was using the sauce. I thought it was delicious but probably would've used 2 cans of sauce to give it more flavor. Will certainly be trying it again.

l keep bags of cranberries in the freezer (bought on sale) and the flavor of the pork and cranberries was a delicious combination.  I had large pork chops and used two bags of cranberries.  I also used a mix of sugar and splenda, but not as much as called for in the recipe, as I did not want it too sweet.  It came out perfect.
