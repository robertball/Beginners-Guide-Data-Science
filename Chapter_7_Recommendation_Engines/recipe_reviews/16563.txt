A more accurate name would be "cheese & chicken bread pudding", because that's what it is. Made the recipe as stated. Did not care for the sogginess nor the bland flavor. Will not make this again.

This recipe has potential.  Our family of three considers it a "keeper" so that immediately says it's good.  I would consider adding cheese to the chicken before laying the top layer of bread.  I will definitely be experiementing with this one.

More preparation than I am used to but this came out very good.  My husband probably enjoyed this the most.  Both daughters were not happy with the onion, but I personally liked this dish as well.

Let me start by saying this was overall a tasty recipe. However, it is not a very pretty one. The casserole looks a little yucky. Thankfully, I have a family that will taste just about anything. So, we were happily suprised that the taste was so good. I wonder if all of the liquid ingredients are necessary. I kept wondering if the eggs were cooked all the way. It's a recipe I'll make again, maybe I'll just have to experiment a little bit!

This recipe is wonderful!  I used leftover thanksgiving turkey instead of the chicken and it was just great.  Called for items I generally always have on hand anyway.  Simply great!!

We LOVED this recipe. To make it healthier, I used whole wheat bread slices, and fat free mayo, milk, soup, and Mozarella cheese. I also added a few splashes of Garlic-flavor Tabasco (will add more next time). A definite keeper!

I run a Family Daycare Home and the children loved it (including me & my parents). The children range from 7 mos. thru 5 yrs and a few are very picky eaters, they sure were not picky when it came to this dish. I was a bit concerned with the keeping it over night but it gave the older children and me a project to do at the end of their day and something to look forward to the next day.

It was okay, but I don't think I'll make it again.  There was a lot of leftovers and it wasn't that great heated over.

Reviewers who didn't care for this might try using a sturdier bread--sourdough or Italian/French. They hold together better than sandwich bread. Good for a weekend brunch. This was very good; the only change i made was using French bread(that's what i had on hand) and look forward to trying the ham/broc combo in the future. Thanks Teri! :O)

My mouth is watering just remembering how tasty this was! I followed the directions exactly and it turned out great. My Husband was not crazy about all the celery, but I liked it. I even used celery salt instead of regular salt. I used Pepperidge Farms enriched white bread and it held together nicely. Not mushy at all. Thanks!

Great recipe!  I added some cooked, chopped carrots and broccoli and YUM.  Wish it was quicker to make, but worth the effort.

This was really good! I was a little leary...but wow! This would be great for a football game! It had a sort of stuffing taste! This one is hard to explain......but wow! Try it for yourself...just remember that is has to be made the night before and refrigerated....or you can prepare it early and the morning...yum...my husband really loved this one!

This was tasty.  Simple, tasted like stuffing, like other reviewers mentioned.  Great with a salad with ranch dressing to add some zest.  The bread wasn't too soggy like I feared; in fact, I was surprised it held together like it did.  I will make this again.

just browsing and came across this recipe...my family makes a recipe very similar to this...we don't toast the bread, and us cream of mushroom instead of cream of chicken soup...I have to say you either love it or hate it...it's a texture thing.  I love it, my husband hates it, I mean he will not eat it at all, so I have to have it when I go home to visit my family.  It is "comfort food" to me!

Thank you!  I was searching for a recipe my mother had and this is it!! There is one difference -- for mom's we mixed the mayo w/chicken, celery and onion to layer between the bread.  Then it was just the eggs and milk mixed together to pour over bread, w/chicken soup over that.  Thanks again for having and sharing this recipe!!!

The flavor was OK, but none of us cared for the texture - especially the kids. I was thinking that it might be better with a layer of noodles where the bread was... but then I might as well just make the easy chicken tetrazzini recipe at this site.

Has potential - but a few comments. All sauce / liquid ingredients should have been blended together, with a layer on the bottom of the dish before bread to allow it to soak in more evenly. Flavor was on the bland side.

I have loved each and every recipe on here but this. I tossed in some egg noodles and mixed it all together. This recipe requires some experimentation.
