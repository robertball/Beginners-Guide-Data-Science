This is a classic New England sandwich best served on a regular ol' hot dog bun which I prefer grilled. (Pepperidge Farm is my favorite) I use big, meaty chunks of fresh lobster, no onion or herbs, and just a bit of lemon juice. I could eat this every day--if lobster wasn't so pricey!

We had a good portion of leftover lobster and I heard that lobster doesn't reheat well so I thought of a lobster sandwich that I had at Neiman Marcus for lunch one day.  This recipe is FAR better then what Neiman Marcus offers.  SO simple but yet, so delicious.  I brought fresh French bread from the bakery and toasted it prior to dressing the sandwich.  The next time we have lobster I plan on buying too much again, just so that I can have this sandwich the next day!!!

Delicious!  I marinated the lobster meat(after cooking) in butter with a little lemon juice and garlic powder for a few minutes, then drained off the mixture before adding it to the mayo/onion/celery dressing.  I served it open-faced on toasted slices of French baguette bread with lettuce.  Everyone loved it!!!

One of the few things I miss about Long Island is going out to Montauk and having Lobster Rolls. When I found this recipe I had to try it! Instead of using lobster meat I also used immitation crab meat like a previous reviewer posted and also mild green tabasco sauce and it was Outrageous!! The lime gives it a nice flavor. Would also be nice to serve with crackers for get togethers. These will be the only Lobster Rolls I will ever make! Thank You for sharing this recipe :)

This was amazing!  We bought lobster tails for V-Day that were just too big to eat, and I had no idea what to do with the leftovers, since I have bad luck reheating lobster.  So I tried this recipe since it stays cold.  I'm so glad I did!  I did make a few changes: I had about a 1/2 Lb. of lobster, I used all the mayo (light), I used 1 Tab lemmon, not lime, I substituted a dash of celery salt becuase I don't like celery, I added about 4 dashes more hot pepper sause, and I put it in a tortilla with lettuce (and no butter)as a wrap.  I can't see myself spending $20 a pound just for this, but if I ever have leftover lobster again, this is the perfect way to eat it!  And if you have a fancy party, this would make an unbelievable appitizer.

Absolutly wounderful recipe...even though I cheaped out and used large shrimp instead of lobster meat. (I thought I'd leave this review since so many people talked about the price of lobster.) I seasoned a pot of water with salt, pepper corns, bay leaf and two lemons cut in half. Simmer water, add shrimp then immediatly shut off heat. Cover and let sit for ten minutes, perfect shrimp every time. then shock in ice bath, peal then follow recipe as previously stated. (cut shrimp to desired chunkyness) enjoy!!

We were at an Asian Mkt in So Cal and they had a special for the nite...kingsize,5 LB. LIVE, lobsters $5.99 a pound... They would steam it for us. It was a done deal! We already had dinner, so I decided to look on this site for something for tomorrow and low and behold, I found this recipe!  IT WAS FABULOUS!  I was thrilled we even had a little leftover for the next day.   I didn't alter a thing.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Last summer, we spent time on the Massachusetts shore.  I absolutely fell in the love with the lobster rolls that we got from the small, "mom and pop" type of places, particularly in Salem and Plymouth.  These were very much as good as those that we enjoyed.  I added a bit more basil, and used sweet basil simply because it was all I had in the house at the time.  I added a bit less onion than called for as well.  The recipe is wonderful, but I think a bit of experimentation is always even better.

I guess I'm just giving this 4 stars because I don't like the taste of lime paired with lobster, I prefer lemon.  And I think the mayo mixture should be in the fridge for a couple of hours (or, even better, overnight!).  Otherwise...love lobster rolls!

First let me say that this was exactly what I was looking for. I actually a a couple of lobster tails laying around as well as some Argentina Pink shrimp so I decided I was in the mood for a lobster roll. I Marinated the shrimp in this: http://allrecipes.com/recipe/marinated-grilled-shrimp/detail.aspx ------ For the lobster I clarified some butter and added some lemon zest to that. I skewered the shrimp and the and the lobster tails. I cut the lobster on the shell side all the way through the meat being careful not to go through the underbelly. Put the skewered tail on a sheet of aluminum foil and put the clarified butter in the middle of the slit and wrap it up. Shrimp takes about 6 minutes and tails take about 10. Once I had the proteins I followed the recipe exactly except for lemon instead of lime and Texas Pete's instead of Tobasco. I guess I also did use some finely chopped red onion, not a lot though. Be sure to butter both sides of your bread and grill that bread baby! Also, celery overpowers seafood so you must slice your stalks in half and then slice them extra thin.

Believe it or not had leftover lobster (cancellations at a dinner party),so decided to try this recipe. Excellent choice! Just the right amount of mayo, and flavorings that you could still enjoy the decadent taste of the lobster. Hubby told me to make sure I save this recipe, tho I'm not sure if we will ever have leftover lobster again in this life time.

Very Plain.  I am from Nova Scotia and I've had lobster rolls many, many times.  The ingredients are perfect but sauted garlic and some regular onion give it a nice flavour.

Good recipe, but I zipped it up some by adding 1 tsp of dijon mustard, some old bay seasoning and some dill (fresh or dried). Added a nice flavor. Tip: Make sure lobster meat is well drained if using frozen.

Living in New Brunswick on the Bay of Fundy makes it affordable to buy from the fishermen.  This recipe is great...though I left out the celery as I find it can overpower the delicate flavors of seafood.  I grilled my hotdog buns in a little garlic butter and served with a spoon full of cheddar cheese sause (made from a simple white sauce with cheddar melted into it).  Yummy

I used frozen, leftover lobster (thawed of course) & I did opt to use kaiser rolls. I used chives instead of green onions & I added a tbp of melted butter (what's lobster w/out butter? ;o)  ). I served it al fresco w/ Honeydew Soup (from thsi site), fresh yellow tomato wedges, sprinkled w/ basil & salt & a glass of pinot grigio. Hubby said that when he retires he wants this for lunch everyday! Thansk for a wonderful recipe!

I don't think I could ever rate lobster rolls with five stars, but this recipe is as good as it gets!  In my opinion, lobster is best served steamed with melted butter!  Anyhow, I had three, very large, warm water lobster tails, and they weren't as good as your colder water variety.  They were perfect for lobster rolls.

Fabulous! We left out the lettuce- didn't need it. Used fresh lemon juice instead of lime because it's what I had available and used fresh parsley instead of dried. Absolutely delicious!

I used shrimp. I know,it's now a shrimp roll.I live near San Francisco but Lobster is still expensive.I used dill weed, and about 1/4 of a stalk of celery.Sauted the shrimp with garlic and olive oil. My husband and I love them.Next time I will splurge on Lobster.

I grew up on lobster rolls in New England.  I was so excited about this recipe, which I followed to the letter.  It didn't do much for me -- something just didn't seem right, and I'm not sure if was the lime, or perhaps not enough mayo.  I'll try it again, with adjustments.  I'm thinking plain ol' salt, pepper, lemon, and mayo.

A dish of delish! Please use the tarragon. It totally made this dish.  The second time I made it I sauteed the celery a bit so that the celery taste didn't take over the lobster sammy as much. Thanks for posting it!

Well...paint me yellow and call me a cab. I love this flexible recipe. Strangely enough, I had already followed some reviewers suggestions before I read them. Two 4 oz tails were boiled and stripped of the meat...yielding 3 5/8 oz meat. Therefore I did a recipe for one. Didn't have green onions so used a little caramelized sweet onion. I had a strong garlic Aoili which I diluted with some Lite Mayo, added some Dijon and Tabasco. It was tasty in a WW hot dog bun I toasted with a little butter. Boy howdy...
wouldn't want to get too used to this. Being cold, it's real easy and like one reviewer suggested...letting the mayo mix marry overnight doesn't hurt. It's not fresh Lobster in butter, but it stretches things nicely. BTW, lettuce is nice, but optional. A little Spinach added a nice green, though not the crunch of crisp lettuce.

Lobsters were $3.99 lb this week in CT, bought extra and made sure I enjoyed a great summer day in New England. Used top split hot dog rolls and used lemon instead of lime-personal choice. This recipe was perfect!

Awesome recipe!! Tastes just like the lobster rolls of my childhood vacations on Cape Cod. I substituted fresh lemon juice for lime-still tasted great.

The addition of the lime juice and the tabasco make this fantastic!

Awesome! I followed recipe exactly and was worried it wouldn't be enough mayo but it was the perfect amount. I have made this several times and when you can't use real lobster there is an alternative, langostino, which I found frozen at Trader Joes. I have subbed with this and nobody could tell it wasn't lobster. Yum! Thank you!

This is fantastic!!!  I live in New England where the best lobster in the world comes from, so I was thrilled to find this recipe.  If you are looking for the real thing, this is it!!!  And DON'T FOOL WITH THE DRESSING!!!  Its perfect-it doesn't overpower the lobster, which is the star here.  And PLEASE don't forget to toast that hot dog bun!!  Make this recipe for friends, & they will be impressed (if you can afford the cost. I was lucky-my lobsters were $4.99 a pound!!!!!)  Thank you so much for a wonderful recipe.

This was our first time having lobster rolls. I grilled the lobster on skewers on the bbq, SO FLAVORFUL!! I had grilled some shrimp & asparagus. We ate most of that and I added the rest to this salad. I used too much fresh parsley and I thought it overwhelmed it just a bit, no one else seemed to notice ;;)) Perfect summer time dinner! Thank you Starr

My family loved this recipe, however I made some minor revisions. I omitted the lime juice, and used lemon juice, I also omitted the tabasco sauce. I also used this recipe for shrimp rolls as well, excellent!!!!!

I am only giving 4 stars because I made a couple of changes.  Used lemon juice instead of lime, red onion in place of green onions and put it on a deli flat which I did grill with butter. This was based on what I had on hand. As it turned out, it was delicious.  I used slipper lobster tails which I broiled then let cool.  Mixed with the mayo mixture and refrigerated for a couple of hours.  It made a great valentine dinner, easy but great tasting and made most of it ahead of time during the day.

Wonderful! My husband, my sister, my twelve year old neice, and my seven year old son all loved these! I used hoagie rolls and substituted imitation crab meat for the lobster. We will be having these again later this week!

The best thing I ever eat. The only thing I did differently was I used Cajun Seasoning and not pepper or hot sauce, Pork Blend of fresh Herbs, Red Onions, Yellow, Red and Orange Peppers - Oh and I used Surimi. In Alaska 1 1/2 lbs of Lobster runs about $100

I also buttered the kaiser roll, heated up a skillet and toasted both sides of the bun. The inside was crunchy and the outside was so soft.  

This was the first Foux-Lobster Roll I have eaten and it tasted exactly the way I imagined. If I would have given you a bite you would not have known the difference. 

Love this recipe. Next time I wall leave out the Peppers . . .

Used imitation lobster and crab.  delicious and a fraction of the cost of the one I enjoyed in Boston. the hot sauce is a must. Frank's is the best.

Fantastic! Used lemon instead of lime and left out the lettuce, but those were the only changes. The taste was truly memorable and a great treat on an unusually cool, rainy day in Florida. Thanks Starr!

Delicious! Used lemon instead of lime, because that's what I had, and green Tabasco because it's a little milder. Just yummy!

Excellent.  I did make a few quirks by 1) using whole wheat bread instead of a bun, fresh parsley, and a tablespoon of chopped white spanish onion.  No lettuce, no celery.

I made this with imitation crab meat- don't. I am sure it would be good with lobster. I trimmed the sides of the hot dog bun a little, buttered them & the inside & cooked the outside a little in a fry pan like they do in New England. I might plurge one day & buy lobster meat to try in this but it is kinda hard to find fresh seafood out here in Colorado. Thanks.

This recipe is so good - thank you!  I didn't have green onions, so I used chives instead.  They worked just fine.  I also added one teaspoon of dijon mustard, and it gave it a great flavor and kick.  We served it with top split hot dog buns, and it looked very impressive.  Can't wait to make this for guests.

These were great. I used fresh tarragon and added it to melted butter then brushed the butter on Pretzilla rolls and placed them under the broiler for 5 mins. Once the rolls were warm I added the lobster mixture. I will definitely make these again.

After cooking up an end of summer lobster feast for my husband & I we had quite a bit left over!!
And so I looked here & found your recipe first.
This was a simple yet perfect recipe !!
The only change I made was instead of hot sauce I used 2 shakes of Red Pepper 
My husband said it was better than any lobster roll we ever had out! 
Thanks for sharing - I need look no further for a recipe - it is now my go to recipe!!!

Because we like our food extra-flavorful, spicy, crunchy, and even a bit sweet; we modified the recipe a bit. We added garlic,  green onions, cumin, cilantro, salt, pepper, aunt Chulula' s chili lime pepper sauce, and shredded romaine for texture. The bread was toasted with butter and minced garlic, under a bed of shredded lettuce on the sesame French bread rolls. Stuffed the mix into the rolls. Topped off with a few scattered capers, sprinkle sesame seeds, and garnished with parsley.

If you're going this far, just make it a full on 'Nor-eastah! The only change I made was that I subbed out the lime juice with lemon and toasted the buttered rolls before I hit them with the lettuce and Lobstah. Either way, you can't go wrong. Even before you do that though. Make/buy a solid clam chowder to have before. Then a nice, warm blueberry pie with vanilla bean ice to rinse it all down after. Brush your teeth, throw on a movie and relax. You'll be thinking about again shortly. Lol

We loved this! I made the dressing just as listed but I did substitute langostinos for the lobster because of the cost.  I get big bags of langostinos at Costco.  I also toasted the buns before adding the lettuce.  Yummy!

Delicious! Used crab instead of lobster and didn't have Tabasco so I added Old Bay!

These were great!  We added a small chopped cucumber and sprinkled powdered Ranch dip over the mixed lobster and added 1/2 tsp. dill weed.  Very good!

Followed the directions precisely (scaled down for the amount of lobster I had) except I used fresh lemon juice instead of lime because that was what I used when I broiled the tails. And I can vouch that the tails were cooked perfectly because I had a taste right when they came out of the oven. This recipe may be a perfect match for the original but for my money it was far from the best use of the lobster. I'd call it fairly good but certainly not great. Still it was something I've always wanted to try and I appreciate your posting a fairly authentic recipe. But in the future I'd still go for just plain with a little lemon & butter.

IF WE ARE LUCKY, WE GET TO EAT LOBSTER TWO TIMES A YEAR.  DUE TO BUDGET RESTRICTIONS WE MADE THIS WITH THE LOBSTER FLAVORED FISH. FOLLOWING THE RECIPE EXACTLY, IT WAS A DARNED GOOD 2ND PLACE.

These were incredible. Used 4 1.25lb lobsters (only 4.75 per pound!) and made 7-8 hot dog roll sized lobster rolls. Way better making them yourself than going to a restaurant where 1 lobster roll could cost $18.

Nice sandwich and simple to make. However, Lobster is expensive, so I am not sure I would make this again, since it tasted a bit plain for the price.

I really liked this recipe.  Great for lunch and quick to make.  I used imitation crab meat instead of lobster (hard to find lobster in Texas!) and it still was good.  My husband liked it as well.  I would pull the crab meat apart instead of leaving it in huge hunks just so the overall effect is a little more saladie.

I grilled two lobster tails and a half a pound of Argentine Red shrimp, drizzled with a bit of seasoned butter( muttered with fresh garlic and parsley). Chopped the meat up, and added the celery, green onion and a bit of red onion....just watched the proportions for a nice blend.  Mixed it all up with the lemon juice (for the lime juice) tarragon and mayo and a bit of cayenne.  Let that chill in the fridge till everything else was about done. Scooped out the centers of the hot dog buns, coated them with the seasoned butter and grilled till nice and toasted! Fantastic!

Good recipe. I had to adjust since I bought a 1 1/2 pound lobster instead of 1 1/2 POUNDS of crab meat. I made due and only made 2, but they were yummy. Stamp of approval from my Stepson!

Best lobster rolls didn’t change anything in the recipe.  This will definitely be my go to recipe. Better than any I have gotten out with the price being $15-$26.

I have to admit... I was surprised how much we LOVED this recipe!  We are admitted food snobs and love our seafood so I was skeptical when there were minimal ingredients but that's what made it amazing!  I cut the recipe down to a fourth because that's all of the lobster we had (Langostino Tails).  I also used fresh lemon juice and we changed the rolls from buttered with lettuce to buttered and grilled.  I will make these again without question!

This is good as written.  I had to add a little more Mayo because we like it with a little moist.  I did add Thousand Island Dressing to my bun because I wanted a little pickle for more crunch and a little vinegar taste.  Next time I plan on using Thousand Island Dressing or Miracle Whip instead of the Mayo.

Made the recipe as is except after the lobster was shelled there wasn't anywhere near enough.  Flavors were great.  May try this with shrimp and/or crab.  Maybe use it to jazz up tuna salad, too.

Would definitely make this again if we had available lobster.
Thank you for the recipe!

Very easy to create and extremely flavorful. Basically followed the recipe except I used finely diced vidalia in lieu of green onions (of which I had none), diced the celery very fine, and omitted the lettuce (my husband didn't want the lettuce). In my local area, split top hot dog rolls are extremely hard to find, so I substituted potato rolls . . . grilled to perfection. Great recipe. Thanks!

I used Siracha sauce instead of the tobasco because that's what I had. It was delicious. Great recipe. I used it with lobster that we had left over from a special dinner the night before. We had so much lobster left over, that this mixture made enough for sandwiches using big beautiful rolls and had enough filling left for crackers to snack on later that evening. Yummy! I also used lemon instead of lime. Will make again.

I used imitation crab as well. And I used lemon instead of lime -- and probably more of it. I LOVED the tarragon and the hot sauce. Here's another good idea that I tried: pickled radishes on top. Even more delicious!

I made this for my husband tonight who is from Boston and he loved it. I did a bit of Tapatio, italian seasoning, and used deli rolls instead of hot dog buns - toasted them.

Ok, I haven't actually tried this recipe, but I wanted to write what I recently tried as I never made a lobster roll before and made these for my family. After looking at all the different recipes out there and sampling lobster rolls in many different restaurants, I found what I think, is by far the simplest abd best tasting lobster roll. Use lobster meat at room temperature and cut/rip into bite sized peices...I actually took the meat out of an 8 lb monster, but whatever size you like. Melt a fair amount of butter...I used a stick and a half...and allow it to cool. Add the juice of 1 lemon and mix. Now pour it over the meat and coat thoroughly. Now butter and toast potato rolls. Add the lobster and you are done! You're not taking away from the taste of the lobster meat at all and putting only what you would normally add to a whole lobster! It was really delicious, I highly recommend it!

My first time making lobster rolls. They were great! My husband is from the New England area and had actually never had one. He dislikes mayonnaise so I added some extra lemon juice to cut the flavor, I added about the whole lemon. I also added cayenne pepper instead of hot sauce. These were wonderful! I will definitely make these again. :)

Nice simple lobster roll. Take the time and look around for traditional top split buns.

Love this recipe.  I let mine marinate in the refrigerator about 2 hours so the flavors meld, before putting on the rolls.  Also, I am not a mayo lover, but I used Duke's mayo for this and it is perfection.

These were really good! The only substitutions I made on the second time was I didn't butter the rolls, didn't use the lettuce and I used light mayonnaise which in my opinion changed the taste for the better. However, that wasn't to say that the original recipe is delicious!

Delicious!  I added some diced fresh cucumber to ensure I had enough filling for two large sandwiches.  Also mixed taragon and other stuff with the lobster, celery, mayonaise, lime juice, and hot sauce before putting it on the rolls.  Made a great summer lunch when lobster was delightfully cheap!

This was actually my first time eating a lobster roll, so I have nothing to compare it to.  I served it on a homemade hoagie roll that I found online.  I toasted the roll, added butter, lobster, then lettuce.  Hubby said he would prefer this on a french baguette.  So easy, thank you.

Wow this sure brought back good memories of my childhood.  My mom and dad are both from Nova Scotia and that is where we headed every summer.  We ate a ton of Lobster Rolls and never got sick of them.  Your recipe tastes just like I remember.  Thanks!
