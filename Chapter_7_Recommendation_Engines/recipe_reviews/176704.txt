This is my recipe. When I originally submitted this, I recommended using NSA broth and tomato sause to help lower the sodium content. The garlic and herb seasoning blend that is listed, I use Mrs. Dash, which is also low sodium. And the vegetable oil listed, I generally use EVOO. I hope you enjoy the recipe! Thanks for looking! :D

This was really great; fast, delicious and easy. I made it as written but saved some fresh dill to sprinkle on top at the end. I recommend making this in a dutch oven as I was running out of room in my large skillet.

This is very good. These are the changes I made: I used extra lean ground beef, olive oil, 3 cloves of garlic, 2 teaspoons dried dill, and 8 oz tomato sauce. This recipe's fairly versatile. It was very healthy with the meat to veggie ratio and it's very tasty. Thanks for the great recipe!

Thanks for reminding me of this old Irish recipe!  My Aunt Marie used to make this for me but called it "Sloppy Potatoes". Her Mom (my Gradmother O'Donnell) used to make it for the 6 kids to stretch the meat in their depression era days on the farm.

Nice easy supper. I'm almost embarrassed to say I had no tomato sauce so I used salsa, a scanty amount.

Instead of using lamb, I used smoked sausage from my butcher.  It was amazing!

It was delicious. Skipped on bay leaves because i couldn't find any, but none-the-less great.
