OMG THIS WAS AWESOME!!  I made this at the last minute and made to recipe exactly as stated.  I let it chill for about 45 minutes and it was so good, that's all I ate for dinner.   I would suggest using avocados that are slightly green, so they are not too soft when you are mixing.  Also, only make enough for what will be eaten at that meal.  The avocado's naturally start to brown when cut and the salad is not visually appealing the next day!  Good lord, this tasted delicious!!  Thank you for the recipe!

This was very good and tangy.  I'd add cherry tomatoes or red pepper - just something to give it a little splash of color, since a little boring to look at.

This was yummy!  My husband loved it.  I was looking for a recipe that I could make to use up my avocados and cilantro, yet not make guacamole.  This did the trick.  Definitely a keeper!  Thanks for sharing.

I'm not a big fan of avocado but I had some leftover to use up and the flavours in this salad were pretty good I have to say. It is also good with the addition of a diced hard boiled egg or two. Looks great served inside a lettuce leaf 'cup'.

Fantastic summer salad! I had a tomato that I needed to use before it was bad so chopped that up and put it in, and used red onions, since I didn't have any green in stock. I used one fresh lime and a big handful of cilantro. I didn't have any fresh lemon, but it was so delicious without it. I will make this again...and again....

I've made this a few times now, and we've substituted thinly sliced red onion for the green onion, and usually use only lime (no lemon).  I also add a bit of honey because I like the sweetness to bring out the salty and sour.  Guests love it too.  Once I even had to use the cilantro in the tube instead of fresh because the store didn't have any fresh, and it turned out great.

I need to try this recipe again with a riper avocado.  It was not bad tasting but it didn't blow me away.  I did add some cumin and red pepper to give it some kick.

This was very good. I loved the contrasting textures of the crispy cucumber and the creamy avocado. Such a simple dressing, too! I tossed it with chopped arugula, and the flavors combined beautifully. Definitely a keeper.

This recipe tastes better than it looks...but only a little bit. I definetely would not reccommend this to anyone. It looked so unappetizing that I almost didn't even taste it.

I made this last night for my boyfriends family & everyone raved about it.  It really is soooo good!!!  This salad was easy to make, looks so pretty when it is done, is much better for you than a regular salad & tastes nice & refreshing.  I put the salad together about 4 hours before guests arrived, but waited until about 30 minutes before serving to slice up the avocado & add it in because I didn't want it to brown up at all.  To prevent it from getting mushy I just lightly tossed the salad with my hands.  Other than that, made it just as the recipe specified & will continue to do so again & again & again...

Another good starting recipe.  This is a very refreshing summer salad.  The recipe should tell you not to use a very ripe avocado.  I recommend not stirring this salad.  Put it in a tupperware like container and move the contents gently to cover with lime juice.  Avocados for me, require salt, so I increased the salt to 1/2 a teaspoon, and added sliced red onion and some red pepper flakes for more flavor and a little color.

Make the dressing first. I add a tablespoon of olive oil and sometimes a tiny bit of honey if its too tart...not enough you would actually taste sweetness. Add the cucumber and toss thoroughly. Then gently fold in the cubed avocado; in two batches if necessary. I used two forks to do the job. Using a medium sized bowl is also helpful as it gives you plenty of room to toss together with ease. This is best when served nice and chilled. A summertime favorite for me and my boyfriend. Thank you Jessie.

This is fantastic! Whether served as a salsa or a salad, it is utterly refreshing! The lime juice, cilantro, & a small amount of garlic elevate the fresh & flavorful factors. I will make this often.

This was absolutely yummy! The only adjustments i made were adding roma tomatoes, a little less fresh garlic, and a dash of garlic salt. I also waited to add the avocado til the end so i didn't smash it up.

Loved how light and cool this recipe was! Perfect for those summer days. Definitely need to use firm avocados. I used someone else's suggestion to put all the ingredients in the bowl at one time before stirring (gently!) which helps keep the avocado from becoming smooshed. Has a similar flavor to guacamole, but the cucumber gives it a nice crunch.

I'm glad I tried this but it wasn't my favorite.  This 
"Tangy Cucumber and Avocado Salad" was a little too tangy for me.  I did add the optional green onion -  I really think this salad needed that extra dimension of flavor. My avocados were a little more ripe than they should have been for this salad so it wasn't as attractive as it could/should have been.

I'm always looking for different types of salads and this one was great!  The flavors of all the ingredients go together so well.  Tonight I served it with Spicy Grilled Shrimp from this site and I'm sure I will make it with a lot of meals this summer.  I did add grape tomatoes for color and did add a little sweetener so that it wasn't quite so tart.  Very unique and enjoyable salad.

I made this for dinner for my daughter and her friend the other night.  They were scraping the bowl!  My husband liked it and he doesn't even like avacados.  If you like the ingredients, you will LOVE this dish.  Another plus is that it was super easy to prepare.  Thanks for a keeper!

SOOO GOOD! Very fresh (assuming you use fresh ingredients) - would be amazing with a main dish like hot sauce, buffalo wings, indian food, bbq spicy food. 

I used regular onion, and dried cilantro, but it was still amazing and can't wait to play with the ingredients, you could easily switch in other things like tomatoes or red peppers.  

There is something about the ratio of lime to lemon juice, mixed with fresh cracked pepper and salt which works perfectly with the cold avocado and cucumber.

My new favorite! So healthy. The cucumbers and cilantro are fresh and clean, while the avacado adds a hint of creaminess. I cannot emphasize how much I have enjoyed this salad. I wouldn't have thought to put this combination of flavors together, but I will now be making this for years to come.

This was really good. I didn't change a thing, I probably used more garlic and lemon and lime because I always eyeball that kind of stuff to my liking!The difference in textures was great and the cilantro really made the dish, I will be making this again! Thanks for the great post!

This was fabulous and received rave reviews where I brought it.  I followed the directions exactly and added one roma tomato and a splash of balsamic vinegar.  Next time, I'm going to make it as a salsa and add a jalapeno or serrano pepper and chop the ingredients a little finer.

For a touch of color, I added tomatoes.  Super healthy and a nice side dish for summer. I will be making this again.

Great simple dish.  I only had 1 and 1/2 cucumbers, but that seemed about right.  I think i prefer this to guacamole!

This was seriously YUMMY! I added a few cherry tomatoes for a punch of colour, but otherwise everything else was the same. Fabulously quick, easy lunch! I didn't wait the 30 minutes...too hungry! :D

I am somewhat biased because I ADORE avocados, but I made this recipe nearly exact, and it is delicious.  I served it as a salad to go with a special meal alongside my mother's cornbread recipe and another recipe I found on Allrecipes for flatiron steak with a mole sauce.  Add a glass of wine and its a classy romantic dinner with south-of-the-border undertones.

I LOVE THIS SALAD!!! I usually scale it down as it is just my husband and I and add some shallot and a few pinches of cumin. If you're not happy with the presentation I would suggest picking a slightly firmer avocado. Also try mixing the rest of the ingredients first and then folding the avocado in. I've done this with great results.

A little sour -- I added a bit of sugar to the dressing, and added some cherry tomatoes for color.  Nice light salad.

My husband complimented salad...?!  After I checked if he had a fever (nope), I took a bite.  Yum!  I even had to use dried cilantro and bottled lemon and lime juices.  Boy, this one was different!

This was quick, easy and delicious. I would have preferred to use garlic powder, as the fresh was a little bit overpowering. I would also like to try it without the cilantro. Unlike most salads, this really is best served chilled. Thanks!

This was a big hit with guests. Everybody loved it! I removed the seeds from the cucmber, which enhanced the crunchy texture. Try it with the "Anaheim Fish Tacos" from this site - unbelievable!

OMG! This salad is refreshingly awesome. I could have eaten the whole bowl. Super easy to prepare. Don't use overly ripe avocado though. I used a firm one which cubed up nicely. The lemon and lime juice tenderize it just enough after all mixed together :)

This was a refreshing and filling salad.  I cut everything in half since I was making it just for me.  I took other reviewers' advice and cut up the cucumbers, placed them in a paper-towel lined bowl (I used the same bowl I planned to eat the salad out of) and I salted the cucumbers and let them sit overnight to drain in the fridge. I'm glad I did that, the paper towels were saturated in the morning!  When leaving for work I put everything in the bowl except for the lemon, lime & avocado.  I added them approx. 45 minutes before I planned to eat my lunch in the office.  I had some grape tomatoes with me so I added them right before I ate the salad too.  Very good!  I will make this again!!

I would never think of pairing these two, but it worked very well. Great picnic food. One caution: eat it the same day. Our leftovers were watery the next morning and very unappealing.

I really liked this. I used English seedless cucumbers and left the peel on. The salad was very refreshing. My lemon juice was already squeezed, so I just did 2 tsp., and that worked fine. I added salt to taste and left out the black pepper. I didn't add the optional green onion, either. I got 4-5 servings and we ate it right after it was prepared. TY

Really enjoyed this salad. Made it twice, the first time I ate it minutes after putting it together. The second I let everything except the avocado sit together for a couple of hours, then I added the avocado and let that sit for another 30 minutes or so. I liked it better giving it a little time to sit as it gives the citrus juice time to soften a little with the cucumber. Next I want to try it with some chopped fresh tomatoes.

This is an fine recipe although misnamed since the cilantro overwhelms all other ingredients. It should be titled Tangy Cilantro Cucumber and Avocado Salad. I'm going to try substitutes to the cilantro and feel confident that the results will be fantastic.

Yum, Yum, Yum!  DS and I loved this fresh summer salad.  From the crisp crunch of the cucumbers, the creaminess of the avocados, the zing from the spices and the tang of the lemon and lime juice, this "quick" put together salad has all the flavors blending wonderfully.  Thanks Jessie Welch for sharing your recipe!  Did I mention we really liked it?

This is so simple, but so tasty.  I omitted the cilantro since we don't care for it so I added a bit of fresh basil.  It was a perfect counterpoint to a cheddar broccoli quiche.  Thanks Jesse, this is a keeper.

This salad was awesome, and so quick to throw together.  I did not have cilantro,and am not a big fan, so I left it out.  I also only had red onion, so used that instead of green onions.  It is crunchy and so fresh tasting.  It was just the thing to go with the Chipolte Turkey burgers from this site.  I know I will make this often.  Thanks for sharing.

This was delicious. I used a bit more green onions than were called for and did not use the full amount of lemon/lime juice (only 1/4 tsp lemon juice mixed in directly with the avocados to keep them from browning). Instead I served the salad with lemon and lime wedges and allowed my guests to add the juice individually to suite their tastes. 

I would definitely make this again! I now prefer it to guacamole.

This was delicious!!  I was looking for a different salad to add to my recipes, and this was yummy!  I did soak the avocado in some of the lemon juice for about 10-15 minutes before I added it to the rest of the ingredients.  I'm happy to say that doing that kept it from turning brown and ugly for 2 days afterwards.  I'm not sure how long it would have worked, but the salad was gone by then. ;)

This is a very easy to make and extremely tasty salad that goes well with chicken & probably any picnic/cookout type menu.  Use seedless cukes or de-seed them yourself so it doesn't get too watery, and throw in some grape/cherry tomatoes, (whichever are smaller) for a pop of color and to add a subtly sweet flavor to this vibrant dish.  YUMMO!!

Thanks for the "base".  I didn't have lemon, but zested the lime and added with fresh ground pepper.  I mixed in a large salad bowl with fresh spring mix, and added a tablespoon of olive oil to create a lovely dressing.  I decided to NOT add tomatoes as other reviewers recommended, as I thought the presentation of different hues of green were wonderful. If tart is not your thing, use only half a lime.  It's plenty and with the zest, still very bright and citrusy.  Oh, and my husband loves cucumbers...I don't!  Still wonderful salad.  Thank you!

This was a awesome salad. Like previous people suggested, I waited until the end until adding the avocadoes. I also added purple onions for color and a couple red romas as well. The flavor was wonderful and it kept through the night. I will make this again!

I loved this salad except for the cilantro.  Instead, I used Tony's creole seasoning and didn't add the garlic or pepper.  After reading the reviews I decided to chill the avacados before cutting them up.  To minimize the need to stir I layered cucumbers, a sprinkling of Tony's, halved grape tomatoes, more Tony's, onion and avacado, Tony's, then squeezed on the lime and lemon.  It only took a light toss to thoroughly mix it and the avacados didn't get mushy.  My husband is not crazy about avacados, but he loved this salad!

Very refreshing and taste great on top of Chicken Enchilada II (from this site). I used lemon & lime juice from a bottle, I know, I know, it's not the same but it still worked and I didn't have to run to the store.

I loved this salad, I was looking for something a little different to serve with butter chicken. (Something a bit cooling :P) The simplicity is what makes this a winner. Great for my picky, dieting family. Fresh, natural and tasty! I might dial back the cilantro a little next time.

This is such a refreshing salad. I had to leave out the onions because I didn't have any. I think they would only make it better.  It is very tangy but I like that sort of thing. If you don't, I suggest cutting out the lemon or use less of the lemon and lime.

I made this for a block party, and I don't think anyone touched it for the way it looked. I made this a couple of hours before hand, and it looked watered down. Maybe I will try using basalmic vinegar next time..

Not a lot of flavor.  Possibly adding some balsamic vinegar would help or more salt and pepper.  Wasn't impressed but felt healthy eating it!

This recipe was FABULOUS!!!!!! I had to halve the recipe because we didn't want the avocado in the fridge overnight, but followed it exactly otherwise. Tasted so fresh and the cucumber really gave some great flavor to the avocado. This is going to be a regular in my house, thank you so much for posting!

I'm always looking for fresh vegetarian or vegan dishes and this one is fabulous. I loved the contrast in crunch from the cucumbers and creamy avacados. The lemon and limes juices were terrifically balanced.  DH and I split this for dinner one night- very filling and satisfying.

easy to make, refreshing--perfect for summer! I'm a cilantro nut so I probably used more than called for in the recipe but I feel like this is one where you can play with the balance (I think I used more lime too!)...delish!! =)

This was easy to make, but I felt something was missing, so I added a little sugar and about a teaspoon or so of balsamic vinegar.

I made this for a b-day part BBQ yesterday and it was a HUGE hit. I did substitute red onion and used a little bit of kosher salt plus table salt, but otherwise followed the recipe. This is a good, yummy, easy recipe and easily tweaked to mood/taste. I cannot wait for my garden cucumbers to come in as that will surely make this even more delicious!

This was a wonderful way to use my over-abundant garden cucumbers.  I was a bit skeptical about just using the lemon/lime juice as a dressing, but the flavor was fresh and tangy.

Easy breezy, yet full of flavors. Very filling too, a great side for a hot summer BBQ. I mixed the cilantro with mint (both herbs are prolific in my herb containers) and taste yummy. Thank you for sharing the recipe.

I have to say WOW!! I was really amazed at how much I liked this salad....it didn't sound so great to me at 1st...but I read the reviews, so I thought...let's do this! I cut the recipe in half, that's all the cucumber and avacado I had on hand for it. It is super healthy and delish! I also added 1/2 tomato finely diced. Gave it some color and tastes great. Thanks for posting!

I made a half batch of this for myself and ate the whole thing.  DELICIOUS, SIMPLE AND EASY!!!  I love how I can throw this together and it taste amazing.  I really like the lemon/lime juice mixed with the cilantro.  Wouldn't change a thing!

Followed the recipe to the letter except for black pepper since some of my family have bad reactions to that.  This was very easy, very refreshing and a great addition to summer options.  I followed the advise of other reviewers to make sure you have firm avocados that aren't overripe.  I had no problem with browning of the avocado.  Will make again & again.

This salad is so good!  I made it exactly by the recipe; however, I followed a suggestion from a previous reviewer, which I think is necessary.  Mix your entire salad together except for the avocado.  Add it at the very end, so that it won't be mushy.  One other suggestion is that I didn't taste the green onions at all.  Maybe next time, I will try adding a white onion for additional flavor.

Exceptional.  A fantastic side dish for a Mexican dinner as an alternative to guacamole.  Or simply by itself.  I added a splash of red wine vinegar.

This recipe is the reason I love this site... well a good example of why. I would never have thought to put together this combination, in fact to me it sounded a little odd, but I LOVE this! I may have put a little too much citrus in it, but other than that this was a great salad! A little like guacamole but more alive if that makes any sense, I will be making this salad many more times!

Loved this salad!!  Used a large English cuke with the skin on....2 limes  and 1/2 lemon juiced and used fresh dill instead of the cilantro since that is what I had on hand. The garlic and the green onions really add extreme flavor. Served this with Spicy Lime Grilled Shrimp and loved this dinner tonight! Thanks!

This had a nice mexican flavor to it that I enjoyed. It really accented the sweetness of the avocados, but for me the cucumber just didn't work with the avocado and cilantro. Way too much cilantro as written for me. This was tangy and I liked that too. This was very fresh tasting. Thanks, I had fun making and trying this new dish.

This was good. The only thing I changed was to switch the green onions for some minced red onion and a little less cilantro. It took on more of a consistency of guacamole when it was mixed with the lemon & lime juices, so I would suggest waiting until time to eat to add the avocado. The flavors were really good and overall enjoyable. I also added some sliced grape tomatoes for color.

This wasn't very tasty to me.  This may be just my taste buds but the cucumber and avocado didn't match well together.  I won't make this again.  I am sure others like the taste.  Sorry.

A bit of an odd taste - I definitely liked it better the next day when it was really chilled. It was a great way to use up our avocado. I would make this again.

My family loves this salad.  The first time I made it I followed the recipe exactly.  It was good.  Since then, I adapted it to satisfy our taste buds.  I use two cucumbers, four avocados, four cloves of garlic, four entire green onions, two small limes and one large lemon.  I omit the cilantro.  I salt and pepper to taste.  No adult has ever not liked/loved it.  Kids don't care for the green onions (at least my grandchildren don't like them) so they skip the salad.  My kudos to  Jessie Welch.  This is a great recipe.

Super easy & yummy!  I did add 1 cup of grape tomatoes, cut in half and used bacon salt rather than plain salt.  I couldn't stay out of it - I kept sampling.

I made this using just a half of an avocado, and scaled down the other ingredients accordingly. Used cilantro in a tube, that I had on hand and also jarred-type garlic. Both worked well here. All lime juice, no lemon. Refreshing salad and something different using avocado instead of guacamole.

This did not go well.  The consistency was an issue between the two main ingredients together for my family.  No one enjoyed the flavors.  Won't make it again but it is definitely worth a try.

Loved the taste and the texture. What a delightful little salad and so simple to make. I understand some people may not like the color, but the taste alone is fantastic! If you want some extra color add red onion or a tomato. But definitely do try this sweet little salad.

I made this as a side for my bean and cheese enchiladas. It is a great summer recipe. The flavors all go together quite nicely. I made 1/2 a recipe as it's just me in the house and I didn't want to be eating this for days on end. Cutting the recipe in half still gave me about 4 side dish size servings (about 2/3 cup per serving). I will definitely make this again.

We always seem to have the odd avocado, lime, and bunch of cilantro rolling around the vegetable bin, so I threw together a half-portion of this [so easy to do with the portion adjustment button!]  We both loved it, and will certainly be making the full amount next time.  I do agree with other reviewers - leave the avocado out until everything else is mixed together, and then just gently toss it in.  The flavors are great!

I LOVE this recipe! It was a huge hit at the BBQ, and someone even asked me for the recipe! The flavors were awesome, so fresh and tangy. The great thing is that the lemon preserved the avocado in the fridge so it was delicious the next day. This recipe is definitely a fave!

I made this twice. It was a huge hit with my young kids and with the guests at the picnic. I accidentally forgot the garlic the second time. It wasn't as good. I didn't have the green onions either time.

We liked a lot, Mom loves cucumbers and the Hubby loves Avocados. The 2 main ingredients  work well together, creamy, crunchy , and so full of flavor. Easy to make and suited to taking to an outing or picnic. I will be using this recipe again.

This ran in Allrecipes magazine, as part of a Mexican story. I served it with Veracruz-Style Red Snapper (http://allrecipes.com/recipe/228046/veracruz-style-red-snapper/), though I actually used cod because fish market didn't have snapper. Fresh and delicious.

This recipe needs to be tweaked somewhat.  A dash of spice, add some peppers..something.  Just okay.  Green onions and garlic added flavor, but it could use a little something to spice it up.  Little on the bland side for my liking.

Made this for Thanksgiving. Everyone loved it, even my husband who hates avocado! I let the cucumbers drain for about an hour before mixing in ingredients, and didn't add the avocado until right before I served it.. I added tomatoes for color and a little red onion as well. To top it off I mixed in bacon bits and that was the kicker! Loved it!!!

Very crisp and fresh and delicious! Thank you. I'm already planning to take this to a Christmas party. I used home grown Armenian cucumbers from my dads garden. Very yummy! Thank you.

This recipe was phenomenal. I added some dijon and cumin and it added a nice kick to it.

I thought this was a very good, fresh tasting, light salad.  I cut the recipe in half, except for the garlic and cilantro, which I kept the same.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, Jessie Welch!

I followed directions and it was screaming for fresh tomatoes from the garden.  Once I included that, it was perfect - so 4 and half stars.

I make this frequently, often served with Mexican food. It is a very light and refreshing salad, perfect for summer. Whenever I've shared it at a potluck, I've had requests for the recipe.

Great recipe! I used frozen garlic and frozen cilantro cubes and everyone loved it. My 3 year old niece who won't eat anything but peanut butter sandwiches said it was the "best salad [she] ever tasted. Thank you!

Just loved this.  I had no onion and did not miss it. Added about a tablespoon of diced red capsicum just for colour. Took note of other posts and was careful about stirring in the avocado.  Great comments from guests and will definitely make again.

This is surprisingly good. Very simple fresh flavors. I used 4 lemon-cucumbers instead of regular cucumbers and loved it. I'll definitely make this again.

Terrific summer recipe and easy, too. I added canned corn to it once and grated carrot another time. This time I'll add both for my vegetarian daughter-in-law especially.

I love this salad.  Its the best way to use cucumbers from the garden.  It doesn't keep for very long but its so easy to make, you can make small batches in no time.

This is delicious and perfect for summer.  I skipped the cilantro (I just don't like it) and added a ripe chopped tomato.  Drained sone of the juices before serving.  Great!

I cut the recipe in half as there are only 2 of us and ended up with less than a whole avocado. The texture would have been better with more but the tangy lime and the chopped jalapeno I added made it terrific anyway.  So fresh, crunchy and cool...went great with grilled turkey hot Italian sausage and corn on the cob.

Very good...and I'm not a fan of cucumber. I put a bit too much cilantro for my taste but it was still really good. I also added halved cherry tomatoes.

Amazing!!! The whole family loved it! I omitted the garlic (as I don't like the taste of raw garlic) and added 2 largely chopped roma tomatoes. We ate the salad on tostadas. Thanks for the recipe!!!

Really enjoyed this quick to make side.  The recipe was reduced to 2 servings and a light sprinkle of cumin added.  The flavors nicely complimented an Indian dish that this was served with.

This is a very refreshing summer side. It is probably best over fish or tossed with lettuce. With similar ingredients, I think I would rather make an avocado/mango salsa or guacamole though.

LOVED LOVED LOVED this recipe!  I agree with the other members, make sure you use avocados that are not overly ripe, they are too mushy when overripe.  Also, I added grape tomatoes cut in half to this recipe.  I will be making this recipe again and again!

I love how basic the ingredients are... no soy bean oil dressings or anything just a basic good for you salad.. the only place the calories are coming from is the avocado... but it is also contains loads of fiber... what a great recipe... looks a little green... but green is good right

I love avocado and cilantro, so I thought this would be a sure 5 star, but it was merely refreshing. It has a nice flavor but really would work much better as a topping on something (like chicken or on a wrap).

I had to make this without the avocado b/c my fiance bought rock-hard unripened avocados for me. :-( Still this has really good flavor as just a cucumber salad, I will be trying this again soon w/ the avocados.

I found it yummy, despite the fact that I am not a big cucumber fan.  I added a little white onion to the mix.  A little heat, perhaps a jalapeno or some cayenne powder, would probably make it taste even better.

My only disappointment with this recipe is that I did not make more!  I mixed all the ingredients except the avocado first, then gently tossed in the avocado.  No slime and it looked appetizing.  YUM!

Yummalicious!!! I made this without the cilantro because I didn't have it, and used only lemon juice but also added hot sauce and instead of fresh cilantro, I had ground corriander powder - so I added a tiny bit of that.  Even with these changes, the salad was delicious and is fresh and crunchy with the cucumbers.  The hot sauce gives it a nice added kick!!

I thought this was delicious! I used basil instead of cilantro (I HATE cilantro), and used kosher salt. I folded in the avocado at the very end, and next time, I think I will skip the refrigeration wait period (though in summer, that would be good). Great job Jessie! It is a nice change from the usual.

What a refeshing treat!  I only had one avocado so I diced a large tomato into the salad to stretch it.  It tasted great and gave the dish a beautiful color, too.  Also, I couldn't get fresh cilantro so I used fresh italian parsley.  Forgot to add the garlic, but it was still fabulous without it.  I'll be sure to add it next time, since we love garlic.  My husband loved it, and he's not much of a salad eater.  Thanks for a great recipe!  I'm sure to make this one again and again.

I wanted to make just enough for two, so I used 1/3 large cucumber and 2 small avocados.  I tried to have an equal ratio of avocado and cucumber.  This is a refreshing tangy summer salad and a nice departure from lettuce or other greens.  I didn't have green onions, so I used a small amount of chopped red onion, 1/2 lime and 1/2 small lemon.  Amount of citrus can be adjusted to taste.  Awesome salad!

I liked it.  Simple to make and good as a side.  I'm imagining it as a main dish with white beans and provolone...yum!  Definitely add the onions, otherwise it will be a little bland.

I had high hopes for this recipe because I love both cucumbers and avacados. I was disappointed with how this recipe turned out. It wasn't as tasty as I had imagined. You cannot have any leftovers, as they will be runny and mushy the next day.

I adore this recipe!  I needed a simple and fresh salad for dinner tonight, and this fits the bill perfectly.  I did opt to leave the green onions out and use a bit more lemon juice, but still the flavors are amazing.  This is my new go-to summer salad recipe.

What a delightful summer dish! The lemon and lime really play up the avocado and cucumber's flavors. I especially love the green onions in there. I followed the recipe exactly, but like in anything I make, I left out the salt. Well done, Jessie!

I love this salad.  I did add a red pepper to the salad because it seemed a bit bland since I didn't have any lemon juice.  Yum!  A very healthy and satisfying salad!!

This recipe was great. I used the salad for a progressive dinner in our neighborhood where he main course was chili.  I did not use as much Cilantro as requested and I added a small amount of red onion. I also left a stip of he cucumber on to add color to the dish.  It was a hit!!!!Definately will use again!!

This was decent - more of a summer dish because it's cold and refreshing. The lime/lemon flavor was a little too much, it seemed like that's all I tasted. But it was easy and healthy.

Was a great recipe.  I only used half the cilantro recommended.  I used fresh cilantro and even with only half it still packed a punch with the salad. The lemon and lime both tied the avacado and cucumber together.

I wasn't sure about this recipe, but I wanted something different to use up the cukes from my garden.  It turned out really good!  I followed the recipe just as it is.  It was good the next day, too.  Next time I may take some suggestions from other reviewers and add tomatoes and/or cumin.  I served it with Jalapeno Chicken from this site.

This was fantastic! I added a couple of chopped roma tomatoes and used minced red onion instead of the green onion, but followed the rest of the recipe and absolutely LOVED it. Will definitely make again. Thank you!
