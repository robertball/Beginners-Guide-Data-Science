Excellent.  First tofu sandwich I've tried.  I tried this with silken tofu because that's what I had on hand, and it's fine, but the regular kind is better--has a better texture.  Mine took longer under the broiler than this recipe says--just go till it looks good.  It has a a bit of a tang to it, and I'm not sure if that's the vinegar in the marinade, or the tofu itself.  But it was good.  Oh, and I didn't use wine because I didn't have it, so I use broth.

I agree with the other reviewer and this needs more time under the broiler. I never was able to get it as crisp as I would have liked but the flavor is really good.
