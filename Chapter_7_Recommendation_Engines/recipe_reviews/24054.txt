Tastes like Magic Shell!  Even better than the original!  I heated the ingredients in the micro. for 60 seconds on high and stirred until blended.  I dished up ice cream in bowls, poured on this sauce and stuck it in the freezer for 5 mins. to speed up the hardening process.

I think I might try using 1/3c milk and 1/3 semi sweet next time. The consistency is more like a ganache than like the crackle shell. It does not get quite as hard, but overall this recipe tastes very good over ice cream and I could see it having many other applications to come in my kitchen.

So easy and fast to make with stuff you already have in the pantry!  I was looking for a quick chocolate sauce to go with our vanilla icecream for our dessert tonight and didnt want to run to the store.  This was the only recipe on the site that I had the ingrediants for! It was a bit thick as others have said, but it all just depends on what you want to use it for.  I did thin ours out just a bit with a tablespoon or so of milk.  It's a keeper!

This was the perfect "sauce" for what I needed.  I made a bowling ball cake and iced it with the chocolate shell.  Easy to work with and way tastier than fondant.

OMG - LOVE IT! I always loved magic shell but it's full of hydrogenated fats.  Obviously this is not a health food but I feel more comfortable with using plain, wholesome butter - and besides, it's to die for.  Thank you so much for the recipe!

Quick,easy and delicious!  This sauce can also be used for strawberries!  Just let it cool a little, dip the strawberries, and let chill in the fridge for a few minutes.

Been meaning to try this sauce for a while...let me say YUM! I had it over peanut ice cream and oh gosh it was good. It hardened up perfectly, exactly like the shell sauce from the grocery store! I'm gonna use this recipe from  now on.

This turned out perfect, it hardened just like the magic shell.  I poured this over a turtle cheesecake I made and it was beautiful. This was exactly what I was looking for.  Thanks

So easy - so good! I added a capful of peppermint extract to make it a chocolate peppermint sauce. Poured it over a banana sliced vertically and some ice cream for a wonderful peppermint chocolate banana split!

This recipe was perfect if it's just about how quick and beautiful the chocolate looked when it hardened. Taste wise however, it was pretty bitter.

This is much better than the ice-cream shop's shell sauce!  It is a favorite of my son's (and mine!) and he'll eat any ice cream with this sauce on it.

Very good sauce. I added a tablespoon of brewed coffee to help thin. I like it with the sauce with the coffee in it better!

I tried this recipe when my son asked for ice cream cones instead of cake for his birthday party. It was a hit!!!!
We made the cones, dipped them into the pan of sauce and let them stand for a couple of min. to let the sauce harden. I 'd suggest letting the sauce cool a little since the heat of the sauce melted the ice cream a little so it wasn't all smooth and pretty. Otherwise it was great! Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent recipe, thank you for sharing!  I added a bit of milk to thin out the sauce.  It was delicious with ice cream.  I have also drizzled the shell sauce over home made coffee cheesecake and it was delicious.  Yummy!

I loved this recipe and used it as a base. I added some room temperature milk ( about a quarter cup because I still wanted the shell to be thick), substituted a bit of semi sweet chocolate chips and added pinch of sea salt. Also instead of a microwave I preheated my oven to 350 and cut up the butter just so it would melt nicely and put it along with the chocolate in an oven safe pyrex bowl and left it for 3-5 mins. I took it out and stirred in the milk added the  sea salt, it was perfect!! I used it to make chocolate covered ice cream cones where I used the sauce to coat the ice cream portion of the cone. *Priceless Hint: Pistachio ice cream covered in chocolate shell = la petite mort. I was going to add pics but sadly the cones did not make it.

A local ice cream stand used to serve chocolate dipped ice cream with a topping that hardened but was softer and more flavorful than what most places use. Unfortunately, they recently switched to the same crackly topping that everyone else has, so I decided to find a recipe to make my own. I suspected butter was the key, and it was! I wish I'd thought to make this sooner--cheaper and more convenient than going out. Now that I can make this any time I want it, my figure may never be the same again...

This recipe was exactly what I needed to top a cheesecake- it was easy and came out tasting so good. I added about a tablespoon of milk to make it a bit thinner, like other commenters. Overall a really quick, easy recipe that is USEFUL and a must have for everyone's recipe box!

This was really good,  I used a blend of semi-sweet, dark, and white chocolate chips since thats what I had on hand.  Only problem is it was a little thicker then I would have liked and I ate way too much.

It's a very easy recipe and works well when you need chocolate sauce in a snap without lots of ingredients. Overall, it tastes okay.

I made this to go on my flourless chocolate cake (from this site) and ice cream and strawberries. It is very good, and sooo easy. Way better than the bottle stuff.

Although it is a bit thick, the flavor is fabulous!  Much better than the storebought kind.  I might try thinning it with a bit of milk next time.

Quick and easy, using simple ingredients you probably already have at home. Works just as well as Hershey's/Smuckers Shells, but it's significantly healthier relative to the chocolate sauce group (hashtag team butter). Could be a little sweeter (maybe mix in some milk chocolate) and a littler thinner (maybe add a touch of milk).

Why buy it at the grocery store when it's this easy to make from ingredients that I always have on hand?

Super easy! I added a tablespoon or two of light brown sugar just to sweeten a bit more. I then heavily drizzle it over some biscotti I made out of a couple of day old pound cakes I had left over. It was a hit with the family.
