I am confused, do you prepare the pudding mix? Or just use the powder?  I have tried it both ways!

This is a family tradition at our house. I make this on Christmas Eve and keep in the fridge overnight (to prevent over-rising). Christmas morning I let it set at room temperature for 45 minutes, or until double. I use Rhodes Frozen Roll dough 24 and cut them in half. Roll them in the dry cook and serve pudding.(sprinkle remaining dry pudding over the top of rolls). I melt 1/2 C. butter and 1/2 C brown sugar in the microwave to make a syrup and pour that over the top. This recipe is fabulous, thank you for sharing!

For everyone that's confused about "sprinkle the pudding mix", think about it.  It's pretty clear on what you need to do...sprinkle...the...pudding...mix.  Not make the pudding. Why would anyone sprinkle a made pudding...that doesn't even make sense.

Yummy!  These were great.  Everyone loved them.  Also, I added pecans and made frosting to go over them (2 cups powdered sugar, 3 tbsp. melted butter, 1/2 tsp. vanilla & 3 tbsp. milk) and they were definitely a hit.  Will make again!

first of all, let's give credit to the Best of Bridge cookbooks that this recipe came out of. Secondly, I have prepared this recipe no less than 100 times, and except for the time I apparently had a little too much egg nog on Xmas eve and forgot the melted butter....it never fails!! I usually add pecans. This has been used for over 25 years in our house for Xmas, birthday sleepovers, family brunch. I would NEVER make it for just my husband and myself now! I'd eat the whole thing!

I have been making monkey bread for years but this one is the best because of ease of making and the addition of the vanilla pudding mix!  Rhodes frozen dinner rolls were fantastic in my recipe - a welcome break from canned biscuit dough.  I used the quick thaw method & proofed the entire bundt after layering in the oven.  (To do this, preheat to 200 degrees, microwave dough balls for 30 seconds each side; layer recipe as directed; put dough in and turn the oven OFF; wait a couple of hours; bake as directed.)  I love the sprinkling & layering - so easy!  Who knew???  I did use more butter.  This one will be a staple at our house!

I AGREE WITH THE OTHER REVIEWER.  LESSEN THE BR. SUGAR.  IT HAS MORE OF A STRUDEL TOPPING THAN A CARMELLY ONE.  IT WAS GOOD BUT TOO MUCH SUGAR FOR THE AMOUNT OF BUTTER.  THERE WAS A CRYSTALLY (SUGARY)CONSISTENCY TO THE TOPPING.  VERY TASTY, BUT IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A "CARAMEL" TOPPING DON'T MAKE THIS ONE. SOMEONE SUGGESTED POURING THE BUTTER OVER IT IN THE MORNING, SO THE SUGAR DOESN'T SIT IN IT ALL NIGHT.  DOES ANYONE AGREE WITH ME?

I made this Christmas morning - hoping it would turn out because I hadn't tried it before.  It was perfect!  I had to use an 8x8 pan because I didn't have a bundt pan but it worked great, thanks for the recipe!

These are great, however, I prefer to use butterscotch pudding mix instead of vanilla.  Try it!

These were so easy and fantastic. I added 3/4 c. chopped walnuts and put them in pan first.  I also used 1/2 c. butter and made a glaze for the top that I added right before serving.  The glaze was 1 c. sifted powdered sugar, 1t. vanilla extract, & 1+ T. Milk. I kept adding milk until I reached the right "drizzling" consistency.

I get so excited when a new recipe turns out as well as this one did! Don't change a thing! I can't believe how beautiful, easy and delicious this was! My only regret is that I didn't get a picture of this masterpiece before my guests devoured it!

OK this will be a new Christmas morning tradition in our house, so easy and DELICIOUS!  I followed the recipie pretty much, ecept I rolled the rolls in the cinnamon and the vanilla pudding mix and then dumped the extra on top.  Melted 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup butter and poured over the top.  Next time I will try with Pecans and I many try cutting the rolls in half..... just to keep me from eating so much! :)

Absolutely SUPER! Used a 9x13 pan cause I don't have a bunt pan and only made 12.  Turned out fantastic and I got a big hug from my daughter for making her fresh cinnamon buns in the morning.  No need to tell her it was no trouble at all right?

Excellent and very easy!  I did use pecans instead of raisins.  They were a big hit.  I also had to bake them a tad longer.  This is a definite keeper!

This was so easy and so delicious!  It would be easy to add nuts as well.  I didn't read that it has to sit overnight so I ended up having them ready for dinner rather than breakfast, but they were still just as tastey!  Don't let them sit too long or the buns will rise and overflow.  Thanks for sharing this!

LOVE this recipe! I've made it a few times and always get great responses. For the rolls, I make a dough in my bread machine, form it into 16 rolls, freeze for a couple of hrs. on a cookie sheet, then follow recipe. I also make a simple icing of icing sugar and milk and drizzle that on top after baking. Thanks for this yummy and simple recipe!

Love, LOVE, LOVE this recipe.  I don't put the pudding mix in, find it gives it a 'commercial' taste, just the brown sugar and cinnamon is the best, I bake them a little longer so the buns in the center aren't so gooey, if the outside buns get to brown I cover it with tin foil, every special occasion calls for these buns, sooooo delicious

Mine did not look like the picture at all. It rose way too high, and all the cinnamon sank to the bottom (which ended up being the top after you flipped it.) Then as it cooled it deflated. I layered sugar and butter on bottom, middle and top - so I'm not sure how I could do it different next time?  Obviously I'll need to let it rise less. It was 12 hours by the time we got it in the oven. Hmmm, I really want to get this to work.

Yummy. I couldn't find the rolls so I used one loaf of bread dough. I thawed it in the fridge for a few hours then cut it into about 12 peices, then followed the rest of the recipes exactly as described. This is a new Christmas breaskfast tradition at our house.

they were okay. Maybe I did something wrong. They came out HUGE and half the filling fell to the bottom of the oven. They weren't gooey like I expected either. Will possibly try again with fewer rolls and melt the sugar and butter together.

I made this for Christmas morning and my family just loved them.  I made the glaze suggested by one of the reviewers and they were excellent.  The recipe is supposed to serve 12 and 6 of us finished them in one meal.  I can't believe how easy they were.  I highly recommend them!

We love these!!! We used frozen bread dough cause that's what I had. Let it thaw overnight then cut off little pieces like the dinner roll size. Put everything in the pan and let it rise for like an hour. It filled the whole pan with just the one loaf (I had doubted that it would). We also added pecans instead of the raisins. Might try both next time. There will definately be a next time!!

I prepare this EXACTLY and it turns out perfectly every time. It goes perfectly when I'm making a slow-cooker meal because I can toss it together in the morning at the same time and it's ready for me to bake it that evening. This recipe is actually in a published "allrecipes" book, fyi.

I have made this for about 10 years, or so. I was given the recipe by a friend, but they called it "Sticky Mickeys" as it was a recipe from Disney World.   Great, easy recipe!!!!

Very good and so easy to make!   I did tweak the recipe a bit and used more butter and added a little nutmeg. Definitely becoming a favorite in our household!

These were good, but I don't think I would make them again due to the extreme sweetness that has made me a bit ill...lol. I did have to bake them longer than stated as the ones in the middle of the 13 x 9 pan weren't cooked through. I didn't have a bundt pan, so I did use the 13 x 9, but I might suggest using less dinner rolls as they rise like crazy!

This recipes was delicious, but I think one small change would improve it a great deal.  If you sprinkle 1/3 of the sugar mixture in before the dough goes in, then only add 1/2 the dough, then 1/3 more of the mixture, then the remaining dough and remaining sugar, that would eliminate a problem that I ran into - a lot of the sugar and raisins ended up clumped together at the bottom after you turn it out onto a serving plate rather than evenly spread throughout the dish.  It was still delicious though, and so easy!

This is a wonderful recipe. The only thing I would suggest, is that you use "Freshly Bought" frozen rolls. If you have some in the freezer too long, they dont rise as they should. Otherwise, the recipe is a real keeper. Thanks for sharing.

I have been having these buns for years as a family tradition on Christmas morning. It's easy and so tasty! I'm teaching my children how to prepare them now, the same way my mother taught me. I usually just place my buns in the oven to rise over night, even if they overrise it has never effected to flavours of the buns

Wow!  These are amazing! It's our new Christmas and holiday breakfast tradition.  I use 1/2 cup of butter, otherwise they're a little dry.  I also use less frozen rolls, about 12, so they have more goo.  Try it with cream cheese frosting-yummy!

I was expecting alot more "gooey and rich". The kids loved them and they went over well, but I think it needs more of the topping. It would be interesting to try doubling the topping and see how it would work. Like other post I used thawed frozen bread dough and cut it into little pieces and allowed it to rise for a couple of hours. So quick and easy to do.

Yummy!  However, I'm not sure why some thought these were too sweet.  I didn't use raisins so that might be partly why I didn't get that overwhelmingly sweet taste.  I cut down on the sugar and added more butter but wished I had more of the topping so next time I will add all the sugar and add a little more butter.  The good thing about the topping is that it runs off when you turn the buns out of the pan, then you can just pour as much of that mixture as you like back onto the buns.  I did use the icing recipe from the "Clone of a Cinnabon" recipe from this site.  For that I would add a little more milk so that it doesn't get stiff like cake icing.  Then I was trying to get the same taste as the Caramel Pecanbon from Cinnabon, so after I put the white icing on, I drizzled a little caramel over that and topped with pecans.  It was too good to be so easy!  This would make a great addition to a brunch menu.  However, I'll probably cut the recipe in half when I make it just for my family as it made quite a bit.

Very good recipe!  If you use frozen bread dough - ONE loaf really is enough.  I was doubtful and had a mess in the morning.
I used a bundt pan, decreased the brown sugar to 2/3 c., increased the pudding mix, and substituted pecans.  In the future, I will use 1/2 c. brown sugar and 1/4 c. white sugar (to decrease the crunchy/hardness factor).  I will put 1/2 a stick of melted butter on it the night before and add the remaining 1/2 stick that morning.

My friend and I made this recipe and it was terrible!!! Based on the reviews we must be doing something wrong. Were you really able to fit 20 frozen dinner size rolls in the bundt pan? Seems like too much sugar not enough butter. The rasins fell all the bottom. I assume you pile these rolls on top of one another. If so how does the topping adhere the bottom layers???? Help! I really want to make this correctly

This was great and easy! Nice to be able to put together the night before. I used a large package of pudding and a little more butter than called for in the recipe. I also cut the dough into smaller pieces so you had more to pull apart. I layered the dough and ingredients so all pieces had the good stuff, no dry bread. The family loved it!

These were good but they lacked something. I think they need more butter and less brown sugar. I would definitely recommend adding about 2/3 cup brown sugar instead of 1 cup so they aren't overpoweringly sweet! I would even suggest trying a powdered sugar frosting in place of the pudding mix. Anyways, with a few corrections, I think they would be great. They are very easy though and they would be fun to make with kids. I do give 5 stars for the name of the cinnamon buns!

YUMMY! Thank you Shannon.  My mom had tried one something like this where you rolled the frozen dough in butter, cinn & sugar.  She said it wasn't good at all.  Gave her some of these fresh out of the oven and ALL agree that they are delicious!  So I gave her a copy of THIS recipe.  I used pecans instead of raisins.  You could probably add most your favorite "add ons" to this and it would still be great.  Thanks again.

These are wonderful!  I make this twice a week at our house, but the kids want them every morning!  Really rich and gooey!  I put a handfull of the brown sugar in the pan before putting in the bread so that when you turn it over it flows over the whole thing!
To the previous poster...do not use full size frozen dinner rolls.  Use the frozen dough balls (about the size of a walnut.)  You should be able to find them in the same area in your supermarket, next to frozen bread dough!

My family loved this!  I made this for Christmas morning.  All the stores were out of the frozen dinner rolls and vanilla pudding so I substituted refrigerated biscuit dough and french vanilla pudding.  I prepared everything the night before (except the butter)and placed the pan in the refrigerator.  The next morning I poured the melted butter  over everything and baked it. Still, it came out great.

I gave the job of preparing this recipe to my 10 and 6 year old children.  It was easy for them to make, with delicious results that anyone would love!  It's similar to monkey bread, and I omitted the raisins.  We'll definitely make it again!

I took these to work and everyone raved and loved them!!!!  I used butterscotch pudding mix instead and pecans instead of raisins. Also couldn't find frozen dinner rolls so used 2 loaves of frozen bread dough.  I thawed them for a little bit on the counter and then sliced them into about 8 slices per loaf.  I think next time I will slice them even more to make it more like a pull apart bread.

We've had this every Christmas morning for the past 3 years and LOVE it!  I love that it's egg-free, and can be made to taste (and health ;) ) so it's a good treat for young kids.  It's so so easy, too - I throw it together quickly the night before, stick it in the oven before the kids open presents, and it's done when they are - perfect!!  Thanks so much for a great recipe!

I'm a little torn on this one.  First of all, my dough overflowed my pan overnight!  I don't know why.  I followed the recipe exactly.  It was a little underdone after 25 minutes.  I use an oven thermometer, so I know I had the temp. right.  I'm not sure.  It didn't have the texture or taste I was hoping for.  Thanks for posting!

Been using a recipe just like this for years now - a huge favorite for every holiday brunch.  Easy and my kids love to help make it.  I sometimes use butterscotch pudding but I prefer the vanilla.

These were so good and so easy!!  We put them together Christmas Eve night and breakfast was ready before everyone got up Christmas morning.  The only downside was the cinnamon seemed to be hit and miss - although we also left them in the pan rather than turning them out to help them stay warm.  Still a wonderful, and wonderfully easy treat!

I thought these were very tasty, but they seem really rich.  My son described it as 'they taste good, but after a few bites it starts getting to me'.  I had a similar feeling.  My daughter the sweet tooth diabetic LOVED them.  I appreciated how easy they were to make.

I visited my mom and she made this (she's also an allrecipes geek like me) for breakfast. What a hit! I love that the prep work is done the night before and you just pop it in the oven in the morning. The only thing I altered was to cut back on the sugar a little. Just a tad sweet for my family. We love it! :)

My husband and daughter love this recipe.  I love how easy it is to prepare and then leave it to sit overnight.  It's even easy enough to do on a weeknight.  Cinnamon rolls are usually a weekend thing for us, so my daughter thinks this is a special treat to get them during the week.  This is definitely a "keeper"!

I messed this up a little and it was still wonderful!!!  I let the dough rise way to long and it was a little difficult to get the damp towel off.  It was still de-lish!  I also topped it with store-bought vanilla frosting.  My only complaint is that it's a little awkward to cut and it's a little messy to eat (I know use a fork next time, huh??)  I think I might play around with the flavor of pudding next time.  Great recipe and VERY easy to make.

These were great!! And so simple. The only thing we changed was to omit the raisins, the kids don't prefer them in their cinnamon rolls.   My 11 year old son made these with no help from me.  We all loved them.  They are great warm from the oven and gooey, we put a powdered sugar, milk, vanilla topping on them when they came out of the oven, and ate them immediately.  Only one small piece was left and we warmed it up later....(excellent warmed up too). He will definately be making these again....Thanks for sharing.

This recipe was really easy to make and I liked it because I could just bake it in the morning.  I used less brown sugar, 1 stick of butter and added pecans instead of the raisins and it turned out great!  All the guys at work loved it!

My family loves this recipe!  We substitute butterscotch pudding mix (cook & serve, not instant) for vanilla and up the amount of butter to 1 stick and omit the raisins.  This "coffee cake" is very reminiscent of the Moravian Sugar Cake from the Old Salem area in North Carolina.  Simply delicious and incredibly easy!

Wow, these hit the spot on Sunday morning! The only thing I changed was to omit the raisins. This one is a keeper - it doesn't get much easier than this. Great for brunches or when you have company spending the night.

these are good but need an icing to make them great....easy to prepare but when you turn them out onto a plate be ready to eat them or the brown sugar will set up and it gets SUPER hard fast!!!i left out the raisins since my husband hates them.

This is very similar to a recipe I have made for years. Try using butterscotch pudding mix instead and also add chopped pecans. YUM!

I use butterscotch cook and serve pudding instead of vanilla. It’s easy... sprinkle on with the brown sugar.  I also cut the sugar in half.

Try placing chopped pecans in the bottom of the pan.  I used butterscotch instant pudding powder in place of vanilla and it was awesome.

My recipe is similar, with a few differences that address some of the negative comments I’ve read:

1)   I use 1/2 - 1 c. melted butter
2)  1 tbsp cinnamon (more or less depending on your taste) 
3)  Raisins and walnuts to taste....I just sprinkle over the buns until it looks ok..but much less than  3/4 cup.
4)  Place half of the buns in a sprayed bundt pan. Sprinkle with half of the other ingredients. Repeat layer. Cover with damp cloth. Leave on counter overnight.

In the morning, bake at 350o for 30-40 minutes or until lightly golden brown on top. Invert on a serving plate. Let stand 3 minutes. Remove bundt pan. Enjoy!

I have made this amazing recipe for years, I got it from a friend.  The only frozen buns available tome here are a little bigger so I use 17 of them instead of the 20.  I have assembled it in advance and before leaving it to rise I cover it with foil and freeze it and then just bring it out before I go to bead and it is perfect in the morning.  I have also forgotten the cinnamon and it is still wonderful.  The is a fave in our family and I have given it out many times.  I agree there may be too much sugar but I don't worry about it.

These were marvelous!  The only surprise I got was when I removed the damp cloth in the morning--they were enormous and were spilling out a little from my casserole dish.  I would recommend using a slightly bigger casserole dish than you would put the frozen rolls in. 

The end result was wonderful!  I made a batch with white icing and a batch with chopped pecans.  They were both a huge hit, so thank you!

Will make this over & over! Made the recipe to the tee... but... don't get me wrong I love sweet stuff, I think next will decrease brown sugar just a bit. There was a awful lot of the thick "crunchy" mixture in the bottom of pan & me & family were on a sugar buzz for a while after these. These were great & easy!

Really delicious recipe.  I took it a step further and dipped each roll in melted butter and then rolled them in the sugar mixture.  Yummy!  I also placed mine in a tube pan since many people had the problem of them rising out of their bundt pans...this worked like a charm -- a perfect fit.

This recipe is delicious and embarassingly easy!  I've made in the bundt pan, but it rose over the pan during the night.  I baked with a baking sheet underneath just to be sure.  The last time I tried in a 9x13 pan, and it worked perfectly.  Rich, buttery and divine.  This one's a keeper!

I made these two weekends in a row.  The first weekend for seven people and the next for 16.  Both times I couldn't make enough.  I mixed the brown sugar mixture well and put one row of rolls on the bottom of the pan then the mixture then another row of rolls.  I also used the icing recipe from another reviewer and they were spectacular.  This recipe also works by separating the rolls into two cake pans.

Delicious, easy breakfast treat! I made these Christmas morning for my fiance and our roomate and they got gobbled up. I panicked because I didn't have a bunt pan (thought I did, must have wandered off somewhere...) so I made it in a shallow, glass casserole dish. Only problem was that it rose so much that the buns stuck to the damp towel. I would use a deeper dish next time.
I omited the raisins because I don't like them and drizzled my own cream cheese icing over them when they were warm - mmmm, mmm good!

These were quick and easy, but not the best.  The ratios were off, too much sugar not enough butter...I will change things up next time since they were an easy treat!

these were "ok" but easy to make.  I guess I was expecting great things based on all of reviews.

Family loved it except for the raisins; already bought the dinner rolls to make again. Might try to coat each roll with a cinnamon & brown sugar mixture.

They were really good, but don't eat them if you don't like a LOT of sugar!!! They didn't rise as much as we thought they would, but we only left them out 8 hours, so maybe longer  will help! Good luck!!!

For those who love to "wow" without a lot of effort. This recipe is one of my absolute favorites.  Assembles the night before within 10minutes - bakes up the next morning in 25minutes.  You'll never believe how good they are until you try it.   I omit the raisans and use extra-extra cinnamon!!

I made this buns 2x already, seems can't get enough of it. I followed the recipe to the T. MY husband thinks this is the best one, so I'm going to make this at least twice a month. Thank you!

I made this for a New Year's Day brunch and it was gobbled up--kids and adults both loved it and asked for the recipe.  And it really couldn't be any easier to make.  This is going in my permanent recipe collection.

These were very good and easy to make.  I actually let mine rise a little too long so I would suggest about 9 hours depending on the temp. of your house.

My whole family loved this, and the best thing was I prepaired it the night before and only had to put it in the oven while getting ready for church. I did not put the raisen in. Next time I make it I plan to put bites of dried apple and pecans.

This was a VERY tasty and EASY recipe for a morning treat to bring to work.  It's a snap!  I will keep this on hand for easy and delicious breakfasts for guests too!  I added about a 1/2 cup butter since it seemed I needed more to spread over the sugar and spice mixture.  I also didn't use the raisins and it was great!

These cinnamon buns were fabulous!  My daughter made them for me and her new mother-in-law while visiting her in LA.  She made quite an impression on both of us!  I made them myself last week and followed the recipe exactly.  So easy and so good! Store bought will never be the same!

These were pretty good - the gooieness makes it great! I don't know if I would call them cinnamon rolls though - cinnamon roll concoction might be a good name. I will definitely make these again. The gooieness is addicting and they were very easy to make. My kid loved them.
