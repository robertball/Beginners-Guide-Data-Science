I have been looking for a good recipe for this for years. Having lived in Germany for several year, I must say that this is my absolute favorite dish. I love it served with gravy and either pork or beef on the side in addition to red cabbage.

My Grandmother wasn't a good cook. What she lacked my French Grandfather exceeded X's 10. . He would cook his dinner for the breakfast meal...foraging for mushrooms to accompany his pork chops. Anyway Grandma called these 'kloes'(clase) I now add parsley, nutmeg, garlic & onion powder to mine. (Even a little bouillon granules if you'd like or thyme. Yum Nothing like a savory chewy dumpling. Grandma would make them tennisball size, refrigerator  overnight, sliced into chunks & saut√© in butter or bacon fat.

Dry, bland, and heavy.  Croutons absorbed all butter making them greasy. A lot of work for a less than edible side!

I have been looking for this recipe for a long time. Came out perfect. Took less time to boil and did not need as many bread cubes.

This is okay as a side dish, but quite heavy. It was quite bland, but I've been assured by Germans and friends who've been to Germany that the real thing is quite bland too, so that isn't a fault of this particular recipe.

My wonderful German Grandmother always made these potato dumplings....I always preferred them the next day fried....however, this recipe was so much better ( sorry Nanny) , loved the buttery crouton inside .
I did a slight alteration and added roasted garlic to the potato and about a teaspoon of baking powder. 
Hubby, being Italian and he did not grow up with these as I did, found them somewhat bland as I just boiled them in the salted water. 
Ha...what does he know...lol......These rock the old fashion way!!  Ty Chef John....
By the way...I made these as an accompaniment to paper pork, as per your recipe...which is amazing!!
