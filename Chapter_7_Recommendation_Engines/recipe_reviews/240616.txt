Our family and friends love this!  We've been using this recipe for several years especially for our Super Bowl line up. We love it with tortilla chips but best with Ritz crackers!

Very Good! I love the crab Rangoon from Asian restaurants and this dip tasted just like them without the fried wonton around it.  My intent was to make this as a gluten free appetizer. I used imitation crab meat without reading the ingredients on the package. It contained wheat. I wanted them GF for a guest. Not the fault of the submitter of this recipe, it was my mistake. I will make this again as I really enjoyed this dip. It was even better the next day! My thanks to Janelle who submitted this recipe to Allrecipes.

I have made this for years.  i tweak it to taste.  only difference is, is that i don't put it in slow cooker.  I find it tastes a lot better cold, served on crackers.  I'm not a fan of hot crab dip, but my friends love it cold.  i highly recommend  that you try it.

I made it exactly as the recipe said and it turned out like soup. It didnâ€™t taste anything like a crab rangoon either.

Oddly enough, I made this for a super bowl party and it was literally gone so fast I didn't even get any! Take it from me, in party setting double up! I also find this goes amazingly with bagel/pita chips or lightly toasted baguette rounds. :-)

This is a really nice recipe. It was very easy and quite tasty, just spread on thin crackers. The quantity was too much for my spread, so next time I'd only make half. If you're having a large crowd and only a couple appetizers, this would be ok. If you have other items in your spread, half the recipe would still be plenty.

Made it exactly as recipe called for and did not care for it at all.  I had a friend, who equally loves crab rangoon, try it and he had the same reaction. VERY strong fishy taste.

Love this dip! It was a little sweet for my taste, so next time I'll cute the sugar in half. But it was a hit served with fried wonton chips and crackers.

The other people I made this for loved it. I did not. It does not taste like crab rangoon.
