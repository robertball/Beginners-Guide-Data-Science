I loved the chocolate version, but wanted to try something different... so I made it with a french vanilla flavored cake mix, a can of diet mountain dew, and a can of well drained crushed pineapple. Laid the pineapple down in an even layer on the bottom of the pan, then poured the mixture over the top of it. When the cake was done, and cooled, turned it upside down on a platter, and served with fresh strawberries crushed up, and a drizzle of chocolate sauce, with whipped cream. Tasted like I'd slaved for HOURS... SO yummy! Could use sliced bananas in there too, and make it into banana split cake!

This is a great cake!  Works great with diet drinks as well.  Then the only calories in the cake is in mix.  Good topped with light cool whip mixed with a little peanut butter.  Cake is extremly moist and therefore keeps longer than tradional cakes.  No one knows it was made with a soda unless it is revealed.

This is a quick dessert when you are in need of something sweet but not a whole lot is in your pantry. There are less sugar mixes you can use these days and a variety of diet sodas that you can use as well. To make it go even further, I like to cut the cooled cake into bits and layer it with FF whipped topping and sliced fruit for a quick low-fat trifle.

I love this recipe and have experimented with different flavors of cake mix and diet soda. Spice cake with diet orange soda is my favorite.  For those who say it doesn't rise enough but still want to cut fat and calories, add two egg whites rather than whole eggs.

I made this with yellow cake mix and coke zero cherry and made cupcakes.  I really like it.  Light and airy but a good sweet fix!  It made 24 cupcakes (on the small side) and they were 2 weight watcher points on the new points plus system.  I loved them!  Can't wait to try w/ other flavor cake mixes/diet sodas!

My 3 yr old has an egg allergy, so I've spent so much time online looking for an eggfree cake recipe that tastes good and isn't hard to make (by no means am I a good baker).  I was skeptical, I mean,pop and cake mix?!?! But I was willing to trying anything for my daughter.  This recipe was a godsend!!! You can't imagine how happy I was watching my daughter ploughing through her first cupcake.  The only small modification I made was instead of pop, I used sparkling water.  I found adding pop (regular or diet) was too sweet for my taste.  Sparkling water works exactly the same as pop!

Super good!! I used a cherry coke and it was absolutely the moistest cake I have ever had. It was almost like a fudgy brownie. I like the fact that it doesn't have oil or anything in it either. Soo yummy!!

Okay, I was skeptical.  I had had friends tell me they had tried this but hadn't myself.  So today I did.  It's great.  You don't have to use chocolate cake mix.  Any flav will work.  I used white and used a can of pepsi one which made the cake a golden brown.  It doesn't rise quite as high but the cake is very moist.  Even my daughter who is challenged in the kitchen can make this!!!

I made the chocolate version of this cake yesterday and it is already gone today. I used a bundt pan and added a whole egg to the recipe.  In less than 24 hours, a household of 3 tore up that cake.  I used a chocolate glaze for top and it was delish!  Will definitely make again.

I used this with a reduced sugar cake mix and diet cola and it came out pretty good.  My only complaint, like others have said, is that it does not rise very much.  Next time I'll try adding the eggs back in & only substituting cola for the oil/butter and water to see if that helps.  It's still not a "healthy" dessert but it's healthier!

I will freely admit that I made this cake with some alterations, one per other reviews I added 1 egg to help bind things up.  The other is that I used French vanilla cake mix and cherry coke.  Cherry Vanilla Coke Cake for the win.  It's an excellent formula for any possible combination.

Came out SUPER moist...I will admit, I had my doubts. But ever since I ran across this recipe, this is the technigue I use EVERY time I make a cake.  I've tried it with Coke, Cherry Coke, Mountain Dew, Sprite and Sunkist.

I used a devil's food cake mix and dr. pepper.  Baked in a bundt pan.  When cooled I poked holes with a fork, heated some raspberry Polander All Fruit and drizzled over the entire cake.  Delicious!

This was moist and yummy but extremely crumbly. I had a hard time getting it out of my 9x13 in pieces (bars). I used a box of Devil's Food Cake and a can of Dr Pepper; I also added two egg whites as per other reviews and I'm wondering if a full egg would have helped hold everything together. I'd definitely make this again with different cake/soda combinations.

I used 3 eggs (2 whites and 1 whole).  I used milk chocolate cake mix and added a few tablespoons mini chocolate semisweet morsels. I made cupcakes out of mix and it took about 15 minutes to cook.

I used a white cake mix and a can of diet Sprite.  I did add one egg white just incase and it turned out perfectly!  It was a huge hit at the party last night and no one could tell anything was different.  It saved about 50 calories per cupcake which is well worth it to me!

I used Betty Crocker Chocolate Fudge cake mix and Coca Cola. The cake came out moist and almost fudge-like. This was a HUGE hit with my entire family. My husband wants this cake every year for his birthday. I used the Rich Chocolate Frosting recipe for the icing. I noticed that the hint of cola flavour wasn't as noticeable after a day or so.

This seemed so weird I had to try it. I admit I used one egg white based on other reviews and I didn't think mine turned out flat at all. I used devil's food cake and a regular can of coke. I added some chocolate chips because I didn't want to use frosting.

This was surprisingly good.  I used chocolate cake with Diet Dr. Pepper and made into cupcakes.  I have seen similar recipes that call for the addition of egg whites, so after reading the reviews here I decided to add 1 egg white, which gave the cake more rise.  I can't wait to try this with other cake/soda flavors.  Thanks.

I used Lemon Cake mix and regular Ginger Ale. Diet Soda should not be heated up! Not easy enough? Instead of baking in the oven, put the batter in a microwave safe dish, cover lightly (I use the Tupperware microwave bowls) and cook in the microwave for about 10 minutes - tadaaa!

I also changed the recipe to a cherry vanilla cake and half coca cola and half cream soda.. I layered the bottom of the cake pan with crushed pineapples and cherries I also found the whip cream type recipe for icing.

So I made this recipe into cupcakes using just the Diet Cherry Coke and added two egg whites for a fluffier texture and it worked perfectly.  The first batch was kind of flat, but the second puffed right up and is very tasty!

This was a very, very easy and yummy treat to make and share with friends. It was very moist, and I used chocolate fudge cake mix instead of regular chocolate cake mix to add more of a chocolate lovers taste. This recipe works well in a square dish, or a bundt pan. I will definitely make this again.

I don't like chocolate myself, so I can't offer a review on taste- but I'm giving it three stars because the kids seemed to like it a lot. I followed the directions but the 'cake' was really runny even after it was finished. Needed to be eaten with a spoon.

I used spice cake and orange crush soda.  Was very moist as many have stated.  A very easy recipe when you are craving something sweet and don't have many ingredients on hand.  Thank you for sharing; will be making this again.

This cake is super moist and so good...I did do like others said and added two egg whites (even though I am sure it would be fine without). I cooked it for 30 minutes in two round cake pans for my husband birthday and he loved it. Make sure you prep the pan so this cake does not stick to it!!!

EXCELLENT MOIST CAKE. I USED DIET COKE AND A DEVIL'S FOOD CAKE MIX AND IT TURNED OUT GREAT. I ADDED A HANDFUL OF CHOCOLATE CHIPS IN THE BOTTOM OF THE CAKE BEFORE BAKING. I  SERVED IT WITH SLICED STRAWBERRIES AND TOPPED WITH COOL WHIP.

Wow!  I did two rounds of White cake mix with a can of diet root beer.  I put a can of crush pineapple (drained well) at the bottom of one and a whole container of light cool whip between them.  So it was like a pineapple upside down cake.  Next time will put Pineapple on both layers.  Didn't let it cool too long and it broke apart and became more of a cobbler (read serve with a spoon) but still delicious!!  Everyone loved it warm and cold.

SO easy and good! I used Diet Dr. Pepper. I did this in 2 9in cake pans, then made a frosting that was a variation from another recipe on here. I did stick of butter, 4 HEAPING TBSP of cocoa powder, 6-7 TBSP of diet DP, then 2 cups of confectioners sugar. Put some between the layers and poured the rest over top. This cake did crumble easily, though. First one flipped out fine, the top one (of course) crumbled real bad, but didn't affect the taste any!

I made this today.  It was wonderful!!  Turned out great!  Coca Cola cake is my favorite cake..mom makes for my birthday every year..she makes the traditional one without the marshmellows.  This was a good and easy substitute.  I used another Coca Cola Cake recipe from this site for the fudge like icing and that turned out great too.  Will be making this often!

My mom and I always used a can of diet cherry coke. We always liked this because it was delicious, quick, easy, and super moist. It is also a dessert that those in our family who were on weight watcher's could eat.

So far I have tried regular coke, cherry coke and cherry vanilla dr. pepper. All are very good and I am anxious to try more. This is so quick and easy and the cake is very moist. I use the Coco-Cola Icing recipe on this site to top the cake. This hits the spot!

The cake was flatter than normal cakes, but it still tasted great! The only down side to it was once I iced the cake it masked the cola flavor and tasted pretty much like regular chocolate cake.

Super fabulous!  I was out of eggs, oil and milk.  I did not have a chocolate cake mix but used a yellow cake mix and added 1/2 cup of unsweetened Hershey's cocoa.  I also added  semi-sweet chocolate chips which I had on hand.  Amazing flavor and moistness.  Didn't even feel the need to frost this cake after adding the chocolate chips.  Easy, fast and delicious!

Flavor of the cake (or should I say more like cake brownies) was actually good.  My complaint was it really isn't a cake if it doesn't rise.  My cake only rose to the height of brownies.  Then I used cream cheese frosting which made it exceptionally sweet.  

However, we didn't mind the flavor at all.  Considering I am not a Coke drinker, I couldn't tell that it was in the cake.  But the frosting might have something to do with that.

Has anyone had success with the cake actually rising?

Well I made this cake today. I did add one egg white into the chocolate cake mix and used the new Dr Pepper 10.  I dont taste the soda, just tastes like chocolate cake. It raised nicely in a 9x13 pan.  This will be my new go to cake recipe.

I used a white cake mix with ginger ale. I also added an egg white because I think it improves the texture of cola cakes. I had a bunch of leftover frosting from previous cakes/cupcake so I topped it will all sorts of frosting!

This was super easy. I used a sugar-free box of yellow cake mix (16 oz instead of 18.25) and 1 1/4 cups of diet orange soda. Not enough batter for a 9 x 13 pan, so used a smaller round cake pan and put the excess in a muffin baking pan. The cake was surprisingly good and it rose as much as I think it would have had I made it the regular way. Thanks for the great idea!

Made it with Dr. Pepper and loved the taste, but our bundt cake did not look at lovely as the other pictures here, so that's the only reason for 4 rather than 5 stars. We wonder if eggs really should have been used, or perhaps there's something different that needs to be done in high altitudes.

I changed it to a can if Diet Coke that way it’s a dessert that my Dad can eat and dearly loves.  I only use Pillsbury cake mix and it taste more like brownies.  I think it is also one of the weight watcher cakes idk.  But I’ve been making it for years.  You’ll be surprised with the diet my whole family eats it

So, I’m still working out the kinks. (I’m not a very consistent baker). But for a ‘healthier’ chocolate fix I used this recipe (mostly) to make some very low calorie brownies. I used a box mix for gluten free low-calorie brownies and Coke Zero. The only thing is, the amount of coke I used the first time (an entire can), was waaaaay too much!! I actually had to pour the whole thing down the drain! The second time, I slowly added the coke (while mixing) until the ‘right consistency’ was attained. I also ended up baking it for quite a bit longer than expected, but the end result was definitely worth the effort!! ... I will keep playing with this as time goes, but it’s soooo inexpensive, and does hit the chocolate button, that I will definitely do I again in the future!! Also, I experimented with this same concept as a mug cake (little bit of the brownie mix in a coffee mug, mixed with the Coke Zero, and zapped for a couple of minutes in the microwave), and it was also a pretty good success!! I typically try to shy away from sweets and baked goods, but some days you just gotta have it!! This recipe is an excellent go-to for that. ;) I highly recommend playing with it and figuring out a few ways to adapt it to your own life and liking!!

Extremely moist cake and so easy to make! I substituted a can of Cherry Coke and topped the cake batter with evenly spaced spoonfuls of canned cherry pie filling, then baked it. I like that you don’t need any oil or eggs. This is a keeper for when you want a fast, easy no fuss dessert.

I think this is one of the coolest revelations of the cake world. LOL When I first made this, I was so nervous on how it was going to turn out, but it turned out AMAZING. My husband was weirded out by it, but my kids and I fell in love with it. I couldn't believe how incredibly moist and fluffy it turned out and I didn't use an electric mixer either! So thankful one of my old neighbors shared this with me, I thought she was nuts at first, but turns out she wasn't kidding!

I made this with a Betty Crocker red velvet cake mix. I didn't have any coke so I used a good quality summer fruits cider.  It is FAB! So light and you an really taste the summer berries. Will definitely make again.

All you GF folks...I used a bag of Bob's Red Mill GF Chocolate cake mix, added 1 1/2 C sparkling soda water. Makes 20 pieces with 88 calories each. Wow!

The cake is a bit more dense but tastes just fine. Also, it has to be the easiest recipe ever.

(I decided to try it because I had some soda water left over from making GF pizza crusts (no yeast)

I recently made this recipe using carrot cake mix (Duncan Hines) and 12 oz diet Canada Dry ginger ale. It was moist and rose in the pan. I added raisins and walnuts. I did not use any icing. It was good enough on its own. Especially as a morning coffee cake. I was tempted to add egg whites from other reviewers suggestions, but decided to try it once to see how would be on its own. I was happy with the result and will try other combinations/ flavors

I've made a similar cake years ago and everyone really liked it! I will be making a lemon cake mix and trying Mt. Dew in it. Then making into cupcakes with a lemon/lime butter cream frosting. I will be adding one whole egg to bind the cake together. Can't wait!

The first time I made this, no one  in my family could taste the cola. I made it again using cherry cola. I tried to increase the amount of cola flavor by putting 18oz of  cherry cola in a pan and reducing it to 12oz.  Then,  I made a simple syrup using equal parts cherry cola and sugar to drizzle over the cake while it was cooling in the pan. I also frosted the cake using icing made with cherry cola. I could taste the cherry cola flavor in the icing, but my family could not. None of us could taste cola in the cake. It was moist

I used a devil's food cake mix, 1 can of Coke, and 1 Egg.  Mixed it up, threw it in the oven, and voila!  I did not have any trouble with it rising.  Once cooled, I topped with 1 pkg Cheesecake pudding mixed with 1 & 3/4 C milk, and this made a light, quick, tasty cake.  Although I wouldn't make this when I need a "real" cake, this was great for a quick, light dessert.

The cake was so easy to make, great if you are short on eggs or oil, and moist and yummy, my only complaint- it also is impossible to icing without using a piping bag, or a very light whipped cream icing. No matter what I use this is still divine tasting though, and if I had used an egg it probably would have been easier to icing! It has a very rich flavor. I will try this again perhaps with some different combinations, great recipe! 
Edit: To fix the rising problem mentioned, I simply added 2 teaspoons of baking powder. Yum yum!

I mixed Devil's food cake with Dr. Pepper and just a little bit of Cayenne.  Then spread a store bought cream cheese icing and sprinkled crushed peanuts on it.  Great Recipe.  Perfectly moist and super easy!!!!

I used a devil's food chocolate cake and a can of Zevia Ginger Root Beer (no sugar Stevia soda). It came out amazingly fluffy and tasty. It was only slightly dryer than I would have liked so I might add a little water to the mix next time. Otherwise it was really good with a little whip cream on top.

Used Coke Zero with a moist chocolate cake mix. Weird flavor and bottom was so crumbly that it just all fell apart.

I tried this recipe with a box cake and came out perfect. I loved it. Then I got a bit more adventurous and tried it with a muffin mix. Not so good. They came out dense and sticky. Any ideas how I can improve it? Another question do you think you can try this with an energy drink such as Monster?
