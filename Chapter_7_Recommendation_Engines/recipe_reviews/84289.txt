I found this recipe years ago and have been making them with my nieces, and then with my own kids every Easter ever since.  A big family favorite.  The kids always look forward to making them together just before the rest of the meal is ready.  As we do, we talk about taking sinless Jesus (marshmallow), anointing Him in oils (butter) and incense (cinnamon), wrapping Him in the shroud (crescent roll), and then placing Him in the tomb (oven). We always make at least two batches and they go fast.  It's so fun to see everyone open their "empty tombs" at the table.  

My advice: 1. don't skimp on the crescent rolls -- use the name brand.  They really do hold up better; 2. Keep the crescents refrigerated till needed; 3.  Bake at 350 for 10-12 minutes; 4.  Don't worry about the leakage - they're just as good messy! Just use a stoneware baker with shallow sides or a jelly roll pan with a parchment paper liner; 5. When you serve, don't use napkins or doilies -- they can be very sticky.

Wow, thanks for a wonderful idea!  I had no spills of the marshmallow -- only delicious, empty tombs!  I dipped the marshmallows in butter, then rolled them in cinnamon-sugar.  After rolling each marshmallow in one triangle, I rolled another triangle around it in the opposite direction.  I crimped all edges, then rolled the entire thing in butter and then in the cinnamon-sugar.  I baked them @ 375 for about 20 minutes; when I took them out of the oven, they smelled heavenly!  There were absolutely no holes or leaks or any sign of the marshmallows on the outside, so it was just as much of a treat for me to break open the tomb to find it empty.  My kids were in awe as they realized the lesson in what we had done -- that which our Savior has done for all of us!  Thanks for a new & wonderful tradition.

I made these years ago and jumped on AllRecipes to find a good recipe to do them again.  This one is perfect, except for one thing:  400 degrees for fifteen minutes charred mine!  I made a second batch at 375 degrees for 10 minutes, and they were perfect.  

Further, the whole of the Resurrection symbolism wasn't shared!  Jesus is the marshmallow, and He is anointed with oil (butter) and spices (the cinnamon and sugar) before he is wrapped in expensive cloth (dough) and placed in the tomb (oven).  Our our year old caught the whole of the Easter story through this symbolism.  It's quite clever.

Having read that other reviewers had difficulty with the marshmallow leaking out, I pinched and sealed mine so that NOTHING could get through the dough.  Wrong!  Some marshmallow seeped out of every one of them, some more than others.  (It's not really a problem since you want the inside to be hollow anyway.  When I make them again for Easter, I will take the advice of some of the other reviewers and use two pieces of crescent roll for each.  The dough actually isn't very thick with one, so I don't think it would be too much.  I will also leave out the sugar and just roll the marshmallows in butter then cinnamon.  The marshmallows alone would make the rolls sweet enough.  Good recipe, and a fun thing to try.

These are always good! Even my husband who does not like marshmallows will eat them. After making several times I've found that the best way to contain the marshmallow ooze is to cook them in greased muffin tins instead of a baking sheet. Blessings!

I am so glad that I tried these before Easter Sunday morning. This batch was a flop for me....and I cooked them exactly like the recipe called for. My "tombs" collapsed! I am going to try them again, and take a previous reviewer's advice by wrapping them with 2 triangles. I sealed mine up really good, but the marshmallows still oozed out. I would recommend cutting back the temperature (maybe to 375) and the time to 10-12 minutes. They were a little well done. I would definitely recommend a trial time if you are planning on using these for Easter Sunday morning!

Delicious! I didn't close some of the rolls all the way, but it just made a little enterance to the cave. Topped with "glory icing" (confectioner's sugar, melted butter, and milk) and they were fantastic.  Anyone who liked this recipe may want to try making "Baby Jesus Rolls" by pinching off the pointy end of a crescent roll triangle and forming a ball, roll the rest of the dough like one would normally and stick the ball on the end.  When baked it will look like a baby Jesus in swaddling clothes! Thanks for a great Easter recipe.

Delish!!  We used toothpicks to help roll the marshmallows which my kids related to the nails on the cross (pretty smart!) and I threw them in muffin tins seam side up with very little seepage.  These are so yummy you will want to make them all year long!

I used 2 crescent rolls per marshmallow.  These were sticky, gooey, sweet, flaky, and positively delicious! My husband thought I was crazy (but held his tongue) when he saw what I was doing, but he loved the end result.  Definitely a Easter tradition in the making!

I loved the story behind these rolls and had the opportunity to share it with my kids friends recently (even though it was after Easter).  I read most of the reviews and really tried to figure out how NOT to let them leak.  First I tried by rolling each triangle a little thinner before rolling around the marshmellow.  Next I tried the "seal with a fork" technique to close the edges of the dough.  Last step was to apply a small dab onto the seams to try and seal them even more.  Of course, it didn't work!!  Maybe they are suppose to ooze out onto the pan!  I did line the pan to prevent a big mess.  The end result was a sweet tasting crescent!  Kids loved them and wanted me to make more.  Next time I will try them with *mini* marshmallows to see if they are easier to roll and seal.

Surprised by the many comments about the rolls "leaking" and the marshmallows "exploding out". The marshmallow is designed to keep the roll's shape until it is "set". Then the marshmallow is supposed to melt and seep out. It is messy, so line a lipped cookie sheet w/foil or bake in a muffin tin. These are also called Empty Tomb Rolls. The space where the marshmallow used to be is now a cave... It's a great teaching tool.  It takes nice and the lesson is memorable. My oldest is 10 and still asks for them each Easter.

This recipe sounds just like one that my mom started making for us four kids more than 30 years ago - we called them "Special Anythings" and they appeared on days when there was a surprise outing planned, or a big trip.  She even made them for my sister the morning of her wedding. One tip I can pass along is to put the rolls into wells in a buttered cupcake pan - this will help the rolls keep their shape if you don't seal the edges.  Oh, also brush the top of the rolls with the melted butter and sprinkle more cinnamon-sugar.  Mmm...this brings back good memories!

Basically this is the 1969 Pillsbury Bake-Off Grand Prize winning recipe "Magic Marshmallow Crescent Puffs". The original recipe made 16 puffs. Also, flour was mixed in with the sugar/cinnamon mixture and they were baked in muffin tins at 375 degrees. After baking, a simple powdered sugar glaze was drizzled over and chopped nuts were sprinkled on top. I used to make these ages ago when my 4 boys were young. Over the years I forgot all about this recipe. They are really good, and fun and easy to make. Now I can't wait to make them for my Grandchildren, they are still young enough not to realize that the marshmallows melt while baking... so Granny can work some magic... LOL Granny's magic making days won't last much longer though, kids nowadays are so smart, but it will be fun for now... LOL Thanks for posting, brings back lots of good memories.

After 3 tries I finally mastered the sealing of these. It really does help if you can use the name brand crescent rolls. They just seem to work better. I add 1 Tsp. flour to the cin.and sugar mix as it helps to prevent the syrup from being too thin and therefore leaking out. I also seal the rolls all around as stated in the recipe but then I roll them in my hands to make a ball, roll in the cin/sugar/flour mix then dip tops into melted butter.Put in WELL greased muffin pan for 14 min.Works out every time now!! YUM!

Have been making these for several years at Easter. These are soooo good with a cup of coffee! Great kids recipe/ great lesson. I do have a problem with marshmallow leaking out, and I use 2 triangles of dough to cover the marshmallow.

I did this for my 8 year old activity day girls. They loved it. We acted out the story whir the rolls were in the oven. How Mary was the first person to see and talk to Christ as the risen Lord. She must have been a pretty special person to have Christ appear to her first.
I would either use 2 crescent rolls per lard marshmallow or maybe use mini-marshmellows. When I pulled them out of the oven, they were bursting with marshmallow. As they cooled, the marshmallow shrunk back down. They girls said it was his burial clothes that Peter and John saw folded up in the tomb. I thought that was pretty good idea. I told them that the sweet deliciousness was the atonement, and how we can all use the atonement in our lives. It is sweet and wonderful to have.

Every other recipe I've ever read for these says to use a muffin tin, not a baking sheet. If you do this then the marshmallow soaks into the bread instead of spilling out. So follow the recipe but use a muffin tin and it should be great!

Although not the tastiest rolls, these were so much fun to make with my preschool class at church. I gave each child a marshmellow to represent Jesus which they dipped in the butter. Each child had a bowl of cinnamon and sugar to represent sin. They wrapped their crescent roll around the marshmellow. I baked them in silicone cupcake holders which kept things mostly clean.

I used the name brand crescent rolls and they turned out great!  No problems with stuff oozing out.  
****
The only changes we made to the recipe were adding a teaspoon of vanilla to the butter and dipping the uncooked rolls in butter and the cinnamon/sugar mixture after they had a marshmallow sealed inside.  They were VERY yummy!  Even the adults enjoyed eating the Resurrection Rolls.
*****
I made the rolls with 6 children ages 7 and under.  The story and rolls together were great for demonstrating the miracle of the empty tomb!

We really liked these!  I decided to use one-half of a marshmallow for each roll and there was very little leakage.  I baked them at 375º for about 15 minutes.  These were fun and easy to make and I'll definitely make them again.

I used 2 mini marshmallows in one triangle of dough and didn't have problems with them leaking.  Tastes good, probably would be better with icing.  A fun Easter project with the kids.

These are a sweet treat and would be a great morning snack. I too had problems with some of the "tombs" leaking, but if I were to do this again, I'd work assembly-line style with another person(s)so that you don't have any butter on your fingers when you pinch the seams shut.

I make this with refrigerator biscuits, which I stretch out a little to make sure enough dough is there to cover over the marshmallow. Then I bake at 350 for 12-15 minutes. Due to the shape, they rarely leak and I like the "tomb" shape a lot more.

Great concept and favors, but mine oozed out just like so many other comments. I made extra sure that all the seams were sealed but that didn't help. Tasted good.

I also had a problem with the marshmallow leaking out.. but they were still yummy enough anyway. mine were pretty dry so I would do 12-13 mins at 350 next time.

I read reviews regarding leaking marshmellows and how to alleviate this by using two of the cresent triangles.  I tried both ways and they are right. The one with two triangles didn't leak. However, the single triangles still turned out to be hollow and yummy. I baked the single rolls at 350 degrees for 12 minutes and the larger one for 14 minutes. We made these the day before Easter and reviewed the resurrection of Christ. We enjoyed making and eating them. This will be a new Easter tradition!

Just made these and OMG! they are soooo good. What a fun easter project and food!!!  A big thanks to KarenCooks for the symbolism of each ingredient.  They do make a mess but I will try in muffin tins next time as another viewer suggested. Kids loved making and eating. Double batch next time.  I used the lg. crescent rolls but they still leaked.  Will try with different buiscuits.  Thanks for sharing such a great recipe!

This recipe did not work for me. It was easy to follow and a great concept they just didn't work. They came out flat and still filled w/ melted marshmallow. I was very disappointed because they sounded fun and thought this would maybe become a new family tradition. Oh well I'll keep looking!

I love the concept this recipe teaches.  But I am disappointed in the results.  I tried to follow the advice of others in using 2 rolls to seal it up and using a muffin tin.  Even with extra care, every one of them leaked.  The dough did not respond well to sealing.   Every leak was at a seam.  I used name brand for this first try.  Next time I think I will make my own roll dough, because I think the idea has merit.  We have not tasted them yet as they just came out of the oven, but I'm sure they will taste fine.

They tasted great, but like others have suggested, wrap the extra triangle around the roll.  All the mess in the pan from leaking is not fun to clean up!

Everyone in the family loved these.  My kids eyes light up when they tasted them.  Delish!  They were fun to make also.  The marshmallow leaked out of ours but it still left a "cave" and actually the oozy marshmallow made it more fun.  I did not use the sugar because I thought they would be sweet enough with just the marshmallows.. they were.  THANKS so much for this recipe.  A new tradition!  :)  We won't wait until next Easter to make them again either.  :)

These tasted good, and I really thought I sealed them up real good and tight, but alas....the marshmallows still spilled out on the pan.  Might try again another time and hope for better stuffed success.

I made these for my son today for breakfast before school and he really enjoyed. I didnt try them as I am on a low carb diet. My only complaint is even though I sealed them well the marshmallow leaked out of most of them. Fortunately I used tin foil over the pan or that would have been a pain to scrub off. Thanks for sharing!

My boys and I enjoyed making these together on Easter morning!  Our marshmallows leaked out but that didn't matter.  The "tombs" were still empty on the inside and, as an added bonus, they tasted fantastic!  Will definitely be making these again, even when it's not Easter.

This was so simple, my 8 year old son did most of it. I used the large rolls as suggested and the muffin tins to contain any blowouts, which were minimal. The rolls are perfect, sweet enough but not to sweet, great with a cup of coffee. Will definitely make again!

I had never heard of these until I read about them on this site. My husband and I did this with our 2 toddlers right before Easter dinner. The kids loved it and the adults thought the rolls were delicious. We will definitely be doing this every year. What a great tradition to remind us of the reason we celebrate Easter.

I used the crescent dough (a newer product) that is not cut. From two tubes, I got 10 rolls. These were VERY sweet.  I'd love to find a way to make them more savory, but that's kind of hard with the marshmallow. Everybody loved them, though!

My children and their cousins had a great time with these. It was a good lesson on the empty tomb as the first thing they said when eating was "Were is the marshmallow". I also omitted the sugar and used two triangles and wrapped around one marshmallow. Will definetly make this an Easter tradition! Thank you.

This is actually an old Betty Crocker recipe, known as Balloon Buns.  In that recipe, you take your marshmallow enclosed roll, dip it into  melted butter & then roll it in the brown sugar/cinnamon mix, & then pop 'em into muffin tins & bake.    They're a God awful sticky mess to eat w/ the outer coating, but boy are they YUMMY!!  :D

Okay, so I read lots of reviews. My first attempt at this, yes, the marshmallow oozed out and made a mess and many of the rolls collapsed and terrible to clean up. So I did my best test kitchen experiments. I tried at least 7 different variants:
- using two crescent rolls (way too much), 
- using the large dinner roll size (still too much), 
- adding flour to the spices (didn't help...and was weird),
- using mini marshmallows or cutting them in half (doesn't work so well and difficult to fit into the object lesson)
- even tried water instead of butter (made little difference, although one of the reasons the crescent rolls split open at the seam and oozes out is too much butter makes it hard to seal it well.
The secret to success (others have said this): use a silicone cupcake pan. Very little seepage. 
1. Use real butter, not margarine or some other icky product.
2. Use the name brand crescent rolls (the original size).
3. Pinch the seams together well.
4. Brush melted butter on top and sprinkle more spices on top.
5. 350 for 12 minutes was plenty
6. As soon as they are done, barely cool enough to touch, flip them so that the oozy goodness coats the inside of the top too.  
Worked perfectly. 
We do this only once per year, and we share the Easter story of Jesus' resurrection. My preschool-aged grandchildren love doing it.  I know, they aren't going to get the analogy. But they will remember it and eventually it will make sense to them. Until then, it a tasty treat that they g

Made these rolls for an adult Easter dinner and they were a hit! They are sweet like a cinnamon roll, and they went well with the ham and potatoes I was serving. Will make this every Easter.

I found this last weekend made on Monday as a test before Easter. I read all of the reviews before I made them, that being said I modified it slightly. First, I did not have big marshmallows I used 2 mini marshmallows. I also didn't have the regular rolls I had ones that were bigger (package was 12oz, forgot brand). Since marshmallow s are already sweet I used more cinnamon and less sugar, and more melted butter. I let the marshmallows soak in the butter while I unrolled the pastry. I used parchment paper on a baking sheet. brushed butter and sprinkled cinnamon over top. 357 for about 14 minutes. Turned out great only 3 leaked. Will be making again Easter for breakfast.

I love the concept of this especially when walking through the story that goes along with it...but the taste is mediocre and it can make a huge mess if the they are not sealed well. We did add a little flare by sprinkling salt and cinnamon on top. Like I said, great in concept especially with kids but this is not something I would serve at an adult or more formal event.

I made these twice this Easter and they're pretty yummy. Mostly, I just love making them with my sons and then pointing out the meaning. Thanks for sharing; it's such a clever idea.

These tasted great! I made these Easter morning and loved the symbolism as I made them. Mine, however, did leak like others had stated in previous reviews, even though I tried my best to seal them. I just stated that, "The way I made these rolls looks like Jesus arose and exploded out of his linens!" I got a big laugh from my family. Will take the advice of others next time and try sealing them with two crescent rolls instead of one. Will become a family tradition for sure. Thanks for the recipe!

Charred and in edible. 350 and 10 minutes. Every other recipe on the internet. I had to pick this one and ruin such a sweet moment with my kids! Wish it wasn't the first one to pop up on google.

Wow!  Those are awesome!  I printed out the story and read it to my kids step by step.  After they were all rolled up I took the extra butter and brushed it over the tops and then sprinkled the extra cinnamon sugar mixture over that.  Baked at 350 for 10 minutes (worked with my oven) and we all ate one while they were still warm.  It tastes just like a warm cinnamon roll!  Excellent!  Will be doing this every Easter.  And then maybe at Memorial Day, and then again on 4th of July, etc. ;)

My daughter and I made these this morning and they were wonderful!  I pressed the seams like mad, but the marshmallow still leaked out which was okay because the rolls were still hollow inside.  As a last step, I rolled the dough in finely chopped pecans to mimic the rocky outside of the tomb.  The kids loved them!  Thanks for such a wonderful recipe.

We have made these for years, but we call them Cresent Puffs and put some glaze over the tops. They are yummy and my favorite part is the gooey middle where the marshmellow melts!!  mmmmmmmmm

I wanted to try this recipe as soon as I saw it... The taste to these is great, but they are not as easy to make as you'd think- Every single one of my "tombs" spilled out and stuck everywhere.  So a warning to those just trying this- you may think that you sealed them tightly, but that doesn't make it safe!  If I try this again, I will do as another reviewer suggested and wrap each marshmallow with two rolls.
