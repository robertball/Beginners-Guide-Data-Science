I made this for recipe group. I didn't care for this. A basic quick bread with some bacon thrown in. Though fairly moist, it just seems to grow in your mouth like a baking mix biscuit until it gets all gummy. I didn't like the mix of bacon and walnuts. The nuts just seemed like an afterthought. No onion flavor there at all, sauted ones may have been better choice instead of dried. Just seemed to be missing flavor. Garlic powder and some pepper, more hot sauce. Thanks anyway.

This was for Recipe Group week of 10/2.  I made a mistake that turned out to be fortunate in that I grabbed maple flavored bacon.  That worked well with the walnuts, but there wasn't enough of any one flavor to be impressive.  It did come out moist, and we ate it, but this was just ok and I doubt I would make it again.  I don't think I would have liked it with regular bacon.

This was really good, I was surprised! I used 1/4 cup chopped onion because I didn't have any dried onion. I used 5-6 dashes Tapatio hot sauce and turkey bacon. Next time I'll use more hot sauce and add some garlic powder. I'm also thinking about sprinkling some parmesan cheese on top. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for Recipe Group, and I guess I'm in the minority here, but we thought it was good! In all fairness, I have to say that I did 'spice it up' some by adding garlic and onion powder, cayenne pepper and some parmesan cheese. This came out beautifully and was very moist, but I do think it is a bit heavy, though most quick breads like this are, IMO. We really enjoyed the flavors of the walnuts and bacon. I would probably make this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I really wanted to like this one, but sadly I didn’t.  I did alter it a bit, but not enough to change the intent of the submitter.  Instead of the dried onion, I used 1/2 cup chopped green onions, including a lot of the green tops, hoping to add some color.  I used a little more cheese, about 1 cup and I used peppered bacon.  It makes a big loaf that rose beautifully and looked great coming out of the oven.  I love bacon, but I just didn’t care for it in this.  The walnuts did add a nice crunch.
