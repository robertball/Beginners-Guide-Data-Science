Delicious way to use leftover thanksgiving turkey. I used chicken broth instead of turkey broth and the taste was still great. One of the best tamal recipes I have tried.

LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe!  The masa is wonderfully flavored and it was such a great way to use up leftover turkey.  We had smoked our Thanksgiving turkey so it was extra flavorful.  I think I'm hooked- now I can't wait to try other fillings.  There is absolutely nothing intimidating about making tamales anymore!  We looked online just to make sure we were making the masa the right consistency and were wrapping them correctly, it's really an easy process.  These freeze beautifully too- just steam them to reheat.  We served with a red sauce and queso fresco.

I had a ton of turkey left over so I thought I would give this a try, to my surprise it was great. My finicky family even loved it they all agreed it was the best use of leftover turkey. The dough had great flavor I think it would work well with other meats. A keeper.

I wanted to try this recipe because of all the seasoning in the masa. I made the masa with the spices but used coconut oil instead of corn oil. Very good! My son asked me to make them more often. This is a very good basic masa recipe to fill with whatever meat you choose. I am definitely keeping this one.

We ran out of corn husks. My wife suggested aluminum foil which worked well.

These were delicious!  I didn't have corn oil so I used vegetable oil, and they were moist and the flavor was great!  Definitely a great way to use up all that leftover turkey.

So good! We made these last year with our leftover turkey, and my 8 year old was asking about making them again this year.  These are time consuming, but it has been a fun project with the kids.  I know the authentic recipe is with lard, but these are so delicious. The masa is so flavorful! I also used chicken broth. We’ve also experimented with the filling with great results.

Turned out great!!!  It was time consuming, but easy to make.  I used vegetable  oil and chicken broth as I didn't have corn oil or turkey broth.  I doubled it, I had a lot of turkey.

We've made tamales filled with a variety of Thanksgiving leftovers--green bean and sweet potato are delicious, too. The masa dough works well with all kinds of fillings.

A great use of leftover turkey! I used dark meat and meat  from the wings. Even a little bit from the neck. I was taught to make tamales by hispanic people. Mainly using pork. Some used lard some corn oil. I also used chicken broth instead of turkey broth.  These are good. Close to the taste of chicken tamales. And the best part is, all that leftover turkey doesnt go to waste. You will definitly need some kind of sauce to top it with. As they are very dry trying to eat them by their selves.  I didn't have any green sauce like i usually eat with them. So i improvised. I used the leftover giblet gravy also and mexicaned it up. I added garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, cumin, chilli powder, and a tiny bit of cayenne pepper for heat. It went perfectly with them,  And I didnt have to waste the giblet gravy either. Worked out REALLY well. Also for anyone who wants to know a way easier way to make them.. you can skip the corn husks part and just wrap them in aluminum foil. That's how Alot of hispanic people make them anyway. Its Alot less hassle, time consuming and cheaper. Just put it directly in foil and fold them up and fold up the ends tight. Tastes just as good.

I made this recipe with my leftover turkey.  I was very disappointed.  I didn't like the spices used in the masa.  The chili powder was overwhelming and there was no heat.
