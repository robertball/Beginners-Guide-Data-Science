Delish! Made them for our Christmas dinner (2018), and my daughter was so impressed. She told me that what she liked about them was their lightness , and of course, the shape of them. I did not have the potatoes that were recommended, and still they came out as a masterpiece. I brushed them again, before plating them with melted butter. Yes, I will make them again, and will recommend this recipe to all my friends when they asked me about my Christmas' dinner this year.
