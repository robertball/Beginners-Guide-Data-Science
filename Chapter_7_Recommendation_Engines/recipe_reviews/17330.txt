These were really good but I gave it 4 stars because of the adjustments. I have been looking for this basic recipe for quiet awile and was thrilled to find the "right" one finally.  The only thing I did different was omit the nuts (I have a daughter who hates nuts....couldn't be my kid) decrease the potato chips to 1 1/2 cups (two cups made it just TOO potato chip for my family} and added 1/2 cup of coconut.  They were a hit and disappeared as fast as I cooked them.

These cookies are so addictive! When I made them my mom thought they were going to be too greasy, then she ate half the batch :)When I tell people they have potato chips in them they are a little hesitate to taste them but once they do they become the most requested cookie. Thank you so much for sharing.

Great little cookie.  Crisp around the edges, chewy in the center.  Certainly not gourmet but tasty none the less.

Hard to eat only one.  I only had one and a quarter c. of crushed potato chips but the kids were dying to bake these so we tried anyways.  I used butter and reduced the sugar.  The potato chips release a lot of oil so I will try reducing the amount of butter slightly next time.

A blast from the past, truly a forgotten treasure! My mom used to make these with little stale flakes that we failed to devour from the huge Charles Chips canisters that were delivered regularly to our house. Yes, these cookies are sweet, but no sweeter than many other cookies. That said, you could cut back either the white or brown sugar by 1/4 cup without affecting the product. Beyond that, you risk altering the texture, as sugar is a structural element. The chips do not retain their crunch, but rather they meld into the cookie, leaving behind a chewiness with just the faintest kiss of butterscotch-like flavor. Don't know why it happens - just know that it does, and these are always well received, with many requests for the recipe. No changes necessary, but I used half margarine because I found a stick lurking deep within the bowels of the fridge that I wanted to use up. Simple, "good eats" type of cookie that you'd find frequently filling cookie jars all over America during the 60s. It was always a delight to find my mom baking these when we got home from school. Nothing better than a couple of these with a tall glass of cold milk. Great comfort food!

This recipe was just "OK" after reading all the reviews, I really thought this was going to be a great cookie recipe.  Nothing special.  Why add all the fat and calories when the potato chip really did not add anything to it at all.  I do have to admit that I did add chocolate chips, and I am glad I did or these really would of been a disappointment.

My mom use to make these during my childhood days. Brings back many fond memories. I was rather surprised that many people I know have never heard of potato chip cookies. Anyway, these cookies are very similar to a sugar cookie. The texture is a bit different, though. They are very versatile  and additions, such as nuts, chocolate chips, coconut, or other flavor baking chips may be added. Even cinnamon. Whatever your preference is. I like them as written since this is how my mom made them. I did cut back on the white sugar to 3/4 cup, added 3 cups potato chips and 1 tsp butter extract. I baked on parchment paper lined cookie sheet. Key is not to over bake them. Bake just till edges turn brown and center is a light golden brown. This will ensure a crispy outside and a slightly chewy cookie in the middle.

Oh Yeah, this is a five star cookie. I made them early this morning. I got 4 dozen. I think the next time I make them, I will split the dough into 4 parts. Mix in some chocolate chips one dozen, then next maybe place four colored M&M's on the top before baking on another dozen. You could probably add some coconut to the last dozen before baking. Four different kinds of cookies with this same recipe. It's a keeper in my house. My honey loved them. Thank you Fran!!!

I don't think these cookies would have been as good if I did not make some changes. I used half unsalted butter and half shortening. I did not use nuts. I also added chocolate chips to some and butterscotch chips to the rest. The chocolate chip ones were best. I would give 4 stars with the chocolate chips. This definitely makes a chewy cookie!

I was looking for a specific cookie my godmother used to make when I was a kid... these were not it.... they were good except way too much sugar.  If I try these again the sugar could probably easily be halved.

These cookies are fabulous! Even my husband likes them, who is very critical of my baking abilities. I'm making three more batches to give as Christmas gifts. You've gotta try these! 
P.S. - I opted not to use walnuts, but I'm sure they would be good.

I remember loving these when I was a kid. But now that I'm an adult, they just don't have the same appeal. It's like putting chips on your school lunch sandwich...you remember it fondly, but now, you just prefer to eat your chips on the side. I substituted butter for shortening, but didn't change anything else. This recipe is a fun idea, but when the novelty wears off, you are left with just mediocre cookies. Sorry...

My mother used to make us potato chip cookies when we were little. I don't have her recipe but I knew someone here would have one. Great recipe! I did use butter instead of shortening and substituted almond extract in place of the vanilla. Although the cookies were slightly flat, I believe if I used less butter, they would be fuller. But the taste...freakin' awesome. Thank you for this recipe.  P.S. I used fresh, ridged potato chips. Makes a difference.

not bad - very crunchy cookies -- i halved the recipe and used almonds instead of walnuts.  I think they would be *fantastic* with chocolate chips.

Maybe it was because I used kettle cooked potato chips, but I could really taste the potato chips in the cookies.  The mix of salty/sweet wasn't balanced and the unexpected chip taste made me send the cookies to work with my hubby, whose coworkers will eat anything.  I wish these had been better because they looked nice.

Excellent!!! I got many compliments on these from my family to co-workers. Everyone wanted the recipe. 

My grandmother used to make Potato Chip Cookies, and this is very close to what I remember. I have also made them with chopped pecans, which gives it a flavor similar to a Pecan Sandie.

My mother used to make this depression era recipe for my brother and I, while growing up in the 1970's. 

My favorite potato chip to used for this recipe is Lays Kettle Cooked Potato Chips, but feel free to experiment (crinkle-cut, waffle, etc).

I cut the chips down to 1 1/2 cup as another review suggested and I added some chocolate chips into some of the cookies at the end because my family LOVES chocolate.

These are dangerous is all I can say!!! Did a few with white chocolate chips added in to compare and they were just as equally dangerous! There, you have been warned and my conscience is clear.

Be sure to separate well, they spread out allot. I am trying to reproduce cookies from my childhood, I will add more chips next time.

I love an unusual recipe.  Sometimes I just feel compelled to try it and use it as an opportunity to broaden people's ideas of what something is.  I used a kettle cooked potato chip and didn't crush them overly fine so they would retain a nice crispness after baking.  I had a lot of fun sharing them at work.  We did find them a bit greasy and I probably wouldn't make them again.  Just didn't quite hit all the right notes for me, but it sure was an experience.

I wish this had some more chip flavor. It could depend on the chips themselves. However, the cookie itself had great flavor. I definitely got the crunch affect from them.

Thank you Grandma Rall!!  This recipe is exactly what I was looking for. I found out quite by accident that it's also a forgiving and flexible recipe. I taste tested the recipe by making just a half batch. While measuring the brown sugar, I accidently put in 2/3 c. instead of 1/2 c.  They still turned out great - and it makes no difference if you use walnuts or pecans - they were still excellent. A definite keeper!!!

I followed the recipe and they spread to very, very thin. They were difficult to take off the sheet, even after the 5 minutes. I started to use baking spray and that improved taking them off.  After another dozen or so I added flour and a little baking soda. They stopped spreading out so badly,  and they were not as flat. For the last two dozen I added mini chocolate chips. 

I was disappointed with the taste. I love potato chips and expected more of that flavor. The chocolate chips helped to perk them up.

My chocolate  chip recipe is almost identical. But it calls for 3/4 c. of both brown and white sugar. That would help keep them from spreading so much. I also use 2.5 c. flour and that would help even more. I add the extra flour because I use my neighbor's eggs and they are huge.

In the future I will use the chocolate chip recipe, use less chocolate chips and add the potato chips and will try more than just the 2 cups.

This is a easy & delicious twist on chocolate chip cookies. Omit the walnuts but add pecans & butterscotch or chocolate chips! Each flavor tastes different. Everyone loves them.

Overall, these cookies turned out very nicely.  They were soft and chewy and tasted yummy.
I added 1/2 tsp. orange flavoring (just because) and 1 cup of dark-chocolate chips (again, just because).  Good combinations.
After adding the chips and nuts, it became too thick for my mixer to handle, so I had to dig in with my hands.

I did not, however, give this recipe a 5.  I had 2 issues with this recipe:
1st, the shortening made these greasier than they should have been.  I'll try actual butter next time, maybe.
2nd, the recipe states to put the dough on an UNprepared cookie sheet.  BAD IDEA!!!  I left one cookie sheet UNprepared; I decided to see if it'd make a difference.  Thank goodness I sprayed the rest - the cookies on the UNprepared sheet BURNED after 8 minutes!!!  
I had to throw out about 6 cookies - not even my toddler would eat it (and he tried to eat just the top, but he finally threw it down).  The rest of the cookies on that sheet, I had to scrape the bottoms.

The rest of the cookies, however, were very yummy.  I even dipped half in chocolate (and others in melted vanilla).  Love these cookies!!!

These taste really good, but for some reason my cookies stuck both to a regular uprepared pan and a pan lined with a silpat.  Not sure why.

I made my own revisions and it rocked, so good that everyone's asking for the recipes. So this recipe is great as base starter then you make the revisions.

Excellent cookies...I added chocolate chunks.  My very picky daughter and husband LOVED them.  The potato chips give a traditional chocolate chip cookie a little "crunch".  YUM!

Kudos on this recipe. My mother used to make these cookies as well as the banana split cake for my sister and I. Unfortunately she passed away in June 1999, and we had no inkling on how to make these cookies. We haven't eaten them in about ten years, but for some reason we are both now craving them. Thank you so much for having this recipe available.

This recipe is awesome!We thought Grandma's recipe for Potato Chip Cookies was gone forever, but this is so very close. Doing a little happy cookie dance at my house.
One note, I got nearly 6 dozen cookies out of this recipe, not the 3 dozen stated.
