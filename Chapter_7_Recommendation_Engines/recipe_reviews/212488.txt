I followed this recipe to the letter and it was just merely okay. First of all it did not taste like the bhuna I'm used to having. Second with all the onions the recipe calls for it took incredibly long for it to turn golden brown. Around 45-50 minutes and that was after I turned the stove up. If I cooked it on low I would have been there all night. Third it took more than 40 minutes for the lamb to get soft even though I cut it into small pieces than chops. It was not ready in 1 hr 5 minutes. Not even close. After all that the taste was merely okay nothing special. It definitely was not worth the time and effort and I would not make this again. I'll try Madhur Jaffrey's bhuna next time.

Came out really nice. Didn't have all the ingredients used 4 tomatoes 2 onions and didn't have cilantro.. The meat was a little tough next time i'll pressure cook the meat and grill before hand.
