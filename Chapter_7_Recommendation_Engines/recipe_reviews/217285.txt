Because I did not want to use maple syrup, I just doubled the butter. I made no other changes. This was so easy--my oldest boy was able to help me make this with no issues. To make the bread easier to form to the muffin cups, I used the top of a drinking glass to cut a circle, then flattened the circle with a rolling pin just a touch. I was worried that the bacon and cheese wouldn't be enough but the recipe was just right for each "cup". It's almost like a shortcut Egg in a Basket. Thanks so much for a new favorite--I'll make these again and again.

These were a big hit for brunch with my family. Like another reviewer I scrambled the eggs because once I toasted the bread cups and added the meat they weren't tall enough to hold an entire egg. I made some with bacon and others with sausage and swiss cheese. They came out fantastic! They were gobbled up faster than the danish and fruit I served!

These were an absolute hit when we made them! My only advice is double the recipe and make 12; not only do many muffin pans have 12 slots, but we ate them way too fast for 6 to have been enough!

What an original way to serve bacon, eggs, and toast! This was really good. I didn't like the maple flavor though. I forgot to trim the crusts and ran out of butter stuff since I used the back of a spoon instead of a brush and did both sides of the bread. I used large eggs and they ran over the top as the standard size muffins cups overfilled. No matter, they still tasted fine. Great idea and great little recipe! Thanks.

These were great and so easy to prepare!  I didn't add the maple syrup, used Hormel diced ham and served with hollandaise sauce. Great!
Update 2012: I have made these many, many times.  You can use whatever meat and cheese  you have on hand.  I even threw in a small chopped layer of leftover aspargus one time.

Thank you for this easy, satisfying recipe.  It's just my hubby and me at home these days so I used custard cups, just made two and cooked them in the toaster oven.  It worked great and was a very tasty breakfast.

this recipe is REAL fun to cook with the kids. Since my boys only like scrambled eggs I added that, replaced the bacon with sausage and added fresh jalapeno to my muffins... GOOD STUFF!!

I diced my bacon before frying it.  I've started doing this in all of my recipes calling for crumbled bacon.  It seems to cook more evenly so you get a nice crunch.  Didn't put the maple syrup either, and I too scrambled my eggs.  One thing that wasn't clear, was to butter the flattened bread on "both" sides before crisping it up??  I did and seemed to do well.  Will share this with my daughters so they can cook for their families!

Awesome change from regular egg and bacon breakfast.  I did scrambled eggs with cheddar for my 11 year old son and cracked egg with pepper jack for the grown ups.  So delicious!  The only thing I would do different next time would be to add another layer of the maple/butter-brushed bread.

Outstanding...omitted the syrup and wished we hadn't, A little sweetness would have made them even better.  We also added onion - we love onion.  Also for those wondering, 10 minutes resulted in a very runny yoke while 14 minutes they were cooked solid (did some experimenting).

Fabulous!!! We didn't have Heavy Cream, so we used Half & Half, and also didn't cut the crusts off - it added a nice texture! We will make these again & again and again...

Great recipe! Easy and above all else a different way to eat your eggs, bacon and toast. :o) The only thing I did differently was scramble the eggs (per kids request). It has definitely made my family's breakfast rotation! Thanks!

Made it vegetarian with imitation bacon bits. I never have real cream on hand, so I used canned evaporated milk. I used maple syrup on only 2 just to try it. We didn't like sweet bacon & eggs. It was better without syrup. But the recipe is excellent, easy & quite clever! It's my new Sunday breakfast dish.

These r so Good !!  Our daughter introduced them to her Dad and I for Breakfast and He just Loved Them !!  He loves syrup or jelly on eggs. I like mine just with bacon or sausage or even both and yes when you make them with both meats make sure to do them in ramekins or large muffin pans..She usually does about 3 pans full for are family of six. Her children loves potatoes and she does some with potatoes in the bottom,egg,then cheese, or scrambled eggs,red/mixed peppers/onions..Delisous ! !  "To Each It's Own"
Enjoy ~~ The Stars Don't Show On My PC But We Rate This 5+ Stars   There Great Hand Food For Toddlers and Make Good Snack Food Too.

This was really easy to put together and a cute way to present breakfast.  I thought it was good as is, but, next time I will definitely kick it up a notch by adding some onion and peppers.   I had the same problem as some others seemed to have though.  I used a standard muffin tin and there was no way I was going to fit an entire egg into the cup.   I had to scramble the eggs and pour into the muffin cups.

This was a great idea! I made these this morning.  I used large eggs. One of them overflowed because there was not enough space for it. I now know that you must really press the bread into the pan to make as much space possible for the filling. Due to my own error, I forgot to put the bacon in before adding the egg. After putting in the egg, cream and salt and pepper over the toasted bread, I baked these for 10 minutes. Then I pulled them out of the oven, added the bacon and mozzarella (had no Cheddar) and baked for another 5 minutes, rotating the pan, as I noticed the eggs in back of the oven were cooking faster. They were beautiful! The "red" of the bacon and the "white" of the cheese were gorgeous! These muffins looked like flowers! Also, I changed the ratio of butter to maple syrup: 2 tablespoons of butter to 1 tablespoon of pure maple syrup and it worked out well. I served some warmed Philadelphia Lemon & Herb Cooking Cream diluted with a little milk on the side for those that wanted a touch of richness (like Eggs Benedict!). Fresh fruits completed the plate.

Delish!
I used a large muffin tin to avoid overflow. I didn't have maple syrup on hand so I substituted with regular pancake syrup. Also don't keep cream handy so used a teaspoon of 1% milk. I made 3 with scrambled eggs & 3 as recipe calls. So good! Teenagers loved these

This is a great breakfast treat! It can be eaten just like a muffin. I coated both sides of my bread with the butter and maple syrup. I added mushrooms and broccoli, that I pre-cooked in the microwave for 2min, to the bottom of the toasted bread shell. Then I cracked one egg on top, broke the yoke, and topped with american cheese. YUM!

Great for an on-the-go breakfast, just baked a few minutes longer so the yolk was firm.  I decreased the maple syrup to 1 TB, & only buttered one side of the bread.  I replaced the bacon with sautéed spinach, mushrooms, & red onion for half of the muffins - delicious both ways!  I used a popover muffin pan & had plenty of room, no overflow.  My husband got excited thinking about other possibilities for fillings, both sweet & savory.  Will definitely make again.

We didn't like the added maple syrup, so left it off the second time we made it.  Much better w/o the syrup, at least in our opinions.

So yummy! My husband, 13 month old son and I just gobbled these up! They have that perfect salty/sweet combination that leaves a mouth happy. We will be adding this one to our recipe box for sure!

I made a few changes to the recipe I just thought I would share. 

#1 - We had leftover scratch whole wheat rolls from dinner the night before. I just ripped 3 of them in half and used one roll half per muffin cup for the bread.
#2 - I used turkey bacon instead of regular pork bacon. In the future, I would only cook 5 strips, because I cooked 6 and had leftovers. 
#3 - I only had to use about 4 eggs for 6 perfectly plump muffins. I whisked them together with the salt and pepper before I poured them in. When I poured them all evenly the cups were full, so I just pressed down into the cups with a whisk to allow for the heavy cream and cheese on top.
#4 - I have an electric oven, so maybe that is what influenced this, but I had to cook my muffins for about 24 min. until they were fully cooked. At 11 and 14 minutes the egg white was still clear. 

Enjoy!! :)

This was so good!  I did overcook mine some so the yolks weren't as runny as I'd liked.  Still great flavor though and I will make this often...thanks!

I have been using this recipe for quite a few years at my hotel, and have it on the breakfast menu for almost every group.  I always double it, because I serve it with fruit for breakfast, not as an addition to a "brunch buffet."  Everyone is always up for two of these, and a few big guys will take three.  I try to keep the egg yolk whole and cook until the egg is just done with a slightly runny yolk, unless folks prefer it "hard."  It is always a real hit.

I saw these and made them right away.

I used whole wheat bread, turkey bacon, and crumbled a slice of colby jack on top. I broiled them for a few seconds at the end so they would be crispy.

They did stick a bit, so I'll make sure to spray heavily with oil. But they are delicious! And so easy, too. I'll be making them again and again!

Fabulous!!!  I used Pepperidge Farm very thin bread and it worked perfectly!  Also, the muffin pan I use is for larger muffins (not cupcakes) only 6 muffins in the pan.  To grease the muffin pan make sure you use Pam NOT butter!  Such a versatile recipe - any type of breakfast meat, any type of cheese and add any ingredient (peppers, onions, cooked potato, etc.)  Just love these -- easy enough for quick breakfast on the way to work - impressive enough for company brunch!  Thank you for a fabulous, easy recipe.  P.S.  I also love the eggs cooked a bit softer -- the yolk soaks into everything and makes even more deliciousness!

Very good, a hit with my teenagers, I whisked up a couple of eggs and topped the bacon instead of whole egg in each as my muffin pan not that big.

This recipe was very good.  I made it exactly as stated in the original first.  I loved the flavor but my eggs were overcooked.  I like a runny yolk. But even with the hard yolk the little cups got rave reviews.  Today I changed a few things and it was better would give 5 stars with the changes. I used the butter syrup mixture and didnt bother with the cups I put them on a cookie sheet in the oven to get crisp. Sprinkled them with bacon and cheese and cooked till bubbly.  I made poached eggs which are really easy. (First, boil water in a sauce pan with 2tbs vinegar break egs into pan bring to boil to desired firmness. remove eggs with slotted spoon and drain on a paper towel.) Placed them on the bread and it was yummy.

My husband, my 2kids, and I all liked this alot. I will be making it again. I used thick sliced maple bacon instead of adding syrup to the butter. The bread was almost too done by the end so I would recommend not putting the bread in the oven after you put the butter in, i would just put it all together, then in the oven.

A really tasy recipe, thank you. I only made 4 of these, one each but we could have easily eaten 2 each, they were so nice. I did overcook my eggs but thought, as they were, they would have been fantastic cold for a picnic. Next time, i twill only cook them for 13 minutes and trust that they are cooked instead of leaving them 15 minutes. Consider this a new family favorite. Oh, I only painted the bread on the inside if the cup, they didnt stick and tasted amazing xxx

These are great grab and go breakfast foods. Easy and quick to make. Eat right after making, because they don't reheat well.

Doesn't work well with less than freshest bread but still good.  Muffin tins overflowed, next time I will use a ramekin to cook a little quicker and for less mess.

Great recipe for your next brunch, convienent   enough to make to give the kids as they head out the door. Made mine with refrigerated crossant rolls. Just roll out the dough, cut to fit the muffin pan (I used the large muffin tin)didn't even bake the rolls ahead of time.  If you like your egg yolk soft or runny, cook the rolls ahead.  Used cooked chicken sausage and Quattro Formaggio (Trader Joe's). The possibilies are endless.

I missed the part where I was supposed to grease the muffin pan--big mistake.   I got them to come out of the pan but part of the bread stuck to the bottom.   I also beat the eggs (I only used 3 eggs) and I used bacon bits instead of cooking bacon.   I thought they were delicious and will make again.

Tasty.  Just made this as a very late night supper.  I think Mom must have larger muffin pans than I because I couldn't get the cream in on top.  The egg even overflowed a bit, but the cheese helped it stay in place.  I'll have to try again when I buy a jumbo muffin pan.  I wasn't able to add the maple syrup to the recipe because I don't have any.  I'm sure this tastes even better with it as the way I made it, with just the butter, was good, but I think the flavor would be improved with a touch of sweetness.

I have made these numerous times now. I use oversized muffin pan.  I love them with sausage instead of bacon. And onions too! I crack eggs in a bowl add cheese, S&P, cream and add sautéed onion. mix and put on top. Love it!

These were pretty good with a couple modifications.  I left out the maple syrup because we don't care for it and I also omitted the cream.  The recipe really doesn't need it, so why add the extra fat and calories to a dish that already has quite a bit of both?  My bread took quite almost twice as long to crisp up as the recipe states but that could be because I used homemade bread rather than store-bought.  I did find that a full slice of bacon was far too much for each individual cup.  Half a slice was plenty.  We'll definitely have these again sometime, probably for a brunch or buffet type meal.

I didn't use butter or bacon. I sprayed the cups in the muffin tin with non-stick cooking spray and flattened the bread into each cup. I drizzled syrup into each cup with bread. I took the advice of other reviews and mixed the salt with 6 beaten eggs and divided that evenly into the 12 medium sized muffin cups lined with flattened bread. I added about 1-2t teaspoons of milk to each. Then baked them for about 15-18 min or until the egg was firm. They were very good this way too. Much healthier as well.

Made it this morning for breakfast.  It was great.  My husband loved it.  He ate three of them.  Next time I make it I will leave out the maple syrup.  I will add some green onion or mushrooms.  Lots of varieties for this one.  Love it.
Very easy to make.

delicious! I didn't use the maple syrup because I don't like the taste so I added 1 Tbsp of butter instead . I used sliced homemade white bread and 3 turkey sausages (cut in little squares) instead of the bacon. next time i'll try it with whole wheat bread as a healthier alternative and perhaps cut down on the butter (or use a diet version of butter). my boyfriend suggested using cubed or shredded roast chicken instead of the bacon as a healthy alternative as well but I didn't think that would taste as good as this. next time i'll also double the recipe.

These were really good, although they did overflow the regular size muffin pan. I think this would also be good with biscuit or crescent rolls. We didn't use the maple syrup but I think next time I will do it for half. The family loved these!

We have been making a very similar recipe since the 70's, called "Egg Burgers" at our house.  3 hungry boys accepted these on "meatless" days.  A hearty multi whole grain type bread adds a great nutty flavor and texture. We leave the crust on the bread, more crunchy edges.  Spray tins with butter flavor nonstick, no need to flatten the bread, just mold bread gently into the tins with your fingers. No need to precook the bread cups, just drop in the eggs and bake.  Try   different cheeses, we like Parmesan.  Also try sprinkling a small amount of seasoned salt, paprika or Cajun seasoning on top. Enjoy!

This was a total hit. Took a little more time to prep then I thought but it's a nice saturday morning treat. I used scrambled eggs instead because I only had extra large costco eggs. Only needed 5 eggs instead of six.  and used half and half instead of cream and tasted great. Loved the sweet taste the maple syrup gave it--kind of like a homemade mcgriddle

These are very good. I would definitely recommend cooking them for 14 minutes though.  I cooked them for 10, and they appeared done, but the whites of the eggs were still fairly runny.  I don't mind runny yolks, but runny whites just isn't right.  So next time I will definitely leave them in a few more minutes.  But delicious, and a great idea!  A little time consuming to prepare though.

Easy and yummy!!!!  I double the syrup/butter mixture, but didn't quite use all of it, I would also like to try it with breakfast sausage, maybe maple flavored.  Either way you make it, these are so YUMMY!!!!!!!!!

Delish! They taste like McGriddles only ten thousand times better. For our second round we scrambled the eggs and omitted the cream, since it came out a bit runny the first time.

Couldn't resist trying this one out when I saw it in the daily email. Plus I just happened to have all the  ingredients. My husband loved it. I made it according to the recipe but I cooked them too long, when I pulled them out of the oven they didn't look done so I gave them a couple more minutes. Next time I won't do that I like my egg yolks runny. Thanks for a great breakfast!

Huge hit with guests ! Once I substituted almond coconut milk for the cream, and could not tell the difference. I also use turkey bacon with no problem all.

Original recipe from farm upbringing: butter both sides of bread and cut crusts off . Spray Texas size muffin pan with spray. Lightly push bread in and crack egg into each well. Pepper and salt. Bake at 350 until yolk done to your liking. Son likes little soft I like harder. Forget all fancy stuff.  Cut crusts from bread into small squares and bake for croutons with salad for lunch later.

The tip says to use foil paper to cover-- that's a no no with eggs-- unless you want grey or green eggs. Eggs interact with the aluminum foil.
Eggs (whole) were too raw for me. I mixed the eggs and baked -- much better.

These were pretty good. I feel like the measurements were off. I made 8 muffin cups but only used 6 eggs and I scrambled them like other reviewers because there was no way one whole egg would fit in the cup. I left the bread in a little longer to crisp because 3-5 minutes didn't seem like enough. I think I may leave them in a little longer next time because the egg still soaked through them making them hard to remove. Also, I think I still overfilled them a little which also made them even harder to remove. I think this is a good concept and with some tweaks the results could be better. Also, I could see making these without the syrup and adding some veggies and topping with salsa for a different twist.

Used the scrambled egg option per other reviewers recommendations. Also had no maple so used normal syrup. Great results. Definitely a keeper! Thanks for sharing! ??

This is great. Easy to make, and the family loves it. I made one change, I didn't use the maple syrup or the butter. I substituted the "Absolute best pancake syrup" instead.

Easy to make and delicious. I substituted honey for pancake syrup, added a bit of green onion and bacon and a couple shots of hot sauce per egg. Yummy!

My husband absolutely loved it. A different twist on your classic bacon & eggs type breakfast.  Takes time to prepare though, my only drawback to the recipe.

I would had mve put 5 stars but I noted that if one uses muffin tins you must make sure you have a large slice of bread.  Where I live the bread is in smaller loaves and it didn't make a cup and the egg overflowed.  I would say use a small egg, not a large one and next time I'm going to use two slices of bread in one cup and quite possibly use a deeper muffin tin.  Otherwise, I loved the whole recipe - including the wonderful maple syrup flavor.  Maybe other people used regular pancake syrup which doesn't have near the flavor of maple syrup.

Only 4 stars because mine stuck to the pan.  I'll use non-stick spray next time. Made four following the recipe for the adults and wow they were good!  Improvised for a kid friendly version (5 more "muffins") by putting the cheese and meat (added 3 pieces of ham lunch meat, diced up) in 5 of the breaded tins first, scrambled 4 eggs and distributed a 1/4 cup of the mix , then topped each with the heavy cream.  The scrambled version only needed to bake for 20 minutes. Kids gobbled them up!

Easy breakfast. Cute presentation. I omitted the maple syrup as I don't like sweet eggs. Have made it with crumbled bacon, diced ham and no meat, all variations are good. My kids really like them.

I loved these.  Didn't use the maple syrup though.  I've made these several different ways.  Different meats (or no meat) and different cheeses.  Yummy!

Wow, these were great!  The little hint of sweetness from the syrup in the bread was awesome.  I cooked it a little longer than suggested so the yolk would get harder and not run all over everything.  YUM!  Into the cookbook it goes.

I made a healthier version of these using chopped up sweet potatoes, spinach and scrambled the eggs. I also added a little water, which made them fluffier.

I made it for my Sunday School class and it was  a great success.   You can kick it up by adding other ingredients.  Just as it is is perfect for a group. It was easy, presented beautifully and was a hit. Thanks.

Made this morning, and these were delicious. I made a few tiny changes due to what I had in my pantry! Instead of bread I used tortillas, and I eliminated the maple syrup step. I also didn't add cheese (forgot!) or  heavy cream (didn't have). And added tomatoes & onion.  Served on a bed of fresh greens with a dollop of guacamole.  Everyone loved them. I'll make these again.

This recipe is fun and versatile. I have added spinach, chicken sausage, tomatoes, onions, peppers. etc. Only thing I highly suggest is not cracking each egg in the cups. I usually use 6-8 eggs scrambled and pour in. You can also use just egg whites. Each time I have made these I change what I put in.  No complaints yet

Used a whole-grain bread, and while nice texture, it was harder to remove from the greased muffin cups.

These were very simple to make. We really liked them, only thing is that a couple of the eggs seeped out of the muffin holder. Maybe put to much bacon in. I added parsley for decoration to!  I will make them again.

This was easy to make and so very good. I had no muffin cups so the bread did stick a bit. I will keep making these so I can perfect in not over cooking the eggs. Any helpful tips is appreciated.

I made these for my four year old son and me. We both agreed that we should make these again. I used diced ham instead  of bacon just because it was easier. I might try scrambling the eggs next time.

This really was easy to make and super yummy!  What I love about is that you can customize to everyone's preferences.  Maple syrup and butter on toast was a real treat.  Only wish that the recipe had told me to grease the muffin tins.  I forgot and everything stuck!

I will definitely make again.  I did make 2 changes - changed heavy cream to whipped cream cheese, and did scrambled eggs rather than  whole egg simply because kids prefer scrambled. It was yummy and the  hint of maple makes it really special!

Does anyone know how these "keep"?  Can I make a dozen or six and refrigerate a few for the next day or so?  Reheat in microwave or oven or toaster oven?

These are literally the best thing since sliced bread! My family wants to give a big round of applause to the genius who invented.  I like to cook it the whole 14 minutes for solid yolk. Also, we like more of the maple/butter mixture, mostly for more maple flavor.  Thank you for making breakfast fun!

The toasting of bread didn't happen very well. I ended up just putting the bread cups lose in the oven to toast after they were in muffin cup for a while. Then put back into muffin tin to cook. The egg filled the toasted cup and the cream spilled out making a mess to clean. Cream wasn't necessary and I won't use it next time. But it was a fun change of breakfast.

I made so many changes that I'm not sure it counts as the same recipe! I had to make it halhal so left out the bacon, therefore the maple syrup too!
Basically I made the bread casing, added eggs and once out of the oven still soft, I added bearnaise sauce and decorated with a home dried cherry tomato and basil leaf.  A variation of eggs benedict and dish much appreciated for a Ramadan iftar!

These were very easy and absolutely delicious, I didn't have maple syrup so I used karo instead, only egg whites and mixed a couple of cheeses. Also used wheat bread. It came out wonderful. I followed another reviewer to use a cup and make the circle for the bread then roll lightly.

I loved this one and am using it for my next Bunko!  Ingredients WILL NOT FIT  in a regular sized muffin tin. I used ramekins (it worked out perfectly). I like the idea of another reviewer who used the top of a drinking glass to cut a circle (this is a good idea). I will serve this dish with fresh fruit and hash browns. I used amt of butter to maple syrup but only had enough for 4 so I would increase the amounts on those a little to cover 6 slices of bread.  I liked the maple syrup/butter ratio as written, just needed a bit more for the six slices.  This is a definite keeper for me.

GOOD EASY FAST. We really enjoyed. Served with Tomato Salad from this site  and was a great Sunday lateish breakfast.
I wondered about Maple Syrup but went ahead. No need to worry, really added to the toast., followed the rest of recipe  as written. I did add a so tiny drizzle of oil over toasts for a little extra crispness. When adding eggs they did spill over toast but I had greased well and they came out beautifully. A nice little treat. Iloveit.

So yummy! I'm going to use jumbo muffin cups next time though--the egg overflowed from the muffin tins and I had to omit the cream and cheese because there wasn't enough room. Also I definitely wouldn't leave out the maple syrup--it gave the bread a really nice flavor!

Yum, quick and easy - what's not to like? I did make these with English muffins rather than bread just due to what I had on hand and also made them in big size muffin tins rather than regular, but I'm sure the taste would be just as good using the recipe as is.

This was absolutely delicious, and so, SO easy! The only change I made was that I didn't have any bacon (or ham), so I didn't put any in. But it was still super amazing.
I was hesitant to use the maple syrup - I wasn't sure I wanted "sweet" in it - but in the end I decided to follow the recipe and I am so glad I did. The syrup adds something special without making it "sweet" at all. It really makes it - I encourage you to keep the syrup in even if you have doubts.
The eggs and cream may flow over the edges of the cups but don't worry, it won't wreck it at all.
I will be making this regularly from now on.

I made small changes but only because I didn't have all of the exact ingredients. I used pre made real bacon bits (instead of cooking and crumbling my own bacon) and half and half instead of cream. My whole family loved it! Even my picky 6 year old. My husband and 11 year old fought over the last muffin! Definitely a repeat recipe.

Make it often. My family is always on the go so these are perfect to grab on the way out. Super easy. I cut the maple syrup when I don't have any and it comes out just fine. I have used sausage, chorizo, and ham instead of bacon when I don't have any.

Bread cup not large enough to accommodate egg. Egg spilled over making some not a very nice presentation. Bread cups difficult to remove from pan enough though they were greased. Won't bother to make again.

Fantastic fantastic fantastic!!! Made it with ham instead since I didn't have any bacon. Also topped the shredded cheddar before serving as they won't fit in the muffin to  any more after I cracked the eggs. But omg they were so yummy!!!

I really liked the taste of these.  And I love little complete meals In a cup like that.    I made it twice but the kids won't eat it so it won't be a regular.

This is a little nicer presentation of an egg biscuit, but the taste is average.

I made these for Easter breakfast and served them with sliced tomatoes on the side.  Delicious!  I thought that the egg and bacon wouldn't fit into the muffin cup, but with the bread adding a little to the sides, it was just fine.  The maple gave it a fun twist in flavor.  I think I have found a new Easter tradition.

I have made these many times now, and they are always a hit. It is my 22 yr old son fav. thing to make, and my picky 14 y old loves them too. I have fixed them with cream cheese too and that is or favorite so far... Great for quick brunches or  take for lunches...Yummy.

I made these egg muffins this morning.  I made just a couple of changes.  Instead of putting an egg in each muffin tin, I beat the eggs in a bowl, added salt & pepper.  I then poured the egg mixture into each muffin cup, then added the cream on top and the cheese.

These came out very good.  The only change I would make next time would be to use less salt as the bacon and cheese has sodium, so the muffins were a bit salty for my taste.

The best!  Perfect for everyday or a special brunch. Super easy and delicious. I will put a pan under them next time bc the cheese dripped to the bottom of the pan. Thanks!

Very good! I ended up only using half a slice of bread, as the whole piece didn't fit (I bought whole wheat bread with the rough, nutty crust that is rectangle shaped, so maybe bigger than some other square bread slices).  I used skim milk instead of heavy cream and scrambled the eggs.  They came out wonderfully.  Instead of using a rolling pin, I just used the bottom of a plate and pressed down on the bread, doing a few slices at a time. Also cooked my bacon in the microwave to save time. Thanks for a great recipe! I really like that is has a little bit of everything - starch, protein, dairy - and that it is filling and it is so easy to eat on the go.

This has become a staple of my breakfast menu.  Make it with whole or scrambled eggs or Egg Beaters, crumbled sausage or chopped ham or bacon.  Very versatile.  I use Peppridge Farm Very Thin Whole Wheat bread so I don't have to trim crusts or flatten.  Those who leave out the maple syrup are making a mistake-that little bit of flavor is very good. Try it.   I use way less of the maple syrup/butter mixture though, and keep the leftover in the fridge for next time. I would not recommend increasing the butter if you want to keep this healthy!  Everyone has liked it and I get a lot of requests for the recipe.

My bread stuck really bad to the muffin pan. I will make sure to butter it better next time. The maple adds a nice hint of flavor. Since I didn't have bacon (sad day) I used sliced ham and the muffins were still very good. I will try bacon and sausage next time!
