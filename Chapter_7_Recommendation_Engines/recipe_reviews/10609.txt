YUM! The folks at work went wild over these.  Only problem I had was the dough was SO sticky I couldn't get it from the spoon to the cookie sheet.  Refrigerating the dough seemed to help.

Yum!!!  I made these even more low fat by using fat free whipped topping and using minimal confectioners' sugar.  Great recipe!  Thanks!

These are very yummy and they look good too. The dough is sticky until you roll it in the sugar. The sugar helps it roll into a ball.

Love it! The favorite at my cookie exchange! I used spice cake and red velvet. Dropping them into the sugar and then rolling made them easier to roll.

VERY sweet, you will definately want to eat with tea or coffee, but they are fun. I pressed a pecan half into some of them and put coconut in others. They were fun.
