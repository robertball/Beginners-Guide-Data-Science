The very best meatballs I have ever had, and probably the best recipe I have ever found on allrecipes.com. One addition that I add to each meatball is to dice up some string cheese and place a chunk in the middle of each one. Makes the meatballs taste even better.

Excellent appetizer!  I cooked the meatballs in the oven on a broiler pan at 400 degrees instead of frying them to save time and clean up, and they were great.

I loved this sauce! I needed some Mexican appetizers for a party but didn't have a ton of time, so I just bought a bag of frozen meatballs and put this sauce together the night before. Then the day of party I just threw the meatballs in the crock pot with the sauce and a few hours later, they were done! Everyone loved them. I think I could have threw in about twice the chipotles though. Maybe the brand I got was a mild one. But I do like it spicy!!

Thanks for a great recipe. I'll definitely be making these again!

These were delicious! I followed the recipe almost exactly and they came out awesome. The only change I made was to add an 8 oz. can of tomato sauce to the diced tomatoes. We love spicy food, and therefore, LOVED these meatballs. I would not recommend them for the wimpy eaters!

These were fantastic. Keep in mind that you must love chipotle peppers to really enjoy these meatballs, and there are some people that just don't like them. For those that are leaving out the chipotle in this recipe and replacing with something else, you may be getting a good meatball, but you are not getting the meatball this recipe is intending to offer, you are getting a different meatball, and seems unfair to rate it. The chipotle is a main ingredient in this recipe. Thanks for posting your delicious recipe!

These were fabulous!  I did add more of the peppers and sauce, to make it more spicy.  I also added some parmesan cheese. My husband LOVED them. We ate them as an appetizer, along with crackers and cheese;however, I think the leftovers would be good over some rice.

Great flavor, though I would recommend using less chicken broth for a thicker sauce.

I'll be making this one again, these ARE addicting!  I was skeptical that so few ingredients could have much flavor, but I was pleasantly surprised!  The meatballs are excellent, and the sauce is fantastic!  I had to add some sugar to the sauce, as often is the case with tomatoes, as they always vary in their  sweetness.  I halved the recipe, and got about 90 one inch-ish meatballs.  I think I'll make them 1.5 inches next time as they shrink when browning.  Thanks for an easy yet wonderful recipe!

Very good, but the sauce thickens up a lot. I would suggest adding more tomato sauce to make it a little thinner.

The meatballs were delicious, and the sauce was just the perfect level of hot.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I used stewed tomatoes instead of diced (didn't have any diced) and I added chicken base to the tomato sauce instead of the chicken broth.  The sauce would have been too thin otherwise.

I like it spicy but the folks I live with (kids and hubby) didn't, so I added 1/4 c Miracle Whip and 2 T sugar.  It was still very spicy, but more bearable for them.  You can't taste the sugar or miracle whip.  I served it over spaghetti.

These meatballs were a hit with family this weekend!  It was the second time I'd made them - the first time I added an extra chipotle pepper and it was a little too spicey for us.  This time I stuck to the recipe and it still had a bit of a kick to it, but even my 4 y/o was able to enjoy it.  I baked the meatballs while I made the sauce to get away from 'fried'.  Then I put it into a crockpot with a can of tomato paste so that it wouldn't have that watery consistency that you can get with crockpot recipies - made a perfect sauce!  Had leftovers with mashed potatoes last night - yummy.  Originally served it with refried beans, homemade tortillas and some vegi's.  Delicious meal!

I made this and scaled it down using only ground beef. The sauce is excellent, I used two Anaheim peppers and added half a yellow onion into the blender. It paired very well with paella!

Took this to a potluck for my spanish class.  All raved and the instructor couldn't leave them alone.  There will be NO leftovers!!  Even my fussy hubby really enjoyed them, as did my 11 year old.  Not too hot, but with enough spice to make them enjoyable.

They were great I loved the sauce. I added some minced onion and fresh cilantro to the meatbals, just cause i always do.
I only made 1/3 of the original and I was able to get about 15 meat balls out of it. That was enough for about 3-4 people. I served them on top of buttery white rice with sweet corn. This recipe is a keeper :).

These are the best meatballs that you will ever have. My brother makes these for special occasions and they are always all gone in one night. He also adds cut up string cheese to the middle of each meatball, which makes them even better.

Excellent meatballs!!!  The best I've ever made or had!  Tons of compliments and requests for the recipe.  PLEASE NOTE:  There is a bit of spicyness to the meatballs - my friend fed them to their two year old and she started to cry because it was too hot.  But all of the adults and older kids loved them!!!

These were great.  The recipe as is makes a ton.  We ate them plain the first night with bread to soak up the sauce and then my husband decided to eat them in a meatball sandwich the next night as leftovers...topped with provolone cheese.  Great change from the normal sweet and sour or marinara meatballs.  They are spicy, but can be adjusted by changing the number of chipotle chiles added.

I made this tonight and it was awesome! Followed the recipe exactly except for adding the whole can of chipotles,  six I believe, only used beef, and I baked the meatballs @400 degrees for 15 minutes before adding to the sauce for one hour. Wonderful smokey heat in the sauce and perfect meatballs. I got 54 meatballs out of 3 lbs of ground chuck. I will be making this again and again, so delicious! Served with homemade salsa rice tonight but will try it on a toasted roll with some cheese too. Thank you for a fantastic recipe!

Even better the next day. If I were to make again I would not use any pork and also add more peppers. I also baked the meatballs instead or frying for a healthier alternative.

Very tasty.  I think a touch of sugar helped them out.  Just the right amt. of heat for most people. Served at a party and went over well.  Will keep them in my appetizer file and make again.

These were delicious. And ver spicy. I broiled the meatballs, and in fact clenaup was easier and the meatballs were healthier. I added more of the chipotle peppers(you can find at Mexican markets) since I love spicy food.  I also added a bit of sugar to the sauce since I was afraid that the tomatoes might be bitter.I also put less tomatoes and a can of tomatoe paste.  I put over some macaroni. My husband added some black olives and grated paramsean to make it a meal, next time I will put the mozzarella in the middle as recommended. I think these would be fabulous appetizers!! Thanks for the recipe!

These were very good meatballs. I used a whole can of chipotle peppers but I like it very spicy. I took them to my work and everyone loved them and ate them up. I followed the directions just like it said.

absolutely yummy! I will make again and again. The chipotle peppers add a nice bite to the flavor. I will be freezing the leftovers so we can enjoy this again and again. I did not make any changes to the recipe. Perfect just the way it is. Thanks for sharing this tasty recipe.

I made this for dinner last night and everyone loved it! And that's saying something since i coulnd't find any chipotle peppers and had to use a couple of whole chillies to get the spiciness instead. Will be making it again, thanks!

This is a great recipe.  As others have nmentioned, they are pretty spicey so adjust the taste if you are serving kids.  I made them for a party and everyone raved about them!  I loved the recipe as is - no modifications were made.

everyone in my family loves em. 
I took them to our family reunion and everyone asked I bring them again next year. easy to make and not too costly. good for an appetiser or even as a main dish just add a side of rice or pasta and you have a terrific meal. the only thing I did differently was bake the meatballs instead of frying. This is placed on my favorites list and I know you will love them too.

I love this recipe!!! I made it for a cocktail party and kicked up the spice a bit by adding more peppers. My guests loved it, but begged me to tone it down for the next time. I promise to stay true to the recipe next time. Best recipe I've gotten from this site... EVER!!!

Not bad but it was missing something; not sure what though. The only changes I made were to add finely diced onion to the meat mixture, and also threw in a small can of tomato paste to the sauce as it was a bit watery. The cilantro provided extra flavor but, as I say, it needed something else. Thanks though!

Very tasty.  I added some oregano and some ancho chili powder.  Also added 1 extra small can of tomatoes and used 5 chipolte peppers with sauce instead of two.  Yummy!

Made these for my daughter and I for dinner and we loved them! I used ground turkey for this, tomato puree instead of the diced tomatoes, nixed the salt and the cilantro and added chopped onion and chili powder to the meat mix and the sauce. Next time I will take others advice and put a cube of cheese inside each meatball; probably pepper jack. I served the dish over rice but I can see this being a nice little appy too. Delicious and thank you!

I've made these twice - once for my sister's bridal shower and again at Christmas. They were a hit both times! These meatballs are pretty spicy & not recommended for kids. This recipe makes a ton, so bring your appetite. Delicious!

Quick, easy and versitile!  Made with double the chiles and baking the meatballs for a speedy clean-up, these are now on our list of favorites.  One night with cornbread, the next with quesadillas and seedless red globe grapes, these meatballs made an after school, work and activities dinner enjoyable and satisfying.

Great recipe.  Very tasty!  I do add a can of tomato paste to the recipe to make the sauce thicker.  Just my preference.

These were good, but not really spicy like I thought they'd be. If I make them again, I will try to give them a little more "zip" somehow.

I used 2 lbs very lean ground beef and 1 lb ground pork. Otherwise, I used the exact ingredients in the recipe. To save time, I made the sauce per instructions, but did not brown the meatballs separately. I just put them in the sauce and cooked them for a couple of hours until they were done. Saves time, mess and the sauce picks up the meat flavor and vice versa. I did dice some cilantro and toss in towards the end. I used these as appetizers for a party and have a bit leftover, so I'll make green chile rice to serve them over. Thanks for the recipe!

I actually was interested in making albondigas soup, but opted for this recipe, making it into a soup by adding additional chicken broth- also when I was sautéing the chopped onions, I also included chopped cabbage- then added to simmering "soup."  Voila!

We made the dish for a 24 person potluck birthday party and it was a huge hit. These meatballs were the first dish to disappear at the serving table even though there were 6 other main course meat dishes. We made over 70 meatballs, but we were 15th and 16th in the food line. It was interesting to watch couples try the meatballs while in line and then load up the plate with these. By the time we arrived at the meat serving table, the meatballs were gone . We've made dozens of recipes from allrecipes.com and this may be the best yet.

Excellent appetizer for any dinner party. I followed the recipe as was listed, however I am one for tweaking it to my own taste.. The sauce was thin with the amount of liquids used, so cooking down the sauce first is ideal. No chipotle peppers at my  local markets so I used Habaneros peppers. Much more heat but oh so good! I also added finley chopped cilantro into the meat mixture. 
 These are definitely going into my recipe box for making again.

I added Mexican oregano, epazote and cumin to the meatball mixture and added oregano to the sauce.  Probably could have used a little chili powder. Recommended process is a little clumsy; I first browned the meatballs in a dutch oven, removed them and started in with the broth using the pan drippings from the meatballs.  One less pan to wash and saved the flavor.  Happy with the results, I'll do these again.

Loved these meatballs. I had to make 1 change due to having no tinned tomatoes so I added 3/4 a bottle of V8 hot n spicy which was delicious & like others I put small cubes of provolone cheese into the meatballs prior to cooking....will definitely make them again & again

These are really good.  With 3 chilis they are probably a little too hot for kids.  (You could probably use this recipe without the chills, add taco seasoning to the meatballs and cumin to the sauce and it would be good for kids, but then it would be a completely different recipe!) I made them low carb by substituting ground pork rinds for the bread crumbs.  I also added about a teaspoon of Splenda brown sugar to tone down the tomatoes' acidity.  I wanted a little more smokiness than the chipotles imparted so I added a few drops of liquid smoke.  For those commenting about sauce thinness: let the sauce simmer uncovered with the meatballs in it until it thickens to the consistency you want.  I let mine cook about 30 minutes uncovered and got a nice thick sauce that sticks to the meatballs.

Blew up the kitchen first time I made these but they are so worth it.  They are a favorite and I get asked for them a lot.  I do cheat and use frozen meatballs sometimes which is a real time saver.  Delicious!

Good meatballs - a bit spicier than I expected, however.
I served them with jasmine rice.  Makes plenty - enough to freeze for another meal.

Just made this for my bunco- they are great. I only used 2 chipotle peppers because some of the girls are wimps when it comes to spice, but it still has a nice, mild heat to it. I baked the meatballs at 400 degrees for about 12 minutes- much easier & the clean up was a breeze. This recipe made about 80 3/4 to  inch meatballs for me. I will definitely add it to my party food rotation!

Although I prefer standard Italian-style meatballs over this for meatball subs, it was certainly a nice change of pace. My family tried it both in buns and then over rice instead the next night. We definitely liked it over rice the best. I suppose it could also be served standalone as an appetizer with toothpicks....but then you'd waste all of that yummy sauce. I think it works best as a meal over rice (mashed potatoes would be good, too).

I was so excited about taking this recipe to a Mexican Pot Luck.  I can honestly say I was EMBARRASSED for people to try these.  (I wished I hadn't brought them.)
I followed the directions to a T, with two exceptions.  My grocer didn't carry the 'chipotle peppers in adobo sauce'.  So, I found some chipotle hot sauce and used that instead.  The only other thing I did vs. the recipe was letting the meatballs simmer in a crock pot after browning them.
The texture of the sauce was bad.  The meatballs were... just bad.  The pork/beef combination was awful.
i hope you have better luck than I did.
If you are expecting these to turn out like the pot luck fav, meatballs in barbecue sauce, don't.  They are nowhere near the old standby.
sorry.

I made this for a party and it was a huge hit.  I did add extra chipotles though.
