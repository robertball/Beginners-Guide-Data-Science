These brownies turned out PERFECT!  Instead of baking them in a 9x13 pan, I made them in an 8x11 so that they were just a little thicker and I followed someone else's suggestion for adding the second 1/3 cup of oil BEFORE the eggs and sugar.  I also added about half a bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips (I never make brownies without them!) and Oh My Goodness!  These were the best home made brownies I've ever made!  I've already put the recipe in my card box. :o)

This recipe is excellent and, if I could give more than five stars, I certainly would!!! First of all, because these brownies are non-dairy, my grandson can enjoy them along with the rest of the family.  This recipe bakes up into moist and flavorful dark fudge brownies.  I made two pans, one for work and one for my granddaughter's birthday party, and these were enjoyed by all.  At the party, I literally had people wrapping them up to take home before they were all gone from the pan.  My son-in-law raved about these the next day and said that they have a great "edginess" to them.  I think they have a very "sophisticated" chocolate flavor to them.  The only change I made was to add one cup of frozen Ghiradelli Bittersweet Chips to the batter just before baking.  I do agree with some other reviewers, the bake time should be lessened because even with the addition of the bittersweet chips and the use of two jumbo eggs, I only needed to bake these for 30 minutes.  (As a general rule, brownies should only be baked until they just begin to pull away from the sides of the pan.  I rely on this more than stated baking times as a way to avoid over-dry brownies.)  Trish, thank you for a truly wonderful recipe that will now be my standard go-to for brownies!!  Excellent recipe!!

These are really good---they aren't cakey and they aren't as fudgy as some other brownies I have made. I would say they are a good in between brownie--about an inch thick in a 9x13 pan. They are so easy to make. I added an extra 1/4 cup of cocoa (I used a blend of natural and dutch-processed cocoa); I also added a cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips and two teaspoons of espresso powder. My husband isn't big on chocolate or sweets, but he really likes these because they aren't too sweet. thanks for the easy and very tasty recipe!

To be a good sport, I tried making this recipe again and I had the same results.  They were dry and cracked on top and when I tried to slice them into pretty squares after they were cool, to take to a family function, the top cracked and the brownies fell apart into big chunks as I tried to slice them.  I added more cocoa this time for more chocolate flavor and I didn't cook them as long as before so they were very fudgy and chocolately this time.  If you want chunks to eat by hand or toss onto some ice cream, they are absolutely delicious this way.  But I never could slice them into nice squares; they just fell apart into pieces.  I will make this recipe again, but not to take to work or family get togethers as I can't get them to slice into nice pretty squares even after cooling.  The tops are a thin hard layer that crack when you try to slice, underneath the brownie falls into pieces as you try to cut them.  But overall, very good brownie to eat.

This is the exact recipe my mom used as we grew up. I even have it posted at my blog as coming from her, because I don't know the original recipe's author, since my copy of it is hand written. 

So I made this for a bake sale at our yard sale, and these were hot sellers! These are rich, dense, and fudgy! I made them in an 8x8 pan, baked for 40-50 minutes, checkig it. Cut into 9 big squares.

This is my only brownie recipe!  I lost my copy of the recipe a couple of days ago and instead of using a 'substitute' recipe . .I just didn't make any . .not until I found my copy.  These are so wonderful!  I must say that even if ten people used the same recipe, chances are there will be ten different results.  Some people just have a special touch . . .

This is my idea of the ultimate brownie. I made it exactly as the recipe was written and they turned out perfect. I wouldn't even add more sweetness - they were chewy, fudgy, and moist - even when left out uncovered overnight. I think my family still prefers the Dump Bars (also on this site) because of the chocolate chips but I found those to be on the dry side. I found my little slice of brownie heaven - thanks!

The first time I made this recipe, I had pockets of baking soda in the finished product.  I suggest sifting the cocoa and soda.  Also, it add the second 1/3 cup of oil before you add the eggs and sugar, or they don't stir well.  It also better to add the vanilla and salt in with the eggs and sugar, before the flour.  Try adding 1/4 to 1/3 cup chocolate syrup.

I don't think I've ever made brownies from scratch before even with all the baking I do... brownie mixes are pretty darned good. This recipe wasn't as good as I was hoping. The flavor is not intensely chocolatey and even with 2 cups of sugar it doesn't seem sweet. The texture isn't as chewy as I expected although it is fudgy and not cake-like. The recipe was easy and it was nice to use just a bowl and a spoon and not get the mixer out but I don't know if I will make this again. Be sure to cool completely before serving, for some reason they don't taste very good warm.

These brownies turned out more like a cake than a brownie.  I was disappointed with the results and won't be making this recipe again.  

The search for the perfect brownie recipe continues...

Sorry to be one of those who alters the recipe, but..... you must substitute real butter for the oil.  My family likes it so much better that way.  I stir the sugar and second 1/3 cup of slightly cooled melted butter into the chocolate to cool it down just a bit, then add the eggs.  That may prevent any cooking of the eggs as a previous reviewer experienced.  We also love this with a package of Nestle chocolate chunks added to the batter.  I feel the cooking time is too long.  I had much better luck baking for 30 minutes.  The batter just very faintly clung to the tester and they turned out very fudgy!  The edges have just a little crispiness so baking it for less time helps.

My family loves brownies, but we argue over fudgy or cake like brownies, this recipe pleases all! I did make 2 small changes. First I used strong coffee instead of the water and I added two squares of a giant Hersheys bar chopped very fine. The best brownies I have ever made! I have a new batch in the oven right now and I think I'll frost them with a homemade cream cheese frosting.

I made this exactly like it says and everyone has enjoyed them so far.  I usually bake for 32 minutes and then use a toothpick to decide when they should come out of the oven.  I also add chocolate chips as well.  This is a "sweet" recipe.

These were not good at all. They had no flavor, and my Fiance even said "are these suppose to be good for you or something, why is there no taste". That should sum it up for most of you. I used Dutch Process cocoa, I guess it could be the problem, but other than that followed the recipe to a T. I wouldnt reccommend these. Sorry.

This recipe was awful. They were very dry and had none of the chocolate flavor you would expect from a brownie. Will not be making this again.

This is NOT a fudgy brownie recipe, nor did it taste anything like a brownie.  I would say at best the texture is a cross between cake like and fudgy - with it being more cake like than anything.
I left out the baking soda and cooked it for less time and they still came out the way I did NOT want them too.  My quest continues for a fudgy brownie recipe.  :o(

I'm a cheater and used my mixer, and nothing terrible happened. I added an extra shake of cocoa (a scant 1/3 cup) and chocolate chips, since there were some comments on how the chocolate flavor was lacking. I thought these were AWESOME. I added pecans to half, and they're SO GOOD. IMO, they'd be better with butter, but I have that opinion about everything. I'll be making these again!!

I checked these after baking for 25 minutes because I thought 35-40 sounded like too much. They were already overcooked :( I think with a 20 minute bake time they would have been good and fudgy, but the recipe as is created a 3 star rating because they are dry and cakey. Next time I'll bake less, and I'm sure they'll come out at least 4 stars.

Although very easy to make, I did not love these brownies.  The consistency is chewy/fudgy, as described, but they lack flavor.  I added chocolate chips to the batter and they are still not chocolaty enough for my liking.  All I can taste is the 2/3 cup of vegetable oil and it kind of gags me.  I will not make these again.

These brownies got rave reviews from everyone who tried them!  I made mine in a smaller, square pan and substituted half the sugar with brown sugar.

I LOVED THIS RECIPE! It was awsome and it was deffinately a thubs up for the kids too. came out perfect to the T. I didn't alter this recipe at all, I made it exactly with all the original recipe and exactly with the directions given and I had no problems. Right when it was done I took it out and let it sit for 10 mins and then I threw it on the freezer for 10-15 min and it tasted even better. it was still warm!

I didn't like these at all.  I made them by mistake when I clicked on the wrong recipe and won't be making them again... this recipe is being deleted from my recipe box.  Not at all sweet despite two cups of sugar... very bland.

Followed recipe exactly and it was a mess..the top cracked and they were not good. Boxed mixes are better.. I always cook from scratch, but did not care for this recipe.

Won't make it again. Not enough flavour, not chewy like I was hoping. I am glad I read the other reviews and checked on doneness at 30 min; brownies were definitely cooked at 30 and my oven generally requires extra time on most recipes. If you do want to try this, check at 25 min.

These were not "fudgy" at all.  They are dry and cake-like.  Followed the recipe precisely, and baked for 35 minutes.  Might be a good brownie to frost, but as is, nothing special.  Sorry - won't make this one again.

I followed the recipe, and I was not pleased with the results. It was not chocolate-y or fudge-y enough. It tasted more like sugar than it did chocolate.

I like my brownies fudgy and rich, not cakey.  So I tweaked the recipe a bit: instead of the extra 1/3 cup of oil i used butter, added an egg white on top of the 2 eggs, and did not add the baking soda at all.  I also was a bit more liberal with my salt. So lets say 1/2 tsp. for the salt. I also put in chocolate chips and sprinkled roasted, chopped almonds on the top.  They were alright, good but i i wish they were chocolatey-er.......

This was my first time making brownies from scratch and its the last! i dont mean to be negative but according to my husband & everyone else who tried it, wasnt even worth the calories. Before i put it in the oven i tried a tiny bit & was in shock! because it wasnt even sweet! wheres the chocolate flavor??  so i added corn syrup, more coco & extra sugar! lol SORRY i just wasnt satisfied! oh & it crumbled apart as i was cutting it into squares!

Sorry but we ended up throwing the batch out because nobody would eat them.  I baked for only 20 minutes and they were still cake-like and not fudgy at all.  I wish I would have kept reading reviews before I made them.

I thought this was not a good brownie recipe.  It should have been cooked much less and had a bad taste.  I did not like these brownies at all.  I even made frosting and put chocolate chips on top to improve it, but it did not help.  These are not good and i would not recommend making these if you like good tasting brownies.

This recipe turned out more cakey than fudgy for me but definitely chocolatey. I added 1 cup chocolate chips. Next time I will reduce the flour to 1 cup, sub half the oil for melted butter, reduce the leavening to half and I bet it will be amazing.

These were pretty tasty, I didn't have any boxed brownies in the pantry and I'm trying to start making more recipes from scratch anyway, so I made this into creamcheese brownies. I think next time I'll use brown sugar like some of the other reviewers suggested.

Warning: these are NOT fudgy brownies! They are decidedly cake-like (at least when I followed this recipe). Look elsewhere to satisfy your moist chewy fudgy cravings...(and let me know where you find it!)

This was a great recipe!  The brownies where chewy and yummy!  I used 1 cup of cocoa powder and only baked them for 25 minutes to ensure their chewiness, other than that I followed the recipe exactly.

The brownies were more than chocolaty enough, they were chewy and I got good reviews from my family.  I did add one package of chocolate chips to the recipe and the only thing I would suggest is to take them out of the oven at 30 min of baking or they will be hard as a rock.  I would even suggest checking them at 25 min of baking if using a 9x13 inch pan and not adding 2 cups of chocolate chips.

Gave this a 5 because I can finally say I can bake a brownie from scratch that is delicious! Only had whole wheat flour so I reduced it to 1/2 C. Also used 1 1/2 C sugar and 1/2 C splenda (ran out of sugar but since this worked well and reduced the calories slightly, will likely do it next time as well). Definitely reduce baking time if you like them soft and chewy.

I followed this recipe exactly, and was not at all pleased with the results. After reading all of the positive reviews I feel like I may have done something wrong, but I can't think of what.  These brownies were cakey, not fudgy, and were almost bitter tasting. I wouldn't try out this recipe again, but if I did I'd definitely substitute some of the cocoa powder with semi sweet chocolate chips, and I'd replace the second 1/3 cup oil with butter.

wasnt as chewy as i wantes; fudgy on top, cakey on bottom, chocolatey, good but not great. my gut was telling me to use 1 egg, that wouldve made them chewy for sure.
i noticed afterward that i used extra-large eggs. they made it more cakey.

Really good recipe. Simple ingredients, and easy to make right in one bowl. It came out nice and cakey and chewy. I did make some additions..but thats just because I like it sweet. I put some dolce dileche(caramel) in the mix, as well as a handful of choco chips. I baked it for 30 minutes, and that was perfect. :) lovely recipe.

The store stopped making my favorite brownies so I decided to just make my own since I had all the stuff to do it anyways. I choose this recipe because of the great reviews. The brownies turned out amazingly! I added a quarter cup butter instead of the second oil and a bit more sugar and milk chocolate chips. The product was an ooie gooie dark chocolate brownie! This recipe is great but I would have added in the description that this is more of a dark chocolate brownie.

I made this as is. I wish i would have checked on them sooner at 34 minutes in my preheated oven they were overbaked around the edges. Once cool they crumbled when i tried taking them out of the pan. The flavor were okay but i won't be trying these again.

ONE OF THE BEST BROWNIES I'VE TRIED TO MAKE!! The only things I did differently was use 1 1/2 cups sugar (just a preference), 1/4 tsp of mint flavouring, and chocolate chips on top. Mmmmmm so moist, dark fudgy appearance and just enough crispness on the edge.    I baked it in a 9 x 13 glassware and only 30 minutes. The brownies didn't break apart so I was relieved.   Try these brownies, you won't be disappointed!!

These are great!! I was looking for a brownie recipe with oil, so they'd be  more healthy (I used canola oil). Also, I cut the sugar to 1 3/4 c. and used 1/3 c. whole wheat flour 1 c. white flour. Couldn't even tell. SO GOOD!! I also added the oil all at once, as some had suggested.

These were excellent. I made them this weekend, because I really wanted brownies but I didn't want to get out in the ice and snow to go buy baking chocolate squares and butter. So I searched for a recipe that used cocoa and oil instead...and this is now my favorite brownie recipe. They are nice and thick, fudgy but not too dense or gooey, they cut well and they're soft but not too cakey. I used 1 c. cocoa for extra chocolate, and that was perfect. Also I used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white (just personal preference-I do this with all my brownies) and added 1 c. chocolate chips. The bake time was also just a tad too long for my oven, you might want to check these at 25 minutes just in case. As written these were probably 4 or 4 1/2 stars...but the final product was 5 star, and I decided to balance out some of the older, negative reviews this recipe got.

This is a very delicious brownie - it's dark and rich. I like that it isn't overly sweet - the flavors are more complex. I added chocolate chips, and they were so yummy! Very fudgy and chocolaty.

These brownies were not good.  They stuck to the pan, had lumps of flower in them, and did not cook evenly.

I tried this recipe since it sounded good, fudgy brownies always sound delicious. I was a little skeptical about the amount of unsweetened cocoa powder that went to this recipe but figured it can't be bad if it'll make the perfect brownie. The baked product was absolutely disgusting... You can even see from the picture how dark the middle is, there is way too much cocoa in this recipe. The large amount of sugar didn't make up for the bitterness of the cocoa, and I didn't find anything fudgy about these brownies. I baked it according to the recipe and I've made lots of brownies before, that didn't turn out this way. But then again, we can't argue about preferences on taste. If someone likes their brownies this way, give 5 stars for the recipe :D

Very good for standard brownies using ingredients most people have on hand (and more economical than a mix!) Will definitely be making these again!

I'm not a great brownie lover but my girls are. When my oldest tried one of these she said, at last a proper fudgy brownie. Looks like I won't be using any other brownie recipe. Thankyou.

very easy to make and nice and fudgy.  By mistake I used an 8x8...would not recommend doing this, as the edges are perfect but the inside is underdone.  I did add 1 tsp. salt and vanilla each.  Very moist.  Not cakey...but fudgey good!

I followed this recipe almost all the way, except I took them out after 25 minutes. They were neither chewy or fudgy! They were very cake-like. I won't be making these again, sorry :(

Fudgy Brownies are a very good treat, they are chewy, not too sweet and very chocolatey. They are quite easy to make and have a nice texture to them when they come out of the oven, I reccomend this recipe to anyone because it is very tasty.
As much as I enjoyed this recipe, I think it needs a little more sweetness to it. Perferably milk chocolate chips, so when you bite into the brownie you get more taste and its much sweeter. 

Thanks for your time,
MeAtLoAfS

Followed the recipe to the letter. Used the same temp and pan etc.  So disappointed because I love anything chocolate. The batter turned out to be a sticky paste and trying to spread that in a floured pan was frustrating to say the least. After it baked, the taste was bland...will not try this again.

I followed this recipe as is, only adding 1/2 cup of chocolate chips just before incorporating flour.  I used 9x9 pan to make them super thick and just baked a tad longer than this recipe states.

I have been looking for a fudgy brownie recipe and this is it!!!! Brownies are one of my grandsons favorite dessert.I made these brownies about two weeks ago and my family devoured them! I followed the recipe as written. Remember do not over mix or over cook the batter. I started checking mine at 15 minutes and I took them out of the oven at 20 minutes. My grandson said these were the best!!!  Don't forget you can add a scoop of ice cream to the top!!! ENJOY!!! YUMMY!!!!

Doubled it. It's thick but not cakey or dry. Moist moist moist! I frosted it with an entire can of fudge frosting (to save time over making frosting). Fabulous! My teen son who isn't too big on chocolate was amazed!

This is definitely my favorite brownie recipe! I usually add the salt and sugar before the boiling water first so they will dissolve into the batter better. I never everrr use anything to measure but the 1/3 cup, 1/2 cup, etc.. to make this recipe since it is so easy to add too much flour or not enough liquid. They are PERFECT with 1-3 cups of semi-sweet, dark, and white chocolate chips! (I usually just pour in partial bags) They are so rich and yummy! But do make sure to let the batter cool before adding your eggs (large eggs are best) and don't over mix the batter or it will become more cakey. Try it!

I love that these dont requiere butter so they aré more cost efficient to make. I added about 2 handfuls of chocolate chips to the batter and sprinkled them with pecans before baking. I also used half a cup of strong Coffee instead of plain hot water to bring out the chocolate flavor. I have never had these cold because they always disappear before they cool.

I read a lot of the negative reviews, and frankly I don't understand the problem. Some were saying the brownies were like cake, or were not fudgy, or were dry. So I decided to make them for myself. While I was making them, I knew they were going to be fudgy, moist and chewy just like a good brownie should be. I followed the recipe to the letter, and they were some of the best I have ever had. So don't let the negative reviews keep you from making these, because they are awesome!

As a brownie addict I have to say these are one of if not the worst brownies I've ever had.  Even adding coconut and rolos and eating them hot didn't help.  I will never make this recipe again and refuse to give them to friends and taint my reputation for making great food.  Back to my old tried and true recipe :)

Turned out great.  I cut the sugar a little bit to suit my preferences(and added a bit extra flour instead), so they were a little less fudgy and more cakey (but that was due to my changes).  Even with the changes they were delicious :)  I only baked for 30 minutes and they were done, any longer would have burnt.

Perfect fudge brownie! I wouldn't change a thing except if you want a little extra chocolate kick, add 1c. of semi-sweet chocolate chips (or whatever you have on hand). Mine baked in just 30min. Wonderful flaky outer, yummy fudge center! Amazing!! (Warning! Be prepared to try and have self control after your first bite!! So hard to stop eating once you've started!) Be sure not to over-stir, just until mixture has come together. Over stirring causes a tough brownie instead of a fall apart in your mouth one. Enjoy! These come together SUPER fast too!

easy way to tweak this recipe: use dark chocolate cocoa powder instead of unsweetened, substitute the vanilla extract for raspberry and after you pour it into the pan spoon raspberry jam over the top it makes delicious Dark Chocolate Raspberry Brownies and the jam on top makes them a tad more moist

I was ecstatic to find this recipe here!  It was my all-time, favorite from-scratch brownie recipe and I had lost it. If I remember correctly, it was featured in magazine ads for Hershey baking products in the early '80s.  In the original recipe you are advised to measure the boiling water accurately and not overbake the brownies.  I was always careful to do these 2 things and the brownies turned out perfectly.  Better to check them at the minimum baking time than end up with a giant brown doorstop.  Thank you again, Allrecipes!

So yummy!!  I actually had exactly 1/3 cup vegetable oil left, so for the 2nd 1/3 cup, I had to use Olive oil. They came out pretty awesome though!! My hubby loved them!

Tested these ahead of time for a church function. Pretty well pleased with the result, though I did make one small change first time, i.e., I substituted unsalted butter for the first 1/3 cup oil. Texture was perfect, chewy but not gooey and still moist & tender. Flavor wasn't as strong as I would like - needed more salt (probably because of the unsalted butter), and I'd prefer a more intense chocolate flavor (I'm a dark chocolate lover!). Next time I'll increase the salt to 1tsp, add some instant coffee, double the vanilla, and add bittersweet chunks or morsels on top. If that works, I'll bring it up to 5 stars!

After looking online for a good brownie recipe, I stumbled on this one....  simple ingredients almost everyone has in the cubboard.....  
I used Special Dark cocoa, peanut oil, and 2 t. vanilla as well as adding 3/4 bag chocolate chunks, and almost an entire bag of pecan pieces.
DELICIOUS!!!!!
I'm sending this recipe to everyone I know, and will make it often.
SO SO easy, and SO SO chocolatey, fudgy good!!

Just a very good, fudgy brownie. My only problem was I put them into a container while they were still a little warm, so they stuck together. :)

YUM! I was looking for a simple recipe with ingredients I always have on hand, and this is it! Sweet but not overly so, not cakey and not too dense, this is my new go-to recipe. I will say that I used mini muffin tins instead of a 9x13 pan, but that just meant that every brownie muffin tasted like a corner piece- crispy on top and soft on bottom. No more boxed mixes for me!

Due to my wife's diabetes, I replaced the sugar with baking Splenda. The result was a dry, crumbly mess. I reduced the baking time to 25 minutes, and, even then, the brownies turned out thin and chalky. I will be looking for a different recipe in the future.

I have searched high and low for the perfect brownie recipe, and this is not it. It is perfectly fudgy, but the taste is lacking. If I make it again, I will use 1/2 to 1 cup less of sugar, and use butter for the first 1/3 c of vegetable oil. The taste could be so much better, but the texture is good. As it is, the taste is shallow.

I was hesitant to make scratch brownies after an attempt years ago, but we wanted brownies. Chewy and fudgy and easy were the words that reeled me in, and I was not disappointed. All ingredients on hand, easy to put together, and they surely delivered in the chewy and fudgy department! I won't buy another box mix with this recipe in my box. (I did add a few chocolate chips as I was just shy of the 3/4 cup cocoa recipe called for)

After reading reviews, I am thinking there may be variables with ovens. I have a gas oven and always have to cook things a little longer. All told, these were in close to 40 minutes, and were that somewhat gooey, but that's how we like them. The top crust was to die for! 

Glad to have a super brownie recipe in my "scratch" collection ... right along side Grandma's Decadent Chocolate Cake! Ummmm!!

I am an avid baker and also an avid brownie baker due to my boyfriend's obsession with chocolate and brownies. These brownies were so bad. At first I thought it was because I over baked them but it was just bad. They were way too chewy. They were not fudgy like I thought they would be.

I've been making brownies FOREVER and my quest for the perfect brownie recipe has come to an end! These were perfectly amazing brownies, moist but not gooey, rich and chocolatey....I did however add some mini chocolate chips and walnuts to my batch.

The texture was perfect--Nice and fudgy/chewy with a nice crust on top.   The flavor was good, but not great.  They're just missing something.  I might try adding espresso or choc. chips next.  This recipe is definitely worth tweaking and trying again.

For those who can't get them to cut--I didn't try this, but I saw someone on tv (Alton Brown I think) make brownies and they lined the pain with parchment (with over hang), popped them out when they were still hot, cut them into squares with a pizza cutter, and them put them back in the pan.  I think it would work with these.

I just made these this afternoon to fill a craving.  I thought they were good.  I liked the fact that they weren't overly sweet, but they had almost a bittersweet flavor that I wasn't expecting.  I made it exactly according to the recipe.  Next time, I will add some milk-choc pieces or something to counteract that bitterness.

I REALLY wish this was more fudgy, like the Bread and Cie brownies we get around SoCal. I added the 2nd part of the oil before the eggs and sugar. I tied it with the chocolate chips and it was ok. This time, Im gonna melt a bag of chocolate chips and mix it into the batter.

I have to say, this is probably the best brownie recipe I've ever used!  Often people compare homemade brownies with brownie mixes, so I'll say this: this is a little different... and BETTER than store-bought brownie mixes.  I secretly want to make these every single day :P

OH MY GOSH!! this is really perfect! i just made this and it turned out great. i actually thought it might not work since i've read those bad review but you just really have to taste it to believe! :) i actually did customize the recipe as i thought it won't be enough to fill my pan. it's a little bit crumbly but to me it's just perfect as this is the first time i scored in baking from scratch.

I have been looking for a brownie recipe that is NOT cake-like. Every time I make a brownie recipe they always come out cake-like. Yuk! I decided to try this recipe last Wednesday and I have already made my second batch last night. All my kids raved, and raved and wanted them packed in their lunch. One even came home last week and said "mom I shared my brownie and all the kids said this was the best brownie that had ever eaten!!!" I cannot thank you enough for this recipe. We finally found our brownie recipe that we will stick with. The best part is...they are so easy to make and I always have the ingredients on hand, so I can whip some up in no time. I truly believe that the boiling water/oil concoction is the secret to these. Do not change a thing, these are the best!

OMG! So yummy! These are the best brownies I've ever made, including store-bought mixes, and I have tried a lot of different recipes. I made a couple of changes -- I substituted brown sugar for half of the white sugar; I substituted 1/2 cup butter for one of the 1/3 cups of oil; and I added about 1/3 cup chocolate chips. They are really the perfect combination of cakey and fudgy and are not too sweet. Perfect!!

This recipe is amazing! I found that adding about a cup of milk chocolate chips and a half of a cup of walnuts was a great addition to make them extra chocolate-y with a nice hint of flavor from the walnuts!

I made these because they contain no dairy products.  As others suggested, I increased the cocoa by a quarter cup and I replaced some of the oil with applesauce.  I found them to have more of a cake-like consistency as opposed to being fudgy.

These are indeed fudgy!!  Nice flavor & moist texture... especially while still warm.  So good with a cold glass of milk.  It's too bad the ratings don't allow for 1/2 stars as these are definitely a strong 4 1/2 based on the flavor and the simpleness of the recipe.  During baking the batter rose up quite a bit, but then compacted as they cooled.  They also fell apart a bit when I cut them, making them a little messier than the brownies I'm used to.  However, since they tasted good, presentation didn't really matter.  I'll definitely make these again to see if it happens the next time as well, or if it is due to my mixing or perhaps a problem with one of my ingredients (older baking soda?) or even if my baking time needs to be adjusted.

I loved these.  I had all the ingredients on hand and made them exactly according to directions.  They were delicious, and I had to restrain myself from eating the entire batch all at once!  To be sure, one review docks the recipe for inability to cut them neatly - however, I have zero reason to have high presentation standards for brownies, so this didn't matter to me a whit.  So if you're looking for something to sell in a pretty package, this may not be what you're looking for.  But if you're looking to serve happy people straight from a brownie pan?  PERFECT.

Great brownies! They turned out extremely fudgy, with a crunchy top.  I found they were so easy to cut, which is often a challenge with fudgy brownies.  I didn't think they were very sweet, but they certainly were chocolatey.  I will defnitely make this recipe again, but will probably try adding a bit more sugar or some chocolate chips to sweeten them up.

These are the best homemade brownies I have ever made.  They aren't too sweet, and they are moist and delicious.  The only variation I had for this recipe, was I used an 8x8 pan, and baked it for about 40 mins.  You won't be disappointed.  I like a traditional brownie, no fancy additives.  This fits the bill!!

Fantabulous (there aint no word like tht but if there were this definitely would deserve it!!)
I cut the recipe in half and it still was perfect.I also forgot to add the semi chocolate chips and yet it is awesome!!But you will need to bake only for about 25-30 minutes.
Oh and if you want it to go on your christmas platter, dust the brownies with a confectioner's sugar to give it a festive feel and look!
Sweetness and fudgy-ness all perfect.Thanks a million Trish!

This was an eh-OK brownie. I made this just as the instructions called for, except for 2 things: I didn't read carefully and I used hot tap water (steaming hot, but not boiling as it called for), and I baked them for only 30m. Other than those 3 things, I made them just as written. Yet these are NOT fudgy. They turned out like cake. Dry, dense cake. They were not burned-dry, more like crumbly cake-dry. Hope that makes sense. Having said that, they were not BAD - just not as advertised.  Also these brownies were very chocolaty, yet only mildly sweet. Again not bad,  but it calls for 2 cups of sugar! That's more than enough, yet they didn't turn out sweet?! Last word: If you are looking for dense fudgy, sweet brownies this is not the recipe. But IF you are looking for a recipe that doesn't call for butter (cuz you have none), as I was - this is worth taking a chance on. Unless you are looking for FUDGY brownies :/

i thought this recipe was great! it was very easy to make. the only reason i gave it four stars was because it wasn't quite as fudgy as i had hoped. it was still very tasty. i even added chocolate chips which made it even better!

These. Right here. I've been trying to find a fudgy brownie recipe and this is the one! I baked them only 30 minutes and the texture was wonderfully chewy and dense. It must be the boiling water that makes the batter all thick and puddingy. I would increase salt to 1/2 t. I added a few chocolate chips and some pecans. Can't stop eating them!

I liked these.  I put wet ingredients(except boiling water) together and then dry. I mixed gently,then added boiling water and 1 c. choc chunks. I used 7X11 pan.  Turned out nice.

OK, so I just made this recipe about 2 hours ago.  The only modification I made was baking them for only 25 minutes.  They are plenty fudgy and have a good taste.  The only thing that I might add – to enhance the chocolate flavor even more – is 1 or 2 tsp of instant coffee to the boiling water!  OR just use hot coffee in place of H2O.  These do taste similar to boxed and are just as easy. Be sure to use baking SODA not powder I suspect that may be why some say they are cakey.   TIP- When its hot use your exhaust fan for an hour to keep the kitchen cooler.
UPDATE: turns out these were no so wonderful.  They had some chewy things - perhaps cooked egg since you stir them into the cocoa & boiling water.  The next day they tasted very bland and not really chocolaty. Warm from the over when you are having a chocolate craving they will pass.

These turned out really nice, I used parchment paper on the bottom of the pan and through some mini chocolate chips and 1/2 cup of coconut in the batter. I'll make these again, thanks.

Quick, easy and fudgy! There was a little crust around the edge, but I LOVE that part!  Will go perfectly with ice cream and hot fudge sauce for a pastor's luncheon today!

All I can say was these Brownies were AMAZING.  I cooked these for my family and basically there was nothing left except crumbs on the dish.  My relative said, and I quote "Take these away from me or I will eat the whole dish."  They were very good, and I followed the recipe EXACTLY.  Definitely for the chocolate lover out there.  I used Hershey's unsweetened cocoa by the way.

Thought I lost this recipe and was having a bit of a panic - no other brownie recipe will do. These come out perfect for me every time - crispy corners and squidgy middle, dark, rich, chocolate...exactly what you want when you are craving brownies.

BEST RECIPE EVER! I've tried maybe 6 brownie recipes before and I never liked any of them, and I didn't understand why everyone else's brownies tasted so good and I could never make them myself. But I have finally found a recipe that I love because doesn't taste like fudge and it doesn't taste like cake; it tastes like a brownie.

mmmmmmmmmmmmmm!!!!! perfect!!! fudgy and sugary, these brownies pack a powerful chocolate punch, especially when chocolate chips are added in! the only change i made besides the chocolate chips was to be skimpy on the baking soda (didnt want too much rising). Perfect for those of us who despise those cakes passing themselves off as brownies. Gets a sugary crust on the top and sides. Let cool completely before cutting! if u cant handle a uber sugar-chocolate rush, DONT TRY THESE. if u like cakey brownies, DONT TRY THESE. period. yummilicious brownies, yum yum yum yum yum! i cant get over these (obviously). Very easy to make. need i say yummmmmm again? =D

Very tasty.  I made these with whole wheat pastry flour and sucanat instead of sugar, and added some walnuts as well.  They didn't come out "fudgy," perhaps because I didn't use white flour, but they're delicious, easy, and I will probably make them again.  I LOVE that there's no dairy or solid shortening in these.

Very , very good.  I added one cup white chocolate chips, which formed a sugary crust at the bottom and was delish!  I made them for a group of high schoolers, and they were gone within minutes.  I will definitely make these again!

This was a good recipe - I prefer fudgy brownies to cake-like brownies and this was somewhere in between.  I think it would be better with chocolate chips as it seemed to be lacking something. But overall, good recipe that I will use again.

Very good!!  The best thing about these is that they are dairy free!!! I cant have dairy products and these don't require butter or margarine which both contain dairy. I sifted the cocoa and soda as another suggested and also added the salt and vanilla right to the batter instead of w/flour. These are fudgey and moist and great. Highly recommend.

Very good and easy to make with ingredients I had in the house.  They were fudgy, not cake like.  I followed the recipe, but used egg substitute.  I will make again, but include a little more salt to enhance sweet flavor even more.  Thanks, Trish!

Great fudgy brownie recipe! I followed it exactly as written, didn't add any chocolate chips as some suggested, but I did use brown sugar in place of white-only because I was out of white. The brown sugar made NO difference in taste. I will make this one over and over. I like being able to make it with oil, I alwasy have that, but don't always have butter around the house. Thanks for the great recipe!

Delicious and very easy to make.  I baked in 9X9 as I like a thicker brownie.  I took them out of the oven at just over 30 minutes and they were great.  I didn't have any chocolate chips to add as suggested by other reviewers but will definitely do that next time since I love things rich and gooey!  This one is a keeper!

As everyone said, this was easy and besides that, it was excellent!  If you follow the directions, you just can't have a failure!  I did everything in the cuisanart and per someone else's suggestion, I did add the milk chocolate chips and these brownies were soft, fudgy, and rich,all of which suits me fine!

I have been searching for this recipe, too!  I made it once before, and assumed it would remain on the Hershey's box forever (silly me!)....it is absolutely the best brownie I have ever had, with a deep, rich, dark flavor.

I had tried many brownie recipes and these were the best I have ever made.  I took them to a potluck dinner and they were the only dessert that was completely gone when everyone was done eating!  Also, everyone just raved about them, they were that good!

The brownies took A LOT longer to cook than the time it says. It took almost an hour to cook all the way through and it is outrageous.  While making the brownies, the batter seemed almost like a dough, ODLY thick.  the top was hard as a rock, while the inside was still quite liquified. I will not be making these brownies again, and I do not recommend.

Great recipe using ingredients you have on hand.  I used butter instead of the oil, though.  You have to have real butter in brownies!!! Cooked for 35 min. in 9 x 13 pan.  I served with a scoop of butter pecan ice cream and a fresh strawberry garnish... amazing!

I give it four stars only because they could be a bit thicker for a 9 x 13 pan. I want more brownies than an  an 8 x 8 pan would make! I also added all of the oil in it once and added a big splash of black coffee. Moist & simple brownie recipe

These tasted great, but came out a bit too cakey for my liking (though everyone raved about them regardless). Baked for 30 min because the closest oven temp I could get is 180 C. Next time I think I'll check it a bit sooner and maybe add less flour. Apart from that I added 100g chopped walnuts and a chopped up barone - will definitely do that again.

Disappointed.  Brownies weren't fudgy or sweet.  I added chocolate chips, but otherwise followed directions exactly.

I was looking for a brownie recipe since I didn't have all the stuff on hand to make my usual recipe.  Gave this one a try.  I followed the recipe to a T, as I do whenever I make a new recipe, and this was just.....bad.  No flavor, and hard as can be.  Won't be making this one again.  Sorry.

These brownies were moist and delicious; just the recipe I have been looking for! There are no fancy ingredients; I typically have everything on hand for these. They are perfect for when I need a spur-of-the moment chocolate fix. Bonus: they make a full 9 x 13 inch pan of brownies for a larger crowd... or for dessert all week long, ha. I followed the recipe exactly, and made no alterations. They turned out great!

I followed the recipe 100 percent.  They turned out dry and cakey.  Not at all fudgy like described.  They also had no chocolate flavor.  They even gave me a stomach ache.

I made them yesterday. I did add some left over semi-sweet chocolate pieces I had.  About maybe a half a cup.  They didn't need anymore for us. I didn't put any nuts in, but I will probably next time.  Now to see how the kids and grandkids love them. Thank you for this recipe.

Don't know who taught  you to cook, but evidently someone who doesn't know to blend oil and eggs and sugar first.(Called creaming together)  Also the use of 2/3cup of oil is unneeded when you already have 1/2 boiling water.  If  you need more liquid add more water, not more oil.  Your dry ingredients should be added last and would keep you from needing the additional oil.

It's a pretty good recipe! Although my brownies were kept covered after baking, they still got rock hard near the end of the day and after. I would suggest adding sour cream to the recipe to keep them moist. But other than that, they're wonderful, and even better with a fudge frosting!

The only change I made was to add a cup of chopped walnuts to the batter. They were delicious.  I have made a very similar recipe before given to me by a friend but lost it in moving. I was so glad to find this recipe as I don't like using bar chocolate but always have cocoa in the pantry. These are so easy to whip up with only pantry ingredients on the spur of the moment.

If you are looking for a really sweet brownie that is crunchy on the outside and corners and chewy on the inside, this brownie is for you! My grandmother thought this was the closest recipe to her mother-in-law's that she has ever eaten. She loved them!

A simple recipe that is great when you are running low on ingredients like butter, chocolate, or dairy.

But if you prefer a really creamy, smooth, and chocolatey brownie, than this recipe isn't for you.

It all depends on your preference.

Note: I did sift the baking soda and cocoa to avoid the lumps and added the 2nd batch of oil before the eggs and sugar as other users suggested.

They came out cakey but seeing the reviews maybe I actually did something wrong, i did it following every step, but maybe because of height difference (mexico city) i need to add more oil or something, really tasty tho

I will definitely keep this as my go to recipe. I love my brownies chewy and fudgy at the same time. So this was right up my alley. I like that the ingredients are stuff u already have in the cupboard. I made minimal changes to the recipe.I replaced the first 1/3rd cup of oil with 1/3rd cup melted butter.Replaced 1 cup sugar with brown suger.To avoid sugar granules in the baked product. I added the sugar to the cocoa hot water mixture and mixed with a handheld mixer till almost completely dissolved. I also added chocolate chips and a chopped up candybar.

I made some changes to this recipe so I don't feel I can fairly give it a 5 star rating, but in all fairness, I think it deserves 5 stars! My husband is diabetic so I was looking for a sugar free brownie recipe. I saw this recipe & read some of the reviews. I thought I would give this one a try BUT replace the sugar with Splenda! Both my husband & my son (non diabetic but feels sugar free is best for him & his 2 yr old daughter) after their taste test, raised their eyebrow & said "Wow, these are good!" When I told them they are sugar free, they both were seriously pleased!!
My only comment on the original recipe is I baked mine in a smaller pan (7" x 10") because the recipe clearly does not make enough for a 9" x 12" pan. I also baked for 30minutes and brownies should be baked for 28 min to get a nice constancy, in my opinion. This recipe is very easy and  the chocolate flavor is perfect for us, not overpowering. Yes, I will definitely make this again!!! Thank you for sharing your recipe!!!

I did not bake the entire 35 minutes either. They were done in 25. Also, I added pecan halves. I love the flavor, very rich and not too sweet. The consistency is something different though. Not quite like a cake but not as chewy as I like.

Absolutely love this recipe. I've tried so many brownie recipes and this is the only one that i use over and over again. Just 1 question tho, the eggs here where i live are quite small in size. I cant find any large eggs. Should i add 1 more egg for this recipe? I've been using 2 all this times but i just wanted to make sure.

I wanted a fudgy brownie that wasn't too sweet and these turned out perfectly! The texture was nice and smooth and they were nice and chocolately without being too rich. I ended up making them with whole wheat flour, since it was all I had on hand. You can't tell a difference, and it makes them a little more guilt-free!

Yummy!!   Made it with my brownie pan and each brownie came out fudgy inside.   My wife said they were good but she liked a boxed brand better.   Next time I will add some chocolate chips to it.

Super easy and yummy!  If you want them fudgier, cut the cooking time to about 20 minutes. The toothpick will come out a lil sticky and fudgy.

This was the best recipe ever and I have TRIED ALOT of brownie recipes... The brownies came out fudge not cake like. I needed a recipe that used oil instead of butter and this worked very well. I did add all of the oil at once though. Oh and I also added chocolate morsels. YUM!

Great Recipe, Quick enough! Ingredients are simple. The texture is a bit different than most brownies and I love this texture, its like a cross between a nice cake and a brownie, but not as sugar loaded

It is a very simple recipe. It is very nice to use it and pour it in a muffins pan it makes about 1-14 muffins

This is a good recipe.  It tastes to me like it needs salt, so I will add more salt next time.

These are wonderful! Not too gushy, not too cakey, just right. I used this recipe as the base for the cheesecake brownies on this site instead of a mix. Very yummy.  This will be my new go-to brownie recipe. I will probably try it with half white whole wheat, mint extract etc. I halved the recipe so the bake time was shorter (30 minutes) but otherwise followed the recipe as written. Thank you for posting this great recipe!

I give this recipe 5 stars. I cooked them for 35 minutes and the edges were crunchy and the rest chewy.   I frosted them with a melted mixture of peanut butter and chocolate chips.  My family and friends loved them!!

Decent brownie recipe. The top was not cracked like a lot of complaints, but I have to agree on the too sweet/no chocolate flavor. I'm not mad I made them, and they will be eaten. I liked that I had everything in the pantry and made them with little to no effort. Was on the cake-ier side as opposed to a nice gooey or fudgie one but it cut fine. I substituted a little vanilla bean instead of the extract (had that on hand, go figure.) I also added a  small handful of walnuts I had sitting around in the pantry. (Baked for 25 min.)

Hands down much better than store bought!  My sons have a dairy intolerance so I'm always looking for dairy free recipes. Bake time was exactly 40 minutes and they came out perfect.  Just told my husband these would be great warmed up with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

This is my go-to brownie recipe.  It's so easy and has never failed me.  I love that I can make it in one bowl, with two measuring cups.  Makes clean-up really easy, too!  Even my 8-yr-old can make it by himself,

I tried this recipe since most of the reviews were good. Its a very easy recipe, but as an experienced baker they didnt cook right, fell in the middle and tasted more like oil than a wonderful chocolate brownie. I wont be using this recipe again.

I made this recipe as written. The brownies were chocolatey, sweet, and fudgey. I needed to make 2 tray of brownies for a school function and only had one box mix. I quick looked up recipes and used this one. I'm glad I did. These were way better than the box mix. Just a tip...I have always had trouble cutting brownies no matter what recipe. I let them cool completely and still they would crumble and stick to the knife. Then I read in an article that you should always cut them with a plastic knife. That did the trick!  Now they come out looking good every time.

These are hands down the easiest brownies (and some of the best tasting ones) I've ever made. I think the secret is the boiling water. When you first pour it in, it looks like it's going to be a bit soupy but after a few more turns of the spoon (I only up use a wooden spoon when I bake brownies) and it thickens up nicely.

I really liked this recipe, I was looking for more fudgy than cakey and it delivers. I'm lazy so used the Jamie trick of crinkling and wetting the baking paper instead of greasing and flouring the pan and it worked perfectly. I added semi-sweet chocolate buttons to amp up the chocolate but still found it to be less chocolatey than I like. I think my cocoa let me down and I will try another brand next time. I used Cadbury. I topped with powdered sugar (why not?) and it did flake when I cut it but that's part of the charm. Thanks for the recipe.

Been using this recipe for a while now! Everyone I make it for loves it! I suggest using cocoa powder instead of flour for dusting the pan, though. It leaves a prettier brownie.

My brownies were more cakey than fudgy and I followed all the steps exactly. 

According to my research, I should put less flour. I always have more success with box mix.

I made these as a base to my S'mores pie.  They were very fudgy and moist.  I added some chocolate chips but they weren't necessary.  I made as written except that I added the second 1/3c of oil before the eggs as the other reviewers suggested.

Ran out of butter, and found this baby, thought that oil seemed kind of out, but tried it regardless, a GREAT RECIPE. Very versatile and the taste is fantastic. Could try reducing the amount of oil if you're not too comfortable..

My husband is not a fan of fudgy brownies so I added a extra egg to make them more like cake and these came out perfect! I will say that once cooled the top went down a little, but that was no biggie. I want to add Kahlua next time per hubby's suggestion. Made them this morning and by noon half were already gone. Thanks for the great recipe

Great basic fudgy brownie! I did a cream cheese topping and the not-too-sweetness of the brownies worked perfectly! These are moist and not at all fudgy. Note though: when following the first few steps the batter looks...weird. Then you add the eggs and other oil and it's great, but something to be aware of! Also I used an 8x11 because I wanted them extra thick - yum!

I made these recently and the texture was beautiful - moist, chewy and almost melt-in-your-mouth. However, in terms of flavour I found them a bit too sugary-sweet and lacking in the rich chocolatey flavour that I like in my brownies. I'll definitely be making it again though, and maybe adding more cocoa and chocolate chips to enhance the flavour.

I made this last night and I appreciate the fact I could use ingredients I had around the house. I try to cook with homemade items  and avoid processed mixes as much as possible.

I used oil and added some extra chocolate chips to the batter. I felt these were a bit dry and not very fudge like. It's not a bad recipe and my husband and son liked them.

Delicious!  I doubled the recipe. I have to take a pan to a Bible Study tomorrow, but wanted to taste them for myself first.  I also put a dozen Ghirardelli dark chocolate and raspberry squares in the middle of each pan (layered brownie batter, squares, more brownie batter).  These are probably the best brownies I have ever made, bar none.

These were so good they were gone by morning! I added about 1/4 tsp more salt and sprinkled chocolate chips on the top to melt. Other than that it was brownie perfection!

I cooked mine in an 8x8 glass pan for 50 minutes. The edges turned out AMAZING! They were chewy and everything i wanted it to be. The insides were fudgy but not brownie type fudgy. I know it's picky but it wasn't bad. The tops were hard and cracked pretty easily. I guess that's what added to my dislike of the center. It was too much of a contrast. And they tasted sweet but kind of bitter. Overall i liked them. My prego cravings drove me to this recipe and i'll use it again. Unless i find a better one. Lol. But i have yet to find the perfect homemade brownie recipe.

How can you call this recipe fudgy?! I need to make a frosting for these "brownies" because they are so cakey. This wasted my ingredients and now I have something I don't like to eat. I will still bring them in to work tomorrow, but instead of being proud I will feel like I should explain myself.

I LOVE these!  I usually do the box mixes am I am too picky about them. So I ran a search and up popped this wonderful recipe.  My husband says these are the best he has ever had :) It is the best chocolate craving killer ever!  Especially for us females who have that horrible craving ever so often ;) I will never buy brownie mix ever again.  They work up so quickly too!

I used the flour I had on hand, which was self-rising and I do not recommend it - it becomes brownie batter encased in a chocolate cracker crust!  
Otherwise, this was an okay brownie.  The flavor was just not quite there for me and I don't think the flour can be blamed for that.

I used this recipe, but did make some changes... I added 1/2 a bag of semi-sweet morsels and about 4oz of sour cream... I baked them in mini muffin pans in cupcake holders and they turned out fantastic! My family loves them!

This was my first attempt at baking brownies, though I bake all the time.  I followed the recipe exactly, though I accidentally used a little more cocoa powder than stated.  These were exactly how I like my brownies.  Gooey on the inside, flaky and a little crispy on the outside.  I'm very pleased. :)

Its like everyone else said, you can taste the baking soda, it falls apart and cannot be served as little squares, and its not very sweet. The stuff from the box beats this.

Great brownie but I did make these small changes: I used a cup of unsweetened cocoa powder but only 1 cup of flour. I used a total 1/3 cup of olive oil and then a second 1/4 cup olive oil. To make up for the lack of oil (and fudgy-ness), I added in semi-sweet chocolate chips - this made the brownie extra yummy (probably about 1/2 to 3/4 cup). I did make another change and put only 1.5 cups of white sugar. The brownie was still sweet and very fudgy.  I also baked in a 8X8 to make it more dense. Yum! Thanks!

Normally, I like extremely fudgy brownies, but this recipe may well change my mind.  These brownies were the perfect balance between fudgy and cakey and would please anyone.  I used 1-1/2 cups sugar because I ran out at that point, and they were the perfect sweetness for me (I like a little less sweet.)  They were good slightly warm, and even better the next day!  I had no problems at all with them being too crumbly or hard to cut.  Wonderful recipe!  Thanks!

I 'm not sure what happened but they baked up VERY unevenly.  The top was rock hard and the bottom was gooey.  Definitely going to pass on making these again.

I wasn't too crazy about these brownies. I guess I prefer a brownie made with melted chocolate (baking squares) as opposed to a brownie made with cocoa powder. These had kind of a blande taste, not very chocolatey. They were quick and easy to make, but wasn't too impressed with the flavor!

These are very good brownies.  Easy to make. This will be my brownie recipe from now on, much better than any mix and simple to make.  They did tend to fall apart and that's why I going with a 4.

i added peanut butter chips to mine, and some caramel bits. also, i used half brown sugar and half white. the brownies could be a little more chocolatey, but i think this is an amazing recipe for using no butter.

As a baker who doesn't take much risks,I follwed this recipe to a tee. I was doubtful about just stirring the flour in without beating. Oh my! was I wrong! These brownies came out perfect!Fudgy with a cracked surface...just pure deliciousness! Will definitly try these sgain:D

This recipe was not quite what I was hoping it would be. It didn't seem very sweet (even with all the sugar) and my 5 person family all agreed it seemed to be lacking something, although none of us could figure out what that 'something' could be... As a previous rater commented, the brownies aren't as good warm as they are cooled. We ate them, but I doubt I'll be making this recipe again.

these were super yummy! I suposse they are not as sweet as one would think due to the 2 cups of sugar, but, I had no marg/butter on hand and this recipe came up so it was easy to do. I had to bake for the full 40 minutes and even then the toothpick didnt come out 'clean', but, it made them more fudgy...the way I like them...and the crust, well theres nothing better than a brownie crust!!

These were ok. Like another reviewer said, they're not sweet as you eat them but have a very sweet aftertaste. I prefer brownies to be very rich and these really weren't. They were missing a flavor that I can't put my finger on. It's not that they were terrible, they just were not as good as some boxed ones. I probably won't make them again.

Fairly good, although if you want closer to store bough add chocolate chips or canned icing.  This is very oven-sensative which is why I think there are so many opposing reviews.  My brownies were done at 25 minutes, and they came out quite fudgey.  I'm going to make it again with scalded milk instead of boiling water to see if it gives a little more richness.

I love the texture of these brownies! Really moist and fudgy. The first time I made these I followed the recipe exactly and they were ok. I made them again using melted butter instead of the second 1/3 c of oil and they had a better flavor.

I don't know why, but brownies never turn out good for me. I bake cakes, pies, cookies, but never had any luck with brownies. I made sure to pull them out before they were completely done and they still hardened after cooling. As some reviewers have said, they weren't sweet at all, actually quite bland. I will continue looking-thanks anyway.

I can't give it 5 stars because I made revisions to it. I added 1 cup each of semi sweet chips and chopped walnuts and 1 Tbsp. of espresso powder. It made it an extraordinary brownie.

awesome brownies, worked perfectly, very fudgy and chewy, almost too sweet.  These would be really good with chocolate chips stirred in, but are absolutely delicious without.  These brownies definitely satisfied my chocolate craving. I will make these again.

They were very crumbly, but VERY fudgy. Deceptively sweet (even without frosting). As in, they have a very sweet aftertaste that you don't notice while you're eating it. I would make them again, but put them in a smaller dish. I think if they were thicker they'd stay together better.

I thought these brownies were quite good. Maybe not the best I've ever had, but they were dense, chewy, chocolatey, but not overly sweet. I added a little bit more cocoa powder as recommended by a reviewer. And I put powdered sugar on top. They are a nice change from the "Best Brownies" I usually make, which are somewhere between cakey and fudgy.

These brownies were okay. I actually prefer just the boxed mixes to these. I added semi-sweet chocolate chips to them. I guess they just weren't sweet enough for me. It's just my personal preference I suppose. To be fair, I only tasted a little piece of them. My family devoured them in a few days, though. I probably won't take the time to make again.

I did not like these at all.  I read reviews before I made them and decided to add about 1/4 cup more sugar since they weren't sweet enough.  I also added a few chocolate chips and drizzled peanut butter on top.  Still....not good.

i loved these brownies! my whole family loved them too. They are just as good as boxed brownies, just as easy, but you know whats in them. The only problem i had was for some reason 35 minutes was too long for my oven. Next time i will cook for 30 minutes and see how they do. thank you so much for this recipe!

These came out very cake-like and a little bit rubbery for me. My roommates really liked them, but I made them specifically because I wanted fudgy brownies, so the lower rating is because they don't fit the name. I did like that they weren't too sweet, but I don't think I'll make this again.

I used 1/3 cup whole wheat flour in addition to the 1 cup all purpose flour. I like this recipe since it does not require butter or margarine like many brownie recipes. Mine required additional cooking time, needed aprox. 1 hour, in a glass 8 X 12 pan. THey were very tasty and chewy. I topped mine with a cooked frosting. YUM. DH enjoyed.

My little sister has always been the "Brownie Queen" until now... This is a fabulous recipe and almost as easy as making them from a box.  Everyone raved about them and couldn't believe I made them from scratch!  I will definately be using this one again.

Great Brownies! I enjoyed making them as much as eating them.  My husband is not big on chocolate and he liked them as well.

Perfect brownie texture, but they were not rich and chocolatey enough to merit the name "Fudgy Brownies."  They lacked oomph.  I have renamed this recipe as "Chocolate Flavored Brownies."

I have a knack for ruining recipes that involve a lot of chocolate, but I was able to pull this one off without a hitch. The brownies came out chewy and delicous, but be prepared, because they are very rich.

I brought these to a family gathering and they were gobbled up within minutes. Great recipe, very chewy, and extremely chocolatey.

I've used this recipe for over twenty years and everyone from family to co-workers love it!  I even had to give this to my cousin for his wedding!  This is my favorite brownie recipe of all time.

Really chocolatey and delicious. I made them with raspberry chocolate chips and they are even better!  These puppies pack quite a calorie punch though.

I made this recipe for family & friends who all thought it was just as good (if not better) than a box brownie mix. I will be making this again!

This recipe is awesome!  The brownies come out so dense and are great the day you make them, and even better the day after.  I made them for Thanksgiving, and everybody loved them!

Yummy!  The consistency is more like a spongy cake than a brownie, but i'm not complaining!  I substituted some egg beaters for the eggs...maybe that's why.  Still, they're very moist and soft.  You'll love 'em!

I have been looking for a recipe like this one -- brownies that are chewy and made with oil instead of shortening.  They are delicious.  My whole family likes them better than the ones from my old recipe.
