These are great! I would have given them a 4.5 if possible. They are very rich and would probably be better in smaller portions. Making them in Madeleine pans would be fabulous. Or you could just reduce the butter. Here's what I did: I HALVED the recipe, didn't heat the eggs and sugar in a double boiler (too lazy), used 1/2t cardamon, didn't add pistachios (didn't have any), and added 2T more sugar. I think the recipe probably doesn't need more sugar, but in the future I would reduce the butter and make the cakes in Madeleine tins.

I made a no nuts version and substituted vanilla flavored yogurt for the plain.  They came out great.  I will make them again.  They were not hard to make either.

This are the best muffins I have made,please do follow the recipe,I made half and they turned out delicious.
I am from Yazd and  this recipe is the closest anyone can get,thank you so much for sharing.i have made these at least a dozen times now and my mom bought some yazdi cakes from a Persian  bakery and these are way better than the ones from the bakery,just follow the recipe and the outcome is delicious and worth the effort,I bake them a few minutes extra so they are nice and golden brown,just keep a close watch as every oven is different.definitely a keeper forever and ever:) thank you once again:):)oh and I did sprinkle saffron along with the pistachios.
Today is November 4th 2014 and I have made these muffins over and over again!everyone who eats them appreciates them,well worth the effort one puts in to make them.. Simply delicious,God bless you for sharing this excellent recipe:)made them for a charity this weekend:) and made them several times over ....delicious

I made this cake and it tastes amazing!!!! I had gotten the recipe for this cake in the past and it never tasted the same. I think the fact that this recipe has yogurt instead of milk and has rose water makes it so good! I absolutely loved it! Thank you!

I usually use 1 1/2 cup AP flour and 1/2 cup rice flour. It just gives it a depth of flavor that you can otherwise only get when buying these from the city of Yazd itself. I don't do the whole eggs and sugar over heat thing either but I make sure that my eggs are room-temperature.

I used Greek yogurt and this recipe was delicious.  I didn't get the whole effect since I left out the rose water... don't own any.

I was a little worried that it wasn't going to go right because the egg and sugar part didn't come out correctly and I used self-rising gluten free flour. But they were absolutely delicious and my roommate who doesn't like stuff she doesn't know loved them. I would suggest anyone to make this!

These were really delicious. My husband, who's Iranian, has requested them as a regular muffin. 

I made a few changes: I added 1/2c. of rice flour for the flavor profile, reduced butter to 1c., and reduced sugar to 1c. It took 40 minutes to bake each dozen!

The city of Yazd is famous for making really sweet sweets, but my husband prefers the slightly sweetened version of Yazdi cakes. Next time I'm going to reduce the sugar to 3/4c. in my search for the perfect slightly sweetened Y cake.

I made this today for my sweet 90 years old Persian mother in law and she loved it!!! I added one extra tablespoon of rose water and some saffron... It was beyond amazing. And easy!  My only issue was that it was a bit dense. I'm new to baking....could be that I over whipped it. Anyways thanks for the awesome receipe. Will be making these for a longggg time!

I tried the recipe step by step as in instructions, and the result was amazing. It tastes exactly like original yazdi cakes from home, the same shape, same texture, same smell. It was great, thank you!

Love these.  I make a point to try something different and Ramadan (or another religious holiday) gets me thinking about unique foods.  I also looked up Yazd, Iran online and found it very beautiful, especially the buildings.  Thank you for sharing and the cultural experience that came with it!

I made this recipe in order to use up some rose water that I had lying around ... and it quickly turned into a family favourite! I ended up making it for one child's birthday, at their enthusiastic request, and everyone loved them. Now I keep rose water on hand so I can make these cakes with some regularity :)

I'm not sure how I feel about these. They are good, but not great. They barely rose. I feel like it could have used more of every thing, cardomam, rose water, sugar and baking powder. As is, there is a hint of sweetness, a hint of rose water, and a hint of cardomam. 

I think I might try it again in a Bundt pan and experiment with increasing one or all of these ingredients.

As is, it would go good with a sweet tea.

I tried out so many variations of the cake yazdi recipe to find the real thing, and nearly gave up on it.  I'm so glad I came upon this one.  This is the real thing!  Thank you, Shahrzad!!  I added a touch more rose water and a small pinch of saffron.  AMAZING!

I have tried it and it's simple and delicious as snack with milk
for children.

I'm glad to meet many recipes from around the world in this sight.

but it was better if it had a video to show how to cook clearly .
