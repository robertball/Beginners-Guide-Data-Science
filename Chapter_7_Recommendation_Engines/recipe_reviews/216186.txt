Just a quick reminder from the author; those are more like baked empanadas rather than dumplings.

These are yum, As an Alternative to baking, I drop the eggs from the recipe and make the dumplings and steamed in a bamboo steamer for 20 minutes... and then I serve with sweet and sour sauce... yum....

So, the word dumplings might be a little misleading. Yummy delicious feta stuffed biscuits is a little more like it. These were a big hit when I made them. I used egg beaters, light sour cream and fat free yogurt and they still tasted awesome. I recommend these as a dinner roll or breakfast biscuit! Yum!

I must have made these wrong.  They were really hard and thick and the cheese never melted.  For all the effort, I was disappointed.

I made it. They taste nothing like the real pogaca (I was born and raised in Turkey). They taste like a crusty southern biscuit with cheese in the middle. Too dense dough, not airy like a pogaca. Also the taste is way off. You shouldn’t call these pogaca. I’d recommend naming them something like a “pogaca style southern buscuit”. If you are looking for a pogaca recipe find a Turkish recipe and follow it. They use wet yeast in real pogaca and it tastes nothing like this.

Had these with soup. Great dough recipe, can be used for other fillings. I would not call these empanadas...Dumpling maybe. They are fluffy like a biscuit.

I found the dough to be too sticky and flavorless. I increased the flour by a half cup and added garlic powder and a little salt to the dough. Also, I replaced the paprika with zatar to give it a little more of a middle eastern flavor and made a yogurt dipping sauce on the side.

Turned out pretty good but I like using either Armenian or Turkish cheese instead of Feta; feta was a little too strong. I recommend only half the paprika. Otherwise, you won't taste the dough. It is very similar to ones my mother used to make. Also, I baked it 30 minutes, I may even go longer depending on how crispy we like it.  Thank you.

These were easy and delicious, but a little dry. We made up a quick garlic butter to dip them in, and that made them fantastic.
