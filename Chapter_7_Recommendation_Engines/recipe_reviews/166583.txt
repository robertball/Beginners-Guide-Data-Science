Wish I could give this one more than 5 stars... These were the best turkey burgers I've yet to make! I did use 2 chipotle peppers because we like our food spicy, and they came out just right. I was afraid that using 2 of them would overpower the meat, but it did not. Now here's a GREAT tip to keeping these tasty burgers moist: instead of adding a slice of mozzarella on top, make 8 thin patties instead of 4 thick ones. Put a heaping tablespoon of finely shredded mozzarella on the center of 4 of them and then top each with the other thin patty. Then just seal up the sides of the burger. That way, when you bite into one of these yummy delights, the cheese will ooze out of the middle. Even my husband enjoyed these, (he ate 2 of them!), and he NEVER has been impressed with any type of turkey burger! Thanks for submitting this one; I'll be making it again for sure!

This was soooooo good. I just made some. I like spicy so I took other people's advice and put in two peppers. I also upped my cilantro and added some cumin. I was going to take a picture, but I ate it before I could. Next time maybe, but no promises!

My husband and I have never tried turkey burgers before but this recipe sounded interesting.  I made it just the way it is written except didn't have mozzerella so I used provolone.  I served it on whole wheat buns with sliced orange tomato.  It was delicious but next time I would use another chipotle b/c we like it a little spicier.  Our burgers were not dry at all - they were perfect.  I served sliced orange and red tomatoes and sweet corn on the side and we ate outside - perfect meal for a hot and sunny day!  Thanks for the recipe!

MAKE THESE BURGERS TONIGHT!!! Looking for a change of pace from tacos made with turkey meat we decided to try these burgers. All I can say is wow! It's cold here so I cooked on the electric indoor grill for about 7 minutes. Topped bun with lettuce, avocado slices (a must) and Mont Jack instead of mozzarella (personal preference). Followed others' advice and used two peppers. Just enough heat. Hubby was blown away. So impressed, these burgers will be a staple in our house. PS don't skip the cilantro, it adds a wonderful fresh taste and an extra layer of flavor.

These are GREAT.  I make tons of these and then freeze them raw to be made when we need something quick. They make a really easy, healthy quick meal when we are in a pinch.

This is great! I made it with chicken breasts (cubed 1 lb of breast meat, flash froze cubes for twenty minutes, then whizzed it up in food processer, I also added 1/2 cup chopped  mushrooms, my trick for keeping lean meat burgers moist)  AND I accidentally added 1 tsp cumin (working on 2 meals at once!) but I loved these so that's going to stay in my recipe version.

This was our first time trying turkey burgers so we were a little nervous!  However, no fear--they were great and we enjoyed them very much.  It was funny at first to decide on how to top them.  I added mayo to mine on the bun, but my husband used salsa.  Overall, this was a nice, tasty, and quick meal.  We will def. make this again.

Fabulous burger! So juicy and flavorful. I like them extra spicy, so I used 2 chipotles. I used sharp cheddar rather than the mozzarella. I served mine on whole wheat buns with lettuce and tomato and southwest bean and pasta salad on the side.

These turkey burgers were delicious and just as the submitter states "spicy, yet wonderful"! I used minced garlic vs. powder, vidalia onion and cut back on the onion powder and seasoned salt. I also added 1/2 tsp. of smoked paprika for a little flair. These came out moist and full of flavor. I served these on toasted 7 grain rolls with fresh crisp lettuce and thin sliced tomato - YUMMY!

Amazing! I did add 2 peppers but I took the seeds out of them so I could still have all the smokey flavor of the peppers without the extreme heat. I also added 1/3 cup of panko bread crumbs and 1 tbsp of greek yogurt for extra moisture. I put them in the freezer for about 2 hours to firm them up and then cooked them. OMG they were so delicious I didn't even use any cheese. I did however top them with a chipotle mayo sour cream that I like. It's just 2 tbsp. fat free sour cream and 1 tbsp low fat mayo with as much chipotle pepper as you like and about 1 1/2 tsps of  the adobo sauce. Awesome with some sweet potato fries!! Can't wait to eat the extra patties that I left in the freezer.

I hopped online in search of something new and tasty to try for dinner tonight. My boyfriend loves spicy food so this one caught my eye. The burgers were superb! I stuck by the recipe up to the last bit of pepper.  :)  Very yummy indeed. Four stars!   ((He added a little honey chipotle sauce to the top of his while it cooked, he said it was so hot and delicious, almost too much to bare. Why men like food that hot is beyond me. lol, enjoy! ))

These were awesome tasting burgers. I never had or made a turkey burger before, but I will be making these again for sure.  I did use 2 chipotles, and Jalapeno Cheese because we love spicy !!! I also thought it was a little too moist when I was mixing up the ingredients, so a dash of breadcrumbs was addded to the mix.  I did not put anything on my for condiments, but I thought Mayo, sour cream or salsa would be complimentary, but they were awesome just plain. I will also try them pan frying...and may even experiment with them for a meatloaf. This is a keeper !!!!

Another vote for a 5 star recipe!! I took the advice from a couple of other reviews and mixed all the chiles in the Magic Bullet, and used 1-2 T. Also, cooked them on the George Foreman grill. They were so good! Not dry at all! If you are trying to stay away from red meat (like we are), definately make these!

Yes! These burgers are AMAZING! I'm so grateful to have found this recipe. I'm training for a marathon, and while much of my training diet consists of healthy carbs, I've been searching high and low for some good poultry recipes to avoid the monotony of cooking yet another chicken breast. I've been reading about the benefits of dark meat poultry -- a new thing for me as I have always stayed with the white meat -- so for this recipe, I wanted to purchase half white meat and half dark meat ground turkey. Inadvertently, I ended up buying ground turkey thigh and ground chicken breast instead. Chicken. Turkey. Even beef or salmon -- it doesn't matter. This recipe (in my opinion) would be excellent with all of those! I followed another reviewer's suggestion and upped the chipotles to two. So tasty. I can't wait to make these again and share it with those I love. That is what great recipes are all about!

These burgers are AMAZING!!! My husband and I love spicy food, so I used 3 chipotle peppers. I also didn't have any fresh onion, so I used 1/4 cup dried diced onion. I let the meat mixture sit in the fridge for about 10 minutes so that the flavors meld and the onions get soft. The mix of flavors between the cilantro and chipotle is absolutely delicious! They cooked perfectly on our George Foreman grill in 7 min.

Always trying a new way to add some flavor to turkey burgers  and this definitely fit the bill!  This was really good!   We like a little extra spice, so, I used 2 chipotle peppers and about 1 tbsp of the adobe sauce.  I was out of seasoned salt - so I used montreal steak seasoning instead.  I topped it with a sauce made of 1/2 cup mayo, 2 tbsps sriracha hot sauce, and 1 tbsp of lime juice.  We cooked in a covered skillet on the stove top and it was moist and juicy.  Definitely will make again!

This looked good but after the burgers were ready I'm thinking ok do I just use mayo? mustard? how to dress this. My solution was to mix 2 parts mayo to 1 part of the adobo sauce. Topped with lettuce and tomato and raw onion and bam we have kicked it up a noche!

OMG!!! This was absolutely incredible.  Only changes I made were to add in some cumin and 2 tablespoons of the adobo sauce along with the pepper to the meat mixture and I used fresh onion and garlic.  I also replaced the mozzarella cheese with pepper jack.  YUMMY!!!!!!!

Finally found a turkey burger worth eating.  Found this recipe in the middle of a COLD Wisconsin winter.  To cold to even go in the garage to start the grill....so pan fried.  Yummy.  Kids loved them as well.

I did follow another's suggestion and added an egg, fresh garlic and roasted red pepper. I also put the patties on parchment paper on a cookie sheet in the freezer for about 20 minutes. This really helped the patties stay firm and not fall apart during grilling. These were great and next time I will make a double batch and freeze the patties.

I have made this 4 times, using ground turkey, ground venison, and no meat at all.  People ask me for the recipe every time I make it because it's so delicious!  I like the ease of putting everything in the slow cooker and have the chili ready in 6-8 hours.

I make t. burgers and freeze them - individually wrapped in p. wrap. Lots of onions keep them moist and I add minced garlic instead of g. powder plus Montreal Seasoning.  I punch a small hole in the center before freezing so they will cook evenly without burger bulge.

I'm trying to get my family to eat more pultrey so I decieded to give this recipe a shot even though I've been disappointed with Chipotle burger's in the past.  This was wonderful.  It's not to spicy and it has a wonderful flavor.  It also held together well which has also been a frustration of mine with chicken or turkey burgers.  I did remove the seeds from the chipotle before chopping it up and adding it to the burger and I sautéed the onion.

Excellent! My kids loved them (ages 4-8). They exclaimed, "this is the best meal ever." I made the burgers smaller, put them on King's Hawaiian Rolls with monterey jack cheese and topped with Newman's Own Pineapple Salsa. Delicious! Will definitely make again.

This is definitely the best turkey burger I have ever made. I served with romaine lettuce and tomato on top. This will be a keeper. Thanks

AH-MAZ-ZING. I never leave reviews, but had to for these burgers. I added two extra peppers and extra cilantro. They looked like Christmas burgers before I grilled. They turned out so good. Don't skimp on the mozzarella. I added thick slices of cheese.  Used whole wheat buns and avocado and tomato. Love the spicyness.

Good burger, not dry at all as some (most) turkey burgers tend to be. we like things on the spicy side in our house so we used 2 1/2 chipoltle peppers, 2 large cloves of minced garlic and a bit of cumin. Use fresh mozzarella rather than the packaged/wrapped stuff, it really is SO much better. We've served them on both fresh kaiser rolls and fresh ciabatta rolls and both we're fantastic. I love them topped with some avacado slices yum!

These were great. I ended up freezing them and then cooking them on the George Foreman grill. I used swiss on mine, instead of mazzarella.

Excellent burgers! I processed the whole can of chipotle chili in abodo sauce in my Magic Bullet and used 1 heaping T. in the meat.  You can then put the rest of chili sauce in a ziplock and freeze for next time (per Rachael Ray - just cut out a piece when you need).  I also made a chipotle mayo to go with which really kicked it up a notch (3T low fat mayo and 1 tsp chili sauce).  With the sauce on both sides, the burger had just the right heat.  Also used 2 lbs of turkey and the same amount of spices (plenty of flavor).  Also only used 1 T. of dried Cilantro and 2 T. grated onion with juice instead of chopped.  Cooked on indoor grill.  Very yummy!

This is my go-to turkey burger recipe--it's easy, spicy, flavorful, and moist. Like some other reviewers, I add another chipotle and some fresh garlic but otherwise follow the recipe.  It's a winner.

These were absolutely delicious!  I used two chipotle peppers and they were perfect. I also added two large garlic cloves to the burger mix and substituted Monterey jack for mozzarella. Topped these with a little mayo, fresh avocado and tomato and these were indescribably good!!

Just made this for the first time and it was delicious!  I followed the directions as stated in the recipe. The flavor of the cilantro and chile are what really made this burger like nothing I've ever had.  I highly recommend to anyone who wants to make a flavorful, healthy burger! (I also made these burgers on my Presto electric skillet)

I would suggest some sharp cheddar cheese rather than Mozzarella cheese since Mozzarella has little flavor and is wasted on this burger. I am not a fan of cilantro, but do use it in Mexican dishes. I do happen to love chipotle however. I would make this again but reduce the amount of cilantro. I also did not see a point in using onion and garlic powder, and used fresh since I always have fresh on-hand.

Anytime I can get my beef loving husband to say that eating turkey was actually pretty good, is an accomplishment.  In fact, the entire family ate these up with no complaints!  I was a little worried that the chipotle would make them too spicy, but they were perfect.  And the cilantro just gives these so much flavor.  I only had sandwich "thins" buns left in the house, and these probably would have been better on some thicker buns.  Now we have something to look forward to next time we have these:)

This was my first time with canned chipolte peppers.  I trusted reviewers & went with two eventhough by themselves they were hot (not crazy hot, but an "8").  Two peppers was not too much.  Actually could've used more.  Two was as tame as a little too much black pepper.  I used 2t dried cilantro & fresh garlic & onions, no powder.  I've been on a turkey burger kick lately (coincides with it being on sale) & this one goes in with the rest of "needs toppings to be very good".  Maybe grilling they'd be good as is.  Dunno.  As is, toppings.  :)

I've had this recipe in my folder since June 2008, but never got around to making it.  A diffinite keeper & I wish I'd made these before.  They are very filling.  The first time I made this, I didn't have chipotle chile in adobo sauce, so just used chipotle pepper that was crushed.  It was good that way, but using the chipotle chili in adobo sauce makes it more flavorful.  We do use a lot of cilantro by choice.

Just had for dinner.  Delish!  Used two chipotles and it wasn't too hot - Used the low cal sandwich rounds for a healthy low cal meal!  Thanks for submitting.

Best turkey burgers I have made. Definitely helps using chipotle peppers. I make turkey burgers on a regular basis and will make these from now on! Thank you!

These burgers were pretty good. I'll make them again, but I'll go a little heavier on the seasonings & chipotle, not quite enough flavor for us as is.

Made these tonight and they are soooo flavorful!!  I don't usually enjoy turkey burgers, but these were delicious.  I used Swiss cheese, and made a chipotle mayo for on top, as I don't use buns, very tasty!  I did tweak the recipe a bit - a clove of fresh garlic, NO onion/garlic powder, and 3 tsp of seasoned salt (mine was salt-free) and 1 tsp kosher salt!  Oh, and I added an extra chipotle!

Sooo good.  Best turkey burger I ever had. Didn't think I'd ever like it as a staple, ya know, only a once in a great while type a deal.  I was wrong!  Love these burgers. After your coals are ready on the BBQ, brush grate, then spray with Pam.  Haven't had one stick to the grill and fall apart yet.  I use arugula, mozzarella  cheese which melts awesomely over patty, sliced tomato with kosher salt and fresh cracked pepper. The ground turkey I get is 2lbs so I double up on all ingredients adding an extra chipotle or two. Try them, you will love them too.  Make extra patty for work! They microwave up great next day

Great turkey burgers! Because we like spicy food (and because so many recipes claiming to be spicy aren't always hot enough for us), I added a couple of diced SLICES of jar jalapenos and a couple of shakes of Cajun seasoning. This made it REAL, nose-running spicy! Yum! I also used 1 tsp minced garlic instead of garlic powder. I did not have chipotle chile so I used 1 tbsp chipotle chili powder instead. I didn't have fresh cilantro, so used 1 tbsp dried. Lastly, I topped with sauteed grilled onions and mushrooms, and reduced fat cheddar. Thanks!

Delicious! Used more than one chipotle chile, dried cilantro cause thats what I had on hand, and red diced onion as my onion of choice. Really flavorful! Topped with reduced fat cheddar and sliced avacado. Really yummy burger. And really not too spicy....but had a nice smokey flavor. Thanks!

I had a really hard time keeping the burgers together, as a matter of fact I resorted to making sloppy joes with some bbq sauce I had on hand.  It had to be the 93% ground out of the chub.  Next time I'll go a bit pricier and get the stuff in the tray.

I've never been real big on using turkey in place of beef but this recipe sounded really good so I thought I'd give it another try and I'm glad I did. The whole family loved it! The only thing I changed was using provolone cheese instead.

These are so great. I did use 2 1/2 of the chipotle peppers since we like spice. We always put our turkey patties in the freezer for an hour before grilling, that way they don't fall apart on the grill. Didn't have mozzarella cheese but Colby-jack was just great. We did take the advice of another review and topped with some creamy avocado slices. So flavorful you almost forget it is turkey and not beef.

These are the most delicious turkey burgers I have ever had!  The flavor is amazing!  The only issue that we had was that there was no bonding agent in it and they were hard to flip on the grill.  We got it done and they stayed together better once both sides were cooked.  The flavor was really amazing.  We will definitely be having this again!

The best turkey burger recipe.  I did add 1 teaspoon of cumin, 1 cup of breadcrumbs and 1egg.  I liked the texture it gave and stretched out the meat.

WOW, WOW, WOW...I am weak at the knees after eating this burger...AMAZING flavor & texture.  Added a little extra sauce from the chipotle pepper & subbed 1 tablespoon dried cilantro & 4 tablespoons dried minced onion.  Served with melted pepper jack cheese on toasted onion bun with mixed greens, fresh tomato & a touch of ranch dressing (for flavor, not because it was dry)....one of life's great pleasures that I plan on enjoying for the rest of my days!

WOW! Amazing! I saw made these last night. My boyfriend grilled them for us and i served on toasted buns with red leaf lettuce, tomato, and sliced avocado, i also made a chipotle mayo by combining light mayo with the adobo sauce from the chipotle chilies.  Fantastic burger, we like spicy food so i added 3 chipotle chiles. I made a broccoli slaw and sweet potato fries as sides. Definitely a regular in my dinner rotation.

I was not fond of this recipe; however, my husband said they were good. I'm not a huge fan of cilantro, I can eat it in some things but not others. I did not care for the cilantro here. I also added two chipotle chiles because we like a lot of heat, unfortunately we didn't think the burgers were very spicy. Garlic powder was a little over powering, perhaps fresh garlic would've worked better. Great idea but not something I'll make again.

Being forward thinking I substituted ground beef, 85/15, for the turkey which is way to dry for us. When we want Mexican we want Mexican so I doubled the chipotle, used fresh garlic and onion and 1/4 tsp of ground cumin. Instead of bland mozzarella we used thick hand sliced pepper jack. This recipe is a keeper and can't wait to make them when my Partner's family comes to visit from Mazatlan Mexico.

Definitely more smoky than spicy. We enjoyed these very much and because I don't particularly enjoy grilling burgers, we cooked these on a skillet instead. Still tastes good. definitely something that I'll be making again!

These are AMAZING!  I made them for dinner last night.  Bought ingredients to double recipe but only my single just in case.  They were so good I went ahead and mixed the second batch!  The only thing I did different it my store did not have the chipotle chile in adobo sauce so I used Taco bell chipotle sauce and ground chilli pepper.  GREAT flavor!

This is a very tasty burger, but less spicy than I was expecting. The Chipotle Mayo recipe from this site is a great way to top this, as well as to control your level of spice with a little more precision. I was surprised that this recipe doesn't call for an egg to help hold everything together. Overall, it held together pretty well, but next time I'll throw in an egg.

These are amazing. I didn't have the garlic or onion powder, so I did 2 cloves of garlic instead. I also threw in an egg and did them on a skillet (about 4 minutes each side) because I'm not exactly a grill meister! Will definitely make again. And because of this recipe, I'm having a burger month, where I make a different burger every week on Sunday and consequently have a batch to take for lunch :)

This was delicious, I had them about two hours aog. I only made a few minor changes, I used fresh garlic, 2 chipotle peppers as stated by other reviewers, I added fresh mushrooms and sauteed them and the onion in some olive oil, cooled completely before adding to the mixture, I only used 1 tablespoon of fresh cilantro and I'm glad I did, it has a very strong flacor, if I used 2 tbsp of it, the flavor would have overpowered everything else. I cooked them on the BBQ, never put them in the oven. This is a keeper, very delicious, even with the two peppers its was just spicy enough, not overly hot.

This was excellent!  Followed the recipe except added 2 chipotle peppers instead of 1, and put in a little bit of cumin.  Cooked this in a cast iron skillet (since it's too cold to grill) and served with some avocado, bacon, lettuce, onion, etc.  Juicy, flavorful, with a good spicy kick.  Thanks for an excellent, simple and quick recipe!

My hubby and i LOOOVE this burger!  we cook it in a cast iron skillet and instead of chipoles i use the chipotle salsa (it's essentially the adobo sauce with the chipotles pureed in it and it costs less) that way the heat blends throughout the burger.  we put a fried egg on it and top it with salsa verde on a pretzel bun to soak it all up!  yum yum yum....drool!!!

Turned out excellent! I will add a touch more salt next time (I didn't have seasoning salt, so I used kosher salt and didn't use enough), but my picky husband loved it! Definitely one to make again.

I use ground chicken instead of turkey as it's more moist than turkey. These weren't as spicy as I would have liked although they had good flavor. Next time I would add maybe one more pepper.

Delicious smokey flavor! Yum I will make this again. Next time I'll add 3 chipotle chilies! I did not have any cilantro on hand but hope to add it next time around. I used my Foreman grill and they came out fabulous. Thanks for this great recipe!

Loved these! I downloaded the app for my Windows Phone, and my girlfriend had to work (doesn't like anything remotely spicey). I went with chile powder instead (didn't use enough), might go with the chipotle chili next time and skipped the chopped onions as I'm not a fan of chopped inside my food. Also went with one of the other reviewers recommendation of the shredded mozzerella inside.

They were so yummy! And I was concerned as I'm starting to try to look for healthier alternatives, and had tried turkey pepperoni and it was horrible.

Only change was used Pappy's seasoning instead of seasoned salt since I didn't have any and WOW were these good!  Never buying turkey patties again.  Juicy and full of flavor and just the right amount of kick.  YUM!

My husband and I really enjoyed this. It could've used more chile/adobo and maybe less chopped onion (I prefer fresh onion on the outside of the burger); still it was great! Definitely want to make again!

Wow are these ever good! Instead of cilantro which I didn't have (not crazy about the stuff anyway) I very finely minced an orange bell pepper half and added that in. Also added an egg to help hold things together. After making the patties I set them on a flour dusted wax paper lined cookie sheet and into the freezer they went. They firm up in about 15 minutes and there is no problem with them breaking up on the grill. Provolone is great on these and I made a chipotle mayo to serve on top. We all loved them, lots of oohs and aaahs at the table tonight!

These are delicious! The chipotle adds a great warmth without killing your palette. My only changes were to make 12 slider-sized burgers and to use Swiss cheese instead of mozzarella. Definitely a keeper and one we'll make often.

Delicious! Plain and simple. Followed the recipe and was not dissapointed. This is very similar to another recipe that I have for chipotle burgers but it is so much simpler! All the flavor with half the ingredients and time.

Fabulous!! I also used 2 peppers in the mixture and pureed a few of them with mayo and miracle whip like the comments suggested and it was amazing! I also did the cheese in the middle and added avocado...goodness. Best ever!

My husband made these for us and some company and they were delicious! Just enough spice to taste good without being overpowering. We tried a variation of them using regular ground beef, and in my opinion, they tasted better with the turkey. Not to mention that they are healthier that way!  I can definitely see us making these again. Enjoy!

Absolutely delicious.  I did use 2 chilies because we like more heat.  Also used Pepper Jack cheese instead of Mozzarella as a personal preference, but I can see how the mozzarella would be a nice contrast to the heat of the burger.  Topped them off with a little guacamole and salsa.  Will DEFINITELY make these again!

BOWING IN WORSHIP TO THE AUTHOR:  This is the best burger I have had in years.  I have been watching my diet and lately am obsessed with ground turkey & chipotles - so this is a win-win for me.  Absolutely delicious.  I used a whole medium onion and two chipotles - just perfect.  So easy to mix and cooked up quickly on the Foreman grill.  These are just so superb.  You really can get a lot of flavor out of turkey burgers.  

I'd be curious to know what the nutritional content is minus the cheese & hamburger buns - is it possible to post that?  These are going to be a regular for me and I keep a food diary, so it would be great to know the exact nutrition (no bread and cheese for me!)

Thanks again for an amazing recipe - these are truly life-changing.

Have tried another recipe simular , but used jalapenos and cheddar cheese so was very interested in this one. Delicious. Put in 2 peppers , like other suggested and used shredded mozzarella mixed in with the meat. Spraying hands with cooking spray before forming patties helps a lot when working with ground turkey. We will have this many times

Very tastey, and my husband and son loved it. It added a good amount of flavor and zest to ground turkey. It even barbequed up nicely on the grill. It is a make again recipe! Mozzerlla cheese is not the best choice for this burger. Next time I will try pepper jack or a coby.

Just enough kick - this recipe is now incorporated into our regular dinner cycle.  I froze some and they defrosted perfectly.  A couple times I didn't have fresh cilantro - so left it out, and it was fine (though I like it better with it included.)  I also make a chipotle mayo (just mix the two) for a good topping.

These are so delicious!  10 stars would be a better rating.  I have searched for a good turkey burger for so long.  I haven't had beef in years and never felt satified with any of the turkey burger recipes that I have tried until now.  THANK YOU! I followed others advice & used 2 chipoltle peppers and we didn't think they were too spicy, just right.  Turkey burgers get too dry for me on the grill so I cooked ours in an iron skillet with just a little oil in the pan.  Perfect.  Served with vegetarian baked beans.

Sooo delicious. Best turkey burger I've ever made. Also, I added avocado and subbed havarti cheese for the mozzarella.

I have made them several times and read all the reviews. They are good as written but to make them better I have doubled the chipotle peppers and added bread crumbs (or crushed pretzels) to the outside of the patties for a better texture. As always I let the burgers hang out in the fridge for a little while before grilling as they seem to hold together better. In place of the mozzarella I prefer sliced pepper jack. I like to serve them on toasted wheat sandwich thins for buns.

This is an easy and delicious recipe, something I'm always looking for.  We followed others' advice and added additional chipotles — I like at least three per batch.    The second time we made the burgers we doubled the recipe and froze some burgers, and what a treat having those available whenever we want them!    Thank you so much!  This is a life-changing recipe, especially for the summer grilling months!

These were delicious.  They were just the right amount of spiciness for us.  They were very juicy and flavorful.  Great recipe.

These were very tasty. Not bland at all. I did add an additional pepper though. Cooked these for five minutes on the Foreman grill and dinner was ready. Served with Black Bean and Corn Salad from this site. Delicious, healthy and quick. Will definitely make these again and again.

Absolutely the best turkey burger I have ever eaten.  I had to substitute monterey jack cheese and cooked the burgers in a skillet in a small amount of olive oil.  To make these even better, we made chipotle mayonnaise to top the burger.

These were so good!!! i love spice so i added another pepper and some sauce to the burger mix.  I had no problem with them falling apart, if you turn them too early and too often they will begin to fall apart.  i served with lowfat pepperjack cheese on a whole wheat bun with garlic mayo and some jalpenos, i love hot, it was so spicy mostly cuz of the jalpnaoes, hubby did not add jalapeno and he said it had a nice kick so that means next time add more chiplote peppers.  So yummy, thanks for make healthy eating so flavorful!!

THESE WERE DELICIOUS! IN ADDITION TO THE CHIPOTLE PEPPER, I ADDED ABOUT ABOUT 2 TSP OF THE ADOBO SAUCE TO MAKE SURE I GET THE SPICY TASTE IN THE BURGER.  I ONLY USED A SPRINKLE OF CILANTRO AND USED AMERICAN CHEESE. PLACED IT ON A HONEY WHEAT FLAT BREAD AND TOPPED WITH SPICY AVOCADO SAUCE. DEFINITELY A KEEPER, CAN'T WAIT TO MAKE THEM AGAIN.

This was awesome!  I didn't have any canned chipotle, so I used the Knorr brand chipotle cube & crumbled it in.  Also crumbled another cube & mixed it with the mayo.  Made for a very intense flavor - just loved it!  (You can find the Knorr brand cubes for chipotle and cilanto and onion in the Mexican food section.)

Best turkey burger ever!  I am a big fan of chipotle chili's in adobo sauce.  I have turned on all of my friends to this burger.  Full of flavor.  I used provolone cheese and it was a hit.  Look up other recipes with the chili's in it so you can use up the rest of the chili's and the sauce. Check your international isle (if you have one) at your grocery store.  They are usually sold in a 7 oz can in the Mexican section.

MMMMMM, so good!  We love turkey burgers and tend to eat them way more than beef ones, so I love trying different variations.  I actually ran out of 'real onion' so threw in a 3 onion dried blend that I have and used 2 cloves of fresh garlic instead of the powder. I left out the seasoning salt and since we don't like cilantro, I added some fresh basil. Used 1 1/2 chipotle peppers (removing some of the seeds) and threw in a good sprinkling of panko breadcrumbs to help bind as some of my turkey was still a bit frozen.  We did not find these too spicy at all, would up the chipotle next time or just not take out as many seeds, but there will defintiely be a next time!

This is a great recipe!  My husband and I enjoyed our burgers.  As some of the previous reviews stated, I would add another chipotle pepper for a little more spice, and I eliminated the water and made various other substitutions.  Instead of cooking on an outdoor grill we used the George Foreman.  I did add shredded mozzarella to the center of some of the burgers and that was nice added surprise for my husband.  I will definitely be making this again!

Great! The kids actually ate and my husband, the beef-eater, actually liked them! We put the cheese in between thin patties as another reviewer suggested and they turned out great! We will definitely make them again....I would serve them to company!

4.5 stars - I made this like a previous poster: two thin patties with cheese in the middle. They were very good! Didn't have a fresh onion, cilantro or onion powder, so I just added dried minced onion. I used two peppers and it was a little to spicy for my husband, but he loved them nonetheless. I'll make them again.

With changes, this was an amazing burger recipe. I like really spicy flavoring, so I added 3 chilis in adobo instead of one. I also thought maybe the burger would be a little dry, so I took 2 chilis in adobo, some mild green chilis and some light mayo and mixed them up for a "special sauce" that blended perfectly with the flavor of the burger. Maybe over the top for some, but I also used pepperjack instead of mozzarella. My husband LOVED it.

This is a great recipe!  I've made this a few times now and change it just a little each time.  I add a few more chipoltes and some of the sauce, fresh garlic, green chilies.  I eat turkey burgers all the time and by adding the chipolte it sure makes it moist.  Thanks for posting!

I've never had a turkey burger before, but this one seemed pretty good.  It was pretty moist and flavorful, but the cilantro flavor was a bit too much.  It mellowed out some (or maybe I got one with less cilantro?) as leftovers the next day and wasn't as overpowering, but I still would probably omit it if I make these again.

These were very good, I used Jack cheese because that's what I had. Next time I will add more cilantro since we love it so much. I made a great topping of yellow and red tomatoes, avacodo, red onion kind of like a chunky salsa was a great compilment to the burger.

My boyfriend is trying to eat healthier and asked that I try a turkey burger. I refused for about a week until I came across this recipe. I followed the recipe to a T and they were AWESOME! I thought I would want to add mustard or mayo, but they were seasoned so nicely they didn't need anything! Wonderful!

Did this for casual patio dinner last week and it was an "On-demand" dinner tonight. I followed the recipe exactly the first time as I always do, but experimented a bit this time.  I added 2 tablespoons of pico, left out the garlic, salt and the cilantro (as it was in the pico. Next time I will try it with ground venison. This one made it to my "Family favorites" list.

Really good!  I added an egg and some bread crumbs just to hold the turkey together a bit.  I also like really spicy food so added about 4 peppers and a healthy dollop of the adobo sauce.  Yum.

This is hands down the best turkey burger I have ever made!  Followed recipe exactly as written.  My daughter, who is not a spicy food fan, found it warm, but not intolerable.  She said it was very good.  I love spicy food and did not notice much heat at all.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I doubled the chipotle peppers, but I did remove the seeds.  I browned in a pan and baked them in the oven.  These are very flavourful.  Didn't use the cheese or buns, just had on their own.  I have made twice and it's a keeper!

We made this recipe without making any changes and thought it was great.  It had a  good chipotle flavoring.  For some extra kick, I topped my burgers with some of the adobe sauce from the recipe.

Don't hesitate to make this recipe.  These are the best turkey burgers ever!  So easy, juicy and flavorful. I will never purchase pre-made burgers again. I've followed the recipe exactly and also made substitutions of sirracha for the peppers and cheddar for mozzarella.  Both are excellent. Try  the burgers on ciabatta rolls, you'll love them.

Doubled the chipotle. Everybody, even the picky eater at the table, loved them. The comment was made, "These are different and fun."  They really were a joy to eat.  I felt as though I finally had a turkey burger I would willingly choose over a hamburger without feeling like I was sacrificing flavor and satisfaction.

Had to modify, not by choice, but because I didn't have mozzarella cheese or fresh cilantro or the chipotle peppers.  I followed recipe exactly but used 1/4 tsp Chipotle Chili Pepper,  1 tbsp. dried cilantro and low fat Swiss cheese.   On the bun added BBQ sauce, sliced  avocado  and couple of thin sliced spicy pickles. Absolutely delish!

These burgers were delicious. My beef-loving boyfriend was more than sceptical about eating a turkey burger; he loved them! I will definitely make these again.

Super easy, good burgers to get away from the norm. I followed recipe except I doubled the adobo cause I wanted more heat. Oh,and I skipped the cheese just because I dont usually  miss it. I served with avocado, lettuce and tomato and a touch of mayo. They were good, not dry at all!

I've made this recipe over and over and our family really loves it.  When we are looking for more kick I'll add a couple more chipotles & pepper jack cheese instead of the mozzarella.  Also, the seasoning salt we use is "Sazon-Chicken" for all of our poultry, definitely recommend!!!! This recipe is a keeper!

Love, Love, Love!  Based on other reviews, I upped the chipotle to 3 of them.  Make sure you get the canned chipotle in Adobe sauce to get the heat.  Also, we love cilantro so we thought the flavors went together vary well.  I had some left over chipotle mayonnaise sauce from fish tacos the night before.  At the end, I put some of that over the burger before adding the cheese.  It was amazing.  My turkey burger was almost too moist so I ended up adding a little bread crumbs to bring it together.  I served with a greek cucumber salad and my fiancee raved about them.

The only thing missing from this recipe was bacon! But that defeats the healthy part. I made it for the first time for lunch and it was amazing! sooo juicy, tasty, and smelt so good. very easy to make as well. I used my Hamilton Beach indoor grill, it came out perfect.

Thanks for the great recipe!

These burgers were pretty fantastic :)  I made a couple of adjustments:  first, I doubled the recipe and used two garlic cloves instead of garlic powder, and I threw in half of a large yellow onion.  I'm not a big fan of onion chunks in my food, so I pureed the cilantro, garlic, chipotle and onion in a blender with a tablespoon of water, then mixed it with the ground turkey and seasonings by hand.  This left me with a pretty wet consistency, but still firm enough to form into patties on some parchment paper.

I cooked the patties in some olive oil on medium-low heat on the stovetop (too hot outside to grill).  You've got to cook them at medium-low because you really want them to cook through--after all, it's poultry, not beef.

Since we're on a low-carb diet here at the house, I served them in some leaves of iceberg lettuce, with about a teaspoon of Vietnamese red chili-garlic sauce they have in the ethnic food section, topped with a little swiss cheese.  I also had some sauteed bell pepper on the side, but they really didn't add much imo.

Lots of flavor, will undoubtedly try again.

These burgers were so delicious! The only changes I made were adding 2 chipotle peppers instead of 1, and using monterey jack cheese instead of mozzerella. My whole family agrees that these are the best turkey burgers we have ever had. I will definitely use this recipe again. Thanks!

This is my "go to" recipe when I feel like a great burger.  I use my pannini pan on the stovetop and it comes out perfect just the way it is.
Thanks so much!!
BTW - I've been making this for at least a year and just got around to comments..

i LOVE this!! I am trying to eat healthier and have some food allergies, so I skip the cheese and bread.  I make these burgers, then top with homemade guacamole and wrap with lettuce.  SO delicious, healthy, and flavorful.  I've made them for several friends and family, who love them, too.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

We loved this recipe!  In an attempt to lessen the sodium (due to diet restrictions) I did leave out the seasoning salt.  The chile in adobo sauce was plenty salty and we didn't miss the seasoning.  We used fresh garlic, not dried.  These were absolutely delicious!  I have had requests from the kids to make more and freeze for their school lunches. So good!

We had these tonight and they were tasty but a bit garlicy.  I used a leaner ground turkey and am glad I made them about 1 hr before grilling as it gave the burgers time to set up. We like things a bit spicier, so I used 2 medium peppers and the flavor was just right.  In order to ensure a decent dice, I used the food processor to cut the onions and peppers.  This way the flavor went all through the burger.  We'll have again but without all of the garlic.

My family really liked these burgers. I did use 2 1/2 chipotle peppers because I wanted more heat and I didn't think that 1 would have been enough for the spice level that I like. I substituted ground chicken for the turkey because that's what I had on hand. I used fresh garlic instead of powdered and made a chipotle mayo to go with the burgers.. I completely forgot the cheese, but I plan on making these again and will try the turkey as called for in the recipe, but would probably use Monterey Jack or Blue Cheese instead of Mozzarella.

These burgers were fabulous!  My husband really liked them and he is all about BEEF.  We love spicy food and this really brings the heat!  We added mayo to the bun and it was really great.  Thanks for this recipe, I will be using it in regular rotation.  :-)

This is my first time leaving a review of a recipe on this website and I felt this was an appropriate first as these burgers were AWESOME! I mixed up all the ingredients the night before and let it sit in the fridge until they were ready to be made the next day. I followed another reviewers suggestion and put shredded mozzarella in middle of two thin patties, pinched the patties together and cooked them on the BBQ. I also double the chipotle chile as I like things a bit more spicy. I made these for a friend's going away dinner and she said they were the best burgers she has ever had. I will definitely be making these again! Thanks for the recipe!

Thanks for this awesome recipe- hands down, my new favorite burger.  It's a forgiving recipe that can handle adaptations.  Holds up well to substitutions of ground chicken or pork, but my very favorite way to have it is exactly as it's written.  This recipe is a winner, and I make it alot!

Excellent burgers. We added a fresh jalapeno, used fresh garlic, and left out the cilantro (only because we didn't have any.

I found the burger to be a bit bland however i have never had a turkey burger before so I have nothing to compare this too.  It was ok.  Next time i try it i may add a few more chipolte peppers maybe that will help with the taste.  I was also thinking maybe a tastier cheese like a monterey jack to go with the spicy of the chipolte.

This was the best I have ever tasted. So moist, unbelieveable flavor. The only thing I changed was i only used half a chipotle and a about two teaspoons of the sauce from the can. It was very spicy even with decreasing the pepper, I wouls probably do even a little less the next time.

These were exceptionally good!  I also used two chillies.  One time, it was moderately hot, and the second time, it was too hot!  I guess it depends on the brand of chipotle.  Yummy.

We tried these for our first turkey burgers and really liked them.  I also added 2 chiles.  Too much for my husband but great for me.  I think next time I would add a bit more garlic powder.

I also used  two chili peppers, along with 1 tsp of the sauce.   Very spicy..perfect.  If watching your calories, skip the cheese because the burgers pack so much flavor, you will not miss the cheese.  I also skipped the cilantro second time I made the burgers because the chilies in adobe sauce overpowered the cilantro.  Excellent burgers!

Fabulous, doubled the recipe for everything except the chipotle chili - used 93% ground turkey and brushed some canola oil them before grilling and they were so moist. My family loved them. We all love beef burgers but my boys said these are the new favorite.

I did not care for this recipe. I cannot BELIEVE how much cilantro this recipe calls for. I put in 1.5 tbsp and it was so overpowering, I couldn't taste anything else. I put in 3 chipotle chilis and even then it wasn't that spicy, so I can only imagine how bland they would be with only 1 chili. We won't be making them again.

These were pretty good!  We overcooked ours just a bit (it was our first time grilling with turkey), so watch your times, but overall these were very yummy.  Like many things with us, it still needed a little extra "smack", so we topped with just a little bit of Frank's hot sauce for an extra punch.

This was so good, one of the best turkey burger recipes I've come across.  I doubled the chipotle pepper like some others and mixed some of the adobo sauce with mayo to go with it, but I'm sure it would have been 5 stars as is.  I would recommend using all white meat ground turkey, and this tastes much better when making turkey burgers.

We weren't smitten by this recipe.  Fairly bland, even with the addition of an extra chipotle pepper as suggested by some reviewers.  We also used pepper jack cheese as it was what we had on hand and it didn't help spice it up.  Might be better with fresh japaleno peppers instead of the chipotles.

I tried this recipe with ground beef and while I couldn't find the chipotle in adobe sauce, I substituted with real chipotle chiles and adobe power and used everything else as the recipe called for.  My family raved about these burgers! I also topped with avocado in addition the regular toppings.  I will definitely be making these again!

This was my first time cooking ground turkey and using Chipotle peppers in Adobo.  I was very nervous but these were absolutely delicious!  The meat was very flavorful and juicy.  Oh, I did not use the Cilantro as I didn't want to buy a big bunch that I wouldn't use.  I never missed it.  I also made the Chipotle mayo and we slathered the buns with that.  I thought it had real kick but not too hot.  I am sensitive to spicy too.  My 9 year old even liked her burger minus the mayo sauce.  Hubby and teen son loved them!  Definitely a keeper!

I made this burger according to the recipe and served it with mayo, mozzarella, tomato and lettuce, it was good but was missing an I don't know what... maybe a bit of BBQ sauce. I don't know what sauce people put in this burger... any suggestions???
My second attempt with the leftovers: I added BBQ sauce on the bun and used Swiss cheese instead of Mozza, made all the difference!

These burgers turned out awesome!  I was worried that being a turkey burger it would turn out dry, but I was very wrong.  I added 2 chipotle chiles to the mix (like other reviewers had suggested) and it was not spicy but just had a great chipotle undertone.  I used real garlic and added regular salt. I left out the oregano.   I also used parmesan cheese and folded it into the mixture since that's all I had on hand. Yum so good and my boyfriend thought they were fantastic too.  Writing this recipe down for my recipe box as we speak.

Just tried this recipe last night!  I added two chipotle chile peppers to the mix, and topped the burgers with pepperjack cheese, spinach, and avocado.  They were great!  I will definitely be making these again.

As my 17 yr old son said, this recipe is a KEEPER.

I made the recipe pretty much as written, except I used a tsp of minced onion because I didn't have onion powder. I also used a bit more onion (I thought it said 1/2 an onion, and I was using a big onion).

In any case, the recipe was easy to make and very yummy.  

Big hit at my house.  ;-)

This was better than ever imagined!  I put a jalapeno in it instead of the chipotle chile (didn't have it) and added Bankok seasoning (spicy).  Wonderfully juicy and full of flavor!  I would recommend to anyone!  Thank you for this!

Perfect! I have always preferred to make my own turkey burgers, nothing special just seasonings. The addition of cilantro (which I love in anything) was superb. My friend who had never had a turkey burger before loved them as well. I love pico de gallo on my burgers and these were no exception. I am going to buy more turkey tomorrow and make more.

I made these and loved them! I strongly suggest sticking exactly to the directions (which I usually don't) because it has just the right amount of kick/flavor. Delicous! Also we put sharp cheddar cheese on instead of mozzerella and also put in some homemade guacamole which just sent it to heaven!

This recipe is delicious. When we made it we put in a little extra chipotle chile as some others suggested to give it even more pop. I still wouldn't say it was super hot, so if you don't like hot foods try it as written and you should be fine if you have a glass of milk handy.

Nice change from the typical beef burger with just the right amount of heat. Although it is excellent with the mozzarella  I am going to try other cheeses, like cheddar or Monterey Jack (maybe pepper jack). I think any of those choices would be just as good. Maybe mix some in with the meat mixture :)  EDIT 7/2012: Added good amount of shredded cheddar cheese to meat mixture and used pepper jack to melt on top. Company LOVED them! Served on lightly buttered and grill toasted pretzel buns. YUM!

Absolutely amazing!  Very flavorful.  The first time I ever made turkey burgers they were dry and bland.  And so I was a little worried when I started making these.  But, I was glad to be proved wrong.  They are super juicy and delicious!

Yummy!  I followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing.  My family tends to be hard to impress, but they loved these burgers.  I made fresh pico de gallo and sliced avocado for toppings.  This recipe is a keeper!

Wow!
This is the 2nd time I have made the Turkey Burgers. First time I followed the instructions, this time around I changed it up a bit. Since I was out of Garlic Powder I used Ms. Dash Garlic and Herb seasoning (same amt) and since I was out of mozzarella I used Pepperjack cheese. I also add applewood bacon. All I can say is wow! Like someone else stated I made a bunch and froze them for later.

These were delicious!  Made them exactly as the recipe states the night before (except for cilantro- added that right before cooking), then grilled the next day and they turned out great. My husband raved about them- we will definitely make again.

This was my favorite turkey burger recipe, the flavor is perfect and has just enough heat. My only caution, make sure you are chopping the onions finely like it says. With this recipe small onion chunks make for a better overall burger. If you want more onion, add then to the top.

I found the smallest chipotle to put in for my husband who does not like spicy. I love spicy, so I pureed 2 chipotles with a couple tablespoons each of miracle whip and and mayo. I used it as spread on mine and it was FABULOUS. Thank you!

These burgers were awesome!  The chipolte chilis (this was my first time using these) has some heat and the rest of the spices made these burgers very flavorful!  I used minced garlic instead of garlic powder but that was the only change I made.  But we LOVE garlic!  I also made sure I chopped everything up super tiny in my mini food processor so there were  no big chunks of anything.  These smelled SO good!  These were very moist and flavorful!   Me and my neighbors enjoyed them immensely!  Thank you for posting this recipe mbaucum!  Loved it!  This one's definitely a keeper.

This is a great recipe.  Pan fried them (the grill is under 3 feet of snow.)  Topped them with cooked mushrooms and chipotle mayonnaise.

Great burgers!  I was a little skeptical at first, because turkey can be so bland.  These were not bland at all.  I took another reviewers advice and added the second pepper because we love spicy food.  The burgers were perfect, very tasty.  I will make these again.

Better with ground beef.  You have to cook turkey too long for safety.  We prefer juicier so beef works.  Also, as others said, use sharp cheese and very very finely chop the 2 chilis.  We do this without buns, and do the avocado and salsa topping. Round it out with the sweet potato fries.

I am not exaggerating.  This is the best burger I have ever had, hands down.  I'm not crazy about meat in any form but I could eat these burgers every day.  My husband kept saying "um um um: all through his meal and he's the pickiest eater I know.

Great alternative to traditional burgers.  I followed the recipie but made it for 2 burgers not 4.  And I took others suggestions and made them stuffed cheese burgers.  Turned out great.  Next time I will add 2 chipotle peppers for every 2 burgers, the taste just didn't come through.  Will make these again.

These were absolutely awesome! I didn't have the peppers in Adobo so I substituted them with Jalapenos. I also used Parmesan cheese instead of Mozerella because I didn't have any, and I am on a low cal/low fat diet. It still tasted amazing! I will definitely make this again.

These turkey burgers are great! I added an extra chipotle chile for more heat, and it was great, not overpowering. The cilantro mixes well with the onion and pepper flavors. I topped mine with pepper jack cheese and salsa, yum!

Outstanding flavorful burgers. I had never had a turkey burger before so I was a skeptic. Not a skeptic anymore. I didn't have chipoltles on hand, so I used half a dried california chili. Absolutely delicious

Made this for possibly the second time - but left out the onion and cilantro because we didn't have any. Also used lorraine swiss. This was excellent!  The burgers were still very moist and the chipotle adds a lot of flavor!

This is an excellent recipe. The only thing I do differently is put the mozzarella cheese inside the burger before grilling or pan-frying. It makes the burger juicy and moist, which is sometimes hard to get with a turkey burger. I also use shredded mozzarella vs. slices. But either will work.

my daughter and I decided to make these for us and beef burgers for her fiance and her dad who said they didn't like turkey burgers. these turned out really really good. The only thing I did was add the extra pepper per the other reviews and a couple spoons of the chipotle sauce that made them pretty spicy but we like that, we also topped with pepper jack cheese. They had alot of flavor and were really moist and juicy. I did make the patties and put them in the freezer for about 10 min. to get really cold and firm so they didn't fall apart when I put them on the grill and I didn't mess with them until they were ready to turn over and they were fine didn't break apart at all. I gave a piece of the burger to my husband who thought it was a beef burger and liked it, they didn't even taste like a turkey burger. They really are good!!

Overall, we thought the burgers were pretty good.  They definitely were spicy.  I liked the onion flavor, but neither DH nor I enjoyed getting a bite of crunchy onion; I think next time I would have to saute the onion prior to adding it to the burger mixture.  Also, I think this burger would benefit from the addition of a more flavorful cheese (perhaps pepperjack?).  I would make this again with those few minor tweaks.

I'm on this diet and we have to eat a turkey burger everyday for lunch.  Found this recipe and loved it!  I used a whole can of chipotle chilis because I thought that's what it said!  Very spicy, but great!  My only suggestion is add about 1/2-1 cup of plain bread crumbs.  My first burger (cooked on my George Foreman) stuck to the burners.  I added about a cup of bread crumbs and it was perfect.  I will add more cilantro next time as someone suggested!  Thank you for a great recipe!

This is my go to easy dinner when I have last minute guests, even the ones that aren't so sure about turkey burgers. I never use any seasoned salt, but I do add a dash of sea salt. I use 1/2 tsp of cayenne for an extra kick (if it's just me and my boyfriends its a full tsp).  I use a food processor and mince the onion. Believe it or not, most  people who have tried one of these have liked a kraft single over the fresh mozzarella I tried as well.  The chipotle pepper makes this burger (look in the Goya section)!!!

I upped it to three chipotle peppers and we definitely tasted them throughout.  This was a really good tasting dish....doesn't "feel" like a burger at all.  I used pepper jack cheese but next time will go with a cheddar as the pepper jack couldn't stand on it's own next to teh chipotle.  We also added sliced avocado on top. Will make again.

I LOVED these burgers although the hubby thought they were average. Next time, I will add more chipotle peppers & adobo sauce since I didn't think they were very spicy, but oh so good! Maybe add red pepper flakes, too. Unsure what to expect (thought it would be more "mexican" but it wasn't, but not disappointed); The chipotle in adobo added sweet and smoky flavor. I used 85/15 lean turkey and used just a quarter piece of pepperjack cheese in the middle (as suggested) which kept them very juicy. Served with just tomato, lettuce, and mustard b/c unsure how to dress at first. yum.

Wow!  Even with all the good reviews, I was surprised just how tasty these are.  Only change I made was using two peppers instead of one.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

It was really good. I used about 5 tablespoons cilantro and would use even more next time. They didn't have the chipotle chili's at my local grocery stores so I used jalapenos and Adobo Criollo sauce. It probably would have been better using the right stuff but it was still good. I served it w/ mayo but it was way better when we added ketchup and a tomato to it as well. I think it would be awesome with a spicy guacamole, I will definitely do that next time. I also put the mozzarella in between 2 small patties turning them into one large one and it was very good like that. I will use more than 1 teaspoon of cheese inside next time though. Oh yeah, I also added 1 teaspoon of cumin which was a wonderful touch. all in all, it is a very good recipe!

Awesome!  Couldn't find the chipotle peppers, so used a couple tablespoons of diced green peppers, but they turned out super yummy!

Really, really tasty. I was worried about these being dry, but the adobo sauce must help to keep the moisture. You can use more or less of the sauce that the chiles are packed in to make it more hot. Make sure to really really dice that chipotle. I think I had a couple chunks or maybe some very sensitive eaters because I got a couple: ooooo, that's hot. I really, really like these, though. Making a habit of doubling the recipe and throwing them in the freezer separated by wax paper. Tip: Try to make them as flat as possible because the burgers have a natural tendency to kind of puck-up in the middle.

The spice combo makes for a great turkey burger...I used chipotle powder instead of the whole pepper and served with honey BBQ sauce.  Grilled the burger (and bun) on my indoor grill pan for a great lunch with baked seasoned fries on the side.

Simply amazing! I added an extra chipotle as per the recommendations from others. Not too spicy, not too bland. We didn't use the cheese as we have dairy allergies. My husband asks for these every time I buy ground turkey.

Didn't put the spice in these, but they were delicious regardless! I never realized ground turkey tasted so much like ground beef. Without the spice and with ketchup in it it tastes just like meat loaf, which I love.

Sooooooo good!  I added in some fresh minced garlic, 2 adobo chili peppers, some white pepper and they were fantastic!  Topped with a spicy cheddar/jack cheese and a homemade chipotle mayo, lettuce and tomato!

These were very tasty! I used one pepper, but added about 1.5 T of the adobo sauce, so the burgers were seasoned but not what I would call spicy, and I'm kind of a spice wimp. Next time I will use 2 peppers. The burgers were very moist.  Other changes made: parsley rather than cilantro, no onion powder or season salt, but added extra fresh onion and garlic powder. I cooked them in the skillet.

Very good for a turkey burger.  This had a nice spicy taste. I put all the ingredients except the cheese and buns together and mixed thoroughly about 5 hrs before making into patties and grilling. I think it helped add to the flavor. Used shredded sharp cheese on top since I didn't have any mozzarella handy.

DELISH!  Only thing I changed was that i didnt add onion powder.  Thought plenty of chopped onion was enough.  Added 2 chipolte peppers in adobo sauce.  They were fabulous and  very moist.  Everyone loved them.  Plan on bringing a double batch recipe to a fourth of July BBQ this weekend.  Popped patties in the freezer for about 15 minutes before grilling to firm them up a bit and it worked great.  Thanks for a very tasty alternative to ground beef!!

I added extra chipotles and the burgers had great flavor!  Mine were a little dry but it's probably because I used the leanest turkey available.  Next time I will either use turkey with a little higher fat content or add some low fat plain yogurt to the mix to keep them moist.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very flavorful!  Took other reviewers' suggestions and used two chipotle peppers and added some of the sauce to the burgers also.  My husband and I like things spicy!  We also added some adobo sauce to the buns, but that was a little too much heat.  Next time I will use three peppers in the burgers though to see how that is.  Very good, thanks!

Great recipe. I used two chipotles and the spice was just right. Not too hot at all. I also omitted the cilantro simply because my husband doesn't eat cilantro. I would definitely make this again.

I never knew turkey burgers could be so good!  I made this with 2 1/2 lbs ground turkey, so I doubled all the ingredients.  The only things I added were the juice from 1 lime and some pomegranite balsamic vinegar.  I used Tony Chachere's for the seasoned salt.  My fiancee and I loved them!

We were not impressed with this though it has potential. Very dry and not as spicy as you would think with the Chipotle pepper.

I LOVED these burgers!!  I used a little less onion than the recipe called for (personal preference) and only had dried cilantro on hand, but other than that I followed the recipe as written.  These burgers were so juicy and delicious!!  I did remove the seeds from the chipotle pepper to keep the spice down because our kids can't do spicy foods, but everyone enjoyed the flavor and bit of heat.  I will definitely be making these again!

Overall a pretty good alternative to traditional burgers.  There was a bit too much onion for my taste, but I can’t hold that against anyone.  I added some spinach into the burger mix for more nutrition because I’ve seen it used in other turkey burger recipes and it worked out well!

These were just meh. I wouldn't call these spicy (and I even come from the north where people shy away from the least bit of true spice), and there was too much cilantro (although I know that's a genetic preference for many people). If I try these again, I would either increase the chipotles, or add some chili powder or cayenne pepper, or sriracha to truly make these spicy and have depth. I appreciate that they're a healthier option though.

Very tasty!  Have been looking for something with less fat for dinner that my whole family will enjoy.  My teenage son was inspecting each of our plates for leftovers!  Will make again.

Delicious, juicy, low fat. Just gotta figure out a way to keep the ground meat from sticking to my hands when I'm making the patties.

Dont really eat turkey much, so i was a bit hesitant on how it might come out. We were able to get 6 patties out of the ground turkey, used provolone cheese instead of mozzarella, didnt have seasoning salt so i used salt, 1/4tsp chilli flakes and paprika - also added 2 chillies to the mix. Came out perfect! Will deff try again.

This is by far the best turkey burger recipe I have tried!  I made a few modifications based on my experience with ground turkey, most notably I added about 1/4 cup bread crumbs and an egg.  I also put 2 peppers in as we like spicy, and the heat was perfect.  Will definitely make these again!

Let me just say that this is my very first time at making Turkey Burgers......and OMG!! I was missing out! I tweaked things but the only thing that was part of the original recipe that I did differently was to leave out the cilantro (personal taste). I doubled it but added 3 peppers instead of 2, added an egg to the mixture, some parm cheese (maybe 1/2 cup) and some soy sauce, and also through in some panko. Every one loved them (and trust me this is a very hard crew to please, all have very different tastes). I cannot wait to make them again

Add a few shakes (to taste) of Penzey's Spices Arizona Dreaming seasoning blend to make a spectacular burger.

HOLY COW!!!...or should I say holy turkey?Thank you for sharing this incredible recipe. I am a chef and I made this for my fiancé. He said this was one of the best meals I’ve made and definitely the best burger I’ve made. I adjusted it a bit according to our tastes as we all have opinionated and particular taste buds. Sautéed the chopped onions until translucent and added 1/2 tablespoon of minced garlic. Also added 3 tablespoons of mayo (I do this with all my burger meat to maintain moisture), 4 minced strips of bacon, added an extra chipotle, doubled the garlic powder (can you tell that we love garlic?), filled the middle of the burgers with marinated mozzarella, and topped them with pepper-jack cheese and Yum-Yum sauce. Obviously if you’re doing turkey burgers to be healthy these modifications aren’t for you lol. I want to give a major shoutout to the creator of this recipe. You are much appreciated ??

Another reviewer suggested lightly coating the patty before cooking. Great suggestion because it gave the meat a nice crunch.

Let's just say these were excellent!  Added the two peppers as suggested and made the chipotle mayo that was also suggested in a review.  I added cilantro to my mayo.  Also, did Pepper Jack Cheese and cooked in an iron skillet.  SO GOOD!!

Great flavor!  I have a pork and beef allergy (caused by a tick bite) and can no longer eat regular burgers.  This burger is a great replacement for the beef burgers I have missed.  It is flavorful, moist and has a texture similar to regular burgers.  The only change I made was to use one can of chipotles to 3 pounds of ground turkey.  I also used the left over adobe sauce and mixed with some mayo to make chipotle mayo and served with the burgers.  I have probably made these ten times and still really enjoy the texture and flavor--almost don't miss beef burgers anymore.  Thanks for posting this recipe!

Made as is. These were so good. Made the mistake of using the George Forman grill and it dried them out a bit too much. Next time I will use the regular grill and they'll be even better. Topped with avocado, red onion, tomatoes, and Dijon. I also used Provolone instead of mozzarella but I think the mozzarella like the recipe stated would give it more flavor.

Awesome burger!  Lighter and tastier than beef. I like the flavor of onion but not the texture so I grated mine and it was perfect. I also puréed the chipotle pepper and adobo sauce and used 2 heaping tablespoons in the recipe and froze the rest. I pan fried instead of grilling because the mixture was a little loose. Came out great. Burger was very juicy and flavorful.

These a favorite in my family!!!  They have so much flavor and are juicy.  We like them "spicy", so we added extra peppers in adobo sauce and some of the adobo sauce to the turkey mixture.

I used a 1/4t of chipotle chili pepper spice instead of a chipotle pepper, and added 1/4t of smoked paprika in addition to all other spices.  Flavor was good. I cooked them in a pan with olive oil under low-med heat and the texture was like rubber. I couldn't get past the texture, only took a few bites. If  I make them again I will form them into pancake thin burgers to see if that helps or use ground beef.

After reading many reviews and like spicy food, I added an extra chipolte pepper...also used fresh garlic rather than powder.   It had the perfect level of spice and with some avacado and tomatoe, it was delicious!

My husband loved this burger and I didn't think it was bad at all. Just make sure the patties are flat - I didn't make them flat enough and, although the inside was juicy, the outside was burnt and it took way longer to cook than the instructions stated.

We quadrupled the recipe and used 6 peppers.  They were So delicious!  I ate the last one two days later and I think it was even better, so I think next time I'll mix it all together a couple hours before cooking.  We also mixed a little of the sauce from the chipotles with some mayo for a little extra kick.  Can't wait to make these again!

I think this is the third time I've ever reviewed anything, ever. So great. Tangy more than spicy, agree with other reviews there, but it's super easy to modify because you're most likely going to have extra chipotles in adobo in your can anyway, so throw in more if you want more spice. The seasoning is perfect, the flavor is fantastic (I'm eating it bunless with no cheese and no dressing or anything at all, just knife and fork like a steak, and it's fantastic). Can't recommend this recipe highly enough.

I followed the recipe completely and it seemed like the mix was too moist. I had to put about a cup of bread crumbs in it in order for it to not be falling apart on the grill. I felt like the flavor was a little bland and I like spicy so I'll probably make some adjustments next time! Still good though.

I have made this several times and most everyone loves it.  It is the only turkey burger I've ever liked and it is a 10 out of 10.  The only complaint I get is it's too spicy so you may want to pass if you don't like spicy food at all (I think it's mild).  The only modification I made to the recipe was using oregano instead of marjoram because we don't happen to have it in our rack.  Thank you for providing a healthier way to eat burgers!

OMG was this good! Far exceeded my expectations. I didn't have the chile but found a substitute that worked perfectly. [Sub: 1 chipotle with adobo = 1 T. tomato sauce, 1 T. cider vinegar, 1 t. powdered chipotle chile pepper, 1/2 t. cumin and a pinch of oregano, salt and pepper]  We found the burgers to be a tad spicy so will likely skip the black pepper in both the substitute and main recipe in the future, and possibly cut back on the powdered chipotle also.  Excellent recipe!

I've made this recipe several times and it always turns out amazing. The only altercation I do is using one and a half peppers and also deseeding them. A small pointer,  do not over mix the meat also keep your hands wet while mixing and forming the patties. Also add a tad of water to the plate you are forming the patties on to. Another thing make sure the patties are cold when putting them on a well oiled grill to keep them from sticking or falling apart.

There is some good flavor here. I took a star away because the texture was just a bit mushy for a burger and what I know a good turkey burger can have. I didnt double the chipotle as others mentioned and opted to omit cheese but topped with bacon tomato lettuce and avocado ranch dressing. Pretty good but have to improve texture.

For a turkey burger this was delicious! Used sea salt in place of seasoned salt and doubled the cilantro. I had a can of Chipotle peppers kicking around and decided to finally try this recipe and I'm glad I did. I love how this recipe doesn't use bread crumbs as I find especially with it being turkey it makes it sort of dry. 
Will make it again with the rest of the Chipotle peppers which I decided to freeze.

The BF said they're the best turkey burgers he's ever had. They were so flavorful and had a nice kick! I made mine with 3 chipotle peppers, added fresh garlic, used creole seasoning instead of seasoned salt, and topped them with pepper jack cheese, baby spinach, and tomato and avocado. Mm!

We love spice and one chipotle is plenty for us. I like to add a little ranch to my bun and I stuff the mozzarella inside. Just absolutely delicious.

I added 5 baby Bella mushrooms finely chopped to keep the burgers moist and add some flavor.  We like spicy food, so I used  2 chipotles as recommended by others. These were the absolute best turkey burgers I've ever had! My wife loved them too. This recipe is a keeper. Will be making it again.

I followed the other recommendations to up the cilantro, and add 2 chipotle peppers, and add 1 tbsp Greek yogurt and 1/4 tsp paprika.   It was very tasty.  The mozzarella detracted from the flavor of the patty, so I won't use cheese again.  I also used another's suggestion to take 2 tbsp sour cream, 1 tbsp mayo and 1.5 tsp of the chipotle sauce to use as a spicy mayo.  
I would make again.

This was a really good meal that was easy and pretty forgiving. I say forgiving because after I mixed all the ingredients together my wife called and had invited more friends over for dinner. I added more turkey and eyeballed the seasonings. I cooked them on my Yoder YS460 smoker at 350 for about 15 minutes to an internal temp of 180. Everyone left the table full and kept on giving me compliments throughout the rest of the night.

Nice Burgers! So moist! We used 90something % lean turkey. Had to sub in other chiles but next time will use the chipotle. I did add around 1/2c pumpkin purée just to add extra moistness. Definitely will make sgain with the other chiles.

Awesome recipes. I did as others and double the chipotle peppers. I think I'll even do one more next time as we LOVE spicy. I also added a tad more season salt and cooked burgers out of grill. Turned out phenomenal!

Tripled the recipe and made smaller patties... This is truly the most delectable recipe. I toasted the buns and only topped with avocado and a slice of tomato...So good! I just reheated them for lunch today and they are still juicy and delicious! Thanks so much for this recipe.

This was my first time using ground turkey and let me tell you, I was nervous!  After reading all the reviews, I added extra chipotle peppers and my lips were tingling (in a good way)!  Didn't need anything but lettuce on my roll either.  They're even good without a roll.  My son and I loved them!

I'm on this healthy life style kick and it's been week four of cooking "healthier" I have tried so many different recipes and they've been Good just not good enough to comment. But this recipe is amazing! I followed it exactly as written! I was confused as to how much chipotle to put but the video helped. I made four patties but thinking next time might make two bigger patties. It was soooo good! With the right amount of spice! Awesome recipe! Hubby wants it for dinner tomorrow night too!

Wow! I made this recipe for my friends, and they lived it. I normally hate turkey burgers, because I like real beer burgers. I like this recipe, because it was spicy and juicy from the onions. I would definitely make it again.

So glad I found this recipe. I find it hard to find a great recipe for ground turkey as I find it needs a lot more seasoning/flavour help than ground beef. 

I took the advice of others and upped the chipotle peppers even though I don't like spicy foods and it wasn't spicy. I use the 4 pack of ground turkey from Costco and used a full small can of the peppers (there were 7 in there) but left the sauce out. I also added more cilantro. Tossed all the seasoning ingredients into a food processor to chop and combine, then mixed that into the turkey.

I made burger patties that I froze and haven't yet tasted, then cooked the remaining meat (with no cheese) in a frying pan and put it over some salad. Tasty!

This is such a flavorful, moist burger recipe.  I just love it.  I must admit that I am not a huge fan of cilantro, so I often leave it out.  But it is great either way.  And it works just as well with ground chicken, too. In fact, this recipe has basically converted me from a beef burger lover, to someone that may never make another beef burger again.

Really great!  Not too spicy, just right.  The cheese and herbs give it a perfect texture, not dry and crumbly like ground turkey can be sometimes .

These were delicious.  So flavorful and not dry at all.  Very spicy.  I think next time I will top with a cilantro/lime yogurt sauce to cut down on the heat.

This Turkery Burger is amazing - I have tried other recipes leaving the turkey dry and undesirable.  I added 2 chilis - made 8 thin patties and added the mozzarella cheese in the middle (another reviewers suggestion) and I actually added some of the adobe sauce onto of the burger... this is to die for!!! My husband raved and he never raves about Turkey burgers.

If you don't try this burger your missing out..

This recipe is the best turkey burger I've ever had! I topped mine with guac and blue cheese instead of mozzarella and I used 2-3 chipotle peppers since I like spicy food, and wow. Perfection.

This recipe was the feature of the day so I just spontaneously decided to give it a try. I wish I'd read the reviews beforehand. It's okay but needs a ton more moisture and flavor. I regret not using the whole can of chipotle peppers, because it really would have helped add moisture and flavor, plus I wouldn't have had 3/4 of a can left over. We did use extra sharp white cheddar rather than mozzarella, which I do think was a better choice just because it had more flavor. If I make these again I'll give a lot of thought on how to doctor them up more.

Great recipe. I didn't follow it to the "t," because I have my own grilling style. Over hickory chips works amazing wonders on this burger, a well as grilling ciabatta buns brushed with butter. Avacado cream with onions, tomato, cumin, chili powder, and a taste of chipotle chili powder or adobo sauce. Just try it.

I followed this recipe exactly except for 4 basic things: I used 1.5 lbs of 70% lean ground beef instead of 1 lb of turkey, 2 chipotle peppers instead of 1, 1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon instead of cilantro, and cooked the patties in a frying pan (without any cooking oil) instead of cooking them the girl. I topped them with cheese (asadero & cheddar) immediately after they were cooked and covered them in the pan so the cheese would melt. After the cheese melted, I put them on top of a paper-towelled plate to rest before placing them on toasted buns (VERY important to collect excess grease so they don't ruin the buns). Mmmm, good! They were a hit, and I have to cook for a picky 16 year-old who devoured them and said they were good. What a great recipe! Thanks. :)

Best turkey burger ever! My fiance loved it and he hates onions/most anything made healthy. I doubled the pepper, used cajun seasoning in place of seasoned salt, and did not find it overwhelming at all. Used ciabatta rolls for bun and topped with lettuce and avocado. Also- I grilled them on a George Foreman. Thanks for the recipe!!

Made this recipe for the first time tonight, will make it again!  I used 5 peppers, I knew one wouldn't be enough and five was maybe too much, but not bad!  Next time I'll use 3.  The flavor is wonderful!

I thought they were OK and would have rated a 3, but DS gobbled his up and said it was awesome. Score! I guess I'll be making them again. I had to add some cracker crumbs and an egg to make the patties stay together. Maybe it depends on what brand of ground turkey you buy. I used 2 chili peppers because mine were rather small. I thought they were flavored pretty well; I had a 20 oz pckg of turkey, and so I was liberal with all the spices. I wonder if the people who are saying they taste bland were also using the larger package of turkey.

Delicious!  I made these burgers for the family and they were a huge hit.  Like others, I added an egg and used an extra pepper.  I also made these on my indoor electric grill (at approximately 325 degrees) until they reached a temperature of 160.  They turned out fabulous.  These were topped with whole wheat hamburger buns, a little chipotle mayo, pepperjack cheese, lettuce, tomato and avocado and were accompanied by baked sweet potato fries.

My first attempt at turkey burgers. Why is that? These burgers are very good. I followed the advice of others and added an additional chipotle pepper for some extra kick. Served with a sauce of mayo/sour cream chipotle powder - adobo sauce. Excellent. Will make a bunch to freeze. Thanks for the recipe!

Made it exactly as written and it was a HIT with kids and adults! It's obviously a little spicy, so cut down on the chipotle if you need to. YUM.

My husband always complained that Turkey burgers are too plain but i am not a fan of ground beef so we just skipped burgers as an option. Well i finally found a turkey burger that he actually likes. I too added an extra chipotle pepper and it honestly could of used one more in my opinion. Other than that they were full of flavor and extra juicy. Loved It!

Followed the advice of others. Used 2 Chipotle  peppers & even a little more of the adobe sauce. Nice kick. Also added the splash of Cumin. My husband said he'd never try another turkey burger after one bad T. Burger experience... Men lol! Well he ate two huge ones & said he would have attempted eating a third if there was one left!

Very tasty.  Even my kids loved them. One of my kids ate 3 patties!! I did not have a problem shaping them and they came out moist. In order to cut the "poultry" taste of turkey, I add sautéd mushrooms to give it a more of a meaty flavor.

Patties were sticky when forming, but they grilled up nicely. Great flavor. Not too hot when using just one chipotle pepper.

Made for family with very minor changes. Used sea salt for salt, and added a few more seasonings, and added a bit of tomato paste I had frozen, and fresh parsley as I had no cilantro. Loved the chipotle. Served w a homemade simple chipotle sauce on sourdough, as I burned the buns, avocado, onion, tomato, and lettuce. Some may have used ketchup or salsa, too. Husband and son said it was a keeper, and we went back and split the fourth one, something we don't usually do with burgers. I had another pound of ground turkey, so made a batch after dinner and froze them!

Easy recipe. I love spicy food so I used 4 chipotles plus some adobo sauce. The chipotles aren't very large since they're canned. I cooked my burgers on the Forman grill, they were delicious and juicy.I will definitely cook these burgers again.

This was so easy and good.  Most turkey burgers are bland, these had plenty of flavor!  I read some of the other reviews and some people suggested using two of the adobo chilies.  I just used one because some in my house like it hot and some like it mild.  With one, you could taste the flavor, but it wasn't too hot.  I would say if you are a medium to hot salsa person....use two.  I did find one teaspoon of season salt a little much, I think I would use 3/4 teaspoon next time.  However, I was at the very bottom of my season salt and it may have had more 'salt' than 'season' in the very end.  I didn't have mozzarella cheese in slices so i just used a couple pieces of string cheese torn into strips.  Yum.  We also added saute' mushrooms, avocado and bacon to ours.

I think if you add the fixing of tomato, lettuce, pickle/relish, ketchup, mustard it would be better for extra texture, flavor and crunch. Maybe taste test to see if the seasoning is just right for you by frying a little bite size first.

Amazing and juicy burger!
Had to skip the onions because of my mother's stomach issues with them, but they were just delicious!  My family is used to flat, boring burgers, and this recipe really woke them up. I will definitely try again with these, hopefully on my boyfriend, and let him know that burgers are more then just meat patties in buns. Thank you so much mbaucum!

LOVED IT! I didn't have a chipotle chile so I just used a jalapeno pepper from the garden.  We also used lettuce wraps, and topped them with an avocado spread. I will definitely be making these again... and soon!

Awesome recipe! Followed recipe exactly the first time I made them. Second time I made them, I added fresh minced garlic instead of garlic powder, finely chopped jalapenos, two chipotle chiles and added a few dashes of smoked chipotle tabasco. Topped them with lettuce and Trader Joes cilantro dressing (mixed with a bit of fat free mayo). I have made this into meatloaf - added egg and bread crumbs and topped it with Heinz chili sauce). I have also made this into meatballs - added egg and bread crumbs, baked in the oven and put in crock pot with sauce (used equal parts Heinz chili sauce and whole cranberry sauce for the sauce).

I have tried this several times and really like it.  I make sure I 'paper towel' off any moisture from the turkey.  It must be the chipotle because I never have the burgers fall apart on my grill like most turkey burgers do.  Any white cheese is good with this.

This is simply the best. I used the chili adobo sauce and also the onion buns. Everyone raved about them. Buy extra turkey guest demand more. Thanks for sharing 5+ stars. Ground chicken is also great.

The best burger EVER! I baked it for 40 minutes instead of a grill because we didn't have one and fliped it once. But it came out very juicy and not dry at all. It has so much flavor in it. We also used two peppers instead of one and it had the perfect spice

I followed the recipe exactly as stated, and I did not care for these burgers.  I think next time I will use something other than the chipotle peppers in adobo sauce.

Add chipotle ketchup to top it off!  To make the chipotle ketchup, just take one of the left over chipotle peppers and a tablespoon or so of the adobe sauce.  Finely chop the pepper and add the sauce and pepper to 1/8th to 1/4 cup of standard ketchup.  Keep adding ketchup until you get the heat level/flavor intensity you like.  Then serve with the burgers.  

PS.  I personally use 4 chipotle peppers per pound of turkey for this recipe - nice heat at this level, but not too overpowering for those who like hot foods.

This was one of the most flavorful turkey burgers that I have ever tasted. I wanted to try this recipe because a) I love spicy food, b) the ingredients were simple and things I already had on hand. I did tweak the recipe a little based on my personal preferences and comments that other reviewers made.

1st: Turkey burgers tend to suffer from dryness and I didn't want that, so what I did was saute the 1/2 cup of chopped onions in 2 tbsp of EVOO. I let it cool slightly and then added it to the meat.

2nd: I added 1 tsp of ranch powder (because ranch makes everything better in my opinion :-) I also added 1 finely chopped roasted red pepper because I felt that this would compliment the flavor profile of the recipe.

3rd: Some reviewers suggested adding 1 extra chipotle pepper for more spice and some cumin. I did both of these things, however I only added 1/2 tsp of cumin because I didn't want it to overwhelm the turkey.

I put this in the fridge to let the flavors combine and then cooked them on the charcoal grill. What resulted was a juicy, flavorful, spicy turkey burger. I used pepper jack cheese for extra bite. (If you aren't prone to spicy foods, I think that 1 chipotle pepper will do the trick). Try and enjoy this recipe, you will not regret it.

I make this often.  You can make it more or less spicy depending on how much of the chile in adobo sauce you use.  I use one chile and some of the sauce.  I also mince up a chile and mix that (plus some of the sauce) with mayo to make a sauce for the burgers.

This was very flavorful!  I did take the advice of other reviewers and put in the freezer for an hour, and it really helped the grilling process and keeping the turkey together.  

Thanks for a enjoyable recipe!

This came out alright but not great. Possibly because i made it on the skillet since I did not have a barbque at the time. I did not have chile in adobo sauce so I used a can of chopped chiles. I also used shredded mozzarella and put it in the middle of the burger. Not sure I would try this one again.

SO GOOD. I followed the advice of other reviewers and used 2 chiles, and I put shredded mozzarella inside the burgers by making two thin patties with cheese in between. I'll be making more this week.

I used canned chipolte because I could not find fresh. I also added paprika and cumin to the mix. I do not have a grill so I cooked it in a pan in our kitchen. My version was tasty but needed something. I'm thinking a creamy sauce would have helped.

Absolutely hands down the best turkey burger I have ever had!  I used monterey jack cheese and a little extra spicy seasoning (cajun) in addition to the ingredients listed.  HUGE hit for the entire family.

Amazing!  Moist and juicy, even though the grill broke and I had to pan fry them.  We used cheddar cheese and dressed them with ranch for a "Chipotle Cheddar Ranch" type burger like the fast food joints.  I can't wait to make these again!

I'm not a fan of turkey burgers, but this was so good that after trying this, I'm even open to trying some other recipes!  Maybe I've been missing out on something here.

This is a great recipe for truly tender juicy turkey burgers. I like a little more spice so i added two additional chile's. If you like a little less heat take the seeds out. Same great flavor less heat.

These burgers deserve all of the stars given to them.  Followed the advise of a reviewer and added more cilantro, more chipotle and used Gouda cheese slices between two patties.  What a way to spice up the traditional Memorial Weekend menu.  Thank you for sharing the recipe.

These were delicious!   Very moist, and I used the 97% fat free ground turkey breast.  I used 2 chipotles instead of 1.  I also cooked them in a pampered chef grill skillet on the stove top using Pam spray.  Loved them with swiss cheese.

I had never eaten or made a turkey burger up until this one so i was a little skeptical. But this was so delicious!!!! I think it has made me like turkey burgers better than hamburgers. The cilantro and chipotle made this burger perfect! My boss even raved about it!

These were the best burgers we have ever had! The enire family LOVED them. We are making our 2nd batch today to put outside on the grill since the weather is nice can't wait!!!
We added a little bit of plain bread crumbs to keep the patties firm also put extra peppers for more spice!!!

I did not care for this. The texture was unappealing and the cilantro flavour was all you could taste.  I followed this recipe exactly.  Maybe turkey burger lovers don't mind this texture/taste.

Only changes were I used red onion and 1 tsp adobo sauce. Next time I will bump that up to at least 2 or 3 tsp sauce because it was lacking in flavor and spice. Overall though they were tasty and easy. I will likely make these again!

First time ever making turkey burgers or cooking with ground turkey period! Very yummy! No more ground beef for us! Kids thought it was a bit spicy but I loved them. Made as is. Don't forget to indent the middle so they don't shrink up to hockey pucks and they only made 3 s/m burgers for us. Def doubling recipe next time.

These were really good, I even used ground 99% fat free turkey breast.  I did mix shredded mozzerella cheese into the mixture instead of slices on top.  It helped to keep them moist.

Better late than never.  I've been making this recipe for several years now . . . . my family loves it.  I've taken it to share at events with great reviews.  The only ingredient I've clarified as I wouldn't say I changed is the ground turkey.  I always use ground all white turkey breast.  Yum and lower in fat.

Very good and easy to prepare.
I doubled the chipotle chiles in the recipe.
I also brushed the burger with adobo sauce about 3 minutes before pulling the burgers from the grill.

Very good, best Turkey Burgers we've had.  The only changes we made were adding one extra chipotle pepper, and we substituted pepper jack cheese in place of the mozzarella because we like things a little spicier.  Excellent as is though!

These were pretty good but I would definitely make some changes if I make it again. I like spicy so I used pepper jack cheese instead of motzarella. Next time I would use an additional chipotle chile as well. I think I liked this even better reheated the next day.

Loved this recipe!-- and my husband already packed both of the leftover patties in tomorrow's lunch!  If you like things EXTRA spicy, like we do, add 4-5 chipolte peppers and some of their sauce! But beware-- at this point, it definitely has some kick!

Had to make a few changes...

The grocery store was almost out of ground turkey, so I mixed turkey with ground chicken.

I used Italian Parsley instead of cilantro, and didn't use the chipotle chili...  I wasn't sure how hot they are and didn't want to overdo it, plus I didn't really want to buy a jar of them to only use a single pepper... so instead I poured in a couple tablespoons of Franks Red Hot Buffalo Chicken sauce.  I know,  completely different taste that what the pepper would have provided, but that's what I did. :p

End result... fantastic!  Great combo of spice in the burgers, nice and moist.

Will definitely make these again, they were so easy to make and delicious.

This one is really good!!  Watch how many chipotle peppers you put in though.  I would start with one then add from there. A little dash (1/2 tsp) of cumin made for a nice addition.

This was awesome!  My grocery store didn't sell chipotle chilis in adobo sauce so I replaced that with 1 jalapeno pepper.  I also topped with a spicy mayo and pepper jack cheese!

These are good!  I wasn't sure my picky husband would enjoy turkey burgers, but he ate two!  I took the advice of other reviewers and added an extra pepper as well as about a tsp of chipotle seasoning.  Moist and delicious!

Hands down the best turkey burger I've had.  We have made these for the family a lot and entertained as well.  Everyone is always pleasantly surprised and gets seconds...even those that don't like turkey burgers!  Thank you for the great recipe.

I am a wimp when it comes to heat, but I could not even taste the chipotle in this burger. I was hoping for some heat, but got nothing. I'll try this recipe again with 2 chipotles sometime and will adjust my review if it is better. With only one pepper, it was pretty bland

This was a really good way to eat ground turkey, I will make this again but without the chipotle chile, not a of that taste.

I made these burgers last night (exactly as written) and did not enjoy them very much.  They were quite bland, which was surprising given all the delicious ingredients.  If I were to make these again, I would increase the chipotles to at least 3, add some minced fresh garlic and then top them with a stronger cheese.  Maybe bleu cheese would be better.  Overall, I wasn't impressed and won't be making them again.  They were, however, a healthy alternative to beef burgers and I like that!

My husband turned his nose up when he saw me making turkey burgers. His mind changed at the dinner table; he was surprised by the spicy combination and ate two! The only modifications I made was to use about 3 cloves of fresh garlic and I omitted the cilantro only because I forgot it at the grocery store. I served with fresh guacamole and salsa with tortilla chips for a quick, easy and healthy meal.

This recipe is such a keeper!  The first time I made these burgers, I made as the original recipe directs (except without cilantro).  They were good - my boyfriend and I both liked them.  His 4-year-old even ate half of one (we had to call them Krabby Patties to get him to try it) and he liked it, too!  The second time I made these, I added two more chipotles to the mix...We like it extra spicy and it was just that!  So good!!  I served them with lettuce, tomato and mayo.  Double thumbs up for such a great recipe!!

I love these burgers. They are awesome. The only thing I changed was I added 1 more Chipolte in adobo because we love spicy food. Very, Very Good!!

What a great way to dress up ground turkey. The flavors are delicious! Used monterey jack cheese instead of mozz. Thanks for this recipe!

Love this recipie. Like the substitution of ground turkey over beef. The only issue I have is that it was hard to find some of the spices at my grocery store. I ended up buying Mccormick dry seasoning pack called Chipotle Pepper and it is awesome. I still use fresh chopped red onion and cilantro...so if anyone struggles with finding or buying a ton of seasonings this is a good substitution!

Absolutely Fabulous!! actually deserves more stars! i am not a huge fan or turkey burgers, but my husband is. So i decided to try and find a recipe for turkey burgers that i could enjoy as well. the flavors that come out of this burger are so insane! i followed the reciped with the exception of the onion, didn't have any so i used chives from our garden. topped it with a home-made chipotle mayo and it was great. it would be a great burger choice for a BBQ. if all turkey burgers could taste this good...i'd never go back to beef :)

I think having real minced garlic instead of powder would be great.  It was soooo tasty!!  I paired it with the chipotle mayo from here.  Soooo good.

I use green onions instead of regular onions and saute them a little until they are soft.  Then on top of the Mozzarella (or cheddar) we put a slice of crispy turkey bacon.  My husband says these are his favorite summer meal.  They are fantastic.

Very good! I halved the recipe, but since I added a few finely minced mushrooms, I treated the recipe like three servings when I added seasonings. I did add an extra chipotle pepper and for me and my spice loving husband, it was a bit much. So next time, more chipotle than the recipe calls for, but only about 2 times as much, not 4 times! This burger will definitely be worked into the rotation. Delicious.

I really enjoyed this.  They wernt dry at all and I did take the advice of some other reviewers and I added shreaded mozzarella into the meat, I added two peppers and omitted the onion powder.  I also only put about 1 tsp of cilantro because I am not super big on it and half the season salt.  They were moist and juicy and held up pretty well.  I also sprayed them with a little pam before putting them on the grill and they didnt stick.

These were really tasty. I used two peppers, but didn't think it made it too spicy at all.  I also threw some mozzarella into the mixture.  I can't say I was as wowed as some of the other reviewers, but will definitely make again.

This was REALLY good. I followed it mainly to the letter. The only differences are 1)I eyed how mush onion I used, may have been a little less than 1/2 cup, and 2) I used 1 tbsp dried parsley instead of the cilantro as I'm not a fan. My boyfriend was almost disgusted (why I don't know)by the idea of turkey burgers, but this successfully changed his mind! Thanks!

My boyfriend usually does the grilling, so I was a bit nervous about being the one in charge of the burgers... I did end up making the patties too thick to start, so I was worried they would be dry once they finally cooked through.  However, these burgers turned out moist and delicious! We will be making these again soon!

I absolutely LOVE these turkey burgers!! I have made them several times. I'm not a "griller" but these burgers make me get out the grill about once a month. I also add 2 chipotle peppers and a little of the sauce (yum!)

Amazing.  I've had other turkey burgers, and this is the best.  I didn't have cilantro or chili the first time I made it, and we loved it.  Now I always make it without, but that's just our preference (and easy to pull together last minute).  It will probably replace regular hamburgers in my kitchen.

I fixed these burgers for a cookout I hosted last Friday. I couldn't get my outdoor grill fire going to  medium high, I was working with a charcol grill,  so it was a slow cook time that more or less smoked the burgers. THEY TURNED OUT AMAZING! EVERYONE WENT CRAZY about the burgers! I also put the mozorella cheese inside and it was an unexpected treat. 

They were such a hit I had to make another batch of them with 4lbs of turkey on Sunday. I did the second batch on my indoor grill. They turned out great. Just watch the chesse, you dont want it seeping out the sides. I suggest when making the patty make a well and insert the cheese then roll the patty into a ball and loosley flatten - indoor grills will continue to flatten the patty out. 

I loved the flavors and the chesse complimented the spices well. I did add an extra pepper per pound. 

An excellent recipe my friends and family can't wait for me to make again. I will say that to get decent size burgers it's best to stick to 4-5 burgers per pound. Trying to make more that number causes the patties to look like little turkey rocks Lol! 

Will post pictures if I can keep hands off long enough to get the camera!!

Hmm, Hmm, Hmm...Will be using this recipe again. Very flavorful and would be good without all the burger fixings. My husband took a bit, looked down at it and exclaimed, ", that's good!"

D-licious! Have made these several times and they come out great every time. I do add 2 chipotle peppers and about 1 tsp of the adobo sauce too. Everyone I've made them for loved them.

The first time I made these, I didn't have the chipolte chiles in adobo sauce and substituted green chiles. Not horrible, but not very memorable. Picked up the ones called for and tried again - WOW, what a difference! These will be made again. I used up the rest of the chiles in the Mexican Tinga recipe a couple nights later. Worked well!

These were great! But remember unless you want them extra spicy remove the seeds from the chipotle peppers. I also added shreded mozzarella in the mixture so the whole burger was cheesy.

Yummy!! Your die-hard beef eaters will not complain! I added ~ 1/4 green pepper which gave a little chrunch. I sprayed the burgers (& grill) w/oil since the turkey had so little fat. Delicious! Thanks for sharing mbaucum!

These burgers were awesome! We eat ground turkey quite often, but this is by far the best! We BBQ'd it, and just put some mayo and mustard on hamburger buns. The kids even liked them! We will definitely eat again!!

This recipe was amazing!  My husband used the george forman, which worked quite well.  We both agreed that some type of chipotle or barbecue sauce would go well on top... to add moisture and more flavor.

This turkey burger was great and my boyfriend loved it. I used parsley instead of cilantro because I find the taste of cilantro to be over powering. Next time I'll use more chipotle. I also used wheat rolls and cooked them in a grill pan. I'm sure they would be more exceptional out on a charcoal grill. When I remake I'll definitely do just that.

Loved this. My husband liked it so much he wanted it again two nights later.  I made them a little spicier the next night, and they were perfect. Super good.  We even used the 99% fat free turkey and didn't taste like we were comprising in any way.  This might be the end of red meat burgers in our house!  Also, our grill is no longer with us so I cooked them on the stove with a large frying pan.

I actually signed up for a membership just so that I could post my review on this recipe. It was tremendously delicious! My husband and I gobbled up these burgers like they were the last burgers on earth. I highly recommend topping them with guacamole. It cools off the chipotle. These burgers rocked!

These burgers were excellent.  I took the seeds out of the chipotle peppers and the burgers were not very spicy so next time we'll probably either use more peppers or keep the seeds in.  I ate mine on a toasted whole wheat bun with avocado... loved it!

This was one tasty turkey burger. I added an egg to help hold it together and to keep it moist. I also added two Chile's in adobe to give it some extra kick. I served it on a ciabatta roll and it was yummy!

Yum! I love this variation of Turkey burgers and plan on making them again sometime. I cut the recipe in half and only used 1/2 of a chipotle, next time I will use it all. My turkey burger was moist and delicious!

These were the best turkey burgers I ever had! For the peppers I just bought the smallest can I could find, ground them up in my mini food processor (although a blender would work too) and I used about a tablespoon of it total for all four burgers. I might use more cilantro next time. These were just great!

If it were up to me I would have rated this recipe a 5 however my boyfriend didn't like them much at all.  He isn't into spicy food so you must like a little heat to enjoy this recipe.  Tasted wonderful with mozzarella cheese on top.

I had all intentions of making the recipe just as written, then got lazy.  So I give it 5 stars because I only used the dried spices, oiled the patties before grilling and called it done.  It had a great flavor and came out so, so juicy. I used the 20 oz package of ground turkey for 3 giant burgers.  Total grilling time on med-high heat was 15 minutes with the last 2 melting the cheese.  Also, shaped the patties then put in frig for 15 minutes to let the flavors meld together before grilling. Can't wait to make them with all the ingredients!

Really good. My husband is skeptical about "burgers" that do not use hamburger but I got him to try this and he thought it was good. I used ground turkey (not breasts) since I was afraid they might be too dry and they came out more moist than I thoguht they would.

This recipe was awesome!! A little spicy but very flavorful and moist!! I did put greased foil down on the grill to make sure that the burgers didn't stick to the grill too much and fall apart. I will definitely make this recipe again!

Excellent.  I never thought ground turkey could be so good.  I doubled the chipotle peppers to make it a bit spicier.  I will definitely be making these again.

Tasted great, but I put in twice the amount of Chiptole Chile and it was too strong.  Stick with what the recipe suggests.

I am giving this a 4 only cause I changed some...but the idea is a 5 star for sure! I used one pepper and chopped it up for 2 burgers.  I used a lightly toasted english muffin.  I grilled red onions while I cooked the burgers (in a grill pan).  I had some reduced fat cheddar cheese and this was spicy and yummy.
