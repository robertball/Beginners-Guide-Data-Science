These are really yummy! Make sure to squeeze all the "juice" out of the tomatoes as it makes sticking the dough together more difficult. Very good right out of the oven with some sour cream!

I made these last night for a tapas party at my place, along with a couple of other "small plate"-type dishes.  These really exceeded my expectations!  I actually made the filling the night before, and I tried it for seasoning - it tasted fine, but not great.  We also went ahead and assembled them that night (using a fork to press down the edges to seal), and popped them in the fridge overnight.  They came out GREAT!  We served with sour cream and they were really tasty.  Definitely came out to be more than the sum of its parts! Highly recommend! :o)

Really good and easy, and taste good with all different fillings.  Be sure not to fill the empanadas too much, and be careful not to touch the edges with the filling or they will be hard to seal closed.

If you are not a fan of refrigerated bread mixes (i.e. Pillsbury) this recipe is not for you.  I thought it would be ok by the time we added sour cream & pico de gallo on the top, but I just could not get over that refrigerated dough taste. I might make this again, but I'll make my own dough in the bread machine.

This was an easy recipe to make and especially fun to make it with my husband. Dipping these in pizza sauce and/or sour cream is fun too. I will be making these again.

These make for tasty little sandwiches.  I ended up using crescent roll dough.  My pizza dough had expired so it didn't work very well.  Tasted great with the crescent roll dough, too.

I replaced the tomatoes with hash brown potatoes, and the hard boiled eggs with scrambled eggs cooked with the onion.  Wonderful!

I liked these, but it's a lot of work. Peeling, chopping, stretching, filling, and folding. I'll definitely wait to make these until I have an opportunity to cook in silence, but that doesn't happen much in my house.

These were yummy and super easy. I brushed them with egg before baking so they were shiny and lovely!

Our whole family really enjoys this recipe.  We also enjoy extracting the juice, warming it up, and serving it on top of the Empanadas.

This recipe was really yummy. I am Puerto Rican and make this a number of different ways. Usually I use ground beef. I cook the ground beef, add chopped green olives (just a few), use some adobo seasoning and sazon packets (can be found in the international food section of your supermarket, and finally use some sofrito ( 1 onion, cilantro, peppers, garlic and culantro blended with a little olive oil which is the base for most of our cooking) and this is my filling. Of course drain the ground beef. I also buy the dough in the frozen section. The goya ones work well. If you like you can add shredded cheese to the ground beef as well.

I love this recipe! This time, I cooked empanadas with tuna instead of ham, without onion.  Also, used a packaged dough sold in a typical Spanish supermarket "masa de empanadillas".

This recipe is okay, but not great.  Next time I'd like to try a different crust.  I make a beef empanaditas recipe with a crust similar to pie crust, so I might try that.  

Also, if you peel and seed the tomotoes, it seems that the juices mainly come out of the tomatoes with the seeds anyway. (I'm saying this because of earlier comments about this).

Chucked the Onion(allergy), the rest was great. The biggest problem I had was rolling out the dough thin enough. I made my own dough for it instead of pizza dough. I have also used crescent rolls which gives them a buttery taste. Stuff-able with anything, just don't over stuff them :D
