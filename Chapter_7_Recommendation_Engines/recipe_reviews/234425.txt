These were delicious. The process was uncomplicated, but very time consuming (which is why I rated it only 4 stars). I topped mine with a maple cream cheese frosting and bacon, which was a big hit.

I used the primary version listed. 2 minutes was a bit long for these delicate delights. 1 - 1.5 minutes worked well for my cronuts. I used the amount of milk listed and noticed the glaze was a bit dry so I added 2 squirts of a lemon. This gave the glaze a great flavor. Overall, this was a great and well written recipe. I really enjoyed making and eating the cronuts! Thanks Chef John!

Powdered sugar, milk, & vanilla, I think you left out some of the ingredients. I'd love to see the full recipe.

Rainy day here, so the perfect time to make these. Im guarding the ones that are left right now, because they are stealing them before the glaze sets!

Yes I made this twice, I also made it with more icing. My Great Nephews and I LOVE IT. One even helped me make them the first time. The photo I added was from the first time and the odd shaped ones is the end of the dough, Yes I forgot to take photos, with them all.

I love this recipe.  I have been trying to make a homemade donut that is as good, or better, than a store bought donut for YEARS!  This one has become my absolute favorite.  It is time consuming but all things considering, not that hard.  I have not been able to reply to some of the questions on here but after making these many times now, I will answer from my experience.  1-  You can use regular unsalted butter.  They will still turn out but lose some of their crispiness.  If you want the full experience, really try to find the low moisture. 2- I have made it with and without the nutmeg.  Although it does add another layer of flavor, even this small amount can sometimes seem overwhelming.  I prefer it without but it is really up to your personal taste.  3-  I usually do refrigerate overnight so that we can enjoy these for breakfast.  I go through all of the steps of folding in the butter and then for the 2 hour refrigerated rising, I leave it in the fridge overnight.  Just be aware that the dough will rise A LOT so make sure you leave it in loose plastic wrap and even then, I like to store it in a bigger container with a lid.  4- Part 2 calls for grapeseed oil.  I highly recommend finding some as it adds the "donut store taste".  However, I have found through many trials that using about half grapeseed oil and half coconut oil lends itself to just the right balance of crispiness without getting overly greasy.  You can use vegetable oil but it will not turn out as well.  The

Just made these today. When I started, I wasn't sure how it would turn out, but once done, they were golden, crispy, and tasty! I enjoyed making these. The icing was pretty good too and can't wait to try different icing flavors with these donuts.
