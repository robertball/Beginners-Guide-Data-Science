this makes a great thanksgiving stuffing for turkey.  however, i would suggest cutting down the amount of butter called for, and add some chicken broth (about one cup).  this makes the stuffing more moist and cuts down on the fat content.

I don't know what possessed me to try this recipe.  In retrospect, I should have known from the ingredients and instructions that it wouldn't be good.  I made it for Thanksgiving dinner but I was too embarrassed to serve it.  The only advice I can give to someone who definitely wants to try this recipe is to maybe chop the apple well (I diced it) and perhaps crumble the bread instead of cubing it.

It's a five star when you add mushrooms.  I have been using this recipe for years.  It's right out of Joy of Cooking, but Joy of Cooking didn't have mushrooms in the recipe.  Cut the bread into crouton size squares, and don't skimp on celery or onion.  I usually have to make a lot more and add 1/3 more ingredients.  The raisins make this recipe taste as if I used wine, at least that's what my dinner guests tell me.

I made this for Christmas dinner and it was pretty good, but not as good as I had hoped.  If you follow the recipe as written, it makes a LOT of dressing-- definitely more than will fit into a 2 quart baking dish (8x8) as the recipe calls for.  I put it in a 9x13 pan an it was almost too much for that!  I used a 16 oz package of Pepperidge Farm stuffing mix (right at 7 cups) and a little less butter (I poured some pan juices from my baked chicken over it) but otherwise followed the rest of the recipe pretty closely.  The apple in it was very good and that's what my husband particularly enjoyed.  Sunmaid now makes "baking raisins" which are already plumped up-- no need for soaking, which was very convenient.  I think if I try this again I'll make only half and will try to use plain bread cubes instead.  It was good, just not as yummy as I had hoped for.

A quick shortcut is to use StoveTop stuffing and add all the fixin's to it.  Taste great and so easy!

I really enjoyed this dish and others who shared this with me over Thanksgiving raved about it! At someone's suggestion, I added a little chicken stock so it was perfectly moist. Tasty.

This was a great recipe, with a little modification.  I  used store bought bread cubes in a bag (w/a light onion seasoning).  I prepared the night before and refrigerated until I was ready to cook it.  Before baking I added LOW SODIUM chicken broth and some of the broth from my Turkey and baked when the turkey only had about an hour left.  I made a large recipe and it turned out wonderfully.  It was a big hit at the dinner table!

This is the same recipe that my grandmother used to make years ago.  It is excellent!!!  A nice addition or change to "Sage" dressing.

I am marking this down - not for taste but for lack of broth.  I used 1/2 cup of butter (could have used less) but had to add quite a bit of broth to pull this together.  Tasty with the broth - without it it would have been really dry.

I have made this dressing 2 years in a row at Thanksgiving time.  Every time I've made it it's been a big hit.  The only thing different I do is use craisins instead of raisins.

I made this last night and we ALL loved it.  I prepared the stuffing as the directions state  (except I did not add the paprika).  Then I put it in the oven for 30minutes.  While it was cooking I put butter in a pan and sliced up 3 chicken breast halves and cooked them in the butter.  I then added it to the stuffing mixture and cooked an additional 15 minutes.  So good.

This was a really tasty and simple dressing to make. I toasted the bread first and added some chicken stock to the mixture before I baked it. The dressing came out moist and delicious. I served it with some pork chops and gravy and will definitely make this recipe again and again!

Delicious! Made this for Thanksgiving dinner this year and my family loved it. I made a few modifications as suggested by other reviewers: used craisins instead of raisins, pepperidge farm stuffing mix instead of bread cubes, cut down the butter (I used 1/2 cup), and added chicken broth (about 8-10 oz). I also baked it in a 9x13 pan which was about the perfect size. I've already been told I'll be making it again next year.

Great recipe, had this with Christmas dinner. We substituted fresh cranberries over the raisins, and added about a cup of chicken stock to keep it moist.

This was an excellent basic stuffing recipe.  I took the advice of another reviewer and used about 3/4 of a stick of butter and one cup of broth.  I used vegetable broth since I'm a vegetarian.  Everyone really enjoyed it!

Great Dressing.  More like a stuffing I think.  But it was great.  We made it with butterfly pork chops.  It was fantastic!!

I made this for Thanksgiving last year and it has become a request for every big family meal we have.  Kids and Grandparents alike love it.  i sometimes use dried Crandberries instead of Raisins.  They give it a real zing.

I love that you use raisins to make a sweet broth. I usually use about half cup of raisins and blend into a puree discard the rest and keep the liquidbroth-  lending a subtle sweetness to the stuffing. It also means no one can get weirded out by cooked raisins as some people I know do (it's like sneaking vegetables in...). I also ramp up the seasoning depending on the crowd.

I liked the combination of flavors and textures in this bread stuffing. It seemed to need a little something more, though.  Next time I'll drizzle some of the turkey drippings over the top while it's baking.

This is always a huge hit at Thanksgiving.  I do make two small modifications: (1) use dried cranberries instead of raisins and (2) add a little Apple juice or cider for moisture.  This complements the Granny Smiths and also keeps the dish suitable for a vegetarian in the family

This was excellent! The only change I made was to substitute Craisins for the raisins because I don't like raisins.

Accidently used twice the butter. OMG! What deliciousness!! Aaaand... Add 2 beaten eggs & 1-2 cups broth or plain water to  add moisture and to bind the dish upon baking. Great dressing served with roast goose.

Great - didn't put in raisins. Mainly use it for ratios of ingredients.
