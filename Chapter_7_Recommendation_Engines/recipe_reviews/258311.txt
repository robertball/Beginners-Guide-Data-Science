This is a little too tart for me as written so I added just a little stevia to sweeten it up a bit. My strawberries were frozen but I still used 1/2 cup of them. My drink turned out ice cold and slightly thickened. I love smoothie recipes with almond milk and fresh fruit. This is a really good one!
