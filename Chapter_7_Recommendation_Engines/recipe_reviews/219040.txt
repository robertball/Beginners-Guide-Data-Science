I'm gonna go ahead and give this one a thumbs up, without having made it yet.  I am planning my niece's baby shower this fall, and this sounds really, really good!  What a clever idea.  Will update after the shower to let you know how everyone liked them

Well I bought green apples just to try this recipe out.. and of course they were the one "snack" my kids chose last night before bed... and of course we were out of my son's favorite food -Cream Cheese-... so I did still attempt to make this becuase I was craving it thismorning... I used Honey Crisp Apples, I toasted the Raisin Bread (I like crunch) & used Havarti Cheese (MY Favorite) and it was fantastic. Made it for breakfast for myself with a cup of Almond Milk and it was a very light healthy feeling Breakfast. I would definately make again! Only next time I will make sure we have cream cheese and my kids don't eat all the Granny Smith Apples!

The more of these I ate, the more I liked them. At first I wasn't sure about the apple in this and the mix of textures, and I'm still not sure I like the crunchy apple, but I do like the flavors in this and they all do go well together. I could see this as something I would serve guests at a luncheon or take to a pot luck. These were fast and easy to assemble and you could make a whole platter full in minutes with no sweat. I only used 3 oz of cream cheese for 8 pieces of bread and it was plenty.

After making the sandwiches, I buttered the outside and made like a grilled cheese sandwich.  Really good and different for lunch.

I was looking for a different kind of sandwich to take to a large church function and these filled the bill.  I was afraid the apples would darken before they were served, so I dipped them into lemon juice and there was no problem.  I'd bought Gala apples, thinking the red skin would be more attractive than the green, but perhaps Granny Smith would have been better after all since they're not as sweet.     I'd recommend not slicing the apples too thin because you want that textural crunch contrast.

Since there were so many people at the event I only got feedback from one person, who said it was a nice combination of flavors.   I tried one myself and thought it was good.

I have made these for a fund raiser tea for a number of years now and they are always a hit.  I eventually found the ladies requesting the same three sandwiches and this was one of them.  Now when we need food I know what to bring. These are easy, transport well, but never last long-make plenty!

Made these for a wedding shower that we had a work for one of my co-workers.  They were delicious and went like hotcakes.  My boss, who is picky, even loved them.  Even my son and daughter (11 and 8) liked them.  I can't wait to make the again.  I can't stand soft squishy sandwiches and I am always the one to add chips to my cream cheese or chicken salad sandwiches.  With these sandwiches, the crunch of the apples made it unnecessary. :)
