I cut the cheese into sticks half the size suggested and left the sticks to set in the fridge for half an hour. I experienced none of the leakage other reviews have mentioned and the cheese sticks were a big hit with everyone.

Pretty good considering I made a few changes to the original recipe. instead of cornflakes I used about 1 and 1/2 cups of seasoned breadcrumbs. also If you cut an entire brick of moz. cheese it makes about 24 semi-big cheese sticks. I did have a few problems with leaking cheese and after reading other reveiws I coated each stick 2-3 times with egg and breadcrumb. After baking them at 400 degrees for 8 minutes the crust wasn't very hard so I let the cheese harden then put them in at 425 for another 5 minutes or so. With these changes the recipe turned out great!

These were all right. Nice change from the usual fried stuff but these were not real easy to coat I've noticed - the egg and flour mixture didn't make the breading stick too well - I think the flakes were a little too heavy in consistency. I'd make them again though - probably with a few changes to the mixture.

I thought that I would give these a shot using bread crumbs instead of the cornflakes. When I took them out of the oven after the 8 minutes they looked fine but the breading looked uncooked so I turned the oven off & let them sit in there a few minutes and they melted. The breading held it's shape & everything but some of the cheese leaked out. I think that next time I will use the whole egg instead of just the white & see what happens then. Even with the "leaky" cheese they were good (I mean they are just going to get chewed anyway right)? Something to tinker with thanks Lynda.

Yup these were leakers! Thought I'd give these a try because they're healthier than frying. They just melted away. Although they were certainly good in taste I'll have to stick to my fry daddy way of cooking cheese sticks.

The cheese was over melted and the bread crumbs did not stick. Will try these again. Maybe it wasn't beginners luck. But will try them again!

I tried this recipe because it called for corn flakes instead of bread crumbs since I didn't have any at the time. I threw the corn flakes oregano and garlic salt in the food processor and blended them until they were very fine. This made the coating stick a lot better than if they were just crushed by hand. I deep fried them just until cheese began to try to leak out. They came out crunchy and tasty. Will do again!

While these didn't taste too bad the cheese leaked everywhere and made them completely unpresentable. I will not be trying these again; if anyone out there wants cheese sticks I would recommend trying something that involves frying the mozzarella between two slices of Italian bread.

Lynda- I used this recipe and I made sure that the coating was COMPLETELY cover at least twice! The cheese STILL leaked out I don't really care for your recipe.

These work great for me! Just double coat them and let them set up in the fridge for an hour and they will hold much better in the oven. Keep an eye on them and enjoy with salsa or marinara sauce. Love cheese sticks!

we modified this slightly but give it 5 stars b/c it met our craving! we used store bought cheese sticks cut in half so that each piece is about 2 in long. we used 2 whole eggs instead of the egg whites we used bisquick in place of flour but i doubt this matters we crunched the corn flakes up quite a bit but they could be more crunched:) or food processed welet them set up for 30 minutes in fridge we did not experience the leaking issues as in the cheese did not spill out however they did flatten some but this is exactly how we had it in a fav restaurant so we were happy with it...we baked it at 425-450 and i think that made all the difference!!! we even could have cooked them longer to soften the cheese more....they were so crunchy and delicious!

These were ok. I think I did something wrong but they tasted more like mozzarella flavored cornflakes than cheese sticks. To everyone who complained about there cheese sticks "leaking" you guys didn't coat it well. anyway thanx Lynda but i dont think ill be making these again.

Season your flour. S & P garlic powder oregano your choice. Leave stick whole. FREEZE sticks before dipping. Use whole egg and water. Will only need to go from flour to egg to SEASONED (again - to taste) Panko and then into oven for stated time. Freezing and seasoning makes all the difference! Invest in Panko for these. We like pizza or marinara (fancy name for non-meat Sp. sauce!) sauce for dipping.

I got this recipe to work with some minor changes. First I used mozzarella cheese sticks the kind you snack on. I also used seasoned bread crumbs and whole egg. Here's the key to "oven-fried anything." Spray the tops of them with cooking spray!!! This will make the coating crisp up before they melt. Are they as good as what you get in a restaurant? No. Are they healthier and cheaper? You bet! This is a good substitute for the real thing.

I so wanted these to work! Prepared as directed - i froze the sticks for 30 minutes as well but all of the cheese oozed out. I guess cheese sticks were not made to be lightened. I will fry them next time.

I THINK THE MELTING ISSUE ID DUE TO THE TEMP AND BAKING TIME. YOU ARE HEATING THEM INDIRECTLY AND THE CHEESE HEATS UP BEFORE THE COATING CRISPS I RECOMMEND USING THE BROILER TO "SET" THE COATING. MUCH LIKE FRYING DOES. THE GOAL IS REALLY JUST TO BROWN THE OUTSIDE. AND UPPING THE TEMP A LITTLE I AM GOING TO TRY IT AND I'LL UPDATE YOU! IT HAS WORKED FOR OTHER RECIPES IN THE PAST.

I love the breading for these cheese sticks. I used string cheese sticks and froze them for about 20 minutes after breading them. I also deep fried them instead of baking. Super tasty if a little messy.

Too salty and the coating didn't hold the cheese... it melted all over the place. Although the coating was delicious. _

Just like the other reviewers the cheese all leaked out and the breading or crust never browned. It did suffice the craving but if you are really want to do these right go for the fried version.

With 3 stars I decided to give this recipe a try. I more or less got a mozzerella cheese casserole with breading bricks (i used bread crumbs too). Two suggestions that I'll try next time: 1. Sweetened cornflakes might be a good idea. The cheese is incredibly salty and salty breading only makes it worse. 2. FREEZING or REFRIDGERATING the breadsticks would make it possible to crustify and crunch-itize the coating and melt the cheese so that it doesn't ooze. This is how they make Deep Fried Ice Cream =)

Pretty good recipe...I think next time I may try lighty salting the cheese before the breading process...see if it will draw some moisture out. We used Italian bread crumbs in place of the corn flakes and deep fried them instead of baking. (gotta have the grease:) Good recipe Lynda thank you for sharing.

Made these as instructed but substituted panko breadcrumbs for the cornflakes. They were as good as a restaurant version. No leaking cheese plenty of crisp... Be sure to: 1. use the snacking cheese sticks and cut them in half. 2. thoroughly coat cheese with flour egg and then pat the breadcrumbs to get them to stick. 3. FREEZE them to set the cheese. 4. place on a greased surface and spray the top of them with oil. Yummy!

Super yummy! One thing: make sure you don't cook it on a cooling rack. I did this with a pan underneath thinking it would ensure crispiness on both side sides but all it did was ensure the cheese melted through to the bottom. Still delish when we reunited 'shell' and cheese but still:)

This recipe is pretty good! I used mozzarella sticks that were pre-made aka STRING CHEESE instead of a block of mozzarella. I cut those in half. I tossed the cut sticks in the flour and got a really good thick coat. Then I submerged them in the egg mixture (I used 4 eggs in a small container) and then coated them in the cereal mixture. I made sure to repeat the last two steps... that seems key to getting an even coat. I baked them for 13 minutes and that made the cheese perfect. Yes it leaked out a little on the sides but the ones I get from Schwan's do too. All in all I enjoyed the flavor and process of making these. They tasted great and were pretty simple. The four star rating is because they're a little time intensive if you're going to do them right. Thanks for the recipe!

Much better and easier than fried. I used bread crumbs instead of corn flakes and I let the sticks set in the refrigerator instead of at room temperature; they came out perfect and melt-free. Good luck!

My family enjoyed these. I made them as written using homemade mozzarella from goat milk. I appreciate having an alternative to the fried mozzarella sticks.

I don't know if I will make these again though I did like them. They flattened in the oven and the coating didn't stick well or at all. I may make them again for myself but not for entertaining.

These were pretty good. I put full size string cheese sticks in the freezer for 30 minutes prior to coating them then back in for 10 minutes after coating them and none of them leaked. we had pretzel crumbs so those replaced the cornflakes. I bakes them for 10 mind at 450. not as crispy as fried cheese sticks but not soggy either.
