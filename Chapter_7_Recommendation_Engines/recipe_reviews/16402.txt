To make this a 5 star, add an envelope of dry onion soup mix.  Try serving on plain mashed potatoes, I know that's two carbs, but is really good.

Although I did make adjustments to this recipe, I may have cooked it too long (10 hrs) for my crockpot. The edges along the sides of the pot started to burn. The flavor was good, though. I added a pkg of dry onion soup mix and a few dashes of Worchestershire sauce and did change the condensed soups to 2 of cream of chicken and 1 of cream of muchroom. Will make it again, but cook for 8 hours.

I added more flavor by subbing 1 can of the chx soup for 1 can of Cream of Chicken Soup w/Herbs(Campbells).  That helped kick up the flavor...also added couple dashes Worchestershire. This is so easy, delicious, comforting. You can add your own personal touches or as is...very versatile.  I served over noodles, a side of veggies & biscuits...GOOD!

This was TOO easy!  My husband and I loved it!  Will definitely make this often.  You can simply throw the ingrediants
together in the morning (taking all of two minutes to do so) and when you come home from work your house smells 
wonderful and dinner is almost ready!

Wasn't all that impressed. Needs something, I'm not quite sure what.  The meat turns out nice and tender but the flavor is kinda bland.

My whole family liked these beef and noodles.  I added 2 bay leaves, some sage, salt and pepper, a small can of mushrooms and some worcestershire sauce to the soup.  They turned out very rich and delicious.  I served them over mashed potatoes with a side of peas.  I'll be making these again!

This was a good, really easy recipe. I added a bit of Worteschire sauce and some garlic powder to the soup. Then I served it over egg noodles. I will certainly make this again when I know I won't have any time to make dinner!

My family loved this recipe! I took a bite and it reminded me of a recipe my great grandmother used to make called beef tips and noodles. It was easy to make and delicious! Thank you for sharing this recipe! I will make this again for sure.

I love this recipe..It is so easy, just put he soup and beef in the pot and it cooks itself. It is so delicious..it is probably my favorite recipe..I cook this at least once every two weeks. This is also one of my husbands favorite meals. sometimes I serve it over rice instead of egg noodles... Thank you Rita.

This is not a beef stew It's beef strogonoff.I made as written and found it to be very bland so next time I did 1 can mushroom 2 cans mushroom with roasted garlic and one package beef onion soup mix and I have to say that this really made a difference. Also don't cook the noodles in the sauce as this will make it way to thick. Try this adjustment and see for yourself.

Excellent recipe and very flexible. I used three pounds of our home-grown grass-finished beef, 1 (10.75 ounce) can of cream of mushroom soup a dried onion soup mixed with 2 cups of water. I also three in some dried mushrooms half way through. Delicious!

Very quick and easy.  I used 1 can of cream of chicken and 1 can of cream of mushroom and then added some onion powder to the stew meat.  It was quite tasty over macaroni noodles.  Was a perfect meal for a busy day.  :)  I will most likely be making this again in the future.

This is a really good simple recipe!  My whole family really liked it including a very picky 4 yr old.  I use the recomendations of other reviews.  I used 2 cans cream of chicken 1 can cream of mushroom added a few dashes of worcheshire and a little minced garlic.  I also added about 2 or 3 tablespoons of cream cheese about 30 min or so before serving.  It made it a little creamier and added more flavor.  Over all I will probably make this recipe frequently.

to me, this is a stoganoff. instead of cream of chicken- cream of mushroom, milk, onions, and sour cream at the end; not a bad recipe, though.

The title of this recipe should be "Beef Stroganoff" not beef stew. Very yummy recipe though. I added a packet of onion soup mix and it makes a very tasty meal.

I added diced potatoes, carrots, celery, onion, splash of Worchestershire sauce and about a tablespoon of minced garlic.  I set the crock pot on low and let it work its magic.  The end result (after only 6 hours) was very thin so I added one part cornstarch to one part icy cold water to thicken.  I ended up thickening too much, but the end result was still very tasty.  Would make again and possibly add more veggies.

Great recipe. My family loves it, including my very picky 11 year old son. I usually put in the egg noodles an hour before the end of cooking time, along with a can of frozen sliced carrots and a half a cup of frozen peas and it turns out amazing. 

I also season the beef with a lot of salt, pepper, rosemary and thyme at the beginning.

Simple and tasty. I added a packet of onion soup mix and a bay leaf, cooked iy for five hours alternating the high and low setting so it wouldn't burn. 

Delicious.

This was a very easy and quick recipe for me. I followed the advice of some of the other reviewers and used 2 cream of chicken and 1 cream of mushroom and a package of dry onion mix. I also had trouble with the sides burning, but the stew came out great! Next time I will add a can or two of sliced mushrooms or maybe some jarred wild mushrooms if I can get some.

Thanks for easy recipe.  Keep lid on crockpot beginners like myself! Its key to cooking right. I didnt have W- sauce but made no difference for us. I also used a few tsp minute tapioca to thicken sauce it makes plenty great sauce for dipping crusty bread in! I browned meat first also. Put Vegs on bottom, some Italian seasoning and liquid overall. It is creamy adjust season to taste. Thanks

OHmygoodness, OHmygoodness, you all made this sound soooo good, unfortunately it was so salty we couldn't eat it, my dog wouldn't eat it either...*heavy sigh*.  I added one pkg of onion soup mix as suggested, I think that's what made it awful.  Sorry :*(

So easy and so delicious!  I only gave it 4 stars, because I agree with others that it needs seasoning to make it 5 stars.  I added a packet of french onion soup mix and it was yummy.  I also added peas to it to make it a little more healthful.

This was a little bland, so I added 2 beef boullion cubes to add some flavor. Keep an eye on it, it tends to become too thin. Other than that, my family really enjoys this stew.

Made this with Elk meat instead of beef, and like many used two cans of cream of chicken and one can of cream of mushroom. Ended up quite tasty. Served over egg noodles with garlic peas and corn on the side, will definitely make again especially since it is so easy to prepare!

I wasn't really sure what to expect using cream of chicken as a base for beef stew, but it was really good.  The family was really surprised and enjoyed having something different from the traditional beef stew recipes.

Super easy, my very picky eaters loved it. Served it with rice as I didn't have egg noodles on hand. I did add a few things as suggested (garlic salt, pepper and Worcester)

Really liked this recipe! Followed some of the other reviews and it ended up giving it a lot of flavor! Instead of just the two cans of cream of chicken I also added a can of golden mushroom and an envelope of dry onion soup mix! And ended up cooking it on high for 4 hours as opposed to low for 8. Made a huge difference! The meat was super tender! I decided to toss it on some good ole white rice. So good! Paired it with some squash and zucchini. Good mix. Try it! It's definitely one of those recipes you can build off of and put your own spin on!

I took the advice of a few commenters. After adding beef to slow cooker I sprinkled pepper and worchestershire on it. Then added the dry onion soup mix and use cream of chicken with herbs for all three cans. Give the ingredients a gentle stir and set it for nine hours on low. When I came home the house smelled of beef stroganoff. Tasted very good, but still kinda reminded me of the hamburger helper version flavor wise. Will definitely use this again. ??

This was alright. Definitely needed spicing up. Did add the dry onion soup mix, Worchestershire, garlic powder and pepper. I found it too be very salty!! Perhaps the canned soup. Certainly easy to throw together!!
