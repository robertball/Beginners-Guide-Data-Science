Update!!! 3/9/17 These work in an airfryer. Add raw potatoes that have been cut into fries and soaked for 30 minutes. Cook at 190°C for 12 minutes; shake and cook for 5 more minutes. Then, using the baking pan attachment, add your toppings and cook at 190°C for another 8 minutes or until cheese has melted and browned. 2/24/15 The perfect pizza night solution for groups of people with different tastes and dietary needs. For years I have been looking for a gluten free pizza pulling my hair out trying to imitate real pizza crust wasting time, money and patience. And here it's been all along, right under my nose. I made these by putting the cooked potatoes in individual baking dishes, each family member dressed their pizza the way they wanted. To think, I have one kid who peels off the crusts and another who only eats "pizza e patatine", with this recipe everyone is happy!!  Thank you What's for Dinner Mom? for your flexible, crowd pleasing recipe. This is definitely going into the weekly rotation!

This is just an awesome way to have a different kind of 'loaded fries' and we LOVED, LOVED, LOVED them! If you are a fan of 'loaded fries' like we are, then you'll love them too! I didn't have quite enough mozzarella, so I used some cheddar too. I just topped these like I would any pizza...sauce, cheese, pepperoni, green onions, hot pepper rings and sliced black olives...the possibilities are endless!!! I used 'Exquisite Pizza Sauce' from here for the sauce and served some ranch on the side for dipping. This is one of those great little gems that you can't believe you didn't come up with yourself, lol. I served this as a main dinner w/ a nice big salad, and that was plenty for us! Hubby was definitely loving dinner tonight, lol. I can't wait to try different pizza combinations too. Thanks, WFDM, for an awesome 'loaded fry' recipe and a definite keeper~YUM! :)

What a hit these were with the kids and adults alike!  So adaptable to your personal preferences…I know next time we will try different toppings…load them up!  My teen age son thinks he is now a chef because he happily makes these for himself…. THANK you What's for dinner, mom?….

I made my own fries using the Best Baked French Fries recipe by Life Tastes Good here on Allrecipes.  In addition to the listed recipe ingredients, I topped the fries with  green pepper, onion, tomato, black olives and a small amount of browned ground chuck.  I liked the versatility of this recipe.  I have to admit this was my first time to eat pizza ingredients on fries instead of a crust.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, What’s for dinner, mom?  This was the Buzz Recipe Group Selection for February 21, 2015.

Recipe Group: DBF loooooved this recipe. Honestly pizza is not my favorite thing, but this really topped my expectations. I followed the directions on the bag of fries, which was less than 35 minutes. I didn't have pizza sauce so I improvised with spaghetti sauce and tomato paste. Next time I would make with the mini pepperoni, just for fun! Thanks for sharing this great recipe, WFDM :)

We loved these!  Of course, what's not to love, right?  Fries, cheese, pizza!  Yum!  I used Red Robin steak fries from the freezer section of my grocery store and they were the perfect size for holding up all those yummy toppings!  I added black olives and used the mini pepperoni.  I served these for dinner with some fresh pineapple.  Best dinner we've had all week!  Thanks for sharing, WFDM!!

5 stars all the way! I almost felt guilty for something so tasty being so ridiculously easy. Notice I said "almost". The possibilities are endless here and this is such a great way to put something hot on the table when you have a whole bunch of other things going on. It doesn't get any easier than this and who doesn't like pizza? AND FRIES? Thank you WFDM for sharing.

If you held a gun to my head and told me to pick between pizza and fries, I would tell you to pull the trigger. This is the best thing that has ever happened.

Recipe Group Selection:  21, February 2015 ~ A fun, different main course for dinner.  I made a half batch using an opened bag of steak fries.  Baked the fries first, and then put in individual serving bowls to finish them.  Topped them with the toppings listed and added onion and orange bell pepper.  I was out of mozzarella cheese, so I used a tomato bruschetta cheese.  We enjoyed this different treat for dinner.  Served it with cole slaw using 'Creamy Coleslaw Dressing' from AR.   Thanks Wfdm, for giving us another winning recipe!

Forget about the fuss of traditional pizza dough, or even cauliflower crust.. This potato fries pizza was so good and so easy. even though I made my own oven fries !
 I cut the recipe in half. After making the fries, I divided them among 4  individual casserole dishes and topped 3 of them with caramelized onions and mushrooms, black olives and sujuk sausage slices. The last one I only topped with sausage and extra cheese for my picky daughter. The children gobbled it up fast and said I should make this dish more often ..

I used steak fries but the whole thing turned out way, way too soggy.
