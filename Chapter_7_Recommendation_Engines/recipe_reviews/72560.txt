Excellent!  I followed the recipe as-is (except for the addition of a little bit of grated parmasian cheese), and the Bourekas turned out fantastically.  The cheese was perfectly melted, and the puff pastry was a yummy golden brown.  Great recipe.

This is a Syrian/Lebanese appetizer that's been around for as long as time!  Add black seed (aka black cumin seed)to the cheese mixture for a more authentic flavor.

A terrific side dish! I actually didn't end up using all the cheese called for. The seasonings are great and they bake beautifully. As the directions specify: serve immediately! No advance baking on these I'm afraid... UPDATE: some tips on keeping these closed... the less cheese you use, the less likely they are to open; use a fork to "seal" the edges; time is of the essence when working with puff pastry - don't let the dough dry out! Allow the dough to defrost to the point of being manageable but make sure it stays soft/moist. If you need to let it sit out longer than you expected, cover it with seran wrap to keep air out.

These were fantastic! I chose to make these for a school assignment, and I'm glad I did. The first time I made them, they were perfect. The second time, I messed up a bit, and they turned out dry (my fault though)

These are delicious.  I omitted the black pepper and sesame seeds.  Though not the same style of cuisine, I find these to be tasty when served with spaghetti in place of garlic toast.

My husband loved this but I wasn't crazy about it.  The pastry didn't cook all the way through and you couldn't taste and cheese or egg.

I liked these, as did my husband and grandparents, but I had a hard time making them. They pop open when baking and do not stay closed and cheese leaks everywhere. They were greasy too. My family liked them a lot though.

These were really good! I cut the recipe in half and they fit perfectly in my toaster oven.  I made these to serve along side a pasta dish.  They were really good dipped into some spaghetti sauce.  Very flaky on the outside and cheesy in the middle.  I left off the sesame seeds. Will make again!

This recipe is great! It's super easy to make, and the taste is heavenly.  I did add extra cheese, but it made them taste a little less authentic.  In the future I will just stick to the recipe as written, but they were so good I ate three right out of the oven all by myself.

I made these for my mom's birthday and my family loved them! I accidentally grabbed filo dough instead  of puff pastry at the grocery store and used that instead. It worked and tasted really good!

I would recommend making a lot of cheese mixture as it is really good. Puff pastry rises a lot and that can make it hard to eat as it is also flaky,  but very very delicious. Would recommend 10/10

These were delicious and surprisingly easy to make. I'm normally scared of any sort of pastry with filling, but these held together perfectly. Great recipe.
