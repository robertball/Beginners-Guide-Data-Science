I’m so pleased to have come across this untried recipe and be the first not only to review it, but to rate it highly.  This is a winner.  It’s rich, flavorful and colorful, not to mention just plain interesting.  A LOT more interesting, in fact, than the typical tomato-based Mexican rice.  I stayed true to the recipe save for the carrots, which I only omitted because I don’t care for them.  Saffron, the most expensive spice as I know of, has a unique and characteristic flavor and color  that really can’t be duplicated, tho’ turmeric would work as a more economical substitute.  I made this to accompany Slow Cooker Guisado Verde and Skillet Summer Squash, both recipes also from this site.  It was a beautiful and uncommonly delicious meal, in large part because of this beyond the ordinary Mexican rice.  Mamacita, no doubt, is a darn fine cook.  Thanks, Armi, for sharing her recipe.

Although a hit with my husband, this missed the mark on my account. :( If it weren't for the fact that I already had a jar of saffron handy, I probably would have skipped this one (saffron is VERY expensive!). Being that I'm on an "out of work" budget, I've been on the lookout for dishes that stretch a dollar (or two). Admittedly, for this reason alone, this was quite the disappointment for me. For one, NO WHERE does this recipe state what TYPE of saffron to use. Threads????? Powder???? If threads, how many??? After a CONSIDERABLE amount of time researching equivalents on the WWW, I decided that the measurement here MUST be for powder and that the proper amount would be approximately 5-7 threads per 1/4 teaspoon. Even after adding ~ 12 threads, my rice was not the beautiful golden color I expected (disappointment #2). All in all, this was "OK," but not something I'd make again. Thanks anyways, Armi. :-)

WOW this rice is delicious!  I subbed some Trader Joe's fire roasted corn for the carrots, due to what I had on hand, but otherwise followed the recipe verbatim.  The taste was incredible!  Went perfectly with my Adobo steak, onions & peppers, I can't wait to make it again!  Gracias Armi y Mamacita :)

EXCELLENT! I added the peas and carrots in w/ everything else, and used tumeric (Thanks, naples34102 for the idea!) in place of the saffron, b/c I didn't have any. Great flavor and super quick to make. I will def be using this recipe again and again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

I'm adding this review to explain to people about the saffron.  Mexican saffron sold in almost any store which carries Mexican products is very inexpensive.  It is sold in dry form in a small packet or in jars almost like a thick salsa to add to food.  I think in Spanish it is called "azafran".  Not the expensive, imported stuff.  This is a nice recipe.  You can add tomato paste or sauce in place of the tomato.  You can also omit the peas and carrots.

I made Mexican Rice III from AR to go with an easy green enchilada casserole I made.  It was okay but I was looking for a tastier option.  I did not care for the Mamcita's Rice at all. The flavors were too strong and did not have an authentic Mexican flavor at all. I used the turmeric as I didn't have the saffron (don't stock it due to the price). Will not make again.

Three & 1/2 stars if I could. This was okay, just not enough flavor. Next time I'll puree the tomatoes, add another clove of garlic & see if that helps a bit? It needs something more, I just can't decide what...It was very easy & I did like the texture though!

I threw everything into my rice cooker, and let it do its thing. Love my rice cooker!!!! Didn't need the vegetable oil, and I never add extra salt to anything.

Made as written and I just thought the rice was okay.... it didn't have a lot of flavor in my opinion.  I'm glad I tried it though and I thank you for sharing.

I've made this recipe a number of times to accompany fajitas and tacos. Like another reviewer, I also use Spanish saffron strands and the first time, filled the 1/2 tsp with strands. Don't do that; 5-7 strands is enough. IME, the results depend a lot on the chicken broth you use.

We really liked this recipe.  I have had problems finding a recipe for the dish as we like it, and this one just about nailed it.  I had to substitute for what I had on hand since I decided to make this last minute, but it turned out great.  I didn't have a tomato on hand (don't buy those out of season) so I used some pureed tomatoes and cut back on the broth just a bit to compensate for the additional liquid.  And I didn't have saffron on hand so I used a bit of adobo seasoning and some turmeric for color.  I used a very large clove of garlic, and I ommitted the cumin.  It takes very little of that for us, and the adobo seasoning had plenty for our tastes.  And lastly, I used basmati rice, again what I had on hand.  I will definitely make this again;  I don't need to look any further for recipes!  Thanks, Armi, to you and your MIL for the recipe!

Omg! My man who is Hispanic was really happy I found a Mexican rice recipe. Very very good. This doesn't even compare with restaurant rice. I didn't have chicken broth so I used Maggi. it still was really good. Will use the broth next time.

Delicioso! The reviewers that found this lacking in taste most likely did not add enough salt for their palate. Perfect rice by following the recipe :)

Followed this recipe exactly. I think it taste good. However, my kids were not too fond of it. I think I will omit the saffron next time.  And I will add tomato paste to give it some extra flavor.

The first time I made it, I followed the recipe completely. This time, I left out the peas and carrots (which my husband wasn't crazy about) and added chopped red and green pepper. Second time around, we still found it a little bland. Need to add more flavor somehow, just haven't figured out what it needs. But, it is definitely a keeper.  Perhaps I will use turmeric instead of saffron as others have suggested.

Used half an onion and diced tomatoes instead of fresh, because that is what I had on hand. A little too much saffron for my taste. I will make it again.

I used vegetable stock instead of chicken broth because my daughter is vegetarian. I didn't have saffron, so just left it out. The flavor would have been nice in it, but was still good without. I also used regular carrots cut in small pieces and added during cooking. Everything else was as the recipe stated. I will make again.

I didn't add the carrots, but I did add the some chopped cilantro just before serving along with some chopped fresh parsley.

A great start! This time I added leftover flank steak and a can of hatch chiles.  Last time it was chicken thighs with bell peppers.  I can see the cumin/garlic/saffron working with shrimp...

We really like this. We have made this with cooked rice as well. When we do that we simply use 1 1/2 tsp Better Than Bullion in place of broth, and 3 TB tomato sauce in place of chopped tomatoes. It's otherwise identical. But, doing it with cooked rice means we can make a weeks' worth of rice, plain, at the beginning of the week, and season it any way we like as we go.

Enjoyed the flavors.  I need to add a little spice for next time.  It was a little bland for our taste, yet the flavor was great.  I recommend this recipe with a little alteration for extra spice, if desired.

I was looking for a different rice to go with my Mexican food than a typical tomato based rice and this fit the bill.  The rice had great flavor, although, next time I will add a little more cumin.  Thanks for the recipe!

I am so happy I came across this recipe! It is exactly what I've been searching for. This is how our Mexican restaurants here in AZ serve their rice. I love the light and fluffy texture and the flavors are perfection! I only added the peas, as I have picky carrot eaters. Next time I will add the roasted corn as one reviewer suggested. I did a pinch of my Saffron and a bit of Turmeric as well. I did all the steps through the last boiling and then poured it into my rice cooker. Came out perfect! I will definitely be making this again! For all that have bought Spanish Saffron at the store and paid $20+ for it. You can find it on Amazon as well much less. 2 grams/free shipping $11.95, that's the same size I saw at the store for $22. A little goes a long way for an amazing flavor.

Really great Mexican rice! I've tried many, and this one is by far the best I've made. The flavors are just perfect, and one doesn't over-power the other, like with many Mexican rice recipes. We served this with our chicken enchiladas tonight, and everyone liked it. Will be making this one again!

This was excellent and easy!  However, with the saffron and peas, it did strike me as more Spanish than Mexican.  It reminded me a lot of paella.  I followed the recipe except for substituting vegetable broth for the chicken broth (I'm vegetarian).  I particularly liked the use of the fresh tomato.

This was a great dish to serve with any Mexican entree'.  It was extremely easy to make and the taste is guaranteed to be mild enough that everyone can eat it, even those who aren't lovers of Hispanic rice dishes.  The ONLY drawback it had was the use of saffron- while it tastes wonderful, it is an extremely expensive spice; many people will not want to invest that kind of money in a small side-dish.  That being said, the saffron is probably what "made" the dish.  I would certainly make it again., although I will definitely try to find some other spicing options to give it more taste and to make it less expensive.  Well done!

I think this recipe is wonderful! Prepares quickly and is delicious.  I didn't like the idea of peas in my rice, so I added fire roasted corn. Also, I didn't have saffron so I used  ground organic curry which consists  of turmeric, cumin, red pepper and onion. I also added a shake or two of plain cumin.  Plus, I didn't have any tomatoes, so I drained a can of diced ones and used half. The rice was a beautiful yellow and had fantastic flavor (I think the red pepper in the curry gave it a nice, spot on amount of heat!).

This was incredibly flavorful!  The carrots add just a hint of sweetness that sets this recipe apart.  I can see this becoming a staple in my home.  I did have the saffron and followed the recipe as written except to leave the peas out since the children I was cooking for do not like them.  They loved this rice though and both had second helpings.  Thank you, Armi and thank Mamacita!

Delicious recipe, but it defintely needs more water and to be cooked longer. I used vegetable broth, as we are vegetarians.

I served this dish with carne asada tacos and frijoles borrachos picante. I thought it was outstanding, although I did not include the Spanish saffron (expensive) and probably could have added more salt. I used fresh tomatoes from my garden, and I thought the peas and carrots were a nice touch. It was suggested to me that I should try using boullion for more flavor. This was my first attempt at Mexican rice, but I will certainly use this recipe again. Thank you, Armi!
