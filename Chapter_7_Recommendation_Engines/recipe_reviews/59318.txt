I have made this twice now.  First time exactly, second time made some minor changes.  Great either way, but I think I nailed it the second time.
-use red onion for color
-reduce sugar to 3/4 cup
-1/2 cup white vinegar, 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar
-add very thinly slices of 1 yellow or orange bell pepper for more added color/flavor
-add 1-2 tablespoons lightly toasted sesame seeds for added crunch

Yippeeeeeeeee! This is a very close copy to the Cole Slaw that is served at Primanti Brothers in Pittsburgh! I am so grateful to have found this recipe! I lived in "da Burgh" for 11 years and missed the slaw. I used 2 (16 oz.) bags of Tri Blend Slaw. Primanti Brothers only uses white cabbage, no carrots or red cabbage that you find in the tri blend. I cut the sugar back to 3/4 cup. Yea, this was a little watery but what slaw isn't? I just shook the tupperware bowl prior to serving and used a slotted spoon. Oh, you really need to make this the day PRIOR to eating; it really makes a difference in taste. This is so wonderful, I will be making and taking this everywhere. Not only is it delicious but you don't have to worry about mayonnaise going bad! Thanks for the post Christina!!!

This recipe is a true Amish recipe and is supposed to have lots of liquid, it enables you to keep the salad for 2 weeks, and contrary to the above reviews it does not need to be reduced, you serve it with a slotted spoon.

I have been making this slaw recipe for 50 years, with minor variations (dry instead of wet mustard) and slightly different directions. It is meant to be immersed in the marinade in the refrigerator and removed with a slotted spoon and drained in a mesh strainer before serving. It will keep from 4-6 weeks in its marinade in a cold part of the fridge (if it lasts that long). It does improve with age, becoming more of a condiment-like pickled cabbage than a slaw or salad. In my family it was the indispensible accompaniment to meals with barbecue pork and chicken and for pulled pork or chicken sandwiches. My recipe calls for sprinkling the cabbage and onion layers with 3/4 c. sugar, making a hot marinade (brought to a full boil) with 1/4 c. sugar, dry mustard, 1 c. organic apple cider vinegar, 2 teaspoons salt, 1 tablespoon of celery seed, and 3/4 c. oil, and then poured over the cabbage mixture, which is covered, and allowed to sit out till cools (about 2-3 hours). Then it is placed, with all of the liquid, in a very clean glass container with a tightly fitting glass lid, and stored in a very cold part of the fridge. Keeps for 4-6 weeks.

I've made this a few times and absolutely love the flavor.  I use a bag of pre-shredded cabbage/carrot mix and reduce the sugar and oil to 1/2 cup, the vinegar (red wine) to 2/3 cup.  Definitely gets better with 'age'.  At least a day or two is needed to bring out the best flavor.  But I love red wine vinegar.

Good, Tart and sweet!  This is a different type cole slaw with no mayo added.  Be careful to add sugar according to taste. Scaled to 4 servings, added grated carrots, cut sugar back by 1/3 cup instead of 1/2 cup, and used only a small amount of minced onion.  I was low on white vinegar, so I added apple cider vinegar (thanks to the input of the Exchange). Next time I will ONLY use 1/4 cup of sugar for 4 servings.

I've been looking for a good sweet/sour coleslaw recipe for a while and this one is it-- very yummy!  I used half brown sugar because we ran out of white.  I had 28 oz. of pre-shredded cabbage mix and there was way too much dressing and had to drain it off-- next time I'll add another 16 oz. bag.  I think the oil could also be cut back a little-- maybe 1/3-1/2 cup?  Finally, I used a genrous teaspoon of celery salt in place of the celery seed and salt.  Rave reviews!

Another excellent cole slaw recipe from allrecipes.com!  I don't understand why it is necessary to cook the dressing portion of this recipe--and after boiling, that portion of the recipe takes a long time to cool down.  Still, I followed the recipe exactly as written and it was great.  I did end up with more liquid than was necessary.  I added extra cabbage, but don't recommend that approach.  Adding more cabbage diluted and dispersed the wonderful flavor of the dressing.  Just leave it alone and use a slotted spoon to drain it as you go with each spoonful you take.

As suggested by another reviewer,  I cut back the oil in this recipe to 1/2 cup and it was just fine.  I also found that the recipe made way too much dressing for one medium cabbage - I had to pour quite a bit of the dressing off.  Next time I'll half the entire recipe for one medium cabbage.  Also added grated carrot and finely diced red onion for extra flavor and color.  Great sweet/sour slaw recipe!

super easy and a no-brainer when it comes to spoilage.  A light and refreshing alternative to the mayo/cream based slaw dressings.  Excellent slaw to take to a cookout or barbecue because there is no mayo in the dressing.

I am losing it and thought I rated this last year : )  Have made this at least 40 times since then!  This is the non-mayo slaw on our rotation and so delicious with BBQ or just plain old saltines. It is absolutely delicious and stays well in the frig, too. I use sweet onions (Videlias when in season)as well as picking out the red cabbage when using the pre-mix slaw packages to prevent it from turning purple. Red onions have the same affect so definitely use white or yellow.

This Amish Slaw recipe is terrific! My husband hates mayo and generally will not eat coleslaw because most recipes contain it but when I made it this way - he loved it! It does produce a lot of liquid so when I serve it, I strain it but reserve the liquid and if there is any left I put it back into the liquid and pop it back in the fridge because it will be great the next day or so. I cheat and use the pre-shredded cabbage called "coleslaw mix" because it saves time and contains white and purple cabbage which is more colorful. I also add in shredded carrot for more crunch and color. There is plenty of liquid to cover this addition so you could certainly up the amount of veggies without increasing the liquid portion. I am making this for a Memorial Day picnic per enthusiastic request. I always make it the day before because it gets better as it chills.

This slaw is outstanding!  I had so many compliments on it it was embarrassing!  I did cut the sugar down a bit.  Also I used the pre-shredded cabbage in a bag and the recipe dressed two packages perfectly. I can't wait to make this with BBQ.  This is a definite keeper!  Thanks.

This is just not "THE" cold slaw recipe I'm looking for.  Not bad, but not great either.  I should have cut the sugar by 1/2, we might have liked it better.

Great, simple recipe!  I was looking for a slaw that wasn't mayonnaise-based for a cookout, and this fit the bill.  I was a little unsure about the ingredients at first, but the flavor is an excellent sweet/sour blend.  I increased to 50 servings (6 heads of cabbage!) and didn't have any leftovers.  It does make a wet slaw, but per other reviewers suggestions, I served with a slotted spoon.  The wetness only increases the flavor and appeal of this slaw and also helps keep it fresh and crisp while it sits on the buffet table!

I used 2 (16 oz) bags of pre-shredded cabbage with grated carrots mixed in.  Reduced the oil to 1/2 cup per another reviewer's suggestion.  Next time I think I'll reduce the vinegar since it was a tad vinegary. I added dried cranberries (like the cole slaw I was served at a restaurant in New York). I think the cranberries enhanced it a lot - added color and flavor.

I have been searching for cole slaw without mayo for years. This recipes is perfect with a few changes. I used 1/2 cup sugar, 1/2 cup vinegar and 1/2 cup of oil and 3 small grated carrots. I also added extra celery seeds. My husband added a dash more vinegar to his. I liked mine per my changes.

Very good but I would definitely cut back on the sugar as well.  I didn't have time to let it sit over night so I threw the slaw in my Seal a Meal vacuum marinator (a great investment) and it was perfect in about 20 minutes.  I also did not cook the mixture either. This recipe is very close to one I make except with mine you throw in the seasoning and the noodles from a Roasted Chicken Ramen noodle pack and an Oriental flavor one; some sunflower seeds and slivered almonds.  Let it sit for an hour and voila!  I will definitely make this Amish slaw again though!

My Grandma gave me a recipe like this when I was young and just starting out. Only she chopped a green pepper, and shredded a carrot. And did use as much vinegar as sugar. As far as vinegar goes, she said pick one! I like to take this to summer gatherings, no need to worry about the mayo or miracle whip, refridgeration not needed. When I eat this slaw it take me back to family picnic's with grandma in the 60's, and her saying "It's good for ya!"

This is the kind of salad I adore. Fresh and light without heavy creamy sauces. Yes there was a lot of vinaigrette, but it kept the salad lovely and moist and I happen to love mopping up the juices with some crusty French bread! I did add some grated carrot for colour and thinly sliced the onion instead of chopping it, otherwise I followed the recipe as stated. Next time though, I will reduce the amount of sugar used by a third as it was a little on the sweet side. Perfect otherwise.

Excellent.  I used my food processor to grate the head of cabbage and it was effortless--definitely worth the cleanup of the machine.  Served with a slotted spaghetti spoon.

I made this recipe as written with the addition of a shredded carrot.  (I didn't mess with the proportions of oil & vinegar.)  It was really good!  I was looking for a vinegar-based slaw to re-create the Pittsburgh famous Primanti Brothers sandwiches and this recipe definitely worked.  Yum!

I really enjoyed the flavor of this recipe!  I used the preshredded cabbage (slaw in a bag!) and only had one, so I had to judge how much of the "sauce" to use, but didn't have a problem at all.  My husband liked it as well, but I ate almost the entire bowl!  Thanks for the recipe!

This is exactly what I've been looking for.  I'm from Pittsburgh and I hate the coleslaw with mayo but love the coleslaw at Primanti's.   This was as good, if not better than their's.  My husband agreed.  Thanks for the excellent recipe.  Now, instead of only getting to eat hot dogs at cookouts, I can make this in no time and take it with me.
Thanks a lot

Really good, very light.  I cut the sugar in half and it was still pretty sweet.  Next time I will probably double the mustard.

This is perfect for me as I do not like mayonnaise based coleslaws. I bought two bags of premade broccoli slaw mix and added this. It received many compliments!

Forget mayo based slaws! Even though I didn't have time to refrigerate overnight, it was still very good. I didn't use all the liquid, and used a combo of red wine vinegar and white vinegar.  This is definately a wet slaw, but excellent!  I will definitely be making this again.

Very good slaw recipe. I did only use 1/2 cup sugar just 'cz we try to limit our sugar intake whenever possible and I used half apple cider vinegar and half white vinegar. This is a very good recipe. I would recommend trying it for sure!

Took this to a football party and it was THE hit of the meal.  People were scrapping over it.  I'm still more a fan of the creamy slaws, but even I thought this was really good.  I did cut the vinegar and the oil by about 1/4 cup each as I was afraid of it being too wet/sour.  Sugar and other ingredients were just right.  Didn't get to refrigerate overnight, but even after just an hour or two it tasted woderful!  I'll give it 5 stars based on the reception it got!

This slaw recipe is delicious!  In my mind 1 medium head of cabbage would equal 2 16 oz. bags of the preshredded slaw mix, so that is what I used.  I followed the recipe (maybe used a touch less sugar) and did add finely chopped red onion.  It did not bleed as others mentioned.  It's the perfect slaw recipe for a picnic.  Yes, there was excess dressing in the bottom of the bowl, but cabbage does give off some liquid once it is dressed.  It happens with mayo based slaws too.  I just mixed it up well and used a slotted spoon to put it in my serving bowl.  I made this the day before serving and it was still nice and crunchy.  I will make this again.  EDIT 7/26/12 - I forgot to mention that I ended up using apple cider vinegar after debating with myself whether to use it or white vinegar.

I made this to use in Primanti's style sandwiches and it was perfect!  I used about 1/2 cup of sugar to toss the slaw and made the rest as the recipe specified.  It did make a lot of extra dressing but if you use a slotted spoon it shouldn't be a problem.  Delicious!

This is an EXCELLENT version of Real Amish Slaw!!! You won't be sorry you made it!!! Follow the recipe for the dressing tho...it DOES need all of that dressing to be authentic, and to last a little longer than a regular slaw would! Definitely 5 stars!!!

This is a great recipe, I've made it twice in the last two weeks. I was glad to find a really good slaw without mayo since my hubby doesn't put his lunch in the fridge at work. I altered the recipe by using 1/2 cups of sugar, vinegar & oil. I used red wine vinegar, which is pretty sweet by itself. I also added carrots, red bell pepper and Craisins. Make sure to refridgerate it overnight! Oh, and let the "sauce" cool completely before mixing or it will wilt the cabbage.

This slaw is awesome.  I also followed the suggestions, 3/4 c sugar, 1/3 c white vinegar, 1/3 c cider vinegar, and 1/2 c veg oil.  I also added 2 carrots shredded to the cabbage.  It was perfect! There will be extra liquid, just use a slotted spoon as others said.  I can't wait to get another cabbage in my CSA box.

This coleslaw was exactly what I was looking for, a vinegar/oil version other than the mayo type. It came out delicious, just like the one I usually buy at Wholefoods. I halved the amount of sugar and used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.

There used to be a BBQ restaurant here who served this type of slaw, but they went out of business.  I am SO GLAD to have this recipe, as it is JUST like theirs used to be.  (except I recall a small amount of diced green pepper in theirs, which I may try adding next time) I've only found this recipe a month ago, and I've already made it twice.  This time I used one of the HUGE bags of slaw mix from Sams Club, so I doubled the dressing.... used Splenda this time & its just as good as the time I used sugar.

Just excellent - so much more than the sum of its parts.  We use only 1/3 cup sugar, a combination of apple cider and red wine vinegar, and olive oil.  We also mix the hot dressing with the cabbage immediately, without waiting for it to cool, which seems to help wilt the raw vegetables down more quickly.

What a winner! I had to make it without the celery seed, so I can only rate it 4 stars. I used splenda instead of sugar, and used the recommendations to cut it back a bit. It is delicious! I also did not amrinate it over night, just a few hours before dinner so I can't wait to see how it tastes after marinating overnight. I jsut couldn't stop eating it.

Nice change from a mayo dressing, though a bit too sweet for my taste.  Second time I reduced sugar to 3/4 cup and added apple for more interest.

Great cole slaw.  I used a one lb. bag of cole slaw mix instead of chopping up the cabbage.  I also used 3/4 cup of sugar instead of 1 cup, as suggested in another review.

I made the recipe approx. 6 hours before I served it, instead of refrigerating overnight.  The flavor was still great, but I think it did taste better the next day.  Also, it was a little watery, so I probably could have used 1 1/2 bags of slaw.  I just poured the excess liquid away.

I love this.  I do not like traditional 'white' coleslaw, but love Primanti's!  I used 1 pkg of angel hair coleslaw and customized the recipe for 4.  I did add a couple of shakes of celery salt before serving because it wasn't quite salty enough for me.  Served with BBQ Pork For Sandwhiches and Baked Beans II also from this - website - put my slaw on my sandwhich -Awesome.

Very good, HOWEVER, the vinegar is sooooo strong. I didn't know if it was just me, but my family also told me it was too vinegar-y.  I'll try it one more time with half the vinegar.  I hope that works because the taste is great!

As a general rule, I hate coleslaw. It's just not my thing. However, I was serving pulled pork and it seemed wrong not to offer coleslaw along side it.  I hemmed and hawed through all the coleslaw recipes, settled on this one, and followed it exactly. IT'S AMAZING. Best. Coleslaw. Ever. PERFECT combo of sweet and sour.  Best part, no mayo.  Thanks for making me a coleslaw fan!

This is a great change from the traditional cole slaw made with mayonaise and it keeps for a long time in the fridge. I will try cutting back a bit on the oil next time as the flavor was very oily to me for the first couple of days but seemed to blend better by the end of day 2 or day 3. Make this one at least a day ahead of time and I think you will be happy with it. Went great with BBQ ribs & baked beans as part of a meal, as well as being a good sandwich topper for lunch the next time or just to eat a bowl by itself. Overall a great recipie.

This is an AWESOME slaw recipe. My wife really doesn't care much for mayonnaise, and once I reviewed this I thought it was worth a try. Everybody just loved it (including her 92-year old father!). This will become a standard in our household, I think. I didn't (and won't) change a single thing. 

Thanks so much for posting it!!

I know I've found the right recipe when my husband and son ask for seconds!  And they did!  I used 1 bag of packaged slaw mix and halved the ingredients.  Next time I am using 2 bags!  (Then I can have seconds too!)

I had two of my "foodie" friends ask me for the recipe for this. I have now made it several times, even adding sliced radishes and sliced raw rutabagas to the mix as I had an abundance in my garden. I used olive oil just because that was what I had on hand. It does keep much better than the mayo based slaws. Is in my favorites now.

I made this for a family gathering keeping in mind one of the guests who does not like mayo dressings.  This salad was a hit.  Everyone liked it and suggested it be one of our summer staples because it doesn't contain mayo.  It does have a lot of dressing, but that isn't a problem when served with a slotted spoon. I'm not sure how long it would keep, because it all went the day of our gathering.  I did refrigerate overnight.

Love this!  As suggested I cut oil to 1/2 cup.  I also cut the sugar in half and left it out of the dressing altogether.   I added a pear (because that's what I had) to make up for the sugar I left out.  Apples or raisins would also be great.  Just be sure to add plenty so that you have some fruit with every bite.  DH & 11 year old son also loved it.  We ate it right after I made it and there were no leftovers.  I'll bet it's even better the next day.

Needed to find a recipe w/o mayo for an outdoor June wedding in the mountains. Used 3 16 oz bags of slaw/carrots.  Store was out of broc slaw-but will use next time.  Added dried cranberries, pineapple tidbits, and crumbled bacon. Delish!

I didn't like the taste of the mustard in this slaw.  But I loved the fact that it didn't use mayo.  To cut the taste of mustard I added in about a tablespoon of balsamic vinegar.  Really made a difference for me.

It should be noted that a med. head of cabbage weighs about 3 pounds. Others have noted that the recipe makes a lot of dressing for the dish, but they were using pre-packaged shredded cabbage, usually sold in 1-pound bags. This may account for their excess dressing.  Also, cut cabbage does weep, so letting the dish season overnight will make it more watery. If you like it less watery, serve it immediately. It will also be crunchier.  I used a 3.5 lb. head, and cut the sugar back to 1/2 cup and it was very tasty. This dish got several thumbs up at the last potluck. I didn't care for that much onion taste and will try it with less next time, but overall, a great healthy make-ahead recipe to serve a crowd.

Very good.  I used a bagged slaw mix that contained red and green cabbage and carrots and added green onions.  I did not use celery seed as we don't like it.  I cut back a bit on the sugar and oil and used apple cider vinegar.  I added the sugar to the warm vinegar-oil mixture to dissolve.  I served it with smoked pork, and everyone enjoyed it.

Another "thumbs up" from a 'bugher ex pat.  Tastes just like cole slaw from south western PA!  Love it.  I would suggest either using 2 bags of the pre-shredded angel slaw or cutting down the dressing by half.  Thanks for sharing!

YUMMY! I grew up near Amish country in Ohio and this is the slaw I grew up on. After moving to the south about 17 years ago, I had a hard time adjusting to the heavy, mayo based slaw you get down here. This recipe is just like I remember, sweet and tangy, but I did add red cabbage and carrots for some color. This is the only slaw I am making from now on!

This is a fantastic slaw recipe. It has just the right sweet and sour taste to it. 

My husband dislikes mayo-based slaw so I made this for a picnic at the river and even he liked it.

I'm very picky about slaw and when I order it at a restaurant, I'm usually disappointed unless it tastes like Amish Slaw.

Other than finely chopping the cabbage in a food processor I followed the recipe to the "t."

Made this for Memorial Day. My hubby loved it 'cause it didn't have mayo. Even my mom liked it. It was kind of a last minute thing so there wasn't time to let it sit overnight. It still tasted great! Just 'cause I'm used to seeing carrots in cole slaw, I added 4 carrots. I also cut back on the sugar as previous posts suggested. Great recipe!!

this was really good.  I didn't add quite as much sugar and oil.  (1/2 cup of sugar and oil) and I substituted celery salt.  I let it sit for 3+ hours in the fridge and it was great.  This slaw was even better the next day-still crunchy and full of flavor.

Too sugary for me.  Way too sweet and way too many calorie for salad.  I will try again with about 1/2 the sugar if not less.

I LOVE this recipe! I have made it about 8 times, and every time I make it it tastes divine. I have gotten SO many compliments on this dish. It's my go to for pot-lucks, holidays and parties. I make it exactly as the recipe states, but I use half of the oil. I personally just don't like it too oily. So GOOD!!!

Love the no mayo recipe and the mustard brings a little extra zip to it!
I did cut the sugar and oil a bit and it was just fine.

My Russian husband loves this slaw. I sometimes add grated carrots. I also use caraway seeds since I don't stock celery seed in my pantry. I've messed around with the dressing - cutting the sugar and the oil. I found that my husband still likes it if I omit the sugar as called for in the first step. However, I do usually keep all the oil in the dressing or else it doesn't have the right quantity of dressing and its too acidic.

This is a great recipe when you want a slaw without mayo.  We've gotten so used to it, that I don't miss the mayo version.  Lighter, healthier and everyone loves it.  Have not messed with the recipe.  Is great as it is.

This is the best receipe. I have made this at least 5 times this summer and the same people keep asking me to bring it. I use a little less sugar as we like it tart. Sometimes I use extra veges to use them up. Can't miss with this one.

Yummy! Didn't have celery seed or white vinegar so I used caraway seeds and cider vinegar that I already had in the kitchen. I also added carrots to the Slaw.  Easy recipe! Used my Ninja food processor to help with the "shredding" and that sped the process up nicely

Made this for a graduation party, and everyone complemented me on it!  I used 1/2 the amount of sugar tossed with the cabbage, and used pre-shredded coleslaw mix.  The red cabbage bled, and the whole dish had a pretty pink color.

I made this for Easter the night before. I liked it alot.There was a lot left over because the kids just don't like slaw.A few days later we have some for lunch.WOW! This gets so much better after it sits a few days. We will be using this again but will make it and let sit about 3 days before serving. I also added a carrot for color and flavor.I think it might be good with a green pepper someday.

I was searching for a vinegar based slaw because it seems like all anyone ever makes is mayo based. I chose this because of the rating and I leave near a Mennonite community in middle Tennessee. The only thing I added to this recipe were carrots. Other than that, pretty good recipe. I may add a wee bit more vinegar for tang next round.

Delicious if you like a sweet, tangy slaw.  It would still be good if you reduce the sugar by 30-50%.

WOW. I'm eating this right now, three days after I made it. It's so good!!!! I did not have celery seed, and I didn't notice that there is supposed to be oil in the recipe until after I boiled everything (oops!). I drizzled some olive oil over everything to make up for that. Grab a slotted spoon & enjoy!!!

Gorgeous slaw and very versatile when it lasts so long - up to 2 wks in fridge.  I used half cup of sugar and also apple cider vinegar instead of the ordinary vinegar.  I also added thin slivers of red and yellow peppers and grated raw carrot - it made the most beautiful colourful dish.  I sprinkled the top with a few toasted almondsaned walnuts although totally optional.  Will def make again!

As written it's a 3, kick it up , Do not use oil, it makes it greasy. I add 1/2 cup grated carrots, leave off mustard  and only use 1/2 cup vinegar and 1/2 cup sugar.

This is very delicious, however I only gave it 4 stars because the amount of dressing is way to much - I only used 1/3 of the dressing and it covered the salad plenty. 

I also did not use celery seed or the mustard, as it's not available widely overseas. 

I replaced vegetable oil with olive oil to make it healthier.  I added some other vegetables in also for added crunch and colour (carrots, peppers, celery).

The dressing really is what made it, at least I have some left over for other salads, or another slaw. 

Thank you for sharing.

First I would like to say that I have made this three times... The first exactly as called for, including leaving it in the fridge overnight and it IS wonderful.  I made changes, but only because of MY personal preferences. I make the dressing as is (I used peanut oil), but instead of putting it on the salad I use it more like a salad dressing. I divvy up my prepackaged cabbage mix into 3's that way I can enjoy it for many days and I put the dressing on an hour before I eat it since I REALLY don't like it "soggy". Then I add extra purple cabbage and use red onion.   I definitely recommend trying this recipe if your in the mood for a fantastic slaw especially one without mayo.

So good and exactly what I was looking for.  I had some coleslaw from an Amish community once and thought it to be the best coleslaw I have ever had! This is definitely a keeper.  I used a bag of slaw, but didn't find straining the slaw to be too bothersome. Thanks!

I've been making this for years.  It's a great loaded into a pita with some sliced ham or all on its own!  (For those who find it too liquidy--I drain off excess juice prior to serving and it's a great marinade for pork or chicken.)

My significant other, who doesn't like mayo, loves this slaw. To make it lower in calories, I substitute half of the oil for vegetable broth which I thicken with just a touch of cornstarch. I also use Splenda for the sugar with great success!

Excellent recipe.  I've made it many many times now.  I use all the ingredients as stated with the exception of the 1 tsp sugar - there seems no point to it.  I put all the other ingredients except the cabbage in the saucepan and then pour it over the cabbage, mixing well.  A grated or finely chopped carrot is a nice addition for color and extra crunch.   Sometimes I'll use half Splenda and half white sugar. The salad keeps well in the fridge and that's why it's necessary to use the amount of dressing in the recipe.  As another reviewer stated, use a slotted spoon to serve the salad.

This was yummy. I cut way back on the sugar and used apple cider vinegar. I used shredded cole slaw mix, but next time I am going to use chunkier chopped cabbage.

Followed the receipe, but only used 2/3 cup of white sugar.  This is wonderful!  A great alternative to creamy cole slaw. It seems that I've been searching for a slaw like this almost forever.  Next time I'll use only 1/2 cup of sugar and see how it fits my taste buds.  Always follow a receipe the first time.

This is it!!! I had lost this recipe years ago, and I have found it again here!! Nothing needs to be changed, cut back, or tweaked, and it is so great for a make ahead dish for a party, and in this Texas heat, it is way better than a mayo based slaw. It's "soupy" for a reason, use a slotted spoon. duh.

Great!  My husband said it was the best coleslaw he's ever had and I would agree.  It took only minutes to make with a bag of pre-cut coleslaw mix with carrots.  I used red wine vinegar and olive oil.  Can't wait to try it after a day.  Thanks!

We have been searching for a vinegar based slaw recipe for a long time. We've had it at parties, but it was with delivered barbecue from various southern locations. No stores here in NYC sell it, and this was the first recipe online I found in the direction we were looking for. I used a bit less sugar and a bit more mustard and onions. It was awesome. Thank you.

This was great. We used red and green cabbage to give it some color. It's hard to judge how much shredded cabbage is in a head, but we served 15 people with a little leftover with about 3/4 head green cabbage, 1/2 head red cabbage and several carrots to one recipe of sauce. everyone loved it.

Tried this receipe out on a moving crew this weekend.  I made 2-16 oz bags of cabbage & they were asking for more!  Went over really big.  I did cut down the sugar to 2/3 cup & on vegetable oil split it in half using olive oil & vegetable oil.  Really a great receipe!

Like a few other reviewers here, I am a transplanted Pittsburgh-er who misses the wonderful taste of Primanti Brother sandwiches and I am busy trying to recreate those delicious sandwiches...this cole slaw is an  good reproduction of the no-mayo taste of the restaurants. I'm so pleased. I made some modifications, however. I used 1 10 oz. bag of shredded cabbage, halved the sugar, cut the vinegar down to 3/4 cup and the oil down a little as well. Still plenty watery (as the recipe is meant to be)..the only complaint I have is that boiling vinegar leaves a HORRIBLE smell in the air--my two dogs were quite upset with me!

This is exactly like the slaw I ate as a child in Pennsylvania Dutch country.  I used 1/2 cup oil, 3/4 vinegar, and 2/3 cup sugar--maybe I'll use a little less sugar next time, but this was excellent.  Very like what you'd get in an Amish restaurant.

I love this recipe and have used it several times.  For those talking about it being too sweet, I once forgot to toss the cabbage in the sugar, instead just putting the sugar in the dressing.  It was wonderful, albeit tangy, that way too.  I'm a fan of vinegar and tangy flavors, so that might not work for everyone.

This recipe is delicious if you like a light fresh-tasting non-mayonnaise cole slaw.  I substituted Splenda for the sugar and cut it by about a third.  I'll cut it by half next time because it still seemed a little sweet to me.  Also, I only used about 2/3 of the dressing.

This is a tasty mayo-less slaw! I use one bag of pre=chopped slaw mix (green and red cabbage with carrots) and cut the sauce mix in half - and only use 1/4 cup of oil. Last time I made it, I used red onions and it added a nice flavor.

Amazing. Simple and cheap. I.m from the midwest where creamy slaw is king but I decided to make this for some bbq brisket sandwiches and I don't i'll ever need to make another kind. 1/2 white and 1/2 red wine vinegar was the only change I made. Perfect

I followed this recipe exactly as far as the ingredients go, but used green and red cabbage. I also added shredded carrots for more color.  It was beautiful!  I've never made coleslaw without the creamy sauce so I was skeptical about how this was going to taste. Boy was I pleasantly surprised!! This tastes amazing!! All my guests loved it! This will be the only slaw I will ever make again!

Loved this vinegar based coleslaw.  My husband is not a fan of mayonnaise based slaw recipes so I am always looking for a good one with a vinegar base.  This is just the right amount of sweetness and tartness.  It also keeps for a long time.  Make at least a day ahead of time to let the flavors mix together.

I halved the sugar and this was still very sweet; the vinegar was also pretty strong. I added a cup of mayo as well to round it out.

At first I thought this was fantastic but a bit too sweet and oily. The next time I made it I only used 1/2 of the sugar and a little less than 1/2 cup of oil, doubled the mustard AND I found the taste lacking!! Next time I'm going back to the original recipe with no regrets!

I have made this on several occasions and I'm very pleased.  My husband refuses to eat mayonnaise or anything associated with it so I had to find a vinegar alternative.  Only changes were that I used a couple of packages of the store bought cole slaw mix to save time and left out celery seeds.  Like others said, this slaw has a lot of liquid, but also keeps well and tastes even better the next couple of days, in my opinion.  Great alternative to mayonnaise versions.

I used two packages of preshredded coleslaw mix and left out the onion (personal preference)  Scaled down the oil to 1/2 cup.  Really nice slaw to serve with BBQ.

Excellent.  I have made this recipe several times and my family loves it more and more.  At the request of my husband, I cut down on the amount of onions in the recipe, but my son said that left out some of the flavor.  Go figure.  A red onion is definitely recommended, as it's sweet and does add zest.  And -- I did follow the advice of another submitter and split the vinegar to 1/2  cup apple cider and 1/2 cup white vinegar -- makes a tremendously positive difference.  A great slaw that gets better with age and keeps for days in the fridge.

Excellent slaw - I made a few changes due to personal preference. I used 1/3 cup sugar instead of a whole cup and the slaw was plenty sweet and savory. A whole cup would have been entirely too much. Also, the recipe called for a prepared mustard - I chose Inglehoffer stone ground mustard and used 1 1/2 tablespoons as opposed to 1 tsp. This is now my "go to" slaw recipe!

After years of trying other mayo based slaw recipes I tried the Amish Slaw recipe.  I have made it twice, the second time cutting the sugar in half.  I did not taste any substantial change but feel much better with the healthy recipe adjustment.  LOVE this recipe.

I used 1/2 cup sugar, 1/2 cup vinegar and 2 TBL oil, plus salt and pepper.  Just whisked them together and poured over a pre-shredded cabbage mix.  Very good, it has a sweet tangy flavor.  We love it!

I made 2 different cole slaws for a fish fry we had last Sunday, this one and the normal Marzetti Slaw Dressing style.  Boy have I been missing the boat.  This was fabulous!!  I'm mixing up a batch for 24 as we speak and taking it to Lake Erie this weekend to go with MORE fish.  THANKS SO MUCH!!

I made this on a Friday, to serve at a Sunday night BBQ.  I'm so glad that it was something that I could prepare ahead of time, and get out of the way so I could concentrate on the rest of the meal.  Everyone really enjoyed this slaw.  Our guests asked for the recipe, and it made quite a bit (there were 8 of us, and I had enough left over for another meal for my family of 4 AND to send out guests home with some as well).   I did add some shredded carrots, for color.  Nice recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

I thought this was great. So easy to make and delicious. It is was good as a side and added good taste and crunch to my corned beef/ roast beef sandwiches. Stick to the recipe and you won't be sorry. I plan on making this for BBQ outings this summer and being mayo-less takes the worry out. Thanks Christina.

I really loved this!  I was looking for a non-mayo cole slaw recipe and this was perfect.  However, I used only 1/2 cup of sugar because I don't like it too sweet.  And I added thinly sliced red peppers, onion and celery.  LOOOVE!!

Was looking for a non-mayo coleslaw to use on pulled pork sandwiches.  Very good - does last a while in the fridge.  Makes a ton - last night, I used half a head of cabbage - had already made the sauce, so used all of it.  Fed 8 adults as a side/sandwich topper.  Got lots of compliments on this!

This my go to recipe for coleslaw. We are not big fans of the mayonnaise based version and this is refreshing alternative. I scaled back on the sugar (more like 3/4 cup) and added a little extra mustard. Delicious!

I don't like mayo based coleslaws, so this is a great alternative. I reduced the sugar to make it a bit more savory and less sugary. I also add shredded carrot.

This was fantastic!  I cut the sugar back to 1/2 cup, used apple cider vinegar, and used celery salt (I didn't have celery seed, so used the salt instead and omitted the regular salt.  I also chopped up 6 steips of bacon and added it - gave it a tasty savory component!

If there's any 2 side dishes I love to eat, it's cole slaw and potato salad.  Well, I found the slaw recipe I'll be making from now on!  Made this with a few of the suggestions from other reviews - cut down the vinegar and then used half white and half apple cider plus a couple other changes.  Absolutely fantastic!

I made this this evening and it was good after marinating for only a couple of hours. I imagine it will be even better in the morning. A very nice change from my usual creamy dressing.

Excellent!!!  I took the advice of others and used bags of prepared slaw and made one day ahead for flavors to blend.  Wonderful change of pace.  And, great for picnics or potlucks since there is no mayonnaise.  Thank you, Christina J!!

Excellent! I added shredded carrots and red cabbage. We ate the slaw right away for the great crunch. Good the next few days too!

One of my favorite foods!  I love this slaw.  I follow the recipe exactly, sticking with a nice sweet Vidalia onion and a regular old cabbage.  It's fun to set the pretty white/green dish on the table.  In itself it isn't so dazzling, but when put on a plate next to some mixed roasted veggies and a nice bratwurst, it looks and tastes oh-so-wonderful.

I've made this recipe twice; it tastes great, but I'm only giving it four stars because it makes too much dressing. The second time I made it, I also shredded a couple of carrots and two red bell peppers to balance the amount of dressing versus the vegetables. I'll be making it again, though.

I made this two days before serving it for dinner. I was worried that the cabbage would be soggy from sitting so long, but found it was still crunchy days later! Plus, all of my friends couldn't get enough. I'm not a big fan of mayonnaise based cole slaw so this is a wonderful substitute.

Very good! And better the next day. My husband loved it, even more then his traditional cole slaw w/mayo. This is the kind of slaw my mother/grandmother made, being from north carolina. I used slightly less sugar, but followed everything else the same. Used a combo of purple and green cabbage and white vinegar. I think using the amount of sugar it asks for, is just fine too! If something already tastes great as is, why mess with it!

I make this slaw a LOT and like many cut back on the sugar. I use 1/2 cup sugar and 3/4 cup vinegar (white or cider). This slaw is FANTASTIC on pulled pork sandwiches! Add a little ketchup (or not) and it's also very good on a hot dog! YUMMO!This stuff disappears quickly at our house!

The only change to the recipe was,I used Dole Slaw mix instead of the head of cabbage. My Neighbors went nuts over this.
It is good on fish sandwiches.

This was just what I was looking for in a slaw recipe.  My college boyfriend's stepfather (from North Carolina, 10 years ago) made an incredible good, tart slaw that I adored but could never quite get right.  I saw this and knew it had to be close.  I eased up a little on the sugar and let the finished product sit over night and it was excellent.  (Doubly good when served on top of pulled pork as a sandwich.)  Thank you so much for sharing!

I LOVE this recipe!! I cut back a little bit on the sugar, and actually combined all the ingredients in a saucepan and brought to a boil, let it cool and poured over the shredded cabbage; it worked just as well. I have also used a slaw mix that included shredded carrots. I have taken this slaw to work dinners a couple of times now and it never lasts long.

As others suggested I reduced sugar and oil to half and used green onions. At the end I had to add more vinager and sugar to make it more sweet and sour as we like it. General good rec.

This was fantastic.  I love creamy coleslaw, but years ago I had what someone called "German coleslaw" and I loved the flavor, so when I saw this recipe, I had to try it.  I love the fact that it's a nice, simple recipe. I was a little nervous when I saw how much sugar and oil it called for, but I followed the recipe exactly, and you know what?  It works!  In fact, this tastes even better after the third day in the fridge than it does after the first day!

Not bad...a nice sweet and sour thing going on.  I never cared for mayo based slaw and this is a perfect alternative. Apparently the Amish have more going for them than just those cool hats.

A different coleslaw for me.  My husband really liked it.  Nice for a change.  I did use a slotted spoon to serve because it is very wet, but I read the reviews and that is the style.  Thanks for the recipe.

A lovely lady at church made this slaw frequently. But she would not share the recipe. I didn’t know what was in it other than cabbage. I looked off & on for a recipe that could be what she used. When I was throwing a brunch baby shower for my daughter I decided to find it no matter how long it took. With in a hour of concentrated searching I found this recipe. It looked exactly like Mrs. N’s slaw. I made it. It was perfect!!!  The slaw was a huge hit.

I have made this several times for our family and we absolutely love it. With our kids off to college my wife and I found it  to much  and we would end up eventually throwing it away. So we used a shortcut. We bought a bag of the shredded cabbage with carrots and red cabbage at the store added half an onion then followed the recipe exactly cutting the amount of everything in half. (1/2 tsp instead of 1 tsp etc.)  It worked fantastic! we have the same great slaw without as much leftover and definitely a lot less chopping

This recipe was awesome. I used it as a side dish for smoked pulled pork and it was the right amount of acidic, sweet crunch to offset the rich smokey pork.  The only change I made was to add shredded carrot, not much only 2 carrots. 
 I will definitely make this again.

I rate this recipe  5 stars based on when I first made it as written.  Upon making this again, I adjusted the amounts and cooking of the ingredients, just to try it out.  For my taste, I really think the adjustments work very well.  First, make dressing the day BEFORE you plan on serving the slaw.  Second, HALVE the dry ingredients EXCEPT for the celery salt (all I had).  Third, use  2/3 cup of vinegar (mixed ACV and white vinegar).  Fourth, used in between 1/4 and 1/3 cup of veg oil.  Fifth, I added more prepared mustard upon tasting (personal preference).  I cooked the dressing BY ITSELF, NO VEG and let it cool, then refrigerated the dressing overnight.  Used a 16oz bag of pre-cut slaw mix.  Dressed the slaw the afternoon before I served it for dinner.  Either way, this is my favorite cole slaw ever!

I've been trying to elimate mayonaise from a lot if foods. But this was the first Cole Slaw reciepe I've found that actuall tastes good.  It gets better after a couple of days, unlike  cole slaw with Mayonaise.

I make this for office parties and barbeques.  It's wonderful on a sandwich or as a salad and on concerns of spoilage if left sitting out for a while.  I keep a bowl in my fridge and add more cabbage to it and eat it all week.

This is the best slaw I’ve ever made/eaten!
It isn’t as healthy as I had hoped, although I followed the advice of one of the reviewers and cut the sugar and vinegar down. My next batch I will substitute the Canola oil for Avocado Oil and the sugar for Monkfruit Classic sugar. Thank you for sharing this recipe. I’ve always had great luck with recipes on this site.

Brought this to a 4th of July picnic.  Everyone loved it, and happy to have a slaw that was not mayonnaise based. Served leftovers 2 days later, one friend is a chef and he said it was excellent!. Only change I made was using celery salt, leaving out salt, as I didn't have celery seed.  Will make again

Very yummy and so simple!  I let the slaw set for an hour before putting it in the refridgerator.  Also, I used red wine vinegar.  As others have said, there is lots of dressing.  I just tossed the cabbage a lot and then transferred to another container with a slotted spoon.  The recipie has a lot of onion.  I recommend reserving some cabbage (get a larger head) and add cabbage a the end with mixiing until you get the onion/cabbage ratio you want.

Excellent slaw. Besides a side dish, we also used it on pulled pork. Defiantly  use red onions for color.

I made this for my daughter's activities banquet.  It is always a risk to take slaw and a new recipe to a group event, but don't be scared of this one.  It has a great flavor and I came home with very little left. (There was bunches of food).  I will add this to my file to make again.

I’m giving this 5 stars simply for the idea and the marinade recipe. I say this because just cabbage and onions wouldn’t be too appealing so I added carrots, cucumbers and yellow bell peppers. I only reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup and left the other liquids the same. I served it with tongs, because I know better than to complain about the amount of liquid realizing there’s a reason for it. Marinades are supposed to have a lot of liquid. I reserved the remaining liquid for another batch. I appreciate this recipe and hope you receive more positive reviews from people who understand cooking.

This was great but I did make some changes, hence the 4 stars instead of 5. I mixed green and purple cabbage, for colour. I used half the sugar, partially because I don't like things too sweet, but also because I used white balsamic  vinegar which is slightly sweeter as well. I used 1/2 cup of olive oil instead of the 3/4 cup. And I didn't have celery seed so I used 1 1/2 tsp celery salt instead of the celery seed and the salt  called for.

Excellent recipe for authentic “sweet and sour” slaw.  I halved the sugar and vinegar, and it came out great.  I used 1/4 cup of vegetable oil.  Great side any time of year!

I followed suggestions to reduce sugar to 3/4 cup (it was enough), add toasted sesame seeds for crunch (I like different textures) and split vinegar in hand using white and cider vinegar. Everyone loved it!

I have made this recipe several times, exactly as written, but using 2 bags of coarsely grated cabbage. It is delicious and everyone loves it, young and old. There is a lot of liquid, so serving with a slotted spoon is a simple solution. Sometimes I use the leftover liquid to create a second batch, saving time and money!

Did not use all of the sugar, about 1/2 cup.  Also used apple cider vinegar and instead of onions, added dehydrated onion flakes to the oil and vinegar and let it soak a few minutes before tossing with the slaw.  It was very tangy!

Disappointed. Flavor is o.k., but way too much liquid! I checked recipe over again, to see if I had measured wrong, but I followed it closely. I did use Splenda instead of sugar, which usually works the same as sugar, so maybe this was the problem,

Delicious. Nom nom nom.  Super easy, inexpensive and I love it. I have a great creamy coleslaw dish that I love, so now I’ll have to alternate. It’s just that tasty.

I made it as written - with the substitution of Stevia for sugar. My husband and I have loved the acidity of it. There was a lot of liquid - so when we had eaten most of the cabbage, I simply added more cabbage to the bowl! Just as good as the first bunch!

I followed the recipe almost exactly, except I added two medium carrots cut into short match sticks. I used apple cider vinegar and safflower oil. I also cut the sugar down by about one-third, as was recommended by other reviewers. I let it sit in the fridge for about eight hours before I tasted it. I was so pleased with the results! Fairly easy to make and so delicious! Will enjoy this slaw again and again.

I was looking for a sweet slaw to go with pulled pork as well as any grilled foods. This is, by far, my families favorite!!! I first made it true to recipe and it was awesome. I have also reduced the amount of sugar on occasion, but not others, just depends on what it will be accompanying. We will be handing this recipe down for years to come.

To be fair, I did make some minor changes to this recipe before I made it.  I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup and I used apple cider vinegar instead of white vinegar.  It came out ok but it was still too sweet for me. I would recommend using equal parts vinegar and oil and cut the sugar down to 1 or 2 tbsp. Of course, that would make this a totally different recipe so if you don’t care for a sweet slaw, I’d look elsewhere. If you’re into sweet slaw you should like this but I’d still cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup.

Very good vinegar-based cole slaw.  I used bagged cole slaw.  Based on other reviews, I cut the sugar down to 3/4 cup and used 1/2 cup white vinegar and 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar.  I also added toasted sesame seeds and may used toasted almonds next time.  This will be my go-to vinegar-based cole slaw recipe from now on.

Very good; better after 24+ hours ... keeps for several days and compliments many dishes (bean soup, fish, BBQ).  We make often just to have on hand.

I made this for a football party at our house. Big hit! I did add 2 jalapeño peppers and 1 hot Caribbean pepper, we like it hot. Other than that didn't change anything else. I was told I would be making this again! lol

I added some zucchini, carrot, red pepper and cucumber to this slaw.  And also some yellow cherry tomatoes cut in half. Everyone loved it! I did decrease the sugar to 2/3 cups, and it was sweet enough for us.

This is wonderful. My husband always liked vinegar-based coleslaw while I preferred using Miracle Whip or some sort of mayonnaise-based dressing. Interestingly enough, this recipe makes both of us happy. 

Yes, it is runny but in reading the reviews, it seems that is exactly how it is supposed to be and in fact is one of the reasons it can be kept for a few weeks. That suits me just fine as we are empty-nesters. At the same time, I can also use this if I need to bring a dish to share or I am serving a crowd. Perfect!

The only substitution I made was a 10-ounce bag of broccoli slaw for the cabbage; otherwise I made the recipe exactly as written, refrigerating the slaw overnight as suggested. This cole slaw was delicious: slightly sweet with layers of lovely flavors including a bit of tang and just a hint of celery seed in the background. My hubby and I both loved it and I will definitely be making it again.

Delishous!  I substituted a cup of mayonnaise made with olive oil in place of oil, did not use mustard, added small celery stalk minced and did not cook ingredients just mixed together thoroughly.  Everyone loved it.

My son loves this recipe so I make it often. When using pre-cut slaw mix I cut the recipe in half and still have enough dressing.

This coleslaw makes my heart happy!  I love vinegar based anything and this hits the spot.  Growing up in Amish country PA I love anything from that region.  Great Recipe!

Very nice!  Followed the recipe to a "T" and is delicious!  I wasn't sure what I would think of the dressing, but it is very good.  I didn't get to refrigerate overnight, but there was enough left over for me to take for lunch tomorrow so I'll get to see if there is a difference in flavor.

I followed the recipe as written. It is the best coleslaw I have ever made. Everyone wants the recipe. Sometime I reduce the amount of sugar.

This is what I was looking for!  I used 1 bag of Cole slaw mix, and then halved the rest of the recipe and it worked out fine.   I used Splenda instead of sugar. I might cut back a bit on the oil next time and see if it tastes as good.

The recipe as is gets 4 stars. I used 1/2 cup of sugar and that was a 5 star combination! I also recommend using red onion. I make the sauce the night before, put it in the fridge and pour everything over the salad about 2 hours before I serve it. I also used just a plain coleslaw bag mix- so easy and so delicious!

Based on the Primanti Bros review, I decided this was just what I was looking for! I used two bags of tri-color slaw mix. I used half white vinegar and half apple cider vinegar, and I cut the sugar to 3/4 cup as suggested. I followed all other instructions as written. This is perfect! We used it with Hawaiian sweet rolls on BBQ pulled pork sandwiches and on corned beef and melted muenster sandwiches (put it between the cheese and meat so the toasted rolls don't get soggy).

Great simple recipe!  Made as a side for a "Hot Diggity Dog" day at work. It was a great addition to the Sabrett hot dogs or as a side item. The Vegans of the group LOVED it on there veggie dogs. I doubled the dressing using two bags of packaged slaw which had red cabbage.  After marinating overnight the slaw turned a slight pink but my coworkers didn't mind...they thought it tasted great. It definitely had a lot of dressing so I drained some of it before serving. The only thing I would try differently is to see how it is with a little less oil.

This is one of those elegantly simple and patently fresh, light, and tasty sides. You can vary in an endless number of ways.

A mandoline or food processor goes a long way in prep but isn't necessary.

I have added in shredded carrot, red pepper, pickled ginger, 2 tbsp ofsesame oil and a shot of sriracha for an Asian flair.

I serve this with barbecue and have gotten comments every single time. Slaw is easy to make, and nothing like the tub of mayonnaise and mascerated veggies you buy at the market.

Definitely try it.

I didn't think  I was going to like this recipe because there is too much sugar in my opinion. However, I had all the ingredients except the prepared mustard on hand and decided to give it a try. I substituted the prepared mustard with an equal portion of dry yellow mustard powder. It was surprisingly delicious and refreshing! Five days later it's tasting even better( it's a lot
Of slaw for only two people)! I will definitely keep this recipe on hand for summer barbecues. Much better than any mayo based slaw I've made before. Ps: as another reviewer said, use a slotted spoon to serve.

I don't know why I don't make slaw more often, but I will be making it more now. This was very good. I thought of it too late to let it sit over night so we ate it after just about 3 hours and it was really good. We'll have the rest tomorrow so I'll be able to tell if it's better after sitting over night. It was awesome tonight. I used Splenda since we are dieting, and also used cider vinegar. Wouldn't change a thing. Thanks for the great recipe.

I made this twice.  First, the only change I did was use 1/2 cup sugar.  The second time I did I used 1/2 cup sugar , 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar  and 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil for a little more healthier and still came out good.

I chose to use less sugat. All the sugar I used went in the dressing mix,(only about 1/2 cup).   I had a problem with pouring raw sugar on top of raw vegetables.  I also used seasoned salt instead of regular salt, onion powder in the dressing instead of minced onion in the vegetable mix, and some added paprika and fresh ground black pepper for extra flavor. A combination of canola and olive oils  imparts more flavor also.
It's already delicious and it hasn't even set 10 minutes.

Very good recipe.   Almost identical to my German Grandmothers recipe.  Since the Amish descended from Switzerland it is not surprising they are similar.  The longer it sets in the fridge, the better the flavours!

I just made this recipe and WOW!  Everyone loved it, wish I would have made a double batch.  I did use apple cider vinegar because I did not have any white vinegar on hand.  And I omitted the celery seed for the same reason, had none on hand.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe and it was great!!!  I am not a big fan of coleslaw with mayo so this is perfect.  As someone stated in an earlier review, it does remind me of Primanti Brothers coleslaw ( a Pittsburgh, PA original restaurant) which I love.  I will definitely be making this again!  Thank you Christina for submitting this recipe.

If you have a microwave oven, you can speed up prep by simply microwaving the oil, vinegar, celery salt, mustard and onion slices (I used red onion for mildness) in a bowl on high 1 minute.  Then pour it over the sliced cabbage.  Also, I added matchstick-sliced carrots, chopped parsley and a bit of dill I'd just pulled from the garden.  
I cut the recipe in half for the 4 of us, only used 1 Tablespoon of sugar (total), and used a few good shakes of celery salt instead of salt and celery seeds (which I didn't have).  
Super good!  My husband, I, and both kids liked it.

I took this slaw to a large wedding dinner and the crowd loved it.   No need to overthink it.  Amish Ladies know what they are doing.  This recipe is fantastic .  Use a slotted spoon for serving.  Thanks Christina J.

really good- I don't care for lots of mayo so this hit the spot. It does keep really well and like others said you drain what you want to serve. Great to put on pulled pork sandwiches !

Excellent. Lasts forever. I add carrot and bell pepper. Might try adding some apple also.
I used mustard seed instead of prepared mustard.

This was easy and delicious.  I used half as much sugar and it was perfect.  I will definitely make this again.

I've been looking for this recipe for over 30 years! There was a restaurant in Pittsford, NY where a scrumptious sweet coleslaw (without mayo) was made that I just loved. We moved away in 1983--hence, the 30+ year search. Following some other reviewers' suggestions, I used half white vinegar and half apple cider vinegar, added some thinly sliced yellow bell pepper, and used a red onion for color. Perfect!!

It has a much stronger vinegar tang than our regular coleslaw, which is nice for a change.

This was quite good. I did follow recommendations of a few reviewers. I used 3/4 cup sugar in the slaw (I used a bag mix) and I used 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup vinegar ~ I mixed white wine and regular vinegar ~ in the boiled mixture. I only let it sit for about 2.5 hours and it was still quite good. There is a LOT of juice, so I could probably have used 2 bags of the slaw mix. I'm not sure why this had to be boiled, but I did. Good for a change up from mayo slaw which we also love!!

This recipe is great to have in the refrigerator for a between-meal snack.  Also, I'll be using it as a side dish with a light BBQ such as chicken and fish.

Very easy and superb tangy flavor.  Made for 6 adults at bbq who all loved it, maybe had 1c leftover. We eat very healthy so I cut back oil to 1-2T but u can omit. Doesn't really add to flavor imho, no nutritional benefit either. Cut sugar in half (altho i only used 1/3c) and bump up mustard to 1T.  I added red bell pepper and cukes from our garden for color. Definitely prefer half cider vinegar and half white vinegar but if u do not have it, don't worry. Next day,  I sliced up leftover steak and slaw and made 1 sandwich for husband and tossed over fresh corn and lettuce for me. I used liquid for dressing and it was awesome. It is a summer staple!!!

I grew up in Eastern Pennsylvania, not far from Amish country and this tastes very much like what they called "pickled cabbage" in the high school lunch room. I don't remember it having oil added but it definitely had the sweet and sour to it, plus the celery seeds. I didn't boil the sugar mixture down and let it cool, I just tossed everything into the bowl, over the 1 package tri color shredded cabbage mix and gave it a good toss. Something that you can keep adding shredded cabbage to it as long as it keeps.  I can see where the Amish would devised this recipe: no electricity,  no refrigeration.  But they do have cold cellars and ice boxes! ;-)

This is a fun recipe.  Nice change from trad'l slaw.  I tweaked a little...1/2 c sugar, 3/4 c vinegar, used ACV as well as white (50/50) and 1/2 c. oil.  Added 1/2 of a medium sized red onion and 3/4 of a green pepper.  Love it.

I absolutely love this slaw. I use the pre-shredded cabbage mix and omit the onion (because my husband doesn't like them). I was a little nervous at the amount of liquid but not to worry! It just keeps marinating what's left over and over again! It's a huge hit everywhere I've taken it. So nice to not worry about keeping it cold at outside gatherings (although I like it better cold). Favorite slaw recipe of all time!

I had to choose a rating, but, truthfully, I haven't tried this recipe yet but would like to protest the fact that, as in many cases, the photo of this dish does not match the recipe.  Obviously, carrots and possibly other ingredients were added to the dish in the photo.  Just saying...

This was awesome!  I cut the recipe in half because there are only 3 of us, but I used the exact adjusted amounts and didn't make any changes. I know some reviewers used less sugar and/or less oil, but my family really liked the flavor using the full amounts.

Made this for the first time today for a luncheon.  Reduced the sugar to 2/3 cup and used red wine vinegar (based on previous reviews).  Chopped green and red cabbage and added matchstick carrots.  Turned out great! Forgot to add onions but I'm sure the onions would even make it even more flavorful.

This is incredible! Everyone who has tried it loves it. My husband said he could eat it every day. I make the recipe exactly as written, I didn't change anything. I've made this many times. Even my dad, who is pretty famous for his (mayonnaise-based) cole slaw thought this was great, which really surprised me. Just try it as written! Serve with a slotted spoon! It is awesome!

Tart and slightly sweet. This is a great slaw recipe.  I have made it several times.  
There are several people in my church group with allergies that won't allow them to have mayonnaise based slaw so this is the one I make.  I add a grated carrot for color and serve with a slotted spoon since there is a lot of liquid.

Entire family loved it! I mixed it exactly by recipe, dished some up for my husband then added a diced green pepper to the bowl.  It is very similar to a slaw served at a great seafood restaurant in San Antonio.

Very tasty.  Sweet n Sour.  I had home grown veggies that I added to it, red, yellow and green bell peppers sliced very thin, shredded zuchinni, red onion. I was in a time crunch so I didn't boil the dressing. Just mixed all of the sugar and vinegar until sugar was disolved and, after all the spices were added, wisked vigorously as I drizzled in the oil so it all emulsified.  We could have used about 1/2 of the dressing so I'll cut way back next time.  Everyone loved it.  It's a keeper!

This was wonderful!  So good, and I LOVE mayo based anything so for me to switch over to a non-mayo slaw was a big deal.  

I tried it after I mixed it all because it smelled so good and I ate more than my share!  I mixed equal parts of vinegar and sugar, both a little less than a half cup and followed the rest of the recipe to a T.  It is a bit on the vinegary side, but that is how I like it, and if you want it sweeter you can just up the sugar.

I love this slaw!  I make up a big batch and keep it in the fridge.  It's fast and easy to make, but disappears quickly.  My husband, kids, and I all pull it out as an add on to whatever meal we're eating or as just a snack.  I must say that as I don't like onions I leave those out.  Definite keeper!

This was very good, but could someone explain why the dressing is boiled first. With only 1 tsp sugar in the cooked mixture, it can't be to dissolve the sugar.  Is it to boil off some of the vinegar?

Great!! I made this last minute before a meal, and it tasted good without the overnight refrigeration. I will defiantly make this again, but try to make it ahead of time.

I forgot to add the vegetable oil...and it was fabulous! Also, I used spicy brown mustard and threw in some grated carrot for color. Very affordable to make and soooo refreshing in the hot summer! Thanks for this recipe!

Fantastic alternative to a heavy coleslaw! I used a bag of coleslaw (grated cabbage and carrots) and 1/2 a bag of grated purple cabbage to add color. I used 1/2 the dressing and from that - only 1/2 the amount of oil (i used olive oil).  The salad needs to marinate for a number of hours for the cabbage to wilt and soften up a bit! Wonderful recipe!

Very good! It's really sweet but you can easily cut the sugar down to have a cup. I also add graded carrots and diced green peppers, they add a bit of color....but will use this slaw recipe all the time from now on.

This definitely was an intereting twist on coleslaw, but we found it rather sharp.
