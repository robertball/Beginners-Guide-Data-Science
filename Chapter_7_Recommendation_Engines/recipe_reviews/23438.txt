Fantastic!  I am SO tired of seeing stack cake recipes that aren't true stack cakes!  This one has it all, thin layers and great filling ideas.  I tried it with apples and currants but as Jeanie says I'm sure most any combination would be great.  I'm thinking about throwing in some mango or apricot in the next one.  Easy to make but rather unfamiliar (baking on instead of in a cake pan?) to many cooks/bakers.

Thank you so----so much for this recipe.  I have looked for many years for this one.  My grandmother use to make it all the time but never handed down the recipe, she kept it tucked away in her head.  I tried to bake it once from my childhood memories of watcher her make it but it was a disaster. So thank you for MY CHRISTMAS PRESENT THIS YEAR.

Sounds very similar to a fruit cake recipe my grandmother did every year. She used a different dried fruit for each layer. It was my grandfather's favorite. She's 90 now and doesn't make it anymore. I find myself craving it at Christmas time still tho. Might have to try it out and see if it's the same.
