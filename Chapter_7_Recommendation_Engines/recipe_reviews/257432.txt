This was pretty good. I didn't have plain yogurt on hand, so I used a container of greek vanilla yogurt + sour cream to make the 3/4 cup needed for the recipe. The bread was a little on the sweet side, I'm sure due to the sugar in the yogurt that I used, so next time I'd cut back on the sugar a bit if using flavored yogurt. I do want to mention that this made (2) 7" x 3" loaves. I was a little thrown off by the 6" pan requirement. My full size loaf pans are more like 8.5" x 4.5" x 3", which would be the size needed for this recipe if making a full size loaf instead of the two smaller loaves that I made.
