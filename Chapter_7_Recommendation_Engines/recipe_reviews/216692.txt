Absolutely delicious!  I do not like red wine - cooked or not - so I didn't put any in.  Instead I used more chicken broth and more heavy cream.  Also - I did NOT drain the oil from the sun dried tomatoes, the oil had a bunch of flavor.  
I used "Garden" style fettuccine rather than just spinach and it was great.  Make sure you toss the noodles with a little oil before serving so they don't stick together in a big clump.
The friends that I had over for dinner said that it tasted like it was from a restaurant.  Delicious!

Hubby gave this five and I give it three.  I think if I had used fresh herbs it would bring it to a four star.  It has pretty good flavor, but didn't wow me.  We will try it again though, since my husband really enjoyed it and it was sooo easy!

This was great. I didn't use the flour because I didn't want it to "gravy like", it was delish.  The flavors were outstanding.  Great, easy recipe.  Thank you.

This was very good. I changed the serving size to 6 but only used 4 chicken breasts. I sliced the breasts into 1/2 strips and continued with the recipe. Also I used a 1 1/2 T of cornstarch mixed with water to thicken the sauce instead of flour. The sauce when finished tasted a little bitter  to me so I added 2 fresh basil leaves (its all I had) and some dried basil (didn't measure). I think the bitterness was from the brand of tomatoes I used. The sweetness from the basil helped to balance the bitterness. I used a Merlot for the wine. It was a really good dish. Also after you drain your pasta toss it with a little bit of olive oil so that it doesn't stick together into one mass clump when you serve it. Thanks for the recipe.

This is VERY good as is, I added red pepper flakes to kick it up a bit. Publix didn't have spinach fettuccine, so I just used regular. This also reheats very well.  Thank you for a great recipe!

Very good! I wished I had some crusty bread to serve with this, but alas I didn't. I subbed a little whole milk and butter for the heavy cream, and omitted the red wine. This makes a *lot* of sauce and it is very good. I want to try this with grilled chicken this summer.

This recipe surprized me with how delicious it was. Not too hard to prepare for a dinner.
Something i would cook to impress family and friends.
Went great with a spinach and strawberry salad.

I make this with leftover chunked chicken added to the sauce instead of fresh chicken breasts.  My family loves this!  We've had it with tortellini - cooked in the sauce - or over pasta with Parmesan cheese on top.

This pasta dish is absolutely delicious!  The sauce is wonderful!  My daughter made this for me for my birthday dinner and it was a huge hit with everyone.  Only downside is it took her longer the the 15 mins prep and 25 mins cook time listed on recipe.  Other than that, delish!!  Can't wait to try this again.

It wasn't what I had hoped for. Maybe making it with chopped fresh basil, adding a tiny bit of sugar? I don't know. It needs tweaking. It was edible but I had to eat the leftovers so they didn't go to waste because the family really didn't like it. Me neither, but I hate to waste food!

I usually make a recipe as written before possibly tweaking the second time. This was a bit of an exception. I could tell right away that this would be WAY more sauce than I like for such a small amount of pasta. So I halved all ingredients (except the garlic and olive oil). I also cut up the chicken in bite-sized pieces and cooked with the garlic. About five minutes before it was done I mixed a tablespoon of cornstarch (in lieu of the flour) with a little water and mixed it in with everything (leaving the chicken in). This thickened it up to the perfect consistency and amount of sauce for me. Stirred in the pasta when it was done (I used 12oz of linguini) and it was delicious! So basically I kept everything the same just halved it. Very good!

Very flavorful recipe. I followed it as written with the exception of deboning, chopping and using a rotisserie chicken instead of the 4 chicken breasts called for. It made a lot of sauce so I wish I had cooked the entire 16oz of pasta.

I have to admit to using a few replacement items:  Amore brand Sundried Tomato Paste and Herb Paste.  I also used capellini pasta rather than fettuccine.    Otherwise I followed the recipe.  We enjoyed this dish very much.  Not only was it easy to make, but it was very delicious.  Thank you so much!

I really enjoyed how this turned out. It was not difficult to make except for trying to dice up sun dried tomatoes from the jar. The flavor was good. I added more heavy cream to it to make it creamier, and a sprinkle of Durkee 6 pepper blend to give it some zing. I cooked 6 chicken breasts. Plenty of sauce.

I made it exactly like the recipe called for, despite all of the great ingredients it really lacked in flavor.   Very bland. I will not be making it again.

I used unsweetened almond milk instead if cream, but kept it the same. It only took about 45 minutes from start to finish. It's a keeper and a way to use those big jars of sun dried tomatoes and roasted red peppers that I got at Cosco's.

I made this using half and half in place of cream, and whole wheat linguine in place of spinach fettuccine (which I could not find).  It was very good and I would make this again.
