Delicious. I lightly browned 4 chicken breasts (first seasoned w/ salt & pepper) and shredded them before adding to the chowder. I love the chunks of potato from the soup (I used Campbells brand) I tasted it as written, then added a sprinkle of chili powder & cumin and topped with just a pinch of some finely chopped cilantro. This was really good and so easy (and quick) to make. My 3 y.o. even liked this. You can easily adjust the spiciness to your liking. Thanks.

Awesome. I substituted chream of mushroom for cream of potato. I omitted the mushrooms and added one very finely diced potato. For heat I added one mashed up chipotle pepper in adobo sauce. For the chicken, I george foreman'd a chicken breast that was seasoned with Grillmates Cinnamon Chipotle Rub, and it reallky made the soup. I also just dumped all ingredients into my crockpot and let it go. It came out perfectly.

I made a few changes according to our tastes. I switched out the mexi corn to regular frozen sweet corn, eliminated the mushrooms and used salsa verde instead of the green chilis. It was delicious!

I made this for my dinner tonight, as I'm feeling a bit under the weather and wanted a quick dinner. 

I used my own homemade chicken broth (to cut back on salt(the canned broths can be SO salty and overpower the dish)and I omitted the mushrooms. I also added just a little Tabasco, to give it just a little more kick.

There was enough for my dinner tonight and for a couple nights during the week. 
This is quite the comforting soup. And really just quick as a jackrabbit.

Best soup ever. This is the only soup my husband will ever ask me to make. I make it as-is but without the mushrooms and it's perfect every time. It's obviously not low-cal, so I don't make it as often as I would like to!

This recipe is quick and easy, but as a result it has too much of a condensed canned soup taste and texture. It's not bad, but could be better.  I ended up using extra milk and chicken broth to offset the canned soup texture.

This was so easy and very good.  I used leftover rotisserie chicken, frozen corn and omitted the mushrooms. I used a chicken bouillon cube with 1 cup of water instead of the broth.  Instead of stirring in the cheese, I just let everyone put their cheese in their own bowls.  I couldn't believe how good it tasted after being so simple to make.

Very good!  Perfect for me and my husband (I love spicy and he doesn't).  This was the perfect medium.  I added just a little cilantro and served with a sliced avocado.   I will definitely brown or grill the chicken next time for even a little more flavor.  We also did not serve it with cheese as neither one of us likes cheese.  It was still delicious!

Excellent.  I eliminated the green chillies, and added some finely sliced green onions. Great taste.
