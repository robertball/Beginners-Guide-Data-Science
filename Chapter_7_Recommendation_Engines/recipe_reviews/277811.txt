These were just ok in my opinion. It took 52 minutes for the potatoes to be fork tender. I don't understand why the potatoes need to be baked after they are topped with the feta cheese . Feta cheese does not melt. An unnecessary step. Thanks for sharing your recipe but I don't think I will be making these again.
