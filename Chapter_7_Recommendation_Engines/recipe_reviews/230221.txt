It was tasty, though I thought it could have been better with better with extra spices. Still, the the natural flavors of the fresh veggies were great. I had no turkey, thyme, or green beans, so I substituted with chicken, dried oregano, and an additional cup of frozen peas. I think the biggest change was the oregano.

I really enjoyed this dish.  I was skeptical with the combination of veggies and lack of seasoning but I made just as instructed with the exception of crushed-tomatoes.  I didn't have any on hand so I gently smashed cherry tomatoes I had and it worked perfectly!  When I pulled it out of the oven my husband was impressed by it's appearance and made the comment "Fancy!"

I used cheddar cheese and forgot to add the garlic!  I also did not add turkey as we are trying to only have 1 meat dish per week in 2019. The flavors were amazing.  It was a nice light meal.  With all the fresh veggies, it produced a lot of juices. I might line the baking dish with bread next time.

I'm not sure if I will make it again. There was too much garlic for my taste and not enough seasoning.

Used fresh tomatoes, homemade pesto,canned peas,and lg  onion as changes but everything else the same. My DH added more salt to his portion. Oh, I did add cheese only to last 5 minutes. A usual for me. Find it doesn't disappear but sets on top better. Will make again. Thanks halfnotes.

I used ground turkey and there was nothing left in the pan after transferring the veggies into the casserole dish.  My solution was to add more olive oil and a drop each of Thyme oil and Oregano oil.

The only other changes I made were to substitute squash for peas since I had no peas on hand; I added fire-roasted diced tomatoes in place of crushed tomatoes, and I added Paul Chachere's Creole seasoning.

This was delicious and we enjoyed it immensely.

I made it for a friend and both she and her husband raved about it on different occasions. I never tasted it though:)

I used extra lean ground beef instead of turkey, but it still turned out delicious!

Absolutely Loved it. Made it with everything except Mushrooms, Thyme and Basil. (I don't eat those three things). Family wants it again.
