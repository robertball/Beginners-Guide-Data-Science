Made exactly as written. Edible, but tastes weird for beans. Kind of sweet and sour. Not my idea of cowboy pinto beans--no cumin, no peppers, no spicy heat, no smokiness, etc. (FWIW, this recipe makes a soup, not a dish comprised of discrete beans.)

This recipe is great over white rice! I didn't have 2 hours to wait for the dried beans to cook so I used canned black beans. I also substituted spicy italian sausage because I had some already in my fridge. Tart apples, spicy sausage and the sweetness of the brown sugar really make this dish unique and delicious...
