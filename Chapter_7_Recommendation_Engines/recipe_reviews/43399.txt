Very good recipe.  IF this is your first attempt at jelly making make sure you read the directions like 3x before you even pull out jars.  When this recipe says to strain 1 2/3 cup of mint, it means the juice not the leaves, by the way.

Having been a novice at this jelly making business, I misread the instructions regarding the pectin amount.  It calls for 1/2 (6 oz.) of pectin. I put in 6 oz.instead of the implied 3 oz. Why not just say 3 oz.s???? Pectin comes in 2-3oz. packages.  Needless say mine did not setup. Now to start over again with the Certo recipe.

As this was my first attempt of "jelly making" I found the recipe easy to follow, but the end product to be on the sweet side.   Maybe 2 cups of sugar should be used or 3 1/2 tablespoon of lemon juice.   The choice is yours.

As a first time maker of mint jelly, I was very pleased to find that this recipe was quick, simple, and made delicious jelly. I used 3oz of pectin and had no problems with it setting. My only suggestion is that if you use Scotch Mint you may want to use a few more drops of dye--I found that 3 were just enough to turn it from brownish-yellow to a nice shade of pale green.

Thanks for the recipe!

Yummy!  This is just about the same recipe as they have at the National Center for Home Food Preservation.  I cut the sugar down a little so it wasn't too sweet.  Yes, do make sure you have ALL your "ducks in a row" before you start heating anything - plan ahead.  BONUS: Since 2 Tbsp. of lemon juice was just about one lemon, there was a little leftover.  There was leftover mint juice, too  - so I added the mint juice and lemon juice to a pot of iced green tea I had made.  Delish!  Mint-mania at our house.  Between the jelly & the tea, I knew something good would come out of our surprise mint patch (our mower broke and the lawn was HIDEOUSLY overgrown!)  When life breaks your mower, make mint jelly!

First kick at the "Jelly" can and it turned out great. I got a little experimental on the second batch and used pineapple juice instead of water. It is a nice compliment to the mint (especially since I used pineapple mint) and works great if using the jelly as either a condiment on pork/chicken/lamb or as a spread.

Very easy to make.  Set real nice.  Loved it in filling for cookies.  Made another batch with pineapple mint and used pinapple juice instead of water that was a delite.

Recipie was easy to make and understand. I used  chocolate mint leaves instead of regular mint leaves. The flavor was different than any other jellies I've had. I'd recommend not using exotic mint plants if you make this.

Be sure to use liquid pectin.  I've used this recipe several times and it has always turned out great, except for the time I used Ball Classic pectin instead of the Certo liquid I usually use.  The batch with the Ball not only didn't gel properly (more like a thick syrup than jelly), it had a nasty looking brown residue in the bottom.  I contacted Ball about this and they're not surprised, even though there is nothing on the jar to indicate not to use it in mint jelly.  Just thought I'd put a warning so others don't make the same mistake.  Happy canning!

The first time I tried this recipe, I reduced the sugar because of some of the comments I read, the jelly was too sweet.  However, the jelly never set right. The second time I tried it, I followed the recipe it to a T.  At the end, my jelly was still really runny.  Disappointed, I talked to a friend of mine who's mother makes jelly all the time.  She told me to wait a few days before I throw it out because sometimes it takes that to congeal.  I am glad I waited.  I had four beautiful bottles of jelly. And, I made one more batch!  BTW, I kept my runny jelly and use it as syrup for tea or on pancakes!

Well I am a novice at mint jelly. Never even had it before. Therefore this recipe gets 5 stars from me! Super easy. Set up nice. Had a great minty sweetness to it. I actually started on the mint jelly mission before I found this recipe. So when I read only a cup and a half of mint I got worried. Because I just put a bunch of mint in a pot boiled it and then strained out three times the recipe amount and tripled the recipe. Made 12 pints. Good luck! I am not an experienced canner so I think if I can do it you can do it. : )

Excellent taste.  I've gotten considerable compliments on this jelly.  I add about 3 drops of food coloring to make it a bit darker green but otherwise, no changes.

I haven't had too many mint jellies but I could hardly taste the mint. Tastes great in general, but a little more mint flavor would be better!

I started making this recipe but I felt that steeping the mint for only 10 minutes did not yield a minty enough base to my taste buds. I ended up steeping for about an hour. I also omitted the food coloring, why add artificial dyes to a dish that is beautiful just the way it is? My main complaint is that the author forgot to include how much head-space to leave when filling the jars.

This recipe worked as written, no problems. The instructions were clear. For me, in Canada, I needed 85 ml of pectin (the metric conversion gives 85 g which is how some suppliers label theirs). This will yield 11-12 125 ml jars. I use 3 drops of colouring just to get a little more punch to the green. The flavour is wonderful!

Good recipe. However I used ruby red grapefruit instead of the oranges because I like the tart taste of kumquats and the grapefruit added to the wonderful taste. Not too sweet or too tart. Set up pretty well but I will probably use pectin next time due to the slight runny consistency.

This was my first time making a jelly and this recipe was really simple.  I did use brown instead of white sugar though and I only used 2 cups but it was still too sweet for me.  I do like the flavor though and will definitely try again.

Jelly set up, and turned out good.  It adds a hint of mint.  Warning almost too sweet and minty if you glob it on, so use sparingly.

I love mint Jelly, but it turned out pale yellow-green and far too sweet. Flavour was all wrong too. (Maybe because we only had spearmint.) It set up nicely, but all in all, won't make this one again.

I made a half recipe , used 1tablespoon of lemon juice, and only 1 cup of sugar.  I mixed my pectin powder in with the sugar,brought the mint water to boiling , stirred the sugar into the boiling liquid .When it returned to a rolling boil ,I timed it for one minute. Took it off the burner added 1/2 teaspoon of calcium water. Stirred it up and it jelled perfectly. It is just the right amount of sweetness. My husband really likes it.

My mint water was more of a yellow brown.  When I put green food coloring in it turned army green.  So the next time I put blue food coloring in and it came out a beautiful green.

This is a great recipe, but I, too, had trouble with the jelly not setting up - probably my fault since I tried combining 2 recipes.  BUT, after the jelly was refrigerated for 2 days and still looked like a thin sauce, I put it back in the pot and brought it back to a boil, testing periodically in a bowl (placed in ice) to see if it was setting up.  After the jelly boiled for about 10 minutes, it was ready to remove and put back in the jars, perfectly set up.  BTW, I separated into 2 batches and added a chopped (with seeds) Serrano pepper to one batch, cooking the jelly with the Serrano - did not remove pulp or seeds.  It turned out really well, not very spicy but with a slight kick.  My husband loved it!

I decided that since I had an abundance of mint in my garden it might be a good chance to see if I could make this.  Recipe was very simple, not hard to follow, and turned out great.  Only thing I did a little different was to add more green food coloring .  The first batch was kind of pale, but did not affect the flavor.  Very happy and will be making more this year since half of my stash was used for Christmas gifts.

My first attempt at jelly making, and it turned out excellent! I doubled the recipe as I had an abundance of mint on hand, and it doubled well. Thanks for the great recipe.

Ok although I have no idea what to do with them except give them away.

easy to make-I didn't use the food coloring, it just looks too fake, the natural color was a pale yellowish.  What a great way to use up all of the spearmint in my herb garden.  Making a second batch tonight.

I will make this again. It set well with 2 cups of “mint sauce”. Hate to waste a 1/3 of a cup of anything.

I've made mint jelly for years but always trying new recipes to see if I can find an improvement. This was not it. This came out with such a weak overly sweet flavor. Normally I use 3.5 cups mint ( chopped & crushed) to 2.5 cups water, 2 cups sugar, 2 drops green food coloring and the 3 oz liquid pectin.  It comes out really minty without being overpowering & not that blast of overpowering sweetness. I want to taste the mint more than the sugar.  The process I use for making it is the same.

The instructions were not clear!
1/2 (6oz)... I used 3oz on my first batch.  I should have used 6oz.. 
 Pour the liquid mint not the mint (I figured that one out).  

The final product was tasty but I do have one batch of mint syrup because of the unclear instructions.

I really liked this recipe!  It was not as minty as I had expected and is quite sweet but it is delicious!  Can go with things other than lamb as a result - we used it with crackers and cheese!

Turned out really well! Added a couple extra drops of food coloring, and the jars came out beautifully.

I’m glad I read the reviews, I would not have noticed the weird phrasing. I’m pretty sure I did correctly and now I’m just waiting for it to set up.
I did add a little more food coloring.

Great recipe.  I strained a couple of times to try to make it clear.  It worked well and the jelly looks great.  It will be a wonderful addition to Christmas gift baskets.  Next time I'll try the pineapple option!

Deeeelish!  Very fresh tasting and yummy... I skipped the fake green - and it may not be as bright, but it's still pretty in the jar - and incredibly tasty.  Makes quite a lot - so I put the extra into 125ml jars and canned it for later.

I'm a little upset that the 3 oz liquid pectin didn't set the jelly very well.   It was a little too soft.  So next time, I will either cook it down longer or use the 6oz of liquid pectin.  Other than that, flavor is good!

Turned out runny and way too sweet.
