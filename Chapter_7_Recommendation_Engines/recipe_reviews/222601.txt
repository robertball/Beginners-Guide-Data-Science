I love this recipe and get compliments on the muffins all the time. The changes I make are as follows:
I use whole wheat flour, 1/3 cup sugar, 1/4 cup oil, 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce, 1/2-3/4 cup
chocolate chips( not the miniature ones but regular size). The chocolate chips give it sweetness so not as much sugar is needed but if you like sweet then keep the sugar amount at 3/4 cup.

I used lactose free milk and pecans instead of walnuts. I made no other changes. This zucchini bread is FANTASTIC. The texture of these muffins is like the lightest, fluffiest cupcake you've ever had, though it's not overly sweet. The measurements are spot on, everything is perfect. This is the best zucchini muffin we've ever had. EVER.

Very Good! Did substitute all natural applesauce in place of oil. Actually shredded more zucchini to continue baking more so I can share with family and friends! Second time around I did use whole wheat flour...still so yummy!

Fantastic Zucchini muffin recipe.  I've made Zucchini muffins using a half dozen recipes, and this was the favorite.  The muffins were especially moist, so if you store them, leave them slightly uncovered.  I expect, due to the moisture, these will freeze exceedingly well.  Despite making 72 of these, none made it into the freezer.

The only changes we made were:
1) Added 1TB of cocoa (powder).
2) Substituted half of the oil with apple sauce.

I made these the other day for my daughter's "special friday snack". They turned out pretty good, the kids gobbled them up according to the teacher.  I haven't had a good experience combining chocolate and cinnamon in the past so I left out the cinnamon and replaced 1/2 cup of white flour for 1/2 cup wheat.  Turned out alright, albeit a little "deflated" which was bc of the wheat flour substituion, I think.  Made these again this morning and substituted 1/2 cup quick cooking oats in place of 1/2 cup of the flour (no wheat this time). Also used a banana in addition to the zucchini (total 1 cup fruit/veggie combo) and they came out DELICIOUS! Will definately make again!  Thanks for the recipe.

Zucchini Chocolate Chip Muffin Haiku: "Do not look elsewhere. This is THE only muffin, recipe you need!" I can't believe I haven't gotten around to reviewing this one as I've been making this muffin recipe for several years, albeit, with the occasional modifications here or there. As written, it doesn't need any adjustments; it really is a perfect zucchini muffin. Many of the reviews have helpful suggestions, and any customizations, while not necessary to a terrific original recipe, certainly can put one's spin, healthy or taste-wise, onto the muffin. For instance, I sub in 1/2 c. oats for 1/2 c. flour, 1/4 c. apple sauce and 1/4 c. coconut oil for the veg oil, more than 1 c. zucchini (not measured, just whatever I grate off one medium zucc), 1 TB ground flax mixed w/ 2 TB water for the egg, and most recently, adding in 1 TB brewer's yeast (for increased lactation.) Sometimes I use the walnuts, sometimes not, but always chocolate chips! Out of the oven - heavenly!! I make double batches and freeze some, which always works out well too.

I just made these muffins, and they are by far the best zucchini muffins I have ever made! The only things I changed/added was I didn't use walnuts, added about 1/2 tbs of nutmeg. I also sprinkled a little nutmeg on the top of them, mainly for appearance.
I will definitely be making these again!

Wow!  Super yummy!  Used whole wheat flour instead of regular and added a banana because I was a little short on zucchini.  Otherwise, exactly per the recipe and these are sooooo delish.  I picked the wrong day to start back on Weight Watchers, lol!  Next I'll try subbing apple sauce for some or all of the oil.

I didn't have any chocolate chips, so I substituted 1/4 cup cocoa powder and added an extra 1/4 cup milk. Super light and fluffy with just the right amount of chocolate!

I doubled this recipe and worked perfectly. Also, used  1/2 vegetable oil and 1/2 apple sauce because I ran out of oil. Worked great. Thanks for the wonderful zucchini muffin recipe. The kids (and adults) loved them!

These are moist, delicious muffins.  I wouldn't make any changes (maybe a little less salt and baking soda).  I did reduce the sugar the first time I made it, and they were better the 2nd time, when I simply followed the recipe.  The one thing I don't measure is the zucchini.  Just grate an entire zucchini into the batter, using the large holes on a four-sided grater, and for me, the baking time required is more like 25 - 30 minutes.  They are fab with raisins or chocolate chips.

These are great tasting muffins.  Had to make one adjustment though. . . when I mixed all of the ingredients, it came out more like a dough than a batter.  I read the ingredients lists 3 times trying to figure out where I went wrong, but in the end I just added more milk until it became a batter (probably around another 1/4 c).  With the addition of the milk the muffins came out great!

Great recipe.  I made a loaf instead of muffins.  I also added cinnamon chips.  I didn't like the cinnamon chip in oatmeal cookies but they were great in this recipe. I used some regular choc. chips too.

These were a nice little muffin.  Mini-chocolate chips are definitely preferable to regular ones.  That way there's just a little taste of chocolate.  Didn't change a thing in the recipe.

Very good!  easy to make too!  Made 2 batches, one with white flour and one with whole wheat...both good but the wheat flavor of the WW version was a little over powering so next time I will either do all white or half and half.  very moist and airy!!

These were very good - I was looking for a nice "base" recipe for zucchini muffins, and this one is great. I used a cup of fresh blueberries in place of the chocolate chips and walnuts. They turned out very moist and just lightly sweet!

These muffins are excellent, moist and tasty. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

As a health nut, I used whole wheat flour and cut the sugar and the oil in half. I added a bit of buttermilk to make up for the changes. The muffins still came out great!

My first attempt at making zucchini-filled anything! I have a never-ending supply of zucchini growing in my garden, and I needed to make something my picky kids would eat! I honestly didn’t change anything about this recipe (I kinda dislike when people make major changes, like total substitutions)...except I added a little more chocolate chips because I had regular ones, not minis! I also topped  the muffins with a few chocolate chips for appearance sake before baking! These are good!! Just the way the recipe calls for everything...no need to substitute anything!! Bonus: my kids LOVE them!!!

Omg! The most tender, moist muffins I have ever had! I added a few extra regular size chocolate chips and blended the ingredients in the kitchen aid mixer. Everything still came out perfect. I'm in love! This is the best recipe I have made in years!!!!I cook a lot too!

Oh. My.  I don't know if I lucked out and pulled these out of the oven at the perfect time, or if this is just that incredible of a recipe, but the warm muffin literally melted in my mouth.  I made a double batch, and the only way I deviated from the recipe was by whisking the zest of two lemons into the dry mixture, and adding a half teaspoon of cloves (1/4 tsp. for normal batch).  Zowie- these are incredible.  I use a stone muffin pan, so heated the oven to 375, and once I put the muffins in, lowered the temp. to 350; they took about 28 minutes to bake, and I pulled them when the muffins were firm but still oh-so-very slightly soft in the middle.

Followed some other reviewers suggestions and made a few minor changes: added an extra cup of zucchini (squeezed out all excess liquid) and reduced oil to 1/4 butter instead. Subbed brown for white sugar. Used chocolate chunks vs. mini-chips, as that was all I had. Left out the nuts based on personal preference. Wonderful recipe. What really shined was the great taste and texture of these muffins. I'm going to have lots of zucchini this summer so will make these muffins again. I look forward to sharing them with my coworkers.

Excellent! Watch the baking time, tho. My first batch was brown at 20 mins, and second batch was brown at 16 mins. I subbed applesauce for 1/2 the oil, and did one batch with choc, another one without. Both were good but you might want to increase spices if skipping choc. Also, you can always chop regular chips into mini. Thx!

I replaced the nuts with raisins due to a nut allergy in my family and they tasted great. Good way to use up extra zucchini.

They are great.  I followed the recipe but added a 1/4 tsp. of nutmeg.  I also used frozen zucchini.

I made these this morning...super yummy. I used 1/2 of the oil and replaced the other 1/2 with applesauce. I replaced 1/2 of the flour with a mix of flax meal and whole wheat flour. Replaced nuts with craisins too.

Pretty darn good. I don't eat dairy, so I replaced the milk with coconut milk. Used walnut oil, dark chocolate chips, cut the sugar to 1/2 cup, used brown sugar, and replaced 1/2 cup flour with wheat. Not sure I like the wheat flour with the zuchinni, so I may skip that change next time. This recipe was plenty sweet, and probably would have been too sweet for my taste if followed exactly.

YUM!!  What a great way to use up zucchini!  The only change I made was to add 1/2 cup cocoa powder to the flour mixture for Chocolate Zucchini-Chocolate Chip Muffins.  Will make again (with or without the additional cocoa)!

Love love love these muffins. I made one small adjustment in blending the zucchini in a magic bullet instead of shredding it and the muffins came
Out very light and fluffy.  Amazing. Will make this again and again.

Pretty good  but not the best. I actually was in search of a basic zucchini muffin recipe so I substituted raisins for the chocolate chips. I also doubled the amount of zucchini and increased the cinnamon to 1 tbsp and added 1/2 tsp nutmeg. I also added an additional egg and 1 tsp baking powder. After soaking the raisins I liberally coated them in some flour and added them that way, including the flour leftover at the bottom of the bowl. This compensated for the extra fluid in the zucchini and egg. Overall it turned out ok but there are other recipes on this site which are much better, in my opinion.

I love these and my kids love them. They knowingly and willingly eat zucchini with these muffins! Last time I made these I used the smallest zucchini I could find--it was more than needed but I used it all anyway and added a tad more chocolate chips. Also replaced half the oil with homemade applesauce. Yum! EDIT: Just made with two-thirds whole wheat flour, and large flake oats in lieu of nuts--everything else was as directed. So yummy, and the edges are crunchy. Really good.

Very, very good. My kids didn't even notice the zucchini, which is a plus. Next time I'd probably put in even more.

4.5 stars for the recipe, but bumps up to 5 stars with the following substitutions, as guided by many other reviewers here: reduce the amount of sugar by 1/3 (so use 1/2 a cup instead of 3/4), and sub half of the oil for applesauce. I also went with an unbleached light wheat flour instead of all-purpose b/c I wanted to try to make 'em a little healthier, but then I also decided to use both mini and regular chocolate chips because chocolate is awesome, so not sure I made it any healthier, but these muffins are friggin' delicious. This recipe is fantastic because you can tweak it to your own special dietary needs or health habits and i think they'll still come out great. I doubled the recipe and made 18 regular muffins and 24 mini muffins. I will be lucky if they last through the day tomorrow...

Mini-chips are a fantastic way of getting the chocolate flavor in there, but still allowing the zucchini flavor to present itself. My kids love these. I plan to double the batch and freeze half.

Outstanding. Made these with lactose-free milk and halved the walnuts to 1/4 cup since I'm not always big on nuts, but they fit so well in this recipe, I wish I'd put in the full half cup! Since I baked them in a non-stick pan, I dropped oven temp to 325 and baked them for 23 minutes, they came out perfectly moist. Will be using this recipe againn

These were delicious! The only changes I made were: 1/4 cup Splenda and the remainder white sugar, omit the nuts, and use regular size chocolate chips. They are super moist! I might decrease the cinnamon a bit next time.

Kids wanted chocolate-chocolate chip muffins and realized I was out of cocoa.  Tried these out and everyone agreed these were better than Plan A.  This recipe is delicious as written.  We topped some with cream cheese frosting which brought them from 'Amazing' to 'that's what I'm talking about! status.  Thanks for sharing!

Made this recipe today to use up some zucchini.  I made the following changes: substituted half the oil with unsweetened applesauce, substituted 1/4 cup of brown sugar for white, added a dash of nutmeg, omitted the nuts, and used milk chocolate chips instead of semisweet.  These just might be some of the best muffins I've ever made!  Yum!  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

I made these muffins so many times this past summer to use up all our zucchini. The kids love them. I follow the recipe as written, playing around with the kinds of nuts and chips. We like them best with chocolate chips (just 1/3 cup or the chocolate flavor takes over the zucchini flavor too much) and chopped pecans (also 1/3 cup).

Still my favourite zucchini recipe. I add cocoa and often use leftover buttermilk.  These are delicious though! I am a big fan of muffins with chocolate chips. These were a big hit during a camping trip in the Summer!

These are amazing! I dislike zucchini, but love these! 

I've become a clean eater though. So for these I used stevia instead of sugar. I put in 1/4 tsp. more of baking soda. I took out a little salt. If healthy eating, you can take out the chocolate, or find healthy chocolate chips.

They also freeze great!

How could I give you anything else but a 5 star rating!  Literally, every person I've shared these with has asked for the recipe.  Even my husband has raved about them (and even been a little miffed when I gave away our last four).  I am making them again tomorrow for the fourth time in a week.

changes were   to increase milk by 1/4 cup and added 1/4 cup shredded coconut, subbed oil with applesauce. Followed the rest as described and baked 20minutes, came out moist delicious and perfectly formed. Excellent flavour will make again and maybe try subbing half the flour for protein powder .

This is my favorite zucchini recipe! I don't make any changes in the recipe; the muffins are perfect as is. The only problem is that I have a hard time sharing them !

Really good!  I added the larger chocolate chips because that is what I had on hand.

This is a great recipe - kids and grown-ups loved them!  I substituted applesauce for the oil, as I found the first batch much too greasy.  I didn't bother with the walnuts and I added a half-cup brown flour in place of some of the white.   Tasty!

I always use silk almond milk instead of regular milk, whole wheat flour instead of white flour, and without walnuts. With these alterations. The muffins remain moist and quite tasty. I also tried various other alterations: 50/50 applesauce/oil, applesauce instead of the egg, lemon chips instead of chocolate chips, and 1tbsp coconut oil mixed with oil (total 1/2c oil), and all variations have been equally delicious

I did omit the nuts as my child doesn't like them but they are probably necessary for flavor.  This was pretty bland tasting.  I'm not sure I'd use the mini chips again.  They stayed somewhat melted and didn't give as much of a chocolate taste as I had hoped.  The muffin isn't very sweet so I'm glad I didn't cut back on the sugar like others suggested.

Excellent! I made these changes - used whole wheat flour, brown sugar and left out the walnuts. They were moist and delicious, the flavor of the cinnamon really came through. They were perfectly done at 20 mins.

These are great! Light, fluffy, moist and the right amount of sweetness as well. Reduced the oil just a bit and increased the zucchini a bit to compensate. Also cut down the cinnamon by half. Delicious! And very quick to prepare (30 min total, even with shredding the zuc by hand).

I made the same substitutions as chefshan (whole wheat flour, applesauce, less sugar) and also used pecans in place of walnuts. These are the best muffins I've ever had.

Made it today using the instructions given, except most of the spices (I did put in the cinnamon), and lowered the sugar and added a cup of chocolate chips. My boys didn't like it though. So I probably would not make it again.

Fabulous! I tripled the recipe because I had a massive garden zucchini. Left out the walnust and the chocolate chips. I got more than halfway through this recipe and realized that my chocolate chips were, in fact mint chocolate chips.  So, yuck, I did not use them! Used skim milk and the juice of one lemon (in my tripled recipe). The muffins are moist and delicious. Thank you for posting!

Yummy!  Nice moist muffins!  I did skip the nuts (personal preference).  And I used regular chocolate chips, but I can see how the mini chips would disperse better in the batter.

This is a great recipe. I did replace some of the flour with white whole wheat and used egg replacer and almond milk. Came out delicious.

Wonderful recipe !! I followed exactly according to directions and did a few adjmts.... I used artificial sugar instead of real stuff, I used pure semi sweet chips(reg size), and used 1/2 c oatmeal with only 1 c flour.
The taste and texture are awesome. Baked only 20 min.
I would recommend using the smaller size choc chips.
These are great muffins as I travel regularly and try to eat healthier,,, it works great for me!!
Thanx so much for the recipe. :)

just like Lindsay Gorkoff i was confused when i had mixed all the ingredients together.. it looked more like cookie dough.. luckily i started looking for the least positive reviews and came across hers.. i was like oh i need an extra 1/4 cup of milk (i used almond).. and that fixed everything.. i'd like to try the addition of cocoa powder.. as i felt something was missing.. bf said it was perfect and not to change a thing.. maybe i was expecting something a little sweeter.. and i'm not a fan of sugary recipes.. they were still pretty good.. ty for the recipe

AMAZING!! I had to modify the recipe a bit just because I didn't have some of the ingredients on hand but I've made this 4 or 5 times now and every single time they are delicious and I get rave reviews!
I omitted lemon juice, walnuts, and cinnamon but added oats and extra zucchini. I live at about 5500 ft above sea level so I make sure the dough is pretty sticky/moist then bake for 20 minutes. SO GOOD!!!

These are excellent. I added a little more spices, nutmeg, allspice, and cloves for my personal preference. It wasn't the spices that made these muffins though it's the lovely crisp texture of the top when they come out of the oven.

Perfect! As another reviewer wrote, it's light like a cupcake. I may add oats next time, to make it a heartier breakfast muffin. Even without oats, it's a great breakfast for those rushed school mornings!

Here are the changes I made: oatmilk instead of dairy, dried cane sugar instead of bleached sugar, whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose, and coconut oil in the muffin tins and on top before the muffins went into the oven. They taste amazing! However, I didn't account for high elevation in bake time or oven temp, so they are a bit flat. But that doesn't make them less tasty. Going to make them again.

I used dark chocolate chips & found them a little too overpowering. . If I make these again I would try with milk chocolate. Muffins were very nice but  not quite a 5 star for me.

Followed the recipe but decreased the sugar to 1/2 cup and added a brown sugar/oatmeal streusel on top. Delish! Very moist and yummy.

I have made these a few times now and they always turn out fantastic. The whole family loves them, even my fussy husband ;) I use 2/3 unbleached white flour, and 1/3 whole wheat flour.

I am very happy with this recipe. The texture really is perfect, not too dense. I used 1/4 cup cinnamon applesauce instead of part of the oil, and I used a tablespoon of orange juice instead of lemon juice only because I didn't have any available.

These are so good! My picky kids loved them. The only change I made was using 1/4 cup of cinnamon apple sauce and 1/4 cup of avocado oil. The best.

I love these muffins and so does my family.  They normally don't last til the next day.  I skip the chocolate chips and walnuts and sprinkle some nutmeg on top before baking.  My  daughter loves it when I put one in her lunch bag for snack time.  They don't take long to make and I've served them for dessert when last minute company comes over.  They are always a hit!

These were very tasty and a great way to use up some of the zucchini from the garden.  My 11 year old daughter pretty much made these herself.  We used a bit more zucchini than called for , but otherwise, she followed the directions to the tee.  I'd be inclined to try 1/2 oil /1/2 applesauce and a bit less sugar to make it healthier , but was moist and delicious as written.  We made mini muffins,but still, all were gone within 24 hours.

Whenever I make 'em, they're gone within the week.  They're very popular amongst my family and their friends.  I make them both with and without nuts (for the latter I just replace the nuts with more chocolate).

Great recipe! I doubled it and made 12 muffins and 1 loaf. I had a couple of substitutions as I used what I had on hand... pecans instead of walnuts, dark chocolate chips, olive oil, and half and half with water (1:2). loaf took about 55 minutes to bake. Don't overbake the muffins, they will be drier if you do. My loaf came out more moist than the muffins. I used a very large garden zucchini, and removed the centre seeds prior to shredding. I'll definitely make this again, thanks for the great recipe.

I wasn't sure if I needed to squeeze out the water from zuchinni like I saw in other recipes.   Then I remembered I don't  in the Easy Morning Glory Muffins either.   I followed the recipe and didn't .  Muffins were great!  I may add a shredded apple next time too.  I did add 1/2 tsp more cinnamon.

I used applesauce instead of oil. Second batch I made with raw sugar as out of white and left out walnuts in case anyone at work allergic to nuts. Also made this batch as mini muffins so perfect sixlze for work meeting. I plan on making recipe again for home and using dark chocolate chips along with walnuts.

These muffins are wonderful. I made some changes, which I typically make when I bake for my kids. I 4x the recipe to freeze them for lunches. I subbed the vegetable oil for coconut oil. I did full fat for them so didn't add applesauce. I used 1 and a half cups of coconut sugar in total for the 4 batches. I added more cinnamon also and almost an extra cup of shredded zucchini. I also did half spelt flour and half all purpose. I usually would do all spelt but didn't have enough.  They turned out delish. A nice change from the banana ones I typically do. A good way to use up some of the zuch's from the garden. Bake time for me was 18-19 mins.

These were very good. I substituted butterscotch chips for the chocolate chips and pecans for the walnuts. I also put it in an 8 by 8 pan to make it easier and baked for 25 minutes.

Came out delicious with these substitutions:
white chocolate chips for mini chocolate chips and
add a sprinkling of dried cranberries! Threw a couple extra walnuts on top of the batter with a couple of ornamental cranberries. Pictures next time because there will be a next time soon!

The family loved this muffin!! So easy to make.  I only made a few changes - raisins instead of chocolate chips because we are allergic to chocolate, applesauce in place of oil and raw sugar in place of white sugar.  I have made this 3 times already!

This is the second time I've made this recipe, this time I doubled the recipe. Both times I omitted the lemon juice because the flavor with the vanilla is odd. I increased the milk by 1 tbsp. I don't add the not just the mini chocolate chips. Everyone in my family likes these. I am going to friends tomorrow and bringing these muffins with me so many more people will try them.

My husband loved it- I used apple sauce instead of oil,  added 1/2tsp nutmeg, doubled the recipe for 24 muffins and used overflowing zucchini on double so it was more like 2.5 cups. Love it!

Be sure to double recipe or they'll be gone before you have a chance to get one. We have a nut allergy so with a doubled recipe I added a whole bag of chocolate chips and no walnuts. Less than 24 hours later and I'm making another batch.

Very good!  I used 4 cups of shredded zucchini that I'd frozen last year:, thawed and squeezed. Doubled the batch and reduced the sugar by  1/4 cup.  Used pecans as I had an open package. This seems like a very adaptable recipe.

I made the original recipe, and then a gluten free version. The gluten free mini muffins turned out pretty grainy. The main recipe was ok. It lacked flavor a bit for me. The crisp tops were a great texture. I'm surprised they didn't have any butter. That may have been the flavor I was missing.

I've made this several times for my kids for breakfast. It's always a hit! I make mini muffins and bake for about 15min. Ive added wheat bran, flax seed, and I've subbed in 1/4c whole wheat flour. It's a pretty flexible recipe.

These came out great! The first time I made them, I used a jumbo muffin pan, getting six large muffins. They were done at 20-23 min. I also followed most of the top reviewer's suggestions: used 1/4 cup oil and 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce (one of those small cups), and cut back on the sugar to 1/3 cup and used pecans in place of walnuts. I gave one to someone who is a good baker, and she loved it, saying it was not too sweet, just perfect. :)   I just made them again to bring to a brunch. I cut back by about half on the mini chocolate chips. This time I divided the batter into two 12-cup mini muffin pans (which were ready at 11 min) and six regular-sized muffin tins (ready at 15-18 min). I didn't add nuts this time because someone where I'm bringing them has an allergy. Keeper recipe! Thanks edhoward!

These are absolutely deiciousssss! I did make a few changes, but they were super easy. I doubled the recipe and did half flour half oatmeal, used canola oil since I didn't have any vegetable,  used vinegar instead of lemon juice, used less cinnamon, added nutmeg, and used unsweetened vanilla coconut milk. So good! So moist!

These are absolutely delicious. I’ve never used chocolate in muffins before, but it’s perfect in these. I first had these while visiting my daughter. She’s gluten-free, and made them with a gluten free flour. They were delicious too. I made a double batch because I already knew they were awesome!

This is a wonderful recipe!   They turned out nicely moist (I did leave the storage container lid slightly ajar, per another reviewer's idea, to maintain that "just baked" firmness). I added a few minor things, not that it would have been necessary.    I added about a 1/4 C milled flax, a little bit of nutmeg, and substituted cinnamon chips.  This recipe is a keeper.

Sooooo Good !  My family loved them ! I made a double batch and did make some changes/ substitutions. I added extra zucchini , used half the oil and about 1 cup homemade chunky applesauce  and added extra flour ( higher altitude ). When I divided the batter, I added chocolate chips to one portion and 3 very ripe mashed bananas and raisins to the second portion. My family couldn’t decide if they liked one better than the other ! Great base recipe for a moist flavor packed muffin!

Made in the classroom with students.
Great flavor, easy execution, just a note about cooking time:
The cooking time was correct for convection oven.  If making this at home with your conventional (standard) oven, you will need to increase cooking time to 30-40 minutes.

I made this but I multiplied everything x4 because one whole average zucchini made 4 cups of shredded zucchini, plus the original recipe only said it made 12 muffins, I ended up with  54 muffins. I know that seems like a lot but there are 7-8 of us in the house, trust me these will be gone before the week is out.

Mixed a little differently... all wet ingredients plus a whole zucchini in the blender, then add wet mixture to mixed dry ingredients. Added pecans instead of walnuts. Delicious!

I will be making these delicious, easy to make, beautiful muffins again. I live at 7,500 ft, so just reduced the sugar to 2/3 cup. A nut allergy requires sub for walnuts. I did 3/4 cup mix of regular and mini chocolate chips and 1/3 cup rolled oats. My 3 year old had a blast helping with these because they came together quickly. Super moist, delicious muffins! A new fave in our home.

I made these muffins several times. Scrumptious! They are best warm right out of the oven. I believe I used pecans once because I was out of walnuts. And being the recipe deviate that I am, I didn't really measure the chocolate chips or nuts. Just threw them in.

This is now a standard favorite of mine. As much as I love "Abbeys Zucchini Bread" which I believe is also from Allrecipes, these muffins are much quicker to make and just as good.

I love this recipe!  Today I replaced the zucchini with strawberries because I didn’t have any zucchini! Chocolate chip strawberry muffins! Yum! I also used Apple cider vinegar instead of lemon juice because I didn’t have any juice. Awesome recipe. Thanks!

I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and I only used 1/2 cup of chocolate chips but they still turned out awesome.  Quick and easy bake for a nice after school snack or after dinner dessert.

Thank you Ed Howard for a delicious muffin recipe!  I took the advice of other reviewers and combined them to slightly alter the recipe to make double chocolate zucchini muffins: 1 cup all-purpose flour minus 2T,  2 T unsweetened cocoa powder, 1/2 cup whole wheat flour, reduced sugar to 1/2 cup, bittersweet chocolate chips, > left remaining ingredients as written.  These were fluffy, chocolatey and delicious.  This altered recipe only makes 8 muffins.  So... double the recipe.

I make these all the time.  My husband hates vegetables, but he absolutely loves these.  I did make a few changes that were suggested by others.  I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup and added 1/2 cup applesauce.  It keeps it sweet and very moist. I also add two tablespoons of unsweetened cocoa powder and I use three teaspoons baking powder instead of the baking soda.  They turn out so great every single time.  All the grandkids, nieces, and nephews love them too.  I never have any left.  They rarely get a chance to cool, LOL! :)

Love love love this recipe!! I doubled the batch and made a few changes and they turned out amazing!

- swapped the vegetable oil for coconut oil
- added a cup of chopped cherries (tart cherries/evans cherries)
- used milk chocolate chips
- used 1 cup of sugar (instead of 1.5 and would even put in less next time)
- added more cinnamon and chai spice (Epicure)
- did not add nuts
- I didn't have lemon juice on hand, but had an organic pure mango lemonade, so I used that instead.
- swapped the milk for cashew milk. 

They turned out really moist and flavorful! I will be making these again for sure!

I’ve made these quite often as we grew zucchini this summer.  The only change I make is to double the recipe and add a mashed up banana as it adds to the flavour.   Also I sprinkle the tops with grainy brown sugar.   Today we also made them mini muffins for school and dropped the time to about 8 minutes and they turned out great!

Made this with my kids. The recipe was simple and easy to make. We doubled the batch to use up some of the zucchini from our garden. I left out the walnuts and they tasted great. They were just the right moisteness and chocolate. We will be making more of these.

These turned out perfectly! Moist and delicious. I replaced the oil with the same amount of butter (melted and cooled), used regular size chocolate chips and omitted the cinnamon, but otherwise stuck to the recipe.

Made the recipe almost exactly as the recipe says. The only changes I made was I couldn't find my pecans in the freezer So I used chopped almonds.  I didn't have semi sweet choc. chips so I used milk chocolate chips. Sent some with my husband who was fishing with a couple of his friends. Apparently they told him to tell me the muffins were delicious.

I made this recipe mainly for my 14 month old to have as a snack. I made quite a few adjustments and they turned out fantastic! Used whole wheat flour,  1/2 cup honey instead of white sugar, coconut oil instead of veg oil, then I used shredded coconut flakes instead of choc chips and then hemp hearts instead of walnuts!!
I also did a heaping cup of zucchini and probably could have done a little more. Very happy with this recipe!

Very good! For the second batch I did 1.5x the amount of cinnamon and added a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice to increase the flavor. These are very moist, and taste more like mini zucchini cakes than muffins! I will be keeping this recipe to make them again.

Great and easy recipe! 
Added 1/2 tsp is all spice and did 1/4 cup melted butter and the rest vegetable oil. Also added some walnuts. This is a fan favourite!

Definitely will make again. As others suggested I lessened the oil, canola,  and sugar and used a cup of non-sweetened applesauce. I also used gluten free flour and turned out delicious.

We loved them, and didn't change a thing!  Thanks for posting this recipe.  Trying to eat  a little healthier and bought some huge zucchini.  Never cooked zucchini before, and it was perfect for this recipe.

The only change I made was substituting applesauce for the oil on the first batch I made. 
On the second batch I used buttermilk instead of milk because I wanted to use it up, and also used applesauce in place of the oil. I also added raisins. 
Both batches were very good.

I made a few changes, I used flaxmeel for the egg, brown sugar instead of white, evaporated milk instead of regular, orange juice instead of lemon, 1/4 grapeseed oil & 1/4 flaxseed  oil. For the zucchini, I used this massive yellow one out of the garden, I grated it up with the seeds and all... its all in the oven now, baking away.

I had just been given a huge zucchini, so this recipe was perfect. I made no changes at all, oh wait, I didn't have any  nuts  in the house so I simply left them out. Great simple recipe I've now added to my regular muffin morning bakes.

Changed, everybody loved it. Used half barley flour, half unbleached. Substitute 3/4 cup Black strap molasses and 1/4 cup agave for sugar. 7 tablespoons applesauce for oil. Deleted milk. Dried shredded zucchini between towel before adding. 2 cups zucchini. 1 cup of chocolate chips instead of half. Omitted nuts. Everything else the same. Made miniature cupcakes, regular cupcakes, and mini loaves of cake (2x3") all baked well in Nu wave at 350°. Adjusted time by checking depending on pans used. Came out like a brownie muffin. VERRY VERY GOOD. wasn't sure how it would come out but friends are demanding more.

So moist!  I'm making my second batch after only a day and a half.  My husband and the kids are gobbling them up and have no idea there is zucchini in them!  I did exchange 1/2 c wheat flour for regular flour and decreased the sugar a little.  Can't tell I did that at all.  Definitely worth baking!

Excellent taste and moisture.  I used a mix of whole wheat flour and whole wheat pastry flour, half of the oil I subbed out coconut oil and I added 1 T of chia seeds.  All of that added "health" and they were still amazing!

Great recipe.  Made these last night for a bridal shower at work today.   They are super moist and love the chocolate chips in them. Made no changes to the recipe.  I also made a second recipe - I am throwing that one in the garbage!

The garden is producing lots of zucchini right now!  I followed some of the changes a previous cook made: 1/3 cup sugar, 1/4 cup canola oil, 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce, 1/2-3/4 cup chocolate chips( not the miniature ones but regular size) and 1/2cup pecans. The chocolate chips give it sweetness so not as much sugar is needed. Yummy! Next time I might add unflavoured protein powder to the mix.

Just like Bandit Rider said, the zucchini over powers the muffins. So I made a few adjustments, #1. Reduce the 1 cup of zucchini to 3/4 cup. #2. Less sugar. #3. Lastly, I didn't have Walnuts so I used white chocolate chips instead. Makes it taste better.??

These muffins turn out beautifully. The moisture and taste was superb. My husband loved them and can't wait for me to make it again. So good in the morning with a couple of slices of tomato and a cup of coffee.

I used cinnamon applesauce in place of oil and almond milk in place of regular milk.  It was delicious and a very easy recipe to make

Excellent and easy especially during zucchini season.  I used 60% Cacao Ghirardelli chips which was heaven!

I am an amateur baker. Muffins turned out delicious. Shared with co workers

I love zucchini... and I love zucchini brownies. I was disappointed with this recipe. The muffins stuck to the bottom of the tins; I tried cooking them longer, using more spray, and adjusting the heat. Texture was good, but flavor was lacking something, not sure what. I added chocolate chips and that didn’t help. I live in a Motorhome, perhaps a house kitchen would produce different results.

Absolutely delicious,  the only thing I changed was using whole wheat flour instead of regular white flour and sea salt instead of table salt. Just amazing flavor and moist.  My ten year old needs to be watched otherwise he will eat all of them lol

I made bread instead of muffins, cooked approximately 15-17 minutes longer.  Also, used whole wheat flour, coconut oil & dark chocolate morsels in lieu of their equivalents. Very moist and delicious bread.

These are great. Changed recipe to suit egg and dairy allergies. Replaced egg with egg replacer and milk with flax milk. Used dairy free mini choco chips by Enjoy life brand. 
It’s nice to know this treat can adjusted to be egg and dairy free and they are still delicious!!

The only reason I gave this four stars is because they are a bit heavy after a day or two. Right out of the oven they are so delicious! The next morning we all had some, Hubby had two for breakfast, and we were all quite full. The muffin was very filling but a bit heavy. If anyone has suggestions to make it a tad bit light I am open to suggestions because they do have a wonderful taste!

I LOVED these muffins!  I am NOT a baker at all & and I’ eve never reviewed any recipes that I’ve tried!  These were so tasty, light and not too sweet! It was difficult not to eat all 12...only 6.   Needless to say, I will make them again...when I have a houseful of people that can stop me from eating so many of them, haha!  Instead of oil, I used applesauce.

I made this exactly like the recipe.  It was very easy to make, doesn't even require a mixer and uses up extra summer supply of zucchini. These are so tasty and you would never even suspect there is zucchini in them, just a yummy chocolate chip muffin!

I made this and the second time around it was perfect! The first time I made it with the applesauce mentioned in a few of the reviews. I was not a fan. But the next time I used olive oil for the oil and I substituted raisins for the chocolate chips as I had in the first time - they are fantastic!! Love them. I am going to make them to take on vacation!

The only thing I did different is use regular chocolate chips, cut back some on the oil and added 1/2 cup of coconut! They are delicious! Taking some to church potluck tomorrow!

Since I didn't have lemon juice, I used lime juice instead of the lemon juice.  I'll try the recipe again using lemon juice.  The muffin was mild, not too sweet.  The semi-sweet chocolate chips and walnuts made it tasty.

I followed the recipe pretty much as written with a few substitutions.  I only had real lemon dehydrated crystals and regular size morsels. I made mini muffins. The recipe  came out lighter than many other zucchini bread recipes I’ve made. I’ll definitely make the recipe again!

I  used dark brown sugar and reduced it to 1/2 cup. 
And pecans instead of walnuts. 
It’s hard not to eat more than one.

These muffins were so yummy and moist. Hubby was given 3 HUGE zucchini and it was up to me to figure out what to do with them. One was shredded for this recipe and I ended up making several batches(x5) to use that one up. I used pecans instead of walnuts because that was what I had on hand. I froze a couple muffins for later use and I gave some away. Everyone loved them.

Delicious! There was no zucchini taste which was important as I made for the grands at breakfast. The grands thought I was a hero. Their mom chuckled at my subterfuge.

I followed the recipe, except because my bag of chocolate chips had melted in the car and turned into a solid block, I had to try to chop them, so I had chocolate chunks and pieces instead of chips. I didn't use the whole zucchini; after I got 1 cup, I stopped shredding. Next time I'll use the whole zucchini and/or do more than 1 cup, because there wasn't much zucchini flavor and the muffins were a tad dry. Also, I only baked for 20 minutes, and they were quite browned (not near to burning, just more so than I would have preferred); so next time I'll set the time for less than that. Nonetheless, they didn't last long in my household (largely due to myself, I think).

I was just about to make this recipe, but when I looked at the printed recipe it completely left out the cinnamon and by where the baking soda and vanilla extract was supposed to be it just said 1 teaspoon.  Was I supposed to guess what the ingredient was?  Glad I double checked the recipe before I started to bake!

This was good and moist. It was the first time I added chic chips to zucchini bread. Thought I’d would try something new. We all thought it wasn’t necessary and added a strange mix. Zucchini bread is delicious all in its own and this recipe is moist enough that it doesn’t need extra help by way of chocolate chips.   Will make again without!

I did substitute white flour for a fine, whole wheat flour and also used apple sauce in place of the oil.  These turned out moist and delicious! I doubled the recipe and it made the 12 regular sized muffins plus 48 minis.  I cut the time on the minis to 14 minutes.  Everyone loved these!

My 9,7 & 3 year old just gobbled up a muffin. They were super easy to make. 22 minutes was perfect cook time.  I made the recipe using exact amounts I just didn't use the walnuts.

Easy recipe!  Being short on time, I used a 13x9 cake pan to make 'bars' with cream cheese frosting. I'll have to admit, they were thin so next time, I'll either take the time to use the muffin wrappers or a smaller baking pan. Overall, a great recipe.

These are DELICIOUS. My only problem was the amount of oil.
Next time, I will replace the oil with apple sauce, or some pureed baby food. Less fat, less calories, healthier, and just as moist.

I only made a half batch, which actually turned out to make 8 muffins.  It was too thick to 'fold in' the Z/Chips & nuts, so I added just a little bit more milk until it was loose and smooth enough.  Completed the recipe as written and THEY WERE FANTASTIC!!!    Veggies & dessert all at once!!

Very good recipe. Straightforward and simple, but tasty.  I just exchanged 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour for 1/2 of the white and used lime juice bcs I did not have any lemons available. It turned out great!!! Thank you for the recipe!!!!

These muffins are moist and tasty!  I substituted the milk with soy milk. I’m sure the walnuts could be substituted with almond slices or pecans but that’s for the next time I make these delicious muffins!

These are SO awesome! Absolutely no changes need to be made. I took them out of the oven about two minutes after the kitchen started to smell like fresh baked goods and they were prefect, 24 minutes.

I am making these again, within days of the first batch. Friends and family can't get enough of them. Also, it's a great way to use zucchini.

Really good muffins. Very moist and tasty. Gave a batch to friends who called to say they will take more anytime. l'm going to make another batch replacing half the oil with applesauce and a little less chocolate chips in an attempt to feel less guilty after I devour them all!

These were a big hit with my kids, who were tired of my standard zucchini bread. I omitted nuts because I didn't have any, added extra shredded zucchini (about 2/3 cup), and a dash of nutmeg because I'm just programmed to do that. Will be making a lot of these this summer!

Good basic muffin recipe but I did make changes in order to lessen the sugar and fat and increase fiber. Substituted half the oil for plain yogurt, used 1/2 cup sugar (1/4 cup brown and 1/4 cup white). And used 1/2 whole wheat flour, added a dash of nutmeg and allspice. Also substitutes veg oil for avocado since that is what I had on hand. Needed to bake for about 22-23 minutes.

Very good flavour and texture but I found it far too sweet. I am definitely trying them again, but with the other reviewers' substitutes like applesauce and less sugar and oil.  I also made them with gluten free flour and it worked out fine.

These were so yummy and my picky toddlers loved them! 
I did alter the recipe slightly, I used 1/2 cup maple syrup in place of the sugar, and reduced the milk to 2 Tablespoons to compensate for the extra liquid from the maple. Everything else I left the same, and they are moist and delish!

Amazing recipe.  I use a little toaster oven in my teeny Hong Kong apartment, so I really had to keep an eye on the temp and time.  They turned out great, moist and delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly, but used sunflower oil. I made 14 small/medium sized muffins.

These are so good! I followed recipe exactly except for the chocolate chips and nuts - my teenager just eyeballed the chips and put how much she thought looked right. We didn't put any nuts. This recipe is a keeper.

Followed recipe exactly (as I am not a cook by nature and can't improvise...) and it turned out fantabulous!!!  Maybe a touch sweet.....would maybe cutback on sugar a bit....but super moist and even attractive!!  Now I know what to do with the rest of my zucchini!!!

It was really good, it just didn’t taste like a muffin the way I made it. It was very dry and looked a lot like those garlic, cheese biscuits you can get from Red Lobster.

This is a great way to hide a veggie in a kids' treat. I use summer squash (because the yellow doesn't show like the green in zucchini) and double the mini chips (I leave out the nuts). It's one of my kids' favorite after school snacks.

We love these! They have the best texture and the tops got perfectly crusty. I lowered the sugar to 1/2 cup, and they were still sweet enough for us.

I replaced zucchini with yellow squash since I had a lot on hand.  I also made a savory muffin using the base recipe. I omit it the cinnamon vanilla some sugar and sweet stuff. Used garlic and a smoked pepper powder, cheddar cheese, green onions, and smoked salmon.

Excellent Muffins. I doubled the recipe, used 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup of white sugar, used apple sauce instead of the vegetable oil or olive oil. Added 1/4 tsp fresh ground allspice, Used lemon zest from 1 lemon, and added shredded coconut.
My family loved it! Enjoy.

Yummy, yummy!  These are great.  I used 1/2 whole wheat flour, 1/2 coconut oil/1/2 applesauce.  I think the next time I would use a bit more zucchini, but otherwise these are a keeper.

I substituted applesauce, coconut oil and almond milk for the eggs, vegetable oil and milk and these turned out great for a dairy and egg free muffin. They freeze really well too. Really moist and tasty.

Used less sugar and a little more milk. Turned out delicious! Also substituted the zucchini for mashed ripened banana and it made delicious chocolate chip banana muffins as well!

So delicious! I used applesauce instead of the oil and lime juice instead of lemon. I didn't have lemons. Almost melts in your mouth. Hopefully, my kids enjoy it for an after school snack.

Yummy!

I made it healthier by substituting mashed banana for the oil, added 2 tbsp flax, did a 1/3 mix of whole wheat flour to 2/3 regular flour. and 1/4 cup oats. 

It seems like a very versatile muffin recipe and I definitely will make this again.

Great. Although I only put in 1/4 cup of sugar (brown, because that´s what I had) and I might even try without sugar, as there is lots of chocolate in there.
I used half apple sauce for the oil, and I also used spelt flour (1/2 whole spelt, half regular spelt) - but I live in a country where this is readily available and not super expensive.
No walnuts, cuz my boy doesn´t like them :(
My baking time was not nearly as long.
I think that´s all I changed, but they were super!

This is a great tasting, quick and easy recipe. I only had a muffin tin with 6 muffin ports(I dont know what there called) so I made them extra big and I also added more chocolate chips. They were most and delicious, and I will certainly make them again.
P.S. They taste great with butter on them.

Oh my...these were delish!!  I modified for high altitude:

added 2 -3 more T of flour
added 1 t water
baked 10 degrees higher for 25 min.  (a trick someone taught me for baking at high altitudes)

I used regular sized milk chocolate chips because I had them on hand and it was so yummy!

This recipe produced perfect moist muffins. We doubled the recipe and they turned out perfect. I think you could play with this recipe quite a bit as well for other types of muffins. It's on our KEEP list!

These were okay muffins but only got a 6/10 from both me and my husband. My husband made some icing which he rated 9.5/10 that really upped the value of the muffins but alone they were just 6/10. On the plus side, they were very easy to make and used readily available ingredients so I liked that but I found them a little dry.

Easy and yummy. While there are tons of suggestions for adding applesauce or whole wheat flour to make it healthier, this is one recipe that is yummy just as it is or with those changes.  My 3 and 5 yos helped me make it. My 5yo turned her nose up at the zucchini as she is a picky eater.  Well once the muffins were baked she wanted more and more!

This is a  great muffin recipe.  It is a great way to use zucchinis from the garden.  I did not make any changes to the recipe, fabulous just as is.

I made it right by the recipe.  I did use pecans because I did not have walnuts.  Other than that, I made no other changes.  I have  made twice in the last 4 days.  I plan on making more and freezing them.  Very good!!

Awesome recipe. I used 1/2 c. whole wheat flour & toasted the walnuts first for some depth. But the recipe is excellent without improvements. Moist & delicious. For those wondering, I used 1 1/2 zucchinis to make just over 1 C.

I never made zucchini bread or muffins before, so I was a little nervous, but wow these tasted amazing! I couldn't even taste the zucchini and my 2 year old loved them!  I substituted apple sauce for the oil, and used less than 1/2 cup of normal chocolate chips because that's all I had.  Also I skipped the nuts because my toddler is allergic. I will definitely be making these again!! Thanks for the recipe!

I felt like there was too much cinnamon and we didn't love the walnuts. My daughter gave them 5*, my husband gave them 3*, so I'm averaging it to 4*.

So good! I make these almost every week. They keep great in the freezer. I usually cut the sugar to 1/2 cup, and often toss in an over ripe banana.

I have made this several times and they always turn out lovely. I do substitute unsweetened apple sauce for the oil and decrease both the sugar by a 1/4 c. and the salt by 1/2.  Would never tell.
Thank you for the recipe.

Great recipe! These turned out beautiful and delicious. I did not have lemon juice, so I used water to keep the batter from being too dry. I also added raisins instead of chocolate chips and also added a powdered sugar glaze.

These muffins are delicious! I used about 1/4 cup more zucchini than the recipe calls for, and I also used olive oil instead of vegetable oil just because of what I had on hand. Lastly, I used a mixer instead of hand mixing/folder but everything still blended perfectly and turned out great. The recipe made exactly 12 for me but if you want full size muffins I recommend doubling the recipe to get approx 18 full size. Thanks for posting this!

I made this with chefshans  suggestions. First, I used whole wheat, 1/4 c. and 1/4 c. applesauce to replace oil, 1/3 c. sugar (was plenty!), and 3/4 c. regular size chocolate chips.  Excellent!  The only thing I would change is to use 1/2 c. or les chocolate chips.   My family and I aren't huge fans of whole wheat so I did another recipe just like above but with regular white flour to compare. The result...both are very good!

Moist and delicious. I used all white whole wheat flour. I upped the zucchini to 1.5 c because that's what I had and then squeezed out the juices. I used a little over 1/4 c applesauce and only 1/4 c oil. I cut the sugar to 1/2 c. I prefer regular chocolate chips instead of mini. Could do a little more chocolate chips than listed in recipe.

I liked these muffins but found them very sweet. I used applesauce instead of the oil. This maybe increased the sweetness so next time I will cut back on the sugar.

I made this twice and both times I was very pleased with the result. I doubled the recipe both times so I could freeze a batch but I don't know why I did because they were all gone in the blink of an eye -- yes, the frozen ones too. I made a minor adjustment: I reduced the sugar by 1/4 cup and replaced it with 2/3 cup of unsweetened applesauce for the doubled recipe (I had an opened bottle in the fridge that I wanted to use up).  The second time I didn't have chocolate chips and used raisins instead.  I omitted the nuts both times. The nice thing about this recipe too is that it's fast and easy from start to finish with very little cleaning up after. Excellent recipe.

This is a great recipe!  I always use half white flour and half whole wheat flour in muffin and quick bread recipes.  I also use half oil and half applesauce.   Those were the only changes that I made, and the muffins turned out great.  I'm about to make some more, but will be doubling the recipe this time.

Fantastic recipe, even my kids love them.  I folowed the recipe the first time, but now I make the following changes with great results: use half the sugar, use no oil - substitute with fat free greek yogurt, and add a banana or 2.  The kids never even noticed.

I made them with Craisins instead of chocolate chips and walnuts and used almond milk a few times that I made them.  They were a big hit with my family and I will definitely be making them again !!

This recipe is a keeper!  My boys will not eat zucchini in any form, yet they really liked these.  I made the recipe as written except subbed regular chocolate chips for the minis only because that was all I had.  I especially liked the fact that it only calls for 3/4 cup sugar, unlike the 2 cups in many other recipes.  They were wonderful right out of the oven-moist and filling.  These will be regular breakfast muffins at our house.

The consistency was like bread dough,   I added triple the milk, substituted the eggs & oil with coconut vanilla yogurt, apple honey, and also cut the sugar down by half cup. The taste was okay, so I put fresh butter & drizzled with more apple honey, which improved the taste.

We loved this recipe!  I used zucchini from our garden. I made a couple swaps to make it even healthier:
-used whole wheat flour instead of white. 
-applesauce instead of oil
-organic coconut palm sugar instead of white sugar. 
-I omitted the walnuts so my kids can take to school.

Edit to add:
I made this again for my children's lunches. I did mostly the same as the first time but today I was out of organic palm sugar. Instead I added about a cup of overripe mashed bananas. These are such a hit and I feel great about sending them in lunches!

Omitted the cinnamon. The zucchini taste was pretty noticeable, but my kids still loved them. I used regular chocolate chips instead of mini, and substituted some of the sugar with honey, and the oil with applesauce. I added the nuts on top of a few and left them out for the kids.

These muffins are the greatest! I'll be making more tomorrow with the giant zucchini that got away from me  in the garden. I made a double batch last weekend. 12 + 6 muffins and  one 9" round cake pan. I just took the round out of the freezer where it's been for a few days. Delicious! You could serve a wedge of that plus some whipped cream as a lovely dessert. 
For a double batch, I used 1c whole wheat and 2 c white flour,1/2 c oil and a 4 oz cup of unsweetened applesauce, the lunchbox kind. They're handy in that size for baking.
I cut the sugar down just a tad, I used about 3 big handfuls of shredded zucchini , and dumped in the last of the cocoa powder out of the container, probably about 1/4 c.
Chocolate chips are good but certainly not necessary. The cocoa powder made them soooo chocolatey the chips are almost overkill.

I wanted to like this muffin, and I did! I didn't intentionally change the recipe, except to use a wee less sugar (2/3 c.), but I didn't have all-purpose flour, so I used self-rising instead. Of course, that meant I didn't use baking soda. I did use salt, however, because self-raising flour in the UK doesn't contain salt. I also left out the nuts because it'll be hard enough to get DS to eat a muffin with zucchini (although he grated a zucchini for me, he was skeptical), let alone something with nuts. DH said he had to eat another one just to make sure they were good. ;-) I can recommend this recipe, along with the hundreds other people who reviewed it.

These are moist and delicious.   I wrapped them individually and put them in the freezer for when I felt like something sweet and satisfying.   They would also be good frosted, thereby turning them into instant cupcakes.

My teenagers loved these! Half the batch was gone within minutes of pulling these muffins out of the oven. I substituted brown sugar for the white sugar, omitted the walnuts and used a coarsely chopped 78% cocoa bar instead of the semi sweet chocolate chips.

My husband rates these a 4, our kids and I would say 5 all the way!!!

This recipe is very simple to bring together, and is very forgiving so long as the dry ingredients are well measured. I omitted the nuts due to taste preferences in our house, and used regular semi-sweet chips instead of minis. Wonderful flavor and taste!

Enjoy! Thanks!

I love this recipe, good flavors and light texture. I rated 4 stars because I thought the amount of sugar was to high for the amount of flour it calls for it, so I decreased to a 2/4 cups, turns out delicious!

These were really moist, but there is something about the flavor that I'm not crazy about it.  Not sure what it is.  I did use applesauce instead of oil.

Holy moly!! These were amazing--even at high altitude! I used whole wheat flour, added a little nutmeg, and omitted the nuts (because I don't like them). Next time I will try using 1/2 applesauce and 1/2 oil to make them healthier but I didn't have any applesauce on hand this time. I may also try to add some oats next time. Thanks for an incredible recipe!!

Recipe makes a dozen muffins.  Instead of using walnuts I doubled up on the chocolate chips.  Tasted great.

I cut back a bit on the sugar, and subbed applesauce for half of the oil.  Added 1/2 cup of rolled oats for a bit more fibre, as well as 1/4 cup of grated carrot.  Got 12 tasty muffins.

Very tasty recipe and easy to make. I left out the nuts and reduced the sugar a little and made it into a loaf.  You can't even taste the zucchini but fairly moist. The loaf didn't last us the day!

These were great! I substituted mashed banana for half the oil, and used whole wheat flour for half the flour. Moist, delicious, and a little healthier than they would have been!

Very good recipe. I did use 1/2 cup oil as directed. I added a heaping tsp of cocoa powder and didn't use quite as many chocolate chips. I also did 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar. I also added a 1/4 tsp of baking powder. I just can't leave well enough alone. I served this to several people and they all loved it. I definitely recommend making.

I made it with raisins (soaked for a few minutes in warm water) instead of the chocolate chips, and raw sugar instead of white, in an attempt to be healthier. Next time I will try a little less sugar - this is my new go-to recipe. Delicious!

Yummy recipe!  Kids devoured them in minutes. I used coconut oil instead and added extra zucchini because who can grate 1 and 1/4 of a zucchini?  I made mini muffins instead and baked for 12-13 minutes. Delicious!

I made this as mini loaves as I found out when I looked in the cupboard..no cupcake liners! It is moist & delicious! I left out the nuts- didn't have any!  I didn't shred the zucchini but cut it into tiny little pieces( a small dice) & I would def make it again w/ the nuts.

Followed recipe exactly as described and they turned out great! Thanks to my bumper crop of zucchinis in my garden this year, my family, friends, church and co-workers are being blessed with zucchini muffins for every occasion! LOVE these muffins! Not like the heavy, dense zucchini bread, but nice and fluffy and just the right amount of sweet.

I will certainly make it again, but next time I think I will add a small amount of baking powder. I used pecans and almond milk. They were very good.

I made these for the first time yesterday and since they had received 5 stars, I went ahead and doubled the recipe!  The only substitution I made was instead of doubling the oil, I put 1/2 c oil and 1/2 c natural applesauce (no sugar added)  They are very moist.  So good I felt guilty eating one for breakfast!

Delicious! I made these the other night, and wow... I am impressed! The only change I made to the recipe was I substituted the 1 egg for 1/4 cup of applesauce. I always feel like applesauce make whatever I am making a little more moist. Love this recipe!

These muffins are absolutely spectacular! I wouldn't change anything about them, except I used a Salad Master to grate the zucchini, and next time I plan on doing a rough chop afterwards to make the zucchini pieces smaller. So delicious and moist!

Very good base muffin recipe.  Flavorful and easy to eat, and easy to make. Really 4.5 stars.  Very versatile, so you can adapt to your individual diet preference or what you happen to have on hand in the refrigerator and pantry. I substituted applesauce for oil and vanilla almond milk for regular, vegan mini chocolate chips, and omitted the nuts.  And per another's reviewer's suggestion added a little cocoa powder to the mix and grated the zucchini. I would reduce the sugar next time since my substitutions added  sweetness as well.  But I would never omit the cinnamon because it enhances the chocolate.  Will make this recipe again.

A few changes to recipe.  Buttermilk, grapeseed oil, pecans...added freshly ground nutmeg and cardamom.  All organic ingredients and I am very particular with brands.  These are hands down the best muffins.  Depending on how I want to serve I make this as cake or loaf pan.  Kids, husband, friends, coworkers love them always!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

These are fabulous and everyone who eats them wants the recipe.  I did make the following changes: I used half all-purpose flour and half whole wheat flour, I lowered the sugar to 1/2 cup , I used 1/4 cup vegetable oil and 1/4 cup applesauce, and I increased the chocolate chips to 3/4 cup.  Since I'm allergic to lemon juice I used vinegar instead.

These are so good, I double recipe and then freeze half of them for later use.

My husband and father in law want nothing to do with Zucchini and guess who chowed them down! Fantastic muffin.

This is an amazing muffin recipe!  I substituted buttermilk, used half white wheat and half all purpose flour, and left out the walnuts.  The texture is light and fluffy and they taste incredible.  Absolutely making these muffins again.  The recipe is a keeper.

OMG! DELICIOUS and will definitely use this recipe over and over. I doubled the batch and made 3 loaf breads. I slightly altered after doubling by reducing the sugar to only 1C, used 1/2 C oil and 1/2 C applesauce, used unsweetened almond milk instead of cow's milk and used almost 4C of zucchini because I can't use enough to keep up with our garden! Baking in loaf pans took about 45 minutes. Absolutely wonderful.

I followed the recipe with the exception of the walnuts only because my son is allergic. It didn't matter though, they were perfect! The zucchini makes these muffins so deliciously moist. If you peel the zucchini prior to shredding, the kids won't even know it's there ;-) Thank you!

These muffins are beyond delicious!!! I didn't have any milk so used plain yogurt and some water, used coconut oil instead of vegetable and like others suggested, used 1/2 cup of quick oats in place of the other 1/2 cup of flour. I also used 1/4 cup coconut sugar so I only had to use 1/2 cup of regular sugar. I can't imagine them being any better! They are so moist and the oats and walnuts give them a nice texture. I did 24 mini muffins and 6 regular and while they were all delish, I did enjoy the regular sized ones better as they were more moist.  Next time I am going to try subbing more of the coconut sugar and maybe some whole wheat or gluten free flour for some of the white flour. In any case, this is definitely a keeper!!

No substitutions. Made recipe as is. Super moist and great flavor. Perhaps a little bit overpowered by the chocolate chips, but overall great recipe! I will bake again for sure maybe just using less chocolate.

Best muffin recipe, a keeper. I used half whole wheat and half all purpose flour. I also adopted another reviewers tip and used 1/3 c sugar, 1/4 c oil and 1/2 cup Apple Sauce. From another I added nutmeg (1/2 TBS) with the cinnamon and also sprinkled some on top of a few before putting in oven. I also made a double batch (doubled everything except zucchini) because didn't have enough zucchini i added a banana ( tip from another reviewer). Delicious.

I’m just in love with this recipe! Every year when I get fresh zucchini from the garden I have to do muffins!! This year I got dark chocolate instead of milk chocolate, and for those who think zucchini overpowered the rest, just shredded them bigger, you’ll have 1cup but it won’t hide the rest of ingredients....

Delicious! My kids wanted chocolate chocolate chip, so I kept the recipe as-is and just stirred 1/4 cocoa powder wth 3 Tbsp of boiling water and let it cool for a moment and then mixed it in with the wet ingredients before adding them to the dry ingredients. Worked perfectly!

This was a great muffin.  I made a few small changes.  I omitted the nuts and used almond milk.  I substituted butterscotch chips instead of chocolate.  I increased the cinnamon and added nutmeg.  They were sweet and good.  Thank you for the great recipe.

I have made this twice in the past 2 days. The first time I followed the recipe exactly. It was delicious and the kids really enjoyed their breakfast muffins. The second time I wanted a richer more complex flavor, I used butter, raw brown sugar, orange juice instead of lemon juice and freshly grated nutmeg. It was amazing! Either way these are absolutely delicious. These muffins are very moist, don't be afraid of the batter being very thick,  they don't dry out the next day.

I doubled the recipe, and used 1 c WW flour and 2c AP flour. I also substituted 1/2 c plain yogurt for 1/2 the oil. This made enough batter for 12 regular, 24 mini muffins, and 1 small loaf of bread. Very easy and very tasty!!

Made these MANY TIMES!  My kids LOVE them.  I have one who goes to a nut free school so we omit the nuts so that he can bring them for lunch too and another kiddo with an egg allergy so I replace each egg with 1/4 cup of unsweetened applesauce.  They turn out great every time.  Highly recommend!

Great muffins for the kids!  As others did, I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup and replaced 1/4 cup of oil with 1/2 cup of  all natural applesauce.

I used 1 cup of all purpose flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and also used applesauce instead of oil so that they met the nutritional guidelines for the bake sale at my daughter's school. They turned out moist and delicious and were a big hit with the kids! I will make these again for sure and keep them for ourselves!

Amazing!!! So moist and delicious. My family can't  have chocolate so I didn't use the chocolate chips. I did 1/4 cup of applesauce and 1/4 cup oil, instead of 1/2 cup of oil and added some coconut. They turned out so well!

Its moist in the inside and crunchy in the outside. I have substitute half cup of flour into self-raising wholemeal flour as i want some height with my muffin. I also substituted half of the vegetable oil with coconut oil. It turn out nicely. the only issue is that i have got 9 muffins instead of 12 muffins with these ingredients.

I added a bit more chocolate chips to mine (I'm a chocoholic!) , and did half a cup of shredded zucchini. I thought 1 cup might make the zucchini overpowering. It turned out great; very delicious! :)

These are wonderful muffins-- Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!!! I have made them three times so far, and once or twice with gluten free flour. They have turned out deliciously each time. Once, I made them with raisins instead of chocolate chips. Amazing! They smell SO GOOD coming out of the oven when you make them with raisins and also are tasty. I gave some of the raisin ones to some friends and a thank-you, and they loved them. My mom enjoyed these so much that she even asked me to make them for her birthday breakfast.  They may become a birthday tradition for her! they contained zucchini.  When I announced the third time around that I was making them, my sister was shocked to realize that they contained zucchini.

Moist. The zucchini isn't even noticeable. It just adds to the moistness.

Excellent! Have made at least half a dozen times now with consistently delicious results. The batter is very thick, more like a dough. I have also subbed half the oil with apple sauce without any sacrifice on taste!

The only change I made was omitted the walnuts. These were perfect, my whole family loved them!

Update :: I made these again and made these changes -- replace milk with almond milk, replace oil with 1/2 cup unsweetened apple sauce, and instead of the sugar, I used 1/4 cup + 2 Tbs of Splenda sugar blend.

SO SO good.  I didn't even miss the oil or full amount of sugar at all!

I switched it up a bit, I added a teaspoon if freshly ground nutmeg. I saw a review that said the zucchini was too powerful and I have to disagree I, personally, next time would use a little more zucchini. The consistancy, texture and flavor were great! My boys loved them.

Needed a low sugar recipe for my gestational diabetes that would use up some of my garden zucchini but also taste delicious. Followed another user's recommendations and used all whole wheat flour, only 1/3 cup sugar (I used brown), and instead of the oil recommended, I used 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup oil. Went heavy on the zucchini. They turned out so moist and delicious and just sweet enough to give me the fix I needed.

This is a great recipe.  Very light and moist muffins.  They are quite sweet as well.  But I changed the recipe, of course, using whole wheat flour 1 1/4 C with a 1/4 C bran, 1/2 C sugar with 1/4 C stevia.   A few more chocolate chips than strictly necessary, perhaps.  It makes a very moist batter, don't over stir.  Made 24 largish mini-muffins - perfect for snacks.

I made these for a youth camp and they LOVED them!  I have also made them at home and substituted applesauce for white sugar.  I adjusted the milk down slightly to compensate for the moisture in the applesauce.  One of my favourite recipes.

They turned out delicious, I doubled recipe,  so I could freeze some for my daughters morning snack at school.... I also substituted he veg oil with 1/2 applesauce and 1/2 melted coconut oil.    However, I used cupcake liners and the muffins really stuck to the liner leaving 1/4 of the bottom of the muffin in liner... So might need to also spray paper cupcake liners.

I didn't have chocolate chips or walnuts so added about 1/3 cup shredded carrots. And I used 3/4 ground oats and 3/4 flour just for texture. These muffins were so moist and full of flavor.  My new favorite way to use zucchini.. I will be making more very soon.. the second time I made it o doubled the batch, but also cut the sugar... not quite the same flavor but still very good. Everyone loved them. My mom even asked me to make some for hr for work snacks..

I made this recipe as written, minus the nuts. The BEST flavour and consistency I've ever had in a muffin. I don't drain my zucchini after its shredded. Helps with the moistness. We love these so much, I've made them 2 days in a row! Our garden is bursting with zucchini and this is another great use for it. 100% recommend this recipe.

Awesome! I used 1/2 the sugar, applesauce in place of the oil and bread flour because that is what I had on hand. Very moist and delicious. Made a double batch for freezing. Yumm-o!!

Delicious as written. I leave out the nuts so the kids can take them to school.  Be sure to toss the grated zucchini in the dry ingredients before mixing it all together to keep the zucchini from clumping! I've made these at least 10 times :)

These muffins were excellent and by far the best overall muffins ever!  I did use pecans instead of walnuts (personal preference); I used 1/4 butter and 1/4 oil (I know!!) instead of the 1/2 oil and I forgot the lemon juice. We could not taste the zucchini at all and we found them moist and incredibly delicious.  Thank you for sharing.

I did healthily these some and they were still amazing!  I used coconut oil instead of vegetable, substituted almost all the sugar with stevia (all but about 1/3 cup), and I used whole wheat flour for half of the flour.

I made double batches two ways and both were stellar: 1) Swapped out 1/3 of the flour for whole wheat, used regular chocolate chips, and no nuts. 2) Swapped out 1/3 of the flour for whole wheat, added 1/4 cup cocoa powder, added 1/4 milk, and no chocolate chips.

I've made this recipe for a couple of years and it's definitely my go to for zucchini muffins.  Great as is.  When I've substituted the oil with applesauce the muffins still taste great, BUT stick to muffin liners.

You can delete the chocolate chips and just sprinkle the tops of the muffins with cinnamon sugar.

I made these for my preschool Sunday school class. I made mini muffins and the recipe made 38 of them. I baked them for 10 minutes. I omitted cinnamon and I added about 2 tsp of cocoa after the first batch, so I ended up with some chocolate and some vanilla muffins. I tried the vanilla and it was soft, moist, and delicious!

This recipe was fantastic!!! Very moist and light. I baked mine in a bundt pan to make it easier. The batter was a bit thick so I added about 1/8c more milk once all the ingredients were mixes together since the zucchini does add some water to it. I'm adding this to my recipe book, this one is definitely a keeper!  Thanks for sharing!!!

These turned out  wonderfully!  I made two "healthy" substitutions.--1/2 cup of whole wheat flour, and 1/4 cup of applesauce for oil. I peeled the zucchini so the kids wouldn't see any green in the muffins!  They loved them. All four fussy kids gobbled them up! Great recipe!

I used dark chocolate chips and course salt to add a sweet/salty flavor. The sweetness wasn't overwhelming so I may increase sugar next time. Definitely using this one again.

These are delicious! Just made them and enjoying them warm! Only changes I made: substituted half the oil for applesauce, and added more choc chips! Skipped the walnuts. Yum!!!! Will definitely make it again.

REAL TALK: I really dislike zucchini as a vegetable. A lot. And sadly, I've never had a truly mind-blowing zucchini bread or muffin.  Good, but not fantastic.

But these were AWESOME.  I did make two, small, changes.  First, I replaced one third of the white flour with whole-wheat flour. Healthier AND it could add more structure to a muffin already being weighed down with lots of zucchini. Second, I omitted the walnuts because nuts in muffins are EW! (said a-la Jimmy Fallon).   Love these so much! THANKS for sharing the recipe!!

Amazing!!! Everyone in the family loved this recipe. Switched out chocolate chips for cinnamon chips and left out the nuts (nut allergy). It is such an easy recipe and so delicious. This will definitely make it's way to our table often.

These were perfect!  I made mini muffins and adjusted the time.  I did use less sugar  (1/4 cup) because I wanted to use them for breakfast.  They were still sweet due to the chocolate chips (I used Enjoy Life mini chips). My kids ate ALL of them!  Very moist and great tasting.

These were awesome! I made exactly as the recipe is written except I had no walnuts so those were omitted and I had no vegetable oil so I used 1/2 cup of browned butter instead. Amazing muffins.

I doubled the recipe, substituted the flour with 2 parts white rice flour, 1 part tapioca flour, and 1 part sorghum flour. Substituted 1/2 of the sugar with plain applesauce. And voilà, beautifully delicious reduced sugar gluten free zucchini muffins.

These were pretty good.  I tried to making them even more healthy by substituting applesauce for oil and also cut down the chocolate chips.  I think next time I make them I will maybe add some oil to them, otherwise they get a very chewy type texture.

Great muffins! Only change I made (I do this with any muffin recipe) was to substitute unsweetened applesauce for the oil. I also left out the nuts.

This recipe is a hit in my house. I've tried it exactly how it is laid out, with whole wheat flour, with raisins, etc. Every time, they're great. My picky toddler kids and husband enjoy them.

Just tastes sweet.  I probably should have added some other spices as some people suggested, but as I am not a nutmeg fan I was hoping they would taste good with just the cinnamon.  Disappointed.

Super easy and turned out awesome. My kids said it was the best muffin ever. I left out the nuts, my kids don't like them. I did one batch with white flour and another with whole wheat. The whole wheat was not as good, but still enjoyable. I did sub non-fat plain yogurt for the applesauce though, both times, as I had no applesauce.  And in the white flour version I added 1tbsp of ground flax seed for a but more nutritional value.
Easy base that could be changed up with other add-ins. Definitely a keeper.

My kids loved these!  I went 1/2 & 1/2 with the oil & applesauce to cut down on the fat.

This recipe is fantastic! Only substitute I made was applesauce in place of the oil. The texture is wonderful and the taste is unmatched to any other zucchini muffin I've tried! Thanks for the great recipe.

These muffins are delicious!!! I am not much of a baker so I followed the recipe to the letter. The only thing I substituted was gluten free flour rather than regular flour. The rest of my family gobbled them up too and they don't even have to eat gluten free :) I bought 4 zucchinis because I wasn't sure how many shredded I would need to make a cup so I think I will make a few more batches of these tonight and freeze them! Thanks for sharing this recipe!!!!

This recipe was GREAT!  I did have to make a couple changes, but only because of allergies to milk,eggs and tree nuts.  I substituted almond milk for the milk, and in place of eggs I used 2 TBS of flax meal/chia seed mix, combined with 4 TBS water and let set for a few minutes. I just left out the walnuts and kept the rest of the recipe the same.  All of my kids loved them, even my picky son who hates most everything!

These were so good and moist!  I did not use zucchini but cucumbers.  Yes I had a bumper crop and have been using shredded cucumbers in place of zucchini in recipes.  Didn't have cinnamon so used half the amount of nutmeg instead, regular chocolate chips and chopped pecans.  Doubled the recipe and used 2 c. all purpose flour and 1 cup 12 grain flour and they turned out just fantastic.  Nice little crunch and extra fibre.  Will make again and again - with zucchini or cucumbers.

I make these as mini muffins (without the nuts, with whole wheat flour, double the zucchini for extra nutrition) and my kids, 4 and 6, gobble them up for breakfast without fail. I double or triple the batch and freeze the extras, bagging them 5 at a time in ziplock bags. Pull them out of the freezer first thing in the morning and they at ready to eat by the time we leave the house. So so so yummy--thank you!!

These were really really good.  I left out the walnuts and used additional chocolate chips in their place.  These were best warm straight from the oven...I couldn't stop myself at just one!  I have a lot of shredded zucchini in my freezer right now so these will definitely be made again!

This was great!  I subbed applesauce for the oil, and used dark chocolate chips and only 1/2 C sugar.  They were so very good, my boys fight over them, so of course, I make a double batch each time!

Didn't change a thing (other than the fact I didn't add nuts) and they are wonderful! Not too sweet with the chocolate chips, just right! Will definitely be making these again.

Yum! I substituted unsweetened applesauce for the oil, used 3/4 cup regular size semi sweet chocolate chips and omitted the nuts (allergic). I took them to work and everyone loved them! This is a keeper! Really great warmed up! Might try using whole wheat flour next time.

This recipe was great just the way it is.  Very moist and tasty muffins!  I didn't put nuts in due to my kids, but that would be good!  I did need to add an additional splash of milk.  I think it just depends on how moist your zucchini is.  I packed the zucchini into a measuring cup.

Fantastic! Children and husband loved them. Per some suggestions, I made the following adjustments:  substituted 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce for half of the oil, Used 1 cup regular flour and 1/4 cup whole wheat flour and 1/4 cup flax seed meal. Also substituted 1/2 cup brown sugar for the white sugar. They were plenty sweet without the extra. I suggest grating your zucchini on paper towels and blotting to get rid of some of the moisture before blending. I will be making another batch tomorrow because they have already disappeared!

I really enjoyed making these! However, I'm not sure if it was just the vegetable oil I used but it seems that's all I can taste in these muffins. Maybe need to try the recipe with a different oil, or less?

5+ Star Rating! Excellent Recipe! They were a hit at a family reunion that I made them for. Instead of making 12 muffins I made 24 mini muffins and they were still delicious. However I am not going to use vegetable oil any more, cause I heard it's bad for you. So I am going to use Canola oil the next time I bake these delicious little muffins.

MMMMMMmmmmmm!  So good.  I have made these as muffins and they are good.  Today I made bread.  I just put in all in the loaf pan, kept the temp the same and just started watching it closely after 35 min.  It took probably about 50 min till the toothpick came out clean.  It is just as good!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I have a 16 year old that NEVER eats veggies.  He grabbed one of these, took a bite, and grabbed another before he finished the first one.  He has no idea there is zucchini in them.  I used 1/4 cup of oil and 1/4 of applesauce.  I used semi sweet regular sized chips.  I sprayed the top of the muffin pan after I put the paper liners in the pan and they had perfect muffin tops that did not stick.

I make these all the time with the over abundance of zucchini I get from my garden. They are gobbled up the minute they come out of the oven! I usually double the recipe just so they last more than 10 minutes. I make the recipe exactly as is and they have come out perfect every time.

Moist and yummy! Added a bit less sugar and added 1/4 oil(ran out) and added 1/2 apple sauce unsweetened. Need time might sneak in flax seed and sub flour with whole wheat!

I like this recipe a lot as a base. I used white whole wheat flour instead of all purpose, included ground chia seeds in organic coconut milk for the milk (I used a little more milk)I substituted truvia baking blend for the sugar,I cut the oil to a 1/4 cup and used a 1/3 cup of applesauce and I threw in some dark cocoa powder. I also sprinkled some whole chia seeds on the top before baking. I omitted the cinnamon and the lemon juice accidentally sort of. I also was too lazy to add the nuts but I used pecans the first time I made them. This is the second time making them. Next time I will add the nuts. Very satisfying. Very tasty!

Made exactly as written.  Very tasty.  A bit oily on the bottom, but it won't stop me from making them again.  My finicky seven year old enjoyed them, too.

This recipe is great, I didn't change anything but if you're not a milk drinker, I think using soy or almond milk wouldn't make a big difference. I only added more chocolate chips because I love chocolate!

Muffins were great & the kids didn't realize they were eating a veg.  We made a dairy free version: sweetened vanilla coconut milk (so halved the vanilla called for), dairy free chocolate chips.  I left out the nuts.  The bottoms of the muffin cups were a little greasy-- maybe less oil next time.

Gluten free version…. I make these muffins gluten free by using All Purpose Gluten free All Purpose baking mix (Arrowhead Mills) instead of using flour. They are great and my kids (tweens) eat them up.

Made it for Pre-K "Z" day - had to do a second batch for dessert they are so great!  Ran out of chocolate chips for the second batch but it still was a success for two little ones.  Wonder how we could do it dairy free in the future

Have used this recipe probably 20 times! My kids love these (they are 10 and 12)  so I make them as a quick breakfast for them to grab before school. To make them a bit healthier, I use 1/4 cup applesauce plus 1/4 cup veg oil instead of using a full 1/2 cup of oil. Turn out great wig skim milk.

I didn't change a thing on this recipe. I made it for my kids snack day at school tomorrow and gave them each a sample muffin to taste test as I am on a cleanse and can't try myself. They smelled delicious... My boys gobbled their muffins up in record time! I look forward to making these again next week so I can try them as my kids made them look so tasty!

Love this recipe, they taste great! I don't even use the cinnamon, lemon juice, or walnuts and they're wonderful. I make them at least once every other week as a dessert or sweet-tooth snack :)

Delicious! Used regular chocolate chips instead of mini, and no walnuts, and they turned out great. I brought them to Sunday school and everybody loved them! I'll definitely make this one again.

Good recipe. I cut the sugar to 1 cup. Used 1 cup of all purpose flour, 1/2 cup of wheat germ and 1/2 cup of rolled oats. Added 1 rather large banana and put a 1/4 cup of cocoa powder as well. 1/4 cup oil, 1/4 cup applesauce. 1/2 cup milk. Very moist and light.

These are good but I find they need a little more pep. I added 1 tsp of cloves, 1/4 cup of chia seeds, omitted the walnuts and sprinkled coarse sugar on top. Next time I will add the walnuts, 1/2 tsp of nutmeg and 1/2 tsp ginger.

Absolutely the best chocolate zucchini recipe I've tried. I've made it three ways and all are delicious and moist. The first time I only used half a cup of coconut sugar (instead of regular sugar) and I used unsweetened applesauce instead of oil and i omitted the nuts. The second time I tried it with regular sugar, but just half a cup and omitted the nuts. The third time I did the same as the second except added 1/4 C hemp seeds instead of nuts.

I made these this morning because I had a huge zucchini from the garden I had to use up pronto. I did tweak the recipe a bit. This is what I changed: whole wheat flour instead of all purpose bleached flour, butter instead of oil, I probably used 1/2-3/4 c. of milk & half and half, instead of sugar I used Stevia in the Raw (1st time I ever used it), when I cracked my egg there were 2 yolks inside so I used it all and pecans instead of walnuts, and I also added about 1/2 c. of more zucchini. The batter looked very thick so that's why I added more milk but next time I'll use 1/3-1/2 c. only. They came out a little under done (probably cause of the extra milk) so after 25 mins I baked them for 10 mins more. I love the texture, they are not too sweet, the bread part is not sweet in my opinion but the chocolate chips take care of that. Overall the kids & husband loved them & I did too. I will be making these again. Awesome way to sneak in veggies so I'll probably add some carrots or even pureed broccoli & maybe try apple sauce instead of butter in the future. Great recipe & I love taking bits & pieces from all the reviews. Bottoms ended up a little too moist so they stuck to the paper but we loved them.

Love them!  I substituted the all-purpose flour with spelt flour (same amount), used melted butter instead of vegetable oil, and for sugar I used half white and half coconut sugar.  They are slightly sweet, next time I will cut the sugar in half.  Great recipe!  Will add this one to my favourites :)

I used 1.5 c of summer squash instead of zucchini, only 1/2 c sugar, whole wheat flour, and 1 c choco chips. Marvelous! Very moist, flavor is just right, dripping with chocolate yet the batter not too sweet. I'll be making these again!

Loved, loved, loved!  Halved recipe and made mini-muffins as it's just DH & myself.  Out of lemon & nuts, but aside from that made as directed.  Came out with 16 tall mini-muffins (used my silicone molds) and they turned out beautifully.  Great with a tall glass of cold milk.  Thank you so much for recipe!

Absolutely delicious! I doubled the recipe, using regular chocolate chips instead of mini, finely chopped almonds for the nuts, and an additional 1/2 tsp. baking powder. The muffins were light and moist and yummy. Thank you!

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars even though I changed the recipe around to make it healthier and lower in calories. I've been watching my weight and craving for sweets at the same time. I made the following changes: 1 cup whole wheat flour, 1/2 cup all purpose flour, 1/4 cup "I Can't Believe it's not Butter" (all I had at the time), 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce, 1/4 cup almond milk (also all I had), omitted the walnuts because I'm not a nuts fan, and I completely forgot about the lemon juice. It still turned out amazing!!! Tasted great! I have no doubt that had I followed this recipe 100%, it would be absolutely amazing.

Love this recipe....next time I will try swapping out some of the white flour for wheat - just didn't have any on-hand.  I used dark chocolate chips and made them as mini-muffins (baked them for 12-15 mins).  Yum!

Super tasty! Not too sweet but the chocolate chips make it perfect. I'm at high altitude so the batter ended up pretty dry. I increased to 2/3 cup milk and added about 1/3 cup apple sauce. They made the most delectable, moist muffins. yummy!

Moist. Firm. Delicious! The lemon makes the milk like buttermilk.  You don't taste it in the recipe.  This one is a winner!

These are very yummy!  The only change I made was using apple sauce instead of oil and substituting whole wheat flour for all-purpose flour.  Just wanted to make them a bit healthier.  My kids can't stop eating them!

Followed the recipe 100% and made with my 2-year old daughter.  Easy and tasty!  Chocolate's a nice change from normal zucchini bread.

My 2, 4, and 6 year old kids LOVED them, as well as an entire class of preschoolers. A winner in my book for sure.

these are amazing! I doubled the batch to make 24. I had a huge zucchini from my garden that I peeled the skin off of and then used a peeler to make strips and then diced that. I didn't use walnuts and don't miss them. These are AWESOME! My kids love em too.

recipe was simple and delicious!!!! my kids ate them up fast! i did leave out the lemon juice and walnuts though..... not a fan of lemon flavored baked goods and no one likes nuts in stuff except for me.
