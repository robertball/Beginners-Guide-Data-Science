Great football food!  Added onions and peppers ( or salsa ) , extra hot sauce, and extra cheese. Baked 8 min for crispy shells and they hole up beautifully when cut in wedges! Sour cream on top, yum!

It was alright.. Not something I would make again. But I would suggest it if your wanting something for a snack. NOT good for dinner AT ALL. Thanks. (MY opinion only, someother may/may not like it)

I tweaked this a lot. All I did was put chicken breast into crockpot, added a jar of salso and a can of cream of chicken and let it cook all day bout 6 hours. Tasted great and the kids loved it!
