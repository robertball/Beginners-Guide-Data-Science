I'm not surprised with the reviews. And I apologize on behalf of this site for those who tried it as posted. The ingredients are WRONG as shown here. I contacted the editors but I guess they couldn't change the recipe in their system. Here's the basic rule of thumb ... you always want to have twice as much coconut oil as you have agave nectar. Otherwise it *will* burn. Those reviews are right if they followed the recipe as posted here. Other oils could be used, but coconut has a very high smoke point and is a very stable oil so it's definitely the best choice for oils.

Added a tsp. of salt.  Also, spray pam on your pot before you add the coconut oil--This is one STICKY recipe.  This definitely TASTED healthier than movie popcorn, but then again, I like the fatty taste of buttery popcorn. :)  Needless to say, this was an...interesting recipe to try, and I might repeat the experience, but only if I feel guilty about eating fatty popcorn again.  ;P

I tried this and it burned.  It would also stop popping when I took it off the heat to shake it constantly so I would put it back on the heat to get it going and then start shaking again.  I was disappointed because I thought it sounded great, a healthier version of kettle corn.

I didn't care for this recipe, even with the recommendations, and an awful waste of ingredients. I don't usually write harsh reviews but this one left me with a ridiculous, inedible mess that is going to be a nightmare to clean. I think there must be an easier way because off the bat, the combination of ingredients sounds really good. My thoughts are that you should probably pop the popcorn in coconut oil alone, and then toss it in a mixture of coconut oil, agave and chipotle pepper. When you consider this recipe process logically, sugar caramelizes and eventually burns when heat is applied. The directions seem to be all wrong, but I have yet to try out the method I suggested...lots of mess to clean up first!

I was really excited about this. I kept the original recipe, but increased the oil to 6 TBS so to double the agave syrup (as recommended by the original poster). 2 TBS chipotle seemed like a lot, so I just put in 1 1/2 TBS. I was a little scared during the cooking process, but it turned out fine. Guess what? My mouth might be on fire. Way, way, way too much chili powder. I might try this again because I just love the concept, but I'd cut the chili powder down to 1-2 tsp, if that. Yeowch! Also, I used vegetable oil.

Has anybody else tried this yet?  It sounded really great-but  we ended up with a major mess as the mixture burnt and caused a lot of smoke, even tho we used less popcorn and had the heat at med low setting, while agitating the pot constantly.   Had to call the Fire Alarm company to tell them  everything was under control.

Delish! Used 6 tbsp of coconut oil, 3 tbsp agave, 1/2 cup kernels. Added black pepper in place of chili peppers- I didn't have any on hand.

I read the review that said you must have 2:1 ratio of coconut oil to agave and tried that and it so burned, granted I used my own mixture of spices so that may have had something to do with the burning.  What I did that worked is cooked the popcorn in about 3Tbs coconut oil and melted the other 3Tbs with the agave and poured it on like you would butter and the seasoning like you would salt and toss.  I didn't have Chipotle so I used 1 tsp each chili powder and smoked paprika, and 2tsp of garlic (my husband lives garlic).
