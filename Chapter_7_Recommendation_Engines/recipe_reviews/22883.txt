Some advice for the person who added 7 tsp. cornstarch.. Cornstarch only thickens when it comes to a boil so that's probably what the problem was.

Very easy and ingredients are usually on hand.
Good taste but I added 7 tsp. of cornstarch and it was still very thin.  I made it to go on cinnamon bread pudding.  Very tasty.  Will make again and add more cornstarch.

I had chunks of cornstarch when I made it so I had to strain out the cornstarch.

I made this according to the recipe and also found that is was very thin, even after letting it boil.  I added quite a bit more cornstarch and it was great.  Great taste and consistancy will definately make again.
