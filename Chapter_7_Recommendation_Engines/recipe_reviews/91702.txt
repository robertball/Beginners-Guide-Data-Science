This turned out absolutely wonderful.  I followed the recipe exactly, but I also added some coconut flakes on the top.  If you like key lime pie and cheesecake this is a must try!

These were excellent! Super easy to make, quick (for a cheesecake product), didn't crack as all my other cheesecake endevors have, and, above all else, tasted fantastic! I even forgot the coconut in the crust and it was still great, though I can't wait to try it with. Overall fantastic recipe.

Loved this recipe!  Fast and easy to make, and tastes wonderful.  I didn't even use any of the toppings.

So very good...the coconut adds the little special touch.  I used regular limes for the juice, but think that key limes would be very good as well.  Very easy to make.  Made a batch for a Christmas party and cut them into bite-sized pieces.  Very-honest-when-it-comes-to-recipes-husband said they there very good.  Fresh berries on top or a berry sauce to drizzle over would be superb.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe was very easy for a cheesecake type desert.  I add a teaspoon of lime zest and it was perfect!
