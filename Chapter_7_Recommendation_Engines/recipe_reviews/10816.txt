i know nothing about bakestones. Nothing. I thought it was a cookie that you fry on the stove. Wrongo. Its more like a funky pancake. Truth be known, i didn't care for it much. And i've got alot left over in the fridge.. maybe the recipe could use a little elaboration?

Bakestones are really just a larger welsh cake. Eat with a cup of tea with your feet up.
