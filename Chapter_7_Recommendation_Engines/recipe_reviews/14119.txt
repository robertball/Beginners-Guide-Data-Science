the problem with some people saying this is bland, because it needed spicing up.. should then spice it up,,, when you read what goes into a recipe and it sounds like something else should be added, then add it. I never take a recipe and follow it just exact, inless it sounds like nothing else would make it taste better, if you like things spicy ,put something spicy in . I use this web site for ideas, and this one was a great idea

THIS is the way I've had potato pancakes since I was a kid.  In fact, I'd never had the uncooked shredded kind until I was an adult.  I guess it was thanks to Mom's frugality.  The way these are put together is a little thick for my taste.  You can mix the cheese right in if you want and make them the thickness of regular pancakes.  I like the fact that they have a higher amount of crispiness that way.  I also like to mince up some onion into mine.

There's a lot I learned for this, but its a great recipe with some help!  I used loaded instant potatos after reading other reviews.  I started with the heat on 2, then got tired of waiting longer than 10 minutes and cranked it to 4... went much faster.  Don't flip the cakes early or you will be scraping them back together in lumpy pancake pieces. (check by lifting a piece to see if they are brown) I used a square flat pan so I rotated them halfway through to keep them evenly browned.  Just keep this in mind when you do this recipe!!!

Very, very, good!!  I took advice and added extra garlic powder and 2 small green onions.  I also just added the cheese to the mixture instead of adding cheese on top and a second layer of potatoe mixture.  Because I fixed these as part of breakfast, and had fried bacon, I fried them in some of the bacon grease.  Not very healthy, but VERY tasty!!  The cakes picked up just enough of the bacon flavor.  My husband was still talking about them the next day! Thanks!

These pancakes are light and fluffy.  I followed the recipe exactly.  The only thing to remember is to have your mashed potatoes at room temperature.  They cook very quickly.

I thought this was going to be a great recipe for left over mashed potatoes, but I found it to be very, very bland.  It would be really easy to make it taste better if you mix in some of the things you would normally put on a baked potato.  Green onions or bacon bits, etc.  I doubt I would waste my mashed potatoes this way again.  No one in my family like them!

This was great!  So great that I took a picture of it!  :P  It was super easy to make with leftover mashed potatoes.  The first time I made it, I made fresh mashed potatoes and the cakes were difficult to form because the potatoes were still warm.  So I really recommend using leftovers.  I only ended up using leftover potatoes, cheese, and oil to make my cakes.  And it still tastes great!  Thanks for the recipe.

If you omitted the cheese you would have my grand mother's recipe, except she called them potato pancakes. She fried her's in bacon drippings and it gave them great flavor. I make mine with the cheese but I like to mix it in. I also use granulated garlic(1/2 teaspoon) and a pinch of cayenne. Sometimes I'll do them by the teaspoon so that they make little mini cakes and serve them as an appetizer. You can do a lot of variations with this recipe. Omit the garlic, add 1/2 cup bacon bits and 1/4 cup finely chopped chives, serve with a dollop of sour cream and you have baked potato cakes. Or you can use a different cheese, or herbs. The possibilities are only limited by your imagination.

I loved this recipe to use up leftover mashed potatoes from Thanksgiving.  I altered the recipe slightly by adding about 1 tsp cayenne pepper, 1/2 can of corn, 1/2 c chopped red bell pepper and using crumbled bleu cheese instead of cheddar.  Serve with meatloaf or bratwurst and beans!

My Dad used to make potato cakes, but until now I haven't had any for almost 30 years. I had some left over mashed potatoes, so I tried this recipe. It was fabulous! Instead of putting the cheese in the middle of the cakes, I mixed it in with the potatoes. The cook time (10 minutes per side over low heat) delivered a crisp outside. I also added garlic powder, onion powder and parsly. You can easily adapt this recipe to whatever flavors you and your family prefer. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

I added the cheese to the potato mixture and played around with the seasoning....one time with onion and another with bacon. I cooked each side for about 4 minutes on medium heat.

A fabulous idea for many of today's cooks who need to apply FRUGAL ideas in the kitchen! Use less butter for frying and use a non stick skillet, make any kind of cream sauce (we like cheese, fire roasted tomatoes, chilies etc for a southwest treat; white cheddar and cheese with English mustard to go w/ham) or chop up and saute your vegetables first then mix and fry. YOu can even brown them then place on a sheet and bake on 425F until crispy! Thin or thick, this base recipe is one of the best for texture. I grew up on these as did my parents and grandparents before me. Any meal plain or fancy can be built around these!

Oh My! These were wonderful! I altered it slytly because I am a lazy cook-I mixed the cheese in with the potatoes right away and I used a bit more butter to fry them in, may-be a tablespoon and a half. Only down fall is in order to get that wonderful crispy crust you need to be patient. Really, don't try to flip them too soon.

Growing up in West Virginia, my mom used to use the leftover mashed potatoes to make potatoes cakes and I couldn't remember what all she used, so I looked it up. I improvised the recipe some but they still came out delicious. I had just a little under 4 cups of mashed potatoes leftover( i don't peel my potatoes when I make mashed potatoes and the skin added in made them even better), so I added an extra egg and used 3/4 cup of flour. The mashed potatoes already had enough salt so I omitted the garlic salt and added about a 1/2 tsp garlic powder, added 1/4 tsp. black pepper, used a pinch of salt and added dried minced onions. I used 4 tablespoons of butter and ended up adding vegetable oil, the butter made the outside a little to salty for me, so next time I think I'll just use vegetable oil. I cooked them over medium heat on an electric stove and it still took about 10 minutes on each side, but I also used a big pan. I adjusted the heat higher to get it heated up then turned it back down to medium and used medium heat and the next line up past it. They browned up very nicely and I got 7 good sized cakes out of it. My fiancee loved them but said they needed more garlic, but he loves a lot of garlic,it had just enough for my taste. I will make this recipe again whenever I have leftover mashed potatoes.

I've made these for my husband a couple times and he loves them.  They're easy to make and very versatile.  I can sub whatever seasonings and cheeses I happen to have on hand that I need to use up.

We loved these!  I added some french fried onions and a slice of ham to the chesse stuffing.  There are so many ways you can dress this one up.  It will be a stand-by in our house.

This tastes just like the potatoe cakes my Daddy used to fix us on rare occasions when I was a kid.  I've tried a million times to replicate it, but always end up with greasy mush all over the skillet.  I thought this tasted awesome.  And my kids who can't stand mashed potatoes (which is why we always have left overs) just asked me for seconds!

Use a nonstick pan and extra butter! I had a hard time getting this out of the pan...  I used parmesan cheese and I liked the flavor better. Also could mix some leftover canned corn kernels into the batter. Pretty good use for leftovers!

Mom made this for us growing up. VERY comforting. Mom used garlic powder instead of garlic salt and added chopped green onion. I make these now for my kids with a side of sour cream and salsa. Excellent for breakfast with eggs and choriso.

I love this. It reminds me of the potato cakes my mom fixed when I was little. It is also a great way to use up leftover mashed potatoes. I added a little garlic powder and about a quarter cup of chopped onion, and mixed it all together before cooking.

This is such a neat idea to use up mashed potatoes. I read the reviews and added some spices to the mashed potato mixture and chopped up some sausage and mixed it in there too. It was really yummy.

I actually didn't have any leftover mashed potatoes so I just whipped up a batch, seasoned and chilled them.  This recipe was really good but you must be patient and let them cook, let the outside get a nice crunch to it.  The potatoes I made were delicious (lots of garlic), but the end taste was nowhere near as flavorful, and then I realized I didn't account for the addition of extra ingredients...derp!  Overall very good, very filling as well.  Should be fun to try different cheeses and seasonings.

I made this recipe exactly as written, which everyone should do if they plan to review any recipe. It was absolutely wonderful! I could have added an extra pinch of garlic salt, but they were really good. They tasted just like the ones my mom made when I was growing up. This is definitely a recipe I will use again and again. Thanks, Dave, for sharing the recipe.

Like many reviewers said, this is a great base recipe. I made it as is but I think I would definitely try some different spices next time. I wasn't crazy about the garlic powder with this. It was a bit overpowering I think. I might add in sautéed onions next time with a little Italian seasoning.

What a great idea for left over mashed potatoes.  The flour helps to bind them together.   The only thing that I changed is that I used a tablespoon of potato, flattened it out, then some cheese, then some potato on top, and flattened them out into small medallions and fried them in some butter.  My family raved!

This is good, But I put 2 eggs instead of one. I also added chives and a half of a small onion finely choped and extra garlic powder (I used the powder instead of the garlic salt). My daughter didn't care for them. But I that there easy to make and cook. You can add any herb's and spicy's you like to make it more yummy and heathly! Enjoy!

oddly this recipe didn't come up when i simply searched for potato cake from the all recipes search engine. though it did come up when i searched on yahoo. after reading some reviews i mixed the cheese into the batter, and added some parsley and black pepper, i also fried up some chopped bacon the second time i made these and mixed it in. they came out so much better and i ate them with a little bit of sour cream. almost like a baked potato for breakfast!

I actually made a version of this yesterday without having seen this recipe. I used leftover Roasted Garlic Mashed Potatoes, from this site, and I didn't use any flour, and they turned out great--nice and crispy on the outside. I also grated just a little bit of cheese over the top, since the potatoes had Parmesan in them. I think the key is to use mashed potatoes that already have a lot of flavor.

Warmed potatoes just a little so they can are mixable.  You can mix cheese in before pan frying.  No need to layer. Added seasonings.

We've been making potato cakes for years out of nothing but leftover mashed potatoes. No flour, no eggs, nothing like that. Just the mashed potatoes. I wanted to try something different though so I picked out this recipe thinking the eggs and flour would make an already good concept even better. It was just okay though. Thumbs up for the idea, though. But I'll stick to our plain potato ways.

This is the third time I've made this and each time I've spiced them up a little more. To make them not so bland, I added seasoning salt, more sweet onion and a BIG tbs CREAMY (not the really hot kind) horseradish sauce; took out the egg and used less flour.  I now have them the way I REALLY like.  I think the horseradish sause and leaving out the egg makes the difference.  Not bland at all!

I started with 2 eggs, added 1/8 tsp each of garlic powder and onion powder, 1/4 c flour, and 1 c shredded mozzarella and Colby cheese, mixed well. To this I added about 2 c leftover mashed potatoes. I used 2 garlic butters for dipping (I saved them from pizza delivery) on the frying pan and cooked them till crispy. I should have seasoned it more, but it didn’t stop me from eating 2 c of potato cakes in one sitting! It’s a good starting point for me to improvise from since I’ve never made potato pancakes before. Thanks for the recipe!

Can't mess up potatoes, and this recipe was just ok....But I had preferred not to use eggs in the recipe. It was too smooth a batter and did not make for a good crust.

I am so excited to find this recipe! Except for the cheese and garlic, it is same as the one my mom made 50-60 yrs ago and I have lost it since! Thank you thank you.  We used to put leftover gravy over them...oh so bad but so delicious!!! Can't wait to make them, with GARLIC - everything is better with garlic and fried!

This is what mountain folk do with their leftover taters. This is an old southern thing. My late husband's mom taught me how to make these. Yes, they can be bland so if you don't do bland add stuff! I usually just add minced onions and salt and pepper to mine. Going to try adding some diced ham and a bit of cheese tonight.

Now, every time we have mashed potatoes, I make a bunch extra so we can have these awesome yummies.  Love 'em for breakfast with a couple of over-easy eggs.  Great with steaks or pot roast too.

I really enjoyed this.  I think the key to a flavorful potato cake is the mashed potatoes.  If your potatoes don't have a lot of seasoning then your cakes obviously won't be very good.  I used PAM in an effort to be healthy and I thought they turned out really great (but of course butter would be better).  Thanks for the recipe!

Wonderful! This was the first time me and my husband had ever eaten potato pancakes. I used my left over mashed potatoes from Taste of Home Test Kitchen's Traditional Mashed Potato recipe (AR recipe). I did add about 1tbsp of Epicure's Herb and Garlic Dip Mix Spice for flavor. They were to die for. My husband thought he was in heaven.

I've been making these for years; we love them with fried eggs for breakfast. It never occurred to me to use cheese, though, until seeing this recipe. What a great idea! I'll do that next time. The only thing I do differently is to add a little onion powder and some parsley to make it pretty. I don't think I fry mine quite as dark as the photo. Delicious recipe, thanks for sharing it!

I make these with yellow corn meal (instead of flour) and garlic powder (instead of garlic salt). I add finely diced onion and whatever spices strike my fancy that day. I also stir the cheese into the batter. Cook on medium heat, in a covered skillet, until golden brown (about 5 minutes per side).

This is unnecessarily complicated--my family has been frying our leftover mash for years. It works best with potato that is several days old, and has become very stiff. Form patties by hand the way you would a burger and fry in butter.

Adding cheese to the mix is an excellent idea.

Fantastic base recipe.  I added bacon bits, minced onion and some garlic and onion powders.  I used cheddar cheese in the middle like the recipe called for and sprinkled some on top as the cakes were getting done.  My entire family loved them!  Definately a "make it again, Mom!" recipe.

These turned out really tasty with the help of a few more ingredients. I added garlic and onion powders, black pepper, sauteed chopped onion and green bell pepper and like another reviewer, I threw in some fried onions from the can. Didn't have any cheddar on hand so I used parm instead. To make life easier I used my favorite brand of instant mashed potatoes. You can pretty much add anything to these taters to suit your own tastes. Family loved them and thanks!

I liked them.  They tasted like mashed potatoes and pancakes.  They didn't have a ton of flavor, but I don't think they were supposed to.  I added my own seasonings to my own serving when it was on my plate.

A pinch of garlic is intended to season the flour- not the mashed potatoes. If this recipe came out bland, it is because you need to spruce up your mashed recipe.  

I food processored boiled potatoes with; a whole lightly oiled, salted and roasted sweet onion, a little butter and a half potato water/half milk blend to get them just a little too damp for the plate..then cooled overnight.

(Advance planning)

What I didn't count on was nearly every recipe calling for grated, which was not what I was going for. I needed proportions, and this was perfect..

Because my potatoes were.

Made it tonight at dinner. I had read the reviews and was worried that it would be bland, so I shook on some Chachere's and cooked on medium heat because I'm impatient. I served it with fresh avocado and remoulade. Amazing.

Just finished and it was fantastic!! BUT I changed it up. I had leftover roast baby Hubbard squash which I mashed with the leftover spuds. I added black pepper plus one of my home-grown dried Cheyenne chili peppers.....and extra old white cheddar. That was my supper...nothing else. Can't wait to eat the rest tomorrow!!!

I made these with leftover mashed potatoes; they were fantastic! I added an extra egg, but otherwise didn't change a thing. There are so many different ways to tweak this recipe; definitely a keeper!

Used 3 cups of mashed potatoes.  Didn't add flour and forgot to add butter.  Added some leftover ham. Turned out great.

I followed the recipe with the exception that I used instant potatoes. The cakes ended up with a floury pasty taste. Good base recipe however I'm going to try it without the flour next time and maybe throw in some onion and ham.

I thought these were really good, they are bland, but I think they are supposed to be. A lot of people think pancakes are bland, that's why they put butter and syrup all over them. I put ketchup on these and they were a great side dish for my breakfast. I tried the first one like the directions said to put some potatoes down then some cheese and more potatoes that was too messy so I just mixed the rest of the cheese in it. Great way to use up mashed potatoes.

Foolishly I left out the salt. It definitely needed the salt. I also substituted garlic powder for the garlic salt, which I will do again. I also added extra garlic powder since my husband and I both like garlic.

Oh what joy to find this recipe!! I remember mother making these when we were children, incorporating different flavor additives. She always gave what she could to interest we children to try it. She didn't have to for me, I always loved her cooking. She and dad went through some rough periods of having cash available and what she couldn't think up for the palate, dad could. Thanks Allrecipes.

these were fabulous!!!  i used up left over mashed potatoes, (which i make with 'better than buillion', sour cream, milk, butter and & pepper-no salt due to the very salty 'B-than-B'). this combination for mashed potatoes makes for a rich flavor already, but WOW...made into a potato pancake, these were amazing.  my whole family RAVED!  the secret i found was to saute them in one spot til golden brown on the bottom, than very carefully flip them over in order to keep them from falling apart.  keep your flame on medium high and be liberal with the oi.  YUM!

I agree with the other reviewers that these need a little boost to give them more flavor--any of the enhancements mentioned.  On the other hand, they held their shape nicely and got a great crispy crust on the outside.  I formed mine completely before putting them in the pan so they had a nice smooth outline.  I would probably make these again when I had leftover mashed potatoes, but with something added to give them more flavor.

These were ok, but kind of bland. I think if I try them again I will add some real garlic and some onion. I also thought they were pretty thick, so I may just add the shredded cheese to the potato mixture and make a single layer patty. Basic recipe is ok, just needs a boost.

These were wonderful.  I used leftover mashed potatoes, so they were already flavored and I stirred the cheese into the potatoes and it worked great.

I added a little minced onion to this, and lightly floured the pancake before cooking. Next time, I will add black pepper, just a tiny pinch of red cayenne pepper, and will omit the flour. This might be good with minced peppers as well. Very good recipe! Thank you for sharing!

Yes, add you own spices to taste.  Some days I want my garlic butter and others I want with apple sauce, other times.. just an egg o easy and some snausages.  I used bisquick instead of flour.  A good palmful of onion and smaller palm of garlic powder.  My potatoes have enough salt and pepper already.  Great for any leftover mashed pots, if you ever have any!

I’ve always loved potato cakes. This recipe opened my eyes. I’ve just used leftover plain potatoes in the past. I left out the garlic only because I hate garlic mashed potatoes but added onion. Kept everything else the same. They disappeared as soon as they came out of the pan. My kido that hates them ate 4. Will repeat many times.

This is so close to the potato pancakes my Nana used to make when I was a kid.  I haven't had these since then and I really loved 'em.  I made them and tweaked just a bit by adding a couple of tablespoons of sour cream (to really stiff mashed potatoes) and chives and it really kicks up with some eggs over-easy and bacon, my hubby loved it.  Thank you!!

To kick it up a notch, add a cup of cooked sausage. Also, I made mine in a waffle maker. Crispy.

I have tried these a few times now and altered potatoes and flour ratio.. they are delicious however I find them quiet sloppy no matter how much I try to firm the mixture .. will still continue to make them as 2 hungry teenage boys and my other half lives them

A variation of this recipe is one we've had in my family FOR-EVER...supposedly our Irish ancestors brought it over, only our recipe calls for raisins and/or craisins instead of cheese/etc, so you can make a sweet or savory potato cake!!! :-) Either way, it's an AWESOME way to use up left over mashed potatoes! I'm like another poster in that I use recipes as a base and I tweak them to suit my family's taste. I use a LOT of raisins/craisins and they are FANTASTIC!!!

Made ours with leftover mashed potato. So did not need to add any spices. Just made them one layer thick without the cheese centers and they cooked very quickly. Perfect for breakfast!

My mom would fry them in a cast iron skillet with bacon drippings! I sautéed them in the butter the recipe called for, and stirred in 3pieces of bacon crumbled into the mixture. Garnish with scallions, and bacon pieces --and my daughter added MORE cheese on top of hers!

Delicious!  I think the point of this recipe is to use already well seasoned leftover mashed potatoes to make it as easy as possible.  If these turned out bland for you, then that means that the night you made and ate your mashed potatoes, that they were bland then also, so that's on you.  I loved this and served it up with sour cream and salsa, yum!

Trying something new. My husband and 9 year old likes it a lot. It's a different texture than you would think. I guess it's crispy on the outside and really squishy inside. It's mashed potatoes a so I think I should have expected that HA!

A good basic recipe. They reminded me of the potato cakes my mother made. I added in different seasonings to spice them up - garlic pepper and crushed red pepper. I will make these again.

I will make this again however I will add more flavoring. The whole family said the same thing, taste only flour. But I think this is a great basic recipe, easy to add your own personal flare.

This was a quick and simple side to make with my frosted meatloaf. It was well received by all. I used a blended cheese mixture of mozzarella and cheddar instead of just cheddar and I sprinkled parsley on the top for a little color.  I would most likely make this dish again.

My picky eaters heartily approved.  I didn't measure anything and mixed the cheese in and they turned out delicious.  My son finished the last one with his breakfast this morning.  For the more adventurous gourmands, I can see where you could add ingredients to your heart's content but then my guys would turn up their noses.  Thank you for a great and simple recipe!

Yummy! I was even able to add shredded veggies in there without the kids noticing. Like another reviewer, I added the cheese to the batter prior to pan frying. I will be using this recipe again for leftover mashed potatoes.

Tried this recipe out with some extra mashed potatoes this AM.  The only modification  I made was I substituted onions for the cheese.  The potato pancake was not bland as other reviewers mentioned.  I will make again when the occasion arises. Thanks for posting!

Mmm-hm! Just like mom used to make. Really. My mom made these all the time. She added onion, but it's not a necessity. Fluffy, a little crunch, warm, what's not to love?  I used instant mashed potatoes. I just used a bit more flour.
Edit: I made these again, but I noticed that I had some left over corn, so I threw it in the mix and fried it. Tasty and a good way to use up leftovers.

a very good starter. I mixed the cheese into the mixture to start with and added 1 table spoon off hot sauce. as i was eating them the only thing i could think is crumble sausage next time topped with gravy, but that's just me.

I made this with bread crumbs instead of flour.  Not sure how much of a difference that made.  Probably some.  They tasted good, but fell apart really easily and were hard to turn over.  I made them on my griddle coated with a generous amount of olive oil.  They did get some crispy on the outside, so that was good. My daughter (9) said they would have been better without the cheese.  I will probably not make them again, but they weren't bad.

I added a few things like chives and ranch dressing.  But overall, this was pretty bland.

A delicious, basic potato pancake.   I made without the cheese (as we prefer to slather then with sour cream!) and they were a great way to use up leftover mash.

What do you do when your husband takes back all the leftover mashed potato from a company event?  Sure not going to eat it as is for the next 2 wks.  I first tried the Irish potato cake from this site.  Very good.  This is the mashed potato's second incarnation, and it's not shabby either.  We like the carmelized exterior, so the only change I'd make is to make the patties thinner.

Instead of the cheddar cheese, I added leftover Mac and cheese. Sounds weird, but it went over well.

used and instant potatoes per recipe on pkg.then chilled and followed.  used a bit of oil every time before I added potatoes.  cooked quickly on high so lowered temp to medium and cooked 3-4 minutes on each side. just like my mom used to make.  thank you all recipes-- been waiting 11 years for the perfect match taste!

I've made these four or five times now, from leftover garlic mashed potatoes.  I only add the garlic (sea) salt, since I've already seasoned.  I have found it easier to mix the cheese directly into the other ingredients, and  I cook them on a griddle, so I can enjoy them even faster.  Delicious!  Perfect for a simple brunch.

I made this recipe as a quick lunch and I must say it is delicious.  I used leftover Betty Crocker butter and herb mashed potatoes and i must say they came out great.  Since the potatoes were already seasoned I left out the garlic and only put in the egg and flour.  It tasted great and the cakes cooked up perfect.  A great and easy recipe.

I used instant (gasp) loaded potato mix by Idaho, added shred cheese (about 3/4 cup) and then followed the recipe exactly - minus the salts since the instant mix was already seasoned.  It's pretty fabulous. I refrigerated the potatoes after mixing for about 30 mins, but the real key is taking your time during the cooking process.  Sadly, I have an electric cooktop, but used low/med heat (let's call it 4:00) and cooked each side the full 10 minutes the recipe calls for.  I did decide about 7-8 mins in to rotate the cakes (gently) to be sure it was browning evenly.  I think this made a difference. In addition, I had some garlic butter (thanks Chef Shamy) that I cooked them in and feel that was not a bad decision at all.  My hubby was pretty happy about the whole thing. So, either cook them all on a large griddle, or have a glass of wine handy to stand there for a couple of batches.

I tried this for dinner tonight because I'm married to a meat and potato msn and I wanted to try something new. I doubled the recipe accidentally because I guessed st how many potatoes equal the 2 cups and I ended up with 4 cups! Delicious recipe! Next time I will add crispy bacon bits! Yum!

After reading many reviews,(thanks for those) I made it without garlic and mixed the cheese in the thick potato mixture. I made sure to wait 10 minutes to flip them. I did not measure out the flour but I love the product and so does my 5 yr. old. Thanks for this recipe!

tried this, made a couple adjustments, added 1/4 meal & 1 tbsp bean & bacon soup (not watered down-just dip out of can) & they tasted fantastic!  The bean & bacon soup sounds strange, but it gave them a hint of bacon taste:)

This was a good starting point.  I felt like it needed onions .... I thought that right away but didn't want onions for breakfast so I made them without.  Next time definitely onions.  My mother made potato pancakes a lot but for lunch or dinner ... thats what I will do next time (and I WILL add onions!).

Unfortunately the egg in the middle of the cakes didn't cook despite pan frying it the prescribed time. After the first bite the texture was pretty unpleasant. It didn't work for me and I definitely won't try it again. Not recommended.

These were very tasty, easy to make and hubby loved them! The only change I made was adding a bit more garlic powder and about 1/2 cup crushed Durkee FF onion rings to the mix.  I fixed some with and without cheese...equally as good! Thanks for this updated version to the old fashioned potato cake!

This was a huge hit for my family. I did add more seasoning, and also a chopped onion. Next time I will try adding crumbled bacon. You can't go wrong if you add the things your family enjoys....have fun experimenting!

Mmm... I almost didn't change a thing... I just sprinkled some more shredded cheese on top of the cakes after they were done. I used cheddar-monterey jack cheese mix, since I was too lazy to shred the block of cheddar I had. It was still great. Will do it again, it was very quick and easy.

I loved this recipe to use up leftover mashed potatoes. My mashed potatoes were already wonderfully seasoned (if I do say so myself!) with salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder. I did add a bit more salt, pepper and garlic powder to compensate for the added flour and egg. The consistency of these potato cakes was really nice, almost silky. I used reduced fat grated cheese, and might even omit the cheese next time. All-in-all, a very delicious and simple way to put leftovers mashed potatoes to good use!
