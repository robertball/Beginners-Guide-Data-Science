This was really good. I left carrots to simmer longer than 10 minutes. After taking them out of the liquid, I boiled it down to a glaze and poured over the carrots. One guest said it was like candy. (Note: I used olive oil instead of butter for a non-dairy option. It worked great.)

I really liked these carrots and so did my family. I tweaked it a little and used 3 lbs of baby carrots and also diced up a sweet onion and cooked it with it. I cooked them for about 1/2 hour. So delicious!

These where really good.  I made with fresh squeezed orange juice instead of lemon juice but it never caramelized.  It was to much liquid.  But the end result was tender sweet good flavored carrots that where very pretty on the plate.  I server with rotisserie pork loin, green beans, and potatoes.  Our guest loved the meal!

I subbed lime juice for the lemon. The result was quite delicious. It can go well with almost anything also.

These carrors were tasty, but I think 1 stick of butter would have been plenty.

Would make it again possibly. Could have been that the honey was not as good as it could have been.

I am not too good with wasting sauce so I had to add more carrots.  Nice taste to add the ginger.  Next time I will use fresh ginger.

These were okay, just way to sweet considering carrots already have a natural sweetness. I'm going to leave out the lemon next time, maybe use less honey and add a little water instead. I stick of butter was plenty.
