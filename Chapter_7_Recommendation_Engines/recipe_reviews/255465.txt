I make Moc Sou Boreg all the time, it’s a delicious Armenian  Side dish! My families favorite as well! Very light version of American macaroni and cheese! Are use small curd macaroni and cheese and I dry it with a paper towel before putting it into mixture along with plenty of parsley flakes, onion and garlic! I also use monster cheese instead of The Montery jack cheese used in this recipe!

This was really good, moist and light with a delicate flavor. I made half recipe and baked in an 8 x 8 dish; I used Colby ilo Jack cheese because I like it better. The sauce pairs perfectly with egg noodles. Not sure if the tiny dab of butter on top added anything, next time I will either omit it or increase the butter and mix it with bread crumbs for a topping. Thanks for a  great recipe.

9.26.16  This recipe was mellow and mild from Monterey Jack and cottage cheeses.  Although not creamy in texture as I’m accustomed to, it was good, plenty moist, and juicy.  Followed the recipe with the exception of using lowfat cottage cheese (which has smaller curds and what I had on hand) and mixing the parsley into the entire cheese mixture.  It was a nice change, but I still prefer good old cheddar mac & cheese.  If I were to make again, I think I’d add a can of chopped green chilis to ramp up the flavor a bit (personal taste preference).  Thanks Yagoobian Pfister for sharing your recipe.
