Once again, a great "basic" recipe with plenty of opportunity for variation. My tips for a gorgeous and delicious salad:
1) don't overcook the pasta. your salad will turn to into a broken mushy mess.
2) you MUST refrigerate this for at least 4 hours. even if you start with cold ingredients, the flavors must have time to come together.
3) cheap salad dressing will ruin this dish. go for the good stuff, whatever you use.
4) the salad is not meant to be "wet & drippy". go easy on the dressing. add salad seasoning or spices from your own rack if it needs a kick.
5) grape tomatoes cut in half and english cucumber keep the salad from getting soggy.
6) whatever spice you use, stay away from salt. it will make the tomatoes and cucumbers run.
7) don't be tempted to add too much liquid. your veggies will create more juice and the longer the salad sits, it will get wetter and your noodles will continue to swell.

I loved this recipe!! I added a small can of black olives and a chopped green pepper. I also put in creamy italian dressing,this being so rich I only needed about 1/3 of the bottle. Will be making this often as it is a great summer side dish!

I wanted a basic pasta salad recipe to keep on hand just in case... this was the one! Very easy and straightforward. Love the red onions. I used fat free Italian dressing and found the taste was still great. An added bonus is that I usually have the ingedients on hand. Low-fat and easy, definitely a keeper.

Good base recipe - but I always add more veggies: shredded carrot, thawed frozen baby peas, chopped zucchini & chopped broccoli.

Alot like a recipe I have used for years.  I like to use Robusto! Zesty Italian or if some are being weight-conscientious, Zesty FREE Italian is awesome also!  Canned, diced tomatoes work good in a pinch, but will make salad soggy by next day (usually gone the 1st day anyway:)  Love to add black olives(sliced or chopped) and shredded cheddar (Kraft FREE again if u want) to the cukes.  I omit onion.  Color is nice with this combo. of veggies and rainbow rotini noodles. Be sure to shake really good in the bowl with a lid before serving and may need to add more dressing.  SOOO good!!

This recipe is the best!  I do a couple things differently.  I don't like onions so I leave the onions out, I use a zesty Italian dressing, and for an added kick I add Johnny's Salad Elegance Seasoning.  I have yet to have anyone complain!!

I used plain fusilli pasta in this recipe, as that was all I had. I used Newman's italian and added just a little pepper and basil. This would be even better with a little parmesan on top when served. Very good. I liked how simple this was and how I could make this at the last minute. TIP: I rinse pasta that I use in cold salads with cold water, then drain. It makes the transition from kitchen to table quicker.

Great party dish! Easy to prepare and makes A LOT! I added pepperoni just because we all are big meat eaters. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Although the chopping of the vegetables can be a tad time consuming, I was able to finish at the same time the noodles were done cooking.  I find that most pasta salads are not kid friendly and neither was this one.  The adults LOVED it though and it went over well at our party. I would make it again.

Refreshing and simple to prepare. I added fresh ground black pepper and changed the pasta to rotini. Added fresh shredded parmesan on top.

I don't know why I tried this recipe because it's lacks two of my favorite pasta salad ingredients: celery and shredded carrots. 

However, it was really great. I made a homemade creamy italian dressing (the one from this site with onion, may, italian herbs, salt, pepper, vinegar and sugar). I never buy bottled dressings anymore. They're so easy and so cheap to make at home. 

I didn't have cucumbers like I thought I did and I did miss them. I used sliced green olives instead... They added extra briney zip that I would only recommend if you LIKE olives already. 

I'll be serving this for 4th of July. It already got rave reviews from my boyfriend, so its a keeper and great to work from. 

(One more thing: I used campanelle pasta, it's one of my favorite for pasta salads)

This is very similar to the pasta salad that I've made for years.  Instead of using tomatoes and cucumbers,  I add chopped green and red peppers, cubed mozzarella cheese, sliced pepperoni and sliced back olives.   Of course, red onion is always a must.   I've had other pasta salads made with tomatoes and cucumbers as well and they are yummy too!

Great salad for pot luck lunches at work!  I cook the pasta and prepare the other ingredients the night before then assemble at the party.  It's simple to make and tastes great.  This salad has been a big hit with co-workers.

This is awesome pasta salad!  The only thing I would change is the amount of onion...  I only used 1/2 a red onion instead of the whole as called for, and I STILL feel like it was waaay too much.  The onion was a bit overpowering.   I will be making this again, definitely, but will be using 1/4 of an onion next time.   I also used a basalmic vinegarette in place of the italian dressing.... yummy!

Delicious and healthy salad!  I also add green, red, or yellow bell peppers, shredded carrot, and celery. Then I marinate it in fat-free Zesty Italian Dressing.

The first time I made this recipe was for a family picnic. I added cooked diced chicken breast, grated parmesan cheese and salad supreme (a seasoning by McCormick). It was a hit. I have since made it with cooked shrimp and served it with fish. Several family members now made this dish as an entree with chicken breast added.

Okay, not outstanding.  I even splurged and used Olive Garden's dressing, but it was just kind of so-so.  I guess I'm doomed to just making okay pasta salad.

I've been making this for years and I forgot where I got the recipe from but the way I make it is a little different. I use an italian dressing packet mix, where you add oil vinegar and water.  I also add green pepper and chunks of cheddar cheese-It's great!! You can also add summer sausage or some kind of smoked sausage to make it a meal.

Made this for a party & it was a big hit! I used Wishbone Italian salad dressing.  I also added 8 oz. of shredded Italian cheese & 6 oz. pepperoni.  I also used 5 Roma tomatoes instead of 2 large tomatoes.  Thanks - I will definitely make this again!

I loved this.  The sharp taste of the red onion adds so much.  I'm not a dressing fan, so I left it out and just used a drizzle of olive oil, and I also substituted whole-grain fusilli for the tricolor pasta, but overall this was great.  I served it as a dinner side dish and took the leftovers to work the next day for lunch.  Well done on this.

I make this very recipe as a base with balsamic vin. dressing. Depending on crowd, i add red pepper, pepperoni, diced ham,, and perhaps a little mozz cheese on the top!! there are many variations that work!!! Black olives are great but my husband doesn't care for them. I love lots of cucumbers and tomatoes!!!!!!!! YUM!! I also use 2 bowls for picnics...... i put the pasta in a glass salad bowl and place it in my stainless steel bowl with ice in the bottom to keep it cool for the picnic!!

This was good but nothing near exceptional.  I might make again if I needed something quick using whole grape tomatoes and add some garlic/herb feta.

YUMMO and SOOOO easy!!! I didn't have any tomatoes so I omitted them but my neighbor brought over some fresh grown cucumbers and they were GREAT in it! I used my Tupperware Quick Chef to get the onions minced well and used a bottle of Zesty Italian. I have a lot of leftovers so tomorrow Im gonna toss some parmesan on it as well.... definately a keeper and I'll be using this recipe when we go to bbqs and family gatherings! Thanks so much Jennieanne!!!

I used this recipe for my first time making pasta salad.  I could not believe the wonderful aroma when I had put this all together!!  It was fabulous and so easy!  All I added was a green pepper and some pepper, and it was awesome.

I used only 1/2 of a red onion and not quite an entire bottle of fat free Italian dressing.  I also added some garlic, basil, and oregano to taste.  It was good, but not quite out-of-this-world good.  Easy to throw together for a potluck, though.

Very tasty. I added diced green pepper, parmesan cheese, and threw in some dried Italian seasoning which gave it extra flavor. Use a strong Italin dressing such as WishBone brand instead of a lite or free dressing as these don't have as much flavor.

I have made this recipe many times with just afew twists. First you can use any vegetables you want or like, shredded cheese, shrimp, etc. You are limited only by what you like and your imagination. I use the bottled Italian, but I also use a pack of the dry Italian seasoning and McCormick Salad Supreme (in the spice isle). I also put sliced Pepperoni in it. Needless to say I have almost never had any leftovers. Delicious!

I have made this salad close to 40 years now and it's quick and easy always taste great. Pretty basic. I often add a bag of mixed frozen veggies to it along with diced celery.  Try chopped ham and/or turkey in it and you have a complete meal.  Don't be afraid to experiment with this recipe.  You'll never be disappointed.  We never have.  Great sumertime meal.

This is a great start.  I use cherry or grape tomatoes, red onion, black olives, pepperoni, small chuncks of cheddar cheese, 1/3 c. shredded parmesan, Zesti Italian with a dash of vinegar and pinch of mint.  This will not break down as cut tomatoes and cucumbers will...lasts a week in fridge.  Always there for a hungry soul.

This is a very good recipe for pasta. The whole family loved it. I did leave out the onion because the family will not eat onions uncooked but followed everything else to a T. I will be making this again.

I always add 1 cup grilled chicken 1/2 small peeled tomato, 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.  To kick up the dressing a bit I use red wine vinegar, olive oil and a sweeten to taste.  This salad is great but the recipe needs a little more zest.

This salad was great!  I doubled the veggies.  For the dressing I used Newman's Own Family Italian dressing.  It was totally worth the extra couple of  dollars.  I used a package of whole wheat macaroni and I found that I only needed to use half a bottle instead of a full one.  Topped it with some fresh parsley and old cheddar.  Will make again.  Very light and tasty!

I took this to a dinner party, and it was well received. The vegetables add a nice texture and color, as well as flavor. I used lite Italian dressing and added chopped green peppers. Looking forward to making it again.

This was ok but kinda boring. Husband is a big pasta salad fan, but he hardly touched it at all. Oh well, thanks anyway.

This was easy to make and tasty.  I used Kraft Roasted Red Pepper Italian w/ Parmesan dressing.  I made only 1/2 a recipe and it was a lot.  I plan on adding chicken and freshly grated parmesan cheese to the leftovers for variety.

This salad is always good.  I never add tomatoes because I am alergic to them.  This time I added carrots.  I made this with "kabobs" from this site. Yummy!

This salad was good, but missing something.  I think I would add a meat (pepperoni, maybe) or change the dressing to a Ranch style dressing.  It is a good basic recipe to start with.

This is a great base recipe for pasta salad.  I added 2 stalks celery, 1 green pepper, 1/2 jar green olives and made my own dressing from 1/2 c olive oil, 1/4 c red wine vinegar, 1 tsp basil, 1 tsp oregano, 2 cloves garlic, 1/2 tsp sea salt, 1/8 tsp pepper.

Great basic pasta salad recipe.  Your dressing choice obviously plays a big part in the flavor of this.  Be mindful of that when selecting.  I chose a restaurant's dressing that I really like that is sold in the grocery store.

This was very easy and pretty darned tasty. I used the homemade Italian dressing recipe found on this site. Next time I make this recipe I will cook the pasta a bit less so it is firmer. I also think the flavor would be improved by adding diced green pepper and crumbled feta cheese.

This salad gets four stars for being super easy and delicious. It loses one star because the ingredient portions are wrong. A whole onion is way too much. I suggest using 1/4 onion and only 1/2 bottle of salad dressing. The fun part about this recipe is you can add ingredients to your liking. When I make it again, I'll add a couple cans of beans and a melody of veggies!

I make a pasta salad very similar to this one, but it is also really good if you add a jar of mccormick salad supreme seasoning.  You can also add pepperoni, mushroom, cheese or whatever suits your taste.

I give this recipe 4 stars.  It is tasty and so quick and easy to make.  I have made it according to the recipe and also made it with sliced olives.  Both versions were yummy!  Taken to several potlucks and received great comments.

Based on the listed recipe, I gave it a 4 star, it is just a tad bland for my taste. However, doctoring this up is super easy and can easily become a 5 star, well, to my house anyway. I add some salami, ham and mozzerella cheese to it.  Also a few good shakes of the salad supreme spice. My mom likes to add fresh mushrooms too, but not being a mushroom fan I leave those out. Lots you can do with this! Yum!

This is an excellent pasta salad.  I did add red & green bell pepper, sliced olives & corn.  I also used zesty italian as the previous reviews indicated.  Definately a do-over.

Have made this twice now and it has been a hit at both cookouts.  I cheat and use canned petite diced tomatoes and also added in some black olives. Will definitely be used many more times.  Thanks!

This recipe has been in my family for years! It is my favorite pasta salad. Although I add a lot more veggies so it actually is a rainbow :) Peppers, olives, tomatoes, carrots, cucumbers, artichoke hearts, red onions, etc! More veggies the better.

This is almost like the receipe found on the Kraft website.  My husband loves this receipe except that we add black olives and feta cheese. I also use either cherry tomatoes or grape tomatoes. It is a always a big hit everytime I make it.

This has been a standby for more years than I care to remember but I never add the Italian dressing (to which I have added some lemon juice because the commercial brands too sweet) until an hour before serving.  I have found that the pasta takes up most of the liquid when left for any length of time and I always double check for flavour because tomatoes seem to need more salt. I like it a tad  spicy so again before serving  I add freshly ground black pepper and sprinkle on grated Romano cheese.  Stir and serve

Followed exactly but used plane rotini not tri colored.  It's amazing that such a basic salad with so few ingredients got such rave reviews from my family!  Perfect with grilled meat on a hot summer evening!

This is a perfect summer picnic salad.  I add more veggies than the recipe called for and also used only 8 oz of fat free Italian dressing, but that is just my preference.  I didn't want my pasta salad "swimming" in the dressing.

This is so good and so simple. It makes for a good salad base, and you can later add any other ingredients you may have handy. I added a few sprinkles of parmesan and some slices of cheddar to balance the tangyness of the Italian dressing. But all in all, we loved it!

I made this to bring to a baby shower and it turned out very well.  I added chopped up slices of pepperoni, sliced olives and a few sprinkles of creole seasoning.  I think I may also try adding some cheese the next time.  It's a very easy recipe and serves many!

I don't like any pasta salad but everyone that ate this loved it.  Only reason it didn't get a 5 was that there was still some left over at the end of the night.  This may be due to the fact that it makes so much!  I think it is more like 12-16 serves than 8.  Especially if you are using this as a side dish.

Very quick and easy recipe. Since it is best to refrigerate overnight, it is a convenient recipe in that you are able to make it ahead and bring it out when ready to serve....no work the day of your get-together! I used a zesty Italian dressing and it was yummy.

Great basic recipe! Although the photo seems to show olives, they are not listed in the ingredients, and I didn't include them. I think olives would be a great addition, though, and I may try adding them next time, along with some feta cheese. This  is the perfect salad if you want to add various goodies from your refrigerator, but it is also fine as is.

I made this for camping with a big group so I doubled most the recipe. 2 boxes pasta, which I ran under cold water when done to stop cooking. 2 cucumbers, a carton of grape tomatoes I sliced in half, 1 big red onion and 1 bottle of creamy Italian dressing. I also added some sliced black olives. Tastes AMAZING!!!

I didn't use a lot of the dressing since others wanted a different flavor, I let them use what they liked most.  This is a great recipe!  Thank you.

This recipe has become a staple at our house.  My husband loves it and if doubled it makes a nice size to share with company.   I often add black olives (hubby loves them!) and occasionally some pepperoni.  If I don't  have red onion, I used what ever kind I have on hand.  This salad keeps well.  I usually stir in a little extra italian dressing when serving it the next day.

I was not sure how this would taste if it was a bit warm. Since I work all day and made it after getting home, I put it in the freezer for an hour and stirred a couple of times to cool it down quicker.  Family loved it and I saw seconds going on their plate.  It was fun to put together as everyone took on a task.  My only suggestion would be put in amounts that are to your preference.  My kids left some of the onion on their plate, but my husband ate everything.  Next time I may cut back a bit on onion and add more cucumber.  Thanks for the recipe

Loved this recipe! Delicious. My guests enjoyed it as well. I was careful to leave some firmness to the pasta as previous reviews recommended and mixed in the dressing slowly to be sure it wouldn't make the salad soggy, and in the end it wasn't- I used a whole bottle of Zesty Italian. Couldn't find English Cucumber so I just peeled and seeded a regular cucumber. Used a couple regular tomatoes (seeded) instead of grape tomatoes and added a small can of sliced black olives. All in all a great go-to recipe for pasta salad. Thanks!

Very tasty! To lighten this up but still keep some flavor, I used a bottle of calorie-free Italian Dressing (yes, it does exist) and  added 2 Tbsp. of reduced fat feta cheese and 1 Tbsp chopped fresh basil.  This cut the calories by half.  When you are on a 700-calorie per day diet, every calorie counts!

This pasta dish is great. I made a big batch and split. I love red onions but had green onions on hand. I also added crab meat to one half and shrimp to the other half and topped with freshly grated parmessan. MMM

This is a great recipe.  The women in my family have been making it for many years and it's always the first to go at all of the picnics and BBQ's.  The only thing we do differently is add green peppers and olives and sprinkle with a generous helping of Suddenly Salad which can be found in the spice isle of your local supermarket.

There are so many variations to this recipe. I have used it for years. Good Seasons dressing (made from the package) tastes the best as far as dressing goes. But you can add a variety of things and this still woould be awesome!

This is my old stand-by pasta salad.  I add about a half cup of sugar and red pepper strips to my recipite.  The sugar helps smooth out the taste.  after refrif=geration you may need to add extra Italian dressing.

I love this recipe! But it should be built upon.  It can vary every time you make it according to what ingredients you feel like adding on that particular day.  Some ingredients I use every time are baby ears of corn and water chestnuts.  I also use Robusto Italian dressing - it has more flavor.

Great starter recipe.  I changed mine up a bit.  I used a can of diced tomatoes, omitted the cucumber, added finely diced carrots and black olives.  I also used elbow macaroni - just because I had a bunch leftover from another dish I was making.
