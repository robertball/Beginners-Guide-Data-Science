This sounded like a good bread pudding recipe but I didn't want a banana flavor so i substituted 1 1/2 cups of Vanilla pudding for the mashed banana - it turned out DIVINE!!!  Served it warm with 1/2 and 1/2 poured over it, delicious!

Ya know, I love a good bread pudding. I can't rave enough about this. I have issues with baking with bananas other then banana bread. I just don't like desserts baked with bananas. It just something about bananas baked, just I don't know, the flavors are weird. But give me a banana bread, and we are good to go. SO having said that.. I did have bananas that needed to be used, but I didn't want the "stand by" of banana bread. trying different recipes. I saw this and thought...geesh what could happen. What did happen is I fell in love with this breakfast treat. My husband was the same, bread puddings are his fave. I will say, I didn't have day old French bread, but did have an abdunance of different selections, that was getting to that point. Any good yeasted bread will work. And as far as the rest of the recipe, I followed to a T. I love the additon of the spices because they really made the flavor of the banana stand out with the compliments of the cinnamon. And there was no taste lingering from the coconut milk...which I expected to taste. Thank you soo much for the recipe. I was able to use up excess bananas, bread and coconut milk...all in one shot and enjoyed it termendously! No one in my house turned away from asking for seconds.

Expectations are everything and this didn’t turn out the way I expected.  I was hoping for a bread pudding that leaned toward the lighter side with a custard like texture, but this turned out dense and heavy.   It was so dense that it could be cut into solid pieces like a piece of cake.  Talk about banana, banana, banana!   The coconut milk was the ingredient that attracted me to this recipe and I couldn’t even taste it.  I ended up making a rum sauce and poured it over the top for a contrasting flavor.  All in all, it was good, but nothing I would make again.

I made this recipe tonight and it was delicious. I read some of the reviews and yes it is very heavy and dense which thats what I expected, I make a lot of desserts from Jamaica and a lot of their cakes are dense and heavy which I knew it would be perfect for my husband being  from Jamaica. In mine I added raisins and I wanted something sweet tonight so I didn't wait for the next day to bake it I let it sit for an hour before putting it in the oven and it came out perfect.I made me and my husband a bowl of it with some vanilla ice cream and as we started eating it I looked at him and it was so good I wanted to slap him in the face. That's how good it was I didn't have no words at the time lol. This dessert is definitely going into my secret  recipe vault and I'm sorry but I'm not going to share it with anyone lol. But I will be making it for all my friends and family and no one's ever going to get this recipe. I'm so happy I came across this recipe it's like totally awesome I ate so much of it my eyes are bulging right now so I need to go sleep this off. when i make banana pudding I always use leftover bread i don't like to use a new loaf so I had some stale bread bread that was the ends  of white bread, wheat baguette,  stale hot dog and hamburger rolls.some stale some soft and I just broke it all up in the followed the recipe and it came out perfectly. you can't even tell what is what in the recipe so to me the bread doesn't make a difference.

Holy cow! This is close-your-eyes-and-say-mmmm delicious! I didn't and wouldn't change a thing. Not for the calorie-counter, this is rich, dense, and all about the banana. It's a plan ahead kind of dessert as you really do need to let it sit and soak the full 8 hrs to maximize the yumminess. Yes, you can cut it into pieces; good bread pudding is like that. The coconut milk adds more richness than coconut flavor, though a hint of coconut does come through. I really like this best at room temp, if you can wait that long. A real show-stopper.

This was amazing.  This was my first time ever making bread pudding - but I love bread pudding without raisens and love banana bread - so when I had too many ripe bananas and too many Costco rolls left over this receipe was perfect.

I ended up letting it be in the refridge for about 16-17 hours, as I prepared it mid day and cooked it the next morning - I was concerned it might be too soggy, but not at all.

I also made this recipe without walnuts - as a personal preference.

Preparing this dish was super, super easy.

This is a great dessert.  I omitted the walnuts and put in chocolate chips.  I was also very generous with the vanilla essence and the cinnamon.  I sprinkled demerara sugar as soon as it came out of the oven.  It gave it a nice crunch.  I used left over bread rolls from a barbecue. I don't think it matters what kind of bread one uses.  Highly recommend.  It cuts up great into squares making it easy to serve for a buffet.

I liked it but I think it was just too rich for my tummy.  I also used light coconut milk.  I still have half left in the freezer.  My daughter liked it a lot, my husband said it was too much for him.

Excellent Recipe.  Followed recipe except added some raisins and only let it soak for 1 hour (we couldn't wait to eat it).  It came out fabulous, so tasty.  Will make again.

My favorite way to use up old bananas and the collection of bread heels that live in my freezer.  This always gets lots of compliments and is still good when cutting the sugar in half, subbing milk for cream, etc.  Very forgiving set of ingredients.  Don't forget the toasted walnuts!  They add a lot!

Yum. I followed it fairly closely, except I added extra cinnamon and vanilla.  It was moist and delicious.  Next time I might add chocolate chips or cocoa powder for an extra element.

The flavor is fantastic! Reading the reviews on how the coconut flavor doesn't come through, I added 1/2 tsp or 1 tsp of coconut extract and it was perfect! However I found this bread pudding to be a bit greasy. In fact I halved the amount of butter because I just didn't find it necessary and I substituted the heavy cream with skim milk. I've never cooked/ baked with coconut milk before so maybe it makes things naturally oily...? But even with the changes I made, I still find it a bit heavy on the stomach. Very delicious though! Just not quite the light breakfast bread pudding I was expecting.

I didn’t have enough bananas so I used the vanilla pudding to make up the difference. This is the best dessert we’ve ever eaten. The only problem we had was we couldn’t stop eating it!

This is my son's favorite. He says "it is gooey and mushy and so yummy" and I must agree. I have tried a few other, more traditional bread pudding recipes, but I must admit this is my favorite as well. The combination of coconut milk and ripe banana is just so perfect with this comfy food textured mushy bread pudding. (I wouldn't try this recipe with sliced bread as most traditional bread pudding recipes require. I think it may get just too mushy.) Serve warm with French vanilla ice cream.

I never made bread pudding before so at 70 I continue to learn. Because I am a diabetic, I decided to use maple syrup instead of the brown sugar but the rest of the recipe was followed.  The smell coming out of  the oven was divine and the taste was sensational.  I will be making this more frequently.

Yum! This was first attempt at a bread pudding and my whole family enjoyed it. A couple of minor changes due to what I had on hand - almonds instead of walnuts, cows milk instead of coconut milk, and only 3 bananas. The banana discolouring on top while it sat in the fridge overnight didn't look the best, but the taste was phenomenal. Will be making again for sure.

This is a fantastic recipe and quite easy to make. I added chocolate chips which made it even more decadent, but they weren't necessary as the ingredients are so wonderful. Note: I didn't know enough to read the instructions on my can of coconut milk. Open it from the bottom and carefully as there will likely be a mix of liquid and solid inside.

Followed the directions to the letter with one exception. I had whipping cream on hand instead of heavy cream so I used 1c. whipping cream. Turned out very well. Great banana taste and the nuts are a must. I bought a French loaf then took it out of the bag and set it on the counter overnight to get nice and dry on the outside. That made it easy to slice into the cubes. It soaked for about 10 hours before baking.

Loved it. Makes a nice big pan, so perfect for when company is coming.  I like more spice, but that is just my taste.  I think currants would be a nice addition too.

It was delicious.  I will try adding shredded coconut next time for more coconut flavor.  I hope will be moist just like this time.

The texture was nice, but a little much on the banana flavor for my liking. Tastes similar to banana bread, but more work involved.  I'm going to try again with less banana and maybe add vanilla pudding like another reviewer tried. Added caramel sauce on top which was yummy.
