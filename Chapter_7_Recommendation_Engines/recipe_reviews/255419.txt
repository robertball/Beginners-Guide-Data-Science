The family really enjoyed this meal. 4 chicken breasts, butterflied and pounded thin will yield 8 rolls.  My breasts were about a 1 pound each, I used 2 breasts, making 4 rolls about 1/2 lb each.  The cream cheese filling is enough for 4 rolls, not 8.   I didn't have whipped cream cheese so I used regular cream cheese and whipped it with a mixer.  I did add some finely chopped chives to the cream cheese in addition to the other ingredients.   I sprinkled the breasts with chicken seasoning (salt, pepper, garlic powder, paprika, cayenne) instead of just salt and pepper.   As for the sauce, I added a little fresh garlic to the olive oil before adding the cream.  4 oz of fresh basil is lot, I used about 6 large leaves and that was just right.   The Idahoan Russet potatoes were very good, much better than we expected.  I made  as directed while the chicken rested, just adding a tad of butter to each serving.   This would be great for when you need a nice dinner fast, make the chicken rolls in advance, wrap each tightly in plastic wrap, make the sauce while the chicken cooks, steam a vegetable and dinner is ready in 30 minutes.  
(Note:  Partially freezing the chicken breasts makes it very easy to butterfly them and pound flat.)

Omg this was so good! Beautiful presentation too! I ended up doubling sauce as we like things saucy. Glad I did, there wouldn’t have been enough sauce for us. I didn’t use all the basil it called for, seemed like a  a lot. I did put some shredded Parmesan in with the cream cheese mixture.  I can’t say enough good things about this recipe. Served with rice (put sauce on rice) and steamed broccoli.

Ok... so this recipe rocks!!! It tastes so good and looks so elegant. I made it after a training class. It was quick and easy. Substitutions: 1) used thinly sliced chicken breast 2) used ricotta cheese 3) also used mexican shredded cheese 4) breasts seasoned with monterey chicken seasoning & season all as we like our food seasoned. Will look great on elegant dinnerware next time and i will add asparagus. Will also make trays for the sick and shut-in-- definitely exudes comfort food.

We loved these! The filling dripped out a bit, but the taste of the sauce and filling was suburb and the chicken was very moist. The Idahoan Signature™ Russets Mashed Potatoes tasted very similar to homemade ones both in taste and texture. Can't wait to make them again!

This was very good! Very rich! The sauce is also amazing on the potatoes! I didn't have fresh basil, so I used dried. Still delicious. Recommended!
