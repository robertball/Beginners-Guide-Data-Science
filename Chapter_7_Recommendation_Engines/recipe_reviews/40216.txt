I found this very tasty and my wife really liked it too.  BUT, you will get much better results when properly preparing Ancho chiles.  First, remove the stem and seeds and slice down one side of it to make it flat.  Then add boiling water on top and let sit about 15 minutes, then remove and slice it thin.  At this point you can add it as mentioned or pur√©e it in the blender with the tomato sauce first.  This makes a great soup!  I also added a whole fresh Cayenne pepper to kick it up a bit!

My husband has an aversion to all things tomato but he absolutely LOVED this soup! It was easy to make, stores great, and is as fabulous on cold days to warm you up or on hot days to wash down with cold beer!

I have the whole dried ancho chiles.  I cut off the stem end and shook out the seeds.  Then cut the dried chile into narrow strips.  Turn and cut into small pieces.  Add this to the soup.  Be sure to let it in the liquid for about an hour to put moisture back into the dried chile.  Great recipe.

I found that the soup was quite bland for our tastes so I added fresh garlic and increased the spice recommendation. I didn't thicken it or put it in the blender as I liked the consistency as is. I might add rice next time, to make it more hearty.

A delicious soup that is so easy to make. It freezes well too!

Delicious! I added a little extra cayenne and chile powder. I did thicken it using the pulse button on my blender, and then I added the chicken and the toppings staright into the soup. Very hearty and just spicy enough.

I made this with vegetable broth and left out the chicken to make a vegetarian tortilla soup. It was wonderful! You don't even miss the chicken! It was easy to make, fast, and seemed to be low fat.

Excellent recipe!  Because I was in a time crunch when I made it, I substituted 2 cans of chunk white chicken breast (instead of preparing home-made chicken breast) and added it right into the soup--I also used bagged tortilla chips instead of home-made tortilla crisps.  This will definitely be made again!

I've been asked for and passed this recipe along several times; great!!  The ancho was not readily available at the local grocery store, but a mexican corner store had it.

My husband and I liked the soup fine.  However, I added about 1/4 pound of cubed Velveeta and one can of corn with the water drained off.  Next time, I will probably add black beans as well.

Very good starting point.  I added fresh garlic to lightly saute with the chicken and onion before adding the stock to the pot.  Also, I added about half a cup of dried black beans, half a cup of frozen corn, and a half cup of brown rice - added extra water and a boullion cube to make up for the extra water needed.  I used my pressure cooker (as the beans, rice, corn, and chicken were all not in an edible state).  SO GOOD!  My husband asked me to add this to our "rotational" menu.  =)  Thanks so much for a good recipe.

This was a hit at our monthly supper club event with the theme "fiesta." I was hesitant at first to use the recipe because it was submitted by McCormick and I thought it might be too bland, not authentic enough. But we were very happily surprised. In fact, it was so spicy that we kept coughing while we ate it, but we loved it.

I tried this recipe for my husband's educated New Mexico chili palate.  He raved about this soup.  I enjoyed it as well.  The spice mix is terrific for a cold, rainy evening meal.

It's hard to review this recipe because I made so many changes to it.  I followed a previous reviewer's advice and added black beans and corn to the soup. I felt that without adding these ingredients, the soup would be rather plain. I also added some minced garlic.  To really liven up the soup I put out several toppings, including shredded monterey jack cheese, fresh cilantro, avocado, fresh lime juice, and a homemade salsa made of jalapeno peppers, cilantro,tomatoes, garlic and lemon juice.  These toppings really gave an extra punch to the soup. I did heat tortilla strips in the oven to put in the soup, but when my family ate it again as leftovers we just used tortilla chips and they worked just as well. I gave the recipe 3 stars, but if you use the above changes it is an outstanding recipe.

I was not big on this. The ancho chile has a smokey, sweet flavor without any heat (much like chili powder). I found myself adding some Habenero Chili Flakes to the soup to give it the heat I felt it was missing. Adding the chips and sour cream to the top of each serving really helps. Probably won't make this one again. Thanks for the recipe!  :)

This soup is so good and filling!  My husband loves Mexican food, and he said this is the best dish I've ever made.  I accidentally bought garlic flavored chicken broth, but it didn't hurt the flavor at all.  I also used a can of the diced tomatoes with green chilies in them.  Awesome!

This is delicious.  I used store-bought tortilla strips and a 10 oz can of chicken in the interest of time.  Will definitely make this one again!

This has to be the best tortilla soup recipe out there.  I have been making this recipe for years.  I have cooked it for many dinner parties and it is always a huge hit.  If I am feeling a little pressed for time, instead of making my own tortilla strips I will just put some store bought tortilla chips in the bottom of the bowl.  This one is a keeper!

This is pretty good and easy to make.  I make a lot of changes to it, though.  It's easy to modify if you like something more.  I add lime (I'm a lime nut) and jalapenos (it's really hot).  Using store bought chips would work fine.  Frying the tortilla is probably the tastiest.

This was easy to make and had a nice taste.  I also added cayenne pepper and chili pepper.  I also added a few drops of scotch bonnet sauce.  I would make it again.

So good. Tortilla soup is one of my all time favorits and I have tried many. This is one of the best so far. I do put the soup in the blender to give it more thickness before pouring it over the chicken and adding the garnish on top.
