The first time I made this bread following exactly the recipe, but when I looked at the dough in the machine it was VERY crumbly, so I had to put more milk.  Since the bread was delicious, I tried it an other time (to give to my in-laws) and I tried it with an extra egg (3 instead of 2).  The dough was perfect and everybody liked it very much!

I've tried a to make a number of challah recipes in my bread machine, and this is the first one that's turned out really well.  The texture and taste are terrific.  I prefer to use the bread machine to make the dough, and then braid the bread, let it rise for another hour or so, and bake it in a conventional oven for 35 minutes at 375 degrees.  This recipe is also great with raisins added in.

Great challah- I add 1-2 extra Tbsp. sugar to it. I make it on the dough setting in my bread machine then let my kids braid it. Then I let in rise in a warm oven for an hour. Then glaze it with a mixture of one egg and 1 Tbsp water. I bake it for about 20-30 min. at 350. My family LOVES it!! Looks like I bought it from a bakery!!

This deserves 10 stars atleast!! Easily the best loaf of bread on this site. Rose nicely, has great texture & flavor. I scalded the milk, cooled it to 100 degrees & proofed the yeast in it with a pinch of sugar.  I then added the 2 eggs & 3 T oil(instead of margarine). I poured that into the machine; combined all dry ingredients & poured that on top of the wet ingrediemts. Set on medium & voila! a beautiful loaf of bread!!

Thanks for the recipe.  Didn't get a chance to turn it into a french toast breakfast.  Family ate it out of the oven for dinner.

The first time you use it in the bread machine, don't use the delayed timer.  Instead, watch the dough to see if it needs more or less milk. Should form a smooth, soft ball after kneading. Test the crust setting, it gets dark fast.  Record this amount of milk and crust time for the next time.  This prevents a dried out or blackened loaf.  I found I needed a bit more milk and a medium crust on  sweet dough cycle.

I've loved Challah ever since I worked for a Jewish family a few years ago and was introduced to this wonderful bread. I now live in a rural Nova Scotia town, and Challah bread isn't something one would usually come accross. Anyway, now I can make this in my bread machine, and I am delighted with the results!!  I too did as another reviewer and set my machine to the dough cycle, so I could take the dough out, braid it, and bake it in a conventional oven.  Once braided, brush the bread with a beaten egg,and sprinkle with poppy or sesame seeds. This is beautiful, great tasting Challah. Thanks Suzy for a wonderful recipe.

Excellant challah bread. Loaf just came out of machine and already half gone. I added 3/4 cup golden raisins and baked on sweet setting and light crust...came out perfect.

To solve the crustiness of that this bread produces, we restrain ourselves and put the loaf into a ziploc bag and put it in the refridgerator overnight.  Who needs to buy those store bought breads now? :D

This bread is SO yummy!  I took the suggestion of another reviewer and made this in my bread maker to the dough stage.  Then I finished with the Bread Machine Challah II recipe.  Fabulous!

I love this bread so much, I could eat the entire thing alone in one sitting!  I'm a huge fan of egg breads and just love the sweet, dense flavor they have and this one fits that bill.  I am going to try some of the other Challah's on this site to see which is better in my humble opinion and I will update.  I am in no way a baker but with my bread machine I don't need to be to yield excellent results for bread.  I kept this exactly as written however I really want to take it out after dough is made and form that braid, I'm sure it doesn't change the flavor at all just makes it look prettier for me to scarf down :-)Update: made again on 2/28 but this time i added about 2 tsp. of honey, I warmed the milk with the butter to 100 degrees and made sure the eggs were room temp and added an extra 1/2 tsp of yeast.  I put in bread machine on dough cycle and after rolled out with my hands best I could into three rolls and braided. put a damp towel over for an hour to rise which it barely did but no matter, I brushed an egg wash on top and baked for 30mins. at 350.  Rose just fine in the oven. Just had to tear off a piece even though it's still very hot but, it's even BETTER than the first loaf I made entirely in the BM.  I don't think I'll be able to try another recipe now!!!Even though the entire process is 4 hours, it's so worth it!

Wow, great bread. I made some in my bread machine and it turned out fabulous. My family enjoyed it as sandwiches, and also just for snacks. Great Recipe. I did only one additional thing to make sure it turned out. I put the milk in a glass measuring cup in my microwave, for 20 seconds, to bring it up to 80F. I find that this temperature is perfect for the best bread. Thanks for the recipe.

So many have already rated this recipe, there isn't much more to say --- but I wanted to rate it so that I could give it 5 stars.  This is an excellent bread machine recipe! The texture is wonderful.  Makes wonderful "salad-type" sandwiches such as chicken or tuna salad. (The bread holds up to the moisture better than Wonder-type bread.) I keep a loaf in my freezer for french toast, too.  I don't change one thing about the recipe and have made it many, many times. Thanks for sharing a fantastic recipe!

This is a fantastic, easy recipe.  I was heating up the milk with the butter but found that heating up the butter, then adding the milk keeps the liquid mixture at the right temp so as to not kill the yeast.  
I also made this by just using the dough cycle.  I then took it out, punched it down and kneaded a bit, braided it and let it rise for about an hour.  I then brushed with milk and sprinkled sugar on it (can you say sweet tooth?) and baked in a 350 oven for about 20 minutes.  While it didn't exactly double in size as I would have thought during the resting, it rose beautifully once in the oven.  A big, beautiful stringy loaf of Challah!  
Make sure to take the temp of the heated milk butter mixture; I believe anything over 120 kills yeast as does salt, so make sure to put the salt in with the liquid.  Also, sometimes I add in some honey and when I do that, I count it towards the liquid measurement otherwise you end up having to add a ton of flour which will make it too heavy.

I made one in my Oster bread machine and one in my Sunbeam bread machine. I followed the directions and a tip to add one extra egg. (I used Jumbo eggs.) The batter was sticky, so I added a bit more flour to each machine, no more than 1/4 cup.  I also floured 2 cups of raisins and added one cup to each when the machine beeped.
I did check both machines to see if I needed to scrape down the sides, the Sunbeam needed it.
The Sunbeam bread rose higher and the raisins mixed in better, the Oster made a prettier loaf, but the raisins weren't evenly distributed (see photo).
The Oster bread tasted almost cake like, delicious. If you like a sweeter bread increase the sugar.
The Sunbeam bread is going to be a gift, so I didn't cut into it to see how the raisins distributed, but in looking at the loaf I see some at the top, so it should be okay.

Best bread I've ever made in my machine, and I've owned and used my breadmaker for about 10 years.  I made it this morning for Thanksgiving, and the whole loaf was gone halfway thru the meal. Make sure to check the dough after the first mix, and be prepared to sprinkle in a few tablespoons of flour if it looks too wet.  Also don't be afraid to restart the cycle after you do that. I actually accidentally used 3 T oil instead of the margarine the first time, and it came out so good I just did that the second time too.  Also made one loaf with regular flour, and the second loaf with bread flour ... bread flour texture was a little better. Definitely a keeper ... I just need to translate this to a 2 lb loaf size.

Used the dough setting, braided it, sat in warm oven for 1 to 1 1/2 hrs and then baked.  (350 for 30-40 minutes until knocking on it sounds hollow) Perfect for french toast! note to self: Spray with water and cover with plastic before putting in warm oven to rise.

I spent today baking both Bread Machine Challah I and Bread Machine Challah II.  I like this recipe much better.  What I ended up doing was making a double recipe on the "dough" setting in my bread machine, and then and making two braided loafs in the oven -- baking them for 25 minutes at 350 (as suggested in version II).  When I rolled out the dough I coated the strands in flour to keep them from merging together during the second (braided) raising of the dough.  I then coated the braids in egg and a little bit of honey and baked.  They came out beautifully.  I also warmed the milk in the microwave for 40 seconds and proofed the yeast with a bit of sugar in the milk for 10 minutes before adding it to the bread machine.

Made the dough in the bread machine, took out and rested for 45 minutes, baked at 350 for 30 minutes in the oven. Looked and smelled amazing but it was a gift for a neighbor. The next one is all mine though:) Thanks.

I like to experiment with different Challah bread recipes and this one remains our family's favorite. Sometimes I set it for the dough cycle, remove it, and let it rise on a floured board, punch it down then braid it and let it rise again. Then I brush on an egg wash and sprinkle with sesame or poppy seeds and bake in oven on a lightly greased cookie sheet for about 30 minutes or until lightly browned. It looks so pretty braided and tastes terrific when spread with butter. When I invite dinner guests, they always ask if I am having that "fantastic braided bread" again! This bread is a classic keeper for sure!

This bread was awsome!  I was looking for a good sweet bread, and this one wins the prize.  Thanks for the tip about the Light Crust setting, because it still turned out very dark on the light setting.  This recipe is going into my permanant recipe box! thanks :)

This was really good. I used butter instead of margarine and set my machine at the dough setting. I then braided it and brushed it with a mixture of egg yolk and a little water then sprinkled with sesame seeds. I let it rise for one hour on a greased baking sheet, and then baked for 30 minutes at 375 degrees. It looked just as good as something from the bakery. I think next time I may add a little more milk or an extra egg because I found it just slightly dry. If you like this bread then you should try the Portuguese Sweet Bread (also on this site). It's similar to challah bread but we liked it even better.

Made it before & the taste was fine but the texture was off.
2nd Attempt: I made this bread again & approached it differently. I now know how to use my BM so I had to add 1 tbsp of flour because it was a bit too wet. I took it out of the machine to try & braid it & had to knead it about 6-7 times so that I could get sticks. My braiding is awful if it isn't in hair apparently. I let it rise in a 110 degree F oven that I would turn on for 10 mins & then turn of for 10 mins. Let it rise for about 30 mins & it was huge. Did an egg + 1 tbsp of water wash on it & baked it at 350F degrees for about 35mins. 

It was a gorgeous, delicious loaf that I now have to make every 2 days because it's the staple bread in our kitchen. I'm not braiding it. Part of the problem some people are having is that they're not warming the milk enough.  With my machine you have to warm things up but I follow the yeast's instruction & warmed the milk to about 126 degrees F because I knew that the margarine was very cold (I cut it up a bit before adding it) & the eggs weren't up to room temp. enough. I also made sure that the flour which is the hardest thing to measure was already measured in a container & I just had to dump it in.

THANK YOU! Now I have to get some Jew friends to teach me more about their amazing cuisine!

great challah. I make it with whole wheat flour, add a Tbsp of vital wheat gluten, and the following replacements: 3 eggs, 1/4 cup honey instead of white sugar, almond/soy milk and oil instead of butter.

Delicious, but a warning:  I added an extra egg after reading some reviews that said it was a little dry... unfortunately, the batter overflowed and ended up all over the inside of my bread machine!  I think it might be a little much for a 1.5 pound machine.  I'll cut the recipe next time.  Even so, it was really delicious.

This turned out fantastic! I made a few changes according to what others have suggested. I substituted white sugar for honey and used unsalted butter instead of margerine. I used the dough cycle on the bread machine and let it rise in the bread machine for an hour. I then made a lovely braid and let it sit for an another hour to rise under a tea towel. I then brushed the braid with egg and honey. It came better than what i expected. I will definately have to make two next time.

I followed this as written. Most excellent!
Oil can be used in place of margarine. It does great as is in the bread machine on full cycle  - of course you won't get the braided look but the texture is just great!

I followed the directions on my yeast package (1 pkg, 1/4 cup warm water and a 1/2 tsp sugar) then reduced the liquid (milk) by 1/4 cup.  I made the dough in the bread machine and baked two medium sized braided loaves with egg wash and poppy seeds for 20 min at 350.  I'm not a fan of how crusty bread machine bread comes out when actually baked in the machine, so this was perfect.  Next time I'm going to try topping the bread with onion flakes, course salt, and poppy seeds like an "everything" bagel - I bet it would be good.

Oh...my...gosh.  This...was...AMAZING!!!!  I cannot believe that your recipe and my bread machine could be such a match made in heaven.  Let rise and punch down twice???  Never again.  This was the PERFECT recipe for the bread machine.  Thank you so very much for posting!

This came out excellent.  I added a tablespoon of honey, let the eggs come to room temperature, warmed the milk to 100 degrees. 

As many others I used the dough cycle on my bread machine (I used the White bread cycle) and after completion of the dough cycle I rolled it out and braided it using 3, approximately 12 inch braids and let rise for 45 minutes and applied a egg wash and then into the oven at 350 for 25 minutes.

It came out very fluffy and soft with a nice crust. Looked Really Good! It was not dense at all. We haven't seen what its like the next day because its all gone.

I tried this recipe twice and had real trouble getting the dough to rise.  Eventually I let the dough rise for about 3 hours and cooked it in the oven, and it turned out really well.  With raisins it's a nice breakfast bread.

I have made this recipe more times that I can count!  My family loves it and my bff's two college boys love it and I make it for them all the time.  It's super easy and has never failed me...never.  I braid it and make it into a circle which is gorgeous or just do a short braid and put it in a loaf pan.  It's awesome!

I;ve been using this recipe so many times , and even with bread machine it tastes pretty good , except it has a thick hard crust , which i don't really like . So the last time i made them , i only let the bread machine takes care of the dough and i took it out , braided them and let it sit for half an hour and baked it for 20 minutes , at 375 F , the result was beautiful challah and tastes delicious !!! awesome recipe , i didn't even change a thing !!

I can't help but wonder if this is what it's supposed to taste like...? It's not very good.
I added a 3rd egg like someone else suggested. The texture of the bread is fine, but it didn't rise very much and is a very dense loaf.
I won't be making this again.

This was very good, I made for Sabbath and we just kept eating it all weekend long.  We had it for toast the next morning, and for sandwiches all day long.  I did as the others suggested and braided the loaf, let it rise again 40 minutes, and brushed the loaf with beaten egg white and water.  I also replaced about 1 cup of the flour with whole wheat because we try to get our whole grains in as much as possible.  This will probably be our mainstay bread, I'll play with the recipe somemore, replacing as much of the flour with whole wheat without destroying the bread in itself, maybe try using honey instead of sugar, and I will probably make it in a 9x5 loaf as well for sandwiches and toasting.

I make this bread for my family every Friday.  I have made some modifications...I add about 1T honey for sweetness.  I also make two small loaves, one with raisins and one plain.  It makes the best french toast the next day.  Additionally, I set my bread machine for dough and remove after the cycle is complete, need briefly, braid and bake according to directions for bread machine challah II.  Thank you for a great recipe and a new tradition for Shabbat!

I did not know what Challah was when I made this, so I didn't know what to expect. This is a great slightly sweet, fluffy yet filling bread. It's great as toast, too! I've made this 2 or 3 times and it has never failed to please us.

I have to echo the majority of the other reviews and say that this recipie was OUTSTANDING!! I don't know what those who gave this recipie a poor rating were thinking?? They must have done something wrong!  I did add one extra egg, and only used the dough cycle on my 2-lb. bread machine. I braided, let rise again, and brushed with an egg wash; baked 15 minutes at 375 and VOILA!  The loaf was big, with a beautiful, dark crust and  wonderful, rich, and soft on the inside! My 7-year old son helped, and when he tasted the warm bread, he said "MOM, THIS BREAD ROCKS!!! WE HAVE TO COMMIT THIS RECIPIE TO MEMORY!!!"  This will definitely be a family favorite!!  Thanks!!

This is the best bread ever. I followed the recipe with a couple of additions. I was looking to make all bread very soft like store bought, and after researching I found if you add 1 tsp. of vital wheat gluten, 1 TBSP. of soy lecithin granules, and 1 TBSP of Malt barley syrup... You have a huge loaf of the softest bread ever!!! Thanks for the delicious recipe. Will be making this more often!!!

I've never made challah before, this recipe was both easy and excellent.  Used the dough cycle on my bread machine, took the dough out and braided it, then let rise for an hour before putting on an egg wash and baking for 30 min.  The bread is sweet and soft, very delicious.  Looking forward to using it for some sandwiches and french toast!

It is a good recipe but really enough for a 2 pound bread.  It rose all the way to the top and got stuck on the lid.  I think cutback the flour a little.

Soft, delicious and so easy!  I made sure my milk was warm when adding to the machine, but otherwise just followed the recipe!  I will be making this again and again.  Great plain, with butter, or in French toast.

I made this precisely to the recipe expect for adding a tbs or so more sugar. I have a panasonic, 6 mo old bread machine. This worked perfectly. I set it to medium and light crust and it came out soft and delicious. This is one of the only recipes we have tried so far which has not become heavy once it cooled.

I'm in love with this recipe. The key is to stand over your bread maker and see if the dough becomes a smooth ball shape after a few minutes of the machine kneading. If it's crumbly add some milk or eggs, if its really sticky add a sprinkle of flour until it turns smooth.  I've made this with wheat flour, added raisins and just plain followed the recipe and I've had great results every time.

A favorite bread machine recipe!  I added 2 Tbsp. potato flour for better texture & better keeping qualities (purchase at King Arthur Flour in VT).   I also added 2 Tbsp. wheat germ for extra nutritional quality.

Very tasty!  I made the dough in the bread machine.  When the cycle was finished the dough was very sticky so I added flour and worked it in until the consistency felt right.  I braided the bread, gave it an egg wash and baked it at 350 for 30 minutes.  It was an amazing loaf of bread.  Thank you Suzy for sharing.

So I made a few substitutions, but it turned out great!  I used 1/2 white whole wheat flour (my new favorite flour!).  I also used honey instead of sugar.  Turned out perfect in my bread machine.  Yay!

The tastiest bread I've ever had! I love it! I used butter instead of margarine because that's all I had and it came out fine :).

Excellent challah!  I followed the recipe exactly, except that I substituted soy milk for regular milk, because we're lactose intolerant.  It came out perfectly in the bread machine, on the light setting.  I will be making this again and again to use for sandwiches during the week.

Good, but not stellar. Even on the light setting, crust came out thick, dark and slightly tough. Not as moist as I like my bread.

This had a really good flavor. I mixed it in the bread machine, and baked it in the oven, I liked how it rose so much when it baked, I was afraid that I had done something wrong, like not adding enough yeast, but it rose perfectly in the oven. I did find that the crust got hard fairly quickly, but other than that, it was good!

Awesome taste and texture. My breadmaker has a Sweet setting which I used for this bread and it worked out nicely. I scalded the milk then put the butter in the hot milk to melt it and cool down the liquid (an old trick from another bread recipe I make).  I also added 1/2 cup of golden raisins.  Thanks so much for sharing this wonderful easy recipe.

This is a great recipe - I make it almost every week. To make it a little healthier, I use canola oil in place of the margarine and whole wheat flour for 2 of the 3 cups of flour called for. (Because of the whole wheat flour, I also add 2 tsp of wheat gluten to help with the rising.) I make just the dough in the bread machine and then braid and bake in the oven afterwards at 350 for around 40 minutes. I have some in the oven right now and the house smells delicious!

Delicious challah! I let the bread machine do the mixing and kneading, then shaped the loaf into a braid by hand, brushed with an egg wash and sprinkled it with some coarse sea salt. It looked like the Platonic ideal of challah when it came out of the oven, and tasted pretty darn good, too. Thanks for a super recipe! This is a keeper.

So tasty and moist! I am still pretty new at using the bread machine, so I got nervous when it looked really wet during the rising time. Much to my relief it came out perfectly! We love the taste, and my husband said it's his new favorite bread. I followed another reviewer's advice and took the bread out of the machine right when it was finished so it would not continue to cook/get brown.

This a quick and easy challah recipe with a great taste and texture.  I threw all the ingredients into my machine after lunch and it was ready when my boys got home from school.  They LOVED it.  I checked during the mixing phase to make sure it didn't need more flour, but the recipe was fine as written.  I used the last 2" of the machine baked loaf for Tonga Toast (the yummy cinnamon/banana french toast they serve at Disneyworld's Polynesian Resort) two days later and it was delicious.  My machine is making another loaf right now...with three little boys lined up watching and asking when it will be ready!

My family and I love this challah!  I made it several times in my bread machine, but my machine broke.  We loved this bread so much that I made it by hand for a while.  Now I use a food processor with dough hooks.  After letting it rise for about an hour and a half, I braid it, let it rise again, brush it with beaten egg, and cook it in the oven.  This bread has just the right density and texture, and the flavor is very rich.

Wow!  This was amazing!  Better than any store bought Challah.  Soo good.  I made it once before & it was OK.  The second time I made it I ensured that all of the ingredients were at room temperature.  I'm pretty sure that made a HUGE difference.  It was soft, gooey & sweet.  Perfection!

This is the first sweet bread I have made in my bread machine, and it turned out absolutely perfect. I mixed the warm milk and the eggs with the yeast and let it sit for 10 minutes before I added the dry ingredients and the butter. I replaced 1 cup of the flour with ground almonds, and baked the bread on Sweet and Light Crust settings - it turned out perfect! This will be a staple now!

I've been baking this bread for a few years now.  People just keep asking me to make it for different occasions.  It is wonderful and the dough has a very nice stretch to it.  You do not have to change anything at all.

Gorgeous bread. Added an extra 2 tbsp of sugar. I made it for my fiancees co workers and they were impressed. The dough was extremly sticky while it was on the dough setting in my machine so I added about 1/4 cup of additional bread flour. When I took it out it was still very sticky and hard to handle so I heavily floured my hands and work area and it seemed to help. I kneaded in 1/4 cup of golden raisins. and brushed on some egg wash. Took only 20 mins on a greased and floured cookie sheet. Before he took it to work the next day I wrapped it in large foil and put it on the keep warm setting in the oven at 200 degrees and it softened up.

Delicious and sweet just as challah should be! I've made it just as the recipe calls for and have substituted part of the white flour for whole wheat to make it healthier and it's STILL delicious! Good job!

I added an extra egg to this recipe.  It was the first bread I've made with a bread machine.  I took it out and braided it before the second rising.  It is a perfect texture with a delicious sweet taste and aroma.  If you're a Challah lover, this is the recipe for you!

This bread is fantastic. Quick, simple and delicious. It's great for sandwiches, french toast, and best of all- stuffing! I used this bread in the Slow Cooker Stuffing recipe on this site and it was hands down the best I've ever had, and the hit of the holidays.

Used breadmaker to make this dough, let dough rest five minutes, formed three ropes (about 12 inches) and braided on greased cookie sheet.  Brushed with egg wash, covered with plastic wrap, and refrigerated overnight.  Allowed to come to room temperature, brushed again with egg wash, and baked at 350 till beautiful.  Delicious, attractive, and easy.  Best when eaten the day it's baked.

This was my first time trying out a challah bread recipe. After reading the reviews I decided to do the right thing and try the actual recipe without altering it. It tasted good. I make it for a french toast bake and was a huge hit. My only comments on the bread is that it did become incredibly crumbly and seemed a bit on the dry side. I made it late at night and cut it up the next morning. It was incredibly hard to get a clean cut of bread with out crumbs going everywhere. Bur I have nothing to compare it to. I will probably try to look for a different recipe next time.

Just a delicious bread recipe - super texture. I used the ingredients as directed, although took the advice of reviewers and put the machine on the dough setting, and after taking the dough out, braided it, let it rise an hour and baked it at 375 degrees for 25 minutes (I found any more browned it too much, and it was done enough). Thanks for the recipe Suzy - a definite make again! And a P.S. - I used this bread to make Fluffy French Toast (from this site), and it was very tasty.

Excellent recipe.  Taste and texture are very good.  I might use a little less yeast than recipe called for because when the bread started baking, it rose even higher & touched the lid of the bread machine.  It made terrific French Toast this morning!

Oh..my..gosh..This bread is sooo good! I followed the recepie exactly, except I used the "sweet bread" setting. It was perfect.  Good flavor, texture, color, everything. Had some the next morning, and it was not nearly as yummy. Next time I will use the leftovers for french toast.

I love this bread and so does my family. I make it with splenda for a lighter calorie bread.  I take if out of the machine asap so the the crust doesnt get to stiff.  I make it at least once a month!

Absolutely fantastic! The texture and crust are perfect. I used all purpose flour and can't imagine bread flour working any better.  Extremely delicious for snacking or sandwiches. I've also made the dough in the machine and then baked it in the oven. Both ways are absolutely scrumptious.

WOW! What else can I say, I will never buy bread again. I have made this bread atleast 5 times in the past two weeks. It is great. I also like others let the machine do the work and then take it out and make the bread however I want. I have braided it, created a circle loaf,rolls, and just a regular loaf to use for sandwiches.  I plan on making french toast with it next. I can't say enough about this bread. The dough is great to work with. I  added a little honey to the dough on one loaf and that was great too.  My husband and kids love it too! Thanks so much for the great recipe!

I adjusted the recipe to make a 2 pound loaf.  Didn't know how it would work, but thought it was worth a try.  The bread rose to the top of my machine - it was just beautiful.  Crust was wonderful, texture was great.  Nice big, light loaf.  Will make this again.  I think I'll just do the dough next time and try braiding it like a real challah - I may impress myself!

Followed advice of other reviews and added a 3rd egg.  Used 1/4 cup honey in lieu of sugar and added about a quarter cup extra flour while dough was mixing.  I always proof my yeast - the only time I didn't,  my bread failed to rise properly in the machine. Nuked the milk until warm to touch (about 40 seconds, stirring once) before adding honey and yeast.
Using my bread machine, I set to dough while mixing ingredients.  When cycle ended (including rising time), I coated the dough ball with EVOO and baked loaf on 2 pound sweet bread setting, light crust (complete with the mixing and rising.)  
I pulled the loaf out of the pan quickly after it finished baking.   Loaf came out perfectly,  the top pressed to the window of my bread machine. 
4 stars because I altered the recipe.

Used olive oil instead of butter and also did it on the dough cycle. Then I braided it and baked at 375. Basted with egg a few times while baking.Was very good.

Thanks for this great recipe!  Simple and delicious.  What more could you ask for?
I have made several variations of the bread including one using oat flour and honey instead of sugar.  This is a great basic recipe for a bread machine.  It can easily be modified to suit your taste and available flour variety.
Also, it makes the best bread for grilled cheese!  Toasts up perfectly.  Excellent texture.  This has become our favorite sandwich bread.  I make it every week!  Kudos Suzy!

Very good flavor and texture, mine turned out a little dark but that may just be my machine.  Also, you do not get the nice crust of challah in a bread machine, but who cares when you can get challah w so little work?

Excellent challah recipe! I need to add an extra 1/4 cup of flour to make the dough workable and not so sticky, since I use this recipe as a base dough for Filipino sweet bread (pan de ube, pan de coco, pan de nutella, etc.) and it works like a charm. Even better than the Asian bakeries, actually! The only problem is, the family loves them so much, they're gone the first night and I have to make another batch.

Seriously?! Best loaf of bread that I have ever produced with my bread machine. I placed ingredients in the order rec'd by my bread machine. I watched the dough at first and had to add about 4 TBLS of flour to make the dough less sticky. Once I got the dough right I left for work. When I got home I had a perfect loaf, with the exception of dark sides (darn machine). I am using this bread to make the French Toast Souffle.

I have used this recipe many times...trying others than returning.  It has become a staple in our home and has become the most requested from hostesses when asking what to bring to any dinner Shabbat or otherwise.  I even started experimenting by replacing a cup of whole wheat for the flour total.  Kudos to Suzy.

Favorite bread machine recipe - use dough setting and braid after letting it rise in warm oven. Add an egg wash and you'll have a beautiful bread after 20-30 minutes in a 375 oven.

I have made this twice now and both times it was excellent!  I made it in my bread machine for dough and then shaped it & baked it in the oven.  Once as a loaf and once as rolls.  It has been a hit for my family too - the rolls were great in their lunchboxes :)

I've never had real Challah before so I can't say whether this recipe makes "good Challah", but after my sister complained she wanted me to make a fine-textured bread, I decided to try this recipe - and while it might not be the best Challah in the world, it is an AWESOME bread machine bread. After the first rise, the dough was a little too sticky, so I added about 1/4 cup of flour. Other than that, I followed all the directions precisely. The dough rose so well that it puffed up out of the pan and was nearly touching the roof of my bread machine! Once done, the crust looked a bit burnt, but sliced easily. The top crust is wonderfully flaky, and the bread itself is soft and airy as a cloud! It's best served still warm, in a big, thick slice topped with sweet-cream butter - but, once it's a few days old, it also makes brilliant french toast or bread pudding! I plan to bake this bread many times in the future (My sister liked it so much that she wants to have it always in the house!)

made this yesterday for Easter, came out great!!  I did put this into the bread machine but only hit the dough cycle.  When done my daughter divided the dough  into 3 parts made 3 long snakes out of them and braided the dough together tucking the ends under onto a greased cookie sheet.    I then placed in dough into the oven (not turned on)  covered the bread with a clean kitchen towel and rested the dough for about 25 minutes.  
When done resting, take dough out of the oven. 

At this point pre-heat oven to 350 degrees.

 Now make an egg wash: take one egg white with 1 tablespoon of water whisk with a fork and brush on top of bread I also sprinkled seasame seeds on top too.  return bread/dough to oven for aprox 25 to 30 minutes til golden brown.

The next time I make this bread my husband suggested to me to meke this bread with raisins in it, that sounds yummy too!!

This is one of the better recipes I have done in my bread machine.  The texture is great, especially the crust.  I made french toast this morning with the left overs and even though I burned it a little (my mother-in-las called and wouldn't stop talking), it was really great.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Like many other reviews, I chose to use the Dough cycle, braid the bread, rise for 1 hour, use egg wash and bake at 350 for 30 minutes.  I also added an extra 1/4 cup of milk as some others recommended more milk and used 2 cups bread flour and 1 cup wheat.  It rose nicely and baked wonderfully.  The flavor was not as sweet as I'm used to with other Challah (so next time I will bump up the sugar a bit) but texture was fairly dense as expected with this type of bread.  Definitely recommend!

Good recipe.  I braid my challah, but I've received a lot of compliments using this recipe.  In fact, I was designated THE challah baker for all future events after my first attempt with this recipe!  

I follow as instructed, but only put the bread machine on the dough setting.  I take out the dough, braid, brush with an egg wash and bake at 350 for about 30 minutes (or until perfectly brown and pretty).

This was the best bread I have ever made. In the past I have had to "up" the yeast to prevent stunted loaves. I don't know if it is because I used 2 tsps of yeast or because I used the sweet setting, but this bread hit the top of the machine. It was amazingly light. My husband , who normally dislikes machine breads, said "Do not change a thing - this bread is perfect!"

So good! I've made this 2 days in a row now, and it's been easy & great. I have a 2 lb bread machine capacity and with the setting on 1 & 1/2 lb (light setting), it rose all the way to the top & even stuck to the lid the first time I made it. So it was a little tricky getting out of the pan, but well worth it. This bread makes THE best french toast. I have had to almost double the amount double the liquid used for making the french toast, because the bread soaks it up SO much. A filling, homemade breakfast for my family!! I'll never make f. toast with any other bread!

Excellent!  I did the dough cycle and braided it as others suggested.  I also heat the milk then let it cool to 110 degrees.  All other ingredients are at room temperature.  Delicious!!  I would like to try a few changes just so it could be a touch moister.

This bread was quite good and definitely very easy.  I think it could use 1/4 teaspoon more salt, though.

This bread is *tasty* and really easy to make. I used 3 eggs and real butter instead of margerine. The only downside is that the bread was too big for my machine. I will make the dough again and bake it in the oven.

I don't have a bread machine, so I made this by hand.  Warmed the milk, and added it after the flour, so that the eggs wouldn't cook.  I used 1 c. wheat flour and 2 c. bread flour.  I let it rise in an oiled bowl for a little over an hour, and it didn't rise at all.  I was a little concerned, but I thought, "oh well, it'll still taste good."  And so I braided it and tossed it in the oven at 350 for 25 - 30 minutes.  It rose beautifully in the oven, which I was pleased with.  This was delicious, and made great grilled cheese sandwhiches and french toast.  Will certainly be making this one again.

Excellent. I never got it wrong. Try the variations: Throw in some seseme seeds. And, use brown sugar instead of sugar. Any variation works out fine.

This was so good.  Followed the directions exactly but I still had trouble with the darkness of the bread.  I baked on light but the sides of the bread still got a little burnt.  It could be my machine, but next time I will not bake for the full time.  Will make again since everyone raved about it even if it was a little well done.

THE easiest recipe for bread machine bread with the most flavor ever!  Thanks for the reviews that mentioned to bake on 'light' crust.  Comes out perfect everytime.  I always rolled my eyes when I read that some people make bread every night (why when you can buy it!) not anymore!  This recipe is soooo easy and yummy (I know it by heart now!) it's so simple to make and have on hand.  PLUS the family LOVES the aroma through the home...free potpourri!  lol. :) THANKS!

This bread had a yummy flavor but the loaf was small and very dense, not the typical Challah I was expecting.  I really liked the flavor but I don't think I'll use this recipe again. (revised review) I tried this recipe again on accident (forgot I tried it before!) with our new bread machine and it was a lot better.  I made it especially for dipping with fondue and our guests loved the bread and requested the recipe!   I think it worked out better because our new machine had a crust color setting and is more precise with the baking.

I slightly modified this recipe. I used Spelt Flour, Soy Milk and Brown Sugar. I also had to adjust the amount of flour because the dough was very soft. So I ended up using 3 3/4 Cups of flour. It turned out so well. Definitely the best bread I've ever made.

This was a very disappointing bread recipe.  I followed the recipe without making any adjustments, and the loaf I ended up with was dense, dry, and not very tasty at all.

This bread was wonderful....my kids loved it so much that I made a second loaf while they devoured the first one...We made it four times in one week...I also made the dough on the dough setting, then froze it.  Later in the week I defrosted, shaped and let it rise, then baked in the regular oven.  It was great this way and I could shape it into the traditional braid.

This is a perfect recipe exactly as is, but I never cook it in the bread machine. Instead I put it on the dough setting only. Then pull it out onto a lightly floured surface and divide the dough into three roughly equal parts, roll each piece gently to lengthen each strip, and braid. Put onto a baking sheet lightly coated with cooking spray, and then cover the dough with an egg wash (one scrambled egg). bake on 350 for 24 minutes. Perfect every time - people go crazy for it

I have made this bread a few times and it always comes out great. I do add an extra egg, however. I have even added cinnamon to give it an extra kick of flavor.

Followed the directions exactly and measured carefully - no problems at all with dryness. This is a wonderfully textured bread, especially for French toast or regular toast.  I worried about using the regular yeast without proofing and might have subbed with quick a rise had

So far it's the best bread machine recipe.  No changes needed.  Never fail.  Amazing how a few simple ingredients can yield such a fantastic bread, while other recipes, not so good.

Oh so yummy.  
Comes out fine with all purpose flour (instead of bread flour). If using salted butter then reduce salt addition. Can substitute some of the milk with honey (~2tbsp) and reduce the sugar (~1tbsp less).

I have hyperemesis gravidarum, and have so much trouble eating that I get almost all of my nutrition through an IV. The ONLY thing I have been able to keep down for the last month is this bread. A slice straight out of the bread maker with a tiny bit of butter and honey is soooooooo good. The only challenge is keeping my husband and kids from eating it before I get the chance to have some. They love it as much as I do, and eat it plain or make it into French toast. I have a feeling that I will keep making this long after my baby is born and I'm eating normally again!

This recipe turned out great. I tossed in an extra egg, although I don't think it even needed it. I will try it with just 2 next time. I did set the machine to Dough Only and baked it at 375 degrees for 30 minutes. I think its the best Challah I've ever made!

Yes, I too am joining the chorus for this positively delicious and easy bread.  I've made it several times already and it's always fantastic.  I did make some changes after reading the reviews of other users, namely: I added 3 eggs (room temp!); used 1 cup of milk; scalded the milk;I used extra light olive oil rather than margarine; had to add additional flour due to more liquid from egg/milk, probably about 3 tablespoons but, with all breadmaking, watch your ball, i.e., sweetbread, it should be slightly glossy, very, very, slightly sticky, which is okay, since after taking it out of the machine to punch down, one adds flour on a kitchen surface to shape, etc.; as such, I did remove the dough from the machine, punched it down and braided it; made two loaves rather than one large one; gave them an egg wash; have sprinkled with either sesame seeds or poppy seeds (I've posted two pics); one time braiding them and shaping into a circle in cake pans (see pic); I baked for 22 minutes at 350, turning the pan with the loaves halfway through baking process in order to evenly bake them; I also covered with aluminium foil about 11-12 minutes into baking so as not to overbrown. 

With this recipe, I won't ever have to buy Challah again at the store or bakery !

A truly wonderful recipe. I used AP flour instead of bread flour and it turned out great anyway. Great flavor, great texture. It was light and fluffy, probably lighter than what you can buy in stores. I served it sprinkled with powdered sugar. My husband loved it too, will be making again and again!

This is a  more than  a 5 star  recipe ! I always wanted to make a Challah bread in my bread machine and tried this recipe today. I did not need to adjust any of the ingredients..  The only change I made was using BUTTER instead of margarine The bread rose well and all the features of a hand made Challah loaf.   Will certainly  be a firm family favourite. Many thanks for posting this recipe.

This recipe is fabulous! I added a touch more sugar to the recipe and used kosher salt (to lessen the salt taste) and it was a huge hit! Definitely recommend!

I was somewhat skeptical but the bread turned out great! I used 1 egg plus 2 yolks instead of the 2 eggs. Texture and taste were excellent. I may have left the crust on Med and not light because it turned out quite light in color. THX!

This didn't work for me the first time I tried it, the "light" crust cycle on my bread machine wasn't enough, and I ended u with a doughy loaf. It smelled wonderful though, so I'm going to give it a try again.

This is a good challah recipe after all, except the dough was so sticky after the dough cycle finished. I had to return the dough back to the bread machine with 1 1/2 cup of flour (whole wheat flour used here) for a 2nd mix. The dough then was split into 2 parts. Rolled out andBraided

I've never had Challah before so I don't know how it's supposed to taste, but I can tell you this bread ROCKS!  I made it specifically for french toast (used the Fluffy French Toast recipe), and had to stop myself from eating it so there would be enough. I heated the milk and used warm eggs (put the uncracked eggs in hot water for 10min) to help activate the yeast. I used veg. oil instead of margarine, and increased the flour a little. I also made the dough in my bread machine but split in half after rise 2, placed in 2 loaf pans, let rise again then baked at 350 for 20min. I wrapped the cooled bread the night before using for french toast, but I should've left it out so it could dry out a bit more...

This was pretty simiple to make and that is a keeper in my book, my husband liked the taste of it, he used it on his daily lunch sandwich, but it's better for soups or stews, to soak up the gravy!!

Suzy, this is an OUTSTANDING recipe.  I used the bread machine just to make the dough (followed recipe exactly), and then braided and let rise an additional 30 minutes in oven.  Then removed and coated with egg wash and cooked at 350 for about 25 minutes.  I had a little extra dough so i put them next to the braided challah and tried them with poppy seeds!  Delicious, turned out perfectly.  I am not worried about it turning hard or crunchy because this bread will be gone in one sitting!  Cheers for this.

A favorite in our home.  Easy recipe, good taste.  This is a light bread but it holds up very well.  Works well with bread flour and all-purpose, too.

I absolutely love this recipe.  I've made it many times in my bread machine and it is always wonderful.  My family loves this bread, and it makes THE BEST french toast - that is, if there's any left the next day.

Gorgeous crust and a great taste.  Sadly, mine didn't rise at all.  I know my yeast is fresh and I even put it on an extended cycle in the machine :(  Next time, I would be careful not to let the salt and yeast come into contact.  Ah, well!  Live and learn :)  Chopped up into cubes, it made some pretty nice garlic croutons.

This is the best recipe I've ever made in my bread machine!  I use soy or rice milk instead of dairy milk, and it turns out wonderful.  I saw several people found the dough too dry after a couple minutes, but I always find it's too wet and I have to add more flour, between 1/2 to 2 cups more.  I also adjusted the recipe to use three eggs, instead of two, after trying it a couple times.  I use the sweet, light, large setting on my machine.  Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe!

Wowzers! This is the best. Cooked up beautifully, easy to cut into perfect slices. I have a problem with some bread machine breads being hard to cut. Light, fluffy & delish. I put the milk, eggs, butter, sugar & salt in a bowl, nuke it (on the beverage cycle) until the butter melts, put this in the bread machine canister & add bread flour. I did use 2 t of yeast. Will be making this bread often! Thanks.

Excellent Challah.  I normally take my dough out of the machine after the first rise, but I was sick and feeling lazy today, so I just let the machine do it all.   It came out wonderful.  The only thing I did different was that I heated the milk prior to putting it in the machine so the yeast would activate.

Awesome!!  I made in entirely in the machine - got requests to make it again.  Used a few tablespoons wheat bread flour since I did not have quite three cups of white flour.

This bread is wonderful!  I used the bread machine to make the dough and then, like others suggested, braided it, allowed it to raise and baked it.
It was beautiful!  I am amazed that I did it myself!!  Thank you for sharing this recipe!!!!

Came out looking perfect! I was a bit worried about my yeast since it didn't seem to rise at first, but once it started baking it sprang to life. I set it on the sweet bread setting which has a shorter baking cycle. It was a beautiful light yellow and very tender. I threw in a handful of rasins and made yummy french toast this morning!

Great recipe!  I have a 2# Oster machine and I left all ingredients the same except I used a full pkg of yeast (2 tsps) instead of 1 1/2 tsps - result was a very fluffy, sweet egg bread.  Thanks - just what I was looking for!

I baked this to use for french toast this morning. It was WONDERFUL! I just used the bread machine on the dough setting, Then did as another reviewer suggested and finished with the directions from Challah II. I just made a second loaf. This time I subbed one cup of the bread flour with white whole wheat flour. Still came out GREAT. Same sweet yummy taste, and a bit heartier. I'll make this often!

Fast and easy to mix up.  Nice texture and flavor.  Wanted to make bread pudding with this - but looks like it will all be eaten as slices.  Glad the recipe indicated to use the light setting on the bread machine - got a nice golden brown. (Usually I have to use Medium to get that color!)Good will make again!

It turned out light & chewy. I used kosher salt so it's a bit saltier than I expected. Next time I'll try table salt or less kosher salt. The smell was wonderful while it baked & everyone in my house gathered around to try it when it came out. I think this is going to become a regular for the bread machine.

Using the lightest seting for my bread machine, the crust came out very thick and too dark.  However, the bread was delicious (it rose and was not crumbly at all) and I will make this again.  Thanks for the recipe.

The high sugar content resulted in a very dark, overdone crust, even at the lightest setting for my machine.  Depending on the machine, you might have to work with the recipe to get a loaf that cooks quickly enough to allow you to remove it early.  Aside from the crust, the taste was good.

This is was a hit with the kids and adults.  Everyone loved it! I did modify it a bit though. Iadded a bit of yellow food coloring and I only used the bread machine through the first rise and then removed it and continued to knead by hand.  I braided it, brushed it with egg yolk and water and let it rise again.  I baked it at 350 until brown.  Excellent.  One of the best breads I've ever had!

I have been using this recipe for almost a year and a half.  The first time I tasted the challah bread, I almost fell from disbelief that I baked a bread this good!  I set my machine to bake it in the early morning hours while I sleep.  Adding the three dairy products cold keeps them from spoiling.  They reach room temperature by the time the machine starts.  And I always substitute butter for margarine!

This is a great bread machine recipe!  I took it out at dough stage to braid and bake.  With an egg wash and poppy seeds this was fantastic!  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!!!

Fantastic flavour and texture.  However, I substituted brown sugar for the white sugar in the recipe.  Extremely easy too, we throw everything into the bread machine and wake up with a great loaf of bread for breakfast as promised.

I knew this bread was going to be outstanding when I saw the finished dough.  
Wow.  I set my bread maker to a manual setting so that I can knead, let rise,
and shape into a braid like traditional challah.  My roommate says
that she has never tasted challah this good, even from her two favorite kosher bakeries
in Manhattan!

This is absolutely one of the best recipes I have ever used. Husband loves it, kids love it, neighbors love it, and it is always a big hit at family, church, and social gatherings. Great alone, with butter, and makes fantastic french toast and bread pudding! A definate must for any bread lovers recipe file.

I followed the instructions exactly, adding the milk, yeast, sugar and eggs first and then the rest of the ingredients on top. It turned out great! Unfortunately,  it didn’t make it to the dinner table- the whole family ate it straight out of the machine! Thanks for this recipe, it will be my go-to bread from now on!

To be honest I'm currently in the process of making the recipe.  After looking at the dough after kneading, I'm very surprised there have been reviewers that described it as 'crumbly'.  I had to add a fair amount of bread flour to get the dough to form a ball.  Before adding the flour my dough was far more similar to muffin batter in consistency than a yeasted dough.  For those of us who have settings on our bread machines for different loaf sizes, I am also wondering what loaf size setting the author might recommend using?  I decided to split the difference on my first attempt and set the machine at a 1.5lb loaf.  I'll weigh in again in a couple hours when the bread is finished and share results.

First time making challah bread, followed a tip in the comments and used 3 eggs instead of two, and added a little extra milk.  I feel it could have used a lower oven temp (I didn’t use the bread machine to bake it.)  followed a comment tip for the baking as well so it’s a tad dark on top but otherwise it turned out wonderful!

I was upset with this whole experience. I'm a seasoned cook and have used my bread machine a lot. I was frustrated with this recipe as it didn't specify the loaf size which is crucial to actually baking the bread in the machine.  I perused the reviews and didn't see it mentioned. So I ended up baking the dough per many reviews' suggetions, following the recipe of the other challah recipe on Allrecipes. Well I let it rise for 1.75 hours after 1-1.5 wasn't enough (and it was still hard to manage but I was a little pressed for time) and then I eventually baked it in a loaf pan. Whole thing came out awful. I would be willing to try again but I would have been spared if the size was listed in the original recipe. Maybe I should stick to cooking over baking haha.

I just made this bread today. It is sooo delicious!! I made it exactly as the recipe states. Next time I will leave it in the bread machine for about 10-15 minutes longer after it shuts off...it was a little bit doughy but that could just be my machine. I will be making this again tomorrow!

I am new to bread machine baking.  My machine gives me a choice to pick a loaf size.  Is this for 1 1/2# or 2#?  I gave this a 5 star rating because of the majority of ratings are very positive (the reason I choose this recipe).

I used quite a bit of softened butter instead of margarine because I like the taste and softer texture. I got a very thick, dark, but soft crust on my loaf. I also substituted one cup of the bread flour with ground flax & brown rice flour. The texture will always be more crumbly when using flours without gluten, but I toast my slices in a pan and it’s something wonderful you’ll never find in a supermarket bread, not even the expensive health food store bread. Even better when used in French toast or bread pudding. During the holiday season I use eggnog in my French toast mixture - this bread in thick slices soaks it all up and makes a custard like texture. With extra cinnamon, it’s to die for. I’ll be using this recipe as my base from now on. Adding pumpkin and sunflower seeds, as well as dried fruit is awesome as well.

I used other reviewers' suggestions, and used "dough" setting on my machine, then took it out, laid it on a floured piece of wax paper and formed/ cut it into long pieces then braided it, let it rise an hour, painted with egg wash, then cooked in oven.  Also, my bread maker is smaller capacity so I used less flour and yeast, but kept the eggs and milk the same since most commented that they needed more of those ingredients, anyway. I cooked it at 350 for 25 minutes, but it could have been longer. I may try 375 for 25 minutes or maybe just longer at 350 next time.

Wonderful tasting. Used my Hamilton beach bread maker, set on 2 lb sweet bread  with light crust setting. I did add three eggs. It turned out perfectly and keeps for at least  two days (it was all gone by then.) I also discovered it was perfect for Communion bread.

This is the best bread I have ever made, EVER.  And I have tried several recipes.  I used 1/2 cup of 2% milk and 1/4 cup of heavy cream.  I used GHEE instead of butter or margarine.  My family was foaming at the mouth. This is the closest to STORE bread I have ever made EXCEPT this bread is soft, bounces back and is just the perfect balance in texture.  This is the only recipe I will ever use, I will end up making sweet versions, garlic Italian versions, ect.

Love the recipe, but like others I only machine for dough prep. Kids braid it, let rise again, then brush on egg wash with 1tbls water + 1 egg. Sometimes add sesame or poppy seeds. Bake at 350F for ~20min. Always a hit for taste and presentation.

Very good but not as yellow as egg bread. Will make it again. Did not bake it in my bread maker, used dough cycle (which takes 1 hr 40 minutes), then punched it down, covered it with a damp towel and let it rise for 1 hour in my warmed oven. Cut into 3 sections and braided it. Let it rise 40 minutes, covered with the damp towel (some dough stuck to the towel). It was huge! Egg washed it and baked it @ 350 for 20 minutes. It was light and airy and golden brown. I did not bake it in my cuisinart bread maker because from experience, it would have had a hard crust and I wanted to avoid that. Do not start this unless you have accounted for the time it takes to make it, I didn't and we ate it after our meal.  My husband threatened me with divorce if I change the recipie in any way! Thanks for the recipe, it's a keeper.

I used the recipe, but used the dough setting on my bread machine, added dried cranberries , and braided the dough.  Egg wash and in the oven.  It turned out fabulous.  I'll be making it again.  I added a photo here as well.

The result is a reproducible; i have made this 3 times and it works great with a CuisinArt CBK-200 bread machine; it will fill out the bread pan fully and press against the bread machine window; for lighter crust (even on light crust setting, it darkens a lot...into black on the crust), i suggest to take it out 5-7 minutes early. Very good recipe.

This is by far the best challah bread I have ever tasted!  I chose the dough selection on my bread machine and once the dough was ready, I divided it into three equal portions which I used to form into a braided loaf.   After an hour of rising and brushing with egg wash, I baked the challah at 350 degrees for twenty minutes.  The aroma of the challah baking in the oven was heavenly!  My family enjoyed this bread so much that I've already baked two loaves in one week!

The only change I made to this recipe was to add a 3rd egg and reduce the sugar to 1/8 c. It turned out perfectly! I think this is going to be our daily bread now it's so yummy!

This recipe is delicious but it needed about 3/4 cup of water, too.

It's a fantastically simple recipe!  In fact, it  works great even without the machine! Seriously.  I live overseas and  teach kids at home. I wanted an easy loaf for the New Year. I figured, an easy loaf is better than nothing. I usually braid it but this time I only had enough time for the machine to bake it.  Unfortunately, machine failed and I was left  with a gooey mess.  My fourth grade twins came home from school and I turned it over to them while I continued tutoring my students.  They hand mixed, kneaded and braided it. Of course daddy handled the oven. The bread turned out great. I've made it again without the machine a few times because we like the size of the loaf and I'm too lazy to find another recipe.
Two changes, we use olive oil instead of butter  and we use soy milk since we are in Asia and my kids don't handle milk well.

I made this bread several times already because it is sooo good.    I followed the instructions exactly, except for using butter in lieu of margarine.  I love the taste whether it is toasted or un-toasted.  This is my "go to" bread recipe when I just want to make bread.  I definitely recommend everyone trying it.

It is awesome, better than my 1st one which just boiled over, it is really stable had to add a little flour during kneading but all in all came out great. Put in on dark setting and it is like oven baked, except next time I would go medium on the crust. Fun and easy recipe.

I followed another reviewers recommendation to use 3 eggs instead of 2 and it turned out wonderful!! It does resemble the texture of Challah bread after it's cooled, so I'm happy! I use to buy fresh Challah bread from the local farmers market, but since moving I can no longer find any. This recipe satisfies my craving.

I followed the exact recipe except I used about 1/4 tsp less yeast and medium crust. It turned out perfect! Just the right amount of sugar...so yummy.  My favorite bread machine recipe so far.

It's the perfect bread.  Many of the other breads I've tried are too crumbly or bland.  This one has a flavor my whole family likes.  We use it plain, with garlic, with sandwiches, whatever.  It's a little sweet, but we like that.  I make it every week now and don't change a thing about the recipe.  I'd definitely recommend it to others.

I really liked the texture of this bread. I made it to the recipe the first time, added garlic & Parmesan the second time. Both turned out yummy, though the second time the leftovers couldn't really be used for French toast! ?? On my bread machine, the crust got a little too brown even on the 'light' setting, so I'm taking it out ten minutes early now.  But this recipe will get lots of use now! I'll try it with some cinnamon next time!

Excellent.  Came out very soft, not too sweet.  I took the suggestion of another review and used the sweet/light crust setting, perfect!  This is definitely going in my "favorites" box

I made this and it came out perfect!! My bread machine instructions state that ingredients should always be at room temperature, so I made sure that the butter and eggs were, and heated the milk just slightly.

After reading reviews I was expecting to have to add an additional egg. My dough was actually too wet and I had to add additional flour! I did as a few other reviewers did and used the bread machine for the mixing/rising process only. I removed the dough from the bread machine, divided it in 3, braided it, let it rise for an hour and then baked it at 350 for approx. 30 minutes. I prefer a softer crust, so I brushed it with melted butter as soon as it came out of the oven. It has a good flavor, but I can't say it tastes like Challah. I'm going to try it again and add a little more sugar or honey.

AMAZING! The best egg bread recipe. I used almond milk and non-dairy butter and I also added an extra egg and  it turns out amazingly good.  My family love it so much, thank you for sharing this recipe.

I've used vegetable oil instead of margarine without changing the rest of the recipe, baked on 1.5 lb setting of my bread machne. It is so good! One more thing, my 3/4 cup of milk from the fridge I've heated up in microwave for 30 sec to bring it to more or less room temperature. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I did what some reviews said and added more milk, but I didn't know how much more milk to add so I added a quarter cup more milk than the recipe called for. I also added three eggs like one review suggested. My dough turned out horribly sticky. I couldn't touch it without getting this sticky gloopy stuff all over my hand. However, when I  dumped it in a baking pan and let it rise, it rose perfectly and when I baked it for thirty-five minutes at 375 degrees it made a crusty, fluffy loaf. I love this recipe, and though it looked like a total disaster at first, it turned out to be wonderfully crispy and soft. Thank you so much! Also beat up one egg and used that to glaze the bread, then sprinkled some poppy seeds on! Tasted delicious!

Made it for the first time following the instructions. Excellent for dinner but unbelievably great for French Toast the next morning. My breakfast guests said it was the best French Toast they had ever had. The texture of the bread made the French Toast. Slice it thick and make your toast.

This is one of those rare "I can't believe I just made something this delicious" recipes. I used the dough setting and then braided it and baked it in the oven, as other reviewers suggested. I've been experimenting with lots of different breads since buying my bread machine about a month ago, but this is the first time I've made challah, and it's by far the best bread I've ever made. Both the texture and taste are perfect, better than anything I've ever had at a bakery. Thanks so much for sharing this incredible recipe!

This recipe turned out great! I read the previous comments and added 2 tablespoons of honey. The sweetness really popped and the bread was soft and moist. I will make this bread again!

My favorite bread recipe. Have a new bread machine, and have tried a few different types of bread. I like sweet egg breads, and this recipe turns out a perfect bread. This time I let the machine bake it, maybe next time I'll braid it myself. This recipe is a great place to start for home made bread! Everyone loves it, and hubby who grew up with challah says it tastes like the bread growing up. Positive reviews all around.

This is now my favourite bread recipe. I adjusted the serving to 16 and then upped the milk to 300mL and the eggs to 3. I proofed the yeast in scalded and cooled milk before starting and made sure everything else was at room temperature. I did not have bread flour so used Canadian all purpose and it still rose beautifully. After the dough cycle completed I braided my bread and let it rise in my oven. To warm the oven slightly I popped in a pan of boiling water which I removed right before I put in the loaf. Then the oven light was left on to provide just enough warmth. After an hour it was massive so I took it out and gave it and egg wash bath while the oven heated to 350.  After baking about 55 minutes it was gorgeous and I was giddy. Everyone at dinner raved about the flavour too.  Wonderful bread!

I made this in my machine on the dough setting. 6 braided it and let it rise an hour. Then I brushed it with egg wash and topped it with pumpkin seeds and baked at 350 for 25 minutes. This. Is. Delicious!!! Love this recipe and bread! YUMMY! So glad it was posted! :)

The first time I made this recipe it came out fine. I'm new to my breadmaker, so it was okay. I used regular white flour. But then I switched to bread flour (robin good) and WOW. It's amazing what a small change can do. I make it almost exactly as the recipe says, except I add the salt to the liquid ingredients. It produces a light, flaky (but not too much), buttery bread, right out of the breadmaker, and my family can't stop eating it!

Great bread. After having baked the same bread several times, I changed the regular flour with "spelt". For you who doesn't know what "spelt" (also called dinkel wheat or hulled wheat) is, I can tell you, that it's an ancient species of wheat from the fifth millenium BC. It's easy to get in supermarkeds and/or health stores! It originates from Europe. Great taste!

I was searching for a recipe like Mom used to make when I came across this one. It was the closest of all the recipes I tried, still not quite there though. Then one snowy afternoon I was out of milk and didn't want to go to the store. So I used the canned milk in the pantry and that was it. The missing ingredient, canned milk. I highly recommend it, gives the bread a slightly different flavor that is really good.

Great easy recipe. Having made it several times the i start with warm milk for a better rise and dough needs to be just a bit on the sticky side for best results.

This recipe is great. The only thing 
I did differently, mixed in the bread machine,
transferred the dough, and placed in a Bread Pan, 
to rise, then bake it in the oven.

I was a little doubtful about this recipe.. but it was yummy! Because my yeast is almost a year expired and doesn't work as well, I used a tablespoon vs 1/2 teaspoons. If you have a problem with your bread rising, use a tablespoon. It was slightly sweet but not overly, with a soft and crumbly crust but the inside was not dense nor crumbly. It cut really well and is a pretty yellow-tinged bread. Very good recipe :) And if it's not totally obvious, MELT the margarine before adding it.

I used the exact ingredients from this recipe (and added 1 C raisins) with the dough setting on my bread machine. Then I followed the instructions for the Challah II recipe- divided dough in half then braided each half and let rise for about 2 hours. I baked it at 350 for about 25 minutes (tented with foil towards the end) and it was the best bread ever. Soft on the inside and crispy on the outside.

Freakin' delicious! I added 1 egg (3 total) and 1/2 cup flour (3-1/2 cups total). Had to add about 2 tablespoons more flour during kneading cycle to get dough to make a nice ball. Great texture, crust and flavor. This will be my every day bread recipe from now on!

I love this recipe. It turns out great every time. If I'm making it as a gift I just do the dough setting with the machine and finish it in the oven. If I change the serving size to 18 I get two decent sized braided loaves (see pic).

It was just "ok". I highly recommend using "Miriam's Not-So-Secret Challah" from this site instead. For that one, I use the brad maker for the dough (selecting the "dough" setting) and then bake braid it and bake it in the oven as stated. It's amazing.

I was so excited about this bread, however when it was all done baking, all I got was a short, dense piece of bread. It didn't have hardly any rise and the middle was very very dense. I don't know if it was an error on my part, most likely the yeast. Needless to say, I was very disappointed but I will try again.

This really was amazing. The crust on it is so flaky and crisp, and the inside is tender, moist and fine. A good challah, especially so for one made in a bread machine!

The first time I made this it was so moist I kept having to throw in more and more flour. Then I realized much later on that I forgot the sugar! No need to worry it still turned out amazing and still had a certain sweetness. I'm making it again today only breaking down the dough in half to make two smaller loaves. What wonderful gifts these will make. Thanks a ton.

Pretty good bread. The kids and I liked it but my husband didn't like it though.  He said it was too sweet.  I will more and likely make again.

The family thought the bread was good, but not great, and gave it 3 and 4 stars. We all agreed that there are other breads that we like much better. I used the bread machine to make the dough. I then braided the bread, let it rise for about an hour and baked at 350 for about 30 minutes. It looked really pretty. I don't think I will be doing this one again, but it was fun to make and a decent bread. Thank you for sharing the recipe, Suzy.

Wonderful!  I mixed it in the bread machine, then braided it, brushed it with egg whites, sprinkled it with poppy seeds and baked it in the over (20-30min at 350). It was the perfect addition to our Easter meal.  I plan on using it to make french toast based on other reviews.

Made in my bread machine and it was delicious, this is a sweeter bread.  Will make many more times.

We loved it. I took one reviewers advice and did 2c white and 1c brown flour and it still turned out wonderful. Next I'm going to try making french toast as some of the other reviewers suggested using this bread. Thanks for the recipe.

Really Yummy! I didn't have bread flour so I used all purpose and it turned out just fine! Make sure to cover the bread promptly otherwise it will dry out! Thanks!

This was some good bread!  I love the flavor, a hint of sweetness without being overpowering.  This bread would make wonderful ham sandwiches.  I didn't have the time to let it rise poperly so it wasn't exactly pretty, but it was delicious.  Next time I'll try and make a pretty loaf.  :)

This is my daughter's favorite bread.  It makes amazing french toast!  Great with honey butter!  I've made it in the bread machine, and also just done the dough, braided it and brushed it with egg wash before baking in the oven.  EXCELLENT!

I made this recipe a year or so ago.  I thought it was just okay.  I found out that it did dry up quickly like another reviewer stated.  Maybe it's the milk or the eggs that do this.  I doubled the recipe, but reduced to eggs to 3.  I will give this another go as I have been asked to make Challah.  I will use 4 eggs and replace some of the milk w/ water.  Let you know how it turns out.
UPDATE:  Everyone enjoyed it.  The Poppyseeds were a nice touch.

I am used to REALLY GOOD Challah bread that I used to buy from a local bakery.  The bakery closed, so I tried this quick variation.  I didn't expect it to be as great, but it was just ehhhhh.  Somewhat reminded me of corn bread.  However, I'm probably just spoiled with the Challah I used to buy.

My family didn't think it was anything special.  It over browned on my basic setting.  I would have to use a shorter setting if I ever made it again.

I made this bread dough into rolls and found them to be too dense/packy and a bit too sweet. For some reason they didn't seem to rise like most do. I won't be using this recipe again.

I don't know if I have an appreciation for challah like others do.  It's heavier than other breads.  It was good, however.  I liked the top crust, it was flaky around the edges and it had a nice golden color.

I have made this bread twice and although it is very good it is not the best I have ever tasted.  Both times it came out a little dry.  Perhaps next time I will make the dough in the machine, pound it out, braid it and then let it rise and bake in my oven like others below have suggested.

This is the best homemade bread I have ever made.  Crispy crust, but soft and moist inside.  I added 3/4 cup raisin and it turned out very delicious.

I used butter, not margarine. Great for toast and French bread. The toast is so good, it doesn't require a topping. Made it last night and now it's gone.

My 7 year old daughter wanted to make some bread in our new breadmachine.
So I let her pick one of the recipes, she picked this one. I supervised her
 closely, of course, but she made our first loaf. It was fantastic the kids, my wife
and I all loved it. It is moist and sweet and delicious. My children are allergic to
milk and eggs, so we substituted rice milk and an egg replacement product. The
bread did not suffer for it.

Suzi's Challah Bread is really delicious!  My bread machine only holds 2 cups of flour.  I set it on dough setting.  After removing,let it rise until doubled. Punch down and divide into 3 ropes. Braid and brush with egg yolk.Sprinkle with sesame seeds. Bake.   Really worth the effort. Thanks, Retiree

I have made many loaves of bread with my machine and this is by far my favorite.  It has a slightly sweeter taste that is irresistible when toasted. Excellent recipe.

this was the first time a made a bread in my machine without a boxed mix.  Wow!  This is so much better. I instructions were perfect, I only changed one thing, I used butter instead of margarine.

I made this bread this morning and it is wonderful!
This is by far the best loaf of bread I've made - light, airy, good flavor.
I used the suggested "light" setting and the crust was crunchy.
