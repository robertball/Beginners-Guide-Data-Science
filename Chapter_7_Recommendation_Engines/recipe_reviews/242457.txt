So simple why change anything?  These were as good as they sounded and looked like the picture without the garnish.  I only made two and used an 8 x 8 dish to hold the ramekins.  I think I needed 3  1/2 cups of hot water.  I sprayed the ramekins and 20 minutes baking produced my ideal eggs, the whites were just done, the yolk had started to film over and was still runny.  The pasta sauce had thickened a little which was good too.  Not sure if mine were compliant served over orzo but they were delicious.  Thanks!

Can it get any easier than this?! So, so good, of course depending on the quality of sauce you use (I used Mezzetta Napa Valley Homestyle Marinara). I love that you can stick these in the oven, and not worry about them while you prepare other foods. The only suggestion I have is to spray the inside of the ramekins with cooking spray as the sides of the egg tends to stick. Thanks for the great recipe SheLovesPaleo!

You can use coconut milk in place of the cream!
