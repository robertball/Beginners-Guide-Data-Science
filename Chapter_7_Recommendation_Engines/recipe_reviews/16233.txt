This is going to be a staple for weeknights in my house.  The ingredients were all in the house, and I could get rid of leftover mashed potatoes.  The kids really loved this, and to think I was worried about the different ingredients tasting bad?  Oh and it took me all of a half hour to make.

This recipe was okay.  I personally found it a little too sweet, but my daughter loved it.  I only made half a recipe so I used Cream of Mushroom soup only.  I also didn't have any curry so I left that out.  It got a little too thick, so I just thinned it out with some milk.  I probably won't make again.

This was pretty easy - I made it all in one sautee pan. It's very seasoned.

Delicious, and easy to make. My husband hates mushrooms, so used crm of chix soup, instead of the mushroom soup, & skipped the canned mushrooms. Didn't have any currry powder, so left that out also. I thought it was still pretty thick, so went ahead & added the one cup of water, but NO cornstarch. I wasn't sure what kind of steak sauce to use, but we had A1, so that's what went in the recipe.  Served over mashed potatoes.

Horrific! Every bit of it went in the garbage, save the sample I tasted and gagged on! I am a lover of foods of all kinds, rarely picky but this was BAD!  I am a lover of hamburger helper and its generic brothers&sisters and Davy's Gravy is nothing like it! Don't make this, b/c its a waist of your ingredients, which I doubt "davy" is going to reimburse me for.  Ew! "chaos is the pot" is more like it.

I substituted cheddar cheese soup for the mushroom soup and left out the curry.  My husband and I loved it, and so did my 2 year old daughter.  I served it over rice and spent less than 30 minutes preparing it from beginning to end.  This recipe will definitely go into rotation!

Had already had potatoes, rice and noodles on my weekly menu, but had a box of cornbread stuffing mix in the pantry.  Went over very well.  Served with a side of cranberry sauce!

This was a great start for me. I have turned it into something a bit closer to stroganoff with some sour cream instead of cream of celery, and pumped up the worcestershire. Thanks for the idea!

My dh and I both thought this was only OK. It reminded me of a kicked-up version of hamburger helper, but way better. It worked good in a pinch, but I don't think I will make it again.

I loved this simple and tasty recipe. I used everything the recipe called for. The result was very flavorful. I like to freeze things for my husband to take to work for lunch. This froze well and hubby said it tasted even better the second time around.

This was SO yummy!!!  I substituted Cheddar Cheese for the Cream of Celery, omitted the curry & cayenne, served it over rice.  I didn't need to add the water & cornstarch.  This will definitely be a 'regular' in our menu -- my family LOVED IT!

Made a decent gravy, I'll do it next time without the steak sauce.  I'm not a big fan to begin with.  I didn't have any cider vinegar, so I left that out as well.  It made a decent meal with egg noodles and I will make it again, just modified to my families taste.

Sorry but I didn't really like it though the kids seemed to think it was ok.  It was much to bland for my liking.

I really loved this recipe.  It is really very simple to make and tastes awesome over mashed potatoes!  I have made this recipe a lot, and I enjoy it every single time.  Although, I don't add the cornstarch mixture at the end, becuase it doesn't even seem necessary.

I have had this recipe on hand for over a year and knew that it would be a good one for my family.  I also knew that it would probably be better if the dish was cooked and then sat all day before reheating for supper.  I think that is what worked, because although it is one of the most unpleasant looking dishes you'll ever make, it tastes great!  I used the ingredients given, but increased the flavorings a little because I had a bit over 1 1/2 lbs of ground beef.  I did not need the corn starch.  Even my four picky children loved it.

Easy enough, maybe reduce the amount of steak sauce as it seemed to overpower the flavor, my kids didnt like it at all, it was overall ok, but I wont make it again.  Strangely enough it did taste somewhat better the next day.  Kids still didnt like it.

This is FANTASTIC!!! If your family is like mine, and likes highly seasoned, flavorful food, this will be a hit. The only changes I made (and it turned out perfect!) were using 1 1/2 lbs. beef, and TWO cans cream o' mushroom with the cream o' celery. Served over a 1 lb.  of steaming, wide egg noodles, this blows away stroganoff! Thanks for the keeper, Dave.:)

This is a FANTASTIC recipe.  It's even better the next day, if you can keep any that long.  I made a few adjustments to suit my taste.  I added 1/4 cup of Madeira wine and used 1 clove of fresh garlic instead of powder added while the meat and onions were cooking.  I din't have cream of celery soup so I omitted it.  I used a 16 oz. ready to eat cream of mushroom.  It still came out great. This is a definite keeper!!

Both my husband and I enjoyed this very much even though I didn't have all the ingredients on hand.  Its a quick and easy meal idea.  And the combination of all the ingredients is perfect to make it a very tasty dish.  And it's great the next day too.  Will add this to my recipe book.

I made this for my husband, who is very picky about 'gravies'...he loved it!! So did I...this tastes like there is white wine in it, although there's none in it...this is something I could serve to friends and not worry...

We loved this mushroom gravy.  I made a few changes.  First I used 8oz. of fresh mushrooms that I sauteed in 3 Tblsp. of butter.  Then I added all the ingredients, minus the beef and onion.  I didn't have cider vinegar or lemon juice so I used 1 Tblsp. of red wine vinegar.  Then finished the recipe as per the instructions.  It was an amazing and tangy mushroom gravy.  Yummy.
