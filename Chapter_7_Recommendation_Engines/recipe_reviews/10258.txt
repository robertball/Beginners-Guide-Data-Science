Tasty cookies. A tip for those with flat cookies: refrigerate your dough until thoroughly cold prior to baking. If your dough is room temperature (and it probably is since there are few cold ingredients), the cookies will start to spread out even before they begin to cook. Cold dough prevents this, leaving you with thicker, more "normal" looking cookies.

This is one of the best homemade cookie recipies I have ever tried!  They turned out perfectly and were a big hit at my house.  I used butter Crisco instead of regular shortening.

These were sooo good, my hubby couldn't stop eating them.  I made a mistake, and added all the M&M's at once, but they still came out fine.  I used the green & red M&M's for Christmas.

As most chocolate cookies are, this is a slight variation of “Original NESTLÉ® TOLL HOUSE® Chocolate Chip Cookies.”   I like the use of shortening rather than all butter in this recipe for the sturdiness it imparts, but wanting the best of both worlds, I used half of each.  Going into this I knew this would be a moister, softer cookie, just by virtue of the fact that there is a higher ratio of brown sugar to white sugar.  Because I like my cookies crunchier, I knew this would not be MY favorite, but I know this texture appeals to most – and that’s what it delivered. These are indeed soft and tender, but chewy at the same time.   I had mini M & M’s in the pantry, so I correspondingly made the cookies smaller too.  As I do with all my cookies containing butter, I chilled the dough for about an hour before I baked them.   These cheery two-bite cuties will be well-liked at Hubs’ meeting tomorrow morning.

These cookies were loved by kids and adults in my family.  I used some semi-sweet chocolate as well since I did not have a full 2 1/2 of M&Ms.  I used mini-M&Ms instead of bits.

I used half shortening, half salted butter. I made no other changes. I actually baked mine at 350* for eleven minutes--the reason for the longer cooking time was because I really packed my small cookie scoop to make bigger sized cookies which meant they needed a touch longer bake time. They turned out soft, chewy and were loved by my husband and two kids. Next time, I will try this with Reese's pieces and maybe half peanut butter in place of some of the shortening.

My family LOVED these, they couldn't stop eating them!    Next time I'll be doubling the recipe.  I used M&M mini baking bites, they worked perfect.  I wouldn't change a thing, and I highly recommend these.  They are very simple to prepare.  Thanks Sandra for sharing!

These were just ok. My family did not like them, and I made them for a Boy Scout function and it did not seem as though they went over as well as I wished that they would have. No one asked me for the recipe or anything. This is something that I probably would not make again. They were colorful though!! I will give you that, along with 3 stars!!!

I love these cookies,very soft and tasty, although I mistakenly added the whole 1.5 cups of M&Ms to the mix, and then put 2 or 3 more M&Ms on top of dropped cookies before baking.  The dough was a little dry, so I added 1-2 T of milk. We've eaten so many since we made them that I have to make more to share for Christmas!

Great Cookies! I made a couple of changes to the recipe to suit my own personal taste.  I added half a cup of chopped pecans pieces and I used BIG M&M's and Mini M&M's and I mixed them all up in the cookie dough.  They turned out fantastic.  Thanks for the great recipe.  I will make many more times I am sure.

I made these fantastic cookies for my friend's going away party.  They shouldn't be cooked very long, so that they are chewy.  Like another reviewer said, they were better the next day.

These are excellent! Simple to make & taste great! I used 1 cup of M&M's in the cookie dough, reserving only 1/2 cup to put on top. It was plenty. I take cookies out of the oven right before they start to brown, because they will continue to cook while they cool. It keeps the cookies chewy, yum!

I was looking for a M&M cookie that baked up nice and thick, these didnt get as thick as I wanted but the receipe is very good! I baked them a little bit longer because I used a baking stone and I used regular crisco but next time I may try butter flavored crisco.

Thanks for sharing this recipe!!!  I use this recipe a lot of different ways as a basic cookie recipe.  I've used chocolate chips instead of M&Ms, and nuts instead of M&Ms.  I've also made them plain and have always gotten great praise for them.  I always double the recipe (except the salt) and get over 8 dozen regular sized cookies!  Yummy.

I use this site a lot, and have always been able to trus the reviews. This recipee, however, was a huge disappointment. I followed the recipe exactly and wound up with crispy, flat, greasy cookies that were way to salty. Ick. What a waste.

I have never rated a recipe before, but this one is great.  My hubbie is a HUGE Chocolate Chip Cookie lover, and says this is the best one he has ever had.  I use a regular package of semi-sweet chocolate chips in this recipe instead of the M&M's and they turn out great.  I bake them for 9 minutes in a 375 oven, and use butter flavored Crisco as the shortening.  It is now my standard recipe.  Thank you Sandra!

This was very easy and the cookies turned out nice and soft! I even dumped in the whole 1-1/2C of M&M's by mistake and they turned out great! Will make again!

These were so good and easy to make! I made these for my daughters class birthday and she came home with 2 cookies out of the entire batch. I followed the recipe exactly and they came out amazing!! I did put the dough in the refrigerator for a half hour before baking. My cooking time was only 8 minutes instead of 10. A must make again. Thank you for such a great recipe.

We thought these cookies were very delicious. I used half crisco shortening and half butter and put the batter into the freezer to stiffen them up a bit, it keeps them from spreading to much. They were very soft and they will not last long.  I also mixed in most of the m&m and then put a few on top of each cookie so you can see them.

Delicious flavor!  I doubled the recipe and used all butter.  It made about 50 nice big cookies and they went over great at a school function.  These weren't particularly good warm but they were wonderful the next day.  Will certainly make again!  My husband who doesn't like cookies really loved these!

For the record I did use all shortening and no butter but did add a bit of butter flavoring.  I love the texture shortening gives to cookies.  They were best the first day.

I thought these were great.  I used butter instead of shortening because I avoid shortening.  However, shortening makes for prettier, thicker cookies.  Butter makes them spread out.  The flavor was wonderful, mine needed to bake a little longer  - maybe 15 minutes or the middle wasn't done.  I think you could use even more "candy coated chocolate pieces".  Oh, I would also make them smaller, so that they made more than 12 cookies, but that's personal preference.

I bake many cookies and I loved these. A perfect cookie is one thats slightly crisp on the end of a cookie and soft every where else. This cookie fit that criteria very well. Excellant texture and not to sweet.Loved them!!!!!!!!

I'll admit I was a little leary of using all shortening and I almost substituted butter,but I'm SO glad I DIDN'T!  I followed the recipe exactly (well, I probably baked them a little less than what the recipe calls for) and these cookies were incredible!!!!They were slightly crispy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside -- yummy!!!!  They were picture-perfect -- flattened out slightly but not too much -- just right! Plus, they were so simple and quick to make with ingredients I always have on hand.  Hubby and children said they were the best cookies they've ever had -- and that's a real compliment.  Everyone in my family bakes alot -- most everything from scratch.  This will definitely be a recipe I make time and time again.  Thanks for sharing!!!!

The only thing I did differently was use 1/2 a stick of butter, softened, and 1/2 c. butter flavored shortening.  (I didn't want to use all shortening because I've used a chocolate chip recipe from this site that is delish, but the cookies don't keep very well because of the shortening I think).  I didn't measure the M&Ms, just eyeballed it, and I used almost a whole bag of chocolate chips.  I used Valentine's M&Ms and took the cookies to work.  The pink, red, and white M&Ms were cute.  Everyone loved the cookies and they didn't last very long at all.  I'm glad I took them to work because I would have eaten every single one of them by myself if I'd left them at home.

These were good. I used butter flavored shortening and added all of the m&ms's called for to the batter. I baked mine for 10 min and that was perfect, as I like my cookies soft.

Love this recipe! I had to adjust it for high altitude. I found that lowering the temp to 350 degres made quite the difference. I brought 2 dozen of these to work and 5 people managed to eat all of them in a matter of hours.

This is the recipe to try for M&M cookies.  They turned out even better than I expected.  I used butter flavored crisco and beat the shortening and sugar together for about 5 minutes before adding the eggs and vanilla.  They turned out divine!

These were very good, and the grandkids loved them.  I used margarine, and cut back a tablespoon, but they still spread a little more than I would have liked.  Next time, I'll use butter-flavored Crisco, and I'm sure they'll be perfect.  I just didn't have enough on hand this time.  They were done in 10 minutes, and gobbled up in no time.

I had a lot of problems with this recipe.  The batter was very runny, the cookies came out very flat, and I had a terrible time trying to get them off the pan.  Maybe I did something wrong but they didn't turn out how I expected.

Hey Mikey, we like it!

Well, the third batch anyway.  :)  My fault for under-cooking the first and over-cooking the second.  They really are very good!  Important to note that you can't use a beater at the end of it, you'll need your hands.  But like the Oracle said, "Cookies need love like everything does!"

I substituted butter for the shortening and since this was my first time making this recipe, I didn't bake them for as long as indicated. They were done and a bit darker then I wanted after only baking for 8 minutes. They were very flat and, although they tasted good, they didn't have much eye appeal. So the next day I tweaked the recipe and added 1/2 cup more of flour so I could roll them into balls, which I then slightly flattened out (original recipe the dough is very sticky). I then topped each cookie with 4 M & M's and baked them for 8 minutes, lowering the temp to 350 degrees (instead of 375). They turned out perfect! They weren't flat, were a lovely golden brown and had the eye appeal I was looking for! The dough is very tasty and after I changed the recipe a bit, I'm very happy with the result!

These turned out fantastic! Followed recipe exactly as written, with the exception of using mini M&M's instead of regular size it's all I had, and needless to say, they were amazing! Cooked the full 11 minutes and they harden as they cooled. So don't over bake! Definitely a keeper.

The dough was runny and difficult to handle. I added 1/4 of flour to the dough. The cookies were ok with no good consistency.

One of the best homemade cookies I have tried! I was out of butter so I was happy to find this one. I would have thought butter would be better but NO WAY. The only thing I would change is the salt. They were like sweet and salty cookies. I have cut it in half every time I have made them now. thanks!!!!

I made these yesterday since we had friends coming over. Everyone loved them, especially me! I only made one change. I used butter instead of shortening. I also added a couple of extra M&M's to the top of each cookie before baking!

I used butter crisco like one reviewer suggested, and they were good, but next time I think I'll use just butter instead.  I also put the dough in the refrigerator for quite a while and they still baked flat. Maybe I mixed it too long with the mixer. I'll have to try again.

Really really good. I was wary about the shortening also because I like the flavor of butter better, but the shortening works just great. I made about 18 really big ones. Thanks for the recipe!

My husband came home from work and discovered that I had made these cookies and proceeded to eat 12 throughout the night (I take it he loved them!). I only had to cook these cookies for 8 minutes and I used to mini cooking M&M's and just mixed them all in the dough since I didn't want to deal with placing all those little things on the tops.

Very good cookies.  You really have to use the shortening to make them come out right. As other members have previously mentioned, it's best to refrigerate dough before baking.  My cookies came out thick, crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside just like we like them.  This is a keeper!

I made these for my niece's b-day party.  I made a double batch using 1 1/2 cups of shortening and 1/2 cup butter for flavor.  It made a LOT of cookies using my Pampered Chef small cookie scoop.  I thought they were very good (as did the little ones!).  In general I prefer my cookies a little more buttery, so next time I make a single batch I may use half shortening, half butter.  I will definitely make again around the holidays with the festive M&M's.

These cookies are absolutely delish! I'm gonna have to bake cookies more often lol. But I made a few changes to the recipe. I used half shortening, half butter and I also put in chocolate chips and chopped up a Nutrageous bar in the batter cause I was short on M&M's. The only thing I didn't expect was how much they seemed to spread . I think the 2nd batch spread more than the first. I chilled the 2nd batch though. I'm not sure if that happened because I used butter but overall it's fantastic, definitely 5 stars!
EDIT - The stayed really fresh even without being placed in an airtight container, just wonderful!:)

This is a great recipe! They do tend to spread out quite a bit so I took them out a little early to cool on the pan. They were soft and chewy!

I love this recipe.  I followed the directions almost exactly.  The only change I made was I used 1 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of M & M's in the batter, but then I put peanut butter M & M's on top of the cookies after placing them on the cookie sheets.  The cookies were big and thick not at all thin like some other reviewers have mentioned.  I will definitely use this recipe again and again.  Note: The recipe says it makes 2 dozen.  I would say closer to 4 dozen and I made them big.

Better than your favorite bakery cookie!  I added 1 cup M & M's to the dough and saved only a 1/2 cup to sprinkle on top before baking.

These have become a favorite at Christmas and I always use the red and green M&Ms.
