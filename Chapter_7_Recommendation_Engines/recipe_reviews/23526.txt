This mix is close to awful.  It really tastes like it is missing something.  Like it should be mixed with milk instead.  Takes a lot of doctoring.  If you give this mix in jars as gifts to your friends for X-mas, expect less X-mas cards and gifts next year.

It's a good recipe if you add 2 to 3 TABLESPOONS of mix to the water, not teaspoons.  And I'm going to add cinnamon to the mix, for a twist.

This was not very good, watery and flavorless. I wouldn't recommend making a full sized batch until you have tasted it

I think this is really good. I make sure I use at least 3 heaping tablespoons. I may have added more cocoa when I made it because I love chocolate. Great basic recipe. I've make it with both water and with milk and it's good either way.

With seven children, we always make things in bulk.  This will be a keeper.  I made a triple batch, just to get us started for the winter.  The kids drink it in the mornings, everyday.  Thanks.

I do not mean to complain and maybe I did something wrong, but this recipe did not turn out like I thought. It tastes like something is missing, too watered down. Maybe someone can tell me what I did wrong? I tried both granulated white sugar and white powdered sugar, same weak taste.

Easy and delicious.  A little more creamer makes it even better.  For a little twist, I added 1 cup of raspberry custard mix for "raspberry hot cocoa."  Yum!  This is the second year I've made this recipe and will continue doing so.  Thanks so much for posting it.

I know that other reviewers reported a watery taste, but I loved this recipe and I really can't imagine how people got a watery taste from it. I thought it was creamy and rich-tasting. I used 1/2 cup of regular creamer and 1/2 cup vanilla creamer instead of 1 cup of regular creamer. I thought it had a very nice cocoa-y taste as opposed to some storebought oversugary hot chocolates. Very very good.

This recipie was bad.  I ended up going to 3 cups Sugar, 1 c creamer, 1 c dry milk and 1 1/2 c Cocoa.  Also make with milk.  And this way its not that bad.  Otherwise it is way too watery and taste like Coffee.

I loved this recipe.  I didn't level off the measuring cups, so I probably added a little more of all the ingredients.  I know all my grands will love it.

Perhaps the best hot chocolate I ever had! I accidentally put in a cup of cocoa instead of 3/4 of a cup so I added an additional 1/2 cup of sugar also. For 8 oz. of hot water I put in 3 heaping Tbsp. of the mix. Thanks for this recipe! It fits perfectly in my old Swiss Miss can.

I have tried several homemade cocoa mixes and this is my favorite! I have tried it with splenda too and it is still great. I use 3 heaping spoonfuls because I like my cocoa more chocolatey and sweet. As a gift I am giving a jar of cocoa mix and a bottle of flavored syrup like those use for italian soda. Caramel, vanilla, irish creme, and almond roca are all good flavors that go great in cocoa.

Great recipe. Use Ghiradelli's dark cocoa instead of regular cocoa for the chocolate lovers in your family.

This mix could use a little more creamer for body but otherwise it is quite good and super easy to make. It yielded enough to fill an empty 26 oz Swiss Miss container.  I used 3T in hot water and sprinkled it with a little cinnamon for fun. Yum!

This recipe lacked "umph." I had to put in my mug double the amount of mix called for. It wasn't very creamy, tasted pretty watery.

My family loves this recipe.  Although I have changed it a bit.  I use special dark cocoa powder,dutch processed.  And I don't add the non-dairy creamer.  I use milk to make the hot chocolate instead.  Turns out great!

This was good but I needed to use A LOT more mix to make it creamy. I also used French vanilla creamer instead of plain and that made a difference.

I mainly like this recipe because it is one of the only Hot Chocolate recipes that doesn't contain confectioners sugar or Nestle Quik.  I really do not like the taste of confectioners sugar when it is mixed with hot water and would rather not have my kids drinking the Quik too often.  I agree with some other reviewers that if your hot chocolate tastes watery it needs more mix.  When I make hot cocoa for my kids I add about 3-4Tbl mix/cup and boiling water--mix it well--and then cool it down by adding some cold milk.  It is creamy and delicious.  The kids even make it themselves with the hot water from the water dispenser and milk.  This recipe must be put through either  blender/foodprocessor/coffee grinder.
Thanks for this easy recipe!

I make a double batch of this every winter.  I use a little extra dry milk and it is great.  I also use half Splenda and half sugar.

A great, simple recipe.  I used vanilla creamer Instead of plain coffee creamer and then when serving it,  used 3 tablespoons per serving and  filled the cups half with hot water, the rest with cold milk, since it was made for my kiddos.  The result is a quick tastey (and affordable) instant hot chocolate!  Thanks for the treat!  The children are pleased and so am I!

AWESOME!  I made some for my kiddos, and hey want a cup of it every evening before bed.  I also made some with Splenda (I am a diabetic) and it was just as good.  It is one of those things that makes you feel good.  LOL

This mix is not flavorful at all. It tastes like chocolate water...not good at all. To make it taste better,I add to milk...not water.

3.17.14 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/23526/hot-chocolate-mix-i/ ... AR  deleted my review.  Note4Me:  Compare to Beverly's mix: 2c sugar, 2c dry milk, 2c (hazelnut) creamer, 1c cocoa.  compare with regular creamer.
This one: 1 1/2c sugar, 1c creamer & dry milk, 3/4c cocoa
My version of this one: 2c sugar, 1c each: dry milk, creamer & cocoa
My version of this won.Gonna try it with hazelnut. Ok, ok, it may be a little too much cocoa or just need to be blended.Tastes kind of powdery.  Hazelnut version,hazelnut flavor was too slight. OCT2013 Try w 3T sugar & 2T cocoa, creamer&milk. 1.5c sug in full

The recipe was a good start but had to be altered to get a good result. I increased the chocolate, added cocoa,cinnamon and 1/8 cup of instant coffee. 3-4 tbsp heaping per cup and it was good.

Good starting point. I used Splenda, 1/2c. cocoa, and 1/4c. dark cocoa, and only had Vanilla Cream creamer, so it was VERY sweet. I added another 1/4c. dark cocoa, and it was perfect. :)

This is absolutely wonderful hot chocolate! Definitely 5 stars! I used 1 cup of c.sugar and slightly less than 1/2 cup white sugar. Other than that, I didn't change anything. For the people who said it was too watery, maybe they just didn't put enough mix in.

This is a nice, chocolatey cocoa mix that isn't too sweet.  I usually add a few drops of vanilla extract when making a mug.  The food processor step isn't mandatory, but it really helps blend the mix.  Hand mixing is fine, but tricky since the milk powder granules are much larger than the cocoa powder.

Really good, especially when mixed with half-regular creamer and half-flavoured (French vanilla or hazelnut are great!). I usually make it with about 3/4 hot water and then top it off with some milk. Oh, and it's really good mixed into hot or cold coffee, for a bit of a mocha treat! Yum: lukewarm coffee, hot chocolate mix, ice, blend until slushy. Thanks for sharing, Ann!

This was decent for hot chocolate mix. Using the blender for it was really a pain, though. I think next time I'll just use powdered sugar to start with. The kids liked it, esp. with whipped topping on top. You really have to use your taste as a guide to how much to use in each cup.

Awesome mix.  Very creamy and smooth.  I used 1/2 C powdered sugar in place of granulated (just because I was low on sugar) and added some chocolate shavings.  Very yummy.

This is awesome hot chocolate.  I added an extra 1/2 cup of Special Dark Cocoa to the 3/4 of regular Hershey's Cocoa as recommended to make it extra dark.

I used this recipe with just the cocoa and sugar. I like heating whole milk and adding the chocolate mixture. Tasted great but a little too sweet for my taste. Will cut back to 1 1/4 cup sugar next time.

I thought I would make this despite the negative reviews. I was wrong. I thought I could avoid the watery taste by using whole milk power instead of non fat power. I messed around with this recipe quite a lot and still could not make it better. I had a whole house full of testers. Bottom line is, you HAVE to make this with milk. If you use water, you're out of luck. Use this recipe with 1 cup of hot milk and add 3 heaping tablespoons of mix and you're all good. Other recipes call for powdered sugar. In my opinion it's not any better between powdered vs regular sugar. But other recipes on this site for instant chocolate milk mix.  I think this defeats the point of making it yourself. Also the dark chocolate vs Hersheys is preferable.  Again, you can mess with this recipe all you want but it will not taste good without using milk instead of water period.

tastes great! a little too much coco flavor for my taste..I like super sweet hot coco. I added 1/2 cup powdered sugar to this and it was perfect! I've tried other recipies and they use only dry milk so they have a weird milky smell and taste. this recipe eliminated that completely. love ?

This is ok. I think I will add more sugar(I used powdered) and more cocao because it just isn't very chocolately. And was kind of watery (I will try using milk for the rest instead of water)We will use it so we don't waste ingredients but I will keep looking for a better recipe.

Delightful - My children loved it.  We used chopped up chocolaed morsels insead of grated chocolate.
