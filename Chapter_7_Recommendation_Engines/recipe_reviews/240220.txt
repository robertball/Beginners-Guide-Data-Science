Added about 1 Tbsp of worcestershire sauce to the soup mix because it tased bland and what a difference. Gave it a little zip which is all it needed. Had my parents and nephew over for dinner and we all loved it. Can easily prepare ahead of time and bake just before serving.

I have been making this(with a few changes) and sharing the recipe for years! However, I use chicken thighs, place them in greased or buttered 9x13 casserole dish;  pour over mushroom or chicken soup, undiluted on the thighs, sprinkle with stuffing mix, pour over gently with water, chicken broth, or my favorite, 1/2 wine and 1/2 water. Cover and bake! Voila! Everyone's favorite and so-o-o easy!

This was delicious. I was shocked when my boyfriends son picked up the spoon for a second helping. I Made the stuffing with chicken broth instead of water. With adding salt it was a tad salty but still good. Next time I will omit the salt and use low sodium broth. I got a little concerned because it was browning but never bubbled. Took it out after an hour and twenty minutes. Definitely will make this again. Looked beautiful!!

My husband and I thought this was great.  I halved the recipe for us, so instead of 1/2 and 1/4 cans of soup, I just used a whole can of cream of mushroom only.  I also added 2 cloves of minced garlic to the onion and celery.  I think it would be a good idea to add carrots and green beans to the recipe, and I'm going to try that next time.  Really good comfort food recipe!

This was really quite good!  I made it as written.  My husband and I made pigs of ourselves... :O  I think an addition of a veggie like small cut broccoli and/or cauliflower.... Or a sprinkle of frozen corn, peas or carrots nestled in with the chicken wouldn't hurt this dish at all.  Thank you for posting!!

it's official. husband and daughter love it! I did as well. I made it per the recipe except I used one of the reviewers tips and added worschershire to the soup mix and I added grated cheddar cheese on the top before baking. I also don't care for cream of mushroom and couldn't find a good replacement so I used a can of cheddar cheese soup. picture uploaded. will be making again and experimenting with different tweaks just because it's what I do to elevate the flavor a bit

Too much soup, way too salty.  Made exactly as shown but omitted the salt since almost every review said it was too salty.  Was looking for a casserole to serve visitors over Christmas week. So happy I tried it first.  Ick.

my husband thought it was a winner! I will definitely be making this recipe again. Adding the two cans of cream of is deceptive. I thought the dish would be bland but as another reviewer stated she added a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce, and I added some garlic powder and frozen vegetables and it took the dish over the top! Thanks for the great recipe.

I made this last night and it is so delicious!! I did 2 boxes of the stuffing (used low sodium Chicken Stove Top), omitted the celery and onions (husband doesn't like them), as well as the additional salt.  I substituted a can of sweet peas for the celery and onions.  Went to the grocery store and they were out of rotisserie chicken, so I bought two packs of the already prepared chicken in the packs (i.e. Purdue, etc.).  I shredded that up further and layered the dish as given in the recipe.  We opened a can of cranberry sauce, and 1/2 of the pan was devoured!!! Its so good and worth trying! I wasn't sure how it would come out, but it worked for us! It was like Thanksgiving all over again :)

Will definitely make again. The crunch and flavor of the celery really makes this dish. Everyone loved it. Only thing I did different was to add some garlic. Garlic makes everything taste better.

This was excellent! I noticed everyone commented on high salt so I used low sodium soups. I also added 2 cans of potatoes since my family love potatoes. I also added carrots and cranberries to the stuffing. Excellent easy recipe that will be made again

I love Stove Top so this recipe was great! I did use two boxes of stuffing and full cans of the soup. I did not add any sour cream. I will add some peas and maybe some other veggies next time. Very good! Glad to have a new recipe to use my rotisserie chicken!

This was VERY good.  I followed some comments - two packs of Stove Top Chicken Stuffing, low sodium chicken broth (College Inn) to boil for stuffing plus a cup or more of water so stuffing was moist, three chicken breasts cut up, only two celery, NO salt.  I did forget to put a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce in but I am not kidding three people ate it and thought it was great.  BTW, I used store brand sour creme and cream of chicken and cream of mushroom (1/2) soup.

Really, really enjoyed this. I used my own fresh chicken breasts, added corn and green beans and also sprinkled a little sharp cheddar on the top. I'm not a fan of cream of mushroom so I used cream of chicken and cream of celery. I boiled my chicken in water and chicken broth, this gave the chicken a great taste .  My husband and I both enjoyed it and I would make this again

This is great if you just want something that's just plain ol' comfort food. Excellent as written.  I haven't found anyone yet that doesn't love it.  I do use 2 regular boxes of Stove Top Stuffing when making a 13 x 9 batch because we love the stuffing part.  I also just throw in the whole can of cream of mushroom soup -- I can't stand wasting 1/2 a can of soup.  I've used all cream of chicken soup, all cream of mushroom soup, 1 can of cream of celery with either a can of cream of mushroom or cream of chicken soup.  I've also subbed plain yogurt for the sour cream.  All these combinations work.  Recipe is very adaptable for experienced  cooks..

I made this for dinner the other day.  It was very tastey and quick. For the most part. .. I followed the recipe to a T.  I did season along every step of the way.  I added onion powder and garlic powder when I mixed the cream of mushroom, cream of chicken and sour cream.  I also added a layer of homemade mashed potatoes in between the onion mixture and stuffing. served with savory beef gravy.  we all went back for seconds.  was very good. simple. and besides the rotisserie chicken .. I already had everything in my pantry. gota love a quick last minute meal.  will def make again.

An easy win. I halved the recipe because I had half a rotisserie chicken, half an onion, and a can of cr. Chicken soup to use up. Used a whole can of soup (instead of 3/4) and only 2 Tbsp. Sour cream. Like others I doubled the stuffing, so for half a recipe I used the whole box of stuffing. Don’t think half would have been enough.

Very good but I added grated cheddar cheese and sage.  I added onion and celery to stove top dressing. Mixed chicken with ingredients except dressing.  Placed on bottom of Pyrex with dressing on top.
So yummy.

I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this!  I made it exactly as written EXCEPT i added a layer of frozen corn and I didn't add any salt.  It actually didn't need it.  The only thing I am changing for the next time is using 2 boxes of stuffing instead of the one.  I may also try chicken broth in exchange of the water.  I served with mashed potatoes and cranberry sauce.  It was delish!

My family of 4 "licked the platter clean"!   No leftovers here….my teen boys went back for thirds!   Hubby and I liked it made according to the directions.   I did not add salt.  One boy added garlic salt to his servings.  The other added garlic salt and cayenne pepper.  They both like their food saltier than I like  and one likes his food spicy hot!     I definitely will make this again.

Tastes like thanksgiving! We really enjoyed the flavor, though next time I might increase the chicken and stuffing, decrease the soupy creamy part. also may add a vegetable and serve with Grand's flaky biscuits. Thankfully I did use low sodium soups and didn't add much salt. otherwise a good recipe worth revisiting.

Seriously delish! Yum yum. Only change was to add frozen mixed veggies. Hubby says I can make this any time! Great way to use leftover rotisserie chicken.

Pretty good. Everyone liked it. I used 4 regular sized chicken breasts and garlic instead of celery. I mixed everything together and then topped with stuffing. Will make again.
If it's too soupy like some have said, you need more chicken. Or add vegetables to make up for it.

I messed up and didn't account for the rotisserie chicken already having salt! Next time will use low sodium soups, won't salt the carrots and green beans I added, or add any extra salt what so ever! Cuz even the stuffing has added salt as well, my bad. Also, I think a bit more crunch would be nice...need to cook the onions, celery and veggies less, plus thinking of adding some water chestnuts! I used a 5 quart Pyrex, so doubled the recipe. My stuffing on top was too dry so will probably add it at last 15 minutes of oven time!

I can see why there is no photo of this recipe.  It does not look very appetizing.  In fact that were my husbands exact words when I placed the dish on the table.  But, my family loved the taste.  There were no leftovers.

Made this for a holiday potluck luncheon today. It was well liked! The small amount leftover became dinner for my spouse. He really enjoyed it! I chose to use chicken broth instead of water since I used a traditional dry cubed stuffing mix in the box vs the stovetop box mix. I also added a teaspoon of poultry seasoning and a tablespoon of fresh chopped parsley to my onion-celery mixture after the light sauté. Salt and pepper each layer. Drizzled with about 3 tablespoons of melted unsalted butter to keep moist during transport to bake on-site. This would be yummy with leftover turkey and dressing after Thanksgiving...just mix up the soups and sour cream, sauté a few more veggies and top with the leftover dressing (stuffing) and drizzle with butter.

That was the best chicken casserole that I ever made. I know it’s called chicken fettuccine but I did make it in a casserole dish LOL. I made it exactly like the recipe only I didn’t have any cottage cheese and it still turned out wonderful. The leftovers were even better warmed up a little butter.

I’ve never had a recipe I needed to make again so quickly - but this was the best!! I didn’t set out to modify it, but I wanted to make more: I used two (smallish) rotisserie chickens, 5 stalks of celery and a very large yellow onion (sautéed in a whole stick of butter, kosher salt and black pepper, and for longer), twoand the whole can of mushroom soup. It filled my 9x13 pan

I didn’t add the extra half can of soup. I added some milk.
Also added chopped water chestnuts for a nice crunch. 
Can also add mushrooms or mild red peppers.

I made it in 3 small disposable aluminum pans. Froze and took to some elderly friends.

This was very good. I also followed 2 of the changes recommended by previous reviews : 2 boxes of chicken stuffing and the low sodium chicken broth instead of water to make the stuffing.

I have made this several times but my first post.  I think it works better if everything is mixed together over trying to layer it.  The family loves it and there is never anything left. I have also made it using boiled chicken seasoned with salt and poultry seasoning.  Just as good if you have chicken in the freezer and not wanting to buy more.

I made this and my husband loved it. I did make my homemade dressing (he loves it so much)  and we ate it for two nights.  I Will definitely make it again.  We didn't find it to be salty.

New favorite for the whole family, my husband said it is amazing although he is not a chicken eater, no leftovers.
I added carrots and peas to it, Worcestershire sauce to the soup and sour cream mix.
This recipe is a keeper.

I made the recipe as written - used low sodium chicken flavored Stove Top, rotisserie chicken, and Reduced fat sour cream. Very delicious! Made it for a friend & her family for dinner - even the kids loved it! It was done in less than 45 minutes- I think an hour would have been way too long in the oven.

This is a very tasty dish that is easy to make.   My husband loves comfort food and this recipe hits the mark.  I added sautéed mushrooms because I had them
In the fridge.   But even without them the recipe is delicious. I make this all the time.

Amazing with a few changes.  As others did, I substituted reduced-sodium chicken broth for the water and used two packages of stuffing, doubling the liquid and butter. I didn't add any salt.  I used the whole can of cr of mushroom soup along with the cr of chicken soup and sour cream (I might use only 4 oz of sour cream next time), and I added 1 Tbsp of Worcestershire sauce.  Instead of rotisserie chicken, I used 3-4 boneless chicken breasts that I cooked in the microwave.  I only baked the casserole for 40 minutes.  Definitely a keeper!

I made this with the following changes: I used 2 boxes of Stove Top chicken stuffing, instead of one. I also used one whole can of cream of mushroom soup and a half a can of cream of chicken soup. I added a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce to the soup and sour cream mix. I sautéed a half of a yellow onion with garlic and then threw in sweet peas at the end to the sauté mix to give the peas flavor.

I make this every year after Thanksgiving--I use left over turkey instead of chicken, but everything else is the same.  I remember my old recipe didn't use sour cream but used mayo.  Since I didn't have any sour cream I used mayo.  It turned out great and was a big hit with the family.

Made the recipe and followed the directions to a T. Think this will be on the Thanksgiving menu this November. Just cooking the onions and celery made everyone come to the kitchen to see what was cooking. Even the dog was interested. Why am I surprised??? Looking forward to a great dinner tonight!

This is a great recipe..tasty and easy. I changed a few things...first I put the sauteed onions and celery in the stuffing instead of on the chicken. Then I used Greek yogurt instead of sour cream in the soup mixture. I also added a bag of broccoli slaw to the soup mixture. And skipped the extra salt as there was plenty in the soups even with reduced sodium. The only thing I'll change next time is to add more stuffing!

This turned out really good. I did exactly as written with 1 can of cream of chicken and 1/2 can of cream of mushroom soup. I did not add the salt, just used fresh ground pepper. I did not cook it for the whole hour as it looked like it was done after about 45 minutes. It was a delicious hit. Would definitely make again, Thank you the recipe! 
BTW : It was no where near "ugly" as some have said..It looked delicious and it was!
Sorry no pic, it disappeared too fast!

Made this recipe and loved it! Makes for great leftovers! :)  I made a few changes just based off of my personal taste. I added a little less of the sour cream than recommended so that the taste of the sour cream was not as apparent. I also added a layer of bread crumbs in between the soup mixture and stuffing layers to add a bit of crunch. Very delicious recipe!!

Fantastic!  I made using healthy request soups (for less sodium) added baby carrots and a bit more celery, a dash of cayenne pepper with the soup and sour cream mix and I used 2 box of low sodium stove top and 1 regular herb flavor.  Thanks for a great recipe that even the picky eaters enjoyed.  Unfortunately, we all over-ate :-)

I made this exactly as the recipe stated. It was just ok. I thought by the rating and comments that it'd be much better. The kids thought it was "meh". They would have rather had the rotisserie chicken and stuffing separately. Probably won't make again.

Made this for a friend having not tried it first, which was scary but paid off. She said it was delicious, so I made it again, and she was right. I omitted salt, and added garlic, but left the recipe alone otherwise. Thank you for a new go-to comfort recipe!

This was a good, easy to put together, meal.  We just had a small gathering over for Thanksgiving and this was the perfect dish to save me from having to do a whole turkey.  Given that it was so much chicken, I did double the amount of stuffing.  I think store-bought stuffing mixes always need a bit of help so I added extra celery along with some sage, and thyme.  Also, since my husband is allergic to mushrooms, I used Cream of Celery soup instead of the mushroom soup.  It all came out great.  Everyone loved it!

Made this tonight, it was delicious, the whole pan was wiped clean. I made it almost exact. I added the chicken in with the celery and onion mixture. I doubled the whole recipe. After baking, it didn't seem like there was enough stuffing, so I mixed it in, added more on top and baked for another 10 min. My family devoured it!

I  was feeling under the weather and made this for comfort... It was SO delicious! I did make my own stuffing: Sauteed celery, onion, garlic in pot, then added torn up bread and chicken stock. I also used chicken breasts that I cut and did a quick saute before putting in the 8x10 pan.  I used Cream of Chicken soup and Golden Mushroom soup.. the flavor and texture was just fabulous!

This was outstanding after a few additions.  1) used poultry seasoning on roasted chicken. 2) sauteed garlic with onions and celery 3) after soup layer added season salt with pepper and salt.  We loved loved this!!
