There's nothing quite like good old-fashioned strawberry shortcake! I must admit though I did have to play with this recipe a bit to make it work for me.  I doubled the sugar as I like a sweeter shortcake and I reduced the cinnamon to 1 tsp. I added a little more egg and cut back on the butter. Since I wasn't sure how "whipped cream" would turn out so I used buttermilk instead and enough to get the dough workable.  I let wrapped the dough in plastic wrap and let it chill for a half hour.  I then rolled it out onto a well floured surface and cut it with heart shaped cookie cutters before putting it into the oven. I also did an egg wash and topped the heart-shaped shortcakes with a bit of turbinado sugar for a little extra crunch. They baked up beautifully and tasted great with the strawberries and whipped cream. A wonderful summertime treat and a great way to use fresh strawberries!

Following the recipe, the dough is very sticky.  I worked with what I had - I lined the bottom of muffin pans with parchment paper, baked at 300 for 25 minutes and as soon as they came out of the oven I made an indent in each one, forming a sort of cup.  They did not stick to the pan at all, and they are delicious.
