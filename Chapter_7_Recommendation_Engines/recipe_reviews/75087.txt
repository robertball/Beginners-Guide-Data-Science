I cut the recipe in half & subbed about a tsp of horseradish for the mustard seeds. (it was the recommended sub for black mustard seeds by foodsubs.com). I used a dried chipotle chile pepper. Next time I will cut the pepper by half...it was very spicy. I even used more than the called for sugar to try & cut through the spicyness. Luckily, I served this w/ Mango Madness Salad (from this site) which really helped cool things off. I will make again but I will cut back on the chile. I loved the sugary garlic pieces...next time I am making some candied garlic cloves  to use as a garnish. (boil about 10 cloves in a cup of water for about 8 minutes or until water is mostly gone. Add a couple of tbp of sugar & cook, stirring constantly until sugar is golden brown...turn out onto greased pan or parchment paper)

This recipe is phenomenal.  I've made it many times, varying the recipe each time (adding a bit of fresh ginger, removing the chile peppers, adding additional veggies, reducing oil, etc.) and it always turns out fantastic.  It's quick, scalable, fairly healthy and delicious.  Thank you, CeesHouse!

My new favorite green bean recipe!  I cut way back on the oil (2 or 3 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil) and cooked this in a non-stick skillet.  Everyone loved it. Next time I will have to double the recipe.

I used 1 tsp mustard powder rather than the black mustard seed as I didn't have any on hand but this was FANTASTIC! Thank you for sharing!

These were really good.  I had a hard time finding black mustard seeds, but finally found them in an Indian market.  I used crushed red pepper instead of the dried chilie pepper and it was plenty spicy.  I did cut back on the oil as well.

The browned mustard seeds and garlic gave this dish a wonderful flavor--salty and smoky, but surprisingly not too garlicky. I used olive oil and omitted the sugar, and it was great without it. This was good with the green beans, but I think it would be even better with sauteed spinach. The beauty of this recipe is you can use it with pretty much any veggies.

A really good green bean recipe.  And, I'm not a huge green bean fan.  I did not have black mustard seed (nor have I ever heard of it) but the internet told me to sub horseradish for it.  That was the only change I made to the recipe.  This recipe has been in my recipe box for a very long time.  I'm really glad I finally made, and I will be using this one again.

Very tasty! The only change I made was to use half a fresh hot pepper, instead of a dried one...I don't like a lot of spice :) The browned up garlic bits were delicious! I did think it turned out too oily, maybe less next time. Great way to use up the first batch of garden beans this year, thanks for sharing the recipe!

I didn't have whole dried chilies, so I used some chili flakes - probably too many, it was too spicy to eat all of it. But the flavor was very good! I used 3/4 green beans and 1/4 corn, to balance the spicy flavor and for color.

I followed another poster's suggestion and used a little bit of horseradish instead of the mustard seeds. It was a delicious substitute. I also added a handful of cashews at the end of cooking and used raw sugar instead of white. Thanks for passing along a keeper!

This is a very nice way to spice up plain old green beans. I had forgotten to add the salt and pepper and it was still wonderful!

Thank you to all of the people suggesting mustard and/or horseradish to the seasoning.  I've been making this dish since the 80's - has it really been that long?!  But sometimes it doesn't have the kick I was dreaming of.  For anyone who is afraid of burning the garlic, do not worry about that.  You're kind of supposed to.  Last year, we had a Thanksgiving dinner in my daughter's class.  These are special needs children, and the aid there is from India.  So I brought all of the ingred for this recipe and the cookbook and she cooked it up (the kids helped to prep the beans).  Anyway, it was far and away the best this dish has ever tasted, and the garlic was brown.  The kids just downed it. Today, I tried to cook it like she did, but it isn't the same.  So I'm cheating with horseradish and prepared mustard, haha!!!  Thank you again for all of the posts.

My husband and I really liked these.  They had a good flavor and were a little spicy.  I used maybe 2 TBL olive oil and 1 tsp horseradish instead of the black mustard seed as per other reviews.  I forgot the sugar and didn't miss it.  The green beans had a great flavor without it.

Served with Tandoori fish, rice, and nan.  Good with Chardonnay.  I cut back on the red pepper and oil, and it was plenty hot but not overpowering.  Restaurant quality food.

I used yellow mustard seeds rather than black (they have a more mild flavor).  Also, you can use evoo rather than veg oil for the nutritional value - and it didn't need quite a 1/4 c. Start with 2-3 T and add more if needed. Also,  mine was a bit salty so start with 3/4 tsp and then salt additionally to taste. Very good served with Grilled tandoori chicken thighs and curried rice pilaf.

3.3.12 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/75087/spicy-indian-gujarati-green-beans/ ... I subbed mustard powder for mustard seed.  Maybe that's why it wasn't so good, only okay. 'Tried again with 1t horseradish.  Since horseradish flavor lessens with heat, I added it (& some crushed red pepper) at the end.  'Still no raves.  It still didn't maintain much horseradish flavor - smelled like it, but didn't really taste it.

I love -love --LOVE -this dish!  This has been a consistent crowd pleaser. 
I have made this about 15x's over the past few years & have turned more than a few people on to this excellent, tasty, & vegetarian side. 
I cut the oil quite a bit, & use Organic Coconut Oil...
I Increase the Red Pepper flakes ('cause I do love the  spiciness of this recipe), ...
But whatever you do, 
..DON'T SKIP the BLACK MUSTARD SEEDS! - They're a little hard to find (try online, like Vitacost.com or Amazon.com) but they MAKE this dish! They're an  essential part! 

It's got all the elements! It's a little salty, a little savory, a little sweet (you NEED the sugar to balance the salt) with a little Indian heat; it's great. - Serve piping-hot w/ fresh ground black pepper!

Like others, I didn't have the black mustard seed on hand so I used 1 teaspoon of mustard powder and 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper.  Turned out very well.  Next time I will try and track down the exact spices.  It was very good as I made it, but I know with the exact spices mentioned it would be even better.

Excellent dish.  I don't usually measure oil, so may have used a bit less - otherwise made exactly to recipe.

Don't overcook the beans or else they are mushy.  Didn't have the mustard, so left it out.  Will try again and I'm sure it will be better next time.

Absolutely delicious. Didn't have a whole chili, so I used half a tablespoon of mixed crushed cayenne, habanero, and pequin peppers my family dries and makes from scratch. Nice and tasty with a kick.

Great dish. Like other reviewers I cut down on oil. If you stir it religiously you can get away with 1-2 table spoons of oil. And you do have to stir as garlic burns! Also not sure about the purpose of sugar. I did skip it and the dish turned out great.

I love these green beans!  Although I did use a few sub items based on the reviews of others. I used prepared horseradish in place of the mustard seed, EVOO instead of the veg oil, and crushed chiles (the kind you put on pizza).  I like to eat the leftovers cold, that is if there are any!  Thanks for the recipe Ceeshouse and others!

I learned this recipe from a  Madhur Jaffrey cookbook long ago and it has been my go-to recipe ever since. It is awesome with any vegetable but i find it really shines with grean beans, broccoli or carrots. Perfect way to cook the french style frozen green beans from Trader Joes.

Five stars, not because it is perfect, but because this is my new favorite green bean dish. My husband and I are both usually bored by green beans . . . not this time! These were very flavorful. Next time, I will cut back on the oil a bit and use just 2 or 3 Tbsp. I may also turn up the heat on the oil to better release the flavor from the mustard seeds.

Wonderful!  I thought the seeds would make it too grainy, but no way!  I followed the recipe exactly (except used the steamable vegetables, which made one less step) and was quite surprised at how tasty this was.  It was a little too spicy for me, so next time I will use only half the red pepper.  Thanks for sharing.

These were really yummy!  I cut down on the oil - to between one and two tablespoons and added water when things began to stick.  Just to cut down on the fat.  I also used cayenne pepper since I didn't have any dried chiles, which gave it a nice kick.  Great recipe!

First this is a great recipe.  I’d give it 5 stars but the recipe and the video do not quite jibe. The recipe asked to crush a chili pepper and add it to the garlic and mustard seed mixture. The video adds a slightly crushed chili pepper that is still whole and removed in the end prior to serving.

Maybe 1/4 of the oil called for. I had to add more horseradish just to balance it out but I like things spicy. I just added a little more sugar and some salt and it came out sweet, sticky and garlicky. I will do this again and probably shake it up a little just for fun.

bf liked this more than i did.. after reading some reviews i was worried about adding the sugar so i left that out and cut down significantly on the oil.. i also had to sub 1/2 the black mustard seeds with mustard powder.. i think i understand what the submitter was trying to achieve.. a nutty flavored green bean dish.. unfortunately i would have preferred almonds, walnuts, or even sesame seeds in place of the mustard seeds.. i splashed some lemon on the finished product and was content

I did not have black mustard seeds on hand but looked up substitutions and found that ground yellow mustard can be used as follows:  3/4-1 tsp mustard powder = 1 tsp mustard seed.  Looking forward to trying this again after I track down some black mustard seed.

The only real change I make to this recipe to is to add a little bit more black mustard seed. This is just about the only way I fix green beans now! I can stand over the stove and eat them straight out of the pan - they are soooo yummy! This is a fabulous recipe. Thanks for sharing; be sure to try this one.

Very good as a side dish ....I am doing an Indian dinner in a few weeks and trying out new dishes ... This one is easy to prepare and delicious ..... I tried it with 2 red chili peppers as I love spicy but it was too much . I've made it 3 times now and will definitely serve it . Giving this a 10/10  .

I thought this recipe was really good, although my son wasn't as crazy over it, even though he really likes green beans and spicy food. And know this: the recipe is really spicy! I didn't have black mustard seeds, just yellow, so its probably even spicier with the right mustard seeds. It was still a great side with some butter chicken.

great base. I had to drain my beans cause it was just sitting in oil, but otherwise it is really good. Yellow mustard seeds works well.

I make this every few weeks. I have to TRY to NOT make it every night so my family doesn't get tired of it.
When I first tried it, I had horseradish in the fridge, so I subed (1 Tbs) that for the black mustard seed until I had used it up. Then, I went to the local Pakistani market and bought the black mustard seed. I like the horseradish better!
Very oily, can get by with 1/2 the oil, I think. 
I use frozen green beans for convenience. (I've tried fresh--wasn't an improvement, in my opinion.) Use crushed red pepper flakes in place of the chili pepper(about 1 tsp--we like spicy). This will get your family to eat more vegetables, and is super easy!

Neither my husband or I were a fan.  I think the taste was just a little too different for us.  I will try to make these again, however, just in case I did something wrong and I will report back once I have.

Yes!  Very good!  My kids were picking the green beans out of the pan as I sautéed it!  I cut the oil back to about 1/3 the recommended, still cooked great!  The black mustard seeds were easy to find at a local Indian market, $1.69.

The only thing I did differently was to "French" my green beans (any excuse to use a kitchen gadget). This recipe was so simple that I was sceptical, but this dish was truly delicious.

Excellent!  My husband couldn't get enough of this recipe. I didn't have a hot red pepper, so I used about 1 teaspoon of red pepper flakes. Just the right amount of heat. Thanks for posting this - I will definitely make again!

Had to improvise - no black mustard seeds, but I figured that no one was the wiser. Used Garam Masala blend instead, and fantastic, TASTY results! Didn't measure, but whatever amt was great. I also added Coriander, and a little ginger powder. No beans from the garden on this attempt, but the steam in the bag worked great - 1/2 the time in the microwave, and then slow simmer in the pan. mmmmmmmm

Way too much oil! You need barely 2 tsp. oil and No need to pre cook the beans either! No Indians I know pre cook the beans...beans are stir fried after the mustard seeds pop in oil and spices are then added. (I an Indian). You can cook all green vegies the same way.

I'm always on the lookout for vegetable and vegetarian recipes that are tasty, use inexpensive ingredients - especially if I keep them on hand - and don't require a lot of work to prepare. Last night I made this Indian green bean recipe and was delighted with the results, however I made a few small changes: I used canola oil instead of butter (about 2 Tbsp., not 1/4 cup), brown mustard seeds instead of black, as that's all I had, and only had 1/2 pound of green beans, so I added 1/2 lb. of carrots, cut in the same size and shape as the beans. I steamed the carrots over boiling water until almost tender, then blanched the beans in the boiling water for three minutes before shocking both the carrots and the beans in cold water. I then sauteed the vegetables in the oil in a large pan and seasoned them with the salt, sugar, crushed chili, and 1/4 tsp. pepper. I served the beans with tandoori chicken (chicken pieces marinated in tandoori paste and plain yogurt, then baked). Both my husband and I loved the flavour of the garlicky vegetables. The only change I'll make in future is to cut back the salt to 3/4 tsp. Although the two-step preparation is a little more work than I'd like, this recipe is definitely a keeper.

I took a chance and tried this recipe for Thanksgiving. I wanted something a little more than plain green beans. I had to go to several markets to find the black mustard seeds and the dried red chili pepper. It was spicy, but not too spicy. All of the flavors complimented each other. A delicious side dish. I didn't change anything.

This was quite good - just watch the salt.  Ours was too salty.  We will make it again but maybe start with half of the salt and adjust from there.

I love green beans and wanted to find other ways to fix them. I bought one of the huge frozen green bean package from Sam's Club and used those. Used horseradish rather than black mustard seed as others suggested.  Liked it and would make it again for sure, but not my favorite green bean dish.

Perfect.  Was looking for a recipe for Indian green beans.  Look no further.  We ate most of them out of the pan before the rest of the meal was ready!

Hmmm...I had to try this as I love all the ingredients.  However, I did decide to nix the sugar but this was very good.  I used frozen green beans and steamed just until they were warm.  Instead of 1/4 c. oil I used 2 tbsp. canola (will try olive oil next time) and 2 tbsp. of butter.  After that I tossed in the green beans until nice and warm.  I love how the green beans were nice and crisp & the kick of the pepper added a nice touch.  Thanks CeesHouse!  It's nice to see a green bean recipe that doesn't call for canned cream soup for a change of pace!

Sorry folks...I thought this recipe was horrible.I made it with Indian butter chicken and neither got good.The green beans were too odd a combination of sweet and spicey...it wasn't a good kind of sweet and spicey.Oh well. it was worth a try though.

I used a little less than one chile pepper, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  It was delicious!
