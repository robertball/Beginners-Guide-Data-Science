We liked these cookies!  I guess I made mine a little thinner than asked for because I got 35 of them.  I made half the frosting at first because I wanted to be sure about the color of it.  That would have made enough for 28 cookies, so if you are only needing one color, you could consider that.  I used neon pink coloring.  Nice cookies!

Easy to make and easy to decorate.  I added almond extract also to the cookie mixture, along with the vanilla.
