First of all follow the recipe... I made this and forgot to spray ramekins with Pam and also forgot to put foil over roasting pan. Pulled out after 45 minutes and surprisingly it was still delicious . But was frustrated that I didn't follow instructions so I made another batch this time following recipe and instructions to the letter. I also used a trick I do when I make Creme brûlée  . I put a dish towel on the bottom of the roasting pan before I pour in the water bath. Well anyway the first batch was delicious but the second was outstanding!! It looked so perfect and when my daughter and her boyfriend came over the next day for lunch they were just amazed. Trust me just follow the recipe and the instructions and you will really enjoy this flan. Thank you for the recipe...

This recipe is great. I didn't need to make any changes. I used creamy coconut milk, though. By the way, if you can't find 4 oz. ramekins, don't worry. You'll need the regular ones (7 oz.).

So creamy and delicious! Follow the recipe though...I forgot to grease the ramekins and the crystallized sugar stuck to the bottom of the dish.

This was my 1st time making flan. It should have had MORE details in the recipe. Like cooling the caramel before laying the custard in the pan. Also a little more description was absolutely necessary in regards of turning sugar into caramel. I will try again, but a different recipe altogether.
