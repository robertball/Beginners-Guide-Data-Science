A version of this recipe has been in the family cook book for at least 4 generations. We are incapable of eating pork chops without it! The only differences are that we peel, core and grind the pears raw before cooking. Cooking first might be less time consuming because they would be easier to peel. Also we do not use onions but extra red bell peppers. (They are very attractive in the jars.) For variety, the last batch I made, I added chipoltle peppers. This went over well with this family that usually wants it "just like grandma made."

This is one of the best relishes I've tasted. Is like a hot mustard sauce and is great on everything. (chcken, hamburgers, crackers, pretzels) I can't stop eating it. Have made it all weekend as I had a lot of pears to can. Will make this every year.

Love this relish.  Just the right amount of sweet & sour.  The only changes I made were to add 1 and a half large red bell peppers which gave it nice color and doubled the jalapeno peppers because mine were milder than usual.

I made this recipe as is for the first batch and with a little extra jalapeño for the second batch.  I peeled and chopped my pears first before I cooked them. I did not chop them up in the food processor.  I gave it as gifts and everyone is begging for more.  We used it on pork chops and my husband kept eating more after the chop was gone.  It is great on any meats, as a dip for pretzels, on cream cheese as a spread for crackers. This is the best recipe of all pear recipes I have made. I will be making it every year when the pears are ready.

I really liked this relish.  I've had it on sandwiches and it adds a nice extra to the sandwich.  A little sweet, but not too much.

This is similar to the way my grandmother made it.  They had a large vegetable garden and would eat it on field peas and butterbeans.  As a child, I would not eat these kinds of vegetables without it.  She didn't use jalapenos, but I was thinking of adding them anyway.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I have a lot of pear trees so I'm always looking for different recipes for them.  This is one of the best things I've done with my pears.  I added several fresno peppers just because I had them in the fridge.  I also reduced the amount of mustard.  I can't wait to put this on black eyed peas.  I've been eating it with a spoon since I made it this morning.

The times aren’t even close to accurate. The pears were tough after 20 minutes of boiling. The relish takes closer to 2 hours to boil down before canning.

My only complaint is with the picture which clearly shows 1/2 pint jars vice 1 pint jars.  Other then that the recipe is awesome.  I just put the rest into unsterilized pint jars to give folks with the knowledge that they need to refrigerate immediately.  And since I have them I used red jalapeño peppers at the least for color as well as taste.

I peeled and quartered the pears before cooking and used habeneros and a carolina reaper. The batch with just habs is really good. The batch with the reaper and habs is good but really hot.

Also, the consistency is like apple sauce. I will not chop so finely or cook so thoroughly next time. I might experiment with the amount of mustard (less, not more).

I didn't have any jalapeno peppers so I added four teaspoons of Spice Islands Ground Chipotle Chile Peppers. Wonderful smoky hot flavour. Quite tart and I will be using this on hot dogs and ham. This was a terrific way to use up the box of pears on the porch I forgot someone gave me.

My mom and I followed the recipe except instead of putting 12 pears in it, we put 9lbs  of pears which equaled out to 18 pears.    Since the extra pears we put 2 1/2 cups of both sugar and apple cider vinegar.  I read other reviews about the mustard, so we left it out completely.  It was so delicious as it was cooking and I was stirring it I couldn't help but keep sampling it.  She is already planning for us to do it again, she also wants to try apples and see how it turns out.

I substituted 5 banana peppers since I didn't have jalepenos.  It was a little too hot for me, but my husband and son really liked it.  I added extra pears to try to 'cool' it down.  Next time I'll use the jalepenos or cut back a little on the banana peppers.  Definitely will be a next time. Thanks for the recipe.

Just made my second batch! It's delicious and wonderful on all types of beans and on pork! I used a mix of colored bell peppers for added color plus a little extra hot pepper.

I thought it was good. We love spicy food, so I threw in more jalapeños and a some Serrano peppers that I had grown. I thought the mustard over-powered all the other favors and I even skimped on the mustard. If I make again, I will either leave out the mustard, or just try adding slightly less than a cup.

Tastes amazing! Love the pork chop suggestion. Gonna have a lot of fun taste testing on this and that. Thank you.
