Although this cake had a fair taste, I would not compare it to a regular carrot cake.  The taste is not the same as one with regular shredded carrots.  The baby food definitely overpowered.

This was a delicious carrot cake.  I made a fat-free version of it by substituting applesauce for the oil, and eggbeaters for eggs.  It still turned out very moist and delicious!!

I served this for my sister's tea party birthday.  My mom said it was the best cake she EVER had!  That's saying a lot coming from a choc-a-holic.  Super yummy and very easy to make.  I felt like I was cheating with the baby food, but it turned out so beautiful we didn't miss the grated carrots at all!

My house smelled heavenly while my cake was baking!  The taste is good, the texture light.....I think I like a denser cake for my taste.  I added a cream cheese frosting to mine.  I think I'll keep experimenting with carrot cakes.

This cake was OK, for a spice cake. No carrot taste at all. And it was quite dry. Will probably not make again.

Very moist and easy carrot cake recipe!!  I actually used this recipe to make carrot muffins.  I reduced the amount of sugar to 1 and 1/2 cups, but the muffins were still good. The next time I make, I would add some chopped walnuts or crushed pineapple. Thanks for the recipe, Toni!

I have a recipe very similar to this that I got from a gal in Michigan about 23 years ago. It's a bit thinner than an original carrot cake, but it is great with cream cheese frosting. Best the following day. It's a great taster!!

Very moist and delicious. I used 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce. No pineapple or coconut and I didn't have allspice. I put nuts on the side of the cake as well. Got rave reviews from guests. I used cream cheese frosting II.

Having to NOT shred carrots was a bonus.  This cake was moist and tasty.  And very easy to make even for a beginner like me.
