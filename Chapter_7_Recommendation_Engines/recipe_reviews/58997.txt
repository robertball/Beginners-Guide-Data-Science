Made this for dinner last night and I must say we were pleasantly surprised! We were surprised because I didn't expect it to turn out as well as it did. The ingredient list seemed sort of bland and I thought it may be lacking in something. But no, it wasn't really lacking in anything. The flavor was excellent. I did take advice from some of the other reviewers and let the fish sit in the marinate for a full 8 hours. I used a ziploc bag so I could get all the air out and the swordfish filets seemed to absorb more of the flavor that way. I think this would work with just about any type of fish you'd like. It's going in my archives for future use... Thanks for this nice surprise of a recipe!

I've made this a few times now and it's a keeper!  everyone loves it, so easy, all ingredients on hand.  One suggestion to  all...I hate opening a new bottle of white wine for a little bit needed in a recipe, so now I buy those little 4-packs in the liquor store and keep them around for recipes like this!!!  No waste!

I found this to be brain dead easy.  I did add one modification. After the steaks were in the marinade I grated fresh ginger over the steaks.  Everyone was blown away.  FYI you can buy a ginger root, wrap it in plastic wrap and freeze it forever.  When you want to use it. Take it out frozen and grate it.  Fantastic!

My wife is on Weight Watchers. The recipe for the swordfish was GREAT! I didn't have any white wine at the time, but did subitute a desert wine.This gave the fish a nice light sweet taste. (I got this idea from when we were in Alaska.  
Thanks for your recipe.

Wonderful!  This was soooo delicious.  I did change it to 1 table oil of seasame oil and 1 table spoon of olive oil.  Also added toasted seasame seeds to top it off.  Very good.  Served with Brown Rice and Corn on ALL Recipes and Summer Squash on All Recipes as well.

This marinade was awesome!  I cut up the swordfish steaks for kabobs and marinated for 8 hours.  I will definitely use this recipe again.

I live in the middle of nowhere and swordfish was still cheaper than a decent cut of steak.

You've probably got all the ingredients already.  Take a few minutes to mix up the marinade and throw it in the fridge.  Oh look, you used white wine in the marinade!  What a coincidence - you cracked a bottle of wine for the food and now have an hour to kill!

When it's finally time to cook the steaks, it'll only take 10min on high heat for them to come out perfectly.  Turn them slightly half way through each side to get that nice crosshatch marking from the grill.  And throw in some frozen veggies for a great side.

Now you've had an hour over some nice white wine and are eating phenomenal swordfish.

Good, but I think I will follow another reviewer's idea of cutting the fish into kabobs.  The marinade did not fully infuse the steaks even after 8 hours.

This recipe is FANTASTIC. I love it so much that sometimes I have it twice in one week! It's a real hit in my family and I keep telling friends that I need to make it for them. The marinade is very easy (although sometimes I double the recipe to accomodate extra swordfish steaks and I use sesame oil instead of olive oil for a more Asian flavor) and involves many regular household cooking ingredients. Eat and enjoy!

This was good.  I decided to let the fish marinate a little bit longer than the recipe called for....and I wish that it had a little bit more flavor than it did.  Other than that it turned out very well.  Thanks for the post.

I made this last night for me and my boyfriend (husband).  I followed this recipe exactly as it was written, with no substitutions.  It was absolutely delicious!  We loved it and can't wait to make it again.  I served it with rice,  fresh asparagus broiled with olive oil kosher salt and parm cheese along with a fresh tomato salad with hot cherry peppers and fresh chopped basil.

I give this 5 stars for my boyfriend although I found the fish a bit rubbery but I usually eat salmon. He loved it though and said he definitely wants me to cook it again. Thanks, Mike!

The flavors on this swordfish did not really come through even after soaking in the ingredients.  I think there might have been too many ingredients competing to flavor the fish and ended up not doing much for the fish at all.  Honestly, the swordfish tasted better when I just seasoned it with plain garlic salt alone.

WOW!  So easy and much better than any swordfish from a 5 star restaurant.  So juicy and the flavor is amazing.  I followed the recipe exactly and marinated for 2 hours...going to let the other pieces marinate overnight and cook tomorrow.  Key is to not overcook.  Thank you for this recipe.  My all time favorite!!!

We love this so much, we haven't used a different recipe. Just make sure you don't overcook the steaks--on my Weber set on high, two minutes per side does it.

Served it tonight to my husband and in-laws and everyone said it was the best swordfish they'd ever had.  The only change I made was using a teaspoon each of thyme and marjoram in place of the tablespoon of poultry seasoning.  I did as other reviewers suggested and marinated it in a ziploc bag in the fridge for an hour.  Thank you for posting it!

Sauce had great flavor but didn't make it's way into the meat.  Next time we will either cut the fish into kabobs or make cross-hatch marks on the outside of the fish to get more flavor!

Ever since the first time I used this marinade for my oven baked fish, I've been using it for other things like chicken, shrimp and even beef. Amazing.

Amazing swordfish recipe. Don't be scared by the poultry seasoning! I was, but it turned out fantastic. Brought the recipe to FL to cook for my mom in May and everyone was impressed. Making it again tonight! :)

Best swordfish I ever had, used chicken rub instead of poultry seasoing.  Marinated it in a plastic bag. Will try marinate with chicken.

This recipe was phenomenal!  We used our Food Saver cylindars to marinade the steaks, and it really only needed 10-20 minutes as the juice sucked right into the steaks (after extracting oxygen).  They were sooo flavorful!  We basted the steaks between flips.  We had to cook a little longer than indicated, more like 7-8 minutes each side.  Very tasty.  We made them with squash/zucchini cut lengthwise, lightly seasoned and put on the grill for about 5 minutes each side.  We will definitely use this recipe again!

We were pleasantly surprised by this! I was worried about all the poultry seasoning but it really added a nice flavor! I combined a bit of sour cream with minced onion, horseradish and dijon to make a garnish/sauce that went nicely over it. I would make this again! Thank you!

Excellent marinade, however agree with other reviewers that swordfish needs to be marinated 6-8 hours. I will also used a little more soy sauce next time.

my husband said it perfectly: the best fish dish we have ever cooked at home.  Truly delicious.  Of course, make sure you have premium quality ingredients - most importantly of which is the fish, of course.

This recipe is great, however it is good to know that for 6 minutes on both sides the steaks have to be 1 inch thick- Mine were 1/2 inch thick and I grilled them 3 minutes on each side, they were tender juicy and full of flavor - I also basted them while grilling.

My family and I are new to eating fish, and we loved this!  It smelled so good as hubby was grilling it.  I had to make a few changes as I didn't have everything on hand. I used Melting Pot seasoning blend - it has dehydrated wine in it, granulated garlic, and I added rotisserie chicken seasoning. I served this with a tossed salad, and cooked new potatoes and peas mixed w/ pesto sauce and lemon juice. YUM! YUM!  Try it, because you won't be disappointed.

This was amazing! First off... anything swordfish is incredible, but this just made it even better. I found this recipe for my fiance since he likes doing marinades. He always follows recipes strictly to the drop, and this was so yummy! Thanks for the great recipe!

I marinated the fish longer, about 4 hours. I also added some shrimp to the marinade and it was awesome! Will definitely use again. Quick and super easy. Thanx Mike!

Only used a little lemon juice and added some rosemary and lemon thyme, but it was still fantastic and easy to cook. Definitely will be cooking this again, and it certainly impressed the other half!

This is such a great and easy way to cook swordfish!  The marinade is easy to prepare and it doesn't take away from the flavor of the fish at all!

This marinade was easy and delicious!  Very forgiving also.  I was in a hurry and forgot to add the Soy Sauce.  Then the grill ran out of gas so I had to pan saute the fish instead of grilling it.  It was still moist and delicious!  The flavor complemented the fish very well.  I only let it marinate for about 40 minutes, next time I would try to let it sit longer to absorb more of the flavors.

We used this marinade the first time we made swordfish and we haven't looked for any others!  It's very good, very easy.  We didn't have the white wine so we just use apple cider vinegar.  Also, we let it marinate longer than an hour.  Company is coming tonight and this is on the menu!

I tried this recipe although I had my doubts about it.  I couldn't imagine a swordfish recipe that included poultry seasoning.  However, the flavors blended well and the swordfish turned out to be an excellent main dish.  If you haven't already, try this recipe.  I don't think you will be disappointed.

I thought this was a delicious recipe for swordfish.  We cooked on the grill as stated and it was delicious.  I could not get my calories at 258 tho, but maybe if I use a bit less oil (i used what was shown).  I marinated for 1 1/2 hrs.  I think longer would have been even better.  Great dish.  Thanks Mike.

My husband's favorite fish is swordfish but I have never been able to eat it.  This marinade is teriffic.  The swordfish was delicious even to me.  I put everything in a ziploc bag and smushed it around during the marinading time.  Toss the bag away, no cleanup. Love this recipe.

Excellent recipe!
I followed the recipe exactly except for cutting the swordfish into cubes and grilling them shishkabob-style.
The outside was slightly charred with a light crispy texture, while the inside stayed moist and flavorful from the marinade.
My husband said it was the most delicious fish he had ever eaten!

Excellent recipe. I changed it up a bit, and added a tablespoon of honey, no parsley, and a little more soy sauce. Instead of marinating it in a dish (cuz less clean up the better), I placed the fish in a large baggie then poured in the marinade. Sealed it and left it in the fridge.  This is a keeper for my family.

I've been making this dish for some time now and I can't believe I haven't reviewed it yet.  It is sooo good.  Personally its the best swordfish recipe I've found.  I try others but they just don't measure up.  This is a family favorite.  And another bonus: so easy to make! Thanks for the recipe.

Absolutely delicious!  Didn't have white wine - just left it out.  Served with lemon scented rice, and squeezed some more lemon and soy sauce over the swordfish and this came out perfectly!

This recipe was awsome!  I used mesquite flavored poultry seasoning (slightly less than a Tbsp.) and I accidentally mixed chopped parsley in with the marinade before I realized it was supposed to be a garnish, but it still turned out great.  I will make it exactly the same next time!

Delicious.  Did not have lemon, substituted mix of orange and lime juice.  Steaks were thick, 6 minutes were not enough.   Made a citrus risotto with remaining juice and zest from the orange and lime.  Restaurant quality dinner!

Really easy and delicious every time! I marinate it in a ziplock bag so I don't have to turn it. Also, I sometimes substitute 1 tbs. olive oil for 1 tbs. sesame oil.

very flavorful.. but i think i tasted the wine just a little more than i wanted to.. i used this on shark.. also let it sit for more than one hour as others suggested.. i did mine 18 hours unintentionally.. which was probably a bit longer than i should have.. either way i liked it.. would like to try it w/o the wine.. maybe add broth in it's place and marinate for a lot less time.. ty for the recipe

I admit that I did cook this to perfection....5 minutes on one side and then 4:30 on the other but the marinade was awesome too.  Will definitely make again.

Really good!  I didn't measure anything and broiled instead of grilled, and it still came out great.  I was a bit skepical about the poultry seasoning, but I couldn't tell that's what the "secret ingredient" was.  Don't skip it, it really makes the dish!

I cook swordfish regularly and this is the best recipe I have ever used for swordfish. I cooked it last night and gave some to my sister in law and she also said it was the best. The only thing I added was 1 teaspoon cajun spice. I cooked it on a charcoal grill.

Outstanding flavors.  Swordfish ended up juicy.  Kids and husband loved it, as did daughter's 12 y.o. friend who doesn't like fish, but tried it and asked for more.  Didn't change a thing in the recipe.

I bought some swordfish because it was on sale and had no idea how to cook it. This was the best recipe. My only change was cutting the oil down to about a teaspoon to cut down on the fat. My husband also raved, I ran back and bought more swordfish for an upcoming dinner party.

This was a very easy recipe and the fish came out delicious (and I don't even like fish!). I halved the recipe for 2 swordfish steaks, and also marinated about 25 large sea scallops in the same bowl.  A squeeze of lemon once the fish was plated made it even better.

We all liked except for my recently picky 3yo.  Didn't change anything except I don't have poultry seasoning so I just used oregano.  I won't look for a different recipe until this one gets boring.

Awesome!! Very easy and was a big seller to my kids and husband.  I used lime juice instead of lemon juice and grilled (2 -1") filets 7 min on first side 6 1/2 min on second side - perfect!!  (Otherwise I followed exactly)

Very good.  Agree with one of the other reviews that the longer you can marinade it, the tastier it is.  I thought the poultry seasoning sounded out of place when I first read the recipe, but I followed it exactly and was very good.  Will definitely use this again.

perfect. i needed a quick marinate (an hour as not in 8 hours), and luved it.  I am in RI and get the best swordfish, and this marinate did not abuse the fresh swordish.

We really enjoyed this swordfish for  dinner tonight! Used dry vermouth (no white wine in the house) and fish seasoning from Dean and Deluca. Marinated it about 8 hours. Served with  Broccoli Noodle Salad with Asian Peanut Citrus Sauce (from this site), subbed peas for broccoli.

I followed the recipe exactly except that I put the chopped parsely right into the marinating liquid. I marinated for 45 minutes and kept basting as I broiled the fish....about 6 min. each side! It was perfectly moist and delicious.....a nice change from my usual swordfish recipe so I will definitely make this again.

This was an excellent dish.  Flavorful and easy to prepare.  I left out the white wine (didn't have any) but otherwise didn't change a thing.  I was worried about it having too much soy sauce based on other reviews but it didn't stand out at all.  A definite keeper!

We made this tonight, excellent! I did omit the oil as I'm trying to be heart healthy, and I  only marinated for 45 minutes. Next time I will let it sit for 2 hours is our steaks are that thick again. Thanks this is a keeper!

I marinated this fish for 8 hours, I don't know maybe that was too long?  It was not good.  Sorry, will not make this again.  I think I will stick with  swordfish with mango salsa.

This was DELICIOUS!!  I made this and my husband and I enjoyed it with a nice wine.  It was tender, flaky, and just right!

This is excellent!  The swordfish has a wonderful flavor from the marinade.  I used a large ziploc bag to marinate the fish, and just squeezed out all of the air so the marinade had no where to go but into the fish.  Prepared on a grill and served with asparagus and wild rice - this was delicious!!!  All family members said this was a keeper.

Delicious!!!  Restaurant quality good!  I did not use the poultry seasoning (forgot it), and used probably a tsp of garlic powder since I was too lazy to chop garlic.  I also only had a Reisling on hand for the white wine, which I was afraid would be too sweet.  I didn't measure anything, used juice of half a lemon, and only let it sit in the marinade for about 10-15 minutes and then poured it on both sides during grilling, but it came out so delicious.  Thank you!

Very easy and delicious.  I live in NYC - no grill, so I used the broiler.  Cooked 5 min on each side on high. Worked perfectly. It's a keeper.

A great marinate! But my husband and I both agreed it need a little herbed butter for the finish.

Excellent flavor! I marinated the steaks a little longer -  3 hours, and had to cook the swordfish about 10 minutes on each side. Very easy, will make again. Thanks

I thought this was just okay.  I do  not think my kids enjoyed since neither one of them finished their plates, but in fairness, my husband really liked.  I am  not sure if I would make again.

I have made it a few times. I realize that you have to pick the right swordfish cut, next time I will stick will smaller cuts, I think that is the key.

I followed the directions. Marinated the fish for about 3 hours. The result was fabulous. The fish was moist  and the marinade delivered a subtle taste.  The fish looked great with a nice cross stitch on the surface from the bbq.  I did not add salt and a dash of pepper. Thank you.  My wife and I were skeptical.  Now we are believers.

This is the best marinade I have ever made! I cut everything in half as I only had one large swordfish steak.  At the recommendation from another reviewer, I substituted the olive oil for sesame oil, and I added freshly grated ginger.  I marinated the steak for 6 hours, and it was delicious!  I am going to use this marinade on other meats!

Super yum! I marinated for 2 1/2 hours - pierced the fish with a fork to absorb marinade and rotated every 30 minutes. We cannot have a gas grill where we live so when preheating the oven, I leave the cast iron skillet in - when oven is heated - take out the skillet and put on gas stove top at high heat. Pan sear the fish, turn over and return to oven to complete cooking. Top with a little melted butter and capers ... yum again!

Made this for a dinner party for 8.  Followed recipe exactly as written but I felt it was bland even though I marinated the steaks in sealed plastic zip lock bags for 8 hours.  Will try it again and increase recipe ingredients.

7/22/18 - I added about a tablespoon of minced ginger and some sesame oil to the marinade per other reviewers, let it marinate in the fridge for about 24 hours (not intentionally, it just worked out that way).  Cooked up very nicely with great flavor.  Served with grilled zucchini and an Alfredo pasta side.

It was delicious! The fish was nice and moist. I thought I had white wine,  but discovered that i only had red wine so I used white cooking wine.  I also noticed that it needed poultry seasoning which I don't keep on hand.  I looked up the ingredients/ amounts of spices  in poultry seasoning and made my own.  I did marinate the fish in a gallon sized sealable plastic bag and turned it every 15 minutes  for about 2 hrs.  My husband also enjoyed it and he was hesitant to get swordfish since I overcooked it last time.

This was the first time making swordfish, and wow did it turn out great!   Really easy recipe, but I also make a couple of the same changes others mentioned.   I cut it into approx. 2” x 3” sections and marinated in a sealed plastic bag for a couple of hours before placing on the grill.  I timed it exactly, turning at 5 min. each side.   I can’t wait to make it again.

I have made this countless times, and obviously love it. I switched to Halibut because of heavy metal concerns with swordfish. It is just as good. The halibut holds up well to grilling. I'd love to find a less expensive alternative (halibut is rarely less than $20/lbs)

Very good recipe. I added 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika for some heat and substituted a fish rub spice in place of poultry seasoning. Grilled to 145 F, and I think I could have gone 5-10 F lower

This turned out really good. I followed the recipe, but added more garlic to the marinade. I love garlic. I ended up cooking it in a cast iron skillet since it rained today. I know it will be even better on the grill.  I also made the rest of the marinade into a sauce with a little cornstarch in the skillet after the steaks finished cooking. Thank you for the recipe. I will definitely have this again. I want to try it with some salmon next.

WOW! so good!  We really are tarter sauce people.  Sometimes I make fish just so I can have tarter sauce, but this is something else.  By the time we were finished the only thing left on our plates was the tarter sauce.  I made a couple adjustment because I needed to work with what I had on hand so I used 2 T fresh lime juice and 2T ponzu sauce, added 2 tsp of fresh ginger and an orange coriander bbq rub instead of the poultry seasoning.  Marinaded 2 fillets in the whole amount of liquid for 8 hours and I would do it again and again and ... well you get the idea.

This was to die for delicious!  I ended up marinating it for about 30 hours because I got sidetracked that day.  The only ingredient change I made was double the garlic just because the hubs was trying out a new kitchen gadget and minced too much.  I also used a poultry seasoning recipe from this site because I didn't have any.  We cooked ours for about 4 minutes on each side and they were perfect.  I would say our steaks were probably 3/4 inch thick.

Definitely use a garlic press rather than mincing, gives more garlic flavor. Recipe flavors blended perfectly w pressed garlic and a cheap pinot grigio.

Used this marinade  on Mahi Mahi and was surprised at how good it was.  Grilled up the fish with some asparagus.  My husband and I thought it was one of the best marinades we hae found for fish.  Only takes an hour.

SO glad I tried this recipe! I will never make swordfish any other way ever again!!! The marinade is perfect for a summer grill-out. We paired with fresh roasted asparagus and long grain wild rice. This meal was a perfect 10 for my husband and I ... My 7 year old daughter even loved it! (but she could have done without the asparagus… Ha ha)

I followed the directions as written but listened to other reviewers' suggestions and marinated the swordfish for about 7 hours. We were just unimpressed with the flavor. It seemed a little bland but then some pieces were salty. Removing this from the recipe book.

WOW!  Very good. Even my husband, who doesn't care for fish, liked it...A LOT!

Next time I am going to marinate all day in the fridge. Also I substituted Mahi Mahi for the the swordfish...bet it would be good with salmon too!

I used 1 tbsp sesame oil and 1 tbsp olive oil. Added 1 tbsp oyster sauce. After putting fish on grill, I brought remaining marinade to a boil and reduced by 1/3. Served fish with a spoonful of reduced marinade. Will make again!

good!! I made it pretty much exactly, I just marinaded it for 3 hours without the lemon juice because that would cook the steaks. I added the lemon juice a few minutes prior to broiling the fish. For the chicken seasoning I just did a small mixture of basil, thyme, and oregano.

Soo good! Like another reviewer, I was also concerned it might turn out on the bland side since all of the ingredients were pretty basic (and the fact that I had them all on hand without having to run to the grocery store made it seem too easy/good to be true). I did marinate it longer than the recommended one hour - I let it marinate for about four hours. Absolutely delicious and I highly recommend-easy and delicious!

I am pleasantly surprised at the simplicity of this recipe.  It's just two of us, and short of adding some cayenne at the mans request it was just right.  Not too sweet, not too anything!  So many recipes require too many ingredients.  But this one hit the nail on the head.  If you are looking for a simple soup that doesn't require a ton of ingredients but packs the perfect flavor, this is it!

This was very good and very easy. I used Goya Adobo seasoning for the poultry seasoning and I minced up the garlic cloves with a knife.  There was no specification.  I ended up leaving the two very large swordfish steaks in the pan that I was marinating them in and popped it in the oven and baked them covered.  Everyone was a huge fan of the marinade and spooned the extra on their plates.

My second time with this dish, and it was even better than the first. The trick seems to be not to overcook it, so the pertinent variable is how thick the steaks are and you go from there as far as the cooking time. Since it is on the grill, you can watch it and tell when it is done on one side. Not every steak is going to require 5-6 minutes per side. Also, if it doesn't turn out the way you thought it would, try it again. Practice makes perfect, and Chefs become one with their creations. I don't think I'll even need to consult the recipe next time. I feel like I really have it down now.

We both thought this was a great quick meal. Made a couple "enhancements" due to our preferences and thought I'd throw them out... Made a reduction with the marinade (adding wine and soy as needed) to drizzle on the dish after it was cooked and, as another reviewer suggested added freshly ground ginger... Yum!!!

This was Perfect.  (Well my version anyway).   I had one steak just for me.   Figured about 1/3-1/2 of the ingredients. I used red wine vinegar instead of white wine.   I used a generous percentage of Old Bay seafood seasoning instead of poultry seasoning.

This marinade was just incredible. We soaked two large swordfish steaks in the exact recipe even though it was designed for 4. We flipped halfway through and then cooked on stove top with an Ikea pan with ridges. Our steaks were quite large so took longer to cook but the taste once finished was incredible. Thanks for this recipe we will make again. My 6 year old and 2 year old gobbled their pieces down as well.

This marinade is the reason we have swordfish several times a month. "Picky husband" loves it, too.  So easy to make, extremely flavorful.  One of our favorites!

I didn't expect it to be this good...loved it. Marinade also helped keep the fish juicy - my experience with swordfish previously was that it was too dry.

Didn't turn it frequently b/c i just don't see the point (only turned it over once), didn't add salt because of the soy sauce.  Comes out awesome every time.

Loved it!  Great taste but not over bearing.  I used a dry white wine (not a fan of sweet wine) and poured myself a glass to drink with it.

The flavors were good but a little too tangy.. it needed a little sweetness. Maybe more herbs. In any case what helped the marinade soak in was to poke the fish all the way through with a fork. And like another commenter I am also in NYC and it's the middle of the polar vortex so grilling isn't an option, but I used a stovetop grill which resulted in a nice aesthetic (see photo). I served it with sweet and sour kale. I would try it again and maybe make some adjustments.

Our grilled swordfish using this marinade was AWESOME!! I used the grated ginger and sesame oil in the mix as suggested by other reviewers. Both The Hub and I thought it tasted just like a melt in your mouth sirloin steak. Fish was only in marinade for an hour. We've been wanting to eat more fish and now we certainly will!

These were fantastic!  And really, really easy.  Because of our hectic schedule I had to let them sit for 2 1/2 hours in the marinade, but it wasn't too strong of a taste.  My kids loved it, and so did all the adults!  Will make this again!  Thank you!

OH MY HEAVENS!!! This was PHENOMENAL!!!!! I wish I could give this 10 stars.  Even my son who said "I don't do fish" loved this.  Followed the recipe to a T and it was perfect.  It did take a lot longer per side but that's because I had such thick kabobs.  Will definitely make this again!!!  Thanks MIKE T 007!!

This recipe is spot on. I agree that perhaps you may want to reduce the amount of lemon if you aren't partial to a stronger citrus flavor. However, the soy sauce and the wine & lemon do blend well. This was a home run and will be cooked again in our home. Good recipe!

VERY good! It makes me crazy when everyone says they adjusted the recipe, but I had to do it, too, since I did not have poultry seasoning. I used Jamacian Jerk seasoning instead but everything else the same. The swordfish steaks were awesome! 5-6 minutes each side was perfect, the grill was at 450 deg. and the steaks were aboout 1 to 1 1/4 inch thick. Thanks!

This recipe was great and easy!  I followed it exactly and marinated the steaks for approximately 6 hours.  They were grilled to perfection with great flavor and very juicy.  My boyfriend wants to eat these at least once a week!  I made the marinade and he did the grilling.

This took almost no time at all and was delicious!  I marinated for about 5 hours and the swordfish was full of flavor.  My husband and kids loved this!!

Very flavorful. I marinated the fish for about 5-6 hours and it was great. I cooked it in a frying pan with a little butter. Yum!

I didn't have any white wine on hand so I substituted with cider vinegar...I know, not really close in flavor but it didn't come out too bad.  It is a light marinade with good flavors.  I want to try it again with some white wine next time.

I made this the other night and ended up doing it inside in the broiler. It was amazing!! My boyfriend said this was the best swordfish that I have ever made.

Yum! This is the first time I've had swordfish so I don't know if it's the fish or the recipe, but this was delicious. Now I had to change a couple things but I don't think it mattered. I didn't have any sort of poultry seasonings so I threw in a little bit of oregano, and I didn't have white whine so I used a couple spoonfuls of amaretto (which I thought turned out very good). The way this cooks up and the texture is great, and I think there was plenty of flavor (fish is meant to be subtle, right?) 
I gotta give it a four out of five though I'd give it a five, just because my mom liked it less than me.

I'm rating this a 3 but I really wanted it to be a 5...I had made the Swordfish with Rosemary on this site before and was so impressed by it that I thought since this was so similar it would be almost as great or better.  Well, it wasn't near as great.  I marinated 5 smaller swordfish steaks for about 2 hours and I added extra fresh chopped garlic, fresh basil and it still didn't taste as fresh and light as the other one did.  I'm glad I tried it, but I am going to stick with the other one for my swordfish from now on.  I must say that this isn't bad by any means, just is really lacking in the flavor department.  I also forgot to puncture the fish to absorb the flavors too so maybe that had something to do with it not sure.  I don't think many people do that step with fish anyhow.

My husband and I eat a lot of fish, and this is one of my very favorite recipes! I marinated it quite a while in a plastic bag in the fridge. The flavor is outstanding!

This was very good -- not an overpowering marinade, but tasty and I imagine it would be good on salmon or other fish as well. However, I found I wanted a little something else though...Maybe next time I will serve it with a fruit salsa or something like that. This time we just had rice and a salad and just a little something was missing.

Outstanding!!!  My husband doesn't like fish at all and he absolutely loved this recipe.  I added a bit more garlic for added flavor.  I can't wait to make this again!

My husband loved this.  I thought it was ok. Thought the poultry seasoning was a little to much, would cut back on that next time.  Don't have a grill so I baked it at 400 for 20 minutes.

This was a really nice, basic marinade for swordfish.  I would make this again - grilling the fish is must.  I marinated the fish overnight, and the flavor permeated the whole steak.  Very good!
