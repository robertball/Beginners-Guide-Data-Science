Love this recipe... I'm a midwesterner who married an Indian, so I'm always looking for recipes that make him call me his "Indian wife"-- this is one!  For our tastes, I double all the spices in the batter-- make the trip to the indian market, it's worth it.  I use whatever veg I have on hand (try carrots, spinach, broccoli, mushrooms), dice them small, and add the whole lot to the batter and stir.  Then drop by tablespoons into the hot oil.  Don't worry, they will form together into patties when they cook (or if they fall apart a little, they're so tasty no one will mind!), cook until they seem just a little overdone to make them good and crispy. They're not bad the second day, if they last, just a bit soggy. Reheat in the oven.

Yum! I took another user's advice and diced the vegetables and just mixed them with the batter. I fried them in about 1/2 inch of oil to prevent them from falling apart. The vegetables I used were spinach, potato, carrot, cauliflower, and onion. Thanks so much for sharing!

These were a big hit! The batter has a wonderful flavour, and they stay crunchy for a few hours. I'm not sure how well they keep past then, because they didn't last long enough to find out. I added broccoli, red pepper, grated carrot and zucchini to the cauliflower and onion, and the added vegetables worked wonderfully with the batter. They're best if allowed to cook until quite brown, almost overdone looking, and served fresh.

This recipe was quite tasty and authentic. I've made it twice now with only a few minor adjustments: 1 tsp chili powder for a bit more spice, 1 tsp garlic powder instead of cloves, and a handful of freshly chopped coriander. If you like it really spicy, you can also add a green chili or two. For the first round, I used slightly less cauliflower and added 1 large potato (cubed) to the mix. For the second round, I used potato & brocoli. Both variations tasted great! I mixed everything together in the batter and then dropped spoonfuls of mixture into the oil. (Note: Pakora is usually a small cluster of fried veggies, but if they don't stick together, don't worry. It doesn't affect the taste at all!) My cook time was about 10-15 minutes per batch, but I don't use a deep-fryer, so perhaps the deep-fryer is a bit quicker. For a more traditional dipping sauce, try a mint chutney, but if you prefer to keep it simple, ranch dressing & ketchup work great too! These tasty little treats WILL disappear quickly, so doubling the recipe is a good idea! I made a single batch this evening, and hubby & I polished off the entire plate! Makes a great appetizer or snack food, and once you get the hang of it, you can whip this up in no time at all!

I have always loved Pakora's. They are my favorite indian appetizer and these were fabulous. I have never made these before and now I may never order them at a restaurant again.

This was a very simple, tasty pakora recipe. I would have suggested a little more spices, and especially salt. I made it with sliced potatoes and it was good. Make sure you get the oil very hot and cook each side for a good 2-3 minutes or the vegetables will not cook thouroughly.

i just made this for lunch, and it was excellent. i scaled this recipe to 1 serving, because all i had was a little bit of cauliflower left. i didn't have coriander, turmeric or any of the other spices, so i just substituted an equal amt of curry powder instead. anyway, i was a bit skeptical because i'm not a huge fan of cauliflower, but this was GREAT..i couldn't eat it fast enough, it was delicious!!

i cant really review the recipe, i just wanted to see how similiar it was to my own my family and i eat pakoras all the time esp during the month of ramadan and this is a good basic recipe...u can use any veggie but spinach and cauliflower are my favorites. also zucchini and potatoes grated work well( drain the moisture though). i cut up the veggies pretty small, and some onions green chiles, and cilantro mix it up and add the chickpea flour ....i dont measure. then i add water until it forms a batter that is consistent enough to drop into hot oil in spoonfuls. then i add garam masala and salt.

I will definitely make this again. These really were very easy to make.  I'm glad I listened to other reviewers who chopped the veggies into smaller bits and mixed them directly with the batter; that worked well. I also appreciated the tip to cook the pakoras until they look like they're a little overdone--they came out perfect that way. 

I wish I had heeded the reviewers who said to double the spices and salt. I felt the batter was a little bland; I would have liked some cumin in it. And for some reason, although I measured carefully, my batter was very thin. I wound up sifting quite a bit more chick pea flour over the batter/veggie mix and continuing to mix until I had the desired consistency. (Perhaps I should have added extra spices at this point). Overall, though, they came out great with my little adjustments, and I will tweak further next time by adding more spice.

I am an Indian and we make this. we do add some finely chopped green chillies (serrano), Chaat masala powder & no garam masala. For viggies - try cabbage (make some 2" pieces), Okra (slit and stuff the dry ingredients inside), tomato sliced up. once you take them out of the oil sprinkle some more chaat masala  -  YUM!!

Tastes authentic, like the Pakora my mom makes.  I add 35% more spice.  Favorites are sweet potato and califlower.

People tell me these taste just like the pakoras at our favorite Indian restaurant. Sometimes I dip the vegetables in egg before battering and frying to keep the batter from falling off in the pan. I've used a lot of different vegetables, fresh, canned, and frozen.  Battering and frying these can take a long time and make a big mess, but with practice, I don't have that problem anymore.

Good recipe. As a Scot living in America I really miss my Indian food and make it whenever I can. The great thing about Pakora is that you can make extra, just slightly undercooked, and freeze it. A minute or so in the fryer and it comes out tasting like you made it from scratch...I always make really huge batches that last for three or four meals...

Wow...I never had pakoras before, even in a restaurant.  This recipe was suggested to me through the recipe exchange when I was looking for Indian recipes for a dinner party I was planning.  These were so good, I served them with Tomato Chutney (recipe on allrecipes too).  I used half of a cauliflower, one onion, half a green pepper, and one small zucchini.  I had to double the batter and followed the recipe exactly, although the flower I used was Faina flower (chick pea and flour blend).  I cooked them in about 1 inch of veg oil like others suggested (and they stayed together) in large wok until golden.  I ended up cooking them a few hours before I served them and they did get a bit soggy, so they are best cooked and served right away.  I even tried crisping them up a bit in the oven but couldn´t get them back to their formal glory.  Regardless they were a hit and will definitely make again.

You can bake these in a hot oven using fry light. just make sure you turn them over after about ten minutes and spray them again. They come out nice and crispy. So all the taste and healthy too.

We live in Little India so we're used to authentic Indian food.  I made these tonight but used mixed veggies (cooked and cubed carrots, potatoes, cauliflower, peas, onion, spinach), put fresh cilantro and extra of all the spices into the batter and they were perfect!  My son said they're better than the ones they serve at the Indian hall he works at :)

These were good. Not sure if it was just the particular brand of chickpea flour I used, but it seemed coarser than what I have had at restaurants. As many others have stated, very adaptable. I subbed potato for cauliflower. Salt the batter to taste.

These are very good, and my husband said they tasted alot like what he had in India.  I look forward to trying this with other veggies.  Any suggestions how I can use the chickpea flour other than in this recipe?

Super easy to make and really delicious. I will double the spices next time as I like them with a little more kick.  I used cauliflower, carrots, and onion, and mixed my chopped veggies into the batter, then dropped by the spoonful into the oil.

I loved this recipe.  I also chopped my veggies and shallow fried them.  I used baby spinach, red onion, and cauliflower (that I had left over).  Came out better than our favorite local Indian restaurant!

Amazing! Just like at Star India! I took some others' advice and diced all the veggies, smothered in batter, and dropped by the spoonful. I fried them until extra crispy and served them with ranch and ketchup so my picky eaters would try them. Gobbled them up! My 2 year old loved them even! Now I just need the yogurt sauce and mint sauce recipes... ;-)

This is one of those messy recipes. I cooked it in a deep fryer outside in the summer to eliminate the odor inside the house. It was very delicious though. I also used eggplant and broccoli. Definitely a keeper.

Perfect I uses shredded carrots, zucchini, thinly sliced onion and sliced and chopped cauliflower. Over cooked looked is key! Such a good recipe! Served with a mint chutney and a tamarid one. Left overs are great for lunch.

Add a pinch of baking soda to the recipe and they will become extra light and crunchy. You can also make these with only potato slices dipped in the batter and then fried. You could also add whole cumin seeds for extra flavour. Yummy!!!

I've made this recipe a half-dozen times in different ways, and there doesn't seem to be a way to go wrong!  My favorite combo is do do a mix of chopped spinach with finely diced potato, cauliflower and onion (thawed frozen veggies work just fine too).  Add more chili powder or a bit of cayenne if you're in the mood for something spicier, but the base recipe itself is solid.  The hardest part is probably waiting to make sure the pakoras stay in the pan long enough to get super crispy, because they're so good that no one wants to wait to eat more!

I made these last week with a Middle Eastern inspired dinner that I was making and they turned out great!  I followed the recipe for the batter as written, however I used regular A/P flour as that's all that I had on hand.  I also used garlic powder rather than fresh garlic, and after reading some reviews I added 1/2tsp of cumin to the batter as well.  I ended up having to add about 1c of water to the batter, but I think that's probably because of the A/P flour.  I had a bag of frozen mixed veggies that I needed to use up, so that's what I used rather than onions and cauliflower. I thawed the veggies in the micro and drained them, then added them directly to the batter and mixed it all together.  I fried them in veg oil on the stove top in small batches.  They held together really nicely and barely broke apart at all while they were cooking.  I cooked them until they were a nice golden brown and they turned out wonderful!  Very good flavor, chewy, crunchy, and a great addition to the other parts of the meal.  I made a yogurt cilantro sauce for dipping which complimented these very nicely (4tbsp plain yogurt, 1tbsp sour cream, a few dashed of hot sauce, a few dashes of chili powder, 1tbsp dried cilantro, refrigerate for a few mins to let flavors meld).  Great recipe and I will definitely be making this again!

This was good, but I didn't think it was superb so I'm not going to make it again.  My two dinner companions liked it much better than I did, however.  I've never had pakoras, so I don't know if these are authentic or not.  Double all the spices as other reviewers suggested.  Also, chopping up the onions and veggies, mixing them in the batter, and then scooping them into the pan worked just fine.  I used coconut oil and they cooked only 1-2 minutes each side.  This is a good use for frozen veggies.   I used broccoli, cauliflower, onion.  I didn't have chickpea flour so I substituted regular flour.

I followed other advice and julienned/chopped veggies - potatoes, carrot, onion, broccoli and cauliflower - and threw those into the batter mix and stirred it up. I dropped the whole thing by spoonfuls into the hot oil, and when they didn't hold together that great, I added just a bit more flour to the mix. Very yummy.

I think it needs baking powder.  I would also double the spices and season the veggies before battering.

Delicious! I was happy to find this recipe after enjoying deep -fried yams with an Indian restaurant meal. I doubled the spices (not the salt), used broccoli and cauliflower because that's what I had on hand, and these were excellent. Easy, too! Thanks for a great recipe!

Good. I did add an egg to the batter and felt that was a better coating consistency. I also used garlic powder instead and paprika instead of red chili powder.

Added 1/2 tsp of cumin, fenugreek, ginger and ajwain. Replaced garlic cloves with 1/2 tsp garlic powder. Used spinach, one small finely diced onion and two cooked potatoes, also finely diced, for vegetables. Crispy fried in peanut oil and utterly addictive.

This is a great batter recipe! I think next time I will dice the vegetables as others have suggested, but the flavor is awesome. I think I'll use more chili next time as well, but I will definitely be making this a lot. Even my daughter loved these and she's so picky. Thanks for sharing this recipe!!!

This was an easy to follow recipe producing a very tasty appetizer or snack. There is just the right hint of spice. To kick it up a notch I am planning to double the spices in the next batch.

Excellent recipe. Loved the flavor. Would have liked a little more heat next time. Next time, I'll probably at 1 tsp of garam masala and maybe 1/2 tsp curry. Other recipes I read said to let the batter sit for 20 minutes, so I did that.

Wow, these are actually better than the ones I've had at restaurants! I took the advice of others and just mixed the veggies into the batter. I also added shredded carrots, frozen spinach, and potatoes (boiled, peeled, and chopped). I used a cookie scoop to scoop the mixture into the hot oil. Tastes awesome with ranch dressing!

This good. I have several pakora recipes from different books but this has been the best thus far. I added diced potatoes to the mix and chopped the cauliflower and onions to smaller pieces. Mixed everything up and dropped by spoonfuls into the hot oil. Great pakora recipe.

Surprisingly good, wasn't expecting to get Indian dish from Allrecipes website.  But, this is pretty close to real pakora. I used mostly thinly sliced potatoes and Onions.

This is one of the easiest and best recipes I've ever made! I've cooked these pakoras for several guests now and they never last more than a few minutes. The only downside is that they don't store well. After a while they get soggy left out or in the fridge. :( But I'd still be interested in using this basic recipe to act as a good base for more involved ones.

These were amazing. I grated carrots and zucchini, chopped onion, red pepper and parsnip.  I mixed it with the flour and water batter and droped by spoonsful into the hot oil. The seasonsings in the recipe were delicious - didn't change anything.  Great flavour, easy to make, definitely a keeper! Thanks veggigoddess.

This is a great recipe! I have made this twice now,I altered the recipe slightly by using a little less water, and it was warm water, also, for chicken pakora, i added a little tomato puree for a red colour for the batter, and i didn't have the oil as hot, adults and kids couldn't get enough!!

This was delicious, even my picky three year-old loved it (I pureed hers before frying it)!  My suggestion is to use quality spices, I used Penzey spices and everything turned out amazing, full of flavor.

these were pretty good -- could've used more spice, i thought. i'm going to play with different vegetables next time; i tried cauliflower, onion, and broccoli, the last of which i didn't much care for. i found the batter stuck to the veggies really well.

I made these with cauliflower, potato (diced small) and onion (also diced). They were good but definitely could have used more spice. I'll be making them again. Thanks, Karla!

Good stuff!  I'll add a bit more of the spices next time and try other veggies as well.  I used a bit of garlic powder instead of cloves, as previously suggested.  I was concerned about the consistency of the "batter", so I added more water (1/2 cup?) to make it more batter-y and it worked great.  Now that I see the suggestion that pakoras are supposed to be little clumps of veggies instead of individual fritter-type things, I see where the thicker batter makes sense.  I think I'll still do it my way though :)

These were amazing!! 
I chopped up veggies and mixed them into the batter as suggested. They did not fall apart. They were a wonderful light flavor and tasted great without mint chutney to dip them in! 
I did not have any coriander so I subbed a combo of cumin and curry powder *

Really tasty.. I also doubled up the spices, mainly because mine aren't the freshest... I over did the veg, put far too much in, so didn't think they'd hold together... they did, were very veggie, and delicious... Thank you VeggieGoddess for the recipe...

They were good, I used both chili and cayenne and fried in ghee. For vegetables I used sweet potato and thin sliced, quartered onion. Makes a delicious gluten free side for soup.

I took the advice of others and doubled all the spices. I also didn't have any chickpea flour handy, so I used all purpose flour, which I knew would change the texture. It was, as expected, a little chewier than the original recipe would likely have been but the flavour was spot on! I put in frozen spinach (thawed and squeezed), diced mushrooms and onions, as that's all I had available when the craving hit. I will have to go pick up some chickpea flour and give this another go.

I couldn't wait and made these again the following day but this time with chickpea flour. Amazing! This time I added spinach and shredded carrots. I'll be making these again.

You can't just use regular flour (wheat) for this recipe as someone did.  It is essential to use chickpea flour (legume).  The flavor and the results come out completely different.  Some recipes you can make substitutions, generally not with Indian food. I also suggest a good cilantro dipping sauce for these.   I love pakora but I must have the cilantro sauce.

I love these Pakoras.  Really nice flavours, and a very easy recipe. I made them exactly as directed the first time and everyone enjoyed them. Next time I plan to try diced potatoes, spinach and onions together.  Yum!!

I read the reviews  doubled the spices (watch the salt) also added curry powder and extra veggies. This recipe is a good, it just needs to be tweaked to your own taste. Its nice to change it up now and then.

These things are delicious! But the proportions for the batter are definitely off; I haven't finished adding all the water when I realized the batter was already too runny and had to add more chickpea flour instead. Start with half a cup of water and see if you need to add more. The batter is quite flavorful and the pakoras lie heavy in your stomach, so pair them with some light chutney (e.g. mint) or yogurt-based dip to balance the spicy flavors.

Made this tonight as a last minute substitution for our monthly supper club.  I followed the other users advice of doubling the spices (except for salt) and chopping the veg up small. I used cauliflower, zucchini, red bell pepper, carrots and onion. Fantastic, easy to cook and it got rave reviews. I will make this again.

Great recipe!  I made chickpea flour using my vitamix (Sifted it to make sure it was smooth).  I only had coriander seeds so I had to grind that up in blender too.  I like to follow the recipes exact whenever possible but I couldn't go out so I made do.  I used curry powder instead of straight turmeric and I didn't have any garam masala.  I used frozen cauliflower, carrots, and broccoli.  I fried them in peanut oil. They were delicious.  My husband did say they were missing a little something, but I am guessing that is the fault of leaving out the masala so I still gave the recipe 5*s

I had to adjust the spices for my taste, I needed much more. I chopped carrot, cooked spinach, cauliflower, peas & corn and onion. I found an Indian Pakora dipping sauce at the grocery store and it all came together fantastically. They got raves at my party.

I thought that the batter did not hold on to the cauliflower very well, but the flavor was good.
