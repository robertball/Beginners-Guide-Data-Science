I cut this recipe back by half. I threw all the ingredients into large Ball Jar, slapped a lid on it and had my kid shake it until it was uniform in color. We all had a mug of this tonight--my kids thought it was good, my husband and I thought it was a little too milky, not enough chocolate. I am going to try to fiddle with it and see if adding more baking cocoa makes a difference. If I made this recipe again, I would cut back a bit on the nonfat milk powder.

This is really good!  I made it 2 ways:  Method 1 Exactly as called-for in the recipe- creamy and delicious but not too sweet. it was just right.  Method 2.  I used the base recipe, but added a small pinch of cayenne to the mug and stirred well.  The added zip of flavor made it special.

I deliberately chose a fairly plain recipe so that I could "dress it up" occasionally.  Yummy both ways!

This was good. I would scale back on the milk for a richer flavour. I added some hot pepper powder on top to give it a kick. When putting this together the powders make a pretty presentation. Definitely a gift idea.
