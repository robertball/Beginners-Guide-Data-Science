I've tried quite a few glazes but this one really is a hit!  Who knew that some rum, sweet stuff and mustardy zing would produce such an outstanding ham.  A must try.

My family and I love this glaze.  The flavor is more mildly sweet than a lot of other recipes, and the mustard and cider balance it out really well.

Someone said that the molasses was overpowering, if you make sure to simmer at least 8-10 minutes it sort of mellows it out, and helps make sure the flavors all combine well.

That was my first attempt at baking a ham and it was so deliceous I am going to send the recipe to friends for the holidays.  I was short on time, so I cut the 5lb bone in ham in half (as best I could) and layed each half down in the baking dish with the fatty layer on top, cutting criss-crosses in the top layer. I cooked it for a little over two hours and it was so good I can't wait to share it with guests next time.

I liked the ingredients in this so decided to try it.  Having read the other reviews, I reduced the amount of molasses by about a third and added a couple of shakes of worchestershire to add to the savory profile.  It came out very nice and we enjoyed the flavor.  It didn't thicken as much as I thought it would but that was a minor issue.

I used this recipe to make the glaze for my Easter Ham and it was outstanding! I did not have any spicy mustard so I just mixed together a little regular, yellow mustard with a smidgen of cayenne pepper. I substituted red wine vinegar for the cider vinegar as that's all I had in my pantry and that worked out just fine. I was also able to cut the recipe in half since I was only making a small ham. It did require a lot of stirring to get rid of the clumps of mustard and brown sugar that formed but other than that it was quite simple and easy. The glaze had an apple-like flavor and was somewhat smokey with just a little bit of spiciness. It was very tasty indeed! I was able to take the glaze that pooled up around the bottom of the ham in the roasting pan, pour it into a small dish and use it a as nice sauce to dip the pieces of ham on my fork in. It complemented the ham beautifully! Delicious! A very good recipe. I highly recommend it.

I really enjoyed this glaze. It was the first time I ever baked a ham and it came out great! I didn't have rum so I substituted bourbon. Was delicious! I will definitely use this recipe again.

I followed the directions accordingly, I doubled all ingredients so I had plenty for leftovers. I did add orange zest about 1/2 a teaspoon and I added 3 TBS of apricot preserves( end of a jar I had sitting in the refrigerator). It had just a touch of that orange taste that I like. Tasty and flavorful, complements from picky eaters, easy to prepare. Thanks

Last night, as I was finishing preparations on what would have doubtless been a fairly boring meal of mashed potatoes, green beans and ham, I decided to make a last-minute glaze for the ham. I picked this glaze and it came together in about ten minutes. I warned the boys that it might be "weird", but after a few bites we all poured it over everything on our plates and had seconds on the ham. I thought it was a little overly molasses-y when I tried it by itself, but once it was on the ham I thought it was great. I'll make this again.
