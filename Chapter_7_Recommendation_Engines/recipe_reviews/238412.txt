This was perfect! And I never use my slow cooker without the Reynolds liners! A 'must have' in my kitchen! This stew has tender beef chunks bathing in a Mexican style broth...yum! Very hearty and satisfying! I made it as written except I doubled the garlic because I'm a garlic lover! I think next time I'll also double the beef because I found myself wanting more. I topped mine with green onions and shredded cheddar cheese. I served it with a mound of white rice in the center of each bowl, as you can see in my photo. I will definitely be making this again!

A comforting stew with a zing. I only used 1/2 tsp. of New Mexico Chili powder because it is so hot. I did make a roux so the stew was thicker. Melt 3 Tbsp. of butter in a pan on medium heat. Add 3 Tbsp. of flour. Stir and cook at least five minutes. Add beef broth slowly to the roux while stirring. It should immediately begin to thicken. Bring to a simmer while stirring to avoid lumps. Add to stew and stir. Cook for at least 5-10 minutes until incorporated.The bread bowl was the perfect way to eat this stew! I used the Reynolds liners which makes it a breeze to clean up.

Love this recipe. I made this in my pressure cooker. I always sub beef bouillon instead of broth and omit salt.  I added a tablespoon of diced chipotle peppers which added just the right zing without being too spicy. Also used way more carrots than 2.  Love the sweet carrots with the spicy beef.

I didn't brown the meat, just dumped it in the crock with a little flour.  I used fire roasted tomatoes.  The family liked it!

Made the recipe just the way it said, and it was a hit. The only thing I might do is add a vegetable or 2 more. I also served it with some Spanish  rice in the bowl.

Excellent!!  This is a restaurant quality recipe.  I doubled the recipe plus used extra pot roast.  It cooked overnight for 8 hours on low then I put it in the fridge in the morning.  At dinner time I drained the juice into a measuring cup.  I made a roux with butter and flour then added the juice to make a delicious gravy.  There is probably an easier way but gravy intimidates me so I made it the sure-fire way.  I added the meat, etc. back in to reheat. Next time I will add a bit more heat and extra carrots. I served it over white rice with a layered Mexican dip and tortilla chips.

Tasted ok, but it seemed to be missing something. Next time I think I'll add Taco seasoning instead of chili powder along with jalapeños.

Decent, needs more flavor. I'd probably add garlic powder and a few dashes of cayenne pepper next go around.

Next time I will definitely use some crushed red pepper like recipe suggested. Not a lot, just a little. I used 1/2 more stew meat and glad I did. You can always add more veggies if you want, I know I did. I also deglazed my frying pan with the beef broth so I wouldn't lose any flavor. Also, using that liner meant I didn't have to wash out my slow cooker!  Holla!!!!!

This was was excellent! We all enjoyed it and next time I will double the recipe because it went fast. The slow cooker liners make for easy clean up which is awesome! (I topped my serving of stew with shredded cheese, sliced green onion and Sriracha and oh my goodness it was gooood!)

Interesting cross between stew and chili, and a very nice combination of flavors. I did use the Mexican style tomatoes with green chiles, for a little extra south-of-the-border zing, and I doubled the garlic (because, ummm... GARLIC!). Other than that, I followed the recipe and liked the result. Next time I think I'll up the broth a little and add some potatoes, and I'll make sure my fresh cilantro is still good.

Easy recipe and has good flavor.  I did add twice the amount of carrots and corn and 1 seeded jalapeño.  At about half way through cooking I found a half can of Rotel's in the fridge I needed to use and threw that in on top.  My husband likes spicy food, but it would have been good even without it.    Thanks for sharing.

This recipe is such a fun take on the traditional beef stew. It has just enough heat to warm your cheeks but not so spicy you're running for a glass of water (unless you put in red pepper flakes). I added an extra cup of broth and used fresh green beans and fresh corn.  We had three meals (for 2 people) with the amount of stew this recipe made. I will be making this again!

Nice variation on the tortilla soup we make a lot.  This uses stew meat, which I am frequently looking for new recipes to use up my stew meat I get when we buy a 1/4 beef.  Tasty, comforting soup and easy clean-up with the slow cooker liner.

Gave this a 3 at first because it doesn't taste great fresh out of the slow cooker.  Took it back to a 4 because it is delish as a leftover, especially with avocado on top.

This recipe was delicious!  The only thing I did differently was add about a half a cup of medium salsa and 3 sliced jalapeño peppers.  The only reason I did this is because hubby and I like a little more heat.  Definitely making again!

Substituted pinto beans for black, Pace Medium salsa for the diced tomatoes. Doubled the cumin and black pepper, and added potatoes. Quite tasty, but 7-8 hours on low leaves potatoes and carrots still a bit crunchy, so increase cooking time or do an hour or two on high setting instead of low.

Would do this one again.

Family really liked this dish. I did not pre-cook the meat, so didn't use any flour. Added some potatoes that needed to be used up. We need to be gluten-free so I used low-sodium GF beef bouillon instead of the broth. I made a double batch and froze half. It freezes well which is always a plus.

This was so delicious!  My husband and I made this together and we had almost two bowls each for dinner.  We have leftovers for tomorrow and we are looking forward to it.  My husband is crazy about this stew.  (I like it a lot, too!)  I can't wait to share this recipe with my sister, who is a fan of beef vegetable stew.  I think she'd love the Mexican version.  Thanks for the recipe.

It was okay. If I make this again I will add peppers or something else to give it more flavor. Flavor does improve after letting it sit for a night and reheating but still a little bland.

Call me a traditionalist, but I have to add potatoes and carrots. Everything else is the same. Awesome.

Excellent flavors.  My husband had a second helping.  I made it in my Instant Pot with the bones leftover from a 15 lb. prime rib that I had used to make stock.  So I used that meat, a quart of stock and an extra can of kidney beans.  Everything else remained as written.  Will definitely make it again.  Thanks for the yummy recipe.

It was very good. I did however reduce the amount of cumin from one tsp to a pinch because I am not a big fan of it. Ion fact in Mexico we don't use it as much) the rest left as is. Will make again!

This was so good. I made it with double the broth. Instead of stew meat are used ribeye steak. I cook the steak and left it on the side until almost ready to serve. I added the juice of half a lime... It was a big hit. I’ll definitely be making this again.

The stew was delicious for a cold rainy day! I used a can of Rotel so the canned tomatoes. Also instead of hamburger meat, diced beef ( my fave!) so the stew would not become mushy from overlooked hamburger meat.
Served it with jalapeño cornbread and suggested toppings.

Made this last night for supper and it was good. I did make some changes due to other reviews. I used 1 Tbsp cumin and chili powder, added 1 lb of mushrooms, around 1.5 cups water( it looked a little dry), and a 7 oz can of jalapenos. I also added a can of whole kernal corn at the beginning with everything else. The extra spices and jalapenos made it spicy but that is the way I like it. Cooked it on high for 5 hours

Reminds me of tortilla soup you get at Mexican restaurants (just need to add the tortillas). I skipped the avocado (this time) and added a little sour cream and shredded cheese.  So easy and tastes great.  Beef was quite tender after 7+ hours.

Delicious and easy, put it in the crockpot before work and when you get home the house smells great. I’ll probably add more tomatoes and a few jalapeños next time.

Loved it.  Didn’t have any chili powder so sub’d cayenne, paprika, oregano, cumin, and garlic. Really really good, but cayenne sneaks up on ya so work up to it if ya don’t like HOT!

This is a very simple, versatile and very good stew. I used a Dutch oven (not a slow cooker) and it was great.  I think that next time I’ll use a smaller cut/cube of meet (less than 1") as it would make the consistency more uniform.  We topped it with sour cream, green onions and tortilla chips and had leftovers for lunches. I would definitely make it again.

It was good but I doubled the recipe plus added some onion powder, paprika, oregano, Chipotle, and most importantly a tablespoon of dark chocolate cocoa.   I added that based on Lawrys taco seasoning ingredients.   That made a big difference!

This was okay. I made it as written except I did not add the beans due to food allergies. It does have good potential, though. I think it needs more seasoning. Not so much heat but more flavor. We topped it with fresh cilantro, avocado, green onions and cheddar cheese.

Absolutely the easiest, tastiest and guaranteed the best slow cooker recipe designed for the busy cook!  The recipe and companion grocery list saved me lots of time. I am a busy artist married to a hungry 6'5" carpenter; doing a-dinner-in-a-box is not an option.  I had to shop late in evening after work; the groceries were much easier to find with the tailor-made list. 

The Mexican Beef Stew slow cooker recipe is easy to adjust for a reduced-salt diet. Early the next morning I assembled the ingredients, turned on the pot and left for a day of painting. Arrived home to a delicious aroma and quickly fed a very hungry carpenter. There was enough food left-over after the first night that the second night we dished up the leftovers with side-salads.

Thank you, All Recipies for making it so easy to serve healthy and tasty food.

Fantastic!! I used taco seasoning instead of the chili powder as suggested, and 1 can of corn instead of the frozen corn because that's what I had on hand. I put it in the last 30 minutes. Will be making this again!!

While I enjoyed this, I was expecting a little more kick. it could be that my chili powder was stale,. I will try this again but as one user suggested substitute taco seasoning for the chili powder.

I altered the recipe just a bit.  I added 1 green and red pepper instead of the corn and carrot.  I also left out the broth and added a can of Rotel tomatoes instead. One more change was a teaspoon of Adobo.  It was perfect, love using stew meat instead of ground beef, it's like a stew.  Will make again and again!

I made it buuutt....... I made I waaay too hot!!!!  I tried draining all the juice out rinsing and refilling w/plain water and tomato paste. I tried cutting the heat with brown sugar. Eventually I just gave up and let the "Men" eat it. The next day when I reheated a bowl and added more cheese and avocado it was GREAT!!    I will be making this one of our staple meals but paying closer attention to measurements. Love it!????????

It was a home run. Husband and kids LOVED it. It really did not need all the beef broth. I only added about half a cup. I also added Kidney beans. Some nice bread and a side salad made this a full meal on a cold day.

It was very loose. Maybe omit some of the liquid. Cooked it 3 hrs on high then an additional 2 on low. Tasty but maybe more seasoning .

Great recipe! Made just as written except I added a green bell pepper, which was yummy, and didn't use a liner - really not necessary if you ask me! Oh and I used a mixture of beef and venison!

Quick to start in the morning before work, and delicious with a few tweaks at the end of a long day!
I basically followed the recipe, though I dumped in the can of black beans juice and all (I almost always do this in my recipes), I added one chopped yellow squash, and I used canned corn instead of frozen. It was enjoyed by all three of us!
And clean up was a breeze - thanks to Reynolds Slow Cooker Liners!! I'm now a fan!!
