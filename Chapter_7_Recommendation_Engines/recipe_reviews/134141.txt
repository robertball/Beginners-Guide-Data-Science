I'm sorry I'm from Louisiana (bayou counrty)and my mom NEVER put raisins in her beef stew. It just seems very odd to me to title this recipe "Louisiana Beef Stew" when I've been living in Louisiana my whole life and have never eaten a stew with raisins in it..

Sorry, this just did not work out for me. I found the stew to be too thick - and way too rich and dense. The flavors were really overpowering. It sounded interesting - but my family didn't care for it.

I did enjoy this stew very much.  It had a very nice flavour & is a change from an everyday stew.  I didn't use bacon drippings or raisins.  I really liked the sauce & stew poured over rice I prepared in a rice cooker.

Best pot roast recipe I've tried so far. I wasn't sure if it was a good idea, just perusing the ingredients, but it came out wonderful. My mom likened it to almost having bar-b-cue. HOWEVER - I didn't follow recipe to the letter. The biggest change I made? I used a crockpot. I pulled roast out of the freezer, browned it in a skillet while still frozen, and dumped it in the crockpot, then piled the ingredients on it. I didn't have red wine vinegar, so I used balsamic vinegar instead. It cooked for 7 hours or so, first few hours on high, then on low.

This stew did not work well for my family. It was too sweet, and leaves a weird aftertaste in my mouth. The only good thing I can say about it is that the thickness of the soup was nice.

Wow! This is the BEST stew ever!! I only had to make a couple of substitutions because of what I had on hand: added 3 small parsnips, less carrots, regular vinegar and red wine (combined to make the amount of Red wine Vinegar called for). Yum!

My family really enjoyed this. I didn't have bacon drippings and didn't want the extra fat, so I left them out. I thought it was still really good. Loved the raisins!

I did not care for this recipe. I thought it was a strangely spiced mix of onions, carrots and beef in a runny sauce.

It sounded too sweet so I didn't add the raisins and only used 1/3 cup molasses. It turned out well, still sweet but  a nice change from regular beef stew.  I think 1/2cp molasses would be way too sweet. You can also add some cayenne pepper for kick!
