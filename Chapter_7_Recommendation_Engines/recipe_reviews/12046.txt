This was delicious - really easy to make and everyone loved it. I made a few changes to the original. I added extra mushrooms, onion and garlic. I used a red pepper instead of green. I also added some basil with the pepper and salt and a little extra wine. I used sea scallops and garlic fettucini. This is a great recipe and we'll be making it again soon!

I served this at a dinner party and it was a huge hit!  I was nervous because I had never cooked scallops before, but they were great - just don't cook them longer than 3 - 4 minutes.  I used a yellow bell pepper instead of green and added a couple of chopped plum tomatoes.  The color looked great.  I also served a mix of scallops and shrimp.  Serve with a nice light salad.  Very tasty - I will definitely serve this again!

Very easy to make.  My boyfriend said it tasted better than most dishes you order at a restaurant, and he would be proud to serve it to any guests at our house.  This is one of the best recipes I have found so far, good combination of flavors.  I used red bell peppers instead of green and added a little more wine and less olive oil.  Will keep this and make it again and again!!

This was excellent.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I pan seared the scallops until golden brown seperatly in frying pan.  It was great, I will certainly make it again.

This recipe is great and very easy (and quick) to prepare. Even my boyfriend who is not a veggie or mushroom lover really enjoyed this dish. I only made a couple changes- I added a red pepper instead of green and only 10 oz. of pasta based on other reviews. It was perfect. I found the olive oil to be a little much so will cut back next time. We're big scallop fans so will also add more of those as well. Thanks for sharing. We'll definitely be making again!

Excellent dish!  Every plate was clean!  I didn't realize I was out of lemon juice, so I added some extra wine.  Toasted pine nuts and used red pepper as suggested.  Will keep and make again.

Great easy recipe.  I used scallops and shrimp and following others advice and used less pasta.  I also used some johnny's greek seasoning. This would be good with zucchini as well.

Very good - Without the scallops I bet kids would love it - It takes about 1/2 hr to 3/4 hr to prepare and cook - serve with a salad and bread

Easy and delicious.  I thought two tablespoons of lemon juice was going to be too much so I only added one.  It turned out that it was a little bit bland so we added more lemon at the table.  This is a fabulous recipe and really needs no modification.  The entire family loved it.

Superb!!  Had boneless chicken breasts and made it with them.  Husband is on dialysis and a very strict diet so no mushrooms and he can't eat peppers, but everything else was within his allowance.  He loved it.  I added some lemon zest and fresh parsley and basil when I mixed it together.  Awsome!  Thank you for such a great idea.

Lovely! Switched red pepper for green, forgot lemon, added a few shrimp and yellow zucchini. Did linguine instead of fettuccine. Be careful using whole wheat pasta, it is a much stronger taste. That said, I used a bunch of the pasta water to thin out the homemade pesto instead of oil. Tasty, easy, delicious.

I've been making this for the last year and we have it frequently.  It is very yummy.  I use shrimp instead of scallops since my family doesn't like them and will usually omit the peppers.  Even better as leftover!

This was quite tasty and easy enough. I happened to have almost all the ingredients on hand...I used a thin, whole-wheat spaghetti instead of fettucine because that's what I had. I think it enhanced the dish! I will definitely make again.

I was impressed with how much flavor I got out of just these few simple ingredients.  I always make the recipe "as-written" the first time, and I would not make any changes.  It was delicious, light, and healthy, even with the linguini, which we personally served in half portions.  I like more sauce, so added more pesto, but this is simply a personal preference. Overall -- excellent as-is, simple, healthy!

My husband and I love this meal.  I make my own pesto.  I omit the peppers because husband doesn't like them.  I added sun dried tomatoes which I slice into thin strips and then add at the end.

This was just okay for me, but I did change some things so my kids would eat it, so it probably was better with the bell papper, white wine and mushrooms added.

YUMMY!  This was a very flavorful dish which my husband and I truly enjoyed.  I made the recipe as stated with the exception of using a red pepper and using a 7 ounce container of pesto.  We are pesto fans in this house.  Will definitely make again.

This one is going in my recipe folder.  I also used my own home grown basil for pesto following another recipe from this site.  I used a yellow pepper, substituted shrimp for the scallops and unfortunately had to use canned mushrooms because those were the ingredients that I had on hand. The taste was still divine, even taking into account the canned mushrooms.

YUMMY!!! I made it vegetarian... so no scallops, but instead used portobello mushrooms in its place.  I didn't have a green bell pepper, so I used a red.  Also, I made it with the "easy pesto" from this site and it was 100 stars good!  I don't think I'll make it again though because I wont fit in my pants if I do! :)

This was GREAT!! My husband really thought he wouldn't like this as he was smelling and watching me cook but after he had the first bite, he was addicted. I did add a few things like extra garlic and onion because we are very fond of those. This recipe is definitely a keeper. :-)

This gets ***** on the ease factor alone!  I didn't have any mushrooms but it tasted great anyway.  Definately will make again.

Thank you for your great recipe.  I, of course, did not see a reason to change your recipe at all.  The only thing was I LOVE spinach fettucini so I made it with that.  It turned out AWESOME!!

Awesome recipe!! I cut back a bit on the olive oil I put on the pasta and didn't use any green peppers but added extra mushrooms and a little red pepper flakes. Also, used shrimp instead of scallops. This might make it to the top of my favorite pasta dishes list!! Yummers!!

why waste the scallops?  can't taste them under the pesto & peppers anyway.  used cubes of bread instead, to deliver the interesting melange of flavors.

Delicious! However I usually end up adding more vegetables and pesto and less pasta than the recipe calls for. The first time I made it just seemed like there was a lot of pasta and not enough veggies. It's a great recipe though - easy to make and so yummy!

My fiance was given 2 lbs. of scallops (frozen) by a friend, so we made a double recipe.  Wow!!  I don't consider myself a good cook, but this recipe was so easy, I even impressed myself!  The key is to not overcook the scallops.  Test them after a couple of minutes.  It was delicious!!!  Good thing, cuz we have LOTS left over!!

This was really easy.  I used red pepper pesto and sea scallops and it turned out pretty good.  The next time I'll use more spices, my husband thought it was a little bland.

YUMMMM! This was my first time making this and it is so delicious. I followed this recipe exact, just omitted the bell pepper & mushroom to keep it simple. My boyfriend enjoyed it just as much & he cannot wait for me to make it again. Thanks for sharing a great recipe :)

Thought I would try this out. I am usually more a fan of creamy pasta dishes, but this was really good. I also replaced the green peppers with red only because my husband doesn't like green peppers. Will definitely cook it again.

OMG!  My family loved this recipe.  The kids however picked out the scallops but I made it again replacing the scallops with shrimps and they at it.  It's quick and easy and I made my own fresh pesto using the basil from my garden...even better..Yum!

This recipe is delicious, easy and quick to make. I used a red pepper, white and shitake mushrooms, 3TB of wine, and added shrimps to the scallops. All the rest was the same as original recipe. I can't wait to make it again.

My husband was RAVING about this dish, I thought it needed a bit more garlic. I added scallops and shrimp--it could use more seafood and vegies but I will be making it again.

I made this to use some scallops that were in the freezer before we move. The only change I made was to use 1/2 green pepper and 1/2 red pepper for colour - and to use up more stuff before we move. It was definitely a hit - my husband ate 2 big helpings! A 'keeper' recipe for sure.

Used extra lemon juice to use up the lemon.  Also added some extra wine to balance it out, but it turned out a bit lemony.  I won't overdo the lemon next time.  It was absolutely delicious.  I will definitely use this recipe again.

I made this recipe with shrimp instead of scallops, and it was delicious.  I also added some extra pine nuts.  The freshly shredded parmesean on the top really finished the recipe off!

A definate five stars!  I have made this dish time and time again for my family and they all love it, down to the pickiest eatter.  I didn't tell my kids it was sea food because one of them thinks she doesn't like sea food so she thought it was chicken and ate it all up.  I usually add more mushrooms only because we are mushroom lovers.  Thanks for the great recipe Nancy and Terry!

I found this recipe fairly quick and easy to make - from reading the recipe to on the table in under 1/2 hour. I changed a few ingredieents. I used a garlic and parsley fusilli instead, used red bell pepper instead of green and garnished it with toasted pine nuts. Very tasty. Adding fresh basil or parsely would also add a nice touch.

I  used a red pepper and did not add mushrooms as I did not haved any on hand. Also no cheese and I used a vegan pesto. It came out great and was delicious. Will make again with mushrooms and perhaps a lactose free cheese.  Quick and easy meal. Thanks for the recipe.

Loved this dish. Of course the quality of the scallops is key.   No changes except red bell peppers and used a container of pre made pesto which was almost a cup. It didn’t need the oil on the pasta with the store bought pesto.  It did need more mushrooms and my favorite pasta - linguine.  Best dish I’ve had in a long time.   Thanks for the recipe!

Looks and tastes great.  Used cavatappi instead of fettuccine, and a bit more pesto.  Oh, and a minced jalapeño as well :) .

This was delicious! I just made a few tweaks. I eliminated the onions, used a red pepper instead of green, 6 cloves of garlic, 8 oz. mushrooms, and just a little more pesto than what the recipe called for. I would probably use 16 oz. of mushrooms next time  & even a little more red pepper.

Super delicious and easy to make! My husband is not it was huge seafood fan but he left this. The first time I made it I thought the directions exactly and it turned out amazing, I’m going to try to make it again tonight and some tomatoes and spinach because I have tenants coming from the garden right now and I think it would be a nice touch. Thanks for this awesome yesterday!

I made just how the recipe stated. Very good, but I thought it needed just a little more salt or some other seasoning.

Another big hit.  I  substituted the bell peppers and onions with roasted red peppers and sundried tomatoes; tripled the wine and lemon juice - voila!  amazing quick and healthy meal.

I made this and just added a few things, I used garlic salt with the pepper. Extra white wine and lemon as I added more veggies. I had cherry tomatoes, mushrooms, and asparagus. Delicious flavor, super simple, the scallops cooking in the sauce made them so delicious!!

Excellent recipe.  I have made it twice.  The first time following the recipes exactly and my family thought it was great.  The second time I fried 6 slices of bacon and seared the scallops in the bacon grease.  I also increased the pesto to 1/2 cup and decreased the pasta to about 3/4 of a lb.  It was amazing!

This was delicious and I will definitely make again.   I made it with green pepper, as the recipe calls for, however would prefer the sweetness a red pepper would impart.  Like another reviewer,  I seared the scallops separately in butter, rather than have them poach in the liquid.  Also, I used a bit more pesto than called for and omitted adding oil to the fettuccini.  I also reduced the amount of pasta.  I found this made 3 good size servings.  Sounds like I made a lot of changes, but they were all pretty minor ones.

Delicious and a hit with both my husband and I. I'd only recommend doubling the pesto and using a little less pasta. But even as is, it's amazing.

This recipe was great, however, I made some changes. First, I switched out sea scallops for 1/2 lb. bay scallops and 1/2 lb. shrimp. I also used 1 orange pepper thinly sliced as well as about 1 cup of roughly sliced Baby Bella mushrooms for extra earthiness. Vidalia onion also gives this dish a wonderful caramelized flavor. Because of the added texture of the shrimp I decided on linguine as a substitute for fettuccini, still solid in texture but not overly prominent in the mouth. Tossed with the pesto this dish was deliciously light in flavor but stayed true to being a hearty Sunday dinner. I will definitely make this dish again and highly recommend you to try it, but not to be afraid to make it your own.

I used small portobello mushrooms and red onion. I used linguini in place of fettuccine and I tossed in some pine nuts. Quick, easy and DELICIOUS!

This is by FAR one of the BEST recipes I have ever made! I have made it twice, once with small scallops, and once with big scallops, we prefer the big scallops. About the only change I made was to saute the onion and scallops for the same amount of time. I prefer my onions to be slightly undercooked, too preserve more of the flavor. I also used a red bell pepper, it just adds some color.

Fabulous! Fresh scallops, homemade fettucini and homemade pesto made this a truly remarkable meal! Extra wine, a little more lemon juice and diced red bell pepper (for colour) were the only changes. We made enough so that there were leftovers for another meal for my wife and I. We'll definitely do this one again!

This was a great recipe, I substitute the pasta with cooked spaghetti squash (without adding the olive oil) and used about 3/4 cup of pesto for a two pound squash.  Since I didn't have scallops at home so I used shrimp instead, and used about 1/4 tsp of Old Bay seasoning for taste.  My husband had three servings and even took it to work for lunch the next day!  Thank you for the receipe!!
