Pretty good cheesecake, but not amazing.  Made it according to the recipe, but added a little sugar to the frozen blueberries which made it less tart.

I thought this was fantastic! Easy to make and hard to mess up, right up my alley. I did, however, add about a tsp of sugar to the pureed blueberries to counteract the tartness. =]
