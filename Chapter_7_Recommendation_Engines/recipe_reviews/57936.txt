This was kind of less good than I expected.  I don't know what I thought would happen when I dumped blue cheese dressing over broccoli and tomatoes, magic I guess.  Instead I had broccoli and tomatoes with blue cheese dressing.  Nobody really said anything at the table, which is usually a bad thing.

This was just a little bit blah. I would have to do some serious adding to this salad to do it again! Thanks anyway!

I think this would have been better with uncooked broccoli.
