I made these for a New Year's eve party and they disappeared quickly. I followed the hints of some previous reviewers and baked them for a total of 45 minutes, turning them over after the first 20 min. Also, I made the sauce using egual parts of mayo, Heinz chili sauce and brown sugar, then added about l Tbsp. of hot pepper sauce for some zing.... very delicious!

Holy cow!  I, too, thought this was a strange combination of ingredients.  After one taste, though, I can see why this one has such great reviews!  I took these to an appetizer party last night and they were gone almost instantly.  I followed what others did and used a whole waterchestnut (2 cans) to 1/2 a slice of bacon (1 lb).  I cooked for 45 minutes to get them crispy and turned the midway to allow even browning.  I poked toothpicks after cooking so everyone would have an easy time dipping into the sauce and am glad I did.  This one is a keeper!

These went over really well at my birthday party.  I cut the bacon into thirds and wrapped them around a halved chestnut.  I made them one day in advance. First,I baked them on a broiling pan for about 30 minutes and then turned on the broiler for about 10 minutes to ensure they turned out crispy.  I let cool and then tossed them in the sauce.  I refridgerated until 30 minutes before I was expecting company,  popped them in a 350 oven for about 25 minutes and served hot.

If I could give this one more than five stars...I would. They were incredible! I kind of hesitated as to making it at first as to the combination of the ingredients of the sauce but I am so, so glad that I decided to. This will definitely be on the top of my list to bring to the first barbecue of the year but I know that I will be making them again even before then....many times I am sure. Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

This recipe is good and is great microwaved (yes, bacon gets crisped in a microwave!)  I had to make this at work in the middle of the day so I didn't have any other options but this is the only way I'll make it from now on.  I wrapped 1/2 slice bacon around the chestnuts and secured with a toothpick, then placed 5 on doubled up paper towels on a paper plate and microwaved it for a minute.  This half cooked them.  Then I refrigerated and brought it in the next day.  Microwaving for another minute did the trick - they were crispy and hot.  The only thing I don't like about this recipe is that the sauce is enough for 4x the number of chestnuts in this recipe.  Definitely half or quarter this sauce and you'll still have plenty.  Beware the grocery store branded chili sauce - this is just cloaked cocktail sauce, not chili sauce!

I'm not a water chestnut fan, but I made these for a reception and they were a HIT!  So simple...and so good.  I didn't have one left.  I used two cans of whole chestnuts and 1 lb. of bacon...using half a slice of bacon for each chestnut...secured by a toothpick (soaked in water to keep from burning) through the middle.  GREAT appetizer!

These were pretty good, the sauce helped their natural flavor really stand out. I used a wire rack set inside a shallow cookie sheet lined with tin foil to keep the little rolls out of puddles of grease as they cooked. Two things I would have changed: 1 turned them over halfway through cooking, 2 kept them in the oven longer. It seemed they didn't turn out as crispy as I wanted my bacon to be- but no one was patient enough for me to put them back in the oven.

I made these a long time ago, but never reviewed them. I made them solely on the basis of the reviews, because the recipe looked pretty uninspiring to me. They were fantastic. As unappealing as that sauce sounds, it tasted fantastic. This is a very nice little appetizer. They were a little time consuming to make, and I doubled the waterchestnuts so I wouldn't have to halve them. I don't know if the brand I bought was particularly small, but I wouldn't have wanted them cut in half.

Very good recipe. I made them for a party, a double batch and they were all gone half way thru the party. I questioned the 1/4 c. hot suace but it was great!

I made these on Thanksgiving.  They were very easy. A couple of things, they definitely need to cook longer than the recipe calls for.  It's difficult cleaning the baking dish (as if I didn't have enough dishes to clean that night!)Next time I will use foil. Definitely use whole chestnuts. And as one user said, BEWARE, these are NUCLEAR straight out of the oven. I had to leave them in the kitchen for a bit before bringing them out because I was afraid someone wouldn't get the message that they were very hot. Took quite some time before even I could taste one. The sauce was good, but for some reason i was turned off by the color.  I will definitely add the hotter chili sauce next time.
Update:  Made these again for a small party.  I followed the recipe exactly and I still say they take much longer than stated.  This time I added 1 TBSP sirachi sauce and they were better than without.  I cannot emphasize enough how HOT these are coming out of the oven. You cannot immediately serve. Also the bacon cools quicker than the water chestnut.  So when you think they're ok temp wise, the chestnut is still holding the heat! Also, because I wasn't as busy as I was on Thanksgiving, I did not use foil but could at least soak the baking dish right away so the cleanup wasn't as bad. One other thing, one 8 oz can has 16 chestnuts.  Not alot, keep it in mind.  Most people will eat at least two. I found they are different and enjoyed by all.

Loves these! I've made them many, many times for parties and they always disappear very quickly. I use a whole water chestnut to a 1/3 of a strip of bacon. I bake for 25 minutes, flip, bake for 20 minutes, add sauce, and bake for 30 more minutes. This gets the bacon nice and crispy and the sauce has a great carmelization. Thanks :)

If we have a party and I don't make these I am questioned the whole night.."where are the bacon chestnuts?"  I did change a couple of things...first of all I use a thin sliced hickory bacon.  I take the bacon package and cut it into thirds, then use 2 cans of chestnuts (trust me there will NOT be any left over!)  By slicing the bacon in thirds and using a thin slice of bacon it wraps easier and cooks better.  Check your cooking time as I usually keep mine in the oven for 30-45 minutes.  I like my bacon CRISP!  I do NOT pour the suace over the bacon chestnuts and cook for an additional 30 minutes.  I leave the sauce as a side item (ever watch When Harry met Sally?) for dipping if they choose to. Not need to double the sauce as it makes plenty as is.

My family has deemed it mandatory that we make these every Christmas Eve (family potluck).  Keep them warm by wrapping in foil and setting it in slow cooker.

I wanted to test these out before making them for my parents' Christmas party this year.  All I've got to say is WOW!  These are going to go fast.

I used 2 cans of whole water chestnuts and a 16 oz. package of bacon was more than enough.  I didn't find that it was necessary to pre-cook the bacon.  I cut the bacon strips into thirds and did not halve the chestnuts.  I found that this created the perfect bacon to chestnut ratio.

I baked them for a total of 45 minutes on the high rack in my oven, turning them over and "sauce-ing" them halfway through.  They came out perfectly crispy with a nice caramelized glaze.  I served any leftover sauce on the side for dipping.

I didn't use a tomato-based chili sauce and opted for Sriracha asian chili sauce instead.  It tasted pretty wonderful.

These are always a hit! I bake them alot longer than specified to get the desired bacon crispiness. Also, using Thai chili sauce instead of the plain ol' Heinz type  has a much more flavorful result, and packs a little zing. I've actually used just the chili sauce with a little brown sugar and omitted the mayo altogether.

By slicing the water chestnuts in half, you're making them weak and mine split and fell apart. I won't make these again.

This has made my "automatic" list.  It has never let me down! Everyone loves these things! I use 2 cans whole, 1 pound bacon cut in half, baked 1/2 hour, turn them over, bake 15 minutes. I don't bother with tooth picks. Then I pour the sause over it all and bake for about 25-30 more minutes (nice and bubbly). I've made them with different flavored Thai Chili Sause's(garlic, sweet, any kind - you can't go wrong).  Using a Thai sause does kick it up a notch! One party I brought these the guests were all women, who politely ate them (put them on dish and sat down),while at another party the guys just stood there and ate one after another after another.....

Too bad it is not possible to give more than 5 stars!  This is terrific!  Lessons learned:  only use whole water chestnuts; less time wrapping, easier to pick up, and still just bite size.  Leftover dipping sauce would great on chicken tidbits, too.

My mom has made these for nearly 20 years. They were my choice for snacks at my birthday parties too! A faster way to make them is by using the microwave. We always stick toothpicks through them for easy holding while dipping into the sauce. She always used equal parts of the 3 ingredients for the sauce too. Yum.

These went so fast at our housewarming party, everyone wanted to recipe. I baked them for a total of 45 minutes, turned over after the first 20 min. Also, I made the sauce using 1/4 cup of mayo, chili sauce and brown sugar. Very delicious!!

We made this at Meadowbrook Hall in Rochester, MI for various functions and dinners years ago when I worked there in the kitchen.  I had a hard time NOT eating them myself!  Great to see this recipe again.

First to get these CRISPY, cut bacon into thirds and microwave for about a minute or two, first, let cool then wrap around chestnut and secure with toothpick and bake. This is a delicious party treat everyone loves. We served this at our wedding reception and they were the first thing gone.

Excellent, easy appetizer.  They were all gone!  One quick time saver is using precooked bacon.  Then, skip the first 30 minute baking and just pour the sauce over at start and bake only 30 minutes.

WOW!  These are great everyone loves them they are definitely going to be made many more times.  Superb.  I have made these again since and find it better to make the sauce the night before and store it in the fridge so all the sugar dissolves and mixes well.  My sister ate a whole batch of these on her own!!

I doubled this recipe and it disappeared!  You don't have to double the sauce...there's plenty enough with just one recipe of it.  I served the sauce on the side so that the bacon wouldn't get soggy.  Delicious!!

Really good - I'll make these again. 4 stars because it needed a kick.  What in the world is the difference between chili sauce and ketchup???  I tasted it before I added it and it literally tasted exactly like ketchup so I added some cayenne pepper to the sauce.  YUMMY - thanks for sharing!

I've made these several times and they are excellent.  I seem to try a different type of bacon each time.  A good maple or hickory smoked is what I like

YUM YUM YUM!  We are Green Bay Packer fans and I make this for every game (per my family and friend's insistence).  I make the recipe exactly as written.  One thing I've found is using Center Cut bacon helps make the bites crispier.   I was very skeptical the first time about the mayonnaise (not a big fan) but once cooked there is no mayo flavot - just delicious flavor!

I have been making these for about 25 years now and I've always used BBQ sauce instead of the other suace provided here. I wrap them ahead of time in the bacon and put in frig because I usually make about 100 of these at a time! I never have leftovers either! Delicious!

This recipe is one of the most requested ones I make.  I use a bottle of Tiger sauce instead of the chili sauce because it gives it a little kick.  I also used turkey bacon the last time I made these and they were just as tasty.  This is a super easy appetizer that looks like you put so much more effort into making them than you really did.  Not to mention they tast AWESOME.  I have to triple the quantity every time I make them.  Thanks!

I don't like mayo and could really taste it in this sauce, so I reduced the amount of mayo and added a tablespoon of soy sauce.  I also used a Thai garlic chili sauce (which is a little hotter than the tomato based chili sauce). They turned out really yummy, with a very Asian flavor, with those changes.  I also doubled the recipe and did not halve the water chestnuts.

These were a big hit at B'day party. Followed others suggestion to cook longer 30 minutes then turn for another 20. I did this the night before and then cooked with sauce before party. I also added tobasco and some red pepper. I used 4 cans waterchestnuts and 2 lbs. bacon to get about 50 bites..the praise was well worth the effort.

This was way too sweet. I read all of the great reviews and I thought this would be great for an upcoming party. I am glad I made it ahead of time to try it out before serving it to guests. The water chestnut wrapped with bacon is a great idea but the sauce was not for me. I will not make this again based on the recipe unless I find a better sauce for it.

I've made these for years. My husband has been known to eat them all, so I have to hide some. 

To cut time before a party, I sometimes partially cook the  bacon. I remove it from the oven, while still pliable, and wrap the water chestnuts (I once bought sliced water chestnuts, instead of whole. Don't make that mistake). I have also omitted the sauce and everyone still loves them. You can use the same recipe with pineapple and scallops. With those you will need to partially pre-cook the bacon.

What can I say - these are a huge hit.  Have made them twice and they were the first thing gone in like 15 minutes.  I always double the recipe but the sauce does not need to be doubled.  I serve it on the side though and many people eat them plain.  Do your self and especially the men in your life a favor cook these babies up and then watch them dissapear!!

I have served this appetizer at two recent parties I catered.  Everyone raved about them.  I don't use all the sauce, because I think they would be too "soupy".  I have also found that they retain their flavor, even as they cool down.

Tasty and easy!  Made some with a whole chestnut and some with a half.  Preferred the ones with a half chestnut. Didn't use all the sauce so next time I will cut that down.  Placed rolls in my mini crock pot and poured sauce over.  Perfect for our Super Bowl Party.  Thanks for a great recipe!

These are absolutely fabulous.  I doubled the recipe for 12 people and had none left over.  I took the advice of earlier reviews and baked on a wire rack for approx. 40 minutes.  I also marinated the assembled rolls in a different sauce for about 30 minutes before baking, which turned out well - 1/2 c. orange marmalade, 1/4 c. soy sauce, 2 Tbsp. sesame oil, and 1 tsp. ground ginger.  Thanks for posting the recipe, Mary Ann!

EXCELLENT!  I would not recommend using thick sliced bacon, use the thinner slices instead.  I used whole chestnuts and 1/2 piece of bacon.  I cooked my rolls on a wire rack inside a cookie sheet and used a convection oven to bake them - you will not need to turn them halfway through cooking, they came out very crispy and cooked in 30 minutes.  I made the sauce using equal parts of the ingredients, it came out great and I served it on the side for dipping.  Everyone loved them.  I will definately be making these again!

These were great and very easy to make. I, too, used the whole water chestnuts and 1/2 a strip of bacon. It's not necessary to insert the toothpicks prior to cooking; they stay together just fine (I did put toothpicks in when they were done). These disappeared from the table immediately and everybody asked what was in the sauce. Deelish! I mentioned that I didn't make enough and the response was "not even close to enough." Double or triple your batch when you make these!

These are terrific!  I used a whole pound of bacon and quartered each slice and used water chestnut slices (not wholes).  After I wrapped each slice in the bacon, I put a toothpick through the middle. This helped keep the roll-ups together and was easy for the guests to eat! It also made a nice size batch!  Total baking time to crispy was about 40-45 minutes.

These were fabulous! I made a double batch one night and had to make another double batch the next!  I halved the hot sauce as we do not have stainless steel stomachs and served the sauce on the side - everyone gobbled them up.

I used this recipe for a wedding reception and it was a hit.  Made these changes:  used whole (not halved) waterchestnuts, used 1/3 strip of bacon to wrap each piece (didn't need toothpicks to hold together).  I also substituted 1/4 cup hot sauce for the chile sauce.  I turned them mid-cooking so that they would evenly brown.  They were very good!

Excellent appetizer.  For more of a bite, just add a bit more hot sauce.  I prefer to serve the dipping sauce on the side.

Perfectly delicious IF you make the sauce 1/3c chili sauce, 1/3 c mayo, 1/3 c brown sugar.  Otherwise, it is much too sweet.

These turned out pretty good and they were simple to prepare.  I actually wrapped them a few hours earlier and put it in the fridge.  I followed a few other tips and used 2 whole cans of the water chestnuts and cut the bacon in half.  I cooked them for 30 minutes, flipped them and cooked for another 20, then covered them with sauce and cooked for an additional 30 minutes.

These are requested at every family function I go to. I quadruple the recipe and never have any leftovers! Just a couple of tips: I usually cut the bacon into thirds and I don't halve the water chestnuts--just use them whole. It makes the ingredients go farther but is still delicious! Also, I cook them on a wire rack on a baking sheet, then transfer them to a 9x13 casserole when I put the sauce on.

These were very tasty, and I didn't have any left at the end of the night. I wrapped a whole water chestnut in a half slice of bacon and placed them seam down in a glass dish and baked for 30 minutes at 350 as instructed. Then I drained the grease and flipped them over and covered them in a sauce composed of 1/2 cup each of reduced fat mayo, brown sugar, Heinz chili sauce, and 1 tbsp Tabasco. I cooked them for another 30 minutes, then stuck a toothpick in each and served. If I had to do it again, I think I'd add more Tabasco for a bit more kick. I'm also tempted to "marinade" the water chestnuts in soy sauce or something first, just to give them a little more flavor (they felt a little superfluous to the overall dish, flavor-wise). Overall, though, this recipe was a hit!

I made these today for a family get together and they were amazing!!! I cooked in the oven for about 45 min (till the bacon was done) then put in a crock-pot with the sauce. Worked great! I was worried the bacon would fall off and it didn't :)

I made these for a dinner party and they got strange looks at first, but once one person tried one and started raving about them, they were gone in about 5 minutes. I was really pleased. These were amazing. I did use a sweet chili sauce instead of hot chili sauce.

We have made these many many times, and they are always a hit!  We now have requests to bring these to just about every dinner or pitch-in type meal we attend.  I was skeptical at first about the combination of mayo and chili sauce, but it really does produce a great flavor.

These are wonderful.  The only thing I changed was using just 1/4 cup of brown sugar--little less sweet.  For years I have made little smokies wrapped in bacon, sprinkled with brown sugar and baked.  I think those would be good in this sauce too.  Think I'll try that.

One of my favorite finds on this site! These are easy and delicious. Honestly, bacon makes anything taste good, right? One tip: I use Hormel Black Label Center Cut. This bacon is a little shorter than the regular size bacon and is the perfect size when cut in half!

Ooooh myyyy! These are addicting. What great flavor. Very simple to make. I pre-wrapped the water chestnuts earlier in the day, just to save time and that worked out great. I also used whole chestnuts and depending on the size of them, I was able to use a third of a piece of bacon for each. To keep them together, as well as make it easy for guests to pick up, I put toothpicks in each prior to baking. Make sure that you soak the toothpicks before so they don't burn. I used a baking rack to keep them from sitting in grease. They went quickly and had rave reviews. They're wonderful and super easy to make.

These are so good! Made them on Christmas day with a couple other appetizers, these were gone so fast!!! Have had multiple family members ask for the recipe already! Double it and they were gone within ten minutes! Use a sweet chili sauce, just added a couple tblsps of ketchup to balance the flavor, RAVE REVIEWS. Also tossed water chestnuts lightly in a couple shakes of salt, onion and garlic powder before wrapping in bacon, cut bacon in thirds, perfect length. Will make again for sure :)

Made these for a small gathering and they were a giant hit!!  The sauce is amazing!!!  Water chestnuts gave it an added crunch - very tasty.  I was able to cut the bacon into 3rds and that seemed to work fine.  We had 12 adults over and this seemed to be enough - but next time, I would probably double the recipe - I like to have plenty for everyone. 

Also, I cooked them ahead of time, then poured the sauce on them and put them in the frig.  About a 1/2 hour prior to guests arriving, I popped them in the oven and they were ready to go.  

Great recipe!!  Thank you!!

When we make these we soak them in soy sauce or liquid amino for twenty minutes then coat them in sugar then wrap them in bacon. This makes them so good, no need for  sauce! They are for sure gone before they hit the table!

Excellent, after reading some of the other reviews (I was a little unsure of the ingredients at the beginning as well) I decided to try this one out... and it was FANTASTIC. You definatly have to soak them in the sauce - no skimmping out!  

I enjoyed it so much I've also made the sauce, and poured it over pre-cooked chicken that I've cubed and halfed water chestnuts; thrown in the oven for 45 min (same temp as this recipe) and served over a bed of rice!

Incredible. Used whole water chestnuts and doubled the recipe. It fed 8 people for about 15 minutes. I recommend tripling or even quadrupling this recipe accounting for the number and appetites of your guests.

I agree, these sound odd, but they were wonderful!  I have made them for many parties and they are always among the first dishes to disappear.  I followed other reviews and made the sauce with equal parts mayonnaise, chili sauce, and brown sugar.  I also try to make the sauce at least several hours beforehand so it has time to blend together.

These are amazing!! The sauce is great! I made a practice batch before my get together and found that 25 minutes to bake is good before the sauce and only about 15 minutes to bake after I put the sauce on so it didn't burn.
I'll be making these again this weekend for a birthday party!  This is definately in my recipe book and I will be making them for all of my parties!!  Thanks.

I was a little skeptical at first when I saw the ingredients for the sauce, but I decided to give it a shot anyway...and am I ever glad I did! I've made these bad boys on two separate occasions, and they were a HUGE hit each time. Do not plan on leftovers, b/c there won't be any! I did stick toothpicks in mine before baking them so they'd stay together better.

These are delcious! The only change I made was to cook them in the oven for 35 minutes...then transfered them to a slow cooker on low heat so they'd stay warm for the party...and also b/c I wanted to serve them in the sauce. Worked like a charm!

These have got to be the most unusual and best appetizers I've ever had!  My husband and I absolutely love these!  the only things I did differently is I used miracle whip instead of mayo and I used half of the chili sauce and the other half was that sriracha hot chili sauce that you can get at the asian market.  I did have to cook these an extra 10 min. or so to make the bacon crisp.  Also, I usually serve the sauce on the side instead of putting it all over the top.  Maybe I'll try it that way next time.  You've got to try these!  They're very addictive!

I brought this to a party and everyone loved it so much that I was asked to bring this to our next get together.  I use a toohtpick to hold them together after they are rolled.  They are also much easier to serve with the toothpick in them.

These were pretty good. We found that thinner sliced bacon or low sodium bacon worked best. It crisped better and stayed wrapped around the chestnuts - didn't need to bake WITH toothpicks. I waited to insert the toothpicks before serving.

I liked this but I did change it to whole chestnuts rather than slicing them in half.  And I cut the bacon slices in thirds and just stretch the pieces to fit around each water chestnut.  I added a little hot sauce to the sauce, too.  I think the sauce really makes them.  I have gotten requests to make these more than once.

this is a 5 star if you make all of the suggested changes:
16 oz of whole water chestnuts wrapped in bacon & cook for 45 minutes
serve the sauce on the side as a great dip

I served these today at a bridal shower and they were well liked.  I don't like a sweet dipping sauce, so I changed it to 1/4 cup mayonnaise, 1/4 cup of chili sauce and 1/4 cup of hot sauce for a spicy taste.  Thanks for the recipe.

WOW. These are incredible! I made a batch for tonight and now I clearly have to make another double batch! I didn't half the water chestnuts...they weren't that big to begin with...and wrapped them with 1/2 slice of bacon. I did have to bake them for 45 minutes like others have suggested, but it was DEFINATELY worth the wait. The sauce surprised me...such odd ingredients for a GREAT sauce!! (I'll serve it on the side so the bacon doesn't get soggy). This is definately a keeper!!!!!

This recipe was a HUGE hit.  I made a double batch for a Christmas party and they were all gone before anyone went for seconds!  I've had several people ask me for the recipe.  However, in my opinion, I thought they were just okay.  I prefer the bacon chestnut rolls to not be so sweet.  If you prefer a "tangy" flavor instead, this recipe may not be for you.

Delicious!  I tasted the sauce as I was mixing it, and wondered whether this was going to be eaten.  After plating them, I tried the first one, and just loved it.  Everyone loved them, and even though I made more, they were all gone in no time.  I used the whole water chestnuts, and it was such a lovely texture.  Will definitely be making them again.

I used someone's recommendation and dipped the water chestnuts in brown sugar before baking - YUMMY!!  I dumped the cooked concoction into a crockpot to keep warm on New Year's Eve.  Everyone enjoyed these!

The only thing I do differently is to soak the water chestnuts in soy sauce the night before I make them.  It adds a little bit of smokey goodness to the rest.

Great recipe, followed advise to use bacon cut into thirds, used whole water chestnuts, cocked longer and used garlic flavored chili sauce.
Also added soy sauce to the glaze, a huge hit all around.

While prep does take time, I  prepared and cooked early, just inserted toothpicks and reheated on a Pam coated Cooke sheet at the party.

These were yummy.  Baked at 375 for 30 minutes, turned the chestnuts over to bake the underside of the wraps, then spooned sauce on and baked for another 20 minutes.  I made only a 1/2 of the sauce, and this was plenty for us.  Added a dash of worcestershire sauce and a tsp. of ketchup to cut the chili sauce.  Was really good!

Yum.  I used Chili Garlic Sauce(in the asian section of the grocery) the 3rd time I made these and it gives it so much more flavor and kick. 
 I also followed the suggestion of others and added the sauce last after first cooking them on a broiler pan to allow crisping of the bacon.   Tried using the extra bacon with pineapple chunks and they were great.  Great the next day too.

These are great! I hate making things with mayo, but went out of my comfort zone and tried it - I'm so glad I did! They were delicious. The only difference was that I accidently bought SLICED water chestnuts, so I put about 4 slices in each roll. It actually turned out pretty good! Highly recommended!

You will definitely need to double or triple this recipe!  No matter how many you make, they will be gone in an instant.  I have yet to meet a person that does not adore these little delightful bites.  I cut my 1 lb. bacon into thirds, and it works perfectly well for 3 cans of water chestnuts (not halved).  My mother suggested also wrapping pineapple chunks or dates this way, but not sure if that might be too sweet.  Delicious anyway!

These were really good - especially the sauce!  I was dipping bread into the sauce after the appetizers were gone.  I'm making the sauce again tonight bacon wrapped chicken breasts.    I must have had thicker bacon because my 1/2 pound of bacon didn't wrap all my water chestnuts, but that's ok.  It also took longer than 30 minutes to crisp the bacon, but that's ok too - I just kept an eye on them.  It probably took about 45-55 minutes for mine to crisp up.

After assembling the rolls I gave each one a good sprinkling of fresh ground black pepper. I also added black pepper & garlic powder to the sauce. I cooked the rolls for 30 minutes earlier in the day drained the fat then put a dollop of sauce on each one and refrigerated them until 1/2 an hour before the party - at which point I cooked them for the remaining 30 minutes. These were a HUGE HIT. They dissapeared within 20 minutes of the party starting. I doubled the recipe this time around, next time I will quadruple it. I also put a dish of extra sauce on the side for dipping - something I definitely recommend because that sauce is DELICIOUS!

These are amazing and disappear quickly no matter where I bring them.  I use turkey bacon to cut down on the grease and fat.  I put toothpicks into each one before placing on the serving platter.  So easy and so delicious. Thanks for the recipe!

Yummy and so easy to make.  I used a whole chesnut per half piece of bacon (rather than half a chesnut).  I used a spicy chili sauce, which I thought was fabulous (my sister thought they were too spicy, but I thought they were perfect).  The bacon was nice and crispy.  You can even make these ahead of time and serve later (turned out great even after storing in the fridge).  Great sauce that can be used on many different things.

Delicious!  Took these to a Christmas party and everyone loved (including me!).  I did use 1/4 cup brown sugar and not a 1/2.  I also cooked the bacon 1/2 way in a skillet before putting in the oven... nice and crispy!

I cooked these up for some weekend
munchies, and, although I don't have a
sweet tooth, I enjoyed these - the few I
could pilfer.  My wife was guarding the
rest like a pit bull with puppies.  I'd
have to give this five stars just based on her raves.  The different, yet
complimentary taste and texture of the
water chestnuts with bacon alone makes
this recipe worth a try.  But the sauce,
so simple and so good.  I know there are
other foods out there just waiting for
this sauce.  Does anybody have any
suggestions?  Oh, and bless you, Mary Ann
that's from me and especially the wife.

I make this recipe with a few changes. After baking these until just crispy, I put in a crockpot and cover with BBQ sauce instead of making the mayo sauce in the recipe. Then I just take the crockpot to parties and it keeps them warm. It is always a hit.

Absolutely delicious.  The only thing I will do differently next time is to double the amount of bacon covered chestnuts for the amount of sauce.  I thought there was more than enough for double the chestnuts.  Great recipe, husband and I are very pleased!

Disappeared!! Made this for a adult b-day party, I made 8 cans of chestnuts, they were gone in minutes and folks were dissappointed that there weren't anymore!! Who knew. I followed the directions exactly,cooked for about an hour total. They turned out great!!

I thought it sounded crazy but every party I take them to I come home with an empty dish, even parties with half of the guests being vegetarians.

I made this recipe for the first time last night for a holiday get together and it was a major hit...not a nibble left on the plate. I had eight different appetizers and this was hands down the favorite. The only change was to use whole water chestnuts instead of the halves suggested in the recipe.

These were pretty tasty. I made the recipe as stated without any changes other than cooking about 15 minutes longer than called for in order to crisp the bacon.  I enjoyed the sauce and would recommend following the instructions of cooking them in the sauce at the end rather than using it as a dipping sauce.

These are the best and are requested often by my family.  I add about half of the hot sauce and then taste before adding more.  After many batches, I've streamlined - I do not halve the H2O chestnuts anymore, I cook at 375 for a bit shorter time (depending on bacon's thinkness) and do not return to the oven, but serve lukewarm (or microwave a bit).  Everyone loves them.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

I have made this recipe exactly the way it says (except sometimes I bake them longer to get them nice and crispy) and this is my favorite. I make them for parties and they are always the biggest hit and gone within minutes. Excellent! You won't be disappointed.

All I can say is bacon makes anything yummy!  This recipe was no exception.  It was a big hit for our superbowl party.  I must admit I didn't know if I would like the stuff that went on top of them, but I was not disappointed!  I will use this again and again.  Great recipe.

Wonderful!! I made this just for me and my husband. As Ive made these throughout the years I have found my purfect ratio. 

1 whole waterchestnut : 1 half peice of center cut bacon. Perfect everytime!!

I think we ate them all in under 5 minutes!! Very addictive. I will make these again for my next dinner party.

I have made these many times...once for a wedding.  They are absolutely wonderful and I get requests to make these often.  The sauce really makes them, but I always add more heat by adding either Chalula hot sauce or Louisiana hot sauce to taste.  They even freeze well, but thaw them out before baking.

These received mixed reviews at a get together, some thought the sauce was great, others didn't care for it at all. Baking time was also quite a bit longer than stated and no real need to cut the waterchestnuts in half, they're small enough as is.

Huge hit at a holiday party. Fabulous and so easy to make. I too, used whole water chestnuts, 1/2 slices of bacon, and secured with toothpicks. Needed 45 minutes cooking time. While the rolls were baking, I heated the sauce ingredients in a saucepan (medium heat) for a smoother sauce, and poured over the rolls when done.

Who would have thought that bacon, water chestnuts, brown sugar, mayo and hot sauce could result in such a scrumptious appetizer?  Did not have chili sauce so just "poured" in the hot sauce and it was YUMMY! Can't wait for the next party so I can make these.

I cooked several of the high-rated recipes on this website and this recipe was the big hit. Several people asked for the recipe.  It took much longer than 30 minutes for the bacon to get crispy in my oven. The sauce was very good. Thank-you for a great recipe.

WONDERFUL recipe!  I soaked the chestnuts in tariyaki sauce first...  the sauce is FABULOUS, sounds a little weird at first, but it's perfect. I also tried these rolled in brown sugar before they're cooked; makes a delicious glazed version.

This was a big hit and it's very simple.  The sauce is great, although next time I may reduce the amount of brown sugar a little bit.  At the next office party or gathering I'm making these again.  Great recipe!

Absolutely delicious! Texture, flavour, aroma; all of these things combined made these a delight to make. Will definitely be making them again. As others have said, do not cut the water chestnuts in half; I left them whole and they turned out fine.

Awesome!  I made them for a work potluck and got many compliments.  Note:  I needed a whole package of bacon, rather than just a half pound.

I got this recipe years ago from a friend. Only difference is I use scallops instead of water chestnuts. Cook the same as recipe says. Can also cook the hour and heat the sauce in a pot on the stove and serve on the side. This takes into account family members who do not like the sauce. My family loves it with the scallops--never made with the water chestnuts.

This is a wonderful recipe.  The crunch of the water chestnuts really adds to the experience.  I partially precook the bacon, cool them and then wrap the chestnuts so they only have to cook for 1/2 hr in the oven, limiting the mess.  I put the sauce on right away.  They can be prepped ahead of time sauce and all and then thrown in the oven last minute.  Warning...these are addicting.  They reheat well too.

I was looking for bacon wrapped recipes and this one kept popping up.  Let me tell you... Oh mah gosh this is sooooo good!  I love the sweet and crunchy of the water chestnut.  I found the water chestnuts in the Asian section of the grocery store.  I didn't have chili sauce which I don't think is really needed so I used a bit of Sriracha hot chili sauce, gave it a nice kick!  I so recommend this recipe, it will knock your guests socks off!

Wow!  I made these for my Kahlua party and they were a HUGE hit!!  we did a few of them with turkey bacon and they were just as good!  The crunch of the waterchestnut is perfect and that sauce carmalizes so well!  A definite repeat! Everyone wanted the recipe.

I did a similar version. In addition, I also used tarragon-marinated chicken breast and stabbed toothpicks as an appetizer. OMG!! (part of my bro's wedding). Instead, I finished it off with a honey-mustard dressing.

This is a HUGE crowd pleaser.  I roll each halved water chestnut with half a strip of bacon, and then bake for 30 minutes.  Meanwhile I mix the "topping" ingredients and heat over the stove on low heat - stir continuously.  I then top the baked rolls with the warm topping and bake for an additional 5 minutes.  Cuts down on cook time and is absolutely delicious!!

Great idea! I was serving cocktail meatballs with a similar sauce so for this I used honey mustard dressing instead and it was delicious. I think I also had to bake an extra 15 minutes to get the bacon brown enough.

These were a huge hit at Thanksgiving. I've been asked to make them again for Christmas. I doubled the recipe and used equal parts for the sauce (1/3 Cup each) I started cutting the bacon into thirds when I realized I was going to run out of bacon way before I ran out of Water chestnuts. The ones that I used a half slice of bacon on tasted better though. They went so fast that I have to double the recipe. Next time I will buy two pounds of bacon to be on the safe side.

I brought this to Thanksgiving and they went in less than 10 minutes.  One thing I did differently from the recipe was I used 3 cans of whole water chestnuts rather than 2 cans of halved ones.  This gave them what I thought was a perfect bite size.  Also, I cooked them for about 45 minutes at 375 before draining the grease, and then finished them off for 30 minutes at 375 and they came out PERFECT.  Awesome old school recipe.

This recipe is great! Nice & easy & quick.  I've made these as an app during the holidays & it's always a hit. Anytime there's a get together I get a request for them.  The only thing different I do is add Sriracha (Asian hot sauce) for some kick.  Delicious!

WOW! These are amazing! Prep was super easy, just cut the bacon in half, wrap and bake. Made the sauce as it is written with a dash of some asian hot sauce for a kick, perfection. I did bake for 30, turn and then broil for 10 to make the bacon crispy. No need to do toothpicks until serving, just put them on the side and people can spear their own, the bacon seals it all together. I used whole water chestnuts, glorious crunch! Next time, I might marinate the chestnuts in some soy sauce & sugar for a couple hours before hand to add another dimension, but it doesn't need it!

This was a huge hit at my New Year's Eve party!  I rolled them all ahead of time and put them on a tray in the frigde.  I also make the sauce ahead of time.  So come party time, I just poured on the sauce and put them in the oven.  Everyone LOVED them!!

These were the hit of our holiday party! I made lots of other appetizers - but these definitely went the quickest! I followed some other tips like cooking them on a cookie sheet on a pan to let the grease fall. We had to cook them longer than it says to to get the bacon crispier. I might try pre-cooked bacon next time. I tripled the recipe along with the sauce - but there was no need to - there was way to much sauce leftover. However, I put it in mini-crock and let it simmer nearby for people to dip the chestnuts in. Overall - simple and good!

I didn't find them that amazing. Especially not with the work these things took...holy cow! My brother-in-law said mine were the best he has had, because of the hot sauce I used. I would suggest a tomato based over a vinegar base.

NEVER ENOUGH!!!  This is the best appetizer ever.  They disappear so quickly that I now double the batch.  For a single batch, I cut back the proportions on the sauce because it makes way too much.  This is a true winner - simple and delicious.

The best ever! I soaked the waterchestnuts in soy sauce and sugar overnight. Ran the back of the knife over the bacon to get some of the fat off the bacon. This also streches out the bacon so you can actually cut the bacon in thirds if you like.

YUM! These were a huge hit.  We prepared them as the recipe said and they were very tasty.  I read another review that said they put them on a wire rack and that sounds like good idea and will try that next time.  Thanks for such a yummy treat!

Weeeelllll, this was just OK, not a lot of zip, and took a lot of time to prepare.  I won't make it again.  Wasn't anything special.

Great recipe. It does take a bit of work - but every bit is worth it. These disappeared in no time flat - and I got asked for the recipe by several people!

I make these for our appetizer only Halloween party.  Every year I have to make more because they go so fast.  The recipe is perfect just like it is.  Sometimes I don't cut the bacon or the chestnuts (event faster) and it still tastes great.  The only problem is making enough of them.

These are fabulous! And I hate hate hate water chesnuts.  I made these for a group of about 15 people and every time I looked at the pan it was empty.

SUPER easy - and Oh so tasty! These were the FIRST to go at a recent Halloween party. Everyone asked for the recipe! 

I would note that the initial cook time may be a bit longer depending on your oven. It took them about 45 minutes to get crispy.

I did not make this recipe but I was a party at a friends house and she made them.  They are sooo yummy!!  She did not halve the chesnuts and kept them whole.  I will definitely be making this recipe on my own very soon!!!

These were a HUGE hit, even with a skeptical husband who scoffed at the mayo in the sauce. I used a non-tomato based Asian chili sauce, and did about 75% that with 25% ketchup - worked perfectly!

I also prepared these the night before and baked them without the sauce, and refrigerated overnight. Then, right before company came over, I poured the sauce over and baked the rest of the way. They did need about 5-10 extra minutes, like the other reviewers suggested. Will definitely make again!

These taste amazing.  The first time I made them I tried cutting the bacon in thirds and precooking it as per others suggestions, but thought it made the bacon difficult to handle and I had trouble getting it to stay wrapped around the water chestnuts.  I also baked them in a 9 x 13 pan, but I think they were too close together and took forever to cook.  The next time I followed the recipe as it was written except I didn't halve the water chestnuts (they were small.)  I spread them out to bake on two cookie sheets with a lip and used the convection oven - they cooked much more evenly.  They still took about 40 minutes  and I turned them half way. I also lined the sheets with foil and just changed the foil for the second trip to the oven - easy clean up.  I can't imagine using the sauce as a dipping sauce because it caramelizes on the wraps in the oven which is what makes them taste so good.  Decided the sauce would probably also be good on salmon and plan to try that soon.

A huge hit at a party I went to recently.  I followed the recipe exactly and the only thing I may change is adding a bit of hot sauce to give it a kick - but regardless are excellent.  Making them again today to take to a party tonight.  My girls love to help and what better way then having them to the "hard" work of wrapping the water chestnuts!

These were great! Were not hard to roll at all. I did not cut the water chestnut, rolled them whole, and I cut the bacon into thirds. They were the first to go!

It was different.  I think scallops or shrimp could be subsituted for the water chestnuts.

Update - I tried with turkey bacon and they held together very nicely and still tasted great, plus there was little to no fat to drain off. I also wrapped some pineapple which was great too.

Delicious! Nice amount of kick to them. My hubby does not like water chesnuts but loved the sauce with the bacon so much that he overlooked that (somewhat until he started to just leave the chesnuts behind) now I have to find something else to wrap with bacon and use that sauce for him. YUM!

I cut the bacon slices in half and used a combo of whole and halved chestnuts. We liked the whole ones better. I had to cook for a lot longer than the recipe called for, but they still turned out magnificent! These were gone in a flash. Next time I will make a double batch.

These rolls are fabulous!  I used Sriracha chili sauce, and the combination of the sweet and hot was amazing.  Beware, these are HOT!  I used whole water chesnuts, 1/3 bacon strip, baked 45 minutes, turning halfway through!  Was the hit of the appetizers.

WOW!  Everything everyone said is true.  I took them to a cocktail party of 60 over the weekend and they were ATTACKED.  Numerous people came up and asked for the recipe.  Definitely a hit.  Only problem was I doubled the recipe and should have quadrupled it!  I also used whole water chestnuts, cooked for 45 minutes, then 30 minutes and I used a Thai garlic chili sauce.  YUM!!!

These were a hit at a BBQ with friends! The sauce could have been a bit spicier, and I too did not drizzle it on top, but rather let guests dip it in there. They were gone within minutes!

I grilled these instead of baking them at a recent grilling party.  It worked really well, just shoved a tooth-pick through the rolls to secure the bacon.  I precooked the bacon before using to cut down on the grease and make sure it would come out crispy.  Next time I probably cut the mayo out of the sauce.

I have made these several times and taken them to parties in the crockpot. (Don't cook them in the crockpot - just put in to transport and keep warm).  It is fun to watch the people gobble them up.  I've never brought any home!

I have made these many times for parties and potluck and no matter how many I make they all disappear! Few ingredients, simple to make and totally delicious!! I double the recipe and usually end up with about 65 - 70 rolls.

Use 1/3-1/2 slice bacon per whole water chestnut, securing with a toothpick. Turn halfway through a 45 min baking time.  Fabulous!

I made these for a Christmas party last night and they were excellent!  Based on other reviews I used whole water chestnuts, 1/3 slice of bacon,  and I cooked them for 45 minutes.  The sauce was yummy too!  I'm going to make these for another party next Friday.  Thanks for this great recipe!

I had so many phenomenal comments on these!!! Instead of using chili type sauce, I used regular tomato sauce and a little Tabasco sauce.  These were the most popular appetizer I served.  It is great for a large group of people.  Very easy to make!

This is an office potluck favorite!  I buy 2 cans of water chestnuts and wrap them whole (instead of halved) in the bacon.

I just made this for a dinner party.  What a HIT!!!  I didn't have mayo, si I made a little different sauce.  Mixed 1/2 cup ketchup, 1/4 cup brown sugar and put in a few dashes of tobasco.  Brushed on the tops after cooking.  The texture with the bacon & water chestnut was very nice.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  Next time I'll try the mayo sauce

These were a huge hit.  I kept the chestnuts whole and bought two tins.  Also made the chili sauce from scratch using a recipe from here.  Delicious.

I've made this several times. Always a hit. Always the first thing gone. Always tons of compliments. And always people asking for the recipe. I rate this recipe 5* as it is written, but I normally do not halve the chestnuts. It's easier to work with the whole piece and adds a better texture.

I baked for 15-20 minutes and then turned each one over for crispier bacon.  After baking I used toothpicks in each one to hold together and serve.

I could eat these 3 meals a day lol... so  easy to do and the sauce is amazing. I did half batch as written, and the other half I subbed in Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce (I don't do spicy). I served them both as a dip on the side... delicious!

I use 2 cans of whole water chestnuts, cut the bacon in half, roll and secure with a damp toothpick (also makes it simple to eat for guests). I bake them on a broiling pan first, to get rid of excess grease.

I double the sauce ingredients to have lots to pour over (especially when cutting the bacon in half, you can get a lot more while keeping the cost down). I also heat the sauce in a pot on the stove before I pour it over to bake.

Of course this gets five stars, my family said they will be looking forward to these being on the menu again soon. They never said that about anyting I've made. I didn't change anything. Making more of them at time will be a must. I ran out before they were done eating them. Thanks for this recipe!

To some, this is known as Rumaki.  To make a true rumaki, add a chicken liver to each appetizer before wrapping bacon around the water chestnut.

I make these a lot! Low carb. I use chicken livers (in a container in the meat section of the grocery) cleaned up and cut into small pieces, place a half a slice of maple flavored bacon in the palm of your hand, then put a piece of chicken liver on top of that and place a sliced water chestnut on top of that. Wrap tightly folding the bacon around it. Place on sprayed foil on cookie sheet. I sprinkle lemon-pepper- garlic and oregano on these and bake for 20-25 minutes turning once then put the broiler on for about 5 minutes watching them, for a crispier crunch. I serve with tabasco mixed with honey on the side! (For this you buy your water chestnuts already sliced!)

This was a great recipe. Absolutely perfect for parties! We changed up the recipe just a bit by adding chopped water chestnuts to the sauce. This added to the crunchiness. SCRUMPTIOUS!

These were great, but the sauce was a bit too sweet for me. When I make this recipe again I will do 1/4cup of brown sugar instead of 1/2cup. Also I brushed the sauce over the bacon-covered water chestnuts instead of pouring, so they wouldn't be completely soaking in sauce. Yummy though.

These were pretty good, but I have to say that I like the plain bacon and water chestnut rolls (minus the sauce) ones much better.

Fantastic, my go-to dish for events that require snacking.  I recommend whole water chestnuts and adding a little sweet chili sauce.  Also, I cooked at a little higher temp.

I was very skeptical about the sauce for these.  Even after I mixed it and put a finger in to taste it, I considered using a different recipe for the sauce.  But, eventually I decided to trust previous reviews and it turned out great!  A nice mix of sweet and tangy.  
I didn't like having to drain the bacon grease from the pan, and I think in the future, I will place the rolls on a rack inside the pan that can be lifted out of the grease.

These are so easy to make and so delicious. I took them to a New Eve get together and they were a big hit. They were gone almost immediately and everyone was asking for the recipe. I didn't change anything about the recipe other than I didn't go by the time. I cooked them until they were browned and starting to look crispy then I flipped them, put the sauce on them and they turned out perfect.

I tripled the recipe to have for 20 people - they all went!  Great texture and the sauce is yummy.  Only thing I did different is cook for extra 15 minutes to make crispy.

We used to make these when I was little. My mom said they were popular in the 70's. We called them Ramakis. We use water chestnuts and pineapple chunks. These are very good. Crispy, chewy, tangy and sweet.

Have had this so many times at card groups and loved them. So....I made them for an appetizer for Thanksgiving.  Quintupled the recipe...that's times 5! I took a reviewer's hint and used precooked bacon and only baked the last 30 minutes.  They all burned!! I know my oven was set at 350 so that wasn't the reason they burned.  SO everyone...I would NOT use precooked bacon AND I would check that oven at maybe 15 minutes.

I cooked this for a birthday party. Everyone loved it. I made a few changes based on other reviews. I'm not a huge fan of mayo, so I cut that down to 2 tablespoons, used whole water chestnuts, and thick sliced bacon (cut in half). Cooked for 40 mins, then poured some of the sauce over the rolls and baked another 15 minutes, then turned on the broiler the the last 2 mins. The rolls were delicious!

If I could give these more stars I would!!! They disappeared at the holidays in the blink of an eye and I doubled the batch!! I did double the sauce...used some while baking it and some for dipping when served. I also inserted toothpicks to make it easier to grab and eat. Will make again and again....Super Bowl Sunday will certainly see many of these appetizers on our table...I may try this sauce with shrimp too....the sauce is simply divine!!! Thanks!!!

I'm a vegetarian, so I cannot attest to the taste of this recipe.  However, after watching my fiance devour a whole (still really hot) batch, I think they turned out well!  After reading other reviews, I also used whole water chestnuts wrapped in half a strip of bacon.  Cooking them for 45 minutes instead of 30 before adding the sauce worked well.  I've made this recipe twice in one week, and I intend to use it again.  Thanks for a great recipe!

These appetizers are great! I usually make the sauce with a mix of ketchup brown sugar and bbq sauce, and everyone just loves them! There are never leftovers.I make these every Thanksgiving to go with the rest of the food!

I was a little concerned about the combination of ingredients, but they were delicious.  Next time I will use less brown sugar, as the sauce was a little too sweet for my taste.  I will definitely make these again.

Instead of Mayo I used teriyaki sauce. I also used a ketchup based chili sauce and it wasn't spicy enough, my local store didn't have any authentic chili sauces. Next time I will try to get the real deal chili sauce. I prepared the sauce the night before and let my nuts marinate overnight, however, I am not sure if that really made a difference or not? The next day, as others had suggested, I baked bacon strips for ~15 min before wrapping them in chestnuts and/or pineapples (ppl seemed to prefer the pineapples in my family). They are pretty easy to prepare, but a bit tedious. After putting the wrapped bits on the tray, I glazed some sauce on each and let it bake for about 20 min and they were sizzling and smelling real good, then I poured more suace since it seemed a bit dry and they came out great. Between my sister and I, we almost ate half of them before even setting it out for the party! Next time I will try another substitute for the chestnut.

LOVE THESE!!!  I add 1 T molasses, 1 T Worcestershire Sauce, only scant 1/2 c brown sugar, 1/4 c ketchup (not chili sauce) - wrap chestnuts, secure with toothpicks, bake 15 minutes - remove excess rendered bacon fat; microwave sauce, if refrigerated, for 30 secs and stir well; blob it on really thick --  otherwise, it burns, "boat" the tinfoil so that the wrapped chestnuts are "clustered." Try not to get sauce on the toothpicks: it will burn and stick to them - This keeps the sauce from burning due to being too thin, bake another 15 minutes.  mjjk

Pretty good, but would have been better if bacon was cooked longer.  I cooked for 45 minutes but I think it would have been better if I had gone another 5 or 10.  Made the sauce on the side with only a tablespoon of mayo.  Tasted "okay".

This had potential - not sure if its "entertaining friendly" yet - I think something was missing in the sauce - maybe some more spice? My husband hates  water chestnuts but actually finished these off.

Made this for the holidays with many wanting to NOT like the appetizer, but look one year later it's on their request list!  Go figure.

These are great.  I make them often though I reduce the hot chilli sauce by half.

I made these for a party and they were gone within minutes. I did leave the sauce on the side because I had made it too hot for most people. I also cooked these for quite a bit longer than the recipe said. (I like my bacon crispy) I will definitely make these again.

This is about the 4th time I have made this and ALWAYS get requests for it.  I bake this for longer than called for; I like the bacon a little more done.  Tonight I didn't have brown sugar so substituted confectioners' suger and mixed with mayo and wing sauce.  Delish!

I replaced the chili sauce with hot pepper sauce (red hot) and really loved it.  Not too hot, just perfectly sweet-hot.
