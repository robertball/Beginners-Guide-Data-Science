Meat Lover's Cupcakes Haiku: "Way too sweet topping, 'cupcakes' sit in lots of grease, but still cute to eat." I reduced the ingredients for 1 lb. of ground beef and got 9 "cupcakes" - followed the recipe entirely other than forgetting the last sprinkle of cheddar cheese at the end. The directions and timing were spot-on (also very easy in that there were no veggies to saute beforehand), and the meatloaf itself was very good in texture and taste, but the sauce on top was too sweet for me, too "wierd" for my daughter, and just unnecessary for my husband who would rather drag his meatloaf through a condiment of his choosing. I also am not a fan of meatloaves that bake in constricted spaces like loaf or muffin pans so that they're just sitting in pools of grease, so if I make these again, I'll free-form it as a loaf in a 9X13 dish, and tool around w/ the sauce ingredients, if not drop the sauce entirely.

I will make these again.  I made a few changes, just because I like garlic and instead of milk I added almond milk and Italian bread crumbs.  I didn't add the cheese suggested but instead added Mozzarella sticks (4) cut into chunks adding them after filling the square loaves pan 1/2 full, added 4-5 pieces cheese, added more meat then a few pieces of cheese on top (3).  Added the sauce after cooking for 15 mins but omitted the brown sugar in the sauce.  These were very tasty and all the family liked them.   These are a keeper for us!

These were really good and very easy to put together.  Will probably be making these again.
