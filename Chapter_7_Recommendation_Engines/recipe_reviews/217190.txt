I did not have garlic salt or celery salt so I used garlic powder and Beau Monde seasoning. (Beau Monde seasoning is basically celery salt and onion powder) I cut this recipe back to make one batch for one bowl of air popped popcorn. I tossed my popcorn with a mixture of EVOO and butter, then sprinkled the spice mix over my popcorn. I really liked the combination of the cumin, curry and cayenne with the salty-parmesan-ish flavor of the Brewer's yeast. Brewer's yeast on popcorn is one of my favorite treats so I knew I was in for something good. Next time I make this, I'd cut back on the Beau Monde. For me, it was a little too salty and the celery flavor overpowered everything else. Good spice mix--very different but in a surprizing way.

Wonderful combination of flavors to perk up regular 'ol popcorn! And just as the submitter states, it garlicky with a slight smoky flavor.  I cut the recipe in half to give it a try and used garlic powder vs. garlic salt I also used smoked paprika vs. regular for some extra smokiness.  Overall, very tasty!

This is really a delicious combination of seasonings. I sprayed just the lightest bit of canola oil on the popcorn with my Misto to help the seasoning coat the popcorn better. It's addicting!

I was debating whether to give this 3 or 4 stars because it is WAY too salty. And I mean really salty. I made this exactly as written the first time, and although my family cook with a lot of salt, we couldn't eat this. 
The flavour was really good though so we gave it another go. I increased the brewers yeast to 4 tbsp and cut out the garlic salt and substituted 1 tsp garlic powder and only put in 1 tbsp celery salt. This, in our opinion made it fantastic.
I hate when reviewers review their changes and not the recipe so my 4 stars is based on the original recipe. In my opinion cut out some of the salt and you have a winner.
As an FYI this will make a lot of bowls of popcorn - it's not just for one serving.

I did't have brewers yeast so I left it out and didn't have garlic so I used garlic powder and table salt. I used a little too much salt, but other than that it was delicious!! Way better than I expected!

I played with this mostly to reduce salt.  I used 4 T nutritional yeast (cuz I had it on hand), 1 T garlic powder, 1 T celery salt.  For paprika I used spicy Hungarian so left out the cayenne.   Blended it up in mini chopper.  Made this up to have on hand but my taste test was so good I made popcorn immediately.

I replaced the cayenne with tajin seasoning (you can find it at target and Walmart) and it came out amazing especially on kettle corn! Thank you for this great recipe!

This is yummy, haven't tried it with the brewer's yeast but I put everything else in.  I've started using it on cottage cheese too.

added a touch of lime juice, cinnamon & sugar, then microwaved it all w kernels in brown paper bag. Drastically reduced the quantity of spices bc going on one batch of popcorn. Omitted yeast and celery bc the other flavors lean toward Indian cuisine.

Great mix of flavors and I will make again.  Sprinkled sparingly on buttered popcorn, and a little goes a long way.  Next time though I will cut back on the salts because it was too salty for me.  Maybe some garlic powder instead of garlic salt.

I am not a huge fan of curry but I went with it anyway and was glad I did. There's just so much going on in this seasoning - a little cheesy, a little spicy, a little out of the ordinary. I also didn't have celery salt or garlic salt so just used half onion powder and half garlic powder. It was so yummy, I was trying to get it all out of the bowl when I was done with the popcorn and then thinking about what else I could use as an excuse to put it on. It is definitely worth a try.

I put in the cayenne and every time we tried to eat it, we'd cough.  I don't know what the difference is between what I made and what the other reviewers made but it was inedible.

I did not have brewers yeast or the curry, and it was still amazing.  I keep it on hand all the time for a spice rub or a pinch in your bloody mary is awesome!

Really good! I cooked my popcorn in coconut oil, but drizzled the finished product, in two batches, with melted butter and the seasoning. I use a big, covered plastic dish and give it a good shake each time. I didn't have celery or garlic salt but used half garlic powder, onion powder and salt in it's place. I go easy on the salt and add more if needed. I also used smoked paprika. This is a good recipe to play around with the amounts of the seasonings that you prefer. I only made a half recipe to try, but I know I'll be making more to keep on hand. Thanks Diamondgirl!
