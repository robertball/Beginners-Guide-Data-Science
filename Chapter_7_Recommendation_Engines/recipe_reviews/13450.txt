You can kiss your diet goodbye with this rich and intoxicating soup (definition = "fattening as all heck but oh so good!). Even as your making this melting the butter and cream cheese - your thinking "I'm gonna die from clogging my arteries" but after you taste it - you don't give a darn! If you like clam chowders and are willing to splurge for a night I'd say make this EASY & Quick (did I mention delicious?) soup!! It literally took me 25 min from start to finish!! Oh- in addition to the shrimp I added a can of drained clams and added the milk to our preferred consistency! Thanks Suzanne for this great recipe - and for temporarily increasing my dress size!! (one situp errr...two situps...)

I made a few low-fat changes to this recipe and they worked well. I substituted the cream cheese with fat-free neufchatel and in lieu of cream of potato soup I used fat free cream of mushroom. I took the suggestion of adding a variety of seafood. Easy guilt-free and delicious. Doesn't get much better than that!

I've made this soup atleast 20 times now. I purposely waited to rate this.. this is a perfect simple recipe everyone asks for it but I act like its a secret. The key is getting the cream cheese melted I use sweet corn and if you can cut some off a cob even better. And I use 1 can of cream of celery instead..that seems to make it better..if thats possible.

Delicious and really simple. I have made this soup several times and it has quickly become one of our favorites. Only had 1 can of potato soup so used a can of cream of mushroom soup which added a nice little twist. Makes a great base for clam chowder.

One word...FAB-U-LOUS! My husband gave it a 10 and said it was the best soup he's had in a while! Yes it's really rich and fattening but oh so good. I used full-lead butter but the lower fat neufchatel cheese to cut out a little of the calories. I also used a can of sweet corn undrained which isn't specified one way or the other in the recipe. I ended up using 1 1/2 cups of 1% milk to get the perfect consistency for our tastes. I also cooked it a little longer than recommended after I added the shrimp as they seemed undercooked to me straight out of the bag. I wanted to taste the recipe as listed so I didn't add any seasonings until after it was in the bowl. We like a little more flavor so I would say adding some hot red pepper flakes a little sea salt and fresh ground pepper really took it over the top. This is one of those dishes you can't make too often 'cause it's not the healthiest thing you'll ever eat but the flavor is company-worthy fantastic so we will be treating ourselves to this awesome soup as often as our waist lines will allow. Thanks for posting!

Super-easy super-tasty. If I could give this more than 5 stars I would. I made it almost exactly as written only changing a few things: to cut down on the fat I used 1/2 the amount of butter and reduced-fat cream cheese. Also based on what other reviewers suggested I added a bottle of clam juice with a can of crab meat before simmering. This was still very rich very tasty and made plenty for our family of 4 (three of whom... the guys... are big eaters). Serve with crackers and a salad and there's dinner!

Very good soup! It seemed a bit thick so I added a 6 oz bottle of clam juice and about a cup of 2% milk. Also added about a tablespoon of Tony Cachere's Creole Seasoning. Delicious!

Tasty and I don't usually like seafood soups. I used fat free cream cheese margarine and 1/2 cup of skim milk so I think that cut down the fat quite a bit. Even with using the "lite" ingredients it is still a VERY filling meal to the point where I'm still feeling full over 6 hours later. I also added a bit of cayenne pepper and red wine vinegar. This is not something you'd want to make all the time but when shrimp is on sale make a point to do it!:)

I knew that I would probably like this soup but it was actually much better than I expected and I ended up loving it! I used cream cheese w/ chives & onion and ommitted the actual green onion just to save myself some time and I think I ended up adding about a full cup of milk as well as some black pepper. Next time I'm going to add some sea scallops along with the shrimp. Thanks so much for sharing your recipe Suzanne.

I had high hopes for this soup because of all the reviews. I made exactly as written. I thought it tasted like canned potato soup w/shrimp & corn. Nothing special....especially with all the added calories and fat. Sorry!:( Won't make again. I even added spices crab meat & mussels-still not worth the calories and money in my opinion.

I used all sorts of seafood shrimp crab chopped scallops and clams the result was the best seafood chowder of all time (I put in a little red wine vinegar to jazz it up because it needed something to cut the heaviness). This is the kind of recipe that you make for a gathering or luncheon....not something you'd want to feed to your family routinely it's just too rich.

It had been a few years since I had made this and I forgot how easy this was to make and how good it is. I saut√©ed regular onions in olive oil while melting the cream cheese and butter and that made it even quicker to make (I forgot to buy the green onions). I'll try it next time with crab. Everyone in the family loved it again.

Total success in my house. Made this for a Christmas Eve dinner and everyone loved it. I added red wine vinegar to cut the richness and also added cayenne pepper and black pepper and taragon. Only had one can of potato soup so added cream of celery and it worked fine. My son said he "liked it better than homemade potato soup and that is really saying something mom!" Will make it again!

I had leftover corn on the cob and decided to search for a corn chowder recipe using the ingredients "corn and shrimp" and came across this one on allrecipes. I made it for my husband and father-in-law for lunch to rave reviews. I lost count of how many times I heard "this is REALLY good!" Since I did not have condensed potoato soup I just used 4 diced and boiled potatoes in water in it's place. I also replaced the cream cheese with neuchatel cheese added a can of undrained clams more corn and more milk since I like it a bit thinner. I topped the soup with crumbled bacon and green onion and had crushed red pepper on the table for those who like it hotter. Definitely going in my top rated keeper file!

I have been making this soup for over a year now and I love it. I do change one thing though. Instead of shrimp I use a can of lump crab meat drained and I love it! I also add tobasco and pepper to give it a kick. I call it "crab corn chowder". I went searching the site for this recipe b/c I havent made it since last year and didnt have my recipe book with me and it took me forever to find. I didnt realize it's really supposed to have shrimp with it. It's fabuous with crab. Thanks for the recipe everyone who try's it loves it.

Pretty good but very rich! I think if I make it again I would try it with fresh shrimp instead of the pre-cooked. Also I added about 1/2 tsp. garlic powder to the soup & it just kicked up the flavor a lot.

Excellent soup - very easy to make and very tasty. With the butter and cream cheese it is very fattening so next time I will try it with reduced fat cream cheese and less butter and see how it turns out.

Excellent. Down in South Louisiana we refer to this as Cream of Corn & Shrimp Soup. Perfect easy yummy soup. I added some red pepper (about 2 tsp.) and some black pepper. Definitely doesn't need any salt as the potato soup etc. added more than enough. I will make again and again and will especially remember this to impress company with!

This is also my families favorite soup. We use imitation crab meet instead of shrimp and just toss in about half of a package. I tear it up small because my kids like the smaller texture better. This recipe always impresses people...they can't believe how easy it is. Thanks!!

I've made this more times than I can count lol and each time it seems to get better. ive passed its goodness on to my friends and they have tweaked it... using ham instead of seafood and adding some frozen hashbrown potatoes. it created something delicious. thank you to the creator of this. its something easy and delicious that a busy family can make - and still taste like restaurant quality.

I thought this sounded like an odd combination of ingredients and after trying it I think I was right. Having said that I think I added to much milk my soup was too watery. I also bought my shrimp precooked at the store instead of buying it fresh and cooking it myself. I have found the precooked shrimp absolutely tasteless. Even knowing my mistakes I still would not make this soup again.

This is now my families favorite soup. It was so easy to make and I didn't need to change a thing. I did add some extra shrimp just because. Very easy and quick to make.

I was apprehensive about this recipe but thought I would give it a whirl - BOY! this was delicious. Since I am the only one in family that likes shrimp I freeze this in small freezer bags and take it to work for lunch...delicious!

I thought this was wonderful!! The only thing I did was substitute neufetchel cheese for the cream cheese to cut the fat a little. Very rich and very good. Carol

Yummy - but SO rich! Next time around I'm trying it with neufchatel cheese for slightly lower fat. It definitely needs a good shot of Old Bay seasoning as well to add a little kick. I think it would be good with any type of seafood. This soup is pretty much a meal in itself and I love that it's fairly easy as well.

This is by far the BEST chowder ever!! I used cream of shrimp soup instead of potato and OMG... amazing! If you want a little more seafood flavor add a can of clams and a bit of imitation crab and you have a fantastic meal. Thanks for this recipe.

I loved this soup!!! I changed quite a bit because I have a texture issue. I did not use as much butter did not include the corn and this time I wasn't in the mood for seafood. I put in a few red potatoes tons of garlic and stirred in bacon bits and fresh ground black pepper after it was done. I willdefinately make it again and I will try seafood in it next time.

While this meal was quite good it was probably a tad too rich for our taste. I didn't even use all the cream cheese the recipe called for (only bc I didn't have the full amount) and in the end I'm glad I didn't. Probably won't be making this again although I am glad I made it this once.

I'm a little torn about how to rate this recipe. The finished product was a 5 out of 5 and got several rave reviews at the potluck we took it to. I had to add a lot of spices however which is why I gave the recipe as written a 4. As written it was a bit bland. I added a couple cloves of garlic a pinch of red pepper flakes (not enough to to make it spicy just to perk it up a little) about a tablespoon of red wine vinegar and some freshly ground pepper. The other change I made was to use a can of "southwestern" corn which had poblano peppers (that's what I had). I also used more like a cup of milk and a splash of chicken broth. What was amazing about this was that I made the whole thing in the crockpot. I added the milk and shrimp (cut into thirds) about an hour before I served it and the shrimp cooked nicely in the soup without getting rubbery. I think using raw shrimp also infused some flavor to the soup. I also used one cream of potato and one celery. This was very easy and yielded great results just be aware you will most likely need to jazz it up a bit so it doesn't just taste like canned soup with shrimp. I got a lot of compliments on it.

This soup hits the spot on a cold winter day. I LOVE it. I cut the butter to 1/4 c and use 4 oz half-fat cream cheese. I also like to add a variety of seafood as others have mentioned- clams crab scallops- but it is perfectly fine just as written. Tastes much more elegant than one would think. No one can tell it is canned soup and I don't tell either!

This soup is pretty good. It is easy and tastey especially if you like cream based sort of bland soups. I probably will not make it again since I am not a big fan of the creamy soups. I substituted light butter and low fat cream cheese and turned out just fine.

THIS is the BEST SOUP ever! I was almost embarrassed at how easy it was. I couldn't stop eating it as I was cooking it. My kids and husband both loved it and I can't WAIT to make it again!
