I used this quick recipe for a HH party for the neighbors and within 30minutes they vanished! I added more parm cheese and garlic just because I like cheese and garlic. They paired great with a semi-sweet Blanc Dubois and Rosé.

These were great and so easy.  I loved the flavor.  The only change I would make is to cook just little longer in order to cook the onions more or just put less in.  Just my thoughts.  I will make again.

I used the button mushrooms and I didn't have parmesan cheese so I added extra cheddar. Also I used white onion.

This tied out great!  I forgot to cut up the stems but it was delicious.  My hubby liked it.  I cooked it more like 20 minutes, thanks to another review.  I also used 1 cup of Italian cheese blend vs. the mozzarella and Parmesan separately as well as Kosher salt. We served this with corn on the cob, green beans and Maryanne’s Cornbread recipe (super delicious!).  Delicious dinner.

I added balsamic vinegar to the mushroom mixture and sprinkled at bit over them as soon as they came out of the oven.  They were delicious.  Everybody loved them.  They are company worthy.

Just made this and love it! I was only making one cap so I used less ingredients. Instead of salt and pepper, I used a touch of Italian seasoning. I was out of olive oil, so I used Newman's Own Greek dressing. FAB!!?

My wife has never liked mushrooms until I made this.
