I had coq au vin in Honfleur, France, and this recipe came out tasting just like I remembered!  I added some small white potatoes to the pot along with the chicken, and it made a great one dish meal, along with a salad.

Great tasting dish...quite suitable when served with mashed potatoes and crusty bread as other reviewers suggest.  Otherwise, I wouldn't quite know what to serve it with.  It is too basic to stand alone with other gourmet side dishes, yet too gourmet tasting to serve with simple salad and say, corn on the cob.  Very nice recipe (smells great cooking, too)

I added some small white potatoes to this like another reviewer suggested and served it with some crusty bread to "sop" up the fabulous "vin" and it was an outstanding meal!!

Excellent!  I made this as a birthday dinner for my mom, and she loved it.  There was a little extra sauce, but I just froze that and will make this recipe again.  Delicious!

This recipe was awesome!  I recommend to everyone who has a little time during the week to prepare this great dish.  It took me to prep and prepare 1 hour and some minutes but the next time I am sure the time will be shorter.

Great recipe, easy to fix and everyone really enjoyed.  The only step I would leave out would be the bacon, it gave it a smokey sort of flavor.  Would definately fix again!

My whole family loved this!  I've made it for company now too (lol, the name just sounds like it's hard to fix)and everyone has enjoyed it.  Definately one I'll make part of our monthly menus.
