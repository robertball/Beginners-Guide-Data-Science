Very simple to follow and good results! I used 1/2 chopped fresh onion instead of the onion flakes. The hard part was waiting them to bake for the final hour!

These are sooo yummy.  I made them for my daughter's birthday party back in November, and they were a bit hit.  The sauce is yummy and a nice alternative to your chili sauce and jelly based sauces.  I like to roll my meatballs a little smaller than a golf ball...that way, they are "kid sized" for the little nibblers.  I served them in a glass baking dish with toothpicks.  Thanks Teresa.

These were so easy and a huge hit at my playgroup! I will be making these again. I did double the sauce recipe, and after baking the meatballs the first time, I poured the sauce over them and refrigerated them overnight. The next morning I put it all in the crockpot and cooked 4-6 hours. Delicious!

My family all ate this and wanted the leftovers for lunch. I used diced onion in the sauce and added garlic to the meatballs. We will have this again!

I really like the meatballs, but the sauce wasn't very BBQ-like, more like sweet and sour (but more ketchup flavor than anything).  I think next time I'll make these meatballs but use bottled BBQ sauce.

These meatballs were fantastic! I used 1&1/2 pounds of ground beef instead of 1 and it was great. My husband couldn't get enough of them, kept going back into the fridge and making meatball sandwiches. I will definately make this recipe again.

Very classic cocktail meatballs.  I made a double batch this afternoon and popped them in my slow cooker for company tonight.  I keep going back to the cooker and eating them and even my PICKY two-year old son has asked for "more, Mommy."  Thanks very much.

I loved this sauce! I've tried many of the meatball recipes on here and this has exceeded any of the ones I've tried.  I was in a hurry so I used frozen meatballs and threw them with the sauce into the crockpot.  These were given lots of compliments!

These are absolutely delicious as is.  I made them for New Year's Eve.  I just kept some toothpicks by the tray and let guests pop a couple whenever they wanted to.  Excellent and easy dish!

Oh my goodness! I've never had meatballs this wonderful before.  I used lean ground beef and they turned out so yummy, my 4 year old(who is usually picky)loved these!  My husband also made meatball sandwiches to bring to work.  This Recipe is a winner!!:o)

This is my favorite and standard appetizer meatball recipe...I've served these many times at various pot lucks and they always get eaten up (men love their meatballs! ; ))  However, I don't get too many compliments (I think it's just that they are not a very `original' or different enough dish and so many people buy them frozen and bring them that maybe folks don't think I actually went through the trouble to make them).  Very good recipe none-the-less.

Sorry, but this sure didn't work for me.  The vinegar in the sauce was too strong.  Maybe it would be better without the vinegar.  I might try that later.

These were great. The only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is because they are a bit too ketchupy.

No bad, not great. I thought the sauce was too tangy. I probably won't make again.

Oh My Gosh....Thank you so much for this awesome recipe! It totally saved my Super Bowl Sunday! I was doubtful but it was great. I did sub fresh onions (only because that was what I had on hand) and cooked for about three hours on high in croc-pot! Thanks again

It was excellent! I used bread crumbs instead of oatmeal and browned the meatballs in a pan and then cooked them on the stovetop at a very low heat. Everyone loved them!

These take a bit of time and elbow grease but your guests will love 'em.  The final sauce is the perfect compliment to the bite size meatballs.  Yum!

I thought these meatballs were absolutely WONDERFUL! I don't even eat a lot of meat, but couldn't get enough of them. I didn't change a thing, but I did double the recipe (big family). I did add CORN STARCH , so the sauce would be thick. I LOVE IT! Thank you, so much for this recipe. A KEEPER! KIDS LOVED IT TOO!

I loved the meatballs, but wasn't overly thrilled with the sauce (although my husband loved both). The sauce reminded me of sloppy joes, which I don't care for, so I think that's why. I loved how easy the meatballs were to make though, so I've been using that part of the recipe with another recipe I have for barbeque sauce.

Absolutely delicious!  Loved the sauce.  I didn't quite have enough ketchup, so I also added some salsa to the mixture(1/4 cup).  I also chopped up sweet onions instead of minced onions which added a great flavor.  One of the reviewers recommeded adding cornstarch so the sauce could be thick and I am so glad I did!  Next time I make these, I will also double the recipe (especially the sauce) to make meatball sandwiches afterwards.  Great idea!  Thank you!

Had these for our halloween party and they were the first to go!  I followed the recipe except did half oats and half bread crumbs.  Make sure you make them all the same size and don't overcook.

I only made the sauce to go with purchased frozen meatballs for a child's party.  I threw everything in the crockpot and they turned out great.  This recipe was a hit with children and adults alike.

What great meatballs!  Even my picky nephew kept asking for more.  This recipe definitely went into my recipe box.

We thought these were pretty good, but I was hoping for more after going to the trouble of making them.  I hate to admit it, but I've found store-bought meatballs that I love - I think I'll stick with them (in the classic chili sauce/cranberry sauce combo)!  Thanks for a tasty alternative, though.

I'm rating the sauce only, and conditional on this being prepared in a slow cooker. But, if done is a slow cooker, yum! If cooked for less time I think the vinegar would be overpowering - at 2 hour I was a little worried. I cooked for 5-6hours on low and it was wonderful! Even better the next day. This is a great recipe that can be altered to use what you have. I used ketchup and some leftover tomato sauce, real chopped onion, and spicy prepared mustard instead of powder. Great recipe!

I also used pre-cooked meatballs and just made the sauce recipe.  I did saute some fresh minced onion and fresh minced garlic in some bacon fat until slightly browned.  In that same pan I added about 1-2 tsp of chili powder and toasted that for about 30 seconds.  I then added the water, ketchup, vinegar (rice wine), brown sugar, worchestshire, mustard powder and tabasco (I added quite a bit more than the recipe called for but we like it spicy!) to the pan but had the burner off. Mixed it all up and poured over the meatballs in the crockpot.  My husband came running just from the wonderful smell.

I added a bit of extra brown sugar thinking that the vinegar and ketchup might be too overpowering.  I probably added too much, but I did get a lot of comments on how surprisingly sweet these meatballs were.  Everyone loved them!  It's a keeper.

I had high hopes for this after reading reviews.  End result = edible - but I was disappointed.  I should have just poured the ketchup bottle over the meatballs.  The vinegar was too tangy, too.  Sorry!

I found these to be dry and bland. The sauce needs to be doubled because there is not enough to cover all of the meatballs. Slow-cooked meatballs with grape jelly and chili sauce taste better and are easier to prepare.

I made a double batch of these meatballs since I was already making the mess I thought I'd freeze some.  The first batch I baked like the recipe indicated and they were firm (I'd say too firm).  The second batch I baked the meatballs in the sauce and they turned out much better (cutting down on baking time).  I used lean ground beef which may have made them too firm but the recipe didn't specify and also used Old Fashioned Oats not quick cooking because the recipe didn't specify.  I think a little less lean beef and quick cooking oats might be better but they were good the second time.  Ate the first ones even though they were a little hard.

These meatball are great. I found I have to make a double batch they go so fast.  I added some pepper and a clove of minced garlic to the meatballs when I made the for a potluck lunch at work and everybody loved them.  Thanks for the recipe.  Marlitt

Excellent recipe!  These meatballs come out wonderfully tender and my kids were crazy about the sauce!  It was a tad too sweet for my hubby but he said it's a definite for my recipe box!

I used fresh onion instead of onion flakes in both the meatballs and the sauce.

Thanks for a great recipe!

These meatballs were wonderful. I just loved them. My two year old loved them too. She ate almost as much as I did. I looked over the reviews before I made them and did as some other people suggested. I added fresh onions instead of dry and also put them in a smaller pan so the sauce marinated the meatballs while they cooked. Delicious!!!

This recipie was very good.  VERY tasty.  It was a hit at our New Years Eve party.  The only thing I will do differently is double the recipe next time.  It didn't make too many meatballs.  And there were only 4 of us!

I was very disappointed with this recipe.  After it was done, I kept going back over the directions to see if I had forgot something, but I hadn't.  The meatballs were bland, the sauce was tasty enough, but not thick and didn't stick to the meatballs at all. Not at all what I had expected.

This recipe is INCREDIBLE!  My kids crave it and ask for it again and again, and my husband can't get enough.  It is easy, too.  I would suggest draining the grease before putting the sauce on top.  Otherwise, the sauce gets dilluted.  Additionally, if you really pack the meatballs together, it keeps the sauce pretty much on top of the meatballs, giving them a good glaze with enough running between to coat them completely.

Excellent, I added an extra 1/3 cup white sugar and 1/3 cup Renee's Tangy Thai sauce.  I sauted onions for the sauce instead of flakes and added the pepper sauce to the meat, not the sauce.

I made the sauce in the stove top and then dropped mini ground chicken balls inside. I made a few changes - I used 2 lbs. of ground chicken instead of 1 and i decreased the oatmeal to about 1/4-1/2 cup (1 cup would make the meatballs too dry and not have the meat texture.) For the sauce - I sauted a fresh onion - (not the dried flakes) and added 1/3 cup white sugar and 1 jar of barilla pasta sauce to the rest of the sauce.

MMMMMM VERY good!! We loved these.  The only change I made was that I added more hot sauce...about a tablespoon more to the sauce, but it wasn't tabasco sauce.  We LOVE things hot and spicy.  The rest of the meal I followed the recipe to the T.  Thank you for supplying such a wonderful, yummy recipe!

I probably shouldn't be reviewing this whole recipe, as I didn't make the actual meatballs.  I used another recipe for that.  However, the sauce recipe is the best I've ever made for meatballs.  It isn't too sweet, like many jelly based sauces.  Kind of runny, but that didn't bother me.  I put them in the crockpot and let them cook for a few hours.  The longer you let them simmer in this sauce, the better they taste!

I made these exactly to the recipe and found that the vinegar was extremely over powering. It was the only thing I could smell (even BF asked why the kitchen smelled like vinegar when he came home) and most of what I tasted. I think they would have been much better if I removed it from the recipe.

Glad I tried this recipe due to rating reviews. Normally I would not have choosen such ingrediants but they have a tangy taste that is delightful. I used frozen meatballs and it turned out great.

Awesome recipe!!  I went to this website trying to find a recipe that was exactly like one my husbnd always made, but the recipe has been lost.  This one is exactly as I remembered only better by the suggestion of another reviewer.  I also sauted a diced onion and chopped garlic in 1/2 stick of butter.  I know that sounds like a lot of butter but since I doubled the sauce recipe the butter just adds a lot of richness to this recipe.  With the suggestion of the same reviewer I also added about 5 teaspoons of chili powder.  I then followed the recipe except I didn't add the water.  I doesn't need it if you like a slightly thicker sauce.  Even though I didn't follow the recipe to a "T" and added my own touches I still give it 5 stars.

These were pretty easy to make however I made the sauce poured it over the meatballs and refridgerated overnight.  I then put them in the crockpot.  I thought the sauce had too strong of a vinegar taste.

I'm just reviewing the sauce, b/c I used lil' smokies instead of making meatballs. I used an asian hot chili sauce (the kind with the rooster on the front) and it gave it a nice kick. My husband who usually doesn't like ketchup based sauces really gobbled them up! I can't wait to try the meatball recipe. Good sauce recipe!

I couldn't stop eating the meatballs. I was disappointed that I had to share these with others, even after being full I ate them just for the taste.I used saltine crackers (instead of rolled oats) and added about 1/4 cup of milk to the mix so it wouldn't fall apart. I will make these over and over again.

Delicious snack perfect for casual parties. I used only 1/2c oats per lb beef and i used a caribbean ginger / garlic / pimento spice blend instead of the onion flakes. I would definitely make this again

Really Great Recipe.
I deleted the drops of Hot Sauce from the meatballs and the sauce.
Instead I added several teaspoons of Liquid Smoke to the sauce for some extra flavor.
They loved them.
Thanks again..it's a keeper !

Yummy and easy. I doubled the sauce and used bread crumbs instead of oats. Next time, I'll use less bread crumbs, I didn't take into consideration that bread crumbs are finer than oats. Kept them warm a crock pot.

I found these bland.  I don't know if I will try these again.  I might find one with better spice/taste or just make up my own.  Thanks anyway though.

These were okay.  Easy recipe, good (but not great) results.  I also found that my meatballs turned out a little dryer than I would have liked.

My meatballs came out dry and overcooked. there was a lack of sauce because most cooked away. 

I assume that the worchestershire sauce goes in with the ketchup, the recipe does not specify.

 I might try this again adjusting the temperature and moist ingredients some

I really enjoyed this recipe.  It is really easy compared to some of the other cocktail meatballs.  I did add some worcestershire sauce and used onion soup mix in the meatballs. I might add some crushed pineapple next time as well.  Really something fun for the kids!

Delicious! I used Quaker Oats, the kind that only take 1 minute to cook, cooked them on the grill instead of the 1st half hour in the oven, and finished cooking them in a pot on an induction burner for the hour with the sauce. Otherwise no changes and they were perfect!

Made these tonight for our daughter's Volleyball banquet and they were wonderful.  Several people requested the recipe...a definite keeper!!!
The sauce is awesome, and I used frozen meatballs instead of making my own due to time constraints.  Will make again!!!
