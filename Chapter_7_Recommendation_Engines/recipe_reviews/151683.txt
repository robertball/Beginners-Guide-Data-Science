It was very good, but if you're looking for a traditional caesar salad, this is not it. It's a very good salad, but not a typical caesar salad. I liked it and will definitely make it again.

This is pretty good, but not your traditional Caesar salad.  I will definitely make it again, but with regular Caesar dressing instead of the marinade.

My husband loves this salad. I make it when we requests it for dinner. He says that the marinade should be bottled and sold. I personally don't think its as wonderful as he does. I do like it and it tastes good when I make it but I never really get a craving for it like he does. So my rating is based on a happy husband(that is rather picky about food).

The first time I made this it was decent but definitely missing something. The second time I made it, I added about a teaspoon of balsamic vinegar and a half to one teaspoon of salt to the dressing and it was perfect! Those two things make a HUGE difference! Also, this gives you serious garlic mouth so you probably don't want to eat it before going on a hot date :)

My family loved this recipe. We removed the garlic though since my mother was allergic, added some chopped carrots, tomatoes, salt and boiled eggs. We also cooked the chicken first, then marinaded it for a half hour instead, and it was perfect! So delicious!

Love the dressing! I altered the recipe. I grilled the Romaine lettuce heads, by halving them & using Pam spray and salt, pepper, & garlic powder. Put them on the outdoor grill or use a George Forman grill.  I substituted the croutons with sliced roasted almonds.  I used Parmesan, Romano, & Asiago 3-cheese blend. Yummy!!!!!!

Great marinade for the chicken, but we did not like the taste of the dressing
