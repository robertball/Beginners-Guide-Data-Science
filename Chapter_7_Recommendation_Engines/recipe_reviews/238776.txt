Nice and easy.  It wasn't a home run, but it sure fills the bill for a quick dinner made from mostly vegetables. I used a bag each of broccoli slaw and shredded red cabbage.  I also could only find canned sprouts which unfortunately are soggy and limp.  Sure wish we could still find fresh ones.  I used more of the soy, vinegar and hoisin than called for by about half and added snap peas since I knew the sprouts would leave a need for crunch.  The warmed whole wheat tortillas we really good with it.  Will make again on nights when we're short on time.

Great dish! I used broccoli slaw but also added  shiitake mushrooms, brussel sprout shreds and extra carrots.  I had to add a little extra of the sauces and seasonings to match.  I also increased the eggs to 5. Will definitely make this again!

I'm sure the recipe is good, but we just weren't crazy about the  vegetables being chopped so fine. May try again as a stir-fry with chunkier veggies. The sauce was tasty, just didn't seem to be enough of it.

I love this dish and make it when ever I can get my hands on sprouts.   I add chicken and chop cabbage instead of using bag salad.  I also add carrot match sticks.  Awesome recipe, thank you for sharing!

My daughter loved this recipe. I added pork strips to my portion and she had it vegetarian. We left out the bean sprouts because I couldn't find any at the store but it was still good.

This was fast, easy, and tasty.  I bought frozen pancakes to heat up and eat with the veg. However, it does not keep for left overs. I was looking forward to having it for lunch time next day, but the eggs were green. Since My husband doesn't care for Chinese dishes, I will portion the ingredients for single serving meals, which will be easy enough to do.

Tinkered with the sauce amounts by double and cooked it on higher heat more like a stir fry also added some carrots . I will probably try with broccoli slaw next time and likely add half of a Thai chilli pepper for more heat.

This is an ok basic recipe, but a little bland. I added more soy sauce and seasonings, and served it in tortillas.
