Delish and Easy!  The mixture firms up a lot in the refrigerator.  To make sure it held its shape I used a loaf-pan lined with waxed paper. I was a littl worried when I first but when I pulled it out of the pan, positioned it on a platter with some crackers, it looked fantastic!  I always thought pate was really difficult to make... until I came across this recipe!!! Thanks for making me look good!

Delicious. I doubled the cream cheese and it still had a great flavor. The worstechire sauce is the secret flavor here. Thank you.

Very good.  After mixing I rolled it in plastic wrap, but I think next time I would put it in the dish I want to serve it in and chill.  The people who like pate loved this but some people didn't try it, probably because of the presentation.  Still, the flavor was really really good and I will serve again, just in a different way.

This is as close to the one I used to make 20 years ago.  The only thing I do differently is place in a round bowl lined with plastic wrap.  Place in freezer for a couple of hours.  Flip it onto the platter and remove plastic.  I then spread cream cheese over the ball and sprinkle parsley over the whole thing.  Serve with crackers, cocktail bread or even fresh veggies (carrots, celery, etc).  Thanks for the recipe.  This is the closest recipe I've found to my original from years ago.

love this recipe.  I've been making it for a long time - lost the recipe and now found it again.  Thank you, thank you.  The only thing I do differently is that I line a round bowl with plastic wrap, let it set for 2 hours, flip it onto the platter, so that it's nice and round.  I then cover the pate with cream cheese and then fresh parsley - this makes the presentation.

This is the best pate' recipe I've ever tried.  I normally modify a recipe to suit my own taste.  Couldn't think of a thing to add to this recipe.  It's wonderful exactly as is.

This was really good, I made it at work today and a coworker and i ate it on fresh sourdough bread, toasted.  I didnt have chili powder on hand, so I skipped that.  Definately something I would make again.

Just made this for a family weekend.  It was a hit!  Even people who don't like liver sausage treid it and had more!  We have some left over so I'm going to use it as sandwich spread for our lunches this week! Yummy!

This recipe is very close to my mother's recipe. She adds chopped dill pickles and some pickle juice. She also frosts it with cream cheese. This recipe has always been a hit even with friends that have never tried liver sausage before.

It just tasted like plain braunshweiger (sp?).  I even added the whole brick of cream cheese, which bulked it up nicely, but didn't really add to the flavor.  I like plain braunshweiger, so it wasn't bad, I was just expecting something with more pizazz.

This recipe is fantastic.  Everyone loved it.  Even people who frown when you say the word "liverwurst".  It is just delicious.
