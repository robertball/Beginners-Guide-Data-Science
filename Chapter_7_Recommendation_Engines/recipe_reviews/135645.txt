I really want to give this recipe a 3, but my guys loved it so I'm compromising with them by giving 4 stars and whining a bit. As written, there are a couple of problems. First, if you brown your chicken breasts until they are 'no longer pink in the center,' they are DONE; any additional cooking time is overcooking them. I chose to call them done and pour the finished sauce over them, skipping the baking step. Second, there is not enough sauce for 8 chicken breasts. Double it if you are making that many. Finally, I think this recipe is a little involved for the final product. The finished sauce did not bowl me over. It's good - definitely edible, but not something I want to spend an hour making. Browned chicken breasts, bottled vodka sauce, sour cream, and feta would give you arguably more flavorful results in about 20 minutes. Again, my husband and son loved it so thanks for the recipe!

I would give this more stars if possible! My husband and his friend loved this dish - especially the sauce. I only used 3 breasts and kept the rest of the recipe the same. We used the extra sauce over brown rice but it would do really well over pasta as well. The guys were even spooning the sauce over their bread! My hubby asked for it to be added to "our faves".

This chicken has a great sauce!  I did add a little more vodka before simmering the sauce as mine was too thick.  Also, I doubled the garlic and replaced the dried parsley called for with fresh.  We LOVED it!!!  Definitely double the sauce if serving over so mething like pasta or rice.  Will make again and again!  So good! Thanks for the recipe.

I made this as written except that I doubled the sauce portion as others had suggested. I also used goat cheese instead of feta for personal preferences. I made whole wheat penne pasta and added it to the casserole dish for serving. What a combnation!! This chicken and sauce are so tender and flavorful. This was a wonderful change from typical chicken dishes. Everyone raved about this!! Served with whole wheat penne pasta, a loaf of French bread, and any green vegetable you choose, this is the perfect meal..Yum!!!!! Thank you so much for this recipe. We loved it! UPDATE: This recipe should come with a warning. I have many other recipes that are waiting to be tested, but I am having serious cravings to make this again instead. It is so good that you will go through withdrawl and crave it again and again-lol.

Yummy. I used more garlic and added a little cornstarch for thickening. I didn't have quite enough sour cream, but the sauce turned out fine. Also made more sauce because we like it that way.

This was delicious!  I was about a quarter cup short on sour cream and doubled the garlic (because I always do), but otherwise followed the recipe.  Made double the sauce and poured the extra over some gnocchi.  Also used some of the extra sauce as 'gravy' over some egg foo young.  This would make a great pasta sauce as well!

Tried this recipe tonight. Just thought it was okay. The flavor was good, but definitely not a "must have" in the recipe box. We won't be making this again, but worth trying.

First, it takes an exceptional recipe for me to rate it a 5.  My judging criteria: "normal" ingredients, ease pf prep and cooking of the recipe, and of course if the whole family loves the outcome.  This recipe blew away all the criteria!  Easy to make with only having to buy a few ingredients and seriously the whole family really did LOVE it.  I did double the sauce, but only used 4 chicken breasts to start because I didn't want to waste more chicken if it was bad.  (Needless to say, I cooked more chicken to go with the rest of the sauce) Other than doubling the sauce, followed recipe exactly.  Loved the tang that the feta gave the sauce, the garlic and onion still had texture and the tomato paste gave it just enough acidity to balance the richness of the sour cream and feta.  The vodka was undetectable to me, hubby said he tasted it.  (I used a cheaper brand of vodka)  Served with roasted garlic mashed potatoes and french bread.  Hubby thought the sauce would be a good "dip" for the bread as an app-will try that idea out at my work party this week:)  Thank you so much Trudy for an awesome NEW chicken recipe for us!!!!!

this dinner was ok.  i made it exactly like the recipe except i added canned mushrooms.  i think it had way to much sour cream. so if i make it again i would probably use only 1 cup.  you couldn't taste the vodka so i will leave that out too.  if serving over something definitely make extra sauce.

Great recipe!  I made a couple of additions that really gave it some extra flavor.  First, I had some tomato and basil feta cheese in the fridge, so I used that instead.  Excellent addition.  Also, I doubled the garlic and added about 1/2 cup of spinach.  I served the chicken and sauce over rice.  The dish ended up with a deeper flavor profile, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.

WOW!! It was worth the trip to the liquor store to get vodka!! The only thing I did differently was to double the sauce recipe, and use 2 cups of sour cream and 1 cup of fat free plain yogurt. A bit healthier, and the taste was FABULOUS! Restaurant quality. Froze a batch for next week as well.

DELICIOUS!!!!!! I doubled the sauce also and served with al dente penne pasta. A little on the salty side though. I would use low sodium broth next time. This is a "very rich" dish..

Great dinner! VERY easy on the wallet too. I served it with rice and steamed broccoli. (The sauce was great with the broccoli too!)

I ended up using more onion and easily doubled the sauce. I didn't have time to let the sauce cook down for half an hour before putting it on the chicken, and it still came out really well. My husband was raving about it and practically licked the plate. Then he asked if I could make it again tomorrow :)

My husband loved this!  Kept talking about it for days, kept telling me "it's a keeper".  Will be making this again for sure.  Followed the recipe to a T (maybe splashed a little too much vodka...hehe).  Thanks for a great recipe.

This was very tasty. I didn't want to open a can of tomato paste because I had some tomato sauce opened so I used a heaping Tablespoon of that. Next time maybe 2 Tablespoons to replace the tomato paste. Other than that, I added about 1/2 cup of onions. Also, I was on a time crunch so I thickened the sauce with cornstarch. This recipe reminded me of Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo with a hint of feta cheese and sour cream.

Wow this was great!  My whole family loved this, my daughter would take a bite of chicken and then spoon more sauce onto her plate.  The whole the time she was saying "yummy mom this is great!"  The only change I made was instead of all sour cream, I mixed in half fat free sour cream and half low fat plain yogurt.  I also used fresh parsley  instead of dried.  I served it with gnocchi for my husband and I and made rice for my daughters.  Both were good with it, but next time I think I will just serve it with rice.  I will be making this again.

This is off the charts good! I've make it a few times and people all but lick the plate when finished.  I make it with 6 large chicken breasts cut in half which leaves more sauce.  I also use lemon in the sauce.  It gives it an extra kick.

Absolutely delicious. Everything in this recipe, except the feta cheese, is a pantry staple of mine, so it was easy to make on the fly. I substituted extra dry vermouth for the vodka. I reduced the recipe to 2 servings, but I used one whole garlic clove anyway. I really liked the extra garlic.

Personally, I thought this dish was a three, but my husband thought it was phenomenal so I gave it a four. It was a lot of prep. The sauce was good. The chicken was overcooked -- it was a bit dry. I served it over brown rice. My husband hates brown rice but said he would eat it every night if it was served with this sauce. I thought it was okay.

We really enjoyed this dish!  I didn't have tomato paste, so omitted that.  Otherwise, pretty much followed as written.  I think this dish would be terrific with some meats as well, maybe over a steak or with a roast.  May saute up some baby bellas with it too :)

I used 3 chicken breast halves that I pounded, floured and fried in olive oil and then let everyone put on their own sauce - no baking. As for the vodka sauce - I prepped it as written except for doubling the garlic, heaping the tomato paste and reducing the sour cream to one cup.  This was de-lish!  Perfect balance of flavours!

Delicious! Didn't have vodka, so didn't use it. And substituted tomato sauce for tomato paste. The sauce was rich, creamy and full of flavor. Doubled the recipe and there was just enough sauce for chicken and to spoon over rice. Will try making it with vodka next time; might add an extra tang or cut the richness.

This is my new favorite way to make chicken.  I think it's much tastier than the bottled vodka sauce, not to mention I get the peace of mind of not eating factory processed food.  For those that find the sour cream over powering, maybe substitute plain yogurt instead?

We really enjoyed this dish! As suggested I doubled the sauce. Next time I will put the sauce in the food processor before baking, so this way you don't have pieces of onion/garlic/feta, just a preference I think would be better a smooth sauce. Served over whole wheat spaghetti and steamed veggies.

Delicious!! I had a little trouble with the sauce.  It didn't go as smoothly as I thought it should, and it sounded easy.  Over all, it was great.  I made herb roasted potatoe to go with it.  Even better as left overs for lunch!

I thought this was really good!  I made it exactly as written, except I only had six chicken breasts.  It was pretty simple - not a lot of prep work required.  My kids LOVED it, which should earn it two extra stars.  Thanks for sharing!!

I wasn't sure about this to start with but it ended up being great.  I made the sauce ahead of time then just heated it up and served over the top of grilled chicken breasts. Could taste the vodka but it wasn't overpowering. Very glad I gave it a go!

I was going to make chicken parm when I found this recipe. It was FANTASTIC! I only used about 3 chicken breasts so there was plenty of sauce to go on the rice. I also didnt have onions (so I used dried onions) and I didn't have tomato paste (so I used about 2-3 TB ketchup). This was easy and delicious.

The sauce is super tasty, but I agree with other reviewers that it should be doubled.

I found some of the cooking times a bit long, but my stove and oven both run on the hot side.

I doubled the garlic and used gin instead of vodka (didn't have vodka on hand) and it turned out well. I used a different sauce (Rosemary-Merlot) for the potatoes, which added a nice contrast. Also served with steamed broccoli.

delicious! The aroma in the kitchen was mouth watering. I did a few tweaks because I always do. Used leg/thigh and rubbed with some turkish spice before browning. Little more onion, little less sour cream, little more vodka and used home grown chopped orange tomatoes instead of paste. And because I just browned the chicken, it was a full hour in the oven at very low. Flavour combination is very good. I will be making this again and will use with pork tenderloin as well. Thanks for the great recipe!

this was great...only changes: double the sauce and the garlic. (I made it with half the chicken and all the sauce as written for small family...so proportionally doubled the sauce.) Made it as written at first....found it a tad bland. Added another garlic clove and it was just right.

This was okay.  I think it was too overpowering with sour cream.  I made it exactly by the recipe, only I used extra chicken broth instead of vodka.  I don't like liquor in my food.  Maybe the vodka would have made it taste better.  It was worth a try, because it sounded really good.

Too little sauce for 8 breasts.  Might be about right for 2 breasts over pasta.  I didn't have enough sour cream and still found it very thick so I added more vodka and water.  I might keep tweaking this one.

Excellent.  Easy to make and great taste.  I too used the light sour cream and it tasted great.  Next time I'll make the chicken in olive oil instead of butter to cut more calories and fat.

Okay, I will say that I did not like this dish, but I am not a fan of sour cream. My two boys enjoyed it very much. It was flavorful ( a little too rich for my taste) and went really good with garlic mashed potatoes. I love a good cream sauce but this was more sour than I would like.

This is one of the best chicken recipes I've tried.  Was just as good warmed up the second night! (Yes, my husband asked for it a second night in a row)I would get the liquids ready first next time (chicken stock etc) I also only used 1 c. low fat sour cream.

Great Recipe!  I only used 2 chicken breasts but kept the same amount of sauce.  If making the full recipe, I would definately suggest doubling the sauce.  I followed the recipe almost exactly, only changes were doubling the garlic and simmering the sauce for 15 minutes.  I'll be making this again.

I don't like chicken breast that much, but... this recipe is delicious!! I used four small chicken breast and kept the amount of the sauce the same according to the recipe. I used the extra sauce over pasta. This is definitely a keeper. Thank You!

This may look like a double entry.  It's not.  Computer issues the first time and the review was inadvertently submitted before I finished my comments.  

So once again, huge thanks to the recipe author.  Equally giant thanks to those of you who made it and provided feedback.  

After reviewing most of the comments I did make some adjustments.  Didn't bake it at all.  Rather, I started with preparing the sauce on the stove top.  Following hints of others, I doubled the sauce portion of the recipe.  I added more garlic because I love garlic.  And I didn't have enough sour cream, so I substituted half of the sour cream with full fat cream cheese. 

I tried to make the recipe keto-friendly, so used almond flour in place of regular wheat flour.  It didn't thicken, so I gave in and thickened with regular flour.  I just might have added a touch more vodka.  ;-) And for sure I more than doubled the feta.  

Once the sauce was done, I cooked the chicken strips in a frying pan.  When they were barely done, i.e., no longer pink, I poured the now perfect sauce on top of the chicken.  Perfection!!  I served it with steamed cauliflower (still trying to stay keto . . . no doubt would be even better over noodles).

I  don't believe it could have been any better if baked; it definitely was faster; and the chicken was not overdone.  Fabulous dish!  Try it.  You'll love it!

We loved it! I only used four chicken breasts. Being a huge fan of cast iron, I followed the directions until it came time to putting the chicken in another dish. At that point I sat the breasts aside on a plate. I cooked the sauce in the same cast iron pan then added the chicken back in using tongs to make sure the chicken was coated, then put my pan in the oven. Full of flavor! Turned out fantastic! Served with golden mashed potatoes, roasted brussel sprouts and garlic bread.

My husband asks for this dish frequently. I usually at least double the sauce as it's addictive. I've had this with mashed potatoes and different veggie sides but would like to try it with noodles--ooh noodles!

I doubled the sauce and only used 3 chicken breasts, cut in half to make 6.  I did not skimp on the garlic.  Good amount of sauce this way to put over noodles, potatoes, rice, etc.  I tried it with all.  My favorite was with cheese ravioli. So delicious!  Seriously yummy.  A heavy sauce, so maybe I will try other reviewers suggestions and use some Greek yogurt next time.  I didn't think it took too long to make at all, but I like to measure out everything before starting.  So, it is just dump and stir, less chaos.

Meh, it was ok, but I don't think is worth the trouble. It is time comsuming to make, and bottom line it is not that good. 
It was all right to try, but I won't make it again.
The recipe looks a lot more intriguing on paper than in reality.

This recipe is great. My husband is not a big fan of chicken and says that chicken is only eligible for a B. However, when I served him this chicken dish he liked it so much that he actually gave it a B++. I think that is an A without confessing to it being an A. The sauce was flavorful and it is easy to make on a week night. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a change from the  typical chicken breast dishes.

I make this with vanilla vodka. It adds a nice hint of sweetness and gives a good contrast to the tartness of the sour cream and feta cheese. My teenager loves this dish!

I would give this 4 stars but my hubby says 3. I think this was a very good sauce with great flavour. I just didn't simmer for the 20 minutes, not really sure why it requires that much time, when it the goes in the oven. Had baked potatoes with this dish, added sauce to the potatoes! Yum. I  think i will add spinach the next time i make this.

This is delicious, both thumbs up! I served with dauphinoise potatoes, green beans and tenderstem brocolli. I also cooked the chicken in the oven and only did the sauce on the hob, then I poured the sauce over when the chicken was nice and moist - delish! The only thing isthe sauce had slightly dried out at the end so I had to add some water. Also next time I may use a tad more vodka for an extra kick and maybe a touch more chicken borth to keep it form drying out.

Mmm this is pretty good!  I didn't have parsley so I used some dry oregano and basil.  ended up having to add some corn starch in too and extra feta since it was too runny.

This turned out fabulous!! My husband loved it as well. I only used 2 chicken breasts but kept everything else the same. The extra sauce went great over rice. The only thing I may change is adding more garlic next time but I'll definitely be making this part of my rotation!

This was really good. I made a little bit of substitution just to make it more healthy. I used greek yogurt instead of sour cream and only used the 2 Tbls of butter for the sauce. I also didn't have vodka so I omitted that. I did double  the recipe with the exception of the butter kids and hubby ate it up and put sauce on their brown rice and broccoli. I also used more broth. I only brown the chicken in the skillet didn't wait for it to cook fully since I was going to put it in the over. Great recipe!
