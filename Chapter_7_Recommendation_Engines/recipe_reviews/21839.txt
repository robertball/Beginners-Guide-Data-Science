This stuff is addicting!  I made it for a family get together at our house.  My mother-in-law said, "I could eat the whole bowl!" and I agreed with her.  I didn't make it exactly per the directions.  I used a regular size tub of cool whip, about 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts (I didn't measure, just threw some in) and a 10oz. tub of frozen sliced strawberries since that was what I had tucked away in the freezer.  Thanks for such a great recipe!  I will be making this one over and over!

I ended up loving this after making a few changes. I doubled the gelatin and water. Increased the strawberries to a 21 ounce bag (and used sliced instead of whole). I left everything else the same. It made a lot - and did not keep well (probably could serve 10-12). Best if eaten on the day you make it. Really light & luscious!

This is delicious!! I used 2 packets of 2.75 oz. gelatin and next time I would use slightly less whipped topping. Thanks for this great recipe!

I would not waste my time making this receipe again.  Not enough jello, too many nuts, pineapple too mushy.
