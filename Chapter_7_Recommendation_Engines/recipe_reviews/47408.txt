I always add in a tablespoon of flour after it's simmered awhile to make the white sauce a little thicker.  Also, on top I add in either swiss, havarti or cheddar cheese on top... mmmmm (underneath is moz cheese as the recipe states)

this was a great lasagna.  The white sauce sets it apart from others and makes it creamy and delicious.  I used a pound of ground turkey (I always use this instead of red meat) and a pound of italian turkey sausage.  I think the red sauce would be a little bland without some sausage. I didn't realize I was out of eggs so I left it out of the white sauce and it was still fine, not missed.  My family loved this.  The kids ate it right up.  I will make this my new standard recipe.

This was a very yummy lasagna.  I used italian sausage instead of ground beef.  It was a perfect dish to make on a cool weekend and the house smelled great will it was cooking and cooling.  I will make this dish again!

I'm cooking this right now.. someone noted that the cheese sauce was a little soupy.. in this recipe it calls for a quart of milk ... the correction is one quarter cup milk. I just made this mistake and realized how i had to redo this part.. I'm also adding 2 tablespoons sugar to the cheese sauce =)

This was the first lasagna I ever made and it was great. The cheese sauce was a little soupy though. I also added crumbled Italian sausage.

This was sooooo delicious! I did feel guilty, though, because it was so fattening, but my guests loved it, so it was definitely worth the labor involved. I will use this as my lasagne recipe from now on.

I used this recipe the other night, and it was delcious!  We had company over for dinner, and everyone thought it was a hit.  The homemade red sauce is easy to make, and the white sauce makes this lasagna special from others I've tried.  Next time I make it, I will replace the hamburger meat with Italian sausage.

I used sweet italian sausage instead. Go easy on the rosemary...it was a little overpowering! I might use oregano instead next time. I also found the sauce a little runny, I would use less water next time.

It was good. It just didn't have the depth in flavor I was looking for after spending the time. Maybe i have difficult taste buds. However, my family did eat it (even the kiddos), so thank you for the recipe Tammy.

This was very good.  The only thing I did different was to add a little brown sugar to the tomato sauce.

This lasagna is wonderful. I followed the recipe exactly except I used half hamburger and half Italian sausage. I was able to make three 8x8 pans. one to cook and two for the freezer since I am only cooking for two. I had a little bit of white sauce left over so I spread it on top to keep my top layer of noodles from getting hard. Delicious. Thanks Tammy.

This was a lot of food.  We liked it a lot but, it was too much so I gave it to the guy's at my Dad's work.  They loved it.
