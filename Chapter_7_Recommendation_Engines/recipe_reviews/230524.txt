Nearly identical to Kikkoman's "Classic Fried Rice," also from this site.  For the most part I followed the recipe as written (there are infinite variations you could try) except for cooking the egg separately, like a crepe, then rolling it up like a cigar and slicing it, chiffonade-style, for a more authentic presentation.  Just as it is used in "Classic Fried Rice," this could benefit from the addition of some fresh minced garlic.

This is a very nice fried rice dish.  I completely agree with the other reviewers, the bacon definitely gives this an edge over other recipes.  I actually could have used a little more scrambled egg in mine, but it was still delicious.

Made this for Recipe Group...DELICIOUS! I did half the amount of rice and used more peas b/c we love them, but kept all of the other ingredients the same. I think if I were to use the whole 4 cups of rice, then I would def double up on the other ingredients, but that's just my opinion. I used a mix of red, yellow and orange pepper b/c I had them to use up. The guys really enjoyed this...we LOVED the addition of the bacon and bacon grease...it made for a very flavorful dish! This is gonna be my new go-to fried rice recipe...so simple~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Recipe Group Selection:  19, January 2013 – Wonderful recipe.  We loved the flavoring that the bacon added to the recipe.  I very loosely measured the ingredients, although I did use all of them.   We thought the taste of the veggies really came through without being overpowered by the salt in the soy sauce.  Just a nice simple fried rice that paired nicely with pork eggrolls.  Thanks Patty2007 for sharing your version of Fried Rice – it is a keeper.  It was also an excellent choice for Recipe Group.

Great rice dish, the bacon truly makes the dish nice and tasty, cooked the veggies a bit longer than a min. but still left them crunchy. I used sugar snap peas and the whole red pepper. Paired very well with sweet and sour pork.

Made this for Recipe Group.  I did not have any peas, so subbed some grated carrot.  Have never had fried rice with bacon before.  It tasted good when eaten right away; leftovers the next day did not go over so well.  Thanks for posting something different for us to try, Patty2007.

Made this for recipe group. I did not use the bacon(which would not have been a good mix for me) or eggs(allergy) but did use some bacon drippings to fry the vegetables. I doubled the vegetables, but still would have preferred more of them. The addition of some roasted pork at the end gave us 4 main dish servings.

We really enjoyed this recipe as it is very much like what I normally serve. This was a recent Recipe Group selection and I am glad I voted for it. I followed the recipe as written and made my own sweet and sour sauce and served it along side. Thanks for sharing Patty2007!

Great fried rice recipe, the bacon totally makes it!  I followed the recipe with a few minor adjustments. I used 4 slices of bacon instead of 3 and next time I might even use a little more.  I was making this as a main dish so I also added some chicken which I cooked in a little bit of sesame oil before cooking the bacon.  So I cooked the chicken removed it from the pan, cooked the bacon and then followed the rest of the recipe as written.  Definitely a keeper!

THE BEST!  This is truly the best fried rice I have ever had.  I followed the recipe exactly and desired no changes nor were any necessary.  It not only tastes good, it is a beautiful dish!  Did I say it smells delicious while cooking!  A perfect recipe.  Thank you Patty 2007 for sharing!

Just made this for lunch as part of the Recipe Group selection of the week.  This was just delicious, quick, and easy.  First thing out of hub's mouth was "I love the bacon in this!".  Me too.  I used pepper bacon, as that's what I have on hand, and it added a really nice peppery flavor.  I was out of red pepper, so I subbed some diced zucchini, summer squash, and shredded carrot in addition to the peas and onions.  Served with egg rolls.  A hit and a definite do-over.  Thanks for sharing your recipe with AR.

Recipe group selection of 1/19/12.  I've made something similar for years but never thought of adding bacon.  What a good idea.  The best part, aside from it being quick and easy, is it reheats beautifully if you have leftovers.  Thanks Patty, this is a keeper.

I loved it! Did 4 pieces bacon, half red pepper, half green pepper, the peas, no egg, my pref. Few sliced mushrooms, put minced fresh garlic in the bacon grease, then added the rice, which was cold from the fridge of course. Soya last but not least.I did cook the veg's till tender, before adding the cold rice. Followed the recipe except minor changes. Thankyou for the recipe best fried rice I've had!

Of course. Didn't have some ingredients. Fine diced sweet onion instead of green and edamamiinstead of peas! Substituted wild rice with quinona for regular rice to increase fiber and lower carb burden. Ialso added a little sesame oil to the bacon fat. Fragrant, fast, and delicious!

The rice takes longer than 10 minutes to fry. My culinary class made the rice and it took very long to fry and we eventually had to take it and put it on separate plates to serve to the class. It tasted good to everyone but it was supposed to be fry rice and it was just white rice with vegetables.

We loved!  I didn't have all the exact ingredients on hand so I used  package of frozen stir fry vegetables, green bell pepper and diced yellow onions in place of the vegetables listed.  I'll be sure to plan ahead next time but it was delicious any way.  I fixed sweet and sour pork ribs and this fried rice when well with them.  I'll be making this fried rice from now on.  It's so easy and the addition of bacon really makes the dish.  Thanks for sharing.  I did add a bit more bacon to mine because do love our bacon.

I made the recipe as described above with one small adjustment. I added broccoli. It wasn't quite what I expected, although it was tasty but not quite what I wanted. I may make again with some suggestions from below.

We've tried so many times to make fried rice -- this is the first recipe which pleased us both.   Made it exactly as written, with cold day-old leftover rice.

I tend to make extra easy staples to use as part of quick meals during the week, and cooked rice is usually in my fridge. This was incredibly simple and good. My only modification was using two eggs to add a little more richness. After salting to taste, it was incredible for the convenience.

Great easy and fast recipe.  I gave up bacon long ago and no loss here, I made  Korean chicken BBQ separate.  It was great together.
I didn't have peas so I just used about a cup and a half of frozen mixed Chinese  vegetables and used coconut oil.  Also a little more soy sauce.  This will be a regular.

I only had two cups of rice, so reduced the soy sauce but left everything else the same. It was delicious and was enough of a side dish for four adults. Will definitely make this again!

I had to use coconut aminos, I am allergic to soy, it was very good.  I didn't have bacon BUT I DID have bacon fat, I used it to cook the peppers and onions. No peas, I didn't have any. YUM!

Delicious!  Bacon makes it better!  Not authentic but good anyhow.  Will make again for my bacon loving family.  Thanks Patty2007 for a great recipe. :)
