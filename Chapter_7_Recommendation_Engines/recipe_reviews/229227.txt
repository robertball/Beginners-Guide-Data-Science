This cake was wonderfully moist and baked up just perfect, which is hard to do where I live (altitude = 7000).  So happy to find something delicious to make with the Bartlett pears in my Bountiful Basket.  The texture and spices were just right.  I didn't have the grapeseed oil so I had to use vegetable oil and it turned out beautifully.

This is a nice, mildly sweet cake, with a nice moist texture more like old-fashioned spice cake.  The pear flavor doesn't stand out, however, and I disregarded the instructions to mix and mix for 3 minutes after adding the flour.  Also, if you're "creaming" turbinado and grapeseed oil, you can stop wasting your time...oil and sugar with this texture will never cream.  Beating has no effect whatsoever.  I'd give the cake a 4-5 stars, but the instructions about a 3.

It was delightfully yummy and moist. I also layered leftover pear slices at the bottom of the pan to give an upside down cake look. Not very sweet which we liked. I divided the sugar and soaked the pears in one half for 20 mins.

Made as is the first time with gifted pears at Christmas. Loved it and made again with a cup of applesauce to make up pear deficit.  Added raisins as I do with apple cake. Family loved it, wanted recipe.

Loved it.  Was gone in 2 days.  I substituted 1c of whole wheat flour for 1c of white. Cut back on the cloves and nutmeg and added more cinnamon.  Highly recommended.

Old-fashioned flavor with the autumn harvest flavor of pear.  Loved this!
