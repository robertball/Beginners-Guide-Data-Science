This got a 4 because it was so easy, but I did have to make modifications to this recipe.  I altered the recipe to my own tastes/servings as follows:
1 10 0z can tomato soup
1 14 oz can diced tomatoes
1 1/2 soup cans of chicken broth
*kept seasonings same but added garlic powder and onion powder*
1/2 pkg cheese tortellini

this was so good.  chicken broth i think makes a difference - also using tomatoes in it gives it more texture.

This was a very good soup.  I'm not much of a tomato soup eater but, this didn't taste anything like I was expecting.  It was more of an italian tasting soup with all of the spices that you put in. My fiance & I topped this off with some grated parmesean cheese and it was a very nice addition.  Very yummy & super quick & easy to make.

I thoroughly enjoy this soup and make it often!  I use the dry tortellini by Barilla which is inexpensive, tasty and doesn't expire quickly like the refrigerated kind.  I have had better luck boiling the tortellini as directed on the package and then adding it to the soup when it's cooked.  I also enjoy it with some fresh grated cheese on top.  Thanks so much for this recipe!

This was one of the fastest, easiest and tastiest recipies I've used in a while.  If the tortellini isn't left in for too long, it tastes wonderful.  If you aren't big on spices, it also tastes fine without.  I cooked this for about 35 people in my hall for lunch and everyone loved it, and someone else made it another day too.  I highly reccommend this.

This is now my favorite thing to cook.  My mom asks me to cook this about once a month.  It's quickly become "my signature dish."  Thanks so much!  I refer everyone to this site.

This recipe is delicious and freezes well.  The spices really make it taste homemade.  I used Barilla tortelloni, which I'm not hot about - I love Buitoni Mushrooms and Cheese Tortelloni and will try that next time instead.  I also cooked the tortellini separately then added it in afterwards.  I have a sneaking suspicion that if you use some chicken broth instead of water, that this could totally taste homemade.  But everything worked well.  I put everything into single serving containers then froze it for later.  Fabulous!

The kids loved this!  It was very easy and actually pretty good.  I used dried tortellini and boiled it in water for about 8 minutes before adding to the soup.

Great soup and easy!  I did make some changes though.  I used a family size can of tomato soup plus a can of Campbell's Pepper Jack soup.  Instead of water I used a can of Beef Broth and milk. I used 1 t. each of the oregano, basil, and parsley which I thought was plenty.  I also added a can of diced tomatoes, extra tortellini, & about 1/2 C. grated parmesan.  The Pepper Jack soup made it a bit spicy but just right for our family!

Thanks for a great idea.  Instead of making a soup, I used only one can of soup and prepared it with half and half.  I added garlic powder, basil and pepper.  When it was done, I tossed in a large handful of freshly grated parmesan.  Result...no fuss or bother tomato-fredo sauce.  Not gourmet, but it was a nice side dish for a weekday family dinner. Thanks again.

this was delicious!  I followed the recipe all the way through except at the end when I served the soup in bowls I topped it with chopped cilantro and parmesean cheese!  It was amazing with the added kick of the cilantro!  Will definitely make again!

We liked this!  It really couldn't be easier, either.  My changes:  Used half chicken broth, half milk instead of water, 1 t italian seasoning, 1 t basil, 14 oz. diced tomatoes, 19 oz. tortellini, 6 oz. fresh spinach.  Topped with garlic croutons and parmesan cheese.  Next time I will use 1 T basil, as the recipe states.

I would leave out the herbs and just add tortellini to the soup. Herbs in the tomato soup just didn't mesh well at all.  Tasted like a very watered down flavorless tomato sauce.

This was really good.  I used only a teaspoon of basil and meat tortellini since that was all I had. I will make this again.

This was really easy ad yummy But the spices were pretty powerful so I think next time around I will cut all the spices back by half. Especially the black pepper. Served it with rolls and parmesean cheese...SO GOOD!

This soup was very good. If I make it again I will cook the tortellini first then add it to the soup.

Super fast and really easy to make.  I used half and half with the tomato soup to make the soup base really creamy.  Even my picky husband loved it!

Good and easy. I recommend using less oregano; it overpowers the other ingredients.

i made a version of this using things in my fridge and pantry--prepared a package of 9 oz italian sausage tortellini as directed, then drained. Added one 18.7 oz can of tomato bisque soup (not concentrate) and half a can (about 7 oz) of diced tomatoes (the kind that already has basil, oregano, and garlic seasoning in it). Since the soup and tomatoes were already seasoned, I only added a dash more of italian seasoning. Simmered for five minutes, then topped with shredded parmesan cheese and served with 5-cheese texas toast (the frozen kind). An easy hearty meal in about 10 minutes!  This made enough for 2 adults and a toddler.

This turned out pretty well, I followed the recipe, except I only used half the amount of basil as it seemed excessive and added 1/2 tsp garlic salt as well as diced tomatoes. I also used spinach tortellini, instead of white. It was pretty good, quick , and easy  I give it 4 stars; I made it for my boyfriend and a girlfriend who was over. They both LOVED it. It did have a bit of a canned taste, but other than that I thought it was healthy and delicious.

I made it spicy, and my HUSBAND LOVED it! My Alterations: 1. family size can  of tomato Soup (prepare not by adding 1 can of water, but by pouring 1 cup of water -with a chicken bouillon cube already dissolved in it- and milk to the top of the can), 2. Spices: 1 teaspoon each of Oregano, Basil, Parsley; and 1/2 teaspoon each of Garlic Powder, Onion Powder, 3. 1/2 can of Rotel, and 4. 2 (9 oz.) packages cheese tortellini. Delicious, Easy, Minutes!!!

This was tasty, but really really thick. Next time, I'll dilute it a bit, but otherwise, very good. The spices compliment the tomato flavor very well. Thanks Stacey.

What a great combination! I used organic tomato soup from Trader Joe's--just to cut down on the sugar that's in condensed tomato soups. Delicious and very filling!

Very good.  When I've served this I use more Tortellini than the recipe calls for and it is more of a side dish than a soup.

Everyone in my family really enjoyed this.  The tortellini was a special treat for all but my 5 year old son who did not like it (the tortellini; he liked the soup itself).  It was super easy and fast to make which is always good for last minute dinner ideas and lunches!  I will make this again.  I'll just keep more tortellini for the rest of us instead of giving it to my son!

This is pretty exceptional!  I ended up using a 28oz can of condensed tomato soup, and ended up adding 2 to 2 1/2 teaspoons of each spice (I accidentally screwed up my conversions!) but the spice was not too much for me.  I used a 1 kg bag of fresh cheese tortellini.  This recipe took more like an hour to cook and prepare because the pasta was still leathery...but well worth the wait.  Not much of a tomato soup fan but fantastic!  Stirred in some fresh chopped onions when adding the spices...to add some crunch! 

Thank you!

This recipe was kind of blah and I didn't really care for the choice of spices.  I think if I make it again, I will tinker with it and use less spices...and not necessarily the ones listed in the recipe.

I made this soup, and even though we loved the flavor, both my husband and I were up all night with heartburn...We found the spices to be very strong.  So the next time, I cut the amount of spices in half and it was perfect.

This is a super-easy, satisfying soup.  I do not like tomato soup and I have to say this is absolutely delicious. I double the recipe and add 1-2 cloves of minced garlic and some frozen meatballs, if I have them on hand.  Add shredded Parmesan on top, and you have a hearty meal!

We had this last night. It was good, but I didn't really taste the spices. My kids loved the addition of tortellini in the soup.  We had the traditional grilled cheese with this and it made a nice meal. Thanks for the recipe!

Another meal my 9 year old daughter won't eat. Boy, is she getting picky. My husband and I really liked it. My husband said it was to creamy so next time I will add water or chicken broth instead of milk. The spices gave the soup a good flavor. Thanks for posting this easy recipe.

Tastes just what it sounds like.  If you like tomato soup and if you like tortellini, you'll like the combo here.  I cooked one full 19oz frozen package of tortellini for three minutes, heated 2 cans of ready-to-serve Progresso tomato basil soup without adding any of the extra spices and combined them.  For a tiny bit of flair, I sprinkled shredded Parm on top.  Good quick meal.

I made this without the tortillini because DH and I were 'a little hungry'. It was quite good and my hubby who does NOT like milk in his tomato soup said it was 'quite good', high praise for him. I will definitely make this again.

11-21-07  This is wonderful.  My family wouldn't even consider tomato soup.  I made this and they loved it.  I add some diced tomatoes from a can just because we like tomatoes.  I had a tomato soup at a restaurant and there were bits of tomato in it so I added it to this one.

This was a great. A nice way to improve upon tomato soup. I left out the basil, oregano, and parsley. I used a dried onion mix and garlic instead.

Realy, really average.  I was looking forward to this soup for an easy, yummy mid-week meal.  It had a strange texture--too thick and milky.  Also, the tortellini didn't cook well--too chewy.

Very easy and very tasty. I added a touch of cayenne pepper to give it some zip. I recommend doubling it so you can have some left over. The original recipe only calls for half a tortellini package anyway.

This was surprisingly good and very easy.  We love tortellini so we'll eat it in anything.  I added hot red pepper instead of black which was a little hot for me but my husband loved it.

This is an OK idea, putting tortellini in tomato soup. I may try that again. However, it was overkill on the spices, and I didn't even put in the full amounts. You might want to just sprinkle in the spices to taste instead of putting in the amounts listed.

This is fantastic as listed and also great as a start to a more robust soup. I add in garlic, homemade meatballs, fresh chopped spinach along with the tortellini or ravioli. Then I serve it with grilled cheese made with mozzarella or provolone.  My family loves it.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

Cut recipe in half. Didn't have the above soup, so I used 1(18.7 oz) Campbell's HOME STYLE Harvest tomato soup w/Basil . Also added a dash of Italian Seasoning  The only changes I made.
First tomato base soup I've ever like, much less loved and see potential for experiments.

Thank you!!

LOVE THIS!! I changed it up just a little. I put only 1 tsp of all the spices except pepper I cut in half. I also use cheese stuffed mini ravioli.  this is defiantly a keeper, my 4 yr old even loves it.

Tastes even better if you cook a little bit of cream cheese in it

I found this recipe in one of the Allrecipes cookbooks. My husband and I really liked this...very simple, easy and quick. Plus we were having a very cold day here in PA, so it was good to have some thing warm.  I did add extra tortellini.  Thank you for such a great recipe!!

This is awesome!  It's also good if you add chunks of kielbasa with the recipe.

5 stars for ease and 4 1/2 for taste! I accidently added the entire package of tortellini, but it ended up great! I also sprinkled some italian cheeses on each bowl before serving. My kids are now asking when we will have it again. It would go well with a nice ceasar salad on the side. Enjoy!

Everyone liked this one.  I made it with frozen tortellini and that seemed to work well too.

I changed the ratio of the herbs. I think I lessened everything to my taste, and added chopped fresh tomatoes! 
Thanks for the great recipe!

This one is between a 3 and 4.  It was very good as a once in a long while dish.  I put croutons over it which worked out great and made some garlic bread out of leftover hamburger buns.  The combination worked very well.  I think it was just a little heavy.
