Delicious!  I used white kidney beans instead and it was just as good!  Sure to be a crowd pleaser.

Delicious! I have been using allrecipes.com for years, and this is only the third recipe I have rated 5 stars. This is unbelievably good considering the simple ingredients. The fresh lime juice and basil are key. I used fresh corn, cherry tomatoes, and basil from my garden. What a wonderful way to use up summer garden bounty. I made it once with fresh chives from my garden instead of onion, and it was wonderful.

I used white cannellini beans, an 11oz can of summer sweet corn, dried basil and left out the lemon zest.  Quick prep (I did let it steep overnight).  Very refreshing, healthy side dish.

Once again out of consideration for Hubs' sensitive innards, I switched celery for the corn.  Normally I rate recipes higher than he does but on this occasion that was reversed.  He found this a lot more palatable than I did.  As for me, I didn't think it all that enhanced from the regular ol' can of beans.  Also, I didn't care for the lime juice here and would have preferred lemon.  Extra vegetables would have been nice for flavor and interest as well as some seasoning - fresh herbs maybe, garlic salt or fresh garlic.  An okay starting point, but that's about it, at least for me.

Very good and refreshing! I used black beans and corn, lime juice with a dash of red wine vinegar, S&P, and some oregano flakes.

Very good and beautiful too.  I loved the lime in this.  I used pinto beans because I dislike kidney beans (I bet the white would be good though).  I used a garlic clove instead of an onion.  Also just needed 1/2 TBS. of oil.

Really healthy and fresh. I used a can of black beans and a can of small white beans and about 1c of leftover steamed edamame. Used 2 ears of leftover corn cut off the cob, and used the zest and juice of a lime with the olive oil. I also used red onion as my onion of choice. Very light and refreshing salad....travels well and did not need to worry about a mayo based salad on a hot day. Will make again. Thanks!

I loved this refreshing, healthy salad. I used frozen corn, lime rind & green onions - it wasn't a hit with my husband (meat & potatoes man) or children as much - but I thought it was worth making again, just for myself!

Yum!  I used a red onion because that was what I had on hand and boy, did it make the salad look pretty.  It does taste better the second day, but I couldn't stop eating it after I mixed in the lime juice.

This is delicious! I used garbanzo beans instead and also added in a bit of crushed red pepper, garlic powder (want to try minced garlic next time) and some goat cheese. It was so yummy!

every time I make this, at least 1 person asks for my recipe.  It's seriously PERFECT for a hot summer day! And the basil is the best part!! Make sure you use fresh.  It just won't work if you don't!!

Didn't have light read beans, so I used dark kidney beans.  Added a little more corn than called for and a can of "italian" diced tomatoes with some fresh cherry tomatoes.  I thought the salad was great.  I needed a lot of salt and pepper for my taste and my husband thought the onion was a little too much, but my 11 month old ate it up, my 5 year old picked around the tomatoes, but liked the rest.  Great flavors!

Delicious! I was hunting through looking for a recipe to have with lamb chops and this was perfect. I used four bean mix and it was a wonderful side dish.

Very easy and delicious recipe.  I substituted red onions, lemon istead of lime (although I would stick with the lime) and cilantro instead of basil because that is what I had on hand and it was yummy.  I'll definitely make it again.

This bean salad is pretty good.  Next time, I think I'll use cilantro instead of basil to make it taste really fresh.

I had a can of butter beans in the cupboard and added it to the recipe (in addition to the kidney beans).  To compensate, I added some extra corn, tomatoes, onion and lime juice.  I ended up with a *lot* of salad, but it tastes great!

Using fresh basil & tomatoes from my garden made all the difference. Like all simple dishes, this dish will taste best with only good quality ingredients. I did use canned (organic) beans though! It was excellent and so fast to make!!!

So good. I'm not a fan of onion (raw) so I left out- still very yummy. I did fresh corn (boiled and cut off with knife) and fresh basil (of course). This is going to be my dish of the summer, for reals!

I love bean salads, and this one did not disappoint.  Light and filling, it will be great for my dinner tonight and lunch at work tomorrow.  The basil gave it much needed color and someone mentioned using green onions, that would have worked well too.  I added a small jar of artichoke hearts.

Very easy and very yummy!  I made a few changes:  I used half an onion, one diced fresh roma tomato, left out the lemon zest and olive oil (it was plenty moist), and used dried oregano to taste.

Excellent!  A wonderful refreshing salad.  The fresh lime juice and basil are a must.  I thought this was best right after preperation.  I've made this three times, each time making more.  Leftovers are good but tend to get somewhat soggy sitting in the fridge.

I never actually got to taste this so this is my niece's rating as she ate most of it. Without the oil this counted as "free" food on her Slimming World diet. I used white kidney beans, lemon juice because the lime I had didn't look too well left out the salt and olive oil and used plenty of black pepper. My niece absolutely loved it, I had to give her the recipe to take home with her. Many thanks.
