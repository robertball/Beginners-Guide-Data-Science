As I've mentioned in other reviews I've left for ice cream on this site, I am from Wisconsin, and we like our ice cream (frozen custard) rich, smooth and custardy! So, scaling this down to 6 servings to fit my 1-1/2 quart ice cream maker, I used 2 cups heavy cream, 1 cup half and half and 2 eggs. Beat the eggs on medium speed for a minute or two, gradually add 3/4 cup sugar, then mix well for another minute or so. I added  2 tsp. of vanilla, and 3/4 tsp. peppermint extract. What I got was a rich, velvety, delicately mint flavored frozen custard.  The subtle mint flavor was perfect for us, although die-hard mint lovers may want to increase the amount of peppermint extract by half. I did use the miniature chocolate chips as the recipe directs--hubby not only doesn't mind the tiny bits of crunchy chocolate, he actually prefers it that way! It gives the ice cream a little interest and contrast in textures. A heads up for those who want to make this more calorie friendly by using reduced fat milk or cream--if you use lower fat dairy products you will definitely compromise both mouth feel and richness. Reduce the fat content enough and you'll end up with a grainy, icy result. My proportions of cream and half and half provide the velvety rich smoothness and flavor without leaving a greasy mouth feel. On it's own or on top of a fudge brownie, this ice cream is goood!

Mint chip ice cream is hands down my faaaaaavorite ice cream, so I was excited to try this! VERY easy to make and I always have all the ingredients on hand. The only change I made was to the choco chips--I finely chopped up a large bar of chocolate instead. Next time I will make a few changes 1)Add only 1/2 tsp vanilla 2)add about 3/4 tsp peppermint 3)will shave the chocolate rather than chop it (so the chocolate will actually melt in your mouth when you eat it)...and these changes are for personal tastes only. Even as the recipe stands it really is a refreshing, minty ice cream. Super after a heavy meal...or any time really!

Update: I attempted to decrease the fat by using 1/2 and 1/2. Won't do that again. It makes it gritty and grainy and not a good texture. BUT by shaving the chocolate it literally will melt in your mouth (must use milk choc tho) and deceasing the vanilla to 1/2 tsp and mint to 3/4 tsp makes it mellow minty--YUM! This is a KEEPER recipe. Thanks!

We had issues with the peppermint extract in this recipe.  I was looking for something that tasted like the kind of mint chocolate chip ice cream you buy in the store, but it did not.  My husband said it tasted "weird".  We tried again, this time with mint extract instead of peppermint, and what a difference.  Much better with mint extract!

This was fabulous!  Better than store-bought.  I did substitute whole milk for the 2% just because I had some that I wanted to use up.  For the chocolate, I used a bar of Ghirardelli semi-sweet chocolate that I chopped up using my Pampered Chef food chopper.  I tried chopping the chocolate in the food processor, but it just pulverized some of it and left the rest in big chunks.  The key to this ice cream is getting the chocolate in small chunks...almost like shavings.  Big chunks are too hard to bite into when it's frozen.  Will definitely make this again!

This ice cream is REALLY good. I also made Cookies 'n Cream ice cream instead of using chocolate chips I used crushed oreo's and i used vanilla extract in the place of the mint extract. It was also very delicious!

I don't understand all the raters who changed this recipe and then gave it 5 stars, or didn't like it, said they would change it next time and still gave 5 stars.  I have made a lot of ice cream over 30 years, and this is the only batch I have ever not liked. Mini chocolate chips were waxy, hard and gritty. The mouth full of grit made it impossible to taste any creaminess in the base. I should add that my husband is a chocolate chip freak and will eat just about anything with chips on or in it.  I used Schilling peppermint flavor, and even cutting it down to 3/4 tsp., it tasted weird not minty. Let me not forget...way too salty. If you made and liked a different recipe in place of this, please point us to the one you actually made and give this the mark it deserves unaltered. If you think your changes rate a 5, just put that in your own comments, not the rating please.

Delicious and easy.  I used whole milk instead of 2%. I put regular choc. chips in the blender so I had tiny bits of chocolate as well as some larger pieces. Every bite was full of chocolate, it didn't clog up the ice cream maker, and the chocolate didn't turn into frozen pebbles, like whole chips tend to do.

Great recipe!  I have made this several times with different variations.  I most recently used low fat half and half and high-protein skim milk in order to cut down the fat but keep the creaminess.  It was great - not too icy for very low fat ice cream!

My daughter and I made this for our family this Memorial Day Weekend.... EVERYONE loved it. THANKS FOR SHARING. 
It was so easy and froze well. Everyone raved about it - I personally didn't like the mini choc. chips, I preferred leaving them out and adding Choc. syrup. I think I might try using Milk Choc chips next time (putting them through the food processor so they are little).

AWESOME! I made this exactly as the reciped stated, except that I doubled the recipe. I'm glad that I did because this is soooo good! I was surprised at how creamy it came out with using 2% milk. I made this for Father's Day for my husband because he like mint chocolate chip icecream and it was a hit with the little ones, too. Thanks for the recipe!

So tasty and soooo good! I used crushed oreos in mine in place of the chocolate chips (because ben and jerry's mint chocolate cookie is my favorite!). Other than that I followed the recipe to a T and it was amazing. I wanted to make a quick peach cobbler ice cream a few days later and couldnt find a thing so i used this recipe, uped the vanilla to 1.5tsp and omitted the mint and chocolate added graham crackers and peaches and...AMAZING, then last night again omitted the chocolate and mint and used the base to make coffee ice cream (+1 packet starbucks via) w/brownie chunks and my husband said it was the best ever! Love this recipe as a mint recipe and as a base to make other things :)

Could not have been any more delicious! I used Fat Free Half & Half instead of 2% milk. It was creamy, velvety, soft and better than anything I could have purchased. I added mini white chocolate chips as well as mini dark chocolate chips. One-quarter cup combined is plenty. For those who prefer a more pronounced mint flavor, add an extra 1/2 teaspoon of extract as the original recipe is mild.

Made it exactly as stated & it was terrible. I've tried at least 50 ice cream recipes from about 7 ice cream cookbooks & while some were better than others they were all tasty enough that they were gone in a day or two. nobody wanted to eat it. I just moved so I didn't want to dig out my cookbooks & came here for a recipe - almost 400 reviews & 5 stars, this had to be a winner! I'm sorry I didn’t read the reviews, I now see most of the people who loved this had made crucial changes. There are only a few ice cream base recipes - it’s actually the added ingredients for flavor that make the difference. The peppermint is too strong (used McCormick’s), rather than a smooth mint taste it’s more like eating frozen toothpaste. I thought the salt would be fine because I’ve used it in ice creams before, but this tasted salty, which is fine for a recipe like salted caramel, but in a mint ice cream it’s just awful. And those mini chocolate chips (used Nestle’s), they were a bit hard & weird tasting right after making the recipe, then after freezing they became really hard, like eating gross little pebbles. So rather than mint chocolate chip ice cream this was more like salty toothpaste with pebbles ice cream. Sorry, 1 star.

I have made this ice cream a few times now, always exactly as written, and every single time it comes out absolutely, incredibly delicious!  We've even made it for company or to take to potlucks, and every single time, we get rave compliments about how good it is.  As I write, I am making another batch to celebrate the 4th of July (making ice cream has become an Independence Day tradition for our family), and I am looking forward to digging into it after our big meal this afternoon.   Couldn't be easier or more delicious, and I LOVE that it doesn't have raw eggs in it!  I was pregnant the first time I made this, and have preschoolers helping me to eat it up, so raw eggs were a worry for me and a deciding factor in choosing this recipe the first time around.  Obviously, I have not been disappointed!  :)

I really hate to give this fewer than five stars (it was very tasty and the recipe worked flawlessly), but ... it was kinda salty.  I appreciated what the salt brought to the table (literally!), but if I make this again, I will reduce the salt ... perhaps by half.

Made this for my daughter--her favorite ice cream--and she said to rate it 5, for sure. I would probably rate it 4, but only because I think shaved chocolate would be better in it than chocolate chips--even the mini ones get too crunchy when frozen. I used half-and-half and 1% milk with fine results. Great flavor!

I used shaved chocolate instead of chocolate chips.  Makes it more like the Blue Bell variety (for those from Texas).  Was good right out of the ice cream maker, but even better when fully frozen.

I hate to knock such an easy recipe that had so much potential, but the amount of mint (I used "mint extract" not "peppermint extract") was overwhelming.  The hubby said it tasted like toothpaste at first bite (not good, and we are mint chip aficionados, btw).  Also, it was too much cream, or not enough of something else.  I've made custard style ice creams with 1:1 cream and milk that didn't taste like cream (or eggs) and this was almost like eating mint flavored butter (no joke).  It was not good.  I'm sorry to say.  Three stars is generous for ice cream I had to throw straight in the trash.  Oh well, might try again with less cream and less mint, but then of course, it's not this recipe anymore.

I made this ice cream for a pot luck and everyone raved about it.  There was a speaker at the meeting who mentioned the ice cream in her talk to help emphasis her point.  Her talk was interupted at one point as one diner going back for seconds spontaneously blurted out, "This ice cream is delicious!"  Someone told me after the meeting that it was the hit of the potluck.  I used whole milk instead of 2%, and I grated semi-sweet chocolate bars on a grater.  It gave a nice chocolate taste in every bite.  The texture was wonderful.  I'm sure I'll be making this again.

Have made a few times and each time perfect. Now that fall is upon us, and winter will be here soon, thinking broken candy canes added will be a nice touch.

Compared this recipe to Ben & Jerry’s Homemade Ice Cream & Dessert Book, and modified this recipe as follows: (i) 2 cups fat free half & half for the 2% milk, (ii) added 2 large eggs, (iii) increased peppermint extract to 2-1/4 teaspoons, (iv) omitted salt, and (v) used 3/4 cup shavings from Ghirardelli semi-sweet chocolate bar PLUS 1 cup coarsely chopped Oreo mint cookies. Opted for 5 drops green food coloring. Added the crushed Oreos during last 2 minutes of churning. Truly decadent and delicious!

I live in Japan and I love mint chocolate chip ice cream. We went shopping and found tiny 20 gram bags of rock salt for about $2 each -- the caviar of salt I guess -- so that was out. It was table salt or nothing. We bought 'milk'. It was white. We found something called 'fresh creme' and figured we were in the ballpark. Vanilla, no problem. Chocolate chips, no problem Mint, problem. It was mint tea, or creme de menthe and alcohol won. Say back to the kitchen. We bought to big bags of ice which ended up giving us half of what we needed. They say too many cooks spoils something, I think. Especially when one puts the salt in, and then checks the email, and then one's wife puts the salt in -- to help out. Half way through, and time to throw the chips in we have a taste test. The kids were waiting anxiously. I think I made the same face I make when I down a shot of tequila and lick the salt. Their beaming faces turned dark -- what did you do to the ice-cream, Daddy? I told them we were making 'adult' ice-cream and not to get their hopes up. I finished off the creme de menthe and opened a beer and watched the ice-cream maker spin for the last ten minutes. I put on some blues. So we are done. Everybody had a spoon and dug into the canister. Tequila shots faces all around. But my ten-year-old digs her spoon in again and tells us it's OK. We all go at it and after each bite it just got better. Will try it again with half the salt. I know it will be great.

For creamier ice cream, substitute 1/3 of a cup of corn syrup for 1/2 cup of sugar. You still add sugar, just 1/2 cup + 2 tablespoons. This is a GREAT recipe!!!

Awesome recipe! It came out really well, I used just under the whole teaspoon of peppermint (I dont like it too strong). I also only had to keep it in the ice cream maker about 30 minutes total.

Pretty good.  My family raved about it.  It whipped up very light and fluffy in the ice cream maker.  Stirred in crushed Oreo cookies instead of chocolate chips when transferring it from the ice cream maker to the container.  Will make again.  Thanks for the recipe.

I am crazy for this ice cream! I use 1% milk instead of 2%, because it's what we keep on hand. I heated the sugar (we use demerara, a larger grained sugar) with 1 cup of milk until disolved. I had to double the peppermint extract and it's still not too minty. I am not a fan of chocolate chips in ice cream, so I used chocolate sandwich cookies instead -- at least 15, chopped in my Pampered Chef Food Chopper. I can't get enough of this!

Wow.  This recipe is fantastic.  The only changes I made were to substitute 2 ounces of shaved high quality dark chocolate for the choccolate chips, and to cut back on the salt.  I served it with a dark chococlate cake for a friend's birthday.  Everyone raved, and my husband requested that I make it for his birthday this weekend! Don't let others sway you - use the peppermint extract.  Other minty flavors would not be anywhere near as good.  Update - I made this again, but with crushed oreos instead of the chocolate.  Mmm, mmm, mmm.  Both ways are great.

I've made this several times.  It comes out great.  Sometimes I sub whole milk or half-and-half for the 2% milk,  I store the mini chocolate chips in the fridge so they are ready for ice cream.  My other change is increasing the mint extract to 1.5 tsp.  Thank you Darryn for the recipe.

AMAZING!  So simple, so refreshing, the perfect way to cool down on a hot summer day.  FYI for those folks who are looking for a way to make this without an ice cream maker, the $25.00 to buy a 4 qt maker is well worth the money once you've had this.

Yum!  I made this for the fourth of July and it was great!  I took the advise of some and didn't use quite as much peppermint extract; my husband thought it was perfect, but I thought it could use a little more.  Next time, I will follow the recipe exactly and see how we all like it.

The flavour of this ice cream is yummy, and adding the green food colouring makes it look store bought. However, it never froze to more than ice milk for us, a problem we have not had before with our ice cream maker. While it was delicious, it was too thin, and next time I will use all cream probably to make it thicker.

DELICIOUS!!! I used skim milk instead of 2% and light cream instead of heavy. I changed the servings to 6 to fit my 1 1/2 quart ice cream maker. This was seriously the best mint chocolate chip ice cream I have ever eaten.

I would say half the peppermint extract. My husband loves nothing more then mint chip ice cream, but fresh mint extract tastes a lot stronger. Other the that, everything was perfect and it was a huge hit at the BBQ.

The only mint essence the closest grocery store had was a mixture of spearmint and peppermint. That's the only alteration I made to this recipe. It was ridiculously easy - it took about 5 minutes to mix. The end result was good - but the spearmint made the flavor a bit different than what I'm used to (obviously no fault of the recipe). The texture was amazing. The mini chocolate chips were just the right size and amount.

I plan on trying this recipe again with some different essences for different flavors. I just bought some orange essence. I plan to try that instead of mint and to replace the chocolate with Craisins. We'll see how that works out . . .

This was delicious!!!!  I find it is just like the light creamy ice cream I grew up with in north Jersey.  Unbelievably easy re ipe to make in my kitchen aid ice cream maker.  My extended family cannot believe that I am making this at home.  Better than Breyers mint choc definitely. 
Also, I used half n half instead of heavy cream with o impact on the taste.

I've made this ice cream a handful of occasions and it's been a hit every time!  This is a very versitile recipe.  Just substitute your favorite ice cream ingredients for the peppermint, food coloring and chips.  I've made straight vanilla, strawberry (adding 1 1/2 cups of pureed strawberries) and chocolate (stir in 1 cup chocolate syrup, melted chips or powder before putting in ice cream maker).  Makes just enough mix for my 2 Qt Cuisinart.

I absolutely adore mint.  I grow a number of varieties just to have it for food and beverages.  That said, the mint flavoring in this ice cream was so overwhelming it was rendered virtually inedible.  Add to that that the chocolate chips were rock-hard frozen chunks..........we are going to try it again with changes, and hopefully it will be better!  Will update at that time!

We make this ice cream but take it a step further. I use skim milk for the 2% and whole milk for the cream. We also use Andes mints (finely chopped) for the chips. The ice cream is very light and the extra mint kick...from the Andes mints MAKES it special...

Yum yum yum!!!! I made this last night after visiting an ice cream shop that was closed. It definitely satisfied my craving! Best of all, it was amazingly easy! Next time I might use a little bit less mint extract. It was on the border of being overpowering, but was still delicious!

I've tried quite a few ice cream recipes and this was hands down the best one I've made for flavor and consistency. Followed the instructions exactly (maybe added in a little more peppermint extract) and used Baker's Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chunks. Everyone loved it!

First off, my modifications:  1) substituted whole milk for the 2%. 2) used mint extract instead of peppermint.  The underlying vanilla recipe is really the crown of this recipe. It is good just by itself, or great to add flavor too!  The mint chocolate chip is absolutely the best!!! Ask most people, and they will tell you that vanilla, chocolate, or mint chocolate chip is their favorite. This recipe basically gives you all three...  Thanks for sharing!!!

Thanks A LOT for this WONDERFUL recipe ! I have had an ice cream maker for about a year now since when im "experimenting " with ice cream recipes .. I 'll have to say this is the best one i tried so far , because whoever tasted this, loved this . I made this twice so far once with whole milk in stead of 2 % , and once with the skimmed as the recipe asks for , both were great although i think i like the skimmed milk one better . I also added a little more then 1 teaspoon of peppermint extract the first time ( the bottle was at its end so i poured the rest to finish it )Not a great idea since the peppermint taste was too sharp , almost bitter then ( although no one else but me seemed to care ) . So i would suggest sticking to the exact recipe , normally i dont give lots of credit to the 'easy ' recipes , except for this one ! 
I will sure make this one many more times , now i wonder if it will work for a cookie dough ice cream ? :) I'll let you know ! (UPDATE : Not great as chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream base, i'll stick to the original ) .
Oh btw , for food coloring : I add 9 green and 3 yellow drops , and i definitely recommend it ! Looks exactly like store bought , a true mint color .

Yummy but NEEDS LESS SALT!  I don't know about you, but I don't like my ice cream to taste "salty."  I also added a couple more drops of green food coloring so it would look more like the ice cream parlor kind.  Tastes a lot like Baskin Robbins - delicious.

This was really good ice cream! I got an ice cream maker for Christmas and finally got around to using it tonight. I modified - 4 Cups whole organic milk, 1 cup Domino Stevia/Sugar blend and cruddy melting chocolate I had laying around. I also used mint extract and a little dried crumbled mint herb I had on hand as well as the other ingredients. It turned out fabulous. My suggestions if you use to Stevia/Sugar blend is to cut back. I am going to try 1/2 - 3/4 next time. Mom didnt think it was too sweet. Boyfriend and I felt it was. The mint extract was also a little over powering. I might cut that back a little next time as well. To save some extra calories I used just milk rather than heavy cream. It turned out with a reasonable consistency. Kudos for the original ingredients- I modified to what I had in the house already and it still turned out really good. Another thing I learned, is the quality of chocolate makes a big difference. I learned for next time to not use cheap melting chocolate in ice cream. :-)

Oh, one last note- My ice cream maker didnt come with rock salt. I used sidewalk salt that I had in the garage and it worked perfect! Save the $ and buy it at the hardware store.

Recioe good, although the amount of chips (I really do like chocolate!) was 2-3x too much. Ice cream production needed help in my hands, however. The mix never really generated the smooth texture I expected from this highly rated recipe when done in my Cuisinart unit. It was icy and actually never did fully freeze (salt?) when left over night in my freeeeezer. Being a polymer chemist and not a cook, I thought the mix needed aerating before the effort to freeze it. I believe that this is the commercial way (aerate and quick freeze to prevent large crystal formation). So I made a second batch and whipped the mix to make it foam(y) with a mixer. Foams keep the water spread out on the bubble surfaces instead of allowing it to collect in puddles to freeze before being spread. It's the order of the process that is the key. Then I put it into the Cuisinart unit. It soon gave a nice creamy blend even without further "setting". After being in the freezer over night the dessert was still non-icy and smooth. Muuucccchhhh more to my liking (and my wife's!) than the non-whipped effort. But, of course, I'm just a scientist and not a chef.

Yummy.  I followed other reviewers’ advice and use mint extract and slightly decreased the vanilla extract.  Also, I used 1% milk and it worked out very well.  While I’ll admit it wasn’t as rich and creamy as Richardson’s ice cream, it was very respectable.

Great recipe but I did make some changes based on my preferences.
I have a six quart White Mountain so I always make a larger batch.  
For this recipe I used 2 qts heavy whipping cream, 2 qts Half & Half.
Used one cup sugar for each quart of liquid. 
Used 1.5 egg yolks per qt of fluid.
Heated the cream and H&H in a large pan.  Placed the six yolks into a bowl and whipped 'em.  When cream was about 160 I took a cup of it and slowly poured it into the whipped yolks while whipping them some more.  This is called "Tempering".  If you don't do this and pour the yolks into the hot mix you get an "Egg Flower Soup" effect.

Pour eggs into cream and add sugar and salt (1/2 tsp per qt) while whisking.  Heat until it coats spoon.  Remove from heat and cool pan in sink of cool water.

Pour mix into churn.  Add 3 TBL MINT extract and green dye as needed.  Taste mix and add more Mint if needed.

Chill one hour in fridge before churn.

I used Lindt or Geribaldi 72% cocoa bars.  I put the in the freezer, makes them easier to chop.  I think the bars are 3.5 oz each.  They are about 8x3 inches.

I add the chocolate about half way through the churning process.

I have a small cheap ice cream maker.  I made this just as the recipe calls for, only I added a little more food coloring and I didn't add the chocolate chips until the ice cream maker was done.  I mixed in the chips after and put it in the freezer.  It was delicious!

YUMMY and easy! Instead of choc chips, we added crushed oreos towards the end just as the ice cream was getting thick. Also, next time I will add twice as much mint extract as we like it really minty. (note: the oreos did turn the ice cream light brown so if you want white or green, skip the oreos)

Even though this had great mint flavor, it didn't quite work out.  This was my first time using the ice cream maker, so I was a little confused how this recipe was described.  I added the chocolate chips when there were 10 minutes left in the freezing, and when I transfered it to a bowl to freeze, all the chocolate chips sank to the bottom of the container.  And it also didn't have the right consistency I was looking for after two hours.  I don't think I'll be making this again.

Best ice cream recipe ever!! This was so easy and fast to make. I only used 3/4 c sugar and 3/4 tsp of peppermint extract. I also took a Hershey Bar and grated it on my micrograter. It eventually melted in my fingers but left nice melt in your mouth bits in the ice cream. I added everything together and it separated fine. The 2nd time I made this, I semifroze my Hershey Bar and the chocolate was much finer. I like it better grating it at room temperature.

This recipe (minus the mint extract, food coloring, and chocolate chips) makes a perfect base for creating any flavor you want! I threw in some crumbled Oreos with one batch (although I wished I had some mint extract to go with it!!), and then made another batch with pureed peaches. Yum!!

Honestly, this is the best ice cream I have ever had. EVER. The creamy/icy ratio is perfect! The first batch we made, we did just chocolate chip and then the 2nd, we did mint choco chip. Both were incredible. we are using this recipe for all ice cream bases now. As for the chocolate pieces, I highly recommend shaving chocolate pieces off a bar of Ghiradelli Bittersweet Chocolate from the baking section in the grocery store. Use your potato peeler. This provides perfect texture and the bitterness of the chocolate counters the sweetness of the ice cream perfectly. YUM!

Good recipe. I only wish I'd broken up the  mini choco chips a bit so they would have blended better. I used whole milk instead of 2% and reduced the recipe to 6 servings to fit my Cuisinart ice cream maker without overflowing.

This was great.  I only had 1% milk and used Andes bakers chips which are basically crushed Andes mint pieces.  YUMMY!

So Good. This was my first home-made ice cream and I am so impressed! It tastes just like store bought, but it's so much more fun. The only thing is that maybe I wouldn't fill up the ice cream maker to the top - the ice cream "grows" as it becomes more and more frozen. It would have overflown if I hadn't been watching it. Oh another thing - put your choco chips in the freezer for the first ten minutes the mixture is churning to bring the temperature down.

I froze this in the freezer, stirring every 20 mins or so. It turned out absolutely delicious! Husband couldn't believe it was homemade! I'm going to make this with crushed oreos, as other reviewers suggested. Thanks so much, Darryn!

Delicious recipe!  Followed recipe as is except used oreos instead of chocolate chips.  Was a hit with kids and adults alike at our Memorial Day BBQ.

Absolutely flawless. My only deviation was being slightly more generous with the chocolate chips. This is so good. We'll definitely make it again, and soon, I hope. I also like that it calls for milk instead of the more expensive half and half that a lot of recipes call for. 5stars in our book!

GREAT!  I used whole milk instead of 2%.  We had this over warm brownies.  I omitted the green food coloring and instead of chocolate chips, I used Newman's Own mint oreos, crushed into chunks.  I will try the 2% milk next time and see how that turns out!

I don't personally care for mint-chocolate chip ice cream, but my husband loves it so I decided to make some for our Memorial Day pool party.  Everybody raved about how wonderful this recipe is!  It's very easy to make - I doubled it without any problems at all.  My husband said I won "Spouse of the Year" award by making this for him!!!

Absolutely wonderful.  All homemade icecream is 100% better if frozen after making and this one turned out perfect.  I made it for a church function and it was devoured within 5 minutes.

It rocks. I've tried the custard recipes and all the styles where you throw the ingredients on the stove for a little bit. This might be the perfect ice cream base, excellent trade off between convenience and texture/taste.

Got an ice cream maker for Christmas and after looking at several hundred recipes decided on this one.  Never having made ice cream before I used the star ratings as a big guideline for my first attempt.  IT CAME OUT PERFECTLY !!!!! I looked at a lot of reviews and only changed the 2% milk to half and half plus used mint extract instead of peppermint.  It was effortless and the ice cream was ready in 20 minutes, which having nothing to base it on seemed really quick.  I love the fact that All Recipes has the serving amount adjuster.  I was quickly able to adjust from 8 to 6 servings to conform to my 1.5 qt. maker.  Right now the ice cream is firming up for dessert tonight.  Tasting it right out of the machine in soft serve form it was to die for!  Huge thanks to Darryn M. Briggs for coming up with and sharing this winner! The fact that this is so delicious without having to fuss with eggs is tremendous. I think this will make a great base to make all sorts of yummy treats from just by changing the flavorings, nuts, etc.

This is the best ice cream I have tasted yet. It is good with cut up chocolate chips. We also used half and half, and 2% milk. It is very good. I chose this #1 ice cream.! (this review was written by my 8-yr old son)

Just came across this recipe, due to the stars and just finished making it. Followed the  recipe as is with the exception of chopping the chocolate into very small pieces. It came out fantastic. Love the fact that you do not need to mess with eggs. It tastes better than the brand names and without mystery ingredients. This is a keeper.

I made this ice cream yesterday to take to a church ice cream social. I followed the recipe exactly as written except I did not put it in the freezer for 2 hours. I took it straight to the ice cream social. Everyone loved it and there was not even a spoonful left. Mint chocolate chip has always been my favorite ice cream flavor and I am thrilled to have this recipe.

I love homemade ice cream, but it takes enough planning ahead to remember to freeze the chamber let alone to pre-make and chill custard! I look for egg-free recipes because I hate making custard and because I know too many kids with egg allergies. This recipe was perfect. I also recommend using whole milk instead of 2% and using mint extract instead of all-peppermint extract.

Used mint extract. I like my ice cream a bit richer in flavor. It tasted more like ice milk. Chocolate chips is easy to use, but I think chocolate shavings would've been better.

We did this in our Cuisinart ice cream maker, but tweaked it just a bit.  Instead of the chocolate chips, we coarsely chopped Thin Mints (girl scout cookies).  Only chop about 4 times across the cookie, then once the other direction.  You want fairly large chunks.  Don't worry about the crumbs.  Pour them right in with the chunks.  You can easily reduce sugar to 3/4 cup, and may want to reduce the vanilla to 1/2 tsp.  Overall, this is my favorite ice cream recipe so far!

I was a bit skeptical at first, since this recipe required no cooking & no eggs. But I shouldn't have. it's the BEST ICE CREAM RECIPE EVER. Period. And super easy. The only thing I did different is add 6 drops of food colouring instead of 3. BEST batch I've ever made.

Great recipe. But here are a couple of hints that I've learned from experience. Replace 1/4 cup of the sugar with corn syrup. This helps prevent the product becoming "icy." Also, it is important with any ice cream recipe to chill the mix for at least four hours or better, overnight before putting it into the ice cream freezer. The colder it is to start, the fewer ice crystals will form.

I just purchased a cuisinart ice cream maker. This was the first recipe I made. This ice cream is excellent. I did not add any food coloring, but followed the rest of the recipe to an exact. Turned out great. Is this the baskin Robbins mint chocolate chip ice cream recipe? It tastes exactly the same.

This was great! I followed this recipe to a T. The only change I  might make is to chop up the chocolate chips a bit more. They were a little big for me.

This turned out fantastic!  The only changes I made were to sub out the mini chips and use a bar of dark chocolate instead.  I shaved a lot of it, and chopped up the rest of it, and it really gave a wonderful flavor/texture.  I also did 2 drops green and 1 drop blue to create the perfect mint color.  Thanks for the awesome recipe, I will be making this again soon!

This is the best mint chocolate chip ice cream I've ever had. Silky, delicious. It was perfect! Will be making this again and again. Thank you for sharing!

We modified this with skim milk in place of the 2% and Splenda as a 1 for 1 replacement for the sugar. We also used creme de menthe flavoring and it turned out great. I would definitely try it with low fat half and half in the future.

so easy and absolutely delicious. I think big chocolate chips get too hard when frozen, so if I add chocolate its either the tiny chips or chopped very fine.

Recipe is perfect.  Just right amount of mint and chocolate.  I didn't have 2%  but whole milk didn't make a difference.

This ice cream tastes just like Breyer's which is my favorite mint chocolate chip ice cream.  I used whole milk because that's what I had on hand.  I also left out the food coloring because I have never been a fan of green mint choc chip ice cream anyway.  Next time I'm going to try half and half in place of the milk to see if it's a little creamier (it has a bit of an ice milk mouth-feel), but I have no complaints about the first batch I made.

This was one of the best ice creams I've ever tasted. My ice cream maker suggests only 3 C of liquid, so I used 2 C half and half, and 1 C heavy cream. I just cut everything back by 1/4. Definitely making this again soon!

This is really good.  I like that it is a no-cook and no-egg recipe.  The mint flavor was a little off for me.  I think I'll add a little less mint or maybe a little more vanilla next time.

I changed things around a little, I used half and half instead of 2% and a little less than a cup of sugar. I also added about 10 drops of green coloring to this to get a nice mint green color.  
I was actually surprised at just how creamy this was, I've only made custard based ice creams before.  I might try this as a custard based, it will probably be way creamier...  This is a good one for times when you want ice cream quick.

We used 2 C whole milk, 1 C heavy cream, 1 C coconut milk. Doubled the mint and subbed the chips for leftover M&M's.  Fab!  Going to make for St. Pats next month too, I am thinking Oreo's next time. Great base and I will be tweaking the add ins to whatever I have laying around.

This was great. I made it for my dad's birthday, everybody liked it. I hesitated to use whole milk (We never buy 2%) but after reading some of the reviews i did. We didn't have miniature chocolate chips, so I grated some baking chocolate and added that. It looked and tasted wonderful. Also, I have encountered problems with toooooo too too much mint or peppermint extract in the ice cream. So I just added till it tasted right.  Thanks for the great recipe.

LOVED this ice cream.  The texture was perfect, smooth and creamy.  I found mint extract at a cake shop, because spearmint or peppermint just didn't sound right to me.  I also added Keebler mint grasshopper cookies instead of the chocolate pieces, and it was excellent.

After reading many reviews, I opted to use mint extract instead of peppermint.  I substituted chopped Andes Mints for the semisweet chips.  Mint Chocolate Chip is my husband's favorite flavor of ice cream and although he liked this, he has requested store bought for next time.  Most likely, I will not make this recipe again.

Not really impressed. Not as creamy as I expected but this is the first time I used my ice cream maker and maybe I am just not experienced enough. Ended up throwing it out.

Ice cream turned out great!  Did use skim milk and the whipping cream.  Might go up to 1% next time to give it more fat.  Also used  1/3 cup of Creme de Ment instead of the peppermint extract.  It gave the ice cream a great minty flavor and no need for the food coloring as well.  Will be making this base recipe again and will try adding other flavors and addins too.

I love this recipe!!!  My 9 yr old daughter bought a ice cream maker with her own money.  Well, we spent $$ on premade mixes that you just add milk.  Not anymore!!!  I actually goofed and used half and half instead of heavy cream, came out delicious!  Very affordable recipe and delicious.

This is really good.  Easy to make and has a wonderful flavor.  Instead of the chips, I grated a good quality chocolate for more even distribution.  Thank you for this recipe, we'll be making it often.

Very good!  I would leave out the chips though-too many and too crunchy.  I used mint extract instead of peppermint and it tasted great.

We made this today for 4th of July.  Doubled the recipe for our ice cream maker.  It was a hit!  Folks were raving about it.  Somebody else made vanilla and ours was  hovered over!  We'll have a hard time NOT making this every time we make ice cream.  Give this one a shot!  Followed the recipe to a T and it was great.

I loved this ice cream, but my husband said it tasted like "Scope".  I think I'll try it with a little less mint and see if he likes it better.  I really liked it myself.

Very good mint ice cream! I like to substitute almond extract for vanilla extract, but my husband likes the recipe as is.

I made this ice cream and it came out very well. Tasted and smelled just like store bought mint ice cream. I used food coloring and made it mint green as well. this was my first try and ice cream and i had trouble with the chips sticking to the bottom. I did try stirring every 20 minutes or so but the chips weren't swirled throughout. Good recipe and instructions but i don't think icecream is my strongpoint.

*** I recently retried this recipe using an ice cream maker and it came out perfectly.

This was great...I don't like my homemade ice cream to freeze hard, so I was very pleased with that aspect. I changed the heavy cream to half/half and it froze just fine and tasted great.

Great texture to this ice cream. I agree with others, grate the chocolate instead of adding chocolate chips. Also, I would halve the peppermint extract - just too strong for me, and I like mint.

AWESOME!!!  This was really easy, and very tasty.   The texture was very creamy and it froze well.  My reccomendation to those who had problems getting the ice cream to freeze: once your machine stops turning, scrape the inside of your ice cream maker and turn it back on.  I did it, and it worked perfect!  Next time I make it (which is tomarrow:-)I'll substitute 2 cups of half and half for the heavy cream.  I'm not sure if it'll freeze right, but we'll see.  Also, I'll grind up the chocalate pieces as I prefer smaller chocolate chunks.  This recipe is a keeper!

This couldn't be easier and very delicious, too.  Next time I would use only 1/2 tsp. peppermint extract as it was a little strong.  Also it didn't get real hard in the freezer.  Still very good and a hit with my family.

This ice cream has a wonderful flavor! Like one of the other reviewers, however, I also had a problem with it not freezing all the way. It turned out more like slush than ice cream. But the flavor was so great that it disappeared quickly anyway!

I made it a few times now. When I didn't have 2% milk I used whole milk. Either way it's really good. I added a little more peppermint flavor and color.

I made this and it was great! The only thing was I did use only half of the peppermint exact, however I still gave it a 5 cause although I thought this was the perfect amount my husband wishes it had more mint flavor, so maybe the original is right on! I used mini semi sweet chocolate chips and chopped them by hand to make them more fine. I have a cusinart ice cream maker, which suggests cooling the mixture for 2 hours before churning, and not adding chocolate chips until 10 before complete. I followed these recommendations along with the recipe and it was great!

This is a good recipe, easy and satisfying.  After reading some reviews, I made some tweaks. I used half n half instead of the milk.  Halved the salt, used crushed oreos, and used mint extract instead of peppermint.  I had both types of extract but the mint smelled more pleasing to me. 1 teaspoon is the right of amount of extract.  If you really like minty stuff add a bit more.  I also doubled the food coloring and it was a nice green color while in the mixer but after adding the oreo's it took away most of the green color. Oh well, still tasted great and was quite addicting.

Hands down the best mint chocolate chip ice cream I've ever had. I added an extra teaspoon of peppermint extract because one tsp definitely doesn't make it minty enough in my opinion. Delicious recipe.

I make this recipe regularly since it's my husband's favorite ice cream and now my kids'.  First of all, I often change the 2% for Winder Farms skim milk and turns out wonderful.  I've also done just heavy cream and half and half and that works too, just creamier.  It's a forgiving recipe plus you can play around until you find the consistency you like most.  I've done the mini chocolate chips and I don't like it as much as buying blocks of dark chocolate and chopping it up finely.  We also add about half a teaspoon more of mint since we love mint!

this is delicious.  The only change I made was to half and half for the 2% because I had some that needed to be used up.

LOVE!!! Made this for first time this morning.  Used Light Cream and consistency was perfect.  Also, found Ghiradelli Mini Chips in my grocery store and used them...perfect small size so I did not have to shave or chop or dice the chocolate!  I added the mint extract a drop at a time to ensure I did not over do the mint taste.  What a treat for this hot summer day!!!

This is my first time making ice cream and it was so easy and delicious!!! I used 1% milk and light cream but everything else was as written! This tasted just like the ice cream I get from an ice cream shop! I can't wait to try it again and experiment with different flavors! This is such an easy recipe! A must try!

Tasted a bit "off" from what I was expecting. I did, however,  put in slightly more vanilla and a little spillover of mint. Either way, even being a little different, the longer it sat in the freezer and the more of it I ate, the better it tasted. This was true to the point of craving this ice cream and wanting to make more as soon as it was gone. Very tasty.

This was the first recipe that we tried in our new ice cream maker.  I was attracted by the ease of prep based upon the lack of eggs and cooking.  After looking at other reviews the only changes I made was using whole milk instead of 2% and using shavings from  a dark chocolate Dove Easter bunny instead of chips.  The results- delicious!!!  It was not icy at all and was very creamy and flavorful.  We will be sure to make this ice cream again.

This turned out "good." I followed the recipe exactly but will definitely half the amount of mint extract next time; at this quantity it almost tasted like candy cane ice cream. It was also a little icey instead of creamy, so whole milk might be in order. Lastly, I don't see any need for food coloring.

Wow, wow, wow!!!  This was sooo good!  My husband and I love mint chocolate chip ice cream, so I decided to make this with our new ice cream maker (which I LOVE).  I said it tastes just like Breyers, which is my favorite, my husband said it's better :-)  I added about 1/4 tsp extra peppermint extract and didn't use the green food coloring and it was perfect - otherwise followed it to a T.  Thanks, Darryn for sharing a great recipe!  UPDATE....i made chocolate ice cream using this recipe.  I left out the mint, chips and food coloring of course and I added about 1/3 cup cocoa powder.  To die for....this is definitely a great base recipe for many flavors as a previous reviewer mentioned.

This is my first time to taste and make mint chocolate chip ice cream. This is so easy! No cooking involved and the creamiest and mintiest! I added some green food coloring and it looks awesome. I know I will be using this recipe often!

Use less salt!  This is the first time I've ever actually tasted the salt in my ice cream.  Maybe 1/4 teaspoon instead of 1/2?  Other than that, I liked the amount of peppermint flavor, the color and the amount of choc.  I used half/half instead of milk and cream and liked the texture.

Just made this recipe - did not have heavy whipping cream, so used a can of evaporated milk instead.  I had ghirardelli semi sweet choc chips on hand, so we used those.  It was delicious!  I know the heavy cream would make it even more amazing, but it was pretty darn good as it.  Next time I will use some good dark chocolate, because that is what I really like.  Then in will be perfect.

OMG! This is truly my favorite ice cream. So easy to make the best I've made and the yummiest I've ever had. Note that you have to like mint to enjoy this and make sure to use natural mint extract and not oil or it will be way too intense! Less chocolate chips or chocolate shaves are also fine. Enjoy!

Mint Chip Ice Cream is one of my favorite ice creams.. so I had high hopes for this one! I had to scale down the recipe because our ice cream maker only fits 1.5 quarts, so i don't know if I messed something up in the process? But although it tastes ok, it's not like the baskin robbins type of mint chip I'd hoped for. I did use whole milk only because I had some I wanted to use up and plus I feel like 2% makes ice cream kind of "icy" instead of creamy, and the texture was amazing! But even though I still took off about 1/4 of the amount of pepper mint, it still tasted like maybe it was off. Maybe it's the brand. Would like to use shaved chocolate but I don't know how to do that! So I just threw my chocolate chunks in the processor, and broke down the larger pieces in there even more. I'll try it again, and try to perfect it! But other than the mint, it was still delicious.

Such an easy ice cream recipe and produces delicious gelato-esque consistency straight out of the ice cream maker. I added slightly more vanilla and peppermint extract - I'd definitely advise tasting the mixture before putting it in the machine to make sure it has the right balance for you. I also made this with white chocolate chunks and it went down a storm - highly recommended for white choc fans!

I made this exactly to the recipe and it was very good, although it was a little on the salty side. Next time I will leave the salt out, or just add a pinch. I used Toll House mini chocolate chips, and they were perfect!  I would like to use this recipe as a base for some other flavors. Thanks!

EXCELLENT RECIPE!!! If you're new to making ice cream you should try this one!!! A few suggestions to consider: 3 drops of green food coloring doesn't provide much color -- but you can add a drop at a time as it mixes. For the "chips" consider freezing a chocolate bar of your favorite brand, put it into a zip lock bag and use your meat hammer to break it into small chunks .... no mess! I used 1 tsp of peppermint and 1/2 tsp of vanilla and it was REALLY good. GOOD RECIPE!!!

Fan-Freaking-Fantastic!!  I will NEVER buy mint ice cream from a store again--and I really mean that.  This is so simple to make and so much tastier than store-bought, who needs Dreyers??  I made this almost exactly per the recipe, except that I tripled the peppermint flavoring.  (We really love cool MINT at our house!  And triple is just right for us.)  I also chopped up some mint chocolate bars and mint chocolate chips instead of using plain chocolate (I stock up on these at Christmas time and freeze them for later use).  And I didn't measure the chocolate, just eye-balled it.  The texture of the ice cream is perfect--creamy, but not like eating Cool-Whip, like so many other ice cream recipes are.  Make it the day before you want to eat it so it can set up thoroughly.  And if any of it lasts in your freezer for a week or two without being devoured, the taste actually gets even better over time.  I experimented with one batch where I was trying to reduce the naughtiness a bit and used half and half instead of cream--this didn't work (it didn't set up), but I did learn in the process that you can cut the sugar a bit (by 1/2 cup on a double batch) and it will still be sweet enough.  But I say, make it as written and ENJOY.  Why mess with success?  It's absolutely scrumptious!

Yum, this is so gooood! I put the choc in my food processor, at first I thought it would be to fine, but it was just right. We all thought this was as good or better then going to an expensive ice cream shop.

This ice cream was okay but I didn't care for the salty taste.  Definitely would recommend leaving the salt out or cutting it down significantly.  Also it really tasted more like peppermint ice cream than mint chocolate.  Mint extract would make a more true mint chocolate chip ice cream.

I used this recipe for the first time I have ever made ice cream.  Wow.  Delicious.  I ended up adding 3 extra drops of the green food colouring - just for my preference - but it obviously doesn't change the fabulous taste.  I will DEFINETLY be making this recipe again.

Great recipe!  Ice cream was very creamy!  Although, I made a few changes.  First, I used half n half instead of the 2% milk.  Also, I used 2 teaspoons of peppermint extract since I tasted it before I put it in the ice cream maker and it wasn't "minty" enough for my liking.  Third, I used 5 drops of food coloring to get a better green tint.  And lastly, I did use shaved semi-sweet chocolate, so I could get more of a store-bought look.  And plus, you can get small blocks of chocolate at some higher end grocery stores for pretty cheap (I used Callebaut from Whole Foods).    Another note, this recipe will overflow in some ice cream makers (I used a regular Cuisinart one).  You might have to either do this in 2 batches or reduce the ingredients by 1/2.

From previous experience with non-cook ice-cream recipe I was skeptical... but this was wonderful.  I took others advice and used 3/4 tsp of vanilla and 3/4 of peppermint extract.  Just enough mint flavour.  This recipe fit perfectly into my kitchenaid ice-cream attachment.  For fun I added chunks of non-egg cookie dough at the end.  Great easy recipe, will definitely make again.

Very tasty. I used whole milk instead of 2% and shaved two Ghirardelli semi-sweet chocolate bars instead of using mini chips.

I just bought the Cuisinart Pure Indulgence 2 qt automatic ice cream maker and this was the very first recipe I made in it.  To quote my niece, "Yummylicious!" I adore mint chocolate chip ice cream, especially when it's homemade.  This recipe was super simple and I must say I am in love with my new ice cream maker and I HIGHLY recommend the Cuisinart machine!  It took me about 5 minutes to mix up the ingredients and about 20 minutes later I was enjoying this delicious recipe.  I used whole milk in place of the 2%, but that was the only change I made to the recipe.  In the future I will probably only add 3/4 t. of peppermint extract as I thought the mint flavor was just slightly too powerful.  Still, I believe this recipe is worthy of five stars.

Oh WOW.. This came out INCREDIBLE! I LOVEEEEE Bryers MCC and I thought this was even better! I took some of the suggestions.. I used 3 cups of whole milk and 1 cup of heavy whipping cream, just b/c that's what I had left over from another ice cream recipe I tried, I used 1/4 teas salt and the peppermint extract. I also splurged and bought a 4oz. Ghirardelli bittersweet choc bar that I got out of my baking isle at the store... I tried to use the vegetable peeler like others suggested but all I was getting was very tiny shavings so instead I just used a knife and cut it into small pieces.. the size of mini choc chips... you get about a cups worth. My icecream is LOADED w/ tiny choc chunks and we made ours pink just b/c my sons wanted to be funny...  Everyone LOVES this recipe! I have a 4qt ice cream maker and I could of doubled the recipe so I'll do that from now on. And anyone complaining of ice crystals needs to go w/ whole milk. I only use 1% milk in my house so the first of my ice cream attempts always had those ice crystals in it till I read a review on another recipe and I finally tried the whole milk and heavy whipping cream. This is my 3rd batch using both of those and I haven't had one crystal in any of them. Thanks for the recipe.. my poor icecream maker is going to burn out!

This was declicious! This is the first recipe I have made with my new KitchenAid ice cream maker, and it was so easy. No cooking-just mix and pour. My whole family loves chip and mint and this is wonderful. I prefer a lower fat version so I will be tweeking this recipe in the future. Will give updates.

Even using whole milk rather than 2%, this came out too icy for my liking.  Also, I had to use more peppermint than called for here and the vanilla flavor was too strong.

My daughter had been asking for mint ice cream without the chocolate chips. I tried this recipe that way and found it to still be a TERRIFIC recipe. (We sprinkled the chips on top, according to each ones liking) Thanks for the recipe.

It's perfect as is...I also used it as a base for vanilla ice cream and I don't think I've ever eaten anything so good!  The title is true, too-it's so easy and simple to put together.  I highly recommend this one!

I need more stars! This turned out absolutely wonderful. I used mint extract, it's what I had on the spice shelf. I also bought Baker's semi-sweet chocolate in the squares and shaved it. That in itself is really what put this recipe over the top, although the basic ice cream recipe is great. I froze a small container for 2 weeks waiting to give it to a mint choc chip. lover I know. I was worried it would get icy or be harder that a rock. But, he thought he had died and went to heaven! I don't care for the recipes without cream, I think it's lacking, and if you freeze it it turns to ice.On the other hand I don't like it when there's so much fat that the roof of your mouth is grease coated, the flavor gets lost. It must be the 2% milk that prevented this. Sometimes you just have to realize that cutting calories in a recipe is not worth it. If your going to go to all the trouble it should taste pretty good, otherwise I'll just go to the store and buy ice milk!
Thanks for the great recipe!

Great recipe, SO easy to make and change up if you wish. My only issue is that I could taste the salt. Next time I'm going to try 1/4 teaspoon instead.

We used Baker's semi-sweet chocolate squares in place of chips, and replaced the milk and cream with all half&half, but otherwise we followed the recipe exactly.  The ice cream was amazing - creamy and just perfect.  We couldn't wait for it to freeze completely and ate it while it was the consistency of soft serve.  We will definitely make this again!

I loved this recipe so much that I am using it as the base for all my ice cream. I did use whole milk instead of 2%. I have also made vanilla from this as well as peach ice cream. I love the base and the texture it gives me when frozen. My family loves it. Next we are doing M%M ice cream for my granddaughter. This one is a winner.

I got my ice cream maker more than a year ago and we have never been able to find an easy recipe that was good...until now.  This ice cream is absolutely delicious!  It doesn't taste gritty (from not enough fat in the cream) or fatty (from too much heavy cream); it freezes really nicely (not super hard) and it doesn't contain eggs which we like.  I used normal sized chocolate chips (tried to chop them in the food processor to no avail), but next time I will use shaved chocolate suggested by another reviewer.  I ended up using the whole teaspoon of peppermint and 15 drops of green gel food colouring.  I will use this ice cream base for all my future ice cream needs!

I used 1% milk and when frozen it turned out a bit "icey."  Next time I think I would use at least whole milk so that it freezes to a creamy texture.  I also shaved a chocolate bar with a veggie peeler.

i cut this recipe in half as i didn't know how it would turn out. now i wish i'd made a full batch! i used more peppermint and half the amount of vanilla. i thought the 2% milk wouldn't be as tasty as half-and-half, but it really is! i chopped up some semi-sweet chocolate chunks as well as shaving some of the chunks with my microplane. i think that makes a HUGE difference in the taste and texture. i will totally make this recipe again in the near future!

Excellent recipe! I agree with other reviewers on chopping the chips. What I did was chop about 3/4 cup of chips and then 1/4 cup of Andres Chocolate Mints to up the mint flavor, but not too much. Also, I added the peppermint extract to taste. Finally, I have tried the recipe with 2% and whole milk. Personally, I find the whole milk freezes better and    has a better consistency. Overall, an awesome recipe that I use as a "base" for other flavors. Many thanks!

My husband and I loved this. I spend so much time making ice cream because it calls for eggs and all that means is a lot of time. This is so good for being so easy. The first time I made mint chip with skim milk. It was good. Today I made peach with almond extract with 2%. Amazing, simple put.
Update: Just 2 tsp of vanilla or 1 1/2 tsp of vanilla with 1 tsp. of cinnamon is also great.

This was pretty good...but not GREAT.  I used a grated Hersheys Special Dark candy bar for the chocolate but otherwise followed the recipe.  The texture was AWESOME--it stayed soft and scoopable even in the freezer, almost like store-bought.  But, something about it tasted sort of "waxy" to me.  I'll try a different recipe next time.

Loved it!  I used 2 or 3 Hershey candy bars, regular size.  I cut them into long, thin strips, then again into very small pieces.  It froze perfectly.  The candy wasn't too thick or too hard to bite into...it just melted along with the ice cream in our mouths!

I made some changes to this recipe.  I used 2 C Heavy Cream, 2 C SKIM Milk, 1 Cup sugar.  I don't care for mint choc. chip ice cream, so I made my own variation.  4 Tbsp instant decaf coffee, 4 Tbsp Stabuck's Mocha Powder.  
Oh my gosh, I churned it for almost 2 hours in the ice-cream maker and before I put it in the freezer my husband and 14-year-old stepson were fighting over it!  It was wonderful mocha ice-cream.  I didn't expect it to come out creamy because of the skim milk, but it worked like a charm after churning it that long.

Oh My Goodness! This ice-cream is delicious, and soooo easy to make.  My husband is an ice-cream snob, and usually only 'tolerates' my concoctions.  This one, he tried and thought it was 'his' mint chip. It tastes as good or better than the one he usually gets, only this one has NO extra preservatives or junk like that. Thanks for sharing it with us.

This was awesome. We doubled the recipe and instead of chocolate chips we used crushed and broken up Oreo's (my favorite Ben & Jerry's flavor!)

Too sweet.  I'll leave out the vanilla all together next time and double the peppermint.  The chips beat up my automatic ice cream maker so next time I guess I can try and grate the chocolate.

Delicious! This was such a huge hit with with my picky fiancé and relatives who came to visit.  Even my uncle who doesn't like ice cream loved it.  The recipe was easy.  Just be sure to add the chocolate chips when the recipe calls for. The only problem I had was waiting too long before adding the chocolate chips.  It was a bit too frozen before I added them, so it was hard to mix them in thoroughly and there were less chips at the bottom.

We always make ice cream once a year, right before summer. I went onto Food.com, because it is a very reliable website. I just made some of the ice cream and it was delicious!

I followed this recipe as written for the base and it came out great. I made sure the sugar was completely dissolved and rested the mix in the refrigerator for 8 hours.  I will say though that the recipe does not state whether the salt is iodized table salt(maybe why some thought it was salty) or kosher. I used kosher and the salt  content was fine for me. I would suggest if you are using iodized salt use 1/4 teaspoon.  I also used chopped up Andes Mints instead of mini choc chips. I used McCormick peppermint extract  and it was the perfect taste in the quantity of the recipe but again you might try putting half the amount , taste and adjust to your liking from there.  It came out light and airy at the recommended churning time(using a KitchenAid Ice Cream Maker) . The best part is no cooking and blending eggs. So in my opinion it is an excellent recipe.

This was hands down the best ice cream recipe I've ever made! I first picked it because I wanted a fast mix that I could whip up without having to cook and chill it for hours! I threw everything in my blender to really mix and dissolve the sugar well, then poured right into my ice cream compressor. The best part was after storing this ice cream in the freezer it never got hard! It was always soft like store bought and super delicious! I did use whole milk in place of the 2%  but that was the only change I made.

Omg this is the first time I've ever made homemade ice cream and this was super easy and so so creamy. The mint is just right. You have to make sure you but peppermint extract not just "mint" that way it's not overpowering. I had some left over girl scout thin mint cookies so I did a half of cup of those and half a cup of chocolate chips all cut up. Besides that I made the recipe as stated and it was perfect.

I've taken to using this recipe a bit more frequently than perhaps I ought... but it is quite tasty. I've honestly stopped making other flavors, except by request. After the first couple batches turned out well, I've experimented a little with the ratio of cream to milk (so far my favorite is 2:1). And because I keep forgetting mini chocolate chips, I also tend to use regular chocolate chips, chopping them up, which works nicely - and is certainly better than just using the regular chips whole.

We make this with our Kitchen-Aid ice cream maker attachment, and it's a no-fail recipe! We've tried variations by switching up the mint extract with raspberry, for example, and adding fresh fruit in place of (or in addition to) the chocolate chips.

This was an excellent recipe. The only thing I will change next time is the amount of mini chips. I will at least cut that in half if not more. Great base to any ice cream though. Update: I used a 1/3 of a cup if mini chips and that was Perfect. I don't us the food coloring, not needed.

Use 1/2 tsp or less of peppermint.  It's all you will need.  A GREAT recipe that I have made multiple times.  You can't find a decent mint chip in the store anymore!  This was just what I had been looking for for a long time!

Very easy and fun project for my daughter and I to do together.  We used chopped chocolate instead of the chips and took other's advice on using mint extract instead of peppermint.  Just like the store kind but now I know what is in it!

Some of our family members suffer from asthma caused by a dairy allergy.  I used flax milk for the milk and canned coconut milk for the heavy cream.  We thought it was better than the dairy recipe which we though was a bit too rich.  If you don't like coconut (not my son's favorite), don't worry, you could not taste it at all!  I used "Enjoy Life" mini chocolate bits which are dairy, soy and nut free, yet still taste delicious!  A+++

I fully admit I made changes to the recipe. I am giving it such high marks for its versatility. And ability to be adapted as a base for all future ice cream attempts. This was our first attempt at making ice cream. We used a Cuisinart maker. Since my daughters of 5 & 7 were basically making the ice cream I didn't want to have to go from stove to freezer. We had 1/2 & 1/2 & heavy cream so used those. In addition love mint chocolate chip and heeded other reviewers and used mint. Salt taste WAS NOT A PROBLEM!  Crystallization was not a problem. In addition those mentioning problems with chocolate chips being too hard/frozen must not have used the minis but the morsels. No problem with the minis!  We are looking forward to our next batch. We will probably make chocolate chip cookie dough or coffee Oreo!  THANK YOU!

I made this ice cream for July 4th and it was so good. Everyone loved it.  I used half and half instead of the milk, added mint oreos instead of chocolate chips, and used creme de menth instead of the peppermint. The creme de menth really gave it a nice flavor. Make sure you taste the mix to see if it has the right amount of mint flavoring before you put it in your ice cream maker.  I also made cinnamon vanilla ice cream using this as a base omitting the mint and adding vanilla and cinnamon.

Best homemade ice cream we have ever made !  Kids loved it and everyone commented how good it was!  Easy to make too!  Didn't change anything on recipe.  Will definitely be making it again!  Might also try the recipe with chopped Oreos for cookies and creme!

Wonderful the way it is, but I also used it as a base recipe for thin mint cookie ice cream.  I substituted 4TBPS creme de mente for the peppermint extract and one cup of crushed thin mints for the chocolate chips. It was great!

This was such a good mint icecream recipe. I used mini chocolate chips which got kind of hard when frozen, I would probably chop the chocolate into small pieces next time, but I will make this again.

The texture and flavor was excellent, however I'm giving it 4 stars because it wasn't nearly minty enough. I had used SANDRA_FRANCKS suggestion to use min instead of peppermint extract. Next time, I'll do the same, but double the amount of extract.

I followed the receipe exactly except I used Truvia blend for the sweetener and it was perfect! No one could tell the difference. This will be a family favorite.

Excellent, easy recipe. I made it exactly as written. I would not reduce the amount of vanilla or mint extract, as another reviewer said she had done - I thought it was perfect as-is, not overwhelmingly minty. However my husband thought it didn't have enough of a mint flavor.

This is a wonderful icecream recipe! I usually don't put in the chocolate chips because I put them in too early! Sometimes put in a little extra peppermint extract for more minty flavor. Great recipe overall, I give it a two thumbs up!

This ice cream was delicious!  The only issue I had was the chocolate chips settled to the bottom and were a little hard, so I am planning to try chocolate shavings the next time I make this.

Wonderful recipe!  I made it, omitting the vanilla extract because I didn't think it needed it.  It turned out fantastic.  Will make again, for sure!

wowzers!  The high rating is well deserved.  I followed the recipe to the letter, except that I shaved my chocolate.  Used my Cuisinart ice cream maker and in the future I will reduce the recipe by 25% as it spilled over a bit.

I admit I am surpised by how good this ice cream is (not just good, its amazing!). I usually make ice cream with whole milk and I doubted the 2%'s ability to make a great ice cream. Well, it totally can! Like other reviewers I used mint extract instead of peppermint, and I used Oreos instead of chocolate chips. Only thing is it probably could have used more food coloring, it came out kinda greyish.

Loved this recipe!  The only thing I changed was I used Andes mint baking chips instead of chocolate chips.  Can't wait to make it again.

This ice cream is delicious!  I have made it several times and have had family members try it and they say it is just like the store's brand.  The only thing I do differently than the recipe is I only use half of the chocolate chips.  My first batch was made with what the recipe called for and it was too much chocolate chips.  But since I cut it in half, everyone seems to LOVE this ice cream!  Definately a keeper in my recipe box!

My whole family loved this recipe!  I followed the recipe except I used 1c. of coconut palm crystals, found at my local Whole Foods, instead of sugar for a slightly healthier twist and left out the food coloring. The only problem I had was after 20 mins in my ice cream maker it started over-flowing. I might try 1 1/2 cups of milk instead of 2 cups next time and see if that helps.

I would give this 5 stars except I followed naples34102 suggestions instead, so I can't really review the original recipe. Growing up in the St. Louis area makes me a frozen custard lover as well. I followed her  suggestions exactly, but used 1 t. vanilla and 1 1/2 t. peppermint extract b/c my household loves mint. Thank you Darryn for the original recipe, I'm going to try it next time to compare it without the eggs. Thank you naples34102 for your review - it's so delicious and I know my dinner guests will rave over it tonight.

Amazing, better than store bought! I will cut down the amount of chocolate chips next time though. The only downside is that it melts really fast, but you'll be eating it quickly anyway because it's so good! I also cut the salt down to 1/4 tsp. Made the same recipe again but with only vanilla extract and crushed oreos. It was to die for!

Ok - so I went to make my favorite ice cream - Mint Chocolate Chip and I found out I didn't have any mint extract which I swore I had.  So I found some orange extract in the cabinet and used that with the chocolate chips.   Oh I didn't have any 2% milk or heavy cream so I used half and half.  Guess what - came out great.   Try it.

Wow!  This is an awesome recipe!  It came out perfect the first time I made it, which doesn't happen often for me.  The only change I made was adding 8-9 drops of food coloring, which may have been too much, but the color was just the same as store-bought.  I think 1 cup of mini chocolate chips may have been too much, so when I make it again, I will probably use less chocolate chips.  I will definitely be making this one again, as it is my absolute favorite ice cream flavor.  Thanks for sharing!!

So much better than store bought.  This is light and fresh tasting.  I like the fact that I control how much extract to put in depending on how minty we want it.  This recipe is easy to do and tastes great!

This was REALLY good! I made it just as the recipe states, except I chopped up  some semi sweet chocolate chips because that is what I had. It was the first time i had made icecream in a small electric churn and it turned out better than perfect. The ladies at my church sopcial requested I bring it to the next meeting! A few days later their husbands were still talking about how good their wives said my icecream was!! When I froze the little bit leftover, it seemed to get dry and crumbly, but as it thawed some it softened back up nice! I will be making this again. My whole family liked it too!!

Hands down the best Mint Chocolate Chip Ice Cream recipe I've come across. I used a melted semisweet and canola mix to swirl into the ice cream instead of mini chips and it was a hit! I will try the mini chips next time.

Excellent ice cream but we used the peppermint oil (8 drops) instead of extract AND we used a mint dark chocolate candy bar (sugar free from Amber Lyn) which we shaved. Since I can't eat sugar, we substitued agave for the sugar and it was incredible, no one believes it's sugar free

I love this! I used Ghiradelli semi-sweet chips (cheaper than the "bar") which I melted in a bowl in the microwave and then spread very thin on a wax paper lined cookie sheet before placing in freezer to harden.  Once frozen I broke the chocolate into tiny pieces (you can also cut with a knife) and then placed back in freezer until I was ready to add to the mixture.  I like mine very minty so I used 2 tsp. Peppermint Extract.  Otherwise I followed this recipe as listed

Wonderful! This is my favorite ice cream and this recipe hit the spot! Only thing I changed was instead of 2 cups of milk and cream, I did 1 1/2 each bc it is too much base for my ice cream maker for my Kitchen Aide Mixer.

This was a fabulous recipe!  We made it as is, but we used mint extract instead of peppermint as another reviewer suggested, and we ground the chocolate chips in the Magic Bullet.  It only lasted about 24 hours!    Now we're making a variation using the same basic recipe.  We used 2 tsp of vanilla extract instead of 1 vanilla and 1 mint, and we added ground Oreo cookie instead of chocolate chips to make Oreo Cookies & Cream.  It's a bit sweet for me, so I think I'll cut the sugar in half next time, as the Oreos really sweeten it up, but it tastes SOOOO good.    This base recipe will be my staple for all ice cream flavors from now on.

My first attempt at ice cream I didn't want to use something that had to be cooked first.  This was awesome, but I added chopped up Andes Mint Candies instead of the peppermint extract and chocolate and I didn't do the food coloring.  I will use this as a basis and experiment with other additives.

This is really very good ice cream.  Here are the few changes I made.  I used 2 oz. of semi-sweet chocolate shavings instead of the mini-chips. I used 1/2 cup of packed, fresh mint leaves (immersion blended into the milk) instead of peppermint extract. I omitted the green food coloring (preferring the natural color of food). I used whole milk instead of 2% milk (preferring a creamier flavor).  I churned the ice cream in my ice cream maker for 20 minutes before adding the chocolate shavings. Then I churned the mixture for another 5 minutes before transferring the soft-serve ice cream into air-tight containers to further harden.  My husband and daughter both gave this flavor a thumbs up!

We loved it! In place of the chocolate chips I used 1.75 oz (1/2 of a 3.5 oz) milk chocolate bar that I shaved with a potato peeler.

This recipe is EXCELLENT!! I was nervous about using 2% milk but used it anyway. It turned out great, did not get icy at all!...Leftover was still good too and not icy...Tastes wonderful!!! Everyone loved it!! I doubled the recipe and it still didn't fill my ice cream maker. Using this recipe to make plain vanilla today...hope it's as good!...TRY IT YOU'LL LOVE IT!

LOVED IT!!!  Was a huge success.  We had to double the recipe due to the number of people we were serving.  I did not have any mini chocolate chips so I chopped up some chocolate bars using my food chopper.  I also added way more food coloring than six drops but that's because the person helping didn't think it was green enough.  Once it was done mixing in the ice cream maker we placed in the freezer for another two to three hours and it still had that soft serve texture.  Everyone loved it and we will definetly be making again!!!

This recipe is amazing!  It's not overwhelmingly minty- actually it's just right.  I only used 1/4 cup of choc chips and that was more than enough. This is better than store bought stuff!

Easy and tasty. Think next time I'll shave a chocolate bar into it though as I like the chocolate taste without such a hard crunch. Just personal taste. Also, had it in the freezer for about 5 hours and it was still Very soft. Very tasty though! :)

This is absolutely delicious. I used organic milk and cream. I didn't have mint so I put 2 t. of vanilla. I chopped semi-sweet choc. chips in a processer which put nice chocolate flecks through the ice cream. Delicious and very easy.

Great mint chocolate chip ice cream and I followed the recipe exactly.  The ONLY thing I wold change is to add shaved chocolate as opposed to the mini chips, and decrease the amount of shaved chocolate to 3/4 cup.  The mini chips are too large and adding 1 cup of chips adds  a chocolate flavor that is overwhelming the mint flavor.  Other than that, great recipe, don't change a thing.

this is only the second recipe I've tried with my new machine and it was fabulous! the only variation I made was having peppermint oil instead of the extract so I only added a few drops to flavor. Finished product was not a chuck of ice like my previous try; it was smooth and easily served after several hours in the freezer.

I used 3 1/2 cups heavy cream and 1/2 cup of skim milk. Came out rich and creamy, no ice crystals in the final freezing. I also used the 3/4 tsp of peppermint extract instead of the full and its minty enough for us, just the way we like it.

This recipe is awesome, super easy for the whole family to get involved in! My children are all about their "green" ice cream. I used pure mint extract instead of the peppermint extract. It gave it more of a spearmint flavor. This is the best mint-chocolate ice cream I have had in a while.

This is a great easy recipe.  I used 1 cup of sugar substitute instead of sugar (I used Ideal which is xylitol, you can probably use splenda too) it tastes great; zero calorie no aftertaste and i feel a little less guilty about the heavy cream - also used whole milk instead of 2%, but I'll try it with 2% next time.  used milk chocolate and a little extra mint extract because i enjoy the extra minty taste -  this recipe is definitely a keeper!

Ok so i gave this 5 stars because i know the flavor will be spot on the next time. I took reviewers advice and messed with the extract ratio...big mistake! I used 1/2tsp vanilla and 1 1/2tsp peppermint extract and the mintyness is great until the aftertaste hits you and its just not what i expect from mint chip ice cream.

I made this exactly as instructed and it was great!  The amount fit perfectly in my 1 1/2 quart freezer, I doubled it the next day to fit in a traditional gallon freezer.  I did chop the mini chips with my food chopper the second time around and prefer it that way, but both are great.  I'm anxious to try the oreo version too.  What an easy and versatile recipe, THANKS!

I'm giving this five stars for consistancy and ease of preparation.  The consistancy was creamy and it froze well.  I used whole milk and added a can of sweetened condensed milk.  Next time I will only add 1/2 a tsp. of peppermint because it is a little strong.  My family loved it and I will make again.

This was very good but it was a little too salty.  I feel it would be better if it were also creamier.  I will make this again but I will be cutting back on the salt and using whole milk or more heavy cream.

I used an 1/8th teaspoon of peppermint oil instead of extract.  It's a little too minty for me, but my friends that are mint chocolate chip fans will love it!  I used Andes baking chips instead of chocolate chips.

Everyone loves this in our house! I used 1 percent milk as that's what we keep on hand as well as heavy whipping cream. I forgot the salt (oops!) but you couldn't tell from the end result. Used good quality dark chocolate chips that I chopped up. It was wonderful!

This one was perfect, I'm a little scared of custard base ice creams and I've been looking for an eggless recipe that actually looks and tastes like the good stuff, and this is definitely it.  I did add more essence and used my own peppermint plant but that's just cause I love peppermint

Ive stuck to the recipe EXACTLY, Im using a Kitchenmaid icecream maker....and this recipe didn't turn out well. It was crystalized all threw, light, my food colouring and cream sank to the bottom of the freezing bowl, leaving a light and not very hard crystal like ice cream. Im sorry...I just dont think, this recipe is that great. I would use 1/2 tsp of peppermint next time, I found it over powering at 1 tsp.

This is the best ice cream recipe I have ever made.  I halved the recipe to put into our ice cream ball, and used shaved mint chocolate instead of chocolate chips.  The only other change I made was to use mint extract instead of peppermint.

I will never buy mint chip ice cream from the store again.  This recipe is outstanding.  I used organic ingredients and made one change.  Instead of chocolate chips, I shaved chocolate from a very dark chocolate bar.  It gives the ice cream a more gourmet appearance and is very tasty.  I have also made this ice cream with 3 cups whole milk and one cup heavy cream, and it turned out well. (P.S. I ignored the green food coloring suggestion for health and aesthetic reasons.)

really fantastic. I'm a great fan of mint choc chip ice cream and this recipe didn't let me down. I don't like peppermint and I couldn't get hold of mint essence so i used crushed mint leaves instead. Next time I will grate in the chocolate as suggested by other reviwerers. Thanks for a great recipe.

Holy Cow this was good!!!  We actually did not do the mint chocolate chip recipe and just used the base recipe to make vanilla ice cream to RAVE reviews.  We doubled the recipe and it came out creamy and PERFECT!!!  Even after freezing for a day or two it still remained very creamy and tasted wonderful.  THANK YOU!  THANK YOU!

I just took a chef's taste before it went to the freezer to finish setting... wow this is good!!  The only change I made was carob chips instead of chocolate and I chopped them a little to make the pieces smaller.  I'm so happy to have a tasty ice cream recipe like this that doesn't involve scalding the milk!

Fantastic recipe.  I loved the fact that I didn't have to cook anything.  Easy and tasted great.  I traded mint flavor for orange and my whole family loved it.

Used 2 1/2 cups half and half cream and 1 1/2 cups heavy cream because that's what I had in the house. My ice cream maker was too full but I happen to have another ice cream maker. When I put half in the other maker, it seem to speed up the process way faster.  I always put the mixed ingredients into the freezer for 45 minutes before putting into the ice cream maker to speed up the freezing process, which is recommended by the manufacturer for mine. I only had peppermint/mint extract which I wasn't crazy about, It would have been better with just the mint flavour.  Never made ice cream without egg before, very good!!! Will make again.
Thanks!!!!

Wow, this was amazing! I made this with my boyfriend today and we both loved it. The recipe is really forgiving. We used whipping cream (instead of HEAVY whipping cream) and 1% milk because it's what we had on hand. It froze up just fine. I tasted the mixture before we started the machine and I was worried the vanilla was too overpowering, but once it froze it seemed to be just the right amount. Yummm!

This is wonderful! I replaced the milk and heavy whipping cream with half & half, extended the mixer to almost an hour, and let it chill overnight, but I stayed close to the recipe on all other counts. I admit that I was skeptical of a no-cook, no-egg recipe, especially when the pre-mixed ice cream had the suspicious consistency of milk. (This is after making incredibly rich ice cream that sticks to your mouth and feels like flan.) Nevertheless, it the recipe is incredibly easy--and much creamier than expected. Tired of the bitterness of the chocolate in store-bought ice cream, we grated a block of milk chocolate. Amazing. Will be making again!

Made this recipe for my husband over the weekend.  He said this was the best tasting mint chocolate chip ice cream he had ever had.  He was like a little kid waiting for the ice cream to freeze in the ice cream maker.  I used whole milk instead of 2% and chopped up Hershey bar, but I think I will try thin mint cookies next time.  We like that the ice cream stays a soft consistency instead of freezing rock hard like some other homemade ice creams.

This ice cream was pretty good, but a little too sweet for me.  Also, if it's not frozen solid (either before going in the freezer or as it's melting), it's too thick.  Needs less sugar, more mint, and the texture is off.  But I made it for my husband and he loves it, and it's pretty good when it's totally frozen.

I've made this a couple more times.  Reducing the sugar to 3/4 cup makes a HUGE difference, I think it's much better.  Try it.

We loved this, however, I used whole milk and it took longer in the freezer to set up.  I also only used 3/4 tsp. peppermint and next time I will only use 1/2 tsp. I also used 3/4 tsp. vanilla and it was fine.

Excellent ice cream!  We followed the recipe precisely - except that we found a new favorite use for candy canes!  We put 20 or so mini candy canes in the handy chopper and YUM!  We highly recommend trying this recipe :)

Mint choco chip ice cream is nearly impossible to come by in New Zealand, where I live and it is my favorite by far, so when I got an ice cream maker for Christmas I knew the most important recipe to find was this. I actually put in 3/4 cup of sugar and it is fantastic!

My niegbors and husband loved it! I made one minor change and made a custard base with eggs(3 yolks cooked with the cream unitl bubbles formed on the edges of the pot) to make a richer flavored ice cream.

This recipe is simple, but EXCELLENT! I am not even a fan of mint chocolate chip ice cream, but I am now. Per other reviewers suggestions, I did chop my chocolate chips before adding to the ice cream and it turned out wonderful. Highly recommend you give this recipe a try--very creamy!

I gave this recipe 3 stars but I did not make the recipe exactly.  To make it "lighter" I used half and half instead of the cream and whole milk instead of the 2%.  I do not recommend this as it was very icy.  My kids liked it but my husband and I did not.  I will try it again the correct way and not worry about the fat content!****4 stars! I made this again and used all half-n-half.  I heated it and stirred the sugar in.  Cooled the mixture.  Added about 1/2 the extracts and other ingredients.  It was wonderful!

Great recipe.  Not waxy like some homemade ice creams. We used shaved chocolate instead.  Unlike some other reviews, we thought the amount of peppermint and salt was just perfect and it froze up just right.  Everyone loved the recipe.

I just poured the soft serve into a plastic container for the hardening process in the freezer, and it's tasted pretty good so far. I'll re-rate it once it's harder. It's not super creamy like a high-fat ice cream, but its definitely not taste-less like the fat-free type. I used 2 cups of heavy whipping cream, which has a slightly less fat % than heavy whipping cream, but it works pretty much the same. The mini-chips kinda choked up my mixer after a bit, so maybe adding these by hand before freezing would work better? I was going to chop up some chocolate, but was too tired, will definitely do that for next time.

This is a great base for many types of ice cream. My husband loves this recipe especially, with mint extract and shaved dark chocolate is to die for. My kids love it as vanilla bean with crushed Oreos. So quick and easy. I always use whole milk because that’s what we keep in the house and it’s great.

I used one cup of whipping cream and 3 cups of milk, 1/2 cup of sugar and chocolate syrup (approx 1/8 cup) instead of chips.  I also used mint extract, not peppermint which for some reason gives ice cream a funky taste.  And no food coloring, why add something potentially unhealthy when it doesn't add anything.

Good and easy recipe, tastes pretty good.  Next time I would maybe chop the chocolate chips up a bit so the pieces are smaller.  I used minis but they were still kind of big and I'm all about more, but there were too many chips, so I'd probably cut that back a little (I may have used slightly more than a cup, though.  The consistency is good, I have really excellent vanilla but my peppermint maybe wasn't the best quality.  I also used whole milk as that's all I have.  I thought it would be creamier, but the consistency is a little more "ice milk" than "ice cream".  Still, a really good no-cook recipe.

Perfect recipe; I could not find spearmint extract at the supermarket, so I used mint extract instead which contained spearmint and peppermint. It was still delicious

So so amazing. Creamy, smooth ice cream. Placed in ice cream maker for about 30 minutes then in freezer for 20. Was too inpatient to wait for it to completely freeze so I had it at a soft sevre consistency. Added a fourth less of mint extract and was absolutely amazing. Would make this again.

I don’t agree with any of the comments around it being too minty. It was perfect! Also not that a few drops of green food coloring looks green before churning but loses a lot of color when it’s done. Just an FYI in case someone really wants it green!

I loved it wonderful but I would pour in melted chocolate instead of  chocolate chips but wonderful ice cream! It brakes up into little chunks when you mix it after the ice creams already been frozen for a couple minutes and it tasted way better that the mini choc. chips

I wish I would have ready the reviews first because the peppermint extract (McCormick) was definitely too strong.  I was hoping for a taste similar to Breyers Mint Chocolate Chip, but I'll have to try a different extract.  Hopefully the McCormick Mint extract will do the trick.

This recipe is great and when I made the ice cream, it came out perfectly! Instead of peppermint extract, I took real mint from our garden, and put it in the blender with a little bit of water, and it came out better! You could taste the REAL mint. Also, I don't understand why you need green food coloring, just because mint is green, doesn't mean the ice cream should be green.

Really easy and turned out great. My husband thought it could be more minty but I thought perfect as not overpowering. Think I might reduce number of chocolate chips next time as actual ice cream so yummy, but more personal preference.

Uh, we're talking super soft, light ice cream. That is mint flavored. With chocolate chips. And 2% milk to make it super light. Did I mention it's mint? YUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUM (obviously) :)

Delicious! I made this as the directions instructed but instead of chocolate chips I used a chocolate bar and shaved peices off so it was smoother in the ice cream. It is very creamy and light. The perfect amount of mint not to overwhelming but still strong. I really recommend making this!

This ice cream was absolutely delicious!  I did make two changes - I used whole milk instead of 2%.  It's ice cream it's supposed to be creamy.
After reading the reviews, I changed the peppermint extract to mint extract.  I think the peppermint extract would have been too "minty"
I used Ghiradelli mini chocolate chips and they were perfect.
I gave this 4 stars because of the changes I made and also because it overflowed in my ice cream maker because it made too much.  I wish someone had warned me about it.
If you love mint chocolate chip ice cream, give this a try.  You'll never go back to store bought, except in an ice cream emergency.

I like this recipe, it is generally very good and would use it again with small tweaks. I used only 3/4 tsp of salt, but would reduce it to 1/2 tsp next time. Also, I find it just a touch too sweet, would reduce sugar by a few tbsp.  I skipped the food colouring and used shaved dark chocolate instead of chocolate chips and that was a nice change.

This ice cream was a hit! I had a lot of half and half and whole milk, so I used those instead of whipping cream and 2%. It's not as creamy as I expected (could be because of the substitutions), but it's delicious!

I make this almost monthly all year long. Simple and real ingredients unlike almost all store bought versions.
I have tried doubling the mint extract for more mint flavor but doesn't change it too much. I also use about half the sugar and just love it. Benefit of homemade!

I followed the recipe exactly. I debated on peppermint vs. mint extract but trusted the recipe and got peppermint. This is NOT mint ice cream. It is peppermint ice cream. The title is misleading. Regret not going with my initial thought of buying the mint extract. Besides NOT being what it says it is, the consistency and flavor was good.

GREAT Mint Ice-cream recipe!

I simmered the mixture with 5 mint tea bags, and also added 1 tsp of peppermint extract. Also instead of sugar we used about 1/2-2/3 cup of honey. This is a DELICIOUS Recipe!!

I really loved this recipe. I made this for Father's day and we all agreed the flavor was amazing!  I used mint extract as others have stated and shaved a chocolate bar instead of using chips. My only complaint about this recipe is that while the flavor was wonderful we were left with a weird texture after each bite.  Almost like a coating of something. Has anyone else had this problem?

This is a very easy recipe! I used mint extract instead of peppermint...it's good. I used whole milk instead of 2%.... It's very good but too rich for me. Next time I'll  stick with the recipe. I added Thin Mint cookies at the end.

Really great flavor! Based on the comments I changed mine to a six serving batch for my 1.5 qt ice cream maker. I didn't have any 2% milk so I ended up using 2 c heavy whipping cream and 1 c whole milk. I was making this for Mother's Day and we don't like our ice cream too sweet so I only used 1/2 c sugar. Then I melted an entire 6oz bag of semi sweet morsals in the microwave and drizzled them into the ice cream maker at the very end. The chocolate hardened when it hit the ice cream and made tons of perfect little bits of chocolate throughout the ice cream. Perfect perfect perfect!!

I only made changes due to dietary restrictions (had to be dairy free), but I have to say, this recipe was perfect otherwise. I will definitely be using my modified version again, and can not recommend this one highly enough!

I added about twice as much peppermint extract for more flavor, and it is AWESOME. (It's possible that the extracts available in Europe aren't as strong as those in the US.)

Not enough peppermint flavour or green colour. Used mint choc chips which helped. Will use more extract and food colouring next time and it'll be perfect.

Reduced to 6 servings to fit my 1.5-qt freezer. Not enough mint flavor. Kept taste testing and adding more. Probably added close to 2 teaspoons. Next time might try 3. Definitely too much salt. Used a scant 1/8th teaspoon, and it was plenty. Added chopped up Andes mints in place of chocolate chips. Tasty!

Great ice cream! I think the mini chocolate chips were a little large and should have been chopped up, but my family liked it. I've also made a slightly modified version of this recipe with crushed candy canes and red food coloring. Yum!

It was good, I would maybe substitute the heavy cream for something lighter, use the peppermint extract, don't substitute it.

Every other recipe I have done has had a 2:1 ratio of heavy cream to milk, so I am not sure if the 1:1 here is what threw things off, but after 30 minutes in the ice cream maker, I still had only soup. Very disappointing.

This recipe as it is, is very icy and gritty. If you're looking for ice milk for low fat purposes this might be for you.  I made it exactly the way it's printed.  It's Not creamy or smooth at all.  I give it one star because it is edible.

Well the recipe said Mint Chocolate Chip and I have always personally preferred spearmint to peppermint. So I subbed spearmint extract for the peppermint and it was SO good! My guests raved about it being refreshingly different and it all disappeared rather quickly. Depending on the quality of the extract, I recommend starting with 3/4 tsp. and tasting the mix and take it from there. I used a TAD over 1 tsp. but I really love mint!

Love this stuff!!! I halved the recipe. I made my own half and half with heavy cream and 1% milk. I used 7 drops of peppermint essential oil. Just keep tasting until you like the mint flavor. And I used shaved chocolate. Next time I will use crushed up Oreos. That will be amazing. I adore this stuff. Stayed soft in freezer.

Ummm... Yum! Not your traditional style custard ice cream, which we are used to as far as homemade ice cream, but when you make this, it tastes more like "store bought", which everyone loved of course. Will definitely make again. FYI - I think it only needs closer to 1/8 of a cup of chocolate chips for this amount of ice cream. Can't wait to eat more!

Holy wow. This came out phenomenally. I will never bother with the long version again or the egg version. This was easier, is healthier, and the result is very impressive! I made two changes: (1) I used mint extract instead of peppermint, (2) I chopped the mini chocolate chips and then added half a bag of chopped mint oreos. SO GOOD.

Really liked the recipe. It had a very nice mint color and a good texture. The only thing I did differently was that I didn't use chocolate chips. Instead, I used a knife to shave off small pieces of chocolate from a chocolate bar; it gave the ice cream a much nicer consistency.

Holy ice cream Batman! This is exactly why we bought an ice cream maker! I did change 2 ingredients based on what I had on hand. I used coconut milk instead of 2% milk and 4 drops peppermint oil instead of peppermint extract. And of course I omitted the food coloring because who wants that junk in their food anyway! It is a fantastic recipe that I hope you try.

I modified it a little bit. I put in a packet of instant vanilla pudding, used peppermint schnapps instead of peppermint extract, and I've had a habit lately of adding cornstarch to make the ice cream easier to scoop after you refreeze it.  And my son says it's not green enough.  They like it so it's a success for me.

I just made this...I have a cheap ice cream maker so I use it to mix it then I transfer it to another container and let it freeze for a few hours. I did taste it before I put it in the freezer. All I can say is amazing. I did use "Mint" extract and not peppermint. I did buy some peppermint extract so I could compare the two.

I made this recipe as is, but halved and with crushed oreos instead of chocolate chips. Also, I used whole milk, as I didn't have 2%. Overall, it turned out good. My only complaints are that it has a very butterminty taste (likely due to the specific peppermint extract I used) and after eating several spoonfuls, there's a kind of oily coating, which I think is also from the peppermint extract. If I make this again, I would slightly decrease the amount of peppermint extract used. Good recipe though.

I have had my Kitchen Aid ice cream maker attachment for a couple of months and had been looking for a good recipe with which to use it for the first time, and this recipe was worth the wait. Most recipes call for eggs or lots of ingredients and chilling the ice cream batter for hours. Well, I just do not have that kind of patience. Not only does this recipe have few ingredients, the flavor and consistency are wonderful. I did use whole milk and, as others suggested, reduced the salt. I am looking forward to adding different flavorings and candies as I will be making this often. Thank you!

Love this recipe!!! It is my go to base ice cream. I omit the chocolate and peppermint and add vanilla beans to make plain vanilla and it is so good. I have also used butter vanilla extract instead of regular and it turns it into butter pecan ice cream (pecans optional). All around great base ice cream recipe!!!

Great recipe. Considering that it is not a custard-based ice cream, it is creamy & delicious. I make it frequently, though I do reduce the vanilla to 1/2 tsp and increase the mint to 1 tsp.

Delicious!  Everyone loved it.  I pulsed my mini chips in the food processor to make the chips a little less uniform.  Love having fine chocolate shavings and chunks in my ice cream. The only thing stopping me from giving it a 5 star rating was it could have used a little more mint extract, maybe another 1/8th teaspoon.  Will definitely make again but am going to increase the mint extract.  Love it.

Delicious! I used almond milk in place of the regular because I actually prefer my ice cream to be on the lighter side. Texture was compromised but it was still very yummy and creamy from the heaving whipping cream. I also added 2 eggs (yes raw eggs!) Which added some creamyness as well. I used bitter sweet chocolate, chopped it up until it was very tiny. I also used peppermint oil and it only took about 4-5 drops to achieve the right amount of mint for my taste. Definitely a keeper!

Very easy and very good! I used mint extract instead of peppermint, 3/4 cup sugar instead of 1 cup and grinded down reg chocolate chip morsels as I don't like big chunks of chocolate chips in my ice cream. Blended everything in blender, threw in my ice cream maker for 30 mins...yum..cant wait to eat later :)

Love this recipe...so far! It's still in the process of freezing, but it tastes great! I'm using shaved milk chocolate and I added a little extra peppermint extract. I cannot wait. I do have to say though... If you use shaved chocolate, wait until the icecream is soft serve frozen before you mix it in. If you put it through the icecream maker, the chocolate will break apart and it won't be pretty. Learned that from a precious recipe I tried!

I loved this- as modified it gets 5 stars. I used full cream milk and because I don't know what heavy cream is (Australia) I used 300ml double cream and 200ml thickened cream. 1/4 tsp salt. I also used crushed  flake chocolate bars instead of choc chips. After reading the reviews I was going to use mint essence but the shop only had peppermint and it was fine. I thought the amount of peppermint essence was about right. Not too strong, just refreshing. This was my first attempt at icecream and is so good!

If I hadn't changed the main components of the ice cream, I'd rate it a 5!  But...I used half & half instead of cream which gave it more of a frozen yogurt texture.  I absolutely LOVED this recipe, but I will admit it's hard to go wrong with mint chocolate chip.  As others recommended, I doubled the peppermint extract...but no food coloring for my family.  I will absolutely make this again!

Delicious! I took another's reviewers advice and whipped the ice cream in my kitchen aid for  a few minutes before putting it into the ice cream maker. Not sure if it made a difference, but I know I loved the texture and consistency. Next time, I'd like to try chocolate shavings instead of chocolate chips.

Most amazing ice cream recipe. If I'm gonna spend my calories on ice cream though, I want it creamy- so I don't use 2% milk, I sub half-n-half. Also I have to reduce this recipe in servings to 6, or else as it freezes it overflows in my quisenart. So be careful, its a mess when that happens.

This ice cream was super yummy! There was no filmy texture on the roof of my mouth which was great, I listened to some reviews and lessened the peppermint to 3/4 tsp and it was perfectly minty! If you can stand to wait, let it freeze for the 2 hours. Yummy! Will definitely be making this again

The proportions of this recipe (Milk, cream, sugar and salt) are the same as I use for my personal ice cream "base", to which I add a variety of different flavors and mix-ins.  My suggestion for those that think the ice cream has a strong mint flavor with 1 tsp of mint extract is to double or even triple up on the vanilla. I usually use 1 Tbsp total of extract, so in this case 1 tsp of mint and 2 of vanilla works for me. I usually just dump the whole bag of mini chips in about 5 minutes before I pull it from the freezer bowl.  1 cup is good, but 2 is better, right?  It doesn't need eggs, especially if you're not going to cook it first.  I also highly recommend using crushed Oreos instead of the chocolate chips.  It's like a creamy Thin Mint cookie.  Yum!

Easy and delicious!  I added the mini-chocolate chips to the whole mixture at the beginning.  Turned out fine and even made the ice cream light brown in color.  (I skipped the green food coloring.)  Kids voted it the best homemade ice cream so far!

Delicious!  I didn't have 2% so I used whole milk and it turned out perfect.  I took the advice of other reviewers and shaved a bar of semi-sweet chocolate.  I think it ended up being about 2/3 cup of shavings and it was just right.  Thanks for the recipe!

This ice cream is soooooo good! Instead of chocolate chips, we added crushed oreos. Seriously yummy! The only thing I would change next time is regular whipping cream as opposed to heavy whipping cream. It was a tad bit too creamy, kind of left a film on the inside of your mouth:/...but all around a fabulous recipe!

This is a very simple recipe.  I used all cream (no milk).  In the future, I'll follow others' advice and use less mint extract and small chocolate chips.  I used chocolate chunks - bad call!  :)

I was pleasantly pleased that this ice cream recipe is so easy. The biggest plus was that the ice cream is great.  No crystals. Not rock hard after freezer stay. I changed the original version by using 2 cups whole milk; 1 cup half and half; and 1 cup heavy cream. This is an excellent base that one could add any flavoring choice.

this tastes EXACTLY like mint 'n chip ice cream without the hassle of making a creme en glaze! Love it. But, even with my ice cream maker insert having been frozen for weeks, it took more like 50 minutes before the ice cream was thick enough to add the chips.

Loved it! Made it exactly as written (except 1% milk because we didn't have 2%) and it was a hit! Very delicious with great texture and flavor. Even the mini chips were perfect in it. Would not change a thing. Thanks for a great treat!

I made this ice cream at school manually with the traditional cans. But instead of using chocolate mint, I turned it into a cookies and cream flavored ice cream!my classmates went ballistic with this recipe! they all wanted to grab a bite and not to mention another helping. here's how I changed it. Instead of using 2% milk, I used full cream milk. and I didn't put peppermint but instead I added 1-2 tsps of vanilla extract. I also added the cream filling from the oreo cookies to the mixture! The recipe is love!

I am thrilled to bits with this recipe!  Granted, I don't have an ice cream maker...but it's been in my freezer for 4 hours and it was setting up nicely.  I did have to stir up the chips again because they sunk but that's not a problem...I'm happy to be making this without an ice cream maker!  I used a glass dish for the first 4 hours and now transferred it to two plastic containers...it will be gone soon enough and I'm nervous to freeze glass.  The taste is amazing, which is why I'm rating it before it's completely set...thank you for a great tasting recipe I've made completely organic!

Wow! My family couldn't even wait for it to freeze. We had a bit of "soft serve" before putting into the freezer.  I used whole milk instead of 2/% because that is what I had, but that's the only change.  Thanks for a terrific, quick recipe!

Next time will use 1 cup heavy cream, 1 cup fat free half and half, 2 cups 1% or skim milk. The texture was nice, but I would rather reduce the fat content. Used mint extract instead of peppermint, next time will NOT use vanilla because the vanilla overpowered the mint. Mini chips were too hard once frozen, prefer chocolate shavings.

We all LOVE this! I read the reviews before I made it & decided to use half sugar & half Splenda. The next time I will reduce the total amount of sweetener to 3/4 cup. Also, I will reduce the amount of chocolate. I used Ghiradelli's bittersweet chocolate chips and chopped them before adding to the freezer. I also used my Cuisinart ice cream freezer and the recipe fit perfectly! I did not have the "grittiness" others mentioned.

Very refreshing!  I used 1 tablespoon of the mint extract instead of the peppermint and vanilla.  My husband likes his without chocolate, so we just added the chips to part of the ice cream after it was mixed in the machine, as we were pouring it into containers for the freezer.

The first time I made this I found it a bit crunchy so the second time I cooked all of the ingredients on the stove top to make sure the sugar was completely dissolved.  Much better.

Delicious!  My Dad's favorite-he says taste just like what he gets at the local icecream shop.  I used 3/4 tsp. peppermint extract and I thought it was still pretty strong.  Instead of the mini chips, I shredded one milk chocolate bar so they would melt quickly in the mouth and not be hard.  Will definately add this to my favorites.  Thanks!

Very, very good. My son wanted mint chocolate chip ice cream for his birthday party and this one is a winner. If I had any issues, it's that even the mini chips are still a bit big on the tooth for ice cream. I think a few pulses in the food processor would knock them down in size and make them more appealing in the ice cream. Still, this is a great recipe.

Super Easy.  My 3-year old helped make this ice cream.  We used 2 cups of whole milk and 1 cup of whipping cream because that's what we had on hand.  We also substituted mint extract for the peppermint and we used ground dark chocolate chips instead of the mini chips.  Delicious and execptional texture!!!

Wow, this is GREAT ice cream, and is so easy.  It tastes lighter than some of the others, which we really liked.  I might actually use a little more mint next time.  I agree with others that the base would be great for cookies and cream also.  We all loved it.

Great ice cream! I followed cookinmama's advice and cut the peppermint extract down to 3/4 tsp. and the vanilla to 1/2 tsp. and I highly recommend using a good quality chocolate and shaving it instead of using the chips. Lastly, I tried to sub 1% milk and it just isn't the same.

Fabulous and refreshing!  My family thought the taste was similar to Doublemint gum.  I used 3/4 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp mint (not peppermint) extract, 2c heavy cream, 1c half and half and 1c skim milk.  The mini chips were good, I will probably try shaved chocolate next time.  And there will be a next time!

I haven't made homemade ice cream in awhile and all of our family likes Mint Chocolate Chip Ice Cream.  This was so easy and so delicious.  Just don't make the mistake that I made by using regular chocolate chips (they are too big for this recipe).  Definately recommend this recipe.  Already added it to my Recipe Box!

WOW I bought an ice cream maker but thought making it was going to be time consuming and hard. Then we found this recipe... It's amazingly good and we will probably never purchase ice cream again. We tried to modify the recipe to make C&C but it just didn't come out right.. That's okay, the mint chip is sooooooooo good that we don't care. Absolutely wonderful recipe, delicious and easy. It's a keeper!!!

Easy & tastes great. Mine came out not quite as creamy as I like ice cream, so next time I think I'll use whole milk instead of 2%.  Instead of mini-chocolate chips, I roughed up regular ones in the food processor.  Plenty of chocolate bits in every bite.

This is the best! Some alterations. I used pure peppermint flavoring, which is peppermint extracted into various oils without alcohol. I tripled the peppermint--maybe the non-alcohol-type flavoring is not as strong. I doubled the vanilla. I halved the salt. No color. Cut back on the sugar, perhaps by a fifth. Then, I put the whole mess into the blender with the chocolate chips. Still a little too chunky for me. Next time I'll leave the blender on longer.

Very Good.  I used a mint extract and thought it was just regular mint. Both my husband and daughter (independently) said that it tastes like toothpaste. After I made the ice cream I read the label on the package and the bottle and one said that it was spearmint and oil of peppermint and the other one said that it was spearmint and wintermint. The taste was still very good but I will try peppermint next time. I will also use smaller chunks of chocolate as it was difficult to eat for kids.  Yes, I will still make it again.

So easy, so wonderful, so delicious!  I reduced the mint essence a little - but I guess that's a personal taste (my hubby equated the heavy mint flavour to toothpaste during my 1st attempt!). Rave reviews from everyone at the office when I brought it to the office.

True to the recipe name - this WAS easy. I substituted chopped up Andes Candies for the chocolate and loved it. Go heavy on the green food coloring to make it look like mint chocolate chip from the store. Great recipe!

I don't have an ice cream maker, so I just used this recipe for the old fashioned ziploc baggie method, but this tasted incredible! Mint Choco ice cream is my favorite and this recipe is no exception. It was perfect, though I will only add 1/2 tsp vanilla, instead of 1 tsp, it was too prominent for my liking. My husband liked it so much, he was sipping the mixture before it was frozen.

great flavor and i love that it doesnt use eggs!  i made the recipe exactly as stated.  it just had a hint of mint.  i am not a big mint lover, but i think i may add a little more peppermint next time (maybe 1/2 tsp.).  didnt taste too sugary either, although i think decreasing it to at least 3/4 c. or even 1/2 c. wouldnt hurt it one bit either.  this recipe would be great with chopped andes mints instead of the chocolate chips.  one thing i have to say about this recipe is that it did have alot of chocolate chips.  i was trying to give my 1 year old some without any chocolate chips and i was hard pressed getting some ice cream without getting the chips too.  next time i am going to reduce the choc. chips to 1/2 c.   fantastic recipe! thank you update:  i made this with 1 cup whole milk and 1 cup skim milk, 1 cup chopped mint oreos, and 3/4 cup of sugar.  yum yum!  next time i will add even less sugar and maybe not the whole milk - tasted great the way it was, but it's always good to make it healthier!

This is good and easy to make.  My grandfather is in love with this ice cream and now requests this instead of lemon meringue pie for his birthday.

I stuck to the recipe. It was a little too minty for the 3 yo so next time would cut mint extract in half. Also I chopped up a semisweet candy bar instead of chips, worked well but next time I think I will try mint candy like Andes after dinner mints. It also was a little grainy- I dont know why. I will probably try it again.

I changed the following things: I used 1-1/2 t. peppermint, 1/2 t. vanilla, and 10 drops of green food coloring, I pulsed the chocolate chips in my Cuisinart, and I mixed it in a smoothie blender then poured it into the ice cream maker reserving 2 cups as it was more than the maker could hold. My wife's favorite ice cream is mint chocolate chip by Kemps but after trying what I made she's done with the store bought stuff. Yeah, it's that good.

Amazing! I actually used fat-free milk and it turned out fine. All my friends loved it and there wasn't any left! I also used half the amount of chocolate chips and through in some brownie chunks. I will DEFINITELY make it again!

I did mine a little different. I fallowed all of the directions, but i don't have an ice cream maker. So i just put the mixture into a freezer safe bowl and put it in the freezer. You have to make sure you break it up every thirty minitures, for about 2 hrs. so ice crystals don't form. It was very good though.

This recipe is the same as the basic vanilla recipe that comes with the ice cream freezer - just add mint, coloring and chips.  I wish I hadn't, though.  Turns out the mint flavoring I had in the cabinet is just that - flavoring.  This needs EXTRACT.  Even then, though, it's the reviewers suggestions that make this recipe good -- oreos, shaved chocolate... I suggest broken Keebler grasshopper cookies.

Fantastic!  Absolutely could not have worked out better.  I just bought the KitchenAid Ice Cream Maker attachment for my KA stand mixer and this is the first recipe I've tried.  It was so easy and turned out perfectly.  Loved that it didn't include eggs and didn't need to be cooked.  Thank you so much for posting this recipe... DH and the kids ate every bite and licked the bowls clean :)

This is recipe is AWESOME!! For those who absolutely LOVE Mint Chocolate chip ice cream will LOVE this!! I did try and chop up the chocolate chips. I added them at the beginning of the mixture because I forgot that I was suppose to add them after 10 minutes and It still turned out great! Plus, and I don't know if this matters- I used Mint extract instead of peppermint. It's just plain AWESOME!!  I will make this ALWAYS!! Way better than any store bought or ice cream shop!  Thank you!!!!

As a first time ice cream maker, this recipe was very simple to make. It tasted so delicous and creamy. Like others, I chopped a chocolate bar up, and it was GREAT!!! I will definitly make this again soon.

Very yummy!!!  I chopped up the chocolate chips as well and will probably use shaved dark chocolate next time.  I will also reduce the amount of vanilla because I'm looking for a really minty ice cream.  Rave reviews when I served it to friends!!!

This ice cream is so smooth and creamy! I don't usually even like mint chocolate chip ice cream, and I have eaten almost half of this by myself!! I will for sure make this again! The only change I made was that I chopped up the chips like other reviewers did.  Next time I am going to buy a chocolate candy bar and shave it with my veggie peeler.

Excellent recipe--very close to store-bought in creaminess and taste. I chopped the mini chocolate chips in the blender as suggested by others and was very pleased with the texture.
This recipe is easy to make with ingredients on hand.  It's a keeper for sure.  My kids claimed it was the best ice cream EVER!!

This is excellent ice cream.  It has a light feel in the mouth instead of some of the heavier versions.  I upped the amount of peppermint extract as my family likes strong flavors.  I had no problem with the miniature chips, though i do think shaved chocolate would be better.

This was my first time making home made ice cream.  It was a great hit with my family.  My grandchildren said it was as good as their favorite ice cream store. I do think the chocolate chips should be VERY small or grated to make them a bit better. Thanks for the great recipe.

We opted for no food coloring but the taste was really good.  The consistency wasn't as good as store bought so we'll have to keep working on it.  It was so much fun to make and this was great recipe to start.

The flavor was delicious! I used cream and whole milk and the texture was not as creamy as I'd like. Next time I'll use more heavy cream.
