Very simple and perfect to throw together for a weeknight meal.  The meatballs were simple to make and turned out very good. I used Italian style bread crumbs and added a little more Parmesan cheese. I didn't use jarred sauce - sorry Classico... I used "Best Marinara Sauce Yet" that I froze just to keep on hand to thaw for occasions just like this. I put the rolls under the broiler and then assembled the sandwich. My husband loved these!

I make up a big batch of these meatballs and freeze them.  I take them out as I need them for sandwiches or pasta sauces.  There are so good!!!!  I make them exactly as the recipe states, but I double it.  I will never buy frozen meatballs from the store again.

These were pretty good.  I'll make these again but with my simple homemade sauce instead.

These meatballs are wonderful!!!  By far my favorite so far.  So easy, so good, my husband can't get enough of these!  The only change I make is adding a bit more parmesan and some romano cheese, about 1/4 cup or so combined.  Thank you so much for this recipe!

This recipe always turns out great. I have tried the exact recipe.  I have also tried using dried parsley instead of fresh ( reduced to 1 tablespoon), also used leftover ground wheat bread  as breadcrumbs. This was great with spaghetti.
