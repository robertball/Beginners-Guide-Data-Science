Delicious. I had intended to serve this dish as an accompaniment but as soon as I tasted them just out of the oven, I decided that we should have this as a dessert sauce with French vanilla ice cream. So we did.
I made this as written except I didn't have cardamom so I omitted it. Also, I used six plums instead of four. Going forward, I would probably double the recipe to ensure plenty of the liquid, and I would perhaps cut the plums into quarters rather than halves if serving as a dessert sauce. If it is being served with an entree, then the plum halves would work fine.

Honestly, the cumin had me concerned, but not to worry, this was delicious.  The sauce thickened somewhat after cooling down a bit.  Give this a try, it's not only tasty and easy, but GOOD FOR YOU too.  ***UPDATE 7.26.16***  I have probably made this recipe a dozen times, and we just never tire of it.  It has just the right amount of sweetness, and the flavor of the plum is not masked by too much sugar like many other plum recipes.  This is our FAVORITE!!  ***UPDATE 11.7.18*** We continue to love this dessert, making it often, not only because it tastes delicious, but also. because it's so darn easy to make.  Just one more comment.  These plums are good served either warm or chilled.  I make no changes to this recipe other than using TruviaÂ® brown sugar as a substitute.

WOW!  These were so wonderful and couldn't have been any easier to make. I followed the recipe exactly, and WOW!  I wasn't sure about the combination of spices, so I made a test batch, but WOW...I'll be using the rest of the plums to make this for a delicious dessert to bring to my neighbors party!  WOW!

Fast, easy, and very good -- my toddlers even licked it up! But I do think it could be even better if it had a companion flavor to complement the spicy sweet-tartness of the plums. Next time, I think I'll serve it with a sweet biscuit or with Vanilla ice cream. in the hopes that might take this recipe from very good to fabulous.

Awesome.  Perfect as a summer treat.  I added some toasted almonds and topped this with ice cream.

I was not all that keen on these.  For me it was the cumin. It just ruined the taste and I found it over powering.  Also this recipe makes ALOT of sauce for just 4 plums. I didn't use nearly have of the sauce to cover the plums. And when I "drizzled" the sauce over top all the sauce pooled on the bottom of the pan and did not thicken or bubble while cooking.  I ended up thickening the left over sauce with cornflour till it was REALLY thick and stirred it into some warmed custard. On the plus side my toddler ate 3 plum pieces and the sauce/custard without any hesitation.

Excellent way to use up some plums from my tree! They were still a bit tart after I made them, so I sprinkled some sugar on after baking and that seemed to help. I served mine warm with butter pecan ice cream.

I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe; thank you so much for sharing it!  I doubled my batch, and followed the recipe exactly.  First time I baked with plums, and I'm so glad I tried this one.  I'll bet these would be great pureed into a sauce - what a great flavor.

Delicious as is! I eat this over vanilla bean ice cream. I also didn't have cardamom -- but it still tasted great.

I used a whole punnet of plums - I think about ten, and a lot less sugar - about two teaspoons, and didn't have ant orange juice, so I gave it a slug of red wine.
Tasted great - and some left over to have with porridge in the morning. I'll definitely be making this again

This is a great recipe. I would definitely make them again. The only thing I changed is adding a dash of salt and pepper into the juice mixture. And then when they came out of the oven I sprinkled a little sea salt on top. It's especially great with ice cream.

This recipe is exactly to my taste! I tested it out for parties and I can't went to serve it my family for Christmas.  It's very sweet, but doesn't really have a dessert taste, in my opinion.  My family and I agree that the best way to serve this would be as a side dish to something savory like chicken, which would temper some of the sweetness.

Great recipe.  I used less than the recommended cumin.  I also added apples, orange zest, and water.  Reduced the sauce before pouring it over the plums and roasting everything. 

I would imagine you could also blend all the ingredients (after roasting), and reduce in a sauce pan to make a more intense sauce that could be used to compliment all types of dishes.

I made these just as written except I didn't have the  cardamon.
I thought they were very tasty, but most of my family didn't like the texture and the spices where too intense for them.  I probably won't make them again.  If I do, it won't be until next year when I get more plums from my tree and I'd decrease the
spices by half.

My goodness these were so good!!! I added ground cayenne to give them more kick. I served them with french toast and used the sauce over everything instead of syrup. What a great recipe, thank you for sharing it with us.

Very good! I used a lot less sugar and don't really recommend doing that unless your fruit is very very ripe!

This was very different, and I'm glad I tried it. I had a small amount over vanilla frozen yogurt. The sauce was good, but my plums tasted very tart, and I didn't care for their texture either. If I'm going to have fruit this way, I think I'll stick with more traditional fruits and sauces.

The sauce is fab.  I used one whole orange liquified in the blender, so my sauce was plenty thick.  Tart plums, though...kinda killed it.  I think I'll cut these suckers up and drown them in another batch of the sauce with some extra sugar.  And then, I think I'll make a pitcher of the sauce (using whole oranges) and serve it warm for parties.  It smells so good while it's baking!  Wish my plums hadn't been so tart :/
