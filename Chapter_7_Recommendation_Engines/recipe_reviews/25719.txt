Yes, this makes a very rich, creamy soup. It was quite filling and, with croutons and some bread, was a very satisfying meal. I used Half and Half to lower the fat content and found it quite suitable. In fact, the pumpkin puree is so smooth and rich, I feel even a low fat 2% milk or even water would suffice. I have yet to experiment! I found it difficult to cut and cube the sweet pumpkin raw, so I seeded it and cut it in half, drizzled it with oil and baked it in the oven with the other vegetables with the skin on. After 40 minutes or so the skin just fell off and I could continue baking the pumpkin until nice and soft. I am also going to try adding a few cloves of garlic to the roasted vegetables to give it some added zing next time! One last word of caution...watch the nutmeg. It gives the soup a real nice flavor, but too much can be overpowering. I really recommend giving this soup a try...it is rich and flavor-some and quite easy to prepare.

This soup was absolutely delicous!  The only changes I made were to use 2% milk instead of cream and I used about 1 teaspoon of nutmeg which was just right.  Everyone loved it and asked for seconds!

I made this recipe for 50 people - a great success!  I added a couple of large garlic bulbs to the roasting vegetables and squeezed out the roasted cloves to add in when pureeing the soup.  Only used 1 teaspoon nutmeg based on 4kg pumpkin.  The roasted flavor was distinctive, and the soup was not sweet.  The roasted garlic flavour came through strongly due to the quantity I used - but would do the same again!  The best pumpkin soup I've ever made - and I've made plenty!  My family loves soup - this will become a regular.

This soup is rapidly becoming a family favorite. The first time I made it I didn't have any nutmeg on hand, but I did have garam masala and it went even better with the soup. Also, 2% or skim milk work just fine if you're watching calories. Also, if you overcook the veggies a bit, the onions get caramelized and add a nice richness to the soup

I normally don't like pumpkin soup, but I inherited a HUGE pumpkin from my parents veggie patch, so I thought I'd give it a try. This recipe is very easy, and the soup turned out great! I doubled it, thinking it'd fill a 9 litre pot, but it still only filled just over half - I will triple it next time, as it got eaten very quickly by my 5 flatmates! I added 4 cloves of garlic, and a little less nutmeg, I think next time I'll experiment by adding a sweet potato to the normal potatoes. This one's a keeper :)

This is my favourite pumpkin soup yet - it has a beautiful creamy texture, and a roast vegetable flavour.  I especially love the nutmeg in this soup.

good, but not worth the trouble. easier to just make all in the pot on the stove and tastes just as good. don't put roasted pumpkin seeds on top. hard to eat with the soup.

This recipe was absolutely delicious, especially with the taste of the nutmeg and roasted vegetables (I added 3 cloves of garlic in with the veggies before roasting them). Will definitely be making this again and again! :)

this soup is delicious! i followed the advice of others and upped the roasting time to ~1 hour but  the carrots were still crunchy so i had to finish them off in the microwave. because i roasted so long i didn't have to use the immersion mixer, just a couple of vigorous stirs w/ a wooden spoon & the soup became "rustically-creamy"...i wanted a few chunks remaining.   like another reviewer said, i used plain low-fat yogurt in place of the heavy cream to cut down on fat grams & calories. i also cut back on the nutmeg & slightly on the pepper. i finished it off w/ bacon (italian speck) cut in strips for a topping...delicious! all-in-all...a WONDERFUL find! thanks!  i made it monday night for my roommate & his friend & i'm making it again for a church dinner this sunday!

If you puree too much, the entire thing turns mushy. So, I set some pumpkin aside and pureed that, then cubed the rest and all other veggies and tossed them in. That much nutmeg was a little unnecessary, so we left it out. Overall recipe still unimpressive, don't think I'll be making this again.

I followed the recipe exactly and it is excellent. However, I do agree with cutting down the pepper a bit. Also, the roasting time given is not sufficient to get the vegetable done. I t results in what one reviewer called crunchy soup. So roast longer. Other than that, it's a very tasty soup with crusty buns on a cold fall day!

I made this soup with a few tiny modifications and it was EXCELLENT!   So very tasty. Added garlic to vegetables, used half quantity of heavy cream and nutmeg, but added some cinnamon and cumin. .......(2)  3 cloves of Garlic - add to roasting pan with pumpkin and carrots and flavour with your favourite seasoned sea salt; ......(4) After cooking potato in bouillon, add pumpkin, carrots and garlic mixture and allow flavours to mix.  Let cool to warm.......(5) Add mixture to blender to blend.  I like my soup with bits, so did not puree.   Return to pot, add 1/2 cup heavy cream, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 tps cinnamon and a dash of cumin.

Not sure what I did wrong!! This tasted VERY bad. I didn't use a sugar pumpkin, and I didn't use cream-- I used 2% milk. I used two red potatoes. Not sure what happened!

Excellent soup.  Followed advice of others acut pumpkin into quarters, roasted it in its skin, and scooped out when done. (Much easier than peeling.) Used 2% milk instead of cream to save some calories, and cut the nutmeg back to a teaspoon.  This one is a keeper!

I would like to say 4 or 5 stars, but it was way too peppery!  Unfortunately 1 tsp of pepper took away from an otherwise wonderful soup.  I would go with 1/4 or 1/2 tsp next time.  And I only used 1/2 tsp of nutmeg which in my opinion was the perfect amount.  Otherwise, I did adjust this recipe but pretty much stuck with the general idea.  I didn't roast the veggies as I found this recipe while in the middle of baking the pumpkin.  I just sauteed everything (added 1 clove of chopped garlic) and added vegetable broth and let that cook for 20 minutes before adding pumpkin and blending with the hand-held blender.  Because I'm trying to be good, I used plain fat free yogurt in place of the cream and was still good.  I think it would have been extra special with cream and the roasted veggies.  This is definitely an excellent soup but I would reduce the pepper!

I had two small cans of pumpkin and a lot of dark meat left over from Thanksgiving.  I followed the recipe, except that I roasted my canned pumpkin puree with the oil and a little dried onion as I was out of fresh.
Since I'd used two cans of pumpkin, the soup turned out a little too thick and I added 2% milk - about 2 cups - to reach a veloute consistency.  Then I added about two cups of minced leftover turkey and about 1 tsp garlic salt and a touch of white pepper.  The flavor of the soup held up admirably in spite of what must have been extra pumpkin on my part and I fell in love with this recipe.  It's a keeper and worthy to pass on to friends and relatives.  Kudos.

My favorite soup recipe so far this season!  It's definitely easier to just roast the pumpkin in halves with the skin on, then scoop out the flesh later.  My husband isn't a big fan of nutmeg so I used cumin instead (as another reviewer suggested) and it was the perfect mix of savory and sweet.  I will definitely make again.

Oh this is a yummy soup, nice and thick, I took one of the reviewers advice and roasted a whole garlic in there and drizzeled oil over it and it just squeezes out I added 4 cloves to it and it was unnoticable I'll add more next time as I love garlic.  I once had a pumpkin soup that had cummin in it and I lost it so instead of nutmeg I put a little cummin in it and it hads a nice suttle flavour, I will definatly be making this one again.
Thanks Craig,
Leanne

I have been making this recipe now for a couple of years, and it is definitely a fall/winter staple in my diet! I've found that steaming the vegetables for about 10-15 minutes before putting them in the oven allows you to cook them less time in the oven (about 30 minutes), therefore cutting down on the possibility of the vegetables burning and eliminating the little carbon flakes in the final product but still giving it a subtle smoky flavor. I also use olive oil as opposed to vegetable oil as I prefer its flavor, and use vegetable bouillon as opposed to chicken. Finally, I usually add 2-3 large cloves of garlic to the roasting vegetables about 10 minutes before they've finished roasting, which adds another element to the soup that really rounds it out. Love this recipe!!

This was easy to make, if you are patient with the cutting.   I made enough for 12, so I used one white potato and one sweet potato instead of two white potato. I added 8 cloves of garlic. I peeled the pumpkin AFTER I roasted the pieces. I learned that my 20+ year old food processor is NOT water tight, so I almost lost my broth, but I got most of it back out, pured the veggies, and then hand-whipped it into the broth and cream. I thought I had nutmeg, but it turned out I had allspice, so in it went. I shredded a little fresh ginger into it, too. A friend suggested that. Chopped up an apple and threw in the chunks AFTER it was pured and reheated. Gave it a few bites of sweetness.  It tastes good, but not that much like pumpkin. Maybe because I just used a regular old pumpkin and not a sugar pumpkin? Anyway, I'd try this recipe again, but with the nutmeg and a sugar pumpkin.

Absolutely no flavor at all.  I added all spice, cinnamon, a little cayenne pepper, and a little sugar in an attempt to salvage the soup.  I wish I could take away some of the nutmeg the recipe called for.

Amazing recipe. Really loved this. I roasted the pumpkin prior to cutting up as it is really difficult before it is cooked as it is too hard. Loved the nutmeg and cream in this.

I made this today! I did some modification for a healthier menu, replacing the cream with non fat milk, and it's great!

Great recipe, very simple, also economical, and makes pumpkin soup lovers out of people that don't like pumpkins or soup from my experience.

It's a little more work to use a fresh pumpkin, but it's totally worth it.  I went light on the onion, but added about twice the potato and carrot. I halved the nutmeg, and used white pepper instead of black. Add salt slowly--I needed less than a teaspoon!

Great recipe. I dropped the cream (because I didn't have any) and the potato and it still came out pretty thick. My husband and two year old daughter finished the whole pot. I've seen a couple pumpkin soup recipes that don't call for baking the pumpkin first and I think that makes all the difference. Perfect recipes for getting lots of veg in.

Yum! I loved this soup and my whole family enjoyed it as well. The rich flavor that comes from roasting the veggies is what make the soup so delicious. As recommended by other reviewers I roasted the pumpkin along with the other veggies then scooped it from the shell. I also roasted several cloves of garlic to throw in. I only used a few grinds of pepper and nutmeg, not nearly the amount called for. It turned out even better than I had hoped!

This soup was excellent. The only change I made was to add some ground ginger. Next time I think I will put in a little cinnamon as well. Will definitely make again!

This is my first pumpkin soup recipe and I have to admit that it's one of the best soup I've ever tried!!It's full of flavour and creamy.Thanks for the great recipe.I followed the recipe except I didnt use ground pepper nor nutmeg because I didnt have them in my cupboard and didn't really want to buy them just for this recipe since I dont use them often enough.I'll use this one from now on.I made a big pot and it's all gone.My family and friends loved it SO MUCH!! :)

I made this recipe for my family at Thanksgiving and they loved it!  All was silent except for the occasional, "mmmm!" from several of them! Since the stores were all out of fresh pumpkin, I was forced to substitute canned pumpkin.  But it turned out fabulous!

I've made this recipe 4 times since November and "tweaked" it with other reviewers suggestions and its come out great.  I use a sweet potatoe instead of a regular one, and use 1/2 and 1/2 instead of cream, and reduced the nutmeg down to about 1/2 a teaspoon.  I made it for my family on Thanksgiving and it got great reviews and was asked to bring it on Christmas as well.

Overall I liked the soup. However, there was just too much nutmeg.  My family didn't like it because of the sweet taste.  I thought that after a few bites the pepper stood out more...that's what I liked about it.

Roasting the vegetables makes all the difference. I couldn't find a sugar pumpkin, so I used calabaza, omitted the carrots and roasted 3 cloves of garlic. Instead of vegetable oil I used coconut oil and vegetable stock (because I really don't like using bouillon cubes). Omitted the nutmeg and used 1/2 tsp. Jamaican curry instead and half & half. Also added added a can of corn at the end, because my daughter loves it.  It turned out amazing!

Soooo good! I added about a tablespoon of brown sugar because I felt it needed an element of sweetness, and the whole family loved it! Will definitely make again.

Yummy. I followed others' suggestion and roasted some garlic with the other veggies, which was a delicious addition. The potato diluted the pumpkin flavor, so I will try just half a potato next time. Over all, though, a filling and satisfying fall dinner.

This another of my favorite recipes. My friends get really excited when I make it.

I drizzle olive oil and salt on the veggies before putting them in the oven. Also I don't use very much nutmeg, just enough for a little of the flavor to come through.

If served this, I would eat it again.  It could use more flavour.  My husband and I agree that it could use more salt, and we're not usually salt lovers.  There just isn't alot of flavour.

This soup recipe is amazing. I added garlic and cut back on the pepper and nutmeg as reviewers suggested, and it came out amazing. I followed the pumpkin preparation suggestions from Allrecipes' website  for how to roast a pumpkin in the oven and then to carve out the flesh once the pumpkin is soft. I didn't think the soup needed cream, but maybe some sour cream...it's awesome with some crusty bread, or better yet, in a sourdough bread bowl.

I think roasting the veggies added a ice flavor, though I would do a halved pumpkin next time also, peeling is a pain. I also had fresh herbs left from Thanksgiving, so I put roseary, thyme and sage in with the vegies when roasting, then pureed along with everything else. I forgot the nutmeg, but with other herbs, thought would be weird anyway. I pureed to chunky, added more broth, and to reduce fat only added about a half cup of fat free half and half. It turned out really great!

I love this recipe and make it at least once a week during the winter months. I also add sweet potato, but I roast it with the other veggies. My husband isn't wild about nutmeg, so I cut back on the amount in the soup and take the nutmeg and grater to the table with me. I'm pregnant at the moment and am turned off by most veggies, but I crave this soup all the time!

I thought it turned out great! Until I added the nutmeg. Definitely cut the amount in 1/2. Otherwise the first few bites are great and then all you can taste is nutmeg. The texture was fantastic and it felt fresh and healthy.

I'm not sure the pumpkins I got had a lot of flavor....which produced rather muted flavors in the final product.  Daughter and BFF both liked it.  I'll try this recipe again.....chalk this one up to not so great produce?  It happens!

Loved it! Nice thick soup,  roasting the veggies made such a difference and the carmalization on the onions.....lovely! I added cinnamon because I am addicted to this spice and used 1% milk. Other than that I followed all the directions and will make again for sure.

I roasted onions , butternut and sweet potatoes, till slightly burnt. Added 1 tsp mild curry powder, 1 tsp ground Cumin and 1 tsp Paprika to the stock . This resulted in a rich hearty, earthy soup with a bit of a 'bite' . Big chunks of fresh brown Artisnal bread and thick butter completed an unforgettable meal.

Underseasoned. After making as directed added additional pepper, a dash of ginger, and cinnamon. I wish the pumpkin was a lot more like pumpkin by increasing that and decreasing onions.

I added the following little by little after I created the original recipe. I tasted the soup every-time I added an extra ingredient, until it had a ton of delicious flavor.  It took a while because the original pumpkin soup recipe has no flavor. But after what I did IT IS SO GOOD!...added honey, apple cider vinegar, cayenne, paprika, pink salt, pepper, powdered garlic, powdered onion, 2 QT total of veggie broth, red wine (a must for flavor), puréed parsley, added a baked sweet potato, more nutmeg, cinnamon, lots of whole basil leaves as garnish, added half cup more of whipping cream (not necessary but I like the richness of the cream to offset the bland pumpkin), and I whipped some extra whipping cream and made it a garnish in the soup bowl (a dab of it in each bowl). Can also use plain yogurt. The soup needs garnishes that add intense flavor. I think I used way more pumpkin than what the recipe calls for. We cut up two larger sized sugar pumpkins aka pie pumpkins. Used a huge stock pot. We love it and will make this again!

Did this without the chicken bouillon (I'm on a low sodium diet and those are really high). Instead I added 4 cups of water with a garlic, onion and annato seasoning of only 140mg sodium. Also, added a low sodium blend spices. Added celery to the roasted veggies. The soup turns pretty creamy by itself so only added 1/2 cup of cream. As per other reviews I downsized the nutmeg, like 1/2 tsp. Really good.

This soup is amazing! My 3 year old niece asks for it every time she sees a pumpkin! I make the recipe as is, but sprinkle all spice, cayenne, garlic powder, and ginger powder...mostly because I believe in the more spice the better!

Based on other reviews, I used much less nutmeg, maybe only 3/4 teaspoon. I also substituted half and half instead of cream to make it a bit healthier.  The soup is delicious! Will definitely make it again.
One note of caution- keep a close eye on your onions. Some of mine burned just at the edges and while it didn't impact the flavor, some of those burned bits didn't blend as nicely. I would cut those off before blending next time should they burn again.

The soup turned out great.  I was skeptical as I was making it due to the amount of onions, nutmeg, and little water; however, once everything came together and in a bowl - it turns out to be my new go-to autumn dish. 

The prep time is longer than what the rcipe calls for.  5 minutes?  Nope. Actually it was more like 55 mins.  Pumpkins are not easy to peel and dice!!  
One thing I will do different next time is pulp the pumpkin and carrots together at the beginning of the recipe and roast them like that instead of pulping at the end of the recipe in the blender.  Once its hot, its harder to pour in a blender.  I was worried about spilling and scalding my hands.

To pep up the presentation, I served the soup in a pumpin shaped and colored bread bowl.  Then I added a gratable hard merlot cheese, the cream, and a bit of parsley on top.  Turned out perfect!  

Please note that I used a vegan (chicken-free) bouillon substitute for the whole recipe and I think it matched perfectly.  For the non vegans, we added the heavy whipping cream directly to their serving bowl only.  
I highly reccomend a gratable cheese to go on top.  The Merlot from Wisconsin was amazing with this!

All in all this is a good dish, but plan on about 1 hr. prep time,  1 hr. cook time., 5 mins presentation time. 

See my photo to get an idea.

Good stuff. I used a microwave (no oven) to cook up the veggies and it worked just fine. Thing is, the size of potatoes and carrots vary so you may get mixed results. Followed others advice and added garlic as well. My soup came out quite thick (which I dont like) so I thinned it out in the pot with milk after the blending operation. Also added some more salt and some Thai chili flakes to give it some zing. To each his own. :-)

This was a great success with everyone in the family! I increased the potato, carrots and pumpkin added some garlic (at my son's request)  and used a bouillon paste instead of the cubes, extra-virgin olive oil instead of vegetable oil.

Pumpkin had previously been baked so I left it out of the oven and added it to the vegetables when I pureed them.

Tastes good chilled as well!

This soup really hit the spot! Easy to make on a cold day, I didn't puree the veggies all the way to have a more hearty soup! I also used one sweet and one russet potato and added celery and garlic.

I made a pumpkin soup last year and it was fantastic but I couldn't find the recipe again! This recipe was very similar though! Instead of using heavy cream, I used 2% milk - which was fine, the soup was thick enough! I felt that it was a little bland so I also added garlic powder, a bit of brown sugar, and pumpkin pie spice! Yet again, it was a hit!

I had puréed sugar pumpkin that I wanted to use to make something new. . . I combined this recipe with Lea Ogawa's Pumpkin Soup recipe from this site. I sauted onion, garlic, grated carrots and grated potatoes in a butter/olive oil mixture for about 5 minutes. Added bouillon, pumpkin, fresh thyme and pepper. Simmered about 30 minutes. Used blender (about a cup at a time) til smooth. Returned to pot. Added a combination of half & half and 2% milk (eyeballed it). Heated through. It was delicious!

Loved this!!! - I did tweek it a little bit (I'm never able to cook any soups exactly like a recipe. I roasted one clove of garlic with the veggies (cause I love roasted garlic). Drizzled olive oil on the veggies cause its what we had. I used boxed chicken stock instead of water and bouillon. I used 2 cans of pumpkin instead of fresh (cause i'm lazy). I left out the potato. And I added a little Garam Masala seasoning. YUMMY!

It was delicious! The only changes I made were due to what I had on hand: 1 onion vs. 2 and 1/2 and 1/2 instead of cream. Definitely a keeper!

Don't know what I did wrong, but it turned out slightly crunchy (even after long minutes in the Cuisinart), and all I could taste was overpowering onion and nutmeg.  Never made pumpkin soup before, and I don't know if it's supposed to taste this way or not, but it's not my cup of tea.

I thought this soup tasted good. i also gave this to my boyfriend (who HATES pumpkin) and he liked it!! The only reason i give this 4 stars instead of 5 is that the recipe turned out WAAAY to peppery! 1 tsp of pepper?? That must be a typo. I ended up having to make another batch (w/o spices) to mix with the original one, to dilute the spiciness (and even then you can still taste the pepper pretty strongly). And yeah, i think the nutmeg amount is also a typo...i only put in half a teaspoon.

this was my first time making pumpkin soup. I guess my tastebuds just dont like pumpkin soup because i didn't want anymore after the first spoonful. I'm sure it would have been great for others though.
