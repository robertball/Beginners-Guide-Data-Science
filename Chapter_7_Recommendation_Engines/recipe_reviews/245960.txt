This is a really fast, affordable dinner.  The only thing I would do differently is after browning the ground beef (you could use ground turkey) would be to add a tablespoon of taco seasoning with about 1/4 cup of the water called for and cook that a bit while the Mexican Rice is cooking.   Corn would be a great addition to this.  If you don't want tacos, this would be great rolled up in a flour tortilla.

I had to add taco seasoning & garlic powder.  plus I used yellow rice instead and it was remarkably tasty. The family ripped thru every bit of it.

These were really good!  I made my own Mexican rice though as I am not a packaged food person.  I used Mexican Rice II recipe from Allrecipes to add to the beef mixture and it tasted fabulous! The family loved it as well, it was a nice change to the standard taco.  I used brown rice instead of the white rice that was called for as I think it adds more flavor and nutrients.

There used to be a recipe on the back of this Mexican rice which adds a can of drained black beans. You can add some salsa for a little more flavor or add a can of rotel. They all turn out great and it makes even more servings.

I added about 1 TBS taco seasoning to the meat after testing the mixture as did many other reviewers as it was a little bland on its own. I loved the flavor and how many vegetables are packed in there as well. I might try this again with a can of rotel tomatoes in place of the diced tomato and extra taco seasoning to see if that amps up the flavor enough and adds more tomato too. Very versatile mixture. We used in hard tacos, and my son wants a batch of nachos using this as well. It could be an easy all in one rice casserole as well, sprinkled with some cheese and some tortilla chips on the side!

After reading other reviews, I tasted the rice before adding meat. It was lacking flavor, so I added taco seasoning. I liked this recipe but didn't really taste like a traditional taco to me. I think the mixture would be better used as a side dish.

At first I was a little skeptical about rice in a taco but wow was I surprised. The rice really worked with this by adding another dimension of  flavors. The rice stretches your  meal without breaking your budget.

I used ground turkey like I always do and it lacked flavor, so I think a little tablespoon of taco seasoning would help.

This was a delicious dish that my kids & their friends all loved.  Like others, I decided to add a little taco seasoning to the chop meat while it was cooking along with a few of our favorite spices.  After adding the chop meat to the pepper & onion mixture, I threw in a can of southwest corn and it completed the meal.  I purchased ranch flavored hard taco shells & the kids just loved them!  I will definitely be making again!

After trying the recipe as originally prepared I decided to add in some taco seasoning to the mixture. I topped mine with homemade guacamole, sour cream, red onion, and cheddar cheese.

Made brown rice and added 1 tbsp taco seasoning from this website. Used coconut oil instead of butter. Yum yum!! Added another tbsp taco seasoning to meat. Served with Cheddar cheese, shredded lettuce, and tortilla chips.
