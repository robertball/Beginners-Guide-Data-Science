These cupcakes were absolutely delicious! I substitued canola oil for the vegetable oil.  For the glaze I used more than 1/2 a cup of strawberries and only about a cup of sugar. I usually don't make recipes from this site that have low ratings, but I am glad I made these.  Just a note - if you are using a regular cupcake pan, this recipe will make 18-24 cupcakes, not 12 like it states.  I filled my cupcakes up to the top and ended up with a major muffin top. These store well unglazed. I kept them covered on the counter for a few days, and felt they got better a day or two after they were baked.  I just kept the glaze in the fridge and used it as needed (which I also felt got better a day or two after it was made).  I will definitely make these again, and experiment with different fruit glazes for the topping.  Excellent - Five stars!!

I had some mascarpone left over from another recipie so I gave this recipe a try.  The mascarpone really really maked a big difference - Delicious!

These cupcakes were disappointing. I made the cupcake part exactly as the recipe stated. They were fairly moist, but I thought they would be even more moist. They tasted like a normal cupcake to me. I don't know if I over-mixed or what. I prefer the ricotta cake recipe on this site, which also uses a box mix.

I thought the cupcake portion of this recipe was delicious.  I wasn't impressed with the appearance of the strawberry mixture for the top of the cake.  I WOULD make the base again, but would consider other types of icings/frosting.

These are honestly one of the best cupcakes I have ever had! I never review recipes, but this was so good I had to. They are very moist and at first almost reminded me of an angel food cake type texture. The glaze is runny and a bit messy, but that's what glazes are supposed to do. I chilled my glaze while the cupcakes cooled in order to make it a little bit easier to work with. I also added a little strawberry slice to the top of each cupcake for a little decoration. Give these a try! They are wonderful!

Wasn't sure about these at first..they are sooo moist they almost taste how should I say? Un-done, raw?? But they browned lightly and passed the toothpick test, and look cooked in the middle.  Nice crumb.  Literally melt in your mouth.  Hubby liked them.  They are better the next day.  I have not iced them yet...not sure what would be best on top. They almost don't need anything on top. Powdered sugar? Just a fresh berry?  Not sure.  Would make these again.

Followed directions and mixed by hand with wooden spoon until well combined.  Did not over mix.  Filled muffin cups about 3/4 full.  They do puff up but go down while cooling.  I got about 16 cupcakes.  I filled 1 cup measuring cup to the top with frozen strawberries because they settle once thawed.  I only used 1 and 1/2 cups of conf. sugar.  This was sweet enough for us.  I spooned 2 to 3 spoons of the puree over each cupcake.  The cupcakes were plenty moist and light.  We enjoyed very much and will definitely make again.

Could not believe how well they turned out.   Prefer a raspberry sauce on top with a little whipped cream.   Really does not need too much dressing up because they stand on their own.

These cupcakes were INCREDIBLE! They were so moist and flavorful; the mascarpone really makes a creamy cupcake. The only reason I didn't give it five stars was because of the glaze. The flavor of it was nice, don't get me wrong. But it just made the cupcakes look kinda sloppy. A nice idea in theory, but didn't execute well. I will DEFINTELY be using this cupcake recipe again, perhaps with a strawberry frosting. A chocolate hazelnut frosting would also pair nicely with this cupcake.

These were great! I didn’t like the original topping so I changed it up a little by adding cream cheese, but you could definitely put whatever on it and it still taste good. The cake part was perfect.

The cupcakes fell but were delicious.  The icing was not good. I won’t make again.

Put more strawberries inside than the recipe says to make the glaze less “glaze-y” and more runny for a nice effect.

These were good. Had to bake my cupcakes 5 min longer than stated. The glaze was really messy. I had to put another liner on the cupcakes to catch the drips.  I hollowed out the cupcakes and piped strawberry prepared icing into the centers and a bit on top.  These were good. Not amazing BUT GOOD.

These are VERY moist and delicious. Very easy to make. I made a raspberry and blueberry purée, very tasty.

i really liked this recipe, and my coworkers did as well.  i was looking for something "pink" for a baby shower.   i also added about 3 tablespoons of pureed strawberries in syrup to the batter.  the cupcakes were somewhat dense, they rose, then fell, but were definitely moist.  i did bake them for 30 minutes, instead of 20, because i wasn't sure if they were done.  the extra cooking time did not negatively affect the outcome.
