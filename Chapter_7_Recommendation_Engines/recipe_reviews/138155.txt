This recipe does not appear as I wrote it not even close (I have asked for it fixed but got no response)so I will add the proper changes here.

      2 pounds ground beef 
     1 pound ground pork
     1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley
     4 garlic cloves minced
     1 medium yellow onion, peeled and grated
     1 teaspoon salt
     2 teaspoons Vegeta Seasoning NOT seasoned salt (Vegata is sold worldwide, it's a mixture of spices and various vegetables)if you leave it out add 2 teaspoon of salt instead of the 1
     2 teaspoons black pepper
     1 teaspoon hot paprika (optional)
     2 tablespoon sweet paprika 
     1 teaspoon baking soda
     1 pinch freshly grated nutmeg 
     1 egg white
     1/2 cup red wine
     olive oil for brushing

you could also exchange 1 pound of beef for veal or lamb if you wish.

what I like to do before I grill these up is to cook a small rolled thumb size piece in a small pan to check for seasoning

We prefer Cevaps made with lamp/beef/pork and always Vegeta and soda water which makes them moister and helps them brown.  We make them Serbian style and serve with Lapinja bread.

This was pretty tasty. I only used 1 pound of each of the meats, and kept the flavouring amounts the same, and it turned out quite well. I do recommend you keep your grill on low and the cover closed for the first little while when you're cooking these, and don't try moving them too much to begin with, or they'll fall apart. I served these with Tzatziki sauce, a greek salad and fresh warm baguette. A very yummy dinner. Thanks!

My family loved this!  I used the revised version from TiKiWaHiNe's comment.  I suggest you re-submit the recipe for it is scrummy.  I had to use cayenne instead of hot paprika which worked out fine.  We warmed up some Pita bread, chopped up some lettuce and tomatoes, and topped it off with Tzatziki.  Thanks for the great recipe!  My family adore me. Tra-La

With the revisions in the recipe submitter's review, this was great.  We served it with greek potatoes and tzatziki sauce (kids chose ketchup).  They are a little mushy going on the grill and easy to fall apart, but flavor is excellent. I may grill as patties next time, or pan fry.  This recipe makes a lot, so I froze some uncooked for another day--should be an easy dinner.

I also used the update from the comment section and absolutely love it! 
I agree that the update needs to be done, a person may not get to taste this great dish to it's fullest w/o the correct ingredients. 
Thanks for the recipe!

I used elk burger in place of the beef and cut back on the hot paprika by half. I will definitely be trying the revised recipe as TiKiWaHiNe suggests. Need to find some Vegeta!

I made this exactly as written  including the optional paprika and nutmeg since you can't do an honest review of a recipe if you make changes to it. I had hoped this would turn out better than it did but despite using lean meat it turned out to be a very bland and greasy disappointment. I mat try to salvage it by letting it simmer in marinara sauce but I'm not holding out much hope.

I made as written without reading the previous reviews. I left out the optional nutmeg. I liked these. They did get a little dry but over all I have no complaints.
