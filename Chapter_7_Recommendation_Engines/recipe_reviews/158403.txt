These are great! I was so excited to find a good sugar-free recipe for cookies. I added 3/4 cup of oatmeal, and a teaspoon of vanilla. I am making this for the 3rd time this weekend. Thank you!

These cookies are truley a gift from heaven for those who have diabetes or are watching their sugar intake! I love to bake for my family, but unfortunately my mother has diabetes, so i am always in search of sugar-free recipes that taste like "the real thing". This cookie is crumbly/crunchy on the ends, but soft and chewy in the center...the best of both worlds! Even better, the cookies are virtually carb-free as well....which is a plus for diabetics! Thakyou so much!!!

Great cookies for sugar-free! I found that they were the best consistency a few hours after baking, and into the next day. When warm, they crumbled, but after cooling through they were great! I added vanilla and will use half white/half brown sugar Splenda next time. Thanks for a great base recipe for sugar-free cookies, I will play around with this to perfect it to my tastes! NOTE: I made again with Simply Jif and they turned out fabulous! I've found that I need to bake them 2-5 minutes longer than the 8 min the recipe calls for...

I am not sure what some reviewers were expecting from a flourless, sugar-free cookie recipe. Of course they are not going to be of the same texture and taste of a traditional peanut butter cookie, however, given the parameters, I found these cookies to be an exceptionally delicious and satisfying alternative for those who must or choose to limit their consumption of simple carbohydrates. My tips: Start out with less Splenda for your first attempt and adjust to taste with subsequent batches. (I used only 1/2 C. as I prefer subtle sweetness. 2 C. would have been far too much for my taste.) Add 1 t. of vanilla. Roll dough into approximately 1 inch balls (bite-sized) and flatten with the tines of a fork in a crisscross pattern as with traditional PB cookies. (I believe that this step helped to avoid the crumbling issue that others have cited.) I cooked mine for 10 minutes, though ALL OVENS VARY so watch for signs that your cookies are dry and set in the center. Cool on pan for about 1 minute before attempting to GENTLY transfer with a spatula to a wire rack to cool further (at least half an hour or more). I used Smucker's natural, creamy peanut butter. As an aside, I always use air-filled baking sheets as, in my experience, they virtually eliminate the problem of overcooked bottoms on cookies.

Great recipe!  My family LOVES it, but mind you, they are used to splenda, when I first tried them, I was sure no one would like them. On the contrary.  I make them weekly now, I only bake 1/2 a batch at a time and add 1 tsp of vanilla to it, I've never tried it without.  Good with crunchy Peanut butter as well. Edit to review; I've since tried with low fat p-nut butter & like them, but hubbie didn't enjoy as much, says they didn't 'melt in his mouth'.

When they first came out of the oven my initial reaction was not good - the flavor seemed off, and they were very crumbly and messy.  However after they cooled completely everything seemed to work better.  Very good.

It's great to find a cookie without flour.  I added a teaspon of vanilla to this.  Cookies are very soft, quick, and good.

I've been making these for years. I enjoy using this as a base recipe to which I make small changes.  Try adding a teaspoon of extract, whether vanilla, almond, or another flavor. Also, sometimes I add a touch of cocoa powder which really intensifies the peanut butter flavor. Try putting a thumbprint in the top of the cookies before baking... then before serving, put a tiny bit of sugar free jam on top.

For a sugarless cookie, these aren't bad! I used Stevia (granular kind) instead of Sucralose and only made 1/2 batch. I used only 1/2 cof Stevia, and followed other reviewers' recommendation by adding 1 tsp vanilla, a 1/2c of quick oats, and 2 tsp of cocoa.

I just made these and they are terrific. I used 1 cup of crunchy and 1 cup of creamy all natural/organic p'butter. Since Sucralose is really bad for you, I used 1 cup of natural Stevia instead. I also added the recommended 1 tsp of vanilla,  1/2 cup of natural oatmeal and cooked for 10 minutes. To avoid the dryness, I added 2 tbs of milk to the recipe. After 5 minutes of cooling on the cookie sheet and 15 minutes on the cooling rack, they were good to go - no crumbling. I definitely miss the brown sugar, so I think I will add a bit of cinnamon or other sugar free flavor next time.

I loved this recipe!  I have diabetic family members, and this was great for all.  It's even a great diet recipe for those keeping trim.  It's a wonderful substitute.

Not sure if it was my fault, but with a three-ingredient recipe, this should be dummy-proof.  The cookies simply disintegrated.  It looked like sand on my cookie sheet.

These cookies are fantastic-even for a sugar-free cookie. I used stevia and they turned out great. I used a heaping tablespoon for each of my cookies and baked them for 13 minutes-they didn't seem done at all when I pulled them out of the oven but once they set out for a couple of hours they were perfect.

I made these exactly according to the recipe and think they are great for a sugar-free cookie.  My husband is diabetic and these provide a sweet treat! I liked them well enough I had a few myself! *Update...I had to give another star...my second batch I used Splenda brown sugar and added Maple extract(1tsp)... Absolutely Yummy!!!

I used reduced fat, crunchy peanut butter and egg whites instead of whole eggs. I actually used a little more egg whites than called for and they came out nice and light and almost fluffy. I thought they were great! You do have to let them cool completely to get the right consitancy. I would love to try this recipe with a lower fat/calorie peanut butter substitute.

These were awesome. I added a few things to the basic recipe myself. I used natural crunchy peanut butter. I added 1 teas vanilla, 1/3 cup of oats, 1/3 cup of cocoa and then I used 1/3 cup of agave nectar to replace 1/3 cup of the splenda. I also added some cut up sugar free candies (Russel Stover's with chocolate, pecans and caramel).   Adding the cocoa I believe helped the crumbling issue as did letting them cool first. Mine turned out with a nice texture and they tasted great!   My husband is also diabetic and he loved them. They were also a hit with our non-diabetic friends who normally use sugar.

I've made these multiple times and here's what I've found out.  The sugar substitute mellows after a day or two.  I mix Splenda, Nutri Sweet and Sweet-n-low, instead of using just one type of sweetener. (An old Atkins trick to cut down on the after taste.) The last time I made these, I added about 4 heaping tablespoons of unsweetened apple sauce, and instead of rolling them, made them into drop cookies.  I also cooked them longer - 12 minutes.  (because of the apple sauce, they will leach water during the baking process, so be prepared with a paper towel) Store them in a cookie jar so that they don't lose their crunchy chewy outer texture.  This was the best batch so far.

Loved it!  I hate artificial sweeteners but you really can not taste it in these cookies once cooked.  Sidenote:  I did use 1 1/2 cups of splenda though and not 2 cups.  I also added 2tsp of vanilla extract.  These will satisfy my sweet cravings as I'm on a strict no sugar diet.

These were amazing! I was on the south beach diet and thought i wouldn't be able to have a sweet treat for a long time, but then I tried this! The only thing I would change is the amount of Splenda. I used 3/4 cup but that was still too much. Maybe try 1/2 cup? and I made them very small, like tea cookies because of how crumbly they were. Give this recipe a try, it will be worth your time!

I tried this recipe and love it.  However I added a tsp of vanilla and 1/4 cup of oatmeal.  I used dry splenda sweetener which caused the cookies to ooze on the parchment paper in the oven but didn't change the outcome.  I added 5 minutes to the bake time.  I also added a few Tblsp of water as I mixed it. It was stiff, really stiff but after the few spoons of water it mixed really well.  Let them cool completely before eating or storing. I read where these crumbled easy.  Well to cure that store them on a paper towel in the container and they will stay soft till gone. They remind me of no bake cookies without the sugar.  
Lets see, no sugar and low carbs. Yup I will fix these again.

I did not expect much from a recipe without flour and real sugar.  This recipe still did not live up to my already low expectations.  I formed the dough into balls and pressed the tops with a fork.  This helped them stay together, but they were still very very fragile.  But the taste... It was like eating a dried up glob of peanut butter and Splenda... very dry and hard to swallow.  I will not make these again.

I almost made the mistake of assuming my 16oz jar of Peanut Butter was 2 cups (when I measured I found it was about 1/4 cup short and a little Jiff to the natural Peanut butter that I started with.   I wanted to make 24 cookies,  So I patted all the dough on Parchment paper and made it into a rectangle,  and then cut it into 24 squares (like prep made cookie dough)  I was able to then roll the cookies by hand and make marks in them with the tins of a fork.   They looked great,  however I wasn't wild about the taste - somewhat Dry in the mouth.

I love these cookies!! I am not diabetic, but am a bariatric patient, and in being so I cannot eat sugar and carbs. Made these for the first time using natural peanut butter and truvia sugar (which is the best artificial sugar ever) added the egg, popped it in the oven and omg ! heaven! I would never try it with splenda however because the taste  isnt as good as truvia. The texture wasnt so bad either, a little crumbles on my plate but not anything major.. devoured three cookies in 3 minutes..yummm!

My husband hated them and then loved them. Turns out these cookies aren't tasty until the next day when all of the ingredients settle. This cookie is good for people who follow the Atkins diet but don't like the Atkins branded desserts. These cookies won't leave you gassy.

These got my husband and I through our stretch on the low carb diet!  Seriously.  The texture is different from a regular peanut butter cookie, but I rather enjoyed the heightened peanut butter flavor and the airy texture.  My husband ate 6-8 right off the pan from the first batch. I'm planning on giving this recipe to my newly diagnosed diabetic mother.  Thanks!

They didn't hold together well enough for us, and were very dry in the mouth.

YUM!  I cut the recipe in half & used reduced fat chunky peanut butter.  My only addition was a  splash of pure vanilla.  It is great to be able to have a treat and not completely "break the rules"!

These were ok... they were very crumbly, but they tasted alright. The texture just isn't quite right for a cookie. But I suppose if your choices are this or no cookie, this is better than nothing! If anyone has found a way to make the texture a little better, please share!

i am still for the old fashioned peanut butter sugar recipe but i will say it melts in you mouth it healthier and less calories and it's good for people who are diabetic so i make it for diet reasons it's so easy too make and my only problem with this it just falls to pieces so i make it small enough to just pop in you mouth.

I made these a while ago using another recipe that had vanilla in it, and also had the crumbly problem but thought they tasted good and would make a better filling, say, for thumbprint cookies or a layer on top of brownies.        Yesterday, I tried to come up with a sweet treat for a diabetic.  Using "peanut butter cookie bites" recipe from Splenda's site, I tamped down about 1 TBS of it into Pam-sprayed mini-muffin tins as a crust, then put a about a tsp or so blob of this recipe (pb + splenda + egg and a little vanilla) into the crust, then made an indent and filled it with a dab of sugar free Smucker's apricot jam.  Baked at 350 for 10 - 15 min.  Carefully twisted the "peanut butter jelly cups" in pan while still hot/warm to loosen using a fork and fingers, then placed a cooling rack on top of the pan, then inverted the whole thing to get them out of the pan without too much handling.  Then simply turned them right-side up to finish cooling on the rack.  For low sugar, they're pretty good.  Cute too. There is a bit of that Splenda after taste, but I guess that can't be helped.    Don't put too much jam in them as it can run to the sides and make them stick to the pan.

These are simply amazing! I've had Gastric bypass and have always had a bit of a sweet tooth and these hit the spot without me worrying if I'm going to end up in pain. They're warm and a bit gooey when warm, but once they cool they'll be amazing! I'm thinking of rolling in some rolled oats and some vanilla next time around! Can't wait to make these for my mini-me!

Sugar free recipes with a good texture are hard to find. These are wonderful. I used only 2/3 cup Pure Via. I put the jar of pb in the microwave for 30 seconds to soften it a bit. I used lower fat pb, and it tastes great. I also added the tsp. vanilla and a shake of nutmeg. I baked them for 10 min.

Good recipe!  I did the 1/2 splenda and 1/2 brown sugar suggestion that I saw from another review and added an extra dash of vanilla extract.  If you are not AS worried about the sugar intake they are extra tasty with some chocolate chips thrown in.

I love to bake and cook, and was recently diagnosed with gestational diabetes. I tried this receipt, I added less splenda than the recipe called for and added some oats, vanilla and more peanut butter. I was so unhappy with the results, the cookies still tasted like eating splenda rolled in peanut butter. I would not recommened this recipet to anyone unless you like to eat splenda from the packets…

These cookies were good. I used 1 cup splenda and 1 cup splenda brown sugar blend and added some vanilla extract. They are very crumbly when hot! Let completely cool before messing with them to much. Overall pretty good

This is a great option - even if you don't need to avoid the sugar...these are great cookies for everyone.  Why add the calories if you don't have to?  I have just a few suggestions - make the cookies very small like tea cookies or wedding cookies.  The smaller they are, the less likely they are to fall apart.  And, I always sprinkle a little splenda on the top before baking.  These are a wonderful, healthy treat.

great recipie! My husband was just recently diagnosed with diabetes and has had a hard time giving up sweets. yes the cookies are a little crumbly...but i let mine cool about 15 minutes and they were great. I have no trouble with the "splenda taste", nor does anyone in the family. I did add the vanilla as suggested.

These cookies are great if you are diabetic or dieting.  I used egg substitute in place of the eggs.  The cookies came out soft and delicious.  There are several reviews saying they are crumbly.  I did not have that problem.  We love these cookies.  Maybe the egg substitute made the difference.  Try it for yourself.

WOW!  These are really really good - I followed another cooks idea and added the 3/4 cup of instant oatmeal and 1 t vanilla.  I've already had one that was warm (gooey) so I'm going to try to wait for them to firm up....

These were so dry and thick and felt as if I was choking while trying to swallow them.  I made them small, but maybe not small enough.  I love peanut butter so much but it was just like eating it on a spoon.  Which is not bad if you want to eat peanut butter on a spoon, but I was hoping for a cookie.  I think I might try this as the crust for a sugar free cheesecake, as I have plenty of recipes for that but don't want to use graham crackers since they  have sugar in them.  I've tried making a pecan crust before, but I think this cookie dough would make an even better cheesecake crust.  Going to try that this weekend!

I also made these for my 84 year old father who had recently been diagnosed with diabetes. I read the reviews and, knowing oatmeal helps maintain glucose levels and can be beneficial to diabetics, added 3/4 cup of dry oatmeal.  I substituted 1 cup Splenda BROWN sugar for 1 cup of the Splenda white sugar. Fearing the oatmeal might make the cookies too dry, I used extra large/jumbo eggs and I added 1/2 tsp vanilla simply for flavor. Not only did my dad love these cookies, my mom, my whole family, including grandchildren LOVED these cookies.  This recipe, with my changes, made 32-36 silver dollar size cookies. The natural peanut butter isn't cheap and we limit sugar substitutes for our kids, so in our family, this is pretty much an adult cookie and the kids get real cookies.

These cookies are delicious! I tried all the things that people said to try in their other reviews. I added a third a cup of oats, a teaspoon of vanilla, a splash of milk, and a tablespoon of cocoa. The Coco Gave great flavor and made the cookie slightly darker. The one thing I didn't do is add less Splenda. The cookies were a little crumbly, but not much. By adding only one and a half cups of Splenda would've helped with this. What also helped with the crumbliness is making the cookie smaller. My cookies a tablespoon in size. All in all this was an amazing recipe that tastes amazing too. All you have to do is tweak it slightly.

I have made these cookies many many times ... they are wonderful! Now ... the folks that have had problems with them falling apart ... LET THEM COOL COMPLETLY ... they will firm up. I also add flaxseed ... about 2 tbsp. And if you are still having problems with them firming up ... add an extra egg white. At Christmas time I push a dark chocolate kiss in the middle ... the dark chocolate still keeps them low carb

I made these for a diabetic friend who takes holiday meals with our group. I knew he wouldn't be able to eat the ice cream cake that the rest of us had. I was truly blown away by these. I thought they were even better than regular peanut butter cookies. I may bake them a minute or two longer next time, to dry out the peanut butter in the center -- or maybe not. But they really are delicious.

I just made these and they are crumbly even when they are cool off. I will try again later just in case I screwed up. They do have a good taste.

Awesome, simple cookies! We aren't on a sugar free diet-just gluten an dairy free- so we used reg sugar instead of Splenda. We also added the tsp of vanilla which adds a lot of flavor and some of the liquid you need to get the batter smooth. It's true that they are a little soft and don't stay together as well as traditional cookies but the taste and ease of baking well makes up for that!

I made these for my grandmother. I didn't have enough splenda so I did use sugar, however they still turned out amazing. Great for those who don't eat gluten and she didn't even notice there was no flour in them! I guess I make smaller cookies because I got well over 24. Next time I'll have to prepare ahead of time and make them sugar free. Remember to let the cookies sit for a few minutes when you take them out of the oven and they won't be crumbly.

This recipe was quite good but not the traditional peanut butter cookie. My husband is diabetic so obviously he is used to the taste of artificial sweeteners and I'm not! They were a little bit crumbly but after all they are flour-free, baking powder-free cookies and the only thing binding them together are the eggs. I did modify it a bit. I added vanilla because I just can't make cookies without vanilla! Also, when forming your cookies it's best to measure out tablespoonfuls and roll them into balls, I found that this makes the cookie less crumbly.

The flavor is good, but the mouth-feel is unappealing. I put them with sugar free ice cream and it helped, but the diabetic in the family did not take them home.

I gave this 5 stars simply because its the easiest thing I have ever made and I was able to make it on the fly for my Diabetic mother for her dessert.  Flavor was pretty good I enjoyed them myself and I am a sugar addict.

You won't find an easier recipe that's for sure!  I just made these for the first time for my recently diagnosed pre-diabetic son and he likes them.  I've never used Splenda before, so that was a little different, but it definately works for someone with a chronic sweet tooth who can't have sugar...I will be saving this recipe and making it again...thanks!

I've never made anything remotely like these before, but I wanted to add something diabetic friendly to my christmas cookie trays.  I really like them.  I took the advice of others and a) cut down on the splenda, b) added some instant oatmeal, and c) let them cool fully before attempting to do anything with them.

They are SO yummy and really do melt in your mouth.

This was a great recipe I used to make with real brown sugar...switched out the sugar with the splenda and I love it.  It is not as good as it is with the real sugar but it is perfect for keeping my BGL perfect...when it is higher - it even brings it down NOW! love it! It is the perfect little cookie...

Very nice recipe.  A little dry, but that was to be expected with the ingredients.  Perfect with a milk chaser.  Made even better with 1/2 tsp. sugar free jam (I used raspberry) in the center.

This recipe was so easy and good!  I used reduced fat Jif peanutbutter and softened/melted it in the microwave.  I also added a tsp. vanilla flavor as suggested by others.  I cooked for more like 10 minutes and then let the pan cool before I tried to remove the cookies.  The recipe made exactly 24 cookies just as stated.  They were so good and even better the next day and the day after that.

I did not care for this recipe. I made a couple batches trying the vanilla and than trying the oatmeal and no matter what I did to these, it didn't help. PLUS the taste that lingers in your mouth LONG after the cookie has been thrown away. Milk doesn't even help. My suggestion to those that are looking for a Sugar-free recipe is to keep looking.

I agree with some others.. cooking time was longer in my oven.  I tried just 1/2 a recipe, to see if my diabetic bf would like them.  looks like I'll be making the full recipe next time.  I'm not a diabetic, and have a HUGE dislike of artificial sweetners.. I gotta say that these are actually OK!  I ate more than one, and couldn't tell they were sugar-free at all.

Tip: if you buy PB in the 16 oz. jar, there's no need to measure.  Note: These are a God-send for folks who are on no/lo-carb and -sugar diets. Some reviewers noted that the Splenda taste is prominent, and I'll admit that it is. I think next time I'm going to try a bit of vanilla to help. But when you can't eat white flour and your options for snacks and treats are limited, these taste pretty good with Cool Whip Free or a glass of milk!

I would give these 3 1/2 stars if it were an option. They weren't terrible but they weren't great.  The cookies came out with a consistency like compacted wet sand so they are definitely crumbly, but that didn't bother me. They tasted a bit dry and a little bland but it was my first attempt at sugar-free (started doing Atkins a few weeks ago)and I can see where a recipe like this would come in handy. Especially for diabetics or people who need to "trick" their brains into thinking they're getting a real cookie.   Some of the reviews made me skeptical so I added the teaspoon of Vanilla and then halved the Splenda. I had never cooked with Splenda before but the cookies seemed plenty sweet so I doubt that was the problem.   So like I said, not bad but also not good. It hasn't stopped me from eating them but I'll probably go back to my berries and whipped cream desserts.

The recipe is great! But, I agree with another poster who added vanilla. In addition, I cut the splenda blend in half. One cup is more than enough. I was a liitle hesitant about the amount of igredients or lack of but, I was pleasantly surprised. My Husband had gastric bypass surgery last year and these are well tolerated.

I was disappointed that this didn't measure up compared to sugar-filled peanut butter cookies. Wasn't too bad compared to a lot of sugar-free recipes and was easy to throw together real fast. It definitely helps to let them sit for quite awhile to harden, I would suggest for about an hour. 

I want to try these again, but make a few adjustments. I think brown sugar would help a ton wit hthe durability of this cookie, but would ruin the "sugar-free" name. If anybody finds a good way to adjust these without adding sugar, let me know!

These are easy to make and taste good.  I cut back the Splenda by 1/2 as I think Splenda makes everything way too sweet tasting.  I added a tsp of vanilla.  They are very delicate cookies.  Let them cool before you take them off the cookie sheet.

My brother is diabetic and can't have sugar and he avoids flour; so this was awesome that I could make him his favorite cookie with no sugar or flour! They taste great too!

I was just diagnoised with gestational diabetes. i decided to try this recipe. i really love it. i only made a few changes. i used organic all natural peanut butter, 1/4 tsp baking soda, and 1 tsp vanilla. i baked them for 9 minutes. they definitely need an hour to sit and cool completly. mine came out very moist and tender. i am looking forward to bringing them to thanksgiving this weekend. thank you for the great recipe:-)

I made these cookies to try a recipe with splenda for the first time.  These were crumbly, but they were better the second day.  I couldn't stay away!

Just 3 ingredients? You can't get any easier than that! I was skeptical of this recipe at first but I was surprised when I ended up with cute little cookies that tasted great! I made them into balls first time round but they didn't seem to cook through to the centre so I found it best to flatten with a fork for a more even result. My husband loved them and couldn't believe they were made with Splenda. I made them with 1 cup of store bought smooth PB and 1 cup of my own homemade crunchy styIe PB. Next time I'll just use my own. Thanks for a surprising recipe.

These were pretty good. I used 1.5 cups of splenda and they were still sweet enough. I am thinking that maybe use even less splenda and add a bit of sugar free jam (in a thumb print)and bake them. 
But it was nice to have a flourless, sugarless peanut butter cookie!Thanks

Perfect for diabetics who have to watch sugar intake.  My dad who is real picky about his cookies gave these a good review before I told him they were sugar free -- that says a lot!

Utterly disappointing.  My husband is a diabetic so I thought this cookie would be a win.  The cookies were crumbly to the point of sand and tasted awful.  The texture was all wrong too.  I am so upset that I wasted great ingredients on this.

Maybe it was the fact I used crunchy pb, because that is what my hubby loves, but my cookies crumbled very easily and were extremely rich. However, they were very tasty and satisfied the sweet cravings.

If you have a person who's watching there sugar intake then these are perfect. My pallet still needs sugar so I personally will make them but only for those who need them. Extremely simple.

So happy to have found this recipe! I also added 1 tsp of vanilla as recommended and 1 tblsp cocoa powder. I think next time (and there will be next time!) I’ll use 1c stevia and 1c Splenda brown sugar with 1/4c cocoa powder. So good.

Shockingly sweet. Crumbles at the slightest touch. Going to chill and cover with dark stevia sweetened chocolate and see if that will help hold it together and counter the sweetness. It yielded 57 cookies when using a tablespoon of batter per cookie. The cost with chocolate will be about $0.50 per cookie.

We used sugar free peanut butter and did not add the sweetener so it was pretty bland but still a great alternative
for people who want to give up sugar but not peanut butter cookies.

Made exactly according to the recipe, and the "cookies" didn't come close to surviving the baking process. They simply fell apart into a greasy mess. Tried adding a cup of flour to the remaining "dough" just to salvage something, and that was no more successful. Do NOT recommend this recipe.

Some people who had problems with them probably used a processed type of peanut butter, try using all natural peanut butter ( I used Smucker's all natural) probably any all natural  peanut butter will produce a good outcome. They will not settle during cooking so you should press with a fork before cooking.  They also didn't  stick together as a traditional cook would, they are delicate.  Mine remained moist  and fresh until gone. They are  a great replacement cookie  for diabetics , its better than going without.

Cookies came out very good for using artificial sweetener. Mine were a little dry, but I think that was probably because I used natural peanut butter. I would recommend, as other reviewers have, to add 1 tsp of vanilla extract.

I used 1 cup of sugar in the raw instead 2 cups of a substitute and I threw it in with 1 cup of maple and brown sugar oatmeal. The only adaptation I used but I probably needed more peanut butter it didn't bind well but it doesn't matter they taste awesome I didn't exactly wait long to take them off the rack so who knows but they're awesome. Thanks for sharing your recipe

These were great! super quick and easy. I have made them once before and this time I decided to try it with actual sugar. Also came out great. My only thing is that I am at such a high altitude that I had to cook them for 16 minutes instead.

I made these and put half a sugar free Reese's on cup in the middle.  They do tend to be a bit crumbly and will fall apart if moved too soon to the cooling rack,

Sucralose?? I stopped reading at this point. You might as well just use sugar instead of cancer inducing sucralose. Next time please think before posting rubbish like this.

Oh, and I tried your recipe with normal sugar and it sucked!

I am on prednisone so I have to watch my sugar intake for 90 days.  I googled sugar free cookie recipes and this came up.  I read through several reviews before making these cookies.  Here's what I came up with:

I used crunchy peanut butter.  It added a nice taste and texture to this recipe.  I only made a half batch since I wasn't sure if I'd like them or not. 

I added 1/2 cup of oats
1/2 tsp of vanilla extract
20 packets of splenda (it was sweet and good but next time I'll only do 15 packets).  I use packets so I can tweak until I find a nice level of sweetness that I like.  

I put a tablespoon amount in my hand and squeezed the dough until they were tight (they were sort of falling apart so I squeezed them to make sure there were no cracks in the dough.  I think this helped with the crumbling others spoke about when making these cookies).  I  rolled into balls and put them on parchment paper.  I used a fork to spread them out and do the criss-cross pattern.  I baked them for 8 minutes and let them sit while I did my homework.  I came back later and they were fine.  They didn't crumble and fall apart like others said in their reviews.  They were a little dry, but not too bad.  They were still good and this is coming from someone who usually cooks with sugar.  

I hope this helps!

I used 1 cup of stevia and 2 cups of Jif extra crunchy and a dash of vanilla with 2 eggs.  Baked for 10 mins at 350 as a drop cookie mashed down with a fork.  Let them cool and they are really great.  Adding Oatmeal will add carbs so I didn't do it.  They are crumbly but better by far than NO cookie!

I have food sensitivities so these gluten free peanut butter cookies are a fabulous option for me! I also  have food sensitivities to eggs, dairy, and sugar cane. As such I had to make a few adjustments to these. I used a Vegan egg replacer that I found at my local grocery store. I used Earth Balance creamy peanut butter because it is sweetened with Agave instead of sugar cane or sugar cane derived products (i.e. molasses). The last thing I added was some vanilla extract and about 1/4 cup of unsweetened maple peanut butter just to add a bit of a different flavor and because the Earth Balance was extremely thick vs the maple which was more oily and helped to incorporate all of the ingredients more evenly. These cookies came out AMAZING! I am not someone that just says something is amazing, as a former culinary arts connoisseur and someone very new to all of these food sensitivity issues, I need my food to have a lot of robust and vibrant flavors. These cookies are a life saver for me because they help curb my sweet cravings when I am unable to have much else.

I made these cookies adding the 3/4 cup oatmeal and 1 tsp vanilla and reducing sweetener (I used Truvia) to 1/2 cup, as suggested by another reviewer.  I also used chunky peanut butter.  These cookies are awesome.  I stopped eating sugar about a year ago.  It is so nice to have cookies that are both delicious and healthy.  You do have to cool the cookies completely before eating, otherwise they will crumble in your hand.  Even after they cool completely, they are still a bit more crumbly than traditional cookies.  Best to eat them over a plate or napkin.

I cannot find one redeeming quality. I checked them at 8 minutes to see if they were done and found that the cookies were still round balls on the cookie sheet - they hadn't flattened into cookies at all. I tried to use a fork to flatten a few, and they fell apart - didn't hold together at all - literally just turned to crumbles right on the cookie sheet.  I let what  remained cool completely (based on the reviews I read), and they also fell apart; although, fall apart doesn't really describe what happened. Disintegrated is more like it. The small amount I was able to get into my mouth was not tasty at all and was very gritty. Very disappointed. :-(

I used Trivia sweetener. I find it to taste most like the real thing.  I am also a Diabetic so whenever a recipe calls for ap flour like maybe 2 cups, I'll put 11/2 cup Whole Wheat flour and 1/2 cup ap flour, this reduces the carbs from the ap flour.

I made these but did not use sucralose. Instead I made with 1/2 sugar and put a Hershey kiss in the middle after 9 min of baking - then returned for 3 min. more. Wanted something to give my daughter who doesn't do well with flour.

I used almond butter instead of peanut butter due to a diet I'm on. I used Stevia and also added vanilla.  
I was skeptical,  so I halfed the recipe. They taste much better than expected....i was pleasantly surprised!

Cookies were delicious; but so fragile that they could not be stored. In hindsight, I wonder what brand of natural peanut butter was used for the development of this recipe; because they vary alot in consistency and ingredients. 

Also, for those who found the recipe too sweet, many peanut butters labeled "natural" still have extra sugar in them, just no additives; so that will affect the taste quite a bit.

For diabetics, a sugarless recipe with flour and levening in it would be much better; but my interest was for an Atkins, or low-carb, version.

These came out better than I expected. I also just did 1/2 of the recipe and I added the vanilla (1/2t) as another member did. Then I also added 3T of peanut flour (you could use PB2, same thing) and it gave them a good cookie texture. They MUST be refrigerated to crisp up or yes they crumble. I just put the whole tray in my fridge to cool. I think I might try Xylitol next time. These are super sweet.
Terrific and easy recipe though.

These cookies tasted good however need to add an extra egg for high altitude.  First batch was like loose flour.  Second batch added an extra egg and then it turned out fine.

I took everyone's advise & added the vanilla, in addition I put the mixture in the frig for about 5 min., making it easier to roll into a ball, then I pressed with the fork., 1st batch was just the peanut butter, then I added rolled oats to the remainder.  They're ok, will try them later tonite after they've set awhile. I'd make again just because they're sugar free & will give us the much needed snack at nite.

These cookies are great for my low-carb dieting boyfriend! He and I really enjoyed them. As other reviewers stated, they are very crumbly when they first come out of the oven (I broke a few) so be careful when slipping them onto a cooling rack. I followed the directions almost exactly (but cut the recipe in half as I wanted only a dozen). Then, I cut them into little heart shapes, dabbed a fork in Splenda and made the typical fork impression for a super-cute heart-shaped peanut butter cookie! Great recipe!

This did not turn out at all as expected. The cookies could not stay together and crumbled right in my hands. I followed the recipe exactly as stated and added a little vanilla extract. Was not worthy of eating.

As difficult as it is to find sugarfree varieties in things I was THRILLED to find this recipe!  Adding the 1-2tsp. of vanilla" as suggested, was a must!  I made some powdered 'splenda' sugar and sprinkled the hot cookies with a bit of it for a light and yummy glaze.  LOVED THIS ONE!!

Ok , sugar free. It is what it is and we all know it usually falls short but I added 3 ounces of cream cheese, 1 teaspoon of vanilla and a little honey and they were pretty good actually .

Mixed feelings. I used Splenda as the sugar substitute, which was not over powering in our opinion. I also added a tsp of Haitian Vanilla extract which is a little stronger than what is sold in most grocery stores. They were very yummy, the inside was very soft and melted in your mouth. When we make cookies in this house, we have a tendency to devour them right away while they are nice and warm. To my disappointment they were pretty dry and crumbly but I did notice that as they cooled, they held up a little better. So next time we will resist the urge and wait for them to cool. So ridiculously simple to make and very budget friendly as well.

Great recipe for people into bodybuilding/working out that cannot have sugar or carbs.  I used egg whites, natural PB, and added two scoops of vanilla protein powder for additional protein.  Great recipe!

Hey, these are pretty good.  I used a little more than 1/2 the sugar sub, because I used the Splenda sugar blend for baking.  The diabetics in my family are going to like these:)

I JUST MADE THESE COOKIES FOR MY HUSBAND, AND THEY CAME OUT KIND OF CRUMBLY AND DRY. I happen to use peterpan instead of natural pb so maybe that is where i went wrong. I'll give it another try sometime. 

Merry Christmas!

The taste of this cookie is great, other than the overpowering peanut buttery taste... maybe some vanilla? its just the factor that they did not stay together... maybe it was the brand of peanut butter, or the sugar free. on a light colored pan the bottoms burnt... not a great smell in the kitchen... i love the idea and the flavor... and i will test them until i figured out the way that works best for us.

I love the idea of sugar free cookies but I dont like the idea of Sucralose, not sure which is worse......
