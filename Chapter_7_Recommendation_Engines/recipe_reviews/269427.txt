Didn’t have spinach or garam masala, so. I didn’t include spinach and used turmeric and cardamom instead. Tasty

didn't have sweet potato or red lentils. used russet potatoes (unpeeled) and green lentils instead. didn't measure out the seasoning, so probably used a little more than what's called for on the garam masala and seasoning salt (Pappy's). I know for a fact I used much more cayenne, 1/2 - 3/4 tsp., but I like more heat than most. I simmered for 30 - 35 min., but that's only because I used green lentils

turned out great, will be making again

I really wanted to like this soup. Unfortunately, for my tastes, I wasn’t a fan. Between the sweet potatoes and the garam masala, it was just too sweet for me. I do think that I could tweak just a couple of things and have it be more to my taste. Possibly using red potatoes and using less or no garam masala and maybe adding a bit more spice to offset the sweetness. The recipe was well formulated and easy to follow.
