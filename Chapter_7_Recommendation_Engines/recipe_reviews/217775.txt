I made this for a party of 12 and it was delicious.  I added some other flavors like one garlic clove, shallots, cayanne and parsley.  I used 4 2lb Maine lobsters, lumb crab and small shrimp.  I followed the calculations for 12 and had enough left over for another 4 people.  Delicious and impressive.

I used all walleye, and it worked well!  The combination of seafood would be good too (I'm sure), but in case you only have 1lb of shrimp or 1lb of fish... I would still recommend you give this recipe a try.

Very rich dish.  Salt and pepper added at the table made it perfect.

This was WONDERFUL and I shall make it again. 

I did however, make a few (minor?) changes. I did not use the cream of shrimp soup. I used swai (on sale for $.99!) for my fish fillet and large shrimp and no lobster (maybe could have doubled the crab...).   Has a wonderful thin parmesan crisp on top. We served it with rice and stir fried brocolli. 

Goes to show...this can be good no matter what. I definitely recommend it as your guide to a good meal

Absolutely DELICIOUS!! My husband loved it!  Used 1/2 shrimp and 1/2 lobster, cooking sherry and vermouth.  Served over rice with green beans.  Will definitely make again.

I don't often take the time to leave a review.  I found this recipe tonight while searching for something to do with some small walleye pieces I had.  What a find!!!   I used 1/4 lb walleye, 1/4 lb shrimp, and 1/2 lb crab (no lobster).  I added some garlic and Old Bay, as a previous reviewer had suggested.  Other than that I followed the recipe as written and it was divine.  I will absolutely be making this in the future.  My husband said it tasted like something we would eat in a fancy Charleston restaurant.

Very tasty. We like to spend our Saturday evening dinners tag-teaming in the kitchen, so this one was fun. I love lobster thermidor, so this recipe caught my interest. I usually follow the recipe closely the first time so I can appreciate the chef’s intent, and due to how we obtained our ingredients we doubled the walleye and lobster. Next time I’ll cut the bread crumbs in half because I like my thermidor a little more loose. Because it’s rich, we’re reserving this for future special occasions.
