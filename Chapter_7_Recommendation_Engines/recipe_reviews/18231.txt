This was excellent.  I added some Old Bay, per other reviwers' suggestions, but I tasted the dip before I added the Old Bay and it tasted great.  This one will be used again and again.

This was very good with thin crackers. I used imitation crab, but everything else I stayed with the recipe. Made it for a dinner party and everyone loved it.

Great stuff! I used 6.5 oz of crab instead, but the rest was to the original recipes proportions.

This a great dip, I used shrimp instead of crab b/c it was on sale and only 1 package of cream cheese and added Greek yogurt b/c that's what I had. Still it was a huge hit!
