This has changed my life!!  No more guzzling to have full strength drinkies.  I was adventurous and tried green tea.  Also good, so I tried coffee.  A hit.  Always love to try new things to impress the in-laws, but they just rolled their eyes.  I would suggest that everyone keep this little secret to themselves.

Thanks for giving our creativity a kick start, Erin! Great idea. I like lime cokes, so I did a tray using limeade, and a tray using raspberry juice for our morning smoothies. Thanks for sharing!

Been doing this for years. Especially when it is as hot outside as it is today (over 100 degrees!) this is a great way to keep beverages cold longer. I have an automatic ice maker built in under my counter, but I bought ice cube trays especially for this use! I have also used this idea to pour my kids favorite drinks in a cup, let it melt just a bit and have wonderful slushies!

Well, thanx for the idea, but I've done it a million times, and at first I thought I wouldn't try it. However, I LOVE tea, and I enjoyed this! Thanx!

What a great and simple idea! I tried this with punch I made for Christmas and froze some of it (until slushy) in custard cups instead of ice cube trays. It looked great and kept the punch cold without getting it watery.

OMG!!!!  I remember doing this as a kid but as inexpensive little ice pops made out of Kood-Aid and tootpicks!  AR never ceases to amaze me with the endless amount of recipes on here....it's like a blast from the past.  And a great reminder of how I can use some old recipes now so I don't water down drinks on a hot day. I hate to say this but I may use this for wine.  I know it's like some sort of bartending sin to put ice in wine but who wants to drink warm white wine???

What A fantastic Idea i thought.  The Mrs. loves her booze so I tried to make vodka ice cubes so her drink would get stronger as they melted.  The whole operation was a bust when the vodka didn't freeze.  Oh well.

I like to use a mix of lemonade and black tea to make ice cubes. It's one of the best ideas because you can enjoy your tea but not get cranky over regular water-made ice cubes watering down your tea.

Why it took me so long to make these ice cubes is beyond me. Hot summer days + ice = diluted beverage. No more watered down iced tea or lemonade!  I made a tray of each today - so glad I finally got around to it.  (Hmmm, I wonder if I could do this with Coke Zero?)

Love this idea...so simple and yet how did we not think of this.  I use juice to put into my tea for more flavor...and I use them in my son's juice cups to keep them colder longer without watering down his juice.  Thanks for a great idea.

I just love this recipe! I made the ice cubes out of mango peach green tea because this is the tea my husband enjoys for dinner. Tonight he'll be surprised with a special dinner with heart-shaped cubes in his tea. 5/20/2016 A great idea to keep any drink from becoming watery due to ice. I used coffee cubes in my iced coffee, and it stayed nice and strong until the last drop.
