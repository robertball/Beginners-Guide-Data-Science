5 stars all the way, so delicious. I did add vanilla off-heat and since my butter was unsalted I added some salt too. I only make chocolate gravy once every 5 years or so but so worth it every time! Thanks for sharing.

This is very similar to the chocolate gravy that I learned to make from my mother, who learned from her mother. Three generations that i know making this. Only difference is we use some vanilla in it. Sooo yummy over warm, fresh homemade biscuits.

Oh, wow! This stuff is amazing and even my husband, who could go without sweets (wah? I know) loved it. I did put in some vanilla extract and added a touch of salt. We had it on vanilla ice cream and was really good. Definitely a keeper and will make again! Thanks for sharing with all of us.

I used 2% milk instead of whole milk. I mixed the sugar and cocoa well before adding to pan, stirred it together and poured milk in before it solidified. Thickened well, and was ever so delicious. At 58 years old, it was my husbands first time having chocolate gravy, who would have ever thought? Glad I ran across this to remind me of the times past, and bring a taste of those times to my love.

Since I used unsalted butter, I threw in some salt;  also added vanilla.  Pudding like texture.  Good.

as one reviewer said, she had a hard time dissolving the sugar/cocoa mixture without it burning. I burned the first batch, then second time I heated the sugar/cocoa mixture well but didn't try to dissolve it all the way...once I started adding the milk it worked fine and ended up perfectly smooth. it was really good! only used 1/4 cup cocoa but everything else was the same. also a great dip with pretzels!!!

I had serious issues getting the sugar to melt in with the roux before the coco powder started burning, even after watching the video, changing pans, changing temperatures, melting through a whisk, etc. I just wasted so much cocoa powder.

This was very different for us and we liked it! I don't know how often I would actually make this as it does remind me more of a dessert than a breakfast item, which is not a bad thing, but this was definitely fun to try. Thanks for sharing. :)
