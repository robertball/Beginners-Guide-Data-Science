I followed the recipe exactly. The vegetable topping (tomato, pepper and onion) did not soften as much as I would have liked.  Additionally, there wasn't much flavor.  If I made this again, I would caramelize the vegetables in a pan on the stove and add at the end, and drizzle a flavored olive oil (like garlic or basil) over the fish to bake in the oven.

A great way to add flavor to Cod. Wanted something that was healthy, not battered, fried, or cheesy. This was very tasty. I used two green scallions instead of onion and I didn't have bell pepper but didn't miss it. Topped with a little shaved parmesan before serving. I might try a little white wine in the mix next time.

I just used what I had , didn’t have the fresh basil or garlic, added dill . Used all ingredients in the dry form except fresh tomatoes and green pepper and onion . I think it will be good, it’s in the oven!!!
