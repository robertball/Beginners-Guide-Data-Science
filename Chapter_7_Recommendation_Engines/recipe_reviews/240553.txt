I only had Trader Joes Black Rice when I was ready to make this salad, I thought it was wild rice until too late, my mistake. It made the whole salad purple, which is pretty and very UW (go Huskies!) My fennel bulb was huge so I only used one. I think fennel is what made the salad so interesting and different - I make and eat kale salads all the time, I love to make them on Sunday and take them to work for lunch all week. Thanks for another winner, Scandogirl, it was delicious and held up well all week. BTW, My husband had to sprinkle his with cayenne, which I admit was good too, he used just a pinch so not hot, just a little different flavor.

This is fabulous by itself but I had some mushrooms and a baked chicken breast I wanted to use.  I browned one cup sliced mushrooms,  1 clove garlic and 1 chicken breast sliced in olive oil.  I added juice of 1 lime and then mixed with wild rice and topped the salad with it.  Next time I am going to add some grape tomatoes and grated cheese. Really quick to fix and I will definitely  be making it again!  Thanks for submitting!

This is a very healthy salad but next time I will sprinkle the salt over the kale and knead kale for 3-5 minutes.  This tenderizes the kale and it's easier to eat.  The rice poured over the kale just does not tenderize the kale enough for me.  I love all the ingredients and will probably make it again.  Thanks.

Prepared this salad just as the recipe states.  It's good, but bland.  Logged back on to All Recipes to see what others might have added, then noticed the option at the bottom of adding blue cheese crumbles, which I happened to have on hand.  The blue cheese helps, but I'm going to keep searching for just the right zing and try again.

Thought it was great. I think you could mix everything all together at once rather than waiting till the end to add the kale. I also added some blanched asparagus to it, and added a little garlic powder to the dressing which was good. Seved it with cast iron seared rib eye! Makes a great fully balance meal. Also, if you want to prepare the salad ahead of time, just add everything, even the rice, store in fridge, and add the dressing about 10 mins before serving.

Fantastic!! It looked so pretty and tasted even better. I will definitely be making this more often. Kept well for several days so it was great for lunches.

I loved the mixture of vegetables but thought there was way too much oil and lemon.  In the future I will use a different dressing.  Also, I saut√©ed the veg very slightly.

We eat a lot of kale in a variety of ways (juiced, dehydrated into chips, sauteed), but my husband and I both found this very bland. All the ingredients are great; it just needs something more--fresh herbs and maybe some vinegar. I added more mustard to the leftovers and that improved it a bit, but this isn't something I'd make again. Thanks, anyway.
