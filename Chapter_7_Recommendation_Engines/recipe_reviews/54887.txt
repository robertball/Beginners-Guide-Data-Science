I cooked this leg of lamb exactly as the preparations directions described, even though I question a baking time of 45 minutes @ 375 and then another 15 minutes.  The leg of lamb was raw and it ruined our New Years Day dinner.  I was very disappointed as was my family.  You need to be a little more specific for baking time

I'm giving this 5 stars on ease! The flavor is also very good. I doubled the garlic, used finely crush dried rosemary and sprinkled with some garlic salt after pouring on the tomato sauce. I suggest you keep a thermometer in the meat and keep an eye on it. Everyone's oven is a little different. 4 hours would have been way past well done for my roast. This is a fabulous roast for Sunday supper! I'll do it again and again..rave reviews from the family. Garlic, Italian herbs, cayenne, salt and olive oil on baby red potatoes is a great compliment..put into oven last hour of lamb roast. EASY and elegant

Very good, first time to eat lamb, was a little nervous but it turned out very good. I cooked it longer than the recipe suggests (2lb. roast in a crook pot for 4 hours).

I agree with another reviewer that cooking times "are never exact" as the meat and your own oven can vary by many minutes; always use a meat thermometer and cook lamb to 13-135 letting rest about 15 minutes out of the oven. Lamb shhoud be "crusty" on the outside and slightly pink in the middle. I thought this was a great basic recipe. I do like to roast lamb on a rack, over a pan which adds a "convection effect" on a standard oven. Even using true convestion, this meathod has turned out best for me. Again, nice recipe.

So easy and soooo tasty. I added some potatoes and sweet potato into the pan along with some water and extra tomato sauce an hour before the lamb was ready. This allowed the sauce to soak into the potatoes and tasted wonderful.

This was one of the best Lamb recipes I ever made! My mother who doesn't eat Lamb said it was the best tasting meats ever! I added at least 10-15 cloves of garlic and then because my Lamb was 6 lbs I added 2 cans of Sauce. Cooked on low heat for about 1 1/2 hours for a total of 2+ hours. Awesome!

Perfection!  I have to comment on those who took the cook time so literally...the recipe comment says it requires "patience"...thus when it tells you what the internal temp. should be, then you simply must use a meat thermometer...experienced cooks know this.  I use a meat thermometer for every kind or cut of meat I cook. I recommend a meat thermometer in every kitchen!

This was a wonderful, basic kind of recipe, just waiting for our own taste to be added. For those commenting previously.... as stated before by many others, you should always use a meat thermometer when roasting any meat. (however, I do understand that time is of essence when it comes to serving dinner on time) Ovens vary tremendously. My own oven can vary from day to day, depending on so many things. Kind of cooking vessel, thickness of meat, added ingredients. One recipe needs less time than stated, others need more. Some people said this recipe lacked  flavour. Well, use more salt. If you use too little salt you'll not have the flavour you're looking for. Use more garlic. More pepper.  Personally I swiped my finger across the meat half way through cooking and tasted it. I found it needed more salt, so at that point added more. Thank you for this recipe. I'd never thought of adding tomato sauce to roast lamb, but it sure gave the meat a new dimension and a great sauce. Oh, I'm editing to add that a good practice when using slivers of garlic is to sprinkle a little salt in the slits before pushing the garlic in. The flavour of the salt will not only be on the outside of the meat, but the inside as well.

This is a great recipe! This is a very different flavor from what you would expect from in a lamb dish. I spice it up a bit with hot salsa in place of the tomato sauce, or by adding jalapeno pepers, and it is unbelievable.

I thought it was good, but my husband thought it made it taste more like beef than lamb, so if you're looking for a nice Lamb-y flavor, this is not the recipe for you.

Once the lamb was cooked, it was great, but there is something very wrong with either the oven temperature or the cooking time listed.  Cooked at 375 degrees for 45 minutes and then after 15 minutes at 325, the internal temp of the meat was only about 120 degrees.  It took about an hour and 15 minutes at 325 before the lamb reached 150 degrees.  At that point I sliced and microwaved to proper doneness.

I used about twice the tomato sauce (24 oz) and when I turned the heat down, I also poured about a cup of water over the rosemary tied on top to keep it from drying out and blackening. This makes the most wonderful red sauce/gravy, almost identical in flavor to what is traditionally served over rice with lamb dishes in greek restaurants.

I was skeptical of adding the tomato paste but it gave it a great flavor, color and texture.  I found the cooking time to be spot on, give or take 5 minutes.  Will definitely make this a staple of my cooking.  Thanks.

PLEASE CHECK THE REVIEWS BEFORE YOU MAKE THIS! The cooking time is WAY off but the flavor is great. I started this around 2 p.m., did an hour at 375 and about an hour to an hour and a half at 325. I let the roast rest covered in the warm oven while the rest of the meal cooked and served dinner by 5 p.m. I skimmed off most of the fat and made a sauce from the tomatoes, used canned diced tomatoes. A delicious and really special main dish.

Very tasty; used a quart of my own home-canned tomato sauce, which condensed on the roasting pan to make a very nice reduction with the drippings from the lamb. Agree with others who say that it took considerably longer than advertised to roast (2.5 hours sounds about right).

Best and easy recipe. Made it for dinner. Juicy, and yummy. Both my mom and my wife loved it too.

One tweak we did was a pre-marination with raw papaya to make the meat tender. It worked well and the meat was ready in 45 mins of baking @ 190 (after preheat).

Thanks!
