I love a good chowder and this was very tasty.  I am not a fan of canned soup, so I omitted that, and used a cup of cream mixed with a TBSP cornstarch.  I added less milk than was called for, as I do like it thicker than most.

I served with https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/7146/cheddar-bay-biscuits/
Those are a big hit in my family as it reminds us of the biscuits at red lobster.

I had this very chowder in Ireland and did a search in hopes of finding one similar and was THIRILLED to see that Durty Nelly has posted and shared his recipe.  I did not have shrimp so made mine with salmon and mahi mahi. I also added a bunch of chopped parsley since I had it on hand. The family loved it!!!  Excellent chowder!!
