I've only rated one other dish 5*.Came out absolutely perfect. Only observation was that I checked them at the 4hr mark and they were ready. Had I waited 5 hrs, they  would have been mush in the bottom of the pot. What flavor!!! Made them again, this time I put them under the broiler for a few minute after I took them out of the crock (after 4hrs). They were tender - but dry. Guess I won't do that again (the broiler part).

I substitute ribs for thick, boneless pork chops and they always taste amazing.  After cooking, I strain the liquid into a sauce pan.  Then. I mix 2tbsp corn starch to 2 tbsp cold water, add it to the liquid, and bring to a boil until thick (about five minutes).  It makes for a WONDERFUL sauce to pour over the pork chops - guests love it every time!

I used pork country style ribs & seared them first to remove some of the fat. After they were done & falling off the bone, I plated the ribs on a platter & poured the liquid into a saucepan & reduced it by a third; adding cornstarch mixed in cold water when reduced. It thickened up perfectly! I served these w/ baked white american macaroni & cheese, cola beans & onions & cucumbers marinated in Italian dressing. Talk about some comfort food!!!

there are really no words for this! MMMMM! I never thought that a crock pot could make such delicious ribs. The meat is so tender that it falls right off of the bone when taking them out. ( that's a good thing)very easy to make works well with regular bbq sauce substituted as well.!

I gave this only 4* b/c of the thinness of the sauce. I doubled the amount of meat and used country style boneless pork ribs. Therefore I decided to 4X the sauce ingredients except for the beef broth (I used 2 - 14.5 oz cans for that). I ran out of soy sauce so used some teriyaki sauce I had on hand. I added 1 tsp. liquid smoke, 1 tsp. Worcestershire sauce, 1/2 tsp. ground ginger, 1 tsp. garlic powder, 1/2 tsp black pepper to liquid then added it to the meat in the slow cooker. I cooked for 1 hour on high setting and then 4 hours on the low setting. Meat turned out very tender but the sauce needed some work (which after reading previous reviews I expected). I strained the sauce into a saucepan and brought to a boil and continued boiling for 15 minutes. Then I added 1/4 cup cornstarch mixed with 1/4 cup cold water, returned to a boil and cooked until thickened. Next time I'll use 1/2 cup of cornstarch and cold water b/c the sauce was still a little thin. However, the taste was GREAT!!! I'll be making this again soon!!!

Scaled to 2.5 lbs of ribs, and used a full bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's Honey BBQ.  Still was runny, but man, that is one tasty sauce!!!  2.5 hours on HIGH, and 4.5 hours on LOW - these, to me, were perfect.  (DH thought they were a touch dry).  Will make again, but next time, I'll be adding in either cayenne or hot sauce for a bit of a kick to the sweet.

EASY and DELICIOUS - what more could you ask for?  I used worcesterhire instead of soy because of personal preference only.  Meat is so tender - falls off the bone!  If you like moist ribs, you'll love this!  Thanks for the great recipe!!!!!

I served a party of 25 this recipe and it received rave reviews! I loved that it was so easy to make too. I changed the recipe to 21 servings and used boneless country style pork ribs and was able to cook it all in just two 3.5qt crockpots. Served with homemade corn muffins, canned baked beans and roasted summer squash, along with a small keg of root beer.

My husband took one bite and said I am the new rib cooker in the house.  I did make a lot of changes, omitted water, baked at 300 for 10mins prior, added much more bbq sauce, much more honey,  I used a Carolina Mustard bbc sauce instead of honey mustard, and I then basted in honey bbq sauce and put under the broiler for about 7 mins at the end.  I did find it to be a bit watery, so next time I will omit the soy sauce and cut back on the broth.  I saved the sauce and will use it as a marinade for pork chops later in the week.  In the summer we may try cooking htem like this, then throwing them on the grill for a few mins instead of the broiler

If you prefer your ribs or chops with that wonderful sauce adhered to the meat, I agree completely. The sauce is thin, but that is the only reason it works so nicely in the crock pot. The solution is simple. Cook according to the directions. After the meat is done, transfer a good amount of the sauce into a pot and thicken that sauce with a water/cornstarch mixture. Voila! You have a wonderful, tender, and flavorful meat with thickened sauce to accompany it. The flavor of this sauce is to die for, and the simplicity of preparation is a dream come true for any hostess. I opted to use boneless ribs with this recipe and they were fabulous! The flavor was unique but one that would be enjoyed by most taste buds. I served this to two adults and three fussy pre-teens with different tastes. EVERYONE enjoyed this! I love a dish that tastes great and needs very little attention so I can spend time with my guests. This recipe fills these requirements and then some. Thank you so much for this easy and flavorful recipe! The taste of this is sensational! Also-add full bottle of BBQ sauce instead of water or broth to cover.

Wow. This was phenomenal. This was the first time ever that I have made ribs, and I have never tasted anything better!! The meat slid right off the bone and the flavour was incredible! Only change I made was to use all beef broth rather than water.  Excellent.

We have made this recipe many times and we really enjoy it.  My husband requests "crock pot ribs" when he wants a special meal- referring to this recipe!  A couple tidbits I have gleaned over many times of making this: 1.) Do not make the mistake of getting beef back ribs- spend the extra money and get the pork baby back ribs.  Otherwise, you will be disappointed with the greasiness of the ribs/sauce. 2.) As other reviewers suggest, take these out of the crock pot, drizzle with BBQ sauce, and crisp them up in your oven broiler for a few minutes prior to serving.  This makes for an excellent texture and flavor.

I followed some other's suggestions and omitted the water, as well as maple syrup (hone AND honey mustard is more than enough sweetness for me) and used worschester sauce instead of the soy sauce and they turned out great. I also didn't cut the ribs into individual pieces, but just cut them enough so that they would lay somewhat flat in the crock pot. I was hoping for a very tender, juicy, fall-off-the-bone rib and that's exactly what I got. It really depends on what style ribs you like as to whether you'll enjoy these, but I certainly did. My husband, who really likes BBQ sauce, liked these and surprisingly didn't even use any additional BBQ sauce on them! Would definitely recommend due to taste and ease of cooking method.

Sounds like wonderful sauce. I recommend using the par boil, crockpot then slow cook on grill method I learned from All Recipes. That minimizes the waterey sauce on the ribs. Cooking them on the grill gives them that thick, sticky wonderful sauce that you see in ads.

Wow, really, really good, fall off the bone ribs.  I made half the recipe and added 1 more cup of broth, 5 garlic cloves, and cooked it at the 4 hour setting.  Delicious and will make again and again.

These were some of the best ribs I've ever had.  They do literally fall off the bone when you bite into them.  I didn't alter the ingredients at all on this recipe, just thickened up the sauce with some corn starch after they were done cooking. I look forward to using this recipe again.  Serve with red garlic mashed potatoes, perfect combo.  Thanks!

These ribs are sssoooo good and after you take them out of the crock just put some barbeque sauce on them and let the sauce cook on for about 20 minutes at 300 degrees. Perfecto!!!!!

The thing is...yes these ribs were very tender and did flake apart.  But really, anything you slow cook in a crockpot is going to do the same thing.  So I hate to rate this recipe on that alone.  So I will rate it more on flavor which I think it really lacked.  They had this sweet but bland taste and the sauce was the consistancy of water.  My mom and I took them out, poured a bottle of the honey bbq sauce over them and baked them in the oven for about 10 minutes.  Then and only then were they really good.  We also used the country style pork ribs and they still turned out really good.  But again, that is only because we baked them with bbq sauce after they had been slow cooked.

Very yummy and very easy.  Ingredients are simple.  I bought 5 1/2# of pork loin ribs at Costco, so I'll be making this recipe again soon with the extras frozen in the freezer.  Our ribs cooked up great in 4 hours on high.  The hickory honey flavor tasted great.  The whole family loved them, even our picky 4-year olds.  I'd love a suggestion on how to thicken up the juices for a bbq sauce to serve with; I've never been thrilled with jarred sauces which I may resort to next time.

These were definitely "fall-off-the-bone" ribs! Very tender, super easy.  I also substituted worstechier sauce for soy sauce as other reviews had said.  My boyfriend loved them and I will be making ribs MUCH more often now with this recipe!

My husband LOVED these ribs. He would give it more than 5 stars if possible. He said they were the best he had ever had. I really like them, too, so we will definitely have them again.

Actually, I was disappointed.  Yes, the meat fell off the bone, but I guess I like a more 'stick to the ribs' sauce.    Once I figured out that the consistency of the sauce was much thinner than I had hoped for, I took out the meat and added about 3/4 cup uncooked rice and let that cook until done, about 30 minutes.  I served the meat over the rice and it was great.  Left-overs the next day was even better.

These turned out just ok. There wasn't a very strong flavor so we slathered them in honey BBQ sauce anyway. I had high hopes but it kind of fell flat. Thanks though....

I made this by the recipe except omitting the broth and water per others reviews.  I'm not a big salt fan, so I cut down on the soy a little also.  The husband and the kids (even my picky one) liked these.  I thought they were okay, but nothing to rave about.  I trimmed the ribs of all visible fat, but the crockpot was still full of oil at the end and the ribs were gray.  Quite unappetizing.  I stuck them under the broiler for a few minutes to resolve the color, but they were still greasy.  Maybe I should have drained some of the fat as they cooked.  But it still gets 4 stars because my very picky 6-year old ate them.

i loved this recipe. i only rated it a 4 because i didn't follow the directions exactly. i am afraid if i did that it would have turned out to be too watery. instead i doubled everything and used a whole bottle of bbq sauce. i omitted the water like everyone suggested by kept the broth. at the end i took out the ribs, basted them and then broiled them for a couple minutes (with the door slightly open.) i took all the sauce left over in the crock pot, added a little flour/water to thicken up the sauce even more (it was plenty thick already.) i am using it to make home made baked beans! yummy!! my husbands rates everything i do and he rated this a number 2 on his list.

I only used one can of beef broth, no water, and doubled all the other ingredients.  These were MARVELOUS!!!  I will cook them again, and again, and again!

Thanks for sharing!

This recipe was really good. The meat truly falls off the bone.  I highly recommend that you triple the barbecue sauce and reduce the water.

Very good.  I agree the sauce was thin.  I ended up reducing it and mixing 3 T of corn startch with 3T of water to thicken.  Once thickened it was perfect.  If I make this again I will probably leave out the 1/2 cup of water.  I also felt like I needed to double the sauce in order to cover the ribs.  I probably won't do that again

Very good and easy recipe.  The ribs came out super tender.  The only complaint I had was that it didn't make enough sauce, and the sauce was too thin.  So I drizzled the top of the ribs with bottled BBQ sauce after I put everything into the crockpot.  Smelled so good while cooking we couldn't wait!

Very yummy and tender ribs. Sauce was way too thin. I will somehow alter next time-but the flavor was great.  I used spare ribs, so after 1.5 hrs on high they were almost done (I think this is why they cooked so much fast.) I turned the crock pot down to low for two hours then just warm for the rest of the time-hubby was still at work! Will make again but maybe use less broth so its thicker-and maybe some sort of thickening agent.....?

Pros: Ribs were tender.  Cons: Ribs had surprisingly little flavor after soaking in a watery broth for six hours.  We don't care for honey mustard, so we replaced it with chipotle Tabasco sauce for an extra kick. Cooked in a crock pot on high for about four hours, then switched to low for another two hours. The meat was falling off the ribs, but we had to cover it in BBQ sauce to give it any flavor.

Absolutely DELICIOUS! The meat was so tender it just slid off the bone. I left it in the crock pot for an extra 30 minutes but I think it would have been fine without it. I had to add a little extra broth because my ribs weren't covered. My husband says this is a MUST have recipe, and I couldn't agree more.

Fabulous!  Yeah, the sauce was thin when finished, no problem.  I thickened it on the stove top and spooned it over the meat on our plates, as well as over my roasted potatoes (yum!).  I loved the flavor of this sauce, not so tangy and sharp like other sauces.  I used boneless ribs, I should have considered that and shortened the cooking time.  They cut with a fork, tasted great, just a tad dry inside (my fault).  I used pure maple syrup and Dijon mustard because I didn't have any honey mustard.  Really, really good.  Definitely making again.

I used country ribs and thicken the sauce with 1/4 cup of water and 1/4 cup of corn starch. I only had to cook the ribs for 3 hrs on high in the slower cooker and 1hr. on low. I served with rice and fried cabbage... My family loved the meal. Excellent, thanks!

Very good recipe and is a keeper! We served it with white rice for  dinner and my fiancé enjoyed it very much. I made my own honey garlic BBQ sauce also found here at allrecipes and turned out great.  We even used the extra honey BBQ sauce we had as a dip for the meat.

Excellant. would have posted picture but they got eaten before I had a chance. Appreciate not having to marinade for hours to get full flavour and fall off the bone.  I did sub beer for water,and probably a little extra of everything else as had more ribs than recipe. Really good. shredded what I did have left with a little sauce for Honey to have on a bun. excellant rib sandwich.

Really easy and quite good!  I followed the suggestions to NOT add the beef broth and the water and I am so glad that I didn't.  After 4 hours on high, my 4.5 lbs. of ribs were almost covered in their juices.  I removed them and put them in a 325 degree oven for 40 minutes, basting occasionally as recommended and turned them over halfway.  A very good recipe - thanks!

WOW this was excellent. I had to use dijon mustard instead of honey mustard because thats all I had. I made with honey baked beans and garlic mashed potatoes. This is one of my faves on this site.

Wow! This sauce is exceptional. Easy receipe, too. I didn't have 5 hours to cook, so I put it in the oven on 375 in a covered dish for 2 hours. It turned out fabulous!

Tried this recipe last week though had to change it some. Just used beefy mushroom soup instead of broth and doubled the honey since my BBQ sauce wasn't honey flavored. I'm sure as listed, this is still a wonderful recipe.

These were fabulous! My husband and I had these for the first time last night, and loved each bite. We're going to try the sauce with a cut of beef, we liked it so much!

These were great!  I took them out of the slow cooker and basted them with some more of the honey bbq sauce and broiled them for a few minutes to darken them.  They were amazing.

This was very good.  It might be 5 stars...I did a little modifying.  I cooked on low for 10 hours and substituted in just regular pork ribs rather than baby backs.  And I 1.5x the recipe.  It was a little oily, so I just skimmed it off.  And I added a bit more of the bbq sauce to jazz up the flavor.  My kids, age 6 and 9, couldn't get enough!

An added idea for all the extra liquid is to thicken some it with flower and drizzle it over the ribs for extra flavor!!

I'm re-writing my review because I made a few changes and it went from 5 stars to 10 stars. I omitted the beef broth and water, upped the BBQ and honey and cut the ribs into 3 bone pieces instead of all individual. This seemed to keep the meat much more tender, and there wasn't so much liquid. I cooked on low about 7 hours (basted from the cooking juices once), put the rib pieces in a baking pan (carefully, the bones were falling out) brushed them with a tiny bit of barbeque sauce and put them under the broiler for 4 minutes to get crispy and brown. Meanwhile, I took the liquid from the crock, added some cornstarch and simmered to make a very nice sauce for the ribs. It was so delicious!!!

added cornstarch to liquid while cooking to thicken sauce.  Very Yummy. Able to stuff 5 1/2 lbs of ribs into crockpot.  All was eaten in one night.  Very easy to make.

These don't replace smoked ribs, but they were loved by everyone at my table.  Super quick and easy I followed the recipe as is (except cooked for only 4 hrs).  I took 1/2 the ribs and threw them under the broiler for 3 minutes.  We liked them both ways, though if we throw them under the broiler again we'll put some BBQ sauce on them first.  Broiling them helped them stay on the bone so you could eat them.  We also thickened up the sauce into a gravy which my husband absolutly loved.

Thought these were pretty good, it was definitely fall-off-the-bone style ribs.  I wish the sauce would have thickened up, and I guess I could have put it in a pan and cooked it down, but that defeats the purpose of slow cooking.  I'm just more of a smoked rib with thick sauce kina gal.  But I will make these when we aren't using the smoker.

Although the texture was fall off the bone.  The taste was terrible.  Sorry.  I think it is the slow cooker methodology, because the ingredients should have yielded better results.

4 stars for the sauce.  With the cost of baby back ribs I would NOT slow cooker them, use a cheaper cut of pork and you'll be happy with the results.

My family loved this, even my daughter who isn't a huge meat eater! I used chicken broth instead of beef, regular mustard, and our family's favorite BBQ sauce, and it turned out amazing. Still plenty of honey flavor! My meat was a bit thick, so it took almost 6 hours, but they fell off the bone. Yum! If you're not a fan of all the sweet, you could scale back the honey and maple syrup a bit, or choose a tangy or spicy BBQ sauce to cut the sweetness a bit. I'll make this again!

This was absolutely delicious and just fell off the bone.  I added regular Bullseye BBQ Sauce along with the honey BBQ sauce and followed the recipe exactly as is.  My husband is already requesting these again for next weekend.  Great way to cook them when you cannot grill out.  THANKS.

these ribs have a great taste to them. The only thing i did different was after they cook for the 5 hours i place then in a pan and pour BBQ sauce over them and baked for another 45 min they turn out great. It is a keeper in my book. great taste and great favor.

This is phenomenal. I only made a few minor alterations based on what I had on had - I omitted the broth and water, and just dumped in a bottle of dunkelweiss beer. I also used Melinda's Coffee BBQ Sauce instead of honey bbq. I used about 3.5 lbs of boneless baby back ribs - there is plenty of juice for increasing the recipe! Finally, I added onion and garlic slices, just because I can't make anything without those two ingredients. We ate this 2 ways - the first night we made sandwiches with melted cheese and a bbq sauce/mayo dressing. That was excellent. With the leftovers, I strained the sauce into a sauce pan, reduced and thickened with a little corn starch, then served over rice. It was DIVINE and I would definitely recommend that technique!

Was just okay for us; a very expensive cut of meat that ended up with a lot of liquid ( after I omitted the water) and flavor I found to be watered down.  Lots of grease on the top of the liquid also.  Won't make again this way again but might use the sauce (less the water) for a basting sauce for grilling the ribs.

Great recipe...not a very strong honey flavor, but the rib meat was falling off the bone when we dug in.  I like the techniques for making these ribs.

Quite nice but nothing wow about it. Use good quality sauces - I think my choice of inferior sauces really tainted the taste. Good weekday meal but I wouldn't serve it to a dinner party.

The meat was as tender as promised but the flavor wasn't that great. All in all it was an ok meal.

I was so excited about making this recipe after reading all the great reviews. I was VERY disappointed. I only cooked it for 3 hours because at 3 hours the meat was completely tough and definitely not "falling off the bone" as the other reviews said. The sauce was very watery even though I omitted the water as suggested by others.  Would not make this again. Does anyone know of any other crockpot rib recipes that are actually worth trying?

I do not add the water or broth.  Even with those omitted the sauce will be runny after cooking.  Once the ribs are done (takes less than 5 hrs) it is nice to baste them with sauce and throw in the oven or under the broiler for about 10 minutes. This gives the ribs a nice coating which they don't have otherwise.    Last time I made them I used Bull's Eye Guinness draft beer blend barbeque sauce, in the sauce in the crockpot, and used the bbq sauce alone to baste at the end.  Very delicious and easy to make!

Very delicious ribs!!  I cooked them in the crockpot for 4 hours then put in the oven at 325F for 30-45 minutes.  I put them in oven with the sauce on them and basted every 15 minutes.  They got a beautiful carmelized glaze from the sauce.  We will definately be eating these again!

I made this recipe using homemade BBQ sauce (Nana's Barbeque Sauce from this site), and it was a great combo!  The ribs were really moist, tender, flavorful, and sweet, yet not overly-sweet.  The sauce did get a bit too watery for our liking, so I am cutting the liquid down a bit next time and hopefully that will work better.  I can't wait for dinner tonight!  Yummy!

I just used this recipe as a guideline. You really can't mess it up! I didn't add any water, added more honey BBQ sauce, powdered ginger, a generous splash of hot sauce, onion, garlic, and a tablespoon of molasses. Came out great! The ribs tasted perfect and didn't need to be smothered in thick gooey sauce to be tasty, since they were so moist and tender anyway. Feel free to experiment with this one--you can't go wrong.

WOW! For once I was able to make awesome ribs!! Thank you so much for this recipe. I had company over and they just raved about the tenderness of the meat. I also made gravy - took the broth out and brought to a boil, added 1/2 cup cold water mixed with flour, a bit of pepper & garlic salt. Fabulous! Will make again and again!

I made this with the recommendation of others.  I doubled everything except the water.  I thought they were great.  Fell right off the bone, very tender and just the right amount of flavor.

My family loved this.  I used 'Western Style' ribs.  The meat fell off the bone and was very tender.  No sticky bones to mess with.  It was a fork and knife meal.

I've made this recipe several times and it turns out delicious every time.  I usually omit maple syrup (because I don't have it on hand), use all beef broth instead of some water, and double the other liquid ingredients (honey, Bbq sauce, honey mustard.)  It's great with mac n cheese and green beans!

This is the best thing I've ever made in my slow cooker! The best ribs I've ever made period! I followed other reviewers adviced and skipped the water,added another splash of soy sauce, tripled the BBQ sauce, and added about 3/4 cup more beef broth to cover them. After 5 hour on high I put them under the broiler for 10 minutes and they were perfect! I strained, boiled and thickened the sauce like people suggested but nobody touched it. The ribs were so moist and flavourful they didn't need any extra help. I want to save the left over sauce because it's so good but don't know what to do with it! Try this recipe- it's a definate keeper.

These are the most unbelieveable, fall off the bone ribs I've ever had. I don't really like ribs that much but all the men in my family love them so I will occasionally make them. Everytime I make this recipe, they completely disappear. The only changes I make include cutting the water in half or not including it and tripling the amount of BBQ sauce.

As is the sauce is to runny and does not coat the meat well at all. Its more like a marinade. It has good flavor but I would definately cut back on the liquid and add more bbq sauce next time.

I never heard of ribs being cooked in a slow cooker before until I read this recipe and tried it. I started the slow cooker on High for about an hour, then cooked it on low for 6 hours. The ribs came out very tasty and the meat was fallinf of the bone. I used Honey Hickory Barbeque sauce instead of regular Honey Barbeque for a smokey taste. I went back for seconds. My brother says I should make this more often.

Made these for Christmas Eve and they were wonderful.  I didn't have honey mustard so used regular mustart + extra honey.  As promised, the meat was tender and fell off the bone.  I thickened the sauce with corn starch and it made a thick and delicious sauce to serve over Jasmine rice on the side.  Will make again ++++

This is really an interesting recipe.  I doubled all the sauce ingredients with the exception of the broth.  I used only 6-8 ounces of broth and eliminated the water completely.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's regular sauce - not the honey - and I did use more of that, probably an additional 1/3 cup on top of the doubled amount.  Still, the sauce is runny - it's just a result of the slow cooker method.  If you're looking for a traditional thick, sticky rib sauce you really need to use a different technique.  With this process, if you want it thicker, you have to do something with cornstarch or another thickener after the cooking process is done.  I actually didn't mind the runny-ness.  The flavor is great (although a little too sweet for us so will reduce the honey and maple syrup amounts next time) and the sauce is perfect for flavoring the rice or potato or noodle that you serve with it.  I used buffalo ribs so didn't have any problem with greasiness at all.  And, since I put these in before work and then left for the day, I cooked them on low.  Tender and flavorful and an easy and quick meal to put on the table.

These honey ribs were very tender and juicy.  Also, very easy to make.  I found that they were done in 3.5 hours.  My husband had the idea to add bbq sauce on them and then broil for 3 minutes.  They tasted great!

I used beef ribs and mustard (since I had no honey mustard).  I did not add the extra maple syrup since I did not have this either.  Thought they tasted great and were falling off the bone.  Took the suggestion of others and put some Honey BBQ sauce on them and baked in the oven for a few minutes.

These were delicious!  We followed the tips of other reviewers and popped them in the oven with the broiler on high for just a few minutes with some drizzled BBQ sauce!

Thank you SO MUCH for this awesome recipe!!  We had some spareribs that I used (have seemed to always be dry and blaah) and I gave this recipe a try, figuring IF it didn't work out I'd just toss 'em.  Guess what.....NOT A PIECE LEFT!!!  What a wonderful change from your typical BBQ ribs (which DH isn't too fond of anyways), so moist and full of flavor!  The "juice" is to die for!  I have to admit, the recipe initially sounds a bit strange BUT I am so very glad to have tried it - thank you so much!  Oh, and btw - I didn't add any water, just used the broth instead and did add onion and garlic per normal cooking at our home.  Thanks again!!!!!!

This was a great sauce! Very tasty. After reading some past reviews about the thinness of the sauce, I decided to cut down on the amount of beef broth, but other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. It was great! I think I will try this next on a steak as a marinade before grilling.

These are the BEST ribs I ever had! I followed the recipe, but since I didn't have any honey mustard, I used spicy brown mustard and about 2 tbsp of lemon juice. Also, after cooking for 4 hours, I put them in a pan, uncovered and poured Sweet Baby Rays BBQ on top. Baked for about 25 min. Delicious!

I used a beef round tip steak. I didn't have honey BBQ sauce or honey mustard, so I substituted regular BBQ sauce and plain mustard. It came out great! The sauce was thin, so I poured it over rice. Yum!

Only gave these 4 stars because I found them too sweet for my liking. They were the most tender ribs I have ever made. I will always cook them in the crock pot. Next time I will tweak the flavour a bit. Thanks for the great recipe.

Wow!  I was hesitant making this because I wasn't sure how all the ingredients would meld but this turned out to be one of the best recipes I have gotten from this website with a few slight changes.  I added half of the broth and I tripled the bbq sauce.  I didn't put in some powdered mustard instead of honey mustard (didn't have).

yes the meat was falling off the bone, but the sauce was like water.  Other reviews say to reduce and add corn starch, yes I can see doing that but if you're using a crock pot then I expect 1 step cooking! Tasty sauce, may try again with reducing.

The sauce was tasty, but way too watery.  The ribs I used (pork spare ribs)were way too fatty.  I probably won't make this again.

I made this tonight for dinner, and I thought it a bit bland. My husband thought it tasty. The ribs were very tender, but the sauce was thin. If I make this again, I will definitely thicken the sauce a bit.

The watery gray look was unappetizing, so I drained the juices and poured bold bbq sauce over them.  Meat did "fall off the bone".

These ribs were SO easy to make. We enjoyed them with mashed potatoes and sweet corn. My husband and step-son were already asking for seconds, and my daughter thought that we were probably having a dinner that was better than where she was heading to on her date!

I have never cooked ribs before and thought I'd give this one a try. It was fabulous! My DH loved them and is ready to make them again. We saved the "broth" from the crock pot and are coating our dogs dry food with it so they can enjoy a little too!

Made this exactly as the recipe stated and the finished product was as good as any I've had at restaurants. Oh... one more thing... they were done after four hours on high.  The meat just fell off the bones. Yummmmy.

Made as is the 1st time.  I found it was too salty with the soy. The second time I replaced the soy sauce with some Worcestershire. Based on other reviews, I too finished mine in the oven. Took 4 hours overall. Very good!

Very good & SO simple!  I let them cook on low all day in the crock pot.  I eliminated the water after reading other reviews.  Also forgot the soy sauce but did add a little Worcestershire sauce. Once they were cooked I brushed on a tiny bit of honey BBQ sauce and broiled them, just to brown them.  They are great either way though.  Thanks for the recipe!

I tried this and my family loved it.  I did put in skillet first to brown a little.  I added garlic salt and pepper to the meat.  I did not have honey, or honey mustard, so I ommitted that and added a little mustard instead. I mixed some beef bouillon in some water since I did not have beef stock. We made barbeque sandwiches that were very yummy!
Will definetely make this again! Thanks

These were great!  My husband loved them and he usually only likes ribs on the bar-b-que.  I used bone in pork spare ribs and they wouldn't fit in my slow cooker, so I cooked them in my cast iron dutch oven and they were PERFECT!!  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Great flavor...tasted authentic to me!  I used country style ribs, and omitted the water, but otherwise followed the recipe and cooked on low all day.  The next day I shredded the left-overs and added a little more bbq sauce for sandwiches...even better!!

I made a few modifications to this recipe, but it was delicious. I doubled the honey BBQ sauce in the sauce mixture to give it a more BBQ flavor.  For cooking time, 3.5 hours on high is enough to make them fall-off-the-bone tender.  AFter the ribs were finished in the slow cooker, we basted them with a sweet/spicy BBQ sauce mix and put them on the grill for just long enough to heat through each side.  Perfect!!  UPDATE:  Made about 3.5-4 lbs. of ribs, doubled the entire sauce recipe, and cooked 3.5 hours on high, about 15 minutes on low, and they were perfect.

Tastes great but the sauce was too runny for me. So the second time I made this recipe, I omitted the water, reduced the soy and broth amounts and switched maple syrup for honey to get a thicker sauce. Also added some cayenne pepper to cut the sweetness and add a bit of bite! YUM!

Really good flavor, but definitely runny sauce.  I thickened with a cornstarch/cold water mix.

I can't risk repeating verbatim what my honey said after trying this dish... let me assure you he LOVED it. I didn't have honey-mustard in the pantry, but instead used a good sized extra "glop" of good honey with dijon mustard. I also added a little dash of liquid smoke. Served it with cornbread and baked beans. This was so easy, it will be a regular feature. Thanks! :)

They were good and I liked cooking them in my slow cooker but I think I will stick to my way of cooking them.  I boil them till they are tender take them out of water let cool, once cool I saturate them in my favorite BBQ sauce and refrigerate all afternoon, I fire up the grill and cook till hot.

I used regular mustard & BBQ sauce instead of the honey variety, added a beef stock cube instead of liquid stock, added a tablespoon of chili paste and used no water. Had to thicken the sauce with some flour towards the end of cooking. Overall the ribs were nice but very sweet.

I used this sauce for a wonderful combination of baby back ribs, country ribs, and Polish sausage.  This recipe is "falling off the bone" delicious.  We have an industrial sized slow cooker, which I set on "warm" after we "finished" eating.  I got up twice in the middle of the night for more meat.  Irresistable.  I served this with Zesty Cole Slaw, another excellent recipe from the allrecipes website.

Oh my Gosh!!!!!!!!! This recipe is just as good as the ribs I've had at the best steak restaurants.  I took the tip from the person who broiled the ribs for a few minutes afterward.... PERFECT.  My husband said I could make it every night and he wouldn't get sick of it.

This was a pretty easy recipe. I really enjoyed making it. I didn't do anything different except I put more water in the pot which was a no-no. I think if I added more beef broth instead of water to cover the ribs they would have come out better. But like I said, that was my own fault. Overall this is a great recipe! I'll make it again.

Very easy recipe.  For me it was just ok.  Hubby loved it!  A little expensive to make with the cost of honey and maple syrup.  I don't know how it would taste with just pancake syrup.

My family and I love our ribs on the grill, but since it's cold, snowy, and frigid out, we figured ribs in the slow cooker was the next best thing. These ribs hit the spot! They were delicious and everyone enjoyed them. I agree with others that I wish the sauce was thicker, but I ended up dipping my ribs in some of the bottled bbq sauce that I used in the recipe.

Ribs were over cooked and lacked flavor. I had to put BBQ sauce on plate to enjoy. I have a new crock pot so maybe it's high setting is too high. But they were fall off the bone, and everyone knows they are not supposed to "fall off the bone"

I like to rate recipes on their original listing, i hate when ppl mod the recipe then rate it if thats the case make your own  dish. with that said this recipe is bomb.com my hubby and kids go crazy for these ribs the meat is always falling off the bone good and its real easy to make the only thing id say is you can play around with brands of ingredients but no need to change a thing!

This was very tasty!!! I made a few changes though.  I first used Dijon mustard, second I split soy sauce in half and the other half as Worcester sauce.  Then I used brown sugar as a substitute for molasses and used regular BBQ sauce instead.  I also put in a Tblspoon of smoke flavor.  The last thing I did was grill it at the end as others ha suggested!!!!!

I thought this was tasty, but I agree with the others about it being to much liquid/sauce. I made it over night (setting the alarm to turn off after 5 hrs), and put in the frig in the morning after it cooled down. I later drained the sauce and add some more BBQ sauce on top of the ribs and warmed it in the oven. My BF and I really enjoyed them:)

Mm Mm Mm - would liked the sauce to be thicker but brushed with BBQ sauce and set in oven at 300 for 20 and was fantastic.  Will make this again and again.  Nothing like pork, the other white meat!

Fantastic!  You don't want to stop eating them.  I did add the corn starch, but next time I will cut back the water to make the sauce even thicker.

It was a good recipe.  i took some of the folks advice and took out the water and broth.  
I've also increased the BBQ sauce to a 1/4 sweet BBQ (Bulls Eye or KC Masterpiece) and 1/4 tangy BBQ sauce (el'cheapo Kraft)

I've cooked the ribs for 4 hrs instead of 6 and had to separated the fat using a fat separator (it's one of the things you pour liquid in and when you pour out the liquid only the bottom of liquid comes out.) 
and reduce the liquid in a sauce pan half way.  
Finally I poured the reduction back into the crock pot and cook on high for an hour.   Came out pretty well.

Pretty good ribs! Mine were falling apart after 4.5 hours on high; I threw them under the broiler to brown them--this is a must in my opinion, as they come out of the slow cooker rather pale and uncrispy! I would make these again.

These really were great -- I made them on Father's Day and we were able to eat whenever we wanted to.  I too omitted the water as others have suggested and I also put the whole bottle of Jack Daniels Honey BBQ sauce in not just 1/4 cup.

I cooked the ribs for 5 hours and they were way over cooked.  I also think that the sauce was too thin.  I think the next time that I cook this that I might try what some of the others did to adjust the recipe.

They were good.  The sauce had killer flavor but was too watery.  My husband had to add more BBQ sauce to his and I could not just serve them out of my crock like i normally do.  If I make these again then I'll will reduce the sauce before I serve them.  Overall, really good flavor  just not a great recipe.

GREAT flavor.  But I must admit, the watery oily sauce was a disappointment.  I didn't use any of the extra water -- but it didn't seem to make a difference.  Next time I'll half (or third??) the beef broth in hopes of having a thicker sauce.  Otherwise I loved it.

I was dissapointed in how these turned out.  But, I think it was the cut of meat & the bbq sauce I used.  It was very, very easy & the meat was fall off the bone tender, but, not spicy enough for us & the sauce was too thin.

I have to say the ribs are very tender and fall off the bone.  I did what most of the people here did, and double the liquid.  But I wish there was a way that the sauce was more thick.  Maybe next time we will add some coen starch to the recipe to thicken it up.  But overall the ribs are very good.

Very easy and quite tasty.  I didn't add maple syrup (used more BBQ sauce and water instead) and it was maybe a tad too watery in the end... but still tasted great and was "fall off the bone" done in 5 hours.

These ribs were absolutly fantastic! I followed the recipe exactly and when they were done cooking I put them in a pan and brushed them with a little more BBQ sauce and baked them for a few minutes and they were a hit! My in-laws were totally impressed (YAY) They had such good flavor, this one is definitely a keeper!

Wow, what a terrific recipe.  Served with lemon-peppered fresh green beans and fresh yellow squash and onions.  Even, gave the recipe to a friend.  My daughter said they were better than the ones they eat at Boush Gardens. (Must be good, huh?)

So yummy!  I added more of eveything and definately tasted the sauce and adjusted before adding the ribs and it was perfect.  Because I didn't have any honey mustard, I added honey to dijon mustard and that worked great.

Because I used spareribs instead of babybacks, which are tougher than babybacks, I increased the cooking time to 7 hours. The flavor turned out excellent, but the meat on the ribs were very dry, despite all the liquid. I don't know if this is due to the increased time or to using spareribs. Since I really did like the flavor and using a slow cooker is so convenient, I will try again with babybacks and see how it turns out.

Easy and delicious.  We all enjoyed this meal immensely.  I used 4+ pounds of baby back ribs and replaced the honey mustard with grainy mustard that I had in the fridge.  I omitted the water and added more barbecue sauce.  I had planned to broil them after 5 hours on high, but they didn't need it.  I may play with the ingredients slightly depending what I have on hand.  I may add a bit of hot sauce to give it a little kick next time.  Enjoy!

This was a great recipe.  I used it for pork chops and it was wonderful.  I browned the chops first and then simmered them in a little broth for 40 mins. or so (this makes them more tender), then, I drained some of the liquid and added the sauce to coat. yum yum, we will definitely have again!

The ribs were off the bone--but had no flavor and were mushy--not your typical bbq ribs. Although easy-won't make these again.

After tubing all day, this was the perfect dinner to come home to.  I used country style ribs and had to double the sauce so the ribs were completely coverd by sauce.  I used beef bullion cubes and water instead of beef broth.  I don't think I will ever cook ribs any other way.  DELICIOUS!!!!!!!

These ribs were fantastic and the sauce was great, even over cauliflower!!  We did find the sauce a bit watery, so next time l make these l think l will cut back on water and add more barbecue sauce.  The meat just falls off the bone and is very tender. What a easy recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

These were so yummy!  I loved the sauce.  I used very lean, boneless pork ribs, low-sodium beef broth (a 14.5 oz can), and low-sodium soy sauce.  I only had "sweet" bar-b-q sauce and no honey mustard, so I used a mix of Dijon and spicy brown mustard.  It was great that way, not too sweet like some reviewers mentioned.  Oh, I doubled the bar-b-q sacue and cut the water amount in half.  Great recipe; served with brown rice and broccoli.  It was a pleasure to eat!

I've tried other slow cooker rib recipes & the meat ends up dried out or not tender enough.  These were "falling off the bone" tender.  The sauce, however, was a disappointment.  It was as thin as water!  I like my sauce to stick to my meat, so next time I'll definitely thicken it up before serving, as others have suggested.  But, very tender ribs!

Great recipe.  My husband loved it; he even ate the leftovers cold.  Easy to make and not too sweet.  I broiled the ribs for approx 10 min while I reduced and thickened the sauce. The meat falls off the bone and has a terrific flavor. I can't wait to make this for my teenage sons; they will love these ribs.

Fall off the bone tender ribs.  Nice flavour but if I try this again I think I would add a little more spice.  Ginger and garlic would probably jazz these right up.

I'm not really a "rib person" because there's usually a lot of work for a little bit of meat when you eat them.  This recipe changes that.  There is no work to eating them, since the meat literally does fall off the bone.  I followed the recipe exactly as written, and my family of six found them delicious.  I think ribs will be on the menu more often now......

Very good and super easy to make. After cooking, I poured some barbeque sauce on the ribs and put them under the broiler for 10 minutes so they look more appetizing.

The flavor was really good.  Although I left it to cook in the crock pot on low all day (while I was at work) and it over cooked.  I didn't know that could happen in a crock!  Anyway...10 hours on low yeilds dry pork, so follow the directions! :)

Although this was very well received at fight-night party dinner, I did not care for the sauce at all. Too sweet, not tangy or spicy/salty/peppery enough for me. I won't make it again... although I WILL try for another rib recipe in the crockpot... they were falling off the bone. I also broiled for 15 minutes and drained the grease, so the ribs were not greasy.

Made this with St. Louis style pork ribs, about 4 lbs.  Doubled the sauce.  Excellent recipe- ribs very tender and just fall off the bone.  Will make this again!

I followed the exact recipe but I doubled everything.  Good thing I did because these ribs went fast.  I used the left over honey barbecue sauce and added louisiana hot sauce to it (we like our food a little spicy) and I set it in a bowl on the table to be used as a dipping sauce.  I would definately recommend a bowl of extra sauce on the side.  My brother who is a big rib fan said they were the best ribs he ever had and he asked me when I was going to make them again.

This was the first rib recipe I've ever tried, and I'm done looking! The first time I made this, I used country style spare-ribs, other than that I followed the recipe exactly, and they were WONDERFUL! I made these again last night (I got baby-backs this time), and I added a teaspoon of liquid smoke to the sauce, and took some other people's advice and brushed them with a little bbq sauce and broiled them for 10 minutes. They were the best ribs I've ever had! There were no leftovers, and my husband is begging me to make them again tonight :)

These were so good!!!!  We had a few variations, we used regular mustard, added a little extra honey and we were out of soy sauce so we used Worcestershire sauce - they turned out so yummy!!! More tender than i have ever seen!!!  We added some bbq sauce to the leftovers and had bbq pork sandwiches the next day.  This will definitely be a staple in our house!!

These ribs were amazing! Five hours in the crock pot and then brushed them with lots of Honey Garlic BBQ sauce and broiled them for 10 mins and they were delicious!  Falling off the bone and so tender.

These were very good.  I thought they were a bit too sugary, though.  Next time I think I'll use a different brand of honey mustard.  I used Hellman's brand and think it may have been the culprit....

This recipe is a keeper.  My three boys loved the flavor of honey, barbeque, and maple syrup.  The pork definitely fell off the bones and the meat was really tender.

Fantastic recipe. I've substituted brown sugar for both the maple syrop and honey with great results.  I've also used this recipe to make pork tenderloin and roast beef.

These ribs were very tender and I didn't change anything in the recipe.
The bones fell off the bone while in the pot.
The taste was perfect 
If you have someone that likes to eat the meat off the bone don't cook them as long but otherwise great ribs.

OMG! Made these ribs for dinner last night, and we have a new FAVE recipe of this one!

I changed it just a little by flouring and browning the ribs in a skillet first, then de-glazing the skillet with red wine and reducing this until it's syrupy. I added this to the slow cooker, along with the other liquid ingredients, then the ribs. I also added some bite-size carrot pieces and pearl onions to the slow cooker, and it was all done to perfection in 4.5 hours. We made a roux with butter and flour, and added in a little of the liquid from the crock pot, and whisked it up, before adding the roux to the crock pot to thicken the liquid. A little bit of heaven in a pot, this recipe is!!

Love these!  I subbed the bbq sauce for my favorite bbq sauce, but that was the only change I made.  I pulled them out and popped them on the grill right before serving to get a little char on them, but that's my personal preference.  The meat was just falling off the bone and they were amazing.  About to make again tonight for dinner.  Thanks for the recipe!

These are my summer time go to ribs. First time I cooked them the bone pulled right out before I could even serve them. Now I don’t cook them so long and pull them out before the time. Then I put on the bbq grill for a bit to give them that bbq smell and taste. My friends have no clue they are from the crock pot and I’m not telling them.

I have made this dish twice. The first time I followed the recipe to the letter. Like other reviewers, I found the sauce to be way too thin. The second time, I cooked the ribs in the slow cooker on high for 3.5 hours without the sauce. I made the sauce with all the ingredients minus the beef broth and water and set aside. After 3.5 hours, I put the ribs in an oven safe dish, put the sauce over them and cooked at 350deg for about 40min. They were perfect!!  The flavor of the sauce is awesome!

omgosh!!! delicious!!!  I would give it 10 stars!!!
I did not have maple syrup, but substituted pancake syrup with 1 tsp of maple extract. I did not have honey mustard, nor ingredients to make it, put a tbls of horseradish mustard in. I also put a 1/4 tsp of Cayenne in, but that I could not taste later. I did not have honey barbeque sauce either. ..so used regular...and an extra squirt of honey.  I had about 5#s of ribs, so super simple to use 1/3 c instead of 1/4 c.
I took ribs out of slow cooker, put them in 9 x 13 pan, in 250 oven. i reduced sauce by 2/3s, drizzled on ribs.
 Ribs were fall off the bone. hubby likes em that way, lol. I like a little chew.  but we both agree, these were the best!

This is a winning, and easy, recipe. I made a few changes...added Worcestershire sauce, orange zest, no water and no soy. It wasn't enough liquid to really smother the ribs so I made another 1 cup of honey mustard, honey BBQ, maple syrup and orange zest, stirred it together and added it on top of the ribs. Cooked on slow for 4.5hrs and the meat just fell off the bone. I paired itWe usually order in ribs and

My husband loved these ribs.. They fell off the bone as I took them out of the crockpot.  It is extremely important to have very tender meat since my husband has braces.  The flavor was wonderful. I might add a little smoke flavor in the future just to see what it's like.

This was great! I added 1 1/2 tbls garlic powder. I will omit the water next time and add if needed as it wasn't very thick.

Best tasting honey ribs I have ever made! My husband can't stop talking about delicious they were. Couldn't have been easier to make, shared on Facebook and now all my friends want the recipe. This is a keeper!

My whole family loves this recipe.  You can substitute any good spicy mustard in this also.  To really put it over the top, remove ribs from slow cooker and put the ribs on a foil lined baking sheet and brush on lots of bbq sauce.  Put in the broiler to caramelize the sauce and they are amazing!

Loved the flavors, but the pork just seemed dried out to me.  I prepared it exactly as directed and used a quality cut of baby backs.

Loved this! Made it for my 2.5 year old & myself. It was a hit with my son, who is very picky on what he eats & will only eat a lot of something he likes! I followed some suggestions of broiling after crock pot! Will definitely be making this dish again in the future!

this recipe is great. i used beef ribs instead, and added worchestershire and liquid smoke, as well as a reduction of red wine, garlic powder, brown sugar, black pepper and a bit of water. cooked them low and slow, 200-250 for 5-6 hrs in a covered pyrex dish. the meat melted off the bone!

Very good. I used beef broth instead of water. My problem was that the mixture did not cover my ribs completely so I wound up adding a whole other can of beef broth. The sauce wound up being watered down so the ribs didn't have as much flavor as they should have. Next time I will double the sauce. The ribs were still delicious & the meat was falling off the bone. I served with baked beans &  "Smothered Green Beans" from this site. Will try again but with doubling the sauce. Thanks.

This is a great recipe for ribs.  I like bringing a slow cooker full of these to pot luck dinners.  They sure blow away little smokies and meatballs!!!

I would like to give this 4 1/2 stars (should be an option). Good flavor and certainly easy enough. I did double the honey mustard, honey, honey barbeque sauce, soy sauce and the maple syrup. Eliminated the water. I cooked on low for 8 hours and the meat was very moist and tender. Thanks for the recipe HIMICHAUD!

So good! I used country style ribs because that is what I had on hand, and they turned out great! I used original bbq sauce, because that is what I had on had and then just added a little extra honey. Also, after 4 hrs I turned the crockpot down to low, and they tasted delicious! Thanks for the recipe.

The saucee was very runny, but the flavor was great.  I stuck to the recipe for the most part, but I did double up on the "thickening" ingredients after reading some reviews.  I will cook them on low for 3 hours then high for 3 hours next time I make them

The honey ribs have a great flavor.  The sauce is kind of thin, but it's probably not meant to be thicker after all the cooking.  I've cooked on low all day several times and it's still very tender and tasty.

This was good.  I used country style pork ribs and it actually turned into a pulled pork dish.  We made sandwiches out of it.  I slow cooked it on low for about 11 hours and that was too long because the meat was a little dry even though it made plenty of juice.  Next time I'll cook it on low for about 8 hours.

Good flavor. A bit blander than we normally like, but they certainly were fall-off-the-bone ribs.

The meat was very tender and the sauce was good. I added no water and only half the beef broth. It still did not lack liquid. My husband and fairly picky 5 year old enjoyed it too. In the summer, we would probably slather the ribs with sauce and put them on the grill for a bit. I used boneless country pork ribs. Yum! It is going on our meal rotation.

These were so-so.  The ribs overcooked a little bit in less time than the recipe called for.  I prefer plain BBQ sauce to this recipe.

These were incredible!  I did listen to some of the reviews and I put them in the oven for about 15 min. at 300 degrees and basted them with additional BBQ sauce because the sauce from the crock pot was runny.  My son even left me a note last night on our bulletin board..."GREAT RIBS, MOM."  We will definitely make these again!

They turned out great, they fell off the bone and I had to try and scoop the meat up, but that was my fault they cooked for 10 hrs on low (while I was at work)

I found this recipe to be very bland and the sauce too watery.  I had to add a lot more barbecue sauce than the recipe called for and throw in some garlic and pepper to get more flavor. The extra barbecue also thickened up the sauce a bit.  Once I added the extra seasonings, it was pretty good, but I doubt I will use this recipe again.

This was my first time making these ribs - very easy. The next time I make them, I will marinate the ribs overnight so that they're more flavorful. I'll also add more spice to my marinade.

It was just the right sweetness. The sauce was thin, so I added a bit of cornstarch to the sauce prior to slow cooking.

These came out great! I used 1/4 cup of a sweet and tangy stir fry sauce instead of bbq sauce. Super yummy!

This was good but we really couldn't taste the marinade. It may be because we added BBQ sauce & put it in the oven after we took out of the crock pot as others suggested. I find ribs just as good if you boil them in water before putting them on the grill.

As soon as I bit into my ribs I was in heaven! Sweet and tender.  I added a dash of worchestshire sauce and used country style ribs that actually had no bones in them. This recipe does not have to made with pork ribs.

This is an awesome recipe!  I have never made ribs before, this recipe was so easy and the meat really does "fall off the bone"!  I don't like pork, so I used beef ribs instead and it was really good! Thanks!

These were okay. I substituted brown sugar for honey as one reviewer suggested, but other than that, stuck to the recipe. I think it'd be cheaper/easier to just use BBQ sauce, as these didn't knock us off our feet.
