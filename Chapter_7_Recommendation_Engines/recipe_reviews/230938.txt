We weren't happy that our roast and veggies we cooked was under-seasoned...This dish revived it!!  

We pulled out the original under-seasoned roast and onions and carrots and the juices...added tomato paste and cream, a jalapeno pepper,egg,  garlic (that I roasted), salt and pepper....

then we pulled out the potatoes from the original roast dish and smashed those with butter and the cream and flour and salt and pepper...

Put the roast mixture in the buttered casserole and then topped with the potatoes...Added paprika and chili powder to the top for looks.

Wow....Much better!!!  And saved a very expensive dish from the trash!!

It was just ok. Used leftover top sirloin steak. As the notes suggested, I added some carrots. Maybe it will taste better tomorrow but I just wasn't too jazzed with this recipe. Prep time was pretty fast though. Served with salad, Fabulous French Bread, and Apple Crisp II.

I used mashed cauliflower to make it low carb. It was terrific.
