These are pretty good, my husband really liked the ginger flavor. I adjusted the meat to half ground chicken and half ground pork so it wouldn't dry out. I also reduced the oven temp to 375 and baked for about 20 mins. They didn't have enough salt, so I had to sprinkle some on afterwards. I'll be adding more salt the next time I make them.
