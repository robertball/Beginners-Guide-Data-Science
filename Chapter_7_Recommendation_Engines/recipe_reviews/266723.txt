Wait there's no cream? No milk? No butter?!? Vegan Corn Chowder for the win! This recipe is very forgiving, which is great for adding little changes here and there. I used Earth Balance Vegan Butter to saute my celery and extra garlic. I had vegetable broth on hand, so I used that in place of the water and bouillon. I used red potatoes so at 15 minutes of simmer they were soft. I added 1 can of cream-style corn and 1 can of corn and simmered an extra 10 minutes for deep flavors. I would recommend using a pot next time, because that's why I had to leave one cream corn out. Amazing flavors and would make this again no question!
