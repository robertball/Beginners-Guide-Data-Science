We made this exactly according to the recipe, and let it marinate for 3 hours before sampling. It was pretty good ...nothing spectacular, just good. But then we let it marinate another 24 hours -- and it was truly amazing! Thanks for the recipe!

I made a double batch of the salad and it turned out excellent. However, to inject a little humor, I decided to use frozen corn and didn't know how much frozen corn equaled four ears. Researching the net I found that the average ear of corn contains 511 kernels and each kernel weighs approximately 0.38 grams. Therefore the total weight of the corn would be for four ears, 776 grams or 27 ounces. That's what I used and it worked great.

This was delicious!  I made a couple of changes based on availability, and it still came out well.  I used half the amount of oil just to cut down on the amount of fat, then added 1 tablespoon of water to thin the dressing.  Because making this was a spur of the moment decision, I used one can of Niblets corn instead of fresh.  The white beans I had on hand were cannellini beans (white kidney beans.  Overall, a great side dish.  We'll have it again!

I prepared this for 50 guests this evening and it was a huge hit. No left overs. I'll be making this again. This is an ideal lodge salad.

Delicious!  I made it just as written......and it is marinating now for supper.  I took several bites before putting it in the fridge and loved it.....and I know that it will be even better after a couple of hours!  
Thanks for another great side dish!  Might add tomatoes or avocado next time....I add avocados to everything!

Prepared this for dinner tonight with pulled pork barbeque sandwiches - it was amazing after 3 hours of sitting in the marinade - can't wait to see what it's like by tomorrow night at dinner.  Thanks, Chef John!

Delicious, easy, and flexible.  I didn't have any white beans in the pantry, so made the salad with pinto.  No rice vinegar, used red wine vinegar.  Did everything else according to recipe.  We loved it, and I will definitely make this again.  Thanks!

Very attractive salad. Fresh corn is not yet in season here in New England so I used whatever was trucked in from a warmer climate. I think this will be better when native corn is avaiable in mid July.

This is really very good. I wanted to make it right away, but had no fresh corn. I watched the video and made it just as he showed, except with canned corn. I can't wait to try it with fresh raw corn.

Took this to a party.  Everyone was calling it "cowbow caviar" and dipping their tortilla chips in it.  I liked the dressing of BBQ sauce, vinegar and oil.  Would make again.

Added chopped celery,  and about 1/4 c. chick peas  (not that they were needed- my green onions lacked some green &  husband loves chick peas.) Dressing had just the right amount of sweetness. Family loved it.

I have to admit I was unsure about the dressing, but this was super tasty! I used romano beans instead because they have more visual interest.

This was a very tasty salad.  The idea of uncooked corn was a little weird to me but when everything was mixed (I used Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce which I love) the taste came together fantastically.

Absolutely delicious combination of flavors! Only change I made was use a French vinaigrette dressing instead of rice vinegar as I didn't have any. Also forgot the salt & pepper, but you wouldn't have known!

Not for me, I'm sorry, I just did not enjoy the flavour.
