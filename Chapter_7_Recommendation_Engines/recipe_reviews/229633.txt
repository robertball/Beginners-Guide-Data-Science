Just made this recipe - my husband isn't a huge spinach person HOWEVER he LOVED this too!!!  AND I have cholesterol issues so the greek yogurt was perfect   :-)    I've always thought of creamed spinach as a 'no no' since it usually has so much cheese in it - not so any longer, yeah!!! Easy to make and good for you too - would highly recommend, doesn't get much better than that!  Thanks!

So good and easy! I love spinach, but have a hard time getting my hubby to eat it, but he devoured it! I was skeptical since it didn't have any cheese in it, but it doesn't need it at all! I used fresh spinach and added it with the broth and wilted it for a few minutes. Yum!

Update: This is a normal side for us now. I have added even more flavor by adding 1/2 an onion and garlic. Yum!

Even the pickiest of picky eaters RAVE over this recipe. No one would ever know it's a healthy take on creamed spinach. It's wonderful! TIP! Use fresh spinach - it is way better!

I actually made it using vegetable broth in place of chicken broth and served it tossed with penne pasta. It was a nice change from the usual tomato sauce.

This was really good, I did use 1TBSP of coconut oil instead of the butter and sauteed a sweet onion and garlic before I did the flour. I will be making this again!

The recipe was super easy and quick. However, as written, it is very bland. I added a bit of flavor by including some fresh minced garlic and a bit of cayenne pepper. Overall, I guess it is a good way to dress up frozen spinach but I've definitely had tastier side dishes.

Absolutly delicious!  It is creamy and endulgent without all of the calories.  I only madw one minor modification...I added about 1/8 c of shredded swiss cheese that was leftover from a prior recipie.  The swiss did add a little more fat, but the flavor  was fabulous (and it used up a leftover ingredient ).

My fiancee loved  as well.  We enjoyed it with mini baked potatoes, garden fresh tomatoes, grilled steak, and sauteed mushrooms and onions.  Yum!

I would definitely make this again.

It has a different taste then what we usually expect for creamed spinach. For us the tang of the yogurt didn't work.

Acceptable as a healthier substitute for the usual cream base.  Better for you, for sure, but don't expect it to taste as delicious as the normal kind.

Little bland, needed some roasted garlic and maybe a tad Parmesan cheese. Quick and easy!

Very yummy! It was good the first time, but still pretty rich, even though I used a 1lb bag of spinach. 
The 2nd time around I used organic virgin coconut oil instead of butter, whole wheat flour, and only about a 1/2 cup of Greek yogurt. I also used mushroom broth ("Better than Bouillon" brand, a broth paste you can keep in the fridge). Even my husband, who is a bit grossed out by the texture of spinach, liked this! That's success.
