I soured my milk with a little lemon juice and I used regular granulated sugar because that was all I had. I also don't keep margerine in my house, so I used melted butter. I didn't fold the chocolate chips into the batter, I sprinkled them on top of each portion of pancake batter after I ladled it on the griddle. My kids (and I'll tell you, so did my husband!) loved these pancakes. They didn't need much embelishment, I just added a little butter and honey over the top. HUGE hit. Next time, I'd like to try these with a little ground cinnamon and nutmeg and use Hershey's cinnamon chips. I'll cut back on the baking powder next time as well. NOTE: If I was making them for a breakfast where I was eating, I'd make them even lighter by using applesauce in place of half or even most of the butter and eggs and I'd use two egg whites in place of one of the eggs.

Very good pancakes with a few changes. 2 teaspoons of baking powder is plenty, I also added 1 teaspoon vanilla. I used butter & real sugar but just 2 Tablespoon sugar - probably doesn't need it. Next time I'll substitute applesauce for butter. Great texture and flavor. My kids loved them too.

Very good! I used 2 tablespoons of applesauce in place of half the margerine. I also used a little less baking powder (probably 4 teaspoons or so) as other reviewers said they could taste it. Served with banana maple syrup from this site and it was a great breakfast treat. These did not taste "light" at all.

Lighter CC Pancake Haiku: "Less baking powder! Otherwise these were yummy. Nom, nom, nom pancake." I liked these pancakes, but not quite as much as "Pancakes I", which I think I'd tweak with the "lighter" ingredients of these instead. I used all WW flour, and split the marg. w/ 2 TB applesauce. There's something so, as Homer Simpson would say, "groin-grabbingly transcendent" about melty chocolate chip explosions in the center of a pancake, and these were good, but I think the author of the recipe perhaps meant 2 TSP of b. powder not TB?

I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because the baking powder was a bit much, but my husband can't taste it and he liked it.  The only other change I'd make is to add a tsp of vanilla.

I thought these were pretty good. I changed the servings to 6 with the calculate button and got 5 pancakes. I wanted to try this recipe, to test some white whole wheat flour I bought. I didn't have wheat germ, so I subbed it with an equal amount of quick oats to keep the balance of wet to dry ingredients. For the milk, I used 2%, and for the demera sugar I used regular. It wasn't much anyway. I realized I had only a little over half the amount of chocolate chips suggested and it worked fine. I did use the mini type though. The only downside, is I don't normally cook with pan spray and found it burns quickly, even on medium. So, I did have to rinse the pan after every pancake or 2. Either way, it made a good and filling breakfast. ty

My hubby and I both thought these were very good, and liked that they are a bit healthier than other pancake recipes.  I used 1 cup whole wheat flour and 3/4 of a cup all-purpose flour.  I also used 1/4 cup applesauce in place of the margarine, and used brown sugar instead of demerara, as I didn't have any.  Delicious, a nice light dinner (I'm a BIG fan of breakfast food for supper).

I was excited to try this recipe since I'm always on the lookout for healthier alternatives and I can say this with confidence that my expectations were met to the fullest. They were light and fluffy with the perfect texture. I'm not sure if they'd taste this good without the chocolate chips though. All in all this recipe is a keeper!

It was a hit.  We had to substitiute regular flour for the white whole wheat, butter for margarine. almond milk for regular (due to allergy) and regular sugar.  I used 1 T of baking powder and added an egg.  And - it still turned out good!  :o)

I was looking for a recipe to use white whole wheat flour and tried this minus the chocolate chips. I used just a bit over half the baking powder called for after reading reviews. They tasted very nice and had a nice texture.

I don't usually add change things, but my daughter wanted brown sugar in them.  Did 3 Tbl brown and 1 Tbl white sugar. I added 1/4 c. flaxseed meal for health benefits, did 1/8 c. butter and added 1/4c applesauce.  Applesauce is what started the quest for making pancakes this morning. we left out the choc chips. REALLY good!  my kids love them.  Light and fluffy.  in the past, some recipes I have made are dense and taste very "nutty"  These are WONDERFUL.

I thought these were fantastic. I decreased the baking powder by half, and they rose nicely with no aftertaste. I wasn't sure how I'd like the wheat germ in them, but it was fine. I put some more chocolate chips on top and a little whipped cream, and I didn't even use syrup. (The rest of the family did though.)

These are the best pancakes I have made. The batter spreads and rises nicely making a nice fluffy, and not heavy, pancake.  I added 1 mashed banana, vanilla, and cinnamon for a little extra flavor. Very nice and will make again.

These were yummy and really filling.  I made a few changes.  I only had regular whole wheat flour so I used 1c whole wheat and 3/4c white.  I would try using all whole wheat flour too and see how it turns out.  I decreased the baking powder to 2 tsp per the other reviews.  I used butter instead of margarine.  I used regular white sugar instead of demerara because that is what I had.  I added 1 tsp vanilla extract.  I also sprinkled in a few more chocolate chips at the end, although I don't think that is not totally necessary to do next time.

after the advice of others, i knocked it down to 2 tsp of baking powder.  i also just use 2 cups whole wheat flour bc the original recipe (from the app on my phone) said 1 3/4c ww flour and 1/4 white flour (or all ww flour).  the bf thinks they are the greatest things ever.

Just made them and they were SUPER!!my kids love them, but I made some adjustment base on other 
reviews such as less baking power (2 teaspoon),replace margarine for apple sauce(we never use margarine anyway)and add 1 teaspoon of 
vanilla. It is a keeper!!

I was worried at first to try whole wheat pancakes, but these were so good!  It tasted like eating a chocolate chip cookie.  And the good thing was that we hardly needed to add any sugary syrup on top.  I ate mine plain.  Kids loved them.  And every time I eat them they are so filling.  I am barely hungry when it's time to eat lunch.  Will be making these often.
