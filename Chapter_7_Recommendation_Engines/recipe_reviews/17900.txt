This was so fast and easy.  I just doubled the recipe and threw it in the crock, boy was that an easy meal.  Grilled cheese goes great with this one too.  Thanks for the recipe Karen. DA

The broth was a bit too thick for my tastes, and as a previous reviewer said, the veggies were a bit undercooked.  Tomato Florentine soup is not the same thing as plain Tomato soup and usually I like Tomato Florentine broth a bit thinner and more seasoned.  My husband enjoyed it but I think if I were to make this again I would cut back on some of the tomato ingredients (most likely the paste) and add more chicken stock for flavor and consistency.  I would also recommend adding some of your favorite soup seasonings to spice it up a bit.  Not a bad soup, just nothing amazing.

I cooked this soup and found the whole family loved it. It was easy to prepare and cooked quickly. With vegetables from the garden this was a nice meal, I served soup, salad and sandwiches.

YUM, this is a nice change from Campbells which I have quite often for lunch...and LOVE, (and recently figured out that my littlest guy loves it too!).  Well, I had no Campbells, and was craving grilled cheese w/ tomato soup so here I am.  The baby & I both enjoyed this for lunch today.  It was great, because I usually add pasta to his anyway, (so that it is easier for him to eat) and he didn't seem to notice the veges, so that was a plus as well!  I cut the recipe to 2 servings so I skipped the tomato juice & paste BUT I used 1 can of Rold Gold "thick & rich tomato sauce" (which by the way is REALLY thick so it made up for the juice & paste).  Next time I will leave out the carrots, I wasn't to fond of the taste they brought on.  Good soup, I will use this again for sure!  Thanks Karen!

The tomato paste was too much; it was like a super tomato soup with some veggies.  I did add some basil and oregano to make it edible.

Was not happy with this, seemed odd to add vegetables after the broth and it tasted like it!  Broth was too thick, vegetables not cooked enough even though I added water, seasoning and cooked for much longer than called for in the hopes of a pleasant soup!  I even held off adding the pasta with my former experiences of knowing that pasta breaks down if left to simmer in soup too long.  With complete respect to the receipe submitter, I question the ingredients and the method to this soup!

My family did not like this recipe at all. It didn't have enough seasoning to it. I will never make it again. I had to throw the whole pot out!

Edible but not enough seasonings.  I had to really doctor this one up and still not sure what I put in it. Family did not like it.  Will look for another recipe as this was not the kind of T.Florentine soup I was looking for.

This is delicious! Very hearty and filling. This is now in my regular rotation. Sommetimes I add more veggies, for a heartier soup. I have used frozen spinach, but fresh is so much better. I love it with a ton of fresh black pepper.

I used this recipe as a base. I used my homemade broth and tomatoes (frozen) from my garden. After the veggies and tomatoes simmered, I used my immersion blender. I added a lot of spinach, let it simmer until thick.  I topped my bowl with a generous amount of parmesan cheese. Absolutely delicious!    
Thanks to those previous reviews, I added Italian seasoning and basil.

Amazing, amazing soup!!!  My two year old ate it up faster than he's ever eaten anything!!!  I couldn't believe it. His little brother liked it, too!  The use of tomato paste is genius- it gives the soup a rich,  "tomato soup" flavor which you don't get with the canned tomatoes that soup recipes usually seem to call for. I'll use it in my tomato-ish soups from now on. That being said, I did make modifications (per recommendations in other reviews). I only used about 4-5 oz tomato paste, and even then I used way more broth to get the typical soup broth consistency.  In the end 3 cups beef broth and 4 cups chicken broth. I cooked it in the crockpot to make the veggies nice and soft (adding uncooked pasta about 1 1/2 before finish time). The broth reduced quite a bit. I added basil per another review (1/8 tsp). Used same amount of nutmeg. About 1/4 tsp each salt and pepper. Didn't have squash- about doubled the carrots instead. And only one tsp sugar. Served the soup as the first course while grilled cheese sandwiches for the second cooked in the toaster oven. Delicious and filling pairing!  Definitely bookmarking this recipe for future use!

I gave it a 3, hubby gave it a 5 based on how I made it. Used chicken stock instead of broth, upped broth by 1/2 cup, omitted tomato paste (per other reviewer's suggestions) and spinach (didn't have). I gave a generous shake of nutmeg and salt and added about 1.5 tsp basil.
