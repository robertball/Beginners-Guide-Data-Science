Great starter, but we really like garlic. I mean really like it. We doubled the amount of garlic and still though it could use some more, so we went from 1 to 2 and a half bulbs. We also did half stock and half broth to let the garlic flavor come out a little more. The only other change we made was to blend about 2/3 of the soup in our magic bullet (any blender would do of course).

Excellent soup! Easy too! I took another reviewer's suggestions and upped the garlic. I ended up using 2 heads. I thought the flavor was perfect.  I have never had Spanish Garlic soup before, so I can't comment on how this compares to traditional soup, but this was delicious!  Hubby was raving about it the whole time he was eating it. I was surprised, since he's a total carnivore and there's no meat in this soup! He asked me to make it again, and I will! I sliced the red pepper into thin strips using my mandolin.  I garnished our soup with some thinly sliced jalape√±o (I know, likely not a traditional ingredient), but it gave it a nice bite. This makes the perfect soup when you're feeling a little under the weather. YUM!

I made this soup for my Mom, who was suffering from a bad sinus infection. She loved it. The garlic really mellows after cooking in the stock. The only thing I wish I'd done differently is use chicken broth, rather than stock, as the stock was a bit overpowering. We added arugula from the garden to it...great.

It was a recipe that I wanted to make and upon first hearing of the name my husband said - "nah, I don't think so."   After I read out the ingredients he said sounds good & I went with it.  Now he says "it's a five star."

I l-o-v-e garlic, so I knew this soup would be a hit. I had some matchstick carrots that needed to be used up, so that worked out perfectly. I only had pre-minced garlic, and I didn't add the salt or pepper, but instead a tiny pinch of red pepper flakes. My only complaint? Waiting for it to cool down slightly so I wouldn't burn the you-know-what outta my mouth. Thanks Judy, this is a keeper!

Husband really loves this and it is so perfect as he is on a low salt diet.  I added no salt except what comes in low sodium chicken broth.  I also used broth from boiling shrimp shells, no salt added.  Any broth with a flavor and this is still good.  It amazes me. I make this every two weeks and add onions, green onion, celery and red or green pepper. It just turns into good food.  Calories - is there any?  Amazing, thanks..

Better with each bowl. Tripled the garlic. I've yet to find an amount of garlic that is too much.  Added onions and celery in response to the cook who said there was not enough in it. Otherwise followed the directions. Looked a little too simple but when i tasted it it's definitely a keeper. A good base to add other veggies as well

As a lover of garlic soup (and soup in general) this was quite a tasty starter. I didn't change anything except I used green and red peppers for color. Next time I might add a few pepper flakes for a kick.   I served it with a light penne with more of the peppers and a tomato-parm overlay. It was a hit.

one of the best soups I have ever made.  I put some mushrooms and onions in and added a bit of Worchestershire sauce.  I think you could add all kinds of stuff and it would be great to make a meal.  As the recipe stands it would be a great 1st course

I liked this soup, but I guess I just didn't love it because there wasn't much to it. It is relatively healthy and so quick to make. I might just like more stuff in my soup. This was a lot like only eating flavored broth. Really any vegetable could have been it. I think mushrooms may have been good too. I rounded it off with some heartier foods. Thank you, I did use what I had in the house.

this was quite tasty and healthy (garlic is so good for you)- i added some small pasta near the end of cooking- the ONLY problem was that nobody would come near me the next day- my husband said i smelled horrendous (as did he)- just a warning...

A very good meatless soup. I followed the advice of other reviewers and added 2 bulbs of garlic on account of we are such garlic lovers. I also saw that someone had added celery and so I added a half of cup, and added it along with the carrots. I also added a sprinkle of garlic powder and dried chili flakes. Yum! Never had garlic soup, so had nothing to base it on, except my pleasure. Considering adding some canned garbanzo beans, next time I make it.

I love garlic and appreciated the simplicity of the recipe. But it was a bit overpowering and overall too much quantity for a family of three. If I make again I would probably make a 1/4 batch and use more like a small appetizer as I finish meal prep.

First round I prepared exactly as directed.  Good, but my crew loves garlic.  So . . . I went to work.  I used 3 bulbs of garlic (they were on the small side), used more carrots and in the beginning sauteed a chopped medium onion then added the garlic.  Used homemade stock and broth I had on hand.  And every soup needs some green so I did a rough chop on some Italian flat leaf parsley and also provided a bowl of homemade croutons for those that wanted it.  Fantastic starter!  We eat East Coast or European style where the salad is served after the main course as a cleanser before dessert, fruit and cheese courses.

After reading the reviews, I decided to double the garlic. Other than that, I followed the recipe as stated.  Topped with a few crushed red pepper flakes. This soup is outstanding! My husband brought it to work and made his coworkers green with envy. Will definitely be making this again. Thanks so much for sharing it!

If my family were more adventurous I know I could have spiced it up.  It is a perfect springboard for everyone to make their own version.  By itself it lacks a punch.

Delicious!  I used my bullet instead of fork smashing. Other veggies added: onions, kale, kelp noodles.
