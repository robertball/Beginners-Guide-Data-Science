As far as fresh veggie salads go, this was pretty good. Obviously it could be improved enormously with some cheese/ hot bacon dressing/crumbled bacon etc etc. Thanks!

Pretty good salad.  I changed the white onion to red and served with fresh mozzarella and feta cheeses.  Next time I'll use a pepper of a different color, red, orange, yellow, green instead of just red and green.  I don't think alfalfa sprouts would be a good substitute because they are too small/thin and not as crunchy as bean sprouts.  This recipe is a good base you can change to make your own.

I'm not a big salad eater, but once in a while I'll get a craving for one. Today was one of those days. I had to use alfalfa sprouts since the store I stopped at didn't have bean sprouts, but otherwise I made as written. This is a decent crunchy salad. Thanks.
