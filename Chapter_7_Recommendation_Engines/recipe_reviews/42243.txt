This is one of my favorite recipes. It is a must try. It is so simple and very tasty. This recipe's simple way to prepare and simple ingredients do not fail in taste. Lamb has a taste on its own so it never does need a lot of seasoning. Duck sauce can be found in any grocery store in the asian (chinese foods) foods section.

I also couldn't find adoboe seasoning, so I found a recipe online.  4 cloves garlic 1tsp peppercorns, 1tsp dried oregano, 1tsp salt, 1/2 tsp paprika.  Grind all ingredients in mortor & pestle.

This recipe was so easy to prepare, and it tastes great! My grocery story didn't have plain old duck sauce, so instead I used plum sauce (which said in small print that it was a kind of duck sauce). It was delicious! The sweet flavor really adds something to the lamb, and makes it very tender. 

I also found that it was a good dish to make for dinner guests because you can leave it in the oven on warm even past the cooking time without the lamb being dried out.

I love this recipe--it's easy and delicious! I am a beginner cook and had never made lamb before, so I didn't expect much for my first try.  However, these came out wonderfully well and I felt like a "real" cook.  :)

Very nice change from the usual mint sauce.  I would caution you to reduce the heat after you remove the chops before you add the shallots and vinagre and yes...the reduction does take more like 10 - 15 mins as other reviewers have said.  Great flavor overall!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  It was so easy to make and I had everything on hand.  The chops  came out so tender and the flavor was well-liked by the whole family.  I could hardly get two words out of anyone at dinner.  I think I'll try this on  ribs next time.  Way to go Khadija.  Thanks!

Absolutely wonderful!  This dish was also so easy to make that it would be perfect for company too since the preparation and attention to cooking are so minimal.  Thank you for helping me cook lamb chops for the first time and making it such an easy process!

This recipe was pretty good.  I did like the overall flavour but my boyfriend gave it 3.5 stars as he prefers my mothers recipe better.  I did find the sauce to be rather greasy.  I would make this again but will drain the baking dish prior ro adding the duck sauce.

There's no such thing here as duck sauce, but I read that it is really plum sauce, so I used that instead.  It was really good, recommended.

Unbelievable. My girlfriend said it's the best thing I've ever made her. Really easy too. The ingredients are cheap so you can splurge on the quality of lamb chop.

Made this last night and my husband and I loved it.  I added a lot more duck sauce (about another cup) since we tend to like lots of flavor.  I found the duck sauce in the Asian section at Vons. Also, didn't have the seasoning so just added some oregano, basil and rosemary and that served just as well.  Very easy and oh so delicious!  Definitely a keeper!

Our favorite recipe! One substitution we make is using hoisin sauce instead of duck sauce.

Excellent recipe.  Followed the directions exactly, except that I couldn't find adobo spice in my small town.  So I bought an inexpensive can of chiplotle peppers in adobo sauce and used 1tsp of the sauce.  Very, very good recipe.

This was a great recipe. Very flavorful. I substituted red hot for cayenne pepper and used hoisin sauce for the duck sauce.

What a wonderful recipe!  i've made this twice since I've found it -both times my dinner guests raved about the dish. i couldn't find adobo seasoning in my local grocery store, so I used some of the ingredients found in the mexican seasoning - mexican oregano, cumin, and powdered garlic.  easy, easy recipe and oh-so-good!

I cooked for the one hour and then 15 minutes baking using rib chops and it was to well done for me. I used saucy susan since the ingredients were the same as duck sauce. I didn't like the combo with lamb but my husband liked it alot.

This smelled wonderful as it cooked and didn't disappoint when served.  I made my own adobo seasoning mix and reduced the amount of salt, but kept all the other ingredients as listed.  I was using loin chops about 1.5 inches thick so I felt the cooking time was too long.  I took mine out after 30 minutes added the duck sauce and continued for about 10 more minutes for a total of 40 minutes.  We will absolutely have these again.

I like my lamb chops med-rare so these were over-cooked for me. I prefer mint jelly as my sweetness with the chops to duck sauce, but the recipe seemed interesting so I thought I would try it. Mint jelly is still my preference with med-rare lamb.

Picked up a bottle of plum sauce and decided to try it on lamb.   This recipe was closest to what I was looking for,  and I kept everything the same with the exception of substituting duck sauce with  plum sauce.   I used two lamb steaks that were just under 1 pound each,  and added time sauce after about 40 minutes in the oven.   The steaks were well done by one hour total,  and turned out wonderful!

My son thought we were having pork chops until he saw how small the chops were. I like the recipe but the timing is a bit off or maybe my chops were too small. For 2 people I bought just over a pound of 1 inch thick chops. I went to check the temp at the half hour mark and they were 180 degrees already. I put the plum sauce on at that time and cooked for another 20 minutes at 175. Otherwise the recipe is great and I will adjust the timing next time.
