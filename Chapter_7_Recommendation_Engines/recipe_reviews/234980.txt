Loved this!  The bacon flavor makes the dish.  I used frozen veggies and subbed a little onion powder for the green onions but I'm sure it would be even better with the green onions, I just didn't have any on hand.  I've also made this with chicken thighs instead of pork chops, peas instead of green beans, and an extra egg.  Very versatile recipe, great any number of ways!

I made this last night and covered it with foil.  This morning I  put it in the Delay start oven.  It was already to eat when we got home from church.   I however did not have green beans so I put in extra corn.  As you can see by the photo everyone liked it.   It is definitely a make again meal.

Wonderful! Definitely gave me good direction. The changes I made were that used peas and carrots instead of green beans and corn, thin steak (as I didnâ€™t have any pork chops) and seasoned it with garlic and ginger, and lastly I just added hoisen sauce and I dab of sesame oil. Thank you so much for the guidance!

I used peas instead of corn, but either one will be great, because the fried rice can stand on its own.  It was delicious and I will be making this again, and again.

The scale on the amount of meats to veggies is off in my opinion and baking it with fresh rice makes it mushy.
