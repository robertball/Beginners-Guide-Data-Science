Excellent! I made this recipe just yesterday for a baby shower.  Everyone was delighted to have something hot, as our temps have dropped.  My variation was that I used decaf hazelnut coffee, 2X the strength as normal.  Instead of coffee ice cream, I used chocolate.  Everyone talked about how good it was!

I made this for a small group of 12 (doubling the recipe). It was extremely good and we all enjoyed a nice warm after dinner drink.

This was delicious! I have tried other coffee punches that I didn't care much for. I used the calculate button to change it from 4 to 1 serving just, for myself. I made a lite version: I used 1/2 fat French vanilla ice cream, Silk nog (non dairy eggnog) along with a caffeine free coffee, and lite whipped cream spray. I forgot to add the nutmeg. I tried it the next time with nutmeg and it was much better without it. I used room temperature instead of hot coffee. I mixed the coffee and cold eggnog and then put the ice cream on top and whipped cream. Coffee punch should be cold in my opinion! Thank you, I will make this every winter and plan another drink this week.

This was pretty good; I thought there was too much eggnog and ice cream flavor rather than coffee flavor.  If I make it again I will either make the coffee stronger or just use a higher proportion. As is this is VERY thick and sweet. I used pumpkin spice eggnog and liked the kick it gave. There's lots of flavored eggnogs out there that might be fun to experiment with.

I didn't care for it - too decadent & thick-tasting.

TOO SWEET!  and the coffee flavor was just BARLEY there! I feel like this recipe could be a hit in my home, but only if the measurements are WAY different!
