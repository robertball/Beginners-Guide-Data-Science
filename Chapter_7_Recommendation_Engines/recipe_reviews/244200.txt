I love to make these! My mother was from Poland and she used sweet pickle instead...both have a great flavor. I also like the way you use the whole piece of meat and roll up.  I would cut it up into 3 pieces and makes smaller rollups which is so much work. and I use toothpicks..my mother also made a saltine cracker stuffing (crushed crackers, chopped onions, 1 egg, Kellogg's corn flake crumbs, and milk) rollup along with the pickle ones. Thanks for posting and the idea of rolling up in one piece!

Yeeeeesssssss!  This is hands down my favorite recipe from Chef John.  I was a little nervous about the pickle so I only used half and could have kicked myself for not adding it all.  The entire family said it was great.

I have been making this my whole life!  I as surprised to see almost the exact re pie as I always use.  Having a very large family, 6 children and 14 grandchildren, I have to make a lot.  Therefore I brown them and put them in the oven for an hour and half at 350.  I serve with spaetzle and red cabbage.  Delist!  Right on Chef John.??

My parents lived in Germany when I was a kid so I grew up on this.  The only differences in how we make it are:  1) After browning the rolls, we place in a 350 oven for 1 hour.  2) To make gravy, we add baked drippings with mixed flour/water until it thickens, stirring constantly.  I also don't believe we've ever used paprika.  So good!  I also frequently make some with chicken for non-beef eaters.  It is almost impossible to get it thin enough, but the flavor is on point!

Wow what a fantastic recipe! Simple and delicious! I was cooking for a small army (our 6 children plus a friend or 2) so I did modify the cooking method.  I followed the recipe exactly right up to the point where you would return the rolls to the pan with the gravy to simmer on the stove until done. Since I was cooking 8 fairly large rolls I put them in a roaster, poured the gravy over them (I made enough to cover them almost completely), covered the roster with foil, and baked at 350 degrees for 90 minutes. When they were done I skimmed the grease (there was a lot), put the gravy back in the pan I browned them in, and thickened it with a little slurry of flour and beef broth. The ONLY thing I might change next time is maybe going with thinner dill spears our cutting it down to 2 per roll. I will without a doubt be making this again!

I made this for the first time this afternoon.  It was fabulous.  We made the Rouladin exactly as the recipe instructs but substituted one cup of red wine for one cup of the beef broth.  We will be making this again.

Followed the recipe exactly. A bite putzy but absolutely worth it. A good rich beef gravy is a must. Used a choice bottom round steak that I cut down to 1/4 inch thickness then pounded to 1/8-1/16 thickness.

I made a dozen of these ahead of time then baked covered with foil for two hours at 350! I added a half sliced onion to the gravy mixture as it baked.

Loved it as is! Also watched the video, which isn't really vital, but there were a few pointers which I can use elsewhere,too.

My German husband thought his grandmas was loose in the kitchen again.

We love, love, love this recipe!  I only use one large pickle spear instead of the 3 in the recipe.  Otherwise, no changes. Great flavors and very simple.

I made this last night. I was interested to see what the final flavor was going to taste like, considering its unique combination of ingredients. I made it exactly as presented and we were pleased. Thanks for the recipe.

I lived in Germany for 4 years back in the 90s.  One of my favorite things to order out was beef rouladen.  This is GOOD!  I was able to find a package of two round steaks (8 oz each) that were about 1/2 inch thick.  I pounded them out to 1/4 inch and followed the recipe pretty closely.  For some reason, my rolls looked alot bigger than Chef John's in his video.  I wound up cooking them in the gravy for about 2 hours and 15 minutes and they were great. I followed the suggestion to serve with mashed potatos.  I also braised some purple cabbage with butter and a little balsamic.  Thanks for another great recipe!!

GOOD  I always like the idea of these. We still enjoy. The
cooking time is always the issue. They dry quickly. One minute the knife clearly doesn't insert easily the next it does but now may be  dry.  Watch small ones with larger ones, they will dry
sooner. Sample one now and again to be sure. But I always  like them.

I used one large round steak and pounded thin. It was much easier than working with smaller pieces of meat.  I then sliced on an angle.  I also trimmed the fat off the ends of the bacon.  Next time I will use center cut bacon which is leaner.

Sounds exactly like what my mother and grandmother made, minus the dill pickles. Thanks for the post, the cooking times are helpful. I used Cabernet to deglaze the pan to add to the flavor of the gravy.

2.9.20  I’m so lucky because I have an Hispanic supermarket nearby that sells the beef exactly as called for in the recipe.  Almost perfectly 1/4 inch thick, and it made assembling and rolling the beef very easy.  I tasted the gravy before the beef went back into the pot for its 90 minutes cooking, and thought the flavor was a bit weak.  I did add a bit of Better Than Bouillon® Roasted Reef Base, and that really kicked up the flavor.  The gravy got even better once the rouladen started releasing its beefy flavor, along with the bacon.  Gravy is IMPORTANT in this recipe, and I was extremely happy with the way it turned out.  The only change I will make in the future is reducing the pickles back to two pieces which is personal taste.  I planned this to finish a couple hours before dinner, so I just put it into the Instant Pot® and used the slow cook function on low.  The rouladen were so very moist and tender that you just about could cut it with a fork.  Simply put, we loved this recipe, and although it does take some time to cook, it’s really very easy to make.  Good meal today served with mashed potatoes, red cabbage, and cooked apples.

This is a great Sunday meal. The gravy on roasted potatoes was delicious. The rouladen plated nicely   and not a lot of work. Did all the prep work in the morning and then let it cook while I prepared the rest of the dinner.  Meat was tastey and tender.

It was very tasty. I did one with onions rather than pickle.  When browning everything I used a stainless pan. I would use cast iron the next time. Gravy was very rich and delicious.

I previously made beef rouladen  using another recipe and toothpicks and it was a MESS!  Chef John  hit it out of the park on this one.  The video was very helpful on the construction and the string tying  held those rolls together perfectly.  My boyfriend who loves all things German was practically moaning in ecstasy when he ate these!  You rock Chef John!!!!!

OMG!  The best meal my wife and I have made in years.  The flavor was stupendous, the gravy was to die for.  We used flank steak.  We made potato dumplings on the side and found the recipe on Omas (Grandma) cooking .  This is now a holiday recipe.  Thank you Chef John.  I like your humor, too.

Very good recipe. I made it as written and my husband and I enjoyed it very much. It's very similar to an Italian beef braciole I make but with different ingredients inside.

Simple to make and great ro eat. These rolls pack a protein punch. I make them with parmesan-roasted potatoes (on this site).  I left off the pickle. It's a good dinner that sticks with you.

The meat is so flavorful and it melts in your mouth! 
The flavors are so complex, I didn't expect it to go over with my youngest son (who has rather simple taste) but he loved it!

This looks like a very good recipe I'll have to try. The last time I had Rouladen was in Potsdam and it was amazing! My German mother never made that for some reason.

This recipe is terrific. I used precooked bacon because that was all I had. I also subbed smoked paprika. They came out just perfect with Chef John's directions. Thanks for another winning recipe, Chef John.

A tad time consuming with all the steps of preparing and rolling the Rouladen, but expected. I did find thinly sliced beef round roast (label for making Carne Asada) The slices were large enough to make the rolls. Followed recipe to the 'T' only used toothpicks to hold rolls together as did not have cooking twine. This was served with Uli's Apple Red Cabbage and Chef John's Spatzel along with smashed potatoes. It was a wonderful German meal my hubby and I both enjoyed immensely!

Rave reviews from all of our guests! The guest I actually made this for is from Nuremberg, Germany. She claimed it was just like her grandmother's. Sides were spaetzel and red cabbage with apples.

Great recipe!  It is five stars as written. I like to use German mittlesharf (medium) mustard and German cornichon dill pickles. Both are available at Aldi’s. I also add shredded carrots in my filling, because that’s the way my Mom makes it.

I made this and thought it was ok but won’t make again.  There are dishes that I prefer.  The reviews were very good and for my taste didn’t live up to expectations.  I try numerous recipes and I know that I am very persnickety.  It’s very difficult for me to find a recipe that I think is over the top and one I would like to serve to guests.  That said I think you can probably rely more or other reviews.??

I love these and have been making them for decades. My ex-wife is German and her dad was an old-world German butcher. Her mom taught me her version, which is very much like yours, but includes a couple of blanched carrot wedges in each roll. Having been a chef from NYC/Long Island, NY, I like to play with my food. Some of the things I do differently is to ‘par-cook the bacon between two sheet pans lined with parchment; under and over the bacon. Regular bacon can be used in place of pancetta if boiled first, to remove the unwanted flavors. Instead of butter, for my roux, I use bacon grease. It makes a difference.

I was leery of the unusual ingredients but am so glad I tried it.  Delicious gravy.  Followed recipe exactly but used smaller cuts of meat which worked out great.  Served over leftover jasmine rice with the gravy.  I will make again.

I made this for the first time. It turn out very well. I didn’t have beef broth but use the beef bullion with 3 cups of water. It didn’t have that dark brown color that I hope for but it was good. This is a keeper. I also made German purple cabbage that I also got the recipe from this site. I Served on top of spatzle. So good!!!

Simple and delicious! I took the advice of others and baked it n the oven using my Dutch oven - I didn't want to have to babysit it. (Instead DH & I went for a walk!) I added next to no salt to the meat and the whole thing (rolls & gravy) was too salty so I'll eliminate all added salt next time.

Made exactly as written and hands down the best rouladen ever.  It is now a staple in our house and this year our grandchildren requested a German meal for Christmas, and this will be my contribution.

Great Rouladen recipe.  I doubled the recipe and used Better Than Bouillon.  Cooked bacon first but not crispy.  Like my gravy  a little less thick so less flour.  Cooking time was 2hrs in electric skillet on simmer turning every 20min.     
Do not add salt!   One can over salt Rouladen very easy.

Meat was so tough I had to throw my serving out.  DH plowed through his because he was hungry enough to eat tough steak. I won't repeat this one which is really unfortunate because the gravy was to die for!  The braised cabbage was a new idea for me and we enjoyed that a lot so it was not a total loss but a lot of work for too-tough to eat steak.

thought i'd try it with the pickle inside, it was very good. my family didn't use that, but used yellow mustard, diced onion, diced bacon, and instant rice.  think i'll ultimately stick with the pickles on the side though.  rouladen makes the best gravy i've ever had.

I made 4 pieces and used regular mustard instead of Dijon. The recipe turned out fairly well. Everyone seemed to like it. I found the gravy that is made with this recipe a bit salty. I used 4 cups of beef broth instead of the recommended.  I would make this again with a couple tweaks.

Family really liked it. I made this a month ago and am doing it again tonight. Was really easy with pre-cut beef round. I did use a dutch oven for the last part instead of cooking on the range. That worked out pretty good.

I doubled the number of rolls, but did not double the sauce and it was plenty. The only change I made was to use Turkey bacon as this was what I had on hand and it turned out great and probably a bit more healthy! I also used sweet pickle in one roll just to try it and it was amazing as well!!

Made it as per recipe and it turned out great. The flavors of the meat and gravy were fantastic. The only thing I would change is the number of servings because there were no left overs  for later.

I liked this. My moms friend was from Germany and used to make this for us as kids. Hers was definitely better. However, my husband was really into it. I would skip the bacon next time as rubbery non crispy bacon just isn't my bag. Overall, it was tender with a nice flavor and the gravy was quite good! This is a good Sunday evening venture.

i have been making this for years  Thanks for giving me some good new tips!  Another variation that my sister-in-law makes (her Mom as a German cook for wealthy families) is to just use bacon, chopped onions, and sprinkle dill over it.  That's it.  I'm not sure how I like it better so I usually do a few each way with each batch I make.  Can't wait to go make it now with your new tips!

Wunderbar!  I loved Rouladen in Germany and have missed it since I left.  Serve it with some oven roasted potatoes or even Gnocchi.  German comfort food at its best.  The recipe was easy to follow.  I do recommend string over toothpicks.  It keeps the rolls together better.  Guten Apetit.
