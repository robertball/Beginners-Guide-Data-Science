I had the same problem with my Merengues not fluffing up until my mom (!) told me that letting the eggs warm up to room temperature (or close to it) makes all the difference.  It works!

I just tried making this recipe (with a few revisions to suit what I had on hand) and I also had the problem of the whites not stiffening up. I looked it up in an old family Betty Crocker cookbook- make sure the egg whites are at room temperature before starting. I used mine right out of the fridge, so I'm going to let it warm a bit and see if they'll whip up better.

I have yet to make this but I am curious as to when you cut the star shapes.  Do you roll it out and cut it obviously before baking?  TIA

I have made this recipe for years, before seeing this exact recipe.  Everyone LOVES these cookies and asks me to make them year after year for Christmas.  I do not do the meringue on top... My recipe calls to chill the batter overnight, then use as much confectioners sugar as necessary to roll out the sticky merigue batter and cut the star shapes... so the sugar mixes making a stiffer dough. It is very sticky and messy, you will think there is no way to roll out and cut shapes, add more confectioners sugar and work it in.  Bake star shape exact same, you could top with the meringue before baking, I leave plain, they are very sweet.  As I said EVERYONE LOVES them. The do crack easily though.

So I made these for my cooking class when we did Germany and my teacher was in awe. He couldn't believe that their was no flower or baking soda or anything in them besides the few ingredients. Thanks so much for the amazing recipe!!

My comment is "I don't know what I have done wrong".  The egg white never whips into stiff form. It is just liquid.  I cannot put it onto the baking sheet b/c it is all liquid like milk. I whipped that eggwhite for over 10 mins and my ears almost fell off (the electric blender was too loud) but it was still like egg white. I bet it will taste good if I can bake it because the mixture taste good.

I have always been terrified by meringue's and swore I would never even attempt them but I couldn't bring myself to throw away spare egg whites so I thought I'd give this a go and I was amazed at how easy it was and so yummy! I can't wait to make another batch, this is definitely going on my list of gluten free sweet treats.

The group I made these for absolutely loved them. I thought they needed to be sweeter, and there was something about the texture that just did not appeal to me. I would make these again if requested, or pass on the recipe, but I myself was not too keen on them. (It's also a very expensive recipe to make with the high cost of almonds!)

In german these are called Nuss Stangel..these are also made with hazelnuts.  My grandmother  added the zest to the nut mixture instead of the meringe and a bit of lemon juice (no cinnamon) to the meringe for a more lemony taste. They are my favorite xmas cookies.

KC Star - Heat oven to 200.  Line 10x15 baking sheet with parchment paper.  Whisk 1 cup egg whites for 1-2 minutes with electric mixer to form soft peaks.  With mixer running add 1 cup granulated ugar in 3 parts waiting 20 seconds between addition.  Using a rubber spatula, fold in 1 cup confectioner's sugar and 1/2 tsp. salt.  Fold in 1 cup toasted sliced almonds.  Using slotted spoon scoop out large oval shaped mounds of meringue and place on backng sheet.  Sprinkle meringue with remaining almonds.  Bake 2 hours.  Turn off oven.  Leave clouds to dry overnight in the oven.  Remove clouds and store in an airtight container up to 23 days.  It is best to make these on a dry not a humid day.

The lemon zest makes this recipe so I doubled it the second time that I made them.  I omitted the cinnamon as an other reviewer suggested.   In stead of dropping by spoonful, I used my spritz gun.   I sprinkled the unbaked cookies with yellow sugar and baked 8 minutes since the cookies were thin.   Then drizzled with melted chocolate and sprinkled with chopped almonds!  Yum!   Important:  do not over bake!   Nothing worse that burnt meringue.

Yes this is traditional German cookie and we called them Zimmstern (Cinnamon Stars)  They are light and delicious and the combination of almond and citrus taste is nice. Nice texture contrast as the meringue is crunchy and the cookie is a little chewy.

Be sure to allow egg whites to be at room temperature. After I beat them for 3 minutes and peaks formed, I slowly add the sugar. I only used 2 ounces of almonds. The taste was lovely - definitely a new favorite for me.

Followed the recipe exactly. Not sure where I went wrong but no one, including myself, thought they were very tasty.

Sorry but the taste and texture of these cookies were not worth the price of the ingredients. Not one of the kids cared for these either and they'll usually eat anything sweet. I made them exactly as written.
