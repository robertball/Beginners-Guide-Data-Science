Excellent! - I skipped the "loaf" part - just made up the spread.  Then prepared it two slightly different "open faced" ways for a meal (eliminating about 150 calories per serving by skipping the French bread AND the second slice.)  First, I used a thick piece of Texas garlic toast, topped it with a nice layer of shrimp and crab spread, wrapped it in tinfoil and baked as directed.  Darn good.  For the next day's lunch, I just put the seafood spread on a regular slice of toast, put paprika and pepper and parmesan on top, then put it under the broiler.  Also darn good!  Thanks for a great recipe, ME WYNTR, and thanks to a national drugstore chain for having the canned crabmeat and shrimp on special this week!

I loved this quick and easy sandwich melt. Very, very good. I went with swiss cheese over mozza and split ciabatta buns, baking them open face for about 15 minutes in the oven. I also grated a bit of fresh parmesan over top before putting them in the oven. I think next time I would chop up a generous amount of fresh parsley to add to the spread for the added boost of flavor and color.

Yum! This was good cold, but even better slathered on a crusty roll and broiled for a few minutes until brown and bubbly. Either way it was super simple and delicious! Thanks for sharing. :)

This was awsome! I found 7 oz. packages of crabmeat and shrimp at WalMart, so that made it that much easier. Instead of salt and pepper, I used "Slap 'yo Mama" cajun seasoning and baked them open-faced for about 15 min. on 350 degrees. This is a great summer time meal.

Instead of salt I used old bay and pepper.  The family enjoyed this heated.

Update. I made this recipe again but used steak rolls instead of french bread. It was much better on less bread! Less dry too.

I made this as a hot dip and served with some melba toast and it was a huge hit.  I plan to make this again as an actual loaf.

Pretty tasty and easy to make.  The canned seafood makes it a little pricy.

Yum! I didn't include the celery, as we're not fans of it. Instead of French bread, I used wheat Bolillio rolls from Wal-mart. Definitely a keeper! I could see using this as an appetizer - just cutting the sandwiches smaller.

5* with the following changes:
- substituted celery for water chestnuts
-used fresh tiger shrimp
-used a combination of mozzarella, provolone cheddar & parmesan and used 12oz instead of 8oz
-I baked it by itself and then served it at a get together with toasted herbed focaccia 

I am not a fan of canned anything and find fresh makes a huge difference

Delicious! Only change was to substitute part of the mozzarella for Parmesan. I used rectangular ciabatta that I split in half, coated each side with the seafood salad and broiled for 5 minutes, but a little longer would've given it more colour.
