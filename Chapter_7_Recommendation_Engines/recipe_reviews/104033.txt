I thought these were okay. My biggest issue was they are called a cookie, but they are much more like little soft cakes. The other thing is, they are so sweet. The splenda taste lingers on the taste buds, which I didn't really like. I made a half recipe and got thirty two cookies using a cookie scoop. Some reviewers mentioned the lack of spread, so I flattened them gently. That helped some. For the raisins, I subbed half the amount of mini chocolate chips. I also added one and a half teaspoons of pumpkin spice, to up the pumpkin flavor, which I thought they really needed.

These cookies turned out great.  I used plain a cup of white sugar and a cup of brown sugar instead of the splenda.  I only had large oats and the cookies turned out soft and moist. Yummy.  It's a keeper.

These cookies were just what I was looking for.  I made changes to make them healthier.  I used 1/2 c applesauce and 1/2 c yogurt per another reviewer instead of the butter.  I used half AP flour and half whole wheat flour.  I used 1/2 C organic brown sugar and 1/4 c honey instead of splenda.  I love the combination of pumpkin with oats and raisins.

We loved this cookie and it is versatile when it comes to mix in's. I omitted the raisens and nuts and used craisens and white chocolate chips and they were great! The cookie DOES NOT spread out and it is soft and cake like. It is full of pumpkin flavor and a great cookie.

This is a very good cookie! I love that these cookies are so light and soft. And I love the bright pumpkin color and flavor! I made them as written except I didn't use the walnuts or raisins because I wanted the pumpkin to shine through and it did! I also decreased the sugar slightly by only using 1/4 cup of the white sugar blend. But I used the full amount of the brown sugar blend. I added 1/2 tsp. allspice and I'm glad I did because it was perfect in this! As other reviewers have stated, these cookies don't spread out much but they puff up slightly. A very good cookie that tastes great warm or cold. Perfect with a cup of tea! Thank you Splenda!

We REALLY enjoyed these!  Soft, cakey, sweet, and full of pumpkin flavor.  They don't spread at all as they bake.  I added nutmeg, cloves, ginger, and allspice to the dry ingredients.  I also subbed pecans for walnuts.  Great!

My husband liked these cookies!  I had no butter on hand, so I substituted 1/2 c. vanilla yogurt and 1/2 c. applesauce.  I added 1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice because we like the flavors.  Will make these again!

Great cookie for fall. Did not use Splenda but still great. Didn't have walnuts and used pecans instead. Daughter loves them and they are pretty healthy for a cookie.

This recipe is amazing. I used Smart Balance margarine, regular brown sugar, about 1/4 cup of nuts and 1/2 cup of cranberries (instead of raisins). They disappeared in no time flat! I took them to my 14 year old son's soccer practice and the boys devoured them - several wanted seconds, and some wanted the recipe. I figured that's pretty high praise for a pumpkin cookie recipe with nuts and fruit in it! The light, cakey texture is perfect, and it definitely has JUST the right amount of sweetness without being overly sweet. I will use this one again and again. Yumm!!

Love these cookies.  Love how soft they were.  I used chopped pecans and golden raisins since that is what I had on hand.  I also didn't have quite enough pumpkin (I've been cooking with pumpkin a lot and didn't realize I was so low!) so I had to use about half a cup of applesauce to replace it.  They were excellent - however I have a feeling that I will enjoy them even more with all pumpkin!

Perfect, didnâ€™t have stevia brown so used the regular brown sugar. I also added a few pinches of ground cloves and nutmeg. Family loves them! Will definitely be making again.

Very tasty but tended to be a little dry. I put them in a sealed container with slice of soft bread and that helped. Plan to cook them less than the recommended time when I make them next time.

Changes I made: used regular sugar and brown sugar, added cardamom, nutmeg, ginger, cinnamon, and cloves, and also added a box of instant butterscotch pudding mix. 
Makes a LOT of cookies that don't spread much at all. I doubled the recipe because I was baking for an event and ended up with over 6 dozen.

I added raw pumpkin seeds 1/2 cup to recipe and used coconut palm sugar instead of brown sugar. I loved the recipe very good. It would have been better if I used brown sugar but I had this on hand.

I was looking for a healthy fall cookie. These hit the spot. They aren't too addicting, which is my problem when chocolate is involved. Would definitely make again.

Loved these.  Although I changed one ingredient, I feel that the original would have been equally as good.  I happened to have Maple Pumpkin Butter which I substituted for the pumpkin, adding a smidge more oats and flour.  I can't wait to bring some of these to my pumpkin lovin' grandkids

These came out soft, moist and very good! I left the 1/2  cup of Splenda brown sugar blend out because I did not have it on hand and they came out wonderful and not too sweet. These would be great with coffee in the morning:=)

Soft, outstanding cookies! They were too sweet, so the second time I left out the 1/2 c splenda sugar blend, and they were perfect with just the splenda brown sugar blend (also less sugar for diabetics). It is a nice big batch, and they freeze really well and are great warm. Frozen to warm took 12 seconds in my microwave, easy quick snack!

My husband (who prefers to think of himself as non-diabetic and would load up on Ben and Jerry's Ice Cream if he could), likes these cookies - so that's saying a lot!  I've made them several times and no one knows they are "healthy" cookies.  To address our cholesterol concerns, I used whole wheat flour instead of the white, and instead of a cup of butter, I used half a cup of Canola oil and 1/2 cup of Smart Balance Light (which is what we started using years ago instead of butter).  The Smart Balance adds Omega 3s to our daily nutritional intake, which is all for the good.

This is a great recipe, the cookies come out very moist and cakey. Similarly to traditional pumpkin cookie recipes. I added extra cinnamon but I think next time it might be a good idea to just add in pumpkin pie spice to get the nutmeg-y flavor going also. ^__^

This recipe is prety good for pumpkin cookies... which in them selves are pretty random and not common. I really thought for my first time making pumpkin cookies that this was an awesome recipe to use!
