I used this as 1 layer in a 7 layer taco dip & was able to combine 4 layers into 1 (not that it mattered).  I added garlic, & a bit of cayenne.  This is just your basic (diced) guac with olives.

I love this dish.  I like to use lime instead of lemon, and if you add diced cucumbers it is very refreshing and adds a little crunch.  I also like to add cilantro and garlic.  This is a great base recipe.  I serve it sometimes instead of side salad just to mix things up a little :)

To Veronica S.    This is definitely NOT guacamole.. It is what it says....   Avocado Delight....  With guacamole you smash the avocado and add red onions and don't need green chiles or black olives.......  You DO need tomatoes, garlic and lime juice, however....

I liked this however had to change it up a bit for more flavor, less liquid. I used 3-4 plum tomatoes, 3 avocados, 1 can pimento, 2 fresh jalopeno peppers, 1/3 cucumber, 2 shallots, 2 large cloves garlic,  cilantro seeds, and 3 tbsp olive oil.  It made a huge batch that I could enjoy for 3 days on top of nan bread, or in a wrap or with some healthy crackers.  I make this all the time now as anything with avocados is a charge of antioxidants, great saturated fats, and a wealth of additional nutrients.

Good, but not great.  I put it on Mexican rice tacos and I chopped the tomatoes and avocado into nice and meaty pieces.

I used 1/2 a lemon because mine was pretty big and all any of us could taste is lemon. Next time I would definetly omit the lemon. I added some cilantro to it for extra flavor. Without the lemon it would be good.

This recipe is terrific in the summer, very fresh tasting.  Didn't have chopped chilis or olives so i used a food chopper/processor and it worked great.  Had rave reviews from all who ate it and even with doubling the recipe there were no leftovers.  Thanks!!

Simple and good, but also a little plain.  Followed other reviewers recommendations and added some garlic and cilantro, and did lime instead of lemon.

Very good! I scaled it down using one avocado, but added the other ingredients according to my own preference. Adding a whole can of green chilies would not work for me. I also used lime juice in place of the lemon. Some reviewers mentioned it lacked flavor. I like a little spice, so I added a few shakes of chipotle flavoring, garlic powder and cumin. Great with tortilla chips for a quick snack.
