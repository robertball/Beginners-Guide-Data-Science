OHMYGOD This is sooo good! Let me tell you about a few changes I made here- not to offend but to suit my own preferences. I chose to make my own dressing using a packet of Good Seasons which eliminated the need for the clove of garlic and the salt. I used black olives in place of the brocolli (because I hate the way that vinegar tends to "cook" the brocolli) also I wanted chunks of mozarella to marinate in the dressing so I used the Polly-O string cheese. I had to taste the stuff- just couldn't wait for the fridge time and it was awesome! I hope I can keep my paws out of it until my boyfriend gets home from work! I left the parmesan out until serving time because I know it would absorb too much of the dressing! So glad I doubled the recipe! I will be making this again...and again...

I originally made this recipe and was disappointed. I found that you need to double the amount of dressing, otherwise the pasta is very dry and tastless. Also, making the pasta and dressing the day before gives it extra flavor. My family just eats it up, and I always get requests for the recipe. It is really delicious and perfect for hot days when mayonnaise might go bad.

I am happy to have found this quick and yummy pasta salad. Two friends of mine, who tasted it, asked me for the recipe and made it the next day! 
However I modified the recipe somewhat (partly in error as I was looking simultaneously at another similar recipe), and well, what do you know, it worked, so....here's what I did - used a 1/4 cup light-tasting olive oil instead of the 1/2 cup vegetable oil, added some chopped bell pepper along with the broccoli, used regular chopped tomatoes instead of the cherry tomatoes, omitted the pepperoni and basil, and marinated the veggies in the dressing while the pasta cooked, adding the cheeses once the pasta was cooled to room temp. I then refrigerated the prepared salad in the refrigerator.

I mixed everything together and chilled it. i used seeded plum tomatoes instead of cherry and increased the garlic. Next time I will use salami instead of the pepperoni.

We love this salad.  I made a few changes: replaced veggie oil with olive oil and reduced it to 1/3 cup, used whole wheat rotini, and replaced the pepperoni with hard salami.

Another allrecipes success story...this was great! Used a little more macaroni than called for and added 1/2 chopped green bell pepper and 1/2 chopped red bell pepper and let them "chill" with noodle/vinegar mixture.  We loved it and wished I would have doubled the recipe! Thanks for the tasty summer treat!

My Husband Loved This!  He says he hates olives in everything, but he liked them in this salad.  I offered to take them out the next time i made it and he said "No, its yummy the way it is"!  Only thing is i leave out the cherry tomatoes because I don't like them.  Sometimes I substitute the pepperoni with salami from the deli case, depends whats on sale.  Really a great easy and delicious recipe.

I give it 4 stars because although it was delicious, I made some modifications. I omitted broccoli.  Added olives, red peppers, green onions, and I did 1/2 pepperoni 1/2 salami. I used tri-color rotini, for more color.  I cut up roma tomatoes instead of cherry.  I doubled the recipe and it worked really well!  I will definitely make it again, my way, and maybe add just a few more red pepper flakes to give it some kick.  Also, I recommend refrigerating overnight so the noodles soak up all the dressing.  It would have been too wet if I'd served it after just a few hours in the fridge.

Followed the recipe exactly and found it tasteless and too oily. Would not do again. Rating is showing up as 5 star. I entered only 2 stars.

Very tasty! Was a hit at a recent family get-together. I made without Pepperoni, substituted olive oil for vegetable oil, used fresh basil and used sun-dried tomatoes instead of cherry tomatoes. In hindsight I would add the cherry tomatoes in as well, for extra flavor and more veggies. Was good the next day, although the broccoli did get a little "cooked" by the vinegar, so just ate around it. I think this recipe could be easily adapted to use other vegetables.

This was sooooo good! I made a huge bowl of this for a party and it was just about gone. At first people took small portions, but they soon came back for more once they tasted it! The initial recipe does not make very much so at least double it (but reduce the oil).

This is has some nice flavors but I found it to be a bit too oily for my tastes, so I'll cut back on that and use olive oil rather than vegetable oil for more flavor.  I'm vegetarian so I left out the pepperoni but I had some roasted red peppers that I wanted to use up so I added those.  The flavors in the salad are good and they get better with time, just cut back on the oil and switch to a good quality olive oil rather than vegetable oil. Thanks for sharing :)

I made a few changes to the salad.  I recently made this without the broccoli and added black olives.  I used Italian salad dressing rather than the vinegar.  And I cut up green peppers, onions, and included this with the plum tomatoes and pepperoni slices.  Awesome!  Next time I will try the broccoli florets.

This is gourmet restaurant quality.  I made as written, except I used a bottled lite northern italian dressing, thawed frozen broccoli florets and 2% shredded mozzarella.  Fabulous!  I can't wait to have leftovers for lunch today.

This was really good! Accidentally added the brocoli before it chilled so I think it soaked up a lot of the dressing.

Hi everyone I am the original submitter for this recipe.  Just one little correction, the broccoli in the original recipe should be cooked tender crisp before adding to salad.  The salad is a bit dry as is especially if you cook the pasta al dente and it soaks up the dressing but I like it that way.  Feel free to double the dressing.  It is quite yummy!

This was really good.  I added all ingredients you would find in an antipasto salad (tomato, cucumber, red onion, ham, salami, black olives, and fresh mozzarella) I also added broccoli, red pepper, and shredded carrots for color.  I doubled the dressing recipe and  tossed with 1/2 the dressing and reserved the other 1/2.  Served the next day and tossed with the rest of the dressing. Very good!

This was ok.  I don't think the 1/2 cup oil was too much but I did use olive oil so maybe that's why.  I just wasn't blown away by it.  Maybe I'll add some stuff to it if I make it again.

This is a pretty good pasta salad.  I did follow others suggestions and doubled all the dressing ingredients except for the oil and salt.  I added some red bell pepper as well as I had some to use up and it added a nice flavor to the salad.  We did not wait the recommended 2 hours to eat and it was still pretty tasty although we all agreed it was better the next day.  Thanks for the recipe!

great tasting pasta salad. I added one medium red onion (quartered and sliced) and used sliced chorizo instead of pepperoni.

This recipe is brilliant.  I followed it exactly except used spiral pasta and it was perfection, so tasty, so so yummy.  The amount of dressing was perfect in my opinion.  The following night I added some sliced cucumber (it needed to be used up) and the boyfriend loved it all the more (I don't eat cucumber).  I did add a bit more dressing the 2nd night as it seemed to dry up just a bit.  This will definitely become my staple pasta salad!

Very good! I use olive oil instead of veggie oil, and usually a full bag of pasta to make more. The family loves it.

I added a half of a red onion and instead of veggie oil i used olive oil.  I really liked it, it is fast and easy to make.

Made this twice and loved it both times.  We cook the broccoli 4-5 minutes so it is a bit tender and we also use fresh basil.  We also use a bit of balsamic vinegar in place of 1 tbsp of red wine vinegar.  Everyone in the family loves this.  We feel like we finally found our go to pasta salad!  thanks!

I thought this was good but not great.  My guests were all raving about it, but I thought it needed a little more flavor...I only was able to chill for 2-3 hours, so I think it may have tasted better if I had left it overnight.  Still, it was a solid side dish for a barbecue and was easy to make.  I did think it needed more sauce, so I made 1.5x the specified amount.

This was good.  I think the vinegar was a bit over powering, but still yummy.  I will use my own salad dressing next time.  If you don't like vinegar, use your favortie dressing.  It's delicious!

This is sooo good! I love antipasto and in the form of pasta salad, it's amazing. I scaled the recipe in half because there was no way my husband & I could consume 12 servings between the two of us, and it makes the perfect amount to keep in the fridge for a quick lunch or dinner side. I omitted the Asiago as I didn't have any on hand and didn't want to buy any and it still tasted great with just fresh shredded Parmesan. Although I only used 1/2 package of Italian Dressing Mix, I could've used less, maybe 1/3 instead. It really overpowers the taste.

This was pretty good.  I used rotini instead of macaroni, doubled the dressing, and used olives and green peppers rather than broccoli.  I also skipped the mozarella but upped the parmesan.  I didn't really like the cherry tomatoes in there... might leave them out next time and add another bell pepper.

This is great!  You can use any kind of pasta, it doesn't matter, and it will turn out great.  I used a 3-pasta mix and it was wonderful.  I made it the first time and followed the recipe exactly; here is what I have learned.  When it says to refrigerate for 2-3 hours only do 1 hour.  Put the rest of the goodies in and then do another hour in the refrigerator.  This gives the broccoli, tomatoes, and pepperoni (or salami, I have used both they are just as good) time to soak in the olive oil and vinegar which makes it all the better in my opinion.  Enjoy!

Great recipe, and versatile, too!  I've enjoyed it "as is", and when assigned "salad" at a "formal" potluck dinner, I doubled the tricolor pasta and dressing, and added black olives, roasted red peppers, and mushrooms. EVERYONE asked for the recipe!  I find making the dressing first, and letting it stand while the pasta cooks helps make the flavoring more uniform (I only put half on the pasta, and use the other half to marinate the veggies).  The dressing is simple, quick, and great as a stand alone on a basic tossed salad.  Kudos!!!!

Very good. We made it with alterations. We cut back on the oil and upped the red wine vinegar. We added kidney beans and used plain ol' tomatoes. We did swap the pepperoni for salami and used veggies noodles instead of flour/wheat noodles. It was very good! We'll keep this one around for parties and summer dinners.

I thought this was a good base for a pasta salad but in the end I had to add quite a bit of seasoning to make this a full flavored pasta salad.  I doubled the pasta (and of course doubled the dressing - but used Good Seasons rather than all the oil mentioned in this recipe).  I also added red wine vinegar, a LOT of Garli Garni powder and added salami (instead of pepperoni), provolone cheese and black olives.  In the end, the salad was fantastic...but my husband and I tasted it before I jazzed it up and felt it still needed a lot.  Will definitely make again.  Can alter to your family's tastes and really make this perfect!

Great picnic pasta salad that everyone will like!  I would suggest using just a little more dressing or a little less pasta for a good balance.  I don't enjoy this left over -- it gets too dry.

No, no, no. Followed the recipe to the letter and found it to be extremely dry and only exhibiting an "oily" taste. No other flavor. My husband only picked the pepperoni out of the salad. Thinking that this would be a better salad the next day, I put it in the fridge. Wrong. It only got worse.

This is great for summer barbecues where a mayo based salad may spoil. It's definitely better after it sits in the fridge overnight.

This recipe was easy and tastes great! BIG hit with guests. Easy to substitute any ingredients you might have in the house. I used brocoli, tomato, red pepper and carrots. Definitely didn't need as much oil as suggested in the recipe. Probably used about 3/4 of the recommended amount. Also, used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. I made it with the red vinegar and it was great. I was thinking about trying the balsamic vinegar instead, but happy I went with the red wine vinegar. Shredded mozzarella cheese was a nice touch, but not neccesary if you don't have it. Definitely try this recipe!

Good pasta salad recipes are hard to come by...and this is one is a hit!  The pasta picks up the dressing flavor wonderfully - especially is you let it chill over-night, and then throw in the other ingredients.  I substituted the basil with cilantro, and left the pepperoni out for the vegetarians in the crowd - and replaced it with sliced olives.  Will make this crowd-pleaser again!

This recipe was okay.  I brought it to a BBQ and no one really raved about it.  My son and husband liked it but you cannot leave this out too long, the pepperoni starts to look weird.

I've made this 3 times this weekend, twice for pot lucks and once for our family.  What a great recipe!  The pasta soaks up the dressing, giving it a perfect bit of zip. I did also reduce the oil to 1/3 cup, which was plenty.  More veggies than the original amounts can be incorporated here, if that is your pleasure.  The mozz cheese was too much for my tastes, so I just stuck with the parm at the beginning.  Enjoy!

We liked the little bit of spice to this.  I didn't have macaroni noodles, so I used bow ties and it was very good.  We're also not much of tomato eaters, so I substituted green & red peppers.  I cut each pepperoni slice in half to make it go farther. This is added to my recipe box!

Loved loved loved!  I'm not a huge pasta salad fan, but I fell in love with this recipe.  As is, it is very good, but I also tried it with a few alterations. I used about a 1/8 cup of chopped olives, I thinly sliced my pepperoni into rectangle 1/8 in slivers, I added about 2 ounces of ham (chopped fine). This is a great base for adding any veggies, I used green peppers, cucumbers and zucchini (grated) as fillers rather than the broccoli.  My favorite small change was using fresh basil and  fresh mozzarella that I sliced into thin, small chunks (once I also used string cheese cut into small circles - but the fresh mozzarella is much better).  It was amazingly good and everyone asked for the recipe.

We loved this - though as others suggested I think it'd work slightly better with salami instead of the pepperoni.. in any case, wonderful salad, thanks for sharing this!

this recipe is really, really good. I omitted the pepperoni to make it vegetarian, and instead of broccoli I added a can of whole pitted black olives and some chopped roasted yellow peppers. (even if you don't omit the tomatoes and broccoli, I would recommend throwing in some olives.) I also used olive oil instead of vegetable, and tripled the amount of fresh garlic. it was mega delicious! especially good when paired with a nice white pizza.

This recipe is to die for. I kept snacking on it while it was chilling because it was so good!!! I did change some things. I used balsamic vinegar instead of red-wine vinegar, and doubled minced garlic. It's so much better.  DO NOT ADD SALT. In the very least, HALF the salt. I omitted the sausage, and added more veggies (red bell pepper, fresh parsley, fresh basil, and shredded carrots). I add all ingredients and THEN chill, letting the flavors have time to 'marry'. Honestly, this makes such a difference. Great recipe. This is the way God meant us to eat our vegetables. ;)

When I watched the video on how to do this recipe, it mentioned that the broccoli had to be "blanched." That is not listed on this recipe. I didn't know how to blanch the broccoli, so I found a site which shows a video of exactly how to do this process.

You won't believe how great this is.  We made this recipe (in bulk haha) for a baby shower.  Everyone raved over it and several people asked for the recipe.  If fact, another lady who caters started serving it on her wedding reception menu.  After making it by the recipe several times, we started a substitution ---scrap  the oil and vinegar and replace with Kraft zesty Italian dressing.  It gave fuller flavor and made it a bit more convenient to make.

This recipe was just okay. I made a double batch for a potluck picnic. Except for using cider vinegar because I was out of wine vinegar and using part whole wheat pasta, I followed the recipe as written. Seems like it could have used more dressing so the broccoli would soak up more. Flavor was good, though.

Although this salad is probably not "low fat" due to the cheeses, vegetable oil and pepperoni, it is delicious! I used tri-color spring macaroni  and my daughter said, "It looks like a salad you'd see in a magazine." Definitely great for a potluck!

I altered the recipe slightly. I added 3 cans of sliced black olives, salami,cucumbers, and lots of garlic.
I made this for a picnic, but we ate most of it before we got to the picnic.

This didn't have much flavor. Perhaps a stronger vinegar, balsamic, may do the trick and olive oil instead of vegetable oil. I probably won't make it again.

Very good. I would go with even less that 1/3 c oil next time. I subbed the veg oil for olive oil. Next time Im adding black olives too.

I have made this several times, it's a great dish to bring to a bbq or potluck in the summer. Good blend of flavors I have never had need to alter it. However, I have forgotten to stir it up after it's refrigerated and some of the dressing flavor is lost so remember to give it a good wake-up stir before serving.

I have made this recipe on countless occasions, and am always praised for it, and asked for the recipe. I always cut up string cheese into cubes instead of using shredded mozzarella. I wouldn't do it any other way. I also add a can of garbonzo beans (chickpeas) and sometimes black olives if I have them. I will make this often.

This was GOOD, but, I don't mess around with making dressing.  I use a bottle dressing that I love on salads, and then incorporate it into this salad.   I agree that it is not a true Antipasto salad, but, we all cook differently!    I also add cukes, red/green/yellow or organge peppers, shaved carrots,red onions, no cheese!!!, a little black olives, everyone can make a antipasto salad, just clean out the refr with whatever veggies you have and a bottle of good dressing.

At first, the pasta came out kind of bland. So I added two tablespoons of lite Italian dressing, another tablespoon of red wine vinegar, and more salt and pepper. It was still a bit bland; but my boyfriend liked it.

I thought this was a pretty good recipe, I used rotini pasta because I had it in the house.  Good overall flavor.  Also a side note to a previous review, antipasto does not mean without pasta, it is an adaptation of the word antipasti meaning appetizer in Italian, which this sort of dish is often served as.

This is a great salad - so much better than when it's made with bottled dressing, and very easy to make.  I made the following changes:  I used 1/2 canola oil and 1/2 olive oil.  I don't like basil so I used Italian seasoning.  I used the tomato, cucumbers. sweet onion, green pepper, the mozzarella cheese, and the pepperoni.  You can do anything you want with this... it's the dressing, and it's a good one.  I did let it marinade overnight, but the noodles soaked up the dressing, so I made half of a second batch and mixed it up just before serving.  My boyfriend loved it, and he usually doesn't like this kind of salad.  Good job, and thank you for sharing!

Yummy!  Lightly steamed the broccoli before adding.  Great recipe, thanks Maridele.

This is a great recipe.  After reading the reviews, I also added a chopped bell pepper (I used a yellow one) and the juice of one lemon.  I also substituted olive oil-- but will use a little less next time.  I didn't have mozzarella so I cut up some swiss cheese into very small cubes and let it marinate in the dressing.  We ate this right after it was done while it was still warm and it was delicious-- we just couldn't wait!  Also, this is a great vegetarian recipe when the pepperoni is omitted.  I will definitely make this again.

I loved this salad!! The only thing that I changed was that I ommitted the pepperoni, which I can't stand, and it was still amazing! So easy and light but enough for a meal, great salad.

Delicious and pretty easy to make. It was a hit with my friends at a park picnic!  Instead of shredded mozzarella cheese, I bought a big log of it and cubed it small (as per another reviewer's advice).  I also agree that it was a bit much on the oil, though.  You could definitely get away with less.  Also, I used half veggie oil and half olive oil.  I marinated overnight and in the morning had to add a splash more vinegar and a bit more salt to taste.  Thanks for the recipe!

This stuff is so good - everyone I serve it to asks for the recipe! I double the dressing, (only 3/4 cup of the oil though) and its perfect! My new favorite pasta salad.

Edible, but not one for the books.  Just not a whole lot of taste even after some additions - red onion, cucumber, red pepper.

This is a great recipe and so simple to put together.  I made it without the pepperoni and mozz. cheese because I was in the mood for a more vegetarian salad and it was great.  Next time I'll try the entire recipe.  Very easy, adaptable and yummy!

Not sure I will make again. I made some substitutions, red peppers and olives instead of broccoli and salami instead of pepperoni. It was OK, not great and a little bit too oily.

Very good start.  The changes I made were omitting the broccoli, adding sliced black olives, using (drained) diced tomatoes, and cutting back the olive oil and vinegar by half (the pasta would have been swimming in dressing otherwise).  In the end, very tasty, if not exactly diet material!

Great pasta salad .. I also added italian salami and cubed a variety of cheeses (cheddar, provolone swiss).  I also used a variety of vegetables in place of some of the broccoli to add some color.

I've been making this pasta salad for many, many years. It is much prettier made with tri-color rotini pasta. The broccoli is much better steamed until tender crisp and shocked in cold water before added to the pasta.And I also add a few purple onion rings to the mix. This is a family favorite.

This is a good solid pasta salad.  I usually add bell peppers and squash and omit the broccoli since that's what I typically have on hand.

It really is a fantastic light dish for spring. A couple things I decided to change: I decided to use Amorosa tomatoes and a mild Cacciatore Salami. It really boils down to personal preference for me, but it turned out great.

This made a GREAT lunch! I left out the broccoli and added crumbled feta cheese. I left the pasta and parmesan cheese in the dressing overnight. In the morning, I added the pepporoni and feta cheese. It was yummy!!!

The marinade/dressing for this salad was very good and could be used for any sort of vegetable salad.

This pasta salad was amazing! Instead of regular salt I used a Mediterranean sea salt that includes garlic and Italian herbs.  I also added some fresh chopped parsley and a little lemon juice.  My fiance thought it was simply the best.

After reading the reviews I cut the olive oil to 1/3 cup. I used sun-dried tomatoes instead of cherry tomatoes and fresh basil instead of dried. I omitted the moz cheese at the end & also the meat.  I am definitely going to try variations of this recipe soon.

Took this to a 4th of July potluck and got many rave reviews! Everyone was asking for the recipe. I substituted the mozzarella cheese with string cheese chopped into bite size pieces. Also substituted the pepperoni sausage with turkey pepperoni slices.....added chopped black olives and VOILA!  A great hit!

I decided to put the pepperoni under the broiler in my oven for a few minutes before adding it to the salad... and we really liked it that way.  In fact, I confess, I could NOT stop eating this salad! (And my kids loved it too!)  I will definitely make this again.

Excellent recipe!!  Probably should call for some additional salt and pepper.  Also, I substituted the shredded mozzarella for cubed chunks, mainly because I always look forward them.

Made for a potluck & it was almost gone before I got through the line.  I thought, correctly the at it would interest kids as well as adults.  I made it again to enjoy at home.

This was a great side dish for our Mother's Day BBQ.  Next time however, I would omit the pepperoni sausage.

I liked this recipe because it was easy and it looked nice. I used a larger pasta.  I liked the way it tasted but it was not out of this world. I brought it to a potluck and about half was left over.  I would make this again though when looking for a quick fix, but not when I am trying to "WOW" people.

I have never been a fan of pasta salads before, but I gave this one a try...I love it!  It is easy and leftovers keep well in the refrigerator for a couple days. It is perfect for those who do not like heavy mayo on their pasta salads.  Try adding tri-colored pasta for a more appetizing look!

I made this with spiralized zucchini and other vegetables.  I used Muffeletta, which has oil and spices in it .  I diced up salami instead of the pepperoni. 
I would try it again with pasta.  It was easy to make; but I needed more of a zip to it.  I think the spiralized vegetables detracted from the taste. 
It was a beautiful looking salad.  I liked the color and texture combinations.

I have used this brilliantly simple recipe time and again ... it is WONDERFUL I use ham and Jarlsberg Cheese instead of pepperoni.
