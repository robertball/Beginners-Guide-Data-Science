Not too yummy, they were bland and spongy.  Perhaps I made them wrong, but I won't try this recipe again.

A bit sweeter than a normal pancake, which may account for the kids' enjoying them so much.  Excellent when served with apples sauteed in brown sugar and cinnamon.

Although the batter is easy to make, the pancake itself is definitely hard to get flat and even on all sides.  I tried to spread the batter by swirling the pan but it still didn't come out right.  I think I'll stick to IHOP for my pancakes!!

These are not that great.  They are very sweet (I think that's the part that makes them like the IHOP ones?) but other than that have pretty much no flavor, they are really bland.  I followed the recipe exactly as well (although I did sub white whole wheat flour instead of ap flour) and didn't have a problem with the consistency like some other reviewers did.  I just didn't think they had any flavor.  Even my kids weren't that impressed with them.  I won't be making this recipe again.

I made these and they had no taste and were very thick.  I did everything as the recipe stated, but neither my husband nor I liked this recipe.  I would definitely not make this again.

I have never had those other famous international pancakes.  This one tasted like a muffin batter recipe to me.  It's not that they weren't good, I am just looking for a recipe like my grandmothers.

Great pancakes, very sweet. Thin batter in crisco makes thin crispy pancakes.

The flavor was fine; however, the batter is very runny and the pancakes turned out thin and flat.  I prefer more fluffy pancakes.

this was my first time making homemade pancakes, I thought they were delicious,, the reviews that said they were too thick or too thin, just need to add more flour or milk whichever the case, I followed the receipe and they turned out really good, and had a good flavor too. very good

Something is missing. My batter came out thick and it didn't cook all the way through. It was a lot of sugar so the outside cooked too fast at medium heat on a burner. I think it needs baking soda and less sugar. However if you want to bake these instead you've got a good recipe. lol. sigh.

This recipe isn't that bad.  The only things I would suggest would be instead of "baking powder" use baking soda.  These pancakes are just very firm and chewy.  They also have a bland taste.  I would also suggest instead of using the vegetable oil use 2 tbs. of butter.  I think that will help it out a lot :)

Absolutely delicious!!!!  And yes the truly did remind me of International Pancakes. Best pancakes I have ever made.  I didn't have buttermilk so I used 1 1/4 cups of regular milk and 1/4 cup of white vinegar.  It is important to immediately cook the pancakes after everything is mixed for best results.  Loved them and so did my husband and he is a really picky eater. Thanks for sharing.

Very good recipe but a bit on the sweet side. The pancakes come out very nice! To make it more healthy I tried using whole wheat flour instead of white and also added some ground flax seed and wheat germ. I also tried using raw sugar instead of white (I also used less sugar) and it came out great! My kids really liked them and they didn't know they were eating healthy! I now make these instead of store bought boxed pancake mix.

This recipe was great! The whole family loved them, and they are very picky. Very easy to make. I like pancakes a bit on the thick side so I added a bit more flour to the batter. Also did not turn the heat to medium high but to a bit lower then medium heat.

don't waste you time on this recipe. my batter went down the sink after two pancakes. too much sugar and too much oil, the cakes are very dense, they even look like junk.
If any pancake chain made them like this they would be out a business ASAP.

Sorry, these just weren't quite right.  As other reviewers mentioned, I would cut the sugar significantly for these, and normally I like everything sweet.  I'd say cut the sugar to 1 tablespoon and use melted butter instead of oil for flavor.

The texture was off, but I think that was the sugar overdose.  I'd recommend Good Old Fashioned Pancakes if you're looking for a nice fluffy pancake recipe.

I found this recipe because I was out of milk and wanted pancakes for breakfast. I used a buttermilk powder from the organic foods store, and mixed with water to make the buttermilk. I also added 1 tsp. vanilla. The pancakes were so thin and crepe-like they melt in your mouth, and were excellent without even adding butter or syrup. This recipe is not what I had expected, but I will definitely make these again.

Way too much oil, if you want to eat it, replace the oil by butter.

These were the best homemade pancakes I have ever had. The only thing I added to the recipe was 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract. 
Will be my "go-to" pancake recipe

I have tried this recipe at least two times and have enjoyed it both times. On the second time I added half a teaspoon of vanilla extract and it task even better.
