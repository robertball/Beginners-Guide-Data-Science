These are wonderful lemon bars!  After reading some reviews about too little lemon filling, I made a couple adjustments.  I kept the crust the same but pressed it into a 9x9 pan and baked for 10 minutes.  Then I increased the lemon filling to 1 1/2 times the amount in the recipe.  This gave me the perfect ratio of crust and filling!  Perfect balance of sweet and tart.

I've been making these for about 6 years from this recipe.  They are so delicious. I always make four batches.  I use two batches in a 9 x 12 pan and they are just right.  Everyone requests them and they get eaten up fast.

Even my boyfriend who doesn't like sweets kept raving about this one. I did have to add about an extra tablespoon of butter into the crust. Also, when I was looking over the recipe it didn't look like there would be enough filling so I changed the serving size to 24 (original recipe makes 16). So - leave the crust measurements the same and multiply the filling measurements by 1.5.

These were and are wonderful! I'm actually eating one right now as I type this! I have made these Lemon Bars a few times now and love the outcome...I'm completely addicted! lol I did change a few things to make it more to my liking. For instance, I baked the shortbread like crust for 15 mins instead of the 20 the recipe called for. I also added WAY more lemon juice...about 1/4 cup actually. :) My husband and I decided that we wanted more lemon taste. Thanks for a GREAT recipe that I will make all the time! :)

These were fantastic!  I had several lemon bar recipes to try, and I chose these specifically because some reviewers said there was not enough filling.  I like more crust than filling (I must be the only one!), but no one else complained that there was not enough filling.  The crust was nice and thick, and had a great shortbread taste.  The filling is not too sweet, and had a perfect amount of lemon flavor.  I will make these again.

I have been baking for many years, and this is the BEST lemon bar recipe I have ever come across.  I would suggest cooking the crust for five minutes less than the recipe says.

I made this for a bake sale, and they were snapped up!  Delicious taste! I cut the sugar in half and added some more lemon juice since I have a "sour" tooth. 
Overall, mouth-watering.

While these did turn out okay, it's definitely not was I was looking for.  It makes a really thin bar, I wanted something thicker.  It tastes fine, but I will never make again, or if I do, I will triple the filling.  THOROUGLY DISAPPOINTED!

I made this recipe, but found there was not enough filling. The filling did not have enough lemon flavor as well. Although, they did come out tasting okay. Next time if I make them I will double the filling and add more lemon.

These lemon bars were wonderful! Actually, just finished one! My husband who is not a big lemon bar fan loved them as well! I did  double the filling and added more lemon juice and a splash of lemon extact to give it more zing and color! I did enjoy these very much, they turned out extreamy buttery and moist! By far the best recipe out of many! Thank you.

If you like more zing - add a bit more lemon juice - we thought they were good - just a little bland

This one is great, because it doesn't require powdered sugar! I added the zest of the 2 lemons that I used, put half in the crust, half in the filling, and also added 1 tsp. vanilla to the crust. Oh, and a dash of salt to both crust and filling. Doubled the recipe and used a 12x9 pan. Really, really yummy! Thanks for the recipe.

I JUST made these! and they are delicious. The crust DOES taste like shortbread cookie but It works! Here are my add ins... For the CRUST: I added lemon zest of one lemon, 1 tsp of vanilla and a pinch of salt. Also, because the reviews cautioned about too much crust for the filling I did not use the eniter thing, instead I used the remainder as a topping (like crumb topping) Baked that for ONLY 15 minutes though. FILLING: I added 6 Tbsp. of lemon juice and lemon zest of one lemon (could have done two).  added the filling to the crust and baked for an additional 20 minutes. AND because i read there was an issue with the filling not setting, after the 20 minutes bake time I turned off the oven left the door open and let it cool in the oven. Other than that it was a DELICIOUS bar : )

I juiced 1/2 of a large lemon and added 1/2 tsp. lemon extract and some zest from the lemon peel.  I think you need to make sure you use an 8" not a 9" square pan and be sure to lightly oil the pan.

I have never made any lemon bars before, but I'm glad I tried these.  After reading others' reviews, I took off 5 minutes of bake time for the crust and doubled the filling amounts.  After having a bit of an issue getting the filling to set (I had to cook it a bit longer than instructed due to, I think, the extra filling), I was able to enjoy this delightfully sweet, yet tart dessert.  It was a hit at our Cinco de Mayo party--a great way to curb the "burn" off all the spices!  I will be making this again.

These turned out great.  I made a few changes as I didn't have lemon, only lime.  I also doubled the filling because when I poured the first batch over the crust, it just wasn't enough.  Had to bake it a little longer but it worked out good.

A great recipe! I doubled the amount of lemon juice, and added an extra egg. Also, I reduced the baking time for the crust by 5 min, following other user's suggestions.

I love the flavor of this bar, it is very lemon-y and the crust is just perfect.  These do not last long around our house.  I wanted to say that I add the zest of 1/2 a lemon to this recipe.

I made 3 different lelmon bar recipes and these were not the winner. I thought they would be better but I found the crust too thick and none of the powdered sugar would stick. The top layer seemed to be crunchy like creme brulee which I liked but it kind of seemed out of place. They were chewy in a way I didn't care for. My family's favorite recipe ended up being The Best Lemon Bars by Patty Schenck.

Awesome! Easy! Don't change a thing!
The first batch I made I took others advise and double the filling. Too much. Second time, didn't change anything. Perfect! actually the crust was better too!

Great tasting lemon bar, but the top was not as gooey as I wanted.  Definitely recommend making at least 1.5 times the filling, and adding more lemon then required

This recipe isn't too shabby, but it can use a LOT of tweaking. To start off with, in an 8x8 pan, the amount of ingredients listed for the crust is way too much. I used just over half of what I made and it covered the pan very nicely and puffed up to a nice sized crust. Then there's the filling. The filling is okay as written, but definitely can be better. Bump up the servings to 24 or 30 and you'll have enough to be able to call this a bar. Then you want to also add the zest of one lemon to really get a true lemon flavor. The juice alone isn't good enough. And if you don't like it super sweet, cut down on the sugar. I gave it 3 stars only because it's a decent starting point.

i double the filling bc lik the other reviewer it didnt seem like it was enough, it came out so great. We had to give half it away because we knew we would finish the whole thing in one sitting.

yum, yum!  I have high standards when it comes to lemon bars, and these definitely surpassed the benchmark.  I added just a touch more lemon juice after reading other reviews.  I found that the crust to lemon filling ratio was 1:1. Perfect.

For taste I give this recipe a 5 star.  For directions I give it a 4 only because there is not enough filling.  I changed the filling to 1.5 and it was perfect.

Wonderful lemon bars.  I took the advice of a few others and added lemon zest and more lemon juice. LOVED THEM! I have never made lemon bars before (from scratch)and found this recipe simple and quick to make. Thanks for sharing.

These were GREAT! Everyone loved em at our cookout/party/gathering. I did increase the amount of filling by half after reading some reviews saying the filling to crust ratio wasn't right. Seemed to come out perfect!

These were very good!  There's no need to buy boxed lemon bars anymore.  I will definitely use this recipe again!

Because I like it thicker on top, I think I would cut the crust in half [or double the filling]; but other than that, the flavor is perfect.

I have made lemon bars many times before and decided to try a new one for fun!  You should Believe the other reviewers when they this is mediocre.  It has the thinnest layer of lemon. I would not waste my time making it again.

Very yummy!  I used half butter and half shortening as per someones suggestion and the crust came out light and fluffy.  I also substituted 1 tbsp lemon juice for 1 tbsp orange juice because I ran out of lemon but you can't even tell. They are so incredibly easy to make, too!  I'm definately printing it and adding it to my recipe book.  Thank you.

Absolutely love this recipe and recommend it all the time.  I've been making this for a couple of years now, after having found it here quite some time ago.  I'm just now getting around to giving it a rave review.  This is the recipe that made me a fan of lemon bars.  Most others pale in comparison in my opinion! After reading all the other reviews, I would also add that you MUST use fresh squeezed lemon juice.  Using the bottled lemon juice is not worth the effort and not lemony at all.  Also, be sure to not overbake the crust or it will be overly crumbly and dry.  Otherwise this recipe is perfect!  I'm surprised at some of the negative reviews??

I really liked these a lot! The shortbread base is amazing. I will be making these again for my family reunion this weekend and plan on making the lemon layer using 1.5x of the given ingredients and will add some lemon zest for extra lemon flavor.

Edit: I made these again and used 1.5x of the ingredients for just the filling portion. I used both the zest and the juice of two lemons (the juice was over 1/3 cup.) These turned out WONDERFULLY! If you love lemon like my family and I do, then this is definitely the way to go!

my first time making lemon bars, I'm so glad i used this recipe. It turned out delicious, I did what most of the reviews said: made 1.5 the amount of filling and baked the crust for 10-15 minutes, however when i baked the whole thing I left it for more than 20 minutes since it was undercooked. wonderful recipe, i highly recommend!!

I have made this recipe five times in the last month. I bake the crust for 15 minutes instead of 20. I also add a dash of almond extract to the crust. These are very good bars, I just like the crust a certain way and 20 minutes makes the crust too hard IMO. I make the filling as written.

This dessert is AWESOME!!!! I made this for our friend's 4th of July party for something different and it was a BIG HIT!!! Everyone loved it including my hubby.  I left the recipe as is except I made a double batch & added 2 more TBS of lemon juice. This is a star recipe thank you for  the share!

The crust was in for 15 minutes, per other comments. I also doubled the filling, but added a full 1/2c of lemon juice. I like it sour.

Additionally, I used an 11x7 glass baking dish and these came out perfectly! By far the best lemon bars I've ever had. They're usually way too sweet and not very lemony, but these were excellent.

Although I altered the recipe to my liking, this recipe was a great starting point and worthy of 5 stars.

This was really good. I made the filling part for 24 servings and left the crust at 16 servings.  I forgot to adjust the cooking time though, and the result was sort of like a lemon filled doughnut. My boyfriend really liked them.

Made these as one of my Easter desserts this year.  My guests and family absolutely loved them!  I prefer freshly squeezed lemon juice and only added lemon concentrate because I doubled the recipe to a 9x13 pan and didn't have enough fresh lemon.  The only tiny negative for me was a bit of a "floury" flavor in the lemon filling.  But the buttery sweet shortbread crust is the star! Will definitely make again.

"A pretty solid lemon bar," per my boyfriend.  These were indeed lemony.  I used an 8x10 pan (all I had) with the same baking times, same crust, and 1 1/2 times the topping (per other reviewers).  Chill in the fridge before topping with powdered sugar, then wait until they are completely cold before eating.  Sooo gooood...

This recipe was my first attempt at making lemon bars.  The recipe was easy to follow and the results were delicious.  The crust was light and buttery while the filling had a subtle tart taste that was just right.  I will make these bars again.

This recipe is really great--I've used it twice.  The first time, I followed the recipe exactly.  My only problem with the bars was that they fell apart.  The crust wasn't sturdy enough for the heavy filling on top.

The second time, I made the crust wetter so that it baked into a firmer crust, but the filling on top was too wet.

If I do it again, I will make the filling stiffer.

Made these for easter.  I only changed the recipe by adding a little lemon zest. It had rave reviews at both family parties.  The crust was kind of thick but I'm not sure if that is normal for lemon bars. I will make again because it was so super easy.

This is my go to recipe for Lemon Bars. They are quick to make and the perfect combination of sweet and tart. Let them cool and cut with a knife dipped in cold water for a clean cut. Can't wait to make them again!

I doubled the filling recipe, and increased the amount of lemon juice (a lot), and still I felt like they weren't lemon-y enough for me. The texture was bizarre. I was expecting the crust to be more of a crust and less like a soft shortbread cookie.

I must have made this wrong because I found this to have a bizarre egg flavor. I used artificial eggs - but I use them for everything with no issues. It also tasted very much of flour as well. Not sure what went wrong. Not happy.

i love these lemon bars. my sister has never tried them until i cooked them, she said they were great. one problem, i greased the pan, but they were  hard to get out and after a couple of days, they got very hard, and you had to heat them up first THEN try to take them out. no problem besides that. I would reccomend this to anyone with kids.

These are superb. I followed some of the other reviewers and doubled the amount of filling while leaving the crust as is. I also baked the crust for 15, instead of 20 minutes. I upped the lemon juice to about 1/2 a cup instead of the 1/3 cup that would be needed when doubling the filling. It made a tart filling which was great with the sweetness of the crust.

These are so yummy.   Only trouble I had with them was getting them out the pan, they stuck to it.   I put the pan in the freezer for 30 minutes, and was then able to get them out a little easier.  Next time I will grease the pan :)

This was a great recipe! I took others' advice and actually tripled the filling (I made mine in a 9x13 pan as I was serving several people) and doubled the crust. Everyone thought they were great, though I heard from one dinner guest that they were too rich. I, however, loved them and will be making them again! Thanks!

I made this two nights ago.  It is wonderful!  My husband and I really loved it!  Definitely a great recipe for those who like lemon.  It is very easy to make as well!  The only thing I would consider changing is doubling the topping.  It is that good!  I will be making this one often!

After trying several Lemon Bars recipes I have finally found one that takes less time and easy to bake! These came out perfect! The only thing I did was, after reading some of the other reviews I doubled filling ingredients to 24, but kept the crust ingredients the same. I also used an 8x11 dish because the crust would have been to thin for a 9x11. I did add more butter to the crust, just like an extra tbsp of butter. I listened to what everyone said about baking the crust only for 15 minutes rather than 20 and the crust was perfect! I suggest if you want to use a 9x11 pan double your crust ingredients as well. It was perfect! This is the best Lemon bar Recipe I have found! So simple!

These are good, but I will keep looking. The bottom layer crust reminds me too much of shortbread. I am looking for something that tastes like the lemon bars I had in the past with a lighter crust. TIP: If you make them ahead, say to bring to a party, do not dust with powdered sugar until the last minute or the sugar may dissolve into the lemon, especially if there is a temperature change.

Delicious!!!  I did a couple of things differently because I LOOOOOVE lemon and wanted to make the most of the lemons I was using.    *  I infused the sugar with the zest of the lemon by rubbing the zest and sugar together with my fingers.  I did this in the crust AND in the filling.  Fabulously lemon-y!  * I also pressed the crust into a 8x11 dish to get more bars.  * I did 1 1/2 of the filling recipe and it was great!

very yummy (and not too sweet)lemon bars and really easy to make. who knew lemon filling from scratch would be so easy! My only word of caution is to watch everything closely, in my oven the bottom took barely 10 minutes (burnt the first one) and the top about the same.

These are so incredibly easy and yummy.  We tested our new toaster/convection oven with these and are on our second batch.  I do double the lemon mixture and add a tsp of vanilla to the lemon mixture.  The crust is better than box lemon bar crust.  I am taking the crust recipe and try with a pecan pie recipe to make a pecan bar recipe. This was the greatest I'm sorry gift.  My hubby loves me again. Thank you for something so tasty and easy.

I don't think I've ever given a recipe 1 star but I did not care for these at all! I added some extra lemon juice like a reviewer suggested but it didn't help. This came out very dense and bland, almost like a weird cookie - it wasn't my idea of a lemon bar. Way too much crust.

I used the zezt of 2 lemons in the filling to make the lemon flavor really stand out. Also helps if you want them to be a little less sweet.

This recipe is a great base recipe for lemon squares! I had never made them before this, but I've eaten a lot, and the version I came up with was my favorite!! For the curd, I changed it to 3 eggs, 1 cup of white sugar , 3 tbsp of flour, 1/4 tsp of baking powder, 6 tbsp of lemon juice and I also added 1 tsp of cinnamon. All in all, I could have used a little less of the crust (in an 8.4 x 8.4 glass cooking dish, cause I don't have a square pan), but everything was still so delicious.  They're delicate and divine!

I doubled this recipe and put it in a 9x13 pan.  I also added the zest from the lemons to the curd.  While the flavor was very good, the crust came out a bit too thick.  I would have liked more of the lemon curd, so I will probably double that part of the recipe next time, and cut back a bit on the crust.

I am sixteen years old and I can be quite a disaster in the kitchen when it's my first time with a recipe. So the fact that I managed to make it within an hour is quite an accomplishment within itself. An EXTREMELY easy recipe. Very easy to make. I only baked the crust for about 15 minutes. And I actually used about one third less of the amount of ingredients specified for the crust because it provided better balance that way. It looked really appetizing! Tasted heavenly. A little sweet, so next time, I will definitely try using coconut instead of icing sugar as another user has recommended.

I used to make a version of this years ago, though this one calls for less sugar in the curd. The only change I made to the recipe was 4 tablespoons of lemon juice instead of what was called for. The lemon kick is really still more of a tap, next time I will change it to 5, maybe 6 instead. But still a wonderful recipe. It's like spring time in the winter, Hooray!
Used a full 5 tablespoons of lemon this time and it was Lemon Extreme. still tastes wonderful!

Made these for a bake sale last night.  They are excellent!  I doubled the recipe and used a 9x13 pan, so it made a little thicker bar.  It was perfect.  My husband wants to know when I'm going to make them for us!  Also, I saw other reviews that said they were bland.  I'm surprised to see that.  The balance between lemon and sweet was wonderful and flavorful.

This is a really good recipe with one exception.  I always double the filling and cook an additional 10 minutes.  I like that the crust isn't too heavy.  Most of the recipes call for more sugar and butter, but in my opinion that makes the bars a shortbread cookie with lemon topping.

I love lemon bars but have never found that one perfect recipe.  Well, I think I may have found it.  The only thing I didn't care for was that the crust was too thick.  But unlike others, I used all butter in the crust and it was great, just too much of it.  I'll cut the crust ingredients by 1/4 and reduce baking time.  However, I loved the lemon topping (added zest) and will definitely be making these again!

These are so good and so easy to make!!!  I used fresh lemon juice.  Don't worry when the lemon top is really thin and watery before baking--it'll firm up.

I followed this recipe exactly and it turned out perfectly.  They weren't too sweet and had a nice delicate lemon flavor.  Next time I'll add a little lemon zest to the filling to enhance the lemon flavor.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Well I honestly don't know how to rate this recipe! I have made it twice and it came out COMPLETELY different! Yesterday I made it stat with the recipe and the base was thick and crumbly (I used real butter) and the topping was paper thin and dry and not very flavorsome (Used bottled lemon) Today I cut back on the flour for the base and DOUBLED the topping and used fresh lemon and it is WAYYYYYYY softer. I just wish i knew how it was supposed to be???? Both tasted fine actually but both very different. Not sure if I will make them again but I sure am curious as to HOW they are supposed to be???

So far, I've made these  bars four times. I recommend doubling the filling and waiting until the crust is almost done baking to add the lemon juice to the filling. It makes the filling very puffy and makes the bars extra soft, almost fluffy.
Go easy on the powdered sugar if you put any on.
Instead of 3 1/2 tbs of juice, I just put a 1/4 cup of juice. It adds a little extra kick to the bars and makes measurements easier.

These bars did not turn out like a classic lemon bar at all. I will say I have not yet made a lemon bar and this was my first trial but I had very little lemon flavoring to it and the color was off.

Wow... that German lady really did know how to cook!!! These were amazing. The process of blending the filling really made it super smooth. I melted my butter to save the hard work of cutting it into the flour. It turned out fine. I also substituted wheat flour instead of white. However, for the filing you actually need to use white flour, because the wheat flour will make it look brown and grainy.

I made the recipe exactly as is.  The shortbread base was perfect.  I found the lemon filling to be too tart and/or not sweet enough, and also there was not enough of it.  Most other lemon bars I've made had at least double the amount of filling.  Also, I didn't really like the consistency of the filling.   Other people who tasted them liked them but I didn't.  I will not be making these again.

These baked up nicely. The recipe seems to be missing a little bit, though. I added about 1 tsp vanilla to the lemon filling and doubled it. Next time I will add more butter to the crust mixture as it came out very dry before baking and crumbly after baking; too much flour and not enough butter, I think. I will also add more lemon juice for a more lemony flavor.

Tasty. More filling could be used, as well as more lemon flavor. Overall satisfying, quick and easy. Thought the timing on the crust (for our oven in Florida) was perfect. Will definitely make again and tweak with more lemon juice and more filling.

I LOVE the blender idea, it makes it so simple!! I'll agree with the others about 1.5 the amount of filling being perfect, and upping the lemon juice/ zest factor. But really, really delicious and so so easy!! Way to go Annemarie!

Very good. I made exactly as the recipe stated and found the balance b/w the crust and the topping to be just fine.

I followed this recipe exactly and they turned out awesome! Unlike some of the other reviews, I loved the crust to filling ratio. The only downside is waiting for them to cool to eat :)

I like lemon bars with just the right combination of tartness and sweetness, and this is pretty much it!  I agree with the other reviewers that one batch of filling was too much crust and not enough filling, so I made one batch crust and two batches of filling. I also added just a 1/2 tablespoon more of lemon juice, plus almost two lemons worth of lemon zest.  The zest really adds the "fresh lemon" taste that I was hoping for.  I think next time I make this, I will follow another reviewer's suggestion and adds a tablespoon more butter to the crust. Thank you for sharing the recipe, Ingrid!

Absolutely amazing. I doubled the recipe (in a 9x13 pan) and tripled the lemon curd. I used fresh-squeezed lemon juice, and zested three of the lemons into the crust. It was perfect. They were the rave of the family picnic we took them to. Every single person asked for the recipe!

Awsome! I made these lemon bars last night and they turned out great. After reading some of the reviews i decided to make extra filling( 24 sevings instead of 16). The bars came out great, but they would have been just as good with the original quantities. I know lemon bars to be thin and bursting with flavor, but with the extra filling they were a little tall. They are not too sweet and with the perfect amount of lemon goodness. I will make them again for sure, following the original recipe.

This was an awesome recipe and a great hit at work. Some things to keep in mind: I mixed the flour, sugar and butter together on a chopping board with my hands, squeezing the mixture together. I then put the crust in the square pan and pressed firm. I noticed the edges were more crumbly than the middle, so I brushed it to the center and pressed to the edges until it was all solid. #2: Don't make the filling too soon. It only takes about 30 seconds to blend, so I had it sitting there for about 20 mins. Wait until about 17 mins after your crust had been baking before you start blending the filling. #3: Also, I didn't have baking powder so I scratched it from the recipe. The lemon bars ended up firmer and easier to cut and eat. Even though there was less filling than the crust, I think adding more filling would make the lemon bar too strong and sweet. The cookie crust helped take away some of the sugar and tart.

This is my new favorite dessert! Doubled the filling, added lemon zest of one lemon to the crust and filling, used 1/2 real lemon juice and 1/2 artificial lemon juice. I can't get enough!  *When you zest the lemon, only add the bright yellow. The lighter color underneath will give a bitter taste.

This was really good with some tweaking. I followed the suggestions to double the filling & added some zest to both the filling and crust, but I should have used more lemon juice, it just wasn't tart enough for me.

I'm only giving this recipe 3 stars because it may be a good recipe.  I've tried making this 3 times and I'm not sure why my crust dosen't come out right.  I tried looking at some of the other comments but it still came out too burnt or pasty and it stuck to the pan soooo bad.  Baking is something new to me, so I'm blaming myself and not the recipe.  I thought maybe it was too much butter.  The lemon filling came out great, unfortunately I couldn't eat much of that because some of it tasted burndt

These are GREAT! They didn't have enough of a lemon flavor though, but I think adding a bit of extra lemon juice might help that. Aside from that these are so awesome!

Well, I thought they were pretty good-except they were a bit too dry. I think a tablespoon more lemon juice would be good, maybe even a bit more. They were very easy to make. I did add a little bit of vanilla. Very good! Would make these again (with my changes)

It's good and delicious. One thing I don't like is that it's a bit too sweet and not much lemon taste. Maybe it's because I personally don't like too much sugar. I will definitely make it another time, but I'll reduce the amount of sugar.

Well, i found out about this dessert in a most peculiar way. I was watching the new Nancy Drew movie (very corny, yet enjoyable if you were wondering) and I saw that at the beginning of the movie, Nancy offered a very tasty looking dessert to a burglar. I was informed that this dessert was called a 'lemon bar' and decided that i just had to make it! I don't enjoy baking very much, but for some reason i was very excited to bake these lemon bars. So i followed the given recipe perfectly,but definitely wasn't ecstatic about the end result. I must say that my bars looked nothing like the picture above! I'm sure that 'annemarie' could bake them looking superb, but i must say that i couldn't pull it off! For these reasons I am going to rate this recipe at 1 star.

Lemon Bars are one of my favorite desserts; however, I was very disppointed in this recipe.  After reading the reviews, I added extra juice plus the zest but the crust overpowers the taste.  I will not make again.

These were really good, even though I tweaked the recipe a bit.  I added 4tsp of lemon and then I double both the lemon and the crust. All in all they were easy to make and my family loved them.  Thank you

I made these with fresh lime juice (can't easily get fresh lemons where I live)and they were delicious! I scaled up to 24 servings and made a few minor changes: decreased the sugar in the filling by about 2 tablespoons and added the finely grated zest of 2 large limes - both helped to give it that extra zing. These went down very well at our Friday meeting!

Meh - a little bland. Not very lemony at all. I would definitely add more lemon juice or some lemon zest if I made them again. Also, as others noted, too much crust and not enough filling. I found they need less cooking time than indicated as well.

They were allright. They didn't come out that wonderful yellow color as others said it did. I really don't know what I did wrong. They tasted OK, but didn't look that appetising. I may try another recipe from here on out.

Easy to make, however, the lemon filling is too thin, and the crust is way too thick.  I added extra lemon juice like most people suggested.

I was in the mood for something tangy and sweet, and I love lemon bars, though I had never made any myself. I looked at several recipes, but finally decided on this one.  They turned out great and the recipe was so easy.  I will definately make them again and maybe take them in to work when we have a staff luncheon.  I did do like another lady said and I kept the crust the same but increased the filling for 24 servings.  Tangy and sweet just what I was looking for.

I was so dissapointed with this one. It came out of the oven just perfect looking, not too thin, super color, but it just lacks flavor. You can't even taste lemon ( I used fresh lemon). It's more like a sweet cookie.

I cut the crust ingrediants in half, and only baked it for 15 minutes, before adding the topping.

At first this recipe was very very good. The crust smelled WONDERFUL and also looked very good. But the lemon filling was very strong. I baked it anyways. It actually did turn out well and it was even better after sprinkling powdered sugar on it. I say this now: I will try this recipe again!

The lemon filling was wonderful, but the crust was too dense.  Too much butter, I guess.  They're edible, but you're gonna need a glass of something to wash down the crust.

This recipe was great with lime juice!

The crust turned out to be taller than the lemon-egg layer above. This is fine if you're a crust lover like me. I'm curious to try increasing the lemon-egg portions or decreasing the crust portions to get a healthy lemon bar.

I didn't like the crust so much. It could have been my fault because I set out my butter to soften and my husband put it back in the fridge. (He does stuff like that, he's not trained very well). So, I softened it in the microwave, and the crust was not flaky or cookie like. I cooked it for 15 minutes, next time I will do the full 20. I did increase the filling, it was perfect, but it needed the zest which I did not use. There is hope, I will try again!

Good flavors, but I think my crust didn't cook through - I wasn't sure whether it was done before I put in the eggs, and there wasn't much guidance on checking besides the caution against overbaking. Any thoughts? Nice and lemony though! And very good texture in the "curd."

This recipe was delicious!  I baked the crust a tad bit longer to make it a little brown on the edges and it created a super buttery taste.  Fresh lemons are a must.  Since this is only a 8 inch square pan, I'd like to expand it to a 9x13 next time.

I think these are delicious! I made them for a meeting. Everyone loved them. I did take a few tips from other reviewers. I made 1 1/2 the amount of filling and I put the pan in the freezer for about an hour before I tried to cut the bars. It helped immensely. Thanks for the tips.

I made a small change based on what others said. I used an 8 x 8 pan and made the crust as per the recipe.
I doubled the lemon filling added a little more lemon juice, just 2 tbsp or so.
There was no problem. With being too much filling . The ratio crust to filling was great.
Baked crust the 20 minutes and was good. This is the best recipe for lemon squares I have had.
Tastes like lemon pie with shortbread . crust, sweet and tart.
I shared these for others to taste. Everyone loved them.
Definitely will make these again. Excellent!

This dessert is an absolute winner and very popular with anyone who I have offered a piece to. I’ve made it for celebrations, bake sales for charity or just when I want a wonderful lemony dessert. As others have already mentioned,  I do agree with  doubling the lemon filling recipe portion in order to achieve perfection.

This was awesome! I did tweak it a little. I doubled the recipe, because we are taking some to family tomorrow, but I upped the filling by 1/2 again. I added lemon rind of 2 lemons, a teaspoon of vanilla, and a 1/2 teaspoon of salt, as I used salted butter. Then I sprinkled it with about a half a cup of blueberries. I also put the juice of 4 large lemons in it, which was roughly double the lemon juice. Yummy!!

This is a delicious lemon bar.  I made the filling plus half again for more filling.  Delicious.  So easy. Little puzzled about the baking powder.  Did not put in crust but did in filling.  Did not indicate it should be in crust.

I made these last night and doubled the recipe. The only thing I would say is that if you only follow the amount of lemon juice stated in the recipe and you like a serious lemon flavor you will need to add ALOT more lemon juice. I added more (1/4 cup) and the lemon flavor was still very subtle. Overall, this is a good recipe. My kids really loved them.

I made a couple alterations to this recipe based on the equipment and ingredients I had on hand plus some other reviewers' critiques. First, I used fresh lemon juice and added lemon zest. (I used organic lemons, 2, because they aren't coated in wax.) This left me with extra juice so I also increased the filling as some people suggested (double the juice, flour, baking powder and an additional egg and 1/4 C. of sugar.) Second I added 4 minutes to the crust bake time since I was using a Pyrex 8x8 pan. Third I used a stick blender because, well, it's fun to use.

If I were to make this again, which is unlikely, I would almost double the crust bake time and quadruple the topping.

I am a strong believer in just following a recipe. I did everything to the letter and the bars turned out great! I found the ratio of crust to filling to be perfect. Love this recipe and look forward to making it again!

These lemon bars are excellent.  I made the crust per the instructions, used a 9x9 greased pan and baked 15 min, doubled the filling ingredients and baked for an additional 25 minutes.   I prefer more lemon filling....so this was perfect. The flavor of the filling is not a tart make you pucker flavor, but a smooth fresh lemon in my opinion.  Thanks for posting.

Cooked as per the recipe, but added a meringue topping which I very lightly striped into the lemon mix to marble it slightly before baking,  I think this made it slightly too sweet and killed a bit of the lemon twang, but everyone else loved it.  Next time f I add the meringue I will add more lemon juice to compensate.

I will make these again but with less crust and more filling. Very tasty-but the proportions were all wrong in my opinion. If you want to keep these to a smaller pan, I'd suggest half the crust. With some trial and error changes I think this is a really good start.

Fantastically delicious!!!! Made this at least 4 times already and each time this dessert has been a HUGE crowd-pleaser. They still continue to ask me when's the next time I'll make this again! I agree with some of the suggestions from other reviewers about either doubling the filling recipe or cutting in half the crust recipe for a more balanced end result.

Have made this only adding more juice from the real lemon that I used the zest from (2 lemons) and a dash of lime juice, other wise I double the recipe (using 9x12  pan) and follow as directed! It never lasts more than a day...everyone's fav!!!

Thanks so much Ingrid for posting this recipe! I had a recipe like this one that I had gotten out of a magazine but it had gotten lost, so I was so happy to find a recipe that is just like the other one! And thanks to the reviewers who suggested putting 1 and a half servings of filling instead of one. It was just the right amount. ( I left the crust the same serving size though). It was great with a scoop of ice-cream on top!! My mom loved these as well.

I followed the recipe exactly.  After reading reviews about too little filling, I was sure to use the blender, as recommended in the original recipe. The original also calls for just an 8x8 square pan.  The original recipe has plenty of filling if you follow the exact directions.  However, something went dreadfully wrong.  My lemon bars tasted like salty scrambled eggs.  Yuck.  The crust was good...like a tea cookie.  But the filling was just all wrong.  I'll have to try it again.

This recipe was delicious!  Loved the taste of the crust with the lemon custard.  Because some other reviewers suggested making more lemon filling, I did as well, and the result was great.  I just took the ingredients for the lemon filling and multiplied them by 1.5 to get a little extra filling.  Delicious! This recipe is a keeper.

I'm in love with this!  I followed all of the instructions exactly except one thing - I added 5 tablespoons of lemon instead of the 3 and 1/2 tablespoons.  This gave it just the right "punch" of lemon.  I tastes great!!!!

this was a great recipe. it was the first time ive ever made lemon bars. I made them for easter. And they were gone. I did put them it in a bigger pan for a thinner crust and i also doubled the filling.  I shortened the crust cooking time by a few minutes and cooked the filling a little longer since it was doubled.

If you love super "lemony" lemon bars this is not your recipe. I added twice the lemon...and they were good, but lacked that "super tart" taste that I liked. Probable if I had cut the sugar down. I did increase the flour since I did not want them soggy on top.
I used a 10 by 10 pan and there was definitely enough crust for the bottom.
I also make the topping at a ration of 1.5.....so 50% more topping and it was super thin. Will I use this recipe....yes....because the crust was a good taste and held together really well but I will double the topping next time, and increase the lemon juice and decrease the sugar while adding a bit more flour.

I really love these, but I didn't have enough white sugar for the filling, so I used vanilla sugar and it ended more brown than yellow. Besides, I used more lemon than it said to, about 6 spoons, since it wasn't very lemony. The bar is thin, but it's still very good. Really easy to make, too.

These were DELICIOUS and SO EASY. I doubled the recipe, used 1/2 c unsalted butter and 1/2 c applesauce in the crust (and it still turned out nice and crispy). Creamed butter and sugar until fluffy, added applesauce and mixed, added flour and mixed until it firmed up. Divided and smooshed the dough into the bottom of one 9x13 and one 8x11 pan. Baked for 15 minutes at 350. While that was baking, I blended together 6 eggs, 2 1/4 c sugar, 6 tbsp flour, 3/4 tsp baking powder, and 3/4 c lemon juice (yes, you read that right, it was so yummy!). Poured it over the prepared crust, baked another 20 min, sprinkled the top with powdered sugar, and let cool for 15 min before cutting. They were gone within two days. In retrospect, they were quite sweet, so I'd reduce the sugar to 1 1/2 c and sprinkle sparingly with powdered sugar next time, to see how they taste.

1) changed the number of servings to 24 when making the curd 2) added a few extra squeezes of lemon juice, no more than a tsp 3) sides of the pan seemed a tad short so there wasn't enough room for a bit of the curd [also, I didn't know this at the time, but it was about 7 in rather than 8] 4) crust seemed a tad too soft, although the edges were slightly browned. too much butter, too little baking time? 

I followed all the other directions and despite my griping, they still came out wonderful and delicious. I'll definitely make them again =]

This recipe is almost exactly the same as the lemon bar recipe I have been using for years and I love them.  The only change that I make is I increase the lemon juice to suit my family's taste (we like LOTS of lemon flavor).

After reading the reviews, I added extra lemon juice and increased the filling part to 1 1/2 of the recipe. Since there was extra filling, I baked it 10-15 minutes longer thinking that would help the filling set. As the base seemed to be browning a bit, I took it out of the oven and let the bars sit overnight. The center of the filling never set. When I cut into it, the lemon filling ran all over the place! 

I was able to cut off the edges that set and we enjoyed those, but ended up throwing most of the pan away. The part we were able to eat was pretty good.

These lemon bars are excellent. My favorite part is how quick they are to make up. We were invited to a barbeque an hour and a half before it was to start, and I whipped them out with plenty of time to spare. Also, the ingredients are really simple - I never have to worry about if I have everything I need to make them. I don't remember having any problems with the filling or the crust.

These lemon bars are fantastic! So easy to make, and when cut into squares, comes out of the pan beautifully. I might try it again with key lime juice. yummy!!!

Very good lemon bars.  I used half butter and half shortening for the crust and it wasn't heavy at all.

I made this recipe in a pinch after a disatrous outcome from a Bon Appetit lemon bar recipe.  I was having 16 for a casual outdoor dinner and wanted something people could pick up and eat without a fork.  Well these were a huge hit.  I always add a little extra squeeze of lemon to the batter but otherwise followed the recipe to the letter.  This is a classic lemon bar recipe.  Delicious!

These are great!  The topping is firm, not soft and gooey.  Which I prefer.  The crust is tender and not too crumbly.  Thanks for the recipe.

I gave this recipe a 4* rating because they were so strong. When I made the crust i absolutely loved it, because it was thin and tasty. The filling was very thin but thickened up very well. I would suggest putting less lemon flavor in these bars. And don't forget to sprinkle powdered sugar over the top!!!(:

I made this earlier today, and I felt that it needs more butter for the base mix as mine came out very dry and tough, and more lemon to give it some extra kick.  I will try this one again, using my own modifications to the recipe.

These were alright, as lemon bars go. I'm not too particularly fond of bar cookies, but these were passable. They were also a big crowd pleaser, which is a plus. However, I didn't like the crust very much. The filling was good, though, but not as lemony as I would have expected. When I made this, I also added a tablespoon of lime juice into the filling. I probably won't make this again.

These were great!  Not too lemony, perfect crust.  And by mixing in the blender, they were really easy to make. I used electric beaters to beat butter mixture for crust.

I thought these were good and very easy to make - my family also really liked them.  But, I didn't think they were very lemony, so next time I'll add a little more lemon juice.  Also, be sure not to overcook them, it makes the lemon part too dry on the edges.

This recipe was so simple and so delicious.  I've passed it on to quite a few people and they all agree.  I prefer the bars without the powdered sugar and just a touch more lemon.  Just fantastic!

Excellent lemon bars. I add some lemon zest to them from ready previous reviews about them not being "lemony" enough. After I add the zest and whipped it in the blender I just put it through the strainer before pouring it into the pie. Yummy!
