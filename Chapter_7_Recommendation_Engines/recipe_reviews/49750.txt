Take out one Tablespoon of milk and add the same amount of red wine Vinegar and you have a really tasty winner.  OR add lots of garlic powder...or add a couple BIG shakes of paprika.  Good basic or Base for lots of jumps for any flavors you like.  Add pepper and Bacon bits and you have a great bacon dressing.

Red wine vinegar, a pinch of sugar, lots of garlic and freshly ground pepper makes this dressing a real winner.

I added some garlic powder and the end result was yummy. This was one of the best dressings I have ever had. I love that I will always have the ingredients on hand. No more bottled garlic dressing for me. Thanks 1,0000 for posting this great dressing!

5 stars after I tweaked it (4 before).  Use the posted recipe as a base, add 1 tsp dried oregano, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp onion powder, 1/4 tsp paprika, and to thin it a little 1 or 2 tablespoons of olive oil (to your desired consistency).  Whisk it briskly and refrigerate for a while before use.  Excellent on any garden-type salad.

Used light real mayo, 1tsp red wine vinegar, minced garlic, salt and pepper and a lot more skim milk.  This is good and very thick as written.  The added ingredients really put this one over the top.  This would also be great as a turkey or ham sandwich spread.  My hubby is going to try it on his french fries.

This recipe as mentioned in the review before was very mayonnaisey...but I think by using this as the basic ingredient to any salad dressing you can create any salad dressing according to your taste...what I did was add in some dried or fresh herbs like basil,oregano or mixed herbs....each herb gives a different kick to the dressing.So...experiment!!

I added garlic and a little oregano to the dressing and used it on a chicken pasta salad. It was great! Very mild but still flavorful. Thanks!

My mother made this dressing and would pour it over shredded lettuce, chopped green onions, diced cucumbers and diced tomatoes.  This is what I always called Comfort Dressing. lol

Great starting point. I added smoked paprika, which my kids think tastes like bacon. If you like mayonnaise based dressing, it's a great basic recipe. Go forth and experiment! There are so many ways to make this recipe great!

Great basic recipe. Depending on my mood I have added smoked paprika, garlic, onion powder, Splenda, oregano, etc., all to taste.

I will concur with other reviews that this recipe as written is bland. However, using this recipe as a base for your gifted talent is superb! I will go with 4 stars because of the simplicity and ease of customization! Thanks!

Instead of salt I went with 1/8 teaspoon of bacon salt and added 1/8 teaspoon of garlic salt. I had this over a bacon, lettuce, and tomato salad. Was the right dressing for salad.

Excellent. Sole and tasty mom used to make this.  For a tangier version try miracle whip instead of mayo.

The recipe was ok. I thought it was really thick. I added a little more milk and some garlic to it. Probably nothing I would make again.
