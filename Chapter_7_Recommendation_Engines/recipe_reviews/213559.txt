I read through the reviews before I made this recipe. I did double the recipe BUT I cut the flour back by half (two cups for a doubled recipe). I did use vegetable oil instead of olive oil only because I didn't have enough on hand. Good basic pancake recipe that turned out very fluffy pancakes.

This is a very good recipe. The only thing I changed was adding a little more sugar and a pinch of salt. As for the batter being too thick, well, didn't the author say that flour was to be added little by little until the batter reaches the desired thickness? I used about 1 1/4 cups the first time and even less than that second time (probably about one cup).

This recipe definitely turns out great as is, minus 1 cup of flour (maybe its a typo?).  Other than that, my wife loves these and the recipe yields us about 6 large (think Denny's) fluffy pancakes.

Makes about 10-12 small very fluffy pancakes.  I added about a fourth cup more milk than the recipe called for to thin the batter out a bit.  One child loved them, one child thought they were too thick.  These were easy to make and I will use this recipe again.

The batter was way too thick, so we DOUBLED the milk amount. They still turned out thick and tasted like thick cardboard.

The recipe does state to add flour a 1/2 cup at a time until you reach your desired thickness.  I added about 1 1/3 cups of flour.  I also added 1 tsp of salt to bring out the flavors.   That might be why some reviewers found there pancakes to be bland.   I used 1 tsp of vanilla and a shake or  two of cinnamon.  They turned  out great.   I only rated three stars because I had to spice it up a bit.

I thought they were good. The batter was too thick at first, so we added about another 1/4c milk. They were very puffy and delicious.

Just made these pancakes for breakfast. Very thick. I had to thin out the batter with more milk. Next time I make them I won't use as much flour. We loved them. Tasted great!

Please fix the flour typo.  These came out like biscuits, and then I read the other reviews and I hadn't read about adding flour gradually...ugh!  Also, definitely needs salt, but worth trying and customizing to your liking. ; D
