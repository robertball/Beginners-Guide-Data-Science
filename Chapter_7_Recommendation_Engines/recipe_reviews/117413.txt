Delicious....I love beans and this was right up my alley. I only used 1 can of organic cannellini beans an reduced the olive oil to 1 tblspn. I also sliced my red onion really thin. I used fresh red bell pepper instead of the roasted red peppers. All in all, I really liked this dish, very healthy and tasty. Will make again. Thanks!

I made the recipe as stated and I thought it was missing something.  I ended up adding a clove of garlic (minced) and enjoyed it a lot better.  Definitely let these flavors meld for a day before serving.

I used this recipe to make a hummus-like spread.  I sauteed onion and garlic and added them with 1 roasted red pepper to the food processer.  Pulsed until smooth then added one can of beans.  The spread was tasty on grilled portabellas and toasted pita chips.

I was somewhat surprised and disappointed with this, especially since it is a simple recipe with ingredients I like and the basic olive oil and vinegar dressing I like - and even though I modified that dressing to the 3:1 oil to vinegar ratio I prefer.  I would have liked a lighter, white wine vinegar with this or even lemon juice.  Also, this is rather flat tasting and even after adding copious amounts of garlic pepper and extra salt it still was rather one dimensional.  It's pretty, I'll give it that, and definitiely healthy,  but it could use a little tinkering, at least for my tastes.  In addition to a 3:1 ratio of oil to vinegar, I'd use less of the dressing overall.  A little garlic power or VERY finely minced garlic might add a burst of flavor.  Also, this needs some contrast in textures, since the beans and the roasted peppers are both mushy. Some sliced celery would give it some crunch and sliced fennel might be interesting.  Unfortunately, this salad will probaby end up toward the back of the refrigerator shelf, kind of forgotten.

Thanks for sharing this recipe.  I have taken this dish to several potlucks and cookouts.  Numerous people have asked me for the recipe - even people who don't usually eat beans.  When I am in a hurry I do the vinaigrette, the beans, and the ground black pepper.  This is a keeper!

I made this and added diced raw zucchini, crumbled feta, diced white onion (instead of red), diced fresh red pepper (instead of roasted) and chopped celery; added two cloves crushed garlic to the dressing and doubled the oil/vinegar to compensate for all the additional ingredients.  It was delish!  The cheese really adds a nice flavor to it.  I think it will become one of my new lunchtime salad recipes.

This was quite tasty. I normally don't alter a recipe at all the first time, but I didn't roast the peppers, and omitted onions and I also used white wine vinegar. It was good like this, but I must admit, if I had roasted the pepper and added onion, it would have definitely been a 5 star :)

LOVED this bean salad. Easy, nutritious and delicious. I substituted finely chopped sweet vidalia for the red onion, added some finely minced fresh garlic and increased the proportions of beans and dressing. The colors are beautiful and the fresh basil is so delicious. I did go the lazy route and used jarred roasted red peppers which I diced, rather than cut in strips. Will definitely make this again!

4 stars only because I substituted in the recipe. I used Good Seasons Italian salad dressing instead. It was excellent and the recipe is definitely a keeeper.

very easy if you use jarred red peppers, which i did.  i also used basil in the tube available now (called gourmet garden and in the produce section), sliced my red onion very thin due to my preferences.  it was a tasty simple side.  i think next time i will try it blended as a dip/sandwich spread.

Delicious!  I used sun-dried tomatoes instead of red peppers, but next time I'm planning to use the red peppers instead.  I made it one night and had it for lunch the next day and it was amazing.  Can't wait to try it again!

This is a nice, colorful and healthy salad. It does need to sit to let the flavors meld. It's really good.

Wonderful and very fresh for the summer time.  I used Roasted Red Peppers in a jar and it came out great.  Will definitely make this again.

So easy and quite tasty!  I made this to take to work for lunch and it was great.  I used a large jar of roasted red peppers, skipped the red onion (due to my personal preference) but added garlic powder and onion powder.  Tastes like summer!  And it's really quite healthy.  Thanks for the recipe!

Easy to make and delicious!  A great salad to bring to a potlatch.  Didn't have a red onion so substituted a regular one and it still tasted good.  Doesn't make a ton, so I'd double it if serving to a group larger than four.  Very flavorful, though not as much the next day.

This is a great base recipe to use as a pallet to make something that suits your taste buds. I used one can canellini and one can red kidney beans and the roasted peppers from the jar. I also added 1 tsp of minced garlic from the jar. Made it at night and had it with lunch the next day...GREAT!
