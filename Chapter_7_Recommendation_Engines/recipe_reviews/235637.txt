I was looking for something to do with some leftover pork chops when I came across this recipe. I skipped steps 1 and 2, but followed the rest of the steps as directed. When the sauce was done, I added the cooked pork chop medallions and heated them through. The dish was a huge hit with my family and I will definitely use it again.

I wanted to like this recipe so much, but it fell flat. I think the best way I can describe it, is that this is a "school cafeteria" version of a marsala. I loved the idea of using turkey breast cutlets, and will probably use them again, but this just wasn't what I was looking for. Trust me, take the time a make an actual marsala sauce, it will be worth it in theend. While this wasn't horrible, I definitely wont make again.
