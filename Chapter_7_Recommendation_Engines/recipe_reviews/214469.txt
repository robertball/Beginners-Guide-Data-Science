So simple, yet so good! If you're looking for a quick and easy dessert you've found it. I cut back on the sugar and next time I might use brown sugar for a different flavor. I added a spash of vanilla and left some of the strawberries whole. Quick and tasty!

This was very simple and delicious.  I let my strawberries sit for about 15 minutes in the sugar and they released a lot of liquid in that time, and I was afraid it would make the cream runny but it was fine.  Next time I'll kind of combine everything quicker or I may mix the sugar with the sour cream next time and just stir in some sliced strawberries.  Still, I liked this a lot. Thanks jazmin!

would have been a 5 if it were thicker. I think I decrease the sour cream/Greek yogurt next time. I follow others suggestion and did a half and half of sour cream and Greek yogurt mix.

I cut the sugar in half and could have used even less to suit my family's taste, but the blend of flavors from the berries and sour cream is great.  Thanks for the idea.

This was AWESOME. The whole family enjoyed it. I followed everything exactly and it turned out great only wish I had is that it would stay fluffy. We had some left over (very little) and it was less fluffy the next morning- but still just as delicious. Will make this again... and again...and again! GREAT with pound cake.

Similar to what my family has made for years. We use less sugar and add a little cinnamon powder.

I used only 1 cup of sugar and 1 cup sour cream, 1 cup greek yogurt (regular kind).  It was fantastic.  

I also made this the same way, but folded in a 1/2 pint of cream, whipped with some vanilla and a few tablespoons of powdered sugar.  That version was a little fluffier, a touch sweeter.  It was even better, but a little more work.  Both versions were crowd pleasers.  Served with whip cream, blueberries and strawberries, this was a perfect 4th of July dessert.

I have used this with brown sugar before, and RASPBERRIES!  Now that is decadent!  Love it with the strawberries, too.

I added a dollop of organic vanilla yogurt, chopped banana, grapes, and crushed pineapple, because I only had 8 strawberries left.  My family loves it!

I use brown sugar and all types of fresh, in-season fruit. This is great either as a light dessert or a fruit salad side dish.

I also did a half and half mixture of light sour cream and half plain greek yogurt, a splash of vanilla extract.  Instead of the sugar, I used Truvia, a 0 calorie natural sweetner.  Reduces calories by alot .  We have this for breakfast, snacks, and desserts.  My whole family loves it.

Easy peasy and delicious.  I use less sugar though.  1/2 to 3/4 cup instead.  I even made it with cottage cheese when I ran out of sour cream.  It was just as good.  LOVE this one.

The taste is amazing and the consistency is still good enough to serve.  But it's much too liquid - it should be more solid and fluffy.  I wondered if I was crushing the strawberries too much?  But the recipe called for them to be completely crushed, so...

Yum!  This is very similar to a dish called Grapes Romanoff where you use grapes (obviously ;-) and brown sugar instead of white sugar.  Just mix the sour cream and brown sugar and serve over grapes.  Also amazing with blueberries.  Super simple, quite elegant and absolutely delicious!  Great for a company meal.  I'd make both this recipe and the Romanoff again for company...

As suggested in some other reviews, I used brown sugar instead of white and added a bit of vanilla. I used it as a sort of sauce over thick slices of banana bread - Delicious!

Oh so wonderful! The only thing I changed is I put the strawberries and sugar in a chopper then mixed in the sour cream. Making it again I will likely reduce the sour cream a little. Thanks!

It was ok, I mashed up the strawberries and put them in the fridge until after dinner as it said serve it immediately, and added the sour cream when we were ready to eat it.  However, this made it very runny.  We added a scoop of cool whip to it, which was an added bonus.  I suppose runny like that, if we had short cakes, it would have made it better

I love the receive, but I would cut back a bit on the sugar next time.
