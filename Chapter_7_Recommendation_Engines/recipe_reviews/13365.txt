It didn't get thick enough, but you can add rice flour to make it thicker.  Also, honey makes it tasty.

Really interesting flavor on this - I used chicken stock for the first run but I think I might try water for the second.  I put my rice and pine nuts through the food processor since I'm currently sans blender and liked the texture of the final mix so I think I'll just stick with that.  I shared with a friend who kind of likened the flavor to something close to oatmeal.  I'm not sure I quite agree - this is subtley sweet in a way similar to oatmeal, but it's also something quite a bit different.  I will definitely be enjoying this again!
