I made these cookies for my 2003 Oscar party as an ode to 'Chicago' -- the Best Picture Winner. They turned out to be a little flat, but they were still big winners! I think I may have over-beat them as I used a stand-up mixer. Next time, I'll beat by hand. In addition, I used M&Ms mini-candies instead of the regular-sized ones. The cookies looked like they were made with Fruity Pebbles cereal; they were colorful and dee-lish!

I found only one problem with this recipe, when it is to go on a unprepared cookie sheet, I don't have the slide off kind, maybe that would have helped, they are very tough to remove from the sheet, I tried to spray the cookie sheet with Mazola, but that made the cookies too spongy, otherwise I think it would be easier if you had a teflon slide off cookie sheet.  If I ever get one I'll try this recipe again.

Otherwise it is a good cruncy baked cookie!!!

I really didn't care for these cookies.  It almost seemed like there was something missing in them.  They were crispy, which was good, but this was the first time I only used half the batter in a cookie recipe and threw away the rest.  I just didn't enjoy how they were coming out.

I made these using 1 1/2 cups white sugar and 1 cup of brown sugar and skipped the water hoping to avoid the flat cookie others were mentioning. Also chilled the dough. Didn't work. They tasted good and were crispy, like the DH prefers. Was planning on making another batch to use up my other bag of Kissables. Think I'll look for another recipe instead...
