I modified this recipe for the slow cooker and it turned out great. I put two 10oz cans of diced tomatoes with green chilies (I omitted the red pepper flakes), onion, garlic, extra chicken broth and a can of black beans with all the spices and meat into the slow cooker on low for six hours. I added in the zucchini and summer squash, removed the chicken breasts and shred them on a plate with two forks, stirred them back in and cooked it for another two hours. Came out delightfully moist and flavorful. No need to thicken it up at all. Wonderful and lo-carb friendly. I will be making this again. Thanks!

This stew came out fantastic! I did make some minor changes. I used only chicken for meat, used red pepper flakes, paprika, Italian seasoning blend, fresh rosemary, salt, and pepper to season, and I only had grape tomatoes on hand so I cut those in half.  The cooking time allows all the flavors to blend nicely.

This was AWESOME!  The only change I made was adding Italian meatballs to it.  I didn't have enough chicken, and I had some frozen meatballs, so I put the chicken I had plus meatballs in it, and it was really good.  My husband loved it and even my 4 little ones loved it.  This is definitely a family favorite that we're going to be eating again and again.

This was excellent!  I cooked the meat in my pressure cooker first and then added the vegetables and simmered them.  This is a keeper!
