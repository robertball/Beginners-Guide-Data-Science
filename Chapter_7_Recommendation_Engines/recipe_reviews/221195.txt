This was a nice way to use leftover ham.  I like that it's easily thrown together w/freezer/pantry staples.  I'm not a fan of the way the pasta absorbs all of the dressing, though.  If I made this again, I think I'd dress it just prior to serving.  I also chose to use dill relish, as opposed to sweet, per personal preference.  THANKS for the recipe!

10-23-15  ~Not too bad just as is, but even better embellished with things that sound good to you or to use what you've got in the fridge.  In my case, since I was only making this for Hubs and me, it didn't  make sense to open a jar of pimiento even tho' I know that would have contributed excellent flavor.  I substituted red bell pepper which added the same bright red color as well as some additional crunch.  The sweet pickle relish didn't move me, but I agreed it could use a little flavor punch so I added some Marie's Ranch Salad Dressing along with the mayonnaise.  I love raw onion, but didn't add it as I didn't want to taste it hours later!  I didn't measure anything, just added ingredients in amounts that looked right to me.
