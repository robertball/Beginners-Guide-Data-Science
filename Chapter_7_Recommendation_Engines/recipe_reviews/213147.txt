Yum!  I did adjust the recipe a tad, but even leaving it as is, I'm sure is great and OH SO EASY!  I breaded (bread crumbs and seasonings) my chicken and browned in a little olive oil before adding to the 13x9 dish with the sauce.  I also used an Italian blend cheese rather than just Mozz and Parm.  That's all I changed though and it was simply perfect!  My husband loved it as well!  It's a keeper!

This is a great starter recipe.  I have a large family of 6.  I took this recipe as a base.  I sliced the chicken into medalions and layered sauce (Four Chesse Pasta Sauce) chicken and cheese (Moz and chedder) sprinkeled each layer with pepper and garlic and served over fetuccini noodles.  The kids loved it.  My older daughter is vegetarian and used the sauce on her tofu and said it had lots of flavour.

This was really really good, but would have been awesome if I would have added some garlic powder to the sauce!

Nice and amazingly simple dish to whip up and serve.  After reading a bunch of reviews I ended up breading and sautéing the chicken just a bit before putting in the sauce.  I simplified the whole cheese process by just buying a 2 cup bag of Italian Blend.  Since the recipe is so simple, I did assume that seasoning would be necessary; and it was.  I sampled half-way through cooking and felt that it needed it.  I added some garlic salt and a few herbs.  Although I gave it four stars, I will make it again for sure when in a pinch.  It definitely beats meals in a jar or “meal helpers”.

We had friends over last night, and I made this.  Everyone really liked it.  I servied it with spaghetti and some steamed corn on the side.  The only complaint was that there weren't any leftovers!

Great!  As a very experienced cook who has made many versions or chicken parm, I was skeptical that such an easy recipe would work.  It did!

Use filleted (sliced in half the long way) breasts.  I still had to bake an extra 10 minutes, but I used a foil throw-away pan, so that may be why.

This chicken took about one minute to prepare and tasted great without all those calories from bread crumbs.  Couldn't be easier.  My husband was very happy with it.

Delicious and seriously EASY.  Do yourself a favor and cut your breasts in half so they are nice and thin and you will have wonderful tender peices of chicken to eat.

Tasty and easy recipe! My whole family loves it. I like to sneak in veggies with it... mushrooms go great with this, and spinach is good too. This will be a regular at our house. Thanks!

Love this I also  made it easy I love the crock pot so I put the Chicken breast in the crock pot with a can of chicken broth and cooked on low all day while at work. The chicken just falls apart so I layer the bottom of the pan with the chicken I did the rest as the directions said all but cooking time I only baked for 10 minutes. I did add more cheese because my family loves cheese also if you do not have the crutons I have crunched up crackers melted a little butter and dripped over crackers and baked 
Very Good

Our family loved this!  It was delicious and easy to prepare.  Will add my own touches next time, maybe adding mushrooms to the sauce.  We liked the parm cheese in the sauce, and on top of the chicken.  Very tasty!

For the simple ingredients, prep and cook time, this recipe rocks!  I did add some fresh minced garlic to the pasta sauce, to add some flare.  All my children ate and loved it...and they're hard to please!  Thanks for sharing!

A pretty good starter!  I dipped the chicken in an egg and then covered in Italian bread crumbs before putting in the pan with sauce and cheese.  Served on egg noodles...husband and kids ate it up!

This is an easy to put together meal that the whole family will love!  As a busy mom with a gluten intolerance, I loved that this meal could easily be made Gluten free by using Gluten-free pasta since the chicken is not breaded!  Tasted delicious too!

I cut the chicken into smaller pieces so it would be cooked through. I also added some fresh basil, garlic, Italian seasoning, and crushed red pepper. Served with a green salad and angel hair pasta. Will definitely make this again. So easy!

This was amazing.  I used the thin chicken cutlets and prefer those over the large breasts.  I might even throw some meatballs or sauage in the pan next time.

Very good.  Added garlic powder and extra mozarella cheese, but kept itball the same.  Very, very good.

Whole family liked this. Used 2 cups of shredded multi-blended cheeses & more chicken pieces, so added a can of low-sodium diced tomatoes to augment fluid.

It IS easy, but I prefer my chicken parm with breaded chicken.  Buy the Perdue breaded chicken - already cooked.  Can add some frozen chopped onions & peppers.  This recipe would probably work with another sauce, too, such as cream of chicken (or cream of mushroom) soup, or one of those Progresso sauces.

The first time I made this I was disappointed. I believe this is a good basic recipe for an Italian style meal. With only 6 teaspoons parmesan in it I couldn't even taste it. I also had to bake it much longer than 30 minutes. I only had 4 chicken breasts in it as well.

I decided to give it another try last night. I coated the chicken with parmesan first. Then used about 3/4 of a jar of sauce. I sprinkled about a cup of parmesan over that. I baked that for 30 minutes. Took it out and added the mozzarella to it. I lowered the temperature to 325 and baked it another 30 minutes because I had large Amish chicken breasts. The mozzarella was nicely browned and bubbly. To us it tastes more like parmesan chicken this way. I think next time I'll make my own sauce for it though. There will be much less sodium that way.

Such an easy and tasty meal.  I cut the cooking time down by 5 minutes because my oven runs hot.  Other than that, I followed the recipe.  Chicken was juicy and the flavor was great.  I can see myself experimenting by adding other ingredients/spices to this recipe.

Definetly cut the large chicken breasts in half, otherwise they won't cook in 30 minutes.

This was so easy.  I was afraid that it wouldn't be as tasty because the bread crumbs were missing. I was wrong. Five kids gobbled it up!  We will definitely make this one again.

I made this for the first time today and it was surprisingly delicious and easy to prepare. I used 4 chicken breasts instead of 6. I also sprinkled the mozzarella cheese on it before I baked it and again after it was done. I would recommend a nice leafy salad to accompany this dish!

I'm definitely making this again!

For the amount of time and effort, this meal *really* gets the job done.  Chicken Parmesan isn't something I would order dining out so this dish isn't anything unique.  I'm not even a huge fan of "Italian" cuisine.  However, like I said, for the amount of effort it is certainly tasty and gets the job done and in a nutritious way.  So that's why I give it 5 stars.

The tomato sauce I used was flavored with garlic and basil so I was fine using dried basil.  I used a square glass baking dish and used only 4 breasts, perfect size for my family.  It all turned out great.

This is a recipe I will definitely be able to make from memory.  So while I'm at the grocery store fretting about dinner, I can easily remember all the ingredients and whip it up in no time.

This is tasty, super easy,  and SO much healthier than breading and browning the breasts first. In fact, at 20% fat ( actually 24% but I lowered that by tweaking  amount of cheese used) it fits within many  heart healthy diets. Boneless, skinless chicken brests and the sauce aren't loaded with fat. A keeper. I have sometimes used Stephanie's Freezer Spaghetti Sauce and find it especially good but it is still yummy if you don't use a homemade sauce.

I made this for my family one night after a long day at work. It is so simple but was a hit with my entire family. I served it with garlic pasta and my husband had it for lunch the next day. A great weeknight dinner and a great way to get my family to eat more chicken.

Delicious! My son and my husband loved it and they can be picky. I altered things according to our taste, but this is a great base recipe and SO easy. I used a jar of red sauce and a jar of alfredo sauce together, no shredded cheese. I also added mushrooms and onions. I served it on veggie rotini noodles with green beans. A definite keeper!

Chicken was perfectly cooked; moist and tender with good flavoring from the sauce.  I used boneless thighs instead of breasts and used a modified version of "Easy Pizza Sauce I" from this website instead of pasta sauce,  I also added some chopped spinach to the sauce.  What I made probably isn't Chicken Parmesan but it was easy and tasted a whole lot better than the poorly done Chicken Parmesan I've had in restaurants.

I just made this and it was my first time making any type of chicken parm dish.  It was SO easy, and for a weeknight meal that's what I need. It was delicious. I cooked slightly longer but otherwise didn't change much. Definitely recommend. Easy to modify for larger or smaller number of people.

We really liked this.  I was desperate for dinner one night and this did the trick in a flash.  I cut the chicken super small to cook it fast and the fam licked that dish clean!

Recipe is pretty straightforward, chicken  Parmesan  for dummies, you can see in the reviews," kids love it","believe it or not high schoolers love it", guess what, they'll eat anything!!!! I wouldn't call this cooking, flavor is minimal, for a speedy no brainer, its ok , bring on the garlic bread, you're done

This recipe was great! I used an Italian Cheese blend in place of only mozzarella cheese and it still came out great.

This is exactly what is says, EASY.  It was a great recipe to have my daughter help with for her first time cooking. We  used really good mozzarella and Parmesan and it was delicious!

Wouldn't rave about it. But it is a great option if you are trying to skip out on frying your traditional chicken Parm. It was simply and easy and Im sure I will make it again at some point
