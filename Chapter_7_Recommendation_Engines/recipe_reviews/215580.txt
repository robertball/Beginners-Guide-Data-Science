I was a bit hesitant of this unusual combination of ingredients, but I was pleasantly surprised! I'm a big fan of fresh fruit and veggies and this recipe sounded just different enough to work. It is such a fresh salad, perfect for a summer picnic. If you like the sweet-salty combination, then I think you will like this. The fresh mint is the key ingredient, in my opinion. I could only find red tomatoes, so I used those, but I really wanted a color contrast. I found some tomatillos and decided to give that a try. The tart flavor of the tomatillos turned out to be a great addition.

What a surprise! I was mostly curious about the flavors coming together, and was surprised that they came together very well! I used red onion because I didn’t read the recipe well, and it was too strong, and I sliced them too thick. My fault. Also, my store doesn’t carry heirloom tomatoes, but I think you really want them or you can’t tell the watermelon from the tomatoes.

I did not add the salt, and used fresh mint and basil.  No other seasonings - it was very good - it was a refreshing hit.

Didn't have heirloom tomatoes, maybe that was the issue.  Didn't care for it.
