This was one of THE simplest parmesan recipes out there, and pretty tasty too. I don't like how it came out fried in the pan though, and simmering makes the crumbs too moist.  It is much better (and frankly, easier) to put the breaded breasts on a foil-lined cookie sheet, spray liberally with cooking spray, and bake about 15-20 min or til juices run clear. Then, remove, and top with warmed sauce and cheeses, bake til cheeses are melted and serve. This saves on fat grams too!

A nice recipe!  I used 7 herb ragu for the sauce and added parmesan cheese (1/4 c) and 1/2 teas. italian seasoning to the crumbs.  I also baked everyone thing in the oven after browning the chicken. It was better than an italian restuarant!!

This was the first time I ever made Chicken Paramesan and I loved it.  The only thing I did that the recipe didnt call for was flour my chicken before I dipped it in egg.  This helps the breading to stick better.  I also browned the chicken in the skillet and then finished it off in the oven.  Was awesome and oh so easy!!!  Will do this one again!!!!

This was fabulous!  I poured the sauce in the dish and then layed the chicken on top so it would not get soggy, then topped with low-fat parmesan.  A keeper...

Very easy and very tasty. I found that I needed to use 2 beaten eggs plus more bread crumbs than called for as the chicken breasts I had were huge. I don't bother with the pan frying, just coat a 13 x 9 pan with cooking spray and place breasts there and bake (350 at 30 minutes). I placed cheese over top last 5 minutes of baking time. Meanwhile I heated up a jar of spaghetti sauce. I placed the chicken on the plate and poured sauce over top and sprinkled with parsley for a beautiful presentation. Served with garlic sticks and salad. Thank you.

Really quick and super easy.  If you use jarred sauce I recommend you use a high quality one or doctor it before adding to the chicken.  Make sure you get the chicken well browned before adding the sauce to keep the coating from getting soggy.

I've made this with both chicken and veal but I like it with veal the best. After I brown the chicken breasts in the frying pan I put them on a plate with paper towels to get rid of the excess grease. Instead of putting them back in the skillet with sauce, I put a thin layer of sauce in a baking pan, then place the chicken on that, then cover with the rest of the sauce and mozzerella cheese. I bake it in a preheated 350 degree oven until the cheese melts. I serve it with rice and put the extra sauce from the pan over the rice and let people sprinkle on their own parmesan. This is one meal I get continued requests for, it's definitely a favorite!

Just a few suggestions - one, if you find that the breading falls off of the chicken when you are cooking it, try patting the raw chicken with flour before you egg-wash it.  Also, adding a little milk to the egg-wash will help the breading stick.

I like to make my own bread-crumb mixture and do so by mixing bread-crumbs with dried parsley, Italian seasoning mix, garlic powder, and parmesean.  Extra cheesy!

Now this is a quick and flavorful chicken dinner. I made my own bread crumbs(not rocket science) I added a litte salt, pepper, oragano, and the parmesan cheese then followed the rest of recipe. Tender, moist, crunchie crust, fast, easy, a real keeper. All you need to sever with it is a crispy salad and warm crunchie bread. Great the next day if you have any leftovers, the flavors have mingled even more.

Very good but I agree with other reviewers not what I would call light. I have made several times different ways browning in butter for company and when it's for family I use no stick spray not quite as flavourful but I know it's better for us without using added fat. I also substitute fat free cheese, and if I am really counting calories I omit bread crumbs not as good but still very moist tender and flavourful with a good sauce( that is really important when making this many changes)

This dish is excellent!  I used chicken tenders and dipped the tenders in flour first.  I also added parmesan and chopped garlic cloves to the breadcrumb mixture.  After browning the chicken for about 3 to 4 minutes on each side, I put them on a cookie sheet in the oven at 350 degrees for about 5 minutes to finish cooking.  Then I placed a little of the sauce (which I made) on the chicken tenders, topped with shredded provolone and Parmigiano and put it under the broiler to melt the cheese.  I coated hot, cooked pasta with the remainder of the sauce.  Definitely a keeper!

Such a simple and good tasting recipe. I dipped the chicken in an egg white only and then the bread crumb mixture. Then I sprayed an aluminum foil covered cookie sheet with non-fat spray and baked the chicken for about 15 minutes. Heated up the sauce separtely and poured over once everything was on the table.

This is very good. The only thing I do differently is add a little more parmesan and mozzerella on top and also add about half a can of diced tomatoes.

We just had this tonight and my hubby said that this is in his top 10 home meals.. so I'm sure we'll be making it again.  My kids (One is very hard to please) both loved it.  I used a jar of Ragu Organic Cheese sauce and added my own seasons to it as well, I used almost the whole jar since we served it over angel hair pasta.  After cooking some in the skillet, I then placed in a baking dish and baked in oven.  I have never made Chicken Parmesan before, and was pleasantly surprised.

This is good and certainly easy but I really have to question how "light" this is for those watching their weight--614 calories a serving!!!Yikes!  For those on weight watchers this is a hefty 12 points before you even serve it with pasta!

For a cleaner fry, I substitued extra virgin Olive Oil for the butter.  I added a pinch of salt to the Italian seasoned bread crumbs(to add back in the saltiness of the removed butter), and about 1/2 teaspoon of crushed red pepper flakes to the sauce.  I followed everything else as is in the recipe.  Such perfect results, my "audience" demanded an encore.  There's no higher praise than that.

This is the best recipe! Better than Olive Garden! I used Pepperidge Farms Zesty Italian croutons in the recipe. It is absolutely tasty and easy to make!!! I also used the Hunts Chunky Garlic and Herb spaghetti sauce, I cannot live without it, it is fabulous! Wonderful!

Wasn't quite sure what made this so "light" in comparison to chicken parm my own way and in the oven. I'll stick to oven cooked as it tastes so much better. Just our opinion though.

I really loved this recipe.  Even though I have made chicken parmesan before and it was just as good, the fact that you only cook with one pan makes the meal faster with less clean up afterwards!!!  Make sure you brown the chicken well so it will not get soggy (mine turned out perfect) and use a high quality and delicious sauce.  I doctored up a cheap can of Del Monte and it was great!!

Final note:  I omitted the mozzarella because I didn't have any AND to less the total calorie content & it was still excellent!!!

This is close to my recipe. I like to add a couple tablespoons of grated aged parmesan to the bread crumbs. I use H.C. Garlic Lovers pasta sauce and top my chicken with provolone cheese during the last 10 minutes of cooking. Serve with Whole wheat spaghetti.

This was sooo great!  I don't know how light it is but it sure tastes good.  The chicken took a long time to cook and I had to use a little more cooking spray when I turned it over but the whole meal turned out beautifully!  Will do it again!

This received a thumbs up from my family who usually rolls  their eyes when I say I'm making  chicken for supper since we have it so often.  This was easy to prepare.  I used my favorite sauce, Bertolli Vidalia Onion, and  served the chicken over some thin spaghetti.  Not bad.  Thanks

This was fabulous! The chicken was soo moist. I made my own bread crumbs by processing two whole wheat slices of bread in the blender then added some italian seasoning. Also before dipping the chicken in egg I marinated the chicken in fat free italian dressing. It gave it a little kick. I also used swiss cheese instead and it was fab! I served with roasted zucchini, peppers and squash. Yum!

Great, simple recipe for a simple dish.  I would suggest that people simply purchase the slightly more expensive chicken tenderloins.  Pressing the chicken to make it thinner sounds weird to me, but maybe that's just my inexperience shining through?  I also needed a bit more spaghetti sauce.

This was great.  Pounding the chicken breast thin is a big key.  They cook quicker and are still nice and juicy.
I didn't have italian flavored breadcrumbs, so I substituted plain and mixed in 1 tbsp. of Pizza Blend Spice (McCormick).  My whole family loved this one, and it was easy too!  A keeper for sure!

This recipe is outstanding! The only thing I do differently is cut up the chicken into strips for easier eating. I also use oil instead of butter and it is just as delicious. A great company dish!

This is so easy to make and is a favorite at my house.  I use half butter and half olive oil to brown the chicken breasts.  Also, I filet the breasts in half so they'll cook faster.  If I have too many for the pan, I layer them and it turns out great!

I was making Chicken Parm for dinner tonight and did not want to put the oven on, and that being the only way I know I needed to find a recipe that game me an alternative.  I am so glad I came across this recipe!  The chicken was very tender.  I did add parmesan and garlic powder to the breadcrumb mixture, and added parsley as a garnish.  I also used my mothers homemade sauce.  It was delicious!  Thank you Cooking Light!!

This recipe turned out perfect!! I too baked the breasts, and skipped the frying. I also added the sauce and cheese in the last 5 minutes. My first time attempting chicken parm and hubby and I were VERY pleased! No leftovers!

Very good.  I also baked in the oven for about 35 minutes and then added the sauce (which I heated on the stove first)and added the cheese on top of that.  Then baked for about 5 more minutes.  Served with a nice green salad.  I did add a lot more cheese on my kids chicken (they do not have to watch their weight :0)  Will make again

This has to be the best chicken recipe ever!!  My husband and I could not get over how moist and tender the chicken was.  I did marinade it in a Garlic and Herb recipe and what great flavor.  If you want a wonderful recipe for chicken, then this is it :)

This recipe was not only delicious, but it was very easy to make!  Prep time is even shorter if you use thin sliced chicken  instead of pounding breast-halves to quarter inch thickness.  I added some garlic powder and some salt to the breadcrumb mixture as suggested from other reviewers.  It tasted like restaurant-style chicken parm...almost better!  This recipe is a keeper!

I thought this was good, but after having it, I would prefer it with the sauce heated separately and added at the last minute. Cooking it with the sauce made it soggy.

I can honestly say, that you can't go wrong with this recipe.~IT'S SO EASY!~ This is the first time I've made chicken parmesan, plus I made it for our friends, they thought I went out to an Italian restaurant and set the food neatly on the plates, but I didn't it's all thanks to this SUPER easy recipe! This is certainly a keeper in the familia, my hubby loved it and even has leftovers for his lunch today!

With a couple of minor adjustments I find this recipe easy and delicious! I use an entire jar of sauce and cut the simmering time to about 7  minutes. After adding the cheese I cover, remove from heat and let stand a few minutes before serving. The chicken remains tender and moist and there is sauce for the pasta I serve it with. Yum!

Depending on the sauce that one uses in this recipe, this is a very good Chicken Parmesan. I'm not sure why they refer to it as light because there are lighter versions out there. In any case, this was very good. My family thoroughly enjoyed it.

This is how I've been making my chicken parmesan for years. You can also bake in 350 oven for about 30 min. Add cheese to top around last 10 minutes of baking time. I use my own homemade sauce with this and serve with pasta. It's wonderful.

Excellent!  Stuffed chicken parmesan is my favorite meal at the Olive Garden.  This recipe comes close enough by itself (or I could stuff it) to give me all the yum and satisfaction of going out to eat.  Easy and way too delicious!  Can't stop eating even after I'm full.

Excellent.  Don't like pounded chicken, so cut in half lengthwise (easier to do if the chicken is still partially frozen), dredged lightly with flour, then breaded as indicated.  Browned until golden, then added 2 crushed cloves of garlic and simmered 15 minutes in sauce (we like to make sure our chicken is done) before adding cheese and melting for 5 more minutes.  Tender, juicy chicken and great sauce.

I took the advise of another reviewer and baked the breaded chicken in the over for 30 minutes. I then added sauce and cheesed and placed back in the over for an additional ten minutes. It came out perfect.

Very very good. Also so easy. I just cooked the breaded chicken in the oven @ 350'C for 30 min (sprayed the pan with PAM), then added heated spaghetti sauce and the cheeses and cooked for 5 more minutes until melted. Came out perfect! I also used the whole bottle of sauce and added garlic and onion powder and some italian seas to the bread crumbs.

This was an awesome recipe, the only thing I changed was that I added more garlic and made sure to cook them on a lower heat for a longer time.  My friend who is the pickiest eater I know adored it, I will make it again and again.

An alltime family favorite for everyone in my family - all ages.  So simple to prepare!  I like to use prepared spaghetti sauce (we like "Sockorooni" sauce by Paul Newman).  You can have it ready in minutes, add a salad and some crusty bread to dip in olive oil and you have a feast!  I do make a slight change, I brown the chicken in olive oil instead of butter.  Enjoy!

I will preface this by saying that I used sauce from a local Italian shop and that really is what probably made this dish so fantastic.  But I also used panko breadcrumbs, which gave it a nice crunch.  A great, super simple dish overall.

GREAT recipe! The only variation I made was to add extra parmesan cheese (approx. 1/4 cup) to the breadcrumbs before dredging the chicken.  I also used 1 T. olive oil and 1 T. butter instead of all butter to fry the chicken.  My frying time was closer to 5-6 minutes each side.  The chicken couldn't have been more tender or better tasting.  Amazingly delicious for such a simple dish!

One of our favorite recipes!  I follow the directions exactly, except that I buy thin sliced chicken breasts to cut down on prep time.  The chicken is crisp on the outside and tender and juicy on the inside.  I just add angel hair pasta and a caesar salad for a quick and delicious meal.

This was FANTASTIC!! Just great. I dipped my chicken in flour, milk (had no eggs) and into a mixture or seasoned breadcrumbs, paprika, salt & pepper and a little grated parmesan. I used a mushroom red wine pasta sauce which was fantastic, also added chopped tomato and next time I will definitely be adding chopped mushrooms but didn't have any on hand today. I also used a very little amount of soy cheese in place of motzarella to cut the fat and that was great too (wish I could eat it with a heap of cheese on it though! must be lovely). My pan was a bit too hot so I only had to cook the sauce in for a couple of mins. Served with some rice and potato veggie patties that I had in the freezer which was lovely but would go great with plain mash, rice or pasta...this was so yum I want to eat it again right now and I've only just had it! Thanks

Excellent. I used Ragu sauce and doctored it up with Oregano, Basil, Garlic Powder, Season Salt and Pepper and Sugar. I also sauteed mushrooms and zucchini and added it to the sauce once it was browned. Before I egged and dredged the chix breasts, I added parmesan cheese to my Japanese Panko bread crumbs.  After the chicken was browned I put the sauce in a baking dish, placed the chicken on top of it along with the cheese and baked it until the cheese melted. Served it with whole wheat pasta.

This recipe has become a favorite.  I've made it several times and it always comes out perfect.  I recommend dipping the chicken twice (egg, bread cumbs, egg again, bread crumbs again) for a thicker, more flavorful coating.  Yum!

This was a great recipe!!! I recently had a baby and don't have much time to cook fancy dinners so this was perfect. My guest was impressed with how wonderful it tasted. It looked like I spent hours on it. The only thing different that i did was I added some paprika to the bread crumbs and used olive oil instead of butter.

I made this recipe last nite for my husband (we had valentines day early) and he was totally impressed!  And so was I!  I used Zesty Italian croutons (Pepperidge Farms) crumbled in the processor for breadcrumbs and used the whole jar of spaghetti sauce (Emirl Homestyle Marinara) because i forgot to look at the recipe.  Even with my too much spaghetti sauce mess up, it was absolutely delicious!!  This recipe was very easy and quick to make.  Chicken Parmesan along with candles and piano music makes a great evening!

This recipe was very tasty, I did make a change with the way it is cooked though.  Instead of frying the chicken, I put it in the oven on 350 degrees for about 45 minutes.  I then added the spaghetti sauce to the top of the chicken as well as the cheese.  I left it in until the cheese melted on top.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!!

Easy and delicious! I didn't simmer the chicken in the sauce because my boyfriend didn't like too much sauce. Instead, after cooking it through in the skillet, I sprinkled the cheese and put it under the broiler until the mozzarella melted. Then I placed the chicken pieces on plates of sauce (a lot  for me, a little for my boyfriend). It was really good!

Simple and easy. My Italian-Canadian husband enjoyed immensely! As several others noted, I prefered to cook the chicken out of the sauce to keep it a little crispy on the outside instead of soggy....just browned the chicken until cooked through, put on top of a plate of spaghetti with sauce, topped with cheese and briefly stuck it under the broiler to melt the cheese. Doesn't get much simpler!

I thought this was wonderful!1 My husband made this for me and although he used 2 cups of Mozzerella cheese and only browned the chicken on each side then baked it for a half an hour I thought it couldn't have turned out better. Will definitely use this reciepe again!

This turns out fabulously every single time I make it! I've made it for guests on numerous occasions, and they are ALWAYS impressed:-) I buy the thin cut chicken breasts so I don't have to pound them.

Quick, easy, and good enough to make for dinner again and again.  Two out of three kids ate it (a definite hit), my 4 yr. old son said, "This is *good*, Mom!" and it was a great accompanyment to some spaghetti and sauce.  My bf and I gobbled it up, too.  I topped mine with Swiss cheese.

I couldn't believe how easy this was and so yummy! I pounded the chicken breast to 1/4 thickness and covered with flour before dipping in egg. I also sauteed some minced garlic in the butter before browning the chicken breasts. I cooked the breasts for 2 minutes on each side and then placed them in a baking dish, the bottom or which was covered with sauce. Then I piled on the cheese and baked for 20 minutes at 350 degrees. Served on a bed of spaghetti....super fast and good.

This was my first time making chicken parmesan, and this recipe was so quick and so easy!!!  Instead of pounding the chicken to 1/4", I sliced each breast in half lengthwise.  (Holding my knife horizontally I sliced through each breast.)  I also added extra sauce, and I used 2 cups of mozzarella cheese.  This was SOOOO delicious!  It actually tasted like the Olive Garden's.  YUM!!!!

I really liked this recipe. I added more cheese to it and I put it over wheat speghetti. I took off one star b/c it just wasn't 5-star good. However, my roommate would give it 10 stars! He ate 3/4 of it and LOVED it!! He said it was better than the Olive Garden. :)

Very quick and easy.  This probably could have received 5 stars if I had picked a different spaghetti sauce.  The only one I had on hand was an arrabiata-style sauce with lots of chunky peppers.  It didn't complement the chicken very well.  Next time I'll go with a sweeter sauce.  The breaded-chicken by itself was tasty.

This is delicious.  I substituted veal.  If you decide to do the same, learn from my initial mistakes and remember to cook for less time--about 7-8 minutes for the first step with the spaghetti sauce and 3-4 minutes with the cheese.  Also browning will take much less than 2 minutes on each side if you've heated your oil beforehand.

Have made this twice now and a success both times! Didn't have a problem with chicken getting soggy, but i think that's because I think I seared the chicken! Didn't taste burnt even though it looked it. Served over spahgetti and with garlic bread..yummy! a keeper!

I made this recipe for my parents, and although I didn't eat it (I'm a vegitarian) they said it was VERY good.  It was pretty easy and the only thing I changed was the amount of sauce that I cooked the chicken in - I only used about 1 cup.

I found this very delicious and easy to make.  The only problem I encountered was I felt I didn't get enough breading on the chicken.  (I'm honestly not sure I've ever made a breaded item.)  Regardless, the meal was outstanding and even my husband - who doesn't like chicken OR healthy foods - loved it.  I served it over tri-colored pasta.

I thought this recipe was wonderful.  It was super easy and tasted great.  I used a sauce especially made for chicken with a hint of parmesan.  It is very versatile.

This recipe was great! We couldn't believe it was light!! We served over thin spaghetti with crusty sourdough bread.  This one is a keeper!

I liked a crispier crust so I didnt smother it all the way in the sauce...i thought that that would make it soggy. I really liked the chicken though.It was moist and juicy..this ones a keeper...I love the reviews...I get to try other peoples ideas before making the mistake on my own...like the sauce thing...at first I didnt think about the fact that smothering the chicken in sauce would probably make it soggy. thanks

Good recipe to serve with pasta and garlic bread. It was easy and fast, I already had all the ingredients so it was convenient. Next time I won't smother it completely in sauce because I like a crisper outside.  My 4 year old found it too chewy and didn't like it at all (ok, she spit it out)

Very easy to make and very tasty!  I made this recipe in 25 minutes.  I also made pasta as a side.  Make your own sauce for an even more personal meal.  Have fun!

This was really easy and really good! I'm terrible in the kitchen and this was no problem for me. My husband wondered though why use butter instead of olive oil...I have no idea, but it was good!

Family favorite!  But as others have said if you want the breading to stick add flour to the chicken.  Luclily, we don't care for very heavily breaded chicken and it turned out amazing!

One of my favorite recipes on this site!  I make this recipe more than any others.  This is so easy and delicious (and healthy too!)  The first time I made it, my husband didn't believe that I actually made it - he said it tasted like something from Macaroni Grill!!  Thx!!

Very quick, easy and delicious. I love how it's cooked in one pan on the stovetop, which frees up the oven for garlic bread or a yummy dessert. I did need to use more breadcrumbs, but then I also made sure they were coated very well.  Thank you very much for sharing :)

This is very easy. It should be in the quick cooking section too. I was apprehensive to fry instead of bake, but it turned out really good. I used an electic fry pan with a lid. I will make this again. Thanks!

This was great! Even my picky kids ate all of their dinner tonight. I added a can of Italian-flavored diced tomatoes to the spaghetti sauce which added a little extra tang to the flavor. This will be a permanent addition to our dinner calendar.

I added some garlic to the bread crumbs and doubled dipped the chicken, i used tomatoe basil sauce from trader joes, my family ate it up, it was quick and easy and the chicken turned out so tender, it is a keeper and I will make it again, my husband is picky and he loved it.

The only thing I did differently was I doubled the mozarella cheese.  My husband really likes red sauce so he said he would've liked more sauce.  We didn't think this was a very flavorful dish.  Had better chicken parmesan from this site.  Will not make this recipe again.

Excellent!  I was skeptical of cooking chicken parm. on top of the stove, but this turned out perfectly.  The chicken was tender and juicy.  And, I only had one pan to clean after dinner!  The kids liked it, too.  This will be a great meal for summertime when I don't want to heat up the oven.

This went together very quickly (hence the four stars).  Next time, I'll season the breadcrumbs and pan-fry the chicken longer to get it nice and crispy.  I may use less sauce too.

Very tasty!   I added some garlic, but other than that recipe stayed the same, I will definitely fix again.

I made this for my boyfriend last year for Valentine's Day.  He's one of those spaghetti+ground beef+sauce pasta people, but a year later he's still raving about it.  I served it with breadsticks that I twisted into heart shapes!

This is a tasty dish.  But, if you are counting calories, it's really not that light.  If you eat it over 1 serving of pasta that will add about 200 calories.  If you were to add a side salad and a slice of french bread that would put you close to or over 1000 calories.  I'm ashamed to say my meal amounted to a little over 1200 calories.  So now I'm off to burn more calories.

This dinner is fabulous!
I doubled the amount of cheese and simmered it for about 30 minutes.
I fed a family of 4 and used only 2 chicken breast. I cut each breast into 4 pieces and flattened it with a mallet. Everyone ate plenty and there were leftovers. My family loved it!

Excellent!  This is a really flavorful recipe.  I used more than 1/3 cup of breadcrumbs and probably more butter than it called for.  I used a store bought Mushroom-Garlic pasta sauce to simmer it in and served it with whole wheat spaghetti and steamed zucchini.  The chicken breasts, once pounded, were quite large and I had a tough time fitting them all into my skillet, but I managed.  My husband went back for seconds and even my one-year old said "mmm mmm" every time he took a bite of the chicken.  The leftovers (and there were plenty even though we're a family of 4) were still excellent.  This is a keeper.

I made this the other night and it is great simple recipe that takes very little time to complete. Great for those nights when you have very little time to spend in the kitchen. I'll be making this dish again and again.

What a wonderful recipe!  So simple to make, all items I keep on hand, and great taste.  I put my cast iron skillet in the broiler after adding the cheese, so the cheese was a little brown on top - it was perfect.

This was really delicious, I followed the advice of another and warmed the sauce separately. It only lost a star due to my not loving it with the particular spaghetti sauce I used; will have to find an alternate.

Everyone in my family loved this, even my picky little brother.  I added freshly minced garlic to the butter when I cooked the chicken.  Also, instead of making the chicken breasts thin, I bought thinly sliced ones from the grocery store (same price per pound, pretty much).  I also added lots of cheese and extra sauce like other reviewers recommended.

This recipe is great.  It always wows my family that I can make this at home!  The chicken comes out so beautifully tender and the seasonings are just right!  Try this chicken technique without the sauce and use thin strips of chicken for yummy chicken tenders.

This was delicious!  So easy, too!  Start to finish was about 40 minutes.  We served it with whole wheat spaghetti noodles.  The next time I make it I will heat up a little additional sauce in a pan...we like more sauce for our noodles.  Enjoy this one, it's a keeper!

This is the BEST chicken parmesan recipe that I've ever made.  It is so quick, so simple, you can't really mess it up.  The chicken turns out so moist and delicious, this recipe has quickly become a regular in my house.

WOW! I scaled this for two servings and used 1 egg as well as 3/4 cup bread crumbs seasoned. It made more than enough WITH the pasta for 4 people. Thanks so much for sharing!

This recipe was quick and easy. My wife and I really enjoyed this recipe. We didn't doctor a thing and we loved it. Use your favorite sauce and this will be a hit!!! Thank you for the great recipe.

Wow!  I can't believe how easy this recipe is, and how delicious it tastes! I was working with a very tight dinner schedule, and most of the other Chicken Parm recipes required baking for 40 minutes or more. Since this one didn't, I decided to try it. I wasn't expecting much, and was very pleasantly surprised. My husband LOVED this - and he is very picky about his Chicken Parmesan! Absolutely recommend this recipe!

This recipe is absolutely as good as any chicken parmesan served at the Italian restaurants.  MARVELOUS!  I served it over angel hair pasta once, and over fettuccini the next time.  Both pastas worked well with this recipe.

Delicious, didn't put sauce on top though.  Only problem was getting the chicken thin enough.

wonderful recipe.  My fiance wants to eat it atleast once a week.  I followed the tips on putting in the sauce before the chicken...it wasn't soggy at all.

This recipe was awesome -- very easy, and delicious.  My chicken took awhile longer to cook (about 15-20 min. vs. 10 min).  Served it on angel hair pasta -- and it was a huge hit.  Two thumbs up.

I followed the recipe but it didn't quite come out how I had expected it to. The chicken did not cook all the way through. It was also pretty soggy. I was very disappointed!

I think I found our new favorite dinner.  I couldn't believe how easy it was to make and that it was actually a "light" recipe.  I served it over spagetti and garlic bread.  I would recommend this recipe to anybody.  Thumbs up!
