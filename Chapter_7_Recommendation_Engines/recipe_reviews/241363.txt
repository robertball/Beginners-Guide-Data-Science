I made these the traditional ice box cookie way and they turned out very well.

I love the cherry almond combo and had high hopes for this recipe.  But the bars were very dense... I didn't like the consistency.  I had to bake them an extra 10 minutes to get the middle cooked.  I ended up frosting them with almond frosting and topping with half a candied cherry to make them look and tast better.

This was more like a blondie and may be better to remain as a cookie recipe. As the other reviewer correctly assessed, it seemed a bit too buttery.  I might try it as an icebox cookie and i suspect it will turn crispy and better.

The recipe calls for way too much butter. I will not make these again.
