MAYBE TRY USING MINI CHIPS, OR TOSS THE CHIPS WITH ABOUT 3 TABLESPOONS OF THE CAKE MIX...THIS SHOULD HELP THE CHIPS FROM FALLING TO THE BOTTOM.  IF YOU DECIDE TO PUT A CHOCOLATE FROSTING ON IT YOU MAY NOT EVEN NEED THE CHOC, CHIPS!

This was a decent chocolate cake but I didn't think the coffee flavor came through enough.  I'm glad I tried it though b/c the review about mixing the chips with some of the cake mix before adding them to the batter worked very well.

My three star rating is generous - I really wasn't impressed with this at all.  The cake was spongy, a really weird texture. As for flavor, it didn't stand out either as chocolate or of the coffee liqueur, just kind of unremarkable with a surprisingly weak brown color.  I didn't use the chocolate chips at all. I used this for cupcakes and  frosted them with "Chocolate Frosting l" which I didn't care for either.  Kind of a baking bust for me today.

Chocolate chips fell to the bottom.  Anytime you put chocolate chips into a cake or muffin recipe, you need to flour the chips and then put them in.

Super easy to make with pantry ingredients you're trying to use up AND make something sweet for your husband. I used a low-sugar cake mix and fat free plain yogurt instead of sour cream because that was what I had. I didn't bake this in a bundt pan, just in a greased 9x13. Four stars for ease, I'll update my review once my husband has a chance to try it. NOTE: I did frost this with a canned frosting, only because I was trying to get rid of it. He said that he didn't care for the texture but he ate two pieces. So, I guess he liked it.
