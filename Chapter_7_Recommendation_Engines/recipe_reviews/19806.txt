These brought back memories of my childhood.  I wouldn't advise cutting back on the water that much, as they would be too sweet.  My three year old has been devouring these.

Learned how to make this from Grandma when I was a kid. Works great and is less drippy than most ice pops. My kids prefer the watermelon/strawberry combo but I favor the orange kind. NOTE: This also can be made with half the sugar and SF jello and come out just fine. Cheap way to make popsicle makers is using dixie cups and popsicle/craft sticks. Both can be bought super cheaply.

These turned out great and they made aton!  The lids picked the flavors....melon Jello and strawberry Kool-aid.  They mixed up quick and a bonus....the jello keeps them from being too drippy!  Thanks Gareth!

This recipe was great, my only thing that I didn't like was how hard the popsicles were when done.  So the next time that I made them I brought the cold water down 2 cups and just evened it out to 1.5 liters.

These Ice Pops are SO easy to make (and so inexpensive).  My daughter enjoyed helping me stir them up.  Putting them into paper cups is a great idea because the side can be torn down to make eating the pop easy.  I like these best when they sit out for a few minutes before eating -- then they become like the consistencey of a store ice pop.  ENJOY!

My aunt used to make these popsicles and I loved them.  The flavor lasts till the end.

What FUN for kids (ok...I liked them too)!! Very easy to make, and worked well with artificially sweetened jello. I did add a tad extra sugar in case! They turned out exceptionally well made in ice cube trays...filled nearly 4 trays! Simple and rewarding!

My daughter made this and instead of putting in unsweetened, flavored soft drink mix (witch we didn’t have and couldn’t find) she added more jello. There was a big piece of hardened jello at the bottom.

I was sceptical of the idea of jello in my ice pops, but i tried these, and they were great! they tasted as good if not better than store bought! We will never waste money on store bought ice pops again thanks!

I hadn't made homemade popsicles in years and needed something refreshing and simple to beat the 90 degree heat. I thought 2 quarts of water would made the flavor a little weak so I cut the water to a total of 4 cups. Perfect. I had a hard time getting these out of my molds but I am sure it was the fault of the mold and not the recipe. I did have to dip the molds in warm water to release the popsicles. Very simple treat!

Very easy and fast. Made cherry flavored. Only used 5 cups water total and the flavor was perfect. Added only 3/4 cup sugar. Put the liquid in cupcake tins and ice cube trays. Gotta go buy ice pop molds! Shared recipe with friends and family!

Wanted to make this more nutritious for the kids with fruit stuffed inside. Think I'll cut back on the sugar by half next time. Tasty.
