I just finished making a double batch of these wonderful cookies.  I don't understand what other reviewers mean when they say this recipe doesn't make many cookies.  I doubled everything and got 10 dozen cookies!  Even half of that is 5 dozen!  Here are the changes I made:  I put a teaspoon of vanilla and about a cup of finely chopped pecans in the (doubled) batter,  and after rolling into a one inch ball,  dipped each one half way in a bowl containing Sugar In The Raw.  It's light brown, has larger crystals then regular sugar, and very sparkly.  Then I flattened each cookie with the bottom of a glass and put a nice whole pecan in the middle.  They are absolutely delicious and they look wonderful!  These are now on my list to make every year!  Thanks!!.....12/15/09 an update: My last batch is in the oven so I have time for a quick update.  This year I got 16 DOZEN when I doubled everything!  I think it's because of 2 things: refrigerate the dough over night and use a melon baller to scoop out the portions.  BTW, mine took 10 minutes per batch.

Adding vanilla is a must in this recipe.  Refrigerating overnight makes a better dough.  We tried different "add ons", i.e. chocolate chips, cinnamon, powdered sugar, etc. and found that turning this recipe into a Pecan Sandie by adding chopped pecans to the batter, leaving the balls whole for baking and rolling in powdered sugar after baking was the best.  By leaving these in a ball, the cookie was thicker and more cake like, so it would just be your own personal preference to do this.

This is a very good and easy recipe! I dipped my glass bottom in sugar instead of flour.  It gives the cookie more of a sugar cookie taste.  I also put a cherry on top of half the batch of cookies and on the other half I did the pecan.  Definately a good recipe for the holidays and one to keep to use every year.

This is a wonderful, melt-in-your-mouth recipe. I printed it two days ago, and I have already used it TWICE! I would suggest putting sugar on the bottom of the glass as well, it gives the cookies even more flavor! FANTASTIC JOB!

Excellent recipe! The dough comes out very sticky, but do not add more flour! After refrigeration it comes out perfectly. I made that mistake once. Also added 1/2 tsp. vanilla which tasted lovely!

These were a hit at school today! I used the sugar instead of flour to flatten the cookies and added 1/2 tsp of vanilla and 1/8 tsp of almond extrat - literally just a few drops. The cookie sheet does not need to be greased - I tried it both ways and liked the final baked shape of the "ungreased" cookies better.  Cooled on the cookie sheet for about 10 minutes before moving them to a wire rack to cool all the way.

Although I found it a little sweet, my husband loved this cookie so it will be made again.  However, I only got 2 dozen cookies from this recipe, not the 4 it says.

These were so good I could not stop eating them.  I added 1/2 tsp vanilla, added 3/4 cups packed brown sugar, and I chopped up 1/2 of the pecans and added them to the batter.  Instead of flour I pressed the cookies down with powdered sugar using my fingers (fingers worked better than glass bottom for me).

These are so delicious! I followed the recipe almost exactly. The only differences: left the dough in the fridge overnight and rolled the balls of dough in sugar before baking. I will definitely make these again, for myself and for holiday gift-giving.

I didn't really care for the flavor in these. It needs a lil something. I went by all the reviews and thought it would taste great, but it didn't. I even added some vanilla but not what I was hoping for. Oh, and like others have mentioned they were too salty.

Very tasty! I also added vanilla and crushed pecans in batter after reading other reviews. A bit extra sugar on top when pressing with the glass helps flavor as well.

My only regret was that I halved this recipe!  I did not have many pencans left so I decided to halve the recipe.  I also used sugar, instead of flour, on the bottom of a glass to push the dough balls down.  Excellent choice!  I then pushed the crushed pecans into the top of the cookie.  They were AMAZING.  I plan on making these again and again, but possibly doubling the recipe and a more pecans (:

I Tried This Recipe with a lil bit of vanilla and finely chopped pecans and they were GREAT!! my 15 year old son who is somewhat of  a picky eater and claims he "Don't like nuts!" loved them.. I have  made them twice since thanksgiving and i'm sure i'll be making many more..  *i pressed them thin and got a nice crunchy cookie.* Great Recipe

Good recipe. I had pecans and butter on hand, and this recipe was a quick pantry solution for entertaining guests on short notice. Serve with tea or coffee. There weren't any leftovers!

I would give these a 10 star rating if I could! Absolutely scrumptious! I did a couple small changes suggested by other reviewers. Added 1 tsp of vanilla and 1/2 cup finely chopped pecans to the batter. Then rolled the batter balls in sugar before flattening. Will definitely make these again!

REALLY good and *I* LIKED that they weren't super sweet! They turned out beautiful and everyone enjoyed them (followed the suggestion of dipping glass in sugar instead of flour). Next time though, I'm going to make larger balls AND add chopped pecans to the dough, just a personal preference to a thicker cookie. Also, maybe I don't know what an inch is OR my oven cooks hot, but 6-7 minutes was plenty (just waited until they were BARELY brown on the edges and then let them sit for 1-2 minutes on the cookie sheet after taking them out of the oven)

I made these last night, we had picked some fresh pecans and they needed a outlet to shine! These cookies were quick, and easy! They are very good, and although I can see why some would add vanilla, they don't NEED it. My yield was about 4 dozen. The tip to add sugar before using the glass to flatten seemed like a good tip, but I did it without. All and all a tasty cookie!

I made these cookies for the first time today. I had no problems, and they came out delicious. They were so buttery and moist. I made minor changes that others suggested: Used 1/2 tsp vanilla, flattened the cookies with sugar instead of flour, did not refrigerate the dough, and finely chopped the pecans and added them to the batter. I used a cookie scoop and got 29 cookies.

Made with half butter, half vegan butter substitute.  Added sprinkled chopped pecans instead of one half.  Really delicious and light!

Cut the salt in half and these are great cookies. Made recipe as is & found they were too salty. As other reviews mentioned I too flattened them too much, will make them thicker next time. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Easy, delicious cookies.  Just the right sweetness.  I flattened my first batch out quite a bit and they're crisp thin cookies.  The second batch is in the oven now and I left them a bit thicker.  I also crushed some pecans and sprinkled them on the top.  Says original recipe yields 4 dozen - mine came to 2 dozen so double it if you're expecting 4.

I screwed up the recipe... if you put half the amount of butter, it ends up tasting like lumpy scones. the cookies didnt spread, but on the bright side they don't taste bad.  My rating is based on how the messed up batch tasted.  will have to try this again some time.

These cookies were pretty good..I did add the additional vanilla (about 1 tsp.) to my recipe as well..
I preferrably like my cookies a little bit sweeter, yet would maybe make them again for my family..

Very yummy, simple cookies! We had to get a video of my 2 yr old going absolutely nuts for these cookies...very funny! I took another reviewers advice and added 1/2t of vanilla just because you can't go wrong. Next time for a little deeper flavor I might just toast the pecans but all in all very good cookie!

Delicious! My husband loved these cookies.  It was a simple recipe.  Tip: It was easier to flatten the cookies on the sheet by dusting the glass every time w/ my hand.

This recipe is excellent.  I chopped up some pecans very fine and mixed them in with the dough.  I also added a teaspoon or so of vanilla.  Also, I prefer to use sugar on the bottom of the glass for flattening instead of flour.  The cookies are very tasty: nice and buttery and not too sweet.

Thought I would try this but too plain for my tastes so I shorted the brown sugar a little and added molasses and vanilla. I then toasted 1/2 cup of pecan pieces to add to the batter. Rolled them in Sugar in the Raw, flattened and baked.

Really nice cookie. I love burger cookies and pecans so it was perfect. I wouldn't change a thing except double the recipe next time and go crazy with the pecans. Ps. Got 42 cookies even refrigerating for only an hour. I rolled balls out by hand usinga teaspoonful of dough and pressed into shape with the ball of my palm since the dough warmed up so they kept sticking to the glass. I love these!

Mmmm these are great!  Try adding 1/2 a teaspoon of Maple flavoring rather than vanilla like some others have suggested.  Kinda makes them taste like mini pecan pies.

I am always looking for different variations of cookie mixes and I was disappointed with this recipe. It tasted more like flour than anything else. I followed this recipe exactly. While waiting for the next batch to finish in the oven I added more brown sugar and vanilla extract to the remaining cookie mix. I still have to say even though it sweetened it up a bit, these were still bland.

This cookie tasted great!  It was an instant hit with my family and I will probably make it again sometime soon. I added one teaspoon of vanilla extract like some of the other reviews seggested and I liked how it came out.  One thing though; when you refrigerate the dough, it becomes really hard, so I seggest taking it out in advance and letting it cool to room temp. first.

The dough was easy to work with but the flavor was not good, maybe by adding more sugar.  I know I won't be making them again.

These cookies were very bland, very much like shortbread with nuts.  There is so much butter in them that the edges and bottoms baked very dark, when usually cookies bake evenly in color.  I won't bake these again.

Very good little cookie, but I added 1 tsp of vanilla. It was a good add, otherwise they would have been a bit bland.  Will make this again. Oh and by the way if your oven runs hot, check them at 9 mins or else they might get too brown.

As is, pretty bland so 3 stars.  4 stars with adding 1/2 tsp vanilla extract, 1/2 cup chopped pecans and dusting with powdered sugar once cookies are cool. I found flattening cookies only 1/2 way with my fingers worked best.  When dough is cold enough it is not as hard to work with (less sticky).  This made 2-1/2 dozen cookies and 10 minute cooking time was right on.

Def add 1/2 tsp of vanilla( I used a whole tsp)   I got  2 1/2 dozen cookies useing a cookie scoop, will double recipe next time. I also added 1/2 cup of chopped pecans to batter. Mine did not stick to cookie sheet at all so I don't know what's going on with others having problems. Great cookies!!  Oh, I also dipped my glass bottom in Sugar in the Raw as suggested by another review, n they look so pretty. This is a keeper
