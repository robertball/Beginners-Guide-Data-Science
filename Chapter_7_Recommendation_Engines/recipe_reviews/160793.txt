I probably shouldn't review this recipe, since I made quite a few changes, but it's such a good jumping off point.  I didn't have sesame seeds, so I used 1/4 cup canola oil and 2 T sesame oil, 1/4 cup rice vinegar, 3 T soy sauce and 1 T red cooking wine (no mirin).  I also added grilled steak (marinated for 15 minutes in the salad dressing), yellow pepper and mandarin oranges.  Very good!

I have never tried bok choy in a salad before and I LOVED it!  The dressing had a great Asian sesame flavor and the texture of the bok choy, carrots, and almonds was wonderful.  I omitted the croutons - they don't seem to fit with the other ingredients.

salad was excellent with mandarin oranges and yellow peppers added.  dressing was good, but a bit too oily.

Well, as written I can only give this 3 stars. But, there is a lot of potential here! I made it as written and I thought it could use a bit of sprucing up. Next time, I would add sliced scallions to the salad, double the bok choy and leave the romaine out altogether. But, really, it's the dressing that needs some work. It could use some less oil in place of some sesame oil, some fresh grated ginger, maybe some red pepper flakes...Thanks anyway, but, I probably won't be making again!

I finally found baby bok choy in an asian market!  It makes a refreshing salad that would be good with cucumber, too.

I used  only 2 T oil and added red and yellow peppers. Will try the mandarin oranges next time. Instead of sesame seeds and croutons I used Mrs. May's sesame crunch.

With a salad, of all of its sections, it's the dressing that needs the directions. Cause if the dressing don't sing, then forget the whole thing -- it's no salad, it's a veggie collection.

A good idea that turned out alright. Definitely needed mandarin oranges and less oil in the dressing. Following other reviewers, I took liberties with the sauce- Walnut Oil & Olive Oil as the base, soy sauce, red wine vinegar and toasted sesame seeds yielded something I was happy to eat but would be concerned about serving.

The salad itself is easy as can be, and easily changed to preference.  I added half a chopped yellow bell pepper and used crispy chow mein noodles instead of the croutons.  I'm not sold on the dressing.  It could be bc I dont' have mirin, but I'm really not a fan; it's too bland, and I added some sugar and some fresh ginger.  I think there's too much oil in this, so I'd cut that down but I'm not sold on trying it again.  I think I'll look for another asian style dressing for this salad.  Thanks for the recipe!

Just had this tonight.  Excellent with baby bok-choy & toasted nuts!  I added a few scallions and used olive oil instead of canola; otherwise, I followed the ingredients exactly.

I used olive oil in place of the canola oil, and soy-ginger wontons instead of croutons. Also added some powdered ginger to the dressing. Brought this for dinner at a Japanese household and it went over very well. This is definitely going in the recipe box for future use!

I made it with added Romaine, some cranberries, and just used Kraft Asian salad dressing. It was nice with the shrimp pasta we enjoyed.

I see potential in this recipe but it needs a little bit more of each thing. It wasn't my ideal recipe for salad.

This is a good base recipe you can alter depending on seasonal ingredients.  I think the dressing needs to be sweeter so I added 2 tablespoons brown sugar. Yummy!
