Yummy!  My husband suggested a dash of nutmeg on the top, and it really pulled it together (not to mention making the presentation a little nicer -- brown like a deer!)

Really good, but a bit too strong (and I am a big martini drinker!).  Just cut the vodka by half and the recipe is perfect.

I thought it was good but my guests felt like this was very strong!  The kids idea with chocolate milk was a hit.  Make sure you use a very shallow glass so the antlers stand up.

This was a great idea, a little bit strong for us, but so cute.  I even put chocolate milk in martini glasses for the kids and garnished with the cherry and cinnamon sticks.  Thanks for sharing this creative recipe

We made this last year for Christmas and it's been requested by the family again this year.  I will reduce the vodka like others suggested as it was very strong.  We didn't have cute martini glasses, so I just added 1/2 to 1 tsp. cinnamon to the large pitcher we used to make about 6-7 servings (no straining needed).  It was so good.  We did do the cherry on the rim of the glass.  This year, I will add the dash of nutmeg for added flavor, as also suggested.

I loved the presentation so much but had to change the recipe to suit the crowd. Thanks for the heads up that the ingredients as written were too strong.
I made it with equal amounts of vodka, Frangelico and Baileys.
It was great!

I love the idea of this drink and really wanted it to be a hit, but sadly, it wasn't. We're used to drinking martinis, but we all agreed that this was very strong, even for us. I feel like this drink is missing some sort of mixer that would cut the alcohol a little and add some color. In addition, for the Rudolph thing to work, you either have to use very small martini glasses without a lot of depth, or very long  cinnamon sticks - and I bought the only ones at my grocery store in standard length. Therefore, they barely stick up from the glass, and you lose the effect.

Wow! Really strong!  I made them with lesser volumes of the alcohol and added the nutmeg as suggested by another person on here.  The nutmeg really does finish off the drink so I definitely recommend that.

The presentation is cute, but the flavor just didn't appeal to me.  It's not bad, just not a favorite.

This is an adorable holiday drink and everyone got a kick out of it.  I followed other reviewers' suggestion and used half the amount of vodka which worked out well for us.
