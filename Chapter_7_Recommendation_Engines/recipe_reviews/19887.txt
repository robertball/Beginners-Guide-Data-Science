I doubled this because the recipe said it would make 10-12 balls.  I ended up with about eighty! I didn't think there was much flavor besides sausage either.  No discernable cheese flavor and I even added more cheese than called for.

The best sausage balls EVER!  I am sure it is because of the 2 kinds of sausage and using the processed cheese instead of cheddar!  The only problem with this recipe is that now I have to make it at EVERY family function!!  :-)  Thanks for sharing this recipe!!

I have made this version of sausage balls for years and then found a recipe that made these sausage balls something else.  Add 1 cup of chopped walnuts and 1 cup of chopped dates.  You won't believe the difference. Those two ingredients turn this "4" to a rating that is off the charts! I am asked for my recipe everytime someone tries them.

I used shredded cheese just because it was on hand, and yes they are a little dry, however, when I take them out of the oven, I cover them with sauce then put them back in for a couple of minutes.  I've made this recipe several times and have used sweet&sour, chipotle, and bbq...all of my family and friends love it.  For now longer than it takes to make this is a very good recipe.  Just spice it up a little to your liking!!  Thanks for sharing!!

My mom used to make these every Christmas and I've been looking for the recipe for a long time but couldn't quite find the right one.  These are great! And so easy!!! My family loves spicy food, so I added 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper to the mix before baking.

I loved these!!  Everyone at my bunko party really loved these.  They are spicy which I love, and the cheese really makes it, but it does ooze out while in the oven.

These are not very good.  They were bland even though I added some cayenne pepper.

I used cream cheese. I don't like dry sausage balls and these were too dry.  My kids liked them though.   I'll probably put the leftovers in a sauce or gravy of some kind for my husband.

This was an easy recipe that delivered! I halved the recipe and it made 8 sausage balls.  I actually combined all the ingredients the night before and refrigerated the loaf and then in the morning made the sausage balls and placed them on an aluminum foil lined sheet pan and cooked as directed.

I found that the sausage balls needed a little extra time so I baked them for a total of 20 min and then put them under the broiler for 3 min to brown them up.

I served them with some more cheese drizzled on top based on some other comments.  We loved this an will be making it again!
