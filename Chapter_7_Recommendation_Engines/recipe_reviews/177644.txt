This is a nice and quick version of chicken parmesan that doesn't include the breading. I marinated the breasts in Italian dressing for a little more flavor, and I used shredded mozarella because that's what I had. This is a good recipe for a quick and easy dinner.

Loved this! I had a spaghetti squash I've been waiting to use and had a lazy evening tonight and thought it would be perfect. Quickly defrosted 2 chicken breasts in the microwave and was looking for how to prepare them quickly and so they would work good with the spaghetti squash. This baked up unbelievably fast and breast was very juicy and no pink! I glanced at the time after I put them in but sort of spaced out and was a little confused as to when I actually put them in. So... I THINK i baked them 20- 25 mins and when I looked at them, they were nice and golden, and since my squash was not ready, I covered the chicken and it went back in for 5 mins or so. I was really surprised, I cook at home every day and would say I'm a pretty good cook, but I usually cut into chicken and its still pink inside. Today I cut into it just waiting to find pink in there and I was looking so hard that I broke off a big chunk and there was no pink! Also it really bothers me when someone says a recipe is too bland! Everyone has different preferances when it comes to salt, pepper, and spicyness level and it comes almost as a shock to me that someone wouldn't add more of any of those while cooking if they know they prefer more. I know I love all things salty and dont really like sweet, so I salt my food more and reduce the sweet if the recipe calls for it. And I know my husband puts hot sauce on everything, so I know that I put more hot pepper on his food.

WOW, this simple dish was just awesome!  My kids even loved it!  I did use more cheese ... I sprinkled a generous amount of parmesan cheese directly on the chicken breasts before the sauce, then I used Ragu Romano and Parmesan sauce, then more parmesan and mozzarella.  It turned out so good, I will definitely make it again!

Very simple and tasty recipe. After mixing the noodles and chicken I added more sauce for more taste and I also sprinkled the chicken with italian seasoning before cooking.

This recipe is yummmmmmy! I did not see the red gold at the grocery. I used Wal-mart brand but then grabed the diced by mistake. I also used the Wal-mart brand Italian spaghetti sauce. But I followed the recipe exact other than that and it was so good and easy to make.

This was very good. I was looking for a healthier version of this recipe.  I did add a can of diced tomatoes and some garlic to the spaghetti sauce. I served it with whole wheat penne pasta.

I recently tried this recipe and loved it! What helped was seasoning my chicken rather than just pouring the sauce over it. The seasoning really brought the flavors alive.

If it's 30 minutes to dinner and you need a good meal quick, THIS IS THE ONE!  Really couldn't be easier.  Any spaghetti sauce will do.  Didn't have any mozzarella, so just added more Parmesan cheese.  The kids and hubby LOVED it! Tasty, quick, and economical meal.  Perfect for a weeknight.

Very easy and very good! I chose to bread my chiken with Panko breading but you don't have too. This is wonderful for a weeknight or if you have not planned ahead. I use whatever sauce/cheese I have on hand.

This is a great simple easy recipe.  My families are fairly picky eaters but they loved this one.  I was afraid it would be a little bland so I seasoned the chicken with a little garlic salt before adding it to the recipe and found this step completely unnecessary, I forgot how salty parmesan cheese can be.  Excellent!  The only real adjust I made was using my families favorite jar of Ragu instead.

Fast and Delicious! I did sprinkle the chicken with salt, pepper, and oregano. Also just used the cheese I had which was some pepper jack and pizza cheese. Turned out very good!

This was very good! The chicken came out very moist. I wanted to add some extra seasoning because some times I think chicken comes out bland, but I forgot. I'm glad I didn't because the chicken had great taste with just the sauce and cheeses. Maybe it was the pasta sauce I used (not Prego....sorry...I used what I had on hand.) I will definately be making this again!

Very easy, simple and tasty. Great for a busy night or when you just don't feel like doing a lot of cooking. We used our favorite sauce and linguini noodles. My whole family loved it!

This was pretty good and I loved how quick and easy it was to prepare, but I think this would be 10 times better if you used homemade sauce.

I loved it! Because of my families crave for bread crumbs I lightly crumbed chicken thighs and baked it at 350 degrees for 8 minutes on each side then I covered it with some jarred pasta sauce and the cheeses I then kept baking it for a further 10 minutes! I kind of only used this recipe as a base but I am excited to try it out!

Made this recipe last night for the family. My picky eaters absolutely loved it! I did season the chicken before adding the sauce and cheese. I used homemade spaghetti sauce. Chicken came out flavorful and tender. Family still talking about it. Will make more chicken tonight for remaining leftover spaghetti and sauce.

Very good and easy for a quick night super.  I wish the chicken had been just a little more tender but maybe if I marinade it next time that will help.

This was a very easy and quick version of Chicken Parmesan. I served it over some 6-cheese tortellini and was very good.

INCREDIBLY simple! I used chicken straight from the freezer - it took about 30 minutes more in the oven, but, it was great!! I used Mario Batello Cherry Tomato Pasta Sauce (2 package of jars, from Costco - used them both with 4 giant chicken breasts) - It MADE this dish! I think it needs SOMETHING to give it a little more POP, but, it was good as written. I served it over angel hair pasta.

Quick and easy!  Tweaks: thinned the breasts to cook faster; sprinkled plain bread crumbs and Italian seasoning on top of the cheeses.  Served with crescent rolls instead of noodles.  Husband and tweens were happy, so I'm happy - will make again!

Made this for me and my boyfriend as the first real meal in our new apartment. I decided to bread it before hand with just some Italian seasoned bread crumbs and it was delicious! Will definitely be using this one again!

This was a quick and easy dinner for my fiance and I.  I had breast tenderloins, just seasoned them with misc. spices and threw some sauce with little cheese over them.  Next time I will marinate them with Italian dressing and white wine with my overload of spices.  I just didn't feel like being in the kitchen forever tonight.  Thank you!

This is a delicious recipe. The chicken turned out very moist.
