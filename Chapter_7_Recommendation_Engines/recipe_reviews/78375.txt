When I made these, the prep time wasn't QUITE that long. Also, I added roughly a cup of cheddar cheese which made for some much better cookies than the original recipe.

We read the reviews and accepted the challenge to add some kick to this recipe. This became quite nice as an added savory cookie to our Holiday treat tray.  We added 1/2 cup of heavy whipping cream, and utilized an 1/8 cup of fresh grated parmesan/ romano cheese to the dough and added 1/8 tsp additional salt, rolled the log in pepper and parmesan - when baked with egg wash we added a sprinkling of grated asiago - wow the basic recipe a sturdy base became a luscious zesty crunchy tasty " cookie" brought favored remarks from family and friends. yummo!

my husband is in the Navy and has been gone for 5 months. I asked him if he wanted me to send some of his favorite cookies to eat and share with the guys. He of course said yes. I asked if he wanted anything else and he had the strange request of something with bacon. Jokingly, I said how about bacon cookies. Well, he loved them (so did all of the other sailors). Thank you

These were ok. Lacking a little flavor. I tried using the bacon grease with the butter to give it a little more oomph. Didn't change the taste of the cookie part much. I'll be toying around with this recipe this fall though - trying to figure out if some good sharp cheddar cheese can be baked in with these. 

Thanks for this unusual recipe though!

I read the comments about this being bland and when I tasted the dough, I agreed I needed a little help. I went a different direction with these.. they are a cookie so they needed sweetness. I added a tablespoon of real maple syrup to the dough, and then after baking, topped with a glaze of powdered sugar, maple syrup and a little water. YUM!! Maple bacon cookies.. delish

i made this last saturday for an oktoberfest themed party.  they were okay and people said they liked them, but to me they had very little flavor.  the only good parts were the pieces of bacon.  anyway, they weren't bad, just not as good as i expected.

These turned out weird and dry for me.  Too bad, because I was looking forward to bacon!

I am a huge fan of bacon and love it, but this recipe ruins it. The cookies where dry and didn't have much favor. I would suggest making something else.

I was so excited to make these cookies. I added some cheddar cheese and used 1/4 tsp. of bacon salt instead of regular; it really didn't help.  The only flavor of the cookie came from the bacon pieces themselves. I think the next time I want bacon cookies I'm just going to find a good sugar cookie recipe and add bacon. I was really hoping for something different than a bland cookie with bacon chips.

Not really a fan. Made the recipe as written. "Cookies" came out dry and bland...more like crackers with a shortbread textures. There certainly wasn't enough bacon flavor. I think cheese could have helped a bit, but not too much. These might be okay served with tomato soup or some other kind of soup.

Bacon Cookies are the greatest thing on mother earth! My family loved it when I made them. My son loved it so much that he started having happy shivers and fell asleep. He still hasn't woken up! Thanks to this recipe, my husband and I can finally get some alone time.

My boyfriend was super excited about me making these "cookies". As I was making them, I quickly realized, they're not cookies at all. They had no flavor and honestly we're both quite disappointed.

This has got to be one of my favorite cookie recipes. I have a hard time getting people to try them, but once they do, they love them. They are a savory cookie, just a hint of sweetness. And in the end, if no one wants them, more for me!
