Will definitely make again!
Two chicken breasts,  bone in,  3/4 cup water,  six minutes pressure cooking with quick release kept my kitchen COOL.  Produced a nice moist, easy to shred chicken.  We added the shredded chicken to a frying pan with taco seasoning and used wraps to make a Burrito with all the toppings.  Easy peasy and fast.   I am sure that the chicken broth would make it taste even better.  Thanks.

This is my first dish in the instant pot and it turned out moist and flavorful and didn't take much time which is important to me.  Next time I will add my favorite spices  to  the chicken before I cook it.

Such an easy way to make shredded chicken! I only used about a pound of boneless skinless chicken breasts. I still used 1/2 cup water and about half the salt and pepper. Cooked in the Instant Pot for 20 minutes. It was so tender it shredded easily. I mixed it with taco seasoning and water, let it simmer and had easy, great tasting chicken tacos. Clean up was easy too. Iâ€™ll never do shredded chicken any other way.

Whle I did cut the recipe in half, I found this to be a painless and perfect way of cooking chicken for chicken salad and  casseroles and for freezing for a later use. I was leery of adding just 1/2 cup water since the manual says to use 1 cup, but it worked fine.
