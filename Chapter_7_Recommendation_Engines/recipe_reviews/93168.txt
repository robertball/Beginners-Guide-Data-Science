Basic recipe is ok, but it omits some very important steps.  You must tie the legs and wings with twine to prevent them over cooking.  And the most important detail, don't cook directly over the flame. Cook with indirect heat according to the directions of your BBQ.  On my 3 burner Weber, I turn off the middle burner that lies under the chicken.  You can also place a pan of seasoned liquid under the chicken to catch the fat and moist season the food.  I recommend wine, apple juice, etc.

This was a total disaster.  So why did I rate it five stars?  Because I take the blame for the problems I had.  Although the recipe did not state it, I knew to tie up the drumsticks and wings to keep them from flapping as the rotisserie turned, thus turning to carbon.  I also knew that, when basting with a butter or oil based flavoring, you will have flare-up.  I thought about putting foil under the chicken, but thought previous postings that said "do not deviate from the recipe" knew something I did not.  Maybe it would be crispier.  When I went to put the second basting on, there was smoke streaming out from under the lid.  The skin was black.  A lot of the meat was overcooked.  The stuff in the middle was cooked perfectly, but I sent my daughter out to the store to get a pre-cooked one.  I will eat the meat I salvaged for lunch tomorrow ;-).  So, tie the legs, tie the wings, put down foil, and you will probably love this.  I loved the smell of the sauce.  Live and learn.  I hope you learn from my mistake.  Updated:  Another option is to turn off the burner under the chicken and cook it with indirect heat.  (I have three burners.)

Excellent! I had some doubts on this recipe, but this turned into the rotisserie taste that I pay premium bucks for at market. I followed the recipe exactly, basting only once. I cooked a 3 1/2 lb. chicken for two hours at 300-325 degrees. It came out absolutely PERFECT. Make NO changes. Trust this recipe. It is the real deal.

Great recipe!  This was my first time using my rotisserie attatchment for my BBQ grill.  I was a little nervous but it turned out wonderful.  Make sure you use the drip pan or you will be in for a big mess.  Also, tie up the legs and wings so they don't flap all over the place.  This was a great recipe to start my rotisserie carrer.  I will be cooking this again very soon.

This chicken turned out fantastic. We followed the ingredients list exactly and the cooking times were followed exactly. Thanks to the other reviews, made sure we tied the legs/wings with string and used an old 13x9" cake pan as a drip pan. We have always really enjoyed the grocery store rotisserie chickens, but now we will be making our own. Yum! The reviewer who added garlic powder has a great idea, as I am sure that would be tasty!

My husband has been after me for years to find a great rotisserie chicken recipe and this is it!  I did decrease the amount of salt used the second time I made this chicken and it was delicious! I will definitely be using this recipe for a long time!

The chicken looked so great that it was shame to carve it. But the taste was great it was worth while carving it. Moist, succulent, and delicious.

YUMMY!  Rivals any store bought/restaurant rotisserie Chicken.  Added poultry seasoning, garlic, and seasoning salt to the mix.  Also used olive oil instead of butter.  Took 1.5 hours at 300 degrees.  Tied wings and drumsticks together, and then the drumsticks to the body.  Family loved the crispy skin.  I had brined the chicken for something else and then decided to grill with the nice weather.  Don't know what the 4 hours of brining did, but the end result was fabulous!

Perfect every time!  I stick a whole lemon in the cavity (after poking it a few times to let the juices trickle out) and some fresh rosemary. It keeps the bird moist and also helps to keep it snug on the rotisserie rod.

Yes, the recipe is fine but the method and instructions have  a lot to be desired  when cooking out of doors over  fire ,  be it over or with charcoal or on a gas grill...,   You Quickly Grill most cuts of beef over direct coals or heat.   You Bar B Q most cuts of pork over low and very slow indirect heat (smoke).  Brisket and tougher cuts of beef are best cooked low and slow as well.  You do something called  in-between with chicken and poultry called "ROASTING"  Now if  you are into eating carbon and having a black cloud emanate from your mouth and encircling your head from each bite, I suggest when "roasting" whole chicken or chicken pieces on the grill you employ the indirect method of cooking [roasting].    Indirect Method is having  the fire banked on one or either side of the chicken or meat like Pork Steaks, Ribs, Rib racks and Tri Tip steaks etc. either on a rotisserie such as Prime Rib roast [In a basket not on skewers]or flat on the grill when using charcoal or briquettes.    Important! Always have a drip pan under the chicken.  This prevents flare ups and grease fires in the Bar B Q pit or Kettle.  Always have a sufficient amount of liquid in the drip pan be it beer, apple juice, wine or even plain water.  This adds humidity to the inside of the closed BBQ and also prevents grease fires.   Concomitantly, it also will stop neighbor complaints those unexpected Code-3 visits from your local engine company of fire fighters.  Rule of thumb is... “Never cook, BBQ or roa

This rotisserie chicken was delicious!  The flavor from the butter baste was very yummy!  I had about a 4 lb. chicken and my husband pretty much ate the whole thing!  lol  That was the first time making a whole chicken, for just the two of us, where we had no leftover meat!  I did brine the chicken for a few hours before hand to help it come out nice and juicy.  I had to try out my new rotisserie that I received for xmas and even though it was freezing outside the chicken took about an hour and a half to fully cook on the grill.  Thanks for the great recipe!  I will make again!

Very good!  I found rotisserie tips on another website which helped a lot... put the chicken on top of a lemon (or an onion) to keep the chix from flopping all over, and truss the chix as well.  I used the lemon and the juices definitely permeated the chix, and with the butter mixture of this receipe on the chix skin the end result was GREAT!  (Also, use a pan full of liquid (water, broth, or a mixture of both) to catch the drippings.  Make sure you keep liquid in the pan so it doesn't dry out and burn.  That way no flare-ups from the fire or smoke from drippings burning.  This chicken turned out AWESOME!)

This sauce is great and versatile! I have used it with chicken and also with just vegetables baked in an Oven Bag, the sauce is absorbed by the veggies, mouth watering! My daughter is a vegetarian and we have made a meal of the oven roasted vegetables. I keep getting requests for the recipe.

Craving BB-Q chicken over the last weekend we tried this recipe.  I prepared the whole chicken and my wonderful boyfriend braved the cold to spark up the barbecue and cook it.  He put a tin pan on the rack, above the coals and under the chicken and basted the chicken in it's own juices.  I wouldn't change a thing!  Really exceptional !  Thank you.

Quick and easy.  This was so juicy.  Thanks for sharing.  I just got my grill rotisserie attachment and this was the perfect first dish!  Definitely put foil or a pan under the chickent to catch the drippings or you will have a big mess.

Best rotisserie chicken I've ever made...this is one of our favorite things to eat.  I put less paprika than the recipe called for (maybe about 1/2) because I didn't know if my husband likes paprika.  I also added a few dashes of garlic salt.  I melted all the seasonings together in a pan on the stovetop and rolled the chicken around in it after it cooked for 10 mins. The seasoning was really good....has kind of a salty tangy-ness.  We will definitely make this again.
UPDATE: I always make this in my toaster oven (it has a rotisserie attachment) and it's perfect.  Sometimes I alternate seasonings with the "Roast sticky chicken" recipe by Sue Rogers, on this website, for some variety, and stick a lemon in the middle.  Cooking chicken this way is the best!

This was so awesome - I added potatoes & veggies to the drip pan below along with some chicken broth and sprigs of fresh Rosemary & Thyme - I came out unbelievably flavorful.  This recipe is a for sure keeper and great for entertaining.

did this recipe as follows: 4.75lb chicken @350 deg gas grill for 2.5 hrs. 
used same spices as original recipe but added 1 tsp. of garlic powder. Used drip pan under chicken with one 12 oz. bottle of beer in it. Chef had only one glug. Beer evaporated after 1/2 hr so added water with a little chicken base. Had to do this twice. Best chicken I ever had. You must try this,you won't be dissapointed.Used both outside burners on 4 burner gas grill using indirect heat method.

Wow!  This chicken came out tender, juicy, and delicious!  Used a 5 lb chicken and cooked it at 300 in my convection oven on the rotisserie setting and cut the salt down by a touch (about 2/3 T).  After 2 hours, it was cooked perfectly.  Thank you for sharing!

Very good.  Made it without the butter and used skinned chicken.  I let it soak in a salt water brine for ~2hrs before I seasoned and grilled it.  With those changes, it was perfect for us.

We just bought a rotisserie and needed to break it in before trying a whole pig on the 4th of July.  This is a free standing one without a lid.  Now we know we need to get or make a lid for this thing because a small chicken took FOREVER to make.  Thank God we did Beer Butt chicken on the grill or our neighbors kids would have been starving.  Be sure to tie your chicken's wings and legs together with string so they don't hang down.  You want those to be secure.  Also, to keep it moist stuff the cavity with cut up lemons.  With regard to the recipe for basting sauce, it was good.  I would double it and add garlic powder and some onion powder.  Although, you could add just about any combination of spices that are to your liking.  It really doesn't matter.  What you have to have is patience and a good meat thermometer.

Excellent and comes out so moist and flavorful. Directions don't say to tie up legs and wings but you really must. I put a pan underneath to catch the fat that melts off which causes 'fire'. This chicken was a 4.20 pounder and was done in 1 1/2 hours. Sure will do this again!

This was my first attempt at using the rotisserie on my brand new Weber.  I did tie the legs and wings and used a drip pan under the bird.  I also used indirect heat, turning off the center burner.  I used kosher salt, which at 1 tablespoon turned out to be a little salty.  Next time I will halve the salt, but all in all the taste was unbelievable!! Will definitely try again.

ROCKS! If you want a real down home flavor this is it. So good. I was a little more liberal with a pinch of salt on the inside (healthy pinch) and I think it helps a little.

Best Rotisserie chicken recipe I've found.  Try stuffing bird with a quartered onion and lemon.  I've also cooked it in my "Big Easy" oiless turkey fryer.

Chicken was mouthwatering. Spices are just right.  Could use half of butter of spices. Had to reserve the remainder for the next rotisserie chicken. Recommend this one.

This is simply delicious!! I added some garlic and onion powder to the melted butter. The skin got perfectly crispy and the meat was wonderfully moist. I made 2 chickens at once and everyone loved them.

My wife didn't want to make the baste as directing. She used store-bought poultery seasoning and margerine. I have five burners on my grill. After tying the 5-pound bird with cooking twine and securing it to the spit, I put it over four burners on high for about 10-15 mintues. I turned off the middle two burners and reduced the outer burners to medium. After things settled, the thermometer on the grill top read 350. I basted the bird every twenty minutes, cooking for a TOTAL of one hour (10-15 on high with 4 burners and 45-50 with two burners on medium). The temperature by out meat thermometer was 177.6. Since my wife could not stop sampling the crisp skin, we called it "done" and tented it with aluminum foil for 15 minutes or so.
She says she's never buying a store prepared rotisserie chicken again.

This was excellent, but I made several changes: 1/2 olive oil and 1/2 butter, added garlic powder, onion powder, lemon pepper instead of black, used the salt and paprika, stuffed chicken with onion and lemon wedges, and filled the drip pan with white wine and lemon juice. Easy recipe and amazing flavor.

OHHH MY!!!!!! This was GREAT! This was the first time I have used the rotisserie on the grill. After reading reviews I placed a pan under the chicken with apple juice in it. I cooked it on low temp with 2 of the 3 burners for 2.5 hours. When I took it off the grill, I covered it in foil and towels to keep the heat in and grilled my vegies in foil for 20 mins. It worked great! It allowed the chicken to settle, but yet kept it hot. This chicken was SO moist and tender! I did have to fill the juice in the pan one more time during the whole process. Use a pan you don't care about or a disposable because the cooking will destroy the pan! I also used a seasoned salt in place of the regular salt. We WILL be making this more!

Yery good. Made a nice crispness to the skin. But I felt it lacked some flavor. So on the 2nd try I added some Brie cheese under the skin around the breast and then stuffed the cavitey with lemon wedges, thyme, basil, and onion wedges. Added a full burst of flavor this time. But with the Brie cheese in there it made it rather oily on the outside, So you'ld just have to either omit the cheese or the butter baste.

We started making this rotisserie chicken recipe right after Father's Day 2009 when my husband received his new huge grill. This recipe is spot on! We have never felt we needed to change it in any way. We joke that, who knew 'paprika' would be the secret ingredient. It is so delicious we practically make it for every party...birthdays, 4th of July, etc. Our guests always ask how we make it...it is so easy!

The chicken came out moist, beautiful, but it wasn't a hit -- way too salty.   One of my kids couldn't even eat the leg, because it was so salty.  

I will definitely cook it again, but with perhaps 1/2 teaspoon of salt.

I made this recipe the other night to break in our new rotisserie for our gas grill. I have to say that I've bought rotisserie style chickens from the supermarket and thought they were great, but this recipe puts them to shame!! Our chicken turned our fantastic! It was succulent, moist and perfect. I'm glad that I learned a new chicken cooking technique. Thanks for submitting this wonderful recipe, I'll be using it from now on!

Really enjoyed this recipe, I did brine my chicken 24 hours with water,garlic and brown sugar then rinsed and cooked as the recipe said.  My grill has a infrared rotisserie burner  so after the first ten minutes with everything on high I shut the bottom burners off and only cooked with the infrared burner. Total cooking time about 70 minutes. Simple recipes are just the best!

these turned out very well.  Didn't have the energy to set up the rotesserie so I cooked them on broiler pans on the grill and it worked out well.

One Word......yummmiiieee!!!!! I have made this twice and both times it came out better than any resturant bought chicken i have ever purchased.  My only regret is, I can't make it in the winter as I live in northen Canada and it gets to cold to be outside rotisserieing chicken.

We just got a new grill along with a rotisserie.  Couldn't wait to try it out and this recipe was perfect.  I even did two chickens (Doubled the recipe) at one time and they both turned out great.  Very moist and flavorful!  Will definitely use again.

The results of this recipe were astounding. The chicken turned out tender, juicy and best of all had that golden reddish brown crispy skin that had alluded me until this recipe. I did cut the salt by 25%, but that is a personal preferance. This recipe is a keeper.

I make this rotisserie chicken using Western North Carolina Vinegar Barbeque Sauce which has butter in it.  You can find the recipe on alrecipes.  I do the usual tie the legs and wings and use indirect heat and try to maintain 350 degrees on my weber

I don't have a bbq, so I baked this in the oven. It was a huge hit. Way better than the prepared rotisserie chickens we usually get.

This was so delicious and so unbelievably easy!  i didn't even measure anything out, rubbed butter all over and under the wings, salted, peppered, and sprinkled paprika all over it.  I actually cooked it in the oven uncovered.   Tasted just like a store bought rotisserie.  It was divine!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Loved this chicken (the 2nd time I made it!). The first one was my first rotisserie attempt and although I put a drip pan under it, the fat that dripped caught fire and destroyed the chicken! I did some research then the next time I put 1 inch of water in the drip pan. It diluted any drips and prevented a fire.  My 2nd attempt went great and we loved the results. I did use 1/2 the salt but otherwise wouldn't change a thing.

Made this the other night, yummy! I used the rub as a starting point but stuffed the chicken with lemon grass & onion, my drip pan consisded of white wine, garlic and lemon juice for basting. Not much was left for the next day but the toddler was able to enjoy those few left over bites. Thanks for sharing!!

I did this a little different, I used 1 Tsp garlic powder, 1 Tsp salt, 1/2 Tsp Freshly ground black pepper, 1 tablespoon parsley flakes. 
I tied the chicken and put a pan underneath it and I did not baste it at all. Came out great! Thanks for the technique.

First rotisserie I have ever done.  Got the rotisserie kit for birthday to go on my Weber grill.  Even after reading that you need to tie the bird up, I didn't realize how much.  Well, the recipe turned out great.  Substituted olive oil for the butter.  Also dusted the bird with Zach's cajun salt just prior to pulling it off the grill.  Very tender, good recipe.

I was skeptical of this recipe when I tried it, but it turned out to be a great basic recipe.   I would recommend binding the drumsticks and wings to keep them from overcooking, just as I did. I, also, put the chicken on a timer and basted it every 30 or so minutes while cooking. I cooked the chicken on high (450 degrees) for 10 minutes, and then cooked it at 350 degrees for about an hour and half (the skin had a rich, dark color, the meat had started retracting from the bone, and the internal temp had reached 180 degrees).  The great thing about this recipe is how moist the chicken is. I usually make a chicken salad with any leftovers.

Oh my goodness; did I ever get rave reviews from my family and guests.  No other BBQ chicken for my family now.  I did cut back the salt to 2 tsps. and placed it in a tin foil plate in the center of the BBQ with the middle burner off.  Used a digital thermometer and my 3.5 lb. chicken only took one hour.   Have tried this on bone in chicken breasts adding the rub half way through and using a digital thermometer to 180 degrees.  Yummo, so tender & juicy.

Sorry not to give 5 stars but everyone found this too salty. I'll try it again with half the salt and maybe olive oil instead of butter.

This is a winner!  Drip pan and only baste it once is my only change.  For a larger chicken (3-1/2 Pound)I cooked it two hours and it fell off the bone.  It sure beats the store variety.

I just have to say how wonderful this chicken turns out. I really had no idea that I was able to produce such a lovely dish! I have been living in Italy for several years, and from time to time I get the urge for some home food, and this was above and beyond what I was craving!!!

Followed to a T. Worked out great in my countertop Rotisserie. Overall flavor was very nice, it was what I was looking for, for another recipe to use this in. I didn't want anything overly spicy with flavors nor was it just plain. This fit into what I was looking for. I love the butter paprika flavor on the skin. And I can't wait to try this recipe on the grill. TY.

Easy and Delicious.
Tastes better than take out chicken!
My kids love this and ask for it every week!!  Also works great for roasting the chicken on a can of beer in the oven.

This was excellent. We grilled it on our rotisserie rack on the bbq. It tasted better than the ones you get at a grocery store. This is definately a keeper.

Really great way to do chicken! I thought it was a tad bit salty as I used salted butter plus the tablespoon - next time I'll only use two teaspoons or unsalted butter and 1 tablespoon of salt.

My chicken came out AMAZINGLY!!! I basted it three times (at approx. 30min intervals) and BBQ'd it on medium for almost 1.5hrs The skin came out so crunchy and flavorful, the inside of the chicken was very moist...better than any store-bought rotisserie chicken I've ever eaten! My husband couldn't get enough :)

This recipe is absolutely perfect exactly the way it is written, no changes needed. It comes out looking just like the rotisserie chickens I buy cooked at the grocery store and tastes even more moist! Thank you.

This came out fantastic. Only thing I added was some garlic powder to the baste mix, about a couple tsp.

My family gives the 5 stars.  The kids were requesting it again before dinner was done.  Chicken was perfectly moist.  However, I will definately reduce the amount of salt next time I make it.

I wish there was a 4.5 rating....This was pretty good.  I really liked the basting mix, but I was thinking maybe to inject the chicken too next time??  Will try it out and report back to you.  :)

This will work to perfection but here are a few ideas to keep in mind:
1. make sure you tie up legs AND wings with string or thin wire.
2. use some sort of rub; I used McCormick's Lemmon-Pepper
3. put an old cookie sheet under the chicken on the rotisserie
4. if you have a three-burner bbq, turn the middle one off
5. monitor bbq for the first 30 mins to adjust the other burners so that the temp stays around 425 degrees.
6. use an instant temp thermometer at about 60 minutes and at 170 degrees it is done and then let rest for 10 mins.

The chicken was fabulous. I had always been kind of intimidated by the idea of a rotisserie but finally broke down and bought one. This was easier than I thought -- once I figured out the above ideas.

This is an awesome recipe. Forget B Market! I'll probably cut the salt down slightly next time though. Definitely use a drip pan and tie the legs and wings.

Loved this recipe...I used a drip pan with some white wine and chicken stock, the meat was very tender and juicy, not a bit dry.  I used these drippings and included some homemade chicken stock (used neck and heart etc for a light gravy.  Everyone raved and it was not much work at all! Served it with baked sweet potatoes and broccoli with mushrooms.

Great recipe!  I made it pretty much exactly as written, then used the rotisserie attachment on my grill.  I did tie the legs and wings with kitchen twine, as suggested, and the wings still came out crispy and delicious, but not burnt.  I also used apple wood chips in a smoker box which complemented nicely.  Even my picky 17-year-old bro-in-law thought it was "wicked".  How's that for a complement?

amazing! turned out perfect! thanks!  i found 350 was best(all 3 burners on low). make sure you tie up the legs/wings. i would recommened adding some liquid in the drip pan BEFORE you start cooking as well. i used some cheap beer :)   in addition to the wonderfully simple recipe..... i stuffed the cavity with lemon wedges, garlic and various herbs. i HIGHLY recommend doing this. kept the bird nice and juicy!

We recently got a new gas grill & rotisserie.This was the first recipe we tried, and it was scrumptious!!  The second time, I omitted the salt & added 1/2tsp. garlic powder, 1tsp. onion poweder and 1tsp. lemon pepper. To the melted butter, I added 1/2 cup lemon juice.  Wonderful!!  We will use this recipe many times this summer.

Absolutely loved this recipe. I used a 7lb chicken and took the advise of other reviewers and added 1 tsp of garlic powder and combined olive oil with the melted butter. I made sure I had a drip pan below the chicken and only used the outside burners. I also used wire to tie the bird securely and  cooked it about 2 hours. Everything else I followed exactly as the other reviewers said. The skin came out cripy brown and the meat was so juicy it fell apart with a fork. I used a 9" cake pan for the drip pan and started out with about 1/2 of water to prevent any grease fire. During the 2 hours I basted frequently and had to add about 1 pint of water to refill  the pan. This will be my recipe for rotisserie chicken for a long time. It is a make again in my house.

This chicken turned out great! As others have pointed out, you have to tie the wings and legs up, but I learned that lesson a couple years back so luckily, I knew to do so. I added a 1/2 T of onion powder and garlic powder to the butter mixture. I also poured apple juice over and in the chicken before basting for the first time. The chicken was moist and full of flavor. Thanks!

I wouldn't change a thing in this simple recipe.  Besides the outcome of a great tasting rotisserie chicken, this recipe has inspired me to look for an even larger rotisserie so I can cook more and more.

I have used this method to cook a couple of chickens now.  I brined the chicken first so did not use the baste here but used everyone's suggestions on drip pan with beer...etc...BUT last night the drip pan liquid evaporated...caught fire and the bird caught fire!!  ugh!  We went out, bought a new chicken so this time I used the baste here and it was great!  Did use less salt (and made sure we kept liquid in the drip pan!!!)

Truly outstanding recipe. Looks to simple to be good but that's what's deceiving. If you are cooking a larger chicken you do need to increase the butter by 1-2 TBLS. You can also add 1/8 to 1/4 tsp of garlic powder. This will become a family/guest favorite in an instant.

This is the most delicious chicken.  Just like the supermarket chicks.  No changes, we had a 4 3/4 pound bird and cooked for an extra 30 minutes but 15 would have been enough.

Very good! Much better than the grocery store kind. I don't think it needs that much salt, though. I used  only 1 tsp. I also coated the chicken with Mrs. Dash prior to putting it on the  BBQ. It was delicious! Be sure to use a drip tray.

Very easy to do!  We used the rotisserie burner on our grill and it took a little longer.  Make sure you check the temperature often.  The last 30 degrees went really fast! Very juicy!

My first attempt at using the rotisserie on our new gas grill.  What a delicious chicken, so moist and tender!  Followed suggestions of tying string around legs and wings...thank goodness!  Would have been disaster otherwise!  Basting sauce is delicious!  Try this recipe - you won't be disappointed!

This recipe was so easy, my husband (who doesn't cook) was able to make this almost entirely by himself. He thought that salt, pepper, paprika and butter sounded too dram though, so he used lemon pepper, oregano and garlic too! This recipe is great as a blank canvas and you can add whatever flavors you like.

Excellent - Just  make sure you put a foil pan under the chicken to catch the buttery drippings. The first time I made this is was pretty singed - but it was still tasty!

My hubby & I tried this recipe this weekend on two birds. It's our first try at rotisserie and followed the recipe but added a bit of onion powder and garlic powder to the marinade. We also kept an aluminum pan under the chicken to keep the flames from flying! 
I HIGHLY recommend this recipe. Being our first try at rotisserie we plan to vary some spices to make it our own but this recipe is a keeper for our base! Try it, you're going to love it!

This was great.  A little nervous to have our first rotisserie chx for guests, but it was perfect.  We didn't baste too much; just coated w/the marinade and covered w/foil because the grill was flaring up & it was getting charred.  But...turned out great, everyone loved it.  Very easy meal when entertaining...put it on the rotisserie and forget about it!

Found it too salty and oily tasting. Maybe other spices with less or no salt would be better.
I tried this again this weekend and now give it 5 stars.
Used 2 tbsps of butter melted with 1 tbsp of montreal smoke spice for chicken. Used drip pans and the chicken was fantastic!

AMAZINGLY DECICIOUS ! And beautiful in it's simplicity.  We took advice of another & used olive oil in place of butter.  In the drip tray we put quartered onion, garlic, white wine & chicken stock .... The chicken gets steamed by the mixture in drip tray plus - basting drips in to tray as well adding yo amazing flavor .... Thank you for a fabulous meal

Make sure you cook the chicken on in-direct heat and tie up the legs and wings or it will burn! This recipe is great, the kids all fought over it and loved it! I'm making two next time!

Used all the review tips (tray under, with liquid, trussed chicken). Used cooking sherry and broth from gizzards as liquid. Placed rosemary, thyme, garlic clove, sage in cavity after seasoning. Added garlic to seasoning with seasoned pepper, seasoned salt, paparika. Then placed a wood chip smoker over side flame. Also left middle burner of 3 off. Chicken was awesome, and so was gravy!

Absolutely fabulous recipe. I have to admit that I was a little skeptical considering it was so easy. I found that when trussing the wings and legs, using unwaxed dental floss worked great and it's cheap and readily available. I found that it was also advantageous to mix one bottle of paprika then refill the bottle with kosher salt then 1/4 bottle of black pepper then use however much is necessary for the size of the chicken you're cooking and store the leftover for future use.

Excellent!!  Used several of the suggestions to make mine unique.  My cooking time was about 20 minutes less with a rotisserie burner at the back on my grill.  I checked it at 1:15 and it was at 194.  Still very juicy

This was just ok for me. My husband liked it, but I didn't think it was worth all the money and time it took to make it. Store bought is much better and cheaper by far! All flavor was in the skin-which i don't eat. Meat was bland and I had to dip it in bbq sauce.

This was absolutely DELICIOUS!  I fixed it for company and I made the remark that it was as good as any rotisserie chicken you buy in the store (I LOVE the store bought), and my guests said, "Oh no, this is BETTER!"  Everyone loved it.  Great recipe!  Will definately be making again.

Fantastic -- followed recipe exactly, though used a 4lb chicken so it took longer. Also smoked with some mesquite wood chips while it was cooking.

I grilled two 5 lb. hens on my rotisserie yesterday using this recipe as my guideline.  I used way less butter than 1/2 cup on both hens.  At 1 hr. 45 min. my meat thermometer read 170 degrees which is plenty done.  I did let the chickens rest for about 10 minutes before we sliced the juicy, tender meat.  We even ate the crispy skin.  Some extra herbs may have made it more interesting but I enjoyed the simplicity of this dish; just don't over cook it.

Liked it as a beginning, but way to much salt and not enough herbs. I would simply add some thyme and rosemary and less salt.

very unimpressed.  agree with Cooking Apprentice.  Way too salty if you enjoy the skin.  the marinade never blended well.  the paprika and pepper tended to settle to the bottom while the butter floated.  won't do it again

This chicken was wonderfully moist and flavorful.  I think you could use your imagination with whatever you wanted to add to the basic basting butter.  The ONLY change I would make next time-other than perhaps experimenting with different spices-is cutting the salt in half.  The chicken itself was not too salty, but the wonderful crispy crust was extremely salty. That is the only reason it got 4 vs. 5 stars from me.

Excellent!  I added chicken seasoning to the inside of the chicken.  We have a small counter-top rotisserie.  I have tried a few recipes, come up with a few of my own, but this was so simple, easy and delicious!  My boyfriend and I agreed it was the best so far!

Was very good. I used two four pound chickens. I put a drip pan down and used the 2 outside burners plus the sear machine in our grill set up for our Rotisserie.  I also tied the legs and wings together like other reviewers. My only complaint was it was a little dry but that was mostly our fault because we don't think we seared properly (first time using!!lol)  It smells WONDERFUL cooking! Will definately try again. Thank you for the recipe!!

Wonderful!  I attribute most of it to the excellent grilling skills of my husband.  The skin was just crispy enough and the meat was moist.  We put onions/garlic inside the cavity and then put a drip pan with some apple juice in it under the bird to catch everything.  So delicious!

Yep, everyone said in the reviews that this was good and it was.  I got a bit worried after I looked out in the first 7 minutes and the grill was on fire underneath and opened it up and the bird already looked a bit black and the strings I tied the bird with were gone.  I took it off the grill and retied the legs and wings.  But it turned out great.  Cooking it on High the first 10 minutes sealed in all the juice.  Very very moist and flavorful.  Kids loved it too.  I might use a bit less salt next time though.

Just didn't do it for me. I don't even want to eat the leftovers. It's way too salty!!! My husband likes it though (good thing, he can eat all the leftovers himself!) Won't try it again.

Wouldn't change a thing.  Fabulous roasted flavor and crisp skin.  A keeper and one I will make often.

My husband and I had this for tonight's dinner. I used the rotisserie feature of my electric oven and baked a 1.2kg chicken for about an hour and a half. I wasn't so sure about the time because my cellphone's clock stopped. It was juicy and we loved it except for the super salty taste of the outside part. Next time, I will lessen the salt used for the basting sauce.

I agree with another that this recipe omits important steps like cooking temp (we did 350 on our 4-burner stove). A drip pan is absolutely a must. We bought a narrow foil pan and it caught the juices that were perfect for basting. It took our 3 lb bird a little over two hours, but we probably checked on it a little more often, which reduced the temp. We should have taken a pic because it was perfectly golden brown with an internal temp of 180. I also brined it for 24 hours in a light salt/little sugar solution with a few garlic cloves, bay leaves, and sliced onion. The flavor was primo. We are definitely doing this again!

Tried this, but nothing like rotisserie from the market.  Their secret is to inject seasoning into the meat and this recipe completely omits that.  Skin was crispy and flavorful, but without injection, meat was bland.  Put the leftovers into a nice curry.

This is a good seasoning for rotisserie chicken, especially if you rotisserie your meat to be used in another meal...soup, chilli or something.  Remember to tie up the legs and wings and use a drip pan to avoid flare-ups.  I use olive oil instead of butter and baste every 20 minutes.  Helps me to keep the  eye on the bbq temperature and flare ups.  We have had a leg come loose once that pushed the drip 'pan' into the rotisserie which caused a large amount of flames that we noticed quickly.  But good recipe...

Another 5 star reviewer here.  It was the first time I used the rotisserie on my Weber LP system.  I have a very large grill, and did two chickens on the spit.  Unfortunately, I forgot to double the ingredients for the baste.  I turned on all burners, got grill to 450, left all burners on and cooked for ten minutes.  Put on the baste (enough to cover both chickens once), turned off center burners, and cooked 1:40 on indirect heat.  Came out PERFECT and DELICIOUS!

Easy and Delicious! Usually, when we're done with the first making of Rotisserie chicken, it goes out to the cats, but this time, we stripped the carcass and used it for Chicken Tacos the next night! The ingredients compliment just about anything else you want to use the chicken in, so we didn't mind eating/making another recipe with the chicken.

Can someone help me? I never know what kind of butter to add to these recipes. Do I use salted, or unsalted? I wish that was included to avoid my confusion! Thanks.

Disclaimer: I've NEVER used a rotisserie for anything before so I'm rating with little experience but here goes....
I read the reviews prior and made sure to modify the recipe slightly as suggested. I made sure to pin up the legs and wings. I made sure to put a tray underneath the chicken while on the rotisserie and I added white wine to the tray underneath. I added more wine to the tray about halfway through cooking and instantly realized that was a bad idea as I almost burnt off my eyebrows. I also made sure to leave the Centre (of 3) burners OFF on the BBQ as mentioned in other comments. I followed the rest of the recipe to a tee. It was one of the juiciest chickens I have EVER eaten. Really really really good. I don't know why I haven't done this before. Really quite simple and sooooooo yummy!

We loved this recipe! Just added a little dried oregano and garlic to the spice mix. Turned out a beautiful color, very moist and great flavor from our oven rotisserie.
Two other tweaks: added a little water to the under the chicken to create more of a sauce, and I also threw in some vegetables (carrots, onion, garlic, potatoes) to roast about halfway through cooking.

Excellent recipe! Change nothing but as others state, tie the chicken, cook indirect heat or at least put something under to prevent flare ups. This is the family BBQ go to now. Everyone asks for it over and over again. Thanks!

I really love this recipe and fix it often.  I do however use a brine for chicken available on this site.  I brine the chicken only for about 3 to 4 hours or it's too salty, then I omit the 1 tablespoon salt from this basic recipe.
You have to determine what the temperature of your grill is, some are much hotter than others, my grill is super hot so I have to cook this recipe at almost it lowest setting or even on the cool side.  The results are always wonderful, but...you have to monitor the cooking process, it doesn't do it on it's own.  If you know how please let me know.

Absolutely could not be any easier!  Put the chicken on the Grill with the Rotisserie.  Had a few issues with the grill and even with those the chicken was moist, full of flavor, and generally fantastic!  Only thing I would caution on is know your BBQ grill.  The high setting on my grill would have been way to much so cut it back to 3/4.  Also, only used the burners not directly under the Rotisserie to avoid flare ups and burning.  All in all I am looking forward to cooking chicken this way again!

Man! This was easy and good! I followed ingredients exactly. Method I changed just a bit due to the fact I was using a times machine, not one I could set on high, med, low. I also pulled the skin up off the breasts and put some of the seasoning mix under the skin. I cooked for only an hour and 5 minutes and let my machine rotate without heat for an additional 10. It came out perfect!!! I NEVER eat the skin off a chicken and I did this time. It was that good!

I found an easier way to add the spices: just sprinkle the chicken with Hy's Seasoning Salt (no MSG) If you cannot find that brand, other seasoning salts may be used.  Normally, I prepare a stuffing with onions and celery (sometimes I also add mushrooms) sauteed in butter with pepper and poultry seasoning (a bit difficult to find in the U.S. but readily available in Canada). After the onion and celery (and mushrooms) are softened, I add bread cubes (any bread that is getting a bit old and stale -- whole wheat and light rye bread are favourites).  I then stuff and truss the chicken before I put it on the rotisserie. I usually cook a 3lb. chicken about 90 minutes. I cook it over a pan made with aluminum foil. The resulting drippings yield enough fat to make a delicious gravy (with home-made salt-free chicken stock).

Ummm . . . no. I am a 'from scratch' kind of cook most of the time, but even I realized early on that this was a huge waste of time, money and effort. Rotisserie chicken from the supermarket is fairly inexpensive and quite juicy and delicious. From now own, that's where I'll get my rotisserie chicken and spend my time in the kitchen on recipes that I can make better than the local supermarket.

A good recipe for starters but I made my own spice rub with brown sugar, smoked paprika, sea salt, ground peppercorn, garlic powder, onion powder, finely chopped fresh rosemary, and lemongrass paste. Apply the rub generously and put it in your rotisserie at 350 degrees for 30 mins per pound. I put a drip pan underneath with about 3/4 cup wine (or you can use apple juice). As the drippings mix in the pan it makes for a good gravy or basting sauce.

We may not find out how good this might be.  We put it on the grill, following all instructions, and after the first 10 minutes on high, before basting it and turning the heat down, they were BLACK.  They're still out there, so we'll see what happens.

Just made this for dinner and it turned out amazing! =) Followed the recipe exactly except we used olive oil instead of butter. We trussed the chicken & turned off the middle burner. Also smoked it with hickory wood chips. My husband said that hands down this was the best chicken he's ever had! It was so moist and tender-each piece literally melted in my mouth. Yum! Definitely the best recipe i've tried from this site!

I too used olive oil and I added a bit of garlic salt.  The skin was delicious and the meat was tender and juicy.  I just wish the flavor of the skin would seep into the meat.  I might have to try and inject the chickens next time.

I don’t see why everyone is complaining. A tad salty but turned out great! And there’s a video to watch that clearly shows to tie the legs and wings. I put a small pan under it to catch the drippings, basted twice and checked every 20 min. High for 10-15 min. All burners on medium minus the rotisserie one. Internal thigh temp 180F and done!

I made this chicken yesterday. It was very helpful to watch the video first, then read the recipe for tips like tying the legs and securing the chicken, etc. I added some other stuff to the butter mix used for basting like oregano, onion powder, garlic powder, and very little BBQ sauce. We loved this recipe and btw its my first time cooking an actual rotesserie  chicken. I always just oven bake it in a dish. I think I will be using this recipe alot more often. Thank you!

Best rotisserie chicken I've made.  One can adjust the salt if needed.  I make it as is, comes out perfect.  Great for sandwiches.

Tried it last weekend and it turned out very well.
After reading some of the reviews I decided to cut the amount of salt. And the results were fantastic, the chicken remained nice and juicy. The only real thing I did differently was I placed a pan with water below the chicken.

I bought a new fancy grill with a rotisserie and used this recipe as it's maiden voyage. The chicken was perfect. I followed the recipe exactly and my family loved it! I have since made it again because it was so easy. The second time around I added garlic and onion powder and stuffed the chicken with half an onion. I think it was better with the original recipe as described here.

Chicken came out very moist and looked great. I will cut the salt in half next time as it was a bit on the salty side.

Been doing chicken on rotisserie for several years. Actually only looked at this recipe because ex took  my cookbooks. Dang I miss them! Good tips to tie all loose flappy things down. Foil works, however I always turn off burners under food, and use an old beat up cake pan to catch juices, etc. Would agree cut salt in half. Good luck. Update 6/19/18: Trying cherry wood smoke, and Goya adobo seasoning in olive oil. Smells great .

I use this recipe for chicken breast. I don't usually buy a whole chicken from the store, and I think that this is fantastic for breasts! I mainly use this recipe to make shredded chicken taste better. I cut my chicken up, and then i put some of the sauce on the chicken, put it into the oven for around 30 minutes, or so. Then I take the chicken out, and I shred it with a fork and a knife, and then I put the chicken back in and I let it sit in the oven, soaking in the juices. Amazing recipe for simple shredded chicken. I personally would use this chicken in tacos, for kids who aren't used to spicy foods, but you are trying to get them into it. Or just to toss in a salad later!

This is only our second time using our grill's rotisserie attachment for the grill.  This recipe knocked the much more complex one out of the park!  Delicious and easy to make!  I wish I had a picture.  It was perfect.  Like others mentioned, we tied down his wings and legs.  I made some chicken broth out of the carcass that I'm canning right now!  Yum!  Savings as our go to recipe!

Didn’t change anything to the recipe and will definitely do it again! It was absolutely delicious! I used and organic chicken and did this recipe on my Weber grill with rotisserie attachment and charcoal briquettes. I placed some sliced potatoes, carrots and cambray (spring onions) underneath the chicken on the drip pan with a bit of olive oil, salt and pepper and were delicious too.

So fast and easy to put together. Made recipe as written and flavor was outstanding. End result reminded me of a ready made rotisserie chicken you'd pick up at the grocery store, but much better for you than store bought. Will definitely make recipe again!

Great basic recipe.  I replaced 1/2 the butter with olive oil and only used 1 tsp salt to make it healthier.  I also substituted lemon pepper for the black pepper added a TBSP garlic powder.  My husband loved it.

This is a tasty, easy recipe.  I found the first 10 minutes on high too much for my gas grill, I'll probably do 7 minutes next time.  I also cooked it on low for another hour, not on medium.  This  is just my grill, overall the recipe is delicious.  I did add garlic granules as a seasoning also.

The family loved it. I basted it with the sauce every 10 minutes, and I made extra sauce to do so. Like the others have mentioned, I used only the sideburners, leaving the burner directly under the chicken off, and I tied the wings to the body of the chicken with string; I used the rotisserie forks to hold the legs in. My infrared BBQ doesn't flame up otherwise I would've put a pan with liquid under the chicken. I also put and orange (I've used apple or a lemon) inside the cavity of the chicken which helps to keep it very stable while rotating, and you can add a pinch of extra flavor.

Turned out awesome! I cut back on the salt,  put some pieces of lemon, 1/2 an onion cut up into pieces, and some garlic cloves in the inside of the chicken before tying up the legs and wings. Added some garlic powder and rosemary to the basting mixture. Excellent!

The chicken had incredible taste! Everyone loved it! I only had smoked paprika and I cut back a bit on the salt - just a bit. I'm now making it for the second time. Tastes at least as good as Sam's rotisserie chicken.

I agree with Chef Daddy Pete - make sure you tie the wings and legs and cook indirect.

I made it using a rotisserie on a propane barbecue. It was good, better than super market rotisserie chicken. However, while the spice package was good, I would prefer something saltier and with a little more kick. I also think it needed to be injected under the skin. The meat was juicy but lack enough seasoning. The skin was not as crispy as I would have liked, as I get with beer can chicken. That is probably due to basting and constant rotating of the bird. But overall, still good.

It was a bit too salty, will use less salt next time. Added lemon wedges, garlic and onions in the cavity turned out very moist.  Will definitely try it again!!

Truss it, season it with salt and pepper, stick a thermometer in and relax. Let the rotisserie do its magic.
Juicy, tender deliciousness awaits. I've been cooking whole  chickens this way for years. There's something about the way it's cooked this way (on the rotisserie) that makes it easy and fun and simply delicious.

This was my first go at rotisserie cooking. Thank you so much, all those that shared their experiences in rotisserie cooking a chicken. Even with all the  information shared by all the reviewers, I still had some concerns about how to proceed. Below I mention a few that I was uncertain about:
1) How  big a drip pan is needed? I have a three burner 
Weber grill. Over the burners are metal shields to prevent dripping oil from fouling the burners. Then there are two more not over burners. My pan was about 11" long and one 1-1/4 inches deep. I removed the two grill surfaces and lay the drip pan on the three center shields (not over burners one and three). 11 inches long is long enough to catch the drippings from one chicken - maybe not two chickens. I put about half an inch of water in it. The water boils away, but checking it at 20 min intervals to baste showed that the pan needed to be recharged, but was not nearly empty.
2). What temperature in meant by the words "high and medium?" For the first 10 minutes I used a grill temperature of 450 deg. F. For the the remainder of the time I used a temperature of 325 deg. F. Next time I will use 350 deg. T.
3) What if your chicken is 4.3 lb instead of the 3 to 3-1/2 lb as in the recipe? I tested the chicken temperature at 1 hr 30 min and got 179 deg. (180 is the target, right?) So, I went another 20 min at a grill temperature of 350 deg. and got a chicken temperature indication 182 deg.
4) How low an environmental air temperature can y

I made it with a mustard, paprika, pepper, honey and dill rub. It was very good. I also put some jalapeno peppers in the oven alongside the chicken. It was very good!

Tried this recipe for the first time. I wasn't sure which temperature to use when the instructions indicate "turn the grill down to medium". I started at 392F, then to 347F and stayed at 302 Fahrenheit. I added sliced lemon inside the cavity. This is a great recipe and will keep it as one of my AllRecipes favorites.

Really good, use any seasonings you like to punch it up a bit. But the thing I think that made the most difference was the use of hickory wood chips in the grill. It gave the chicken a fabulous smoky flavor.

This is simply the simplest and most delicious recipe I have ever used.  The chick was moist and flavorful and the basting liquid gave the chicken a luscious subtle flavor.    Will use this again and again.
