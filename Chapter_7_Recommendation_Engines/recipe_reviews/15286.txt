Very Good and VERY SWEET!  Might consider cutting back on the powdered sugar next time.  I made them for a family pool party and the in-laws love them!

I just did not enjoy the texture of these I had an idea of what the flavor may be and I was disappointed.  I thought the taste of a margarita would be more apparent it just was not there.

These were an interesting change of pace. Just enough alcohol, not overpowering.

Awesome! I made them for a party and I have already given out the recipe to 3 people.  We used different color food coloring for a rainbow effect.

I followed the reciepe to the letter- but came out simular to cookie dough(soft&gooy) in texture- I figured would have the same texture as the no-bake rumball reciepe off this site- guess I'll keep searching for other margarita ball reciepe

I chilled the filling in small batches to help make the soft sticky dough easier to roll which worked well enough.  I really wanted to like these and I keep trying them all day at the potluck, but the balance of sweet/salty/lime just seemed off to me and I couldn't quite pinpoint a fix.  I suspect it depends a lot on the margarita mix you use.
