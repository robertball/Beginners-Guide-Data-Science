I added heavy whipping cream to the recipe. it helped it have more moisture. they tasted just like a real brownie, and even added in in the healthy factor. I love these brownies. I would recommend this recipe to anyone looking for a healthy alternative to the average brownie.

I made this pretty close to a 'T'.  Except I subbed in xylitol and raw sugar for the sweetener.  It needed more chocolate and was too egg-ey.  Personally, I would add a few squares baking chocolate and cut back to three eggs for more of a true fudgey, dark chocolate brownie.

I made this Keto friendly and changed quite a bit.

Added 100g of 90% cocoa chocolate to the melted coconut oil and cocoa, then added a tablespoon of granulated Splenda and let it combine until smooth.

The eggs - beat with electric egg beater for a few minutes, then added half a cup of full cream and used double the vanilla (paste). I substituted sugar for granulated Splenda and used 3/4 of a cup (this needs to be pulsed to a fine powder in a magic bullet for about 30 seconds... It reduces to about 1/3 of a cup). Beat it in gradually to the cream, eggs, vanilla and salt.

Added half a cup of almonds.

Baked 30ish minutes, cut into 12, 190 calories per slice. Tasted amazing!

Made these to take to a friend's house for dessert. I chose this recipe because I was out of regular flour. I followed the recipe exactly. They baked evenly and came out of the pan easily but the flavor is quite coconut-y and the texture is extremely spongy from all the eggs. I don't think they are good enough to serve to others who might be looking for a standard brownie. I'll be chucking these in the trash and making mini cheesecakes instead. Annoyed that I wasted half a dozen eggs on this recipe.

I think this recipe was fantastic! I didn't use the chocolate chips and used regular Coconut Oil instead of Extra Virgin. It still tasted great, moist flavorful and wouldn't have guessed it was gluten and dairy free!! I made a second batch for a coworker and added pecans, still delicious! My gluten and Dairy sensitive friends were able to enjoy!

I added some chopped up dark chocolate (72%) into the batter, and only baked it for 23 minutes.  The edge is already very dry, so I think the 35 minutes is ridiculous - I would bake for 20-25 and then take it out and let it finish setting.  The texture is very strange with the 6 eggs - if I made this again I would use fewer eggs to more closely resemble brownie texture.  And I'., but not amazing.

I followed the recipe with the exception of the following adjustments: I used 1/2 cup coconut sugar in place of white sugar and doubled the vanilla and added a few tablespoons of coconut milk along with cutting down the cooking time to 20 minutes. They turned out moist but  I think the eggs could be cut down to 4 with more milk added and possibly some almond extract to give them more flavor.

I added all dry ingredients together and separately all the wet ingredients together.   I melted the coconut oil on half power in the microwave for one minute, added to eggs and vanilla essence. Combined all together, baked middle shelf for the full 35mins.....PERFECT! Easy! Delicious! I didn't have any choc chips so added half a miniature daim to the top....made 20 squares. Just wish I knew the nutritional value for each.
If you don't like coconut, you won't like these as you can taste choc and coconut after baking.

I made this recipe because I bought my first bag of coconut flour and I wanted to see what I could use it for. And I have to say I LOVED this recipe and it turned out perfect! Not too soggy or too sweet. And the chocolate with the coconut taste divine! I did some adjustments, I only baked 6 servings, so I adjusted the measurements for that and also only baked the brownies for about 25 minutes. Definitely will do again!

A real brownie! These are very simple to make. I made this with the exact ingredients written but only half the recipe. I baked it in a 4" cake pan at 165°C and it baked perfectly in 32 minutes. Allow to cool before cutting, removing from pan or making judgements. At first it seems like a nice chocolate cake. After cooling they begin to get their brownie characteristic of crumbly tops and rich and moist middles. The description is a bit misleading though. My idea of "healthy" and the recipe submitter's idea are different. To me the cholesterol in this brownie is a luxury my family can't afford often. The use of coconut oil is better than butter, but 6 eggs leaves you with 82 mg of cholesterol per serving. The problem is, once you try them you're hooked, they're just darn good! This is definitely a brownie worth trying; albeit only every once in a while when you can indulge if you are watching your cholesterol. Thank you walbome for sharing your recipe.

Not a bad brownie. Followed recipe except, I used Truvia in place of white sugar, 4 eggs instead of six, and crushed almonds on top instead of chocolate chips. I also added about a fourth cup of heavy cream. I don’t usually modify recipes this much, but I don’t like desserts that are too eggy and I wanted to make it more of a keto brownie. Thanks for sharing.

It was warm enough in my house to not heat the coconut oil in a pan first, I just mixed it all with a beater and used coconut oil instead of olive oil! This is. Great recipe!

I reduced sugar to 1/2 cup  and added 2 scoops of chocolate protein powder also added  just a bit more oil to compensate for the added dry ingredients to keep it from being as dry cooked it  for less time(20-25 min) it is slightly doughy in the middle but stiffens up when refrigerated, served it cold.  Sooo Good

These were great, but I made a couple of changes to the recipe: 3 tbsp of whipping cream added to the egg mixture to help with moisture; used 1/2 cup of stevia as a substitute for the sugar; 1/2 tsp baking powder to help them rise a bit; and added pecans to the top instead of chocolate chips. I also only baked these for 25 minutes. Overall, delicious for the first dessert I've made with coconut flour, yum!

These were delicious!  I made them for a friend, but I would make them for my family just because they were that good.  If you like the combination of chocolate and coconut then you will love these.  I baked them for the full 35 minutes and they were perfect.

It was great even better after couple of days. I used canola oil in the second baking, It turned out too dry because I had used all the coconut oil for the first batch. Please, don't mind going to buy one~

I really enjoyed this. It was SO easy to make and turned out perfect. The texture was soft! I will say if you don't like coconut then you MAY not like these because they do have that hint of coconut flavor. 

I didn't have chocolate chip so I skipped that and it worked out perfectly.

I will probably aim for less sugar but wouldn't change anything else!

I actually made a 1/6th recipe, perfect for just one (or two) people! I added a tiny bit of baking soda, and used half white sugar and half Stevia (for keto!). I baked half of the batter in the microwave, it took about 50 seconds. This turned out amazing! It's an extremely addictive recipe

I used half Hershey's cocoa powder and half Black Onyx Cocoa powder form a specialty spice store, they came out so dark, chocolatey, and amazing! Oh, and I also stirred chocolate chips into the mix and then added more on top before baking, cause who doesn't love extra chocolate? I loved it, and my gluten-free dairy-free friends loved it even more!

I left it in the oven for 25 minutes and it was very dry. It tasted like coconut with a hint of chocolate. I think a scoop of vanilla ice cream will help it go down easier ;)

Since this was my first time baking with coconut flour, I followed the recipe exactly.  The brownies are very flat and very dense. They are VERY cake like and not "fudgy" or soft in any way.   I'm not sure of the chemistry of coconut flour with baking soda but I was surprised none was used in the recipe.  I feel like this recipe would need to be tweaked in order to have a softer, moister brownie.  Maybe 1/4 of water added?  I may play with it but with 6 eggs in each batch that could get expensive.

I substituted stevia for sugar and used Lily's chocolate chips. They came out dry. I won't leave them in the oven as long next time.

Searching the internet for Keto brownies and my search led me to Allrecipes (my go-to foodie site). Anyway, after looking over the recipe, I read the reviews and decided to incorporate most comments from Buckwheat Queen and some from Traycee1234.  I think what most people are unaware of is that coconut flour is tricky. Before you use it in a recipe, once you measure the correct amount, you must sift the flour, otherwise, it will clump. I made these brownies today, but halved it. I made it 100% Keto.  I used 4 jumbo eggs (two had double yolks),  1/4 cup Ghirardelli  unsweetened cocoa, 1/4 cup + 1-1/2 Tbs. Coconut oil,  1/2 cup Splenda,  1/4 teaspoon each baking powder, sea salt and Mexican vanilla, 1/4 cup coconut flour, sifted (after you measure amount), and 2 Tbs. Lily's (or Hershey's) sugar-free (Stevia sweetened) chocolate chips.  I baked the brownies in a fluted mini bundt pan (6 inch and placed it on a cookie sheet) for 32 minutes. When tested, they were perfect. Cool completely in the pan, on a wire rack, before cutting. These are amazing brownies ---moist, delicious and Keto. Thank you Walbome for sharing, and Buckwheat Queen and Traycee1234 for your suggestions.

These were very good for a grain free brownie. I added an extra tablespoon of oil to keep it moist. I also added some raspberry extract. Mine were done at 30 minutes. Since the recipe has so many eggs, they taste better cold or at room temperature than right out of the oven. I really like the chocolate chips in this because they make the brownies a little bit gooey.

I made this but hate eggy tasting foods so I only added 3 eggs.  It tastes like brownies.  I don't normally eat gluten free so I wasn't sure what to expect.  I made them for a dance banquet where some of the kids eat gluten-free.  My husband and daughter (who hate everything) said "huh, taste like brownies."    I would make again.

This is my first gluten-free recipe that I tried. I’m taking them to a party where my boss is gluten-free but I did taste them and they’re really good. I cut it down to five eggs based on some other reviews. I had everything else on hand. Let’s see how they like them.

I love this recipe! I have a gluten free sister, a dairy free sister and I’m nightshade free (no potato starch) and we can all eat these brownies yay!

Make it with butter and drinking chocolate and it still turned out amazing

These are awesome! So rich and chocolatey. You need only a small piece. I used extra dark chocolate chips on top, I also added 2 tbsp sour cream to the batter since I know coconut  flour can make food dry. They came out very moist. My husband thinks they taste a little like chocolate macaroons.

Sorry, didn’t like them.  The coconut oil seemed to settle at the bottom.  I think if I ever make them again I’d use an electric mixer.

The recipe as written did not work. As soon as the coconut oil and chocolate mixture hits the eggs it clumps and the final product is very eggy like another reviewer mentioned with little clumps of chocolate in it. I solved this problem by adding about 1/4 cup of chopped dark chocolate(chocolate chips should work fine as well) to the oil-cocoa mixture to emulsify the oil and allow it to blend in smoothly.  It worked and the modified recipe turned out much better. I would give the modification four stars and will make them again when needed(ie. Passover) but they are no substitute for real brownies.  I think I will try substituting almond flour for the coconut flour too.

Honestly I made this because I'm trying to use up my coconut flour. Like most gluten free recipes, it's texturally different from its gluten-y relatives. To me this felt more like a dense chocolate cake. It looks crazy that you'd use that many eggs but it is right.

My friends and picky kids liked it, so I consider it a winner.

I followed the recipe to a T. The brownies were a bit dry. If I make this again I will shorten the cook time. This may prevent the dryness. The flavor was  okay. It did not satisfy my brownie craving.

This is the second recipe from your email indicating this recipe is low carb. Guess who can't be believed any more.  

Allrecipes, you may actually want to look at the recipes you're sending out as 'low carb'.

I really like this recipe, the texture was great! However, I really screwed it up lol. I tried to use Stevia instead of sugar, big mistake. Not nearly sweet enough, sooo bitter. I also used canola oil instead of coconut oil (don't like the taste) and that seemed to work fine. Needless to say next time I will be using actual sugar.

I really liked these and a great glutein free option that tastes chocolatey. The only change I would make would be to bake them less than 35 minutes. I used a glass pan, so that may be why, but they came out a little more cakey than expected. I did add extra chocolate chips since you can never have too much chocolate!

Made these as a gluten free option for the kids...we all loved it. I am not a big fan of coconut oil as I find the flavor intense, will try with butter instead next time for the oil. Very soft, very moist...excellent recipe.

This was a good recipe. But the brownies were a little grainy. I think it was the coconut flour. Has anyone else had this issue?

I had to swap out the eggs and used egg replacer. Tasted great. Also used non dairy choc chips due to diet restrictions.

I used olive oil instead of coconut oil and obviously didn't need to heat it. They were delicious. I would make them again.

I followed exactly a we have dairy and gluten sensitivity. This is a good recipe for us and healthy.  Turned out cake like which was fine. More like a chocolate coconut cake for coffee time, next time would under bake to be more brownie like. Husband liked the mild coconut flavor, might add toasted coconut on top next time

Yes, I did make it (for a swim team party where I was asked to provide  gluten-free brownies). Had to practice first, right? Like pretty much everyone else, I tempered with the recipe, substituting 3/4 C. maple syrup for the sugar. Baked 25 minutes, left in turned-off but warm oven for another 30 minutes. Very good (and moist, yet dense). Do not quite satisfy like my Chowning Tavern brownies recipe does, but  very good alternative.

If you like coconut, you will like these brownies.  They were chocolaty, dense and delicious!

An odd texture for my palette (though I'm not used to gluten free foods). I took this to a party and was asked repeatedly for the recipe. A success just not a personal favorite.

made these for the second time today. I halved the cocoa as some suggested and used 4 eggs and only a couple chocolate chips on top. They came out perfect moist and soft . Baked at 350 for 25 minutes. love the coconut flavor not too overpowering
