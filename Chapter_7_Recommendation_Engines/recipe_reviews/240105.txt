This dish started out smelling really flavourful, but as I added the vegetables and noodles it got really diluted. The cilantro and green peppers really stood out in flavour, but I would recommend adding some more spices.

Delicious and full of flavor. I had to leave out the fish oil (allergies) and improvised a bit on the veggies. This makes a great meal when you are in a rush and need something quick yet filling. Thank you for the recipe.
