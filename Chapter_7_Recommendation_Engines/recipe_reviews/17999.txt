We love this one!!!  Tastes great but admittedly, I kicked it up a bit by adding some Cajun seasoning and using chipotle seasoning instead of cayenne.  I cooked this dish on the stove instead of the microwave (it scares me to microwave shrimp for 10 minutes!!) At any rate, I have a few tips to conserve money and ingredients.  I don't use a lot of celery so I bought what I needed from a salad bar in the market (.37 cents versus $1.50 for a bunch of celery that will wind up in the garbage anyways).  Also, I use a toothpaste type squeeze thing of tomato paste (Amore Brand - supposedly the best) that's available usually at a supermarket near the other Italian sauces aisle.  I use Thai rice as I prefer the taste (Nishan Brand, Jasmine that comes in a 4 lb sack and cooks up nicely if you follow the directions and is just about the right amount for this dish - 1 cup rice, 2 cups water, 1Tbsp butter). The cooking times remained about the same - seems like a bit too long for the shrimp but keep in mind that the addition of the soup cools the other stuff down so 10 more minutes of cooking still left the shrimp tender.  We loved this so much we made it two nights in a row.  The first night we had shrimp and large sea scallops (1Lb total) and the second we had it with shrimp, large sea scallops, and swordfish cut into bite-size pieces and substituted Cream of Shrimp.  We both thought it was somewhat better with Cream of Chicken - also, used butter and not margarine.

I'm the original TEXICANTWIN who posted this recipe...lost my old email info and password so I've created a new profile.  It's important to note that yes, this can obviously be cooked on the stovetop easily and that you can totally play around with the amounts and kinds of seasonings. At home I make this spicier and for a different group I'll make it with less of a kick.  

I love it that people are taking this starter recipe and twisting it to their unique tastes!  I've made this recipe using shrimp, crawfish, chicken, crab and fish.  I've used margarine or butter, depending on what I had more of in the fridge.  It all depends on what you are in the mood for.  

*In recent years I have decreased the amount of time I cook the shrimp in the microwave.  I've been adding it last so that it doesn't overcook. Remember, a "c" shape is done but an "o" is overcooked.*

Good and fast recipie.  I followed the recipie to the tee.  However, i found that it was kind of bland and noticed that there was something missing.  I added a bay leaf and a couple dashes (1/2-3/4 tbsp) of Worchester (sp?) sauce, what a difference!  it was yummy after the addition!

I was very skeptical of this recipe.  My husband grew up in New Orleans so I knew he'd never go for a microwaved Etouffee.  But, to our surprise it was great (as good as any others I've made) and I've shared it with family members.

Great recipe! So simple and good. Will make it again. I used red peppers instead of green and used salsa instead of tomato paste(I was out) and it was super!

This is an excellent and ver-r-r-r-y easy recipe to prepare.  I actually made it in a saute pan insead of the microwave and added a little more red pepper to spice it up more.  I also added about 1/4 cup milk as the final step because it seemed a little thick to me.  It's a great and quick week night dinner.

This is a wonderful "one dish" meal.  

To lighten it up, I used 1/2 of the margarine and 98% fat free cream of chicken soup.

We will definitely make this dish again.

This is such good etouffee!  I made a few small modifications:  I made it on the stove top instead of the microwave.  I sauteed the veggies in butter (not margarine) until they were tender, then added all the remaining ingredients and seasonings and let that cook for about another 10 minutes or so.  To the seasonings, I added a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce, a bay leaf, some cajun seasoning (to taste), and to thin it out a bit at the end I added some white wine, about 1/4 to 1/2 cup or so.  It really adds a lot of flavor.  My husband (who is cajun) even gives this recipe 5 stars, and he's picky about his cajun food!  Definitely a family favorite now.

I was curious how this microwave recipe would turn out.  You may have to adjust the microwave cooking time depending on how your fast your microwave works.  I microwaved it for less than the recipe called for.  I think I did the veggies for 7 minutes.  Next time I'll try 6 minutes. I used defrosted cooked frozen shrimp so I cooked it for a shorter time when I added the shrimp so they wouldn't become rubbery.  My husband doesn't like stuff too spicy so I only added 1/8 tsp hot pepper sauce & 1/8 tsp cayenne & just brought some hot sauce to the table.

This was excellent.  It was easy to make, tasted great, and best of all was easy to clean up afterwards.  Also, if you chop up the veggies ahead of time it takes practically no time to throw it together.

This recipe is really really good.  Very easy to make (that is after you chop up the vegetables).  The first microwave meal that comes out tasting like it took hours to make on the stove.  I also like the fact that you can make as hot or mild as you like.  AWESOME!!!

Yummy, we loved this. Great for a weekday meal. I used a lower fat spread in place of margarine and reduced fat soups and it worked good. I would try a little lemon juice in it next time.

4 stars - I came in with low expectations (based on the fact that the idea doesn't use a roux, uses condensed soup, and can be made in a microwave), and was pleasantly surprised.  

I had an idea of what etouffee is supposed to look like, and this didn't match the picture I had in my head.  I remember thinking "etouffee is supposed to be reddish brown...something is wrong here..."  

That being said, I thought it was a very solid meal.  The flavor was pretty true to the flavor profile I would expect.  I was pleasantly surprised, and if you're pinched for time, this is definitely a good way to get your cajun fix.  

I would be sure to put in a bay leaf, add some cajun spice, and some worcestershire sauce.

Soo very good! I always double this recipe, because as is, it simply isn't enough for my husband and me.  I don't have a microwave, but cook it over the stove. I sautee the green pepper, onion, and green onions first in the butter until soft and then add the garlic for a minute and then the shrimp.  Then I add the sauce stuff.  I usually use the 98% fat reduced Cream of Chicken soup with no ill effects.  Tip: Buy smaller, cheaper shrimp for this as it will give you more shrimp throughout. Typically, we buy Jumbo shrimp but there are just too few shrimp when we do that.  Medium works better.

I love this recipe!  I made it for my family but they are not big on cajun or anything with shrimp, crawfish, etc. I loved it!  Simple, quick and easy!  Goes great with a salad and a loaf of crusty french bread.

I was very excited to try this recipe since shrimp is one of my favorite foods.  I didn't do much to change this recipe.  The sauce was a bit too thick for me so I added chicken broth until I got the right consistency. I added a little more hot sauce & cayenne pepper to my taste.  I cooked the sauce on the stove top instead of the microwave and sauteed the shrimp separate in a skillet then added to the sauce last minute so not to overcook the shrimp. I arranged the sauce on top of angel hair pasta. This would be a good company meal and I will fix it again.  Thank you

I really enjoy reading everyones reviews before trying a new dish, & taking a bit of advice from all.  Makes for a great meal!  I decided to go with the stove top version.  Due to the thickness of the sauce, added 1/2c of white wine & 1/2c chicken broth. Also added 1/4 tsp of creole seasoning and it was perfect. I agree with others this didn't serve 6. I used it for 3 with a bit leftover.  Look forward to making this one again!

Tried this recipe but I cooked on the stove so I know you can convert it and it is an eceptional delight.  This is a great tasting recipe for all you who do not like to cook in the microwave.

Me, I like it the Cajun way with a brown roux (you can make it in the microwave if you must), and a dash or two of Lea & Perrins. Chopped scallion tops and a few lemon slices make a pretty presentation, too! Yes, I'm from Houma and N'awlins myself.

My partner and I loved this!  Modifications I employed were adding a tblsp of Worcestershire sauce and a bay leaf as suggested by another user, a can of cream of celery soup, a cup of chicken stock, a cup of Pinot Grigio instead of the cream of chicken.  My partner does not like spice but I do so i added paprika, garlic hot sauce, and a dash of salt.  I also used unsalted butter rather than margarine.  I have been to New Orleans, Baton Rouge, and Lafayette.  This recipe is very comparable to the delicious delicacies of the French creole chefs there.

This recipe is awesome! I've made it several times and everytime I get rave reviews. Whenever I make this I always cook it on the stovetop. Also, I modify it slightly by using 1/2 lb. of salad shrimp. I find it to works better when using it with grits or rice. I also use cream of chicken with herbs by Cambells. Finally, I use basil, garlic, and oregano tomato paste by Hunts. I find by substituting these few ingredients it makes the recipe more favorful. Enjoy!

Wow! This was tasty.
I kicked it up a notch with extra hot sauce, but you could definitely stick with original measurements and it would be great as well.

This is so delicious and very easy to make!  Instead of utilizing the microwave, I prefer to use the stove and saute everything.  I use butter instead of margarine and add more garlic than what the recipe calls for but other than that, I follow the original.  I keep it mild b/c I have two children but keep the hot sauce on the table to spice it up for my husband & myself.  Highly recommend this!

Very yummy and flavorful.  A little on the spicy side for little ones, but still went over well!

This is pretty good. I halfed the hot sauce because I have younger children and I was worried about it being too spicy. I just put hot sauce on the table for people to add to their soup at their own discretion. At first it looks really thick, but then the shrimp shrink SIGNFICANTLY and it soup thins out, just a warning - this was my first soup with shrimp and I wasn't aware.

Had never eaten Etouffee before. This was very tasty! And easy to prepare. My son who loves cajun food also thought it was very good. He requested next time we make it with crawfish.

I used the ingredients exactly as written except for adding 1 teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce and a bay leaf.  I choose to cook it on the stove rather than the microwave.  My husband couldn't quit raving about it and I loved it, too.

This recipe was AWESOME!!!!!  I followed the recipe as is, but took advice from the others and added some worcestershire sauce and a bay leaf.  They are both necessary ingrediants for this recipe.  I agree that the 6 serving size is not accurate at all.  I wish I had doubled the recipe so we could have had more leftovers.  Definitely a keeper!!!!!

I didn't have tomato paste so I used a small can of tomato sauce and added 1/4 tsp of Cagun seasoning.  It was still delicious.  It seems you can't do much to hurt this recipe. I too was leary of the microwave cooking, but it worked great.

This recipe is fabulous. I actually used Cream of Mushroom soup, red instead of green peppers, and "fake" shrimp, and it was still fabulous. I also did not use the microwave.

A friend and I cooked this up to take to a party. It was a total hit! I didn't think it would be as good as it turned out. I got a thumb's up from two Cajun friends so, I guess I was wrong.

Very easy to make and tastes great.  I added the full 1/4 ts. of hot pepper sauce (maybe a dash extra) and while I thought it was just right, some may prefer Kay's suggestion that she just adds four dashes and brings the hot stuff to the table for those not into spicy meals.

This was SO yummy!  I substituted the butter with a drizzle of olive oil and it was awesome.  I also got the diced veggies from the salad bar at the grocery store. With that shortcut this is a super quick and easy meal.  Thank you for the recipe.

I'm not really sure what I did wrong, but it ended up tasting like cream of chicken soup shrimp. One of the worst crash and burns I've made in a long time.

Back to Shrimp Scampi for me sadly.

good! I was very skeptical because of the ease and microwave use, but don't be put off. It is delish! I actually didn't use the microwave but rather sauteeed the first 6 ingredients for a few minutes before adding the last six. It doesn't get any easier or more delicious. However, I chose to make my own cream of chicken soup because I don't like using canned stuff. Personal preference which I'm sure is not necessary. Enjoy! My family sure did! PS: To make this kid-friendly, I just scooped out a portion and cooked seperately before I added the cayenne and tabasco to the main pot. It still tasted good & my 6 year old devoured it.

I couldn't bring myself to microwave shrimp, so I did everything in a pan.  It was bland and I added a lot of spice.  It still just tasted like cream of chicken soup with spices in it.  I only gave it two stars because I ate a few servings because i didn't want to waste the shrimp.

I made this last night on the stove top. I did not have hot sauce. I used red pepper flakes instead. I also added some sausage as well. This dish was fantastic!! My husband loved it too. It was easy and great. I will add this to the line-up. My husband even complimented me on dinner before going to bed and he RARELY does that so I know it was tasty.

Really good! Made it exactly as written. Only cooked it on the stove instead of in the microwave, also doubled the recipe. Suggestions from my family was to cut the celery in half and add some cajun seasoning while cooking the vegis, we like it spicy!
Also I have a son who cant eat shrimp so I took a boneless chicken breast seasoned it with a little cajun seasoning, browned it in a pan with some butter and garlic put some of the sauce in the pan and simmered it until it was fully cooked. he loved it!!Just a suggestion for anyone that may have someone in their family with a shellfish allergy. Just make the sauce, put a little aside before adding the shrimp this way the whole family can enjoy this recipe.

I had never so much as heard of an Etoufee, much less tasted it, but we just thought it was average and lacking in flavor.  I did like the mixture of vegetables used and was surprised it could be microwaved. At any rate, we don't think it is good enough to cook again...if I did I would go for more of a tomato sauce with just a little lemon for a cleaner, brighter flavor and skip the cream soup.

LOVE IT!  I made this dish my significant other, his 15-year-old son, and me.  I don't eat large servings and those two are what I'd consider normal eaters for men and, between the three of us, there was not a bit left!  It wasn't that it didn't make six servings -- it's that it was so good!  Still, I'd suggest making two servings for every person you mean to serve because it'll go fast!  Like others here, I made it on the stovetop.  I just don't like microwave cooking.  I served it with a fragrant Jasmine rice which really added to the sensory experience of this delicious dish.  The one-and-only reason I gave it four stars (instead of five) is that I could detect the very slight flavor of the chicken soup at times.  Still...it's not enough to keep me from putting this in our regular rotation.

This is a great base recipe. I'm giving it 4 stars b/c it needs a little more. I cooked the onion, bell pepper, & celery for a lot longer than the recipe calls For bc I don't like super crunchy veggies in it. I also added Cajun seasoning to the butter/veggie mix while it cooked on the stove (not a fan of cookin in microwave). I also added more garlic bc we love garlic and I added Tabasco for more spice. Thanks for the recipe, it got me started!

I cooked this on the stovetop and added a dash of this and that based on other reviews, but the basic recipe is great!  Really easy to make and delicious.  You'd never know canned soup is in there!

I loved this recipe! It was super fast and easy. I got the pre-chopped items from Wegmans. All I had to do was measure out the ingredients and in a flash I was done. I thoroughly recommend giving this recipe a try!

Really good and quick and easy to make.  I only made a couple of substitutions.  I used a combo of red and yellow pepper as we don't like green.  I also used cajun seasoning instead of hot pepper sauce.  I plan to freeze mine in a large muffin pan, then pop out the frozen etouffee "muffins" for quick fast meals.

As many others....I cooked it on the stove top and not in the microwave...I also added some creole seasoning for more flavor and a bit of heat. Also thinned it out a bit. Everyone loved it!!!! Tasted great!!!

Yum! This is a keeper! I only gave it 4 stars because I changed it slightly.  It definatley needed  4 or 5 shakes of Worstershire Sauce and to be thinned out a little with Chicken Broth.  Other than that I thought the heat was great.  I actually added Tabasco for my husband because he likes it super hot.  I also made it stovetop in a sauce pan since I don't really like cooking things in a microwave and it worked out great.  I also used cooked shrimp and put them in the sauce to warm them up at the end.   My only complaint is that there wasn't enough.  I will try to double this recipe next time.

Very good, but needed to add bay leaf. Next time I will cook all ingredients except shrimp for an hour to allow the flavors to blend (I cooked it over the stove and not in the microwave.

This was so easy to make and soooooo yummy!!! I made it on the stove top because my shrimp was already cooked, and it was still super easy. Just added the shrimp last, heat to almost boiling and poured it over the rice. Only made minor changes: used real butter, used both red & green pepper and used a little cajun seasoning instead of cayenne pepper. Mmmm!

I just couldn't bring myself to "nuke" seafood. So this was prepared on the stovetop. It was very good, even though I didn't use the cayenne pepper and pepper sauce. I did use Cajun seasoning for a little kick. My husband loved it, even though he is not a fan of Cajun food because he's a wimp when it comes to spicy hot food. He even took the leftovers in his lunch. I did not use shrimp because it just didn't look fresh at the grocery store, but used a lb of fresh scallops. I gotta say, it was fabulous with scallops. I also used the whole small can of tomato paste, just because I didn't want to throw it away. I poured about 1/2 cup of red wine into the sauce and let it simmer prior to adding the scallops at the end. There was alot of sauce, so I froze the extra sauce and will add shrimp to it for another quick dinner. I will definitely be fixing this again.

A winner!! Like many others, I was skittish at microwaving shrimp so I cooked this on the stove and saved the nuking for my rice. I thinned it out with some leftover Pino Grigio from my fridge. Delicious!!

This was very good. I am scared of cooking in the microwave so cooked on the stove. Made sauce, sauteed shrimp and then combined the 2. I followed other reviews and added some Cajun seasoning to the sace and the shrimp before I cooked them, added some white wine and worcestershire sauce so the sauce at the end with the soup and tomato paste. Served it over jasmine rice.

We found this to be very addictive, and certainly spicy. Nonetheless, it was great. A bit time-consuming but well worth it. Served over Spanish rice and it was gone off the in laws' plates in a matter of seconds.

My husband and I really liked this.. I used diced tomatoes instead of the tomato paste and it was not as thick as the paste would have made it.. I also used cajun seasonings instead of the hot sauce. I would definitly recommend the stove top way over microwave. I will save this and make it again.

This was wonderful and easy!  Even the kids love it.  Only time-consuming part is chopping the veggies.  Next time I would kick up the spices a bit.  Definitely like it a bit hotter than the recipe calls for.

GLAD I READ THE REVIEWS ON THIS ONE.  THE SAUCE WAS WAAAAYYYYY TOO THICK AS NOTED BY OTHER REVIEWERS.  I ADDED AT LEAST A CUP OF WHITE WINE AND IT WAS STILL REALLY THICK.  I ALSO KICKED IT UP PRETTY HOT AND IT WAS DELISH.

I MIXED SHRIMP AND HALVED SEA SCALLOPS.  

THE REVIEWERS WHO COMMENTED ON THE SERVING SIZE BEING OFF WERE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT.  I FOLLOWED THE RECIPE USING A POUND OF FISH AND IT WAS JUST PERFECT FOR ME AND HUBBY.  OK, WE STUFFED A LITTLE BIT BUT IT WAS SO GOOD AND I ONLY SERVED PEAS AND NOT THAT MUCH RICE.

I ALSO ONLY USED 2 T OF BUTTER TO CUT THE CALS.  NEXT TIME I'LL TRY THE LOW FAT SOUP.  THERE WAS ENOUGH FLAVOR THAT I DON'T THINK IT WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE.  CHICKEN BROTH NEXT TIME ALSO INSTEAD OF WINE.

I DON'T KNOW WHY THE RECIPES ON THIS SITE ALWAYS NEED SO MUCH TWEEKING.  ANY ONES THAT I HAVE AS KEEPERS HAVE TAKEN QUITE A BIT OF CHANGES.

I made this on the stovetop and we thought it was just "OK".  I added more hot sauce, cayenne pepper, and some creole seasoning.  I thought it was too bland, but with a little work on the spices, we would probably have it again.

This was really good. I did it on the stovetop.  I chopped some canned tomatoes because I didn't have tomato paste.  I added a bay leaf, 1/4-1/2 tsp creole seasoning and 1/2 tsp of worsteshire sauce. I also added 3-4 Tbsp of milk to thin the sauce at the end. (I did not add the cayenne or hot sauce) My husband LOVED it.  I will make 2 batches next time!

I accidentally bought Cream of Celery Soup instead. It still turned out just fantastic!! I cooked it on the stove top, I just couldn't bring myself to microwave it. I made it for my in-laws and they said that I could make it for them anytime!

Very tasty and quick for a weeknight meal.  Loved that only my cutting board and skillet were dirty at the end!  Made it on the stovetop and cooked for slightly longer times--added shrimp last and cooked until just pink.  Next time I will double the veggies to make it more of a one-dish meal.  Added about a half cup of white wine at the end to thin it out a bit and served with basmati rice, which we love the taste of.  Used Healthy Request cream of chix soup which worked fine, and also added about a tsp of red pepper flakes to fire it up a little.  Will use Cajun seasoning next time.  It didn't knock our socks off but we definitely liked it and it will be used on our rotation of once-a-week seafood dishes.  Thanks!

I added 1/4 cup of white wine (could use even more) to thin the sauce a little, and used Cajun Chicken seasoning instead of hot sauce.  We liked it a lot. Quick and easy too.

I was very timid about microwaving shrimp, but I trusted other reviews and forged ahead.
This was extremely simple and very delicious.  I am amazed microwave shrimp could taste this good and this authentic.  This is a must try for a quick weekday dinner!

Terrific!  This was such an unusual recipe that I had my doubts, but we loved it.  I did use "light" butter and fat-free cream of chicken soup.  My only objection is the color.  Since you don't make a roux, it came out a little orange.  Wish I could figure out some way to make it more authentically brown while still using this very fast version.  Thanks for the recipe.

(Additional note:  Other than the lower fat substitutions, I made the recipe as given.  I didn't get six servings.  It made four 3/4-cup servings, which seemed to be about the right size for an entree when served over a half cup of rice.  This may or may not serve four--depends on whether they will want more than one serving--which was a temptation with this great dish.  I always think it is funny when quantity is given as Serves So Many as opposed to So Many Servings.  Am I serving Calista Flockhart or the Terminator?)

Upon the suggestions of other reviewers, I used the cream base soup (can't abide by canned), made it on the stovetop, and added more cayenne and tabasco. WOW! I grew up in Louisiana, so I know the

This recipe rocks!  Everyone loved it, but it will only feed 6 people if they are all on a diet.  I doubled the recipe and fed it to 4 average sized people.  In the end there was only enough left over for 1 serving, and I didn't go back for seconds.

WOW!  My husband and I loved this easy and tasty recipe.  No need to use the microwave though.  It's so quick on the stove top. I cooked all the chopped ingredients until tender. Then added the shrimp, tom paste, soup,etc. and cooked for about 10 minutes.  Perfect.  I did add a few dashes of worcestershire sauce, bay leaf, and about 2 tbsp of water for the last 10 min.  Thanks!

I followed this recipe exactly and thought it was pretty good.  I think I would like it if it had more tomatoes so I'm thinking next time I'll use tomato sauce and a bit more than it calls for in place of the tomato paste.  I also thought it could have been a bit more spicey but having a small child I can't spice it up too much till afterwards.  I did like it and was very impressed that it came out so well in the microwave.

This is great!! I have made this several times since last year.   The most authentic tasting unauthentic New Orleans Creole recipe I've run across. Very easy and simple.  I adjust the garlic and cayenne pepper dependent on who is having dinner with us.

I loved this recipe but my husband claimed it tasted "cheesy" which was problem the taste of the underlying cream of chicken soup.  I used frozen cooked shrimp, thawed them quickly in cool water and then added them to the recipe right at the end.

I tried this recipe, with substitutions and we loved it. Here is what I did different; I made a blond roux and added it to the broth mixture; instead of adding canned soup, I added 4 Tablespoons of creme fresche.  I also added peeled crawfish tails that I purchased from the seafood dept, in addition to large Gullf shrimp. . I substituted no salt tomato sauce for tomato paste and added crawfish boil seasonings instead of pepper sauce or pepper. The final touch was, adding sautéed sweet yellow onions and garlic right at the end. Served with rice. Yummy.

Tasted okay, but seemed like something was missing...I just figure out what it was. I added a little jalapeno juice, which helped some but didn't quite do it either. May make again, but just okay to us. My husband is from Louisiana so we've had Crawfish Etouffee, which was great! So maybe hard to compare...not sure.

I decided to try this recipe for my twin daughters' 20th birthday dinner.  I had never cooked etoufee before but after reading the reviews I thought I would give it a try.  This was VERY easy and tasted amazing!  All of their friends raved about it.  The only change I made was to use crawfish instead of shrimp.  Thanks for such a great recipe.

My whole family loved this meal.  We did add cajun seasoning and some hot sauce as well as cooking it on the stovetop instead of the microwave and it was AMAZING!  My oldest daughter, who is very finicky and didn't like shrimp, also loved this dish.  We now make it every Thursday.

I LOVED YOUR RECIPE!!! But I slighty adjusted to my taste, I dont eat meat so instead of the can of condensed cream of chicken soup I added a can of cream of mushroom soup. Instead of adding hot sauce I added a jalapeno, and added a bit of dry white wine. THANK YOU!!! it was great!!!

This recipe is great! Thank you for sharing. I made it last night for my family and everyone loved it! Great tasting & easy to make. However I did add much more hot pepper sauce. I also added some Cajun spices, canned diced tomato, and two teaspoons of A1 Steak sauce (I didn't have Worcester sauce).   My family and I love spicy foods so if you do too I would recommend the above additions as well! :)

I followed the recipe exactly as shown and it was DE-LISH! ok, maybe I added a dash or 2 more of hot sauce :) I used the small salad size shrimp and served it over blackened tuna steaks & brown rice with sauteed green beans for our veg. Washed it all down with an ice cold rasberry wheat beer - Abita Purple Haze. Easy prep, easier cleanup, this one is definitely a keeper!

This was an easy and very good recipe. I left out the hot sauce and cayenne pepper and it was still delicious!  The only thing I added was water tothe chicken soup.  The consistency was still a thick gravy.

I loved this, however I did make a few changes to the original recipe.  I made this stovetop like others suggested and only added the shrimp (mine was cooked earlier) the last few minutes to warm through.  I only had cream of celery soup so that it was I used.  I also added about a cup of white wine and a sprinkling of cajun spices for extra kick.  I served on rice with a side of asparagus.  A light tasty meal.

Wonderful!  However, I used the stove top method no microwave for me.   In all it may have taken an additional 15 minutes, but well worth it. Quick and easy. Even the kids liked this recipe.

I admit I was very unsure about cooking the whole meal in the microwave but decided to follow the true recipe.  It turned out fantastic!  The shrimp were not "rubbery" at all.  It was delicious and very enjoyable - especially since it all cooks in one dish.  When I served the rice, we did add a few drops of worchestershire sauce to it for more flavor but no other changes.  Can't wait to make it again!

Great recipe.  I doubled the cayenne and eyed the measurement for the hot sauce (used Tapatio).  Did everything on the stove top (not a big fan of using my microwave for from-scratch cooking) as well.  I had just a bit of water from my prep that went it, so others would probably need 1/4 cup of water to balance out the thickness of the broth.

This recipe was amazing. I did it on the stove instead, and I substituted the green peppers for broccoli and it was amazing! It was like a party of ingredients in my mouth, I am very happy with this and am going to serve it to my parents for their anniversary tonight.

Delicious!  Like others, I added 2 bay leaves, 1 1/2 tsp Worchester & about 1 tsp of cajun seasoning.  I also thinned the sauce a bit with about 1/2 c. chardonnay & chicken broth.  I didn't have shrimp so I tossed in a seafood medley.  The pan was licked clean :)  I would say 6 servings is a stretch, though.  It barely fed 4 in my home (2 teenage boys & an athleet husband)  We WILL make it again.

I personally really liked this recipe but the husband and kids gave it just a passing grade.  If it wasn't for that, I would have given it 5 stars.

Wow.  I never would have believed a microwave recipie could be so good.  But since so many others said it was good, I tried it.  However, I also used  pre-cooked frozen shrimp.  So I defrosted it in a bowl of cold water first, and only added it the last 2 minutes of cooking time.  Another reviewer noted that a "c" shape is cooked, and "o" is overcooked...2 minutes in the micro allowed them to keep their "c" shape.  As for the sauce, I also added about 1 T of Worshcteshire sauce and took the hot sauce and salt to the table.  My husband preferd to add some hot sauce and salt...I was fine w/ just adding a touch of salt. Served over Jasmine rice. Delicious.

This was an awesome dish!  I used cooked shrimp and added it right at the end until heated through.  I also added about 1/2 cup heavy cream right before the shrimp to thin it out and make it creamier.  Yummy!!  Sooooo many compliments!

This was great!  I read all the reviews and made some of the same modifications: stove instead of microwave, W.shire sauce, chicken broth, a lot more cayenne pepper and hot sauce.  This was really good and leftovers were even better.  Will definetly make again.  Thanks!

Very good and easy to prepare.  I thought it was a bit too tomatoey (sp).  Still good though.  I will tweak it a little to make it my own flavor but still this recipe is a good starting place.

Wow! This was fantastic and soooo easy. I had to improvise a little.  I used golden mushroom soup, and I didn't have any carrots so I used some mixed frozen veggies from my freezer.  I also added some creole seasoning, garlic salt and some red pepper flakes.  It was really good!

I made this for my very picky family last night. I bought precooked frozen shrimp that i thawed,cut up, and threw in after everything else was done in the microwave.
I left out the green onion and parsley. My father raved so much about it that he wants me to make it again tonight! Easiest and best recipe i've found on this site so far. A+++

Quick and filling meal! I keep the cayenne out for my kids, add in extra chopped veggies for bulk, and serve over steamed rice with fresh lemon juice squeezed over top (and I sprinkle cayenne on top for the adults). The kids love it, so do my husband and I. Plus, I appreciate that it's all microwaveable!

This was so yummy and delicious!  My husband wants me to make it again tonight, but with chicken.  I used the stovetop to make it, first cooking the vegetables, garlic, meat, and then adding the sauce ingredients. Will definitely be making again soon.

Great recipe.  I did use some more shrimp & used the stovetop method.  Had to add some chicken broth & milk as well.  I added a can a drained mushrooms, worchestershire sauce, and some bay leaf.  I think that it would be good to add some water chestnuts & bacon pieces next time.  Definitely has a kick!  Will definitely make again.  The hardest part is cutting up the vegetables.

I have made this recipe many times but have never reviewed it.  This is a regular dish in my household.  I know many think cooking this meal in the microwave is strange, but it works great.  I like the creamy consistency of the dish.

I cooked this recipe stovetop and was impressed with how quick and easy it still was.  I used 1 lb shrimp and a little over 1/2lb scallops, added white cooking wine with the tomato paste and soup and it turned out great. I had a harder time with the rice!

This was ok, I found it a little bland, and I think I was expecting more of a gravy then a red sauce. I left out all the spicy stuff because even though I love it my fiance can't take it and he really loved this recipe, and ate the leftovers for lunch the next day.  Maybe I will try again and add the spicyness to mine.  Thanks

I made this for a Mardi Gras dinner last Monday night and wanted to make some "authentic" New Orleans food for some friends. After reading the reviews, I also made it on the stovetop. It was SO easy and ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! I used 100 grams (about 3 ounces) of crawfish (peeled and cleaned) in addition to shrimp to mix it up a bit. This was really amazing. They all wanted more! I handed out the recipe to my friends. Thanks Kay!

Amazing!!!  Made it on the stovetop and added cubed chicken breast for some extra meat.  My family loved it and thinks it's better than the bowl you can get at the restaurant.  I think so too!

Yum!  I didn't have tomato paste and substituted tomato sauce.  I also didn't have cayenne pepper or hot sauce, so substituted about half a tbsp. of crushed red peppers that I had on the shelf.  I thought it was great.

I was suprised this tasted as good as it did. I don't usually like food cooked in the microwave. I used butter in place of margarine. I will make this again.

Excellent dish! I have prepared it twice since I discovered the recipe 4 days ago. Absolutely fabulous; a must try for any cajun or shrimp dish lover. However, I too used the stovetop method--the microwave scared me off a bit.

omitted salt, hot sauce, and parsley. Subbed Tony's for cayenne. Did it on the stovetop instead of microwave, and added thawed pre-cooked shrimp in during final couple minutes of stirring. Whole recipe probably needs 1.5-2 cups of rice, depending on the proportion you like.

Everyone at my table enjoyed this dish.  Made it a second time and left out the tomato paste and the hot sauce.  Good either way.  Served over noodles.  Thank you for easy and tasty.

This was the best dish I have ever made, EVER.   Husband had 3 helpings. I woke up this morning just reliving making this remarkable dish.  Read the reviews and used salsa instead of tomato paste because I had none.  Used the Cajun spices from this site and boiled the shrimp in beer, also from this site.  Put shrimp in pan just enough to rewarm it at the end.  Cooked on stove because I need to see and taste food cooking.

I had to adjust this recipe because it didn't have nearly enough flavor, but I'll give it 4 Stars, because it wasn't bad, and provided a good start.

I did not use a microwave. 

I mixed the soup, parsley and other seasonings together and let the shrimp sit in that for a couple of days. When it was time to cook, I sautéed the fresh ingredients in a cast iron skillet and then added the soup mixture to simmer. I thinned the sauce out just a little bit and served it over fettuccini pasta.

We all love this etoufee.  Ok the can of soup that is usually a give away for an amature recipe was easliy replaced with a little heavy cream or half and half.  I was out of celery  so I used zucchini squash.  I cooked on the stove top, mostly I dislike anything sophistacted  that is cooked in a microwave.  This recipe has good bones, tweak it a bit.

We really enjoy this! I use about 1.5 TBS of butter and make in a skillet pan on stove. I also use Healthy Request soup and add some Worcestershire sauce and creole seasoning per other reviewers. Very tasty!

Not too spicy for the kids yet still yummy for adults. Surprisingly easy. I knew this was a hit when I overheard my husband sharing it with his mom over the phone, he was the cook on this one. The house did not stink of shrimp though I worried with using the micro that it would.

I thought this tasted awesome. I admit that I've never had etoufee before and therefore I have no point of reference. That being said, as far as the taste, simplicity, and convenience of utilizing ingredients that are staples in our pantry/refrigerator, this recipe gets a ten! I doubled the recipe and realized too late that I only had one can of the soup but it still tasted great. Will definitely make this again. Thank you very much for the recipe!

I thought this recipe was great. I did however double it because it doesnt make that much. I also did one can of cream of shrimp and one chicken. I then put in a couple of bay leaves and some Tony chacheres. It came out better than I expected and my friends and family loved it!!

I made this recipe for a party booth competition at a BBQ cookoff.  Of course Mardi Gras was the theme, one judge was from Louisiana, he said this was just like they make at home.  He wanted the recipe.  Everyone loves it.

Excellent.  I made in a skillet.  I used cooked frozen shrimp.  I thawed the shrimp using warm water, patted it dry and added to the skillet.  I cooked about five minutes until the shrimp was heated through.  The next time I'll remove the tails before putting the shrimp into the skillet.

Being in Florida I just couldn't bring myself to "nuke" my shrimp so, I compromised. I put my veggies and butter in the microwave and then transferred everything to the stove top. I did not have cream of chicken soup so I subbed golden cream of mushroom. I also used the "toothpaste" type of tomato paste. I thought it was pretty good but next time I will incorporate some other suggestions. I will definitely add the Cajun seasoning and maybe a little more hot sauce. I will make this again and soon.

This is very good. I do  not use green onions, just more regular onion. I like it hot, and it's just right for us. I've  made it in the microwave and on the stove top. Both ways are good, but the stove top will caramelize the veggies, which is a nice touch. I do add some water as it gets pretty thick. This is one of my go to recipes for a quick, spicy, good shrimp dish.

My husband was intent on doing the same old frozen stir fry w/shrimp. My family does not like trying new things, but I do and I talked him into it. I did put the ingredients in a pan instead of the microwave, in fear of the frozen/thawed shrimp becoming rubbery. Followed the recipe except for kicking it up a few notches by doubling the ceyenne and chili. Then adding cajun spices to taste, and some milk to thin the sauce out a little. Definetly will cook this again, and my husband loved it, which is the worlds pickiest eater.

I omitted the cayenne and hot sauce for my family, but used all the other ingredients, I did it on the stove top and added five chicken legs in addition to the shrimp called for. The problem with doing on the stove top was that the sauce is thick so it began to stick to the pot. I added some water to compensate but still had a mean soaking to do to clean the pan. I though this was really good but over rice, it lost a lot of its flavor. Don't know how to remedy that except eat it w/out rice. Maybe next time we'll use brown rice which doesn't absorb stuff as much.

I added red peppers instead of green and oregano instead of parsely as I didn't have any. Served it on top of white rice. It was pretty good but I'll try it exactly as is next time

I liked this reciepe alot, hubby even gave it a "9 out of 10", but in my opinion, it needed quite a bit of doctoring up, hence my 4 star. I made it as written (except stovetop), but was bland, so thats when I started making some of the changes other reviewers had suggested. I did at LEAST double (if not more than double) on my cayenne and hot pepper sauce, added some Old Bay Seasoning and a few shakes of Worchestershire sauce. Also added 1/2 cup white wine at the end to reach a nice consistancy. Served over brown rice. Would make again, but with the revisions. Thanks!

This turned out great! I did add Cajun seasoning and a little Old Bay. And I used dried parsley instead of fresh because that is what I had. The sauce was delicious. It was just a tiny bit too thick for me so I just added a little water until I got the desired consistency. Yum!

This was an excellent dish that was almost too easy to make. Everyone who tryed it loved it. I did make a couple changes by using cream of shrimp soup and added scallops since I didn't have enough shrimp.

We loved this!  I used both shrimp and chicken, and cooked it on the stove top as many others have suggested.  I also added some hot sauce, Old Bay, and Worcestershire as suggested.  We will definitely do this again!

THIS WAS MONEY! for all the Guy Fieri fans:)! I too used the stovetop, and not the microwave. 2nd time I made it, I used chicken and it was still a hit! Served it over noodles both times, but hubby liked the leftovers over rice too! I also took the advice of the reviews and added chicken stock (to thin it out),a few dashes of Worcestershire and cajun seasoning. Next time, it'll be shrimp and chicken!

Not really up on my shrimp etouffee but this was very flavorful and yummy! Even the kids enjoyed it. Will definitely make again. I did have to add 1/4 cup milk to thin it down some.

I did not really care for this. I made this on the stove-top, and the sauce was VERY thick. I had to add almost a cup of water to thin it out. I also doubled the hot sauce and added a few splashes of Worcestershire sauce. I think my subtle changes improved it a lot, but it was still very bland. Won't be making this again...

I can't believe how good this was.  I had planned on making the recipe on the stovetop but I was late getting home tonight so my husband made dinner and he followed the microwave directions.  Only change we made is I used cream of celery soup rather than the cream of chicken.  We will have this again and again.

This is a great dish.  I did make a few changes.  I used 1 lb of Bay Scallops instead of the Shrimp.  I sauted the Scallops with the green onions, celery and garlic in olive oil instead of the butter and I omited the 1/2 cup of onions.  I also used a can of cream of mushroom soup instead of the cream of chicken soup.  I used a 1/2 teaspoon of cajun spice to kick it up a bit.  My honey thought this was a great dish and said "We have to have this again".  Thank you for a great recipe.  We will definately have this again.

we loved this. i did make a few changes. i cooked this on the stove top. i used red pepper instead of green, used less margarine and used olive oil to saute the veggies. i didn't have any green onion so i used leeks.  also was making it for lent so i used cream of mushroom.  I added a bay leaf, more garlic and used a really great hot sauce.  Came out great!! will make this one again.

It was a hit in my household! I'm a 101 level cook (who commutes from nyc to new jersey every day) so my time is limited. It was quick, and easy. I loved it b/c it's not the usual quick meal. Oh, and I subbed cream of shrimp for the cream of chicken. Thumbs up from me :)

delicious, easy & quick! Im not a big seafood eater,and this was delicious to me! I loved the flavor of the sauce with the shrimp. I added a bit more cayenne and used red rooster sauce, cause i like it hot! a little extra garlic, season salt (instead of reg) and I subbed in chicken broth with flour, cause i didn't have the condensed soup. cooked in a skillet and served over white rice with a blend of black,kidney & pinto beans. Husband loved it!Im sure the original recipe w/ the condensed soup is excellent!! and will definately make again! Thanks!

What's great about this recipe is I can do all the chopping a couple of days ahead and have an interesting weeknight meal on the table in 25 minutes after I get home. Frozen raw peeled deveined shrimp, thawed, Jasmine rice in the cooker, start the microwave sequence, and it all comes together with the veggies still slightly crunchy...yum. My only hacks were some lemon juice and sirachi sauce for kick. This one rocks!

I'm not a shrimp fan, but the family loved this.  The only thing I changed was to add a little extra cayenne pepper.

This was pretty good. Lacked a little bit of flavor, and the texture was a bit strange. I think it needed something to thin that soup out, perhaps a little chicken broth or white wine. I'm sure this is not an authentic recipe, but it was quick to prepare. I used the whole 6 oz. of tomato paste, because I didn't want to deal with having the leftovers in my refrigerator. I had looked for the tomato paste in a tube, which makes it really easy to use by the tablespoon, but my store didn't have any. I also used prawns rather than shrimp. My husband really liked the dish more than I did. He's getting leftovers for lunch today. I served it over brown rice which we prefer to white.

Excellent easy and quick, but I found it alittle bland so after It was finished I added fresh diced tomatoes and sprinkled some lemon juice.

i followed the recipe exactly and it came out fantastic! only thing i changed was i dont like to cook in the microwave so i made it on the stove sauteeing the first four ingredients in the melted butter and then added the rest and continued to cook for about five minutes. great recipe, just enough hot for us and we are a family of portuguese that love hot food! next time we will be adding chourico to it for variety! awesome, thanks so much for a great recipe.

I made this exactly and found it to be a little spice (hot) but very tasty, next time I may omit tobasco sauce or cayanne. All and all this was very good.

I thought this was very good.  I changed it a bit because I didn't have any celery, so I added celery salt and deleted any additional salt.  I added about a quarter of a soup can of water to thin it out alittle.  The shrimp I had on hand were cooked, so I added them in at the last minute.

Excellent.  On the advice of others, I added vegetable juice, but I also added a smidge of beer and lots of old bay seasoning.  This recipe is a keeper!

Recipe worked out great!  The entire family, including Hubby whose from New Orleans, loved it!  Next time I'll add a bit more spice to me and hubby's portion.  Made enough for 12 so we'd have left overs, but since it was so wonderful, there was none left.  I opted not to use the microwave, so did everything on the stove.

A simple variation with close to the same result:
Saute green pepper, onion and celery (all diced) in a stick of butter.  Add 2 cans of cream of celery soup.  Add 1/2 bottle of Bloody Mary Mix until preferred consistency.  Add shrimp last until cooked thoroughly-serve over rice with french bread!!!!

The recipe was terrific, but we altered the cooking instructions a bit.  Instead of using the microwave we used a wok, and it turned out really great.

This recipe was excellent!  I tried it with crawfish instead of the shrimp and it was great!  I also cooked this on top of the stove.  I did not have any parsley, but I added a little cooking white wine like other people said.  I also did not have any celery, but used some celery seed.
This one is a keeper.  Will try with the shrimp the next time.

my husband had his doubts on this recipe but tried it because I wanted a taste of "home" and it turned out that we all loved it! My 3 year old and 18 month old both loved it and kept wanting to eat!! Also I did this on the stovetop...I don't ever use my microwave (except to heat up water). It was wonderful. In fact I am making it again tonight....oh, FYI, I didn't have celery, so I used a small amount of celery seed and it was perfect! Thanks again!!

I changed this up just a bit.  Instead of cooking it in the microwave I cooked it on the stove.  I also added a bay leaf and a few dashes of Worcestershire.  The whole family loved it.

Used condensed chicken Boullion. Cooked the sauce for 2 minutes before I put in the shrimp.  Cooked the shrimp for 3 minutes and let stand for a minute.  Perfect

Wonderful.  I made it using the microwave and just kept cooking and stirring until the shrimp were done.  I did add a little more hot sauce.  Excellent dish.  Thanks.

After reading the reviews, I made this on stove-top... had some reservations about microwaving shrimp.  This recipe is easy & quick, but it doesn't taste all that great.  It's TOO thick & rich.

Easy, good flavor.  I add more hot sauce and cayenne, and cook it on the stovetop.  Am I blind, or is that a photo of a pork chop?

This recipe is AMAZING. So delicious and so easy to prepare. I think the proportions are more likely to serve 4. It would be perfect for guests. Just act like it was more difficult than it was to prepare and be prepared for lots of compliments.
