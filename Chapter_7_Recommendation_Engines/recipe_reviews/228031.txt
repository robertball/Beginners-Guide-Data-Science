Tasting this right out of the ice cream machine, it tastes like a light lime sherbet.  I think some coconut extract might help with the coconut taste.  I halved the recipe to fit in my small ice cream maker and I only had one can of coconut milk.  I can see making this again and again.  Thanks!

It's tangy and nice but very light-bodied. Half-way between an ice cream and a sorbet.  A little too light for my taste, but excellent if that's what you're looking for.
