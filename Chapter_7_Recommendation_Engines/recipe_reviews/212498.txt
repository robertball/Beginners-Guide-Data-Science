This recipes was great!  My home smelled liked an Italian restaurant.  I did, however, make a couple of changes.  Instead of Italian Dressing, I used Good Seasons Italian Fat Free Salad Dressing Mix â€“ 1.05oz, added 1/2 teaspoon of dried Parsley and 1/2 teaspoon of Garlic.  I heated two tablespoons of Olive oil and sprinkled all of the seasonings on the chicken coating each side well.  Once the chicken started to brown, I added the remaining ingredients.  To compliment the dish, I served an Italian salad and homemade cheddar biscuits.  Yum Yum!!

Easy and fast is always first on my list after working a long day.  Great tasting but would add some garlic and onion when sauteing the chicken for some added flavor.

This recipe is really good. instead of going out and buying the alfredo sauce just make it yourself.  I did add extra cream cheese like other reviewers suggested.

Basically a good recipe. I substituted peas for the broccoli. When all was mixed together, I put the mix in individual ceramic serving dishes, topped with more parmesan and baked for about 25 min at 325. Made a nice crispy, cheesy top...yum yum

I followed the recipe exactly and we just didn't like it.  The texture was too heavy, as cream cheese sauces tend to be.  The sauce was very tangy, and not in a good way.

My fiance and I really like this. I did add garlic and used frozen broccoli instead of fresh. Added a slurry (about 2 tsp cornstarch and 1/4 cup milk) to the chicken sauce to thicken it up. One surprising thing...chicken pieces still were a little on the bland side even though it was cooked in that salty italian dressing. My fiance made the suggestion of marinating the chicken in your choice of marinade before cooking. I think italian sausage will work well with this recipe too.

I was looking for a quick, easy & delicious meal to make with the chicken I had thawed out last night & came up on this. I had all the ingredients on hand except for broccoli, which was okay since I subbed green peas. I followed the directions & it turned out awesome. So tasty & easy too. My 14 year old grandson asked me what made me such a good cook! I was thrilled!! I will be making this again & again. Thanks for sharing...

Easy, delicious and quick!  I made it with low-fat cream cheese, milk & Parmesan.  Didn't make a difference.  Be sure to serve it HOT!

Pretty easy and tasty.  I added double the cream cheese because the sauce seemed a little too thin.  My 3 year old daughter really loved it, so I would make it again!

Super easy and very good. I would recommend adding 1/2 cup of the parmesan and a little garlic seasoning just to add a little more flavor. Will def. be making this again!

This is great! The alfredo is so creamy with the cream cheese. I also added garlic salt, but I add it to everything. Great fast meal.

I've made cream sauce from butter and flour and it was always just ok.  But this was AMAZING!  I have never left a review before but I just had to.  This was so easy and was delicious! I made this for my mother in law's birthday, and my picky father in law loved it too!

It was very good.  I'm glad I read the reviews about adding some garlic and more cream cheese.  It would have been bland to me otherwise. In my opinion this is restaurant quality in a short time.

Awesome dinner tonight - loved by all.  I was worried that my kids would not like all of the green, but they actually went back for seconds.  I did not use the dressing, but did add in some zucchini with the broccoli because I had some to use up.  This came together quickly and we will definitely make again.

This is so good! I took other's advice and changed it a little.  Here is what I did:
Coated the chicken breasts with the italian dressing mix, cooked it on the stove top.  I used butter in the pan while i browned it. Once cooked, removed them and added garlic and the rest of the ingredients to make the sauce, while the fettuccine cooked in another pot. Cut the chicken into pieces.  Added the cooked fettuccine and chicken to the sauce..tossed and served.  I also just eye-balled the sauce thickness and added more parm cheese to thicken a little.  Delish!

So good! Added garlic, and used less milk and a little bit of pasta water to lighten the sauce. The combination of dressing and cream cheese is perfect!

This is really great.  We were worried the sauce was too thin, but if you let it sit in the pasta, it really does thicken up.  We actually used low fat cream cheese, skim milk, and low fat Parmesan cheese and it was still delicious.  It just needs some salt.

Dish was easy to prepare, but lacked flavor.    The sauce was also very runny - I had to boil off some of the excess, as well as add more cream cheese.    Not sure we will make again - but if we do, I will lower the amount of milk, and add more flavor while cooking.

I did 1 cup of milk, 2/3 heavy cream. I also did Italian dressing packet with olive oil instead of wet Italian dressing. Also added a little Cajun seasoning. Saving for future!

Loved it and easy to make. I didn't have cream cheese but I had Boursin cheese so I used that. I also added parsley and a little Italian seasoning and onions. I added spinach as I add it to everything and the family doesn't mind it. Will make it again!!

WOW! Easy, quick and tasty. What more could you ask for? Definitely tweak the creamy sauce part. (less milk/more parm) but trust me, it comes out just fine. Enjoy!

We liked it. I usually use a jar of alfredo sauce but I think it has an after taste. I only had Weight Watchers (whipped) cream cheese and a lite Italian dressing on hand so I used that. I'll make this again.

This is a great recipe for chicken Alfredo.  I made it for my family last night and they loved it.  I did however make just a few changes.  I put spinach instead of the broccoli, only because one of my sons hates broccoli, and used fat free milk, and fat free cream cheese.  Will defiantly make this again :-)

Love this recipe. The alfredo ingredients are perfect. Used other people's suggestions and added 1.5 packets of italian dressing mix, plus .5 tsp basil and parsley. Didn't have time or thawed chicken, so also took the easy route with 2 cans white chicken breast. It came out delicious, and my 5 and 8 year olds approved as well...which means it's definitely a keeper.

Delicious!!!!!! I used 6oz of cream cheese instead of 4oz. I let the Alfredo sit for a good five minutes while the pasta was cooking so it would become thick! I recommend this recipe to anyone. Very yummy!!!

This dish was super easy, tasty and my entire family enjoyed it. I increased the cream cheese to a full 8oz, added some garlic as others suggested and it was very flavorful. Great dish!

I was looking for a different recipe for chicken and broccoli and found this. I didn't have italian dressing so after reading the other reviews I used vegtable oil and seasoned the chicken with salt & pepper, onion & garlic powder.  I used about 6 oz of 1/3 fat cream cheese too and it was delicious!  Even my husband and son loved it!

So hard to rate a recipe when you change it.. but I loved the way mine just turned out. Instead of chicken I used shrimp. I didn't have regular cream cheese so I used the onion and chive cream cheese I had.. I also sauteed the shrimp in the italian dressing with onions, minced garlic and mushrooms... then added the cream cheese and half the milk the recipe asks for, the grated parm and a little basil and also a touch of crushed red pepper. I love it! Great recipe.. sorry I messed with it so much, I have a habit of doing that lol

My family only rated this "okay".  I would give it 3 1/2 stars because it was so quick and easy, which is a plus, especially after I'd been mowing the lawn.   I followed suggestions by other viewers and added more cream cheese - my family said it was too much, even though I used 1% milk and half the cream cheese was non-fat, the other half was low-fat.  I used shredded Italian cheese mix...then grated some fresh parmesan on top.  I also added sliced red bell peppers and some garlic powder, and lots of pepper.  I liked that the chicken was very tender, but I'm not sure we all liked the flavor of the Zesty Italian dressing. We prefer  more traditional-tasting Alfredo sauce, so next time I would just saute the chicken in olive oil, fresh garlic and seasonings,and maybe add fresh basil instead of dried herbs,  and use the Quick and Easy Alfredo sauce by Dawn Carter on this Allrecipes site, with my own modifications, which is a delicious recipe.  I cooked the spaghetti (some regular, some whole wheat) and veggies as suggested in this recipe and they came out just right.  I might even add some red onion next time, which might give it the zing it needs.

This was a huge hit for dinner.  My only comment would be that I doubled the recipie and it took the sauce AWHILE to thicken.  Probably will cut down on the amount of milk next time for doubling.

This is a simple recipe and very delicious.  Adding the broccoli to the pasta 2 minutes prior to the completed cooking time gave the broccoli just the right texture.  Excellent!

We liked this, but it was a bit bland, so we sprinkled with pepper and oregano to make it a bit better. It definitely needs some garlic and Italian spices to make it worthy of 4 or 5 stars

In 35 years of marriage I believe this might be the only recipe my husband has used other than  a cake mix or brownie mix.  He made it for me while I was rested after  a small procedure I had done.  He did a great job.   The only suggestion or tip I have for anyone considering this recipe is to eat it as soon as it's done.  My husband cooked it early and put it in a warm oven to hold until we were ready.  It became a bit dry.. but still good.

This recipe was delicious! Before making, I read some reviews of what people thought about it and I saw that many people added a bit more cream cheese than the recipe called for. I ended up doing the same thing because the Alfredo sauce was not quite set enough. I used 3/4 of an 8oz bar of cream cheese, rather than just half of one. I also added Italian seasoning to the chicken, and a bit more grated parmesan cheese and it was perfect! I will definitely be making this again.

I added garlic and more parm than it said but it still lacked flavor. Plus the chicken ended up being over cooked because the sauce took a lot longer than 2 min. Itâ€™s not awful but I wouldnâ€™t make it again

This is really tasty and can be altered to accommodate what I have (no special trip to the store). I already had chicken marinating in Italian dressing, so I didnâ€™t add any to the pan. I sautÃ©ed the chicken in some butter and garlic, sprinkled with onion powder and then continued with the recipe. Except I used angel hair pasta because thatâ€™s what I had on hand. Will make again!

Made this for my Daughter's soccer team Pasta Feed.  I made 8 servings which filled an 9 x 11 glass pyrex and they only sent home a small amount and they all asked for the recipe.  They all loved it and we'll definitely have it again.

The cream sauce didn't thicken very much.  It also needed something else, so I added garlic and it tuned it up nicely!  Just wish it was a thicker sauce.

I found that the sauce didn't thicken up as it should and that the sauce was very bland as written.   It's a decent start to an Alfredo, but needs a lot of tweaking.

This was really good. I added minced garlic and fresh mushrooms when cooking the chicken. The sauce looked a little thin, so just before adding the pasta and broccoli, I thickened it just a little bit with a cornstarch and milk mixture...don't need much though. Thanks for the recipe! I will be making this again.

Very easy and tasty.  I made this following the recipe except the milk.  I added milk until I liked the consistancy, using less than the recipe.

I personally am not a huge fan of fettuccine alfredo but my husband is. And he was excited when he came home and this was cooking. We both enjoyed this beautiful meal. Definitely recommend it. Easy to make as well.

Quite good. Quick and good flavour! A little heavy sauce wise but expected that with the amount of cream cheese.

I didn't have cream cheese so used mozarella instead making the sauce a little lighter.  The flavor was delicious and I probably saved myself a few calories by using an alternative cheese.

I felt this recipe really lacked flavor. I even seasoned the chicken with garlic while cooking, added more while making the sauce.  The sauce was very watery. I ended up adding nearly double the parmesan cheese and still needed a bit of flour to try to thicken it up.  While I loved how easy it was to make (even though the cooking time was off) I don't think I'll be making this version again.

I just made this and it's the best Alfredo recipe I've ever had, considering I made a few changes. I gently cooked the chopped chicken tenderloins on the stove top with olive oil and covered them so they could steam and maintain moisture. When they were almost done I then added the Italian dressing to let them cook in that. The only other thing I did was used a little more Cream Cheese than required + added some parsley with the basil + chopped the broccoli very finely after boiling it with the EGG NOODLES I used. I also added 1 tablespoon of Lawrys seasoning salt and 1/2 tsp of garlic and onion powders. My family INHALED this delicious easy meal! Thank you!

I loved this.  I made a few changes just because I had already marinated the chicken with bottled Italian dressing for 8 hours.  I sauted the chicken in the dressing until it browned down and then added Italian seasoning, garlic powder, salt and pepper.  Then I added the ingredients as listed in the recipe.  I also used frozen rather than fresh broccoli.  It was simple to prepare and I will definitely make it again.

WOW!!!  So good AND easy!  Had to make a few changes due to what was in the house.  Angel hair ( 16 oz.)  and no Italian dressing so ... put olive oil, cider vinegar, Italian seasoning, granulated garlic, and white pepper in the fry pan.   Since the chicken breasts were 1.25# I upped the broccoli to 3 C, and the milk to 2 C.  Kept everything else the same.  Came out wonderful.  Husband was going for seconds but decided he wanted it to last ( wants it again tomorrow!)  Will definitely make this again, and again??.  Thank you so much for posting this.

Let me start by saying, I made it exactly as the recipe reads. It was very quick and easy to make but It was lacking flavor. The chicken alone was very tasty. I might even use it cooked in other recipes but the dish as a whole was bland. I will not make it again.

I seasoned the chopped chicken with 1/2 tsp each of garlic & onion powder about 3 hours before cooking it. Added 1/4 cup parmasean cheese, 1/2 t garlic powder to the sauce & did the cornstarch slurry to thicken a little. It was delicious!! Cooking the broccoli with the pasta the last 2 minutes was so easy.

This recipe was good, I made it exactly following the recipe.
The next time I made it I left off the Italian dressing,instead I
Made a rioux with butter & flour, then added a cup of milk & stirred till it became thick & added the cream cheese & white pepper. Then poured the broccoli into the cream cheese sauce & added the Chicken(sometimes if in a hurry I use rotisserie
Chicken). Sprinkle with cheddar cheese. AndThen I take a tbsp or 2 of melted butter  & a 1/2 cup to a one cup of breadcrumbs mix together & sprinkle over the casserole and bake.  You don't need the pasta unless you want mor carbs.  This makes a great
Pot luck dish, people love it.

I only gave 4 stars because I didnt follow the recipe exactly as written. I didnt have Italian dressing so I used olive oil and seasonings to cook chicken. The sauce didnt seem thick enough so I added a little cornstarch. Next time I might add fresh garlic, but otherwise my family really liked it.  Thank you!

Omg this was just amazing. I add a little extra to it.  I added diced red bell peppers when sauteing the chicken, then when everything was almost done, I added some mixed vegetables(frozen peas, carrots, green beans, steamed them in microwave first)  to it and OMG it was delicious.  Thanks for the recipe. My teen son hates Alfredo sauce and he left his plate clean.
My hubby loved it. Nothing better than making your family happy. Thanks again...

Tried this recipe lastnight for my family and they absolutely loved it, even my 11 month old!! I used rotisserie chicken breast and cut it into bite sized pieces instead of cooking chicken because of time but it still tasted awesome! I also used penne noodles instead of fettuccine noodles because it's easier for my little ones, added a some garlic, salt, and pepper. I would definitely cook me his again and I may try it with shrimp! Great recipe and very easy!

I substituted spaghetti squash for the pasta to make this am almost carb free dish.  It was fantastic. The whole family enjoyed it and asked when we were gonna have it again.  Can't wait to try and add additional items like peppers.

I find most of the sauces bland but this one was good, not overly delicious but good. I followed the advice of others and I reduced the milk to 1 cup and instead of using plain cream cheese, I used the Philadelphia cooking cream with garlic. I also added one diced zucchini to boost the amount of veggies in it.
I think the italian dressing gives the chicken a better taste that when added to the rest of the ingredients makes a good combination of flavours.

My Foods class made this and it was pretty good. We had to add some garlic salt to add flavor. Good but needs more seasoning.

Mouthwatering!  I did make some seasoning additions.  I'm from the Deep South.  I doubled the recipe and added a tablespoon of "Badia Louisiana Cajun Seasoning" to cover the chicken just before cooking it, 1 tablespoon minced garlic just before the chicken is done, and 1 teaspoon of "Kreative Kajun Kooking Magic Swamp Dust" seasoning before mixing the two parts together.  Thanks for this delicious recipe

really really good, but the sauce needs to be thickened up just a bit...  read reviews for tips on that.

Tried this tonight and I must say I was very pleased, my daughter and I enjoyed it.  I did add 6 ounces of cream cheese rather than the 4 suggested, next time I will actually try 8.
