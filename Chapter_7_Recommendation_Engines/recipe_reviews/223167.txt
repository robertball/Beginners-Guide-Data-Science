3.30.16   The crepes are pretty good, but I found the filling and flavor of the cardamom  almost nonexistent.  I definitely would add more to the filling, if nothing more than some small pieces of berries, blueberries, bananas, a little cream cheese, whatever.  There must be some “technique” involved in folding the crepe into a “letter” because that was a little tedious for me.  In the future, I’d probably just fold or roll like an ordinary crepe.  ravera, thanks for sharing a recipe that you used to have in your hostel.
