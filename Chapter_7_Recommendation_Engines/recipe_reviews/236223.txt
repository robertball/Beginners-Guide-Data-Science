These are the best crackers I have ever eaten!  I omitted the mushrooms simply because I can't eat them, but I would not change a thing about this recipe.  I was worried it would have an extremely strong coconut flavor that would overpower the other ingredients and it didn't.  If I didn't have any self control I would have eaten the entire batch in one sitting.

Impossible dough to handle.  Extremely sticky, even stuck to the parchment paper. The end result was doughy/chewy and revolting.
The taste was cloying.  I ended up tearing up the recipe.

These tasty bites were an interesting study for me, since it was my first time to make crackers.  They are not as crisp as I would like, but the taste is quite like a specialty cracker from the grocer.  I followed the recipe exactly, but I used 1/2 the water suggested.  I bet some sesame seeds on top would be a great addition!

I made these, but added rosemary to the mix as I love this herb. It added a lot of flavor. The dough was extremely easy to handle and clumped up in my hands easily and spread well. My problem is they did not turn out crunchy, despite baking longer. I did not have parchment paper, so this could have been the issue. I did make them quite thin, even where they browned heavily on the edges they did not remain crisp once they cooled down. I was very disappointed in this as this is the reason I wanted the cracker. I will have to look over other recipes and see how I can make a crisp cracker. Flavor was great though!

I just made these and they are very tasty! Next time I'm going to experiment with lowering the oven temp after the 18 minutes to see if I can dry them out more so they'll be crispier. I try to eat low carb and somewhat healthy, plus I love to cook, so this is a keeper!

The flavor is outstanding!  I wish there was a way to make them crispy though...maybe rolling the dough out thinner?  I like them best right out of the oven.  :)

The smell was great!  I did add a little basil and sage in with the vegetables.  The flavor was mild, but very good.  The texture was good, but not quite cracker-like for me... too soft really.  But it may be because I didn't get them thin enough? (1/16" is so thin!)  I separated them and put them back in the oven on 200 for 30 additional minutes and it helped dry them out more, but they were still a little soft in the end.  I'd make them again, but I'm curious if there would be a way to make them harder.

GREAT cracker recipe....I don't like frozen spinach., eliminated that but added bacon fat to the coconut oil when sauteeing veggies and used Chili Garlic infused olive oil at the end...did not miss spinach and next time will use half of the salt....doesn't need that much...IMHO
