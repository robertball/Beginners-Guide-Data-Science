Tons of veggies. NOT enough spice. Double everything, add garlic.

I am rating this recipe graciously because to make it to my liking would be easy. However, this took me TWO HOURS to make, start to finish. All the veggie prep work was very time consuming. I didn't like the tomatoes, so I'll leave em out next time, and I'll have to agree with a previous reviewer and say that the spices should be doubled. This is a bit on the bland side (to me anyway).

I thought this was excellent.  Lots of veggies.  Loved the spices.  I didn't top it with the almonds or orange zest because I didn't have them.  I added an extra can of beans.  If you use large veggies you won't have much if any liquid, but that's how I like it..

I didn't have the cardamom but I substituted cinnamon and it turned out really great.  Made a ton for just me though.  Guess I'll be eating it all week :)

We loved it! Since the man in my house can't eat a meal without meat, we did start the pot with 1lb of chicken tenderloins in some broth and white wine. It turned out great.  Beautiful, healthy and tasty!

Start with a big soup pot (I started with a large frying pan, but it was soon overwhelmed). Added 2-3 cloves garlic to the onion stage, couple stalks of chopped celery along with the carrot, added Garam Marsala instead of Cardamom & tripled all of the spices, used diced canned tomatoes & tri-colored couscous, stirred in 1 cup raisins (chopped dates would also be good) at the end.  Would have taken 25 minutes if I did not have to chop anything; probably closer to 2 hours with the chopping.  Makes a lot, so it was perfect for the neighborhood party.

I wish I'd listened to the review that said to double the spices.  I was disappointed in this dish, it's wonderfully healthy and easy, even with all the chopping, but it has very little flavor.   It makes a LOT so I have some leftovers to tinker with;  I'd like to make this work because it's so healthy!

I loved all the vegetables in this dish. My biggest complaints are that there is a lot of chopping and I halved this recipe and it still made WAY too much food.

I agree with the other reviews that this needs a bit more spice, but overall a very yummy recepie and easy to make. You can add what ever veggies you have on hand, but I followed the recepie pretty closely. Would make again and made A LOT!

It defiantly takes longer to make than it says just because of the prep time.  With all the veggies it would take forever, thankfully I had a cool chopper my mom gave me.  It smells great when you make it but I found it to be quite bland.  It could probably use more salt and spices.  I don't care for the garnishes on top.  The orange zest was kinda weird.  I also have learned I don't care for chick peas just because of the texture.  I would also recommend stewed tomatoes because otherwise the skins come off.  Also try it with feta cheese instead of Parmesan.

Tasty and satisfying as a main dish.  My guests really enjoyed adding romano cheese  and slivered almonds to the top.  The almonds were good for the texture and added a bit of crunch.  If you like spicy food, double the spices.  This makes a very mild version.

Very Yummy!  I took the suggestions to double the spices and it was the perfect amount of flavor!  I also added a little garlic.  It was incredibly easy and we had tons of leftovers.  I will definitely make this one again and again!

Even though I gave this a 5, you need to know that where this recipe says it will feed 6, actually it will feed 12.  I cooked all the vegetables according to the directions, and put half of them in a freezer safe container and saved them for another time.  The spices also need something more.  Don't know if doubling up would do it,  I added garlic and I think I could have added a lot more.  However, this can be served warm and then chilled and served again as a salad.  Very versatile.

Used 1/2 the vegetable quantities in recipe except for the courgette and mushrooms which I did not reduce .Used my own judgement on spices based on experience and used juice from a small orange instead of zest. I also cheated and used the 'instant' couscous and only 160ml of stock as it was for 2 persons only which meant the veg/couscous ratio was better. Hubby liked it a lot and I thought it really tasty.Excellent basic recipe to adapt to one's own taste.

Heya, now what a lovely recipe! Im surprised im the the 4th to rate. I changed a few things:  I didnt bother with the carrot or the orange peel, and i used about 150ml less vegetable broth.  It was a fantasic dish, and i served this on the side of baked potatoes and cottage cheese. YUM.

Great recipe! Leaves a lot of leeway for adding more vegetables/beans, or meat if desired. I would also recommend doubling (if not tripling) the amount of spice in it.

Great, yummy, easy, quick, and healthy dinner! I did not have any peppers so instead I added 3 celery stalks (at the same time as the onions). I also did not have the spices, so I used 1tsp. garam masala - which has most of the spices needed plus some others. I added about 1 tsp. of granulated garlic. Lastly I did not have chickpeas so I just left those out. I topped it with Lemon Zest. It was fabulous!!! My mom LOVED it, and so did the toddler, and husband! Thanks! I gave it 5 stars because it was so easy and obviously a flexible meal.

I've never made couscous before but this turned out great!  An interesting, healthy veggie-filled dish.  My guests loved it and rather than putting the orange/parmesean garnish on it, we added feta cheese which added a wonderful flavor.  Also, I couldn't find vegetable broth so I just used water, and I didn't have any cardemom but it was still really good.

I did enjoy this recipe however, there were some issues. First of all it definitely takes longer than 25 minutes. Next, it did need some increases in the flavoring/spices department even with the orange zest it still was missing a kick. Overall, it was pretty good but I think it could have been better.

My complaint with this recipe was the cardamom and paprika seemed WAY too overwhelming. My husband and I weren't able to eat more than half our plates before getting sick of the flavor. I think it needed some tomatoes too.

Quick and easy.  I reduced the broth like others suggested and the lentils and vegetables came out perfect.  I also doubled the spices and added garlic, but unfortunately it still came out quite bland. Topping it with plain yogurt added a little to the meal, however.

This is delicious! I halved the recipe (but it still makes a ton!), but kept the amounts for the spices and garnish the same. I skipped the carrot, used only a yellow bell pepper, subbed a yellow onion, didn't see any baby bellas at the store so had to use button 'shrooms, parsley for the cilantro (personal preference), regular tomato and chicken stock (bouillon cube + water) instead. I will definitely make this again, and try it with the poached chicken recommended by by the submitter. EDIT: This is best eaten the same day its made, otherwise it gets kind of stuck together and 'gloppy'. And the taste isn't the same.

I loved this.  Start to finish 20 minutes.  Beware this makes ALOT of food (more like 10 servings the way I eat).  But totally worth it.  I agree with the other reviewers when it comes to the spices.  Double it, and I also added 1 T. cumin and 2T. of tomato paste and a can of tomato sauce.  I like tomatos.

Not a huge fan of couscous, but this looked good, so I gave it a try. I really liked it. I might add extra spices next time like the reviewers mentioned, but it was still good. I topped this with marinated and baked tofu. I completely forgot the orange zest, but there are a ton of leftovers, so I will add it tomorrow. I would recommend this recipe.

This is super! I didnt have cardamon.  I used a lot of coriander, cayane pepper, paprika, a little less cinnamon, and lots of garlic!  It turned out very tasty!

This was a great way to add extra veggies to our meal. It made a lot, but was kind of bland, add your favorite spices to it, I recommend Curry and Cumin.

Fast and easy to make but very tasty.  I read reviews first and decided to double the spice the recipe called for.  I also added garlic and some cajun spices.  Definitely recommend adding the Parmesan too!

A very easy and forgiving recipe. Can be easily modified to suit one's preferences. I didn't have the issue with prep time that some others mentioned; it took me about 15 minutes to get everything chopped and ready to go. I used whole grain Israeli coucous, so I cooked that with veg broth, but separate from the veggies. After both were done, I stirred them together and let them cook for a few more minutes to blend the flavors. I did make a cpl of modifications based on what I had - I was out of cilantro and cardamom, so left that out, and I added some minced garlic and curry powder. I also left out the orange zest because I am not a fan of orange. I am curious to try it again with the cilantro, as that is one of my favorite flavors. I also think some asparagus might be a nice addition. I will definitely be adding this into my regular rotation of favorites. Love the simplicity, and a great meal to whip up after work.

This recipe was the first time I ever cooked and ate couscous and it was absolutely delicious. A recipe that you can really customize with different broths and vegetables, definitely a go to meal for the winter to warm and fill you up.

This is a wonderfully healthy dish; full of veggies that I love.  That being said, it is rather bland for me, and I agree with other reviewers that the spices have to be doubled (at least!).  I am sure this will be a five star dish once I've added more spices.  Thanks for sharing a very healthy couscous recipe!

Took about an hour to make- about 25 minutes to prep, about the same to cook.  Not sure how the prep could possibly be done in 12 minutes!

I enjoyed this dish, although it was rather bland.  My family did not like it, however, also because it was very much lacking flavor- and I'd doubled the amounts of spices as suggested!

This makes WAY more than 6 servings- more like 12.  Family of 4 had it for dinner tonight, and I boxed up 8 individual servings for leftovers... I added additional spices to those so they'll actually get eaten.

Needs more spices!! The basic recipe was good but I like alittle more spice on the taste buds. It sure did make alot more than expected. I split this recipe in half (3 servings) and it was enough for 1 1/2 cups for 3 people.

Super yummy. I did add twice the spice and some turmeric, which turned the whole dish a lovely golden color. I wanted to add if using Israeli (also called Pearl) couscous, you will need to cook for a few more minutes before taking off the heat, or else the couscous won't be cooked all the way through. Very forgiving recipe - I would imagine you could toss in any veg you have on hand and it would still be fantastic. I also toasted the dry couscous for 5 - 7 min before adding to the pot, and finished the whole dish with the juice of one squeezed lemon, because I like things lemony. Thank you!

The couscous soaked up all of the broth, which was fine.  I added garlic, and substituted curry, cumin, and red pepper for the spices.  I liked the ease of cooking the couscous in the same broth with the vegetables.

I have made this several times, and it is very good with a few changes..  I leave out the zucchini and squash because I don't like them, and use chicken broth instead of vegetable for more flavor.  I also use more like 3 1/4 cups broth instead of four.  I double the recommended spices and add onion powder, garlic powder, garlic, hot sauce, parsley and white pepper.  Also, I mix grated parmesan cheese into the whole dish.  I serve with the Indonesian Satay on this website..

We followed the recipe exactly with the exception of substituting cinnamon for cardamom as we didn't have any. The flavors of the spices were subtle, but that allowed for enjoying the flavors of the vegetables as well. We topped it with toasted almonds and orange zest and thought it was very nice. I recruited my husband to help chop veg, as I was worried that it would take a long time. If I were doing it on my own, I really don't think it would take that much longer, as we were finished chopping well before the vegetables were due to be added. From start to finish, it took 33 minutes to get it on the table. My kids both liked it too and everyone said it was "make again"! Thanks for a great, easy, healthy recipe!

Amazing! Couple of things- definitely double the spices as suggested- perfect that way. You definitely need to put it in a pot- it does make a ton...but that's because the serving size is listed for six.:)  I didn't have cardamom so I substituted cinnamon- perfect.  I added a clove of garlic as suggested- perfect.  FYI- one box of couscous only has 1.5 cups of dry couscous unless you get the bigger one (oops!).  Last, Im not sure why someeople said it takes two hours total with prep. I timed it from start to finish- took 39 min.  Cut up the onion, zucchini, squash And carrot, put in pot. While that is going, cut up the rest of the stuff.  Delicious.

I doubled the spices like other reviewers had mentioned and it was quite good!  I used whole wheat couscous and 5 minutes wasn't enough time to absorb the liquid so i left it covered for 10 minutes.  Overall it was a good recipe and my family really enjoyed it!

Definately double the spices and add garlic.  Also, because it made so much, I did a "test" freeze of a serving.  Just thawed and microwaved for lunch and it was just as good.

Four stars instead of five for the same reason as everyone else; MORE SEASONING!  I added extra salt and lots of cilantro and it still wasn't enough.  I think adding fresh minced garlic to the onion mixture in the first round of stuff in the pot.

The cous cous comes out with the perfect texture and the veggies are just right.  It's delicious....if you add more seasoning.

Excellent dish!  I do like a bit more spice; however the majority of my family likes to taste the flavor of the ingredients - not the spice, and they enjoyed it very much!  (I did as well, it was quite tasty)  Great recipe!

I always add my own flare.  I actually did add @ 4 cloves of finely chopped garlic & a couple pats of butter.  I put green, yellow, orange & red bell peppers.  I substituted allspice for cardamom and added big pinch of Montreal Steak seasoning plus a good dash of Adobo seasoning.  I threw in a couple of fresh sage leaves for good measure.  Turned out pretty good!  Definitely HALVE this recipe unless you are cooking for a Large crowd!!

I love this and have made it many times. I substitute different vegetables based on what I have from my own garden and what is in the fridge already.  This is great for a meatless meal added to your weekly menu.
