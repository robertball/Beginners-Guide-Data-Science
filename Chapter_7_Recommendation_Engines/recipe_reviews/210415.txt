I was skeptical at first with this recipe, but it worked out perfectly for me!  I did make one change..after I blew up my ballon to the size I needed I dipped it in cocoa powder thinking the chocolate would peel away from the balloon better.  It must have worked because I didn't have any problems seperating the chocolate and balloons.  My cups didn't look as pretty as the picture, but they still impressed my family at our reunion!

One thing I recommend is that once you have inflated your balloons, wash them in a very light soap-water mixture and rinse very well to remove any residue from the manufacturing that might affect the recipe.

The directions are misleading for sure! You'll need to add 1 tsp oil to each 11oz of chocolate.To the chef who popped her balloons: your chocolate was too hot! Cool the chocolate for more like 15 mins. And use the small water balloons from the dollar tree. They really do simply pull away from the chocolate if you let them sit in the fridge for long enough. The balloons stick only if you try to separate them from the chocolate too soon! Good luck to all. Keep trying, they take practice to look beautiful,but are impressive on any level!

These are so fun and cheap to make. The only complaint is the balloons are pretty hard to get off.  I found that if you really freeze them and then take a lighter and melt the balloon away it works pretty good and actually doeesn't really melt the chocolate

This is nice - in theory.  Tried to make the cups, but the balloons popped every time they got near the chocolate.  Tried multiple types of balloons as well.  Too bad.

I could not make small cups with my tiny balloons because if I made them small the balloon had a nipple and would not sit up straight. The balloons were hard to get out , I gave up and went on to a new dessert for my party. I wanted shot glass size.  Will wait and buy at BJ's.

No Issues, No problems.  Washing the balloons is a good idea.  I would hope everyone thought to do that first.  Instead of freezing the chocolate put it in the refrigerator for an hour to et it set properly Of course this adds to the cooking time, but it assures you proper set time.

Great idea. Bad follow through. Has anyone done this successfully?
-First try popped the balloon dipping. The chocolate was too hot.
-Second try the chocolate stuck to the balloon and the bowl collapsed when removing it. Added baking cocoa powder.
-Third try the chocolate did not stick to the balloon almost at all and looked like a terrible blob of chocolate.
