This dish was yummy, my boyfriend liked it too.  Changes I made:  I seasoned the raw chicken with some salt, cayenne pepper, and garlic powder first.  In the sauce I cut it down to a lil under 1 cup of wine and there was no strong wine taste, I used white zinfendel (sp?) that is actually pink.    I added quite a bit extra garlic powder, enough until I could smell it in the sauce.  Instead of mustard seed I added about a tablespoon of dijon mustard.  I let the chicken sit overnight with the cheese and sauce on it.  Right before baking I added the croutons and melted butter.  I did not measure it, just added what I thought I'd want.  I baked pepperidge farm puff pastry shells, halfed them, and placed the chicken and sauce over it.  Really good!

I have made this several times for my husband and family. It is our favorite chicken recipe.  I used StoveTop chicken stuffing which added a nice herb flavor. I also eliminated the mustard seed as it was too tangy for my taste.  I agree with others that the wine should be reduced to about a cup or less.  This is an easy recipe that can be made in advance of company.

Yummy! After reading the reviews, I made sure to season the chicken with several seasonings: cayanne pepper, fresh ground pepper, 3 garlic cloves, thyme and salt. I used the full amount of wine called for and it made the sauce taste excellent! I must have used double the amount of croutons called for and I loved it. I also used triple the cheese because the breasts were huge.

I made this exactly as directed (I didn't read the reviews 'til it was already in the oven).  Then I worried about the amount of wine... I needn't have. It came out delicious.  The entire family enjoyed it - from my 5 year old to my very picky husband!  It was an easy, delicious weeknight meal.

This should realy be called creamy swiss WINE chicken. This is a great easy recipe but definetly has a strong wine taste so if you love wine you will love this recipe (I dont like wine so next time ill use 1/3 cup instead) chicken came out super tender though (that was my favorit part.) this recipe is great over rice too! Will make again with less wine. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Really good recipe. I used crumbled up ritz crackers instead of the bread crumbs and used more cheese. Since I'm not a huge wine fan I would probably reduce the wine to 1 cup next time but my boyfriend who loves wine liked it as is.

I didn't like the recipe. I think the chicken breasts were too big and needed to be smaller. I am not sure if I will be making it again.

I made this dish tonight for 8 friends and it was just delicious.  Presentation was beautiful and it tasted as good as it looked.  I followed the recipe exactly except the mustard seed, I used dijon mustard.  Definitely a keeper!!

SUPER DUPER!!!! I didn't have any white wine on hand so I had to use marsala instead. It was wonderful and my whole family devoured this quick, easy, yet very elegant dish that's just perfect for either a week night meal or a nice dinner party. Thanks so much Dan!!!!

This was good and so easy to put together. Although next time I would definitely put less wine. A lot of the flavor seemed to come from the croutons. So you might want to put some seasonings in the sauce/chicken. I also didn't have mustard seed so just substituted dijon. Think I might try it with Panko next time.

I have to agree...the wine amount was too much.  I used half the amount and it still was too much.  I also used half sour cream and half cream cheese (didnt have enough sour cream) and it was good. I still think it needs something else?  The chicken was very moist though.

My daughter thought this was the best chicken she has ever tasted.  She loved the sauce and how creamy it was, loved the cheese.  I used Provolone cheese and mushroom soup and one cup Sauvignon Blanc.

This is really good!  Tried it because I wanted something new to do with chicken.  At first I was scared with the amount of wine it calls for, but when you add the mustard it really comes together nicely.  Don't over salt this dish because the seasoned croutons, add more salt and flavor.    I only wish that it had MORE sauce.  I think next time I make it, I will leave off some of the croutons.  All those croutons soak up that delicious sauce!  So overall MORE sauce and less croutons!   Thanks for sharing!

TOO much wine... and bland... my son and I tried to eat it, but threw the remainder out... My husband ate most of his, but agreed it would not be a recipe I should repeat.  I would omit the wine and add more cayenne and maybe chili poweder?.,.. not sure..

This was very good. I added a little extra cayenne pepper and probably 3/4c of wine. (There was still plenty of flavor from the wine.) I also left out the mustard seed and it was still very good. The sauce was good on rice. This recipe is a keeper!

I put in about 1/2 cup of sherry wine and used a teaspoon of dry mustard instead of the mustard seeds.  The sherry wine compliments the swiss cheese very nicely with it's nutty flavor.  Don't use cream sherry, it will be too sweet.  I could have put a little more in without affecting the taste.  The sauce is delicious, my husband raved about the dish.

Awesome chicken.  Giving 4 stars because we tweaked the recipe according to other reviewers' suggestions.  We used about 2/3 cup wine, and it was still a strong taste, but I kinda liked it.  We also seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper before we cooked it since other reviewers found the chicken somewhat bland.  It turned out great!  This will go into our regular rotation.  Thank you.

It was good but next time I will reduce the wine to maybe half the amount. My family didn't like the wine taste. I also used reduced fat cheese and lite sour cream. Will try again.

This recipe is great. I reduced the fat a little by using low-fat/low sodium cream of mushroom soup, 2% milk swiss cheese, and reduced fat sour cream. Additionally, I added a small can of sliced mushrooms to complement the soup. Lastly, I used Pepperidge Farm Stuffing mix instead of croutons. The end result was wonderful! My husband (who has a very sophisticated palate) loved it! The chicken was tender, the sauce was rich (even with the lower fat substitutes)- it is a recipe I will use again and again:)

Fabulous!  I always double up on the cheese cuz I LOVE Swiss cheese and season the chicken with salt and garlic pepper.  I don't keep croutons around so I use a box of Whole Wheat or Cornbread stuffing (which i always have around) and it really makes the meal pop!

This was really good. I did reduce the wine a bit and was glad I did, as I think the full amount would have been too strong. I stirred a few spoonfuls of the sauce into angel hair pasta, then topped with the chicken breasts. It had a great flavor, and smells wonderful in the oven.

This was an ok recipe. The sauce tended to break apart. I seasoned the chicken before baking and reduced the amount of wine as recommended by several other people. This recipe did not wow me but was well received by my partner.

I chose this recipe because it had all the ingredients I love....plus it seemed like a relatively easy dish to prepare on a busy weeknight. However, the combination of flavors fell short for me. First of all, you really must season your raw chicken.  Not seasoning the main ingredient is like taking a shower without soap! Secondly, like most reviewers, I used less wine than called for, a 1/2 c. Now, I'm a wine lover, but I could have used even less, maybe 1/4 c. I think my main issue with this ingredient combo was the wine with the condensed soup...didn't mesh well for me. I seasoned the sour cream/soup mixture with pepper, garlic/onion powders, paprika, and replaced the mustard seed with dijon. In addition, I crushed some garlic & cheese croutons and added that to the mixture for extra flavor. I also sprinkled extra crushed croutons on top of the assembled dish, covered with foil, and baked 40 minutes. I sprinkled just a few remaining croutons on top and broiled the last 2 minutes to get a nice, crunchy top. I omitted the butter altogether and didn't miss it. Even with the tweaks, I didn't thoroughly enjoy it as much as I anticipated, however, I'm a recipe tweaker by nature, and will likely attempt this recipe again with some adjustments.

This was good, a change from just chicken.  I also used a little less wine as others have mentioned.  Made with rice that I used chicken broth rather than just water, I enjoy the flavor a little more that way.

My husband LOVED this recipe.  It was so quick and easy to make and as for cleanup, well..there was nothing left to cleanup!  I used cayenne, S&P, garlic over chicken cutlets..they cooked up perfectly.  I only had half the sour cream, added 1/4 of the wine and it was awesome, not too rich.  A variation would be to double the Swiss even cook up some bacon strips and make it like a Cordon Bleu

This is pretty good.  I used a single-serve bottle of chardonnay, which is about 1 cup, and I didn't think it was too much wine at all.  I used dijon mustard, but I didn't notice it in the dish much.  I served it over brown rice.  Changes that I suggest would be to double the croutons and cut back on the cayenne (I thought it was too overpowering).

My family liked this. I agree with the other reviewers, to much wine. I also used dijon mustard and I think it gave it to much zing. Next time I will use the mustard seed and cut back on the wine.

Although the chicken was very moist I found it had too strong a wine taste. I would definitely cut back on the wine or eliminate it altogther.

This is a favourite in our house.  I like to season the chicken breasts with salt, pepper and thyme before putting the swiss cheese on.  I use WAY more croutons then the recipe calls, so I don't reduce the amount of wine since the extra coutons just soaks it all up.  I love the kick that the cayenne and the mustard seeds provide.

I wanted to find a way to use my leftover rotisserie chicken without just heating it up again.  Instead of the chicken breasts, I pulled the remaining chicken pieces off of 2/3 of a medium-sized chicken.  I also used shredded Swiss cheese instead of slices.  It turned out to be a tasty casserole!

This is really an excellent recipe, but I did make a couple of changes. I doubled the recipe but used about half the wine, because the first time I made this the flavor came out a bit too strong for me. I also used about 1 1/2 cups of croutons on top for a nice crunchy topping. Broccoli is also good in this sauce, cooked with the chicken. It is a very versatile recipe and responds well to different combinations of spices.

I  was expecting a wonderful dish because of all the great reviews, but we really didn't care for this at all.  The wine taste was overwhelming, even at half a cup, there was entirely too much sauce for four breasts.  We won't have this again.

About 1/3cup of white cooking wine, 1 tsp of ground mustard, no cayenne, buttered panko bread crumbs the rest as-is.  Really good!

I thought this was great!  If you use a good wine (and like wine) the amount of wine shouldn't be a problem but I could taste it.  I particularly liked the little bite from the cayenne and the slight crunch from the croutons.

Very nice.  I made this for my husband and grandson.  I would have added a little more seasonings or herbs, but both the guys gave it a thumbs up as it is, so can't argue with that.  Will make this again.

I don't use cayenne & didn't have mustard seed or seasoned croutons, so I subbed Dijon Mustard and crushed up "stove top" type stuffing mix. Added a pinch of dill weed (as I usually do in any cream recipe) and we thought this was absolute FABULOUS!!Served w/Egg Noodles with the sauce over top and it was a hit in my home. Gone into my recipe box for future retrieval!!

I halved the recipe, but didn't use a full portion of the wine. It tasted all right, but I didn't like that the sauce spread so much and we had to scoop it back over the chicken. Next time I think I'll make the following changes:

Season the chicken a bit before putting the cheese on. It was a tad bland for us. I'll also cook the chicken a bit, then put the cheese on. Heat the sauce on the oven and then pour over the chicken with approx. 5 min of cooking time left. Sprinkle croutons (no butter) on the chicken and broil for a couple minutes. I'll re-review after my second try.

Usually my husband refers to chicken cooked in a sauce such as this as "chicken in glop"  However he asked for me to make this dish again!  I used 1/2 cup white wine, real garlic and garlic powder, ground mustard instead of mustard seed.  The cayenne pepper adds a great touch!

Very good.  I cut back on the wine to about 3/4 cup and doubled all other spices, plus I salted and peppered my chicken before topping with Swiss.  I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs instead of the croutons.  Had a nice amount of zing and the boyfriend loved it.  Reheats well too.

I had doubts about trying this recipe, but I'm glad I did, it's GREAT!  I don't know how to describe the flavor, but it was out of this world.  I followed the recipe as is (except sub. broth for the wine) and it came out perfect.  This makes a sauce that I ladled over noodles with greens on the sides.  Wonderful meal.  Thank you.

I made this recipe for my boyfriend and another couple, and they all really liked it.  I didn't like it that much, though.  For those of you making it, I would definitely add more spices (double the cayenne pepper and add additional spices as desired).  I would also cut back on the the white wine.  1 and 1/4 cups is way too much unless you really like a strong wine taste in the finished product.

Yummy!  Easy to do and uses ingrediants I usually have on hand.  Hubby raved and I enjoyed it as well.  I didn't need to change a thing, it is perfect as is.

This was delicious.  My husband loved it too.  After reading other reviews, I only added 3/4 cup of wine and it still had a great wine flavor.  Next time I make this I will add more cheese and a little more cayenne pepper.  This is definitely a keeper.  Thanks.

This was excellent! It had just enough cayenne pepper to give it a kick that was unexpected but delicious. I added fresh sliced mushrooms before adding the sauce. It was perfect.

I have made this several times and it is one of our family's favorite chicken recipes.  I always generously season the chicken breasts with  creole/cajun seasoning, or Lawry's seasoning salt and garlic salt and pepper.  Also, I only use about 1/2 to 3/4 cup white wine depending on for whom I'm cooking.  It does make a lot of sauce (which we love!) so good over noodles, rice, or potatoes.

This is awesome.  I've made this over and over.  For those who whine over the size of the chicken breasts, simply filet them in  half sideways.  Everyone I have served this to loved it.

This is amazing. I made as is except I used less wine. I used 1/2 a cup. Oh I also used Havarti instead of Swiss. I lived the sauce. We served this over white rice. I highly recommend.

After reading all of the great reviews for this recipe, I was extremely disappointed that for me it just came out okay.  I followed the recipe word for word.  If I choose to make this again, I will definitely use much smaller chicken.  The chicken was really big and no one finished even half.  Also I would use much less wine because the taste was really strong.. The garlic powder was also too strong for my liking (I usually love the taste of garlic, I think it might be better with fresh garlic). :/ Despite the few flaws, overall it was alright.  The croutons were delicious on the top.  Hopefully if I try this again I can get it right.

Great! Loved it! very good! I did season the chicken like other and I used cream of celery soup. I LOVE wine, however would reduce it to maybe 3/4 a cup instead of 1 1/4 cup next time. I also increased the croutons. Served it with garlic bread and a wild rice on the side.

This is one of those recipes that I had to make changes because I didn't have all the right ingred.  Didn't have white wine, so used half chicken stock and half marsala wine (about 1/2 c. each of both).  Again no garlic powder so used fresh minced garlic & used Cream of Mush. instead of Cream of Chix.  Put over steamed rice.  Even with all those changes, ended up being really good...my kids loved it and wanted seconds.  Will make again because it was SOOOO easy to put together.

Wow...what a great dish! I decreased the wine to 1/3 cup and subsituted about 1tsp spicy mustard for the mustard seed. There wasn't a strong wine taste nor was the meat bland. It was perfect. I even used Mozzerella instead of swiss for two pieces of chicken (only had 3 pieces of swiss) and while I din't like the taste as much, it still was pretty good. We loved this recipe! Thanks for sharing.

Until I figure out the secret to making this a great recipe, I give it an average rating. I read the reviews and cut the wine to 1/2 c. It still had an overwhelming flavor of wine. I am thinking about using chicken broth instead. I added more sour cream. I also took the advice to season the chicken. I choose salt, pepper, and garlic powder mix. I think that helped.

I've been using this recipe with great results for many years...(thank you to the original poster)... I substitute provelone for the Swiss, omit the cayanne pepper, and use mustard powder not mustard seed. The sauce is awesome when mopped up with hawaiian rolls, and it pairs well with corn.

I agree with most on here that there is too much wine to this recipe. I actually used 7 chicken breasts, and the mixture on top was more than sufficient. So cutting down on the wine will give a  thicker mixture and take out less of the taste that cuts from the dish. The flavor of strictly chicken seemed a bit bland to me as well so I subsituted a Cream of Mushroom with Roasted Garlic to accentuate the taste. It worked out very well aside from just an overwhelming wine flavor. . .

I made this before reading some of the reviews and we really did not like it (at all).  I thought the sauce was too cheesie and rather bland.  OTOH, the chicken was very tender and moist.  Overall, MEH...:shrug:

If you like swiss cheese, you'll probably love this. It kinda smells weird to me. Definitly cut back the wine at least by half. Chicken was very tender. I won't make again.

This chicken recipe is GREAT!  I have made it several times for my friends and family and get rave reviews each time.  I do add double the swiss cheese and a little more mustard.  This recipe has saved me on many occasions!

The sauce was a lot thinner then I expected.  It was not as good as I was hoping it would be, mabey b/c I used chicken broth insted of wine.  The sauce tasted like a thinned out version of cream of chicken w/ added garlic.  I ended up taking the chicken out and fring it with bread crumbs b/c I could not imagine serving it!

This gets a resounding 5 stars from me and my hubby.  So quick and easy to put together and incredibly tasty.  I substituted seasoned bread crumbs for the croutons ('cos I didn't have any), reduced the wine to just over half a cup as mentioned in other reviews and served it over rice.  Quite delicious!  Thanks Dan

I'm giving this a 4 because my husband and I thought it was good but I think the wine taste was too much for the kids.  They did not really care for the sauce at all even though they liked the chicken.  (added double the cheese on their chicken which they did like)

This was great.  easy to make and very tasty.  I cut the wine down to 1/2 Cup and only had cream of wild mushroom soup in the house and that worked well.  My teenage son who is very picky, liked this one.

This tastes like chicken with cheese fondue... which I really liked, others weren't as sure but I think it comes down to if you like cheese or not. Very easy to make for a large party.

This was just ok. I noticed most of the reviews said the dish was on the bland side so I used really garlic & extra mustard. It wasn't bland at all, in fact the wine was quite an overpowering flavour. Also, I didn't like the croutons on top as they were almost burnt after 30 mins cooking and the flavour of them was not nice at all. Still prefer BARENGATE BAY CHICKEN from this site as a dish made with a can of soup base.

I made this recipe over the weekend and actually heard my husband raving about it to a friend on Monday!  The wine really makes this dish.  Have not done this yet, but next time I will add mushrooms as they tend to hold wine flavor so well.  Thanks for a new favorite!

What a wonderful base recipe! I did have to make a couple adjustments due to not having all the ingrediants, but it still turned out wonderful! I didn't have any cream soup, so I used an alfredo made with parmesan and mozz. I doubled the spice and added a little CURRY, strange I know but it added a little something that made this recipe memorable. My boyfriend brought the leftovers to work and happily devored them long before dinnnertime. Thanks for a great recipe!

This was really good, but I used other suggestions of only 3/4 c wine and increasing the cayenne.  I will make this again.  Thanks!

This was quite tasty.  I'm giving it 4 stars as I changed the recipe a bit.  I used 3/4 cup white wine and 1/8 tsp cayenne.  I also substitued mustard powder for mustard seed and crushed whole wheat Ritz crackers for the seasoned croutons.  I didn't grease the baking dish 1st as I figured the chicken wouldn't stick due to the sauce & it didn't.  I thought the Swiss cheese would remain on top of the chicken pieces (like chicken parmesan) but it melted nicely into the sauce.  The good thing about this recipe is that it had some tang due to the cayenne & mustard.  Sometimes recipes with cream of chicken soup turn out to be pretty bland.

I thought this was really good, as my husband LOVED it, but we both really like swiss cheese. I only used 4 chicken breasts and there was lots of sauce, but that's the way I like it. I would probably add more crushed croutons next time. Yum!

Thanks Dan!  This chicken dish was fantastic.  My whole family loved it and we will definately be having it again.  The only change I made was to reduce the wine to 3/4 cup (as per previous reviews)and it still had a delicious wine taste.  I served it with a rice pilaf and bread sticks (to soak up all the yummy sauce).

WOW, this was FABULOUS! My boys are so picky and even they loved it. I served it with plain white rice and the extra sauce tasted great mixed in with it. I did cut back on the wine the second time I made it (to a little less than a cup), it was a little strong and I added more crushed croutons and butter than called for, yum! I will be making this one again and again.....thanks Dan!!

I really liked the looks of this recipe, but I did change a few things.  I used 1 tsp of garlic salt to replace the garlic powder.  I cut the wine down by a 1/4 C, and the mustard seed to 1/2 tsp. I added another 1/4 tsp of Cayenne pepper, and 1/2 tsp of Dijon mustard.  It came out great!!

Recipe was excellent, however I felt the wine was a little overpowering, so I cut down by a 1/4 of a cup the next time I made it, and it seemed to take the edge off. Leftovers taste great and very easy to prepare.

This dish was very delicious and not too difficult to prepare.  We have even prepared it on work nights.
