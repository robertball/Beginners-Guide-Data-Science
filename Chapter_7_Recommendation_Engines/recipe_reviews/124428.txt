I use leftover mashed potatoes for my potato pancakes, around 2-2/1/2 cups worth to make this recipe.  The grated onion adds a nice savory flavor evenly throughout the pancakes.  The pancakes take a bit to cook on the first side, maybe 4-5 minutes.  Use slightly lower heat (medium to medium high) or they will get too dark.  Let the top dry around the edges before flipping.  I use only enough oil to coat the pan, then just a hair more.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I tried using a slightly thawed half bag of frozen hashbrowns because the grating and draining got a little messy and it worked great!

My mother made the best potato pancakes in the world, when I was just a wee bit of a kid I could slam away a dozen with no trouble at all. We had an old fashioned grater, that looked like a rectangular tennis racket, with curvey cross bars, not like the graters you are probably familiar with. I would grate my fingers raw and bloody getting the potato and onion all grated. What I remember most was the light, crisp oniony flavor along with homemade applesauce...ahhh heaven.  Using the food processor the grated potato was in larger pieces than the mush of my mom's taters, I remember the key was to drain off the excess liquid. This recipe was nice except not nearly enough onion. To 4 cups of grated potatoes you need about 1/3 cup of grated onion, do 2 beaten eggs, three to four TB of flour, salt and pepper to taste. The potato mash should hold together when pressed against the side of the dish with a spoon. Get your oil nice and hot, just smoking, then reduce to medium high, you want that instant sizzle....spread the pancake as thin as you can possibly get it without holes....don't undercook, these are best crispy!! You get a nice crisped outside with a soft inside.....heaven with the homemade applesauce!

Very good, just make sure they are very thin or the potatoes aren't fully cooked.  I also used cooking spray instead of oil.

What a greasy mess!! BUT - - they were delicious to eat!!!  They were very simple to make but I had a huge mess to clean up from all the grease that splashed while they were frying.  I think next time I will try spraying the pan with Pam instead of using all the oil to fry in.  But, they really were good to eat and I will probably make them again.

mmmmMMMmmmmm!  Easy, convenient, and delicious.  Just like one would get at your local carnival.  My wife even loved them, and she doesn't like potato pancakes.  They're really not that messy if you take your time and cook at a low temperature.  I will definately make these ones again!  I've also topped them with an over-easy egg!

I enjoy these most with a bit of salty butter or just plain salt sprinkled on them - whichever tickles your fancy.

A lovely way to spicen up your everyday potatoes!

These were good and easy but I needed more egg to hold it together. I used thawed hash browns so that may have been the problem with the binder. Other than that they are addictive.

Just one suggestion to raters, if you do not like it that is very ok---there is no reason to be cruel and hit below the belt with comments---- These weren't for me, but they will appeal to others I am certain.

I was going to rate these a 3 as I found them a little bland as written. My husband however loved them so they will be on the menu again. I plan to use more onion next time and just chop it very finely as grating it really didn't work for me. Thanks for a great starting point Lydia.

These were OK.  My potatoes were really wet so next time I will spend more time draining them.  I added a bit more flour, and I put in some grated cheddar for my kids.

So easy and came out great!!! I served them with smothered pork chops and apple sauce and my 5 year keeps thanking me for the delicious dinner.  Will definately make again.  I added a little bit more salt and flour, but I also used about 8 small potatoes.

Wonderful recipe!  I did cheat and use refrigerated hash browns though.  My family loved them and we will definitely continue to make them.

This recipe is similar to the one that my Irish aunt and Polish grandmother gave me 5o years ago.  This one is very good.  In our family, Potato Patties are made with mashed potatoes and Potato Pancakes are made with grated potatoes.  I do now use hashbrowns instead of grating potatoes (arthritis).  This recipe is 5-star and a keeper.  Thanks Lydia.
