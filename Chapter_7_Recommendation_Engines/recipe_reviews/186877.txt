Quick and easy.  My husband prefers these to the "real" thing.  The only thing I do differently is to use enchilada sauce (canned) instead of salsa.

This was a good idea, but there is something wrong with the recipe measurements because it didn't turn out right for me.  I think it was supposed to be 2 lbs. ground beef instead of 1. I only got 11 small enchiladas.  There is no way 1 lb. of ground beef goes with 32 oz. salsa and 20 tortillas.

I liked this recipe because it was easy to make and very quick- but for whatever reason when following the original recipe it only yielded eight enchiladas.  My husband and I both noticed that the pound of ground beef seemed a bit small for a pound, so perhaps that's the issue- all and all I really liked this recipe.

This was really good, but you don't need to put two jars of slasa on the bottom of the baking dish. I only got 8 burrito sized enchiladas out of this too. I will make this again, very easy very fast and very good!!!!!!

This is a great recipe except it was too tomato tasting so I mixed a half of one of the jars of salsa with one can of cream of chicken soup, used half of that in the chicken stuffing, not hamburger, then rolled and placed on top of salsa in pan.  I used rest of half and half mixture on the top, covered with foil, baked 20 minutes then uncovered, topped with cheese and finished baking.

I thought my hubby was going to keel over he ate so much :-)  He absolutely LOVED this! I enjoyed it, but not as much as he did...think I might try it with chicken next time.  It is a very easy dish that we'll put on regular rotation! I also added a can of drained rotel tomatoes. Fabulous!

I tried this recipe for the first time tonight and absolutely loved it!  It is amazingly easy to make and the outcome was amazing.  I did use about 1.5 lbs of hamburger and a 23 oz jar of queso, along with one 23 oz jar of salsa for the bottom layer.  I used twice the meat per tortilla than the recipe called for, and it made the enchiladas very filling.  Ten fit perfectly in my baking dish!  I will definitely use this recipe again!

I used enchilada sauce instead of salsa and poured the second can over top before adding the cheese. I also used taco meat with about half a can of black beans (drained) and half a small can of diced jalape√±o  (also drained.) Very happy with the result! And this was very easy to make.

This was a good starting point recipe, but I changed quite a bit. First off 1lb of ground beef only made 9 enchiladas. Instead of using chili con queso I added chunky salsa and shredded cheddar to the ground beef mixture. I used 1 can of enchilada sauce over them once in the casserole and some also under them to coat bottom of dish. Then I sprinkled additional shredded cheddar over the top and some chopped fresh bell pepper to garnish" I baked at 350 for 30 minutes" it was delicious, I also served an herb rice dish on the side.

It turned out ok. I found it was very cheesy. And felt the ratio was off. It just seems to be missing something. My kids loved it. My husband and I are meh.

This was fantastic. I used Pace chunky salsa but drained it to add the juice to a can of enchilada sauce. I also added garlic powder and Cajun seasoning to the meat mixture. I put the drained salsa in the beef mixture as well adding the thick paste and veggies from the salsa. I added just a bit of cheese to the meat filling because no one ever said it had too much cheese.

I followed the recipe, adding chopped onion and garlic to saute with the meat, and chopped black olives when adding the cheese sauce.

Everyone enjoyed the dish!

Incredible. Wish I tried this year's ago.  I also used red enchilada sauce instead of   salsa.  My whole family loved it.  My husband always orders enchiladas from our local Mexican restaurant and he says these are just as good :-)

The proportions are wrong. The queso added to the ground beef makes soup. Only 10 tortillas needed. Not worth trying to adjust this recipe because it is flavorless.

Very simple, easy to make. The amounts are off, 1pound of ground beef was barely enough to fit 9 tortillas. The amount it made was enough to perfectly fit the 9x13 in dish though. There‚Äôs no way this makes 10 servings. Also, I saved some of the salsa that was supposed to go on the bottom to put on top as well, and that was really good. It was enough for 1 dinner for 2 of us, but we are also hearty eaters, so there‚Äôs that.

This was  excellent!!! My wife thinks I am the King of the kitchen. I did not use any salsa at all, just  added cheese (sharp), taco seasoning, and red sauce (one can) to 3 lbs. of  ground hamburger. I also added cheese to the inside of the enchiladas.
Ummm Ummmm GOOD!!!!!!!

I've made it 3 times so far. I've changed the meat to chicken and works just as well. I look forward to this dish every time. Mmmmm mmmmmm good!

Loved it... and so did ALL the kids! Very simple, easy, and quick to do. I did take the suggestions of other reviewers. I used one jar of salsa at the bottom of my baking pan, ground turkey, 4-5 Tbsp of meat and cheese mix, and Mexican cheese on top. This is one that is going in the rotation. I think next time I would like to try ground chicken.

Great enchiladas. First time making them, but loved them and the family said do it again. Next time we'll try either shredded chicken or ground chicken. Beef, it's what was for dinner tonight! Very easy recipe. No changes necessary.

Easy yes, but lots of room for improvement. So I used lean ground beef with onion, garlic, green peppers, tri-color beans, Mexican shredded cheese and red quinoa. Then topped it with smoked cheddar, enchilada sauce, and more smoked cheddar.  Will top with Cilantro when it comes out of the oven!
Muey Bueno!

This was my first time making this but the recipe was very easy to follow. I think I left it in the oven too long but I will let you know what my family thinks

Made it... I would say it was okay... my niece and her friend seemed to really enjoy it; however my daughter did not. Thinking next time doing a recipe for enchiladas that requires a little more work for prepping and making.

I used about 15 oz. of enchilada sauce mixed with 1 cup of salsa  and seasoned with cayenne and chili powder in the bottom of the pan.
 I also added a can of diced tomatoes and a couple ounces of velveeta cheese to the browned ground beef, as well as seasonings. 
That mixture only made 7 small wraps but tasted great, and I'll definitely make it again.

So good!!  I seasoned the chicken with taco seasoning, added some red tomatoes and chilies, as well as some salsa rojo and verde. Definitely making again. So easy.

I added onion, garlic, cayenne, salt and pepper to the meat while browning it. I didn't have salsa so I subbed in some enchilada sauce I had in the pantry and I sprinkled some diced green chiles on top with the cheese.

This was so good and my husband loved them.  Unfortunately I made a full batch and with just the 2 of us eating them we got tired of them by the 3rd day.  But the next time I made them we enjoyed them again. lol
