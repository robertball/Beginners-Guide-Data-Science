This is really the est eclairs I have ever tasted. There is no better vanilla cream anywhere! Just use only 1/4 cup cornstarch and it will turn out perfect! Don't look for another recipe. THis is it!

I've made these twice.  I like the pastry part of this because it's a little more substantial than the store bought eclairs; not so flimsy.  The filling is worth making from scratch instead of using pie filling.  I used less cornstarch than called for and some 2% milk instead of some of the 1/2 and 1/2 the second time  and it was still very thick.  The frosting is excellent.  I used a little bittersweet in the place of some of the semi-sweet morsels and it tasted like a fancy restaurant.  Only caveat I have is don't try to make more than 12 because the pastry is quite airy and if they are small and get an air bubble, when you split them in half you will have no bottom half.  EXCELLENT!!
