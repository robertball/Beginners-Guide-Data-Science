Really nice! It would be great for a salad/appetizer style party. I used about 1.75 lbs ground turkey and added a few garlic cloves to the onions. The allspice is great but definitely needs more - and that's after I added extra from the start! Pine nuts toast very nicely on the stove with no oil (they release their own natural oil). I made my own hummus and only used about 1.5 cups. Layered: hummus, pita, meat, pita, hummus, meat, pine nuts, parsley, paprika, lemon juice. Refrigerate leftovers and heat them up the next day - tastes just as good if not better! ~UPDATE~: after years of making this (to absolute rave reviews), I have changed the layering structure: hummus, meat, pita, hummus, meat, pine nuts. With only one layer of pita, it is a bit lighter. We LOVE this dish!

Excellent recipe.  I followed the directions, except I added some garlic and cumin to the ground beef.  I also toasted the pita breads into small chips or croutons.  I served this with the Arab lentil and rice dish called "Mujadarrah", also from this website.  Great combination!  I will make this one again.

I used the Spicy Chipotle Hummus recipe on this site, I used the bottom of the bag Tortilla chips instead of Pita Bread, and I used Cilantro instead of Parsley. It gave this recipe a real Southwestern flare.

This is so healthy, fresh and delicious! I have made this numerous times now and my husband loves it. I have made it both with ground beef and ground lamb - both are great. I triple the allspice every time. Depending on what I have, I make it into a sort of salad - just put a torn pita on each plate, top with hummus, then the meat, then either shredded romaine or halved cherry tomatoes (or both), then sliced red onion, then parsley. Salt, pepper, paprika, lemon juice. SO good! The pine nuts are tasty as well, but I feel like you can easily skip them if you don't have them to hand. Enjoy!

This just sounded weird to me (and I'm pretty adventurous when it comes to food).  It turned out to be REALLY GOOD and quick/easy!!!  Will probably make this at least 3-4 times per month.  I left out the pine nuts because I didn't have any.  I will make sure I have them next time because it will make the dish even better!!  I agree with the person who said the allspice isn't very noticeable - it was very subtle, but I think I would have been missing something in flavor if I left it out.

Another great recipe, very authentic, thanks.  I like to put ground beef on top of mine, so I cooked it that way.  Also, make sure to have chopped onions or green onions on hand to chomp on with every bite of the casserole.  Also, have halved lemons ready, some people prefer to squirt lemon on their own plate.  I love adding more lemon on mine.  Thanks! Just like my moms.

Wow, hummus casserole is exceptional. I wouldn't have guessed as casserole could be this refreshing. Most are so heavy. Nice, summer like flavors that meld well.

Very good.  I almost didn't do the layering with the pita, then I decided to go ahead and do it.  I layered in a bowl, not a casserole dish, and added the ground meat.  I had venison, not ground beef, so I used that instead. I did use the allspice--and if you are worried about it tasting weird, it doesnt.  You can't really taste it at all. The whole thing is very good.  I figured I'd like it--I've had something almost the same (it wasn't layered though) at a Lebanese restaurant and it was delicious--but it's nice to know I can make something very similar at home.  We ate just this for our dinner; very filling. Thanks for sharing!

Distinctively different, and will make again. This review based on optional ingredients being included. While we enjoyed eating it as instructed, we liked it even better when briefly heated-up before serving. The amount of pita bread seemed a bit overpowering (a bit to dry) but was fine when served warm. The hummus spread will make or break this recipe. I don’t think this recipe will come out w/ a higher rating that what you assign to your hummus spread if tasted alone as torn pita bread and pine nuts won’t pull-up the rating. I choose “Smokey Chipotle Hummus” from this site, and it was great when coupled w/ this recipe. Had a store bought hummus been used, this probably would have been rated a 2 or 3. Thanks IMANKAY for a versatile recipe that can be changed-up by using different hummus spreads.

This was WONDERFUL! I made the hummus myself using the Basic Hummus recipe off of this site. FYI if you're making your own hummus, two cans of chickpeas worked beautifully for me--one can for the bottom layer and another for the middle. This was truly delicious, we will definitely be making again!

I halved the recipe and omitted the meat. I had to use sunflower seeds instead of pine nuts, but they still added a nice crunch and good flavor. This "casserole" (it's hard to call it that when it doesn't bake) went over quite well at a party, but I was pleased to discover that the leftovers were even tastier after a couple days in the fridge, and (for you this may be a positive or a negative) the pitas became quite soft after a day or two. Great snack! Definitely add plenty of lemon juice.

This wasn't a make-once-a-week recipe, but the family really like it so I don't complain! It needs vegetables and crackers or something to eat with it.

I made it with the ground beef and can't imagine what it would have been like without it.

I truly like this recipe.  I used the hummus III recipe to give a fresh flavor.  This one is a keeper.  The allspice while subtle is still important it adds a layer of flavor.

My husband and I both love hummus, and while this tasted very good (I made it with the beef and am glad that I did), we both found that the flavor became monotonous well before we became full. If I make this again, I will make it with several contrasting dishes on the side . . . a tomato salad, perhaps, as well as a cucumber salad.

This was good and VERY different...But it also makes ALOT of food. I think next time I'll just make half of the recipe. My husband and I liked it but didn't eat any of the leftovers...Probably because I couldn't figure out how to reheat it.  Hubby also thought the beef needed more seasoning. Sure is tasty though.

I messed this one up a little. I was trying to make it from memory after reading it the other night. I thought the whole dish had to be heated because I remembered 9x13-lol.  It was really good though and I would make it again.

I have a very picky child who has added this recipe to her "list" of foods she will eat!  I used the Hummus III recipe to make this casserole.  With this recipe, the only problem was that I didn't know what was meant by tear the pita into pieces.  I halved the pitas with a knife then separated the pitas.  I also added ground turkey browned with minced onion and greek seasoning.  Perfect dish for a hot summer evening!

I tripled the onions and used cashews instead of pine nuts.  I also left out the olive oil because it was unneccesary.  The onions cook in the grease from the meat and there is already plenty of oil/fat in the nuts and hummus--so why add more?  I thought this tasted very good, but it was very filling.  It might be better with chicken instead of beef.  I also didn't layer it, I mixed it all together.  I didn't see the point in layering it.

This was good. The only problem with this recipe is it is dependant upon a good hummus recipe for it to be good. I also think the texture can use a little crunch to it. Some toasted pita chips added to the top would make this really great!

I make my own hummus and have been looking for a recipe to incorporate hummus into, well this is it.  Making it more Middle Eastern, I use ground lamb, sauteed with lots of garlic, cumin and oregano.  On the finish I add a healthy pinch of kosher sea salt. A sprinkle of fresh cilantro adds a nice kick.  I serve this with sliced sweet white onions and fresh basil.  A nice trick my Persian friend taught me, and I love it, as do my dinner guests, it's very different.
