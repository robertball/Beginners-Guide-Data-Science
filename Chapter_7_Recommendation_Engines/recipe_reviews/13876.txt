This is an excellent recipe that is uncomplicated and easy to make.  The wine adds a tangy flavor to the onions that is outstanding.  Made it for Thanksgiving this year (2005) and it was a huge hit!  One relative ate five helpings!

I first made it for Christmas in 2004 and made a mistake.  The recipe calls for "boiling" onions.  It should state “pearl” onions.  I used small onions the first time I made it and soon realized it's going to take a lot longer than 25 minutes to cook.  This resulted in a loss of too much wine and a considerable increase in cooking time.  This year I used pearl onions and they cooked in 25 minutes.

Both times making this recipe I had to add either flour or corn starch to thicken it.  1 cup of heavy cream added to 750ml of wine is just not enough.  I suggest 1tsp corn starch added to about 2oz of water mixed well, then add it to the onion mixture.  This way you don't have to whisk the flour into the liquid, which would require you remove the onions.

I would never suspect wine would be a good base for creamed onions, but it works fantastically!  I used a complex and oaky Chardonnay: Toasted Head.  Give it a try and keep the things I stated in this review in mind.  It'll help produce a real nice dish everyone will enjoy.

You must use a quality chardonnay and boiling onions!  The hardest part of this recipe is preparing the onions.  I tried this recipe on Thanksgiving as well- and it was a tremendous hit.  Requests were made to add this to our list of holiday traditions!

I will add this to my traditional holiday menu! I used fresh small onions and  boiled them in a 1/2- 3/4 bottle of white wine I had on hands, with a bay leaf and thyme.  I actually overcooked the onions somewhat carmelizing them(awesome oops).  I then transfered the onions to a baking dish  covered them in cracker crumbs, 1/3 cup of melted butter and evaporated milk as I didn't have any whpping cream.  I topped it with shredded parmesan cheese and finished cooking them in the microwave as I was out of space in the oven.  They turned out GREAT! People were asking for the recipe. Next time I will try it with some fresh garlic aswell.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

We made fairly significant changes to this recipe, but it's a great base.  I added 1 cup of Parmesan cheese, about 4 Tbsp of cornstarch to thicken (mixed with warm water so it doesn't clump), 3 cloves of pressed garlic and about 1/2 tsp of white pepper.  It was fantastic.  The cheese cut the tang of the wine, and the wine made it taste very gourmet.  It was a huge hit.

This recipe was good, but not exceptional - personally I would have liked more liquid, so next time I'd use more wine & more cream.  I'd also kick it up a notch with something... perhaps some roasted garlic.  Thanks for the idea!

AMAZING!!!!!   People always say don't use wine for cooking that you wouldn't drink, and since I am not a fan of chardonnay, I substituted sauvignon blanc one time and pinot grigio another...delicious!!!  I added a bit more thyme than the recipe states, but that was just to personal preference.  Everyone loved these onions and begged for the recipe.  They are the best creamed onions ever in my opinion and so very easy to make.

Excellent recipe and so easy!  I am a creamed onions fan and have longed for a recipe that wasn't just your basic onions and flour/milk white sauce.  This was a HUGE hit at Christmas Dinner and will be a staple.  The sauce was a little thin at the end (maybe too much wine??), but thickened up with just a little flour and wine mix.  I think I'll throw in some peas the next time.  Definitely listen to other reviewers and use good wine (I used Kendall-Jackson) and the golden onions.

Excellent recipe. My mom found this recipe about 4 yrs ago to make for my grandpa at Thanksgiving. He always talks about the delicous creamed onions his mother made. Well last year he omitted that this recipe was better then his mother ever made. The rest of my family also loves this recipe and coming from a group who doesn't care for onions is amazing. My mom also took the recomendation of using a quality wine.

I have made this recipe for the last three years now, and with each version, I think I've got the cream sauce just right now. The wine by itself is too strong.  This year I added a can of chicken broth, and then filled out with about one third to a half bottle of Chardonnay.  This provided enough liquid and the chicken broth tempered the tang of the wine.  I also had no thyme and did fine substituting marjoram.  

Like other reviewers, I had difficulty getting the sauce to thicken.  I would suggesting simmering for 15 minutes, and if it is still too runny, then add 2 tsp. of cornstarch (pre-mixed with water) and then it will be fine.

I've hung in with this recipe because it really is a unique version of creamed onions, and my guests said this year's version was the best.  

I would strongly suggest working with fresh pearl onions; they're just much better than frozen.  Blanch them for 30 seconds in boiling water, and the peeling is not so bad.  Takes about 30 minutes to peel 20 ounces.

My family loves this dish and it has become a family holiday favorite.  If I don't make it, everyone whines. :-)  Sometimes I lighten it fat free 1/2 and 1/2 instead of the heavy cream, but both ways it's wonderful.  This year I lost my recipe, and am very thankful (pun intended Thanksgiving) that the recipe was still on the site. L from Ohio

This is a new favorite! I made this for Thanksgiving 2009 for just my husband and I. He is not a fan of vegetables- would prefer just turkey, taters and gravy- so he withheld comment when I told him I was making this. I did a few changes, tho. I did use white pearl onions and also some very small red onions from my garden. I did not want to use that much wine-the cook has to have some- so I mixed equal parts wine and chicken broth which only came to about 2 cups to cover half the onions. I closely followed the recipe thereafter, but could not get it to thicken. So I started adding grated parmesan, stirring and adding more until it got to the consistency I liked. I served it with a little fresh ground pepper and pretty soon my husband started to mmmm-ing, ooooh-ing, and then...WOW! I'm impressed! Add this to our favorites! You should comment on this! So I did! Enjoy and thank you Fredda for an easy recipe.

I made this recipe with boiling onions and it took an extra 10 minutes to cook in the wine.  I am sensitive to dairy, so I added full fat coconut milk and ghee (clarified butter) then allowed the sauce to reduce until it reached the desired consistency.  It was SO GOOD!  I have never had such yummy onions before!  I will definitely do this again.

I made a bechamel on the side, then added the chardonnay and the onions last instead of just adding the cream and butter to the wine.

Ehe. I used a good wine I love, pearl onions and thought the taste was almost bitter.  I boiled them with the skins on about 5 minutes, cooled, the snipped the ends off so they popped right out of the skin. Then finished cooking in wine - maybe the wine is supposed to evaporate more or maybe just not the taste for me.  Thank you!

Made this for today's Thanksgiving. The taste was wonderful. Didn't have Chardonnay, so used a good Marsala. Could not get it to thicken. Wish I'd read all the reviews for suggestions. Also, it would be very helpful to have times spelled out. "Simmer until it thickens"... so I kept simmering for something like another half hour. Was that correct? I'll definitely make this again, but next time I'll do the suggested... pre-boil the onions, then dump them in cold water. The skin pops off. (I spent waaay to long peeling each onion)

This is a game changer, people. I've been making these for my Thanksgiving table for at least 7 years, and these go first and are still talked about, with drooling whimsy, by friends/family years later. 
My changes: fresh thyme: a few sprigs. White pepper. I usually remove the onions from the wine once cooked and then reduce the sauce. One or two swipes of fresh nutmeg. Pour sauce back over onions and boom, gorgeous. Thank you Fredda!

Excellent recipe!!  This was my first thanksgiving and I doubled the quantities and just like the other reader, at the end it was a little watery so I threw in a couple tablespoons of flour and it was a HUGE hit.  My mother-in-law used to use cornstarch to thicken it up. Thanks!
