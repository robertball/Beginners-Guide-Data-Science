These were delicious! I will make them again. I used pizza dough instead of rolls and I think I will continue to do that.

This recipe is great, but it is certainly not quick.  The filling is no problem, but rolling the dinner rolls is a pain. I will make again but try it using refrigerated pizza crust and making 4 large calzones.  (Note: the recipe as stated makes 8 small calzones -- we had two each.)  They were a big hit with my husband.

These were AWESOME!  Flavor was wonderful.  I used refrigerated pizza crust as recommended by Skipper and it was super easy to work with.  This is definetly a keeper!  Thank you!

You can't go wrong with this great little appetizer. We had a "calzone making" get together Saturday night for our daughters' upcoming birthday party. We decided to use deli pepper ham instead of the sausage. Because it's a party, we went all out and deep fried. A bit time consuming, but if you've got friends helping, it's a snap. Yum and thanks!

I followed the recipe with a few minor modifications.  I used Pillsbury Pizza Dough.  I wanted to make small ones, so I cut out 5 inch circles and was able to get 6 or 7 from each roll of dough. I scaled the recipe to make 12 servings and was able to use almost all of the filling.  I used red and green pepper since I didnâ€™t have a yellow one.  For the sausage, I used half sweet Italian and half sweet Italian chicken sausage/  I brushed the tops with an egg wash and sprinkled with Parmesan Cheese before baking.  These were really delicious! I also made Spinach and Ricotta Calzones from this site and served with warm spaghetti sauce.

The taste is really wonderful, but be aware that it's really quite time consuming and tedious to roll out the dinner rolls into 7" rounds. So be sure to plan ahead for this.

These were time consuming, but worth the time spent.  They were very flavorful.  I will try pizza crust next time and see how they turn out!

These were really good and fairly easy (a bit time consuming becuase I made 30 of them in one sitting). I couldn't find refridgerated rolls, so I used frozen instead and it worked great. I ended up cooking up about 15 and then freezing the rest. They will be a couple of really great dinners when I am pressed for time.

My husband and I love this recipe. I don't use the refrigerated rolls, though. I make pizza dough with my Breadmaker. I use ground sausage from my local meat counter. While the bread is getting ready to go, I do all my chopping, cooking, and preparing.  Usually I make these on Saturday or Sunday when having a day to unwind with my hubby. I divide the dough as if I am making lots of small pizzas. Roll it out into a circle, stuff with the ingredients as this recipe states and pop into the oven. It takes a little practice, but I found that if I make them too big or over stuff them they don't come out as well. I like best to use Basil Marinara warmed for the top when they come out of the oven. I prepare extra to put in the freezer for those days when you can't think of what you want to eat. My kids are boring, so I stuff theirs with the cheese mixture and chopped pepperoni. This way we all win.

After reading the other reviews, I was surprised when my biscuits rolled out so easily.  Used 1/2 lb sweet Italian sausage, 1/2 lb pepperoni, and 1 green bell pepper (same as the recipe for the rest), and the results were overstuffed.  Be careful not to bake too long.

Very easy, and if you make the filling ahead of time, relatively quick.  I used turkey sausage links and pepperoni since I didn't have enough sausage.  I made the filling the night before and stuffed them today.  I used crescent rolls and although it took me a bit of time to put them together, I figured out the best way is to use 2 of the crescent rolls to make a rectangle, then top with another two and seal the edges.  Worked perfectly.  16 minutes was perhaps a little too long with the crescent  rolls, as they were a bit browner than perhaps I'd like, but still good.  Thanks for the recipe!

These were pretty good.  We used refrigerated thin crust pizza dough.  I took a little longer than I was supposed to with other stuff, so I did this strombolli style which was a time saver. I think next time I would use normal or thick crust refrigerated dough.

I made my own dough which turned out great but when it came to stuffing the calzones it sort of all fell apart.  But the tase was great!

These were really good!  My husband loved them.  I used Pillsbury pizza dough from a can and it worked great.  Next time I'll buy 2 cans of dough because we had some filling left over.  Will definitely make them again!

I, personally, did not like the "bread".  Will make a pizza dough next time and do it "right" because this was more effort than the taste provided.

turned out great! I used pizza dough instead, and flame-roasted my peppers beforehand on my gas burner. Just like a fried pepper and sausage sandwich!

The filling in this is great and I had enough left over to just mix it with pasta.  The rolling and creating of the calzones was totally beyond me - mine came out like blobs, but they tasted good!  I think next time I'll use the recipe for the Pampered Chef braid and use this filling.

I made these for a dinner group of 8. I doubled the filling and used frozen rolls for the crust (I thawed them and used two rolls to make one calzone). These were definitely not quick, though. I have a lot of time in the evenings, so I assembled the calzones over the course of a couple of days (made the filling one day and refrigerated overnight, stuffed the calzones the next, baked on the third). I served them with a green salad and jarred spaghetti sauce. Even though it was time consuming, the finished product got rave reviews. I would probably make again, but enlist some help in the future.

NOTE: This recipe is definitely an APPETIZER.
It tastes good, but takes a long time.  Rolling out the dough was a bit difficult and next time we'll use pizza dough or bread dough.

450 degrees was WAY too high for my oven, and besides prep time, recipe was yummy and versatile - tonight I'm trying with sausage and pepperoni and a little rigotta.

it was a little greasy as far as I was concerned and it caused the bread to get soggy. BUT! I can say it could be my fault due to the type of sauce I used. I think I'll try something a little different next time.

This recipe was easy and delicious. I changed it quite a bit tho as i was pressed for time. I used sweet and spicy italian sausage. I used only green bell peppers instead of yellow and red, deli style sliced provolone and mozzarella . I also used Pillsbury pie crust instead of rolls as it was all i had and i also didnt have the time to make pizza dough. I think it turned out amazing.  The pie crust was soooo good with this recipe. The texture and flakiness was eveything i wanted in the crust although it was so flaky it had to be eaten with a fork. My family devoured these like it was the best thing ever.  Yes, i would make them again.
