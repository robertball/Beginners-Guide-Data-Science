Hard to rate because I messed up and my potatoes and veggies had been in fridge overnight and didn’t cook. No fault of recipe! I loved the ease of recipe. One of simplest recipes. Liked that!  I bought the Kens Greek Vinaigrette.  Tasty marinade. Will definitely try again but not make same mistake.

Delicious and super easy to get together.  The chicken was moist and delicious.   The green beans were slightly crunchy for us, so, I kept them in the oven a little longer.
