This is a very good cookie bar recipe.  Adults and children seem to like it equally well.....  Good as written, but a couple of clarifications on the recipe to make this better:  First, the crust turns out better if the butter is softened to the point of melting, but hasn't actually turned to liquid.  Second:  Press down on the bottom filling lightly; DO NOT tap down hard as you won't be able to get it out of the pan.  Third:  You must use quick oates NOT rolled oats on this recipe.  Helpful hints ~ First: For a change of pace, try half butterscotch and half chocolate chips or 1/2 caramel and 1/2 butterscotch topping for variety.  Second:  Slightly chill the carmelitas after they have finished baking.  This helps the  cooke bar "set-up".  This is the one tip you don't want to forget on this recipe.....  The carmelitas are great to make ahead, travel with or freeze to serve later.  As my son would say:  Scrumdiddlyumptios!  Enjoy!

I used a recipe just like this only it was doubled for a 13x9" pan.  The chocolate chips stay the same at 1 cup and 1/2 cup nuts, if using.  The caramel icecream topping is 1 cup - flour is the same.  You cook the final product 18-22 minutes - it took 22 minutes in my oven to produce a golden brown topping.
Also - a good TIP is that if you refrigerate the carmelitas 1-2 hours before cutting (this helps the filling set up), they will not be crumbly and will cut perfectly.  Plus - DON'T MELT THE BUTTER in the crust ingredients - just soften the butter (unsalted) to room temp.  You will get a much nicer crumb topping this way.
These bars are just wonderful!  Another recipe I saw for these used 3-4 chopped Granny Smith apples mixed with 1 tsp. cinnamon for the "filling" instead of the choc.chips/nuts - I'll bet that would be fantastic, too.  I'm going to try that combination next.

Fantastic cookies!  My son is allergic to nuts, so I left out the pecans and made up for it with a bit more oats and chocolate chips.  I also add 1 tsp of pure vanilla to the "crust" mixture.

After making this several times, I've found the butter is the key to cookie consistency.  If you melt the butter and add it when it's still warm, the crust will be more cookie-like (think Toll House cookies on top and bottom.  If, however, you just soften the butter and add it at room temperature, they are more like bar cookies, with a distinct crust, chocolate chip & caramel layer, and a crumbly topping.  In addition, putting them in the fridge for an hour or so before cutting improves them even more.

These last about 2 days in our house and require at least a gallon of milk to be on hand. :)

Would have given it 5 stars because these are very very good however, I used all the same ingredients and measurements but my cooking time the second time was more like 30-40 minutes NOT 15!! Also many reviewers have used almost double the melted butter...I believe you must be using ROLLED oats insted of QUICK outs which are different. That is way too much butter for something going into a 9x9 pan!

These are incredible. I was at a bakery and they were giving samples of carmel oatmeal bars and I never thought I'd like them, but they were fantastic. I looked on here for a recipe, and these were even better than the bakery ones!

I doubled the recipe but kept the amount of chocolate chips to 1 cup. I used an electric knife to ensure smooth and sharp edges (SEE MY PHOTO) since it was a bit difficult to cut without crumbling. Be mindful of the serving amount. I can't see how a 9 x 9 pan can serve 36 people. I just doubled the recipe and it was "inhaled" my only 6 people. Thank you for the recipe!!

So yummy! I didn't have any carmel, so I used peanut butter (melted a bit in microwave) instead. Everyone loved it - my kids too.

Fabulous!  I made these for tailgating and they travelled very well and received rave reviews.  People were fighting over them. They have the perfect amount of sweetness, although the amount of butter could probably be reduced.  I was concerned at first because after 15 minutes of baking, the batter still looked runny in the middle.  I think I ended up baking them for 30 minutes or more and they still had a soupy consistency.  But after they cooled, they firmed up - whew!!

Oh my GOD.  Unbelievable.  If you're making these, plan ahead: run an extra 20 minutes, or whatever you do to make up for cookies like these cuz there will be ZERO self control.

i'm not a big fan of semi-sweet chocolate...milk chocolate chips work just as well
white chocolate chips don't take away from the caramel taste...if you really like
 caramel double the caramel mixture
i also put a little more 
brown sugar in the oatmeal mixture too

Tsk, Tsk, delicious recipe, but except for the amount of chocolate chips, this is a copy of a winning recipe submitted by  Pilsbury Cookoff winner Erlyce Larson, 1967. 1 star for not giving credit where it is due.

Wow! These are about as decadent as you can get.  I had to leave out the walnuts due to allergies, so I used white chocolate chips in their place.  I also doubled the recipe and baked them in a 9X13 pan.  I baked the bottom crust an extra 5 minutes.  Ooey, gooey and oh-so-delicious!

I just finished making these and they are truly 5 star!!  Made exactly as written, 9 by 9 pan, I can see actually how this would serve 36...I had one small decadent square and it was outstanding!  I would maybe add MORE nuts, but that's because I am a nut fanatic!  Absolutely delicious and worthy of a 5 star rating!!  Thanks so much for the great recipe!

I made with the exact ingredients from the recipe. But used only 1/2 c butter instead of the 3/4 cup called for. They came out fine:not too crumbly  These are, by far, one of my favorites  bars, after making them. I only had an 8 x 8  pan, so mine were a little thicker, which was even better, in my opinon.  I really enjoyed the chewy oatmeal part with the soft chocolate center, and the crunch from the nuts. I didn't use parchment or foil like some did (in their pictures) and other than sticking a little on the very edge, I had no trouble getting them out of the pan. But I did let them set up overnight before cutting.  Thank you, for submitting this outstanding sweet treat recipe!

These are very yummy.  I've made them several times and everyone seems to enjoy them.  I've made them with and without nuts, and I like them both ways.  Last time I made them, I sprinkled the chocolate chips on the hot crust, allowed them to soften, then I spread them out with a knife, creating a layer of chocolate.  I liked them better this way and will probably  do that every time.  Delicious!!!

These are very yummy, but with a name like carmelitas, I thought they would taste more like caramel and less like chocolate.  Don't get me wrong, I love chocolate, but it wasn't what I was looking for in this recipe.  After making this a few times, I have determined that my family likes it best if I reduce the butter to 2/3 cup, reduce the chocolate to 1/3 cup (about 2.5 oz) and omit the nuts.  This cuts down on the greasiness and really lets that caramel flavor shine!  A real keeper!

These are one of the most delicious cookie recipes I have ever made.AND I just stumbled upon them one late night surfing! I agree with other reviewers that the final baking time should be increased to achieve golden brown color. I am now going to sub peanut butter and chocolate for one batch and dark chocolate and raspberry preserves for another and finally hazelnut spread for my final batch. I think there are really endless possibilities for this recipe and I'm sure they will not last long. Happy baking!

I have never had an Oatmeal Carmelita before. I was under the impression that these were supposed to be soft and gooey, but mines came out kinda crunchy. Personally, I don't mind the crunch, but no one else in my family could really eat them because of it. This is what I did: I doubled up the recipe of the crust. I used macadamia nuts instead of walnuts, and I used chocolate covered raisins instead of semi-sweet chocolate chips. I thought that with my modifications, this was going to be cloyingly sweet, but it really wasn't. In fact, I probably could've used more sugar. I'm really not sure if I'm going to make these again.

I made these two times, followed the recipe and they seemed a little runny.  Will make them again but look for modifications to stop this from happening again.

YUM Yum and yum! So good.  I only made two small changes. I had some crushed up graham crackers so I threw 1/3 cup in the oatmeal mix. I didn't taste it much but think this could be good. I also didn't have walnuts so I used peanuts.  This is soooo good.  Only problem is it was hard to get out of the pan!

These were soooo good! I did use 1c. of walnuts, because I like a lot of nuts. Note: press top crumble into walnut, carmel mixture or it may be too crumbly.

Great with changes.  It's very sweet as is, and I'd say it serves more like 12 for a 9x9 or 18-24 for a 9x13.  I one and a half the recipe (a 9x13 is a bit more than 1.5x the size of a 9x9) by changing the servings to 54 and use MOST of those measurements instead.  I use 2 sticks of softened (not melted or it'll make your crust tough!) butter, less chocolate chips than called for (maybe 5 oz. for the 1 1/2 recipe) and one 12 oz. jar of caramel (an even cup? Why is 12 oz. an even cup? I measured it and it's exactly 1 cup...).  I bake it all in a Pyrex 9x13 for the suggested times.  It's crazy simple and travels, stores & freezes beautifully.  Perfect pot luck or BBQ take-along.  This would be great with ice cream for those of you who love to gild the lily...

One variation for apple crumb bars.  The substitution for the middle of the bars is a 21 oz can of apple pie filling.   Puree the filling.  Put the filling into a sauce pan and bring it to a full boil.  Add 1/2 tsp liquid pectin (gelling agent) and continue to boil for one minute.  Take the pot off the heat quickly and add 5 tblsp of flour.  Mix well and spread over the cooked crust of the bar.

These are wonderful!  I've made these many times in the last two years, not sure why I haven't reviewed this before now.  Anyway, I made according to recipe except that I used pecans instead of walnuts just b/c I don't care for them.  I grease my glass pan and have never had a problem getting them out.  They are definitely rich but even better topped with vanilla ice cream or whipped topping!!!

I started out making this for our cookie exchange here at work, but while typing out the recipe book we were handing out there seemed to be a lot of recipes with oatmeal and chocolate so I kept these for my husband and me to snack on and made something else.   I'm SO glad I did.. I absolutely loved these cookies and they are now on my all-time favorite list.  Absolutely agree that the 9x9 is not enough for 3 dozen but it is well worth doubling the recipe because the 9x9 is not enough for me.  YUMMY!

These are fantastic!  Every single time I've made them they are a huge hit.  I've tried cutting the butter, and I end up having them being too crumbly, but still delicious carmelitas.  I've finally accepted that I have to use all the butter if I want to make a good presentation with them.  I don't happen to like walnuts so I subsitute pecans.  I've also used peanut butter, but they are much better with caramel.

I've made this recipe many times now and it has been met with rave reviews each time. I did have to bake it longer then the suggested time the second time in the oven- probably 20 minutes and I did find that the amount of butter is a little over whelming and tends to make it even a little greasy.  I'd recommend cutting back on the butter by two or three tablespoons.  But this recipe is fantastic because you can mix up the ingredients in the middle to suit anyone's taste. Over all the recipe is excellent the way it is but I've made it with peanut butter chips in the middle as well as chocolate. I've also made it adding coconut.  It all depends on what you're in the mood for.  But make a double batch because they disappear quickly!

I was looking for a recipe to use up a jar of Chef John's Salted Caramel recipe that I had in the fridge and this was it!  I had all of the other ingredients on hand except for walnuts, which I would not have put in anyway due to our preferances.  These are delicious!  I find them neither too sweet or too greasy.  They are rich and decadent.  I will add this to my list of goodies to bake often!

Super easy recipe, reviews on how they tasted aren't back yet. I omitted the nuts but didn't substitute anything more than a few extra semi-sweet chips, so that probably affected the consistency. Mine turned out a little gooey with all of the caramel. Next time, if I omit the nuts again, I will make more crust to contain everything. I did bake an extra 10 minutes to achieve the golden brown and used softened rather than melted butter as others have suggested. No problems getting it out of the well-buttered pan other than all of the sticky caramel.

Excellent recipe! My kitchen is being remodeled, and I do not have a sink or dishwasher. I mixed the ingredients in a gallon sized zipper bag, melted the butter in a paper bowl and stirred the caramel with a plastic spoon. To bake them, I bought a cheap $1 foil pan. They came out HEAVENLY and without a single dish to wash!!! It's our new favorite recipe and I am baking another batch right now!!! The only thing I did differently was to use pecans instead of walnuts. Mmmmm!

Absolutely delicious! The cook time was a little longer for me, about ten more minutes for it to brown. Regardless, they were so good and chewy. I don't usually like nuts in desserts but you don't even notice them in this recipe (I used chopped pecans). The perfect balance of ingredients. I will make this again and again.

Yummy and easy!  I did use my homemade caramel that didn't quite firm up.  I also used, all whole wheat white flour and 1/2 cup butter, instead of 3/4 cup butter.  Also used a heaping 1/4 cup of semi-sweet chips and heaping 1/4 cup dark chocolate chips.  Sprinkled half with chopped pecans.  Very yummy!

These are absolutely decadent and so easy to put together.  The only thing I did differently was to leave out the walnuts b/c I didn't have them in the pantry.  my bars came out of the pan just fine and they were easy to cut after about an hour of cooling time.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, I know I'll be making these a lot!

I LOVED these!  Taste just like they came from the bakery, and they looked pretty too.  Everyone enjoyed these, and even took some of them home!  I followed the advice of others and used only softened butter vs. melted, other than that I followed this recipe to a T.  I will certainly be making these again.

I did not love these but everyone else at work did so I am giving it 5 stars based on that.   They are just like date squares but instead of dates its chocolate and caramel.  I used dulce de leche which is a slightly thicker version of carmel sauce.  As a result of it being thicker I used slightly less flour over the mixture of carmel and chocolate, 2 tbsp instead of 3.  They were easy enough to make and had a nice texture.

These are my very favorite treat.  The only alteration I made was to make my own carmel sauce as I don't keep premade in the house.  Very simple and everyone in my house loves them.

Rich, warm and very delicious. Easy too, which is dangerous. I made no changes to this recipe and was very happy with the results. So was everyone else. It took 10 minutes for the pan to disappear.

Wow these were good!  It is hard to stop eating them! I only used 1/2 cup of regular oats, (I thought I had the whole cup) and it turned out fine.  I also used caramel apple dipping sauce, and that worked out great too.

I made these pretty much by the recipe (which I doubled and made in a 13x9 pan) except that I mixed both chocolate chips and butterscotch chips (OMG - to die for!) and I also sprinkled coconut on top. I am not even kidding you... these are soooo super yummy! Incredibly rich, totally delicious, and a big, cold glass of milk is a must. My family is gobbling them up as I type. They definitely need a good hour or so to get nice a cool in the fridge before cutting or they're just a mushed up mess. If you can't wait the hour to let them cool, then you may just want to dig into that mess with a really big spoon =]
This one's a keeper.

I took the advise from some of the other reviews to bake it longer (+20 mins). My family and I literally inhaled them once they cooled down. These are the best!

I made these two days ago(as I MADE my husband save some of them to test the theory of them being better the 2nd  day), they are!
I did not have 9in pan, so I used my 8x8.  I ended up baking the bottom crust probably 15 mins instead of 10, but that's b/c it was thicker.  I ran out of butter, so I had to use just a small dash of oil to make it up.  With such a small amount, it made no difference.  I did the 3/4c chocolate chips.  And 1c the caramel topping.  Others said that they couldn't really taste the caramel, and besides 3/4c took the jar almost completely away anyhow.  Baked for about 30 mins.  My husband cut into them about an hour later, and they were a pretty gooey mess, but had GREAT flavor.  They sat overnight, and man, are these bars rich and delicious.  But note that if you don't like rich things..you won't like this!  I would cut back on the chocolate chips for my personal taste, keep the caramel where it's at!

These are truly incredible.  After baking a batch and sending them with my husband to work, complete strangers called me to get the recipe, and now they ask for them regularly.  It's true that they taste better after a night in the fridge, but just try to get them to last that long, I dare you!

Good flavor, texture. I would suggest waiting until the next day to cut them up. Otherwise they will fall apart. Best served hot with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top!

Made them once, will not make again.  As one other member said it like eating date squares but with chocoate in the middle.  I would actually prefer eating date squares!

Very sweet and good!  I agree with some that it's too much butter.  I used full amount, and I don't think it needed it - made the bar heavy.

Wow is this good.  I made it for my bunko group and everyone loved it.  I made it without the nuts in case someone was allergic.  Don't think they are needed to make this one a winner.  Very easy to make and I just put it in the fridge once it had cooled some to keep the carmel and chocolate chips from being too gooey or sticky when eating it. Definitely will be using this recipe again.

THIS IS MY ALL TIME FAVORITE BAR COOKIE RECIPE!!!!  Although, I do use mrs. richardson's how fudge instead of caramel for the filling.  The walnuts are a MUST, so if you don't like them, you minus well skip this recipe.  They add so much flavor!!!

I made these last night and they are so good!  They are really gooey and want to break apart real easily when taking out of the pan.  Next time I might decrease the butter just a tiny bit or not spray the pan first because you really don't need to because of all the melted butter used for the oatmeal crust

This should be rated FIVE stars!!! I am pretty sure that this is the BEST cookie bar I have EVER had, including store-bought and everything.  They are so moist and just yummy!  I used warm chocolate fudge instead of carmel, and they were just lovely.  I was making them with a bunch of little kids who love baking, and they had a great time.  Defidently try these!!!

This was a really nice cookie/bar recipe.  I did double the crust ingredients to make a 13x9 pan and left the topping ingredients the same. 

It was time consuming in regards to having it set up to cut.  I originally was going to make these for a cookie exchange (11doz) but considering how much time was needed to have these cool and set up I decided against it.  It is a great recipe though.

This is the best recipe ever!  My husband says they are his favorites and he eats A LOT of sweets!  My co-workers say that if I made these everyday they'd be happy happy!.  I didn't have walnuts one time and used cashews, they were still really good.  I think any nut would be delicious in this recipe~!

Just finished making these, and if you're a stickler for expecting the same results such as those provided in the recipe, do know the following: 1) Not sure of the assessment of the texture of the first mixture before it goes in - it's not "crumbly" but is of a sticky consistency. 2) not sure what, in step #3, the line stating "you will need to break it into small pieces to cover" is trying to convey.  You're drizzling the caramel mix over the bar form --there's no "breaking" that needs to take place.  Just spoon it over and smooth it out.  I have no doubt these will be very yummy but just wanted to clarify some of the expectations set in the original recipe text.

These were totally awesome. I wanted a larger pan full of these. I used a 9x13 pan but then made 1-1/2 batches and it was just right for a 9x13 pan.  Disappeared fast!!!!!!!!

I screwed this up in an attempt to double in a 9x13. Flavor was great, but definitely missing something, and way too much butter by just simply doubling the recipe.

If I could give more stars I would!  This was incredibly outrageous.  {the perfect PMS fix.} I made it to bring to my neighbors for dessert.  She made me leave the leftovers with her!  I can't wait to make this again...like maybe tomorrow! The best ever.

I doubled everything for a 9 x 13 pan.  The only thing I will do different next time is not double the butter.  I thought there was way more than needed.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Yum, these are great. I didn't use nuts and used some toffee bits I had instead. After they cooled I cut them, wrapped them individually, and froze them. They are good right out of the freezer! Thanks!

The walnuts can be left out, they don't add much to the dessert, but this is the tastiest bar I have had. I had to double the oatmeal cookie recipe for a 13x9" pan, and I cooked it the time it stated, and it was undercooked, but I like it that way, so I kept it. It really does taste better the next day!

I made this batch twice.  The first time came out too dry and separated. The second time amazing. For me the key was to use 1 1/2 cups of melted butter for the crumble mixture.  Then I double the amount of caramel in the center. Baked it for 20-25 minutes.  These didn't last very long.

You DO NOT need to change a thing about this recipe. I followed the recipe EXACTLY as written, and the only difference was that I doubled it to make a 9x13 pan. I did not alter any of the measurements when I doubled the recipe. I melted the butter in the microwave just to where it was softened all the way through, but not completely liquid. I baked each layer as is, but lightly patted down the top layer of oatmeal crumble into the caramel layer so that it would not be too loose and crumbly after baking, but that's about it. Otherwise, I baked these the night before and when they were done, I let them set up overnight on the counter. The following morning I used a very sharp knife around the edges and was able to cut into the bars with no problems or sticking because they set up very well overnight. The bars came out very easily from the pan, I did not use any foil or parchment paper on the bottom of the pan. All was needed was a metal spatula to get them out. I was able to cut about 4 1/2 dozen small bars, which was more than enough because each bite was very rich and perfectly sweet. I placed each bar into cupcake tins, and they were excellent treats for my family.

These are delicious but a little messy.  Recipe calls for 9X9 pan bust says it makes 36.  This would be really tiny bites. I doubled the recipe and use 13X9 pan and cut 4 by 7.  I probably could have cut them 4 by 8 but still would end up with 32 servings with a doubled recipe.

My new favorite bar cookie. So easy, and so quick. I agree with others that they're even better the 2nd day. I usually have all of the ingredients on hand, so I'm sure I'll be making these often!

Double the recipe and make it in a 13X9 pan.  They go so fast that is the only way I can make these around the house.  These hands down are my Grandson's favorite bar cookie, every recipe  is based on the question "is it as good as an Oatmeal Carmaelita Bar?".  I am begining to wonder if these will be the Grooms cake at his wedding...I hope that is many years away but the thought does cross my mind ;)

Wow! These are absolutely indulgent! Mixing the caramel sauce with the flour is genius and keeps the caramel from running out of the bars. I used an 8" x 8" pan so my bars were a little thicker and my crumb topping went further. I just sprinkled chocolate chunks (instead of chips) and walnuts until I felt the surface area was sufficiently covered. These will be on my baking list for Christmas.

AWESOME!!!  These oatmeal bars are a big hit with my family and friends. The only modification I made was to use Kraft caramels melted with a couple tablespoons of milk instead of the caramel ice cream topping.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I make these according to the recipe and they always turn out great! Everyone loves them. I would suggest making them several hours (or a day) ahead of time because they take a while to set up to bar form. I usually end up eating them while they're still warm (with a spoon)... :)

Absolutely delish! But if you are watching your waistline, don't rely on the nutrition information. It is based on 36 servings from a 9x9 pan. I'd like to meet the person with enough self control to stop with one of those tiny pieces.

Very good dessert!  A bit too sweet for me but my coworkers and boyfriend loved it!  I didn't have caramel topping so I made a quick caramel and used that instead.  Yum :)

I love this recipe. I use pecans in place of walnuts, but otherwise follow the recipe exactly. Just thinking about them makes me want to go make another batch.

good, rich flavor. I made the recipe as is and i felt like it was a little too much butter - my bottom crust was a little greasy.  Also, I might add a little more of the filling next time

Doubled the recipe for a 13x9 pan. Used Nestle's La Lechera dulce de leche which is dulce de leche in a squeeze bottle found in the latin american section of the grocery store (I found mine in food lion)..turned out FABULOUS, RICH AND CREAMY. Taking this to a Carolina Gamecock football tailgate tomorrow...I KNOW people will gobble these up. Can't wait to share them with everybody!

I know this got great reviewes from a lot of people but it was just ok for me. The recipe is not a "keeper" for me. The texture was "real gooey" as stated but not that flavorful for us.

One of my all-time favorite cookies, these are addicting. The problem I have is keeping myself from eating all the crumbly dough before getting it in the pan! :)  They definitely need an extra 12-15 minutes baking time at the end. These are SO GOOD!

Incredible!! To keep these from being sickly sweet, cut the brown sugar and the caramel syrup to 1/2 cup. A tsp of vanilla is a nice addition. My guests can't get enough of this.

As long as you are making, you might as well double and do a 9x13(unless you are afraid that you will eat them all as they are addictive).  There is nothing that I didn't like about them - they are a delicious bar cookie.

If you haven't tried this, don't miss it!!  Incredibly yummy!!  I made several batches for holiday family parties (they always disappeared fast!), and my dough never turned out crumbly.  It was a breeze to press into the bottom of the pan, as well as to cover the top.  This recipe turned out perfect the first time and every time.  It's a keeper for sure.  Thank you!

These are absolutely fantastic!  I love them!  I skipped the mixing of the flour into the caramel sauce and it still turned out great-I just drizzled the sauce over the top.  Yum and a new favorite!!

Not bad. Mine were not quite as sweet as I'd like and I'd say definitely too floury as is. However, I see a lot of potential in this recipe and I won't give up that easily. Made this as dessert with chicken pasta. I made mine with caramel-milk chocolate morsels and it came out very well using that. For presentation, I squeezed caramel in a drizzle pattern first and then melted chocolate with a little butter and drizzled that over the caramel. Pretty good as is, and with tweaking, it can only get better. DF loved these and said they were remniscent of Chewy bars. Thanks for the recipe!

These were very good. I too doubled the recipe for a 9x13 pan - I doubled all ingredients except kept chocolate chips to one cup and used one cup of caramel topping. I think the amount of butter could be reduced also. I will probably reduce it by about 1/2 cup next time. This recipe is a definite keeper.

I didn't have any caramel on hand so I made one batch with just chocolate and one with peanut butter in place of the caramel. Both are amazing!

This recipe was awesome! I took it to work and it was gone in no time. It's almost like a chewy granola bar, but it has that layer of chocolate and caramel in the center. Definitely very rich!

We loved these!  I couldn't resist eating two at once.  I cut down the butter per everyone's suggestion.  My only swap was that I used dulce de leche (yum!) in place of caramel and therefore added only 1 T. flour since it is thicker.

A little too sugary-sweet for my taste, but they still disappered. I toasted the nuts in the oven while the bottom layer was baking. Have a big glass of milk or coffee close by!

After reading the reviews, I had to try them.  They are great!  I ate the first one out of the pan with a spoon while still hot (how good can THAT be!), the next ones in my lunch bag (crumbly but good) and the rest of them after sitting out on the counter.  (Again, crumbly, but SO worth it).  Followed the recipe as written, except did not measure the carmel or mix it with flour, just squeezed it out on the dough right from the bottle.  Too much butter?  Not that I could see. I didn't have to "blot" my crust after taking out from the first baking.  A delicious, rich, satisfying cookie.  Thanks Sharon M for sharing!

We love these!  A family favorite for many years! They are our traditional first day of school "after school treat" - and this year our youngest of four is a senior!! We double (except this year!)and find they're best kept in the refrigerator - though they're not around for long!! Sinfully sweet and wonderful!

These are tasty but they didn't get rave reviews from the family.  It might have been my fault though.  I'm not too sure how 6 ounces of chocolate translates into cups so I guesstimated the quantity.  Also, I ran out of ice cream topping and finished the amount with caramel dip (for apples).  I'm not big on nuts so I didn't add any.  I did add some vanilla to the crust mixture as others have suggested.

Great. Made this twice first according to the recipe and a second time using white chocolate chips instead and coconut instead of walnuts. It was great both ways. Let it set a while and cool, it firms up better. Great with a scoop of ice cream on top too.

We love these!  I made them to take camping and my husband's first bite got an "mmmmmmm" that had a special zing to it, meaning these are a keeper.  I didn't measure the carmel, just put a bunch on.  Next time I'll put more and fewer chocolate chips.  I doubled it in a 9x13 and cut back a bit on the butter.  A winner of a recipe!

I just got done baking these bars and they are good but can be better.  I found they had way too much butter which made them greasy, next time I try these I will either cut the butter down or increase the flour.  Mine also were not done after 15 minutes.  They needed more like 25-30 minutes to cook.  With less butter these are definately 5 stars!

It does need extra baking, and maybe some more salt...they're almost too sweet. I used unsalted butter, so maybe that was the problem. They are tasty, though.

WOW!!! These were fantastic!  I did bake them about 7 or 8 minutes longer than stated though.  They just didn't look done yet after only 15 minutes.  I will be making these again definitely!

Very good - the edges were the best part with the crunchy carmel.  I might add even a little more carmel next time.  Thanks for the post!

These are really really good.  The only problem I had with them is the second bake time is not near enough.  They were disgusting after following the recipe.  Raw oatmeal batter in sugary gooey caramel is not good.  After cooking a while longer they were A+ though.

I had this recipe from a book, and then I saw it on the website! Just had to add that these are AWESOME!!!!!!!  Sometimes, you could reduce the butter and they taste just as good.

These were so easy to make!  I took them to an anniversary party and everyone commented on how good they were.  I used milk chocolate chips and pressed the crumb topping down a bit before baking so they wouldn't be as crumbly to eat.  Amazing!

Wow...I had the stuff to make this recipe and it was so easy! I don't like walnuts so I used pecans. I am trying to wait until the morning to eat anymore. It's a good thing I am on a diet or the whole pan would be gone! Thank you!

YUMMY! Hello chocolate lovers this is the recipe for you! Very easy to prepare, definitely will make this again. Also, I think the topping/crust would be absolutely, sinfully DELICIOUS as a topping on vanilla ice cream. I was eating it out of the bowl!!

I made these for a graduation party and everyone loved them. We had a variety of 10 or 15 cookies and these were the ones that everyone was picking off the cookie platter.  My kids loved them too.  They are the BEST.

A previous post stated this recipe was an old Pillsbury recipe and credit was not given.  This is not quite right because the Pillsbury recipe on their site calls for a double measure of ingredients for a 9x13 pan and the same 6 oz. Chips .  So this recipe has double the chips which is a substantial amount for chocolate lovers.

Made these to bring as a potluck dessert. People were asking for the recipe. They were easy for me to make. Enjoyed tremendously. I used 3/4 for the bottom and crumbled 1/4 on top. Turned out spectacular

Beware!  These are sticky, gooey, mess even after baking an extra 10 minutes.  Sure they taste great, but they are MESSY!  Not something I could take to my local yarn store for a snack to share.

A recipe my mom used to make. Love it. Line the pan with foil and the spray with oil/butter. When they’ve completely cooledm=, put a big cutting board on top of the pan and flip over to turn them out. Then peel the foil off & cut. Easy!

These were good.  As some other reviewers said, it was a little greasy and the amount of butter could be cut back. I think 1/2 cup to 2/3 cup would probably be fine.  My bake time was also much longer with the second bake being almost 30 minutes.  The taste is good, not a lot of effort put into making them so overall a quick, tasty recipe.

I finally made this after weeks of putting it off and it’s so yummy! I didn’t have all purpose flour and I’m not sure if my brown rice flour is the reason it came out crumbly but even if so... I’m not disappointed. Ha, topped with ice cream lovely dessert.

Sorry, I made these and they were way too greasy.  I even took the entire baked batch and set it on a paper towel overnight to absorb the excess butter.   I won't be making these again.

We enjoyed these, but I was expecting the oatmeal mixture to be more "crumbly". It seemed like there was too much melted butter for a good crumble, so I think I'll cut back on the butter if I make these again. I didn't have any caramel ice cream topping on hand, so I justed melted some Kraft caramels in a glass bowl (skipping the flour) and used that for the caramel drizzle. These are very sweet - so if you have a sweet tooth like me, I'm sure you'll enjoy these!

These will be one of  recipes this year for Christmas goodies with modifications.  I agree that it needs to be 1/2 cup butter; not 3/4.  Softened butter; not melted.  It took a bit longer to bake but turned out to be very good.  They went quickly.

A favorite recipe for many years!   I've also made these using gluten-free flour for times when I've had guests with that dietary requirement -- they work just as well and are equally as delicious!

I looked up this recipe after I bought a carmelita bar for my friend at my local bakery and my friend raved that it was the best bar she's every had.  This recipe is awesome!   Buttery, brown sugar crumbly, caramel-choco chewy goodness.   I substituted with almond flour for a gluten-free option and the mixture was "wet" when it went into the oven and came out a little too moist to slice into bars.  It set up no problem after being in the refrigerator for a few hours and it resulted in a nice dense, chewy bar.  I did not add any flour to the caramel - I simply laid the chocolate chips and then poured the melted caramel on top before adding the top crumbly layer.  It is a great bar; really sweet, but with a cup of tea, it is perfect.

These are very good! Soft, gooey and rich. I used one stick of butter (1/2 cup) rather than 3/4 cup because it was easier and they are fine.  I baked them for 15 minutes as the recipe says and they came out great, a little crumbly on top. I might leave out the nuts next time due to personal preference.

Accidentally used a 8 by 8 pan.  They still turned out good.  My family enjoyed them and wants me to make them again for Christmas next year. However, I do think they will be better in the 9 by 9 pan!

I cannot rave about this recipe enough. I did make a couple minor changes, but without those changes I can guarantee the bars are just as delicious. My changes were 1 cup walnuts and 1 cup chocolate chips (half white half milk chocolate). WOW!!! :D

Made the recipe as is besides substituting half of the chocolate chips for butterscotch. Wish I would have only done chocolate. They're still delicious and I only baked the second time for 18 minutes (more than the recommended because of the reviews I read). Not sure why people are saying 30-40. Those couldn't be soft at all! I will definitely make these again but only use 1/2 cup caramel. It was a little overpowering to me. I baked the recipe in an 8x8 and glad I did - I like them a little thicker.

The taste was enjoyable but they were so difficult to eat because they just crumbled to pieces. We couldn't pick them up without using a spoon.  As a desert it's ok, but not as a bar cake. Also they were fairly fiddly to make. I wouldn't mind that if the outcome was good, but this didn't warrant the effort, in my opinion.

Couldn't get them out of the pan.
Husband finally cut them and he pried them out.
They tasted good but I will not make them again.!

These were great.  I did make one change.  I used Heath Bar Bits instead of chocolate chips.  Everyone raved about them.  Will definitely be making these again.  They are so easy, and so good.

Great!  I have been making a similar recipe for years; about the only difference is it called for caramel candies.  The caramel syrup is a lot faster than unwrapping  the candies.  Excellent!  Thank you!

These bars are rich! Make sure you have a tall glass of milk nearby! I let the butter sit out until it was so soft you could spread it. I also pressed the bottom  oatmeal mixture LIGHTLY. Result was a chewier cookie like texture, not crunchy. After adding the toppings, I baked it for 25 minutes rather than 15. The result was a crispier oatmeal topping that balanced out the base. I will definitely make this again! ??

These were delicious. I tried them two times. The first time they were a gooey tasty mess that we had to dig out of the pan with a spoon but were so yummy that I had to try them again. The second time  I made them I cooked them much longer, per reviews, and after they cooled to room temp (I never needed to refrigerate them) they cut perfectly and were great for days. I used softened butter ( not melted) and the crust was a bit tough on the bottom but no one minded. I had no problem with them being crumbly. I have another recipe that is almost exactly the same, but it calls for cutting in cold butter. I wonder if that would make a difference with the toughness. I had lined my 9x9 with foil and sprayed it to make removal easy and it worked perfectly. I added a full cup caramel. The chocolate I used was very high quality and it did seem to overpower the caramel a bit even with the full cup. They were great warmed up with Haagen Dazs, but we ate most of them plain. I made them the same time I made a batch of our favorite cookies and these went much faster. So rich that a small bite is all you need. Thank you for the recipe. I am sure I will make this again.

i tried this recipe twice, once with old fashiioned oats which produced a powdery crust. After reading reviews, I tried again with quick oats which yeilded a perfect crust.  I am very happy with this recipe and so is my family.

This is a good recipe, but I only give it four stars because I could not taste or even see the carmel sauce. I used my homemade caramel sauce (which is way better than store-bought!), and used the same amount that the recipe states, but we didn't even taste it once they're done, only the chocolate. I will be making this again, but probably doubling up on the caramel sauce.

I've made these about 10 times. I make them by switching from lower rack to upper rack so both layers cook evenly. This is great base recipe for 2 layer cookies. As long as you switch racks between layers you can make these kind of cookies as thick as you like and they will cook evenly and be soft in the middle.

This recipe is fool-proof....i actually messed up the first 2x i made it and everyone loved it just the same.  My version has one slight tweak -- add 1/4 cup regular oats to the remaining dough before you put over the top of the chocolate and caramel.  Adds a little texture and very yummy.  My teenage sons friends ask him for these for the birthdays.  I even had a teacher rig a class activity so that HE had to bring in the treat.....she specifically asked for these!  I let sit overnight before cutting, otherwise really gooey.

I can usually tell if I have a winner when I taste the dough, I can eat it like cookies.  :)  I was disappointed by this dough however, it seemed unspectacular and buttery.  Still, it looked fantastic and gooey and bubbly when I pulled it out of the oven (it took about 10 minutes longer than quoted to get golden) and I took the advice of several reviewers and let it cool before cutting.  I had a bite then, and thought it was ok.  Fast forward 7 hours-it's now past bedtime, everyone's asleep, and the flavors have had a chance to meld.  I cut another sliver and another and another and honestly, I think I've eaten half the dang pan, they're so good.

This is possibly one of the best cookie bars ever! It is so rich and delicious. I usually make dessert Sunday for the week. At the end of the week we either finish or throw out a few pieces of most desserts. This dessert only makes it until Wednesday. Thanks!

These are the most incredible bars. The flavors compliment each other very well.  My family and I love them.  My Husband actually ate two in one serving and that is very unusual considering they are so rich. Will be making these often.  If you haven't tried them you should, they are so delicious. Thank you Sharon for a fantastic recipe.

Yummy!! I didn't have caramel ice cream topping but used butterscotch instead - very rich. The only negative I had was the topping was too crumbly - it fell apart when cutting and eating. I will try a bit more butter and refrigerating the baked recipe first before cutting when I make these again.

I really liked this cookie but had problems cooking it.  After the first bake they were a little gooey.  After cookies were completly baked and cooled I ended up putting them in the fridge to harden them.  They slightly reminded me of Shelia's Dream Bar from PotBelly.

These were very good, but very, very sweet.  Don't get me wrong, I love sweet things...but even I have my limits!  They need to be cut into small portions to tolerate them.  My husband and I cut ourselves pieces that were about 2"x3" and they were too much to tolerate.  We both ate ours over the course of an entire day!  I used mini chocolate chips because I didn't want the chocolate to overpower the caramel, as one reviewer commented.  I love the crust and topping and will use it for my Fall apple crisp this year.  I'm not sure if I will make these again?  I agree that they taste better the next day.  Also, I had no trouble getting out of the pan after spraying with Pam.  Great recipe for caramel lovers!

These are so yummy! I love caramel & chocolate. Someone said they were bland, I don't get that. These remind me somewhat of Magic Cookie Bars. The main difference, being the coconut in the MCBs. Someone also, called them Goober Cookies. Goobers are peanuts, so maybe they originally had peanuts in them. I prefer the walnuts, in this recipe. The nuts & oatmeal actually give you something healthy. ha

I made these last night and refrigerated the pan until about 2 hours ago, just cut into them and they are AMAZING!!!  I followed Ruby's advice to double the recipe for a 9 x 13 pan...mother of God these are addictive and I'm not sure they'll make it to the potluck they are intended for (my husband keeps looking at me all doe-eyed wanting more).  The ONLY change I made was to use slivered almonds in place of the walnuts cuz I'm not a big fan of the walnut.  This is a definite keeper.

I always double this recipe.. it is fabuluous! I always double the chips and nuts... you can use pecans and they are great.  You really need to make these and let them cool, put them in the fridge for a while, and then cut.  I have much better luck with cutting this way.  Also, it is a lot of butter.  Just do it.  If you cut back they will be to crumbly.  Once they cool and set up they are GREAT!

These were very very good. I only doubled the crust/topping ingredients and added a whole jar of caramel ice cream topping while eyeing the chocolate. These came out more like a chewy cookie on the bottom/middle, mainly due to the caramel topping. I think I did add too much chocolate which took away from the caramel flavor. The top was a little disappointing because it was WAY too crumbly, but I'm sure that could be changed easily by incorpating the butter more. Overall, these were really chewy and chocolate-y, two things you can't go wrong with.

Really did not like these and I believe I followed the directions correctly.  The crust is soft, not hard, which is not terrible, but overall the taste is just not that great. I would have rather made chocolate chip cookies with the chocolate chips. These aren't horrible but wow are they overrated.

Good, but not great.  The cooking time was doubled to help make these bars firm.  The taste is similar to seven layer bars I make during the holidays which are a lot less work and taste better.

These were so yummy! It was a bit too sweet for me, but all my coworkers seemed to like it! The texture was awesome. Crispy topping, crunchy walnut and sweet carmel and chocolate. Mmmm! I think these were a bit less overwhelming when they've completely cooled, than when they were still warm. YUM!

These are really fantastic. I had to use a smaller pan than the recipe called for, so they came out a little thicker and I had to add about 10 minutes onto the baking time. These seem to "ripen" with time, as they taste richer and more complex after a few days compared to when they're fresh. I usually use the original recipe first to test it before I start modifying things (unless other reviewers report a common problem and what changes they make to fix it), so the recipe as is is -awesome-. Next time I'll be trying chopped up dark/white chocolate and almonds.

I used regular flavored instant oatmeal, and 1.25 sticks of softened (not melted) butter, and I baked it for about 20 mins, and it came out PERFECTLY. Right after I took it out of the oven the middle was still a little mushy, but I did let it cool before we cut into it, and the middle had firmed up very nicely. This recipe is FANTASTIC!

This gets 5 stars at our house.  I doubled the recipe and ended up baking it in a 19x13 for about 20 minutes.  This was great with a glass of milk:)  Will be making these again and again.

These are better the next day. The bottom got a little mushy/gewy but all in all they were very good. Different. Kinda like an oatmeal cookie with chocolate in the middle. I did not taste the carmel at all.

This came out fantastic-I can see where there is alot of room to experiment with this recipe too by using different chips, filling, etc...I used regular semi-sweet choclate chips but next time I might try white chocolate chips. very very good...

Following other reviewers' advice, I used softened butter.  Also, instead of using store bought caramel topping, I used the Butterscotch Ice Cream Topping from this web site.  It's simple to make (I made it at the same time I made the crust) and it was much better than anything you could buy.  Chilling helped it cup up nicely and was it ever good!  We'll be making this again.

This is my first rating and I have to rate it because these were very very yummy. I ate them warm and they were gooey.  They did take about 35 min instead of the 15. I changed nothing in the reciepe and added the butter warm and used normal quaker oats.

These are very tasty cookies.  I followed the recipe except that I omitted the nuts, cut the butter to 1/2 cup, and increased the second cooking time to about 24 minutes.  My husband and I wanted to eat them soon after I took them out of the oven, but they were still extremely gooey, so we used plates and forks.  I think that's the best way to eat them!  Just call it pie instead of cookies.  The second day, they had firmed up (although they still had a gooey layer in the middle), but we didn't think they were quite as good as when they were fresh from the oven.  They're very crumbly even after they set, so the plate is still necessary unless you eat outdoors (but I didn't try refrigerating as some reviewers suggested).

These were delicious, but I might have added less butter to the recipe had I realized how soft the crust and topping would be. I think next time I'll try adding the butter when it's still firm and cutting it in. Also, I used PB instead of the caramel topping since I didn't have any and the bars were good. But I'd note that if you're adding peanut butter to make sure to add the 3 T. of flour to it the same as you would if adding the caramel. Very good cookie--if pretty rich.

Very tasty recipe, not too sweet. I doubled the recipe and should have cut down on the butter.  It was literally pooling on top of the bottom layer after the pre-bake and I used a paper towel to get some of it off!  I followed suggestions and did not melt the butter.  I also used suger-free caramel topping because that was all they had at the store.  The doubled recipe cooked in 22 minutes in a glass dish.  It set very well and was easy to cut after cooling in the fridge.

Mine didn't turn out quite right. the oatmeal mixture wasn't crumbly like the recipe said. The flavor was awesome, however, and my husband loved that it was gooey and rich. It was even better the next day. Make sure you have lots of milk on hand before making this one!

Great! I couldn't stop eating it! Though next time I'll not add the full 3 Tbl of flour to the caramel. It made it so thick it wouldn't spread, so mine came out a little dry. It was still very, very good. Great party recipe!

So this isn't the recipe for you if you're like me and want your dessert like- right now! It doesn't set up right away.  I kept going by and picking off the oatmeal topping-delish! Then, I had to dig into a little corner just to test. I knew going in the caramel would have turned into molten lava, but oh my gosh! Worth the tongue burn!  It took all my will power not to just dig into the whole thing with a spoon (forget the work pitch-in!) However, I did restrain myself and once they cooled, the texture was much better and it was easier to eat. I, too, would decrease the chocolate a bit. Never thought I'd say that! I think I might try peanuts and/or peanut butter next time. Thanks for the recipe! AWESOME!

Wow!!! these really are delicious, I only have one comment, and you chocolate lovers are going to hate me, cant we cut the chocolate a bit, I think it overpowers the rest of the flavors, I am going to just add a little less next time. I wonder how they are even without!! But they are tasty little buggers as my Grandma would say.

These are SO good.  The only change I made was to bake them an extra 10 minutes.  We ate them with a scoop of vanilla ice cream for an extra special treat.

Wow, these are delicious!  I had to use an 8x8 pan instead of the 9x9, so they were a little wet in the middle when I took them out, but beginning to crisp around the edges. After two hours (and some refrigeration to speed up the process) they firmed up enought to cut into nice squrares.  Taste good!

This was exactly what I was craving. It was so rich that just a little bite is perfect. The carmel, oats, and nuts are a perfect combination, but the chocolate sends this recipe over the top. I would suggest making the full recipe as I halved it and it did not work as well as a full one probably would have.

Wow!  What a fantastic recipe!  These delicious bars are good for any occasion but just make sure you make enough of them!  I always double this recipe and bake them in a 9 by 13 in pan and bake at 350 degrees for 25 minutes (in addition to the 10 minutes of pre baking).  The mixture will still be a little soupy in the middle but it will firm up when it cools and then-watch out!  They will disappear before you eyes!!  AAA++++

This was a great recipe, however, I think the next time I will cut out the salt.  I think the salted butter is enough.  As an added treat, I served them warm with vanilla ice-cream!  My guests couldn't stop saying, "WOW!"

I loved these. They have the perfect amount of sweetness and they have so many amazing textures. These were gone within one day. I followed the recipe exactly and do not plan on changing it any the next time that I make it. These did not take long to make either but they look like they took forever. This is a recipe that I will be making again and again.

I had to make this twice in one week as the girls I work with LOVED it!! I didn't mess with mixing the caramel with flour - seemed like to much work. I just drizzled it straight from the bottle - didn't even measure - until the crust looked covered. I also added vanilla to the oat mixture. Delish!!!

I made these for a dinner/dessert party tonight and they were a hit! The theme was decadent desserts and I needed to make two desserts. I am not a baker so I bought one dessert and made these. While I don't know if these qualify as "decadent" they are most definitly delicious. 
I had three people say to me, or I overheard them saying to others, that these oatment carmelitas were incredible.  By the end of the night I had four requests for the recipe and people were fighting for the last piece.
I had to promise two friends that I would make these for future dinner parties.
I doubled the recipe and cooked the first layer for 10 minutes (I just didn't think about cooking it longer) and cooked the whole thing for 25 additional minutes. They turned out slightly gooey and wonderful. 
Thanks for sharing this great recipe.

These are sinfully delicious. I've had to use some serious restraint to not eat the whole batch :D I baked them for 25 minutes (without checking up on them) assuming mine would need some extra cooking like a lot of other members, and ended up just slightly overcooking them, so they were a bit harder then I would prefer. Next time I'll bake for 15-20 minutes and I know they'll be just perfect. I

Great, but was a little dry and flaky. Were I to make it again, I would put more butter/flour in the crust. I do not know what proportions I would use, though. Delicious regardless!!

Yummy! These are brilliant! Some tips though... Don't expect to eat them right away, they will fall apart. And I think some cinnamon would really make these amazing! Haven't tried it yet though!

I made these for my office party and they got good reviews.  My only complaint is that they are so thick...I think I would do them in a 9x13 pan next time. This way you can get more squares and they aren't quite as rich. I also used almond extract in crust, and I think it added a very nice flavor. Overall, good (fairly easy) recipe to have on hand.  Thanks!

I feel so fat...I made these bars and almost ate the whole batch. I made the recipe for Boss Appreciation Day, and I must admit I ate 1/4 of the batch before I got to work. Everyone at work loved them and I sent out the recipe to fellow co-workers.

Update: 9 years later, I made these again in my mid-thirties, and I still feel fat, but feel as if this is just a chocolate/carmel cobbler not as much cookie bar action going as I would like. I think I'll move on to a new recipe in the future.

May I just saw WOW?!?!!  This was incredibly awesome!  I did one thing different.  I used individually wrapped caramels and melted them over a low heat with some milk.  I didn't have caramel topping and it worked wonderfully!  YUM YUM YUM!  :-)

These turned out perfectly, with no changes to the recipe (except the omission of the chopped nuts).  Sent them to work with my fiance, and he reported back that these little gems got rave reviews.  I recommend cutting them into small squares, as they're very rich.

Great recipe!  Couldn't get enough of these.  I did not melt the butter, I just softened it.  Also, for the crumb topping I added more flour, a tad more salt, and oats.  I liked that consitency better and will make it that way the next time.

The pre-baked crust alone I couldn't get enough of.  I used as much caramel and chips as I liked and it turned out delicious!

All I can say is that these came out simply delicious! My guests loved them! 
I did substitute the walnuts with Almonds due to an allergy to walnuts. 
Overall this is a recipe I will definitely keep and make again.

I left out the nuts, but they are still scrumptious!

I made this recipe for my cousin when he was recovering, but I had to stop myself from eating the entire batch. Everyone agreed that they were so delicious!!

Wow! I baked these oatmeal carmelitas (following the recipe exactly) for my graduate student colleagues, and they raved!!! I will most certainly make these again for parties, pot luck dinners etc. Easy and delicious...

These were quite yummy.  Very rich and I agree that they are better the next day. Our church serves at a soup kitchen every month and we send cookies.  I'm sure these were a welcome difference.

I'm not usually a huge fan of oatmeal baked goods or nuts, but these were fabulous. I made them for a dinner series I'm catering, not expecting to like them all that much, and I couldn't keep my hands off them! I had to make another batch for my family. The first time I doubled the recipe and baked it in a 9 x 13 pan. It worked out very well. The second time, using the recipe as written, it didn't seem to come out quite as well, but who knows why? They still got devoured! These are now in my dessert rotation.

I took these camping with friends this past weekend and they were gone in a flash.  I used a 8x8 pan, milk chocolate chips and left out the walnuts.  Sweet and decadent.  The perfect treat!

It doesn't get much better than this!  I did however omit the walnuts (just not a fan of them).  This is a regular request from my kids!
