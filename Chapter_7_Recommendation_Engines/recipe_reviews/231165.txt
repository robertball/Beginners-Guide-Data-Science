Ever since I saw this on Man Vs Food I wanted to try this. I used turkey sausage and a morningstar patty beecause that was what I had in the freezer and shredded mozz because I couldnt quite bring myself to buy processed cheese. On Man vs food they grilled the sandwich so I did the same... glazed side inside the sandwich to save the glaze and make it a little neater. It was an interesting sandwich.. I liked the play between sweet and savory

I liked everything about the recipe except for the doughnut.  I made it again and used an english muffin. It was more to my liking and my health.

It was so delicious! The only thing is my brother said when tried it is to put the glazed side on the inside if the sandwich so your fingers don't get too much glaze on them.

I took some liberties with this recipe since I didn't have all the called-for ingredients, but I really wanted to make this sandwich. I think the recipe as written is a little awkward--too much milk in the scrambled egg and the steps seem out of order to me. However, I think the whole idea of this breakfast treat is what's important, and I loved it! I used a blueberry cake doughnut (which tasted great), fried my egg and used two strips of bacon instead of sausage. I'm sure I'll try this again with day old doughnuts.

I LOVED this! I didn't add anything to the eggs, just scrambled them plain and cooked them. Put that in between the donut 1/2's along w/ the sausage and cheese. Great sweet/savory flavor combination...will def make this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Breakfast heaven is right. I made a fried instead of a scrambled egg so that the yolk would soak into the doughnut. OMG. This is good.

Five stars according to my imagination. Forget the fat and sugar load, as much as I wanted one(or seven), I just couldn't!  Howevern this gives me a chance to clear something up. Processed cheese and American cheese, are not the same thing. Processed cheese MUST be labled as such. American cheese is not a processed food unless it is labled as such. Velveeta is the most widely used processed stuff, and sometimes mac 'n cheese just isn't the creamy, delish stuff our taste buds crave crave without it as part of the recipe. So relax and enjoy the EU citizens' imported cheese!

When you want sweet plus your eggs and bacon/and or sausage in a sandwich, this hits the spot. I would not recommend this daily but as a special breakfast treat.

I made this as writen but grilled the donut.  The instructions didn't say to do that but the picture of it look like it had been grilled in the pan. I grilled the inside first to get it a little crispy assembled the sandwich and then grilled it to help melt the cheese.  Mixing the egg in the measuring cup before microwaving makes it a perfect circle for the donut.  However, when I make it again I will use a fried egg. Just a personal preference. In spite of the bacon and sausage the egg still needed a little salt.  This is a very easy, delicious and quick substantial breakfast.

My daughter is a nurse & works 7PM to 7AM in a VERY busy ER . Made this for her to take to work & she LOVED them - a little sugar & lots of protein.  They keep her going & she runs off the calories while working.

I made this for my grandkids last year but with frosted donut bacon eggs n cheese they loved it that we called it a donut egg, bacon, cheese sandwich.

I liked this recipe.. however the recipe didn't say to cook the doughnut but I cut it in half and put it in the pan cut side down with some margarine then made the sandwich glazed side on the inside, I would reccomend using toothpicks to keep everything together.

This was definitely a clever idea. It doesn't have much flavor, I would highly recommend seasoning the eggs and sausage!
