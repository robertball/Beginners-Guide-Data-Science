Wonderful!  I've made this twice now, making a lot of the changes suggested in the other reviews.  Both times, I baked the squash first, just putting the whole thing in the oven at 375 for about an hour.  The skin just peels itself off!  Very easy.  I also left out the celery both times.

The first time, I replaced the potatoes with sweet potatoes and added some garlic and a pinch of curry powder.  It was absolutely delicious and very hearty served with a big dollop of sour cream (the sour cream is a MUST).

The second time, I made it just with butternut squash (no carrots, no potatoes) and it was even better.  I added some cayenne powder for heat and a little nutmeg.  I mixed the sour cream  right into the soup this time - I'll definitely make this again.

Delicious and easy to prepare.  Others have mentioned a long prep time. This is simplified by NOT dicing the raw butternut squash.  The easiest way to prepare butternut squash is to pierce it with a fork and bake it, whole, at 400F for one hour.  Let cool, then halve lengthwise and remove the seeds.  The flesh scoops out easily with a spoon.  No cutting or dicing required.

This recipe is very, very bland.. however it is salvagable. Here's what you do: 1- use only one potato, if you use two it takes away from the squash. 2- add 1/2 tsp cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg. 3- add 1 T minced garlic. 4- Add 1/4 cup captain morgan's spiced rum. 5- add 1/2 c half-half. 
I personally found the recipe tasted better with a little bit of parmesan cheese and some italian seasonings. Serve with a dollop of sour cream and some crumbled bacon.
I strongly recommend making these changes or others, otherwise this recipe is WAY too bland.

Fantastic. We love it with the addition of a clove of garlic and a pinch of curry powder (which doesn't make it taste like curry, it just brings out the other flavors -- I stole this tip from a 5 star restaurant). The celery adds wonderful flavor; I wouldn't omit that as others suggest. I use a hand blender (the kind that looks like a wand) to blend it right in the pot so there's no messy transfer or blender to clean. If you purée soups often the hand blender is very useful.

Very yummy and I will be making this again and again! I always scour the ratings before trying a recipe.  I always end up finding some very useful tips that perfect the outcome of a recipe. The following advice from other reviews were very helpful:
1. Use 1 potato, omit the potato all together, or add sweet potato instead.
2. For easy dicing, roast the butternut squash in a 400 degree oven for one hour, turning it every 15 minutes.
2. For a more flavorful soup, Add 1-2 cloves of fresh minced garlic, a 1/2 tsp of curry, a 1/4 tsp of cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg.
3. Add another 1/2 cup of broth for a thinner consistency after you puree it (but, you be the judge of that).
4.  Pureeing it gives it a texture similar to baby food, so you may want to leave some chunks in the soup. 
Lastly, If you love squash, you HAVE to try this soup.  My husband was looking for the leftovers the next day and called me a "dirty dog" for sending them home with my son.  I regret doing that as well!

I had never eaten butternut squash so I did not know what to expect.  I thought I had wasted all those ingredients, it was that tasteless.  So I added spices red pepper flakes and some steamed broccoli......Still found it lacking. Then I added some sour cream. OMG, that was the secret. Really good. So I gave it 4 stars because it was, after all, a very good base. I plan to freeze some and see how that does. (7/18/07) After freezing this soup I decided that, although it was better fresh, it was still one of the recipes I will add to my list of foods I can freeze.(10/04/07) Don't bother to bake the squash. Cut it in half, remove seeds and pulp, place it in a dish, cut side down, with 1/2 inch of water and microwave for 12 to 15 minutes. Works very well!

This soup was one of the best soups I ever made.  So simple, low fat and tastes incredible!  I wouldn't use the celery again, because it didn't puree properly and was somewhat stringly, but other than that, this recipe is outstanding.

This is a delicious and super EASY soup! I chopped all the vegetables and tosed them into the low fat chicken stock (thus avoided the extras calories by not browning them first!) and when the vegetables were fork tender I pureed the vegetables!  Served with a dollop of low fat sour cream and slivers of red pepper and viola!  This recipe is the most asked for one this past year 2005!

Excellent!  I recommend blending only half of it and leaving the other half chunky to give it some texture.  Definitely perfect for a fall dinner on a cold night!

Great recipe!  I didn't brown the vegetables - I didn't use butter at all and didn't miss it.  I did not use celery and used one regular potato and one sweet potato.  I think next time I'll just use the sweet potatoes - would add extra flavor.  I added a bit of red pepper for some spice.  I put a drop of low fat sour cream on each serving - delicious!  Will definitely make again!

Loved it!  Wish there was an easy way to peel the squash tho'.  Has anyone made it using squash that had been baked beforehand?  Even our picky-eating boys ate this one!  Very healthy, too.

I've been making this recipe every winter for 3 years. It's so wonderful. It has actually become a Thanksgiving appetizer for us due to an overwhelming amount of people in my very large extended family who just love it.  It's probably been the most requested item since we incorporated it into our T-day menu.  The only changes I make are the way I cook the squash and I only add 1 potato, no carrots, no celery and I add an apple. I also add a bit of cayenne pepper.  This is how I cook my butternut squash and it is SO delicious:  cut the squash in half and remove seeds/stringy stuff, liberally coat each side with olive oil salt and pepper, cut two cloves of garlic into thin slices and place a clove into the cavity of each butternut squash side, roast cut side down in an 350 degree oven for 45min - 1 hour or until squash is very tender. Once squash is cool enough to handle, scoop out flesh with a spoon - it will come out VERY easily.  I add the cooked squash in after I add the stock.  I also very thinly slice my onions, potatoes and apple so that everything cooks quickly. I never have to simmer mine for 40 minutes. More like 20.

OMG.  SO good.  And, good for you.  Final review after several batches: use low-sodium chicken broth; buy medium/large butternut squash, split it into two, used a grapefruit spoon to remove the seeds and pulp, and microwaved for about 15-25 minutes in a dish with 1/2 inch of water in order to soften; instead of using 2 potatoes, use 1 small sweet potato; instead of using a stalk of celery, use 1 tsp. of celery seed.  Definitely spice it up: 1/2 tsp. nutmeg, 1/2 tsp. curry, and spoonful of garlic prior to simmering the soup.  Finally, when blending, add 1/2 cup of fat-free half-n-half to make the soup creamy.  DO NOT OVERBLEND.  Also, this soup MUST be topped with sour cream - it is what makes the soup.  Might also try green onion or bacon crumbles for garnish next time.

The best butternut squash soup recipe...I only gave it 4 stars because I felt it needed a bit more flavor so I added some garlic, red pepper, fresh nutmeg and browned some chicken and apple sausage that I added after blending the soup. With the sausage even my boyfriend loved it and he isn't much of a soup eater.

Excellent recipe!  You can mix this up in a variety of ways to get different flavors.  I cut the squash in half (you can microwave to soften first...or simply microwave to cook, but I like the flavor that roasting adds to the squash)...oil,salt and pepper the squash & place cut side down on a foil-lined pan. I also roasted 2 sweet potatos, 3 onions, and one head of garlic while the squash was roasting.  Wash the potatos, rub with olive oil, and wrap loosely in foil. Cut the ends off and peel the outer layer of the onions; place in foil and drizzle with Olive oil, pepper; I sealed the foil and placed on baking tray...Cut off the top of the garlic, drizzle with oil, and wrap in foil.  Place veggies in the oven and roast with the squash.  Garlic takes about 45 min; onions and sweet potatos will take 45-1 hr depending on temp and oven..

Bake the squash until tender (60-90 min depending on size and oven)...  The squash "meat" should be soft and juicy....
While squash is cooling, saute fresh carrots, celery, onion in olive oil about 10 minutes...add veggie  or chix stock; continue to simmer until very tender.

I then pureed all of the roasted veggies (squeeze garlic cloves out...should be like butter). Add some additional stock, and pour into soup pot...continue to puree sauteed veggie and squash; add stock to reach desired consistency.  Add pepper and nutmeg to taste.  I then added dashes of PENZEY's cumin, cayenne pepper, and sweet curry and Maharajah curry...  very TASTY!

I have to disagree with the submitter that this soup has “tons of flavor.” Prepared following the recipe as written I found this actually lacking flavor, a little flat, until I tinkered with it and gave it a little more character.   To begin with, I did not use the potato as I wanted it a little more low-carb friendly (and I don't think I would have cared for it in the soup anyway).  Rather than cooking the vegetables in butter, I cooked some diced bacon, removed it and set it aside, then cooked the vegetables in the bacon fat along with some fresh minced garlic.  The bacon contributed its great flavor, however, it needed something – a pinch of dry, rubbed sage and a splash of dry white wine gave the soup the complexity and depth it needed.  After simmering and blending the soup a good glug of heavy cream (half and half would have been fine too) turned this into something rich, creamy and luxurious.  A simple garnish of the reserved cooked bacon (a fresh sage leaf would have been pretty) was all it needed to dress it up.  Three stars as written for a basic recipe, four stars with some fine-tuning.

Excellent soup! I used olive oil instead of butter to cut on fat. I also added some garlic, a dash of curry powder and only added 1 potato because I'm watching my carbohydrates intake. As suggested by other reviewers I baked the whole butternut squash at 375 degrees for 1 hour, it does make it so easy. It turned out so creamy and rich, but with no addition of any fat or dairy. I will definitely make this soup again. Thanks for sharing this great recipe, Maplebird!

This is a nice soup!  It is great on a cold winter's afternoon or evening!  The one thing I like to add to it is about a tablespoon of fresh grated ginger and maybe a half cup of apple juice.  The apple juice adds some complexity to the sweetness and the ginger adds a zing to the recipe and a little heat on the tongue and compliments the sweetness of the squash perfectly.

This was my first attempt at a squash soup.  We got nailed with 20 inches of snow the last two days, so I figured it was a good day to experiment.

I followed the recipe as it was written with these additions:

1 reg potato/1 sweet potato
1 full head of roasted garlic - roasted in olive oil for 40 minutes
4 oz Light Cream Cheese
2 12 oz Packages of Frozen Cooked Winter Squash instead of peeling, seeding and cooking a butternut squash.

This was fabulous.  Topped it with Garlic/Cheese Croutons and a dab of sour cream.  Made some corn muffins to make a complete meal, enjoyed sitting in front of the fireplace.

This is so yummy!!!! I did make changes because of personal preference based on other reviews. Less Cream cheese, 1/4 cup brown sugar & chicken stock. Used a stick blender to save time. Thank you so much for such a wonderful recipe.

Incredible!  Tastes like a rich cream based soup but is relatively healthy.  I followed directions and just barely covered cubed veggies in chicken broth.  It used probably 3/4 of the chicken stock and by the time I was done there was no need to add any more - once blended the consistency was perfect.  Remember - don't dump in all your stock right from the get-go.

Great soup after spicing it up for the wife and her Weight Watchers® diet. Microwave squash as previously suggested in reviews.  Added 1/8 tsp each All Spice, Ginger, Nutmeg, Cinnamon , about a ¼ cup of Craisens® and zest from ½ an orange. Right at the end off cooking and before serving I added 3 TBSP fat free sour cream and 3TBSP I Can’t Believe Its Not Butter®.

I never reviewed a recipe before, but this one was so good, I had to. I left out the potatoes to lower the carbs. I used a low fat butter substitute, and added about a cup of 2% milk to make it creamier and a dash of cayenne pepper for a little kick. Served it at a dinner party with fresh corn bread. It was a huge hit!!! Healthy & DELICIOUS!! Thanks for the recipe!!

I had this at a friends house one time and was looking for it again but didn't want anything to complicated. This was PERFECT.  It's very autumny!  I served it with some parmesan and garlic croutons which was delicious.  My friend served it with shreaded monerey jack cheese that nicely melted on the top...that was perfection.

Update:  This is my most asked for soup but I won't make it until October. I bought a soup toureen to serve it in for a presentation as great as the soup!

I thought this recipe was great but the initial product seemed a bit bland to the rest of the family so I improvised the second time and it came out FANTASTIC!!  I used one large sweet potato instead of the regular potato. Before I blended I added 1/4 cup cream cheese.  Once I blended the ingrediants I put them back into the pot and added 1/2 teaspoon cloves, 1/2 teaspoon ginger, and a pinch of nutmeg and cayenne pepper.  Then I added a 1/2 cup of brown suger. It was a 5 with my additions.

Easy, tasty, and versitile!  Just microwave the squash in a bowl of water until soft, let it cool, scoop out the seeds and soup is on the way!  We've made it several times and used some of the suggested ingredients (never the celery though).  Our favorite spices to add ...nutmeg, cloves, ginger, cinnamon, red pepper, garlic...to the degree of your liking of course.  And top off the soup with some Parmesan Cheese!  YUM!

This was a good basic recipe.  I tried to make the original version, but I didn't have any celery so I omitted it.  I roasted my butternut squash (without adding water to the pan) at 350 degrees for an hour instead of dicing it up.  This made it easier to handle.  The soup was bland so I made a few additions.  

I noticed how some reviewers used cinnamon or nutmeg, while others used curry.  I was apprehensive about which one, so I added a little nutmeg to a sample and didn't like it.  It made the soup taste on the order of sweet potato pie batter.  I opted to use a little curry and a little ground cayenne pepper instead because it gave it a more rustic taste - and more on the order of dinner.

I will make this dish again, with modifications.  Hope this helps.

This was great! Just as flavorful and buttery as a cream soup, without the fat. My husband didn't think he would like a squash soup, but he said it was delicious. I cooked it in my crockpot for 3 hours on high. I will probably make this for my company potluck in a few weeks.

This will become a favorite staple soup recipe for fall for me.    I doubled the quantity, except the potatoes,  and added 1 tsp curry, 2 cloves garlic, one bay leaf, and parsley flakes.   It is outstanding---a rich flavor like no other soup!

Mmmm.  I roasted the squash in the oven, omitted the butter, and used seasoned chicken broth to add some kick.  Topping the soup with Montery Jack cheese and garlic croutons added to the presentation and taste.

I roasted my squash first and then proceeded with the recipe. I left out the potatoes and added browned turkey sausage and more seasonings. Delicious!

I'm always nervous to make a recipe when people give it a good rating only after they've made their own changes. But this time, I made this soup exactly the way the original recipe said (except I had no celery so I had to leave that out) and it came out so great!! It definitely wasn't bland- If you use chicken stock to cook the vegetables I can't imagine why it would come out bland. I blended it with an immersion blender and it's a beautiful color, a great silky and hearty texture, and has a wonderful rich flavor! All in all very happy with the way this soup turned out :) Will definitely make again!

I made butternut squash soup for the first time using this recipe and the results were excellent. I did not use butter as I always cook with olive oil and the taste was incredible. I also added some nutmeg for extra flavor. This soup is so rich with taste, its a complete nutritious meal. Thank you for this healthy and satisfying recipe.

Really good on a cold nite but I too thought it needed the sour cream or something to make it a 5.  For ease in cooking I microwaved the squash and potatoes, peeled, and put in blender. Really a different soup for us but we liked it.

Waaay too much broth to add! I followed this recipe exactly and the stock overpowered everything and made it completely watered down. I even tried adding pumpkin to thicken it up and it still was too much. So disappointed. Wasted a lot of ingredients!

i gave this recipe 5 stars because it is a really good base to work with. i made it just the way it says, with all the ingredients it says. i only added a few things. i roasted the squash so it would not soak up water, i also roasted on the same pan of the squash a whole head of garlic, i added chopped sweet potatoes and did put in the celery, just make sure to chop it small. did not add sour cream at all, it would change the flavor completley. at the end i add a little sage. we sprinkled a little red pepper on top in our bowels. turned out fantastic.

This soup was enjoyed by everyone during our Thanksgiving meal.  It was easy and quick to make, once I had homemade chicken broth prepared.  I didn't have time to blenderize the soup, so instead I just mashed it with a potato masher.  Everyone liked the texture of the soup instead of a thick liquid from the blender.  I added a pinch of cinnamon and nutmeg, which added a nice fall flavor.  I'll definitely make this recipe again.

This was a delicious soup. It's not everyday you can say "that soup was so good, it brought my father-in-law to tears!" I kid you not, he kissed my hand he liked it so much! And my husband and MIL loved it too!

For those who might be cooking with butternut squash for the first time, I'll impart some knowledge my aunt passed on to me: if you find peeling raw squash too hard, cut them in chunks and toss it in the broth to boil until it's time to blend them all together. Just pick the now soft squash pieces and use a fork or knife to pick the peel off. And voila! It's much easier and you have less chances of hurting a finger :)

Add a bit of ginger to finished soup.  I cook the squash by cutting it in half lengthwise, scrape out the seeds.  Place face down on a baking sheet covered with aluminum foil and bake at 350dg until tender.

Since I tweaked this a bit, it's four stars - but with the changes it's a five star recipe.  

I baked the squash first (cut in half,rubbed with butter, face down, one hour at 375F).

I omitted the potatoes, added some fresh garlic and ground nutmeg.  I used a splash of half-and-half cream mixed in at the end.  It was so delicious!

Okay, I can't give it all the stars because I made so many changes, but this is an amazing recipe!  I omitted the carrot and celery and only used a touch of onion.  I also the replaced the potato with sweet potato.  And I added 1/4 cup sour cream before blending...yum!!

This is a great soup recipe. I did bake the whole squash at 400 degrees for 1 hour. I did not use the potatoes, carrots or celery, as they were really unnecessary. I added a sprinkle of cayenne as well as nutmeg and cumin. Fantastic! Sour cream was a great finish. My husband loved it with crusty bread.

Butternut squash is the most flavorful  and this recipe reflects that. I used our own squash,onions and potatoes from our garden and used carrots from the farmers market. I too left out the celery. I used white pepper, and just a dash of nutmeg. This recipe lets the squash be the star. I used an electric puree mixer (boat motor) right in the pot it was cooking in so I wouldn't have to make a mess transferring it into a blender.

This soup is delicious!  It was so good that I decided to serve it to my Thanksgiving guests and they all loved it-even my brother who doesn't like squash.  The only thing I changed was leaving out the potato.

I agree that roasting the squash first is a great idea, but found that 375F for 1 hour wasn't quite long enough to make peeling them "easy".  I would probably leave them in for another 15 or 20 minutes next time.  I also added 2 cloves of minced garlic to the soup, which rounded out the overall flavour.  Delicious!

This recipe is easy to do and it taste delicious. when I did this recipe I did not have much time so here is what I did.  1) I cook the raw onion and peeled cubed buttersquash in a pan with olive oil. I cooked this mixture until squash was golden brown. 2) I place this and potatoes in a pressure cooker along with a pinch of curry powder to bring out the flavors and then added chicken stock and 1tbsp of butter. Cooked for about 7 minutes and it is done! you can either blend it or smash it depending on the consistency you need. Add pepper and salt to taste.

Excellent recipe to make ahead of time and serve on that special day. Warms you from the inside out and has a wonderfull bouquet of flavors! Definately a keeper in my house. The third time I made this I used just chicken broth and it turned out great as well. I trippled the recipe every time I made it and my younger children gobbled it right up :)

Great! Really straightforward, simple, and easy!! I do agree with the bake the squash in the oven at 400 for about an hour, as mentioned beforehand. That drastically reduces the prep time in working with the squash

Followed the recipe with a few changes.. first I roasted the squash for 50 minutes at 350 degrees. I then was able to complete the recipe as written. When finished, I added half and half to give a bit more of a creamy texture. The soup is delicious! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

This was really terrific!  Our garden has produced an over-abundance of butternuts this year.  I love squash soup but wanted to try something different.  This is the best recipe yet.  I am usually a creative cook, but used this recipe almost exactly, with the exception of the celery, although I did add a few celery leaves.  Peeling the squash is a pain, so I baked it for one hour and it was perfect and soooooo simple to peel then.  I am having a large gathtering next month and will make this recipe for a starter.......am sure all will enjoy!   oh, don't forget the dollap of sour cream!

This was delicious!  I used 1 sweet potato instead of the 2 regular potatoes, and I only had baby carrots on hand, so I used about a dozen of them.  I split the squash in half lengthwise, scooped out the inside, sprayed it with canola oil, and baked it cut-side down for 30 minutes in a 375 degree oven.  I used Smart Balance Light Margarine (which is dairy-free) instead of butter (has half the calories & fat of butter too!) to sizzle up the vegetables, and Better than Boulion No-Chicken base instead of chicken broth.  With those two changes, it became completely Vegan!  (like me)  Since the squash was pre-cooked, after I sizzled the vegetables, I threw in two bay leaves, and covered and simmered for only 15 minutes.  I blended it with a stick blender in the pot, then threw in a pinch each of cayenne pepper, sage, and french thyme.  It was great, my family loved it!  Next time I think I may puree only part of the soup, as the texture once it was all blended came out a tad baby-food-like.

omg it was soooo good, and my husband LOVED it. It was very flavorful and tastey. I did a few changes I cut the squash in half and wrapped in paper towel and microwaved for about 5 minutes and the insides were tender enough to scoop out and add to the pot. Also omitted the celery. It was very easy to make!

My husband who swears up and down he hates squash, just loved this recipe. I baked the squash in the oven for an hour before hand, substitued one sweet potato and served with sour cream, just like everyone suggested, and it was fabulous. The recipie made a lot, so get ready to freeze leftovers!

This recipe makes a great creamy soup without the cream!  I substituted veggie oil for the butter to make it completely dairy free for allergic kids.  Quick, easy, delicious - what more could you ask for?

This is a truly great soup and nice recipe EXCEPT way too much work.  It can be more simply made by skipping the peeling step altogether!  Who has time for THAT?!  Cut the squash lengthwise and put it face down in a glass casserole.  Put it in the oven for about 40 minutes at 350 degrees, depending on the size and thickness of the squash.  When done simply SCOOP out the meat and continue recipe as written! Delicious.  I also believe you will get more nutrients because you are able to scoop closer to the skin than if you peel.  If you are adding potato do the same with the that.  I would also add a little Cajun seasoning so it's not so bland.

What a wonderful recipe .... I used only 1 potato and added some Montreal Steak Seasoning for the pepper.  I liked the fact there was no added milk product ... I loved the consistency as given.  YUM!

Awesome recipe!!! With that being said I did tweak it a little, as I do all my cooking lol.  I added 2 cloves minced garlic, just one potato instead of two, a little extra chicken boullion, a dash of cinnamon, curry, nutmet & basil.  Also just before I pureed I added 1 pkg (8 0z.) cream cheese (can also use reduced fat) and stirred well until mixed thoroughly, then put into blender.  Oh and definetely top with crisp bacon and sour creme, AMAZING!!!

Very good.  Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because, as others said, it would be very bland had I not added add'l spices.  On the suggestions of others I added:  garlic, garlic salt, curry, nutmeg & cinnamon.  I also pre-cooked the squash in the oven and added it to the last 5 min of cooking the vegetables.  Would definitely make this again.

Thanks to the advice of other reviewers, I brought this soup up to 5-star level. I don't even usually LIKE soups!

I roasted the squash in the oven at 375 for about an hour, let it cool, removed the seeds, and scooped the flesh into the pot.  I also omitted the carrot, celery, and potatoes, and added a clove of minced garlic.  I added a dash of nutmeg, cayenne, and cinnamon to the onion/garlic mixture, and (accidentally!) added ALL of the stock to the vegetables before simmering for 50 minutes.  Olive oil was also used in the place of butter.

I pureed the soup with my immersion blender once it was nice and soft.  I ladled it into the bowl and drizzled with cream and seasoned with a bit of pepper.  FANTASTIC!

(Note: my roommate has a dairy allergy and ate it without cream.  She also enjoyed it, and didn't consider it to be bland.)

I will make this again and again.  But next time I will not saute the veggie in butter, I think that was a waste of time and calories from the butter.  Also I cut off the peel of the raw squash and cubed it b/c I didn't read the reviews of others first.  So next time I'll try cooking it first and adding some seasoning.  But over all i loved this soup.

Delicious!!  I don't even like butternut squash and have tried a couple other recipes from this site, but didn't like them.  Since this has other veggies it cuts the squashy taste.  It's a great way to get my 2 year old to eat her veggies :)

A yummy and delicious recipe and a definite keeper!  Thanks for sharing it!  

I did change the butter to olive oil so it would be a parave soup to serve with meat.  I've also used sweet potatoes when I didn't have plain potatoes and that was even better.

Delicious and easy! I love that I had all the ingredients on hand. I followed the advice of those who said to cook the squash beforehand, add garlic, and only puree half of it to leave it a little chunky. I also included some parsley, seasoned salt, cinnamon (surprisingly really good!), and cooked chicken to make it a complete meal. Turned out great and my husband asked me to make it again!

WOW! This soup is incredible. I listened to other reviewers, and cooked the squash in the oven at 400 for an hour, which did make the peeling/seeding easy. The only other adjustments I made were substituting a sweet potato for the regular potatoes and a non-dairy margarine for the butter. I was a little worried, as the chicken smell was very strong while the soup was cooking, and I was nervous the soup would end up tasting like a veggie-chicken soup. But luckily I was wrong! The smell cleared afterwards and no chicken taste. Five stars all the way, I will definitely be making this again!!!

Needs the 1/2 tsp cinnamon, dash of nutmeg, a splash of brandy, and pepper to taste.  Sour cream at the end rounds it out.

I love this soup! Made it twice in one week! i used a TBSP of olive oil instead of butter.  I also microwave the squash first...much easier.  I don't puree it at all, but leave it chunky.  I also add curry powder and garlic powder. mmmmm

Mine had an overpowering potato taste. I did a quick fix by adding some brown sugar and apricot preserves to add the hint of sweetness I was expecting from the squash. We had this as a side to pork steaks. On my own bowl I also chopped up my meat and added it to my soup.

I like this soup but I changed a few things because of others comments.  I used a small sweet potato from my garden instead of carrots, cooked the celery and onion in butter, but didn't use potatos.  I put the squash in the microwave for 4 minutes on high to make it easier to peel and split, then after peeling and splitting put it in a container with a small amount of water and microwaved it on high for 15 minutes, cut it into cubes and added it to the onion, celery and sweet potato in a large pot, covered it with chicken broth, seasoned it with salt and a pinch of curry,  and after bringing it to a boil let it simmer until the veggies were tender, about 30 minutes.  I took out some of the squash pieces before blending the rest of the mixture, then added back the pieces before serving and adding a dollop of sour cream  to each bowl.  The sour cream really brought out the flavor, but a small amount of cream would probably do the same thing.  Will make this again, it was delicious.

Wonderful!  I made this recipe as written the first time and it was quite tasty.  The second time and ever since, I have roasted the squash beforehand and sauteed a clove of minced garlic with the rest of the vegetables, a pinch of curry powder and ground cayenne pepper added before simmering, and 1/2 cup of half & half added to the blending process.  I like each bowl topped with a bit of mascarpone cheese.  These changes made this soup perfection, in my book!

This was so good. Used sweet potatoes instead but kept everything else the same. Loved it! Topped with some sour cream...yum :).

For a simple recipe like this I thought it was pretty delicious!  First, I cut the butternut squash in half lengthwise and scooped out the seeds.  Then I placed it facedown on a baking sheet and let it bake for 45 minutes at 350 degrees.  Then I cubed it and left the skin ON to add fiber.  Trust me, you won't tell the difference once its pureed and it makes this soup even healthier!  I completely skipped the browning process and didn't miss it, saving calories from that added butter.  I tossed the cubed squash along with some baby carrots and chopped onions into a pot and let it boil (omitted potatoes and celery).  Pureed it all in a blender and seasoned it with cinnamon, salt, and pepper.  It was delicious and so easy to make!  I didn't even feel the need to add sour cream like others suggested.

I used leftover roasted squash and didn't put them in until the blender step.  I only had to cook the other vegetables in the stock for about 15 minutes.  I also added garlic, curry, cinnamon, basil and paprika...very yummy!

YUM! Like others, I used one sweet potato instead two regular. I had leftover baked squash in the freezer, so the whole recipe only took me about 25 minutes from start to finish. I didn't add any spices, and I thought it had amazing flavor! It definitely did not require milk or sour cream, but this could be partially due to the sweet potato substitution. For a fast, low-cost, super-healthy meal, this recipe is great!

I tried this recipe after ordering some at a pricey restaurant.  This one is better.  I followed the suggestion of roasting the squash beforehand and found it greatly eased the preparation. Also, I left out the celery and didn't miss it at all.  I read that some reviews added garlic -  DON'T DO IT!  This soup has a mild, rich taste that is perfectly balanced. I think garlic would overpower the other flavors.  

When I served this soup last night I thought Butternut Squash soup couldn't taste any better, but I was wrong.  It tastes even better the next day.

I make this soup all of the time, especially in the fall (when squash is so cheap).  Great way to eat vegetables.  The lack of butter/creme isn't even missed!!!!  I'd almost say that this is better than the creme version.  When I make this I leave out the celery as it stays stringy and doesn't puree properly.

This recipe is great, but only with modifications. Cut the squash in half and roast before peeling. Use sweet potatoes rather than white. Use the sour cream other reviewers mentioned, as well as the pinch of nutmeg. In addition, for those having difficulty with the celery, make sure that the vegetables have simmered long enough. I prepared this a day ahead and let it sit in the refrigerator after simmering. This lets the vegetable flavors "mature" together and made pureeing much easier. After sitting overnight, I had no problem with the celery.

Yummy!  Instead of using raw squash you can use 2 of the small frozen blocks of Birdseye squash.  I also peeled some of the stringy parts off of the celery and pulsed it through my mini food chopper before adding it.  I also added the carrots last and used shredded carrots to add some texture.  This is really good with pumpkin walnut biscuits!

This can be delicious almost any way you dress it.  I looked at the spices everyone was suggesting and Chinese 5-spice powder, which I use often and has a sweet/spicy flavor, encompassed many of them. That with a touch of brown sugar was perfect.  Also, I used half a celery root instead of the celery considering how many thought it was too stringy, and that worked perfectly. Thanks!

I read many of the reviews, so I made sure to have sour cream on hand, just in case.  I made the recipe as specified and it was, as others found, very bland. I added a 1/8 tsp of cayenne, a 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, 2 tbsp brown sugar and 1/2 cup of sour cream and that dressed it right up.  Sweet and spicy, but the squash flavor wasn't masked at all.  Good recipe if you tinker with it.

Pretty good.  Baked squash first, used carrots but no potatoes.  Also took the advice of others and spiced it up with curry, nutmeg, cinnamon and cayenne.  Very right, needed it much.  Next time I won't use carrots, it overpowered the taste of the squash.  Also will use sour cream next time.

This soup was delicious - I used my own chicken soup stock. Instead of butter I used olive oil. Didn't add anything else. Was more a bisque for me but that probably was because I used less stock. I followed one of the other reviewers by baking the butternut squash in the oven first (split in half, scooped out seeds, placed in water on 350 F for an hour) that really helped speed things up.

delicious!  i followed other reviwers' advice (boiled the veggies in the broth instead of browning, adding garlic, subbing sweet potatoes instead of regular ones, adding bay leaves).  My mom likes some texture in her soup so i pureed 80% of the veggies after simmering, then poured it back into the rest of the soup.  I nixed the celery and doubled the recipe for a larger crowd.  I also added half a cup of skim milk at the very end, to give it a bit of a creamier taste.  However, i  think i should have added a cup of whole milk instead.  My family thought that a few slices of gingercould have really added to the flavor. I suggest leaving the lid half on if you don't wnat a really thin soup.

This was a good recipe.  I used homemade chicken broth and added 1/2 of a sweet potato.  I recommend cooking the squash beforehand and scrapping out the contents rather then trying to peel it uncooked.

In typical fashion, I altered this recipe to  spice it up. Firstly, I used olive oil instead of butter. I also used vegan chicken bouillon cubes (3 in total). I also added 1/4 tsp. of cumin seed when sautéing the vegetables. After I puréed the soup, I added 2 tsp of madras curry and 1/4 tsp of lemon zest. I also had some left over fresh spinach, which I diced and added at the end. Divine!

I made a few changes and this recipe came out very tasty.  I added one clove of minced garlic and 1 tsp of chili powder.  I used a potato masher to puree this soup instead of pouring the hot soup into a food processor.  It came out just fine.  For additional seasoning I used 1 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp pepper. Instead of chicken stock, I simply used water with bouilion powder (1 tsp per cup of water).  I definitely would make this soup again.  It's thick and hearty and would taste very good on a chilly fall day.

This is my first time reviewing a recipe -- and I really felt like I should because this soup was very good.  I did leave out the potatoes so it was a lower in carbs.  But the most important part is that it was delicious and easy to make -- one of my new favorites !  Thanks Princess Krista K.

This recipe could not be better. I love butternut squash soup so I make it often but hadn't found a perfect recipe to stick to until I found this one! It's so easy and delicious. I like that it doesn't have cream in it because I recently tried a fancy curried butternut squash soup with cream and it was terrible and took much longer to make. The only thing I did differently with this was I left out the potatoes. I also used a hand blender because that's all I had... but I don't recommend it because the soup kept flying up and hitting me.
Thanks so much for this recipe!

I made it exact (minus the potato) originally and it was pretty good. I like a little more seasoning so ended up adding cinnamon, nutmeg and curry powder plus a dash of ground clove. The extra seasoning made this perfect and I can't wait to enjoy a leftover bowl for my lunch. 

It's worth making, it's low in calories (if you don't add cream) and it's healthy so make this soup. If you want to tweak it up and add some additional seasoning to your liking at least you are starting with a good base.

I made the soup as written and it was too bland (3 star).  So, I decided to tweak it.  Voila!  A 4-5 star in my family's opinion.  Everyone from little to 87 year old grandma loved it.   My version:  1.  Microwave a butternut squash for 12 min., cool, then peel.  2.  Saute chopped onion, several cloves of garlic, celery, potatoes, carrot in butter with a couple Tbsp bacon grease until tender.  3.  Add squash.  4.  Add organic chicken broth.  5. Simmer for 1 hour or so.  6.  Use a stick blender to puree.  7.  Season with salt, pepper, cinnamon, ginger, curry, few drops of tabasco sauce, a little sriracha, and some sugar (all to taste).  8.  Sprinkle with red pepper flakes.  Thanks for the recipe to which I was able to add our own family's little twist.  Delectable!

Also for those feeling a bit adventurous! I added the lemony lentil & kale recipe to the soup after each was made. I had cut back on the amount of lemon and broth added to the lentils and kale and put a healthy dollop in my bowl of soup. It was great and added a good protein punch to this soup!!

This soup was delicious! I changed it a bit though and it turned out awesome.
I used 4 medium carrots, leeks (the white parts), and no potatoes. I also added a bit of curry powder and garlic. Then, after I blended up the vegetables, I added 1/2 cup of cream. It was great!

Recipe was bland to us.   Based on a number of reviews I added 1.2 tsp, 1 tsp Cayenne (this will make spicy - reduce if you wish) and 1/2 cup of half and half near the end.   We tend to like very thick soup so the half and half did the trick.    One time I did make with sweet potatoes instead of regular - but we didn't feel there was significant difference.   So whatever you have will work.      This is a hit on Sunday at our house waiting for dinner.

Excellent!  Simple ingredients, wholesome taste.  Followed the ingredients.  Different--I pierced and microwaved the squash, whole, for about 2 min. per lb.  After cooling, I cut it in half and then cubed the insides, scooping the cubes out with a spoon.  Very simple.  Top with a dollop of sour cream.  Mmmmm!

Husband raved!  I used sweet potato instead of carrot and added a splash of cream at the end.  Will definitely be making this recipe every autumn!

I've made this a few times now. LOVE IT!! I typically don't make the same thing the same way twice though. I've made it exactly as it and it was good, I also made it a couple times with variations: used 1 medium white potato, 3 med. red potatoes, 1 sweet potato, everything else the same, but the last time I made it I added brown sugar and a touch of nutmeg. I think that was a great addition. My sister-in-law wouldn't let me take the leftovers home that night when making it at her house. And if you have a hand immersion blender I would use that, so much less to clean up!   This is a fabulous and healthy and hearty soup. We pair it with an awesome fresh crusty bread and spinach salad .

Love this fall festive recipe! I cooked the squash at 375 for 1 hr (based on the size) and then pealed/seeded it. I added a pinch of both cinnamon and nutmeg..along with some garlic salt. I blended most of the larger veggie pieces, but I didn't blend then entire soup. I prefer it has a little texture. This is sure to please a cold crowd!

This soup was just amazing!! So creamy and delicious. Even my husband, who does not regularly eat soup liked it. I will make this again for sure. I omitted the celery (not fond of it) and used vegetable stalk as I am vegetarian. It's a keeper!!

ok..I cheated..lol..I used canned carrots and canned potatoes. Instead of cinn. and nutmeg, I used pumpkin pie spice. Since I have never had butternut squash soup before, I had no idea what it was supposed to taste like. I thought it tasted really good. My 4 year old is eating a bowl of it now as I type.

The addition of potato makes this soup really creamy and yummy. I followed the ingredients except using bullion cubes to make my stock, 2pkgs 14oz each frozen squash, and completely omitted the salt. To make up for that, I added 1/8 tsp. of both nutmeg and allspice. For additional kick, adding ginger powder and cinnamon to taste. Overall, my husband was blown away ( and he does not care for squash ). Thanks for submitting this recipe. Cheers!

I loved this soup! It is exactly what a butternut soup should be. The only extra that I added which really adds to the flavour is cilantro. Absolutely amazing.

I only made a couple of changes.  I used sweet potatoes instead of carrots and potatoes and added a little garlic and a pinch of curry, and almond milk.  I baked the sweet potatoes and squash earlier in the day and chopped up my onion (oh I used leeks because I needed to use them up) so that when I was ready to make dinner, I could just start throwing stuff in.  If I would have had some cilantro, I would have thrown that on top.  It was fast and yummy!

This soup was great!  I loved the fact that it did not have the heavy cream so it tasted much lighter.   And it was so easy, anyone can make this.

This is an exquisite recipe; we loved it! Absolutely 5 stars.  My minor tweaks were 2 celery and 2 carrot and like others, I cut down to one potato, as we like veggies but not starch. Also took others' advice and added a hefty pinch of curry powder.  With no sour cream on hand, I pureed 1/2 cup of low-sodium, low-fat cottage cheese and stirred into soup just before serving.  Fabulous! Definitely will be a household favorite of ours! Thanks for sharing it.

After reading everyone's suggestions, I came up with a collaboration of ideas.  I left out the carrot, potato, sweet potato and celery.  I cut up a medium squash and roasted the pieces in the oven at 400 for 1hr.  Along with the squash, I roasted some garlic gloves.  I used the garlic infused olive oil from the roasted garlic to sate the onions in.  I added the ckn stock and garlic and blended the whole thing w/ a hand mixer and left some of it chunky for texture.  I added yellow curry powder, nutmeg, and red pepper flakes...thanks to those who suggested those wonderful tips!

It was good!  I added the curry, cinnamon, and garlic and I baked the squash for an hour like other reviewers mentioned.  Thinking now about what I could do to increase the strength of the flavors in the soup.  It was good when I added some parmesean and I was glad not to have to add cream to the soup! Thanks!

I made this soup based on what I had so I omitted celery, carrots and used flakes of potatoes (added after blending) and I added curry. 
It was phenomenal! Both my hubs & I liked it plus two people who were at my house and wanted to try it. Great recipe and can be modified to fit what you have!!

Delicious!   I used 2 med. onion because I love onion. 5 cloves of garlic, again because I love garlic, 2 celery stalk, 2 carrot, 2 potato and a medium size squash, covered with chicken stock and boiled until soft then used an hand blender to blend it up. I added a few teaspoons of italian seasoning, few teaspoons of cumin, few dashes of cinamon and nutmeg, a teaspoon or so of tumeric, a tablespoon and a half of curry powder, lots of black pepper, few dashes of hot sauce and salt to taste.   Served hot with parmesan cheese and croutons! quick, easy and filling!!

Peeling the squash was a little too difficult for me, so I roasted the squash in the oven, while the rest of the veggies cooked on the stove.  Then I pureed them together in the blender. The result was a creamy, butter, full-bodied soup with plenty of flavors working well together.  A little sour cream, some garlic bread, and we had one fantastic dinner on a cold winter's night.  Thanks!

I *love* this soup.  I do make a couple of changes: *I use vegetable broth so it's vegetarian and olive oil in place of the butter.  *I use one sweet potato and one white potato.  *I also add 2 Tablespoons of Old Bay seasoning to give it a kick (use less for less kick). *I also blend it with my stick blender so it retains some texture.  DELICIOUS!! Especially with some whole grain bread. :)

The recipe does need the curry/garlic/nutmeg in it to make it truly super. I recommend low-sodium chicken broth.

Very good base soup but needs something... I added 3/4 cup of heavy cream and just a little nutmeg.  It really seemed to bring the flavor out.

Like other reviewers I roasted the squash first.  I didn't add the potatoes.  I cooked the onions, celery and carrots in the melted butter.  As long as you slice the celery thin, it will not be stringy.  I added a clove of garlic, 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, and a little nutmeg and curry powder. Delicious!!

I added 3 cloves of garlic when sauteing the veggies and still found this too bland with just salt and pepper, so I read reviews and added some curry powder, cumin, cayenne pepper, nutmeg and a little brown suger. Serving with garlic ciabatta toast.

This was really good! Easy and tasty even my teenagers liked it.  The only deviation I made was to add about a tsp of paprika just to give it a bit of oomph!

I'd never had butternut squash before, let alone cooked it. But I found this recipe to be the perfect base for some of my favorite spices. I doubled it with 2 carrots, 3 celery stalks, 3 red potatoes and two med squash, all peeled/seeded/chopped/cubed as appropriate. I also added 3 cloves of garlic, 3/4 tsp each of cumin and smoked paprika, a little salt, a good amount of fresh cracked pepper, and a 1/4 tsp of cayenne (we like things with a little kick!) I omitted the butter, substituting a few tablespoons of olive oil instead, and replacing the stock with water/boullion, simply because those were what I had on hand.   The creaminess of the squash is awesome, and with some sour cream leftover from a party and fresh french bread, the whole setup was perfect!

PS...i used the leftovers tonight over pasta and it was marvelous! I browned lean ground turkey in a pan, then added a few ladles full of soup, cooked some of the liquid off, added red pepper flakes and a good helping of parmesan cheese. Mixed in cooked whole grain pasta right into the pan to let the sauce coat the pasta and yum!

Great start but needs more. Bake squash 'til browned. Use 1 baking potato, 1 large tart apple, 14 oz tin coconut milk and 2 tbsp Thai red curry.

I've made several variations on a similar soup, most of the time I don't even bother going past the puree its so delicious but this one was a hit with the whole family. I tossed in a bit of curry powder and it became exotic and wonderful. Perfect for the cold nights! Wonderful recipe!

I just made this last night with the addition of 1/8 tsp red pepper flakes, a splash of hot sauce a 1/2 tsp cumin & the juice from a wedge of lemon.  THEN before serving, blend in 8-16 oz of sour cream to taste.  Serve w/fresh parmesan cheese & a sprinkle of nutmeg.  Without the changes it's a 3 star

Delicious!  I followed a few of the suggestions, omitting the celery, adding 1 potato, and adding some garlic.  It blended up really smoothly.  Will be making this again.

I loved this soup just as it is!  I followed the recipe almost exactly.  The only changes I made are that I used only 1 potato and since everyone was adding a dollop of sour cream I just mixed it into the soup after pureeing it.  I am shocked to see how many people are adding garlic to this soup.  Yuck!  I would never add garlic.  Butternut squash has a very delicate, soft flavor.  That's why a simple onion with a few mild ingredients (like celery, carrot, potato) is just perfect.  Garlic would ruin this soup, in my opinion.  For those who think it's bland as is, I wonder if they are adding enough salt.  Butternut squash needs quite a bit of salt to bring out its natural sweet flavor.  Before adding the salt, there wasn't a lot of flavor.  But I added probably 2 to 3 teaspoons to the whole pot and it was amazing! (Not salty at all, just flavorful.  Salt should bring out natural flavors.)  Very good recipe and we will be making it over and over.  Oh, and I don't understand why anyone would waste time and electricity (or gas) to bake the squash.  Peeling it really isn't that bad and I think it makes the process go much faster.  Slice off the bottom and top of the squash, stand it on end, and saw off the rind vertically.  My prep time was less than 10 minutes and the soup was in the pot.

FANTASTIC! I made this soup twice, once as written and the second without the potatoes.  Great either way.  Not as thick when I didn't use the potatoes.  I shared some with friends and got rave reviews and they wanted the recipe.  This is a keeper.

Very yummy recipe! I followed this recipe exactly as written with one exception- I just used one potato instead of two. This was a yummy, creamy and filling soup. It's definitely a HEALTHY soup that I'll be making several times during the cool fall and COLD winter months!

I made this a little easier by using one 12ounce package of frozen butternut squash.  Having an immersion blender made the vegetables into puree very easy.  It was a good soup but not extremely rich in flavor.

Oh so good. What I do with butternut squash is cut in half, then quarter. Put in microwave oven & cook for 5 min. 2 pieces at a time.  I just scoop out the squash. I didn't add any curry or cumin but when I re-heat this soup, I will put some in. Thanks for the tip. Definitely a saver!

Made this last night and it was a hit and so easy.  I did not think peeling and seeding the BN squash was difficult....just use a good knife and peeler.  I omited the celery...used some left over mashed red potatoes (about a cups worth), and added about a teaspoon of ground cumin.  I also omited the pepper and used 3 tablespoons of unsalted butter.  I used 3 med size carrots and blended all the soup in the pot with a hand blender.  Garnish with some fresh herbs and rosemary bread.  So easy....yummy.

This turned out okay for me although I felt I needed to add in quite a bit more seasoning to perk it up.  Also, I pulled out some of the potato before blending to avoid having it dilute the squash too much.  I opted to use a leek instead of the celery.  It blended up to a very nice consistency but just tasted a bit bland so I added in some cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg to try to liven it up a bit.  I also added in just a bit of half and half, about 1/4 cup, to richen it.  UPDATE:  I warmed some up the next day and it reheats REALLY WELL!  You could easily make this a day ahead and serve for dinner the next night.

I love this recipe!  I put everything but the squash in a presser cooker.  The celery I did not cut up so that I could have the flavor in the soup but take out the big pices.  The baking of the squash for one hour didn't get it done all the way so I boiled it in pot a few more minutes of veggies after pressure cooking.  I used a mock chicken bullion (I am a vegetarian) and it was awesome.  I garnished with drizzle of whipping cream and parsley flakes!
yummy!

A delicious soup! It took me closer to 45 minutes to chop the veggies (raw). I did "brown" them first with 2.5 tbsp of butter. I added a bit of fresh garlic while simmering. It started a little plain (but good) for me.  Towards the end I added about 2 tbsp of cream cheese, a bit of red and black pepper, a very small handful of brown sugar, dashes of salt, cayenne, nutmeg and thyme. Very fun to play with and a great end result!

This was delicious, though after reading other reviews, I made some modifications. I used 6 small red potatoes instead of the regular potato. I also doubled the carrots and celery and added 2 red bell peppers, 2 spicy fresh peppers, 2 Tbsp. fresh ginger root, 2 Tbsp. fresh garlic, 2 Tbsp. mango chutney, 1 tsp. nutmeg. I used a hand mixer in the pot to save a couple of steps and a mess, and it worked great. I added 2 Tbsp. low fat cream cheese to add some creaminess, and stirred it in to melt it. I froze half of what I made, and shared the rest with happy friends. I will definitely make this again!

Excellent soup; very different.  I did NOT puree all the vegetables, but purposely left some veggies out of the blender so there would be more texture (we prefer chunks/pieces rather than a smooth soup).  I'd definitely make this again next fall!

This recipe was amazing!  An immediate hit in my house.  I followed the recipe exactly, except that I didn't end up pureeing it in the end because I didn't feel like getting out the blender.  Instead I mashed everything up with a potatoe masher.  There were chunks of veggies mixed in with the puree and I kind of liked it that way.

My family and I liked this soup. We are big potato eaters and I had a few left so I added more potato than called for in the recipe. I also added some garlic and just a shake or two of chili powder to spice it up. My family asked if I would make it again.

It took me a while longer to prepare than the recipe stated. I thought it was a great recipe, not much flavor but a great consistency. I added 2 tablespoons of cream cheese and a little curry powder for flavor. I would definitely make it again. Great staple.

This is a really good soup for a cold winter day.  My butternut squash was on the smallish side so I used one small butternut and one sweet dumpling squash.  I added just a touch of brown sugar, since the sweet dumpling is not as sweet as the butternut and I used red pepper for a little kick.  Yummy!

Very easy and delicious....my first time making butternut squash soup and my family loved it, they even had seconds. I sautéed the onions first until they were turning brown and caramelized and when all the ingredients were cooked I just emulsified it all right in the pot with my Kitchen Aid hand held blender, it was so easy!  I will definitely make this again.

It is a nice healthy recipe and some tips of the other reviews would help, like the garlic and curry powder , but when you tweak it with bacon, white wine or some other calorie adding suggestions it doesn't make sense , then it becomes a whole other recipe !

I made this soup and it was FANTASTIC! I read the other reviewers and got some good ideas...I baked the squash at 375 for 1 hr and I took the strings off the celery and used all the veggies in the recipe and added minced garlic from a jar to equal 1 clove.  after cooking the vegetables in the broth I mashed them up with a potato masher (because one reviewer complained about splattering when she used her immersion blender).  I scooped the seeds out, discarded, and then scooped the squash out of the shell (no peeling, yea!)into the veggies in the pan and used the immersion blender to perfectly puree the whole thing.  I added 1/2t cinnamon and same amount of fresh ground nutmeg, a pinch of curry powder, a pinch of sage, a little red pepper flakes (and for good measure, a pinch of cayenne).  also about 1/2 t each of salt and black pepper (from a can--lazy?). The spices were undetectable, individually, but the blend was AMAZING!  Since my husband doesn't eat squash OF ANY KIND, I divided this into storage containers and used the soup for more than a week and ate the whole thing MYSELF!! I put it out in my overflow fridge in the garage.  I'm getting ready to make this again today.  I hope I don't burn-out on it, but if I do, I'll freeze it in individual servings for later.  P.S. I tried a little sour cream and it was good, but just as good without...also great soup cold or hot!!...makes WAY more than 4 servings!!!

ok, i followed most everyone's advice about adding some additional spices and it payed off! i didn't have curry powder so i used paprika and also cumin, garlic powder (plus garlic glove in the beginning), pepper flakes and salt & pepper. SO YUMMY!! AND i also followed the advice to precook the squash before cutting up - i think that helped a lot. in fact, it was nice and soft when i added it to the mix so when it was time to puree i only had to use the non-electric hand held thingy. the squash mashed up nicely with big chunks of the other stuff. i served with sourdough toast and i used greek yogurt instead of sour cream in 1 bowl, but i could take it or leave it. i will probably use pre-cut squash next time, but my only real regret is not making more! thanks for the input everyone! ENJOY!

The first time I made this I stuck to the recipe.  This time I made some changes.  Instead of butter, I used olive oil to lightly brown the vegetables.  I also added some red pepper flakes to add a bit of spice and a little curry powder to add a little depth of flavor.  At the end, instead of adding more stock, I added a little bit (like 2 T.) of half-and-half for richness.  EXCELLENT!

This soup was very easy and tasty. I did change a few things. I added 2 cloves of garlic, 1/2 tsp each cinnamon and nutmeg, and 1/2 cup light sour cream.  I omitted the celery  as advised in other people's reviews. My boyfried loved it and made sure i saved this recipe!

I've made it once. As others, I baked the squash ....very easy. I also added-
Nutmeg & cinnamon, but didn't stop there cause it still didn't have the zing I wanted so I added 1/2-3/4 tsp red pepper and 3-4 pinches of saffron. Loved it!  Will make again.

Excellent soup if you add your favorite spices.  I use 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. nutmeg, 1 tblsp. minced garlic and a pinch of cayenne. That tiny bit of cayenne heat adds a special touch. I also happen to add 1/3 c. half and half to increase the creaminess.

I found this recipe just browsing, looking for something fun to do for autumn. The recipe was a huge success, particularly with how good it made the house smell as it cooked. I read several of the recipe alterations from other users, and added as an afterthought some garlic powder and curry. The curry is a must! It made a fine soup all the better. I will try the suggestions of sour cream next time! As is, the recipe is an excellent place to start and allow you to add your own special touches to!

So I've made this recipe using the directions above for thanksgiving every year for three years. Today I added more veggies to it -- leek, turnip, parsnip, and parsley. This soup above is such a great base -- i can eat it like that or add more. This is a must-make for me every few weeks from nov to feb!

A household favorite in the fall/winter.  I've made it at least twice a year for the last 4 years and it always gets rave reviews with friends and family.  I've made it as written and it's fabulous and I've experimented with a pinch of this and a pinch of that and it was still fabulous and fun.  I love that his recipe doesn't require any cream (as most others do) but yet it's still extremely creamy in texture and taste.

I really enjoyed the recipe just as it made. Next time I will bake the squash. That was the only painful part.  I thought about adding garlic but decided to try it without. My teenage daughter who doesn't really enjoy squash came home and ate two helpings of this soup. She thought it was great.  I made some garlic toast rolls as a topping and they gave the soup more texture.  I will make this again.

I modified this a bit from the original recipe based on the other reviews. I left out the butter and celery. Stop and Shop had cut butternut squash on sale, so I used a 20oz pack of that. Used 1 potato, roasted the squash, potato and carrots in a little olive oil for 20 minutes. Sauteed the onion and garlic in the pan, used vegetable broth, and all the roasted items. I added cumin, cinnamon, dash of celery salt, black pepper and red pepper flakes.  To make it really creamy I added a quarter of an avocado.   I put a little too much cinnamon, next time I will just do a quick shake.  Blended it an it's rich, creamy and the hint of heat is perfect.  Thanks for a great base recipe and all the suggestions.  I will be making this quite often.

I LOVE this soup!!! BUT,I changed a few things that I think made it better, in my opinion.  I omitted the potato and added instead one medium sweet potato. I also added a tablespoon of fresh thyme and a few shakes of ground cinnamon, both were added when the chicken stock was added to the veggies. After blending I added 1/2 cup of half and half. In my humble opinion it was perfect. My sister calls it fall in a bowl, so yummy.  Thank you for the original reciepe, we love it.

I had never tried squash before so I was not sure what to expect. Despite the very good reviews on this recipe, I could not help but notice a fair few said it was very bland, based on these reviews, I was not sure what to expect and so I did not have great expectations.
The colour of the soup is amazing and the smell is great and as for the taste, I absolutely loved this, it actually is really creamy and full of flavour, I am not a huge fan of soup normally but I was so pleased with this I wanted more (I made enough for 4 servings and as it is just for myself, I get to look forward to every bowl). Definitely goes onto my "make every third week" recipe list. It was the best soup I have ever tasted or at least the best in a very long time, if I had paid for this as a starter in a restaurant I would have been really happy with my choice. I am baffled as to why anyone would say this soup is bland... I used just black pepper on top and added a dash of cinnamon, it was delicious. Thank you.

This was delicious. The first time I made it it was perfect. I left out the celery and onion and used veggie stock. I added garlic and curry powder based on another review. I underestimated how much chopped up butternut squash I had but this was a good thing. I used fewer potatoes and carrots and less veggie stock and the soup was thick and sweet and delicious. The second time I followed the recipe more closely (no celery and onion, though) and it wasn't nearly as sweet and flavorful. I could taste the potatoes more than the butternut squash. I will definitely make it like I did the first time in the future. It was good both times; the first way was just more flavorful.

One of the things I want to beg of you all is to roast your squash!!!!! It not only smells much better in the house, but it imparts a totally different, wonderful toasty flavor you cannot get with frying, boiling or microwaving. If time is an issue, bake it the night before with your dinner and it will be all ready for you the next day. Keeping the flavors in mind I actually roasted ALL my vegetables instead of cooking them in the broth. Such rich flavors! Changes I made to the recipe were minimal, but based on the ideas of others. Used 1 sweet potato instead of 2 regular. I also roasted a red pepper and 2 cloves of garlic. Used celery salt in place of regular salt because I didn't have celery. Added a dash of nutmeg, cinnamon and some sage powder. Blended but left it chunky. I have to say I still found this a bit bland, though my Dad, who is a squash lover thought it was great and finished it the next night. Lastly, I would recommend making this soup either the day before or at least earlier in the day as the flavors come out over time! This was much better day two. And a resounding yes to the sour cream and garlic croutons!!!

My bf loved this. I didn't bother using the blender, just used the potato smasher instead to keep it sort of chunky. Added some more spices such as cinnamon, thyme, parsley, red pepper flakes, and some bay leaves. With the chicken broth, I also added half a cup of apple juice as another poster suggested. Omitted the celery and sauteed the veggies in olive oil instead of butter and garlic. I cut the squash in half, took out the pulp and seeds, brushed it with olive oil and salt, pepper, and rosemary and put garlic in the seed holes as another poster suggested and baked it on 400 for an hour before adding it to the soup. Sprinkled a little parmesan cheese on after and served with breadsticks.

I made this recipe for lunch today and what a great lunch we had.  I switched up the butternut squash for buttercup instead and the results were exceptional.  I didn't have to add a thing.  I doubled the recipe because the squash was so big so now we have enough left for lunch tomorrow too.  I made a loaf of French Bread to go with and what a perfect match.  I recommend this soup to anyone who likes a good, hearty soup.  I will be making this soup again.  Thanks for sharing.

Great soup!  I love that there are additional vegetables, not just butternut squash.  We've made it for guests several times and it's always been a hit.  My husband wished there was a tad more spice/flavor to it, so we tried Molly's suggestions and it's even better! 

Suggestions: 1- use only one potato, if you use two it takes away from the squash. 2- add 1/2 tsp cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg. 3- add 1 T minced garlic. 4- Add 1/4 cup Captain Morgan's spiced rum. Serve with a dollop of sour cream and some parmesan cheese.

Baked squash as suggested - only way to go - easy! Didn't have much time to pull together so cooked onion in butter while boiled potatoes and carrots together in chicken stock. Added squash to onions then potatoes and carrots. Used hand blender - worked great. Seasoned - salt, pepper, garlic powder & dash nutmeg. My son added Tzatziki of all things and said it tasted great. Will make again

So so good!  I've never made butternut squash from scratch before, but so glad I did!  Very easy and very YUM!  I think the toughest part was peeling and cutting the squash.  I don't understand why everyone is adding all sorts of extra ingredients.  This soup is excellent as-is!  Well - I did make one change.  I used mushroom broth instead of chicken to qualify it vegan.  And I didn't even use all 32 oz of broth because I like my soups thick.  I had no trouble with the blender.  Poured it into my KitchenAid and pureed it for about 15 seconds and it was perfect.  I'm wondering how well this will freeze... ?

Just finished making this and had a bowl. So easy to make, so little time and Oh So Delicious! I added some spice to mine, red Thai pepper & Sriracha (Rooster Sauce), as I'm a spice lover and put it nearly everything I eat. Also, I'm vegetarian working my way to vegan so I used vegetable broth. Everything else I followed exactly as directed and it came out perfect. I can see myself making this every Fall & Winter. Thanks for sharing. {:O)

While I must admit I have not tried this recipe, I do love butternut squash soup and have my own tried and true recipe. Based upon that I would like to suggest a few things you might also like to experiment with: add a couple peeled and diced apples - I love the sweetness they give, add up to 1 teaspoon of liquid smoke - try a little at a time until you reach the flavor you want, and I always add cream just before serving with a spoon of sour cream on the top of the bowl.

Great stuff!! As many suggested, I roasted the squash and it made it very easy. I roasted a large yam instead of using white potato. For those that didn't, or wouldn't add celery in the future because of the texture in the smooth soup, use a vegetable peeler down the back of the stalk to remove the stringy "veins" and you won't have a problem. Also, if you use white pepper, you won't have black specks in the pretty yellow soup. After blending this to a velvety texture and tasting, I agree it was a tad bland. I added cinnamon, nutmeg, clove and ginger which improved it considerably. The best thing about this is that it is so healthy and good! Thank you!

amazing! I nearly ate the whole pot before dinner!!! :) I followed some of the recommended additions though: I added 2 small cloves of garlic (minced), and 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and a dash of nutmeg.  I didn't peel the potatos, just washed and cubed them.  I didn't have regular carrots, only baby ones, I jsut threw a few of them in.  
DEFINITELY a keeper!

I'd never made soup before, and was surprised at how easy it was! My family and I all enjoyed it - I made it in July, but it would be perfect for fall or winter. It is rich and hearty and VERY filling, but so good! I paired it with homemade bread.
The only reason I give this recipe four stars instead of five is because of my minor substitutions - I used a largeish yam in place of the potatoes, and added a pinch of curry powder at the end. When I finished pureeing it was yummy but bland - plenty of S&P and curry powder fixed that! I really don't think it would have been the same without the yam though, so I would recommend using that instead of the potatoes.

I gave this recipe 3 stars because I didn't really like the potatoes and changed it a bit to my liking.  I think this is a much heavier soup when you add potatoes.  

I omitted the celery and 1 1/2 potato.  It is pretty thick.  I ended up using 42 ounces of chicken stock to thin it out.  As for those saying it is bland, you season to taste.  I would recommend 1 1/2 teaspoon of salt.   You will notice a difference.  For lighter version, read on:

I make another version of butternut squash soup that is light and delicious.  Besides butternut, I add fresh Italian parsley (2 T) and sage (2 t) in addition to one onion, chicken stock (5-6 C) and salt and pepper to taste.  No potatoes, carrots, or celery needed.  I also cut my butternut in half and roast it in the oven for 50 minutes at 350 degree.  Makes it really easy to get the skin off and chop up.

I'm not sold on this recipe. As is it was bland and the potato was overpowering. I did add (after tasting finished product as listed) cinnamon, nutmeg, and curry.   I also added 1/2 cup half and half.  It helped. I will probably try a different butternut squash recipe next time. It was not terrible, I just thought it could have been better.

This soup was pretty tasty, but mine came out a little thick, almost like baby food consistency.  Next time I will add more chicken broth.  Also the flavor of the potato seemed to stand out so next time I will probably cut the potato amount in half.

hard to review as i did make several changes like other reader, as written it's a half decent starter recpe. I omitted potatoes as i think the consistency clashes, excluded carrot as i dont like it too sweet, I baked the squash first after rubbing with olive oil, salt and pepper. Then i sauteed the celery and onions, added 3 cloves of garlic minced, sauteed that as well.I used vegetable broth as i was cooking for a vegetarian,  I then simmered the onion/garlic/celery mixture with the squash, 2 bay leaves, a pinch of allspice, salt and pepper, and a pinch of red pepper flakes. I simmered for about 40 minutes to let flavours blend, removed bay leave, pureed with an immersion blender, added some sour cream, and it was AMAZING! My fiancee said the best he has ever tried!

This was my first attempt at squash soup. It was so easy and beyond fantastic! I read the reviews first but didn't think there was a bland taste. I did add all the stock at once.

i never write reviews, so this means a lot coming from me. 

i am a VERY picky eater, and i usually don't mind making full-fat recipes. this recipe is SO GOOD on its own that you don't even need the butter in the first place. i've made it several times, and here is how i do so:

i roughly cut up all the veggies (and throw an apple in there if i have one), saute them with a drizzle of EVOO for five minutes, pour a little chicken broth over the whole thing, and let it simmer just until the veggies are soft. then i get my hand blender (the kind with a wand--a lifesaver), and blend that stew up. 

it's so delicious and healthy. i roughly follow the recipe now. it's pretty hard to mess up!

another tip: i get the pre-cubed butternut squash from trader joe's. i don't need to cut my own, and i just throw the whole bag in there.

I made this soup WITHOUT peeling the butternut! Try it. It'd save a lot of time and add more fiber. My family did not taste the difference. :-)

This was so simple and soooo delicious!!!! Even my 9 year old wanted seconds! Used yogurt butter to saute the veggies and added some garlic salt allspice nutmeg and cinnamon for a little added flavor.  Highly highly recommend- kid approved :-)

This soup was SO delicous. I love squash already, but this was such a good way to make it. It was very hard to peel the raw squash, next time I would probably bake it first instead. I cut my finger! But, in the end it was worth it. I added a sprinkle of curry powder, red pepper, and garlic powder. I also put a little Schriracha hot sauce on mine along with a dollop of sour cream. Mmmmm :) delicous.

Ok, I agree with many that this was a little bland. Nutmeg and curry powder really bring it to life. Used silken tofu to cream things up a bit.

Fantastic soup!! This tastes like Autumn in a bowl. I added half a cup of Pumpkin and a tsp of cinnamon and it is delicious. Very creamy and rich without the calories of heavy cream.

my husband never had squash soup (didn't even know if he liked squash) and he loved it! with a grilled cheese it was awesome! i took some ideas from people & from another squash soup recipe (used one regular potato/one sweet potato for health benefits): did this recipe as written then added, extra garlic, extra salt/pepper, cayenne pepper, ginger, curry powder, a little dollup of sour cream in each bowl. it was awesome! it is a great fall soup and really quite healthy!

Thank you for the delicious recipe!! I followed other reviewers' suggestions and added a bit of cayenne, nutmeg, and curry powder. I also roasted the squash to make for easier peeling. Was planning on freezing some for lunches but it disappeared too quickly! Will definitely make again.

This was my first time making butternut squash soup and it was delicious.  After reading other reviews I added a dash of nutmeg, minced garlic and about 1/4 teasp. of cinnamon. It is definitely a "fix again".

This had a great taste. I made it vegetarian by using veggie stock, and added pumpkin pie spice at the end. I used my immersion blender to make it pretty smooth. It is a very thick, filling soup. Thanks for the recipe!

I tried this recipe today, because I bought a squash and wasn't sure what to do with it. I did make a few changes. I eliminated the celery as recommended by other reviews. And I used 1 sweet potato and 1 yukon gold. It was FABULOUS!

I made this soup for guests that are coming tomorrow thankfully as I wouldn't serve this to anyone. Even I don't want to eat it! The potato made it very starchy and it has a dry grainy finish every time you taste it. I would not recommend this and I will not make it again as stated. I would try it without the potato which ruined what could have been a very good base soup.

Yes, it is a bit bland. I stir in a Tblsp of roasted red pepper puree just before serving and garnish with feta cheese and chopped fresh basil. Alternately, also add in chopped walnuts instead of feta.

Deeeeelicious! As suggested by others, I added some curry powder to it---about 1 tsp. in total. And I baked my squash ahead of time, whole, like others also suggested. It was a very simple, hearty, and healthful dish to prepare. I love that it has no fatty cream or milk in it. Definitley a make-again!!

This was delicious!  I followed recommendations of other reviewers, adding cinnamon, nutmeg, and crushed red pepper.  I didn't have any sour cream so I added a bit of yogurt.  It got rave reviews from the family.

I made this recipe following a few different suggestions from past reviewers. I baked the butternut squash whole in the oven at 400 degrees for 50 minutes. This made it a lot easier to peel and clean. I did not use celery because I didn't have any on hand. I added salt, pepper, curry powder, cinnamon and nutmeg and the taste was delicious and hearty!! When serving add a dollop of sour cream in the middle and some bagel crisps or toasty bread on the side. Delicious and warming to the soul!

This was delicious! I used sweet potatoes instead of regular potatoes because that is what I had on hand.I also baked the squash and it was super simple to prepare.  I then decided to add some curry to bring out the flavors- and it did!! Tasted much better (to us) with the curry. Served with a dollop of sour cream...amazing!

My Favorite Soup! But I don't usually use carrots, potato or celery. Just butter and onion in the pot for 2 minutes then add cinnamon and maybe a little nutmeg. Then the cubed squash and cover it with vegetable stock (we're all Vegetarians.) Oops, I also add one apple per squash and a little honey. Puree and serve - No salt or pepper. I sometimes add sour cream right into the blender, or a dollop in the bowl.   YUM!

This was delicious, with a few additions. I used vegetable broth instead of chicken stock since we are vegetarian. I added a clove of garlic, a generous sprinkle of cayenne pepper and dashes of cinnamon and nutmeg as well.  It was quite bland without them, but these additions make this recipe a 5-star!

Do not attempt to peel the squash, cut it in half, deseed and chop into large chunks.  Boil in water while the other ingredients and softening.  Cool them quickly in cold water then peel the skin off very easily, add to the other ingredients and pulse.

nice texture, a bit sweet so will re-try adding cut/buttered toast on the top (cut toast into small cubes and fried in a bit of butter for home made croutons)...and maybe a bit of fried onions mixed in as small pieces

this is really flavorful. I did not add any salt since I made my broth from bullion/enough salt in that already. I used 1/4 tsp of black pepper. Only thing I added was 1/2 tsp of celery seed for extra celery flavor. I did just threw everything in the crock pot and let it go for the day. I do think having it simmer in tthe slow cooker all days helps bring out the flavors.

This is a very good, hearty soup.   I took the suggestion of several reviewers to spice it up a bit, and I think the addition of a pinch of curry powder really keeps it flavorful and interesting.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was the First time I've ever made or eaten butternut squash soup. Wow was it good!! I'm a new vegetarian and always looking for quick simple recipes and this was the best!!  I did follow some of the suggestions from the comments.   Used 2 medium sweet Potatos, used frozen diced butternut squash, and left the cellery out. I also only used about 1 tablespoon of butter added 2 cloves of garlic and a tablespoon of a cinnamon/ nutmeg/ allspice blend and a teaspoon of Italian seasoning. Seasoned with salt and pepper to taste.

I love the flavor & texture of this soup!  I did not use celery & I baked the potatoes & squash before adding them, but this is quite delicious & very low-fat & healthful.  Upon, making this a 2nd time & reading more reviews, I believe the flavor (or lack thereof) is a result of the chicken broth.  The 1st time I used a combination of homemade broth I had frozen & a can of Swanson's broth to make 4 cups.  This time I had no homemade or Swanson's & made some from a concentrated base...& it was not as tasty!  So find a good chicken broth that you like.  Also, I used acorn squash both times which I like & found no need to blend the soup if squash & potatoes are already baked.  I did use an egg beater to hand-mix it, but I like it with some chunks & not completely pureed.

This is a surprisingly tasty soup.  I exchanged the chicken broth with vegetable broth and it was still delicious.  Really warms you up inside!  Update 2019:  Made it many times.  Now I replace the potatoes with a yam for just the right tinge of sweetness.  Also, let that squash ripen nice and good for the best flavor.  It can sit on your counter for months before using it.

Absolutely deeeelicious!!  As with the last reviewer, I used only squash and onions - no celery, no potatoes, and baked squash first at 400 for an hour. I also added a sprinkle of nutmeg and a small portion of bouillon, and a bit of parmasean.  Can't wait to make it again.

I used freshly grated ginger, a dash of ceyanne pepper & curry that gave it a nice kick.  Before serving, I added 1/2 cup of whipping cream to give it a creamy consistency. I think 1 potato is plenty or it will be a rather thick soup.**Great tip:  Use a hand mixer to blend!  You can blend the veggies while still hot in the pot and it is less messy than transferring to a blender.  I loved this soup and will make it again soon!

I was expecting this soup to be a new flavor to me since I am new to using squash in my cooking let alone in a soup. This wasn't the case, it was a very familiar taste... It tastes like a pureed chicken soup -- just thicker. This is not to say it tastes bad, it just is bland and not what I was expecting. How I made this recipe: I omitted the celery to avoid the strings that other users had commented about and added celery salt instead. I put in 4 cloves of minced garlic. I used sweet potatoes which may have saved the recipe since they are more flavorful than regular potatoes (and healthier). Thinking that it still needed something I added cayenne pepper. Overall it still just tasted like pureed chicken soup. I will eat it but only because I am a poor student who needs to eat everything she buys! To get through this entire batch I've gotten creative in my uses for this soup. I made a mix of broccoli, sugar snap peas, corn, tomato, onion, and ground turkey which I stirred into the soup. VERY good compared to the original soup and could even be a new version of this recipe. I also will put a dollop with my eggs in the morning. I cannot wait for this soup to finally be gone and will probably never make it again unless someone is sick!

Good recipe, but I used all butternut squash instead of the potatoes.  Put a dab of low-fat sour cream on top of each bowl and it was very filling and satisfying!

(ADDED NOTE) for everyone having trouble with the celery...just break the stalk in half and pull the strings out before chopping....devein celery anytime you do a smooth soup!)   ok my review: Just finished my soup and am giving it 4 stars as I did make changes... I used 2 Tb butter and softened the mir poix (2 celery, 2 carrots, small sweet onion about 1/4 c., 1 diced apple, and 1 clove of garlic minced)  I roasted my butternut, cut in half along with one white sweet potato (not yam), at 400 degrees for 1 hour, peeled the skins and cubed them and added to the veggies. I added 32 oz of chicken stock a bit at a time, I seasoned with one bay leaf, cumin, parsely, cinamon and nutmeg (try pumpkin pie spice) and a pinch of cayenne pepper, and salt and pepper to taste. Bring to a boil and then simmered for about 40 minutes. After blending the soup I added about 1/2 c. of heavy cream. Served with a dollop of sour cream, this was delightful! OK I have made this several times, and folks I could bottle it, sell it and retire! Stick with the base recipe...then have at it...according to your preferences and tastes. Use more Cumin, more spices period...and the pumpkin pie spice adds a nice note. Always gather your spices in advance, toss in half with the veggies as you caramelize them, this allows the spices to come to their full potential. Of course you should do that with all cooking...then toss in rest of spices when you have everything simmering nicely. Gave some to neighbors..they we

I love this soup. I worked with the recipe and made a few changes -which I write down mostly for my own use to go back to next time I make this. First - I roasted the squash with a little bit of S&P and olive oil -halved in the oven until soft enough that the skin could be removed easily.  Meanwhile - I sauteed the onion, celery, carrot and 1 potato in butter - I also added about 3 cloves of garlic to this mix.  Then I added the roasted squash & a big can of chicken broth.  I brought to a boil and then simmered as directed by recipe.  Then I pureed in Cuisinart until smooth and put back on the burner.  I added s&p to taste, and then a pinch here and there of cayenne pepper, ground cloves, nutmeg, allspice.  I wasn't thrilled yet - so I added 4oz of cream cheese and pureed in batches in cuisinart again.  It tastes delish - a little bit of heat from the cayenne.  I love it.  I can't wait to have it tomorrow when it's had time to rest.
2nd time making this - delish outcome.  2 T butter, 1 onion, no celery in the house, 2 carrots, 2 butternut squashes - no potato - added 1 gala apple. roasted squash 45 min, sauteed everything - added 4 small cans of chicken broth - simmered a while. then used my hand blender to smooth.  added s&p, pinch of cayenne, allspice, and thyme.  so good!  then i added hot curry powder which was very good - but next time i will measure a SMALL amount of curry...ha ha! also added sour cream for a little creamy texture.  we loved it!

Easy.  Add 1/4 teaspoon of each: cinnamon, nutmeg, cardamom, cayenne pepper  -and you have a winner! The other reviewers are right, it's a little bland if you aren't used to eating homemade vegetable soups.  No need to add salt, the chicken stock adds about 600-700mg per serving!

My husband and I both really enjoy this recipe. Even my 16 month old daughter who is extremely picky loves it. I suggest leaving out the celery. Also adding curry (to taste) and some (may seem strange) pumpkin pie spice (also to taste) seem to really punch up the flavor. A great soup, I've made it 3 times since November because my husband keeps requesting it! It's a keeper!

Update 1/1/16:  Still one of our favorites.  My oldest daughter (now 8) and my youngest (4) really love this soup.  I bake the squash first and that saves a lot of chopping.  My girls also love it with a little bit of sour cream.

This was yummy- I added about 1/4 c rum, 1 teaspoon real maple syrup, dash of cinnamon and a dash of curry powder to give it some kick and robustness. Yum!

it was very good. Used 1 sweet potato and one regular and it was very good.  Note, take it off the burner before you use a blender that you put into the soup pot - hot soup, volcano like burst!!

This soup was great! I incorporated tips from other reviewers: I purchased packaged squash which was already peeled and cubed, to save time. I placed the cubed squash in a bowl with about an inch of water in the microwave for 15 mins. In the meantime, I peeled and cubed 1 sweet potato, chopped 1 onion, and shredded 1 carrot. I couldnt find chicken stock at the supermarket, so I used 8oz of vegetable stock & 3 packets of chicken broth (added to 24oz of water=32oz). By this time the squash was ready; I drained any remaining water from the bowl. I added all of the vegetables, to the stock mixture with a dash of the following: curry powder, red pepper flakes, cinnamon, nutmeg, salt, white pepper, & garlic powder. I simmered this for about 30 mins, then pureed everything in the blender. I added it back to the pot, added 3 dollops of sour cream, & let it simmer for another 5 mins. The results were fantastic! It came out a little spicy; when I make this again I may omit the red pepper flakes but overall it was great!!

This was pretty darn good. I reduced the amount of onion to like a tablespoon or two. I added a few dashes of nutmeg, cinnamon, curry powder and cayenne pepper. It had a nice rich flavor with a little heat. Mine was more rustic with small chunks of various veggies. My grandpa taught me a way to get most of the strings out of celery to make them easy to eat and are more tender, snap a portion of the end (do not remove) and peel down, quite a bit of the strings will be removed.

This was an excellent recipe.  I peeled and chopped all the vegetables, seasoned with sea salt and pepper, drizzled the vegetables with olive oil and roasted @ 400 degrees for about 20-30 minutes.  After removing from the oven, I didn't have any vegetable stock and simmered on stove top in a quart of water for another 30 mins. or so to create a stock; then blended veggies and stock and what a wonderful wonderful soup.  Excellent flavor!  I did not add butter because I did not want the extra fat.

As for an easy way to peel the squash, I used a potato peeler and it was very easy.  I cut off the top or the squash, cut it in half long ways and chopped, then did the same for the bottom using a spoon to scoop out the seeds, cut it long way and chopped.  Thank you for a wonderful soup!

This is a great base recipe, but I've made my own adjustments.  Like others, I bake the squash in the oven @ 350 for 45 min or until tender.  I like my squash soup super healthy and a little spicy, so I've made the following changes: omit the potatoes, add 2 cloves of minced garlic, 1/2 cup applesauce, 1/2 cup chopped fresh italian parsley & 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper.  With no added fat, it makes for a low calorie, healthy and tasty soup.

This soup is a great side dish and I added applesauce and a little nutmeg. I sauted onions first, I also bought the already cubed butternut squash from Costco and it was ALOT QUICKER when you are pressed for time!

I made this soup for Thanksgiving Dinner this year (in Canada Thanksgiving dinner is in October) and what a huge success this soup was.  I could not believe it.  I did make some changes to the recipe though.  I added 1 apple pear, 1 tbsp freshly grated ginger and half a tsp of curry.

This soup is fantastic. I've made it 3 times in the past 2 weeks. I roasted the squash on the outdoor grill for 45 minutes then scooped the flesh out. The only change I had to make was to replace the potatoes with carrots due to dietary constraints and to add a clove of garlic.

Excellent recipe!! There is no need to add sour cream or bacon to the soup or cut back on the potatoes,it's excellent as is!
I had a jumbo squash and I needed more liquid so I added a cup of 1% milk to the chicken stock. 
Add a pinch (1.5t) of curry powder 1T of minced garlic,garlic salt and pepper to taste and it's just as good if not better than campbells and cheaper too!
Thank you for submitting this recipe.

This soup is outstanding! I used veggie broth instead of chicken broth and followed others advice and added a pinch of cinnamon, nutmeg, curry powder and even bit of maple syrup and it was really creamy and flavor. No need for milk or sour cream... A great, healthy low-fat soup!

Without modifications, 3 stars.  With, 5 plus.  Secret for this recipe: SAGE and white fresh ground pepper (or black if it's what you have).  Next time, I will increase the amount of carrots, substitute sweet potato, omit the celery.  Also, when you're blending, if you add a touch of skim milk instead of sour cream it makes a huge difference in texture without adding much fat.

This recipe is great. Even my husband who doesn't like "starchy" veggies loves it. I used the same ingredients, but added 2 cloves of garlic, omitted pepper, instead sprinkle some nutmeg on the top.  I happened to have cilantro on hand, so I added a coupel of clilantro leaves on top just for decoration. Surpringly, the cilantro gives out a very fresh frequence that enhances the flavor of the soup.  This is a great dish. I'll cook it again.

Gave it 4 stars only because I made some changes. I roasted the squash first for about 45min at 350. Made the peeling much easier. I also added a finely diced garlic clove and a tsp of curry. This was wonderful soup. Even my picky 10 yr loved it.

Very good, but seemed to need a bit more flavor, so I added a sliver of ginger root (before cooking and pureeing) and circa 1/2 t cinnamon. I think it could still be kicked up a notch and will add more of these and maybe a few other spices next time.

Update: second attempt - I didn't have chicken broth so used water, added 1/2 t cumin. Balance of veggies was also probably different. I found that it is still a good recipe.

delicious and flavorful!
i added just a little curry, not enough for it to be the predominant taste, but to give a little extra depth to the flavor.
yum!

This is a great soup base. I also roasted the squash for an hour along with an entire head of garlic drizzled wirh olive oil. I am giving it 4 stars because as is the recipe is plain and kinda boring. I added a pinch of nutmeg, ginger and cayenne pepper and it was PERFECT. Also, as much as I hate to admit it the sour cream is a must! We try to be healthy in this house and cut down on the calories for useless asthetic purposes but the taste with the sour cream is wonderful! Try the fat free sour cream and you can not tell the difference. Will definitely make again with the changes I noted above.

I added 2 gloves garlic and a yam to the recipe, used margarine and veggie broth to make it vegetarian.  Also steamed the squash for 15 min before adding it to the other veggies.  Turned out great.

I took the suggestion about baking the squash and sweet potatoes.  Works great and intensifies the flavors.  I omitted the celery and carrots but added one sweet red apple and what a wonderful and smooth taste it gave to the soup.  Thanks for this recipe.......I'll use it often, I'm sure!

Baking the squash in the oven as suggested definitely makes this easier to prepare even if it takes a bit longer.  I spiced it up with some curry, nutmeg and clove and it was delicious!

This was really good. I baked the squash first. Also didn't add celery cause i didn't want strings in my soup. I cooked the potatoes separately and didn't puree them for a chunky version. My 6 year old had 2 helpings!

This was a great tasting soup.  I followed the recipe, but I roasted the squash in the oven first, and used 1 large sweet potato instead of 2 medium white potatoes.  I used the whole litre of broth to cover the vegetables, and it was extremely thick afterwards, I added 3 cups of water after blending it, and it was a nice consistency after that, and still pretty thick.

We (23 & 10 year old) baked our home grown squash for an hour, peeled it, then added it to the vegetables and broth in the last 15 minutes of simmering. We added ginger which added a nice flavor and also made chicken stock on our own. We made it because our mom had dental surgery and can't chew solid food. Any baby would LOVE this food!!!!Do take potato skins off if it's for a baby.

Delicious soup, but prep time is largely underestimated.  It takes a significant amount of time to chop vegetables especially a butternut squash.

Fabulous!  The lack of herbs and spices lets you really taste the vegetables and the little bit of butter goes a long way.  Healthy and scrumptious, not to mention beautiful!  I too left out the celery per previous reviews and find that it is good with or without a little bit of cayenne.    I also used bouillon cubes instead of canned stock and only used one for the three cups of water I put in.  I think this allows for a more "vegetably" flavor.  Yum!

This was great. I tried it for Thanksgiving dinner this year and my whole family loved it. When I started preparing it I had a table full of skeptics who had never had the soup before. I was trying to replicate a soup I had a few years ago and this one was perfect. It was a little challenge to pill the squash but was well worth the effort. 
******One thing I did different in year 2 was baking the squash first which made peeling a whole lot easier.

Thought the recipe was delicous.  Omitted the celery and white potatoes. Substituted sweet potatoes added cumin, a few red pepper flakes and topped with nutmeg.

Now I know why the sour cream is a must.  Maybe I did something wrong, but my soup had the texture of baby food without the sour cream, although the flavor was very good.  I followed the directions except that I left the celery in big pieces to cook with the other vegetables, and then removed it at the end of cooking.  I did not attempt to puree the celery.

Excellent!!!!  I added all the ingrediants and a teaspoon or so of nutmeg to taste.  A very filling soup when accompanied with a side order of fruit. I've sent this recipe to all my freinds and hope to make it again.

This was a very good base recipe. Based on others' suggestions, we substituted sweet potatoes for regular potates. Added a few cloves of garlic, stirred in a spoonful of sour cream at the end - delicious!!!

This is a great basic recipe for butternut squash soup; the best thing about it is that it leaves a great deal of room for personal creativity!  I cut the squash in half and baked it at 400 for about 20 minutes to facilitate handling, as suggested by another reviewer.  I used one potato, generous amounts of onion, two carrots, omitted the celery (both because I didn't have any, and because I'm not particularly fond of the stuff), and added half a turnip (next time I might add a whole one--I really think the turnip was the making of the soup!).  Because I am experimenting with vegetarian cooking at present, I used veggie stock instead of chicken.  In the way of spices, I used salt and pepper, dried cilantro leaves, cumin, and liberal amounts of curry powder.  Then, as I blended the soup, I added a little milk and a few dollops of plain yoghurt.  Delicious, simple, and, with a slice of homemade whole wheat toast, a hearty autumn meal!

We too found this squash soup to be yummy.  To save time I cut the squash into a few pieces, scooped out the seeds, then microwaved before adding to the soup.  This saved the step of having to peel it...I just cut away the cooked squash from the skin.

This is probably one of the best and easiest soups I have every made. It may just replace my pumpkin curry soup recipe as my favourite. Only adjustment I made was, I had 4 chopped sage leaves.
Yummy!!!!
Made this a second time and replaced the butternut with a hubbard squash, delicious.

Really good tasting and textured soup. I did not have celery so used a leek instead. If you dice the ingredients in to smaller pieces and saute them well the cooking time is drastically reduced 15 mins of boiling.

Fantastic soup! The only misleading part is the amount of time it takes to cut up the raw squash. It took me an hour and ruined my hands.  However, finished product is the favorite of all my roommates and friends!

This was one tasty soup.  I followed the recipe, almost to a tee.  I added a little bit of cream and pured.  A 1/2 tsp of sour cream in each bowl and a bit of chives would make a great appetizer to a sit down meal.  Made this for friends and coworkers and everyone wanted the recipe.  It was a great hit and healthy for you

Another winner! I fixed this soup after dh requested it and he only liked it. He is very picky and honestly, this kind of soup isn't his thing. The fact that I told him it didn't have cream in it made him think it needed it. I never thought I would even like it but I love it. My picky kids even loved it. I did however change a couple of things. I added a sweet potato and for picky dh a block of cream cheese.

Cutting up the raw squash took longer than I expected so next time I might try a cook it a bit first like some have suggested. The end result was very good and I will be making this soup again soon. I served it with bread and topped with red pepper-very filling and satisfying meal.

Because we were eating the soup as a main course I added a cup of navy beans. I used olive oil and added some curry and red pepper flakes at the end. I also didn't puree the soup. It was a hit!

I think I really missed the cream in this soup.  I thought it was a little bland and not rich enough.  I think this might be better served as a gazpacho (just served cold on a hot summer day) because the flavors are so muted.

Great recipe! I used acorn squash because I had it on-hand, and it was still very good. I baked the squash in a dish with a little water for about 20 minutes before attempting to peel and cut. I also added a little bit of molasses to sweeten it up some. My husband loved it.

Great basic recipe--I left out the celery since I don't care for it and substituted sweet potatoes.  Would give it 5 stars except it takes a while to prep.  I added some thyme, rosemary, sauteed garlic, and bay leaves and was rewarded with a rich soup base.  I've still got it simmering on the stove--it's better each time I taste it!  I may even reheat the leftovers tomorrow and throw in some spinach and chicken!  Thanks for the incredible base!

This soup was wonderful.  Very filling and healthy too!  It also freezes well.  I may experiment with seasoning next time and add a little less onion. Thank you!

Very balanced soup--flavors do not compete.  Smooth texture.  Delicious!  Was going to try another Butternut Squash Soup recipe sometime to compare, but after tasting this one, and noticing the fat content in other recipes, why mess up a good thing?  This is great!

I was looking for a healthy, low fat/ calorie food.  To drop calories, I didn't use potatoes.  Turned out wonderful!  I added all the broth at once.  If you want it thicker, just keep cooking until more liquid has evaporated.  Nice meal with a sandwich or salad.  Only 68 calories a cup!  I  bought another squash when the soup was gone because I had cravings for more.  Thanks for sharing your simple & tasty recipe Krista!

I was skeptical at first but this is a Great soup! Lots of flavor and the blending of it (I used my food processor) makes it creamy and smooth which I love. Thanks!

Like just about everyone else, I did make a few changes/additions. I used veggie stock instead of chicken stock. I changed out 1 white potato for 1 sweet potato. Used an immersion/stick blender...so much easier to purée the veggies in the pot. Definitely added some cinnamon, nutmeg, garlic, red pepper, curry, and turmeric to spice it up, then simmered. It was yummy and smelled so good! My husband has had three bowls so far, a record for him I think. Next time, no white potatoes - only sweet potatoes...and I’m going to try adding that Apple too!

Loved this dish. Super easy to make- I'm 16 and get overwhelmed fairly easily, but this was like a walk in the park. I added shredded chicken, used pumpkin instead of butternut squash,  added another onion, garlic, more celery, and more carrots. My goal with this soup was to make something very hearty, with lots of veggies for my mom, who is recovering from surgery. This was a great meal to make, and I will definitely be doing this again. I also had it with garlic bread, which made for a very nice meal. I would recommend adding more veggies to it.

Took this to a Christmas luncheon and it a huge hit! Everyone was asking for my receipe.  I did make the recommended spice additions (minced garlic, curry, cinnamon, nutmeg and red pepper flakes.) My squash must have been bigger than the receipe called for because I had a crockpot full (much more than 4 servings) so the amount of spices  increased from what I saw in other comments. I also used vegetable broth instead of chicken and a sweet potato as that's what I had on hand.  I had croutons and  sour cream for those that wanted. My husband isn't a squash soup person but he even said it was really good. I will be making this again!

Added half of a carrot and celery more.  Used one big rustic potatoe. Accidentally Fell asleep for 2 and a half hours but woke up and turns out that was prefect ?? Delish. 
Tip: never follow the seasoning directly, season according to taste.

Best butternut squash soup I’ve made yet! Tbh, I haven’t really made that much yet but def best out of like 6. Either way I want to thank all of you veteran kitchen artists for your input and recipe enhancements. They are such a help to a kitchen novice such as myself. I combined all of your suggestions and used what I had. Which was no carrots, no celery. 1 potato, 1 yellow onion, a Giant b-squash, added the pinches of curry, nutmeg, and a good shake of cinnamon, and a good drizzling of 1/2 & 1/2. Roasted an hour, simmered for a half hour in a stock pot, whipped with hand blender. Omg. The best. First time I ever won at winging it. Topped with toasted sour dough baguette slices, sour cream dollop, and cinnamon. Mmmm!

The original recipe seemed incredibly bland and reading the reviews I decided to make some changes.  I put the original ingredients in, minus the celery, but without the butter.  Left those on the stove, and after the vegetables were mostly cooked, added cinnamon, nutmeg, a little bit of curry powder, and a little bit of chili pepper powder.  I cooked it until the vegetables were falling apart by themselves, then used a potato masher to finish the job instead of blending it, and then adding heavy cream to turn it from a puree into a soup.  Without the changes, I honestly think this wouldn't have been edible.  But with the changes it's probably a 4 star recipe.  If I were to do it again, I would exchange potato for sweet potato, leave the carrots out, and do more butternut squash with the same spices.  This is a better sweet soup than savory.

This is a delicious soup made just as the recipe is written. For those if you that made so many changes, and as one person said it was 'salvageable' post your recipe with your name on it. Otherwise, pass by it without insulting the original post.

I'm rating the recipe, not the food. when you use vague terms like medium this and large that, everything is open to interpretation. I learned that my one potato and one onion and one squash must have been huge, as there was far too much produce to go around and there was no way 2tbsp of butter and a sauce pan was going to tenderise all of that. What I did to save it and this bland recipe: added bayleaf, added sea salt,  added crushed red pepper. prepared stock separately, and poured hot stock over the food before boiling until tender. I removed the bayleaf and then blended. I may add a pinch of paprika or some such for a more rustic flavor.

Double the butter. Double The carrots. More butternut squash, about 3-4x the bulk of the potatoes. I used almost 48oz of chicken broth. I also took the suggestion of baking the squash first, 400 degrees for an hour and pierced with a fork. Then I left the cooked squash sitting in the fridge for 4 or 5 days before I made the soup, because life happens. It was delicious without adding any seasoning, so I took half of it to my parents who are on a sodium restricted diet. The other half I decided to season lightly with salt and cayenne pepper. It definitely took the flavor up a notch!

We made this using organic butternut squash.
First cut and remove seeds, (add butter and salt to those. Roast those later at 350° for 30-40 minutes) brush on olive oil, roast face up at 400° for 60 minutes, peel off skin, slice.
We used 1 small onion, mince this very tiny and one clove garlic, pressed. We sauteed those in the butter sauce and, once cooked through, added in the sliced squash and cooked for about 5 more minutes. Then we added 3/4 of a container of chicken stock. When the soup was finished I turned off the heat and added 1/2 cup of heavy whipping cream and a large splash of half and half. We then added 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon, a sprinkle of nutmeg, salt and pepper. I used a potato masher to mash up all the ingredients in the stock pan and did not use a blender at all. Very satisfying, yummy, and fun for a cold evening or Reformation day.
(We did not use potatoes, celery, or carrots in this recipe. Just the ingredients listed above.)

Excellent soup! I only used one of those halved, peeled and cleaned butternut squashes, and it worked fine.  I saw comments about bland, so after it simmered, I added a few tsps of jarred garlic,  and small amounts of cinnamon, nutmeg, cayenne pepper and a tblsp of brown sugar. The salt and pepper are really needed here. I put the broth in to cover the vegetables, not realizing later that I was short 8 oz of it. That's why it came out more like the consistency of baby-food squash after I put it through my blender. I was almost going to add milk, etc, but I liked it the way it was. Usually I make pumpkin soup in the fall months, but I really like the mellowness of this soup. A delicious and healthy keeper! Thank you for the recipe!

Definitely like this recipe considering most of the vegetables came right out of the garden :). I did modify the recipe, however, by adding the following:1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp allspice, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, and 1/4 tsp ground ginger. Top notch for my taste buds!

Like others, I made some substitutions. I used 32 oz of pre-cut butternut squash, a carrot, a sweet potato, an onion, and two cloves of garlic for the base. After sautéing the veggies in a large pot and adding in the chicken stock, I also added in a teaspoon of garam masala and a dash of cinnamon, plus a healthy sprinkling of red pepper flakes because I prefer some heat. This soup was amazing and didn't even need sour cream to add in flavor. I think the garam masala added a great flavor balance since the veggies are all fairly sweet.

This is a great base for an amazing soup! First of all I used one sweet potato instead of the 2 regular potato's. I cut the butternut squash in half placed each half face down in a pan and cooked them at 375 degrees F for 1 hour. Tip add a little water to the pan and the squash will become very moist. I also added 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon curry powder, a dash of nutmeg, 2 garlic cloves, and finally some cilantro. After everything was simmered beautifully together I used an electric mixer instead of a hand puree mixer. I did this so it wouldn't come out too creamy since I like some little chunks in my soup. I served it with parmesan bread and a little parmesan sprinkled on the top of the soup. With these simple modifications it came out PERFECT and it will definitely fill a hungry stomach!

This is an excellent base which I've played with a few times to find my perfect recipe. For my absolute favourite result I used: one potato, no carrots, no celery. For spices I added some cinnamon, cayenne pepper and garam masala.

This is a great basic recipe. It's super easy and provides 5 generous bowls of soup. One note: the spices are missing, so you have to experiment a bit. I added garlic powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, and a generous amount of black pepper. It is definitely bland if you don't add some flair. I didn't have it on hand, but I suspect rosemary would go well. I also added a 1/2 of whole milk at the end as a thickening agent, and I'm pleased with the final result.

What a fun soup! I have a VitaMix and that made blending it up at the end really easy. I did however add a couple cloves of Garlic, 2 tablespoons of Curry and about a cup of cream to it and topped it off with some bacon and parsley. I found it to turn out really yummy and will be making it again soon! Thanks!!!

So yummy! I followed the reviews and microwaved the squash separately for 20 min and cooked everything else separately as listed. Microwaving the squash made it super easy to scoop out because cutting the squash raw seemed a little difficult. I also added some paprika and red pepper for a bit of spice. Making again for sure.

I changed it up a bit. 
I used olive oil instead of butter.
I added finely chopped garlic and I finely chopped my celery.
I also added a finely chopped apple instead of one potato.
I used a pinch of curry, dash of nutmeg and ginger.
I also used vegetable stock or broth instead of chicken, because I'm on a diet. 
Instead of cream, I used coconut milk (full fat).
I also roasted my squash before hand. 

OMGoodness!!! Soooooo good!

It was my first time making butternut soup. I took the advice of others and made the following changes. I left out the celery, not too fond of it anyway. Added a sweet potatoe, 1/4 tsp cinnamon and pinch of nutmeg. Also put a dollop of lite sour cream once served and it was delicious.  It is definitely an autumn soup that I will be enjoying throughout the season.

So easy to make, just needs some prep time. Made a few changes: I also roasted the squash for an hour to get it soft and get that flavor I like. Also skipped the celery and added a clove of garlic. Then I swapped out the potatoes for mushrooms. So yummy!

A simple, quick soup to prepare. I don't like a strong squash soup, so I use extra carrot. I goofed and added the broth before I sautéed the celery and onion, so I just boiled the soup a little longer to ensure everything was well cooked.  I added a pinch of red pepper flake, some thyme when I blended it, and a dollop of sour cream when I served it.  Freezes well.

This is a very simple, healthy soup!  I made it according to recipe (i did replace the butter with olive oil) then added a bit of cinnamon & fresh ginger!  Instead of the sour cream suggested by many we used Soft Goat Cheese at serving time!!! OH YUM! Great for leftovers so make lots!

I make this all the time. I do make some changes, including using sweet potato rather than white and leaving out the celery. I love a dollop of sour cream in mine, my husband and kids prefer it without.  Also, I never chop the squash uncooked. I throw the whole thing (along with the sweet potato) in the oven at 350 for an hour then just discard the seeds and scoop out the flesh.

Follow the recipe but use veg broth and sweet potatoes instead.  Also add 2 T garlic, 1 cup of diced mushrooms and 1/2 cup of nutritional yeast for added flavor depth.  If you are a vegetarian or vegan you cash also add 1/2 of wheat gluten to increase the protein content.

Easy and delicious!  Easy to make in crock pot or on stove top.  Added 5 ml (1 tsp) sage as well as 1 chopped granny smith apple.  Some family members added a bit of cream.

I followed the recipe as written, and my husband and I thought it was wonderful.  It was very flavorful, filling and best of all.....healthy.  With the forecast for cold temperatures this weekend, I plan to make this again.  Great comfort food!

I've made this several times now, and it's delicious.  The only changes that I made were to use sweet potatoes instead of white,  organic vegetable stock (in a carton) and added curry powder to taste.  Made it for company, and everyone enjoyed it. Nice, hearty soup.

I would say that this is a good base recipe. Prepared as written, I find it to be on the bland side. I added cinnamon, nutmeg, a pinch of cloves and some heavy cream. I would consider making it with sweet potato, as some others have suggested or even adding an apple to sweeten it up a little.

Made this today...keep going back for more. I read numerous reviews and decided to add one regular potato, one carrot, one clove garlic and a sweet onion. Baked the butternut squash with olive oil, salt and pepper at 400 degrees f for about 45 min. Took out when tender. Sautéed small diced potato, carrot and onion (no celery). Added squash once potato mixture was starting to turn light brown. Added chicken broth and simmered till ready to purée. After puréed added a splash of half and half to thin a bit. Used another reviewers advice 1/2 tsp curry powder, 1/4 tsp cinnamon and dash I'd nutmeg. Tried without sour cream was good but better with. Enjoy!!

I modified the recipe a bit but absolutely loved it! I used sweet potatoes instead of regular, I doubled the carrots and added a can of drained corn. I also added cumin, fresh ginger and a dash of cayenne to give it a kick. I also only pureed half the soup as others suggested which made the texture perfect.

I have never made anything with butternut squash before, so I was a little nervous, but it turned out wonderful.  I did take other reviewers recommendation and roasted the butternut squash at 400 in the oven for about an hour.  Then cut it in half, removed the seeds, and scooped out the flesh.  I also precooked the potato in the microwave to cut down on the time cooking on top of the stove.  
As far as spices, I used salt, pepper, curry and some chili pepper to give it some flavor.  It was actually best the next day...after everything had time to meld.  My husband and kids liked it best with sour cream mixed in.  I had it as is and loved it.

Delicious, easy recipe. Took the advice of previous posts and put the entire squash in the oven at 375 degrees for 1 hour. It was easy to cut and peel after that. I did not add potatoes or carrots. I Sautéed onions and mushrooms, added the squash, and seasoned all with salt, pepper, nutmeg, minced garlic, dash of ground cloves and red pepper. Added the chicken stock and brought it all to a boil. Puréed it in the blender and it came out tasting really great! Comparable to what you'd get at a high-end restaurant. I added a dollop of sour cream when serving but I don't think it needed it. I thought it was more flavorful without it. Shredded parmasian cheese, however, was a tasty topper.

Love that there is no cream in this recipe! One reviewer mentioned it was bland like any recipe salt and pepper to taste. I substituted a parsnip for a potato for additional flavor. Additionally, I do not add celery. I don't sautee the onions I just throw everything in and bring to a boil. If you are going to make this often invest in a submersion blender, inexpensive and well worth it!

As is, this recipe is NOT GOOD but then again maybe butternut squash is not for me! I agree with some simple changes such as adding a bit of cinnamon, nutmeg and curry and using only 1 potato it could be delicious but it is a different recipe!!!

I really enjoyed this soup! Next time I think I will be adding more spices (curry etc,) but overall it was excellent. 

Another tip for peeling butternut squash: use a cheese grater! - some shapes might work better than others, but I have a convex shaped cheese grater and it worked great.

I made this with an extra tablespoon of butter and no potatoes and it is delish. This is a very fresh veggie version but if you want some punch add some fresh ground ginger.

This is one of the best butternut soups I've made. I tweaked it a little by adding a clove of garlic, minced and a pinch of red pepper chili flakes. Just a pinch though, because they give it a bit of zing. My husband loves soups with meat in them so I fried a couple strips of bacon till they were crispy and then cut them into small pieces and just added the bacon to the individual bowls of soup. Very good!

This was my first "scratch soup" I've ever made...extremely easy and better than a 5* restaurant. I'm new to the kitchen, and found this very tasty for a first-timer. It definitely needs a little more pizazz like garlic and cinnamon. Blending the soup is the key to making the ingredients smooth. A bowl of this stuff is about $10 in my area restaurants, it's a keeper!

YUMMY, this is recipe is so easy and very delicious. I was thinking that I might add half and half after it was finished,  but after tasting it , no way it is perfect as it is without any dairy. I made exactly as stated it is perfect! I will make it again for sure.

I just made this soup today. Loved the video step by step. It makes it so simple. The soup is awesome I did add a few spices while it  was simmering.  1/8 tsp of allspice ,ginger,cayenne pepper, and pumpkin pie spice. 

Thank you never made soup before until now. Will make again.

Loved this recipe! My very first time making butternut soup so I took to reading the reviews first, I decided to add Garlic as well as some Cinnamon, Nutmeg and Paprika to my pot half-way during simmering; some Coriander just before it's done and finishing off with a splash of cream, it was such remarkable crowd pleaser! Will definitely be making this again and again. Definitely one to keep

I combined 2 Butternut Squash Soup recipes. Roasted 2 medium squash with 2 cloves garlic for about 45 minutes.  Meanwhile sautéed small onion, a carrot, a stalk celery in about 2 TB butter. Add salt. Let that sauté on low for about 15 minutes. Peeled and sliced thinly a potato and an apple. Added to veggies. Scooped the squash into pot along with roasted garlic. Then added chicken stock to cover plus about 1/2 cup apple cider. Brought to a boil and simmered for about 1/2 hour. Added little nutmeg and cayenne.  Added about 2 ounces lite cream cheese. Stirred till melted. Used immersion blender till smooth and creamy. Correct seasonings. I ended up adding about another 1/3 cup apple cider and little salt. Really yummy!

I roasted the squash first so it would be easy to peel. Other than that, I followed all other directions and did not change or omit any of the ingredients.  Very flavourful.

This soup was very good.  I cooked two minced garlic cloves with the onion, celery, etc.  I added a pinch of dill weed and some hot pepper flakes to give it a kick.  I only had two carrot sticks in the fridge, but it was fine with just that.  I bought pre-peeled, pre-cut butternut squash, which made it easy.

This recipe is sooo good! I use sweet potato instead of regular potato. I don't think it needs sour cream. Just some garlic and I have tried with some curry too which is nice, but not necessary.  I also bake the squash first which makes it way less prep. I don't dice anything, just cut in chunks and simmer for an hour.  It should be soft enough when blended.  Super quick, healthy and easy. Hubby and little guy absolutely loves it.

Made this today and definitely felt that it was bland. I added some garlic powder (would sautée one fresh clove next time), paprika, curry and cayenne pepper. 
To those who are considering a fellow reviewed suggestion to use a hand mixer: don't do it! I thought it was a genius idea but even with little soup in a large pot, soup splattered all over me and my stove!! The lid only contained a bit of the mess. I'll definitely use the blender next time.

I liked this soup! I think the potatoes make all the difference.  I added garlic and plenty of salt.  I agree that celery doesn't puree well but it's not that hard to remove the "strings" from a stalk--I wouldn't omit it.  I think it's important to use good stock.

Very yummy! My first try at this soup and it was a success.  I added some cinnamon,  left out the celery (can't stand it!), and roasted the squash in the oven first - split,  rubbed with olive oil and sea salt  - for an hour first. I also added sour cream at the end. Delicious!

Subbed 1 potatoe for a sweet potato. Very good consistency. Followed recipe exact otherwise.  Needs a bit more spice. Next time add some curry, nutmeg.

I added garlic, more onions, caramelize the onions, less carrot, I used a few shakes of Pensey's Florida Blend of tellicherry Indian black peppercorns cracked with hot chili peppers and their Tuscan Sunset herb blend but now I wish I tried curry powder and a little cardamon on 1/2 the batch.  Not allowed to have any dairy right now so I cheated with the small amount of butter (in a serving) and held on to be able to avoid my two favorites next to my wife...Ms. Cream Cheese or Ms. Sour Cream.  I'm not sure how that ended last time but my pillow and pajamas were a mess.  We loved this soup on the Red Lunar eclipse and just in time for Sucote, the Fall harvest festival.  Be imaginative with your spices.  This recipe is a great place to play with spices or let your friends play individually at the table!

I did not have potatoes or carrots, INSTEAD I used cubed squash and two good sized sweet potatoes.  It was fantastic, and I think the sweet potatoes took care of the sweetness of a carrot and the consistency of potatoes (which imo don't add a tremendous amount of flavor anyway).  Better substitute I thought.  Sour cream is a great addition with just a shake or two of curry powder.  Great recipe!!

I've yet to try this recipe, but am about to use a butternut squash, grown in our garden. Last time I made pumpkin soup, the recipe called for the addition of garlic, omitted potato, but added a spoonful of maple syrup. The result was amazingly good. Can't find that recipe in time for lunch today, but am going to try to replicate it from memory. Seriously, do try adding the maple syrup instead of the nutmeg.

This benefits from adding some spices. I added small amounts of ginger, cinnamon and garlic. You can cut down on cooking time by steaming the potatoes ( I only used 1) and onions and squash  in the broth, then pureeing when soft. I left out the celery also and didn't miss it. Was quite delicious served with a few croutons for crunch. It also works well with vegetable broth for vegetarians!

This is an excellent soup.  The only change I made was to use celery leaves instead of the celery so no stringy stuff and keeps the flavor.

I agree that it is a bit bland. Try more onion, 1 clove garlic, minced , and 1/2 tsp curry and 1/3 c dry vermouth to really pick up the flavor. I serve this to guests frequently through the Fall and winter. Rich, creamy and yummy!

Excellent!! I cooked a few garlic cloves with the onions and added pumpkin pie spice at the end. It was amazing.

This recipe was great as written.  Very satisfying.  I didn't change a thing, but I think my husband thought it was going to be more like a stew.  Next time I think I will remove half of the veggies at the end of the cooking time, use the immersion blender on the remaining contents of the pot, and then add back in the reserved chunks.  To make it even healthier, I'll use coconut oil instead of butter, sweet potatoes instead of white and vegetable stock instead of chicken.  I hope it turns out as good as this!

Very Good!
I used 1 box of chicken broth & 1 box of beef broth and added a clove of garlic. It was delicious (not bland), and I will definitely make it again.
Try putting everything in a slow cooker on low for 8hrs, then blending with an immersion blender.  Easy & freezes well!

I changed it just a little. First of all i did a double receipe. Used vegetable broth ( we have a vegetarian in the household...) Added a pinch of cumin and of garlic powder( next time I am adding 1 clove or 2 of garlic). I did not transfer veggies to mash them. I used my immersion blender to blend everything at around 37 or 40 minutes of cook time. Added a spash of cream as I was blending everything and left it an other 10 or 15 minutes on the stove.... The 10 people I had that night for dinner raved about it. they might have not licked their bowl clean but they certainly scrapped every bit of the soup that was left in their bowl with baguette... Thank you MapleBird for that awsome receipe.

Absolutely delicious!  Pairs nice with balsamic glaze!  If you have a powerful blender (I use a Kitchenaid) there's no need to peel the veges (if you buy organic).  The skins have the highest concentration of nutrients and a powerful blender will really pulverize them - you won't even know they were ever on!

Took the advice of other reviews and roasted the butternut squash and sweet potato first. Also  wrapped an onion 2 carrots and a stalk of celery in tin foil with a little garlic infused olive oil and roasted it beside them halfway through cooking time and added everything together to the stock. The rest was just as the recipe stated with a liberal dash of cinnamon to spice it up. Delish !!! Definitely a keeper and with homemade crusty bread as a side a nutritious late night snack for partying teenagers .

Truthfully, I had never cooked with butter nut squash before, so I wasn't ever sure we would like it. I didn't have any celery, but was also roasting fresh asparagus, so I just threw those stems in instead. I use my immersion blender to purée it all & it was really pretty good,

Great Soup!  However I did follow suggestions from other reviews and omitted the potato and cooked the squash whole in the oven before peeling and mashing it for the soup (so much easier than cutting a raw squash!!).  I also added 1/2 tsp curry powder, 1/4 tsp cinnamon, a dash of nutmeg, and 1-2 cloves garlic to the sauteeing veggies before adding the stock and then the squash.  Finally, I don't have a full size blender so I just mashed the squash and added it to the soup and we still liked it!  Definitely not a "creamy" texture if that's what you want, but still very tasty!

This is a great base recipe that you could mold to fit your desires. I went ahead and cubed the squash raw, and will probably end up baking it if I have time on the next go around. I used veggie broth instead of chicken. I wasn't able to add celery so I just doubled the carrot and also added about 2 tsp of ground sage. I'm sure you could add any herb/spice of your choice and it would be yummy.

Delicious simple recipe for a newbie to butternut squash soup! I added an 1/8 tsp cayenne, 1/8 tsp nutmeg and 1/4 tsp cinnamon based on other reviews and it added the perfect amount of spice w/o overpowering the delicious squash. I can't wait to make it again!

Years later, and this recipe is still making its way into good cooks' notebooks and card files! I followed this recipe very closely, with only a change in the chicken stock. I essentially concentrated that flavor by taking 16 oz water and using about 1.5 tablespoons (T.) natural chicken stock/bouillon. This added salt, so I didn't add that at the end. I'd seen other reviewers mention the recipe was bland, so I added a teeny dash of paprika, cumin, turmeric and garlic powder...very, very little. It blended down to the consistency of puree or baby food, which we really like (real 'stick-to-your-ribs soup'), adding a little water after blending to make it the thickness we like. The soup had a ton of flavor and I doubt I even needed those extra spices. Definitely a keeper...will make this again...and again...and again...!!

We were blessed with an abundance of butternut and acorn squash this year.  I was so excited to try this recipe. My husband and I both loved the flavor.  We added some minced garlic and some curry.  It was thick and wonderful! We will eat this again.

I didn't think I'd like squash soup, but I really enjoyed this one! I picked this recipe for freezing purposes. I roasted the squash first for easy peeling and cubing. I only used 1 potato to prevent a mealy taste when its warmed back up.I also chose it because it doesn't have a dairy base so no worries about the dairy separating during freezing or adding dairy when re-heating. My photo is a shot of the soup before blending.

This recipe was great.  Added some nutmeg and ginger.  The product is very thick and a little extra water might help.  If you wish to add extra broth  perhaps the low salt variety would be best.

okay, first time I made this, thought it was great except I felt the taste of celery was a bit too much.  And it was exceptionally thick.  So this time, I reduced the celery to four stalks, added another cup of chopped squash to compensate, increased the chicken broth by a cup, and for our taste, increased the curry to 3 tsp instead of two.  Did not do the bacon either time as we are vegetarian but this time, the soup is fabulous.  Might tweak again next time, who knows.  But a great recipe overall.

I edited this recipe by using 1/2 chicken stock and half skim milk.  I did not have a potato but used a tomato and diced mango, instead.  I added a pinch of crushed red pepper, a pinch of Chinese five spice, the juice and zest of half of a lime, a shake or two of Mrs. Dash salt free seasoning, a pinch of rubbed sage.  I made these changes due to going away and needing to do a fridge clean out beforehand.  The soup was gone in one sitting.

Never making butternut soup I thought this recipe was basic and the finished product would probably just be average. It was incredible. I doubled the recipe and the soup was all gone within a day. The only extra I added was a half teaspoon of pumpkin spice. Am making it again to freeze down for the cold winter days. My family rated it an 11 out of 10.

What I like most about this recipe was it's simplicity. I didn't contain any exotic ingredients that where not already stocked in my kitchen. I added come crumbled turkey bacon as a garnish which complimented the soup perfectly. My rating is for the soup alone.

I just made this today and it is Wonderful I did a few changes... I roasted the Butternut Squash, onion, and 3 cloves of garlic first.  I did not have celery but used 2 carrots and 1/2 a sweet potato.  It turned out so smooth and creamy the sour cream does complete the soup.  Very easy to make and will make this a lot!!  Maybe try a bit of crisp pancetta on top??

HOLY MOLY this dish is delicious!!  Of course, I made mine with sweet potatoes... so it may have been more sweet than expected.  But none-the-less, this will be added to my regular repertoire of winter comfort foods!

Awesome. I used acorn squash instead and added 1 teaspoon of garlic, paprika and curry. Amazing. Even my 9 yr old LOVED IT and my husband told me he'd rather have a 2nd bowl instead of chicken

I can't get over how delicious this soup is!  I baked the squash as I do not like to chop.  Caramelized the onions before adding the potatoes and carrots (I omitted the celery). And added the recommended 2 cloves minced garlic, 1/2 tsp curry, 1/4 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp cayenne, and a dash of nutmeg.  Blended about 3/4 of the batch to have some chunks.  So good!

I really Enjoyed this recipe!  After reading the reviews, I made some modifications to the original.

I did not use celery. I did not sautee the vegetables in butter. I cut up the butternut squash, baby carrots and a medium to large sweet potato and put them in a baking dish, drizzled them with olive oil and roasted them on 450 for 1 hour.

Once the vegetables were done, I sauteed a medium sweet onion and one clove of garlic in olive oil. Just until the onions were soft. I added the roasted vegetables, onions, garlic and chicken broth in a large stock pot. I added nutmeg, black pepper and cinnamon.

I simmered until vegetables were truly soft then pureed in a blender (well, my ninja, but you get the idea!). The soup can be as thick or thin as you like, just add more chicken broth and seasonings as needed.

I served with a dollop of sour cream and was totally surprised at how delicious it was!

Thanks so much for posting this recipe!  I've been trying to figure out more ways to incorporate vegetables into my diet!

This soup makes a great base for being creative! I added curry, garlic, an apple, replaced the regular potato for 1 sweet. I had baked the squash in the oven prior, and after pureeing all of the soup together I added an extra bit of squash in it's natural form - I think it added a more interesting texture to the soup. I've been eating it with cashew bits mixed in, yummmm !

True, I didn't follow the ingredients list to the "t". However, having followed suggestions from other reviewers, this yielded a VERY delicious soup that will definitely be worth remaking. I omitted the potatoes and celery. When cooking the vegetables (squash, carrots, and onion) in butter, I added a tablespoon of minced garlic. Once the vegetables had 5 or so minutes on the heat, I added 4 cups of chicken broth, 1 tsp cinnamon, a dash nutmeg, a pinch of curry (just to bring out the complimentary spices, there is no real hint of curry in the final product), 1/4 cup of spiced rum (I used Captain Morgan's Tattoo), and 1/2 cup of half and half.  Everything else I followed according to the recipe. I had a bowl with a dollop of sour cream, and then one without. The difference is negligible. My husband just finished licking his second bowl clean.
UPDATE:: So this is the second time I've made this soup, and here are the following changes I made. Split a butternut squash in half, put em in a bowl over about half an inch of water, and microwaved for 15 mins to soften. Into the stockpot, I threw in a sweet potato with the carrot, onion, and squash. Added 3 cloves of garlic, the same spices I used last time, except for the rum, and half and half. Delicious, and I think even better than last time.
UPDATE AGAIN:: We have a blizzard going outside so I thought I'd whip this up with what I had on hand. 4 Tbsp butter, 16 oz package of frozen butternut squash, 1 onion, 1 red delicious apple, 3

This soup was fantastic. I used a large sweet potato instead of 2 medium regular potatoes. I also added garlic, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cayenne pepper. My husband loved this soup and this is normally something he would not care for. Loved it!

I make this one about once a month in the winter time.  We can buy assorted squash "for soup" cut up in the grocery store, so I have made it with all kinds of squash.  I always make it according the recipe, but I add bacon bits at the end.  I've also served it in Italian bread bowls from this site, which my kids thought was cool.

I doubled this recipe and made a few small changes.  I cut my squash in half and filled the hollow end with butter, salt and pepper.  Then I roasted it in the oven until it was tender.  I cooked the potatoes, onion celery and carrots  in butter as directed and added the roasted squash  to the mix when it was almost done.  Then I substituted 1/4 of the chicken broth for approximately 3 cups of 2 percent milk.  The milk gave it a very nice smooth texture and the extra liquid thinned it a bit.  My family loved it!

This was utterly amazing. I didn't have celery so I skipped it. Also, I followed other reviews and roasted the squash first. It wasn't quite done in the time they said, so I added about 10 mins in the microwave in an inch of water. I didn't blend the sauce, because I like chunks. And when I reheated it for round 2!, I added more broth because it had been absorbed. Both times it tasted absolutely divine. Thanks!!!

I'm so glad I found this recipe!  I tried it because I saw the video, just a few ingredients and it looked easy.  This is my very 1st time making homemade soup and I'm glad I tried this one first. I'm not even a butternut squash lover but I tried a good soup at work and wanted to see if I can duplicate it.  Well I did!  I used every ingredient that was listed, the only thing I added was cinnamon and nutmeg to give me that sweetness I was looking for it and worked!  I'm so proud of myself - thanks for the recipe!

I received a large butternut squash in a box of organic produce, and found this recipe to make last night. I made some of the suggested adjustments - instead of the suggested veggies, I used one small carrot, one sweet potato, half of a large yellow onion, and a clove of garlic. I also poked holes in the squash, and roasted it for 40 minutes of 400 degrees before peeling. After using my immersion blender (which, in cases like this is a godsend!), I found it to be a little bland. I salted, peppered, nutmegged, and cayenned, but it still wasn't quite as flavorful as I'd like. That's where the sour cream saved the day. I added a few dollops to the pot to thicken it up a bit, as well as one in each bowl after serving. It was AMAZING. Sweet, spicy, and tart, all at once! I'm reheating some tonight for dinner!

Wonderful!!!    I added diced garlic, I used one large sweet potato.   I also finely chopped the celery, then  during the last 10 minutes on simmer I added nutmeg, cayenne, and a pinch of curry as suggested by other reviewers.  I blended right in the pan with wire type attachments since the normal ones made a mess, and I left it slightly lumpy.   With a dollop of sour cream, it was wonderful!  Will be a favorite!

This was fantastic! I have never made soup from squash before, and I'm so glad I tried it! And even though I hate it when people do this, due to the high amount of reviews that included slight changes, I altered it some myself. First, I baked the squash at 400 degrees for 1 hour. I also put a whole head of garlic with the top trimmed about 1/4 of an inch on the same pan with the squash, drizzled it with olive oil, and roasted it for about 20 minutes. I used vegetable broth in place of chicken broth so my vegetarian sister could eat it, and I used a whole medium sized onion. I didn't think that it would be necessary to brown the vegetables beforehand, so I just let everything simmer together. Lastly, I roasted a jalapeno on the stovetop, removed half the seeds, minced it and added it to the soup in the last 20 or so minutes of cooking time. This soup was sooo good. The roasted garlic added a slight extra sweetness, and the jalapeno was just enough to give it a slight heat, not overwhelming. I sprinkled my bowl with a little parmesan cheese, and it was the perfect cold-night meal. Thank you!

This recipe is so simple, you don't have to look it up every time you make it. We highly recommend using sweet potatoes instead of white potatoes. Salt and pepper were all it needed when serving. Everyone raved about it. Since the first try, we've added a pinch of curry, or any of the other suggestions that appealed to us. It turns out wonderful every time. We found this to be the perfect winter-time comfort food.

Soooo much better than any soup you can buy!  As other reviews suggested, I skipped the celery and switched the regular potato with a sweet potato.  One batch I added an acorn squash too, and it turned out great.  Next time I'm going to try shallots instead of onion...my opinion is that most great recipes are also very forgiving. :-)

My family loved this. I doubled the recipe for left overs. I disagree with reviews that left out the celery, I felt it really gives it layers of flavor.  I added 1 tbls of curry powder and 1teaspoon of garlic to the sauté. I also added 1/2 cup of fat free 1/2 & 1/2 right before serving.  Delish!!

Followed recipe but added a few extras like others noted.  I did roast my squash - it was easy enough  - just poked with a fork and roasted 2 small squash for about 45 min.  at 400 degrees.  Meanwhile I cut up the rest of the vegetables.  I had some small leeks on hand (about 4) so I added them as well to the mixture.  I added the broth a little at a time and did not need all 36 ounces - depends how thick you like it.  I also omitted the celery - didn't notice it missing - and only 1 medium potato - did not let them brown to avoid turning the soup color.    I added a pinch of curry, nutmeg and cinnamon.  Many offered that it was still bland - but don't forget you should always salt and pepper your food as you go.  It was awesome - biggest critics - my kids and the neighbors kids - out of 7 kids - 4  LOVED it - others said OK Hubby loved it too!  - I say that is a hit!

This was delicious... Just a few changes after reading the reviews though kudo's to Maplebird...great recipe.
I used 1 medium potato instead of 2
2 carrots instead of 1. 
 I sauted the onion in half butter half canola/olive oil.  
4 Cups of water to 6 teas. chicken boullion. 
I added 1/2 t. garam masala (quality curry powder) 
1/4 t. cinnamon, dash nutmeg 
1/4 - 1/2 teas. of cayenne pepper
Simply Delicious :)

The ingredients listed above is a good starter for adding other things to make it your own.  I made it as directed but at the end I added 1/4 cup of heavy whipping cream and 1/8 teaspoon of cinnamon.  Very GOOD!!!

This recipe is a good start. I used about half as much potato, and it perfectly thickened it without overshadowing the squash. Added some minced fresh garlic while sauteeing. Then I used vegetable broth instead of chicken (personal preference) and a cinammon stick during the simmering. It came out fantastic! Just needed some extra flavor.

Make this all the time now.  I throw in two apples along with all the vegetables.  Sometimes I use cinnamin and nutmeg to flavor as well.  I cook the squash in the microwave as a previous poster stated.  8 min per half face down with a little water on the plate.

Super Duper Easy to make! I baked the whole squash (not cut) in the oven at 400c for 1 hour with an inch of water at the bottom of the pan and after baked I peeled the skin away and chopped into cubes putting them in a pot with chicken broth, sweet potato yam and all sorts of spices (nutmeg, salt, pepper, all spice, cinnamon). I let it boil and then simmered on low for 1 hour. I then blended the whole lot with sour cream and voila! Delicious!!! Thanks a mil! Perfect for a Stormy Hurricane Sandy night!

YUMMY! ! ! I just finished making this recipe, it is VERY good.  I did not add the potatoes to minimize the starch, used vegtable stock and roasted the squash first.  I will be making this throughout the winter...YUM!  Can't wait for the rest of the family to sit down for dinner tonight. Great recipe...thank you for sharing...

I made this recipe combined with another recipe. The main differences is I didn't use any potato and added marjoram. When pureeing I added homemade soft goat cheese (the other recipe called for cream cheese). It was heavenly! We had the leftovers the next night and it was even better reheated. 
This will be a fall favorite recipe.

Used a lot of suggestions from others, sweet potatoes instead of potatoes, celery seed instead of celery, and added some minced garlic, cayenne pepper, nutmeg, and curry powder.  Served with a little sour cream and toasted pumpkin seeds for the season!

Fabulous recipe.  However I used many of the comments recommendations. I used 1 sweet potato, 2 tsp minced garlic, 1/2 tsp curry, 1/4 tsp of cinnamon and dash of nutmeg. I also reserved about 1 1/2 cups of the soup to thin the consistency and this leaves some chunks.  The rest I blended then added the reserve and got a wonderful consistency, not to thick and not to thin.

Wow!.. I tried this the other day since butternut squash was on sale and it was great. Followed the recipe as is with the exception that I added a dash of Cayenne Pepper. BF loved it.. and he's pretty picky. "He said it's amazing but can we add meat?" So.. picked up another BN squash and this time fried up bacon with the butter first off.. reserved 1/4 of it for the end (added it after i blended everything so it's got some meat to show for it) w/a dash of cayenne pepper again.  Love this!

This is th most delicous back to basics soup out there.  Nothing but vegetables salt and pepper.  It does not need a thing!  Make it as directed.  I would say it makes more than 4 servings.  I did try it with crumbled bacon althoug it didn't need it.

LOVE THIS SOUP

I made this last night and roasted  (as suggested) the squash and white potato and a sweet potato.  I like the suggestion of roasting the squash, etc then adding to the veggies and broth.  I topped the soup with a little sour cream and may try with Parmesan tonight.  Great recipe that I'll make as long as the CSA gives me squash

Holy smokes!  This was so good.  I have never made butternut squash before so I'm glad that I found a great recipe like this one.  I did add garlic, curry and baked the squash first.  I added salt as needed.  The sour cream is definitely a neccesity.

This was a very easy and delicious soup.  I did read some of the reviews and took their advice and added some garlic and a dash of curry.  Also, I garnished with a spinach leaf and some sour cream.  All this made a good soup even better.

This recipe was VERY dissapointing! I am so glad, I only made 1/2 recipe. I followed the recipe exactly, except for using fresh butternut squash chopped at the store to save time. The picture, has such a pretty color! I was really looking forward to this. After simmering the vegetables and broth only 30 minutes, the broth looked lite brown. I found that odd. However, I let it cool down some and still ran it through the blender. After blending, it was an unappetizing brown orange color. The taste was oddly of bland burnt potatoes. I have no idea what I did wrong. I followed the temperatures and all my produce was very fresh. The color, taste, and texture was all way off. I really dislike wasting my food, money, and time.

This was very delicious! I didn't have any celery or carrots on hand, so I didn't add those, but it was still very delicious. When I blended it I added some milk. Sprinkled cheese and lemon pepper on top. The kids loved it.

Great and easy recipe. I added a big scoop of garlic and only used a bit of chicken bullion to keep the sodium down.

Easy recipe.Too bland so followed one review and added garlic,nutmeg and cinnamon with a dash of ground red pepper. Much better. I cook my butternut squash in slow cooker after halving and de-seeding. Then quickly scrape off shell but leaving some tender parts of the skin for increased nutrition. I use my Magic Bullet to properly puree skin and meat and all the cooked veggies with the chicken stock. I used coffee creamer as didnt have half and half. I also added a bit of brown sugar. I shared with family and got great reviews. I am keeping this recipe as a starter for my soup.

This was a great recipe!  I didn't do the celery - not a big fan. I added a few mushrooms and a crookneck instead. I didn't do chicken broth, I made vegetable stock and used that. Also, I roasted the butternut squash on 400 degrees for 45 minutes the day before, so it was already cooked, it cut down on the cooking time. I also used sweet potatoes instead of regular potato. I will keep this recipe for sure! I'll be making this and freezing it for winter!

A flavorful and rich soup. The squash was hard to prepare, maybe it wasn't ripe enough yet. I used chicken broth, which has the same effect as chicken stock. I blended it up in a blender until smooth. It was the perfect way to use butternut squash!

People complained about this recipe being bland and it isn't. However if you cook the squash in advance, it will not be infused with the flavors of the other vegetables and that will make a difference. Also celery is an important flavor so leaving it out is going to take something away. I doubled the celery which I chopped fine and doubled the carrots and butter. My chicken stock was homemade using a couple of sprigs of oregano, bay leaf and a sprig of rosemary. Made the soup just as suggested and pureed it in a food processor not a blender, making it a bit less smooth but still creamy.  It is amazingly good.

This is fantastic! My 4 year old ate it in record time! never seen her eat a meal so fast!! I used vegetable broth and a few shakes of nutmeg before blending. Our local store carries cut up butternut squash which cut down on prep time. I also boiled the veggies for 20 mins instead of simmering for 40 due to time constraints.

Used olive oil instead of butter.  Omitted the celery, carrots, and potato. Added white pepper and nutmeg.  Used an immersion blender.  Can't stop eating it! So delish!!  Will definitely make again.

This is a great tasting, healthy comfort food.  It has the mouth feel of a chowder with hardly any fat.  I used olive oil instead of butter, and instead of salt and pepper, I used white pepper and curry seasoning.  The broth offered plenty of salt.  I will definitely make this again.

I expected more from this recipe. I used a food processor and made everything as listed.. Once I tasted it, I added red pepper, cayenne, nutmeg, and sour cream but still feel like it's missing something.

Currently eating this soup and had to review because it's amazing (thank goodness I doubled it). I used a variety of additions listed in other reviews. Started by sauteing onion, garlic, and ginger in olive oil, then added the veggies and broth. Added a couple shakes of curry powder, nutmeg, cayenne pepper, and 4-5 cloves. Served with a large dollop of f.free sour cream. YUM- and healthiness is a bonus.

Great but you don't need celery, potatoes or carrot! I sub'd a couple of shallots for the onion, used Goya chicken bouillon to make the stock and added 2 Tbs nutmeg and cinnamon. It came out really awesome. It's a butternut squash soup. Why cut it with all the other veggies? Also, I found that 32 ozs of chicken stock is perfect for the consistency of the soup. You don't need to add any more. It will blend just fine.

Fantastically simple and delicious. Subbed carnival squash and added garlic, chard, cumin, and a little cayenne pepper. The chard gave it a green color that may be unappetizing for finicky eaters, but it tastes amazing. I will be making this frequently.

I only gave this recipe 4 stars because I did follow other reviewers advice and tweaked it a little.  The end result was a 5 star soup.  I roasted the squash for 45 min at 400 degrees first. I added some garlic, nutmeg and cinnamon and at the end, some 1% milk to the puree to make it a touch creamier.  The dollop of sour cream makes it perfect.  Thank you so much for a delicious recipe.

This is an excellent soup.  Because of food allergies in our home, I substituted olive oil for the butter, and used my own chx stock from the freezer.  The brown bits from suteeing the vegetables initially are crucial to the flavor, and it's AWESOME.  Tip: I read the comments before I made it, so I, too, roasted the squash first to make it easy to scoop out and add to the soup (cut lengthwise, roast at 400 for 40 mins face down in 1" of water, or leave it whole and poke holes on all sides and roast for an hour.  It's done when the skin is starting to brown and get puckered/bubbly).

We wanted to use up our butternut squash from costco and this recipe was a hit with my 3 and 5 year old.  Very simple and full of flavor.  We liked that it is a low fat option considering you could easily use heavy cream rather than the broth.  Delicious!

During the winter, I always make a big batch of soup on Sunday since it makes great lunches for work.  I have always wanted to try butternut squash soup and chose this recipe.  I LOVE IT!  What an awesome way to get your vegetables!  Definitely keeping this recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

This was delish!  I roasted the squash first, and didn't bother browning the veggies (just tossed everything in the chicken stock and let it simmer until all veggies were soft).  I added some garlic powder, cayenne pepper, and red pepper flakes for added spice.  I garnished with a dollap of sour cream.  Yum!

DELISH!  Rich and satisfying without the guilt!  I swapped out the regular potatoes for 1 sweet potato and added one apple and a dash of nutmeg...love!  

If you don't have an immersion blender...get one, they're great!

Overall, this recipe is delicious, especially if you love squash! I baked the squash in the oven at 375F for an hour as suggested by others, and it was so simple to just scoop it out while it was warm. I also added a little bit of curry powder and 1/2 cup of coconut milk. I agree with others who say the sour cream is a must-adds so much to the soup!

This is a great recipe.  The only change I made was to substitute olive oil for the butter.  I served it with a spoonful of sour cream which adds a little richness and balances the sweetness of the squash.  So easy, so healthy, and so wonderful!  Thank you!

This soup is very delicious and so easy to make.  I cut all veggies with mandolin slicer and was finished in about 5 minutes.  Put all the chicken stock in with veggies to simmer and added a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg and blended in a blender.  It smelled fantastic and we ate all of it.  Definitely make this one again.

Quite yummy and easy (I never cook). I left out the celery, threw in a couple extra carrots for sweetness, and used 3 leeks instead of onions. I also used less butter and a little more broth (which I added all at once). Salt, some cinnamon and a little Tabasco gave it a really nice flavor.

I just loved this receipe but I found it difficult to get the squash cooked evenly in the oven.  Made for a very messy peel and cube.

Nice starter recipe.  I roasted the squash, added extra carrots, and omitted the potatoes, onion, and celery.  Also, added fennel bulb and leeks (sauteed with carrots).  After all was pureed, I added a can of evaporated skim milk, minced garlic, and tsp red curry.  Absolutely delicious!

Loved this soup!! I used sweet potatoes instead of white b/c I love the flavor of sweet potatoes. I also added a clove of garlic in the beginning with the other veggies. At the very end, I added a little heavy cream.

I just made this soup and it's amazing! Of course, I changed it a bit like everyone else! :) It's a good starter soup to play with adding other flavors in with the squash. I didn't have potatoes on hand so I omitted those. I baked my squash first, and chopped the other veggies while it was baking. I also added 2 cloves of garlic, curry powder and nutmeg, from another reviewer's suggestion. After I blended with my new blending wand (which I love and find amazing!) I added one whole can of coconut milk, and some sea salt and red pepper flakes to finish. Awesome!

Very good soup and very popular in restaurants right now.  It costs very little to make.  In response to other reviews, I agree that the soup is probably better without adding potatoes, or sweet potatoes, or carrots.  As a matter of fact, it can just be made with squash and vegetable or chicken stock, though I think that onions add a pleasant pungent sweetness and celery a slightly herby taste.  The addition I recommend is a pear - which, of course adds some fruitiness.  Also, I wouldn
t mix in the sour cream because it deprives people of the opportunity to cut those calories.  And finally, you can use plain skim milk yoghurt (or any other kind you prefer) instead of sour cream.  Some might even prefer its lightness.

So delicious and easy!  The only changes I made were one russet potato and 1 sweet potato, only a half an onion and a bit of nutmeg.  Put the whole squash in the over for about 50 minutes while I made the rest of the soup, made it super easy to cut in half and the skin peeled right off.  Topped with plain greek yogurt, it was soooo good.

This is a great recipe. I followed another reviewer's suggestion and substituted one of the potatoes for a sweet potato. I also added a dried and crushed smoked chipotle pepper.

This was the best butternut squash soup I've ever made (truth be told I've only made it once before). I followed the recipe to a "T" with no adjustments and it was great, even the hubby approved! Definitely takes more than 15 mins. prep to cut the veggies, esp. the butternut squash, but not too long and it's worth it. The veggies and potatoes definitely add sustenance. Add some allspice or other seasonings if you want more flavor. Tastes like Fall - yum!

Hooray for a healthy butternut squash soup!  I haven't made this yet but I don't see a way to attach a personal note to the recipe, so I'm trying this.  Bake the whole squash beforehand at 400 for 1 hr, or cut lengthwise and nuke 12-15 minutes flesh-down in 1/2" water. Use 1 potato & 1 sweet potato. Don't blenderize it all. Play with meg, paprika, parsley, ginger, cinn, curry.  Serve w/ yogurt, nuts.

Delicious!  I added a few things to make it even better. 
Garlic, more carrots, all purpose seasoning, s & p, and a little half and half at the end.  Very good with some grated parm on the top, and some crusty bread.

I added 2 bay leaves and used two butternut squashes instead of adding potatoes.  Also added a splash of cinnamon and nutmeg.  It was delicious, hearty, and just the perfect Fall soup.  Put some great French bread and Sharp white cheddar and it was the perfect meal!!

I made it almost exactly as written and it was delicious. I garnished with a little sour cream. The only note I'd add is that it needs a lot of salt to bring out the flavor. I added a combo of sea salt, celery salt and seasoned salt.

While I didn't love it, it could be because I'm most critical of my own cooking. My food critic parents and boyfriend love it, and my mom shared it with a co-worker the next day at work who also enjoyed it.
Following some reviews, I omitted one potato in fear two potatoes would take away from the squash. I also used two stalks of celery and two carrots. Also, I used vegetable stock instead of chicken because I'm a vegetarian. My boyfriend added in brown sugar and cinnamon at the end and I think that's what really gave it it's kick.

This soup is so delicious! I'm a vegetarian, so I used vegetable stock it it is so yummy. Added about a 1/3 cup sour cream for that creamy texture! It is wonderful as is, but if you want a tad more punch I added 1/3 red pepper, 4 cloves garlic, and a little cilantro. This soup is a keeper. Couldn't stop "tasting" it, yum!

To make it awesome, I added lots of sage and a cup of milk at the end of cooking to even out the flavors.  The thing that really took it over the top for me was the addition of sweet turkey sausage- The sage really works well with the sweetness of the squash.

This is a great base recipe.  I changed the vegetable prep.  I roasted every including a clove of garlic.  I omitted the celery and used, as one person suggested, a sweet potato and a while potato.  At the very end, I put the soup back into a pan after the blender and chopped about four medium sized baby bella mushrooms to heat through with the soup.  The soup was great without them but I enjoyed it with the mushrooms, as well.  Thanks!

I made this last night, and it was the first time I have ever made butternut squash soup, and it was so easy! It turned out DELICIOUS. I only used one butternut squash, one potato, and half an onion. I baked the squash like people suggested. It turned out wonderfully. We had enough for two people and then some. It was also very filling.  I also added cumin, curry powder and a little sage.   I love this soup, and will definitely make it again! =)

Good cold-weather hearty, healthy soup. I added some cream cheese & white wine to smooth it out.

Fantastic! I doubled the recipe which made it a little difficult to brown the vegetables in a big pot. I think that the original recipe would have made more than 4 servings, more like 6-8.  This soup tastes like a cream based one, yet without the cream! It is so good and healthy as well. I put in a little less potato to cut down on the carbs and it still turned out fantastico!

Awesome base recipe.  This was an amazing soup I will definitely make again with the same variations.  2 stalks of celery not 1, I used a red onion, 2 carrots, 1 bigger sweet potato instead of the 2 potatoes.  I threw in a few shakes of cayenne, cinnamon, nutmeg, and of course some salt & pepper.  It just ended up amazing. Oh and 5min in the microwave for the squash makes it easier to cube up.

This recipe was a hit. I used it for a dinner at our church and it was a huge success. The ingredients blended well together. It was used for the opening course of the dinner and it was a beautiful start. Two people asked for the recipe and I will using for my Christmas or New Years dinner.

This worked out great! I think I may have used a larger squash then asked for but it just made it more squashie which we didn't mind! We also added some cayenne pepper, nutmeg, ginger and a dash of cinnamon as well! This truly brought out the excellent flavour of the squash! Beware, this makes A LOT of soup! I almost had to use my stock pot!

This was pretty easy to make and it turned out fairly good. I don't usually eat butternut squash so it was a little on the sweet side for me. I added homemade bacon bits on the top to make it a bit more savory and my husband said that made the dish.

Amazing!!!!  I'm lucky that my grocery store sells the butternut squash already peeled, seeded and cut up!  Makes this recipe so easy!  The one thing I do recommend is peeling the celery so you don't get any strings in the soup.

I'm a novice cook, but this recipe is super easy.  LOVE the soup, but I did make one little change that I think made a big difference!  Instead of butternut squash, I used Ambercup squash (very orange, looks a bit like a round pumpkin.)  It's sweet, adds a fun flavor, and solves the problem of the potatoes overpowering the squash.  Of course, you'll have to present it to your guests as an "Ambercup squash soup", but it's great fun, and was a big hit at my Thanksgiving meal (even more popular than the Turkey, which is saying something!)  Beautiful color, also.  I think I'll make it again tonight!

Following some of the other reviews, I baked the squash at 400 for about an hour.  Meanwhile I sauteed onions and minced garlic, then added the cut up carrot and 1 cut up sweet potato and added the chicken broth.  Once everything was fork tender I added a pinch of curry, a pinch of cinnamon, and a pinch of cayenne powder and pureed - SCRUMPTIOUS!  Definitely going to make again!!

This soup is excellent.  I had no celery so omitted that and added a little celery seed. I also added a little garlic powder. Other than that I stuck with the ingredient list, however, I did bake the squash in the oven for about an hour. This really is safer and easier than cutting it raw.

Absolutely delicious. After cutting the squash open and removing the seeds, I baked the it, cut side down, in the microwafe, covered and in about 1 inch of water.  I scraped the cooked squash out when it was cool.  So much easier than peeling and cubing raw squash.  I simmered the potatoes and carrots until tender and added them to the squash, onion and celery and used the hand held turbo blender for a smooth soup.  I added cumin, a little garlic powder, some ground cloves and ground ginger and chipotle pepper for a little bite.  Fabulous and so easy.

Very good recipe.... makes a thick and flavorful soup.  I have another squash soup recipe with curry seasoning and a recipe with squash, tomato, and black beans... so didn't really think I needed to try this one, but was glad I did!!  I added a little garlic, curry, and cayenne that others have suggesested and served with the dollop of sour cream and sprinkle of dry cilantro or basil for garnish.  Do not leave out the blender (or wand) step to insure that smooth consistency.

Absolutely amazing!  Perfect for the fall, and super easy.  Roasted what seemed like a huge squash in the oven on 400 for just over an hour as someone else recommended - don't forget that the squash has a lot of pulp/seeds, so there will be less meat than you expect.  I browned a medium onion and thinly sliced a medium sweet potato, added the squash and finally almost 32 oz of chicken stock - all in a dutch oven.  Didn't take long to cook.  Added cayenne pepper and paprika, and a little cinnamon at the end - it just seemed right.  Blended really well, and added just the rest of the 32 oz of stock to make it a little less thick.  I DID NOT like it with sour cream though, which is better - saves the calories :)  Fabulous.  May make this for Thanksgiving.

I make this same kind of soup, but instead of using celery I use leek, it gives a softer taste to the soup. I also put some seasoned (lime and strawberry) ground pepper and a little nutmeg in the soup to spice it up.

Needs quite a bit of spicing up, but does taste good in the end. My boyfriend didn't enjoy the completely smooth texture, so next time I would puree only half of it and possibly add some shredded chicken.

I followed Alane's suggestions: only squash with 1/2 cup sour cream added. By using light butter and light sour cream, I kept the fat amount basically the same and this made 5-6 servings for me. I also added a clove of garlic, cumin and cayenne pepper. Husband surprisingly enjoyed it as much as I did, probably because of the spices.

My 2yr old is extremely picky and wouldn't touch pumpkin, sweet dumpling or acorn squash. I was sure she'd turn this down, choking and gagging. She ate a whole bowl! Yippee! Definitely a repeater!

This soup was literally the best soup I have ever made from a recipe (with others' suggestions). I baked the squash as suggested by others. Once the soup was simmering, I added 4 pinches of curry powder and 2 of cayenne. I also pureed a dollop of sour cream into the soup. YUM! My husband, the meat lover, thought it was delicious and asked to have it again some time!

I've never made squash soup before and was pleasantly surprised at how wonderful this turned out.  I added some curry as well as nutmeg for a little flavor, but other than that I followed the recipe as it was written.  Making it again today to freeze!

This recipe was very good although I did make some changes.  I omitted the celery as per other reviews.  I did not add potatoes.  I diced, cooked and mashed the butternut squash ahead of time before adding to soup (I had mashed the butternut squash for another recipe so figured I'd use the same here since I had loads leftover).  I used vegetable stock to keep it vegetarian.  I added some curry powder and a clove of garlic.  At the end I added some cream cheese and finished off with a sprinkle of cumin powder before serving.

I didn't have the celery so used celery salt instead and added a zucchini that was handy.  I didn't have enough chicken stock so I used water.  Fresh ginger, ground cumin and allspice as well as some 2% milk and olive oil also gave the recipe a bit more zing.

For more texture I make a version I call "mashed soup". Instead of pureeing the entire recipe I mash it with a potato masher until I achieve a consistency I like. Kids love to perform this task. Sometimes I don't use the blender at all. It just seems heartier this way, with the bonus of less clean-up!

Fabulous with a few tweeks. I baked the squash beforehand. Then, I did as Molly said, minus the cream and it was fabulous. I also added a pinch of curry and cayenne to kick it up a little and honestly, this is the nicest soup I have ever made.

This recipe is as easy as they come and results in a perfectly delicious soup.  I never like butternut soups that are too sweet and and I find that this has one has a great balance of flavor.  I added garlic which  I think goes great with the squash and other ingredients.  I also added some cayenne for spice.  This is one of the recipes that you can tweak depending on what you have on hand and it will still turn out great every time.

Amazing flavour and hearty soup. I didn't need to make any adjustments.   I have made this now several times for family and friends and everytime I have been asked for the recipe. This is a personal favorite and will be in my recipe chest for many years to come. Enjoy!

This is so insanely good.  The only thing I changed was I added about 1T freshly minced sage and a few pinches of nutmeg.  WOW the best soup recipe Ive ever had.

veryy good! great thickness! - used veggie broth instead and added more spices to liven it up, also I let the veggies sit in the pot after simmering for a couple hours which may have helped the flavor - then reheated and blended....will definitely make again!

Delicious and nutritious! I did as others did and boiled the veggies directly in the stock leaving out the butter, which worked beautifully and we didn't miss the butter at all. I used only one potato. I didn't have a full 32 oz of stock so I filled in the rest with water, mulched directly in the pot with a stick blender, and added a little milk at the end for some creaminess. My girls, who abhore veggies, said, "Yum!" and dug in. It was even better the next day.

First of all, I cooked the squash first in the oven for 2 hours at 350*. I don't know why anyone would make the effort to peal and cut a raw butternut squash!    I used one onion, TWO stalks of celery (I did not have a problem with any stringiness), THREE carrots, and two YAMS.     I added salt, pepper, parsley, celery salt, sage, rosemary, and a pinch of nutmeg during the "browning" stage.    These veggies did not take 40 minutes to get soft when simmering in the stock.    Adding the already cooked butternut squash, I used my submersion hand blender to puree the soup right in the pot.     I used the reaming chicken stock, and would like to have added more. The soup is very thick, as others have commented, like baby food. I also added about 1/2 cup of milk. More salt to taste.    The soup was not bland to me. I think it tasted pretty good, but for me it's just one of those things that I could not eat a whole lot of. For that reason, I don't think I will be making it again. But it's still a good soup.

This is the tastiest soup!  I like to change things up a bit, so I decided to add cinnamon, brown sugar, and an apple, and substituted sweet potatoes for the regular white ones.  It gave the soup a warm sweetness that is oh so good!

You can save cooking time by slicing your vegetables very thinly -- it'll only take about 10 minutes this way, but cutting will take longer, your choice.  This was an OK base, I made the following changes: I used sweet potatoes instead of white  No celery halfway during the browning, I threw in a large tablespoon of garlic and a teaspoon of ginger  After blending, mix in a couple dashes of cinnamon and other herbs to taste. I found that if you don't mind a thick, baby food like consistency, you'll have tons of flavor without having to add cheese or sour cream. It's delicious and super healthy.

I can't believe people who said this was tasteless!  This was sooo easy and sooo delicious.  I did NOT roast the squash before hand like some suggested, I cubed and browned it like the recipe called for, it only took minutes.  I DID add celery seed instead of celery (didn't have any), a couple garlic cloves, and cinnamon.  I also like my soup on the sweet side but did not like previous suggestions of using brown sugar...so drew inspiration from another squash soup recipe on this site and added one cubed apple with the veggies and a couple ounces apple juice with the stock.  YUM YUM!  I can imagine it will be good with the dollop of sour cream, but it certainly doesn't need it.  I am glad to find a cream-free squash soup.  I might sprinkle some slivered almonds on top when I serve it for supper later (had a taste before hand!!)  Happy concocting!

This was so easy and low in fat.  My family & friends loved it.  I just added a little dash of Nutmeg and cayenne red pepper for a little kick. I also baked the Squash before since I was planning on making something else with the squash. I would totally recommend this recipe.

Tried this tonight and it was really good.  I did add 1/4 teas. curry powder as someone had suggested and I did bake the squash in a 350 oven for 50 or so minutes.  Other than that I followed the recipe and it was velvety smooth and delicious.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks, Kris.

Awesome, with changes suggested by previous reviewers: curry powder, sour cream (a must), something just a little bit spicy (I added white pepper).  I used an acorn squash b/c that's what I had.  I have been giving my winter squash from the CSA away to friends b/c I didn't think it could be good (other than for baby food), but this recipe made a believer out of me that winter squash makes an amazing soup!  I found a roasted winter squash seed (like roasted pumpkin seeds) recipe on this site and made those last night, too!

This recipe was great! One of the best soups Ive ever made :) I made the following changes: - bake an entire squash for one hour at 400 C - Add a large carton of stock to the pot and add 4 cloves of garlic, curry powder and cinnamon along with 3 carrots chopped and 2 potatoes cubed.  - Peel the squash once cooled, add to pot and mash. It turned out perfect without pureeing it.  - Have with a dollop of sourcream.  Amazing!

This is a great soup. It is an excellent choice for kids. My toddler loved it and couldn't stop eating it. Very healthy and yummy. For grown ups, this recipe can be seasoned to taste and the amount of ingredients can be slightly altered. I really liked this soup especially in fall season!

Tasty! I skipped browning the vegetables and added some spices based on other recipes here (garlic, ginger, curry, pepper). I love the combination of vegetables, and since my husband and I each had two servings, there is just a little bit left in the pot :)  I would double this recipe if I was cooking for company, and it tastes great with a dollop of sour cream!

This was a good recipe, although a bit bland.  I omited the celery because I don't like celery and didn't have any.  I added the spices from the Spiced butternut Squash Soup on this website and it really helped.  I didn't have cayenne pepper so I didn't add it.  Otherwise it's a good base recipe

So simple and delicious! Even my 5 year old and 11 year old sons loved it. I can see my husband actually asking me to make this again...and I will.

Warm and hardy! Great for the fall. I added 2 cloves of fresh garlic while it simmered. Then once it was blended I added 1/2 teaspoon of pumpkin spice, 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg and a dash of cinnamon. It was delicious! I think I will freeze half to have later. Will definitely make it again.

I give this 4 stars as is. I added minced garlic and it made a world of difference. For variation I may add curry or chile powder.

AMAZING!! I've made it twice already. The first time I made it exactly as written and it was really good. The second time I added 3 cloves of garlic, a dash of cinnamon, nutmeg, and red pepper flakes, and a dollop of cream cheese just as I was about to blend it. For those of you who don't want to add celery because it's stringy, just peel the outside off. That's the only stringy part celery. THIS IS A MUST TRY RECIPE!!!

This is a wonderful base recipe with lots of room for experimenting. I roasted the squash whole instead. Sounded too difficult to go at raw. The only noteworthy change I made was I added 3/4 cup natural yogurt during the blending stage. I use natural yogurt as a sour cream/mayonnaise substitute often. In this particular recipe I wouldn't call it "as good as" sour cream but it gave it a nice smooth bite.

This was outstanding!  I did make a few changes though.  I cut the squash up in quarters and baked it on a cookie sheet for about an hour (so it peeled very easily!  and cubed it up and tossed in the pan.  I omitted the celery all together because Im not overly fond of celery. And I threw in the entire box of chicken broth from the beginning.  I used a hand mixer as opposed to a blender as I didnt see the point of transferring the soup, and I used a dash of nutmeg.  So although i made some changes, I kept to the principle of the recipe and it was amazing!  gone in 20 minutes!  highly recommend!

This soup is AWESOME just as the recipe is. I did bake the squash but that was the only change I made. I have been looking for a butternut squash recipe that resembles "Gardenay" soups and this is it!

I liked it sweeter so next time might leave out the curry & add more sweetness. This is what I did:added about 3 gloves of garlic, 2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice, 2 tbsp splenda tsp of curry, dash of cinnamon & salt. Added touch of cream when blending. Topped it with ramano cheese and sour cream.

Yum! Perfect fall soup! It was very thick and very flavourful.  I read that since butternut squash has such thin skin it can be pureed into the soup with the rest of the squash for extra nutrients! I will try that next time, less work!
EDIT
I have since tried leaving the skin on, it is still good but kinda stringy, definitely better if you remove the skin!

My first time cooking and eating butternut squash.  This was fabulous.  I left out the celery because I didn't have any and my blender was broken so I tried mashing it with a potato masher...not exactly the same consistency but still incredibly good.

This is a great base recipe, however you really want to modify it, otherwise it a little bland. 1- Use sweet potatoes 2- Bake squash and potatoes for 1 hr at 400F, makes it easier to peel and cut. 3- Add 1/4 cup of spicy rum. 4- Spices (nutmeg, cumin, Cajun  chilly, some masala) 5- Serve with sour cream

Awesone recipe.  I made it with 1 butternut squash and 1 acorn squash.  I put in 1 sweet potato 6-7 baby carrots, 2 celery stalks and 1 onion.  I added a bit of nutmeg and a dash of cayenne pepper. It was the best squash soup I have ever eaten.  My 10 year old son could not get enough.  Everyone that tried it loved it and wants the recipe.

This is a fantastic winter soup - very hearty and creamy even without adding any additional cream, etc.  I did add a little bit of dried Rosemary to give it a little extra flavor, and I think (as another user suggested) a pinch of curry would bring out the flavor.  Great recipe!

I made this last night and it came out great! I did not add the potatoes, however. I used to work in a restaurant where we served this, and I could not remember the recipe, so this worked just fine, and tasted amazing. I hope my guests enjoy it! Thanks.

This was really good, which kind of shocked me because I usually only like butternut mashed with lots of butter and brown sugar!!!  I used left-over mashed potatoes and carrots from last night's potroast, so it took no time at all to throw together.  Now I'm going to bake a nice crusty loaf of bread to pair it with.  Yummy.

This is one of those recipes that can get people to eat something they normally would not care for. My hubby and my kids love this soup. Another nice thing about this recipe is you can vary the amounts of the vegetables or even eliminate some and the results are still delicious.

It is a wonderful soup. We make this every Thanksgiving. I add cayenne pepper for some kick. I also think it is better if it sits overnight before reheating and eating.

EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT!
It tastes just like the Campbell's Butternut soup.  We ate it all for dinner and wanted more.  I'd never peeled a butternut before but it was relatively easy with a potato peeler.  The only change I made was adding extra onion.  Next time I'll add more potato too but it's great just the way it is.

Excellent, my dinner guests ate every drop! I followed the recipe exactly expect left out the potatoes, added more butternut squash which I cooked in the oven first and doubled the celery (remove the strings on the celery prior to chopping).

After reading several of the reviews, I opted to leave out the potato & replace w/ cauliflower. I roasted the squash, carrots & cauliflower w/ just the slightest bit of olive oil, sea salt & pepper for 35 min. i threw that in chicken stock w/ onion & celery & used the chop setting on my blender to leave some chunks of veggies - a dash of nutmeg & it was outstanding!!

its not always easy finding healthy food my husband will be but he really liked this! its a great base recipe. i added about 2 tsp of minced garlic, 1 1/2 tsp curry powder, and 2 tsp salt. the end result was great. it would probably be really good with some cilantro too.

What a wonderful savory fall soup!  I put in a little ginger just to jazz it up a bit more.

This soup was amazing.  I'm on a very limited diet and to have something so flavorful was delightful.  I used the recipe for Basic Vegetable Stock instead of the chicken stock.  I tried the suggested sweet potato instead of a white potato.  This soup will definitely find its way into my regular recipes.

Simple recipe to highlight the butternut squash.  I also added a pinch of curry and used just one potato.  I also boiled the potato and carrot in water and sauteed the celery prior to making the soup to soften them up.

Absolutely wonderful!!!!  I added a diced smoked ham (12oz) and 8oz of cream cheese for protein as a main dish--we are all bloated, including the 2 year old.  Excellent flavor, smooth, filling and just wonderful!

With the suggestions (1 less potato, 1/2 cup half and half, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, dash nutmeg), this soup knocked my socks off.

Excellent!  I cut and remove the seeds from the squash and oil a pan and roast it until soft(great roasted flavor!).  For a special treat, I added a couple of tablespoons of organic heavy cream! Delicious!!

This soup is great and healthy; even the kids ate it up and wanted seconds.  As per some other reviews I added a little garlic, curry powder and brown sugar.   Also, I roasted the squash first and just scooped it out of the skin.  Peeling and dicing the squash seemed like too much work.

Excellent soup exactly as it is.  Rather than omitting or cutting back on the potatoes as some suggested, maybe just use a bigger squash instead. Everyone is right about the sour cream and the second time I made it I spiced it up by adding 1/4 lb of mild italian sausage, browned with the veggies and pureed along with everything else. Served in a bread bowl it is a very satisfying cold weather meal.

This is a pretty easy recipe and tastes great!  What I did to speed up the process was to cut the squash into half, then into 1/4 slices and stuck it in the microwave for 4-5 minutes until soft then took the skin right off!  I have also replaces the butternut squash with acorn squash and it was delicious!  It could also be cut up and softened in the microwave.

I have never cooked with butternut squash before I tried this recipe.  It was fanntastic.  I did add 2 cloves  of garlic and curry powder.  Crumbled bacon and sour cream on the side.  My 19 month old loved it!  My husband and I added a garlic/chili sauce to our bowls! Wonderful!!

This was a great recipe as is, but I made a few additions that made it spectacular!  I roasted the squash at 350 for 1 hour before starting the soup and it made prep MUCH easier!  I also added some nutmeg to taste in the last 20 minutes or so of simmering.  When serving I garnished with a dollup of sour cream and topped with French's French Fried Onions and served it with garlic toast on the side for dipping.  Everyone licked their bowls clean!!

I added some garlic powder to these as some other reviews suggested and the soup was very bitter and had a bad taste to it. I think even without the garlic it would have been kind of bad. I recommend following the recipe exactly and seeing how it goes.

Very good.  I roasted the squash before adding to the soup.  I also added fresh ginger.  I thought the soup was a little thick, so the next time I make it I will add more broth.

This is an awesome soup. I baked the squash at 375 for an hour as another reviewer had suggested, and other than using baby red potatoes (skin on) I followed the recipe exactly.
I found this soup quite tasty, and felt no need to add any other spices as others have indicated.
I served it with a simple salad, and 'Easy Baking soda biscuits' (from this site).

Surprisingly Tasty! After looking at the basic ingredients, I thought the soup would be bland since there are no seasonings besides salt and pepper, but it actually had a great flavor. I did microwave the squash slightly to make peeling it easier, but I cooked it in the soup. The potatoes are a must; their starch gives the soup a creamy thickness. I had no problems with the celery -- after processing in the food processor there was no evidence of it. I did add garlic and substituted olive oil for the butter. It was great served with a dollop of plain yogurt. Highly recommended!

I took the advice of other raters and baked the squash for 1 hr @ 400 first.  Then I left the celery in larger pieces and removed it before blending.  I also added a little cumin.  I added a little warm milk to each bowl.  It was delicious!

This recipe was sooo good!  My 11 month-old gobbled it up!!  I put in a little sour cream at the end like some suggested. I also didn't have any chicken stock on hand, so I put in 4 cups of water with 4 bouillon cubes and added another potato.  I cooked it all to pieces and blended it in the blender. I also forgot to add the salt and pepper, but I didn't even notice.

Great recipe!  I never stick with an exact recipe...so, since I had mashed potatoes on hand I used those for the potatoes.  The squash was left over, not peeled, and with all the other ingredients it was delicious.  I blended it all with the peels-squash and peels in mashed potatoes-and it worked great!  Did add an extra one cup of liquid as it seemed quite thick.  This recipe worked well with leftovers and a bit of creativity!

Very tastey and filling. I added a sweet potato. I did cook the squash & potato in the oven for an hour as suggested. I used 4 tsps of chicken bouillon granules to 4 cups of water in place of chicken stock. Added sour cream to the finished product. Will make this again.

OMG!!! This is the best! I have never made anything wtih butternut before and this seemed easy and it was. Very simple. I love the flavor and the texture after the blender mix. Note - let the soup cool a tad before blending it, or have a really tight top cuz' that is hot! The Butternut squash was more difficult to peel with a peeler and I had to use a sharpe paring knife to slice down but other then that, the outcome was fabulous! It made a good amount and I have plenty to freeze. I hope it thaws well. I want to say Thank you for this recipe, it is a great one! :-)

Delicious and so easy to make.  I used a little bit of olive oil instead of butter and an all natural soup mix powder.  I was surprised to see how much my husband loved the soup so I guess it will be our new family favorite.

Very savory; did add a dollup of sour cream, but it didn't seem to add much. The soup is very good and creamy...I keep thinking it could use something else, but not sure what?

Not so good...It was better chunky before being pureed, but overall...not so good.

Yummy!
 I used olive oil and half the butter to save on fat and used vegetable broth instead of chicken and it was still great. 
My husband likes it chunky so I don't puree his bowl, he thinks it's great and he's a major carnivor!

This is good soup.  I made a few changes, because I used to work at a restaurant that served soup like this and wanted it to taste like that.  I added about 1 1/2 Tablespoons of sugar, some garlic powder (maybe 1/4 t?), and about a Tablespoon of Tarragon (that's a spice).  That made it!  Also, I think I will add less broth next time (I didn't have chicken stock so I used broth instead, and would have liked it to be a little thicker.)  Finally, I used an acorn squash--oops--but it still tasted great!  Makes a lot of soup--can't wait to eat the leftovers!

I made this w/o potatoes (b/c I didn't have any), and I found the end product to have a great texture, but I also found it bland.  I added sour cream as others had suggested, as well as red pepper flakes, curry powder, and cinnamon, and it ended up pretty good.

Delicious!  My husband and toddler both loved it.  I agree that the sour cream is a MUST!  I left out the celery and, in addition to salt and pepper, added just a little ginger, cinnamon and brown sugar.  Makes a large batch - I'll be freezing half of it for another meal.

This was awesome! Butternut is a bit hard to peel and cut and I found that I only had to boil for a short time and simmer for maybe 10 minutes... then I put in the blender.  Our family loved this!

This soup tastes great and is very healthy. To speed up the process I ran everything through the food processor first. Then I sauteed it all. I also added 1/2 medium piece of fresh ginger. For the stock I used water and a vegetable liquid bouillon called Organic Better Than Bouillon Vegetable Base. This stuff also comes in beef and chicken too. I doubled the recipe and froze the rest. Thanks to the original contributor!

I followed the recipe, but I added maple syrup and brown sugar. My three year old ate three bowls. I will try sweet potato instead of white potato next time.  It was a bit on the bland side for a five star rating.  Would add nutmeg.  Loved the texture.  Good recipe....it's a keeper!

This soup is delicious!!! I used 3/4 potatos and 1/4 sweet potatos. It is very thick and hearty and I made a big batch with fresh butternut from my garden. I froze a 12 portion bag for Thanksgiving, yum!!

My husband and I loved this soup.  We did make one small change.  We used two small sweet potatoes instead of white potatoes.  Very good flavor and very healthful soup.  Many Thanks for submitting it.

What a great blend of flavors!
I just put all the raw veggies in a food processor (a few kinds at a time so there was room) first.  Then I blended the soup in the end.  We dipped bread in it!  Tasty!

i made this recipe exactly as stated and it was good, not great.  i then added a touch of nutmeg and it was much better.  i would however, next time, use the sweet potato/potato combo that most people recommended.  that might liven this up a bit.  you can also add a touch of fat free half/half to make it creamier, leaving it still fat free.

I love this soup!  I went back and read everyones reviews and used a little bit of everyones suggestions to revise it.  I used more sweet potatoe and one small potatoe, I added half a red pepper and added more chicken stock.  When it was done I used a mixer instead so I could leave it with some vegetables in it, added 1 cup of 1% milk, and added, a little Thyme, curry, red pepper, black pepper, paprika, and nutmeg to taste.  I also didn't cook the vegetables in butter first, I just boiled them to get rid of the fat in the recipe.  It turned out great!  Oh and I also added some lentils to make it a little bit more filling for a full meal with some bisquits.  Thanks!

I loved this soup!! Even my picky 4 year old and my 11 month old couldn't eat it fast enough!  The only thing I did differently is that I added a clove of garlic to the pot while it was simmering.  I was generous with the chicken broth, the veggies were well covered and I didn't add any extra broth after putting it in the food processor, to keep it a little thicker.  It turned out beautifully.  I was tempted to add some herbs to it, but stopped myself and I'm glad I did, the flavour was wonderful.  There was only one complaint...this recipe does not make enough!!! I will double or triple the recipe next time.

This was very good.  I didn't really expect to like it!  After reading all the great reviews it received  - I thought I would give it a try and I'm glad I did.  Served with fresh buns and a spoonful of sourcream!  YUM!  Very filling! Leftover servings frozen for lunches.  Will make again!

This was just okay, I didn't have carrots and used acorn squash instead.  Probably wouldn't make again.

The soup had a nice smell and color to it. Maybe i added too many of the other things, and not enough of butternut squash. I couldnt taste the butternnut at all. It was kind of disappointing, because i love butternut squash. Will keep on searching

I love this soup!  I also omitted the butter to save on fat and calories and it is still a perfect lunch that keeps me feeling satisfied most of the day.  Great for my diet!

Just made this on a chilly winter day and it was delicious.  I left out the potato since I didn't have any in the house but I added an acorn squash instead.  Also spiced things up with about 1 tblsp each of madras curry powder, garam masala and some curry paste.  Just mashed this with the potato masher and thickened with a little wondra flour--richly yummy without all that fat.

I loved it!  I think I would probably have added a little bit more sqaush and less potatoes, BUT it was still a perfect touch to our Thanksgiving dinner.  Thanks so much!!!

I'm not a big expert on squash recipes, but i found this one delicious! Lot's of vegetables to balance a little the sweetnes of the squash and to make it thiker, no dairies (less fat) and easy to make (it does take a lil to peel the squash tho!).
I only added a tbsp of yogurt as suggested in other review and a lil nutmeg. Great!

Delicious! I was pleased to find a squash soup recipe that could easily be made dairy free. (I used Earth Balance margarine in place of the butter.) Definitely worth the effort of peeling the squash!

I followed the recipe exactly except for adding a dash of ginger and of mace. It was excellent garnished with a glop of yoghurt and the last sprigs of parsley from the garden. I love this time of year when we can enjoy fall soups.

Very good, has replaced my usual butternut squash reciped where I fuss around with apple juice and pears.
Much more simple and just as tasty or more.  Did use chicken broth rather than chicken stock.

i Love this recipe. it took a bit longer than expected to cube that whole squash and all the veggies and potatos. i also added 1 sweet potato (or yam), xtra carrot and used 3-4 tbs butter.  it turned out hearty, thick and tasty. it was all gone in 1 day, friends and family loved it even my 18 month old daughter! thank you!

Pretty good, though I substituted several small potatoes for 2 medium. The skins provided a nice texture to the smooth soup.

This is amazing!  I made a few changes because I didn't have potatoes on hand.  I substituted sweet potatoes then added 6 oz cream cheese at the end. I did not add any additional broth after the initial amount. Such a warm creamy soup on a cold winter day!

It was excellent. Easy to make. Used prepackaged, cut squash. Potatoes were leftover, roasted and seasoned because that’s what I had in the house. 2 stalks of celery because I needed to use it up, instead of the one stalk. I let the vegetables cook and brown a bit longer than 5 minutes. Probably about 15 minutes. Deglazed the pot with the broth. And simmered for the 40 minutes.

A boilerplate recipe that really shines with some added spices. I followed all of the suggestions in the Momily review. I did not have celery, so I used a small leek. Several reviews suggest adding sour cream while eating, but since my wife is lactose intolerant, I added coconut milk once done with simmering. A creamy element nicely complements the cinnamon and nutmeg. Overall, I really enjoyed the final result, even if some liberal massaging of the recipe was needed. Will be making again.

I liked the soup, but I added a bit of garlic, apples, and bay leaf. I served it with bacon bits, sour cream, and green onions. It was a big hit with our seniors group. It was quite thick so added a bit of extra broth. They really loved it!! I would definitely make this again.

I made this and used a whole yam instead of potatoes, plus a whole butternut squash. While it was simmering I added a bay leaf, 2 cinnamon sticks, and 6 coriander seeds, which I took out before blending it into a purée. It turned out very aromatic and delicious, I can’t stop eating it. Very healthy and filling

I made the soup and both my husband and I enjoyed it. My daughter (from afar) complimented the lovely appearance of the soup in the photo I sent her. I found it a bit bland, and as she suggested, if I make it again I will add adobo peppers or something of that sort.

**Vegan modifications**. This was ABSOLUTELY delicious ! I did, however, add in some extra seasoning (cinnamon and nutmeg) , used VEGETABLE broth instead of chicken, and used VEGETABLE based butter, as I follow a vegan diet . SO good !! Huge hit at home with all my picky eaters.  Will definitely make again !  Thank you !!

Easy enough to make although I agree with other commenters. Roasting before sautéing with other veggies makes sense. Otherwise you’ll get a very earthy taste. The roasting will bring out the sweetness of the squash.  I ended up adding brown sugar to remove the earthy taste. Season well. I added nutmeg, cinnamon and some chili powder.

LOVE it! I'm making it for the third time in a month! 

Pro tip: only fill the blender 1/3 full or it will go everywhere and burn you. Source: my sweet husband who blended this for me and burned his hands.

I add half a can of Coconut Cream and it's amazing! I would probably do Heavy Whipping Cream, if I weren't allergic to dairy.

I previously roasted butternut squash. I followed this recipe for qty's, I added a clove of garlic and cooked it right up. I added my roasted butternut squash the mix of vegetables and then added the chicken stock to cover. Added salt and pepper. As the vegetables were becoming soft enough to put int the blender I added curry powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves to taste. Turned out delicious. I didn't cook it any longer as it was perfectly thick.

I made this exactly as stated.  I wanted to like it because it is an easy fast, simple recipe.  But it tasted way too much like cream cheese. Butternut squash doesn't have a lot of flavor and takes on the flavor of the strongest ingredient in this case the cream cheese.  I will try another.

This is a good recipe.  I tweaked it a little to use what I had on hand as most cooks probably do. I won't hesitate  as long the next time I want some butternut squash soup.  Will definitely use this recipe as reference.  I don't really care for the sweet, nutmeg, cinnamon version generally served in restaurants. ( I used a potato masher rather than puree the veggies - for those of you that dislike clean up as much as I do.)

This has become a family favourite, which I love because it’s so easy to prepare. I have made some changes after reading other reviews to make it even tastier. We have a severe milk allergy in our house, so I use a bit of olive oil to sauté the onions and celery rather than the butter. I add 1 sweet potato rather than two white potatoes, and 2 carrots and 1 large butternut squash. I add all those in chunks to the onions and celery and then use 3 vegetable bouillon cubes and 6 cups of water, along with 1/2 teaspoon of curry powder (you don’t taste the curry powder at all but it adds a great umami flavour to the soup!). I let it simmer for 45 minutes, and then blend until smooth with an immersion hand blender. Once it’s smooth I add a pinch of freshly grated nutmeg and a bit of salt and pepper to taste. If I find the soup too thick, I just thin it out with a bit of boiling water. It’s an awesome soup!

Very good - added some twists as follows:
No celery or potatoes
Didn't peel squash but washed and removed scubs 
Used 1/2 a giant sweet potato prepared same way
2 cloves garlic
Vegetable instead of chicken broth
Olive oil instead of butter
Add 1/8 tsp each of cayenne and coriander
Add 1/4 tsp yellow curry
Add 1 tsp ground mustard
Add 1 or 2 or to taste smoked paprika (adds nice color)
2 Roma tomatoes chunked
Did not blend - left in chunks - more of a stew
When all done minced a Honeycrisp apple and added to hot soup and let "wilt" (Added great.flavor and a little crunch to texture

This is hands down one of my favourite soups to make! Easy and delicious. Another review recommended to add some garlic (I typically use about 3 cloves) and curry powder (adding small dashes at a time until it gets to the desired taste I want) - HIGHLY RECOMMEND adding those ingredients. It really brings out tons of flavour in this soup. I also add a small dash or 2 of cayenne pepper for a little added spice. 

This is a staple at our house and everyone who has tried it loves it!

If I could only take one recipe with me, it would be this one.  I make this once a week during the winter.   I do make a few adjustments to the recipe that I discovered by reading the reviews.  I add 1 Tbsp of curry, a pinch of nutmeg, garlic and 1 tsp of cayenne pepper.  I serve with some croutons.

Perfect combination of flavors, I love this recipe. I also add a pinch of nutmeg and 1 cup of heavy cream to get to my favorite taste of the season.

Excellent, added some nutmeg and cinnamon. Also roasted the potato and squash and added to the fluid on the stove.

I followed this recipe and then added the spices the other comments said to add (cinnamon, nutmeg and garlic) I also whipped up some cashew milk which added a creamy texture, this was a delicious soup after adding the spices! I also only did 1 potatoe and it seemed to keep the ingredients fairly even throughout.

This is a good base, but needs tweaking for flavour. I added roasted elephant garlic, a little curry paste, pepper, cauliflower, and tofu for protein. I drizzled a little white truffle oil on top.

I did not add the butter and all ingredients were slow-cooked in a crockpot.  purried the chopped veg and stirred it back into the liquid,  I think this may be one of my new favorites, I loved the flavor & simplicity!

i think this is really good and i'm happy i found this recipe! i pretty much made it exactly as described, but omitted the carrot and celery.  i roasted my squash in the oven beforehand and used my hand emulsifier instead of a blender.  also added some cayenne pepper for a little kick.  love that this soup is so nice and thick!  will def make this again...so easy!

I also veered off the road a little bit with my version. I added whatever I found in the fridge and pantry;
*All organic ingredients, except the ravioli* (Yes, it affects the flavor as well as your bod)

1Purple carrot
1 Orange carrot
1/4 white onion
1 Avocado
2 Fresh garlic cloves, minced
Approximately 8 mixed variety mini potatoes, cubed
2 celery stalks
32 ounces chicken broth
About 3/4 cup unsweetened plain yogurt 
About a 1 cup of unsweetened vanilla almond milk 
3 tablespoons butter
Rana Butternut Squash Ravioli 
Oh yeah, and a butternut squash.

To taste;
Ras El Hanout (made the soup!)
Ginger
Honey
Vanilla
Cinnamon 
Salt
Pepper
Parsley
Paprika

I just peeled the Squash and diced everything else up (after peeling) and threw it all in a big pot. After the vegetables were tender I transferred what I could into the blender, then the rest into another bowl. I poured the blended soup back into the pot and finished blending the rest. I let this simmer while I prepared the curve ball (which consisted of getting the kitchen scissors), Rana Butternut squash ravioli. It was not too much squash if your thinking it. Bringing this to the restaurant I work at, we’ll see what the critics think. 

I. Ate. So. Much. I loved it, nice flavor profile, not too sweet, nothing was overpowering. Definitely making again.

I made some adjustments and it turned out great. I roasted the squash and added it half way through the cooking time. I didn’t include the potatoes. I also added some cinnamon and agave to make it a little sweeter.

Simple, delicious - more like a bisque than a soup. I found the recipe 2 weeks ago and have already made it twice. Comfort food. Followed it exactly and used one carton of College Inn chicken broth. It’s a keeper

Never disappoints!  My local grocery store has cleaned, peeled and cubed squash for a mere $5 in a container, so it makes this soup even easier!  Immersion blender is a must!! (Only about $25-30 on amazon!)

I cut up the squash raw and sauteed it with onions, apples and lots of garlic, lots of grated ginger, salt, pepper, chili powder, onion powder, garlic powder. Then I added chicken stock, apple juice, pinch of cumin and 1%  milk. I used the immersion blender. Then I remembered I had left over mashed potatoes so I put about 1/4 cup in and let it simmer to heat through.

Yum! Used two packages of prepared butternut squash ‘noodles’ so the squash cooked quickly, added some garlic powder, red chili flakes and pepper. Super easy and delicious! Used 4 cups of water.

I made a double batch and I baked the butternut squash whole for 1 hour at 400C. Once the squash was cooked, I cut it in half, scooped out the seeds and the peel came off easily. Everything in the pot, cooked as directed....so easy, so delicious, freezes well.

Great base! I made a few changes that definitely helped this recipe.

- I roasted the butternut squash for about a half hour, brushed w olive oil and S&P. 
- Only used one potato.
- 1 tbsp red curry.
- 2 tbsps of gochujang (we like heat)
- tsp of curry powder and tsp of cumin

I roasted the squash seeds w olive oil, salt, and paprika for 15 minutes and sprinkled them on top.

Came out excellent! I plan on serving leftovers over quinoa.

Really loved this great fall soup!  Added 2 teaspoon salt; 2 teaspoon of pepper; 1/8-1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper; pinch of cinnamon and pinch of nutmeg.  We topped with splash of cream, crumbled bacon, and diced chives.  Homemade bread to dip...Amazing!!

Delicious.  First time I made anything with a butternut squash and I am glad I made this soup.  My end result was a bit thicker than a soup.  It was similar to the consistency of cream of wheat.  I liked it that way. I probably added more potato than necessary, but it worked.  I will make again.

Followed the ingredients (used 1 small potato) but added some nutmeg, 1 small garlic clove, onion powder, syrup and honey for more flavor. Garnished with Old Bay and it was AMAZING! Recipe was bland without the extras I added.

I have made this several times and I love it as it is. I’m not one to make a sweeter soup so I enjoy that it doesn’t have the apple or the cinnamon or nutmeg. I do think that the stock you use is key and I always find my soups benefit from using Knorr Vegetable Bullion.

I enjoyed this soup.  I love butternut squash though.  I did make a couple of changes.  I used all sweet potatoes (love these too) instead of white potatoes.  I added minced garlic and curry powder like other reviewers.  I may try adding maple syrup next time.  There will be a next time.

It was great! My family normally hates butternut squash but this recipe has got them hooked. 
I was trying to use the things I had in the house so I didn’t put potatoes, celery, or chicken broth from a box. I had a jar of condensed chicken broth and just estimated.
Another thing I did different was the amount. I had to quadruple it to feed everyone but there wasn’t  a lot of leftovers!

The soup came out just perfect. The only change i made was using chicken bouillon with water instead of stock. I wouldn't change anything about it.

I've made this so many times ; this recipe is definitely  a family favorite!  I don't change anything (might add a little cayenne for a kick).  However, for the reviews that say this lacks flavor I have to disagree!  Make sure that you add sufficient salt and pepper to taste,  that may be what is missing.

Recipe was bland.  I made this again and roasted the squash in a 425 degree oven for 20 min.  Gave the soup a much deeper flavor.  I also added some ginger, just our family preference, and it was great.  Good basic recipe, just needs some added flavor.

Super easy if you have a blender stick. Wholesome filling dish that doesn't depend on meat. I garnished with thin slices of smoked sausage that I browned in a skillet and plopped a dollop of sour cream on top, otherwise pretty much stuck to the recipe. We enjoyed it.

This soup has lots of possibilities for modification or addition. Still, I recommend trying it close to by-the-book the first time. Butternut squash is subtle and it would be easy to overwhelm the natural flavor with spices or bold ingredients. It really doesn't need anything but a garnish.

I have made this several times~ I eliminate the potatoes as they don’t add anything in my opinion and I usually don’t have them around (I’ve added cauliflower a few times)   & usually double or triple it. 
It is on the MILD  side, so I’ve experimented with adding yellow curry paste or cayenne pepper to give it more heat. We have also added cilantro on top in addition to the roasted seeds scooped out from the squash . 
It is so rich & delicious! If I ever add too much heat, adding heavy cream is a good fix

This is an easy recipe to make and tastes wonderful!  The only thing I changed is I roasted in the oven the squash instead of pealing.  Much easier to scrape out cooked squash and I think it gives a better flavor.

I used EVOO rather than the butter and left out the potatoes. 
Added a can of white pinto beans.
Very tasty soup.
Next time I'll try some sage, thyme, or other wintery seasoning.

Very delicious, but definitely tastes like extra yummy mashed potatoes.  I baked the butternut squash for 45 minutes, then peeled and added to cooked remaining ingredients. Sour cream garnish!

I agree it was kinda bland. I cut the squash in halves and baked for an hour at 375 to get it soft for easier blending. In the mean time I used no sodium chicken broth, 4 celery stalks. 4 carrots, and 4 small potatoes, no butter. I used onion powder instead of regular onions.  Flavor I added thyme and 2 bay leaves.

This was super easy to make and very tasty with a great consistency. I didn't have any celery but that didn't seem to affect the flavor. I used about two-thirds of the 32-oz carton of chicken broth. I would definitely make it again!

Easy and so so yummy I added some Thyme to make it taste even better.. I also used some coconut oil with the butter. this is such a comfort food that can be frozen for other meals in the week. Once blended with an Immersion Wand it makes it smooth and so yummy.

I  enjoyed this soup. I didn't have  potatoes and I used chicken broth instead of stock.  I roasted the butternut squash as other reviewers suggested. It was very flavorful and had a nice color and texture.

First off, this is my 1st time using butternut squash not in baked form. That being said, Hubby prefers chunky soup, so I did not puree it. And, there was so much juice leftover after cooking up the chicken breasts with the veggies that I simply shredded the chicken into the veg mix (cooked stove-top medium low for 35 minutes after initial 10 minutes on medium high as I chopped the vegs adding to the skillet--squash 1st). Then served it (no broth added). Hubby and I loved it! Thank you for the recipe base idea. It was wonderful, and will definitely make it again.

Followed suggestions and omitted celery, carrots, and potatoes. Cooked squash at 375 for an hour before adding to the recipe. Tastes fantastic. Also tastes great with sour cream.

This is easy to change to your preferences. I don't put celery in, I add a glove of garlic, a bit of green tabasco, cumin and cilantro can give some nice flavour boosts also. I now cook it in my Instant Pot, turns out fantastic.

My family loves this soup!  I followed the recipe, and added a few spices. I added 2 fresh cloves of minced garlic and (didn’t measure) a few shakes of cumin, cinnamon, garlic powder and about 1 tsp  of brown sugar. This gave it nice added flavor.  This is a keeper. Great for those central New York winter months!

Delicious and easy. I enhanced spicing per other reviewer’s comments: 1/2 tsp curry, 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 1/4 tsp cinnamon,  1 tsp salt, served with sour cream.

Just used squash, butter, chicken bullion, salt, and pepper and it was great. Skip the blender and just use a masher after softened in the fry pan, then add bullion and seasoning and comes out slightly "chunky style" with some light texture but I like it that way.  Definitely a keeper of a recipe.  Simple, quick easy and so far my favorite way to prepare butternut.

I baked the squash separately but I’m not sure I needed to. It added another step. This was very easy to throw together with very nice flavour. Be sure and read the instructions as you may not need the whole carton of chicken broth.

Easy enough recipe. But not enough flavor personally, i added a bit of curry, and more salt, a bit a sherry also helped and a dash of cayenne pepper, still feel like it was missing something though.

This has now replaced my other recipe that I used for years.  The only adjustment I used to this was I used vegetarian stock, added 2 coursely chopped celery stalks, 1 carrot and 1/4 fennel bulb.  I cooked it in the crock pot, then used my Vitamin to blend it nicely into a soup consistency.

Very nice! Will definitely make again. I roasted the squash beforehand like others suggested (375F for 45 mins on a sheet pan, halved and seeds removed with flesh facing down, cup of water, covered with foil). I added minced garlic to the butter and also added 2 tbsp of olive oil. Kept all veggies as recipe lists. I changed the order of adding things a little: cooked onion, celery, and carrots down first, then added potatoes and poured in stock, then added in roasted squash I scooped out. Added tsp of curry powder and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg. I used Better than Boullion (chicken) for the stock and followed their directions on the jar plus also added about an extra tablespoon of the boullion (I think it helped give it a nice rounded flavor). Then once cooked, I pureed with a hand blender. Added about 3/4c half and half (didn't necessarily need it but my brain was freaking out that the soup was so creamy and lovely without having any cream....so I added some bc that's completely reasonable and well-adjusted, right?).

I made this for the first time today.  I didn’t add celery or potatoes but did add cayenne and nutmeg.  The soup is amazing. I tried it with sour cream too, but it doesn’t need it. I prefer it without sour cream. Will make this again!

I baked the Butternut Squash first with olive oil salt and pepper, that made it soft then did the rest of the recipe and added Cayenne pepper to it.  We all loved it!

This soup was so good! After seeing the other reviews I made some changes with the seasoning and also decided to add a whole acorn squash for the heck of it.  The end result was fabulous. This soup was filling, very flavorful, and I'll definitely be making it again. 

As per advice from other reviews, I omitted the two potatoes for one large sweet potato, added 1/2 tsp curry powder, 2 cloves minced garlic, 1/4 tsp cinnamon, and a few dashes of cayenne pepper. I decided to add a whole acorn squash as well and sub the chicken broth for veggie broth. The addition of the extra squash and steam evaporation made the soup pretty thick so I ended up adding an extra cup of broth, which still left the soup hearty and thick. OTHER ADVICE: if you have a strong blender, the celery strings aren't an issue, especially if you cut the pieces small before cooking. I also used my Instant Pot to cook the cubed squash which was perfectly tender after 5 minutes on Low Pressure (instant release). The peeling and dicing was a little time consuming so I'll probably try the oven method next time, cooking the unpeeled halves instead of dicing. *side note* I tried this with some steamed kale mixed in to contrast the baby food consistency and it was really good!

This turned out pretty well. I used one potato as one review suggested as well
as  a pinch of cinnamon, ginger and nutmeg. I also added a splash
of butternut squash seed oil in each bowl when served which gives it a rich taste. I think a swirl of light cream would work as well.

I've made this often. Can be "flexible" with ingredients and proportions. I microwave the squash to make it easier to peel.

love the recipe! so simple and very easy to follow.

i don't have chicken broth but 1 chicken cube worked just fine.

altered this recipe a bit:
- added milk for creaminess
- seasoned with cumin
- i was quite generous with the black pepper

Great soup! Did make some adjustments like roasting the squash is a must. Also instead of using a potato, I used another butternut squash. Added a dash of cinnamon, nutmeg, and garlic powder. This is my go-to butternut squash soup :)

My MIL is vegan so I changed the butter to olive oil and chicken stock to vegetable stock.  I used 1 small sweet potato, a pinch of curry, some cinnamon and cracked black pepper and salt.  She really enjoyed it.  This soup is on the bland side, but you can easily adjust the seasonings to your liking.

Everyone loved it. I made it vegan and substituted the butter with earth dense and the chicken broth with veggie broth and added som veg bouillon. Very tasty.

Delicious soup! Perfect for the cold weather. Like others I did alter the recipe, by omitting the celery (my family just doesn’t like it) and we added a bit of thyme and cayenne pepper!

Yes, I will make it again. I used all the ingredients the recipe called for with a little tweaking: 4 fingerling potatoes , 1 carrot, about 4 celery stalks, added thyme, 2 tsp. minced garlic, 2 tsp. cumin, pinch of cinnamon, nutmeg and a little curry powder. My husband loved it!

I have made this many times and it’s always great. I do add few dashes if nutmeg, 1/4 tsp cinnamon,  cayenne and sub a sweet potato. I also added about 2 more cups of broth because I do double the vegetable and I want more soup:) always great! 
Bake your squash too at 375 for 45 min

I roasted the whole butternut an hour at 400 and followed the recipe additions from the Captain Morgan suggestions. I tried it both ways and although I love Cpt Morgan in Diet Coke, I thought the without version was slightly better. What kicked it up for us was adding more chicken stock flavor. We used Better Than Bouillon Roasted Chicken available at Costco and that seemed to give it it the depth of flavor.  Off to another fund raiser with this soup!

I used sweet potatoes instead of regular potatoes, and low sodium chicken broth.  When serving, I salted to taste in the bowl with sea salt, and sprinkled with a dash of cinnamon and nutmeg. My husband loved it.  It was so delicious!

Great soup.  I added Cumin and Mace but otherwise left it as written.  When browning the veggies in step one, it's probably best to do in multiple batches if you have a smaller pan.  Too much at once and you'll end up with steamed veggies instead of browned ones, and the overall result won't be as tasty.

Made it with some of the changes others mentioned. I oven roasted the squash first, along with 3 carrots and a large onion.  I also added garlic , cinnamon, nutmeg, and a dash of sherry - omitting the potatoes all together, would make again!

Pretty good. I added the garlic and some other additions from the reviews. It was still “missing” something, but not bad. I will make again with more additions.

First time using a summer squash.  The recipe was very easy.  The hardest part was cutting and peeling the squash.  I would make this again.

This was yummy. I roasted all the veggies together and then blended with the stock. I also added nutmeg to my taste. A very good basic recipe. Will definitely do it again.

This tasted OK, but one thing is that mine came out looking *nothing* like the picture. Instead of orange-ish, it was gravy-brown. Anyone else have this experience?

I chose this recipe b/c I happened to need one that would help me use up a bunch of produce that I had, and I am so glad I did.  It was easy (I am not a very good/proficient cook) and delicious, and I would definitely make it again.  B/c of my partner's high blood pressure I used no-sodium chicken broth, but I found that with just a little Himalayan salt added at the table it was just right.  (I also happened to have some fresh parsley that I wanted to use up so I threw it in the soup before I blended it and it added a nice flavor.)

This is a really great and easy soup for fall when the harvest is at your finger tips. I took the extra time and roasted the squash, carrots and sweet potato in the oven. It made  peeling the squash really easy, I omitted the celery as I always find it overpowering in some soups and  also changed out the potatoes to sweet potatoes.  Served with a dollop of sour cream and a sprinkle of nutmeg!  Great make ahead soup as you can make a double batch and freeze the rest!

I made it with pre-cut squash and carrots and cinnamon. I made double so I use 32oz of veg and 32 oz of chicken broth. I roasted the squash and carrots in the oven at 425 for 45 mins before putting them in my vitiamix with the broth. It was amazing!! No potatoes. Roasting the vegs in the ovens with the garlic olive oil gives it a new dimension.

I have made this 3 times now. The first two times as written and loved this recipe. Everyone has personal tastes, so today I changed things up. A lazy, blustery fall day with time on my hands.I baked 2 medium butternut squash. Roasted a large onion, carrot, celery and a clove of garlic. Let the vegetables cool.

As per other reviews, I baked the butternut squash first at 400 for 50 minutes... could have used a good 20 minutes more to make the skin really tender and easy to peel.  In addition to salt and pepper, I added turmeric, cinnamon, oregano, nutmeg, and a dash of red chili pepper flakes. Turned out great!

Loved it and will make again.  Cut the recipe to 1 potato instead of 2 and added a pinch of nutmeg, maybe a teaspoon of cinnamon, and a clove of garlic for added flavor.  My family gobbled it up!

Followed recipe as is. I loved it. If you have never worked with a butternut squash before, it helps to pierce with a knife a few times and either put it in the microwave for 4 minutes or bake it 15 minutes. The squash will be easier to cut.

I doubled the  amount of carrots and celery listed in the recipe and also added a clove of garlic.  It was fantastic!  I made a double batch and we hardly had any leftovers.   I will definitely make this again!

Loved this easy recipe.  Like some of the other recommendations, I added garlic, cinnamon, nutmeg, and curry powder.   Used olive oil to saute instead of butter, and I baked the squash.  Once it was all cooked and pureed,  I had a small amount of coconut milk (less than 1/4 cup), so I added that to the puree along with some half and half (1/2 cup) to pot, than a sprinkle of nutmeg with top of each serving.  So yummy.  Made it on the first real rain day this fall -- thank you for sharing.

I’m vegan so I used vegetable stock instead of chicken broth and I added some spice ( allspice, cumin and thyme). It turned out really good   I will definitely make it again.

I took the advices of other members and used 1tbs of ground ginger, 1 tbs of nutmeg, 1tbs of cinnamon. I also added fresh ginger 1tbs for added spice and warmth and fresh milk, 3c for creaminess. 

 I sauteed the ginger with 1 tbs minced garlic separately, then added to the rest of the ingredients. After cooking down the veggies I put everything into a soup pot.

I prepared the recipe as written, adding 2 teaspoons salt, 1/2 teaspoon pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon rubbed sage. 

I enjoyed it very much, so I took some over to my daughter and her family to try. She texted me saying, "Well, Dad is really missing out. That soup was amazing. Thank you!! I'm going to need the recipe." 
Even though my husband wasn't interested in even sampling it (he's not a soup OR winter squash fan) I'll be making it again, for sure.

I made a few alterations to this, as I tend to be the kind of person to only follow a recipe loosely. I used boiling onions and 3 stalks of celery, 2 large russet potatoes, more butter than what they called for, and I added mushrooms. Other than that I think the rest was the same? Oh, I added a few spices they didn't add as well (garlic salt with parsley, garlic powder, and I used both white pepper and black pepper). I used an immersion blender at the end (a bit messy but easier clean-up than a blender). It came out amazing.

Made this as a starter to Thanksgiving dinner on weekend and it was a hit! Roasted the squash in oven night before then sauted, then transferred to vitamix to blend and heat up. Added a small splash of cream just before serving. So quick and easy!

This is a homerun recipe. I used shallot instead of onion, omitted the potatoes, and used cinnamon instead of nutmeg and it was beyond fantastic! My husband said it’s a no spoon soup, you literally want to just drink it. If you have an immersion blender that saves a step and makes it so perfectly smooth. ????

Mine turned out thick and creamy, and so delicious.  I used a bit more butter than it called for since the squash I had was pretty large.  I also used 2 carrots.  I will do this one again!

I made this today first time making soup.  Recipe Was amazing  delicious  The only thing I added different was a hole stick of butter that I used to  sauté the veggies a little bit longer and I added a bit of garlic powder.  I topped it off with smoked Gouda cheese and bacon bits.  So delicious

This recipe makes a good base. As previous reviewers suggested I precooked my squash in the oven. I didn't have any potatoes, so I subbed leftover mashed potatoes, added cinnamon,  and a chicken boullion cube for flavor (IMO it would've been a little bland without those additions).
I served the soup with sour cream and croutons. I would definitely recommend using this recipe as a base and expanding on it to suit your own tastes.

Easy to make but boring, with very little seasoning and flavour. Added some nutmeg which made it a bit better.

I will make again - would like the nutritional information to 
Include portion size.  Read some of the reviews and will try adding a few spices that were suggested the next time I make it.

This soup was amazing!! I never made butternut squash soup before, so this was a first. And it came out perfect - but I used the tips from other comments to do it.

- Roast the squash first for an hour in a 400F preheated oven, making sure to rotate the squash every 15 minutes
- Only use one potato and the butternut squash (omit the celery, carrot and onion) 
- I used vegetable stock instead of chicken stock
- Add 1/4 tsp curry powder, 1/4 tsp cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg to give it flavor
- When serving, add a dollop of sour cream and some fresh cut cilantro on top (AMAZING)

I highly recommend trying the above!

I added eight pieces of cured cooked bacon to the food processor before I puréed. I also substituted red potatoes (skin on) for regular potatoes and added a handful of fresh parsley and 1 TBSP garlic powder to the soup as it simmered.

The recipe is good as is, but I added:  1 (8 oz. package of cream cheese), and nutmeg and cinnamon to taste.  Those few items aren't needed, but they add a lot of extra flavor.

Hands down the best butternut squash soup I have made. I have tried 4-5 different recipes and I like this one the best because it is rich but not heavy. We don't add the heavy cream that other recipes love to put in - the squash makes it creamy enough!

This soup is INCREDIBLE. It's so easy to make and its easily one of my favorites now. I made this for my boyfriend and he was skeptical about the soup vs the butternut squash cube chunks usually roasted. He LOVED the soup. 100% recommend. It's a surprisingly light soup for so much starch in it! It also makes enough leftovers for 3 days for 2 people.

Delicious! 
I made a few changes: I baked the squash whole and the potatoes first, used vegetable broth, sauteed 3 cloves of garlic with the the other veggies, only blended less than half of the veggies  (because we love chunky soup), added a cup of cooked short grain brown rice after blending, about a cup of almond milk, and a few shakes of turmeric, red pepper flakes, and basil.

At first, I followed the recipe as written when I made this soup. Like other reviewers, I thought that it tasted quite bland. Later on, I made it a second time using the suggestions given by other reviewers but I still think that it tastes bland.  I'll try a different recipe next time.

Made this recipe without changing any ingredients. Due to time constraints, I pulled out my stove-top pressure cooker and it was ready in no time!! It was delicious! Everyone loved it, especially my 3 and 5 yr olds.

Will make it again. I'm not a squash lover but I really liked it.
- Used 3/4 of a medium onion instead of a small onion
- Used ~4/5 of a large(ish) butternut squash
- Added a bit of Thai Curry paste after main cooking by taking out a bit of soup, mixing in the curry and then returning it to the pot
- Used a food processor instead of a blender - worked well

After reading the “The least positive” reviews and how bland it tasted I decided to tweak and make it my own.
In addition to the ingredients posted I added brown sugar, ginger, and cinnamon. At the end I added black pepper.. it was delicious! Full of flavor.

Really good.  Took advice of other reviewers and used sweet potato instead (one largish one) and skipped the celery.  Also, make sure you add the sour cream too---really tasty soup.  Now my best recipe for butternut squash soup!

My review is for the recipe without  any modifications other than replacing the celery with celery salt because some reviewers said it made the soup stringy. It is so hard when people describe all the changes they made to a recipe on here and then give their own version five stars!  This soup was tastier than I expected but it wasn't very thick. I added a bit of cream and 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper which made it better, but if I make it again, I will add more potatoes and carrots or leave some of the veggies unblended.

I made a bunch to freeze. I omitted the celery (didn't have any) and added a bit of cinnamon and cayenne pepper. The right amount of salt is crucial. This is a great, healthy recipe!

I made this for the first time and it was delicious. However I had difficulty with peeling the squash. So i boil it in water to soften it up, then add it in with the other ingredients in a seperate pot. I also did not used the celery because, my daughter is allergic to it and i use a hand blender to smooth it out and 1cup of creme to make it creamy. I have 3 girls and they loved it

I made it exactly as the recipe states and loved it.  Froze individual portions in baggies and it tasted great after 3 weeks.  Added a little salt and pepper after reheating and it was awesome! Great clean eating recipe.

I used olive oil instead of butter and squeezed a little minced garlic into it. Otherwise, I followed the recipe, except that instead of adding broth until I liked the consistency I added an entire quart (because that's what was needed to cover the vegetables), then left some of it (nearly two cups) in the pot in the process of transferring everything else to the blender. I reserved the extra liquid for some future use, like cooking rice. I will definitely make it again. It's very easy and incredibly delicious.

This came out great! It was so simple and to whip up, and truly can be made with almost any vegetables you happen to have in your kitchen. Very satisfying, and yummy if you add a dollop of sour cream or tart yogurt!

So I hate when people say they made this recipe and then changed it but now I’m doing the same. I added about 1/2 cup of whipping cream and I cannot stop eating it! Kept everything else same. Love it!

Made last night, didn’t have celery or chicken stock, just did water and a little seasoning salt instead of stock/broth and it was fine. So creamy and flavorful!

Substited the potatoes for one large sweet potato and kept the carrot. I baked both for an hour; the skin peeled easily. Simmered the tender chopped veggies in the broth for about 25 min to mingle flavors then blended w a generous amount of black pepper and a bit of salt. Omitted the celery. SO GOOD! Next time will make a double batch and freeze.

roasted the pre cut store-bought squash separately
prepared red onion and whole russet, carrot and celery in butter and let it cook about 10 mins to get it more caramelized.
Added the squash last 15 minutes to other veggies and chicken stock. Blended, brought it to a boil with rest of stock.  A dollop of sour cream in my bowl and it was delicious!!!!!

I love this recipe and make it often in the fall and winter. I veganize it by using vegetable broth instead of chicken and olive oil instead of butter (although you could easily use Earth Balance vegan butter instead).

The recipe sounded a little boring, so I spiced it up a bit. 

Added: 
1.5 in of ginger, pealed and placed into pot
1 tbs of Paprika
.5 tbs of lemon pepper
[Removed celery]

I used an immersion blender to blend right in the pot, which worked out nicely. With the added flavor I would give this recipe a 5/5. Healthy, light and clean - really enjoyed it.

With the help from other reviews, I added a few additional spices, and this soup was fantastic. I think the simplicity allows for the squash to really shine. My husband and I loved it. I will absolutely be making this again, it was delicious, easy to make, and had very affordable ingredients!

Delicious and easy to make. I baked the two haves of squash upside down seasoned with avocado oil, sea salt and pepper as well as the potatoes cut in bite size chunks for 30 minutes at 350 first and then scooped the squash  out and added it to my soup pot. I also added to the soup a pinch of thyme and a dash of ground marjoram. Delicious!!!!

Simple and delicious! I didn't make any changes to the recipe (other than only having 2 small potatoes instead of medium). Personally, I had no problem prepping the squash. It took 10 minutes MAX (I peeled it with a vegetable peeler), which is much faster than baking it for an hour! The only problem I ran into was the recipe was too large for my blender. I mashed the remaining soup with a potato masher, which was nice as it kept some chunks in it. Would definitely  make again!

This is the best ever. I followed some of the other suggestions from the other contributors.  I split my squash in half, scooped out the seeds and stringy stuff, sprayed the edges with canola oil spray, then baked cut side down for about 45 mins at 375 degrees.  I also added one clove garlic, a little curry powder, some freshly grated nutmeg and a little cream. I also used a sweet potato and left some of the veggies whole. Even though I didn't have a hand blender and used the regular one, it was not messy.  This soup is easy peezy and is definitely a keeper.

This soup is delicious, easy to make. I added cilantro, garlic, salt and pepper and heavy cream. I didn’t add the potatoe as it problably would’ve taken the squash taste away.

Yes I'd make again! Cooked squash in oven first, used 1 sweet potato, omitted celery and used vegetable broth instead of chicken. MADE AGAIN: used both a sweet and regular potato and I think it dulled the butternut flavor.

I made this recipe today for the first time and it was absolutely scrumptious.  I read some reviews before I made it and was surprised to read that some thought it was very bland in flavor, but also they said they didn't use the carrots or celery?   I followed the recipe exactly except for adding freshly ground seasalt & freshly ground black pepper to the pot while the onions, potatoes, celery, carrots and squash were first cooking.  These seasonings bring out the flavors in all of the vegetables and the juices out of the onions.  Just after the pot started simmering for the 40 minutes, I added 3/4 teaspoon of freshly grated ginger root.  When it was finished cooking I used an immersion blender to puree but made sure to leave pieces of potato and carrot for variety in texture.  This is a very flavorful and healthy soup and my hubby loved it as did I so it's going to be a keeper for me!

This was amazing! I doubled the recipe and added some extra carrots and squash. To make a little creamy i added 0% plain Greek yogurt and i also baked some sausage in he oven and cut it up and added to the soup after finishing. It was delicious and the whole family loved it even the kids!

Diverticulitis friendly, doubled butter & potatoes, no celery, no salt, no pepper. Sautéed on low 25 minutes. Simmered in 3 pints home made chicken stock 40 minutes with lid. Mashed with potatoe masher. Hubby, myself and 1 of 8 kids ate it. *edit* added 1 C rice, simmered 20 minutes.

I enjoyed it.  I winged it as to the recipe as I didn't have it to look at, I used a cup less chicken stock. I used carrots and parsnip instead of potatoes. I made a different recipe before that I really liked and it called for a golden delicious apple which gave it a bit of a sweet taste.

Tastes delicious! I made it with 1 sweet potato but next time I’m not including celery, it had too much of a celery taste to it even though it was still a hit!

This recipe turned out delicious. I do not have a blender, so I just left the soup to simmer for longer time and instead of chopping the carrot, celery, onion, and potatoes I cut them into small pieces. As it simmered the ingredients got soft enough to be able to mash with a spoon. One really good soup!

This recipe was so delicious and simple. I used bullion instead of stock, and added about 2TB of lt brown sugar  and a pinch of cinnamon and nutmeg. My son went nuts for this recipe! I also had pureed my pumpkin first so i did not need to blend hot soup. I cooked the soup for 1 hour and let it thicken. At the end I added  2 TB of butter and 1/2 & 1/2 instead of cream. It was still creamy and delicious!

I absolutely loved this soup!  It's perfect as written and so easy to make. I've made it twice. The second time I increased the curry powder to 3 teaspoons but it was too much. And I love curry but two teaspoons is perfect. Also both times I made this I cut the cayenne pepper to 1/8 teaspoon and it gave it a nice warmth but no heat.

This turned out great!!!  I used sweet potatoes instead of a regular potato and I used vegetable broth because 2 of my kids are vegetarians.  I added in 1/2 tsp. of curry powder at the end along with 1 tsp. salt and 1/4 tsp. black pepper.  There seems to be a lot of debate about whether or not to include celery, but I did and I thought it was fine.  Next time, I will add in a honeycrisp apple and white pepper.  I've been making butternut squash soup for the past 10 Thanksgivings and I've finally found THE recipe.  Thanks so much for sharing!

Delicious and smooth. I added some additional spices as most reviews called it bland without. I used Old Bay, thyme, 2 bullion cubes, salt, pepper and nutmeg. Very easy. I cubed the squash but could easily bake it.

I Loved this soup!  Even my husband, who is a true carnivore, raved about it.  I precooked the squash in the oven, substituted an apple for the potato, and added 3 carrots  and allspice as my seasoning.  I added just enough broth so as to keep it thick, and puréed it in the pot.

Maplebird’s Butternut Squash Soup is superb!  Not that I am lazier than she or my fellow reviewers, but I picked up a package of peeled, cut butternut squash at Trader Joe’s and a sweet potato.  I “destrung” the celery before cutting it and added dashes of garlic, curry, cinnamon, and nutmeg.  I also added a can of drained pinto beans for extra protein before blending in batches until smooth.  This soup made even an 87-degree Arizona afternoon seem autumnal!  Thank you, Maplebird!!

This was delicious. To make it easier, I cooked the squash in the oven first and then scooped it out to put into the soup. Delicious! Have tried it 2ways. 1 w/a little nutmeg and 1 w/a touch of curry.

Great recipe -  I tripled it and used two sweet potatoes instead of regular and thinned the boil with a Miller High Life (this is a sweet corn beer - Busch would be similar)  It is very very good with very little seasoning at all.

We really enjoyed it. Not overly sweet. I did make a couple changes. I added 1 medium sized sweet potato instead of the carrots and potatoes. Also added cinnamon to each bowl to taste.

A very good soup to use up those extra butternut squash. A couple of additions I've made is a dash of nutmeg and coriander as savory elements.

I loved this soup. It was easy to make, and did not require as much time as roasting the squash before mixing it into the pan with the rest of the ingredients. The taste was amazing.

Delicious! I omitted the potatoes and celery because I didn't have any on hand. I also roasted the squash in the oven before cooking on the stove top. I served it with sour cream (a must!) and sprinkled some brown sugar on top. Husband loved it too!

Very easy to make, hard to mess up.  Instead of white potatoes I subbed sweet potatoes. Added garlic to the onion sauté, did not sauté the squash. Once I added the broth, and squash I added  ginger, rosemary powder, gave it a sweet and savory taste. 
Really an easy base recipe that you could do any variation, going to try adding a few apples next time.

I made this recipe for myself, because I just love butternut squash and felt a cold coming on and also bc it has been so cold outside lately. I tthought it would be great to warm me up on a chilly afternoon or evening.  I did not add potatoes bc I thought the carrots and butternut was enough starch and I added a pinch of each cinnamon, nutmeg and ground cloves. it turned out delicious. Even my picky 12-yr old loved it!!

I am not sure how to rate this? I am between 3 & 4 stars. The soup was good. It had a sweet taste to it but something felt missing? I made this exactly as written and it came together easy enough. In the end it was good on its own but adding some, cream and cinnamon would enhance it. I have only had butternut squash once before in my life and that was maybe 20 years ago so I really have nothing to base this on.

Baked the butternut squash at 375 until the skin was brown and could create a dent with the back of a spoon. (used one small and one medium). 

In butter and olive oil, sautéed the onion, carrot and celery until soft, used a bit extra carrot for added sweetness.  salted and peppered the raw veggies. Added garlic let that get aromatic. added one cubed and peeled sweet potato. added chicken bouillon and water (will use chicken broth/stock next time). Let sweet potato get soft.  added baked butternut squash scooped out.  Purred with immersion blender.  Added half of standard box of cream cheese.  blended again.  

Yummmm, would be great with crusty bread

Definitely a great base soup. Healthy and very easy to make.  I read multiple reviews and took several reviewer's suggestions to replace white potatoes with sweet potato, leave out the celery and roast the quash before adding to pot.  All super suggestions.  I also used a homemade vegetable broth rather than chicken broth. As for the pinch of this or the pinch of that, I tried several variations in small sample bowls.  Top four add-ins:
#4 brown sugar and sour cream, #3 cinnamon and sour cream, #2 curry and sour cream and the #1 add-in...Balsamic glaze and you guessed it, sour cream.

Delicious!  Made it with my sister this evening.  Took a hint from the comments and scaled back on the potato and added curry powder, cinnamon, and nutmeg.  Also threw in a little splash of half&half at the end just for kicks and garnished with bacon.  Very doable and so yummy!

DELISH!!  But only because I added 1/4 tsp. each of the following:  nutmeg powder, cinnamon powder, garlic powder and Adobo seasoning for the salt and pepper.  I just felt the recipe would be too bland and the seasonings I added were just right for our family, making this a hit.  Enjoy!

I thought it would turn out quite bland if I followed the original recipe, so I added nutmeg powder, cinnamon powder and garlic powder as well. Served it with Italian garlic herb croutons. Tasted awesome.

Follow the reviewers suggestions: one potato. One carrot. One celery.
Added garlic, cayenne, s+p, curry paste, and some cinnamon/nutmeg to the pot after adding the stock. The curry makes it vibrant and deliscious. Also roasted the squash. I had a small squash but it's a big pot of soup!
AMAZING, but can imagine it being bland if not for the changes.

Delicious.  Thick and creamy with no cream! I had a big squash,  so I doubled the recipe.  The only changes I made were vegetable broth, and added a sprinkle of oregano (mostly to add a little color). 
Can't wait to have it again.

I added a can of coconut cream. Yum! I didn’t add potato because I didn’t have any and because it is more carbs. I used the squash already cut up from Trader Joe’s. Easy! Also I added a chopped up apple for flavor. Love that hint I received.

It turned out great!! I did make a few adjustments though. I baked the butternut squash in the oven with butter, cinnamon and a little nutmeg. Instead of regular potatoes I used sweet potatoes. I didn’t use the celery but I added garlic. It came out so well! I did use the entire 32oz of chicken stock, more would’ve been nice. Next time. I will definitely be making this again!

Excellent as is.  Some will like a couple shakes of curry powder and cinnamon.  I need garlic and this recipe was well suited for that addition. I always bake butternut squash w/o the seeds in a pan with a half inch of water because it is just too easy.  Enjoy.

Read several recipes before I started and did halve butternut squash cleaned out seeds and roasted in oven at 375' for about 40 mins until tender along with carrots and a granny smith apple. Used  vegi broth on stove  and cooked 3 stalks celery and 1 lg. Onion until tender. No potatoes. When squash tender, Peeled and added to vegi broth with carrot and apple, out of corander so used cumin. Fresh grated nutmeg., cinnamon, sage, simmered on low 20-30 mins. Cooled bit. Then proccesed in batches thru blender. Returned to pot. Added vegi broth if got to thick but let simmer on lowest temp. Another  20-30 mins.  Cooked up prosciutto nice and crispy. Served with lil dollop of sour cream , fresh thai basil and crumbled prosciutto. Very good.

Pureeing soup creates the illusion of adding cream, but without the calories, and it doesn't mute the spices like dairy is wont to do. I actually LOVED the soup but with a bunch of changes: swapped out potatoes for sweet potatoes, added a few cloves of garlic, cinnamon, and nutmeg. And I crumbled bacon atop every bowl.

My family was split. 2 of us couldn't get enough of the soup. 2 of us hated it. My son didn't like the texture and was gagging. So... it's polarizing.

Peeled  & removed seeds  of 1 large Butternut squash, .1 medium onion....2 med. potatoes & l  carrot (peeled) cut all veggies  in chunks.... (left out the celery).. 2 cups of chicken broth..salt/ pepper (white) to taste...cooked it in my pressure cooker  (10 minutes  under pressure).  Used an immersible blender...then added 1/2 cup Orange Juice, (or you can use 2 Tablespoons of frozen OJ concentrate).  Served it with a dollop of sour cream....YUM!  Kids said it reminded them of the orange cream Popsicles  from summer.

Made this soup.  Only added one potato and added some garlic.  Also, I roasted the butternut squash before adding it.  It is simple and delicious!

Delicious!  Thought about cooking the squash first but it was very easy to peel so followed the recipe pretty much as is... More celery , another carrot and another potato . Froze half for later and it turned out fine ....

This is a delicious soup! I made it according to the recipe, then added about 3 cloves garlic, 1/2 tsp each of thyme and marjoram, 2 dashes of cayenne, and 3 dashes of nutmeg. Pureed 3/4 of the soup, and then added 1/2 cup half n half. Wonderful!

This was a nice healthy soup with beautiful velvety creaminess. My son and I thought it was missing something....maybe a little acid or something. He added some truffle to his and then wolfed it down. I added a little horseradish mustard. It was better with a little zing.

I made this (for the first time ever) last night for today's church fellowship luncheon. It came out fantastic! I modified it a little, but the original recipe was an excellent guide for me so thank you! I used 7 1/2 lbs. of butternut squash, 2 Large Russet potatoes, 3 medium carrots, 3 celery stalks, 2 med.-large onions, 1 - 32oz. Progressive "No salt" chicken stock and 1 - 32oz. Natures Promise "low sodium" chicken broth.
I followed the recipe but found the cooking time to be much longer than 40 min. (I will cut the squash much smaller next time). As it started to thicken up and I started losing moisture I had no extra chicken stock to top it off so I used some whole milk. Doing this made it creamy and it came out fantastic! I will do it again next time too. This amount I cooked yielded plenty to fill a decent size crock pot. My soup got rave reviews. Enjoy!!!

Came out very good!  I made the following adjustments:
- Added a dash of curry, red pepper, garlic powder
- Omitted celery
- Roasted the butternut squash in over, which is easier than peeling

Great recipe and easy to make. I tweaked the recipe a bit. Used 3x as much butter to brown the veggies, which of course makes the soup taste extra yummy. I also used curry and cumin to season the soup to give it some depth.

I really like this soup.  However, I thought it was a little bland, so I usually add  a tablespoon of minced fresh ginger and a garlic clove to give it a little kick.

Ok, where do I begin . This took FOREVER TO MAKE. I read through the reviews and  followed some of the tips I thought would be helpful. I roasted the butternut squash for an hour, added sour cream, and cinnamon at the end. I didn't have nutmeg on hand (but I'm sure it wouldn't have made a difference) . I omitted the celery and added two cloves of garlic   and one potato to sauté with the butter for a few minutes, and covered it with chicken stock.  The texture was beautiful once I placed it in the blender. Soft and shiny BUT bland. So very bland . I really wanted to love this but was so disappointed. I expected something more. Instead I got a flavor similar to the afterthought of butternut squash. Maybe I'll try with different adjustments :(

This is a great recipe. I added a small amount of curry powder, ditched the celery and potatoes, and added garlic. I did what others recommended and roasted the squash beforehand. I also added 3/4 of a block of cream cheese to the end product. That may account for why it went so fast :)

A great winter soup to really warm you up, but I agree with the other reviews on here, it needs more seasoning.  I went with the concensus and added garlic, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp curry powder,  and a dash of nutmeg.  It was delicious and a perfect consistency.  I found I didn't need to add any cream to it.  Oh and I've made it with both a sweet potato and normal potato and I don't find it affects the recipe either. Use what you have on hand.

To begin, I LOVE Butternut Squash. I used to eat store bought Butternut Squash Soup and now that I have made and saved this recipe; I will never buy store bought Butternut Squash Soup again! SO easy to make and SO yummy! Everyone in my neighborhood was asking for the recipe!

AWESOME recipe!!

Per the recommendations below, I put the butternut squash in the oven for an hour.  I swapped the potatoes out for sweet potatoes, left out the celery, and added nutmeg, cayenne pepper,  curry powder and two cloves of garlic! I added 2 tbsp of sour cream after blending it all together.

I've made this recipe over and over again. My family loves it and my granddaughter loves fall and winter (the time of year when I make it) because she refers to it as yellow soup season! I only use one cream cheese and when done I garnish with sunflower seeds. For Thanksgiving and Christmas I make it the night before and put it in plastic 1 gallon milk carton overnight, easy storage.

Pretty hearty. I swapped rutabaga for the potatoes, other than that followed recipe to a t. Next time I think I'll try adding in a few different spices or leaving the rutabaga out altogether.

Don't listen to the naysayers.  I loved this soup as it is with the exception that I used sweet potatoes.  I also add a dash of Turmeric.  Add any garnish you choose when finished.  They are all a matter of taste.

This was so great!  I didn't know I could make soups like this, never tried. It was very smooth and so much flavor. I added crushed garlic, garlic powder Pampered Chef Parmesan Oil Dipping Seasoning, Pampered Chef Bell Pepper Herb Rub, and Pampered Chef Basil Rub. We Loved it! Earlier in the week I made Chef John's stuffed acorn squash, I had some stuffing mix left over and I can already taste it in this soup!

Very good but yes a little bland.  I added a red pepper and a couple of cloves of garlic as well as about 1/2 teaspoon of curry powder and a pinch of red pepper flakes.  The taste is delicious and it has a very slight kick which I love!

I love this recipe, but I do find it a little bland so I use it as a base to add more things too it. I make the recipe exactly as it calls and after I blend it I add in cubed rotisserie chicken, bacon bits, and spinach leaves. I stir it around and heat up the extra ingredients and then serve it with a loaf of sourdough bread. It is  family favorite here and a staple in our house on cold winter days!  Yum!

I will never, ever attempt to peel a butternut squash again.  EVER!  There's some things I'll pay more for if it's going to make my life easier and save time and frustration! ~~~ 

I followed the recipe and used TWO 20 ounce pre-peeled/pre-cut packages of butternut squash (FRESH not frozen). ~~~

The second time I made it I added garlic while sauteing.  And for more flavor I added just pinches of: nutmeg, cloves and curry powder.~~~Oh, it was yummy!  Cheers!

Made in about 30 min. Put water/broth in kettle with whole carrot, celery stalk and garlic clove, and chunk of onion. While simmering partially cooked squash in microwave 5-7 minutes, then scrapped into kettle. Added seasonings including pinch of curry, nutmeg, hot pepper flakes. Cooked several minutes more then used stick blender to make it thick. Added a dollop of sour cream. Did not use potato, but next time will try with sweet potato. Was super quick and tasty on a cold day. Only 4 stars because I changed it up a bit. Don't like people giving a recipe 5 stars when many changes are made.

I made a vegan, oilless version of this soup and it was delicious just replace the butter  and the chicken stock with low sodium vegetable broth. If you start to eat a whole foods plant based diet that is mostly salt oil and sugar free then you get to taste the real delicious flavors in this soup, and it's healthy. I do like spices however so  I added a little cinnamon and nutmeg .

Tasty and healthy soup to make on a cold winter day. Added chili flakes as well. Husband approved the spiciness.
Some suggested adding nutmeg or cinnamon - I personally wouldn't do that. Enough salt and pepper and the taste of the vegetable puree is good enough. Not bland at all...

Very BLAND as some others have said. I had to add some spices to make it enjoyable rather than edible. Also will people stop rating a recipe 5 stars when you made a ton of changes to it. That is not rating this recipe it is rating your own recipe which is different from the one listed. Some people just read the recipe and see 5 stars and don't see that you added 10 other ingredients and or steps, it is very misleading and annoying. There are thousands of recipes on this site with 5 star ratings for no reason because people so this. STOP IT.

I used sweet meat squash and it was delicious.  We are avoiding dairy so this recipe was perfect.  And yet it was so creamy and rich you would think there was cream in it.  Yum!

this is a great base but I recommend using a sweet potatoe instead of regular potatoes and curry powder to taste. this makes it much more flavorful. also, definitely bake the squash first. It's WAY easier.

Lovely soup. But I did modify as per many of the recommended additions. I doubled this recipe.  To save time I used 30 oz frozen cubed Butternut squash and frozen chopped onions equivalent to 2 .onions, 2 Carrots, and no potatoes and reduced brother by 1/2 cup . I added 2 cloves Minced garlic, 3/4 tsp curry powder,  1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice to sub for cinnamon and nutmeg.  Used 3/4 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp black pepper. Cooked 30 min.  Only pureed half to retain a bit of texture.  I really liked this and feel it's a great base recipe.

I roasted a large squash for dinner then used the additional squash to make this soup.  It was tasty.  I wouldn't go out of my way to make the soup but will certainly use this recipe again when I roast a large squash.    We liked it better with red pepper  to give it the mix of a little spicy/sweet. I may tweak the recipe a little the next time I make it.  I only gave it 3 stars because I can't figure out how to do 3 1/2.  Thanks for sharing

Fabulous soup!!!! My family loved it as well.  I used an immersion blender which made it so easy!  I added 2 tsp minced garlic, pinch of cayenne and about 1/2 tsp of cumin.  So flavorful and healthy!  I will definitely make it again!

Fantastic.    Minor changes......1. Use 1 potato, or add sweet potato instead. 2. For a more flavorful soup, Add 1-2 cloves of fresh minced garlic, a 1/2 tsp of curry, a 1/4 tsp of cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg.

Delicious.  If you want a slightly sweeter taste without adding more sugar, add extra nutmeg.  I also like to add a bit of  cream or half and half just before serving to cool it off and add a creamy taste.  It's very good served with aged cheese crisps like asiago or some garlic croutons.

Very good! I've never used squash much but got some in a csa share and tried this soup. Like others, I baked the squash ahead of time and then just scooped in into the pan.  Added a little bit of garlic powder, curry powder, and nutmeg, topped it with sour cream. It was a hit with my family - who was skeptical when I said I was making a squash soup tonight.

Only five stars with these changes: 
Add garlic in with butter in first step. Add nutmeg, cinnamon, turmeric as simmering. Add  1 tablespoon brown sugar and some salt to taste once puréed.

Loved this soup- especially since it did not contain fattening cream and yet it is still so smooth and creamy

Simple, delicious recipe. I used a little cinammon, dash of nutmeg and cayenne pepper. Sour cream made it very creamy and delicious. I also added about 1/2 cup of captain morgan spiced rum. Fun recipe to play around with.

I was hopeful for this recipe as it didn't have the traditional "fall" spices like nutmeg, cinnamon, etc. But OHH even after reading reviews and suggestion, it lacked flavor. I added a large bay leaf and some heavy shakes of cayenne pepper which helped and it still lacked flavor.  I won't make this again.

This soup is awesome! My husband does not like squash at all but he ate this soup like a dying man! I have made this recipe twice. The first time exactly as written and turned out great. The second time I had a leftover green pepper and sautéed it and threw it in. It was great gave the soup a little pop! Also, I ran out of chicken broth so I used beef and it gave the soup a little deeper and fuller taste. This recipe is a keeper!

I followed the recipe pretty close  and it was perfect! A little dash of nutmeg gives it a nice finish. Also, I don't think it's necessary to roast the squash first, unless you're going for that  roasted flavor.

I didn't have celery so I uses celeriac root instead. I just eyeballed it and cubed it up.  I added about an inch of fresh ginger roughly chopped.

Yum!

I have made this twice now. The first time I followed the directions and cooked it in a pot. The second time I cooked it in a slow cooker. Both times I added two cloves of garlic and a teaspoon of Currie powder. The soup turned out great both times and my wife loves it!

Finally getting around to reviewing this recipe after years of making it. This is, hands down, the best soup ever. Its quick and easy enough to make after work, and it's a great dish to tailor to your individual tastes if you like (cayenne is great, and I like drizzling a little good EVOO on top to finish). If the fall, when farm stands sell butternut squash the size of small children, you can easily double or triple the recipe, pour the cooled leftovers into gallon zipped freezer bags and freeze flat for another day. It freezes great!

This is an incredibly delicious soup! The only thing I did differently when I made it (twice) is that I increased the chicken stock to 48 ounces so that it wasn't quite so thick, and I added a couple of dashes of nutmeg. The second time I made it, I added one chopped apple, which gave it a great flavor. I plan to add an apple every time!

Delicious! Loved that it didn't include any dairy. Roasted the squash at 375 for an hour first. Added nutmeg, cinnamon, ground cloves, garlic and fresh ginger. So yummy!

This soup is buttery and satisfying. I did not make any changes to the recipe, and even my super-picky, vegetable-hating kids (ages 9 and 5) LOVED IT. My 5-yr-old actually asked to take some leftover soup for lunch the next day. (Thank goodness for Thermos!) I highly recommend this recipe.

Add cut up apples and just brown onions instead of everything... Add to crock pot and let cook in chicken broth until soft, then start blender process. Good with curry. Add lots of fresh ground salt and pepper.

It is Awesome!! Thank you so much my reviewers friends. I followed your suggestions and added one sweet potato, a little curry, red pepper flakes, dash of celery seed. The sour cream took it to the next level and bacon bits added to be a show-off.

Really good. I had never had butternut squash before and wasn't sure what to do with it. Made this recipe and will definitely make it again. Made it without celery and with lots of carrots. Also added a bit of cayenne pepper which helped quite a bit.

Made this following some of the other reviewers suggestions of 1) roasting the whole squash in the oven for 1 hour at 400 degress prior to peeling the skin off.  Turn every 15 mins. 2) also wrapped pre-sliced onion and carrot in tinfoil and roasted it as well with a little olive oil.  3) roasted a head of garlic and used 3 cloves of roasted garlic in the soup. 4) left out celery but added celery salt.  5) added 1/2 tsp Cinamon, 1/4 tsp ginger,  nutmeg and a pinch of curry (this does not make the soup taste like curry).  Soup turned out fabulous.  Will definitely make it again!

Had six for dinner so doubled part of the ingredients. Two butternut squash, one white potato, one sweet, half large onion, no celery, one carrot, two boxes chicken broth.  Took the advice to cook squash in oven first.  Added three diced chicken sausage, two cloves of garlic and 1/4 TEASPOON curry (it doesn't take much).  This totally filled my big cast iron pot and I figured I would have lots left over.  Everyone had seconds, the pot was empty!  Served with homemade bread and red wine, a great dinner for a fall evening.

2. For a more flavorful soup, Add 1-2 cloves of fresh minced garlic, a 1/2 tsp of curry, a 1/4 tsp of cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg. 3. Add another 1/2 cup of broth for a thinner consistency after you puree it (but, you be the judge).  Look at other reviews for more flavorful soup.
Made it without the potatoes and celery, and nutmeg. Better 2nd day.

Our first experience with butternut squash and now we have it every other week. I substitute the chicken stock with veggie since I'm a vegetarian. Other than that you can season to taste, add more or less carrots/potatoes as you wish and enjoy. It is a pretty big bash, but I can eat it all week long.

I followed the recipe until the very end. I used my immersion blender to blend. I thought the soup was a bit bland so I added some Allspice and Cinnamon. I will make this soup again, with my additions!

This is a fantastic recipe and I've made it several times for a starter while entertaining. I've gotten more complements on it after adding 1 pack of Philadelphia cream cheese and a few healthy squirts of sriracha while blending. It makes it a little thicker, richer, and the sriracha gives it some underlying complexity - which the original recipe lacks.

This was delicious. Simple and delicious. I like it do much better than the heavier versions that use cream. Immersion blender was the perfect tool to make it smooth.

The Butternut Squash Soup turned out wonderful! Here are some cooking tips I would give: 1. You MUST cook the Squash before you peel and seed. Take my word, it is literally IMPOSSIBLE to cut a cold raw Squash. 2. Do not use celery or 2 potatoes, use only 1 potato. 3. Add an apple in your list veggies to cook in the pot, let's just say you'll be very glad you did. 4. When it's ready, add half a cup of sugar, and a pinch of ginger to season your flavorful Soup. Trust me, if you follow this recipe it will turn out perfectly. Happy Cooking!

Added cayenne pepper and garlic - and served with pumpkin seeds and source cream. Perfect for a windy Autumn night.

Great soup!  I followed everything except I excluded the celery.  I will take others suggestion to bake ahead because it was very hard to cut the butternut squash.  Tasty!

I didn't have celery, so omitted it. I used one large potato (13 oz) and a small butternut squash(15 oz) , but the rest was the same. I garnished the soup with Parmesan and a bit of hot sauce which was not necessary. People may think it's bland - but it seems pretty well balanced to me. I used homemade chicken stock, which may have made a big difference.

Super easy, super quick, flavorful. I used an immersion blender to puree. Worked great.
I will say, however, I must have had a HUGE medium-sized squash. We ate like kings and still got almost 7 large servings from the pot!

I didn't used potatoes b/c I didn't have any, and it turned out great. Also added a few cloves of garlic. I didn't use nutmeg, it's sweet enough. I added paprika to my own bowl and it was a great flavor. countered the sweetness of the squash!

Follow the recipe, except I do bake the squash in the oven @ 400 for an hr.   I also add 1/2 tsp minced garlic, & cumin & drop of hot shot.  I do use at least a 3 to 3 1/2 lb  squash, makes it nice and thick.

I used two different recipes, this and another one from the site.  I used this one and added  8oz of cream cheese to it. This was the first time I had tried a squash soup and the teenagers and hubby loved it!!! It was really good. I used crackers to dunk and it was really good.  Will defiantly make again.

I just made this and it's awesome. Super easy to make and low cost and calorie. Win win! I followed the directions exactly and it blended super well and is the perfect cool weather soup. I added a bit of garlic powder to the onions and butter when starting the soup and it tastes great.

I added just a bit of cumin for some added zing. This looks very freezable so I'm sure I will be using it often as being the senior who lives alone I like to make batches of things and freeze them.

This soup turned out so delicious! It is so easy to make. I had never made butternut squash soup before but will now be making it all the time. I didn't have any potatoes at home, so instead I used an extra carrot, extra celery stock and a little bit of cauliflower (to try and get a bit of the potato texture). It turned out really good! I also used the baby bullet to purée it because I could not find my blender lid, so I had to do it a couple items but then stirred it altogether and it is perfect! I totally recommend this recipe

I sauteed two onions (no carrots or celery) in butter  then added 1 cup broth to cook onion all the way down. Added cubed squash and three more cups of broth and simmered for 45 minutes or so. No need to add potato as the squash thickened nicely when pureed with a stick blender. Added a dash of curry and Cayenne pepper and served with a spoonful of plain yogurt and green onions on top. Oh yeah.

So freaking delicious! I like to roast the squash before hand by cutting it in half, scooping out the seeds, laying it cut side down on parchment paper and baking it at 375 until soft, about an hour. Also I add a 1/2 tsp of curry powder. I've made it a few times, and when I used russet potatoes I had to add extra broth after I puréed, because they were more starchy and turned the soup was way too thick. LOVE it!!

Honestly, this was a good recipe for pureed butternut squash (i.e. baby food), but it's not soup. Not yet. In order to make a nice creamy soup, I added 1-2 tbsp of cornstarch whisked in 1 cup of table cream (you can use milk if you're concerned about the calories), which I poured in while blending. Then simmer a few minutes to thicken. And the suggestion of curry as seasoning? Genius!

Ditto to the roasting of the squash beforehand (I did mine 20 minutes, then let it cool and threw it in with the potatoes and onions to boil)

I added curry, cinnamon, garlic, and juice from several apples! Excellent soup! Well rewarded for the work that goes into cutting up that squash, especially when you double the recipe!

I love this soup just as the recipe is.  Next time I might add some spices others have suggested.  Just as written is pretty good though.  Thanks Maplebird

Excellent recipe. It was nice and thick without requiring cream cheese like some other recipes I have made. I also added about a half a cup of whopping cream to smooth it out a bit. I will use this recipe again next fall!

The original recipe is very good as a base recipe. Following guidance from other reviewers, I added a minced clove of garlic, 1/2 tsp of freshly grated nutmeg and about a 1/2 tsp of curry to my soup. You can just taste the curry as a nice background flavor; it is not overwhelming in any way. Since my squash was a bit larger I also doubled up on the celery & carrots.  I found using an immersion vs. standard blender worked just fine. All in all, a very good soup which I will make again.

I made all the same modifications that Molly suggested. Added a lot of flavor! I forgot to add the Parmesan cheese or Italian seasoning but was just as yummy with the sour cream and bacon. I did also add a dash of cumin (as others suggested); not sure if really made a difference but it tasted very flavorful either way. I was cooking the butternut squash in the oven at the same time as the veggies were cooking so I didn't add the butternut squash to the pot until the last 10 min or so but didn't make a difference, was still tasty! Will definitely make this again!

Very good base recipe!!! I didn't use potatoes or celery but took some advice from previous reviews. I added: pinch of nutmeg, 1/4 cup captain Morgan spiced rum, 1tbsp basil, 1tbsp honey, 1/2 tsp cinnamon & I used 2 cloves garlic and half an onion, salt and pepper - cooked together in 1/4 cup chicken broth and tbsp of butter. Once translucent I added to the big pot. After blending in the blender I added about a cup and a half of milk to thin it out. This was THE BEST butternut squash soup I've ever had. I want to try making it with Rumchata instead of spiced rum I bet it would be even better!

I loved this recipe. So easy to make. Butternut squash was kinda hard to cut but I should have baked it for a bit. I added a pinch of chili powder and a bay leaf. It was my first time making it and it was a success. ??

Delicious recipe. I added a little Chinise Five Spice but it was delicious as is also. We added added a tablespoon of  Greek Yougurt on top mixed with a little  Frank's Hot Sauce for a mock sour cream without the calories.

I make this regularly at this time of year, and I do bake my squash first. I then throw it all into a food processor. Having don that I often do add a bit more chicken stock    as this a very thick soup.

Very good.  Like others I added curry powder and garlic.  Next time I will omit the potatoes but overall a very good soup without a lot of added fat.  I did add low fat sour cream to each bowl.  Yum.

Personal pref. With just a small squash. - extra carrots, no potatoes, 3 shakes cayenne (not enough to be obvious) and one cube chicken bouillon.   Serve with dollop of sour cream.  Yum

I added double the carrots and celery, chili powder, cumin, paprika, cinnamon, one sweet potato, one russet potato and at the very end, a block of regular cream cheese.  It would have been really good without the cream cheese too but I was going for a richer creamier soup.  Delicious!

This was delicious.  I only made a few changes and it was so good my husband actually had seconds (never happens with soup).  I added a tsp of curry powder, only one potato and  two shakes of Hell Flakes (from Top Secret Recipes) because we like a little zing. Thanks so much for this recipe.

So good and so easy. I used cubed butternut squash and store diced onions and celery from Trader Joe's. Microwaved the squash---sorry purists- while sautéing the veggies. And, I followed the suggestions of other reviewers. I used less potato, and added garlic,  cinnamon and ginger. Then a 1/4  cup of rum. Wow, that took the flavor from ordinary to superb.

This recipe is so delicious as is. 
And it's also easy to tweak... I've even subbed in a head of cauliflower for the butternut squash before... or a sweet potato for a regular potato... etc.
I'd say the one thing to be careful of is -  don't overcook the vegetables. Like when cooking potatoes for mashed potatoes, the veggies can become 'water-logged',, which affects/ruins the soup's flavor and texture.

My first time eating butternut squash and making this kind of soup and using an immersion blender.  Not bad!  I thought it was kind of bland, DH loved it,  the kids did not. I may make it again when their taste buds have grown up. I used one potato, 3 whole cloves of garlic, and 5 cups of chicken stock in addition to the other ingredients listed.

A great, healthier version (it didn't call for cream like many recipes ). The only change I made was to roast the squash in the oven beforehand. Will definitely make again.

I thought it was good without any changes, but thought the idea of adding cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg would help to bring out the flavors.  I will make it again.  It is, as someone said, a good base.  And thank you to who it was that suggested the wand blender.  THAT was very useful.  I LOVE allrecipies!   :)

This was decent, but it didn't have a lot of punch. Maybe an add of sherry or apple at the beginning? Next time I'm in the mood for this item, I'm going to try something else.

Only OK the way it is now but with the addition of cumin, curry powder, garlic powder, Saigon cinnamon, nutmeg, and a dollop of sour cream, the recipe became a 5-star soup! These ingredients were added to the chicken stock during the boil down phase. I would also recommend sauteing the vegetables in butter or olive oil first. It gives the soup a nice flavor. I also added thyme, rosemary, basil, salt, pepper, and dried orange and lemon peel to the saute for an extra burst of flavor.  I bought peeled and seeded butternut squash which made things easier. Bacon and any other meat enhancers were unnecessary after adding these ingredients.

I made this with some frozen cubed butternut squash I had.  I also added a little white wine while browning the veggies and some thyme, all spice and a tiny pinch of cumin.  It was really nice!

I made this recipe & was so glad I did!  It's healthy, easy & turned out great!  I thought about adding garlic & wish I had...someone said to add sour cream, so I did.  It made it 10 times better!  I will definitely be making this again!

I just made this and it's good. I followed some of the recommendations (garlic, sweet potatoe, cinnamon, nutmeg, and I added cayenne pepper) and it turned out pretty well if I do say so myself. Initially I felt like it was slightly lacking so I added some brown sugar (I have a rediculous sweet tooth), and I think it gave it just the right amount of subtle sweetness I was looking for.

Turned out great! It was helpful to bake the sweet potato for an hour first at 400 degrees and then I added garlic, red pepper flakes, 1/4 tsp cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg.

I thought this recipe was very bland. I used a sweet potato instead of a white potato and I had to add all kinds of seasonings to it and sour cream before it tasted good enough to eat. I added cinnamon, nutmeg, sour cream, curry. Not my favorite. And go easy on the broth. I used just barely enough to cover the veggies in the pot and it was a little too thin for my liking.

I modified this as suggested by other reviewers, hence the 3 star rating. But as the other reviewers suggested it's a great base and really easy to suit to your liking. I won't repeat what everyone else here has already said but ultimately really enjoyed this with the modifications and that I made this per the directions, i.e. I did not bake the squash but sautéed then boiled. It took maybe 40 minutes start to finish.

I loved the velvety-ness achieved with my stick blender.  Only potatoes, butternut squash, and onion - with bullion stock and 2 Tbsp. curry.  Would be good with half n half, or with other winter squashes.  Good base to try with other spices too, rosemary sounds good, and cinnamon, cayenne if not for kids, could add sausage crumbles after puree.  Hearty, warming soup.

Bland as is, but has great potential.  have made changes as have others, but this is great start.   It really is all based on what you like. I add a clove or two of garlic, a bit of curry and red pepper flakes and a dash of nutmeg. I buy butternut squash pre cut from Costco, but I have also used a whole butternut squash. Super easy to peel and cut.  An immersion blender is a must. Today I am  making this again, but will use a sweet potato rather than just regular potatoes.

this recipe is absolutely delicious. I made it vegan by using no-chicken broth.  I upped the celery and carrots by 2 and halved the onion.   I changed 1/2 of the butter to sesame oil and added 1 clove garlic.  I used red potatoes.    Also I used all 4  cups of broth to  simmer and added 2 more cups after blending.   Garnish with scallions and coconut bacon... Unbelievable!!

I baked the squash whole with small incisions @ 350 for an hour. Put one sweet potato in with squash and chicken broth. Boiled it let it simmer . I actually forgot about it until I smelled it from upstairs. It's Delish!

I made it last night and it was simply awesome.  I had read the reviews and decided to try some of the suggestions.  I halved the recipe because I only had 1/2 a butternut squash but I still put in a whole stalk of celery but halved the other ingredients.  Then I put in a clove of grated garlic, 1/4 tsp. curry powder, a good sprinkle of cinnamon and a slightly less generous sprinkle of nutmeg.  Blended it just until it was broken up by using the pulse button instead of puree.  It didn't need sour cream as some suggested, it was so very flavourful as it was!  And excellent recipe and one I'll make again and again!  Maybe will try a bit of ginger in it too sometime just for a change of flavours.

This is great soup!  I used leftover cooked squash and halved the recipe to match the amount of squash that I had.  I appreciate that this does not call for milk or 1/2 and 1/2.  To make a vegetarian version, use vegetable broth instead of the chicken broth.  Yes, I will make again.  My husband also really liked it.

I made this for Thanksgiving last year and my family enjoyed it so much that I planted extra plants this year and made a dozen batches of the soup to freeze.

This soup was so creamy! You would never know there wasn't cream in it. I sautéed the veggies with white wine and added fresh sage. I also baked the Squash in the oven at 400 for an hour. Delicious!

I used acorn squash because I had it.  I think probably better with butternut, but still good with acorn.  If you like squash, you'll love this soup- very savory.  If you don't like squash- skip it.  I did roast the squash first.  I wouldn't skip that step.

Very good and a different spin on squash soup. My hubby loved it. I used a garlicky Italian sausage instead of the turkey sausage since it was not available. I used only 1 lb of sausage and 1 1/2 cups of corn.

If you are hesitant to make this soup - don't be!  It is even better than I expected.  The only change I made was leaving out the potatoes.

In addition to roasting the squash and  some garlic, and adding the seasonings already mentioned by other reviewers (always curry powder!), I also like to add a piece if fresh ginger while the soup simmers. Coconut milk is a wonderful addition for creaminess. I like the sweet potato addition, too!

My family loves this!  I added 2 tsp cinnamon, some marjoram and garlic powder to spice it up a bit.  Made it twice now and will be making more to freeze for later. I used a wand to puree the soup in the pot to eliminate having to use a blender.  Works great.

This is my family's favorite, and you don't have to change a bit in this recipe.  Serve is with garlic croutons on a chilly fall night, or with crusty french baguette.  This soup is absolutely divine!

I made this but I changed it slightly.

I substituted a large sweet potato and two firm fleshed pealed and cored apples, I used Honey Crisp for the russet potato. I also added ¼ cup of Pinot wine and ¼ tsp white pepper. I make lots of soups many of which are pureed so I used my Bamix hand held blender to puree the soup in the pot.

Served with an un-sliced baguette and I dropped in some fresh uncooked broccoli crowns just before serving.

It’s big hit around my house and there are never any leftovers.

Yummy. I cut the recipe down to just 1 serving. Used leftover cooked butternut squash that I had. Really made this a fast soup for lunch. left out the potato because I was out and added garlic and a little squeeze of lemon.

The soup as directed very bland, I'm glad I read the reviews I used a sweet potato, eliminated the celery and used celery seed. I added ginger, cinnamon, pinch of cayenne, minced garlic nutmeg, and a touch of brown sugar. After emulsifying it though left some chunks for texture added half and half as others suggested. Of course I served with a dollop of sour cream everyone seemed to like it nothing was left... I gave it 3 stars because a lot had to be done to it but as a base I would give it 5

I replaced the carrots with about 400 ml (1/2 can) of puréed pumpkin and added 1 tsp each of curry and sage. Delicious with these substitutions!

Great soup! I added a little maple syrup and a small amount marscapone cheese before serving to give an added taste and an attractive white swirl. Judy

Delicious! The only thing I did different, like many others, is bake the BNS in oven for 1 hour at 400 degrees first.

This was great! I read some reviews and made some changes. First I cooked the squash (whole) at 375 for about 45 min and let cool completely. This made peeling and chopping so much easier! I added 3 chopped garlic cloves and used a few glugs (~1/4 cup?) of white wine to deglaze the pan before adding the stock. I might go crazy and add some bulk sasusage next time if I want it richer.

After reading the reviews on how bland this soup was, I made modifications per the suggestions, and it helped give this soup more  flavor. I added more garlic, cinnamon, nutmeg, and spiced rum. However, I want to taste more squash so I may eliminate the potato altogether next time I make this. This soup was ok but only after I made the modifications, otherwise it would've been really bland.

Absolutely delicious and took almost no time at all. I would make this again in a heartbeat. The consistency and taste was perfect. I used the whole 32oz of chicken broth. I also liked that the soup didn't develop a skin after sitting.

I like this recipe however, I did add the ingredients suggested by Molly ie, spiced rum, nutmeg, cinnamon, minced garlic, half-half and used only one potato instead of two. I also added 2 Tbsp of Agave because I like this soup slightly sweeter. I came out delicious and creamy.

Soup was delicious the way I made it,  based on other reviews. I feel kind of bad changing the recipe, then rating it...that being said, all good cooks alter recipes to satisfy their dietary likes/ needs. I Baked the squash- added butter and brown sugar before baking.  For the potatoes, used a lg. sweet potato only, my homemade chicken broth-- I freeze in 4 c. serv.-- so worth the effort!!! Garlic 1 lg.  pc., saute w/ veggies add 1 tsp. curry powder and the other seas.  Serve w/ a spoon of sour cream.  My husband and I both  thought this was really delicious!

I followed some other reviewers tips. I used two sweet potatoes in place of the potatoes. I didn't use the celery at all. Three cloves of crushed garlic.  I also threw in a large apple.  I baked the squash whole as others suggested. 1/2 teaspoon of curry powder and half teaspoon of apple pie spice. A dollop of sour cream in each bowl.  Next time I think I might grill all the veggies prior to putting them in the soup pot to add another dimension.

This soup was amazing! The only changes I made were adding some nutmeg and curry powder to the soup. Other reviewers said that the celery made it too stringy, so I used less than called for, but I didn't find it stringy at all so I will use the proper amount of  celery next time because I love the subtle flavor it adds. I used a Ninja blender, which did a fantastic job pureeing the soup, leaving no lumps or strings. My husband was very skeptical because it looked like baby food when I pureed it, but after trying it he can't stop talking about it. It was especially tasty and pleasing to the eye with a dollop of sour cream. I will definitely be making this again as a starter for our fall/winter dinner parties. Thank you so much for this fantastic recipe!

Only thing I did differently was using red potatoes because that's what I had. I thought I would be disappointed since the recipe didn't have cream or milk. The soup turned out savory and delicious.

This is great as written, I didn't need to add any salt because the chicken stock had some in it. I added shredded chicken, cayenne, and paprika for a spicy chicken version but all that is not required to make it a wonderful soup.

This is a delicious, creamy and low fat soup.  The only change I made is adding about a tablespoon of chopped ginger, because we love it.  I had no problems with stringy celery, just needs to be chopped small and simmered until all veggies are soft.  I used red potatoes and didn't peel them, and they also pureed perfectly. Browning the veggies until they are golden gives this soup the great flavor.

I had no problem making this recipe as is. I used a handheld blender to puree into a nice creamy soup. Not sure why others had issues with stringy celery strands? Perhaps you didn't boil the ingredients long enough. Find it too thick? Add more stock or partially cover with lid as you simmer so liquid doesn't evaporate as quickly. Tastes fresh and wholesome.

1. Leave out the regular potatoes, we all know they can be bland. This soup doesn't need a starchy filler. If you do use one, do what the others say and use a sweet potato. 
2. Leave out the celery, it's gonna be stringy and a bit funky. 
3. Use or get a hand blender. They're not terribly pricey and will make your life so much easier!
4. Reserve 1/4 of the chunky chopped squash and blend the rest. Then add the chunks, otherwise it will be like a bowl of baby food. 
5. Add some other spices in here, a dash of nutmeg and even a TINY bit of cinnamon or some curry seasoning wouldn't hurt. Be careful with the curry, there's a fine line between a beautiful soup with an addition you can't put your finger on, and curry squash soup. 
5. Ok, here's the kicker - when you've chopped up the stuff and put it in the pot, add half a peeled and hard diced apple. Mmmmmmm 
The key to this soup is breaking up the texture of the soup, so leaving part of it chunky shouldn't be under rated. Really good with a hearty salad and a fireplace!

I've made this every fall for 3 years and sometimes two or three times every year. This is so delicious I just follow the recipe as is, but I have added red pepper occasionally, just to add a little kick. I think browning it a bit in the butter just adds another layer of flavor. I don't blend it in the blender as my family doesn't like it that smooth, so I take a potato masher and smoosh it a bit, leaving it a bit lumpy. If I have some bacon on hand I'll add that on top just before serving it. It's a fall family favorite and is always requested!

I love the simplicity of this recipe.  I have made many variations of butternut squash soup without a recipe.  I left out the celery but added a 1/2 tsp of celery powder for flavour. I also enjoy the added taste of freshly grated nutmeg and a clove of garlic. If you prefer a little sweeter, try adding maple syrup and a pinch of cinnamon as well. Such wonderful versatility....

Be prepared to "make this your own". The only change I made was using one sweet potato and one white potato. The recipe on its own is quite bland but gives you a great opportunity to add whatever seasoning suits your fancy.

This is a go to recipe for me now. I rarely cook it exactly as written, using whatever veggies or squash I have on hand. I also add some leftover diced ham if I have any on hand. My picky family of boys loves this recipe however it comes together.

Good soup!  Even my us and who doesn't like butternut squash said it was good.  I made it once with a pinch of curry and it overpowered it.  The second time I made it as written and it was much better.

This soup was a little bland as written so I made a few changes as suggested by others. I baked the squash at 400 for 1 hour, added curry powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, and topped with sour cream.

Very good.  As others recommended used 1 sweet potato and one regular, and used the celery and carrot per the recipe.  I did add a pinch of curry and some garlic, and topped with sour cream.  I will definitely make this again; my whole family enjoyed this for Thanksgiving this year.

Loved it!  I made butternut squash soup before w cream cheese and didn't like how heavy it tasted!  This was a good combination and really brings out the natural taste and aroma of the squash!  I added some Cajun pepper and sour cream for added flavor!  Suggest letting it simmer for another hour to really let the flavors out!!  :)

Wonderful recipe! We followed directions as written except I baked squash first and added to other veggies. Instead of butternut squash I used buttercup squash. Very rich flavor and the color glorious! Served with a splash of sherry in each bowl and a dollop of sour cream. A must for holiday dinners! Thanks for posting!

I made it for the 1st time tonight. It's one of the most delicious soup I've ever made & except for half an apple added, followed recipe adding lots of pepper & bit of salt. Paired it with home made garlic toast it was a match. Simply perfect for the sub zero weather.  Will definitely be making this again.

Fantastic!   Cut the recipe in half. Omitted the celery and potatoes.  Sautéd 1 tsp garlic, 1/2 onion, 1 cubed sweet potato and 1 carrot in 1 Tbls butter with a little salt and pepper.  I added 2 cups of water with a vegan vegetable bullion cube by Rapunzel.   Once the water boils away, I added 1 cup water and 1 cup of milk.  Added 1 tsp of a curry blend season and squash.   Used a hand blender to make smooth.

Fantastic!  I cooked the squash by cutting it in half and covering it with plastic wrap, put in the microwave for 20 min then let it sit for 10 min before removing from microwave. Cooked perfectly, scooped it out, and added it to soup and pureed soup in blender.  Seasoned with sea salt, pepper and 1/2 tsp allspice. Perfect!!!

Great recipe, Don't be afraid to freestyle a little with it. Use nutmeg, allspice, pepper and cumin to bring out the wonderful flavours of the base ingredients. I have had many requests to make this again! Love it! I would suggest that it takes a little longer than 5 minutes to 'brown' the veg base. Try 10-15 minutes. The extra time is worth the concentrated flavours!

I made this today.  The first time I make a recipe I try and follow it exactly before I make changes so my review is based on the original. However,  this time, I made a few (very few) changes but I don't think it made that major a difference so I will rate away. 
I began by piercing the squash and microwaving it for 10 minutes.  Easy-peasy pealing.  I did not use celery as I do not like celery in things and I did not use the regular potatoes.  I used a sweet potato as my squash was kind of small and I thought this would help.  I did the rest the same, but added about a tablespoon of freshly ground ginger and a dash of cayenne pepper. I served it with a dollop of sour cream.  The soup was amazingly good.  Oh, I used my stick blender to puree. 
 I don't think the changes I made took that much away from the original recipe.  It was excellent. Thank you for sharing.  I will not buy Trader Joe's in a box any longer.

This is the second winter and third time I've made this soup; I think it's awesome! I actually like the recipe as listed, but I do change up the directions just a tad. I cook down the onions and celery first to bring out more flavor, I add the salt and pepper when I add the stock (I also add minced garlic), and I use vegetable broth instead of chicken because of family vegetarians.  
Tip: Before you blend or puree your vegetables, remove a cup of the stock from the pot. That way when it is all pureed you can add in the some seasoned stock (not the bland box stock) if u want to change the consistency.
Great recipe! Thank you, Maplebird!

Make this every fall for the past 3 yrs. I add nutmeg to it. The potatoe provides a good balance to the soup.

I happen to agree that if you follow this exact recipe it can be bland.  I added some sage and some nutmeg though not too much.... Just to give it a little of that holiday flavor.   I also used my handheld blender and mixed it up right in the pot.   Came out awesome and I froze most of it since I am hosting thanksgiving.  One less thing to think about.

Outstanding basic recipe, with full credit to Maplebird for the original inspiration! Like many others, I took some liberties according to my (and my wife's) taste - and tendency to want to change things 'just cause.' I vertically halved a fairly large squash and microwaved it (high) about 15 min in a half-inch of water - it was easy to scoop out the flesh with a grapefruit spoon. I cubed one Idaho potato and one sweet potato, and parboiled them briefly before adding them to the skillet (olive oil) with the sautéing onion - to which I had added two cloves minced garlic. I omitted the carrot due simply to taste, and added a minced fresh jalapeño (seeded) pepper to the onion/garlic/potatoes mixture. I transferred the sautéed mix and squash to a soup pot, along with about four cups of hot vegetable broth (I'm vegetarian). Brought to a boil with salt, some white pepper, and a shake of red pepper flakes. (Add water/broth as needed to desired consistency.) After about 45 minutes on medium low heat, uncovered, I added half a cup of half-and-half, reduced heat to very low for five minutes, and did not puree. And the required dollop of SC - sour cream - in the bowl...Loved it!

I made this last night for dinner.  I thought it was a little bland so I added 1/2 tsp garlic, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 1/4 tsp allspice and 3/4 cup brown sugar.  Even though I added 1/4 brown sugar each time I thought it was too sweet. I will reduce this next time but definitely thought 1/2 cup was not enough. I also added about 1/3 cup 35% M.F. thick cream.  It was delicious and I will definitely will make this again.  I gave it 5 stars anyway because it's a great starter base!

I gave this 5 stars for both the basic recipe and the reviewers suggestions. I used all the ingredients EXCEPT the potatoes and butter (don't need the starch and fat; just the flavor). I used a slow cooker to soften the squash (LOW setting for 5 hours, then removed and cooled before removing seeds). I turned up the slow cooker to HIGH and added onion, carrot, celery, low sodium chicken stock, 1 clove of garlic and 1/8 tsp. of curry (skipped the sauté step altogether), and boiled the stock for 3 hours. I returned the squash to the slow cooker and pureed the entire mixture for about 2 minutes. Tasted great despite the absence of potato and butter.

Finding a recipe without gluten and dairy is great. This is the first time I have cooked with butternut squash, and I really enjoyed the taste of this recipe. Others say it is bland, but it suits me perfectly.

This was simple and delicious!  It's a nice basic recipe that can be easily personalized.  I added a teaspoon of allspice, three cloves of garlic, and topped it with parmasean. I might try a dash of curry next time like one person suggested. I omitted nothing.

This soup was so delicious!! The only changes I made were that I used a humongous butternut squash (instead of medium) and chicken broth, instead of stock since that's what I had on hand. It was so creamy and hearty. My husband, 4 year old, and I just loved it!

This soup was very good and easy to make, I had left over squash from the center piece from our Thanksgiving Dinner and used it to make the soup. Made some corn bread to go with it and it was a big hit.

Thanks for posting your recipe...:)

I gave this 4 stars because it's a good and easy base for a squash soup. I managed to mess it the instructions and added Miso Ginger Broth from Trader Joe's instead of the chicken broth and it was awesome! I also added a nutmeg and all spice to give it a little kick. I definitely plan on following some of the other suggestions made here by other posters. But my recommendation if you're looking for non-chicken broth is the one I mentioned above. It actually worked!

Amazing soup, I baked my squash in the oven first then scooped out  to make the soup. Adding the squash after browning the other ingred. Yummy

Took users suggestions and roasted squash and spooned out.  It was very easy and delish!  Didnt think it needed the sour cream.  Just added fat.

The soup was okay. I don't like squash that much, so that's why.  I added lots of pumpkin pie spice and nutmeg which helped.

I LOVED it!  But found that peeling the squash time-consuming.. I've never done it before so must be an easier way.  I didn't blend the whole amount, left a few junks of vegetables to chew on.  having something to chew always makes you feel more full at the end of the meal.

Easy, delicious, healthy and cheap to make. What more do you want? Just make sure to add quite a bit of broth as it can be very thick. Eyeball it when nearly done.

Recipe was good, but needed (in my opinion) something to make it creamy. I opted not to blend it, since I like the chunkiness - I ended up just using a whisk to mash most of the chunks. I also added a splash of almond milk and a bit of parm cheese.

I don't really get all the negative reviews. I followed the recipe, except I used a hand blender instead of transferring because that's to much of a mess and more dishes to wash! It was really good! I didn't add any garlic which would've been nice additional flavor but w out it, it also tastes great! Definitely making this again...it's easy and a simple flavor. Great for cold nights and to make and freeze and safe for weekday evenings when you don't want to cook and want something yummy to warm up!

First time making butternut squash and was quite pleased. Used celery and a sweet potatoe, plus the carrots, two cloves of garlic and spices mentioned in other ratings. I baked the squash first and it was very easy to peel, seed, and cut up. The sour cream is a must when serving!

This was not difficult to make but produced the blandest soup I think I've ever eaten. I had to add so many spices to this to make it worth keeping that I lost count. Won't be making  this version of butternut soup again.

Easy indeed, but the taste is too blend if you follow the recipe. I added a pinch of nutmeg, a small sprig of thyme. and 1/2 cup half and half cream. Remove the sprig before serving and pour drops of cream on top of each bowl, for a nice presentation.

I made this recipe a few years ago, however it was the base for a bisque where I added lobster.  You need to buy a small whole lobster and sauté it, remove the meat and make a stock with the shells and use that along with the chicken stock.  Makes for a great Thanksgiving accompaniment.
I actually got the recipe from a local restaurant at one of their cooking demonstrations, a lot of work, but worth it

I used 1/2 butter 1/2 olive oil. I shortened prep time by just kind of chunking veggies then using the blender on pulse to leave it "un-perfect" or small chunks in a nicely creamed soup.

I didn't use potatoes.

Yum!

I have made butternut squash soup but I use a bag of grated carrots and one chopped onion and 4 to 5 cups of squash cubed. No potato. When done add 1 cup of cream. Still low in calories. 40 calories per cup

As others said it was a little plain with regular potatoes. I exchanged sweet potatoes for regular and omitted the celery. Added nutmeg and cayenne. Sour cream on top. Amazing!

Instead of butter, I cook bacon and use the bacon grease to cook the vegetables; I add sweet potatoes.  I also add spices (salt, pepper, garlic, nutmeg, etc)  and 1/2 cup of heavy cream.  YUM

I have been making this soup for a few years, My ingredients are very similar to the ones in this recipe, I do not add celery and most of the time I use sweet potato, always onion and chicken broth. I also like to add a little heat either pepper flakes or cumin whatever mood I am in or how sweet the soup tastes, I also add some cream at the end and this makes it a wonderful COLD SOUP. I believe I like this better cold than hot.

I have tried this recipe and find that adding a apple to the mix and a touch of curry powder really makes the difference in making not so of a flat flavor.   Flowerchild!

Wonderful,  warming soup!  I've changed it up according to other reviews .  Sour cream is a must but i always use my mother in laws secret!  Add cardamom to sour cream, let set overnight,  it adds pizzaz!!!

Very good but a little bland still even after adding 1 tblsp. curry 1 tsp. garlic powder and 2 apples. I also cut it to one potato as someone else suggested. I think next time I'll add 2 Tblsp. curry and a pinch of cayenne.

This  was super easy to make! It was smooth and flavourful!  I didn't have any marjoram so I used thyme instead and I substituted cayenne pepper for chili flakes.  It made it a bit spicy, but we still enjoyed it.  Next time I will stick to using cayenne pepper. I will definitely make it again though.

Can be dairy free, and easily vegetarian this is a great soup for anyone. I like to add walnuts and/or a spicy sausage. You can also add cream if you desire the more traditional butternut squash soup. Cutting up the squash is worth it!!

Easy and healthy.  I used only the squash, no potato or carrot.  Sautéed a couple cloves garlic with the onion and celery.  Baked the squash and added with the broth.  Added a pinch of curry powder and a tiny pinch of nutmeg.  Pureed with stick blender.  Perfect!

This is the best butternut squash soup I've made! I doubled the recipe, and followed it exactly.  Then I added a big sweet potato, 3/4 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 tsp sweet curry powder, and 1/2 tsp. chipotle ground red pepper.  I pureed it with my immersion blender.  I plan to serve it with hot beef sausage (smoked sausage with jalapeno and red peppers) on the side because my husband won't eat the soup if I add the sausage to it.  

I tried it with a bit of shredded parm on it, and it tasted fine, but I don't think the parm added anything to the flavor.

Per husband-- "Tasty!"  Toddler liked it, too.  Very easy.  I started the broth in the soup pot and just added the veggies as I cut them, so it only had to boil about 10 minutes before it was ready to puree.  Saved lots of time and still tasted great!

This was delicious, simple and really lets the taste of butternut squash shine through! I did not add celery or carrots, and only had red potatoes. I added one garlic clove.  I mashed the soup roughly in the pot when done, added a splash of half and half to each bowl as desired. A nice alternative to the cinnamon/ginger/curry types of squash soups. (ps - I microwaved the squash for 5 minutes, then peeled and cubed)

I made this tight for a cold and rainy Hawaii night. I usually don't get to make soups too much because if the weather but I was at Costco and came across a package of pre-cut and diced butternut squash. I followed the recipe almost exactly except I added 2 carrots and 2 cloves of garlic to the sautéed mix. It was super easy and the hubby and 3 year old loved it even without sour cream!

I have made this recipe before and really liked it, but, I knew the celery was too much...I did not omit it, just used a couple of sticks, plus 1 tbsp. extra of real butter, and a 1/2 c. of sour cream.  Still lowfat, taste great, and good for you !!  It's a "win win" !

Delicious and with no cream! I only used one potato and had no carrots on hand, otherwise used all the other ingredients listed. Also added a couple garlic cloves, cinnamon, curry, and nutmeg, as other reviewers suggested. I used a hand mixer in the pot to blend once simmered. Less to wash up afterwards! Dollop of sour cream was yum.

I used a food processer to chop everything and added garlic and some brocolli.  I really liked the soup but I did not blend it in the end because the processer made everything small enough to leave all the vegies as is.  Did not use celery either.  Not a vegie eater and this soup was wonderful.

It was a little bland, I added some of the recommended cinnamon and nutmeg, but the recommended bacon bits are what REALLY made the soup enjoyable. It was sort of lifeless without the meat chunks.

It was a hernia effort to make, but I was proud of it in the end.

This soup was good. I took the advise to add garlic and curry. I fried the veggies and then pressure cooked them for about 10-15 mins. to save time. Worked great.

Made this after Thanksgiving and subbed in Turkey Broth and 1/2 can of cream of chicken, along with a few extra left over veggies. That was the third time I made it (with this recipe) and it was the best I've done yet!

This will make the rotation. Used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth. Substituted sweet potato for the Yukon, and added in garlic, ginger (crushed kind in a jar) and fresh dill and no salt added.   It tastes so rich, but it is super healthy!

Made as described in the recipe it was wonderful.  I had never worked with a butternut squash before and found the instructions about cooking it prior to trying to peel it to be very useful.  Worked like a charm.  I'll be making this again.

I play with the root veg.  sometimes add carrot, sometimes potato all depends on what is on hand.  honestly they are just fillers anyway - love it and so does the family!  Thank you for providing a low fat, healthy version!

Awesome Recipe! I followed it pretty much to the letter except i did roast the squash first. I also added a little bit of nutmeg and a dash of curry powder. So good!

Absolutely delicious! I have made it quite a few times now, especially at this time of the year. I add a teaspoon of curry, bake the squash beforehand, and usually forgo the celery. Always a hit!

We have done this recipe several times.  This last round I put in a sweet potato and parsnip, as well as part of a green apple (which I had seen listed in other recipes) and it is DELICIOUS!

I made this exactly as written with the exception of cooking the squash in the microwave due to time constraints.  I thought it was excellent!

I made this soup exactly as instructed.  My daughter was wanting me to make butternut squash soup.  The smell in the house was amazing when it was cooking.  The flavours are to die for.  Thanks for sharing.

This is very good! however, I did not add the butter.

This also worked for me by adding some pumpkin puree and a little milk.

I LOVED this recipe and just added  a few tweaks to combine 2 recipes that sounded good.  First, I roasted the squash the night before (mainly because the oven was on already)...this made peeling and curbing the squash easier and also cut down my simmering time in half.  I also added 4oz of cream cheese to make it creamier.  Lastly, I topped the soup with roasted squash seeds I had saved from the squash itself!

Excellent with the addition of 2 cloves of garlic and some cayenne to taste! Cooked the squash in the micro while chopping the veggies to simmer in the stock to save some time.

I made this soup using the pre-cut fresh cubes from Costco - super easy and fast!  Used just a little coconut milk and nutmeg.  Was SO GOOD!

first time making squash soup and thought it was fantastic; Only difference I made was using sea salt instead of table salt and added a large pinch of nutmeg at the end. Healthy, rich and filling!

I have made this recipe numerous times.  The last time I made it, I actually threw the whole butternut squash on the BBQ the night before and pre cooked it, stuck in the fridge overnight.  It was super easy to work with, the fleshy part just scooped right off the skin.  This batch of soup had a wonderful smokey flavor that really complimented the soup.  I also add a dash of cayanne pepper to give it a kick.

The reviews were spot on...I can't believe how easy and YUMMY the soup turned out!  I didn't have any celery but just added more carrots instead. I didn't place it in the mixer...just kept it more chunky instead. Besides those 2 changes, I followed the recipe and ingredients as is.   Definitely will make this soup again!

Magic soup!  The bowl was lifted up and drained by 10 year old picky eaters.  2 year olds had three bowls of it.  It nourished people just home from the hospital.  It is so easy to make and so tasty.  I just throw in any vegetables I have, including sweet potatoes and cauliflower as well as those listed.  I also use bouillon cubes, one vegetable, one chicken.  And it is very tasty, hardly needs any salt and pepper.

This soup is very easy to make and is so tasty. I used butternut squash from my garden. I added a little curry powder one garlic clove and a pinch of hot pepper flakes. I didn't have any potatoes so I added potato buds at the end to get the right consistency. Worked great!

Very tasty soup. Wanted to keep having bowl after bowl. No special herbs or spices too! So easy to make.  I made it with the chicken broth by O Organics, and didnt even need to add salt. My husband loved it too! Thank you Maplebird!

I actually just tried making this recipe and made it "as is" - but did add some cinnammon, nutmeg and a little garlic salt (very little) to spice it up a little more.  It came out thick and amazing !!  I will try to bake the squash next time, just to add a little more flavor.  Truly a yummy soup and so quick to make :)

(Note:  I used my Toastmaster hand blender to purée this soup - worked beautifully)

so easy and quick to make and so delicious. I served it to my thanksgiving guests and they all loved it. If someone wanted to spice it up they just added a little black pepper. For my mom and I with our sensitive stomachs it was soothing and so delicious! I will make it again and again :)

This is an excellent soup!! I took the advise of some other cooks and added sweet potato. I used a Thai curried chicken soup broth with coconut. It added an extra layer of flavour. I also added a splash of sweet vermouth. This is SO GOOD. It got rave reviews. I will be making this soup again, especially for guests. Thanks for a great recipe.

This is my favourite soup. It is great in the fall and I like making it even more now that my 1 year old son likes it as much as I do. I usually double the recipe, and add 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 a tsp all spice.

This was ok. Very flat so I had to doctor it with some dill, garlic and sour cream. My daughter cried and said it was "asgusting, gross soup". We love butternut squash but this is not a remake for our house.

This recipe is great!  I added a can of vegetable stock which gave it a little spice. I used my immersion blender (last year's Christmas present) for the first time and it made a very smooth soup.  Thank you.

This is definitely a new family favorite! I added 1 zuchinni and used beef stock to give it a more hearty flavor and my kids ate seconds and thirds!

Thanks for the great idea! I will definitely use this one over and over!

I made this recipe today.  I roasted the squash in the oven since butternuts are just a pain to cut up and decided to go ahead and roast the carrot, a sweet potato (for the orange color) and a clove of garlic before adding them to the broth. I didn't use all the broth as I wanted my soup to be on the thicker side. I decided to keep the celery in big chunks in the broth so I could extract the flavor but pull it out at the end. I tried the soup without the spices that had been suggested and I liked it just like that. Especially with the roasted vegetable flavor.  It would be very good just like that with a good parmesan crouton on top. But I went ahead and added the suggested seasonings as I am testing this recipe for a party I will be having this fall and wanted to see which version would be best with my menu.  I started with half the suggested amount of seasonings to start.  I don't like curry so I put 1/4 tsp. of cumin, 1/4 tsp of cinnamon and a dash a nutmeg. I also upped the chicken flavor by adding 1/2 tsp. of Chicken bouillon base to the soup.  That is all it needed for me. Just a slight hint of spice. I topped it with a dollop of sour cream and it was dreamy.  This is going in my recipe file.

this worked really well as a guideline but i didnt follow it exactly since i didnt have chicken stock, instead i had some squash i had baked on the side, i scooped the meat out of those and simmered it in water making a sort of squash stock if you will, i added the whole kit and kaboodle to the soup and proceeded to baby it for a while tasting and adjusting until i was happy with it, my kids gobbled it up with some warm  tortilla on the side for dipping.

Love this recipe & have made numerous times, usually adding cumin & sometimes a pinch of curry.  I like chopping up all the veggies, minus celery & wrapping in foil & baking in oven first, then putting all with juices in blender & adding it to the chicken stock till desired consistency is reached.  Haven't tried the sour cream, will do that tonight as have the veggies roasting in the oven as I write this - bonnieg

So yummy! I left out the carrot (didn't have any on hand). I added garlic salt, nutmeg, paprika, and Himalayan pink sea salt. I also topped it with kale 'chips'. It turned out delicious!

Delicious base recipe!  I added garlic, and used frozen pureed butternut squash to save time.  It was ready very quickly.  I will use this recipe again.

How easy! I cooked this in my rice cooker!!

This recipe was incredible! I love butternut squash soup, but this is my new favourite. I cut the squash, removed the seeds, rubbed it with olive oil, then roasted it in the oven first for more flavour and to make peeling it easier. I highly recommend this step!

My only complaint is that I found that the potato added a bit of graininess to the otherwise velvety texture of this soup. I'm thinking that it may be because I used russet potatoes? I'm thinking that I should have maybe used Yukon or new potatoes? I'll have to play with that a bit.

I finished the soup with a hand blender and a dollop of sour cream (low fat). The soup tastes great without it, but it is even better with it. I also tried it with a touch of cinnamon and curry and preferred the flavour with those spices, rather than without... but to each their own.

Try this soup! You won't be let down.

Awesome recipe!  Great winter soup.  I added a few of tsp of minced garlic during the sauteeing process and bay leaf during cooking time.  Makes for healthy, hearty and easy lunch/dinner prep for the week.

I made a few changes and  additions and this was a great soup.  I added half an apple, 1 poblano pepper and an extra carrot.  I also substituted 1 small sweet potato for the 2 other potatoes. I love simple recipes!  This soup accompanied a grilled cheese, red onion and tomato sandwich.

This is a great start. Because I am vegan, I had to change a few things. While cooking the veggies I added 1/2 tsp of nutmeg and salt and pepper. I also used low sodium veggie broth instead of chicken stock and vegan butter. Everything else I did the same. At the very end, I added 1 TBSP of curry powder, 1 TBSP of cinnamon, 1 TBSP of brown sugar, and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg. DELICIOUS!!!

I also found it bland so I added some heavy cream, garam masala, 2 bay leaves left to simmer, a dash of curry powder and a pinch of cayenne. I put about 75% of the soup into a food processor to leave some chunks.

Most excellent! I read the reviews and adapted this recipe to our taste
 as others did.  I added a pablano pepper and a dash of cayenne.  My family each had their favorite garnishes:  feta cheese, Parmesan, cream cheese or sour cream.  Outstanding!!!

Really easy and yummy! I cooked my onions in bacon drippings first, added only onion and two potatoes to my squash and chicken stock. Seasoned with clove of garlic, celery salt, fresh ground nutmeg, salt and pepper, curry powder. I blended only 2/3 of soup and added back into bite-sized pieces in rest of soup, then added some bits of chicken/spinach sausage. Delicious!

Very easy and tasty. I have a stick blender, so the mess was minimal since the blending can be done in the pot. The only thing I did differently was to use chicken broth instead of stock because that is what I had on hand. I will do this again for sure!

I really loved this recipe!  I followed it almost as written except that I added two carrots instead of one.  Next time I'll peel the potatoes first to avoid tiny potato skin flecks but the flavor was great! Served with sliced warm French bread. Yum!

My local grocer carries bags of chopped butternut squash in the freezer section.  I make sure to always have some on hand, and I can whip up this recipe in no time at all!  It's good as written, but I also have added garlic & curry powder, or poured in a little half & half at the end.  It's awesome with homemade bread!

This recipe is the bomb!  Very good and can be adapted so quickly.  I used veggie broth and all of the veggies mentions but sweet potato instead of white.  Instead of blending it I mashed with my potato masher and added cumin and some pumpkin pie spice and a can of coconut milk.  OH MY DELICIOUS DINING!  did not even add the butter LOL

This was AMAZING!  Definitely making this one again.  Used one potato instead of two.  Added a bit too much cayenne pepper, so then added cream cheese to cool it down.  It was a tad bit too spicy so adjusting that the next go around.  =)

ABSOLUTELY love this recipe! It has a mildly sweet taste, and is the silkiest from-scratch soup that I've ever made. I was struggling to get the peel off and found a tip online to slice the squash in half and remove the seeds, then microwave them for just a few minutes to soften the flesh. It's still a challenge to remove the skin but not as difficult. I make this in double batches now because it goes so quickly :-D

I love it but hubby thinks it looks like baby food and on the sweet side (which comes from the squash).

Followed the recipe, except added a little corn for texture, and I only had one potato. Turned out great. We'll see if the kids will eat it tonight.

I hate winter squash and I love this recipe!  I used veggie broth instead of chicken broth, celeriac instead of celery, added a sweet potato, and followed suggestions for garlic, chili pepper flakes, cinnamon and nutmeg, as well as a pinch of Five Spice Powder.  Cooked the squash whole first, and it was simple to put together.  Even if you hate squash, you'll like this, I promise!

Just made this soup today and even with no salt and pepper it is delicious.  Amazingly sweet for having no sugar in it.  I will be adding some salt an pepper to give it more dimension but the thickness and natural flavor are wonderful!

I just made a pot of this soup.  I add a little curry powder to it.  I have also made it with. Vegetable stock for a vegetarian version.  I use a hand held blender and blend it in the pot.

This is a really wonderful and simple recipe! We made it for my in-laws who are not used to eating vegetarian but it went over really well! We added dumplings and had a sweet salad to go along with it. Also used vegetable stock instead of chicken stock. It only took 1/2 the amount of stock, and then after blending we added a little water to thin it out a bit more for the dumplings to soak up.

This was soooooo gooooood....I felt like i had to add alot of salt but once I got the balance it was fantastic-the last of the squash from the summer garden...the only thing that I did different is that I used a nice Veggie Stock that I had made from my garden that had incredible flavor-was trying to keep it very veggie for my daughter-I will hold onto this recipe and make again, i am going to try and freeze it next time-none left to freeze this time...

Delicious!! the only thing I did different was using one potato instead of two. Other than that I followed the recipe to the T. I bought the already cut butternut squash from Wegmans which made things way easier. Love it and will make again! Thank you!

Made this for Thanksgiving and it was wonderful.  My modifications were: used only one potato, added a little cayenne for some kick, and mixed in sour cream at the end.  A nice and easy make ahead soup that everyone enjoyed!

This is a very healthy soup, but it lacks flavor if you make it as described.  A little bit of thyme and some cumin make it more appealing.  Also, since I like to have various textures, I pureed the soup then cooked chunks of yucca in the puree for another 30 minutes, let it cool to about 150 F and added diced red pepper and diced red onion.  The result is a colorful soup some crunch from the onion and pepper and a nice comfortable chewiness from the yucca.

Cook it this way and if you re-heat it the crunch will still be there.

My husband and I wanted to try a new vegetable and decided to give butternut squash a try.  The soup came out fantastic! It is now one of our go to dinner meal because it's so delicious yet so simple.  It is also great for people with allergies.  It is gluten free and vegan yet the consistency is still smooth and creamy.  Yumm!

Very easy! Very good - but bland! We added nutmeg, cinnamon, a little hot sauce (Tapatio) which we love but not everyone does, and more salt and pepper! (For the blood pressure peeps out there, we used salt substitute!) The fam decided that it needed more substance - suggestion was small bits of cauliflower.  Other suggestions are of course bits of broccoli, onion, saw the suggestion for chunks of squash (family put the kabash on that!). But worth the effort! Family members left today and then texted that they wish they would have taken some left over sopa with them! We do, too! T-Day leftovers are crowding the frig!

I roasted the squash and omitted the butter replacing with coconut oil to sauté onion, carrot, & celery.  I only used 1/2 potato.  Added 1 tsp curry and a granny smith apple .  Absolutely delish!  Had a friend in from out of town on a cold, rainy night.  Served with some warm, crusty farm bread!  Both my friend and husband loved it!  Me too!  A definite one to make again and again!

delicious!  i saw that others had taken out the celery and carrot, but i really think that the celery especially adds wonderful complexity to the flavor. i did leave out the potato, however. instead of canned broth, i actually substituted the left-over gravy from a orange-honey-white wine chicken recipe that i'd made last week and added in some ground ginger - the soup is to die for!

This was wonderful.  I took advice from other reviewers, using just one potato and adding curry powder, cinnamon and garlic.  It turned out delicious and my kids love it as well.  Next time I plan to add parmesan cheese and dollop of sour cream.

I've made this before and liked it fine but decided it needed more. So this time I accidentally used 4 Tbsp butter and added 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper, some coriander - maybe 1/2 tsp, 1/4 tsp pepper, a couple of small pinches of red pepper flakes, 2 cloves of garlic - because I like garlic, 1 pear, and some milk maybe 1 to 1-1/2 cups until it wasn't too thick anymore. Perfect.

I had a sweet potato that I used instead of regular.  I covered with broth and put it in the oven at 225 rather than simmer on the stove (so I could walk on my treadmill without worrying about burning the bottom). Used the immersion blender and made it very smooth and added a touch of cinnamon and dash of a cholula hot sauce.

Excellent!!! I added 1/2 tsp. of ginger and 1/4 tsp. of curry powder and it just gives it that extra flavour with the combined vegetables.  The curry is so slight - no one knows it's there but me.  I've made this soup many many times and my family and my guest love it and always ask me for the recipe.  I like it because most recipes call for cream but this one is just fine as is - great for people with lactose intolerance problems! Thank you for sharing your recipe with us!!!!

This quickly became a family favorite! Everyone requests it as soon as the weather turns. Tons of flavor and easy to make! I don't feel any changes are necessary at all. It's convenient because you can cut the veggies into large chunks because they dissolve in the heat anyways.

We modified slightly. Omitted the celery. Used sweet potato instead of russets and added the curry powder as other reviewers had suggested plus a peeled granny smith apple. We topped with fresh roasted almonds plus  sour cream and OMG this soup is delicious!

Awesome soup - in 40 min. you can have such a depths of flavors. A winner, especially since we're still buried in garden squashes and try to come up with ways to utilize our bounty.

Simple.  Flavorful.  Healthful.  And, no cream?!  Great recipe!  I added a can of pears in light syrup at the very end (right before pureeing) to add a little sweetness and texture.  A terrific soup either way!

This is a great recipe! I baked the squash and sweet potato at 350 for an hour. In the kettle I cooked 5 slices of bacon. I removed the bacon and browned a shallot, 2 chopped garlic cloves and a 1inch piece of chopped ginger. I added the chicken broth along with the chopped carrot and celery. After the squash and sweet potato cooled, I added them to the kettle with salt,pepper, nutmeg,cumin and red pepper. I allowed everything to simmer about 20 minutes. I used an immersion blender and added about 1/4 c half and half for added creaminess.  I crumbled the bacon back into the soup and also used the dollop of sour cream recommended by others. In truth, this is so good, I think I would have been fine making the recipe as written. I enjoyed playing with it a bit, using the suggestions of others. I will definitely make it again.

I was looking for a butternut squash soup recipe and came across this one.  After reading quite a few reviews, I made it with the following changes: Only used 1 potato, omitted the celery (since I didn't have any), plus added 1 tsp minced garlic, a few shakes of curry powder, and a similar amount of cinnamon.  I also roasted the squash in the oven (400 degrees for 50 minutes), then scooped/chopped it and added it to the other veggies when there was 10 minutes left in the cooking time.  I was wary of adding additional salt since chicken stock is typically salty, but the veggies stand up to a bit of salt and I ended up adding a little at the end.  The soup turned out pretty good - I'd definitely make it again with those changes!  I'm giving the recipe four stars because I think it needed the little extra seasoning.

This was wonderful… the flavor was just right. It is officially my favorite soup!! I would highly recommend it  to anyone as it is so easy to make. An added plus is butter nut squash is in season and extremely inexpensive. Thank you for posting Maplebird.

Tried this week. Cooked as is with the suggestions of adding cinnamon & nutmeg, using sweet potatoes and omitting the celery. Only thing I found is needed more salt for taste. I'm on weight watchers so this fits in as 8 pts per serving and was very filling dinner! I will make again as it's easy & delicious and a healthy substitute for the weekly dinners.

LOVE this recipe -- the addition of sweet potato is great -- do not leave out the celery, and add some nutmeg!!  Suggestions to bake/roast the butternut squash are spot on -- much easier than chunking the squash.  If you have an immersion blender -- this recipe is made for its use!  I made it for our dinner group, and it was a hit -- a delicious hit!

I love this recipe - I read the reviews and took some others suggestions by adding more ingredients - I added: curry powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves.  I often use curry in my dishes and when I do I always like to put in a chutney type taste - which I use apricot jam - I also added a dollop of sour cream - and some coriander - I didnt add celery or the tatties - and let me tell you its delish we couldn't stop eating it - so thanx for the recipe its easy to make and very yummy - cutting the butternut now is another story LOL

This recipe is single-handedly responsible for making me love butternut squash.  Like the other reviewers suggest, I bake the squash for an hour at 375.  I omit the potatoes and celery, add a couple tsp of garlic and a pinch of curry powder, and it's AWESOME!  I don't think it's bland at all.  Just make sure you use a whole onion and I use that "Better Than Bouillon" stuff.  Great fall recipe and such a pretty color!

So yum. I scaled all ingredients down, except butter. Oops. But was still so tasty. I only had minced onion and carrots, did not use celery. Blended tarragon, and topped with croutons.

I've made this soup for almost 5 years now, and just realized that I've never given it the kudos it deserves.  Incredibly healthy and unbelieveably delicious.  Other than adding some sweet potatoe if at hand I don't change a thing.  YUM YUM YUM!!!

I love this. I made it the other day and I'm planning on making more tonight and canning it. I made a couple of changes. I used 2 small onions, 2 carrots, 4 small baby red potatoes, and 2 stalks of celery. When it was all done, I added some seasoning salt, a generous amount of ground black pepper, and a generous amount of ground red pepper. It's sweet and it has a little bite to it. Love it!

Perfect day for a perfect soup. It is a rainy fall sunday and this soup is a big warm hit for the Jamison family. I love that the prep time is fast and the cooking time is quick but what I love most is that I have found a receipe that I totally love and do not have to make any changes to. My hats off to its creator.

Absolutely loved this.  The only thing that I changed was adding another carrot because we love carrots.  Also I didn't blend it at all, I just left it chunky.  Instead of sour cream I put a little shreaded cheddar and monterey jack cheese on top.  It was really good with out the cheese, however everything tastes better with cheese.  Will make this recipe again for sure!!

Made this last night and it was great with a few modifications. This recipe provides an excellent base. The added ingredients sent this over the top to great!  I added couple of dashes of nutmeg, cayenne, garlic powder, curry powder (you could add more or less depending on taste).  Then I added 1 TBSP spiced rum and a 1/4 cup of apple juice. I cooked everything in a stock pot, simmered like the method indicates and then pureed it all with a hand blender.  Delicious and definitely makes more than 4 servings, granted I did use a large butternut squash

I enjoyed this recipe and used it more as guidelines. I baked the squash and boiled the veggies in  unsalted vegetable stock. I added a quarter of a red pepper along with the other veggies listed. I omitted the salt. At the end I added a teaspoon or two of half-n-half.

GREAT recipe! I've never made squash soup before but I had some left over that I didn't want to go bad. I came on to find a base recipe that I could freeze and customize one portion at a time.  I thought this recipe was great as is because it is creamy, it highlights the vegetables and tastes wonderful on its own. I can see adding sour cream, maybe some nutmeg and ginger, extra black pepper...but I really like it as it is. I used what I had on hand, so I used 1 potato and added a bit more carrot to compensate (I also added the leaves of the celery stalk because of their nutritional value). I did not sautee the vegetables first, so I skipped the butter and I don't think I lost anything. I LOVE this. Can't wait to dig in and enjoy it all winter long--and then make more so I can enjoy it all next summer. Maybe even try it cold...I'm seeing los of possibilities with this.

This soup is fantastic - a hearty, healthy treat on a cold fall or winter day.  I usually add red bell pepper, minced ginger, and garlic in with the vegetables.  I like mine chunky, so instead of transferring to a blender (which is just more work and messy) I just use a potato masher and mash the soup in the pot.  I also add a little cooking sherry and let it simmer and reduce a little.  Family LOVES it!  Delicious.

I have been following this recipe for years.  It is dellicious.  It works no matter how many veggies you use.  Just make sure that the broth covers the veggies in the pot.  Also, after I puree I keep the stock separate from the puree so you can make the soup as thick or as thin as you want when reheating

Excellent! It being Octoer, I've swiped 2 sugar pumkins off my porch now and used those. I recommend spicing it up a bit with some cumin, tiny bit of cayenne, and plenty of parsley. Also, it is super easy to throw in the crockpot. Another good trick is the Cuisinart Smartstick Handblender, which I just purchased for the occasion! Happy Cooking!

liked the basic recipe. Added some broccoli and seasoned with chicken bouillon, salt and pepper to taste and thought it was great. Sour cream, as other suggested did not really add a whole lot but did not make it awful either. will make again! thanks

Excellent! I, too, altered the recipe. Used just one small potato, and about half the amount of chicken stock--just enough to cover the simmering veggies. I also added fresh, ground nutmeg, and then added some heavy cream while blending to reach the desired consistency. Yummy!

Very disappointed with this recipe. I added cinnamon and bought expensive stock because someone suggested it. This is like baby food and ver bland

5 Stars from me......this is an excellent soup! I did add a little bit of curry powder and just one potato.  BTW, if you have never cut up a butternut squash I suggest watching the video for this recipe it was very helpful.

Love it, love it, love it, healthy and to get more protein I brown a pound of ground turkey with the onion, drain and then add the other veggies.  Wonderful for cold days or just anytime.

I was initially very leery of this recipe - all the ingredients cooked together then being puréed. I like texture in my food. So, i took the advice of one reviewer and only pureed half. Surprisingly, it was delicious! Not only my first time making butternut squash soup, but first time making the butternut itself. I also added curry, garlic and nutmeg.

I think this soup is great just the way it is, especially if you have a sweet butternut squash.  No added dairy products is a plus.

Loved this recipe. I watched a youtube video on how to peel a butternut squash which helped.  I left out the potatoes; trying to watch my carbs and added an extra carrot.  Very simple and flavorful.

I had 1/4 of a butternut squash left, wondered what to do with it, browsed around for ideas & used this recipe due to its simplicity & the positive reviews. I altered quantities as I just made it for myself and didn't use celery because I didn't have it.
I dissolved 2 chicken stock cubes in water, softened 1/2 an onion and 2 cloves of garlic in some butter, added stock, then added leftover butternut squash & 2 small potatoes roughly chopped. When they were fork tender, I took half and pureed in a food processor & left the rest (as suggested by another reviewer) for some chunky texture. I added a dash of milk & also black pepper. There was enough salt in the stock cube, so had I added any extra, I wouldn't have been able to eat it! It was very tasty! This is the first soup i've made and it was so easy! So easy to remember that I didn't have to look at this recipe once while cooking either! I had half today & felt full, so will have the rest tomorrow! I live in Toronto & i sent a picture of the soup to my mum in England! She said it looks good and healthy! I'll definitely be making more soups and it was a lot tastier than the bought ones!

So tasty, so easy. I baked the squash, whole in the oven at 375 for 1 hour. Cut some slits with a sharp knife to let it vent. Added a pinch of nutmeg, a pinch of cayenne and 2 tsp. of Nature's Seasoning. I couldn't stop eating it!

Great recipe! I have made it twice now. The first time it took so long to cut the butternut squash. Second time I roasted for 1 hour in the oven and the skin peeled right off. I add sage and a tiny bit of half and half cream to it.

This soup has a fantastic flavor but I personaly don't care for the consistancy with the potato in there. I think I will try the same recipe without the sweet potatoes next time. I cooked the squash in the oven as others have suggested and it made the prep so much easier! Yummy =)

I love this recipe. I also used sweet potatoes because they were all I had. This recipe seems like it would be good with a little cream or evaporated milk added next time.

Delicious winter soup and baby food in one! Instead of butter I chopped and crisped up some bacon. Remove the bacon and cook the veggies in the bacon fat and then do as the rest of the recipe says. I added 1/2 cup of half n half, 1/2 of sour cream and 1 cup of cheddar after it was pureed. Crumble the cooked bacon on top to serve. Cook up some fresh biscuits and yum! Great way to use up the leftover produce from the summer garden too. For the peanut I added about a teaspoon of mixed grain cereal just to thicken it up and my little one loved it! I rate it a 4 star because it's a great base and you can do a lot to adjust the flavors for your family!

This will be one of my FAVorite soups!  It was super easy to make, though it took me longer than 15 minutes of prep to peel and cube the veggies.  
It did not take 40 minutes for the veggies to soften, however. 
I did add lots based on the other reviews.  I added a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg as well as a T of garlic, salt and pepper as well as a 5 pepper grillmate seasoning I had on hand.  I added about 1/2 cup of half and half, a large dollup of sour cream and about 1/2 cup of the captain morgans.  It was super yummer and really hardy. 
Oh and I left out the carrot but added to very small sweet potatoes. 
I like texture, so I pureed just half of the soup and mashed up the other chunks a bit. 

It was perfect and could easily be a meal by itself.

Wonderful! Smooth and creamy and fabulous taste and texture. My husband who doesn't like vegetables very much loved it! I forgot the celery but was still great. I also followed the suggestion of roasting the squash. I did that the night before, so it was cool to handle. The soup came together in a snap! It's beautiful, too!

I make this soup ALL the time in the fall. I think it's an excellent recipe. I highly recommend this soup. However, I usually swap out the regular potatoe for sweet potatoes because I like them better and I like the havest taste. Also, when I make it for a dinner party/thanksgiving I make homemade pumpernickel croutons ...it's a nice touch and really easy! You won't be disappointed with this recipe!

Great recipe! I added garlic. I love garlic so I added 3 or 4 cloves but this can be adjusted to taste. I blended the veggies with a cup of freshly made cashew milk. We loved it! (-:

Standard squash soup recipe, although I most certainly would only use one potato. This is a good dish to have under the belt because if you can decently match flavors you can make subtle changes based on what you have in the kitchen. This time I didnt have any celery on hand but did season at the end with celery salt. I followed the recipe with a few additions: add 1/4 cup heavy cream or sourcream, add honey to taste, and at the end added fresh basil, ground pepper and celery salt. I like to let the squash shine whatever the variety.

Love this!  I too added a few spices...1/8 tsp chipotle,  1/4 tsp Spanish smoked paprika,  1/8 tsp nutmeg, 1/8 tsp cinnamon and 2 cloves crushed garlic. I cooked everything together in pan until time to blend. Cooking the spices with veggies brought out sooo much flavor!  Plus it freezes beautifully!

I made this soup for my family as is - followed the recipe exactly (minus some of the butter and the salt).  My family loved it!  Even those who usually hate eating vegetables gobbled it up.  They requested I make it again once the first batch was gone so they could take it for work lunches.  Great recipe and really healthy - also very filling and can be used as a main meal.  Easy to freeze too.

Great recipe!  Only changed a couple of things.  I doubled the carrots and celery, cooked the squash beforehand, and added some curry.  I might try switching out the butternut squash for pumpkin.  No need for cream!

I made this with olive oil instead of butter and added a pinch of curry powder and a grating of fresh ginger.  I didn't blend it, just mashed so there were some small chunks, but it was amazing and my husband loved it!  He had his with sour cream swirled on top, I had mine with a sprinkling of parsley.   Served it with spinach salad and double cornbread. Thank you for a fab dinner!!!

Blenders really help.  I'm a college student without a blender so I had to puree the soup by hand and it was not fun to say the least but it was worth this soup!  I doubled the recipe and left out the carrots and celery but added sour cream and a dash of cayenne pepper and this was perfect!

I make this EXACTLY AS WRITTEN (gasp!) and it is delicious, easy, inexpensive, and healthy! My meatatarian husband and two preschoolers love it. I gave it four stars because my husband likes it better with extras--we kind of treat it like potato soup and add a little sour cream, shredded cheese, and bacon before serving as others have suggested.

Great soup.  I added a bit of curry powder and left out the butter.  I didnt brown the vegetables, but instead roasted the squash in the oven beforehand and just scooped it out, and into the broth base.  Will definitely make this again.

Yummy! Some people mentioned that the butternut squash can be baked in the oven. If you are looking for a faster way to bake it then you can do it in a pressure cooker. That usually takes about thirty minutes. We also substituted yogurt for the sour cream (the low fat version), added garlic, curry powder and fresh parsley, and then ate the soup in bread bowls. Yum!

This was delicious. I sauteed everything in a mix of butter and grapeseed oil. I added a few cloves of garlic, and some raw ginger too, and replaced the onion with green onion. After it was all pureed, I added some heavy cream, salt, pepper and parsley. It was great served with beer bread and sparkling cider. A real autumn treat!

This was excellent! I roasted my squash first to simplify things, added a green apple, and a touch of curry powder. As many others suggested, I added a dollop of sour cream when eating the soup which really kicked up the flavour. I didn't have any celery so it was omitted. Will be my go-to butternut squash soup recipe from now on!

This soup was amazing.  As another reviewer suggested, I baked my squash for one hour at 400 degrees.  I sauteed all the other veggies for ten minutes before I added the squash and broth.  I used an immersion blender and left the soup a little chunky.  I also had to add extra broth because my squash was a little large.  I will definitely make this again and again.

This is a great base recipe, but as written I did find it to be a bit bland.  I added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and 1/2 tsp. nutmeg and that really helped. I wanted to take the suggestion of topping the soup off with a dollop of sour cream, but I didn't have any so i tried substituting plain greek yogurt that I had laying around in the fridge.  That worked wonderfully as well.  Truly a fantastic soup for a cold fall afternoon.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, Maplebird!

This is AWESOME! Who knew it was SO easy to make restaurant quality soup at home!

My only complaint it that it takes so long to cook....but that's part of the drawback of any soup. :-(

I will DEFINITELY be making this again!

I love butternut squash soup! I tweaked this recipe a little. We didn't have any celery and other reviewer's had difficulty blending it, so I substituted a dash of celery salt. I did reduce to only one potato. I also ended up needing chicken broth to thin the soup some. And at the end the onion flavor was overpowering, so I did a spin off of the sour cream idea, by blending one package of cream cheese into the soup and heating it through. After this it was awesome!

This is delicious! It's rich and tastes creamy without actually having cream. I've used different amounts of ingredients (more squash, more or less veggies, etc.) and it always comes out tasting perfect.

YUM!  This soup is excellent!  I did read other reviews and made a few changes like baking the squash in the oven for an hour to soften.  I added garlic, a little turmeric, and curry powder otherwise I stuck with the recipe.  This yielded a very flavorful, very healthy soup that I will definitely be cooking again!  I wish I would have doubled the recipe and froze more, because this soup is even yummy after its been frozen and thawed :)

This is one of the best soups I have ever made or eaten!  SO great!  Just another great way to use Butternut Squash!  Also, love the tip/instruction on only adding a small amount of chicken broth to the veggies before blending.  That really helps cut down on the mess of transporting between blender and pot.  We also used sodium free broth and it still turned out great!

This is a great great recipe. This is the 2nd time I have made it and I am now wondering why I waited so long in between! I don't think I changed a thing on the recipe.

We made this recipe as is because we like to first test recipes that way. We did omit the celery because we have a couple of non-celery eaters but added celery salt for the flavor. I also baked the squash first for easy skin removal. We tried the soup once with sage and once curried and loved it both ways. This recipe is delicious with big crusty bread for dipping.

Did not use butter, used sweet potatoes, and added in a few sprinkles of ground curry after the ingredients were blended. Great for a cold day!

Loved it! Very subtle flavor, so added curry, ground cumin and cinnamon. Added just pinches, don't overspice. Skipped cayenne, don't like heat. Also added 2 cloves minced garlic. Turned out fantastic, served with grilled ciabatta bread, a very filling soup. Velvety. Thanks for my new fave soup!

This is by far the best, healthiest soup I've ever made/had.  The first time I made it, I used gold potatoes and less water.  It was thick and delicious!  Last night, I used russet potatoes and more water.  It was still just as delicious and a little soupier.  I used chicken bouillon paste to taste rather than premade stock because that's what I had in my cupboard.  I also added garlic powder to last night's batch.  A girl in the office sampled my lunch today and then asked for the recipe.  So good and so healthy!  I highly recommend this recipe.

Delicious!  Made as directed.  Boiled squash for 30 min to make it easier to peel.  Yum, whole family loves it.  Definitely a keeper.

I tried this soup early in the fall when I first started seeing butternut squash available because it was quick and easy. My family (including by 3yr old) loved it so much that I’m making it for a first course for Thanksgiving. I substitute nondairy Earth Balance for the butter because we cook for a dairy allergy. Tasty and filling.

The soup alone serves as a good base.  To spice it up I followed others advice: 1 yam instead of 2 potatoes, peel the celery, add curry powder, white pepper, and garlic to taste.  Amazing!!!  Already added to the Thanksgiving menu.

Wonderful soup. It had a really great flavour. I made one addition to the recipe. I added just a 1/4 tsp of cumin.    I matched it with the "Tangy Turkey & Swiss Sandwich" by Annie on this website for an easy dinner. They went together wonderfully.

This soup was wonderful!  I omitted the potatoes altogether, added extra celery and onion and carrots.  I gave it a dash of nutmeg and cumin.  It was so great!  Just before serving I added shaved parmesan and homemade croutons.  Will keep this in permanent fall rotation!  Thanks for the great soup!

Just made this for dinner tonight and it was really good.  My kids loved it, even my son who generally not touch vegetables.  I would agree with some of the reviews that it is a touch on the bland side for adult taste. I will make it again but may use one of the suggested methods to heat it up a bit-maybe cayenne pepper.  The trick recommended by Mama Peek to heat the squash in the microwave works excellently.  I will use that for another butternut squash casserole recipe that requires pre-baking.

This is delicious!  The second time I made it, I thinned it a bit with canned milk, and added curry powder to taste.  The curry was wonderful with the squash.

Just made this recipe (halved it) for lunch with only a few minor changes.  Added 2 large cloves garlic and probably more potato than called for.  It was delicious!  Thanks for sharing!

I love this recipe, although I use water instead of chicken stock, and Quorn fake "chicken tenders" because I'm vegetarian.

About 4.5 stars.  It's fantastic if you roast the vegetables. I subbed the potatoes w/ what I had--a sweet potato and a small delicata squash.  So, yes, I'm one of those rating something other than the recipe as written, but I'll try it the "right" way when I have potatoes in my pantry.  it's super healthy, tho, as opposed to other recipes that load up on cream cheese, etc. Thanks, Maplebird!

This was delicious!  I made this with no changes to the original recipe.  I love the fact that it truly is low fat.  The only fat is, of course, the small amount of butter.  Since I am trying to watch my fat intake, I ate it just like it was, but the rest of the family added a dollop of sour cream on top.  They raved about the soup. Definitely a keeper in this household!

I've made this soup twice already and am gonna make more this weekend.   So very yummy and has simple, on hand, ingredients.  I actually had a bag of "spaghetti sauce veggies" and used those (SUPER easy and fast). I also added the curry powder, cinnamon and nutmeg. The curry powder is a must and lots of pepper!   My next batch I ran out of the spice so I used cinnamon and maple syrup. Also very good.  I'm gonna keep this recipe close for those cold fall/winter  Canadian days.

This soup was fantastic. We are not squash lovers but had one left over from Thanksgiving dinner, thought why not try something different. It was a big hit with the family.  So thick and tasty, the best part is it was so simple to make with things most people have  readily available. I will be making this again.

This is a great recipe! Though I did make some additions... red pepper (cayenne), some cinnamon, and of course, a big dollop of sour cream! YUM! Perfect for a wet fall day.

Yummo!!! I made this without the potatoes, and I used a homemade broth from last winter. I also added some fresh, dried sage from mother -in-law's garden. My husband and I both enjoyed it for 3 days! Will definitely be adding this to our repertiore of fall flavors!

As written, which is the recipe I followed, it was too bland.  Maybe it could have been my low sodium stock, but I was far from impressed.  After adding curry, nutmeg, ginger and some sour cream, the flavors were enhanced and so yummy.  So as written, did not care for, with additional spices, very good.

Made as is, this is a 3, maybe 4 stars. But after blending in 10 or so  fresh basil leaves, some heavy cream and/sour cream, this becomes a definite 5 stars.

Perfect as written! I have also made this without celery, since I don't always have it on hand, and the soup still turns out fantastic. I have tried making various kinds of soup for my family, and this is their favourite!

This was THE best butternut squash soup I have EVER had.  It was the first time I have ever made butternut squash so I of course looked for a recipe with the best ratings!  What I did differently from the actual recipe:  Did not use celery or potato. Added plenty of salt, a little cinnamon, nutmeg and chayenne pepper.  After I blended it I added about a 1/4 c. of 1% milk (that's all we drink).  I would try it without butter next time just to reduce the calories. Cutting and peeling the squash was not a big deal.  Have not tried roasting squash but probably wouldn't after cutting it up in a few minutes.  Not a big deal as some have mentioned.

This soup is amazing! To save time, I buy the squash all cut and cubed. Taking the suggestions from other reviews, I used a sweet potato, omitted the celery, added come curry powder and right before serving stirred in some sour cream. My daughter is a vegetarian, so I haven't tried the recipe with chicken broth~used organic vegetable broth and it's still fabulous. We can't get enough of this soup!

This soup is a staple in our home in the fall and winter!  It's healthy and so good.  It does take some time to prep the vegetables, but it's well worth the effort.  I usually add a little extra butter and potatoes to make it a little thicker/creamier.  Super recipe.

This was  a very tasty recipe overall.  I found that my potatoes were a bit starchy - next time I will rinse the potatoes before adding them to the mix.  I also added fresh dill to taste.  Yummy!

I thought this soup was great.  It was so velvety and rich.  I had bought a pre-cut package of butternut squash that also had yams and turnips.  I also added a 1/4 t of dried ground thyme.  My house smelled like I was roasting a chicken while it cooked!  This was a perfect soup for a cold winter night, and I will be making it again.

i also admitted the celery (too stringy for a blender, in my opinion) and added about a teaspoon of curry. this was absolutely wonderful soup; i doubled the recipe for my family of 7 and there wasn't any left. even my 7-year-old loved it. to simplify, i used precubed butternut squash from costco. thanks for the great recipe!

It's a good base recipe but super, super bland as written. I added nutmeg and red pepper flakes. We didn't have any sour cream but put a dollop of Greek yogurt on top. With all of those changes it was way better!

This soup is fabulous and easy to make.  I added a little bit of low-fat milk in the last ten minutes of cooking time (maybe a half a cup) and a little cumin.  I served it with croutons on top at Thanksgiving and it was a big hit all around.  Everyone wanted the recipe before they went home :)

I thought this soup was really good, I added a little cinnamon, nutmeg, and honey and it made it a little sweet.

This was fantastic.  Didnt have celery so I used 2 carrots.  Try this even if you dont think you like any squash.

This is a thick hearty delicious soup with all the taste and not as much fat as some other recipes. Also the prep time is short and sweet and the final product was a hit with the whole family including my husband who doesn't even like squash!!

Followed the recipe minus 1 patato. Very silky, beautiful texture. Yes, I have to agree that it lacks spices but you can always add to suit your tastes. Will make this again.

I didn't think I would enjoy this, but I did!  I used a sweet potato instead, and this worked great.  My 9 month old loved this too, perfect him too!

I forgot the potatoes but otherwise followed the recipe.  It was a nice squash soup but I have better results just baking the squash and blending it with stock or left over braising liquid.  Won't bother doing it again.

Oh this soup is so good!  Even if you forget the onion like I did! :)  I put in a bit of onion powder at the end and that worked fine.  I used a sweet potato instead of regular, and also added a bit of brown sugar because I like it a little sweet, but even without it it was still absolutely delicious!  I don't understand how a couple people said it was tasteless!

My boyfriend thought this would not be good because of the sound and look of it. Once made he loved it. I added a littel heavy whipping cream and skipped the celery. Also pureed it in the pot didnt want the mess. It was great will make it again. The pot was empty

I thought this was a very nice soup.  I thought the chicken flavor was a little too strong, so next time I will try it with vegetable broth instead.  I also added a dash of cayenne pepper which gave it a nice warmth.

This recipe offered a great start, but I also made some modifications to give it more flavor. First off I had to use celeriac since I didn't have celery...it was my first time using this root (got it from our farm co-op) and I think it worked really add to add flavor and consistency and it blended very nicely. I also put in some carrots and a couple of cloves of garlic. For spices I added a half a spoon of cumin seeds, a couple of teaspoons of curry powder, paprika, and a splash of caribbean hot sauce. Once blended, I added half and half and a little brown sugar. It turned out absolutely delicious and I will probably serve this again during the holidays.

Super aweseome recipe! I used the suggestions about baking the squash for an hour first, which really made it easy to prepare. And it really wasn't much work at all. I blended it completely, and it was delicious! Everyone loved it.

The onion and carrot were a little overpowering.  I skipped the celery because I didn't have any.  I think next time, I'd cut back on the carrot, and I would sautee the onion to start - and probably less of that as well.  The consistency was good.

I was so suprised how easy this soup was to make.  I took others recommendations and baked the squash... so much easier!!  I think next time I will make it in the morning, b/c trying to puree HOT soup in my blender... well, I wore some of it!  I only gave 4 stars b/c my kids loved it, but I felt it needed "something". I have no idea what.

Delicious!!! I did add 1 tsp minced garlic, and only used one potato, and it was awesome! Way better than I expected. I also added enough black pepper to give it a little kick. It was a hit. My husband, 1 yr old baby, and 2 and 4 yr nephews ate it up!  I will definitely be making this again. Great Recipe.

Great receipe! I love this! I didn't have carrots, so I omitted that, and I used fat-free chicken broth instead of regular chicken broth. Also, I only used an 8 oz. can of chicken broth, and the soup still tasted great and wasn't too thick. I used a sweet onion too for a bit more flavour, and also added two cloves of chopped garlic. This tastes great with a small tablespoon of sour cream on top!

This is a great recipe that also lends itself well to adjustments if you feel up to making them.  I made the soup per these directions, but added ground cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger after pureeing.  I also stirred in about a half cup of light cream.  I served it to my family at our weekly Sunday dinner and everybody raved!  Thanks!

this was so delicious and low fat! All the other recipes call for cream, or cream cheese etc.   My soup was a bit liquidy, so I added some flour. I also used a hand mixer instead of a blender.

I've always wanted to try butternut. I thought it would taste something like acorn, but is completely different. This seems to be a very versitable recipe. I added crushed garlic and italian spice blend, gave it a little snap with fresh ground pepper. I loved it but I think next time I will use a smaller potato.

I've been looking for a good dairy-free squash soup.  I roasted the Butternut Squash in the oven the night before and just added the cooked squash to the soup. I found my soup to be thick, so I added 8 oz of chicken stock to the 32 oz Vegetable stock I used.  I would just add 1 potato next time. Also added a Macintosh apple & Pumpkin Pie Spice.  Would consider adding fresh Ginger next time.  Used Immersion blender to puree at the end.   Thanks for a great recipe!

This soup is delicious, with a more complex flavour than many other squash soups because of the variety of vegetables used. It is also great for those of us watching our weight because there is no cream or cream cheese added. Thanks for a great recipe!

I pretty much followed the recipe on this, I used sweet potatoes instead of white potatoes, just because I prefer them, and I added some fresh garlic.  I had some leftover pumpkin pie filling from another recipe, so I threw that in at the end, along with maybe a teaspoon of vanilla extract, and a teaspoon of black pepper, and it was EXCELLENT! My family had it with grilled cheese sandwiches and a dollop of sour cream and everyone loved it.  The immersion blender worked really well, too, seems much easier than the blender route. I only didn't give it five stars because I'm reserving that honor for something spectacularly chocolatey or difficult and complicated to make, and this was a really good simple base, and something that can be customized as much or as little as you like.

I am currently eating a bowl of this soup and it is amazing! I will admit, I did add a medium diced apple in the saute process to boost the squash's sweetness, and I took a reviewers advice on adding a pinch of curry powder. I garnished my bowl with a dollop of sour cream as a contrast and yummm! Thank you so much for this recipe, I will deffinitely make it over and over again!

Great start on the soup. I made it according to recipe but will modify next time.  Two potatoes is too much. Overwhelming.  It was somewhat bland (and starchy from the potato) so after tasting, I added cayenne pepper and sour cream.  Tasted pretty good then.

A versatile recipe which you can customize easily.  A touch of curry powder adds richness to the flavour.  Use beef broth instead of chicken broth for an entirely different flavour that generally appeals more to the squash haters.

This soup is so easy and is so delicious.  It is a great comfort food for a cold day.  The only thing I would do different is make a double batch because it was gone to quickly.

This soup is excellent as is. I've done it many time. It's definitely easier and quicker to prepare if the squash is cooked before (cut in half length wise placed cut side down in a plate with water in the microwave for about 10 min or whole punctured with holes for 60 min in the oven at 400 degrees). Now I add about half a tsp of cumin to my soup. And a dollop of sour cream in each bowl just before serving. Simply delicious!

This is just a fantastic recipe. If you're a vegetarian, just substitute vegetable stock for the chicken stock and it's still fantastic. For some kick, add a teaspoon of chipotle powder to make it perfect for those cold days. During the holidays I also add 1-2 teaspoons (depending on my mood) of cinnamon which is a perfect complement to the squash. Fantastic!

Wonderful soup!  I substituted soy butter and vegetable broth to make it vegan.  I also omitted the potatoes because I didn't have any and added 2 cloves of garlic.  It turned out very creamy and much sweeter than I would have thought.  I added about a teaspoon of pepper to spice it up again.  My husband loves it too.  Will definitely make it again.  Thanks!

This was a good way to use butternut squash but we found it a little bland.  Perhaps a bit of cream or butter but then it wouldn't be low fat.  Overall though, pretty good.

My children, all under the age of seven, love this soup! I gave it four stars because I agree with some of the other comments. This soup makes a great base and a healthy dinner for little ones, but a little spice and a dollop of sour cream on top turn it into a wonderfully sophisticated soup to serve over and over again.

I make a similar soup based on a recipe for curried zucchini soup from Everyday Food, so here I just replaced the zucchini and inserted the butternut squash.  The ingredients are pretty much the same as this recipe, but I don't add carrots or celery.  I start out by heating olive oil (about 2-3 TBSP?) over medium heat and adding one medium chopped onion, plus 4 or 5 cloves of garlic (minced).  After the veggies are soft, add maybe a tsp. of curry powder (don't go overboard), stirring constantly for up to 1 minute.  Then add 32 oz. of chicken broth, plus the cut up and peeled butternut squash and potatoes.  I use russet potatoes (yukon golds take too long to soften), maybe 3 medium russets.  Boil, then turn down heat, simmer for 15 or so minutes until squash and potatoes are tender.  Pour into blender, and puree.  If you like some texture to your soup, you could probably just puree half of the soup.  I haven't done that, but I might next time, depending on how small I cut up the chunks of squash and potatoes.  And finally, add salt and pepper to taste, and if you like a little kick, add some cayenne.  Some yummy sourdough bread goes great with the soup, or toasted almond slices sprinkled on top.

This soup was delicious! I've never made a soup from any variety of squash and was a little hesitant but after we got a ton of squash from my dad this weekend we had to do something with them! My husband had two bowls just as a "snack" last night. This was a hit and will be made again. The only tiny change I made was some added cinnamon at the very end. Not a lot, just a pinch.

This was excellent with a few additions.  Like others I added a bit of nutmeg, cinnamon and curry.  I also baked the squash before adding it to the other vegetables when cooking.  Right at the end I added about 1/2 cup of sour cream.  Everyone went back for seconds!

A hit although my guests (my parents) couldn't believe it wasn't a cream soup.  Easy make but I agree with some of the other reviewers...roast the squash for easy peeling and add some seasoning.  I added ginger, nutmeg and a touch of cayanne.  It went over very well and will definitely make again since it's so wonderfully healthy for you!

I am not a vegetable person but as I try to eat healthier at work this was a recipe I forced myself to try. It was terrific. I did not add any salt and very little pepper. It was a great hit at work and a few have even asked me for the recipe.

This is a very easy soup to make.  It is a good way to use your extra butternut squash.  I will probably make this again.  As far as my taste, I thought it was good, but not great.  For me the sour cream is a must.

Delicious and healthy soup! Like some of the other reviews, I didn't use the celery. I have made it several times and have tried using sweet potatoes and regular potatoes. Both are delightful. I also add 1/2 teaspoon of marjoram and 1/8 teaspoon of cayenne pepper for some extra kick! It's one of my favorite recipes! Thank you for sharing!

THIS SOUP IS WONDERFUL AND QUITE SIMPLE TO MAKE.  I TOOK THE ADVISE OF OTHERS AND DID NOT ADD CELERY; BUT DID ADD A DLOP OF SOUR CREAM AT THE VERY END. I ALSO BAKED THE SQUASH AS ADVISED. DELICIOUS!

Yummy soup-I felt healthy eating it.  And it was pretty easy to make.  I wish I would've read the reviews and cooked the squash separately, but I just used a vegi peeler and it went pretty quick.  I followed the recipe except that I had used up my celery with other recipes, so that it lacked.  I think next time I will add a couple other spices, yet it definately had a full vegi flavor as is.

Excellent recipe.  The only changes I made was to roast the squash and then sautee with the other veggies using canola oil spray.  I also added a garlic clove and a little nutmeg and chili spice.  Delish!!

an extra carrot and a couple cloves of minced garlic don't hurt it, either.  I substituted 2 dissolved cubes of bullion (in 32 oz water) for the chicken stock - it's cheaper!

This soup was delicious and a beautiful orange color.  It was much better than some I bought at a well-known small grocery chain with a tropical name.  I shall make it often.

this was a great soup - I did have a couple of additions.  A few sage leaves, a half a peeled apple, and a splash of fat-free half and half added to the delicious-ness.

Yum, yum yum!  Easy and delicious.  I followed other reviewers recommendations and roasted the squash rather than peeling and dicing first.  Much easier this way.

I found no need to put the butternut squash in the oven. Instead, I used one of those julienne peelers from Pampered Chef, and then seeded and chopped it. It worked just fine; saved time and a pan! I added more celery and carrot (used 2 stalks of celery and 2 medium carrots). I also added some minced garlic, cilantro and chili powder to spice it up a bit. I think it could have used some chives, maybe we will try that next time!

This was good, but not great.  Could be four stars with maybe a bit of seasoning.

I did use the "bake the squash whole" technique and that worked great.  I also used an immersion/stick blender to blend it, it was very fast.

Overall, a tasty soup, just not spectacular.  Very healthy and easy though.

This soup was really great. But as the others have said,i would leave the celery out, but the onion and green peppers frozen or fresh put a really yummy taste to the soup. I also added a half cup of milk for creaminess. It was really delicious served with freshly baked crescent rolls.

Great recipe! This was my first time eating or cooking with squash and it was excellent. I think I may have used more vegetables than suggested because I ended up using about 40oz of chicken stock instead of 32oz. But it still turned out delicious. This recipe will definitely go into my regular rotation of recipes. Thanks!

Yum!  I tried this on a whim just to see if I'd like it and I'm glad I tried it!  I did roast the squash in the 400 degree oven as suggested by others and I think it intensified the flavor.  Not really necessary to chop all the veggies, just cut them in smaller pieces and cook the heck out of them....let the blender take it from there.  I didn't add any cream, cream cheese or anything to make it creamier.  It was creamy enough on it's own without the added calories.  Very good on a cold afternoon.  Definitely will be making it again.  Will try to freeze some and see how that works out.

This soup was delicious! We substituted sweet potatoes for regular potatoes, as suggested, and I added a some nutmeg and ground ginger along with the salt and pepper. It made so much soup our wee blender couldn't handle it, so we simply used a potato masher to blend things up a bit. The sour cream was a necessary finishing touch. Fabulous!

The soup was smooth and subtle.  I served it at a dinner party last night and everyone loved it.  It is a creamy soup without the cream.
