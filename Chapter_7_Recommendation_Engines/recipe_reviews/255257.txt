This is by far the best surprise I’ve received. It tastes just like my great grandmas dumplins. I’m impressed with myself, lol. I did mix and match the chicken. I used 1 split breast and 3 thighs. It was kinda hairy at first but it all came together. I read all the previous comments and applied more seasoning. It was just perfect! One thing I haven’t seen written anywhere is that people aren’t supposed to eat the bay leaf. Not because it’s poison but because it’s sharp. Keep that in mind when cooking with them. Trash them after or ensure everyone knows to remove them from their bowl.

Oh so good. Like what my grandma used to make. I lost my wafer dumpling recipe in one of our relocations so I came here looking hoping I would get lucky and there was a nice person who posted one. I despise biscuit dumplings and was refusing to make them til a new wafer type recipe was found. I did make some changes to this recipe. I like my chicken and dumplings with a little more herbs and spices so I added rosemary, thyme, oregano, poultry seasoning, black pepper and some basil in small amounts into the dumpling batter before rolling it out. I forgot how much effort goes into rolling those things out! Turned out really well for me and I added a small bit of spices to the stew broth as well. Seal of approval and a you should definately make this again and often from my husband. That right there is shocking and almost unheard of as it had carrots, celery and onions in the broth. We loved this recipe and want to say thank you for posting it to the site. Definately going to be made on a regular basis here from now on.

Love love love this!  I have searched for a good chicken and dumpling recipe for years. This one was like sitting down at my moms dinner table. I used thighs and drumsticks and tripled the carrots and celery.

Very simple. Very good. The only things I changed was cutting my vegetables smaller for my toddler. Reading other reviews saying it was kind of thin I used corn starch instead of flour with the water out of the chicken so that it would be thicker.

Pretty good but I would like it a bit thicker.  I added a can of cream of chicken soup to it to thicken it up a little.  I thought about using some instant potatoes to help thicken it but I didn't.  I like cut dumplings much better than drop dumplings so these hit the spot.

I only make this once a year because I get crazy and will eat the entire pot, by myself in two days, no kidding!  Note, just like chili, spaghetti or soup, it's always better the next day and by the way,  the consistency will thicken slightly by day two

Great recipe! Using self rising flour made fantastic dumplings, I never thought of that! Will definitely be making again. my family has asked that I increase the amount of seasoning next time.

This is the best chicken and dumplings I ever had! My family loved it! I had to used a different recipe for the dumplings because I did not have self-rising flour, but it wasn’t much different from the original, so it worked out perfectly.

Best chicken & dumplings I've had in sooooo long. I love these rolled dumplings and this is the perfect recipe. Cook up nice and dense but not doughy.

I made this in the InstaPot with chicken thighs and white meat tenders and chopped onions, carrots and celery. Sautéed on normal until soft and lightly browned chicken. Selected high pressure according; set timer for 9 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Set it to sauté low and added dumplings simmered partially covered until done or you could put the lid on with the vent open. Amazing!!!

I made this following directions and it was outstanding!  I did use chicken breasts. I did not make the dumplings but made the  Simple bisquick  mix. However, next time I will make the dumplings. The flavor of the chicken soup was  wonderful!

This was my first attempt at making dumplings and they turned out really good! I had to add extra broth to the flour for some reason, otherwise made exactly as written. We all really enjoyed this. Thanks for a great recipe!

This stuff is amazing.  There were only 3 of us and we ended up eating all of it!  Well worth the time it takes.
