I've been making these for years without the raisins.  Aother really good alternative is to use butterscotch chips with the chow mein noodles instead of chocolate.  They always go really fast, and are quick to whip up.

Trying to make these into balls with my hands was just about impossible, it just sticks to you.  I ended up just grabbing some, squishing it together best I could and plopping it onto the paper.  These cookies taste good and I love the crunchiness.  I can't wait to make these again!

These cookie 'haystacks' are dead easy to make, and best of all they require no baking time!  
I'd recommend chopping up the dry chow mein noodles a bit as the ones I bought were quite
long.  Great first-time recipe for kids.

I've always loved these!  I substituted 1 1/2 cup of marshmallows for the raisins. I may have had too much chocolate, because I had to add an extra 1/2 cup of chow mein noodles to thicken it up a bit.

Huge hit will all ages at my daughter's graduation party. A representative from the senior ladies table came in for a plate of them to share! Still too sticky after overnight at room temp. Recommend some frig time. Used the freezer because I was crunched for time,but it turned some of the pieces white- still tasted good though. Try breaking up the noodles into smaller pieces and you'll find the pieces are much easier to drop off a spoon and stay together. Too sticky to roll.

I loved these ! I tried it with butterscotch chips also- so good. also a dollop of peanut butter melted with choc. chips was tasty. :) it might also be cool to dust them with powdered sugar in a muddy buddies-esque way :)

My Mom made a similar recipe but with milk chocolate.  Will use that next time, much better.

Because I was serving a crowd with allergies, I changed the peanuts to sunflower seeds, to keep the saltiness. I also sprinkled some sea salt to add some umph to it. One problem that I had was that the chocolate didn't cover all of the stuff, like in the picture. However, I kind of liked being able to see the noodles.

I liked this but I'm not a fan of chow mien noodles. Would be good with pretzels instead. Also for a cute Easter decoration add Cadbury eggs!! :)

so easy. was looking for an quick chocolate item to add to a tray of holiday goodies.  this fit the bill, fast, easy, and delicious.  I just dropped spoonfuls onto waxed paper to harden.
