Easy, cheap and massive!  I made this last night and had to transfer from a large pot to my largest soup pot, by the time I added the cannelini beans.  Lesson 1, use a huge pot!  My husband is NOT a kale fan, but he loved this and even packed a large bowl for his lunch today.  Changes I made: 1. I don't use MSG, so instead of Knorr bouillon + water, I used 8 c. of veggie broth (can use homemade or a good, cheap version like Trader Joe's).  I generously added Trocomare (organic leek/celery) salt as well as sea salt to help with flavor. 2. I didn't peel the potatoes before cubing and they were delicious.  Changes I'll make next time: 1. Add a bay leaf; 2. Half the dried parsley from 2 Tbsp down to 1 Tbsp. A wonderful soup recipe and an easy way to eat the superfood kale!

Since I had a bag of fresh kale on hand, I came to All Recipes looking for a recipe I use it in. I chose this recipe because of the reviews and because I had the ingredients on hand. I was not disappointed. This was a very tasty soup. I reduced the oil by half, and only used one large potato. That was plenty of potato for my tastes. Everything else I kept exactly as written and it was a very hearty soup. My one suggestion would be to cook it longer. Next time I will leave out the potatoes and beans for about 45 minutes. Then I will add them and cook for another 45 minutes. I just found my kale to be too tough after about 45  minutes of simmering.

This soup is so delicious.  I made this recipe for my son's preschool class and most of the kids wanted seconds and some wanted thirds.  It was such a big hit that around 5 or 6 moms called me to tell me that their child came home talking about the soup and so they wanted the recipe.  The moms could not believe how much their kids loved such a healthy soup!

Holy moly. I was looking for a recipe to use up some kale I had and am so glad I chose this one! It was even better the second day. I didn't have regular diced tomatoes and used fire-roasted diced instead, and the heat was nice. Also didn't have cannellinis and substituted black-eyed peas. I'm making it again tonight, this time with a nice fresh tomato and pink beans. Thank you!!!

I've made this soup multiple times now. It's come out great every time. The recipe is very forgiving,  allowing for imprecise measurements. I like trying different colors of kale and potatoes to really get a rainbow soup - purple potatoes or purple kale for example. I have been adding tofu, which is another nice addition.

I made this soup for a quick dinner tonight served with buttermilk biscuits.  It was really delicious!  I didn't have any potatoes so I substituted pre chopped butternut squash from the supermarket.  I diced the squash into small bite size cubes for quick cooking and it was delicious.  I also served some homemade hot sauce on the side (I like it spicy but my BF does not).  Great easy & healthy soup on a chilly autumn night!

Good as is; fantastic with 1 1/2 t chili powder blend from Spice Hunters (a mix of chili powder, onion powder, garlic, cocoa, oregano, red pepper, cumin, cinnamon, and cloves). I made this with chicken broth instead of vegetable buillion and yukon golds instead of white potatoes (skin left on) because that's what I had on hand. Cooked up in about 15-20 mins. I never thought I liked kale until I tried this soup. Thanks so much for the recipe!

I'd give this 10 stars if it were possible! I used organic vegetable broth and added more garlic than the recipe allows, added carrots and black beans as well as an additional can of cannellini beans. I also added red pepper flakes for some spice and a bay leaf. This makes a lot of soup! The flavor is outstanding for such a simple recipe. So healthy and a wonderful way to enjoy all the benefits of the superfood kale.

This was a really wonderful, easy recipe.  I did not have dried Italian seasoning or parsley on hand so I substituted Herbs de Provence (which is mostly a lot of thyme).  It was an interesting flavor, but I think I'll just add dried basil and oregano next time.  My boyfriend who is a big meat eater LOVED this soup and I will certainly make it again.

I am on a strict naturopathic diet at the moment and cannot have potatoes, legumes, sugar or additives. So I replaced the potatoes and beans with carrots, celery, zucchini. I used a vegetable broth instead of water and bouillon,  and a 28 oz can of tomatoes instead of 14. Lots of little changes you can make, but kale is the important part!

This is a great easy soup! Changes: I used 1 can of white beans, two fresh tomatoes, and about a cup of mashed potatoes flakes. Omitted the oil....just sauteed the onions, garlic, and kale in the base: a combo of veggie and mushroom "better than bouillon. Tossed in some black pepper, Bells seasoning, and a little sprinkle of crushed red pepper. Wow, it smells like Thanksgiving and tastes almost as good with almost no fat!

I love this soup!  Ive made it twice and think the flavor is perfect.  I made a few adjustments this time:  I added only 1 can of beans, increased the kale by another handful and added carrots and celery for a more hearty vegetable soup. My boyfriend is an extremely picky eater and he gobbles this up.  A huge success in my house! I'm making it again next weekend for a family dinner, can't wait!

I put too many beans in mine, but it was still good.  Nothing to rave about, but I did like the flavor.  Husband hated it, I think it was the kale.  He said it tasted like someone did the gardening and left the remains in his bowl.

This is a great basic recipe for soup.  A couple of adjustments I made were to add browned hot  sausage, really adds to the flavor.  Also, I do not like bouillion cubes, too salty for us.  I use the boxed low sodium vegetable broth.

Great vegetarian recipe!  I wanted to cut down on the carbs and up the fiber, so I halfed the potatoes, tripled the kale, and doubled the tomatoes and it came out wonderful.

This recipe gets 5 stars simply for the versatility and forgiving nature. Substitute away, folks! I suddenly remembered I had a bunch of kale in my fridge from the CSA (darn "crisper" drawers, keeping my veggies out of sight/mind, lol!) The kale was pretty limp, so I figured chucking it into some soup was the way to go. I also had half a bag of baby carrots and half a bag of fresh green beans that needed to be used up so voila! I didn't have potatoes or any kind of beans on hand (besides the green beans) but everything tasted lovely anyway. I Used a 32oz container of chicken broth, plus 4 cups of water and some vegetable and chicken boullion to bring the liquid to 8 cups. Whatever, worked just fine. used a combo of herbs de provence and italian seasoning, so as not to have too much oregano flavoring. Used one huge tomato from the CSA instead of a can of diced. Also added a few splashes of louisiana hot sauce, not for heat, but because I thought it would add a nice dimension, and I'm glad I did it. It all came together so nicely. I really appreciated the texture and heartiness that the kale provided. It doesn't wilt down to mush like spinach would. Served with a rustic italian bread on the side, for sopping up broth. Awesome! I will make this again, and I'm sure no 2 batches will ever be the same. I am ok with that!

Great way to use Kale. I would make this again when I have lots of Kale to use up. I used a healing homemade chicken broth. Didn't peel the potatoes that were half white and half red. Couldn't tell in the coup. I didn't have italian spice so I added some of each  basil, oregano, thyme, celery seed and nettle.

loved this soup! We didn't have any cannellini beans so I substituted organic garbanzo beans (canned) and used a ton of italian seasoning and pepper.

We are not vegan or even vegetarian but I've read Eat to Live, Eat for Health, You on a Diet, The China Study, and Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease.  They all recommend a vegan life style so I decided to give a few recipes a try.  This was my first choice and a great one.  Even my meat and potato loving husband liked the soup and heated and ate a bowl of the left overs for his lunch today before I got home.  My only change was I added an 8 oz can of low sodium V-8 juice as I let it simmer too fast and too much of the liquid evaporated. That solved the problem and it was fantastic.  Definitely a repeat.

This was a great recipe and I will definitely make it again!  I love that it makes so much as we now have food for a few more dinners.  I changed a few things in the recipe.  I substituted the water and vegetable bouillon for chicken stock and added turkey sausage.  I didn't have diced tomatoes so I used two fresh tomatoes and I didn't have Italian seasoning so I just threw in some thyme, basil and oregano plus I used some frozen parsley as I didn't have the dry stuff.

4 WW points per cup!! Was looking for something interesting to create and this popped up on the welcome screen. Told the family that this is what's for dinner. 16 yr old was open to the idea, hub is addicted to meat so he was a harder sell. So quick and easy to make, hardly dirtied anything. Cubed the potatoes really small so some broke up to give it a creamy texture. I used 2 full cans of the cannellini beans so that was about 40 oz and doubled the kale - next time MORE kale :) Ended up with an 18 cup pot (for all you WW out there). Of course this will vary but it won't be much less. Son had 2 bowls, hub said "tasty" and didn't miss the meat :) Will definitely make this again and again an again :)

I substituted two cartons of Swanson's Vegetable Broth for the water and bouillon, and used unpeeled potatoes. I had a can of Great Northern beans, so used that plus one can Cannellini.
Thank you for this recipe; definite keeper. :)

I love this soup.  I make a half batch at a time, but I use a whole can of tomatoes with the half batch.  Even family members who laugh at my vegetarian concoctions or who haven't eaten kale like this.

This soup was delicious!  I have never cooked with Kale.  I was reading about the health benefits of Kale and thought I would try making soup. I used chicken broth & veggie broth & added some pasta.  I put fresh grated parm on top before serving.  Real comfort food!

Whoa! Crazy amount of salt because of the boullion cubes. Next time I will use regular cartons of veggie broth. Aside from that, wonderfully hardy and delicious soup! Makes a ton, I froze half, hopefully it wil reheat well.

I loved this recipe with a few variations. I used Vegetable broth instead of bouillon cubes and a small can of tomato paste instead of tomatoes, which I don't like. I also added tumeric, curry powder and sriracha sauce to give it more flavor. Taste even better the next day.

Yum! I was a bit concerned about the ingredients pairing together well, but I really enjoyed this soup! It's really easy to make and very filling. I did make a few modifications based on preference and ingredient availability: I used 2 large potatoes and that was more than enough for me (the soup was packed with potatoes) and I used 8 c veggie broth instead of water and veggie bouillon. I think I'll also add another can of beans next time. I also wish the amount of kale required would have been more specific. My grocery store only had the bagged kale so I had to guess on the amount. I ended up using probably 5-6 cups of kale and I'll likely add more next time. Anyways, great recipe that I will make again and even my meat-loving, soup-hating husband seemed to enjoy :)

This was excellent soup. I had kale in my garden so used that as well as fresh tomatoes. I tweaked the recipe to what I had on hand. I only had butter beans which were really good in this soup. I made my own Italian seasoning and used low-sodium chicken stock as that was what I had on hand. Can't wait to eat left-overs. Good recipe Donna!

I love, love, love this soup and have made it three times this month already. It is simple and delicious. Stir frying the kale, onions and garlic first certainly makes it much more flavorful.

DELISH!! I have always wanted to like kale, but despised it until I made this soup - lol).  Since my doc said I needed to cut carbs, I didn't put potatoes in mine and only used 1 can of beans.  I sliced up a couple carrots which offset the "bite" of the kale.  Awesome and easy to modify according to personal taste.

Super delicious, super hearty, super cheap, and (perhaps best of all!), uses up large amounts of kale.  The only change I made to this one was to add a head of roasted garlic to the broth, which made it extra delicious.  Could not have been happier with this soup.

Delicious! The only thing I did different was 4c of veggie broth and 4c of water instead of the buillion.  My boyfriend did want less potatoes next time too..but I loved it.

Yummy! My husband and I really enjoyed this soup. It's great to find good recipes with kale. I did minor adjustments: 8 cups msg free veggie broth, chick peas (bc didn't have cannellini), red potatoes with skin, and agreed a bay leaf. Great soup!

I love this soup.  The mix of brothie goodness and a variety of satisfying textures makes this a very comforting and hearty meal.  With only 8 cups of liquid it is sort of stew-like though so I added 4 extra cups of vegetable broth and it worked beautifully.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This has a good taste. I did feel there needed to be more than just Italian seasoning in it so I experimented with both garlic and onion powder. BUT there is way too much food in this recipe! I cut potatoes down to two large ones and kept skin on. I added only one can beans.

I made it, but I modified it a little bit. I added celery and carrots to the mix to add a little more color, and I used some cumin and oregano to bring out the flavor a little more. I would definitely make this again!

I made my own recipe before finding this one, and then made the decision of adding kale. My recipe was 4 cups of vegetable broth, five cut and diced red potatoes, half a bag of extra thick egg noodles, 1 1/2 cup of frozen mixed veggies, and 1 bunch kale. That's it! Doesn't need salt/pepper/spices in my opinion. It was very delicious, and I'm sure that this recipe is as well!

My whole family loved it! I added carrots and celery to the onions and garlic. Then sautéed the kale with that till it was really soft, just because I know that's how my kids will eat it, then added broth and potatoes. Boiled until everything was ready and added the beans. Absolutely delicious! Then my husband and I added his homemade habanero sauce to ours.

I think of recipes as great beginnings - I followed this recipe mind you, I just embellished. I added a rind of Parmesan reggiano and 1 tbls of balsalmic vinegar..It was so amazing! It was great before mind you; but, I love the hints of balsalmic and the saltiness of the cheese rind.

This is one of our favorite fall/winter/early spring dishes, paired with a loaf of fresh sourdough or multigrain bread. We sub low sodium "Better Than Broth" in the soup and add a pinch of crushed red pepper flakes to each bowl of the end result for a little kick. Our 2 and 4 year old love this soup as well. A real family-pleaser for us!

I love kale, but sadly the bunch I purchased for this soup was moldy so I was forced to sub spinach.  All the same, this soup was was still tasty although the kale would have given it more texture.  I used a 2.1oz carton of Knorr's vegetable bouillon (6 extra large cubes), 7 cups of water, and a can of diced tomatoes with green chilis for some heat.  Once the potatoes were tender I turned the heat off and added the beans as the soup was cooling in order to prevent them from becoming too mushy.  I let this sit in the fridge overnight as I do with most of my soups/stews.  A perfect vegetarian soup - just in time for Lent!

A friend of mine gave me a bunch of kale out of his garden.  I did not know what to do with kale so I went to the internet looking for ideas.  I found this recipe.  I decided to try it.  I did make a couple of changes.  Since we are not vegetarians I added some meat from a few beef ribs that I pressure cooked.  Instead of cannellini beans I used pinto beans because that was all I had.  I added one large carrot cut into bite size pieces.  I used six cups of chicken broth and two cups of broth from the ribs I pressured.  I cut back on the Italian seasoning.  It turned out wonderful.  My husband liked it before I was even finished putting it together and the next day it was really delicious.  I defintely will be making this recipe again. Next time I might try a different green like collards or turnip greens just to see if it will be as good with other kinds of greens.

I had a house full of sick people over Christmas, including a couple vegetarians. This soup is fantastic "I'm sick and I need soup" soup. I left a pot of it on the stove and people arose at different times and they hovered over their bowl in peace. Everyone loved it, even the few (me) who weren't sick.

Only change was veggie stock for water and buillion.

This is a great recipe, I make it about twice a month. My two tweaks: 1. Cut down on the veggie bouillon by 2 cubes, you don't even miss it. 2. More kale and less potatoes. I prefer hardier soups.

Wow, this is really good soup!  I added some diced carrot and corn niblets for more veggies.  I also omitted the Italian seasoning and used seasoned salt and a bit of thyme instead.  This soup can be easily customized to fit your family's personal tastes.  I will make this over and over again!

I halved this recipe but otherwise followed exactly... It was delicious.  My BF (who is new to eating vegetables somehow) declared this his all-time favorite soup and has requested I make it again this weekend.  I'll make a whole batch and use dried/prepared beans instead of cans, but this is a keeper recipe for sure.

This is a fantastic healthy soup! I used half water/half chicken broth, because I don't like the msg in bouillon cubes.  Makes a TON, so I am planning to freeze half of it.

Great hearty soup! I used kidney beans, added a few carrots, some leftover rice, about a tbsp of lemon juice and used dried oregano, basil and parsley for the herbs. I topped each bowl with a drizzle of olive oil, some grated asiago cheese and some fresh ground pepper. Will definitely make again.

made this tonight, we are not true vegetarians but we are starting to not care for meat too much. I looked on here for some ideas and came across this one. I have heard that kale is really good for you so we whipped it up tonight. Quite good! The kale is surprisingly good. We will make this again for sure!!

I really like this soup!  The only changes I made were to use broth rather than water and bouillion cubes (had no cubes in the pantry), and I replaced one of the cans of cannellini beans with a can of chickpeas.  Easy to make and I will definitely be making it again.

I'm glad I like this because it makes an insane amount of food! You could easily feed 10 or more. I did use chard instead of kale and I could see how kale would be way better.watch your boullion cubes though, I believe (and I very much could be wrong) the author meant to use the cubes with the ratio 1 cube to one cup of water. The stores here only carry the ones that are good for 2 cups of water. It could be very salty to use the full amount of cubes.

My family loved this soup! It was delicious and it made plenty for left overs. I did change two things...
1. I used dried basil instead of Italian seasoning
2. I added 3 extra cups of water and 2 extra bouillon cubes

I will definitely be making this soup again

INDEED AMAZING! Perfect for flu season or cool cool nights. I ended up using more h20 then called for (between 8 and 12 cups) less bullion (4) and added celery, paprika and rosemary. I also used 7 cloves of garlic and split the beans with about 1.5cups garbonzo and 1 can of black eyes peas. half red onion and half yellow because it was on hand. Once served with cornbread I'm beginning to think this wont last past tomorrow. . . do yourself a favor and TRY THIS TONIGHT!

It makes a ton and you could half this recipe easily. I sweated 1/2 a big red onion chopped in the olive oil, with about 6 cloves of garlic chopped. Then I cut up 6 small-med potatoes, threw those in with 2 boxes of organic chicken broth, I had some grape tomatoes about to turn so I cut those and threw them in, added a can of cannelini beans (I would add another like the recipe says if making the full thing-and add them toward the end so they don't disintegrate) a can of crushed/chopped? tomatoes, the parsley, only 1 tsp of the italian seasoning, S&P, a head of kale chopped up without the stems... I boiled it to cook up the potatoes and kale at first and then left it to simmer a while longer just because I like the potatoes and kale to be a lot softer. It's good! I also added a dash of parmasan cheese on top. I think it would go nicely with a crusty bread.

Delicious. The only adjustments I made were omitting the potatoes, and using Northern beans instead of cannellini (couldn't find in my local store). It was so quick and easy to make for lunch. My girls (4 and 21 months) enjoyed it too. A great way to add some dark leafy greens to your diet!

WOW! EZ & Delicious! Fast too! I didn't have Italian seasoning so I added fresh Thyme, Rosemary, Basil & Bay leaf. I also added a left over parsnip & 5 asparagus (just coz I had 'em). My Kale was a large bag of mixed greens I had to use up. I also omitted tomatoes (didn't have). I used 2 large peeled russet potatoes b/c that's what I had. Next time I will cut up the kale smaller. And my BF who hates soup & beans loved it!  I'm impressed! Thank you for this grand healthy soup. :)  I won't use russetts next time, too mushy.

Fantastic.  Change it up a bit due to what I had at home.  I added a bunch of parsley, chopped green pepper, fresh chopped tomatoes instead of canned, no cannellini beans and only three potatoes.  Can't wait to make it again.  It was even better the next few days.

I loved this soup!  I used klamath potatoes (unpeeled) since that was what I had on hand.  After I started making this, I realized that I only had 3 bouillon cubes, so I upped the garlic and spices a bit and added some dried celery flakes.  I also used the fire roasted tomatoes as someone had suggested.  I seriously ate half of the pot in one day, it was so good!

Simple and tasty. ^_^ This soup is perfect for a chilly night and goes REALLY well with ciabatta bread. I did add some oregano, extra garlic, and only used 4 potatoes. I didn't want them to take over the stew.
This is extra tasty with 2 links of sliced vegan Italian sausage instead of beans.

Delicious and super easy! I made a few changes based on what I had in the house. I used red kidney beans instead of white, and I used chicken stock. I used fresh tomato, and parsley. I also added chard and celery, and used a few kinds of potatoes. I belong to a CSA and this soup was a great way to use up a lot of the veggies I had. This soup is perfect with a hunk of crusty bread.

I was amazed that I could make something so good!  Omitted the oil altogether and sauteed in cooking spray so it was virtually fat free, and still delicious! I will be making again (as soon as I eat my way through the stockpile that has taken over my freezer).

Maybe this needs the MSG-laced broth (I used some without), or maybe Italian seasoning varies from brand to brand, but we thought this was just okay. It needed more tang, or some acidic ingredient like lemon. I tried lemon pepper (good) and shredded fresh parmesan (great). This does have promise -- I love the ingredients, so I am going going to try again with tweaks.

I admit I am a kale addict.  I especially love the smooth leaf although it is not as available as the curly leaf. Having said that I loved the recipe.

Um, yum!  This soups an amazingly rich flavor!  I *forgot* to add the beans (lol), but it still tasted great.  I was scared by the amount of kale (a lot) and water (just enough for cover) at first, but it did wonders to not thin out the flavor.  I chose to be heavy handed on the seasoning and used "Tuscan Blend" - a bread dipper mix from Oil and Vinegar.  It was *awesome*.  Even my three and 1 1/2 year old liked it and I really thought they'd think it was disgusting!  For some other additions, I added a pound of baby bella mushrooms and sauteed that at the beginning.  I used grape tomatoes instead of the diced tomatoes to add a little bit of sweetness into the mix.  I didn't slice them or anything.  I wanted the tomato juice to stay in tact within their skins.  One last thing, I admit I un-vegetarianed it by added chicken base instead of vegetable bouillons!

I made it with kidney beans because those were the only ones I had on hand, and I think the substitution worked well. So good I ate the huge pot of soup by myself in two days.

This soup inspired me to make my own version of kale soup, and it ended up amazing! Thank you for the inspiration. I used chicken broth & water  vs vegetable bouillon, Rotel for the tomatoes, black eyed peas for the white cannellini beans, italian seasoning & italian seasoning in a packet, red chili pepper flakes, and no salt. I topped it with diced red onion, and shredded cheese.

This soup was delicious ! It feels great to be able to make and eat something healthy and so tasty at the same time ! I halved the recipe to use up a half bunch of kale.I used  an 8 oz can of tomato sauce, for 1/2 can of diced tomato. Also, I simmered   the soup for 30 minutes, before adding the beans and potatoes, and then cooked an additional 30 minutes. I used chicken broth for water + bouillon cubes and added some chopped fresh parsley at the end of coooking.

Very good!

I made with dried beans (cannellini & black) -- in under an hour (salt restricted diet).  Started the cannelline in plain water.  When they nearly done added black.  

Cooked to just Al dente.

Drained.

Then followed recipe using "Kitchen Basics Unsalted Vegetable Cooking Stock."  Still 240mg but that is far less than canned beans and "normal" stock / broth.

This soup was very good.  However, I did add extra garlic and my own blend of Italian seasoning.  Delicious in bread bowls from Panera Bread Co.  Call ahead and they will have them ready for you--already cut!  My only complaint about this soup is that the kale was still a bit tough after cooking.  Maybe the kale I bought was a little overgrown, rather than young and tender...  Thanks for a great recipe.

This was easy and excellent. 
I didn't have potatoes, so I added extra beans (rinsed) and tomatoes. Feel free to use vegetable stock if you don't have bullion cubes.
I simmered for an hour. Keeps very well in the fridge; can't wait to share with friends and bring to work potlucks!

I liked this soup.  As I usually do, I added a few things that I had around.  Used Chicken bouillon as I didn't have the veggie ones.  Used twice as many tomatoes,  4 potatoes, instead of six, one can of beans and 1/8 tsp. cayenne pepper.  Flavor was great!

I really liked this soup.  I don't like my food to be too spicy and this was great.  I didn't/couldn't find vegetable bouillon so I used two packages of Knorr Vegetable soup mix (the kind you use for Spinach Dip) and it was very good.  I didn't have any parsley either, so it would be interesting to see how much flavor that would add.  I will definitely be making this soup again....as I have stopped eating meat.

Believe the hype!
I skipped the potatoes and used one bullion cube for a half recipe, it was plenty salty. The only other change I made was to add a few shakes of crushed red pepper. 
Thanks so much!

I tried this recipe just this afternoon to use up some fresh kale. Oh boy am I glad I did! Very tasty broth and filling with good for you superfood kale and protein packed beans. Delicious, even my fussy husband tried it because it smelled so yummy. He thought it was "PDG" Pretty Darn Good! I will definitely make again, maybe changing it up a bit by replacing the beans with barley or tortellini.

FANTASTIC!!!!!  I have to make a double batch each time!  I substitute chopped garlic from a jar in the produce section and mini carrots instead of the beans.  Just love it and so very easy to make. Enjoy!

Amazing! Only modifications were using vegetable broth rather than water and bouillon cubes, sweet potatoes rather than white and one can mixed beans and one can navy beans. Oh, and I used a 19 ounce can of stewed whole tomatoes and chopped them myself. Best soup I've ever made- even my picky toddler and preschooler liked it. Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe,thanks!!

This soup is fantastic! I didn't add beans or potatoes because I don't enjoy soup with a grainy texture, but everything else plus corn and peas (and probably any veggies you want) were added and it was spectacular!

Good. Easy to put together and very filling. I didn't have vegetable buillon, so I substituted with chicken broth.

I've made this recipe several times because it is easy and delicious.  I make a lot of veggie soups but I keep coming back to this one because it doesn't require pureeing/blending.  Plus it's chock full of healthy ingredients.

This is a very tasty soup--my 14 month old and 5 year old couldn't get enough!  The only changes I made were to add some celery and leeks, because I had them lying around.  I also added more garlic.  The flavors were great for a veggie soup!

Absolutly loved this soup, so easy to make, yet so tasty, warming and really filling. I have made it a few times now, you can pretty much throw anything in there, swip and swap ingredients. I have used various beans instead of canellini - butterbeans, kidney beans, borlotti beans.

Surprisingly tasty recipe. I will certainly make it again. I changed a couple of things. I used chicken broth instead of water and bouillon, I added 1/2 teaspoon crushed red peppers and did not season with Italian dressing, parsley or salt and pepper. Topped each serving bowl with grated parmesan cheese.

Love this soup!  The photo Donna B. posts does not do it justice.  I however do not eat white potatoes so use sweet potatoes.  Yum!  And I sub one can of the white beans for red kidney beans.  Yum again.  Thank you Donna B.  A delilcious way to get our kale going.

My Portuguese hubby didn't like the Italian seasoning in this, nor did I. We didn't like the soup the first day (should have listened to the other ladies), but by the 2nd & 3rd day it was really delicious.  I'll be making it again and letting it sit for a couple of days.

Really enjoyed this soup.  Even my leary kids loved it.  We didn't keep it completely vegetarian... used chicken boullion and sprinkled with parmasan cheese.  Would definately make this again.

This is a new favorite.  I turned it into a turkey/kale stew and made some notable changes, but the broth and spices are what made this a huge hit.  I added 1# ground turkey and took out the tomatoes and potatoes.  Sometimes I remove the beans or reduce them to 1 cup for a lower carb option.  This recipe is great because it's so adaptable.  I think the veggie bouillon and the Italian seasoning are the secret ingredients.  Healthy, high in protein and low in fat.  I LOVE THIS!

This was a delicious and healthy soup. I substituted zucchini for bell peppers and added 2 cups of cooked red wheat and 1 cup of cooked split peas. The kale held so much flavor. I absolutely loved this soup and was equally surprised to see that my kids enjoyed it also. This is definitely a keeper.

Great soup!!!Used  red potatoes and added an extra one,also used one can of cannellini beans and one of red kidney beans. Also added diced tomatoes seasoned with basil, garlic, & oregano. Added beans towards end of cooking and added garlic salt instead of just salt and onion powder to taste. Served each bowl with Parmesan cheese on top. Will make this soup again! :)

I'm typing this as I'm enjoying the most delicious soup I've ever had.  I followed this recipe almost to a T (I added more garlic, used yukon potatoes, added beans with 10 minutes to go, served with grated parm) and it's fantastic!!!

A wonderful, healthy soup.  I used extra garlic. Like others, I used 8 cups of low sodium vegetable broth and chunked up half a package of small waxy fingerling potatoes.  I didn't drain the beans, and had no Italian seasoning, so simply added dried basil and oregano, plus fresh chopped parsley at the end.  Excellent the day it's made, and gets better by the next.  A keeper!

This was the first soup I've ever made...and I'm 27. :D However, I'm a super picky fairly well-cultured girl and this soup definitely satisfied all of my going-out-to-eat requirements (what I usually do!).  It is absolutely fantastic and looked gorgeous. I added at least 2 extra TBS of italian seasoning to the soup, like another reader suggested--it enhanced the broth so much. I will definitely make this again.

This is the BEST soup- and I made it all Organic, too! So the very few changes I made were primarily with the bouillon- I went to my local co-op and found a brand of bouillon called "Better Than Bouillon" Organic Vegetable Base. It is a thick sauce to spoon as opposed to cubes- and since I had no Italian seasoning or parsley (my bad) I only used salt and pepper- and it was wonderful! I am sending this to my sister, Kay and know this will be a hit with her, too. Thanks so much.

So many ingredients, so simple to make! It turned out beautiful and delicious. I substituted half cup of water and bouillon for some low sodium veggie broth. I also used low sodium bouillon. Delicious! Make sure you put it in the largest soup pot you've got! Mine was about overflowing!

This is sooo delicious and healthy!! I used a little more kale. I think this recipe would be even better with chickpeas instead of white beans.

Pretty good, but as is I think the broth needs more body. Next time I will thicken it with some flour or cornstarch. It took my potatoes WAY longer to cook than 25 minutes.  Also, I had some beet greens I had to cook, so I added those in with the kale, mostly for some extra color.

We just love this soup. It’s full of flavor no matter what I put in it. Tonight I left out the potatoes, used only 1 can of beans, added shredded chicken, celery, and carrots. It was so delicious!

Sorry I just couldn't give this 5 stars.  Just thought I was stretching it to give it 3.  I, first of all, made it to recipe, tasted it and it just didn't have any flavor.  Beings I was going to serve this for company, I knew I couldn't serve as is.  So I added herbs, etc until getting it to half way acceptable.  I did get compliments but really wasn't sure if they were sincere or just being courtesy-nice.  IMOP I did think with my additions it was pretty good.  Anyway, this was my opinion as I do like lots of flavor!!!!

I didn't need the soup to be vegetarian.  I just needed a soup with lots of veggies that I had in the fridge.  This was perfect.  I added 2 sweet Italian sausages.  I removed the casing and crumbled in a pan.  I drained it and then added to soup.  Yummy!  This will be a regular winter soup.

Love this recipe! I used vegetable stock instead of 6 cups of water and bouillon cubes. Every else was exactly the same and it’s delicious! Will definitely make this again. Mind you I don’t really cook like that and this was easy and made me feel “accomplished” in the kitchen lol

This soup is a good meal prep for a busy college student. I used broth by itself rather than adding Knorr (to keep it low sodium). It was very plain tasting that way but used Sriracha on top when I served it. I stuck to 3 potatoes to have less carbs, but it still seemed sufficient. I think adding any more would be too much for this serving. Overall, will be making again!

I substituted 1 can of Cannellini beans with kidney beans (only one at the store),  3/4ths of a bag of triple washed kale vs. what was called for, and I added 3 chicken bullion cubes in the recipe.

Simmered everthing in a dutch oven.  Loved it  and I will definitely make this again.

A very savory, flavorful and surprisingly hearty soup that was quick and easy to make.

I made a few changes: 2 shallots instead of yellow onion. 2 large carrots. I used chickpeas as that’s what I had. Bay leaves during the boiling and fresh cracked pepper. Top with freshly grated aged Asiago.

Second time around. I used mustard greens instead of kale. Was easier, didn't bother to wilt the greens in the oil. Added plenty of white potatoes, white beans, and Trader Joe's canned corn. Also I used no-sodium diced tomatoes with Italian seasoning, plus the recommended seasoning mentioned here, plus one tablespoon of dried parsley. 

The salt is the key to success. I want to have just barely enough. I strained out the water with the canned corn, that would have been too much. I poured in the whole contents of the canned beans. I used 4 cups of Pacific vegetable broth, which is 22% sodium per serving, but when added to another four cups of water, brings it down to a believable amount. Also I add red pepper flakes - these extend the savor without being salty.

Added chopped carrots with the potatoes.  My soup was not vegetarian because  cooked chopped chicken breast was added along with a butter and flour roux to thicken chicken broth (in place of water).  Very delicious !

This is delicious! And simple. Changes to recipe - DON’T ADD SALT! The bullion cubes have plenty. Next time I will add 3 cans of beans. And DEFINITELY drain and rinse the beans. The juice from the can is gelatinous, and that didn’t appeal to me. I will be making it again next week.

It’s delicious just hoped it would have been less of a hearty/chunky soup. I fail at making soups from scratch so this was a helpful start. I didn’t use any salt since some of the ingredients are canned but I used pepper, paprika and chili powder

Short prep time I halved the amount of potato’s and beans to make it for two people. It’s very satisfying on the palate ! Definitely recommend especially on a cold evening and add a large slice of challah bread.

The only change I made was to use 8 cups vegetable broth instead of water and bouillon.  I cannot even believe how delicious this soup is!  Just tried on a whim but didn't really think I liked kale.  The kale takes on the flavor of the spices and other ingredients.  This will be my go-to soup.  It is loaded with vitamins and good taste. Loved it!

Definitely needs more/different seasoning. Great recipe and makes plenty! I used Vegetable Stock and added some Butternut Squash to it as well. Will next time also use 2 cans of the tomatoes. If you wanted to get away from the Vegetarian aspect of it I think some Turkey Sausage crumbles would be great!

I made this because I already had most of the ingredients. I didn’t have white potatoes, so I used two large sweet potatoes and it was GREAT. The sweet and spicy went together so nicely.

I used 1/2 chicken broth/1/2 water with a chicken base (didn't have the vegetable bouillon) and I used chickpeas instead of the cannellini beans. My niece loved it!

Delicious soup!  DH says he could eat it every day!  I didn’t have any tomatoes: so I used a bit of tomato paste and cooked it off with the onions and garlic before adding the water. Will definitely make again. Thank you for sharing!

No canelli beans.  Used 3 large red potatoes with skins left on.  Added 3/4-1 C chopped carrot. Substituted Penzys Pasta Sprinkle for Italian seasoning.  Used 4 C water.  Family gave it a 10.

I did add several bay leaves and a Tbs. of balsamic vinegar. I also put in some Better than Bouillon Chickenish paste. I only put in 4 potatoes and regretted not putting in all 6 potatoes. Next time I make it I will use all 6 potatoes and maybe even another can of beans. This is the most wonderful soup recipe!

Made this in my instant pot came out delicious followed the instructions. I used sweet potato instead of potatoes and I seasoned my onions and garlic before I put my kale in . I don't measure so I can't tell you how much, also my beans were precooked and frozen in the freezer  for dishes like this. I did add some onion powder and garlic powder and a sprinkle of Lawry's  15 min on high  10 min npr than quick release

A pleasant all veggie soup. Takes a lot of prep but worth it. Could use a little more seasoning to your personal taste. I don't change recipes but make them as they are described to give a proper review of the recipe.

My family and I liked the soup. It was perfect with homemade turkey meatballs my husband made. I did add seasoning to the onion and garlic during the sautéing process and throughout. We like a lot of flavor. I also added garlic salt for a little extra taste. The fresh Parmesan at the end and garlic bread was a perfect touch! Definitely a keeper.

So easy to make. We loved it. Didn't have cannellini beans so I substituted Garbanzo.... delicious!  It was not a cold winters night but an extremely hot humid evening with no desire to grill and a garden full of Kale!  Thank you!

Perfect way to use up some thicker, second crop kale.  Substituted veg broth using 4 chicken bouillon cubes with water, and 4 cups mushroom broth.  Served with a crusty loaf of bread.  Simple, fast and tasty - will make again.

Delicious way to use up what's in the fridge. Any greens, potatoes, and beans on hand will work. Used dried ingredients for the rest and a bit of tomato paste. Added a splash of red wine with the water. Sprinkled with parmesan.  Half recipe was plenty for 3 adults to have two bowls each.

This soup is just fabulous.  I made a double batch for church and did not bring any of it home!  One gentleman ate three bowls and another gentleman asked for the recipe.  I did use vegetable broth rather than the water and bouillon.  I also also first  cooked everything but the potatoes and beans for 45 minutes and then added them and cooked for another 45 minutes.  It is just so yummy!!

DELICIOUS! I made a few minor modifications. My family is not a fan of chunky tomatoes, I substituted tomatoes for roasted red pepper and added 2 cups of Tomato sauce. Also added a fetw dashes of  hot sauce and roasted veggies stock.  Served with him safe croutons. OMGoodness! It was SOOOOOOOO declious.

The kale was too overpowering. The seasoning isn’t good either. It taste like kale water. I had to add seasonings to make it edible cause I didn’t want to waste a whole pot of food. Disappointing cause I know this site has some good recipes.

I used only one can of cannellini beans, more than 1/4 cup fresh parsley, three diced carrots,  2 bay leaves, and homemade mushroom broth.  It was a hit!!!  We will definitely have this soup again.  By the way, I do not peel potatoes.

This is delicious.  I made it exactly like the recipe.  Husband and 10 year old son loved it.  This says a lot because you know how finicky children can be.

It makes a large portion and is very tasty.  It's healthy and low in smart points for those who do Weight Watchers now known as WW.

Delicious!  Great recipe that can be tweaked based on what You have on hand and taste preference. 
Used 3 potatoes (because it was all I had )Omitted beans, added chopped carrots, Celery , fresh parsley and pasta. Also added a dash of cayenne pepper and crushed red pepper.
sautéed the onions, celery, carrots  and tomatoes first then added the spices, potatoes, kale and vegetable stock .  I used 4 cups veggie stock and 4 cups water 
Let it simmer about an hour and then added elbow pasta until it was done. Yum!!

Came out great! Only difference is I added mushrooms just for the sake of... mushrooms. I tend to prefer thicker soup, I might’ve liked to add something to thicken it, but it’s really great. Thank you!

Used this recipe as a starting point. Used spinach in lieu of kale, added broccoli, cauliflower and sweet potatoes; used thyme, Italian seasonings and bay leaf. Added a squeeze of lemon at the end with salt and pepper. Turned out great!

Thank you Donna B. for this yummy recipe.  This soup is amazing!   Our family devoured it ... and i have made it several times at their request!   I followed the directions as written with the exception of not peeling the potatoes &  adding  a few carrots and some celery.   I've also tried it with  Hominy  (in place of the beans) and a can of Rotel for a tiny kick... which was really good.   Such a hearty meal served alone or even better with some crusty bread!

So good!
I added some ham and it fit perfect with the recipe, added nice saltiness. I also served with some dinner buns and that suited it well. Had extra kale from garden and it tasted very yummy in this!

This soup was super simple and super delicious! It will also definitely fill you up. I made a few modifications; I used a mix of chicken stock and water for the broth, used red potatoes, and no tomatoes. For seasoning I added bay leaves, thyme, and crushed red pepper. Even my boyfriend who is not a fan of most cooked vegetables liked it. Will definitely make it again.

I made this a while back and loved it. I remembered eating it in December on one of the few days that snow was falling where I live and just had to make it again! Still tastes fantastic by the way, and it was fun to make!

Very forgiving recipe - used baby kale and spinach mix so did not require the longer cook time - Added about half the amount of potatoes and Did not add the beans as we are watching carbs, but added some carrots and leftover green beans.

Delicious and filling! I was expecting the kale to get gross in the soup since it's  a leafy green, but it really didn't get mushy in the days I had this soup in the fridge. I used tomato bouillon instead of just vegetable (I really like tomato flavored dishes), and added a good amount of red pepper for a kick.  For me, the extra heat added a lot to the soup, that being said I prefer all my soups to be on the spicier side.

I made a half batch and still had lots.  It's a hearty soup that's not only tasty, it's filling and sustains you.  It freezes really well.    It quickly made it to one of my favorite soups with the first bowlful!

A great savory soup. I made the recipe as instructed and got a solid result. I brought it to a church soup supper, and this soup MOVED!  I wouldn't say my audience consisted of vegans or kale freaks by a long shot, but good food is good food. This soup is neutral yet flavorful enough to appeal to varied tastes.

Loved this soup and it was easy to make for someone who doesn't cook often! Very tasty and is massive! Using a very large soup pot is best. The potatoes should definitely be added in after the onions and garlic instead of at the end. I only added 6 c. of water instead of the original 8 and it still had a lot of soup. I didn't have any vegetable bullion so the soup seemed a bit watery but adding some crushed red pepper helped that. Will certainly make again (after I finish this batch)!

My husband liked it more then I did and liked all the vegetables in it (I added some cauliflower, zucchini and red and yellow peppers since I had all of these on hand and it just didn't have that many vegetables in it for a vegetable soup). I also used a quart of vegetable stock instead of bouillon and added about 2 tsp. of lemon juice. 
Even will all that added and more spice then it called for it was just so so. Now I have a lot of soup left although I did freeze some of it.

Very good shoulder season soup!  Variations. . . used a mix of dried parsley, scallions and cutting celery in addition to stock.  (3-4 TBSP)  Subbed 32oz stock and 32oz canned tomatoes for 8c water.  Lawrys for salt.  Limas and garbanzos instead of cannelinis.

I really liked this recipe, but I never actually made it just as written. I used 2 cans of black eyed peas and one can of black beans, and a TON of kale. Carrots, onions, minced garlic, a couple bay leaves, and some other seasonings. Served with some cheddar cheese bc that is what I had in the fridge. Made a lot of soup.

Loved this, very tasty!! I was worried it would be too kale-y since a bunch seemed like an awful lot, but it was not. I used "Better Than Bouillon" vegetarian soup base, fresh parsley instead of dried (just because I already had it on hand) and added some radiatore noodles because I love noodles in everything, but it would have been very good without them as well.

Fantastic recipe! Quick and easy to prepare and with a wonderful flavor. I followed this exactly as-written and wouldn't change a thing. This recipe does indeed make a large batch. It overflowed the capacity of my 3.5 quart Dutch oven. You need a minimum 4-qt. capacity, preferably a bit larger. I love finding new ways to serve kale and will definitely keep this recipe in circulation. Thanks for sharing!

This is by far my favorite soup. I substitute sweet potatoes for the white potatoes but otherwise stick to the recipe. It’s delicious as leftovers and freezes well.

EXCELLENT SOUP!!
I only made a few minor changes, otherwise follow recipe as written.  I used 1 tbsp. olive oil instead of 2.  Used 2 containers of organic vegetable broth for the liquid.  Used organic purple petite potatoes and organic purple Kale.  Used 1 can organic canelli beans and 1 can organic mixed beans (canelli, kidney and black).  Thank you for posting ~ this will be one of my winter staples!

I use boxed broths or stock, chicken or vegetable, and I sweat the onions, potatoes, carrots, celery in butter, not oil, for added flavor and natural thickener -I don't like watery soups which lack flavor. No need to precook the kale, it will cook down during the simmer stage.

I made the recipe as written using six cups of V8 Juice and two cups of water instead of 8 cups of water and bouillon cubes. This is one of the best soups we have ever had. We topped it off with grated parmesan cheese and had some crunchy Italian bread with it. Everyone LOVED it. I will be making it often...yummy!!  I also want to mention that the woman who said her husband hated kale...maybe she could try some spinach in its place. I did one time and it was quite good.

I’m so glad I found this recipe. Easy and delicious. I used up some left over chicken broth I had in the fringe and a carton of vegetable broth I had in my pantry. I used the leftover black beans that I had from a previous taco night. It’s definitely a way to use of items in the refrigerator. I added carrots and a can of Italian seasoned diced tomatoes. Also I added some crushed red peppers. I drained and rinsed both the black beans and cannelloni beans, and simmered longer then it suggested for softer kale. I like that it was versatile.

I gave five stars but modified the recipe. I chose not to add the beans. The recipe is quite good with just potatoes, kale, garlic, onions, and tomato bits. I also added an extra teaspoon of Chicken Bouillon. Next time I will reduce the amount of water to six or seven cups. This soup freezes well and tastes even better warmed up. It's really important to remove kale stems and chop the kale quite well so it will saute and be soft.  Now I'm hungry!

This soup/recipe is amazing. I’ve just recently given up meat so I’m on the lookout for hearty, filling meals. I followed the recipe exactly and it was so delicious. When I reheated it the next day for dinner I added about 1/2 teaspoon of red pepper flakes to add some heat and that put it through the roof! So, so good!

I am going to a more plant based diet and looked for Kale recipes. This one looked appetizing and it is! You can add to this or leave it like the original recipe. I did not change any of the seasonings but I did add some chopped celery and sliced some baby carrots to add. I also only added about 5-6 baby potatoes because I had some leftover quinoa and added that too. This is definitely a keeper!

I did not make any changes to the ingredients and only cooked the soup for as long as it took the potatoes so soften to a consistency that I desired. I can see how cooking it too long would make the kale undesirable. Delicious and will be adding this as an easy go-to weekday meal.

I have made this recipe twice.  The first time, I made the original  recipe and really enjoyed it. It is very hearty and filling. The second time I made it, there were some things I tweaked to suit my preferences. I used sweet potatoes instead of white potatoes and instead of using six, I used three. I added celery and a bunch of green onions for added flavor and texture. I used a lot more kale also! I love kale but in the original recipe, the kale gets lost with all of the potatoes and beans. I also aded more fresh garlic than the recipe calls for and onion powder. It doesn't need any salt so just skip that. Love this soup. I think I have perfected to my liking now.

I used a pre cut/washed bag of kale, added carrots, and substituted garbanzo beans for the canellini. It was also very bland even with me initially doubling the garlic and onions. I added smoked paprika, and pink salt and black pepper as the soup simmered. Also 1 oz of veg broth, 4 cups water, with 2 veg boullion cubes. Delicious!

I used Better Than Bouillon vegetable instead of bouillon cubes and russet potatoes with the peels on.  I didn't have parsley on hand so it was omitted (oh well that's okay).  I'll probably make it again.  Great recipe thanks Donna B.

I added more tomatoes and herbs.  I pureed half the bean.  Added green beans, more stock base (for flavor).  Lastly, I added barley for that lovely grain taste.
Good basic start for soup.

I followed the recipe almost exactly (added a couple of small sage leaves)... as I was in a rush, I only made a few potatoes. It was excellent, and even better (albeit not vegan anymore) with some parmesan sprinkled over it.

Great vegetarian stew! Used a can of fire-roasted diced tomatoes, just one can of beans and added one can of corn along with some chopped carrots. Easy to make.

This recipe is so great! My husband and I started eating vegan a few months ago and love a good soup. We used red skin potatoes in place of the white potatoes and it was perfect! We also didn't skin them. So good!

Very fresh.  I added extra tomatoes, chickpeas, carrots and some grated turmeric.  Very tasty.

I like it better without the potatoes. If you keep them out you can freeze it and it reheats great! I recommend reserving half of the kale for after the liquid’s added so you still get some of that firmer texture.

my neighbor gave me kale from her garden, and I wasn't sure how to use it. I found this recipe and made it as written. It was very good. I sprinkled Parmesan cheese on top when serving it. My husband generally does not like vegetable soup, but he really liked this. Next yeR I will grow kale.

I had some produce from my CSA share, including a bunch of kale, and thought this would be a good recipe to utilise it.  The flavor was excellent!  I made one substitution, zucchini for the potatoes, worked great.

On subsequent occasions when I have had a good bunch of kale, I make and freeze this soup in individual portions.  I like the flexibility of the recipe, choosing whatever produce on hand to round it out.  I've also used kohlrabi, summer squash, and zucchini with or without the potatoes.  I upped the diced tomatoes to a 28 oz can or a quart jar of canned tomatoes, as well as using fresh parsley if I have it on hand.

The flavor of this soup is excellent.  Sprinkling some shredded parmesan or feta cheese on top is a nice touch!

This turned out much better than my "no-kale, tyvm" wife anticipated.  I followed the tip from another reviewer and used 8c of veggie broth vs. the recipe's cube ingredient, and also added 20 oz of ground turkey as well as one bay leaf.  Everything else followed recipe and the soup was very flavorful.

I like stews much more than soups, so I added barley (with the veg, but cook 45 minutes per the barley instructions) and left out most of the potatoes.  Also, added a sliced carrot when I added all the veg.  It was a huge hit at work today, so thank you!

I made this pretty much to a T.  But, instead of 8 cups of water and 6 bullion cubes I used 8 cups of low sodium vegetable broth and seasoned with salt to my liking.  Also, I added red pepper flakes for an added kick.

This is my new favorite soup! It was perfect, as is, and because the first batch turned out so well and was completely gone the next day, I made it again a couple of days later. I made two versions; the vegetarian version for me and the same recipe with ground Italian sausage for my meat-eating family. Totally hit the spot for everyone! Thank you!

Seemed like a good idea...but was ghastly salty. Used organic broth instead of bouillion, and added no salt. A splash of vinegar in my bowl made it barely edible. No idea why it came out so poorly. Will not repeat.

This is my first time trying this recipe. I did however add a few things to it so I wouldn't know how the original recipe taste like. I added some celery and carrots and at about 5 mins left i added (yes, might sound weird) 4 eggs for some added protein. I did forget to put the bouillon cubes in it but who needs the MSG, it's bad for you.  I very much enjoyed it and if you're into spicy try it with some hot sauce. I did and I enjoyed it even more.

Very good. I made a few changes based on what I had on hand. I used one large sweet potato instead of the white potatoes and it was excellent ( I halved the recipe). It gave it a slightly sweet taste which we loved. I also added chopped carrots, green beans and frozen peas. It seems  like a flexible recipe. Put in what you have on hand. I added a teaspoon of pesto at the end too. Very yummy. Thank you!

This soup is very easy to make. If your follow the recipe EXACTLY it’s perfect, however you can also choose to add extra veggies and or beans to mix it up a bit! I like to add some homemade dumplings. I make it the day before I want to enjoy it, so that the spices can really marinate in it and it also gives the kale more time to get tender when it sits overnight! I make and enjoy this soup whenever I’m breaking a lengthy water fast.

Was time consuming getting everything together and chopped up but worth it. I should've not added salt since we love adding our own sauce afterwards for spice. We use Sriracha and we all know it has enough salt in it when added to each of our bowls! Healthy dish. Suggestion: I would boil the potatoes separately next time and add it in the end. As this is the only veg. that takes the longest. Otherwise, you end up over-cooking the whole soup and the vibrant colours end up not there anymore and look dull and dark. My husband couldn't recognize what green veg. I used. I also added my cooked black kidney beans to the soup in the end. It was a very filling dish with non-salted crackers on the side. Plenty of leftovers for the next 3 days amongst two people.

This soup is great, especially on Day 2 when the flavors have a chance to blend. You might also want to add a couple Bay leaves to deepen the flavor. When you eat it the first day, it tastes a little watery, but it's still tasty.

A new household favourite, especially in wintertime!  We doubled the Italian seasoning and served the soup with a large spoonful of fresh gorgonzola cheese melted in the hot soup and mixed in!  WOW!  Next time we may leave out one potato.

I added carrots and a can of corn (drained) because I was short on potatoes.  I think the sweetness of these two ingredients helps offset the bitterness of the kale.  I also used some pesto because I didn't have basil, and had to make my own Italian seasoning (marjoram, rosemary, thyme, oregano, some herbs de provence), added three bay leaves and some celery seed.  I used fresh parsley and some fresh cilantro, mostly so they wouldn't go to waste (I had them for other recipes).  It was delicious!  Big hit with my husband.  We had it with some rosemary focaccia (Moosewood Cookbook recipe).

I made half the recipe and used vegetable  stock instead of boullion cubes. Im not a vegan but wanted to try something different. Sorry to say I caved and added cheese tortellini in place of potatoes. Made it much better and more hearty. Although I halved all the ingredients I kept seasonings the same amount.

All the family loved it a lot (3 yo, 5 yo and husband). And Kale is such a nutritious vegetable so that is a super easy way to make them eat it! I replace the potato by barcley for a complete meal in a soup! Also there is not a lot of vegetables to cut so that is one fast soup to do that I will definitely do often!

It's a great starting point! I felt it the broth was too bland, so I doubled the Italian seasoning and added a tsp of garlic powder as well as a tsp of cumin. Salt was unnecessary for me, since I'm not crazy about salt. But anyone can make this into a great soup with whatever flavor pallet they have! All of the veggies worked very well together, too.

I love this recipe and have been tweaking it for a couple of years. My way takes longer but sure tastes better to me. First I sautée onions and garlic in EVOO, then add can of diced tomatoes with juice and cook all together add salt. Remove to large dish and cover. Then I sautée the kale in EVOO and salt and then cook it down in chicken broth for about 15 minutes (because I like my kale cooked this way). Add kale to onion & tomato mix and cover. (BTW, this makes a delicious dish just as it is!) Boil potatoes and shoestring carrots in water and chicken broth (instead of vegetable bullion) for 10 minutes. Add the kale & tomatoes and homemade white beans. *Also, in the past for extra depth I have added a piece of Parmesan cheese rind which silken and riches it up!

During a recent fast I looked for a recipe that was both delicious and quick... Found it! Not only is this recipe quick and delicious It's easy to make and healthy. My wife loved this dish so much she had two servings. This recipe is very forgiving, too! If you want to change or add ingredients (instead of running to the store) you can do that without changing the overall flavor. I didn't have cannellini beans so I used garbanzo beans instead. I suggest that everyone try the original recipe and branch out from that.

Made this for a light supper, served with garlic toast.
Used red kale instead of green.
Have enough leftover soup for hubby to take for lunch tomorrow,and will see how well it keeps for  Sunday supper.
Will definitely make this again.

Awesome recipe just as it is.  I made it for my husband and myself so cut recipe in half and it still yields 3-4 bowls each.  The only change I made was the addition of a bayleaf.  Next time I would add the cubed potatoes 1/2 way through the cooking time as they were quite soft. I have saved the recipe and will make it again!

I didn't have the regular diced tomatoes so I used a can of Rotel diced tomatoes and green chilies and my husband said he loved it. Oh, I also stir fried some chicken pieces first, then with the onion and garlic

This is a delicious hearty and very healthy soup. The only changes I made were these:
I didn't have dried parsley but I had fresh so I used that in the soup and then some to garnish which was delicious. Also, I had 2 regular potatoes and 2 sweet potatoes so I combined and used both. The sweet potato and kale went really nicely together. I also used TJ's free range chicken broth instead of bouillon.  
All in all a great recipe! My 12 yr old loved it; even wanted it in her lunch for school! Makes a big batch. Was able to freeze some and have enough for leftovers . Will definitely make again! Thanks for the great recipe!

I love this soup. Delicious. I only had collard greens on hand & I used those instead of the kale.  I also only used 4 bullion veggie cubes & 2 cups of homemade veggie stock I had. + 6 cups water. I also added 4 chopped carrots & some cauliflower I wanted to use up. I made up the Italian seasoning using Marjoram, Oregano, Rosemary, Sage, & Thyme, a half tsp of each one. Finished off with a small amount of Celtic sale & fresh ground black pepper. This is an excellent recipe & quick to make also.

Loved it!  Yes, I will make t again.  Next time, I'm going to use three potatoes, a cup of carrots and a cup of cauliflower so there's a little less starch.  I made the recipe as is with one change:  4 cups of low sodium chicken stock and 4 cups of water with two cubes of vegetable bouillon.  I also used fresh parsley as that's what I had on hand.  Delicious!  Definitely, a keeper.

Without the changes this is a 3 star. I  substituted chicken broth for the water and omitted the bouillon. Added shredded carrots and spicy sausage Lots of Italian seasoning. With these changes I would give it a 4-5 star rating. Otherwise it is bland and boring. Also, the kale needs to cook much longer than stated.

Used boxed vegetarian broth and eliminated cubed bouillon and water.  Use a large pot as this makes a lot of soup.  Reheats well.  Simple directions.  Uses only one pot!

The soup was delicious. Instead of water I used vegetable broth. I didn't have enough potatoes so I supplemented the difference remaining with chopped carrots. Other than that I followed the recipe  exactly  end it was heartier than I expected. Even my 12-year-old son who is a meat and potatoes lover loved the soup! Will definitely be making it again.

This soup looks, smells, and tastes great! I used 3 extra large Knorr vegetable bouillon cubes (instead of six) and didn't need to add salt.  It is good with or without the parsley.  Cleaning and chopping the kale was the hardest part.  It is an easy soup to make and the perfect soup for a cold rainy day!

I liked the ease of this recipe as a way to use up some kale. I omitted the veg bouillon (and water) since I made my own vegetable stock--just added more salt/pepper since homemade stock does not typically contain salt. I added the kale towards the end of cooking since I felt 25 minutes would be far too long. Otherwise, made the recipe as is. I liked the soup, but didn't care for the kale. However, I'm not a huge fan of kale as it is and prefer spinach. Overall, good soup to make and will be made again when I have some kale to use up. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I made this soup to eat over the course of a couple of days. It was delicious.  I am going to make more for a few members of my family soon!  One thing I will do differently, IF I intend to have it for left overs, is add the kale as needed per serving vs adding to the full pot. This way, the male can remain more intact.  Thanks for this recipe!

I made this in my pressure cooker with dried beans. Put  beans, onion, garlic,  tomato paste , seasoning,  4 cups chicken broth and 4 cups water .  brought to pressure and cooked  35 min.  I then added the potato, diced tomato and kale and brought back to pressure for 5 min.  Excellent soup, with great taste!  I will defiantly be making this again,  thanks for sharing!

Amazing soup!  Made it with green onions and garlic infused olive oil due to my partner having a fructan allergy.  Prep was quick and the soup is delicious.  Makes a ton!  Meals for the weekend! :)

I make my own beans instead of using canned.  I usually add a little extra kale and chop it into small pieces.  I've made it with vegetable bouillon and with chicken bouillon.  Excellent soup!  Very hearty and filling.  Great with crusty bread.

I give this four stars only because I made a few of changes (I don't like 5 star ratings when the recipe has been changed). I used butternut squash instead of potatoes because I had some fresh and I used herbs de Provence because I didn't have any Italian seasoning. I also added a dash or two of cayenne pepper since we like a bit of kick.  This is a wonderful soup and I will definitely make it again and try using some different spices for variety.

Delicious and healthy soup!  I didn't have any boullion cubes so substituted low sodium chicken broth.  Reduced beans. Next time I will try russet potatoes to have them break down and crumble a bit.  Also added a few dashes of cayenne, and some garlic powder... Yummy served with a mount of grated old cheddar on top!  Will definitely make again.

We made two of these, one vegetarian and one with sausage, for a church function.  Both were delicious and (bonus!) fairly cheap to make.  What I loved is that the vegetarian version was still quite hearty.  Both got rave reviews.

Amazing! Since I read that it made so much, I split it in two pots. One had Italian sausage and the other vegetarian. I didn't have bullion cubes so for the vegetarian one I used Lipton onion mix. The sausage one I used chicken bullion. They were both delicious!!

I made a half recipe and made a few changes based on other reviews. Added about 1/2- 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 bay leaf and a generous amount of celery salt. I didn't have Italian seasoning so I used oregano, basil, rosemary and thyme. Halved the parsley. I used about 4 cups (remember it's half recipe) of chopped kale and felt it could have used more. Used double the amount of tomatoes: a can of diced tomato with basil garlic and oregano- no salt. Cook with everything except potatoes and beans for 25 min then added potatoes and beans and cooked 45 min more.
I happened to have corn leftover so I gave it a quick roast and threw that in at the end and served with Parm and fresh parsley. The fresh parsley gave it the fresh pop I felt was missing. Tasted great!
Will definitely make again, probably with celery and more kale

Thank you for posting such a hearty and healthy recipe!  I admit I was hesitant to try this but with so many good comments about this dish I took the plunge.  As many others did, I used veggie broth instead of granules and added some of my left over veggie water to total 72 oz. of liquid.  I used just 1/2 can of beans (family hates them), just 3 small red potatoes unpeeled and 2 medium-sized carrots.  No extra salt and just 1 table of dried parsley.  Paired with a good bread this is a meal!
My only suggestion is to be more clear on how much kale to use....I guessed at the quantity and over did it a bit.

This soup was very good, and a nice use of Kale. I have it growing in my garden and always looking for good ideas. I did change it up a bit and added mini turkey meatballs which I made from ground turkey with salt and pepper to taste. It turned out very good very much like Italian wedding soup and everyone in my family enjoyed it. Thanks

Awesome recipe! You can throw whatever you want into this soup. I added broccoli, cilantro, fresh parsley, and a few different kinds of potatoes. Next time I will use Great Northern Beans instead of Cannelini beans.

I followed the advice of another reviewer and reduced the parsley to 1 tbsp and added a bay leaf. I actually made it non-vegetarian by adding 1 lb hot Italian turkey sausage, removed from the casings, and browned as ground meat before adding it with the potatoes and beans. I increased the water by 2 cups because of the extra bulk. I also used skin on red potatoes and stewed tomatoes instead of diced. It's delicious and I'd definitely make it again.

I've made it twice so far. It's delicious. My husband loved it and he is NOT a fan of kale. I found it fairly easy to prepare and it's easy to adjust. It's healthy and if you want to use less bouillon cubes, do so, simply start off with 4 cups, taste as you go and  add more hot water or bouillon if you need. Thank you for sharing. Will be making it very often!

A great soup with lots of flavor.  I used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth and it was very savory.  I also used a tablespoon of basil and oregano instead of the one tablespoon of Italian Seasoning.  I swapped russet potatoes for the white potatoes.  It was great with slices of french bread.

This was JUST what I needed!  Simple, delicious, healthy and hard to mess up. I cut the recipe in half, only added one large potato, diced, and kind of threw in stuff I had on hand to make the flavor as I like it - some chopped carrots, a splash of white wine, a cup of dried 12 bean mix, additional seasonings and several cloves of garlic.

I read some of the reviews, so I "tweeked" it a little too.  I decided to simmer the kale for 30 minutes & then add the potatoes & cook until the potatoes were done. The kale was nice & soft, not tough at all. Also, I added some oregano, basil leaves, thyme & a bay leaf because I didn't have any Italian seasoning. Low sodium chicken broth with water was used along with home canned tomatoes. At the end, I seasoned 2 small chicken breasts brushed with olive oil & sprinkled with poultry seasoning & thyme, then seared them, cut them up & added to the soup. Next time I may add some orzo.  It was very good & we both had seconds.

Love this soup. We had to leave out the bouillon cubes because we did not have any but the soup still came out very good!

This was delicious and my husband loved it!  Made it for friends News Years day with veggie sandwiches and they  loved it!  Will keep this one and make it more often, maybe for potluck at church.  Would be easy to double or triple the recipe.

Very good soup. Didn't end up adding salt or pepper because I thought it had enough flavor already. Next time I will halve the recipe, as this time I had to finish making it in a 14'' wok, because my soup pot turned out to be too small. Hopefully that will make it also cook faster. It took over 45 minutes for the potatoes (I used 4 gold potatoes) to soften.

Small change due to diet...I did not use any oil ...used high temp sauce pan to flash cook the onion and garlic...the rest was the same and delicious.  It made enough to freeze some and even after freezing it was delicious when heated up.  I will absolutely make this again.

I agree with Donna B., this soup is wonderful, in fact it's the best vegetable soup I've ever tasted thus far, no exaggeration.

I didn't have any cannellini beans so I used canned red kidney beans, and at my wifes suggestion I added a couple of carrots & 1/2 cup celery chopped.  Didn't have any  bouillon cubes but found some "Rachael Ray stock in a box", to replace half the water, that was it.

The soup was absolutely perfect, & surprisingly didn't even need added salt or pepper.  Yum!

I made this for my daughter who is a vegan. I used veggie broth that I had made & added bay leaves. I also used 2 cans of potatoes that I diced & one jar of tomato paste. It turned out great!

Absolutely delicious! My entire family loved it. This soup is hearty and filling. I wasn't expecting the recipe to yield such a large quantity, but I'm glad it did because it tastes even better the second day after the flavors have marinated. It uses inexpensive ingredients that I often have on hand. This one is a keeper.

So easy and cheap to make!!! And really easy to tweak (my pot was too small so use a stockpot if you have one!!!). I used red skins and carrots and it tastes amazing. Thanks for the recipe!

Sauteed the veggies quite a while (15-20 mins) before adding water and "better than bouillon".  Even my husband raved about it.  This will be a new regular for us.

This is delicious and very healthy!  I added sausage and swapped the potatoes for orzo.  Keeping with the low sodium, I just added cracked black pepper upon serving.  Nice hearty soup for a chilly day!

This is an excellent recipe. I would highly recommend it to anyone, especially vegetarians looking for a delicious cool-weather, iron-rich, hearty soup. I served it to my boyfriend, our friend, Andrew, and myself last night, me being the vegetarian and them being the flexitarians, if you will. By the end of the meal, they asked if I could make more next time because it went quickly ;)

The things I did just a little different were using 8 cups of vegetable broth, adding 3 bay leaves, sprinkling in some chili powder and adding garlic pepper and celery salt. I would recommend low-sodium broth. It's better to add salt than to find the soup too salty, in my opinion.

This recipe is a keeper!

Wonderful and hearty. I used 2 sweet potatoes and 1 russet rather than the 6 white potatoes, extra kale, more of the Italian seasoning and added red pepper flakes , a splash of red wine and some lemon  juice, (just before serving). I used unsalted organic vegetable/ vegetarian chicken broth ( in the boxes) instead of bullion. A very comforting soup to see me through a nasty virus

This soup was only OK. I used a fancy msg free and low sodium bullion so perhaps that was the issue, but I found it generally lacking flavour. It improved somewhat with the addition of some acidic ingredients (mostly sherry vinegar) but it wasn't thrilling.

I used chicken bouillon instead of veg because that's what I had on hand.  And I used crushed tomatoes instead of diced...this changed it into more of a hearty tomato soup.  Very good, and flavors blended and improved when re-heated as leftover.

A great start, but dropped a star due to the bouillon cubes. Those things are nasty. Either make your own stock, buy the liquid stock, low sodium if available, or use a condensed base (in that order of preference). Also, there is a much better known name for this soup: MINESTRONE!

Only thing that saved it was an added sausage (I know not veg but usually I don't have any issues with meatless recipes).

Hi- I'd just like to say that this recipe needs to be a little more tomatoey.  And as long as you finish with enough salt, it's really tasty and good!  What I did was add a jar of pasta sauce to the recipe.  It turned out really good with the extra tomato-ness. I also had to use vegetable broth because I couldn't find vegetable boullion cubes.  My neighbor had a ton of kale from his garden so this soup is what I did with the big old bag of it that he gave us.  And you can really use a ton of kale because it cooks right down. I had a big mixing bowl full to the top with kale and it reduced to less than 1/4 its size. Great soup, I'll do it again I'm sure.

Great, but was a little bland initially for our taste at first.  Added lime and red vinegar, and was improved immensely and tasted great.

Easy to make and overall it has a good taste. I tried this because it is what I had in my fridge and because I am trying to eat healthier. When I ate it the first night it seemed bland, but the second day for leftovers it was able to really mix the flavors over night and tasted much better.

I used  vegetable stock instead of bouillon cubes and used on three potatoes. My daughter who is not a fan of soups or kale,  had seconds. 
This recipe is a keeper. Will definitely use it again.

I really liked this dish! I substituted turnips for the potatoes to cut out some carbs, and it was delicious! If you use the big purple turnips make sure you peel then first because the skins can be bitter. That was the only change I made. Great soup. Use a really big pot! I think ham or bacon/pancetta would be a great addition to this soup.

This soup is hearty and delicious.  Most folks who don't like kale will love this soup I swear.  I didn't have potatoes on hand so I used pasta-any kind is fine, toward the last 10 minutes or so.  I like to serve this soup with some great hard crusty bread on a winter's night.  I have shared this recipe with many and all love it.

What a GREAT recipe!  My whole family loved it!  The only change I made was to add an additional box of vegetable broth, as it seemed to need a little more liquid.  I didn't really expect to like this as much as I did, but the flavor was fantastic!

I really liked this recipe.  I tweaked it a little bit by leaving out the potatoes and adding chopped butternut squash, carrots, celery and chicken.  It made a huge amount of soup and was very tasty! 5 stars!

My husband and I love kale, and we're always looking for new ways to eat it.  This soup was a big hit with us both!   I found that it worked with vegetable broth, since we had that on hand (but no bullion cubes).   For the meat eaters, it works with chicken broth, too.

I really think the most important ingredients are vegetable bouillon, olive oil, garlic, and onions. For the rest of the ingredients I usually put whatever I have in my fridge. Like this time, I added sweet potato, spinach, and also egg flower(kinda like Chinese style) It was soooooo good! Anyways, this is a nice and easy recipe for sure.

Okay, so, I got to the point of putting in the diced tomatoes and realized I had forgotten them. All I had was a can of rotel tomatoes and I was wondering if that was going to turn this into the most insane soup ever, but actually it is AWESOME. I'm not vegan but I do go vegan from time to time and I don't normally enjoy the vegan recipes I make, but this one is a winner. LOVE it.

This was my first time using Kale, my family and I loved it!( Vegheads and non-Vegheads) I have already made it a few times. Only thing different I did was I put the potatoes in after I cooked the onion and garlic. Once potatoes cooked for a few minutes I added the kale and followed the recipe.Loved it! Thank you!!

I left out the potatoes and only used a can of lentils and canned Aylmer Accents diced tomatoes Olive Oil and Garlic...I highly recommend eating it on day 2..it has alot of dried seasoning that is better as it sits.

Delicious soup. Helps to massage the kale a bit (like you would before using it in a salad)prior to putting it in the soup, makes the kale more tender.

I've been looking for a good Kale soup for some time now. This is prrrrfect in my opinion!!! ;-) I used pre-packaged organic chicken stock. I also added a bit less potato's to keep the carbs and calories down.

This was very tasty.  I made it pretty much exactly as written.  Very nice on a cold icy winter night!

This was great we are really enjoying it!  When I added the herbs (I did not have an Italian seasoning blend so I added dried basil and oregano) I remembered that I had some parmesan rinds in my freezer so I added them. I also diced up a couple of carrots and added them. It kind of reminds me of minestrone.

I really enjoyed this hearty soup and it certainly hit the spot for this chilly New England weather! I did change a few things: I used sweet potatoes instead of white, small, one can of cannelloni and one can of small, red beans, and a few sprinkles of crushed red pepper to add some spice! As suggested,  I also left it cooking much longer than suggested (almost double the time). I think next time, I will use vegetable broth rather than the bouillon cubes.

This soup is soooo good!! I didn't add the beans or tomatoes (not a fan) and added a little more dried minced garlic and onion powder at the end. The base was still very flavorful and rich. One of the best soups i've ever had! 10/10

This recipe is phenomenal. We have made it several times and everyone loves it. My 11 year old is newly vegan and this is his favorite (with a crusty baguette). Make it exactly as indicated (I have subbed other beans but cannelini beans are best). Thank you for such a wonderful vegan recipe. Also, it saves and freezes well.

This was delicious! I used what I had on hand - red & yukon gold potatoes, chicken bouillon, some minced jalapeño for a little kick, a can of chickpeas, and some fresh spinach in addition to kale. The spices were perfect; I didn't even need to add salt or pepper. Seems like this recipe would be wonderful on its own but it's also easy to customize based on taste and what you've got in stock. Will definitely make again!

I followed the recipe almost exactly and I found it watery and bland. I used organ veg broth in cartons, 8 cups as the recipe says. I won't make this again.

I LOVED it.! I was looking for something that reminded me of my mom's Kale soup. When I was young, Kale from the garden was brought in for this soup and my job was to finger through all those curley edges to remove the little worms. Took forEVAH! (at least from a ten Y O's viewpoint) I was NEVER going to make Kale soup as an adult when I had choices. Oh Well. I was also never going to say, "do it because I said so" -anyway- recipe exact, except I replace the potatoes with 6 large, scrubbed (not peeled) parsnips. HEAVENLY!

A nice, light soup on a chilly winter day.  I used thinly sliced sweet potatoes and vegetable stock instead of the regular potatoes and bouillon. I also added a half teaspoon of red pepper flakes.

Really good and very healthy....I only used one potato because I didnt want all the starch and carbs.....I also used a quart jar of homemade diced tomatoes that were made on the spicy side with a jalapeno that someone had made me from their garden. Thanks!

Wonderful soup!  Loved it!  Will definitely make again.  I did however slightly blend the soup (not to the point of pureed) which gave it a better consistency overall while retaining all the flavor.  I also left out the cannellini beans.

SO GOOD! Use a LARGE pot though. My pot was too small and so I had to sacrifice 1 can of beans and bail out a bunch of broth to add back in later. Also, I used canned diced "Italian style" tomatoes which helped with the flavor tons. Simple and delicious!

I used beet greens instead of kale and can confirm that this soup is great regardless of the greens used. I added carrots for color and nutrition and I think it was an improvement. Otherwise followed closely. Yum!

This was so good.  I just suddenly had a craving for potato-Kale soup and found this recipe.  I used just one can of beans though, and a large can of crushed tomatoes.  Used the immersion blender to smooth it out somewhat but left some chunks.

Just made this tonight, the eight cups of water with bouillon wasn't enough for me. It made it it too much like a stew.  I like my soups with more stock (thinner); if you are like me then double up on the eight cups plus bouillon.  Add some white pepper (to taste) for a little warmth, I sub out the cannellini beans for black eye peas.
