We absolutely loved this recipe once we realised that the cooking time is wrong. It should read roast for 30 minutes per pound (NOT PER HALF POUND)

I made this recently so we could decide if we wanted to have it for Thanksgiving.  It came out GREAT.  (Cooked it 30 minutes per lb. not 30 minutes per 1/2 lb.)  We have decided to have it for Thanksgiving.  So moist and flavorful.

This was really incredible.  I paused several times when I noticed there was no salt in the ingredients, and I had serious doubts about how that would go over...  I was so pleasantly surprised!  the taste is wonderful. You can appreciate the true taste of the duck, and the rosemary was just the icing on the cake.  I used a large Mulard Duck Breast, and adjusted the recipe down to 2 servings. Warning, be careful when adjusting the recipe, because the actual preparation instructions include quantities that correspond to the amount of servings in the original recipe. No harm really, you may just have leftover rub or sherry that you won't use.  GREAT, GREAT, GREAT (at least to me anyway :-)    Thanks for sharing!

My husband and I loved this recipe! This was my first go at roasting a duck and I was very impressed with how it turned out. Was great with asparagus.

This recipe was Amazing!  We prepared it for New Years. At first I was skeptical of the Sheri....but that's what made it GREAT.  I did rub salt on the outside and inside per another reviewer's advice. VERY Flavorful. Yummmm

An okay recipe that I probably won't make again...just too fatty.  I like duck, but I think I'll stick with breasts.

I made this for my FIRST at home Christmas dinner with all of my family here.  Everyone was skeptical of me changing up the traditional ham, but they all loved it.  Next year I will have more than one to make sure everyone gets a good taste!

Be advised before trying this recipe that the cooking time is very wrong. It should be 30 minutes per POUND, not per half-pound. A four-pound duck would be done in about 2 hours. If you roast the duck according to the recipe, you will end up with charcoal. My 5 1/2 lb. duck was done in just under 3 hours. I did need to add water to the roasting pan after the first two hours to prevent burning. This was the first duck I ever prepared. It was okay, but I probably won't make this again. Nothing personal - I guess I'm just not much of a duck fan. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Delicious! I only cooked my 5 1/2 lb duck for 2 hours and it was plenty well-cooked. I basted often with the sherry mixture and the pan sauce was fabulous! Like a sauce from an upscale restaurant. I was afraid the sherry would overwhelm the flavor, but it was rich and delicious. Hubby was totally impressed. It was our Thanksgiving dinner along with roasted potatoes and Roasted Garlic Cauliflower from this site. So elegant!

I marinated the duck in Vermouth instead of Sherry because that's what I had on hand. Then I used fresh herbs for the rub. It was absolutely fantastic. A big hit for Christmas dinner. And it was so quick I'd use the recipe for duck breasts on a week night.

FAN-TASTIC! original cooking time is right, but I backed the temperature off to about 275 and slow roasted the duck for 30min per 1/2lb.   DELICIOUS. If you poke through the skin with the baster and inject the juices into the meat itself, the duck will stay moist in the fridge for almost a week as well!   WILL make this again

This was great!  I made it for New Year's and we all enjoyed it (even the kids).  It was so moist and the sherry added a different flavor to it.  I was happy that I looked at the other reviews and saw the change in directions/cooking time.  My 6 pound duck took 2hrs 45 minutes.  I also took the advice of serving it with asparagus.  I also made baked sweet potatoes with it.  I think we all have a new favorite meal.  I will definitely make this again.

Absolutely loved it! Had guests and was quite nervous but was great! As others said was 30 mins per lb and actually I have a fan assisted oven so took it out about 20 mins early I used the giblets to make a gravy and deglazed the cooking pan with white wine and added to gravy went down very well and none left!

Other reviewers are right, it's roast 30 min. per pound.  I just did that automatically and never noticed it was written differently.  I pulled this recipe in 2006 before AllRecipes included photos.  I've only made it 3 times.  We don't eat duck often, obviously, but I do recommend this recipe.

I tried this for the first time tonight, and I found the recipe very good.  I thought the sherry definitely added a nice touch, although due to time constraints I could only let the duck marinate for roughly 4 hours.

I also chose to stuff the cavity with chopped onion, celery, and carrots in the more traditional manner primarily for added flavor.

I did try to make a gravy out of the pan liquid and drippings, and was not entirely successful.  The abundance of spices hindered that effort.

All in all I found this a very good recipe.

My family LOVES this simple, yet delicious recipe. The duck comes out juicy and flavorful, while the skin is perfectly crispy and decadent. We make this duck dish for Thanksgiving and Christmas every year.  Our little boys love this duck so much, we're actually making 2 this year so we'll be sure to have plenty of left-overs.

Very tasty recipe and surprisingly easy to follow! I’m a novice at cooking and was nervous to take this on... expensive dish that could have gone wrong FAST! Cooking time for my 6lb duck was about 2 hours, 40 minutes. Everyone enjoyed this meal... due to cost, it won’t be soon before I make this again but DEFINITELY will again! Delicious!!!

I made this for Christmas Eve dinner.  The duck was extremely tender, but I expected more flavor.  It was good, not great.  I was hoping for something with more "wow."  Roasting for 30 minutes per pound was just right, but my duck was browning too quickly and I had to cover it halfway through.

At 30 mins per lb (NOT 1/2 lb), this has become our holiday staple meal, with stuffing inside the bird and gravy from the drippings.  Very rich and delicious!

This has to be one of my favorite recipes ever, we ran out of dried rosemary so we doubled the oregano, and then used the basil. It was awesome. I can't wait to make this again. The soaking in Sherry really does the trick.
