I did a 1/4 tsp crushed chilli flakes in the turkey because my family doesnâ€™t like too much spice.  It was very good and I will make it again!

I would never have guessed this had squash in it! It added a sweet touch that perfectly melded with the tangy sauce. I was also surprised to discover that the turkey tasted just as good as beef.  Healthy *and* delicious. A perfect combo!

This was a refreshing change from regular everyday lasagna. There was a natural sweetness that just elevated all the flavors. 
This will be my new everyday go to lasagna.
