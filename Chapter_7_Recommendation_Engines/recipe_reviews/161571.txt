I am currently addicted to Starbucks' Orange Mango Banana Vivanno smoothie, but all the stores in my area are out of them so I decided to see if I could find a replacement! I'm so happy I did because this is EVEN BETTER! This is an incredibly delicious, flavorful drink, chock full o' vitamins and nutrients. I will definitely be making this very often! Thank you so much for posting this delicious, healthy, and simple recipe.

This is a great basic smoothie recipe.  Good fresh taste that isn't too sweet.  I also used orange juice since I didn't have orange-mango, and it tasted really good anyway.

I didn't have any plain yogurt so I used strawberry and also used plain orange juice. It came out awesome! Even kiddo liked it:)

Great smoothie!  The banana and yogurt make it so smooth and the mango flavor is really prominent.  I also love that it doesn't require ice since it seems we never have any on hand.

This was creamy, smooth, refreshing, tasty and a delightfully attractive color.  Still, Hubs was more enthusiastic about this than I was.  I actually did have orange-mango juice on hand, and used a lot more mango than called for as well. In spite of that, however, the banana flavor definitely was the more prominent, the mango taking a back seat.  It didn’t make this bad, just disappointing given its title, “Mango-Banana Smoothie” (perhaps it should be the other way around, “Banana-Mango Smoothie”).  Hubs agreed it was more banana tasting than mango, but said he didn’t mind.  He said it was “just right sweet,” but I did add a smidge of Splenda and used vanilla yogurt.

Very tasty.  The plain yogurt keeps it from being too sweet.  I didn't have orange-mango juice so I used regular orange juice and it was very good.  It would probably  be even better with orange-mango.  Simple, healthy and refreshing.

This was so creamy and thick like a milkshake. We had a few fresh mangos laying around to use up. I added almond milk and left out the OJ. I will definatly make this again.

This is good. I didn't have the juice, so I used skim milk. I always add cottage cheese to make my smoothies creamy and I added protein powder.

Great smoothie. I didn't have any orange or mango juice, so I used apple juice instead. To add some protein I also added some vanilla protein supplement.

Excellent recipe! Thanks. I also edited it a bit: added 1/2 a lime instead of orange-mango juice as well as a tad more yogurt...maybe 1/2 to 2/3 cup. Lime really adds nice zest to it.

Tastes good, very thick and creamy, but 1 serving is a very small portion. I'm trying to find a smoothie that will fill me up.

I followed the recipe exactly and I'm glad I did. This is a delicious combination for a flavor that is perfectly satisfying and refreshing, without being overwhelmingly sweet. I love that there's no ice or sugar added to this! Thanks Sixx!

Excellent morning drink!  Even my husband liked it and he is not a smoothie drinker.  I used fresh mango that needed to be eaten and added ice.  Will make again!

Loved this Recipe! I had no yogurt on me at the time and used an entire fresh mango with a large banana and some juice and crushed ice. It was delicious and all the flavors worked together very well. Definitely fills your stomach!

I liked the creamy smooth texture of this smoothie. Most smoothies are more like frozen slushies. I would use vanilla yogurt next time as the plain yogurt is much more tart. I found the mango flavor got lost, but it was a very yummy orange banana smoothie. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

This smoothie was refreshing and filling. I cut up a fresh mango and froze it for the mango pieces, which made the smoothie even sweeter. No sugar was needed, which is a healthful bonus.

omg, so good.  Used one fresh banana one fresh mango (fist time i have never bought and used one) waited a day for the mango to be a bit soft.  I washed and half peeled the mango.  I added a wopping tablespoon of great value vanilla yogurt and, I dunno, a 1/4 cup dole orange peach mango juice.  Also about a handful and a half of ice.  I will always have these ingredients in my home from now on.  Of course I am sipping on my smoothie as I type :D

Really good.  I used fat free vanilla yogurt and mango juice without the OJ.  I added a bit of honey to add some sweetness.  I found some low fat mango yogurt at my grocery store so will try that next time I make it.

Great easy to make smoothie! Perfect mix of both mango and banana. The only chnage I made was I used one packet (1/2 Cup) frozen mango puree which Trader joes sells in the frozen food section.

I had planned to make this and bought the mango-orange juice and then realized I forgot the mango! So, I subbed a peach for that. The taste was fine, I just prefer an icier and slightly sweeter smoothie. So, I added 6 ice cubes, a packet of Truvia, and a couple of drops of vanilla for a little extra flavor. I will pick up a mango and try it, with that, again. ty

My husband fell in love with these. He is a fruit fanatic. I couldn't find orange-mango juice so I used mango-peach. It was terrific. I took a picture after I had drank some. I just couldn't wait. It was just what i needed after a 30 minute run.

I think I would add some strawberries- or something- anything to give it a little color. But it was yummy. It just seemed to be missing something.

This is quite good. Was expecting it to taste somewhat like Starbucks, but I believe they use milk, not yogurt, so this one has the thick yogurt base. Very good, simple and healthy!

Delicious.  I used a couple fresh mangos and a large frozen banana. Added pineapple juice instead of orange and a full cup plain yogurt.  This makes far more than I need for a serving but I LOVE it frozen.  Pour extra into two-ounce paper cups and freeze. Wonderful 'frozen-fruit' treats.

add some protien powder to your smoothie. That will fill you up even in one serving. I find vanilla to be very complimentary to the other flavors

This was great. I made it twice and loved them both - first one as written, second with no banana and I used HD vanilla honey and granola frozen yogurt instead of the plain yogurt.  Very different, but also fantastic!

No changes, my Mango was not ripe enough but it still turned out good. Was a little sweet for me I will probably modify it next time but it was good.

This smoothie is very good and I love the fact it doesn't have added sugar.  I made it just as it is written and used a Vitamix on the Smoothie setting.  Delicious!  Will definitely be making again and again. Thank you for posting this!

Easy to make. Fantastic taste and texture. Well balanced blend of mango and banana flavors. Using frozen mango chunks adds cool refreshment. I added 1 Tbs agave to balance the Fage Plain 2% yogurt. I doubled the recipe and used a Vitamix on Smoothie setting. I will consider this recipe as a base “stock” for other smoothie recipes with fruit or veggie add-ins.

My favorite smoothie. Instead of orange juice I use coconut water and add hemp protein but this makes the color less fun.  I like to use frozen bananas and mango for texture. My kids love it and sometimes I add fish oil- kids liquid - to it which is the only way I can get them to take it..

Great base recipe. I used frozen banana and mango. I didn't have any juice so I substituted unsweetened almond milk.  I used fat & sugerfree vanilla yogurt.  I was a bit sweet for me but then I added a handful of spinach and that made it perfect with the added benefit of getting some of the spinach nutrients.  I think this would also be good with strawberries

Very tasty.  Just made this for my son who had his wisdom teeth removed.  The only changes I made were that I doubled the mango and used WF Orange Peach Mango juice as that is all I had.  Will definitely make again.

It tastes great, almost like a real product that wasn't homemade. There was no sugar needed and I had frozen yogurt instead of mango and it still tasted delicious.

Just made it this morning. I couldn't find the Orange-Mango juice blend. So, instead I used Dole's Orange-Peach-Mango juice blend and it tastes FANTASTIC! Also, an added bonus was that it has a natural sweetness. My mornings are going to start off well from now on ^_^.

Super easy, and I like that ice isn't needed. I loved the taste, but my 7 year old daughter didn't like it as much, being it's not loaded in sugar. I still give it 5 stars when comparing it to other healthy smoothies. I will definitely make this again.

Excellent! My husband and I love this smoothie. We make it exactly as the recipe says and it is SO good! You can really taste both the mango and banana. I've even seen my son sneak a few drinks.

Great recipe.  I added a combination of pineapple juice and fresh squeezed orange juice.  The kids liked the pudding-like texture and asked me to make it again.
