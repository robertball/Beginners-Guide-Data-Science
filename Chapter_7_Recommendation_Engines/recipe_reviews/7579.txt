I put the softened apricots in the blender along with the gelatin. Then took it out and folded it into whipped cream. Wonderful! I used this filling recipe to frost and fill the Boscobel Beach Ginger Cake also on this site. Made a second cake for my fav charity's first ever CAKE AUCTION! The crowd loved it. The cake made $44.00 for our auction. Thanks so much, Carol.

I followed this recipe as submitted.  It is OK, but nothing special.
