I've made this one several times now. I often have leftover bananas and I needed a recipe where I could use up my raw milk once it soured. This fit the bill perfectly. I use coconut oil in place of applesauce. I usually do two cups of whole wheat flour. I also like adding choc chips or nuts. I always throw in some extra flax seed meal, chia seeds or hemp seeds. I also add cinnamon and nutmeg. I add a bit of oatmeal and sugar to the top of each muffin before baking. These are a great treat for new moms, as the oats are great boosters for milk production and they can hold them with one hand while nursing. The extra seeds add protein and other nutrients. Awesome!

1.27.14 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/234197/banana-buttermilk-breakfast-muffins-topped-with-nutella/ ... Okayyy, I one & a half'd this recipe except I only had 5 bananas.  I "soaked" the oats in 1c plain yogurt mixed w 1/4c milk & 1/3c olive oil to make up for my not having applesauce. I increased vanilla to 2t & decreased sugar to 2/3c - again this is for one &  half recipe.  To half the batter, I added 1 1/2c frozen blueberries.  The one & half recipe made 24 alittlemorethan3/4thsfull muffins.  I liked the ones with the blueberries better.  The banana-only ones were good, too; but not quite banana-y enough.  I know, I know, I was short one; but I'm thinking a shot of banana extract maybe?  'Not so subtle you don't know it's banana.  I think the oats & whole wheat flour tend to lessen it is all.  A good chance I'll make these again - & add the berries - & rename them "Bob Muffins" Blueberry Oatmeal Banana.  Instead of 1/3c olive oil, I'll add 1 / 4c.  Later: Kids, 14 & 16, didn't like 'em.  More for me!

I didn't have buttermilk, so I used regular milk and just added a splash of lemon juice to the sugar before I mixed it all together. They turned out perfect, and tasted great. I added 1/3 cup of mini nestle chocolate chips, too. Will definitely be making these again.

Delish without the Nutella!  (I'm a purist -- Nutella must be eaten with a spoon.)  I used all white flour, and kefir in place of the buttermilk.  Even though I completely forgot to add the melted butter, these muffins still rose beautifully and taste wonderful.  Good recipe, thanks!
