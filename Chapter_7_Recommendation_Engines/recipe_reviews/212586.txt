Good, Simple recipe. To simplify the recipe even more I used frozen steak fries instead of fresh potatoes and they were wonderful. I also added brown sugar, cayanne pepper, and kethup to the sauce ontop of the meatloaf

What a great meatloaf! It's moist and very flavorful! The french fried onions are a great idea and work very well. I will be making this on a regular basis!

I'm NOT a fan of meatloaf, but my family loves it, so I make it for them.  I tried this for the first time, and I actually LOVED it!!  Personally, I'd make it with ground chuck or sirloin next time.  Regular ground beef made it a bit too greasy.

This was a decent meatloaf recipe.  However, next time, I would not roast potatoes in the same pan.  I'll just make mashed potatoeson the side, as I usually do when serving meatloaf.

Boy, it was bland! I followed the recipe exactly and even added some chili powder and some cumin, but it was so bland! Will not make it again.

Delicious! My grandmother used to make the best meatloaf- this taste very similar to it.  I added the phenominal flavoring of Penzeys' Spices- Garden Ranch, Garlic and Kosher Salt to the meatloaf and the potatoes... SO Yummy!

I think this was a good start but needed something more to be a 4 or 5 star rating.  I will try to modify it to my liking next time by adding more of the onions and tomato sauce.

I have always used tomato soup Sooo Good, but found you should add it the last 10 min. or it pretty much disappears.  For health Try no salt tomatoe sauce and add agave sweetner, you can hardly tell the difference.  Also I just add catsup to the meat to start same oloe same ole  Ciau

I found this recipe to be very bland.  I think that if I make it again, I would jazz it up with some Tobasco Sauce or other spices.  I did find that it was a quick and easy way to make a meatloaf.  And I liked that the potatoes cook along side it.

This recipe was amazing.  I have been making a traditional meatloaf for years but I just had the urge to try something new.  I am glad I did.  It was very easy to make.  The french fried onions were a delightful touch.  I also really enjoyed the roasted potatoes.  The only change I made was that I added a meatloaf seasoning packet to the meatloaf because my husband is very big on seasoning.  I am glad I did, it would have been pretty bland without it.  That is why I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  I will definitely make this again.

Great recipe! I have been using tomato soup in mine also for years! I use a whole can of tomato soup with my hamburger. I also use 2 pounds of hamburger along with the egg and worcestershire sauce. Very tasty. It beats catsup by far.

A good base recipe but I prefer the Italian Meatloaf I recipe here much better.  It's always moister if you add veggies right into the meatloaf.  Italian meatloaf uses spaghetti sauce which I think gives it more flavor, plus it also adds cheese inside the meatloaf! But I love the idea of doing that meatloaf with the french fried onions!

This almost falls into the 1-star category for me (couldn't eat it), but I think with some seasoning and ketchup, it might be OK as a leftover in sandwiches. The meatloaf itself, however, was as bland and bland can be, and I even added salt and pepper to the mix when I realized the mix was rather seasoning free. I love meatloaf and make many variations, unfortunately, this will not be one I make again. Neither my daughter nor I cared for it.

One of my favorite comfort food recipes!  I have never cared for classic meatloaf with the ketchup/mustard/brown sugar mixture so this is a wonderful alternative!

Great basic recipe. Try using chili sauce instead of the tomato soup...really adds a nice zing to the dish. I also add shredded cheddar cheese in the mix if I have some on hand and roll the potatoes in the french fried onions for flavor and a nice crunch.
