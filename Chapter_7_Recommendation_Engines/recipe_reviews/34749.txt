If you want to use dried black-eyed peas instead, don't be discouraged by the directions on the package. You DON'T need to soak them overnight, nor do you need to cook them for two hours. Instead, just wash two cups of dried peas thoroughly and simmer them 20 - 25 minutes, drain, and rinse with cold water. They'll be nice and firm, and tastier than canned, for half the cost.

AWESOME!!  This is a great side dish.  The ladies at my office loved it.  My only problem was the recipe itself.  I wasn't sure if you should drain and/or rinse the peas.  Dry soaked black-eyed peas work best since they are firmer.  You need to drain them.  If you use black-eyed peas other than dry soaked, you need to drain and rinse them.  Thanks for a great recipe Pam.

This was a GREAT way to get in our dose of black-eyed peas on New Year's Day!  I used cilantro instead of parsley (it's what I had on hand), and got rave reviews.  Yum!

Loved this recipe.  I used black eyed peas that were canned in water and drained them before adding the other ingredients.  The only changes I made were to use a whole yellow onion and double the dressing ingredients.  Will definitely make this again.

Pretty good.....I used a package of frozen balck-eyed peas and 3 green onions with the rest of the ingredients. I dont think that I cooked the peas enough...slightly hard. I also think that I would double the oil and vinegar. Over all...very tasty combo...served with Chili-Lime Chicken.. on this site.

Very tasty and great for you.  Everyone that I have shared the recipe with has raved about the wonderful taste.  Tested on kids (who asked for second helpings) to the elderly and it is a hit!

Very Good! I used Italian dressing in place of the vinegar and oil, and added green onions and extra tomatoes in addition to the other vegetables. Took this dish to our friends house on New Years Eve and it was a hit! The kids even ate it ~ will definately be on the New Years menu from now on!
2007 update ~ This year I used fresh cilantro and minced garlic. Really "spiced" the recipe up without taking away from the overall dish. The friends loved it more this way than last year!!!

I have made a variation of this for years.  To eliminate the fat  I use a cup of salsa instead of oil and vinegar.  It has all the taste and makes it totally fat free.  Try it with a can of Hominy and substitute black beans for the black-eyed peas for a more Mexican flare.  Don't forget the ground cumin and fresh cilantro.

This is a good salad. I added corn to the mix and it was even better. The addition of corn to this recipe would bring the rating up to 5 stars in my opinion. It is good as is, though. I will make this again.

Great salad.  You do need to store it 24 hours in the refrigerator to blend the flavors, so its best to add the chopped tomatoes shortly before serving or they become soggy overnight.

Nice flavors.  Next time I think I would try making the Black Eyed Peas instead of using them from a can.  I suspect they would have a nicer texture.  Thanks for sharing

Wow!! So yummy!! I couldn't stop eating it!! I used a 16oz bag of dry beans and didn't measure anything else, just put it in. I also added some carrots. Mmmmm........ Next time I will probably add some extra balsamic vinegar. It gets better the longer you keep it in the fridge so make sure not to skip out on that step. Thank you for sharing, I will be making this ALOT!!

I made this for a side dish to go with a smoked ham and some corn bread.  Wonderful dish.  I used dry peas and soaked overnight.  Even better the next day.  Very fresh.

I used fresh black eyed peas. I put everything together and let it sit overnight but it was missing something. I added a little garlic powder and it was still missing something. I didn't have salsa but perhaps it would have saved the salad. I ended up serving it with multigrain scoops. I won't make this again. Sorry.

Very good just go easy on tha onions.  Raw onions are STRONG and can overwhelm the salad.  You dont want people walking around calling you Onion Breath!

Very good recipe.  I followed it exactly.  I made this for church today and was a little concerned that it might be too "interesting" for most folks, but everyone who tried it really liked it and a few asked for the recipe!  Will definitely make again.

I enjoyed this, but only after I added a few other seasonings.  I whisked the balsamic vinegar and oil with some minced garlic, dijon mustard and just a touch of honey, and also added some Italian seasoning.  I still felt like it could have used "something" but it was pretty good.  I did start with dried peas, soaked them overnight and simmered them for about 15 minutes or so until they were slightly tender.

This is very good and easy to make.  I just made half the recipe with one can of black eyes peas (drained and rinsed) and halved the other ingredients (except the sauce).  Let it sit overnight and it was very good.  Will definitely make again.

I love this recipe. It is super easy to make and transports well. I usually make it every time we have a BBQ to go to and I need to bring something but don't have a lot of time. It's so colorful and festive looking. Always a big hit.

I made this recipe for New Years this year, and it was a huge hit. I am not a black eyed pea fan, and I wanted to make something that actually tasted good, and this recipe delivered. I will have to throw this into my regular routine of items to make!

Thought this salad was very fresh and delicious! I did not add tomato because I don't like it, but added some cucumber instead. I also used 1 can of black bean and 1 can of white beans because the store was out of black-eyed peas. Really loved this!

UPDATE:  I've made the original and with substitutions.  This is hands down MUCH better with cider, rather than balsamic vinegar.  The cider doesn't mask the bright veggie colors and doesn't overpower with flavor.  

You can really be creative with this recipe and still turn out a beautiful salad.  For example, I combined this recipe with another by adding: 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard, 2 teaspoons of honey, 4 thin ribs celery - thinly sliced (3/4 cup), 2 carrots - peeled & finely diced (3/4 cup).  I also substituted cider vinegar for balsamic.  Still incredible.

A healthy salad, but bland on the flavor. The next time I make this, I will add some jalapeño peppers and other spices to give more flavor.

This recipe was so yummy!  I cooked a 1/2 bag of frozen black-eyed peas with chicken broth, drained, then let them cool.  Added red onion, red and green bell pepper, lots of cucumber, celery, and shaved a whole carrot.  Added Italian dressing, seasoned with a dash of salt, pepper, and oregano.  Refrigerated until dinner and mmm, mmm, good.  Can't wait to make this dish when it's my turn to host my family after church dinner.  Thanks Ladyem!

I made this recipe as written (except I used dried/cooked peas instead of canned), and I didn't think it was anything special. I was expecting something awesome from the reviews...I thought it was bland and was basically a bunch of things thrown together. Nothing special and missing some kind of kick of flavor. No one wanted to eat it.

This was easy to make and tastes yummy. I forgot the parsley so I replaced the recipe dressing with bottled italian dressing. This recipe is easy to adjust to your taste, for example, I replaced red onions with scallions and it was still great.

I use the canned black-eyed peas with snaps for extra veggies. Drain the peas. I add finely chopped raw broccoli. I also use a high quality balsamic vinaigrette dressing to taste. Around here, it's called Oklahoma Caviar.

I made this with a few substitutions. I omitted the onions & parsley and instead added cilantro, lime, and 2 tsp honey. I used celery salt instead of diced celery. I also added 1 tbsp light italian dressing. And I doubled the tomatoes. Then I added 1 cup cooked baby sweet corn, about 3tsp paprika and some old bay seasoning. Tossed all ingredients together before adding the peas (which had soaked overnight and simmered for 2 hours) and served with homemade tortilla chips sprinkled with salt & nutmeg. Mmmmm! Everyone raved!

This was GREAT! I love in France, so I could not find black-eyed peas, so instead I used canned lentils, which I drained and rinsed. It was outstanding. I will definitely make this again.

Wonderful, really hit the spot!  I did make a "few" changes....I used two cans of black eyed peas, one can drained and one un drained.  I added a can of drained green beans and some red onion.  I doubled the sauce and let it marinate all day.  I put a cup of the marinated beans on a bed of lettuce and had an awesome low fat salad.  Thanks!

Ok as is, but in my own personal opinion two suggestions make it better:  Add a one or two finely diced jalapeno peppers, change the tomatoes to sliced cherry tomatoes and don't add them until shortly before serving.  Regular diced tomatoes will get mushy if left to marinate over night.

This was a good recipe. I drained the black-eyed peas. I also used red wine vinegar rather than balsamic vinegar. I used the pre-diced vegetables out of the produce section of the grocery store to make the preparation go faster.  I also doubled the oil and vinegar.  It was nice and crunchy, and it would be great to take to a potluck. We ate it as a side dish with chicken and dumplings.

This is my all time favorite recipe!!  Sometimes I make it just to have for lunch.  Good way to get your protein in.  I make this recipe exactly the way it is and it's FANTASTIC!!  The last time I made it, I added a small can of sliced olives and it was great!

Nice combo of crunchy veggies and soft beans. The dressing is wonderful! And it can easily be adapted based on other veggies you have in your fridge. I added some kale and carrots and used the cooked beans I had. Loved it!

This was good, I agree, better after marinating!  We had it as part of our good luck dinner on New Years!

Im giving this 3 stars just to be fair.  Maybe we just don't like black eyed peas.  But no one would eat this at our new years eve get together.  I ended up throwing it away.  (something I never do with food) Maybe it was my lack of love for this food while I made it.  Sorry though.  Didnt like this at all.

OK, for years my sister and I have pinched our noses while we dutifully ate one pea. Tried Hoppin' Johns and slow cooker things, still ... disgusting.  I tried this recipe this year and we both took one pea, then a spoon-full, then kept right on eating.  I grabbed chips and she spooned it on her salad.  WONDERFUL!!!  I did use cilantro and doubled the dressing ..FYI.  Here's to a wonderful 2009!

I'm not usually a fan of black eyed peas, but this salad really tastes great with them. I didn't have any fresh tomatoes on hand and in our area, in the winter, they have no flavor anyway, so I used a can of diced fire roasted tomatoes, drained instead. They provided a nice smokey taste to the dish. I'm sure with fresh tomatoes the recipe would taste even better. I would definitely make this again. Would make a great dish to take to a picnic or a potluck.

This is a very good, colorful, nutritious salad! I followed the recipe exactly except that I used 1 extra large red pepper instead of 2 medium peppers and dried parsley instead of fresh. The flavors blend nicely together and it is very refreshing on a warm day.

I made this salad for New Years in lieu of cooked black eyed peas. It was the hit of the dinner.  I followed the recipe exactly. However, next time I will try using cilantro and garlic.  This is definitely a keeper.

Not bad, but pretty blah.  Try the Mexican Bean Salad on this site - it has more zing.

I made this for New Years Day, and all my ginner guests requested the recipe. It is a keeper. Ecception: I used a yellow pepper becouse I do not use green peppers in my recipes.
This is a matter of choice.

As many have ssid, it improves with age.  I thought it needed a little something more when I  tasted it after 16 hours, so I  added some Italian dressing.

Loved this.  Made for New Years.  Was a perfect addition to ham and asparagus!!!  Will definitely make again.  Used dry peas.  Used half the bag for the salad and the other half for crock pot black eyed peas from this site!!!

This was a huge hit at our New Years Day gathering.  Will definitely be making it again and shared the link with 2 gals. I made a few substitutions with what I had on hand. I didn't have a green bell pepper, so I used 1 1/2 colored bell peppers and sub chopped green onions for the green pepper and onion. Same with the fresh parsley. We used 1/4 bunch chopped cilantro. So yummy!!  Thanks!

If I make this again, I would probably use fresh beans instead of canned.  Ate some of the leftovers with sliced almonds.  Tasted great!

I made this as written, but left out the green pepper and red onion, substituted dry parsley for fresh, and added black beans and freshly minced garlic. After marinating overnight, I thought the salad was just okay and probably would have rated it a 3/5. But then I had the leftovers on day 3 or 4 after making it, and OMG- this is amazing!! Definitely will be making this again, but will make a few days in advance to really let the flavors come together.

I made this last weekend and tripled the recipe!  It was a hit with people requesting "to go containers" to take some home.  I made small changes:  1) seed the tomatoes; 2) add garlic powder; 3) try BALSAMIC salad dressing if you run out of the vinegar!  Still a great dish.
- made again this morning with small changes: 1) added two seeded cucumbers; 1 diced white tomato; 2) 1 tbsp. diced garlic and 2 tsp. sugar.  Still a hit!

I made this recipe for a potluck and it was the first empty dish. I used canned peas, rinsed and drained. I also added garlic powder to the oil and vinegar dressing. I made the dish the day before, so the flavors had time to set it. I served it with pita crackers. My family has already requested that I make it again.
