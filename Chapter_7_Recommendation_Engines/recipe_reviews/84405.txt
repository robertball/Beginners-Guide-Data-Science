Ani, God Bless you for sharing this coveted recipe!  I lost my grandmother's recipe for choereg :(
No doubt I was thrilled to find this, which turned out as good as I remember grandma's.  I had to use about 8 cups of flour for this recipe, and instead of the butter/margarine combo, I used all butter and the result was superb!  Thanks again for sharing.

Thank you bunches for sharing your mother's recipe. I'm sure she won't be upset once she learns that it has received so many stars ; ) WHERE TO PURCHASE MAHLEB: you can purchase it on-line by going to The Spice House.  (Ani is registered with them.) TIPS by D McM from Toronto: Use mahleb in similar quantity to how you use nutmeg in any bread or pastry recipe. Mahleb does wonders when added to the dough of shortbread, pound cake, pie crusts and waffles.

This recipe was wonderful and easy to follow.  I used all butter instead of half butter and half margarine.

My husband requested I make this as his grandmother is Armenian and many of his Aunts make it in smaller loaves than this recipe calls for to hold their boiled eggs in on the Easter table.

As he requested it a bit late I did an online search and found this.  My husband said it tasted just like he remembered.

As the recipe says, DO NOT omit the Mahleb!  It may be hard to find but it does make the recipe perfect.  Also, using the same braiding technique mentioned on smaller sections of dough and connecting the ends to form a small circle produces a lovely "egg cup."  when you do this the same cooking time applies.

You can replace the mahleb with 2 tbsp. freshly ground orange peel and decorate the top after brushing with egg with whole almonds.

Ani's mother would probabably kill her for divulging the formula... my grandmother never wrote them out!  This is a great recipe.  Only problem was the dough was too soupy, I had to add about 1 to 2 cups of flour (to the halved recipe)

Being of Armenian descent I've had my fair share of Choereg, and I must say, this is truly a wonderful recipe.  My mother too would kill me because she gave me her recipe last year (which I lost and couldn't bring myself to tell her) so I found this one, I tried it and EVERYONE was so pleased with the outcome, including my mother who thought it was her recipe! Oh well, at the end of the day it's about yummy food right?! This will just have to be my little secret.  :)

I have not made this particular recipe.  However, I spent an entire weekend trying to duplicate my grandmother's recipe which of course was not written down.  I found several recipes...this one being close if not dead on to the base recipe that I used. (Some from the internet, one from the St. James Armenian Church recipe book (Richmond, VA).

After a couple of close encounters, I remembered that my grandmother used evaporated milk.  When I substituted evaporated milk for whole milk, it tasted identical to my grandmother's.

My grandmother would put M&M's, colored sugar, and gummy candies on top of the bread (likely for us!).  We loved the way that it smelled in the kitchen.  She made it at Christmas as well as Easter.  

Oh, how I miss her cooking--both the smell and taste of it!  These also make WONDERFUL dinner rolls that your guests will love.  So, don't relegate them to the holidays!

Thanks you for sharing this recipe.

I've had my eye on this recipe for a couple of years now, and finally got around to making it. The flavor is greatâ€”I'd never baked with mahleb before. I didn't like working with the dough, though. I found it to be greasy and sticky, almost like braiding cookie dough. I think that the next time I make this recipe (and I do plan to make it again) I'll try bread flour instead of all-purpose and use the method for mixing brioche: letting the dough mix and the gluten structure form before adding room temperature butter, a tablespoon or so at a time, until fully incorporated.

Most excellent.  Not too hard to make.  I make 6 loaves not five.  Hardest part is remembering how to braid!  Really flavorful. Really good! Use less bread flour or the max normal flour.  Forget the margarine, use all butter.

Oh this bread was delicious! I found mahleb at Amazon.com believe it or not. I halved the recipe and used all butter (never ever margarine at my house) and got two large, tender braids. I liked it best fresh from the oven, but DH enjoyed it lightly toasted with honey butter. Thank you so much for sharing!

Dear Ani I would like to thank you a lot for this recipe which I've been looking for it for ages. I had the chance to taste it may be 30 years ago, since then I was hopping to find the recipe to make it myself. Thank you again and by the way I am from Egypt, if there'll be any recipe you might think of and would to have it from our side, I'll be more than glad to help with it. Take care and keep up the good work AL

Growing up traditional cooking wasn't my mothers thing, so every holiday I try recipes which I think create family time and bring some of the older traditions back. This sweet bread was amazing.Really great instructions to follow, (since this is my 2nd yeast bread EVER)simple and precise. The family loved it and want it made not just at Easter. Doubled the "wow this is great" by having spreadable honey butter to go with. Thank you for sharing.

Very authentic.  Just like what I grew up eating at Easter.  I would have to agree that additional flour is needed and I added one extra egg.  The mahleb is a very key ingredient here, so do not leave it out.  This also freezes very well but should be wrapped in several layers of plastic or foil as it is a delicate bread.

Thanks for sharing your recipe -- it's perfect, just how my mom and yaya made it.  I don't use margarine, so mine was all butter.  I also leave out eggs several hours ahead of time so they come to room temperature, as my yaya suggested.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  Can't wait to make it again this Easter.

Ok, I hate to say it, but this recipe is BETTER than the armenian cook book (cooking bible for armenians!)! Being 100% Armenian, I have cooked traditional Armenian food for years.  I cant believe I found a recipe so very yummy!  I did not have mahleb, so I used anise seed (sparingly since my family is not fond of the taste)  This got RAVE reviews from family and friends.  Beautiful presentation as well.  MAKE IT!! ITS YUMMY!

When it comes to baking my cooking skills drop considerably so I may have done something wrong.   I had to add almost 3 cups of flour because  the dough was not a dough but the consistency of thin oatmeal you would have for breakfast.  It was about right then but of course it was a little heavy then.   I have not tasted it yet but I bet it will taste ok but it will not be lite and/or fluffy.

This is delicious but using salted butter a bit more sugar and orange peel rather than the mahleb makes for a much more delicious treat... at least that is how my Armenian Great Grandmother made it. Yum.

I made this as part of my Easter brunch and it was amazing!  I had to travel a ways to buy whole mahleb, and then grind it with a mortar and pestle, but it was so worth the work.  It may sound strange, but I loved kneading this dough!  It was so soft and flexible.  My guests loved it, and I still have 2 loaves to myself!  Thank you!

Thank you for the perfect explanation of this delicious Ã‡Ã¶rek (this is how we spell it in Turkish but I bet the pronunciation is same). It used to be something we get when we used to visit our Armenian friends in Istanbul in Easter times. Now I live in Ankara and do visit them occasionally but catching the easter delicacies is like winning the lottery. Thank you for the recipe... I'll try it as sson as I go and get Mahleb from the spice store.

This was fantastic.  Thanks for introducing me to Mahleb.  I've started adding it to all kinds of things (like a cherry pound cake, delicious!).

Absolutely perfect. Be sure to grab some fresh out of the oven!

 I actually ran out of all-purpose flour, so I used mostly bread flour, but it still came out delicious. I also used all butter. Mahleb was ordered from the Spice House online. 

My brother is living in Armenia and can't be home for Easter, so making this bread brings him a little closer to home. Thank you for sharing, Ani!

Incredible Bread that may be enjoyed as is, or as a delicious sandwich, filled with your favorite savory meats. Slightly crunchy crust, structured, yet fluffy textured crumb with subtle sweetness that's addicting.  I added diced candied citrus peels to the dough and sliced almonds on top prior to baking on the stone.  Fantastic presntation for a festive celebration... Thanks Ani!

All you need is one more person telling you that more flour was needed! But, I halved the recipe and still added 2-1/2 cups of extra flour. However, I didn't have the "required" spices, but read somewhere on a spice website that I might want to try anise, nutmeg and cinnamon; so I did - and it was superb! Only 1/2 tsp. of each for half the recipe, and barely detectable when eating the bread... but I think it enhanced the sweetness of the bread. I also used all butter in the recipe. I shaped the dough, brushed with egg and sprinkled with sesame seeds prior to letting it rise - proofing it on the oven proofing setting for 45-60 minutes, then just turned the oven on to 350 and baked it for about 20 minutes. Everyone was quite impressed, and out of 18 people - some who took a few slices home with them for leftovers - there were only 6 slices left for our family. We devoured it at the next meal. This is a wonderful - quick and easy, actually - recipe that I'm sure I'll make again!

Thanks for sharing this recipe! My family enjoyed it. Don't skip the mahleb.

I halved this recipe and it made two big loaves. I had to add about 1.75 additional cups of flour to get it to be a workable dough. It was much too wet without adding the extra flour. I also used all butter instead of margarine, and I used skim milk instead of whole. The bread turned out fine. Maybe I'll even add a bit more mahleb next time.

Ok so I made this twice.  I'm a reasonably good baker and when I read other reviews about needing more flour, in the first batch I added enough flour make a dough familiar to me (which was a fair bit).  After baking it, I ended up with a beautiful bread that was like Challah's twin. The second time I made the recipe exactly as written, and got this  greasy mess of a dough that I thought would be terrible.  It didn't rise as well either.  However, the finished bread is absolutely exquisite!  It's flaky but bread all a the same time...best way I know how to describe it.  So, when you're making it (and DO make it) don't have a heavy hand when adding flour and don't look for a typical bread dough.

And, one last thing about the mahleb - first batch I made I didn't include it because I didn't have it and figured it would be hard to find.  But a couple days later I saw it just sitting on the shelf at the grocery store so I put it in the second batch.  Totally worth it!  And, I hardly live in a major city or anything so check locally before deciding you won't find it near you.

All in all, this bread is amazing and exactly what you'd hope for when you invest time into making bread.  It's delicious, different, and beautiful on the table.

This is absolutely wonderful. I have made it every week for a few months now. I use white wheat sometimes. I have added into the braids Nablus cheese, I have made them little zaatar pies. It goes quick. If someone knows I am making it, they ask for some too! Nothing smells better than bread baking in the house! Yummmmm

My husband and I really enjoyed this bread and will continue to make it every Easter.  I added an extra 3/4 of a cup of flour to get the correct consistency.  I couldn't find Mahleb anywhere so I replaced it with cinnamon and nutmeg.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Seriously delicious. My family loves this bread. Yes, does need about 1.5 cups more flour. Otherwise perfectly worth the search for Mahleb.you won't be disappointed!

Wow this bread tastes so rich and buttery, i have made hefezopf for years and years which is a German variation and is a braided yeast bread, This recipe was no more difficult to make and the result is truly delicious. I will probably switch to this Armenian variation going forward for its rich texture and buttery flavor. I made this hoping to surprise my husband when he comes home from work as he is Armenian and his grandmother and mom make this too. Thank Ani for sharing!

I am Armenian and I approve of this recipe! My only changes: used all butter, no margarine. And I prefer a slightly sweeter bread so added another 1/3 cup of sugar. As far as shaping them, I make my aunties shapes..pinwheels, and twists.

I have always wanted to make this bread but had no idea what mahleb was until I found a SPICE store near by! I was pleasantly surprised by the texture of the bread  and the hint of flavor from the mahleb.  The bread was so light and moist not like bread at all.  Like others, I had to add extra flour, but only enough to make the dough so it didn't stick to my fingers -- still very soft.  I am hooked on this now and would have made my Armenian Aunt Noone proud.

The amount of flour needed for this recipe was way off, so if you are an inexperienced baker, this would not be the recipe to start with.  Other than that, the flavor was very good.

This was absolutely delicious and my Armenian husband loved it! I used all butter and golden caster sugar, i used a lot more flour to get a good dough consistency maybe 2-3 more cups....it made 5 good sized loaves and was soft, fluffy and very moorish :)

The only change I made was subbed the margarine for butter (I think margarine is  gross) and not sure what that did, but it came out dry and crumbly. I think there needs to be more kneading to develop gluten, and maybe an overnight ferment after the initial rise. I too found that this recipe is short on flour, weights and flour type would help. Not sure why this recipe gets such high ratings.

Thank you very much for this recipe. I made it with butter only. I tasted the dough as I loved eating it when my mom made it. I added a couple of tablespoon of sugar.  They came out perfect. Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe. I will definitely make it again very soon. They are all eaten already. Great recipe!

This is honestly the most complicated thing I believe I have ever baked, but it was so, so worth it. I am not an expert at working with yeast or making bread, but I followed the directions EXACTLY as they were written (with the addition of a good amount of flour during the kneading process) and it came out AMAZING. I cannot believe I actually made something this delicious. I am in charge of the Armenian dish for my daughter's kindergarten culture program and I think even the pickiest eaters there will LOVE it. Thank you SO much for sharing.

I followed the Direction and found the dough very liquidy, not workable. Here are my changes:
2 TBSP Mahleb
3 sticks of butter ( no margarine)
Cut the salt into 1/2 TSP only, for a less salty taste
One additional cup of flour (7 total) to be able to work with the dough
Baked at 325F depending on your oven

I would certainly give this recipe 5 stars for flavour and crumb as it is really delicious. The recipe calls for 6 cups of flour "or as needed". I will keep this in my collection for special occasions but with the changes noted.  Thank you.

This sounds VERY similar to my mother-in-law's recipe. She was Turkish and used to call it "pita or peta" bread (not like the pocket bread). I made her recipe a long time ago using cardamom as I didn't have mahleb. It was pretty close in flavor. I have not yet made this recipe but can't wait to try it! My mother-in-law has passed away and my husband really misses her traditional Easter and New Year's bread. Thanks so much for sharing!
