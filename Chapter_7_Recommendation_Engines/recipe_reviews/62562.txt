Tried this recipe and it was different than what we are used to. To make this better I would add some onions and celery to make it a little better. Not sure about the Miracle Whip.. gave a different taste. I enjoy using Mayo in any potato salad recipes. We also did not add in the eggs. All in all not a bad recipe but I doubt we will be trying it again.

Good start to a great potato salad bland as written. I made this as written then just started throwing things in. This needed a little more personalization to make it more potato-salad-y than just mashed potatoes with cheese and eggs. I added three very large chopped celery ribs some chopped garlic dills a bunch of chopped green onion some crumbed crisp bacon a tablespoon or so of dijon a litle Frank's Hot Sauce and some spices (onion powder garlic powder chopped chives). We don't use Miracle Whip so I just substituted Hellman's. It's always good to use less liquid (sour cream/mayonnaise) than what's called for and just add as you go. This way it's neither too wet or dry. We enjoyed it. Honestly I think we like the texture of a roughly mashed potato salad than a chunk to be honest. It just tastes better that way.

i think the previous two reviewers have done this recipe an injustice. carolyn makes it pretty clear that this is not going to be your average potato salad. i was not looking for average. that is why i tried this one. i had to make some changes as to what i had in my pantry. i substituted yogurt for sour cream and mayonaise for miracle whip. since the only real difference i have ever noticed between miracle whip and mayonaise is miracle whip is sweeter i added 1 1/2 T of sugar to the sauce. that might seem like a lot but i was also trying to compensate for the tartness of the yogurt. i did not want to ad anything as strong as onions so i added 1 T freeze dried chives. the resulting salad was superb. if you are a mashed potato fan you have got to give this recipe a try. it's a winner!

My family found this to be tasty as is although we felt that it needed another egg or two and maybe some onions (green onions for a little color maybe).

Looking for a potato salad that needed a photograph I came across this one. I used all the ingredients as listed with the exception that I did not peel my potatoes. We like potato salad with the skins. My family found the salad a little too plain for their taste buds. I told them to let it blend all night and try it again if it wasn t to their liking I would doctor it up. Twenty four hours later I found myself adding 3 extra eggs cup of diced onion and 2 stalks of celery. Three stars as written and 4 stars with the added ingredients.
