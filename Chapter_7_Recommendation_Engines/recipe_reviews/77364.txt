Although this recipe has "cooked" in the title, I made it raw, and it was delicious. I used fresh garlic and omitted the sugar; otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. The olives and paprika added so much flavor. And it was so easy to make!

I increased the peppers and decreased the tomatoes a little.  A wonderful compliment to Moroccan tagine and couscous, and very easy to make.

A very versatile, tasty recipe. In my case, I needed a quick salad to complement b'stilla, and wanted something fresh-tasting that would taste good cold. I get annoyed when people leave reviews for recipes they've changed, but it is a flexible recipe... and I didn't want to go back to the store for the tomatoes I forgot to buy. I used one each of red, orange, yellow, and green peppers and a can of diced tomatoes. I also added a handful of coarsely chopped cilantro because it was left over from making the b'stilla. It got rave reviews with the lunch crew at work.

If you follow the actual recipe I rate this a 4 star.  However, I added my own twist and it became a 5 star!  I added one can of drained and rinsed black beans, and omitted the green olive garnish.  This was an amazing side dish, as I served it over couscous, and along with the Moroccan salmon cakes, also on allrecipes.com.  What a great meal!

I love this salad! Thank you so much for the recipe! I decided to make it "lukewarm". The only difference I've made was to boil the tomatos for a short time until I could peel them. Afterwards they get cubed and I DID NOT cook them anymore before I've mixed the ingrediences up.

P.S.: Sorry for my poor English. I'm not a native speaker. :o) - Dinita

Great recipe. I didn't add green olives since I didn't have any but I did substitute it with a teaspoon of sundried tomato pesto.But even without that it would still be a great tasty side veggie dish.

flavours were nice, I would say it's more of a salsa-type topping than a salad. Brought it to a dinner party as I was supposed to bring the salad to a Moroccan themed dinner. Tasted good but not salad-like at all.

I cooked the vegetables on the grill and they turned out great!  We even used the left over salad as an alternative to our usual fajitas mix.

Too much effort for the outcome. Calls for too much oil, I found.

I had some tomatoes and peppers in need of using up and this was a great little recipe.  I used capers instead of olives (personal preference) for that briney pop and left out the oil completely.  Very enjoyable summer side.

I have used this recipe many times since I discovered it. When I make my family favorite, sausage with fried peppers and onions, I sprinkle these seasonings on the fried peppers.  I have been told by family members that it was the best sausage and peppers they had ever had. The seasonings add another layer of flavor which makes this dish so delicious. I make a batch of seasoning mix ahead of time and keep it in a jar and then just sprinkle it over the peppers as I am cooking.

If your tomatoes are large; add extra bell pepper.  Also, a very meaty tomato such as roma might be better.

As the recipe stated, excellent either hot or cold!  Unique taste, and a totally fresh take on tomato/pepper  combo
