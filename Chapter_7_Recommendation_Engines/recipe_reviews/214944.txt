I was skeptical, since it was unrated, but it certainly sounded good!  I had a fine filet, almost one pound, and cut it into two. I added the garlic powder, dill, salt and pepper, then covered each one with half-slices of thick-sliced bacon so that it looked like the picture above.  Baked at 375 for about 20 - 22 min., then broiled carefully on high, at about 6-inches below the broiler until the bacon was crisp--about 4 - 5 minutes.  (Don't ignore it, or let it get away!) The result? Splendid!  Best salmon filets I have ever had! These were nice big 8 oz filets with good thick bacon, and were a real treat,  worthy of professional offering as a seafood main course !

The way I see it, adding bacon to ANYTHING is a good thing and adding it to salmon is a great thing!  This is a wonderful quick and tasty dish.  I sliced some potatoes and added them to the pan.  In a separate skillet I sauted up some zuchinni, summer squash, tomato, onion, and garlic which made a nice side dish to compliment the fish.  Everyone should try this recipe.  You won't be disappointed!

Not sure what prompted me to look for a recipe like this, but it was worth it! This was an excellent meal!  My husband is DEFINTELY a salmon/fish snob, and he rarely eats it if it's not grilled. Since we had to ditch our grill before moving across the country, I have been trying different methods of cooking fish. I have failed miserably MANY times, and this was my FIRST SUCCESS! We both ranked this 10/10.  The salmon stayed moist and flaky, and the bacon with it was great. Unusual, but delicious, flavor combination.  Next time I might try cooking it on a broiling pan so the oils/juices can run down, just as an experiment. I'll post an update if it produces anything different.  Yum, yum, yum--enjoy!

I normally grill my fish on the BBQ, but today I wanted to try something different and stumbled across this recipe. It's delicious! But that's a given, considering it's topped with bacon!  I personally think 20-25 mins is a little long. Instead, I increased the temp to 425 for the first 5 mins, then 400 for another 10 mins and the salmon was perfectly cooked and moist, plus the bacon was just how I like it. No need to broil at the end.  I wasn't that hungry, but I ended up eating both pieces I made because it was so good! I didn't even have a chance to take a pic. Next time!

This recipe couldn't be easier.  I love salmon, I love bacon, and I hate any recipes that are labor intensive (a.k.a. easy for me to mess up).  I followed the recipe to a T and it came out great.  Even my chef husband loved it.  What they say is true; bacon DOES make everything better.

I thought this was very good and easy to make!  I was a little tentative about the broiling though since for the bacon to be more well done I was afraid I might ruin the fish so stayed conservative!

Super easy, delicious addition to the Salmon and no need to marinate= so you can make it quick! We had jasmine rice and a Brussel sprout/broccoli medley on the side... Next time I will plan ahead and prepare saut√©ed mushrooms too. Mmmmm :)

This is wonderful!  I am always looking for recipes for salmon because my father goes to Alaska fishing for it, so we always have plenty of fresh salmon around.  The only problem is, I don't like salmon!  I WANT to like it.  I love it raw, in fact, it's my favorite raw fish.  I just don't like how it becomes "fishy", once cooked, smoked, poached, baked, grilled, rubbed, roasted...you name it.
This recipe kept the salmon really moist and there was NO "fishy" taste at ALL!  I could eat this daily...and might!

Just tried this tonight.  I was skeptical, thinking that the salmon would be too done because we like our salmon medium rare.  It was done more then we like it but it was SO moist.  We loved it.  I used a thin sliced bacon and the pieces kinda seperated while cooking.  Next time I will overlap them just a bit.  I kept the bacon whole and let the end drap over the fish.  served it with roasted root veggies.  YUM!

Giving this 3 stars is generous. I have Salmon twice a week, love this fish, I have a lot of very good recipes but enjoy checking new ones out. What a way to ruin a beautiful piece of fillet, the seasoning is lost and all you have is a bacon grease covered fish, mind you anything tastes better with bacon and that‚Äôs what you really taste ...is bacon with a hint of greasy salmon. People move on from this recipe!

Did this tonight, and found it magnificent!!  It was excellent with fresh dill rather than dried, just for you to know, and it was great.   Not all recipes are great, often they're missing ingredients, or the time for the cooking is off, or worse, things you'd never put in a dish together!!  This however was true to form, good food!!  Also, wanted to let you know, that my salmon was frozen solid, and this did not affect anything, other than you'll need to increase the time in the oven by 5-10 minutes.  It needs to be cooked through with a little firm to touch so you know it's done.  WARNING:  make more than you think you'll need, because family will want seconds on this one!!

This was delicious. 

Because I'm lazy I put asparagus drizzled with a little oil and salt under the salmon so it cook at the same time and cooked for 25 min, then broiled as others did. Served with a side of cauliflower mash. Thanks for the recipe.

I changed it a bit, since I only had salmon without skin, I wrapped the salmon in the bacon sort of like a Fillet Mignon. I made this for my parents and they loved it. Thanks man. :D

I've been using this recipe for 9 years now, (for as long as I've been married) it's the only recipe I continually follow. My husband requests it for every special occasion. The only thing I ever do different is double the spice mixture because we love it so much. 

I usually roast veggies as a side along with it.

This was so amazing!  The dill and the bacon worked really well with the salmon.  Made it exactly as written.  This is a keeper.

I was nervous because of the name, but it was actually really really tasty.  I made this account to recommend this actually lol.  I was a little lenient on the bacon usuage, next time I would be super extra with the bacon. I suggest the same. I made it with mashed potatoes and they went really well together.

Loved it

Changed it a bit.  Used two wild salmon filets  1/2 lb. each.  Seasoned the filets with lemon zest,  sprigs of fresh tarragon,  sea salt and fresh ground pepper.  Cooked the thick cut bacon some before cooling and wrapping salmon horizontally around the filets.  Put filets in an oven proof pan with melted cooking fat on stove for 2 mins. ea. side on high heat to brown bacon.  Put pan in oven at 375 for about 8-10 mins.  Garnished with lemon and served on bed of mixed greens and served  with thin green beans.  Best ever.

This is a often asked for dinner in our house.  I usually baste the salmon with brown sugar and maple syrup before putting the bacon on and then again on top of the bacon.  Serve it with wild rice that has a few squirts of siracha and everyone is happy.

This was absolutely delicious. I didn't have dill so I just did salt, pepper and garlic. I used apple wood smoked bacon. My husband is not a fish eater but he loved it and asked me to make it again.  The salmon stayed moist, which is something i have always had trouble with. I am about to have bariatric surgery and I will be able to fix this for me too, minus the bacon.

Growing up in Alaska I was able to try salmon cooked in a wide variety of ways but never before had I tried it cooked with bacon.  I discovered this recipe 10 days ago and tonight will be the 3rd time I have made it since then.  Somehow these two distinctly flavored meats compliment each other well.

I don't personally eat salmon; however, my husband loves it.  His comment "how do you make this taste so great, you're not a good cook" (which I agree with).  Thank you for saving me!

This is going in my 5 star recipe file.  My bacon took longer to crisp under the boiler than I thought it should and I was sure the salmon would be dry but it was incredible!  Will cook my salmon this way from now on.
