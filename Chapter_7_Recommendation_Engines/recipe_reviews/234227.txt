I used a chopped cucumber in place of the dill pickle, and this was fabulous!  This is my kind of lunch with some veggies on the side!

I followed the recipe exactly! The oats seemed weird but I went with it and glad I did. I didnâ€™t find this bland at all, I thought it was very flavorful! Will be a new staple in my house!

I liked this, but it is a bit bland.  I ended up adding the pickle juice and 1 tablespoon dijon mustard, and then went back and added yellow mustard.  There is very little flavor, but I'll be watching the reviews to see what all of you creative cooks come up with to improve it!

I saw a question about this recipe on the Buzz since it had been nominated for Recipe Group.  I had everything on hand and I really need a way to get whole oats into my diet so I tried it.  I did make it for 1 serving so instead of using the food processor I used my immersion blender on the oatmeal, pickle juice and garbanzo beans and then hand chopped the onion, pickles & celery.  Mixed together with the mayo & mustard.  Loved it!  I used Klaussen dill pickles and thought the flavor was great could even throw in some sweet pickles too.  Definitely a keeper!

This recipe is easy, tasty, and a great vegetarian option  for lunch or snacks. Unlike another reviewer, I didn't find the pickle flavour (or dill flavour, as she said) too much at all. The only addition I made was salt and pepper. Next time, I may use half mayo and half fat free plain Greek yogurt, to make it even healthier. I might also swap the regular onion with red onion to make it prettier. Thanks for a great lunch alternative!

a good base start for vegan tuna - after making it once there are many options for improvising to taste. We wrapped it in collard greens with added olives and peppered to liking.
