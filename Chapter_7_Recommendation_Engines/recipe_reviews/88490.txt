This is great. I use it to make Cherry Crumb pie. Use a pre-made pie shell, a can of cherry pie filling, and this topping, then bake. Makes a great quick and easy dessert!

Delicious and easy.  I put the mixture in the oven by itself for about 10 minutes and used it to top a no-bake pie.

UPDATE: I made the apple pie filling from Grandma Ople's Apple Pie (from this site) and topped with this instead of pie crust.  My family loved it!

This is my standard dessert topping. For a twist on the theme, add some toasted finely chopped walnuts or pecans.

This is so easy and delicious!  I make it ahead, freeze it and if I decide to make a small fruit crisp, I take out what I need and place it back in the freezer to use again.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

This was such an easy crumb topping to make. I only needed half of it for my peach cobbler(and even that was a very generous topping), but the rest of it kept very well in the fridge. It can be topped on any fruit (with or without a pie crust) and baked. The result is PERFECT with vanilla ice cream!

I halfed this recipe, but in error put the full amount of butter in, still good, but not as crumbly as it would've been otherwise. A nice simple crumb topping which I put over blueberry muffins.  Very good.

I loved this!!  I did add a couple of dashes of cinnamon.  I mixed the sugar, flour, and cinnamon together, then added cubed butter.  I mashed the butter cubes into the flour mixture with my hands, then put the mixture in the freezer for 30- 60 mins.

Not sure if I did something wrong, but I ended up with a large hard top crust that we ended up picking up as a whole and eating with our fingers. Tasted fine, but didn't come out as a crumble.

I added this on top of an apple pie and it worked great! Loved how it became crispy and tasted amazing. Will be adding this to many pies in the future! (Although I find I usually have to add a little more butter than 1/4 cup)

I like this topping well enough, but found it way too much for a single pie. (I put it on a Mrs. Smith's frozen  Cherry Pie) I halved all three ingredients. I tried mixing the cold diced butter into the brown sugar/flour mixture by hand with a fork as suggested in the recipe, but it wouldn't combine. After softening the butter (in the bowl with the brown sugar & flour) for 20 secs in the microwave, it combined just fine, using a a hand mixer. Tastes really good!

Doubled the butter in order to get it to actually form crumbs.  Used the whole amount to cover 9" Cherry Pie.  Delicious!

I love streusel-crummy kinda toppings, but I was making a blackbean, pulled rabbit, and quinoa casserole and had nothing to top it with. I swapped out the sugar for parmesan and used this. It was awesome! Now I use this as a savory crumb mix as well as sweet.

I used this topping for my Blueberry Muffins and it was an instant hit, will use again. But more topping on them because I forgot how much muffins expand when they bake, very very simple and worked soo well.

Very good... I've used it on pies, muffins and coffee cakes. You can add nuts or coconut for variation...maybe 1/3 to 1/2 c. My family really likes the coconut added in. It toasts and gets brown while the pie or cake is baking. I recently made Aloho Quick Bread from this site (used for muffins) then topped it with this w/ the coconut added in. Really fantastic! Thanks for a recipe I'll use over & over.

This may deserve 5 stars, but it's on the pie in the oven right now, so I haven't tasted it yet.  I added sliced almonds and sprinkled it on a three-berry pie.  Can't wait to taste it!!

I've used this recipe before making a sugar free cherry crumb pie before.  I used a store bought pie crust with sugar free cherry pie filling.  To make the crumb topping I used a brown sugar subsitute that you can find anywhere.  My mom absolutley loved it.  She was so excited to be able to eat a pie during the holiday's.

I made this topping separately for a topless blueberry pie, and then spooned it onto the filled pie. It was very good! I would add a little cinnamon to give it a little extra flair.

I got rave reviews from everyone who tried my pie, but I think it would be even better baked onto the top of a pie.

This was the perfect topping to the Blackberry & Blueberry Pie by Debbie Sanchez.  I only had one frozen roll-out pie crust available and didn't want to make my own crust so opted for this topping.  The topping is very sweet so, if the filling is also sweet, you might consider reducing the sugar in the filling.

Great alternative to a top crust on fruit pies. I use it on Zucchini pie (also from this site) to cut down on the calories. Easy to make and makes a wonderful topping.

I increased the butter to 6 Tbl and still found it a bit dry and powdery when you cut your pie.  I also cut the sugar to 3/4 cup and added 1/2 tsp cinnamon.  I'm going to try it again with 3/4 cup flour, 3/4 cup sugar, 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 6 Tbl butter.  It is a good basic.  Could also add chopped nuts and oatmeal.

I used this for "Oatmeal Banana Cupcakes" from this site and it was perfect.  My only complaint is the recipe makes way more than needed!  I cut it in half because it sounded like a lot, and I still only used half of it for my whole batch of muffins..and I applied it liberally.  But the muffins were so delicious, I just sealed the rest in a baggie and will use it again soon!

This was an ok crumb topping.  I think for the pie I made a nut crumb topping would have been better.  I made Apple Pie by Grandma Ople (from this site) and I made a wonderful crust called Best Pie Crust Ever (from this site)  and the crust does hold up to its name.  Thanks for the crumb topping recipe!

Didn't feel like this was crunchy or crumbly enough, more like a sweet dusting. Will try again while adding oats.

Based on other reviews I cut this back to 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup flour and kept it at 1/4 cup butter. I added a dash of cinnamon. Topping for a cherry pie. Consistency good for crumble with increased ratio of butter to dry ingredients

I made it exactly as written with the exception that I added walnuts.  I'm not a real sweets person so I did not use enough of the crumbs, so next time I will use more (if I remember).

I substituted white for the brown sugar as I was making a Strawberry Rhubarb and didn't think the molasses in the brown wold work with the tastes.

SUGAR FREE VERSION: I made it last night for the first time and I utilized other comments just because I wanted to make sure it was a good turn out since I didn't have time to make it again. I followed the simple recipe but with these modifications:
1.Halved the recipe because I was topping 12 small pastries so 
1/2 c. brown sugar
1/2 c. flour
2-3 tbsp. butter

BUT I used Splenda brown sugar blend and reduced to 1/3 because its so much sweeter than regular brown sugar
And I increased the butter back up to 1/4 cup and used the advice to pop it in the micro for 20 seconds to soften but not melt. 

IT WAS AWESOME !! Thank you! Simple and duplicatable.

I love this! I have celiac disease, and gluten free pie crusts just don't go on pretty as toppers. I use this (often with Grandma Ople's Apple Pie) and ALWAYS mix in crushed pecans (candied when possible) to give it an extra crunch and an extra kick. For my fellow celiacs, I use Bob's Red Mill pie crust mix to make this.

4 stars for the recipe as is (pet peeve of mine to rate based on your tweaks & not the original recipe!!)  I've used this recipe for many years & it's good, but decided to read a few of the 
 recommendations from others before making this time.  

I made a few changes based on the suggestions of others.  I made 2 pies- the first, I added 2 extra TBSP of butter.  This pie came out looking like it had a hard candy crust & there was actually a bit of butter sitting on the top of the pie that I had to soak up with a paper towel.  The second pie (and MY recommendation for this recipe to be 5-stars) I still used the 2 extra TBSP of butter, but I cut the brown sugar down to 3/4 cup. I was concerned because the mix looked EXTREMELY dry while I was putting it on the pie, but it baked BEAUTIFULLY & looks amazing!! Will definitely be making it this was for future!

I used a pastry cutter, and got a sand like mixture and when you squeeze it in your fist it holds together. Sprinkled it on my pie and baked it. It was very good, and better than a top crust. I think it's important to use cold butter.

While the recipe is fine and very simple, it was WAY too much for just one pie. Above the directions it showed "2 servings" but servings is not "pies", and maybe that's where the problem lies. One review noted the big lump on top of their pie, and i think this is the reason why, so just make TWO pies instead of one, and you're DOUBLY happy!

Great, quick, delicious topping for fresh apple pie.  I do add 1/2 teas. of cinnamon, and 1/2 teas. of nutmeg.  Sometimes I add about 3 T. of chopped walnuts.    Yummy!

I have made this crumb topping multiple time and it seems as though if you melt the butter it comes out much more crumbly and flavorful.

thanks for reading my review! -Remy

I used it for peach pie topping and found it to be too sweet. I would definitely make it again but will try using half the sugar called for in the recipe. I bet adding some cinnamon would taste real good too.

I halved the recipe for a 9 inch premade pie crust and added 1/2 cup oats.  Was very good and simple to make!

Tasted good, but as another reviewer said,  it ended up as a hard crust that we cracked as it was cut.

I have made this crumb topping for a long time, but instead of putting it on top of pies I put it on a cookie sheet. place it in the oven at 350, after 15 minutes stir with fork to make big chunks, bake for another 15 minutes. let cool and eat. its ike a quick and simple cookie. My kids love it.

Simple enough recipe, I always use this atop of my cherry pie with homemade crust, I do add a bit of water to the topping for it to crumple properly.

My daughter has made this crumb topping for my home-made apple pie filling. It is wonderful and easy. (I watched her make it.) It was a perfect complement to our apple pie.

I made this last night over an apple pie. I love oatmeal so I only used 1/2 cup of flour and 3/4 cup of quick cooking oats, and I also used dark brown sugar since that's what I had. Husband and son approved!

This topping covers 2 pies.  I use it as the top crust for the apple pies I take to the church bazaar every November.  I use unsalted butter, so I sprinkle a little salt into the flour, and then I shake in a little cinnamon.  I decrease the brown sugar to 3/4 cup, and cut in the room temperature butter with a pastry blender.  I have used this recipe for several years, and it is quick to make and tasty to eat.  I use this topping to cover the 5 pies I make from the 40 serving apple pie filling recipe on this site.

I used 3/4 cup brown sugar and 3/4 cup flour and it made plenty for the topping of my apple pie. I added some cinnamon since that is also in my pie. It tasted delicious!

Here's another rave review for this recipe!  I made this for the "German Apple Cake I" that is also found on this site and turned out great!  The only thing I did was that I quartered the recipe because I didn't need so much.  Thanks for the post!

This is a very good recipe you can use it for so many other recipes.
I used it on top of an Apple Pie instead of a standard crust top.
It baked up really nice and was crunchy and made my pie look beautiful.
