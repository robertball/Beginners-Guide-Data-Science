These turned out better than I had anticipated. I did add more fresh parsley than the recipe called for but the chicken was full of flavor. My biscuits did not hold their shape too good but I am dough challenged and it could have been user error. I did not use the option chives simply because I forgot about them. They would have been great in this. The only change I would recommend is to use slices of mozz instead of the shredded so that it stays on better. Great recipe!
