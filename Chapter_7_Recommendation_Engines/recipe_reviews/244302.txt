I've made this recipe many times.  In my book, it's a winner; easy to make. As to the comment about being too greasy, I always brown my hamburger first and then rinse it under water in a colander.   Then transfer it back to the fry pan and add seasonings.  Voila!  No grease.

I was looking for a recipe that did not use cream cheese. Husband is not a fan. I was amazed at how simple this was to make. You can serve any number of toppings with this dish to make it a complete meal.
 I used 93/7% ground beef and still had grease. I will rinse the meat after browning the next time I make it. 
The bottom of the rolls were a little doughy, next time I will place the pizza stone in the oven while it is preheating just to warm up the stone.
I used 2 tablespoons Taco Seasoning 1 from this website and added 1 tablespoon as thickener.
I also made and used Chef John's Creme Fraiche recipe from this site.
Thanks for a great recipe to satisfy our taco cravings!

Easy recipe and as my picture shows, the fellas devour it!  I add a little mild salsa to the mix and then place in the ring to bake. About 1/2 cup. Yummy!

Delicious, put a bowl of shredded lettuce in the middle and shredded cheese on top of the ring and it makes a good party platter for football season.
