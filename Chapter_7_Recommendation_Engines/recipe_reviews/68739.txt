I'm sorry for this uncomplimentary review, but this recipe just didn't work for us.  I'm giving it 2 stars only because I realize that I may have done something wrong, and the fault may have been on my end. However, the broccoli combined with a sweetish, citrusy taste just did not blend.  I didn't save the leftovers.  Sorry, Jordanali.

Delicious dinner!  Really easy to make and with the addition of sliced portabello mushrooms and sugar snap peas, along with the broccoli, it made for a yummy veggie filled stir fry.  I wasn't able to find guava nectar in my local grocery store, so I used 1/3 C. of freshly squeezed orange juice and it made for delicious sauce.  I was hoping for leftovers but the boys ate every single bite so it was a big hit in our house.  Will definately make this again.

This recipe is AMAZING!!! It was a huge hit in my home and easy to make. I felt like I made a dish that could be served in a restaurant.  I didn't have guava nectar and used agave nectar instead.  It was fabulous!
