I just made these as written & they are WONDERFUL!!! My favorite part about this cookie is it's texture. Like others have said, they don't spread- which is a MUST in my book! 10 minutes is perfect. Be sure to mix the sugars, butter, PB, egg, & vanilla first- then add the flour mixed with the soda, salt, & oats. Lastly the ch chips. Amazing cookie- thanks so much for submitting!

I doubled this recipe. I used dark chocolate chips, chunky peanut butter and added 3/4 cup of Reese's peanut butter chips and 1/2 cup chopped pecans.  I did grind half the oatmeal down in my blender only because we like the texture of it, mixed with the bigger pieces of oatmeal. The batter was still a little loose, so I did end up adding another 1/2 cup or so more oatmeal. For me, 9 minutes at 350* was the perfect time. This made 54 medium sized cookies. Good flavor, very nice. I'd make these again.

I really enjoyed this cookie as did my family.  It combines the 3 worlds of choco chip cookies, peanut btr. and oatmeal all together.  It has a wonderful balanced flavor!  Before making I read over various reviews to see what comments people had.  I noticed the ones regarding moisture being low on several of them and that the 10min mark for baking was the best.  So I swapted the measurements for the brown sugar and white sugar (brn. has more moisture in it) and baked them for the much recommended time of 10min.  They turned out wonderful. :o) Will be keeping hold of this recipe to do time and again.  Thank you

THIS IS A TRUELY GREAT CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE. THE PEANUT BUTTER TASTE IS NOT OVERWHELMING, JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT. I USED ORGANIC PURE PEANUT BUTTER WITHOUT ANY HYDROGENATED OILS BUT REGULAR sKIPPY WORKS TOO. I DIVIDED ONE BATCH AND FORMED THEM DIFFERENTLY. HALF I DID AS DROP COOKIES AND THE OTHER HALF I MADE INTO BALLS AND THEN FLATTENED THEM JUST A BIT BEFORE BAKING. WHAT A DIFFERENCE!! THE DROPPED COOKIES DID NOT HOLD THEIR SHAPE BUT THE ONES THAT I MADE INTO BALLS FIRST (AS DIRECTED) WERE PERFECT. I LEFT THEM IN THE OVEN FOR 11 MINUTES FOR A NICE SLIGHTLY CHEWY COOKIE. LEAVE THEM IN FOR 13 MINUTES AND THEY'RE CRISPY. THANK YOU JOAN FOR SHARING THIS "OUTRAGEOUS" RECIPE

We could not stop eating these cookies.  I creamed the butters and sugars +vanilla and eggs before adding dry ingredients.  I also lined my cookie sheet with parchment paper so I did not grease the pan.  I used ghirardelli bittersweet dark chocolate baking chips and it was DELICIOUS!  I will be making these again and again! ETA- This is now the only cookie recipe I use.  I am now known for these cookies and I have given the recipe out dozens of times.  I have a friend who says they are the only cookie worth eating.  You MUST try them with the ghiradelli dark chocolate chips.

This has become one of my favorite cookie recipes!  I've made them several times.  They are easy to make and taste great!  It's a nice combination of flavors and they come out perfect.... crisp on the outside, but still soft on the inside.  BTW... I've never understood why some people change the recipe by adding or deleting things ...and then give it a lower rating?!?  This one needs NO changes!  Thanks for sharing.

We all loved these cookies. I tripled the recipe, used 2 tsp. of baking soda instead of the 3 called for. I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening for a not so flat cookie but still chewy. Also, I used a mixture of semi-sweet and milk chocolate chips and some walnuts. Excellent!!!

Easy to prepare, great texture, but so not rocked by the taste. Actually instead of one great flavor cookie, you get a bland tasting combination cookie. I'll keep looking.

One of those rare recipes that delivers exactly what it's supposed to, with no tweaking and certainly no surprises.  The submitter has it right, that this is a well-balanced combination of oats, peanut butter and chocolate chips.  Gratefully, it's not too heavy on the butter and the cookies stay nice and thick after baking - I chilled the dough until fairly firm, then flattened the cookies just slightly before baking.  The cookies are soft but still chewy - not greasy, not cakey, just perfect.  A good old-fashioned cookie jar cookie. Greasing of the cookie sheets, by the way, was not necessary.

These were the best chocolate chip cookies my family said I've made! The only difference was I used the swirled chocolate & peanut butter chips.

Yummy.  Quick recipe to throw together.  Took a little longer to bake than 10 minutes but that might have been because of the size of my cookies.  I wouldn't change anything in the recipe.

These cookies are wonderful!!!  The only thing that I switched in the recipe is the white sugar measurement with the brown sugar...more brown sugar since it holds more moisture, made a very moist cookie. Oh, and I did use milk chocolate chips instead of the semi sweet.  My kids gobbled them up along with my oler biggger kid (A.K.A. my husband) They also looked very pretty as well...see my uploaded pic :) (Not flat like a lot of CC Cookies)

Withheld a five-star review only because I changed the brown sugar to 1/2 cup and the white sugar to 1/3 as one other reviewer suggested to keep the cookie from being too dry. I also increased the vanilla to 3/4 teaspoon. I used a cookie scoop to make ice cream scoop shapes on the cookie sheet which I lined with a silpat silicone baking sheet. About two minutes before I removed these from a 330 degree oven, I lightly tapped each one on top with a spatula so they "deflated" a bit. Then I pulled them out while still soft and removed immediately to a cooling rack. I lowered the oven temp because these cookies have thick centers since they don't spread much while cooking and thus require more time to set up. If you bake at 350 you may burn the bottoms before the centers are set. Tapping them toward the end of the baking time helps to speed the firming process without losing much of the thickness of the cookie and allowing you to remove them before they burn on the bottom. This cookie has a nice subtle peanut butter flavor and also a subtle oatmeal texture. It's a fantastic cookie recipe and will be one of my "go to" cookie recipes now. Really wonderful recipe.

I had 5 hungry little girls over after school, and after one bite they all said they were horrible and threw them away. I have to agree with them, they don't taste like chocolate chip cookies, they don't taste like peanut butter cookies or oatmeal cookies, they are just kind of blah. I'm searching for the perfect chocolate chip cookie and this isn't it. Sorry.

Yum. Awesome recipe as is. We are big fans of oatmeal/peanut butter/chocolate chip combination in cookies and these definitely do not disappoint. I do prefer to use only brown sugar (2/3 cup is plenty), half whole wheat flour, an extra handful of oats, and no more than 3/4 cup chocolate chips. This makes a heartier, healthier cookie, imo. Ten minutes at 350 is perfect. My batch yielded 28 cookies.

Joan, I'm afraid I tried this recipe and it tasted like salt. I am a professional in this business and am quite sure cookies are supposed to be sweet. I wasted a whole afternoon making this concoction and I also burnt my finger. I followed the instructions to a T and the cookies were terrible. However I picked out the chocolate chips and they tasted fine. Sincerely Chef Del Cazia*

A good recipe. This is basically a peanut butter cookie with chocolate chips and a few sprinkles of oatmeal. So don't expect a chocolate chip cookie because that texture just isn't here, but if you're a peanut butter cookie fan, you'll enjoy this cookie's texture. I was disappointed in the oatmeal component. I think the flavor would have been enhanced had there been more oatmeal and/or if the oatmeal had been powdered. The way the recipe stands, there just isn't enough oatmeal flavor like you'd expect.

We absolutely love these!  I gave my husband one of these when he got home and the first thing he said was "I hate peanut butter cookies!"  i was disappointed until he said, "but these are freakin fantastic!!!"  I made mine with chocolate chunks instead of chips, ground the oatmeal into a powder before adding it, and also added walnuts and they were amazing!!  my family doesnt like oatmeal in their cookies and they had no idea that it was even in there and it gave the cookies a wonderful consistency!  very chewy and delicious!!  highly recommended!

This is one of the best cookie recipes I have tried from this site so far! Followed the recipe with the exception of adding about 1/8 teaspoon of Cream of Tartar with the dry ingredients (I read somewhere that it helps with the crackled look on top.) I made these a little larger (cooked 14 min in my oven) and ended up with 2 dozen cookies. Slightly crunchy edges, soft centers, great flavors....perfect cookie! I make these every couple of months and will continue. Thanks for sharing!

fantastic! These are my new favorite cookies. They are delicious! One little change I would make to the recipe...they need to bake in oven for 15-18 min. Other than that, wonderful!

WOW!  I just pulled my first batch of these out of the oven and ate my first cookie.  These are fabulous!  I made a double batch and added a bit of extra flour as I like a more cake-like texture.  They came out moist on the inside and crispy around the edges.  A perfect mixture of flavors and textures.  This is bound to be a new favorite cookie.  Highly recommended!

These cookies are perfection!    We loved them!  Can't believe that anyone would give them a bad review.  I made them exactly as listed, except switched the white/brown sugar measurements, and used chunky peanut butter instead of smooth.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I don't usually comment on recipes, but felt the need to comment here. I made these based on the high number of positive reviews. 

I have to say, I don't get it. I'll eat almost any cookie, and cookies barely last a day in my house - and I don't even want to eat these.

I made these following the recipe exactly. The texture is off - the oatmeal makes them slightly al dente / chewy, but not enough to have the texture of a traditional oatmeal cookie. They just feel rubbery. There's not remotely enough chocolate in here to call them outrageous "chocolate chip" cookies. I think I agree with the other reviewers who would've preferred separate oatmeal, peanut butter, and chocolate chip cookies. I'm all for the combination / "monster" cookies, but sadly this one just didn't work for me. Won't make it again.

Very tasty cookies!!!! I'll definitely be making them again. They are outrageously good. The perfect texture...soft on the top, but crunchy on the bottom. Even if they look a little soft, they eventually harden up so don't overcook.

Original review from 2004...Oh My Goodness!!!  These are the best cookies I've ever made!!  Definately a new favorite!!!

Update...2017
Still my favorite cookie recipe. I follow the directions exactly. I bake for 11 minutes and then let them cool in the pan for 4 minutes before transferring to a cooling rack. They come out perfect every time!

Amazing! There are just a few things that I love more than chocolate and peanut. I used natural peanut and about 1/4 extra oats. These were amazing and I love the fact that there are oats. Next time I might try to sneak in some whole wheat flour. I didn't get 18 cookies because the dough is equally tasty!

Don't touch the recipe with your improvements... Their is no need. Great combination! A big hit at the office (I was sure to post that peanut butter was in the cookies). Thanks for the recipe!

Amazing!!!!! I just made these for my kids and they could have eaten 20 each! Not only are these fast, easty and fool proof, they are moist and taste divine. I doubled the vanilla and put in more chips than called for. (Hey, what is a chocolate chip cookie but a vehicle for eating chocolate!). I will be making these again very soon.

Great cookie!  Not as moist as a regular chocolate chip cookie.  It's like a peanut butter cookie combined with a chocolate chip cookie as far as texture and taste.  (Go figure huh?)

My husband doesn't like oatmeal cookies and he doesn't like peanut butter cookies so you wouldn't think he would like these. I made them today and he loved them! I'm glad to find a recipe that combines three of my favorite things, (peanut butter, chocolate, and oatmeal), into a truly amazing cookie that we both enjoy. Thanks for sharing it :)

By far the best Chocolate Chip cookie recipe I know! For a nice texture twist I use Crunchy peanut butter instead of creamy. Delicious!

Also, they are so simple and quick, I make them with my 2 year old daughter for a qick and easy treat.

The cookies turned out very nice.  I added a bit more peanut butter and a few more chocolate chips.  The texture was a little different with the oats, but they were still delicious!

Turned out great.  I was a little worried because the batter was so thick, and crumbly, but the cookies turned out great.  They may not look done after 12 minutes, but take them out to cool anyway, they get harder.

These cookies are excellent.  I followed the recipe exactly, baking for 10 minutes.  They are NOT bland at all as others have said.  The peanut butter is not overwhelming but just right.  I am at high altitude (4900 feet) and no changes are needed.  I will be using this recipe over and over again!! Thanks Joan!

Perfect.  These will fill ya up and are a great hearty cookie.  I used natural organic pb and added some flax seed.  Cut back the sugar a bit using organic also.  Loved by whole family.  Thanks for sharing.

Made this for the 1st time yesterday, double the batch, made 6 dozen.  Took 2 dozen to my parents house yesterday, they disappeared within minutes.  Everyone loved them!!! I did cut back on a 1/4 cup of white sugar and added more brown sugar.  Also, added 2 tbs of ground flax seed, 1/2 tsp of ground cinnamon, used whole wheat flour, and Hershey's special dark chocolate chips.  These are most definitely winners in my book.  My two favorite cookies right now are these and Oatmeal chip cookies (also on this site).  They are now my go to cookie recipes!

Great cookie.  I loved the combination of chocolate, oats and peanut butter.  Nice change from a traditional chocolate chip cookie.  My family liked the texture too - not too chewy, not too crispy - just right!

Awesome!   Recommend using dark brown sugar as it adds moisture instead of regular brown sugar.  Plus I ran out of vanilla extract and used a splash of maple syrup as a substitute and surprised how great it was.   Thanks!

These cookies were great. I do agree with others that they did crumble a little bit, but the overall effect compared to the traditional nestle chocolate chip recipe, so much better. Definitely a favorite and well requested cookie in our household.

These cookies were outrageously yummy! The only change i made was i used vanilla granola instead of oats (because I realized I was out of oats) and they turned out beautifully.  I also used crunchy peanut butter...loved the bits of peanut in there with the chocolate :)

I think these are great cookies! If you like choc/pb/oatmeal then you will like these. The texture and taste is good.  I baked mine for 12 minutes. I did switch the brown/white sugar mixture around ( too add more brown sugar). otherwise made as written. I bet they will taste even better tomorrow. To me, cookies usually taste better the next day after sitting awhile.  MmmMmmmm would be great with a big glass of milk.  Do keep in mind that there isn't much oatmeal in them, so they are not your typical oatmeal cookie. I wonder if you could add 2 cups of oatmeal instead of just one?

Delicious!  I thought there might be too many chocolate chips, but it wasn't.  I doubled this recipe and had to hide some of them to keep the kids and dh from eating them all the first day!  They can be put in a ziplock bag and then I stored them in a tupperware container for a couple weeks and they were still fresh as can be.    This combo is really good and the peanut butter isn't overly peanutty.  Thanks for this recipe!

These were simple to make and great tasting. I'd probably add more peanut butter and oats, but that's just me. I used Nestle 53% Cacao Dark Chocolate Chips instead of semi-sweet since they were on sale at the store, and the cookies were soooo rich! I got the seal of approval from my parents and sister and well.. I'm giving the seal of approval myself!

These are absolutely the best cookies I have ever made. I took them for an office party and they were the first things to go. i was told they tasted as if I picked them up at the bakery on my way. I had to do some convincing that I really did make them. I did double the recipe and rolled the dough into balls so they would look prettier. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly.

Very good.  Brought them to a Community Service Event I planned for 12 co-workers.   Some didn't have any, but those that tried them all seemed to go back for more.  Next time I will try using Chunky Peanut Butter.  But, "make no mistake," these were fine as is.

Excellent!  Everyone loved them!  I even used reduced fat peanut butter and they were still good.  Next time, I'll use regular peanut butter and milk chocolate chips, I bet they'll be even better!

Baked true to the recipe and they turned out great! They don't flatten, and if you leave them in the oven for 11 minutes, then on the tray for one, they are just right :) Great taste too!

I have had this exact recipe for years and made it often when our girls were living at home.  Do not make cookies now but highly recommend this one. Good to see it in print.  Also it is easy.

I loved this recipe.  The only thing I changed is I flipped the sugars ... 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/3 cup of white sugar as one reviewer suggested.  Also, when I creamed the butter and sugars, my butter was hard from the fridge so I sliced it in thin slivers and it melted super fast and creamed well.  I used a small ice cream scooper to spoon them onto a non-stick baking sheet so they were fairly large.  It took about 14 minutes to bake and they were perfect.  My husband and daughters were raving about them and said they were just like the best bakeries in town.  This one is a keeper.  I loved the combination of the peanut butter (I used creamy), oatmeal, and chocolate.  The flavor was very subtle and delicious.  Thanks so much for a great recipe.

These cookies were okay. They were moist, but I wasn't overwhelmed by the taste and didn't care for the texture. Probably will not make these again.

Just getting back into Baking...tried this recipe because I had most of the ingredients ON HAND.......I even raised recipe to 72 servings (if you're gonna back may as well make it worth the mess).  I gave it a 5 star rating even though I did quite of bit of substituting and the first baked batch didn't turn out.  For example I used 1/2 butter 1/2 margarine...less peanut butter...3/4 regular flour & 1/4 whole wheat flour....even substituted milled flax seed and water for 1 egg (my recipe called for 4 eggs).....long story short....first batch came out yucky, flat, and greasy.  I added quite a bit more flour (both whole wheat and regular) and more oatmeal.  That made it more like cookie dough rather than a cake mix texture.  I put the bowl in the fridge while a batch baked because it was a little hot in the kitchen and I didn't want it to get 'softer'.  Important to let cookies cool ON the pan a good 10 minutes before removing.  I believe they'll continue to bake without browning as they cool down.  Excellent results in the end...6 1/2 dozen cookies in the freezer with enough left out to eat right now! :)....LESSON I LEARNED FROM THIS RECIPE....Follow A Recipe or be prepared...to make additional adjustments or....face disappointment!  Thank You! NOTE ADDED:  Cookies came out of freezer tasting WONDERFUL!! Great recipe to make and keep on hand for unexpected company or parties.

i can't believe this recipe got 86 great reviews....a complete waste of ingredients.  these cookies turned out so flat you could see through them. they burned on the edges because they spread out so thin...and that was at 10 minutes. WOW!

Although I like peanut butter cookies, oatmeal cookies, and chocolate chip cookies, I wasn't sure I would like them all rolled into one.  I read through all the reviews and since 99% of them raved about these cookies I was swayed to give them a try.  They are very easy to make.  Because the original recipe stated it only made 18 cookies, I doubled the recipe.  I got about 8 dozen average size cookies so following the original portions, I would have gotten about 4 dozen.  If the person who submitted the recipe only got 18 cookies, she must have been making them the size of platters.  The cookies baked up very nicely.  However, I'm afraid I'm in the minority in that I was not "wowed" by these cookies.  They really didn't seem to have any kind of distinct taste.  The oatmeal was very prominent--in texture, more so than taste.  I really couldn't taste the peanut butter (and, yes, I did double it).  One reviewer commented that there were too many chocolate chips.  I thought the proportion of chips (and, yes, I did double those as well) was fine.  I probably won't make these again.  I guess I'm a "cookie purist"--like my chocolate chip cookies, peanut butter cookies, and oatmeal cookies just as they are.

Gorgeous cookies.  I baked mine on parchment paper.  Also, used half butter and half butter flavored Crisco with 1.5 T of water.  13 minutes was perfect and I let the set in the pan for two minutes before removing them to a rack.  Really a nice looking, soft cookie.

The taste was good but they were super-thin and broke too easily. Would not make again. The only change I made was to reduce the amount of chocolate chips, which should not affect the outcome.

Cookies came out good..... but my dough was DRY! I ended up adding applesauce to batter which helped but I think I will add milk and applesauce next time. Also added a few butterscotch chips due to my son stealing a few choco chips out of the dough, that WAS A GREAT IDEAL the butterscotch really made them good!

These are seriously good cookies!  They have a little bit of everything you could want in a cookie.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and swapped the sugar measurements, using more brown sugar than white.  I don't know what they taste like the other way, but they're REALLY good that way!  I used mini chocolate chips and they pretty much guarantee some chocolate in every bite.  I used a large cookie scoop and 10.5 minutes in the oven and a few minutes on the tray = perfect texture.  YUM!!!

These are delicious! I always make a double batch for showers, potlucks, meetings, family functions... and everyone loves them! 
Sometimes I use half peanut butter chips, and half chocolate chips, but they turn out great either way.

These just came out of the oven and they are fabulous!  Per Sarah Jo's review, I found that I needed to add another 1/4-1/3 cup of oats as the batter was pretty wet/sticky.  I also reversed the ratios of brown and white sugar.  I read a few reviews that mentioned a bland flavor so I increased the vanilla to 1 tsp and the salt to 3/4 tsp.  These have great flavor and are soft and chewy; my new favorite cook recipe!

Just finished making these.  I switched the brown sugar and sugar measurements (used 1/3 cup of sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar) because some comments warned of dry dough.  Other than that I stuck to the recipe and they are delicious!  If I were to make these again I might add some cocoa power or some peanut butter chips (instead of chocolate chips or do a half and half combo) or some mocha.  I think that would put these cookies over the top!

I just loved the idea of putting chocolate & peanut butter together. this was the best tasting cookie I have made in such a long time. Using the chunky peanut butter was even a good idea. will be making these again & again.

Great cookie for the mix of ingredients. I like them but I don't love them. The texture and everything is good but it just isn't for me. I froze most of them to give to visitors. I like to microwave some cookies to present warm with a nice cup of coffee.

Absolutely love these cookies. I made them for my husband who is training in the Navy. He said they only lasted a few hours because his friends couldn't stop eating them, so I made a special batch just for his friends. Very similar to a "monster" cookie except no peanuts or m & m's. I recommend cooking 10 minutes and them let them cool. They will continue cooking once you take them out of the oven. This makes for a softer and more moist cookie. Thanks for sharing.

I made these exactly as the recipe says, and I baked them for 12 minutes.  They're PERFECT.  They're crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  My son asked if I could make these every time from now on LOL!  I'm at more than 6000 ft elevation, so for anyone doing high elevation baking, these turn out great!

These cookies are AMAZING! So easy to make and they turned out perfect. My husband is a huge fan of peanut butter cookies so has tried his share of different recipes. He said that these cookies were by far the best cookies I have ever made and quite possibly the best cookies he's ever had! That's a winner in my book. Oh and I loved them too, which makes them all the better! Don't change a thing, the recipe is perfect.

These cookies are tasty, but we're more of a chewy cookie family. These were a bit dry for our taste. They're still pretty good with milk though

I just made these for the second time :) This is one of the best cookie recipes, for sure! I'm really picky when it comes to home-made cookies. They must be bakery quality. These definitely live up to that standard. The only change to the recipe I made is, I used margarine instead of butter. Yummmmm....  :P

I'm a VERY late bloomer cooking-wise. This was my first foray into the world of baking from scratch and this recipe left me with an excellent taste in my mouth (and my husband's, his co-workers, and my co-workers). I followed the recipe exactly and the results were better than I had hoped. And it was fun creaming the butter, brown sugar, and white sugar with my hands just like Mom and I used to!

Exact quote from hubby "Those are insanely tasty!!" - The only change I made was to double the recipe for a larger batch and I am sure glad that I did!!  Thank you for this recipe!  A perfect combo of chocolate, peanut butter and texture.  Love 'em!

Delicious!  I can't stop eating them!  But, definitely use unsalted butter if adding the salt or vice versa.

These are soooo good! The only thing I did differently was double the vanilla, and I used milk chocolate chips instead of semisweet. I made a double batch...and I'm glad I did, because these were all gone in a day!!

followed directions to the letter on all accounts except for the peanut butter and chocolate chips. I usually toss a little more than a recipe calls for when it comes to those two ingredients if it's for a cook because more is ok in this case. Simple recipe, tasty right out of the oven. I don't have an electric hand blender and sometimes find cookie recipes give me a work out. This was not hard to work with at all.

These cookies were sooo good right out the oven I had to run and write a review. Followed recipe exactley except doubled it and used a little less choco. chips(didn't think I could cram anymore in). Turned out beautiful. They're not too flat and brown up perfectly. Hope there just as good the next day.

AWESOME!!! My hubs is the baker in the house and he makes a cookie similar to this one. We decided to give these a try as well. When he makes these he switches the white and brown sugar measurements around but follows the recipe exact besides that! We're at high altitude and these cookies turn out PERFECT and don't last long either!!

These cookies were awesome. The oats gave it an incredible texture, and switching the amounts of sugar and brown sugar as suggested made them nice and chewy. Thanks for a keeper! :)

I have been looking for a great cookie w/the chocolate chip, peanut butter, oatmeal combination.  Well, this is the PERFECT one!  The cookies are soft and taste delicious.  I bake cookies all the time and I have a hard time finding one that meets my high standards.  This one did and I will bake them again and again.  Thanks so much for sharing!

Absolutley perfect! I took them to a playdate and every mom there asked me for the recipe. I followed the recipe exactly and they were wonderful. I was a little worried because the batter looked a little to dry and crumbly, but I baked them anyway and they came out perefectly.

This is a very good chocolate chip cookie. I guess I was looking for something with more oatmeal. But everyone loves the "new" chocolate chip cookie. The peanut butter isn't overpowering, a nice balance.

These cookies are pretty fabulous. The dough is super easy to work with when done exactly as the recipe says. I found that 9 minutes was the perfect baking time for me, and since they do not spread I tapped them down with the bottom of a measuring cup just as they came out of the oven the removed them quickly from the pan.
I used quick cooking oats and the texture was good, but would definitely try with rolled oats for a more pronounced texture.

Good cookies...I took one reviewer's advice and used 1/2 c. of brown sugar and 1/3 c. of white sugar.  I formed the dough into small, flattened balls.  I got about 3 dozen cookies, instead of the 18 cookies the recipe said it would yield.

I have made these twice now and by far, this has to be my favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe...I followed the recipe exactly and these cookies turned out great! They look and taste wonderful so I would highly recommend this recipe! I Left the cookies in the oven for about 10 minutes then let them cool on the pan to continue cooking and that seemed to work out well. Thank you!

Oooohhhhhhh these are so good.  The only change I made was I used butter flavored shortening instead of butter. They turned out so good... big and chunky! They're the best cookies I've made.  Hands down.

These are the best cookies ever! I added a bit more peanut butter and a bit more vanilla.  The cookies do crumble a bit, but just let them cool before taking them off the cookie sheet or stone. I definately recommend this recipe!

Great cookies.  Just got the first ones out of the oven and my 9 year old grandson is eating his first one.  He said its very good.  Was easy to mix, I made the exact recipe except I doubled it.  with grandkids around they will go quick.  I don't understand the ones who thought the dough was dry and crumbly. My dough was perfect for the cookies and I love that they stayed puffy and not running out flat all over the cookie sheet.  And they are chewy not crispy.  I love the taste and predict I will make these many times.  They are going into my recipe book as a 'keeper'.

These were good. I cooked them for 10 mins & they were very crisp so I lowered the time to 9 min & they were still crisp. Maybe next time I will cook them for 8 min. I used my electric hand beater & beat each of the ingrediants 2 at a time & stirred in the oats & chocolate chips. Thanks.

Mmm mm mm!  These are fantastic!  After reading others' reviews, I decided to double the recipe and added 1 cup of semisweet chips & 1 cup milk chocolate chips - it's a nice combination.  I ran out of vanilla (I've been baking every day this week!) so I found some brandy & tossed some in.  Also, I prefer a flatter cookie so I made them larger (about a tblsp) and flattened them a bit.  It came out perfectly round.  I'll be making this one again.  Thanks for the recipe!

I was skeptical about the flavors at first but this is a very delectable cookie.  Great if you chill dough for a moment and then use a cookie scoop for evenly spread cookies.  The taste has a good balance of sweet and savory.  The texture is on the ball for what you want in a cookie:  Crunchy on the outside and soft and chewy in the middle.  I'm going to try making these a little bigger next time to test out with the texture.  Good recipe.

I just popped these out of the oven and they are FANTASTIC. I didn't change a thing, and these came out very tasty with a nice texture. I used chunky peanut butter as that was all I had, but if you have the choice I'd suggest not using that as the peanuts kind of take away from the oats and the chips in the cookie. Delicious anyways.

Wow! Great Recipe. I used Splenda in my recipe instead, and I beat the ingredients (minus the chocolate chips) then I folded the chips in. I rolled then into balls first, and then flattened the balls on the cookie sheets. The cookies don't move very much, so what you see is what you get. It turns out to be a beautiful cookie. To cut down on the grease, use natural peanut butter instead.

SOOOOOO good!!! I made no changes to recipe and they are outstanding!!! Thanks for a great treat! I doubled the recipe for bigger cookies. One note- they are fragile when they come out of the oven- let them sit before moving to the cooling rack.

these were a lovely cookie to make...so incredibly easy.  I used reduced fat pb, as that is all I had on hand and they came out perfect.  I used more than 1 cup of chips and used a combination of a bunch of hangers-on odd/ends.  (toffee bits, butterscotch, mini, peanut butter, milk chocolate, special dark chocolate chunks) and the combination of chips was really nice.  Peanut butter was not overpowering; all the ingredients complimented each other, and did not stick to the cookie scoop when putting them on the pans which made for a fast batch of cookies to make.  Made 36 medium cookie-scoop size.  Took 12 minutes on the Airbake cookie sheet, and 10 minutes on the Oneida non-stick.  They are delicate when they first come out of the oven and leaving them on the sheet to cool for a couple of minutes helped them come off in 1 piece.

My husband wouldn't stop eating these cookies and his friends at work ate all he brought and wanted him to bring more the next day. I doubled the recipe and used an equal amount of oatmeal and flour. Next time I may use more oatmeal than flour. I used crunchy peanut butter, but next time may use smooth peanut butter and add walnuts. These are definitely a family favorite.

Absolutely Awesome Cookies!!! They taste soooo good! They do not flatten, are very easy to make, and taste very good.  I overbaked one sheet (only because I didn't set the timer and forgot about them)so they were quite browned and hard, but they were still excellent with a glass of milk!  Thanks for the OUTRAGEOUS recipe!!!

The mixture is way too dry. I followed it exactly and I think the problem is not enough egg and too much sugar..

These cookies are outrageous! Outrageously delicious. Just the right mix of peanut butter, oatmeal and chocolate chips. Wouldn't change a thing about them.

Thought these were great!  I made them to take into the office twice and both times a total hit!  I read a few reviews that thought the dough was a little wet so I added a little more oatmeal until I had the consistency that I could roll into balls like a more traditional peanut butter cookie and they were just perfect.  In fact I like these so much that I FINALLY created a login for allrecipes after looking at this site for years and this is my first official review!

I will admit, I was looking for a "whole" cookie. A cookie with chocolate chips, oatmeal, even sime nuts. Well ladies and gentlemen.....I still haven't found it. This was a GREAT recipe, I was skeptic at first and a little nervous with the bad reviews, but they turned to be one of my new favorites maybe! I used 1 1/2 cup of oatmeal, and in my opinion, that made them better. I would recommend doubling the batch. They are VERY GOOD!! :)

I am a terrible baker, but these came out PERFECT. Didn't deviate from the recipe at all, although I baked the first batch for 12 minutes and they were a bit too dry and crumbly; did the second batch for 9 minutes, and they were exactly as we like them. Loved that they weren't too sweet, and also really enjoyed the texture of the oatmeal. Would be interested to make them with crunchy peanut butter next time. Thanks so much, Joan!

I don't know how, but I always mess up cookies.  These were awesome! I didn't have oats, so I just baked without and they still turned out well.  Thanks for the recipe!

My family loved these.  One of my sons even said this may be his new favorite, so I will be making these again!  I made the recipe as written, doubled the recipe to use a whole bag of chips.  Mine took 13 minutes per pan.

I was not impressed with this recipe. I'm a mother with two girls one being 19 and the youngest still at home and my girls are the real cookie monsters a cookie doesn't stand a chance in my house. I said that to say to say, I have made more recipes  than I can think about and this one has a dense taste and not that good to me.

These are amazing. They have the best of everything in the world of cookies: chocolate chips, peanut butter, and oats. I used mini chips and chunky peanut butter and they came out perfect. The only problem I see with them is I doubt there will be any left tomorrow LOL

Reading some of the negative reviews I was very worried about the cookies being too dry. It wasn't dry, but I can see why people think it's "sandy".

I decided to try 2 methods of baking. I baked a few in little balls, and a few flattened. I prefer the way the flattened cookies turned out. 

I loved how there was just a hint of peanut butter, not overwhelming flavor like most peanut butter cookies have.

I prefer eating cookie dough over cookies, and the dough was just a little too creamy for my taste.

These were really good but not as peanutty as I expected. Dough was crumbly and melted as it was sitting on the counter between batches. I needed to keep it in the freezer until the next batch went into the oven.

This is a perfect recipe! I actually added an additional 1/2 cup of oats which gave them a little more chewiness in the center and crunch on the edges. They came out best with an all natural peanut butter...not so good with the Jiff.

These cookies are delicious- the perfect amounts of peanut butter, chocolate, and oatmeal- and they're easy to make. In addition, I didn't have to do any special shopping for the ingredients; I had them all already.

These are so good and I love that they don't spread so they have a nice thick middle. I just wish that they had more of a PB flavor. I could barley tell there was PB in them.

These are great!!  I loved that they didn't spread.  I flattened mine a little with a spoon after spooning them on the cookie sheet. This made them a little crunchier, without drying them out.

New family favorite!! We are a family of six, so I doubled the recipe and used 1 cup of brown sugar, 2/3 cup white sugar, and 2 cups of oatmeal. Everyone raved over them. The recipe made 50 large cookies. I woke up this morning and only 4 were left! My husband is on his way to the store to buy stuff for me to make more!

LOVED THE COOKIES AND SO DID THE REST OF MY FAMILY.  I MADE THEM WITH A GLUTEN FREE FLOUR MIX AND THEY TURNED OUT GREAT. THE ONLY THING I CHANGED WAS I USED 1/4C WHITE SUGAR AND 1/2C OF BROWN SUGAR. WHEN YOU USE A GF FLOUR MIX W/BROWN RICE FLOUR THEY HAVE A TENDENCY TO BE DRY. THE BROWN SUGAR HAS MOISTURE SO IT GAVE THEM THR MOISTURE THAT IS NEEDED. THANKS JOAN FOR A GREAT RECIPE.

very excellent combination... great taste great texture.. I baked mine ten minutes until the edge just started to slightly turn brown, then cool on the pan for ten minutes.. I would however definitely recommend rolling into a ball and flattening... yes your cookie will be more dense and you won't get as many but when I dropped mine they did not spread at all and didn't look the best... rolled the presentation was amazing and the texture and taste was still good... great version of chocolate chip cookies

This recipe has a very good balance of all the flavors: it doesn't take like an oatmeal cookie, a peanut butter cookie, or a chocolate chip cookie.  It has it's own taste and texture in which all of those types of cookies are perfectly combined.  I have tried many a cookie recipe in my day, and this is one of the best.

Amazing cookies!  The only thing I changed was to make them dairy free by using Earth Balance in place of butter and lower cholesterol by using Egg Beaters in place of eggs.  I will make these again and again.

Very nice cookie. I froze the extra batter in a roll to have a quick option for later. I also halved the Baking Soda because I don't like the taste of it in baked good, I couldn't tell it was there, and the cookies came out the same.

I am fifty four years old and I have had a cookie or two in my life. But these are by far the best. Chocolate chip ,Peanut butter and Oatmeal are great alone but together they are awesome. They could give Famous Amos a run for their money.

Great recipe!  It was a nice mix of a peanut butter and chocolate chip cookie.  I made it today with my daughter.  We followed the directions exactly with one exception. We added a dash of cinnamon to the dry ingredients before mixing in. I'm sure it would have been just as good without the cinnamon.  My very picky son said they were the best cookies we've ever made.

Awesome. These came out perfect!  Nice and thick cookies.   I made them extra large size using 1/4 cup of dough per cookie and baked for about 15-16 minutes.

Thes are great cookies!  I doubled the peanut butter, used 1/2 the amount of chocolate chips, and used Crisco butter flavor instead of butter.  They looked really pretty and they were the perfect combination of flavors.  This is a keeper for sure.

Very yummy!  I made these a bit bigger than the recipe suggested and still only baked them for 10 minutes.   I also used 1/2 cup of dark chocolate chips and 1/2 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips.  Also a little bit more peanut butter, just a couple spoonfuls!  Other reviewers said these cookies don't move- mine did a bit... probably because the extra peanut butter addition.  I still would have liked a more peanut butter taste... it's quite subtle!  I would give my version 5 stars!

These are my mother's absolute favorite chocolate chip cookies! I like how they're not defined by any of the ingredients (oatmeal/peanut butter), but are simply a wonderfully chewy cooky. 
My only issue with this recipe is that they taste SO much better fresh out of the oven-- they're not so showstopping cooled as they are hot.

This is my new recipe for chocolate chip cookies!  I am amazed at what adding peanut butter does to these cookies. You can't taste the peanut butter, but it gives it the best flavor.  Doubled the recipe, and didn't change anything.  All were gone in a few days.

Just made these and they are delicious! I mistakenly made them before dinner and I don't think my husband will be eating much for dinner as he has already had three of these. He asked me to please take them away as he couldn't stop:) the only change I made was using instant oats as that's all I had, still very good.

An excellent cookie recipe, combining my two favorite things: chocolate and peanut butter.  I whipped these up last night to satisfy a chocolate fix, and it really hit the spot!  These cookies are chewy, and decadent.  

I used quick oats rather than old fashioned because I've got picky eaters that otherwise would have turned up their noses at obvious oats in the cookies.  They were a hit!

Today, after sitting in tupperware for a day, the outside of the cookies have a very light crunch to them, but still remain soft and chewy in the middle.

For those who keep reviewing that this made WAY more than 18 cookies.... The serviing size is 18.  The recipe yields 3 dozen (36). So a serving is two cookies :)

These cookies are absolutely delicious.  You really don't have to change a thing in terms of ingredients.  The only thing I would suggest is that you roll the cookies into balls and then flatten them a little bit with a fork... they spread great by doing this.  They are full of melt-watering flavor!  I cooked mine for the 12 minutes and they came out with slightly crispy outsides and soft insides - perfect!

I made this with white chocolate chips (all I had). They were Amazing. Don't press them witha  fork like you would Peanut Butter cookies, they will be to crisp (unless that is what you like). These might be the best cookies I ever had.

YUM... a very good cookie.. I added a little bit more peanut butter because it was already on the spoon... :)

This was like three of my favorite cookies rolled into one cookie... delicious!

best choco chip recipe i have encountered... i have made it twice so far and everyone who tried them loved them. they come out very soft and chewy. The secontime i made them i only used 1/2 cup of choco chips and 1/2 cup of heath bar chips, it give it a nice little candy crunch in the soft chewy cookie.i will make this often.

We really enjoyed these cookies. After reading the reviews, I added 2 tbsp of local honey to mine to up the moisture content. I also used organic PB and nixed the salt as I was using salted butter. They turned out fantastic. My husband who usually refuses to eat cookies with PB in them, wolfed down 4 and then stole half of mine. Can't get a better recommendation than that.

Love these!!! I tinkered a bit too. I used a combo of Whole Wheat, All-Purpose and Buckwheat flours, and reduced the sugar. I used 2/3 Cup of Oatmeal, and added 2Tablespoons of milk. I got perfect, pretty, light (but not at all dry) cookies that are my new favorite recipe ever!!! Thank you!

Very yummy cookies! I added M&M's which was a great addition. These cookies are better if they are on the rare side. I baked them for 10 minutes and they were perfect! Delicious!

These were very good!  I made as is, aside from swapping out the white sugar for brown.  Im going to consider them 'healthy' for the oats and the peanut butter.  I imagine they could be made moreso with some wheat germ and ground flax or something.  Delicious cookies!

I finally found the recipe that combines oatmeal, peanut butter, and chocolate chips and tastes GREAT!  My husband, (whose usual comment about something good is " its okay"), RAVED about these cookies.  I didn't change a thing, and will definitely make these over and over.  Thanks for a great recipe.

These are really good cookies. I highly recommend them! I also like that they have less butter than most cookie recipes as well as rolled oats. They are obviously not healthy, but at least they are a step in the right direction!

What could be bad about this cookie?  Part peanut butter, part oatmeal, part chocolate chip!!  They are delicious, and they turn out looking store bought!  Family loved them, and I loved them.

The peanut butter overpowered the chocolate chips, and the oatmeal was dry and hard. I think I'll stick to just plain chocolate chip cookies.

My family loved this cookie and it was easy and quick to make.  Only reason why i didn't give it five stars is because i thought it was a bit too sweet for my taste but my daughter loved them.

Fantastic cookie recipe! I followed the recipe exactly, except I used dark chocolate chips! They took 12 minutes rather than 10, but they were AMAZING! Perfect combo of chocolate, peanut butter and oats, no one flavor overwhelmed the other. Will definitely be making them again!

I made these today with my granddaughter and we both loved them. I doubled the recipe, and since I didn't have a cup full of chocolate chips I used chocolate, peanut butter and white chocolate chips. I used a cookie scoop and we flattened them out a little and they turned out perfect.

I found these a bit ordinary. I have had better for sure, but my other half liked them. They weren't terrible, just sort of bland.

AMAZING!! Simple, fast, and easily the BEST cookies I have ever made. I didn't have the oats on hand and didn't feel like driving out to go get some, so I just omitted them from the recipe. The texture of the cookie was still chewy and perfect. Just two notes: next time, I will use less chocolate chips (I think probably 3/4 cup is enough) and be careful of the baking time! I left mine in for a few minutes two long and one batch came out a little burned on the bottom.

very very yummm! I couldn't wait till these had cooled, they smelled divine in the oven, and tasted even better. Followed the recipe exactly, no changes needed. Perfect as is....and highly addictive. I didn't drop spoonsful onto the baking sheet but rather made a rough lump in my hand and flattened slightly for each cookie. Took them out the oven at about 15mins, centre slightly chewy and just right!

After seeing all of the stars and the rave reviews, I expected this to be one of the most amazing cookies I've ever tasted...but it definitely fell short.  The texture was OK, but it didn't have much flavor at all.  I've definitley made better cookies, and I won't waste my time or ingredients on this recipe again.

I made a batch of these cookies for our church coffee time and they smelled really good and looked delicious, so I am planning on making another batch for our house. Thanks to the person for submitting the recipe. I ended up with 24 cookies counted(I used an ice cream scoop for the rounded teaspoons.).

I made enough to bring to work, and everyone loved these cookies. I use 1/4 cup butter and a 1/4 cup natural, no sugar added apple sauce, and no one even noticed. Great recipe -- and so simple! Thanks so much for posting.

Fool proof recipe!  I used fresh ground peanut butter, and normally I don't get as good of results, but it's worth it to me.  I can't image these turning out any better with jiffy! Wow!

This is a very forgiving recipe!  I've added chopped pecans with good success.  Warning though- they are tough to keep in the cookie jar- I've made them twice this week for my kids!

Holy moly!!! These turned out AMAZING!! Made exactly as directed (though I did flip the brown/white sugar quantities) and they are delicious! It's really the best of the cookie world - chocolate chip, peanut butter and oatmeal, all in one. LOVE THESE!

Pretty tasty if you like oatmeal, oats give the cookie height, texture, dimension, while the pb to flour ratio is just right! I decreased the butter 1 tbsp because I am at a higher elevation.

Ohhhhh!!!   This is one good cookie!!  And I loved that they came out of the oven nice and plump – not flat!  I made the recipe reversing the amounts of brown and white sugar as suggested by other reviewers.  I also used maybe 2-3 T. more oats just to use up what was left in the box.  I baked mine for 10 minutes on parchment paper and yielded 30 smallish cookies using my cookie scoop.  I’ll need to get these into the freezer before I eat too many.  Although that may not keep me out of them, because I have been known to eat cookies directly from the freezer, but don’t tell, ok?!!

My boyfriend has forbidden me to ever make these cookies again because we inhaled nearly the whole batch and gained five pounds on the spot.  In fact I had to fight him off the cookie dough when I was spooning them onto the cookie sheet.  What a fantastic recipe.  All the great cookie flavors together in the perfect blend, with excellent texture and substance.  I baked them 12 minutes.  Positively outstanding.

These were quite delicious, even though I substituted half the butter with applesauce, cut the sugar down to 1/4c white and 1/4c brown and used half white and half whole wheat pastry flour.

REALLY delicious!!! Big hit with everyone!! But it definetly didnt yeild the 3 doz it claims....I got about 18 cookies the first time around. The second time I made them I changed a couple things slightly...I switched the quantities of the sugars and used more brown then white and I added more oats as I felt they were a bit "meatier" that way. And I added peanut chips in addition to the chocolate chips and I used crunchy peanut butter. They were soooo delish! My neighbour said "You have to make more of theses and tripple the recipe so I can have more."

These cookies are FANTASTIC!  I followed advice and switched the sugars.  I had 1/3 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown.  I also baked these for 10 minutes as suggested.  They came out gooey and perfect!  My husband is a chocolate chip cookie connoisseur, and he can't get enough of these things!  I will definitely be making these again.

these cookies are soooo good. i don't understand how a reviewer said they had no flavor...they had to have forgotten an ingredient! these were bursting with flavor.  i melted the butter in the microwave and after creaming the wet ingredients together than adding the flour, baking soda and salt the dough was almost runny. i was afraid the cookies were going to be flat, but had such a craving for a cookie, i went ahead and baked them right away instead of chilling the dough in the fridge. they came out beautiful, not thin at all. i think next time i will put the oats in the food processor though so as not to "feel" the oats. since there's not enough oats to be an oatmeal cookie but the oat flavor adds a certain depth. that'll be the secret ingredient. great recipe! thanks for sharing. this will be my "go to" cookie.

Fave chocolate chip cookie recipe so far!  I agree that 10min baking time is just right - mine ended up crispy on the edges, soft in the middle - mmm mmm sooo good!  I did change the recipe a tiny bit. I swapped the white and brown sugar quantities as suggested, and I subbed marg for butter. My peanut butter was really runny/oily for some reason, so I used a tad less than 1/2 cup. I wonder if that's why some reviewers found these dry - just really dry peanut butter? Mine were super moist and good. But between the runny peanut butter and the margarine, the batter ended up very soft and sticky. They were more like drop cookies, and they spread a lot. Not complaining though since that's just the way I like them =)  I've only got one criticism: I think a full cup of chocolate chips is way too much for a recipe than only uses one cup of flour! I cut back to 2/3 cup, and it was still almost too much for me, even with my strong sweet tooth. Overall, fabulous recipe. I've been searching for ages for the perfect chewy chocolate chip cookie, and I think I may have found a winner =)

I find that if you substitute Brown sugar for the White sugar you come out with a softer cookie, because white sugar when it bakes it crystalizes, brown sugar does not crystalize when you bake it, it softens.

I just made these exactly as written- yes they looked like the pic and they were just OK. Not much flavor. Would not recommend as anything special. kids agree.

I never give ratings and this is my first one because it really is super easy to make and tastes great! The cookies even worked when I used whole wheat flour!!! My husband even liked them! Oh and only used 1/2 cup brown sugar no white! These are great cookies!

These were great!  Doubled the recipe and subbed coconut oil for butter.  Coconut oil gives you softer, more moist cookies and contains healthy fats so I did this for health reasons rather than to affect the taste.  Butter would have been perfectly fine.  I also subbed out half of the chocolate chips for M&M’s because I couldn’t help myself.  Otherwise followed the recipe.  Found the cooking time, resting time, and temperature to be dead on to have nicely baked but soft cookies.  These actually made the most perfect looking cookies I have ever made, too.  I took a spoon full of dough at a time, rolled into a ball, and pressed 3 M&M’s on top of each one for presentation.  They looked like I picked them up at a bakery.  Thanks for making me look good!

Very good cookie! The only changes I made, where to swich the amounts of sugar used. So, instead I used 1/3 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup packed brown sugar. I also added 1/4 cup of chopped walnuts. Baked 10 min. Any minute longer is too long! Next time I think I'll add dried cranberries!

Yummy!  I followed the recipe, except for adding an extra 1/2 cup milk choc. chips I had leftover from another recipe.  They are nice and crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  I found out on my first batch that they do not spread out while baking.  So the next batch, I flattened them out slightly with the back of a spoon before baking.  Both ways turned out great though!

Fabulous!  I've made these numerous times and they are great everytime.  They are probably my favorite cookie.  It's got just a little of everything I like in a cookie, peanut butter, oats & chocolate...what's not to love!  They turn out so soft and definitely do last long in my house!

These were good, but next time I'm going to reduce the peanut butter and add more oatmeal.  The PB flavor overpowered the cookie.  There is no need to grease the cookie sheet, the cookies have plenty of fat in them, so they don't stick.

Fabulous recipe!  They turned out slightly crisp and chewy at the same time. perfect texture.  The only change I made was I used premium bittersweet chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet chocolate chips. I believe it made a world of difference. Absolutely exquisite.  A definite keeper. Thanks for sharing!

My husband asked for a chewy peanut butter, chocolate chip cookie and I wanted to make it a bit healthy, so I searched Allrecipes for one with oatmeal.  The reviews made it sound so good, I had to try it and I was not disappointed!  The only change I made was to do half regular flour & half whole wheat.  I also doubled the recipe and did what one reviewer suggested and switched the white sugar and brown sugar amounts around (so I guess that's 2 changes!).  Very good!

I tried this recipe twice to be fair since i have yet to come across such an poor recipe due to the recipe its self.  not sweet, didnt set up, the ones that did set were burnt.  the dough was way too soft.  bottom line there is just not enough dry ingredients or binder to keep these together.

I made these for my toddler who liked them very much - used Kind Arthur white whole wheat flour for a bit more nutrition. Cut the sugar and the chocolate chips a bit too but still tasty.

This is a keeper. I have had many requests for the recipe. It is very rich but the peanut butter and rooled oats make the cookie. I used a combination of white and chocolate chips. One suggestion, make sure you soften the butter and then use your hands to mix the batter. It takes a while to get the mixture all together.

Great cookie! I used a cookie scoop and, as was noted, they did not fall. To achieve a flatter, chewier cookie just drop the tray on the counter after you take them out of the oven. This makes the cookies fall flat so they get that nice wrinkled top. I followed the instructions exactly and ended up with almost 3 dozen cookies using the small Pampered Chef cookie scoop. I also needed 12-14 minutes to bake.

Great cookies! I think I made mine a bit smaller, because they were a little too crispy when cooked at ten minutes. I cooked the remaining batches for 8 minutes, and they turned out perfectly. With larger cookies than I made, the 10-12 minutes recommended in the recipe would have worked.

Other than cooking time, I followed the recipe exactly, and it was great!

I'm a male caregiver (nearing 80)needing a good ch chip recipe...by request.I call this cookie 'Trinity' because it has my favoirte tastes: oatmeal, peanut butter and ch chips.
I have only made one batch so far and found using Publix natural peanut butter it has nicely chopped bits of peanuts, not chunks and not totally creamy. Perhaps this is the reason the dough was very oily.  I don't know what to do about this in the next batch.  Will someone tell me?
  I also found the cookie was a bit too sweet for us.  I was hoping, by adding raisins, that would absorb some of the sweetness...I don't know.  More help needed on this.
Despite these constructive criticisms we still think this is a 5 star cookie/recipe.

These were "outrageous"ly good!  I used half semi-sweet and half milk choc chips because that's all I had, plus I added more oatmeal than called for, as well as some toffee chips I had laying around.

I doubled the recipe and it made 4 dozen.  Picture perfect, like they were from a bakery. They had those attractive cracks/crinkles on the top, and they didn't spread at all.

Will bake these again!

In the midst of baking these right now- my entire family gives an enthusiastic 2 thumbs up!! Made a couple of changes- doubled the recipe, used 1 entire bag of milk choc. chips, plus added 1/2 bag Reese's Pieces, 1 bag M&M's, and 1 bag Peanut M&M's. Also added about 1/4 c. more of oatmeal- wanted to clear that last bit out of the container. These are tender, tasty, and everything my family and I love in a cookie! Thanks so much for posting this- it's a total winner! :)

These cookies baked up beautifully. The instructions were simple to follow. However, there isn't enough flavor to suit my taste.

I absolutely loved this recipe. Of course, I love anything with chocolate and peanut butter together. Next time I might try it with chunky peanut butter to add more texture.

The day I made these cookies, I thought they were bland. I made half the dough and put the rest in the fridge. I thought maybe they needed more sugar since I used all natural peanut butter. However, I thought I'd try them one more time. Two days after putting them in the fridge I made the rest of the batch. The cookies were a tablespoon and a half in size. (Before baking.) I baked them for 7 minutes, and let them cool for 10 minutes on the baking sheet. Then I moved them to an air tight container where they cooled completely. They turned out 10x's better! They were moist, and so soft. The flavor was there too! I don't know what did it, the refridgeration, the less time to cook, or maybe the container. But I'm glad it worked!

Perhaps use chunky peanut butter for more texture. But smooth works well too.

These are excellent cookies. The only thing that is too bad is that this makes a small batch...although that's better for my waistline! The peanut butter taste is perfect (I used Skippy Natural Creamy) and the texture is very nice.  Could maybe use a bit more oatmeal, or use rolled oats instead of instant, which is what I used. Fantastic recipe!

These cookies are delicious.  The oatmeal adds texture and the PB adds a little extra flavor.  If you're looking for a regular chocolate chip cookie this isn't it.  But they are wonderful!  My family loves them.  As said in other reviews, they don't spread long.  As always, don't overbake!

This is probably one of the best cookies I have made in a LONG time.
The texture is perfect and they held their shape.
The only thing I changed is I cut the white sugar down by half, ( my mom is diabetic so I always try to cut the sugars down for her)

Wonderful!
Thank you for sharing this recipe!

This combines all my favorite ingredients. I added a healthy amount of cinnamon and they are delicious, warm anyway. Its too soon to tell if they are as good 'cold'. It is important that they stay on the cookie sheet after baking as recommended. They fall apart easily, fresh from the oven.

Great recipe!  I followed it exactly and took the cookies out of the oven a minute or so early so they would be soft and chewy when they cooled.  I liked them best still warm from the oven, but they were great the next day too.

Yum!!  My husband, who is a peanut butter addict, said there was a little too much PB but a friend said they were the best chocolate chip cookies in the world.  I baked 9 cookies and we ate the remaining dough in about 2 days.  Fairly simple and very delicious.

These were incredibly decadent. I made only half a batch and it made 12 HUGE cookies. Really thick and yummy. I used 2x the oats called for, and they took longer to bake, probably because they were so big.

So tasty!!! It was the first time I've ever tasted peanutbutter ~cause I'm from Greece~ first time also using it in cookies! It was delicious so were the cookies. Even if I haven't used the rolled oats ~I didnt know what this thing is exactly or even if it can be bought in the supermarkets here~, cookies came out soo yummy and shoft that for a second I thought that I was seeing stars! Delicious! Great recipe

This recipe is similar to another recipe we like, Peanut Butter Cookies IX. I enjoyed this one because it is not overly sweet. I ground the oats before adding them, and I used part-crunchy peanut butter. Very good cookies!

These were delicious! For those that are having troubles with the cookie spreading... try rolling the cookies in a ball and NOT greasing the sheet.  That is what I did to make 3 dozen small cookies plus one big one for hubby and they turned out absolutely perfect! I followed the recipe exactly except I used old fashioned oats and creamed the wet ingredients before adding the dry. Oh, I also used white chocolate/semi sweet swirl chips. These are sinful! Let them set on cookie sheet 2 minutes before moving to cooling rack. I baked mine for 12 minutes. Very easy, thank you!!!

Oh my gosh!!!!  These cookies are so good!!!!  Followed the recipe,just used a heaping 1/2 cup of peanut butter and a heaping 1/2 cup of old fashioned oatmeal and my butter was not soft, but kinda chilled, but able to blend.  Used the pampered chef small cookie scoop, baked them for 9-10 minutes (they looked a like they could have stayed in a few more seconds).  They came out perfect, held there shape, did not get flat.  Soft and chewey.  I plan on taking these to church tomorrow for a covered dish dinner. Will surely be making these from now on!!

i make these all the time - they are fabulous! i also use natural pb and had no problem with them.  i love that there is protein in them to help offset the negative effect of the sugar. 
definitely my favorite cookie to make!
oh! and i also used whole wheat flour and they were not super dense or anything.  great recipe!

These are FANTASTIC! I used light margarine and lite PB and they were STILL great! They didn't flatten...held their shape really well w/room temp margarine and eggs. I used an extra scoop of PB, and I swapped the measurements of the white/brown sugar adding 1/2 cup of brown and 1/3 cup of white. I do this in almost all cookie recipes.:-) I also mixed the first ingredients (sugar, pb, egg, vanilla) before adding the mixed dry ingredients. Then lastly I stirred in the chocolate chips.

This recipe makes a good tasting cookie, but the dough is dry.  Dry dough makes for cookies that don't fill out much in the baking stage, but stay in the original scooped position.     When I make these again, I'll use butter flavored shortening and add more than called for, plus another egg and a little less flour.

These were great!  i got 4 dozen of them by using rounded teaspoons, instead of tablespoons--it makes the perfect 2-3 bite cookie.  I took them to work and all 48 were gone within 2 hours.

I have had this recipe in my collection for a number of years and it still remains one of my family's favorites. I find that chilling the dough a while before baking helps. I have even made them for cookie exchange parties and large group gatherings.  I can't tell you how many recipe requests I have gotten for this cookie.  They are easy to make and they also freeze well if you are quick enough to pack them up before the family knows what you are doing.

This is a GREAT recipe! Very tasty!! Everyone loves it! Thank you!
I made a minor change to make it more healthy. I use wheat flour instead, less sugar and butter, and I added chopped almond and macadamia nuts. Very Yummy :)

DELISH!!  These cookies were easy to make and looked great without even having to roll them into balls before baking.  I followed the recipe just as written and will make them again (and again!) without any changes!  Yummy and on day 2 they still have a great texture and taste.  Thanks for the great recipe!

They taste great. The dough was very dry and crumbly so I added a little milk. Between that and so many chocolate chips I had trouble getting a decent shape.

I thought the peanut butter flavor would be more subtle but it really wasn't. I liked the cookie. It has the perfect consistency, fat and chewy. I'm not crazy about peanut butter though so I might not make this one often.

Both the hubby and I really liked these. Great combo of flavors and textures. I increased the vanilla to 3/4 teaspoon and used 1 and 1/2 cups of chocolate chips because I love the chocolate in my cookies. My yield from this recipe was 26 cookies using my cookie scoop.

I added 1/2 c. each of grated coconut and chopped pecans.  I made smaller cookies (dropped by rounded teaspoon)and baked for about 12 minutes.  Delicious.

Excellent cookies - great flavor and texture - only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is because they are on the greasy side. I will cut the butter in 1/2 next time.  Also, double the recipe if you have anymore than two people eating the cookies.  The recipe as it is only makes about 18 cookies. In my house, those would be gone before they even made it off the cooling rack. :)

my 3rd grader brought this to the school party.  Only 3 kids took one, they preferred the other cookies there.
Don't just drop the cookies by spoon or it comes out crumbly and bumpy.  You have to roll them in your fingers for the smooth texture.  The taste is good but we could just eat one, not too tempting and it's very rich.  I think it needs more flour, too.  I prefer other cookie recipes.  Also, let it sit 2 mins on pan before transferring to cooling rack or they will just break apart.

Wow!  I was looking to make chocolate chip cookies but wanted something a little bit different - well did I ever find the greatest recipe!  Nice and thick and chewy, and in one word, divine.  I used only 3/4 c chocolate chips in mine, but then also added 1/2 c of salted peanuts, and thus omitted the salt.  They turned out so delicious!  They were an instant hit!

I made these cookies using whole wheat flour, splenda instead of white sugar, and natural peanut butter. They turned out great! Make sure to underbake just a little to ensure great texture.

This is a very good, and quick cookie which appeals to a variety of tastes.  I, too, noticed the cookies come off the sheet better if you let them set a couple minutes. I make my cookies a little larger, so have to double the recipe.

Darn near perfect!  Excellent blend of peanut butter, chocolate and oatmeal.  No one flavor dominates - easy to mix up and bake beautifully.  A good thick cookie that stays soft - we loved them!

Very good cookies!  I used mini choc candy baking pieces instead of choc chips.  I might increase the oatmeal by 1/4 cup next time & the peanut butter flavor was almost too strong for a chocolate chip cookie, but that's just a personal taste.  My kids wouldn't change a thing!

This is a WONDERFUL cookie, and I am not a "cookie person".  I used 1/2 cup milk chocolate morsels and 1/2 cup butterscotch morsels instead of what's called for originally--and the butterscotch make them close to irresistable! Moist and chewy!!

This is my go to recipe when I want to celebrate achievements at work. The team raves over these. As did our kitchen staff.
Update. Still the best recipe... use crunchy peanut butter.  Dark chocolate chips.  Let the butter and sugar cream well.  Add in the order listed...peanut butter must cream before adding the eggs.  I added 1/2 tsp of baking powder.
Update:  I add 1/4 chopped pecans - I double the recipe using small cookie scoop.  Makes close to 6 doz cookies. 
When I take these to work, I put in two different containers for the team...at the end of the day both containers are empty. :)

My hubby and babies just loved these!!! The only changes I made were a touch of nutmeg and cinnamon and I added 1/4 cup of shortening and 1/4 cup of margarine instead of 1/2 cup of butter.. They turned out amazing! They sooo did not last! Thanks for the recipe!!!

I used 1/2 cup white flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat flour.  I also used 1/2 cup dark chocolate chips and 1/2 cup semi sweet chocolate chips.  I only had 1 minute quick oats handy and they did just fine.  These cookies are moist and have just the right texture. Crispy outside and soft inside.  Love this recipe.  Thanks for sharing it.

So far so good- I doubled it- switched the measurements as suggested between the brown and white sugars- and used Truvia instead of regular sugar. I also added an extra bit of Madagascar bourbon vanilla (the good stuff) and more semi sweet chocolate chips. I tasted the batter and it tastes amazing! Used creamy skippy PB and it's all chilling up in the fridge. I think these will be a hit for my hungry boys!

I like this recipe! It was easy and quick. I substituted cashew butter and regular sugar. I also cut down in the sugar to a little more than a 1/2 cup. I think the cashew butter gave them a more buttery flavor and the lack of brown sugar made them a little crumbly but still held together. I made 25 cookies and had to cook them about 14 min.

Great cookie! Didn't have any oatmeal/oats, and I only had mini chocolate chips... But I did use chunky peanut butter.

The texture was very good...nice and chewy.  I followed the recipe to the t, but I was a little overwhelmed by the taste of baking soda.

These cookies turned out amazing!! I've never had cookies turn out so well. I will definitely be making this recipe again. I adjusted the amount of baking soda for high altitude baking. I used just a pinch less than what this recipe called for.

Much better cooked fully. My husband and son undercooked a few batches which didn't give them time to rise, cook and brown properly. Plus they crumbled when trying to take them off the cookie sheet! I much preferred the oatmeal cooked longer, a little crisp to the edges and a yummy soft middle!

I like them to a point. I gave it 4 stars because if I make them in the future I will be changing things...
 part of the reason I dislike them is the type of chocolate chips I have(semi-sweet, I think I would like it better if they were milk chocolate), I think if you love sweet things this is not the recipe for you. My fiance was not fond of them, he is use to far too much sugar though, so seeing the amount of sugar I knew he wouldn't be a fan...we have white chocolate dessert syrup stuff he loves that I find far too sweet that I put on one for him(Lyons designer dessert sauce)...he also does not mind when he gets a chocolate chip...He said it was good whenever he got one.
I personally wish I did not put the oatmeal in it, for me it ruins the texture. 
Someone said they are bland...while I disagree there....it is a good recipe if you have the chocolate you love and love peanut butter and oatmeal cookies(really love oatmeal cookies)....
I will try this recipe again just without the oatmeal and with a different kind of chocolate. 
I wanted to try the original one first then make adjustments to my liking and my fiances...which will mean finding a way to make them sweeter.
The only thing I did change was adding more vanilla extract...I like to be able to taste it...(only added half more of what it called for).

I baked them for 11 min, and I thought that was perfect, soft middle, light crunch on the outside!

Wonderful! This turned out nice and balanced - the sweetness, nuttiness and saltiness all worked together. The peanut butter wasn't overwhelming which is nice and the chocolate chips melted just enough at 12 minutes of baking to not become messy. Thanks for the recipe!

Stupid good, its a miracle the cookie dough even made it to the oven because it was so tasty. I do recommend using the rack just above the middle if you have an oven like me where the 'middle rack' is actually slightly below the middle. Came out wonderfully and very soft. Fell apart very easily (could hardly pick up), I might use more egg in the future but it also could have been the adjustment calculations being slightly off.

Perfect combo of peanut butter, chocolate chips and oatmeal. I used chunky PB but didn't get any chunk from it. Because I love nuts in my cookies, I'll be trying maybe a half cup of chopped dry roasted peanuts next time. That would make it a six star recipe! Folks, this recipe is really worth trying.

I feel like a broken record, but these cookies are fabulous. Everyone that tries one asks for more.  I took Chef John's challenge and mixed these by hand instead of using a mixer.  Very easy and the results were flawless. Makes me wonder if over mixing via a mixer contributes to less than perfect cookies.  This recipe has instantly become a family favorite!

This is right up there with the classic toll house cookie recipe.  It is really good and I was able to make it with a toddler and 6 yr old in the time it took to order and receive pizza.  "and i liked the pizze and coke-s were so yummy."

Didn't spread much which is great.  I made 24 cookies and I think 18 (as the recipe says) would have been perfect. I actually used natural almond butter since it was soon to expire and they were great.

I baked this recipe twice. The first time I made it with the oats and was not too crazy about it. The second time I made it without the oats and it was delicious!!! Without the oats you could really taste and appreciate the chocolate chips and the peanut butter...it was YUMMY!!!

These are fabulous cookies! If you use kraft whipped peanut butter instead of smooth peanut butter they rise a lot more and have a thick layer of peanut butter on top of the chocolate. I recommend leaving them in for 12 minutes so that they are slightly crispy on the bottom and gooey in the middle. Best eaten hot, right out of the oven!

I made these cookies for my son who is stationed in Yokosuka, Japan who loves chocolate chip cookies & peanut butter cookies. I wanted a recipe which combined the two but also travel well because it takes about two weeks to travel to his FPO address.
These are a hands down winner in all categories!
These are great cookies, even I love them!
I changed one ingredient tho, I put dark chocolate chips in them rather than the semi sweet chips & it made the cookies even better.

This is a wonderful recipe. 50 years of baking cookies and I use this one faithfully now. Always produces even well formed cookies. The consistency of shape and size is great. I have changed at times and used almond butter and even used a banana instead of egg. It was great!

These cookies are ok, but I don't see myself ever wanting to make them again. The texture is good, they hold together well, and they were perfectly done at 10 min. However, I thought the chocolate chip/oatmeal/peanut butter cookie combo would be delicious, and yet strangely, combining these 3 distinct cookie flavors makes them sort of bland. The main taste you get from these cookies is sweet,and I even reduced the sugar some.....

This is a really good chocolate chip, oatmeal, peanut butter cookie.  I liked the way they held their shape when baked and the texture was great.  I did reverse the amounts for the white sugar and brown sugar and it still worked.  I used my small cookie scoop and made 121 cookies that I shared with many people.

I always double this recipe and for the 2 cups of chocolate chips, I will use those or any combination of any flavor chips (or raisins! or nuts!) to equal 2 cups. Excellent recipe!

Very delicious. They looked like rounded chocolate chip cookies, and no one could tell they were also peanut butter and oatmeal until they bit into them. I love them.

I want to start by saying this is a delicious cookie.  I am sure I will make this again many times.  IMO, it is more of a peanut butter cookie than a chocolate chip cookie.  Like many reviews suggested, I swapped the measurements for the white and brown sugar, I added a little bit more vanilla, and I ground up the oats. I chilled my dough before baking. Then I used a medium cookie scoop, rolled the dough into a ball and pressed down lightly with a fork before baking.  I baked them for 10 minutes at 325.  They came out lightly browned, soft, and delicious.

I just made these and they were simply easy and are absolutely delicious!!  I did omit the rolled oats since I didn't have any on hand but otherwise, did exactly as the receipe instructed with the exception of baking them for 15 mins versus the 10-12 suggested.

have made these cookies for 18 years!  won a couple of ribbons at the fair and my daughter entered them in a contest to win tickets to see Elmo and meet him.  We love them.   I use two types of chips semi-sweet and 70% cacao.  I flatten with a drinking glass bottom.

3.5.  I generally don't like peanut butter cookies b/c of the texture, and from the reviews, I had expected them to have a softer, cake-like bite.  My rating does not take any points for that, since as far as pb cookies go, these seem decent.  My friend liked them.  I had even chilled the dough and used half shortening to make a softer cookie, but to little effect.  11min was it for me.

I sent 1/2 C oatmeal through the food processor and added an addition 1/3 cup. Turned out perfect! Thanks for the recipe. Thanks for posting!

Note: If you are looking for a gooey chocolate chip cookie recipe this is not it. This is an oatmeal style cookie.

These cookies turned out great.  I used 1/2 c. brown sugar and 1/3 c. white sugar as one other reviewer suggested.  I substituted half of the butter for shortening to give the cookies a softer, chewier center.  I would definitely make these again.

Finally had a chance to make these and am so glad I did!  Followed the recipe exactly and we were very pleased with the results.  One plus - since there are only two of us this didn't make an incredible number of cookies.  Am sure they will be gone soon though so will probably wish the recipe made more!

Not sure I'd go as far as "Outrageous" but these were certainly delicious and a Five Star recipe for sure.  I used all Splenda Brown Sugar Blend for both sugars and they were sweet as you'd ever want. Only problem in making is that you can't stay out of them!

These were incredible.

We didn't have oats, so we left those out. Also, we replaced half of the peanut butter with nutella. 

Baked for 10 minutes -> perfectly gooey.

I am 65 yo and this is the best choco. chip cookie recipe I have EVER made.  The balance of the oatmeal, peanut butter and chocolate elements is awsome.  You won't be sorry you made these...might want to double or even triple recipe if you have cookie eaters in your family.

Great recipe.  I read some of the other reviews before making them and decided to make some changes. I switched the amounts for the sugars because I like a cookie with a lot of brown sugar.  I also doubled the recipe an added another egg for a total of 3 eggs used. The cookies are moist, but crispy around the edges.  They are not too dense and have a nice chew.  This recipe is a definate keeper for me and my family.

I love these cookies! They are amazing! When I make them I use chunky peanut butter and more brown sugar and butter. I also sometimes make them with less chocolate chips because the actual cookie is so good and the chocolate can sometimes overwhelm the taste of the cookie

Easy and tasty.  Makes only 3 dozen.  I like a little crisper cookies.  These were soft and very brittle.

Amazing! To lower the fat (and because I just love the unique taste) I substituted the 1/2 cup butter for 1/2 cup of banana, pureed. Additionally, I sub 1/4 cup of eggbeater for the egg. Of course the recipe is outstanding as written, my changes were just for personal taste/preferrence. Thanks for posting this one!

This recipe has always been one of my family's favorites and everyone I have made it for loves it!  Found it almost 20 years ago on the back of a bag of Gold Medal flour (also called Outrageous Chocolate Chip cookies) and I clipped it and still use it to this day!  I make just as is (using chunky peanut butter) and there are never leftovers!

This cookie was yummy... I added a full tsp of vanilla which added more flavor. I also used mini chips vs reg choc chips.

These taste wonderful! Unlike other cookie recipes, though, the small yield estimate of 18 cookies is quite accurate. I made a double batch and still only ended up with shy of 3 dozen. Love them, though, and will definitely make them again!

This has become my GO TO choc chip cookie recipe. Have made them several times and never disappointed. I do like to toast the oats first though, adds depth to the flavor.  Use the old fashioned kind, not quick cooking. I use natural chunky peanut butter, too.

This is a great recipe, thank you Joan!  Being a peanut butter lover I made a couple changes to suit my personal taste.
I increased the peanut butter to 5 oz. (slightly less than 2/3 cup).
For the sugar I used 1/4 cup  white, and 1/2 cup plus one tablespoon brown.
For the flour I used half all purpose and half whole wheat.  I baked at 325 for  12 - 13 minutes & left on cookie sheet for additional 5 minutes.
Best I've ever made!

Straightforward to make, not ridiculously sweet and great texture. My 2 year old and husband both loved them (mommy enjoyed them too!)

OMG!!!! So easy to whip up, followed the cooking directions exact but subsituted white chocolate and peanut butter chips as that what was on hand. I made a bit bigger cookie and this made 2 dozen for me, I shared a dozen with co-workers and they all either want the recipe, or me to just make them often! Great tasting and remained chewy. Will deffinatly be making these again and again. Thank you for a great cookie recipe!

The only change to make to these is using milk chocolate chips instead of semi sweet. I stumbled upon this by accident and I will only ever make them this way. They are my go to cookie recipe. Always a hit at holidays and events.

thought this would be a good way to use up the 2 jars of peanut butter I bought and turned out I didn't like.  Not only is this recipe SO simple, but what I then decided was to make ice cream sandwiches with them.  Wow!!  I will be making this A LOT!

These are by far the BEST homemade cookies I've ever made.  I've made many batches over the past couple years using this recipe exactly as written.  Everyone always raves over them and wants a copy of the recipe.  Practically impossible to screw up unless you overcook them - the ratios always come out perfect for me every time.

super easy to make! turned out really delicious. the only substitution i made is using 1 tbspn ground flax seed + 3 tbspns water instead of the egg (no reason besides being out of eggs at the moment.) i kept the first batch in for 10 mins, took them out since the edges on some were already brown. second batch i kept in for twelve minutes. I'd advise to go with the 10 min mark as they do continue baking on the hot sheet once you take them out and they're definitely better when they're a bit chewy in the center.

Great consistency, simple recipe. I added some peanuts, as I like these in my peanut butter cookies. Cooked it at just 10 minutes - it did need the proper cooling time to let all the inside melt still, but were delicious!

so delicious! My only problem was having too much peanut oil in the scoop of peanut butter. It made the cookies spread very thinly and bake out the oil and almost leave tiny holes in the middle of several cookies. Very yummy still! :) Thanks for sharing such an awesome recipe!

These are okay.  Turned out a little hard? I didn't overbake them ... hmmm ....  couldn't really taste the peanut butter in them neither.  I will keep looking or just stick to my usual chocolate chip cookie recipe.

Big hit with the family!  Made 2 dozen cookies for me using a small ice cream scoop (approximately 1 tablespoon size).  Next time we'll double the batch because they're that delicious! Thanks Joan!

Just took first batch out of the oven. They are soooo soft that I'm afraid they are going to break apart. I baked them for 16 minutes; never did get crisp. What did I do wrong? I have a feeling they are going to taste delicious, but that I'm going to have crumbs.

Chocolate chips, oatmeal, and peanut butter, all in one cookie. What could be better?
The only reason it's not 5 stars is that it's very easily over-baked. You really do have to take it out before it looks ready (just the edge starts to turn brown), otherwise it's too crispy.

These cookies are beyond phenomenal! I make these for my family at least 2x a month and they love them! The cookie dough itself is amazing! Tip: if you aren't a fan of chocolate chips, substitute raisins (I prefer golden raisins for this recipe).

GREAT cookies! As other reviewers did, I swapped the amounts for the sugars (1/2 cup of brown and 1/3 cup of white) and baked for exactly 10 minutes. They came out perfect! I do recommend you make the cookies relatively small - I found the bigger cookies tended to flatten more and I like a taller cookie. Amazing when you take two cookies with ice cream sandwiched in the middle. Heaven!

I absolutly fell inlove with this recipe, the cookies turned out a little crunchy around the edges, chewy on the inside, the combination of peanut butter/oatmeal and chocolate chips just perfect. Followed everything by the recipe , not less not more. Will make again for sure.

These are my new go-to recipe! 
I will make them again and agin! 

I used quick oats and white chocolate (it's all I had on hand) and fresh baking soda. 

they were perfectly crispy, soft and melt in your mouth! It's the marriage of everything I love! 

they were gone in no time!

This is a fine recipe but the name is a bit deceiving. If I had wanted a peanut butter cookie with chocolate chips, I would have searched for one. The peanut butter is overwhelming and the cookie is crumbly (like a peanut butter cookie) not chewy like a chocolate chip cookie.

LOVE these cookies! My only tip for cookie makers out there is be to sure to use room-temp butter, not cold or microwaved... that why some of the cookie pics look off I think. Also, I added a 1/2 tsp of cream of tartar bc I read somewhere that it makes the cookies crack more...worked for me! These cookies looked as good as they tasted! I've never made a prettier chocolate chip cookie!

YUMMY! This cookies were delicious! I even used corn starch instead of the egg and they turned out fantastic. I also rolled them into balls, but had to cook them for 12 minutes instead of the 10 that others suggested.

These cookies really hit the spot! I had to cook them for 12 min in my oven. I recommend not stirring any ingredients in, just beat them in lightly! Amazing!

This is my favorite and only recipe I will ever use again!!! But what I do to make it even better is I add 1 cup of chocolate chips and then an additional cup of white chocolate chips! Sooooo good. Also chopped walnuts or pecans would be a wonderful addition..making the cookies more of an Outrageous Ultimate Chocolate Chip cookie!! ;-)

These were amazing! Switched up the proportions of brown and white sugar and used old fashioned oats, otherwise kept everything the same. Baked for 11 minutes and they are the best cookies I've ever made. The held their shape well and did not go flat!

Delicious and easy to make!  Made it as written except I used mini chocolate chips.  9-9.5 minutes was all mine took.  Only yielded 22 cookies.  Came out looking the best when I rolled them into a ball and then flattened a little.

Omgoodness.....wow, so good! Only thing I did was switch amounts of sugar as other reviewer's said they may be more moist. Bake ten min...very naughty ;-)

Agreed with the other reviewer who wrote that the cookie is bland; the texture is good though.

These cookies tasted amazing, I love baking but stay away from chocolate chip cookies but these were simply amazing. I didn't put oats because 1) didn't have any and 2) i wanted to taste the peanut butter more. I will definitely make these again.

It wasn't as good as I had hoped. not moist enough or something, I wish I knew. not experienced enough to know what I could have done different and I had doubled the batch. Twice as much to eat for my family.

These cookies came out awesome!! The only change I made was that I added more brown sugar and white sugar to give it more of a sweeter taste, because I felt dough was too peanut buttery for me. So in order to get rid of some of the peanut butter taste, I added more brown and white sugar to dough. Overall, excellent recipe to make chocolate chip cookies and I will recommended this to anyone!!

I'll start by saying that I'm a cookie SNOB, and I pride my palette in the cookie realm.  I appreciated what these cookies were trying to accomplish, but they really do come out as sort of a mild peanut butter chocolate chip cookie.  The oatmeal definitely adds some minor crunchiness and chewiness, but my batches turned out very delicate and slightly dry - even when trying to undercook them a bit.  Still looking for that perfect chocolate chip cookie recipe.

I changed the brown sugar to 1/2 a cup and the white sugar to 1/3 a cup. I whipped the peanut butter, egg and vanilla to a really light mousse-like consistancy. I also added a splash of milk when I was adding the chips and the oatmeal. It was a little looser than normal cookie batter, but after baking at 330 for 13 minutes they turned out warm, gooey and delicious! Great recipe, just needed a little tweeking.

Since I'm a person thats like chocolate and peanut butter together I must say that these were very good.  I didn't put oatmeal in them because I didn't have any. Also, don't over cook these.  As the directions say only 10-12 min in the oven at the LEAST.  They are much better soft than crispy.

Absolutely delicious!  I made a batch and as soon as one was cooled off enough I tried one.  And then I tried another!  I immediately started mixing up another batch, as I know this one will be gone in no time flat!  They are very simple to make.  Will be making these a lot!!!!  Thanks for the great recipe!

My family LOVES these cookies!! I like how these take less sugar overall and less butter than most chocolate chip cookie recipes. This is my GO-TO cookie recipe now! I bake them for exactly 10 minutes and they come out perfect every time!! Ya gotta try them!

These are so good!  They melt in your mouth!  I followed the recipe except that I used white chocolate chips instead of regular chocolate chips because that was what I had.  They didn't spread, were soft and chewy, and just great!  We will definitely be making these again.

These cookies were super easy, and taste great. I used mini semi sweet chips. The only change I made to the recipe was to cream together the egg, peanut butter and vanilla along with the sugar and butter. Then I just stirred in the rest and they turned out perfect. Thanks!

Edit: These cookies were just as good two days after baking.

[actually a 4.5] These are a delicious, buttery, richer take on a chocolate chip cookie. The flavors don't compete, but are delightfully balanced, with the oatmeal taking a back seat, as you might expect. 

I've made these twice—and doubled the recipe the last time, at the bidding of my boyfriend, as the original only makes 3 doz. and they were gone in a blink of an eye. Yum.

My fiance says "Give it a TEN!"  We are just now eating these hot out of the oven - REALLY GREAT cookie recipe.  I used 1/4 C. Splenda + 1/4 C. White Sugar and a little extra vanilla - YUMMY !!!  Made 24 larger cookies baked for 17 minutes and loosen after 2 minutes from cookie sheet.  PLUS ONE BIG COOKIE just for fun !!  EXCELLENT !!!

cookies are in the oven now, but if the batter is any indication (sooo yummy!) - these cookies are gonna be heavenly!  I'll leave additional feedback as soon as I taste one (7 minutes & counting!) - okay, cookie dough - delicious.  final cookie - only so-so.  I agree with other person who said there was just too much going on that it ended up bland.

Just made these this afternoon with my 3-year old and they are AMAZING. I followed the recipe as is and baked them for 10 minutes. I have so much trouble with my cookies spreading really thin and these did not!

Given the fact that this recipe combines three of my favorite cookies I had high hopes. I was not let down! I DID substitute the butter with fake butter because I have a dairy allergy but I stuck with the recipe otherwise. Excellent!

perfect cookies! i was worried they would be a bit too much considering all the flavors, but they proved to be absolutely delicious and not too rich at all. i found the recipe yielded more than was stated, but no one complained.

This was pretty simple and delicious.  I'm not a huge fan of peanut butter cookies, and found it was very similar; it was still good though.

PERFECT!  I chopped up Reese's PB Cups, Mr. Goodbar bars, and used dark chocolate chips and threw them into the batter and they turned out FANTASTIC. Best  cookies I've ever made... possibly the best I've ever tried!

I love these cookies and so do my kids and hubby. I took a friend's advice and doubled the recipe and instead of 1 cup of butter, I did  half butter and half shortening. I also freeze half the batter so I have some to make if required at the last minute. I don't like changing the recipes but it was suggested by many. I also think if a recipe is changed someone should repost. Needless to say, these are a keeper in our house.

Wow I have never tasted chocolate chip cookies so good in my life. I have been making 2 batches a week when I first discovered the recipe because all of my family want some. Even my grandparents who are considered the best bakers in the family are begging for the recipe. Hands down the absolute best.

WOW - I just made these and already ate three!  I added chopped walnuts to one batch and it made it more textured.  They keep their shape but i agree to roll them in balls first.  I used more brown sugar (1/2 cup) and less sugar (1/3) to keep them very moist.  Also used parchment paper instead of greased sheets.   These are going to be a staple for the upcoming holidays...now i just need to try making them vegan for my health-conscious family members!  bravo to you :)

These were good cookies but they're not any better than most other chocolate chip cookie recipes. The peanut butter and rolled oats add a little something extra but nothing to write home about.

Followed the recipe exactly, which I rarely do. They tasted good because peanut butter and chocolate always do...but there wasn't much chewiness and the flavor was just good, not great. They do look very pretty, though.

Very easy to put together in a hurry but tastes like it took a long time. The flavor and texture of these cookies is absolutely yummy. These do not last long at all at my house. Everyone gobbles them up and wants more. I have kept prepared mixture in the fridge to reserve for later baking and after it comes to room temperature it still bakes to perfection. I have made these small and large and it does not spread at all. I especially like to make these when we have a lighter supper. These cookies are rich and satisfies any sweet tooth.

These were fantastic!! Unfortunately I didn't have any rolled oats so I just replaced that with 1/2 cup more of flour. I used crunchy peanut butter which was delicious. When I tasted the mixture I thought they were going to come out far too salty but they didn't at all. I will definately be making these again.

I just made these about 5 minutes ago, and I LOVE how these cookies did not spread much at all for me and really held a plump shape. If you want them flatter, you'll have to do that manually before you put them in the oven, because they don't spread much when baking.   I halfed the sugar (white) with half real and half Splenda. I think I will keep the full real sugar amount next time because they weren't as sweet as I like them to be.

I have tried making peanut butter oatmeal chocolate chip cookies and they have never come out this good! These are amazing. I did mix half dark Ghirardelli chocolate chips with regular semi sweet chocolate chips and they turned out really good! I will def. be making these all the time!

I was excited to find a recipe that had all my favorite cookie ingredients - chocolate chips, oats and peanut butter. However, while the cookies were certainly good, they seemed to have an identity crisis. The flavors warred rather than blended.

These were just okay. I like the peanut butter flavor in them. I don't know if the oats dried them out or what. They weren't as chewy and moist as other cookies. I probably won't make them again. Award Winning chocolate chip cookies on here tasted better.

First off, the title of the recipe is deceiving.  These are peanut butter cookies with chocolate chips in them.  The oatmeal adds more texture than flavor.  That being said, they're really good.  The texture is fantastic.  If I could get my chocolate chip cookie recipe to not spread out like these, I would be in business.

Delicious cookies! I used whole wheat pastry flour and subbed some of the chocolate chips for reeses pieces. Mine only took 9 minutes, so make sure to watch them carefully.

These are our family's favorite peanut butter cookie.  I usually try to use applesauce to replace some of the butter or oil in my recipes, but not usually in cookies.  This one actually works.  I use 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup applesauce and they still taste great.  They don't spread as much, but they stay soft for a few days; although they don't usually last that long.  I also use mini chocolate chips so that you get a bite of chocolate in every bite.

Wow, wow, wow.  Just made these cookies, exactly like the recipe said and they turned out perfectly.  Baked them for 10 mins like others suggested and wow, they are moist.

An accurate name indeed.  I just made these for the first time and they are truly amazing. The right balance of peanut butter to chocolate chip and oatmeal.  Mine had to cook for the full 12 minutes and set for 5 before I could safely lift them off my cookie sheet.  You will not be disappointed with these wonderful cookies.

Amazing, even without chocolate chips. To me, the chocolate makes a cookie, but in this case, I loved every bite of all the dough and the cookies that I ate, even w/o the chocolate. Next time I make them, however I do hope to add it, just didn't have any in my house for this time. Delicious. I did swap the amounts of brown for white sugar as suggested by others. and actually used sugar in the raw for my 'white' sugar.  Didn't make tons of cookies but that might be due to how much dough I ate.

So so so good!  I probably ate half a dozen of these in dough alone.  The flavors are perfect together.  Like other reviewers said these don't spread a lot so if you want a flatter cookie flatten them before popping them in the oven.

These were good, but I think I would prefer just a regular chocolate chip cookie. The peanut butter gave it a nice flavor, not so sure I liked the oatmeal though. They turned out soft. They do not flatten out hardly at all.

We all loved them!  I was hoping they would be a little softer (I like my cookies that way and they were by no means crunchy... just a little chewier than I wanted), but they had a wonderful taste and I will definitely make them again.

These are very good. I followed the recipe to a T and they had a great PB flavor and the texture is very nice and soft with a crunchy edge. They even stayed nice and soft after they were cool. Thanks for the outstanding cookie recipe.

I am not really sure what went wrong here!  The cookies turned out really flat and thin.  I used brand new never opened baking soda.  So that wasnt the problem.   They did have really good flavor so I dont think I will give up on them just yet!

This is the best cookie recipe I've tried in a long time.  Perfect combo of chocolate chips, peanut butter and oatmeal.  I made them exactly as written and couldn't be happier with the results.  I used my Pampered Chef cookie scoop and ended up with exactly 2 dozen cookies.  Will definitely be making these again!  Spectacular!!!

These were tasty! I disagree with those saying they were bland. I love my sweets and I thought they were just the right combo of flavor. I did use 1/2 milk chocolate chips and 1/2 semi-sweet. The only problem I had was the second batch burning a little on the bottom before they looked done. As some others have mentioned- don't wait until they look brown on top or the bottoms will be a wee bit charred ;)

WOW!!!!!  I love this recipe.  I am so picky when it comes to chocolate chip cookies.  I have been baking for over 30 years and have a reputation when it comes to my cookies.  I can't wait to bring these to friends and family.  No changes are necessary to this recipe at all. Go ahead and bake them you won't be sorry.

Yum!  I added a sprinkle of cloves and cinnamon to the dough to give a little boost to the oatmeal cookie flavor.  The first batch turned out really flat, so I stuck it in the fridge for about 15 minutes and they didn't spread as much.  I may try butter flavor Crisco next time and see if that helps contain the spread.

These are good - my bf didn't love them though... he said it seemed like they were confused, couldn't decide if they were chocolate chip, or oatmeal, or PB, etc. =) I liked how they have a light crunch when you bite into them yet they are chewy.

We really like this recipe. I usually grab a messy spoonful, about the size of a golf ball. I don't flatten it or anything. The cookies come out beautifully lumpy and the perfect thickness.   Oh, and a little trick I learned to make them look more like the "pretty" bakery cookies: after you form them but before you put them in the oven, poke 2-4 more chocolate chips onto the tops of the cookies, to break up any "plain dough" areas.

They're good, but I kind of agree with the person that said they are a combination cookie with not much taste.  I'll make them again depending upon the response.  I will say that the "36" made 50 (even with my usual measuring utensil), so that was an added bonus.

Delicious!  I made these exactly as stated, except I doubled the recipe. I gave about half away and everyone loved them! The peanut butter taste is definitely there, but not overpowering. Will make these again!

I was curious as to how the combination of oats, peanut butter, and chocolate chips would work out, and this is now my family's favorite cookie recipe!  I added a little more peanut butter, but other than that, followed the recipe to a T.  Love it!!

These were a HUGE hit with my family.  They are some of the best cookies I have ever made, and they stayed moist and chewy for days longer than my usual chocolate chip recipe!  I did flip the amounts of brown and white sugar so there was more brown.  Next time I might also add in a little extra oatmeal for the nutritional benefit.  Definitely a keeper!!!

Delicious cookies! I used milk chocolate chips. I also used 1/4 of oatmeal, simply because I didn't read the recipe properly. They turned out really well, anyway. I baked them for eight minutes, and they were very soft and chewy. Will definitely make these cookies again. Thanks!

Amazing! I made about 14 large cookies and the entire batch was gone in half an hour (mind you there was 3 teenage boys around!). My husband told me to never make these again because he didn't want to get fat. I added slightly over 1 c. of oats and think I would add even more next time. I rolled them into balls and barely pressed them down and took them out just before they were done to ensure a chewy cookie. They were delicious and I will be making this often

Absolutely delicious...just enough peanut butter and oats to take this cookie above and beyond the traditional chocolate chip.  I didn't make any changes and they came out perfect.

Though the combination of flavors was tasty, I didn't like the texture of this cookie, even straight from the oven.  It didn't have a nice crispness or softness.

I thought these were "ok".  Nothing special, but maybe that's just me????  I prefer really soft and chewy cookies (maybe just my cooking).  The kids in my class thought they were good, but they were not overwhelmingly trying to go back for seconds.....

These were great! My husband loves peanut butter so these were a perfect change for him. The flavors are just subtle enough to have people wondering what the ingredients are that make them so yummy. They are nice in place of your usual chocolate chip cookie which I make all of the time. I baked them for my daughters fourth grade class for first day of school and she said everyone in class said her Mom was the BEST baker ever! ;)

A couple of suggestions about the natural PB. I have found that it is often difficult to substitute in recipes due to the difference in consistency/ texture. The end result is frequently not quite right in appearance/ consistency but the taste is always super peanutty. Try different brands- I have often had better luck with skippy naturals. Also, in this recipe, you cold try cutting back on the butter since the peanut butter has the extra oil. As for the sweetness, just cut the sugar amount. We do this as a rule of thumb for baking- most recipes are just too sweet to start with. the raisins themselves have a lot of natural sugar so they won't help make this less sweet. For a double recipe I used: 2/3 c. white sugar, 2/3 cup (barely packed) dark brown sugar, 2 cups whole wheat pastry flour (whole wheat flour might also help with the oil since it tends to make things dryer as a rule) instead of white flour and an extra 1/4 cup oats, I also cut the PB from 1 cup to a little more than 3/4 cup. Because of timing I refrigerated the dough for several hours before baking. The dough turned out great and the cookies are delicious. I would agree with others, though, that they are not overly peanutty. Next time I will try my own advice and add more peanut butter while taking away some of the butter. Thanks, for the heads up on the natural PB, it made me think about changes to make myself.

I am giving this recipe 4 stars because I changed the recipe.  I think 3 stars is a more accurate rating for what I got.  I used Ghiradelli Bittersweet Chocolate and I did not like the results.  The cookies are not sweet enough for me and the bittersweet chocolate made them even less sweet.  The texture is great and the peanut butter flavor is subtle but good.  If I ever make these again, I will use the semisweet chocolate.

By far the best cookie I've had in a long time! The only thing I changed was using crunchy peanut butter instead of smooth, put in chocolate and white chocolate swirl chips and I also used parchment paper.  I put the dough on the paper in rounded balls and they spread out quite nicely.  They were slightly crispy on the outside and very moist on the inside.  The recipe made about 22 cookies and I let them cook for exactly 10 minutes.  And for all of the peanut butter haters out there, you couldn't even really taste it!  These cookies are yummy!

I love putting chocolate chips, peanut butter, and oatmeal all into one cookie!  Kind of crispy, kind of chewy and sooooo good!  Will bake a little bit less time next time for more chewy and less crispy, but otherwise great!

These cookies were DELICIOUS!  I'm a newbie when it comes to baking and was worried that they wouldn't turn out.  I worried for nothing!  I followed the recipe exactly!  I think I made my cookies too big though b/c I ended up baking them for much longer.  I just kept an eye on them until they were done.  Great cookies, I will definitely make them again!

Really good!!!  I used chocolate chunks instead of chocolate chips, which I prefer.  But other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  Next time I may do 1/2c. of chocolate chunks and 1/2c. of cut up peanut butter cups instead of the 1c. chocolate chips.  I think peanut butter cups would be excellent in these.  Mmmmm.  Perfectly soft and great flavor!

Very good cookie! I took the advice of other reviewers and used 1 cup brown sugar while only using 2/3 cup of white. I agreed that it would make a more moist cookie. Peanut butter and chocolate chips are always a great combo but oatmeal makes it even better! I baked at 350F for 10 minutes but couldve left them in for another 1-2, they were a little gooey but still great. Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious! My boyfriend said it was like "carnival in a cookie". I used freshly made peanut butter. The only change I made was using vegan carob chips instead.

I made these over the weekend and everybody just raved over them. The only thing I did differently is I used milk chocolate chips in place of the semi-sweet chips.  They have a good texture to them and hold up vary well in a airtight container. This is a keeper =) =)

These were alright; definitely not the best cookies I've ever made or tried; definitely not the worst cookies I've ever made or tried.  I would not make them again, though; there are other recipes I prefer much more; such as "Award winning chocolate chip cookies"... those are devine...

Delicious!  I'm in Florida, so that plain old chocolate chip cookie recipe on the back of the bag never works out for me; the humidity makes the cookies deflate and they turn into unappealing, thin disks.  These cookies stay thick and soft, just the way I like them.  My boyfriend is a peanut butter junkie and he approved of the taste.  I overcooked the first batch because I was worried about the outside coloring, but they continue to cook on the pan, so leave them sitting there for AT LEAST five minutes after you remove them from the oven, just like the recipe says!  They'll look mushy and undercooked, but trust me, they firm up.  I ended up with sixteen well sized cookies, yum!

I'm giving these cookies four stars because I feel they need more brown sugar. I put equal amounts brown and white sugar (1/2 c each) and they were good. Not like the best cookies I've ever had in my life, but definately good enough to make again.

These cookies were really good.  Crunchy on the outside and nice and chewy on the inside.  I really liked the combo of the oats, peanut butter, and chocolate chips.  The peanut butter flavor wasn't very pronounced which I was hoping for so next time I may add a little bit more peanut butter.

My boyfriend and I made these cookies and now have a new favorite!  10 minutes was perfect for these.  They come out of the oven really soft and harden up after about 5-6 minutes.  It's worth the wait!  They are a perfect blend of flavors and they stay SO soft.  I almost like these better than classic chocolate chip.  Can't wait to make these again.

I made these tonight and they were alright.  The only thing I did differently is use White Chocolate PB from "The Peanut Butter Company" and added 1/2c. of wheat germ, which I do to all my cookies and no one ever notices.  With that said, I would definitely take out the oats and add more PB and chocolate chips if I ever tried these again.  Or I might do as another reviewer did and grind the oats up.  Just personal preference, but they are still good, just not our favorite.  They'll get eaten, that's for sure.  :)

These cookies are perfect.  Very often I find cookie recipes that just don't turn out right...too thin, too thick, too...you get the point.  These cookies on the other hand are just perfect.  I followed the recipe as written and had no problems at all.  The peanut butter is a background taste, and the oatmeal just gives a different consistency.  This is an excellent chocolate chip cookie recipe!!

Outrageous is the key word in this recipe! ABSOLUTELY PHENOMENOL!!!! I have finally found the perfect chocolate chip cookie recipe. I have been looking for one that uses oats. The only problem I have been having is the dough either runs and/or the cookies don't bake right. They bake around the edges and the center is left half unbaked. These did NOT spread or run at all and the greatest thing is the dough didn't even need to be refrigerated. I don't think I will use any other recipe than this one!!! No changes are needed!!!!! Thank you so much for sharing!

Mmmmm, these cookies were delicious. The texture was nice and fluffy. I added an extra 1/2 cup of chocolate chips and they turned out very well. Nice and chocolate filled. Also its good to roll them into a ball and press down slightly on the tops and they hold form well, even on a greased pan. Great Recipe!

i doubled this recipe to 36 cookies. i made  tablespoon drops and flattened them slightly. after the first batch was baked i learned two things. first, don't overbake them, they take on a burnt taste easily. the second time i did 12 minutes then turned them and one more minute. watch them close and take them out as soon as the edges begin to brown or they'll be overdone. second, after i made the dough drops and flattened them, i sprinkled them with sugar before baking. this added just the right sweetness. i liked them much better with the sugar, maybe because i used natural peanut butter. i've always liked my peanut butter cookies rolled in sugar. these were good cookies, not the best, something different.

This is one of my all time favourite cookie recipes! I followed the recipe exactly but baked the cookies for 8 mins before leaving them to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes. Crisp around the edges, chewy in the middle. Perfect!

This is a GREAT cookie for someone who loves a twist on the standard PB cookie.  They taste like a cross between a PB and an Oatmeal cookie, throw in some chocolate chips and you have a happy marriage of 2 flavors!  I didn't find these to be too dry, although the edges do get a little "sandy", almost shortbread-like.  Just make sure to NOT OVER BAKE!  I used a small ice cream scoop to potion these out, they took about 12 minutes to cook.

Not sure what all the hype is about - I followed the recipe exactly.  I love chocolate chip cookies and peanut butter - but these cookies are almost kind of gross.  They are very dry and bland tasting.  I'm quite dissapointed.

Outrageous indeed! I'm eating one as I type... ooh, there go crumbs in the keyboard! I couldn't wait to review: 5 stars for sure. My family is raving. I did decrease the peanut butter just a bit, and went easy on the oats. (I'm not an 'exact' baker). Perfect, thank you!!

These cookies are very good, taste wise. Be aware that they are very dry. I found that past the second day, they arent very good.  I used chunky peanut butter and found the taste to be very yummy though!  I just wished they werent so dry!  I will continue to make another recipe for chocolate chip cookies from this site as my favorite. sorry.

Awesome cookies!!  I doubled the recipe and for the oats/flour combination, I blended 1 cup of oats, put in 1/2 cup of unblended oats, and 1 1/2 cups of regular flour.  I also switched the amounts of brown and white sugar as other reviewers have suggested
I baked them for 14 minutes and let them sit on the pan for 5 minutes. Don't skip this step or they will fall apart!  These are soooo good.

These made the best cookies.  The flavor was good but I love peanut butter so my opinion is biased!  They stayed moist and delicious in an airtight container for almost 2 weeks. I can't wait to make them again.

These cookies ae every bit as good as Toll House cookies ... maybe even better!  Great with or without the chocolate chips.  May also be good with nuts.  Yum!!

These are phenomenal.  I substituted 1/4 of the chocolate chips with peanut butter chips because I LOVE peanut butter.  Wow - these could win contests.

I quadrupled the recipe, used a small ice cream scoop and scooped up dough balls onto a cookie sheet and popped it in the freezer. After they are completely frozen, I'm going to put them in a freezer bag with the baking instructions and give them as gifts (well, some of them).  I can't wait to share this recipe!

These are amazing!  I made several kinds of cookies for Christmas and these were our family's favorites.  I made a big batch and rolled them into 1 inch balls and froze them on a cookie sheet.  Then I put them in a ziplock bag so I could bake just a few at a time.  When I was ready to bake them, I let them thaw for a few minutes while the oven was heating and then increased the baking time for a few minutes.  Delicious!

Excellent flavor, but too dry.  Next time, I think I'll omit the rolled oats.

I made some for my husbands unit (Army).  I gave each guy a gift basket containing several baked goods.  Even though I gave each of them a dozen they were stealing each other's cookies.  This is a wonderful recipe.  The soldiers thank you very much.

Love this recipe!  Rolled oats and peanut butter add extra oomph to the standard chocolate chip cookie.  They stayed soft and chewy even after being stored for 3 days where other cookies would have become dry and brittle.

I gave it three stars because the taste was okay, but a little bland. I'm not quite sure what could make this taste better. I won't be making these again.

Different spin on chocolate chips.  I think I would use chunky peanut butter next time to give it some more texture though!

AWESOME!  I have been using the same chocolate chip cookie recipe for a long time because they turn out so well, but these were at least as good, if not better.  It's a nice change from the normal chocolate chip cookie.  Perfect texture, amazing taste.  I doubled the recipe and got 4 dozen using a cookie scoop.

I used whole wheat flour for these cookies and I loved the oats in there.  It made me feel a little less guilty for enjoying them so much!!  My kids loved them, my mom and sister are asking for more. Thanks.

I am very saddened by the way these cookies turned out. I couldn't wait to get done with dinner to make them, and I am disappointed. I mostly choose which recipes to make by the reviews, and these reviews here are misleading. The texture of these cookies is "CHALKY" as my boyfriend (a cookie fanatic) called them. I was either going to make these cookies or the recipe for "Best Chocolate Chip Cookies", and I chose wrong. I'll suggest this... I have not yet tried the other recipe, but try other recipes before these. Or if you are still gonna try these, good luck! 

*Also, these cookies don't settle/flatten much. I had to take a tbs of the mix and flatten it in my palm. I burned the first 8 cookies cause they didn't flatten at all so they look like they hadn't cooked.

This recipe was so easy - I already had all of the ingredients in my kitchen (except baking soda - but that's just because I used it to clean with!).  The recipe was very easy to put together - I didn't change a thing.  I baked the cookies for 13 minutes - and they came out perfect!  The only problem I had was - I ate way too many!

Very very good cookie... these had a nice texture, not too heavy. This reminded me of a Reese's cup candy. DH loved these as his 3 fav cookies are oatmeal, pb, and choc chip so I knew I couldn't go wrong. DH gave this cookie 5 stars. I was only going to eat one as a sample and the next thing I know, I've eaten 3! I didn't have semisweet chips so I used milk choc. and we liked how it turned out. Thanks for the great cookie recipe!

These cookies really are outrageously awesome!  The last thing I needed was yet another cookie recipe, but this one is definitely a keeper.  I like the combo of oatmeal and peanut butter with the chocolate chips.  The cookie was chewy but held together great.  I think it really helps to let the butter come to room temperature on it's own, and then beat really well adding sugars one at a time.  I doubled the recipe but followed exact.  Then I had to hurry and give the cookies away to keep from eating them all!

This recipe is fabulous!  The consistency was great, and as another home cook pointed out, the flavor of the peanut butter was a good balance with the oats and the chocolate.  We used all natural peanut butter and toasted organic oats as a healthier alternative.  It turned out wonderful. 

Next time, though, I think I would leave out the white sugar all together.  It's actually a little too sweet with the two kinds of sugar, the peanut butter AND the semi-sweet chocolate.

These are very good!  I did take the suggestion of others and switched the measurements of the brown and white sugar.  I also ground my oats a little and used about 1 1/4 cups of choc chips.  I baked them for exactly 10 minutes and they came out perfect.

THESE ARE THE BEST!!! They are the perfect mix of oatmeal, peanut butter and chocolate.  They are crispy, not chewy but perfectly so. My family loved it.  I used quick oats and processed them to a fine crumb.  YUMMY!!

Absolutly delish! I doubled the recipe (except for the peanut butter so as not to overpower the cookies with a peanutty taste) and was able to make 3 dozen medium - large sized cookies. Due to picky co-wokers I made 1/2 without the oatmeal and then mixed in 1 Cup of Oatmeal to make the last 1/2. Brought these to work and the smell was so yummy that people were munching them for breakfast by 9am! ... they were devoured by noon :) Will make repeatedly. Not only are they scrumchious but they look the bill too!

These cookies are great in every way - flavor, texture, easy, and fast because it's not a huge batch.  Whole wheat pastry flour works fine.  I've made them many times and they have always turned out perfectly following the recipe as is.  They do need to sit on the cookie sheet for a bit when they come out of the oven.  Ten minutes will get you chewy middles, crispy edges.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

Easy to make and even easier to eat! These are deadly!! A mild peanut butter taste, loaded with chocolate chips, and a bit of oatmeal. Baked for only 10 minutes and they are fantastic!

These cookies are excellent!  The three flavors of chocolate, peanut butter and oatmeal are amazing.  I didn't have semi-sweet chips, so I used semi-sweet chocolate squares and cut/shaved them up.  Delicious!

These are wonderful.  I just made them with my girls.  They are so soft with nice golden edges.  The only changes that I made was 3/4 cup of chocolate chips instead of a full cup and used 1/2 whole wheat flower.  I also froze some dough balls for later.

These are awesome.  Just made them for 2nd time and can't stop eating them!!  I did add about 1 cup nuts (walnuts this time - pecans last time).  They simply melt in your mouth.  And of course, you need a big cold glass of milk to wash them down.  Yum!!

I share the sentiment that this is probably one of the best I've ever made.  I was skeptical - the list of ingredients don't seem very different from many other recipes.  I was pleasantly surprised.  My 4yo and 5yo kids loved making them and the batch was easy to stir.  It made three dozen exactly.  I didn't change a thing!  Thanks!

Awesome recipe!  No changes needed.  I used plain Jif peanut butter at room temperature, and the margarine also at room temp.  I had no problems with dry dough. You need to let the cookies cool a couple of minutes to firm up before removing from the cookie sheet.  Thanks Joan,for a great recipe!  This goes on my favorites list!

Wonderfully soft, chewy cookie. We will use this recipe again and again! Very simple, easy instructions with bakery-style results! I got 42 cookies out of a double recipe. Excellent, thank you for submitting this one!

Really good. I needed to cook mine a minute or two longer. My first batch that I cooked for 10 minutes were good but a little too undercooked. This could just be due to my oven though. Thanks for the great recipe great combination of flavors.

Pretty darn good and makes for a very presentable cookie -- they look very "bakery" like.  I was out of oats so I used Kashi whole grain instant oat cereal and they turned out really well!  I love the combo of flavors.  I upped the salt to 1/2tsp since I had unsalted butter.

these turned out wonderful.  first, i combined the wet ingredients in one bowl and the dry in another and slowly added the dry to the wet.  i also followed the advice of others and rolled  them into small balls, and flattened them on the cookie sheet.  the minimum baking time was perfect.  i only got 2 dozen cookies instead of 3 dozen, but i guess i just made mine larger.  these came out perfect!

I have made these several times using the recipe as stated, only substituting butter flavored shortening for the butter (+ 6 tsp. of water for every 1 c. of shortening used).  Yesterday I decided that these cookies would be wonderful if they were bigger, so I used my used my cookie scoop and rolled 2 scoops together into 1 big ball.  I placed it on the cookie sheet and baked at 350 for about 13-14 minutes. These cookies are amazing!  They look and taste like a cookie that should be sold in a bakery.  I love the texture of this cookie as well. MMMMMMM!

This is a great cookie recipe.  The only change I made was substituting whole wheat flour.  I usually don't eat a lot of the cookies I make (my husband's the cookie monster), but these are amazing.  I've had 4 already today.  Just be sure not to over bake them.  My first dozen were a little dry, but the others - that were taken out of the oven looking a little underdone - where fantastic.

These cookies are awesome!!!  I usually switch the amounts of sugar and brown sugar, add a little more oatmeal, and cook for 9 to 10 minutes.  They come out so chewy, and my husband will usually eat the entire first batch right out of the oven, but he's a cookie monster.  I learned that if I wanted to have cookies for awhile, I needed to double the recipe.  Also, I make all cookies by hand because my mixer is tricky, so I let the butter soften in a bowl for about two hours.  Then, I mix all of the wet ingredients, then the sugars, then the flour and oatmeal slowly, and finally, the chocolate chips.  This is an extremely easy recipe to make without a mixer.  Thank you Joan!

Not as outrageous as we were hoping for, these cookies tasted much better the second day.  If I make these again I may add a little more oatmeal and a little less peanut butter.

You absolutely do not need to change anything in this recipe.  Just remember to let your butter softened a little bit before you begin. Remember always to mix butter and sugar first, then Peanut butter, egg and vanilla.  In a separate bowl, mix flour, baking soda, salt and oatmeal.  Add to wet ingredients.  When dropping by spoonfuls on the sheet, I pressed mine down a little bit.  This recipe is perfect just the way it is. I had to kick my family out the the kitchen!  We needed to save some for SANTA!

Swopped white and brown sugar, found it a bit too sweet. Cookies were a bit too soft but solved it by adding one or two more minutes (about 11-12mins) and leave it to cool before moving the cookies. Like the recipe and have used a few times. Usually I make the full recipe of 36 cookies (I made 47 from the full recipe). Loved by Husband and Kids!

The main problem I had with these cookies was very dry batter. To correct this I added an egg which made for nice fluffy cookies. I definitely recommend letting these cool on the cookie sheet before transferring to the rack. Overall these cookies have a nice texture. Not my favorite but good.

Very good twist on my usual chocolate chip cookies.  They are easy, bake well, and all of the flavors come through while complimenting each other.

OK, better not make THESE too often, or I'll blow up like a balloon...  Really good.  And today's day 2 and they're still really moist & chewy.

These cookies are heavenly combination of the most loved cookies; chocolate chip, oatmeal and peanut butter, wrapped into one.  They also hold over very well.  I made these for a bake sale on a Friday, and five days later, my personal stash was still delicious!  Thanks a million Joan :)

Great recipe.  Took it to work and everyone loved them.  Myself and a few others thought it was a little heavy on the chocolate chips so I may reduce them next time.  Didn't have problems w/spreading like others have stated.  Only thing I did different was mixed it like a traditional recipe.  Instead of "combine all ingredients", I creamed the butter, peanut butter and sugars, then added eggs and vanilla, then dry ingredients.  Cookies baked beautifully.

These cookies combine peanut butter and chocolate in a way that makes the cookies great. The oatmeal helps add a great texture.

I never seem to find the perfect cookie..and I think I did.  This turned out great and I changed nothing.  Adding some pecans or coconut would be nice but great as they are.  I often wonder why people change the recipe...add or delete things...then give it a lower rating??  Oh I did change one thing..I used Imperial Margarine as butter is too expensive to use for everyday baking.

I wanted to make some chocolate chip cookies for my son's birthday, but realized I was out of chocolate chips when I began the recipe.  So I threw in some peanut butter chips, added a bit more vanilla and they came out as really great chewy, double peanut butter cookies!  They were a hit at the party and almost all the other mothers asked for the recipe.  I will be keeping this recipe on hand, as it is quick and simple; anyone can do it.

I bake quite a bit and I was looking for something a little different but easy to make.  Though this was easy, the cookies were a little disappointing.  Just an okay flavor and texture.

well - i wanted to give it a 4 star - b/c they are good cookies - they are easy to make - and the recipe makes a good amount - but my husband thinks they are better than good - he thinks they rock - and he wants another -- so i give it 5 stars.

Yum yum yum. I literally woke my boyfriend up making these. They smelled soo good in the oven. I used chunky peanut butter and didn't put in the salt. I undercooked the first 12 and they came out soft and gooey, the next two batches I overcooked and they were crunchy. I like crunchy cookies though so it was all good. Definitly my favorite chocolate chip cookie!

These ROCK!  Ok... I only added one thing...Hershey's Cinnamon chips!!!! It truly made them the BOMB!!! I had to make a lot, so I tripled the recipe and added 3/4 of a package (7 oz) of the Cinnamon chips. This is the best combo for a cookie: Chocolate chip, peanut butter, and oatmeal w/cinnamon.  You've gotta try these! They're worth the calories!

Was looking for a "Monster" type cookie and so doubled the batch and made huge cookies, using M&M's rather than choc.chips and then before baking pressed additional M&M's slightly into the dough, covering each cookie.  Added a couple of minutes onto the baking time and WOW!  What a wonderful tasting cookie!  Try it, you will not be sorry you did!

These were terrific. The kids loved them. I replaced the butter with butter flavored shortening and three tablespoons water. Next time, I will use a combination of semisweet, milk and pb chips.

Absolutely Delicious!!  The one thing that I would recommend is to use softened butter.  I also, used 1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips, and 1/2 peanut butter chips.  This one will be in our family a long time.  Thanks.....

These are awesome.  I doubled the recipe and used quaker old fashioned oats for the oatmeal and creamy peanut butter. And as always a few extra squirts of vanilla. I would suggest that like any other good cookie recipe-you add the ingredients in stages not all at once.  It allows for a great cookie batter.  
The bottoms burn easier with this batter because of the peanut butter so I cooked for 10 minutes and they were perfect.  How could you go wrong with chocolate and peanut butter in a cookie-Thanks Joan!

I liked these, but they're kind of dry.  That might be my fault for baking them a little too long, or something in the recipe.  I also think that next time I'll use creamy peanut butter instead of chunky.
----------------------------------
I made these again for a potluck and used creamy peanut butter.  I used more than the amount called for and they tasted great.  I can't decide if I like the dough or the cookies better!  I may make some without chocolate chips.

A good cookie indeed, but not great or 'outrageous'.  It's definately a safe recipe, if you're considering making this for the first time for guests.  People will like them, and people will in turn... like you because you make a good cookie.  But, they won't love you for making GREAT cookies!

Very good cookies, but I'm not sure about all the "best cookie ever" raves. Crunchy healthfood PB is definitely the way to go, texture-wise. I like things browned, so I slightly overbaked mine, but now I'm wishing I'd let them stay a bit chewier. Next time I'll reduce the white sugar, as they don't need to be this sweet. Double the recipe for a REAL batch of cookies.

Excellent cookies!  I used reduced fat peanut butter and the taste was just fine.  Definitely bake them for less time rather than more--tried 11 min and they were a bit too crunchy.  Wonderful flavor and so easy.

This is a great one to make with kids.  We use only natural peanut butter, which yielded a wonderful flavor and texture.  My only (slight) complaint is that I think the cooking time is a little long.  My cookies burned, and usually my oven undercooks things.  However, we will definitely make these again!

I made these according to the recipe because I hate it when people change 10 things and then rate what they did. To me, they are a good cookie, but nothing great. It’s too little of too many things (little PB, little oatmeal) and I wasn’t getting enough flavor from them. I would probably give them four stars if they had some kind of nut in them. I felt like they needed a crunch. For those of you telling people how long they need to bake them, every oven is different. Mine were dough at 10 minutes. I had to do 13.

Love these cookies!! One tip: they can look done when they aren’t, because of the peanut butter coloring.

Made these delicious cookies for Valentine's Day . Made cookies plus a small cast iron frying pan for my Husband.  Absolutely wonderful but we liked the larger non-cookies version the best and next time I'll make as bars.  Followed the recipe  completely except I used natural crunchy peanut butter and no saletexcept for the salted butter.  Plan to make them again and again.  Next time I may use a variety of chips.

I have made these several times to rave reviews. One time, I even ran out of chocolate chips and made a batch without them and they were still delicious.  Some things I do: whip the first two steps each time until fluffy, but only mix dry ingredients until incorporated being sure to not over mix. I also refrigerate the dough for at least half an hour before scooping onto the pan. This helps the cookies stay thicker. I found the dark chocolate chips were preferred to semi-sweet.

These are really good, turned out perfect other than a slight baking soda taste, so I will probably reduce the baking soda a bit next time. Slightly crispy, but wonderfully chewy, good combination of texture and flavor.

I used almond butter and ground the oats before adding it to the mix.  Formed balls and pressed them down to form the shape since the reviews indicated that the cookies do not spread.  I baked half a batch for 10 min for a chewy cookie and the other half for 13 min for a crispy cookie.  They were delicious!

I have made this recipe numerous times and everyone loves it. In addition to the chocolate chips, I add 1 cup each of butterscotch and peanut butter chips, 1 cup of raisins and 1, cup of walnuts. I also use about 1/4 cup of coconut oil. Nothing quite like excess!

Excellent chocolate chip cookie recipe. Upped the vanilla to 1 teaspoon and oats to 3/4 cup and chips to 1 1/4 cups. Made with white chocolate chips too and they were as delightful as the semisweet variety.

I really enjoyed these cookies. I did make a couple of small changes. I reduced the amount of chocolate chips by half and added pecan pieces. Mmmmmm Good.

I made this with my little sister (11 yrs told) and we loved the flavour. We skipped the oats, and also added approx 2 tbsp extra peanut butter as the mixture was a little dry. It was simple enough to do with kids, but exciting enough that it wasn’t a premade dough from the freezer aisle. We would definitely make again.

These cookies are great! I made them just like the recipe was written. They took a little longer to bake but every oven is different. I don’t know what the bad reviews were about but as far as I’m concerned this was a great cookie recipe.

I don’t leave reviews, ever. I also am not a very good baker. My husband loves cookies and asked me to “try again” (for the hundredth time). I baked these and they turned out amazing!! So good! I did dark chocolate chips only because that’s all I had. I love the flavor combination with the peanut butter

Best cookie ever! Like some other reviewers, I added a touch of cinnamon and a little more vanilla. I also added half a cup of chopped peanuts and a couple of Tbls of ground flax for added nutrition. I use Old Fashioned oats and natural peanut butter. Best ever cookie! ??

Yum! This recipe was super easy and super delicious. I followed this recipe almost exactly. I didn’t have enough chocolate chips so I used what I had (1/2 cup) and then added 2 tsp of cocoa powder. I’ve never made cookies that didn’t spread but these did not at all. So definitely use a cookie scoop and flatten them just a little bit.

I really enjoy these, and they were a particular favourite of my mother's as well. The only thing I change is I always double the vanilla, and add about a tablespoon of cocoa powder to the dough itself, for a little touch extra without being too much!

Good cookies...needed to add 3 minutes to the bake time, recipe made 20 cookies...maybe mine were a little too big. Used cut up Hershey Kisses because I had no chocolate chips.

Love this soooo much!! My absolute favorite to bake right now..I would take the recommendation to mix the oats with the flour, baking soda, and salt. At first the cookies did a have a little bit of grit to them from the oats and I thought I missed something but that review did help!

Awesome recipe! I have made as written and this last time was craving them but only had a mixture of white chocolate chips, chocolate chunks and mini chips to equal the needed amount. Amazing! This recipe is a keeper! Thank you for submitting!

I made these tonight and they were ok.   I followed the recipe exactly.  I did not like the texture but they tasted ok.  They were kinda dry and not chewy.  Didn't really taste like a chocolate chip cookie.   I won't make these again.   If you want a traditional chocolate chip cookie, don't make these.  Try the big, fat, chewy ccc on this site.
They are really good.

No changes to the original recipe.  These came out perfect.  The only suggestion is to chill the dough a bit before scooping.

Made as directed but added 1/2 cup cream cheese and about 1/3 cup m and ms for color.  Cooked at 350 but took about 15 min which was much longer than most of the reviewers experienced.  They were a hit with the whole family.

Meh... these reminded me so much of chocolate peanut butter no bake cookies when I tasted them, but I like the texture and finish of the no bake cookie better, so I probably won’t make these again. Someone else said these cookies can’t commit to any of the 3 main flavors (chocolate, pb, oats) and I think that’s well put. I also really missed the crispy edges and gooey center of what I think is a perfect cookie and these were just dense and kind of lumpy. Don’t get me wrong- these will get eaten. But they’re just not fabulous or amazing to me.

I was looking for a soft oatmeal cookie and this fit the bill perfectly. I also swapped the amounts of the brown and white sugar to be sure they came out moist. They were perfect at the 10 min mark. It's a light, moist cookie ..PERFECT....A chocolate chip, peanut butter, oatmeal cookie. It doesn't get any better!!

My granddaughter loves to bake, so we tried this recipe for a fundraiser. The cookies are yummy, better the next day. I will use a bit more oatmeal next time for a little crunchier texture. We used chopped pecans because we love nuts in everything.

Amazing! It combines the best of all in the cookie world: chocolate chips, oatmeal, and peanut butter!  One of the best I’ve found to date.

Because I live where it is harder to get ingredients, plus I have to adapt for sugar-free and low or gluten free, here’s what I did.

1. Increased oats to 3/4 cup, grinding 1/2 cup to oat flour and leaving 1/4 whole oats.
2. Decreased wheat flour to 3/4 cup.
3. Used Truvia baking blend for both sugars. Increased brown sugar to 1/2 cup (1/4 of Truvia brown sugar) and decreased white sugar to about 1/4 cup(couple of TBSP of Truvia white sugar.
4. Used Herseys sugar free dark chocolate chips, 3/4 of a cup (which splits the bag in to 2 recipes!)

Next time, I will double the recipe, as I know they all will be eaten. Can’t imagine anyone not loving these Cookies.

These were wonderful, easy to make, and got many compliments at a recent party. The only changes I made were switching the ratio of sugars (more brown and less white), using a bit less of both than called for here, and using equal amounts of regular and fine oats. The result was a wonderful, not too sweet, melt-in-your-mouth cookie that got rave reviews. Definitely a keeper.

I made them in a 9 x13 cake pan and made them into bars and baked them for about 22 minutes. I used 1/4 cup Almond flour and 3/4 cup regular flour.  They are delicious!

So. Delicious. This is the perfect cookie, in my family’s books. I doubled the recipe and I made them as written, BUT because my husband isn’t a huge fan of the texture of oats, I ground 3/4 of them and left 1/4 whole. I took the first dozen out of the oven, left the room for a minute, and came back to find that my husband had stolen 6 already! Make these. Quick, easy, amazing.

I doubled the recipe and it made about 50 cookies.  Others said they didn't flatten out much, but mine did.  Baked them about 11 minutes.  

Nice and chewy inside, nicely crisp outside.  Delicious!

Made it today using white chocolate chips. I added an extra 1/4 tsp of vanilla. And I refrigerated the dough for 30 minutes before baking. 350 degrees for 11 minutes and done. I also switched the measurements for white and brown sugar. They turned out beautifully!

These are very good. I did what one of the reviewers suggested and switched the sugars measurements. I used crunchy peanut butter also. I will make these again. I think I’ll put some nuts in as well.

This makes a really rich and scrumptious cookie! The only change I made was to swap the portions for the brown and white sugar (so there was more brown than white), and it came out perfectly. These smell heavenly, and taste soo good, they are pretty rich though! I made a double batch, generously sized cookies, it took about 13 minutes per batch in my oven. Brought them to work and they're almost gone after only two hours! Thanks for a great treat!

I really loved these cookies they were super easy to make and were gone quickly. My family loved them. The only thing I did differently was I added two tablespoons of heavy cream after I made the cookie dough. Just because I love a really firm but soft and chewy cookie

Followed the suggestions by other users and switched the brown sugar and white sugar quantities. Made the most perfect moist cookie. I did make them according to the recipe exactly as well, and still preferred the quantities swapped.

Way more delicious than expected.  I would probably use less PB because it has such a strong flavor. I only had Oat Bran on hand so I used a food processor to have a finer texture. Used mini chocolate chips.  Still turned out great.

This is my go to  recipe.  I have made it many times.  I always double, triple, or quadruple the recipe because my family can’t get it enough.  I like to substitute holiday specific colored m-n-m for the chocolate chips.  Like red and green for Christmas or pastels for Easter and baby showers, or green and white at st. Patrick’s day or reds and pinks At valentines.

Yum! This recipe is awesome - I did not change a thing and they have a perfect little crunch and a lovely bit of chewy and a lot of delish. I've tried other chocolate chip recipes and it seemed like I must have been doing something wrong each time (too cakey was my biggest issue, or too crunchy and new chewy). Finally, success! I will be gifting this in tins for the holidays :)

Delicious!  This cookie has the best crispy crunch.  I love the peanut butter flavor.  They hold their shape.  My batch made 36 smaller cookies and I baked mine for 12 minutes.  This is a definite keeper!

Made these for my husband. He loves chocolate chip, peanut butter and oatmeal cookies, so this cookie hits all three at once. They came out perfectly soft and delicious. I did not change a thing, following the recipe to a T!!  Why substitute perfection?  Thank you for sharing!

These are definitely my new go to cookie recipe. I didn't feel like any of the flavors were too much, or too little. Just perfect. Plus a mix of all my favorites without having to add raisins.

As stated by my husband “These might be the best cookies I’ve ever had”. They are very decadent so one makes a full dessert. I used whole wheat flour and followed the tip to swap the measurements for the brown and white sugar. The batch made 18 good sized cookies. I will take some to my neighbours so I don’t eat them all!

Really excellent cookie!  Made mine dairy-free with “my” (non-dairy) butter and they are perfect.  11 minutes did it in my oven!  Also easy to make and quick!  These would be great to take to a gathering to share - I would definitely double the recipe or triple it, though - they will go quickly!

I substituted light brown sugar and substituted 1/2 c peanut butter chips and 1/2 c choco chips instead of 1 c choco chips. Changed it to 1 tsp vanilla extract. Turned out delicious!!

These do not spread and there's nothing in the instructions to say they need to be flattened.  Also, I found them bland and a little dry.

I love these cookies! My husband has to watch his carbs and sugars so I used 1/3 c almond flour, 1/3 c whole wheat, 1/3 c whit e flour. I used the brown sugar and Splenda. I can not imagine a better cookie. As written, ir must be mind blowing!

The taste was good but I did not care for the texture of the cookie. I did not change any of the directions and the result was a very crumbly cookie that does not hold its shape. Just doesn't hold up to my idea of a perfect milk dunking cookie.

Surprised by the rave reviews. They’re ok, but  but they’re not chocolate chip or peanut butter or oatmeal, so actually quite unsatisfying.

I did make a few changes, and got raves at the dinner. 
I doubled the batch, used palm sugar in place of brown sugar, and jungle sweet instead of white sugar. I switched the white and brown sugar ratios as well, for a softer, chewier cookie. Instead of peanut butter, I used half pumpkin seed butter & half cashew butter (what I had on hand). I also used half whole wheat flour and half gluten free. I recommend adding a whole cup of oatmeal, too, as I cut back to 3/4, fearing they'd be too dry, which didn't happen. To the second half of the batch I added dried cranberries, which kicked the flavor up a notch and helped the cookies hold together better. I baked them for 12 min, then allowed them to cool on the sheet before removing them. They were awesome!

These are great cookies. Instead of mixing brown sugar and white sugar, I simply used raw sugar. I also used quick oats instead of rolled oats and am super happy with how they turned out.

Made these and they were great, what I’d like to say is: make sure you actually use quality ingredients. People that give this one star after following the recipe did NOT use quality peanut butter (good quality=actual flavor)...the problem with cheap peanut butter is you end up with either a salty cookie, or cookies that taste bland. Also be aware of what kind butter you use, if it’s extra salty butter (guess what?) you get an extra salty cookie. Another thing to remember when making these is to blend and cream the ingredients well (the butter and sugar mixture) and do NOT melt the butter leave it out at room temp. most novices will melt it and end up with  cookies.

This was a big hit with everyone.  I used half chocolate chips and half butterscotch chips.  So easy to make as long as your butter is soft, and turn out perfect every time!

I'm pretty critical of chocolate chip cookie recipes, but this one was REALLY perfect! I thought the dough seemed like there wasn't enough flour, so after I put the first batch in the oven, I added about 1/3 cup extra to the rest of the double batch. I was SHOCKED when I checked on the first set of cookies already in the oven and found out that the other reviewers were right-- the cookies DON'T spread out and get totally flattened!! They were beautiful and tasted amazing. I am saving this recipe forever and ever!

Followed the recipe exactly and it turned out wonderful. The peanut butter flavor is there, but not overpowering. 10-11 minutes is perfect and leaves the cookies moist and chewy!

This is a great recipe and my family loved it. They were gone within 10 minutes. 
My only changes to the recipe would be to let the butter sit outside until soft, and to use 1/3 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar. Also, I baked them for 15 minutes.

I switched this up to make it Vegan and Gluten Free.  I used a cup of Gluten Free Flour, Vegan Butter and for the egg, I replaced it with 3 tbls of Aquafaba liquid.  I switched the sugars around to 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/3 cup of Coconut sugar and added a 1/4 tsp of water because it seemed dry.   It turned out great.  I also followed other suggestions and cooked for only 10 minutes

Great cookies. My daughter who hates Oates loved them. We couldn’t get enough. Followed other people’s advice and switched the brown sugar measurement with the white, and baked for 10 min. Excellent and satisfying.

This is the second time I have made these. I made some changes to bump up the flavor. First I browned the butter and let it cool before adding it to the recipe. I also added extra chunky peanut butter, 1/4 cup of peanut butter chips and used dark chocolate chips. The brown butter gives a Carmel depth of flavor.

Awesome cookie. I made them exactly as written and have to say I'm a bit stymied by some of the reviews. I didn't find the dough stiff at all. The cookies spread nicely. They certainly didn't taste salty. The flavour balance was excellent. If you're looking for a sugary sweet chocolate chip cookie, keep scrolling because this isn't it. But if you enjoy a subtle peanut butter flavour and a nice oatmeal texture, this is a great cookie.

Amazing!  I used peanut butter chips bc I didn't have chocolate - so good.   If I use chocolate next time I'll use milk chocolate.   I got 48 cookies using my small cookie scoop, and baked for 9 min.  Thank you for the amazing cookie recipe!!

These are really really good. It's a keeper & a repeater.
It's in the chocolate. Use dark chips.

Theses are the cookies I make just about every week ever since I found the recipe. I veganize them by using Earth Balance sticks for the butter and Bob's Red Mill Egg Replacer for the egg. Otherwise I follow the recipe as written and my four kids (vegans and non-vegans alike) LOVE them!  Great combination of ingredients!

These are dangerously delicious. I asked my daughter to taste test one and 3 were gone before I knew it! I would only complain that the batch size be increased because they disappear too quickly. Very, very tasty and I usually like all of these elements separately; chocolate chips, peanut butter, oatmeal. Thanks for posting this recipe Joan!

I followed this recipe to a T except that I used almond butter that I had already opened up in the fridge.  No, you don't actually taste the almond butter per se, but the final product is a great chocolate chip cookie!  Everyone enjoyed them and I would definitely make this recipe again (I'll try peanut butter next time).  A keeper!

I made these cookies for a family dinner, and they were a hit! I followed the recipe as-is, no changes. I used Kraft all natural peanut butter, and large flake Quaker oats. I'll be making these cookies again!

Other than using dark chocolate I made these exactly by the recipe. The batter was really dry and crumbly so I was worried. I pressed and formed balls and baked for 11 minutes and they turned out perfectly!

Followed the recipe to the letter.  Cookies are nothing outstanding.  Agree with one reviewer who says "they do not spread out while baking" and this is true.  But they are nothing to write home about.  I do like the fact there is both peanut butter and oats in these, which makes them a tad healthier.  I might up the vanilla next time, if there is a next time.  Maybe a little orange zest?  The oats give it a nice texture.  If you underbake a bit, they will be softer.

A fast and simple recipe VERY EASY to bake,  I replaced the flour with finely -round gluten-free oats. The end result....A perfectly proportioned soft cookie that held its shape, had melted gooey chocolate chips, and was also gluten-free. 

10 minutes on convection at 375 degrees. Rotate pan 180 degrees after 5 minute to avoid unequal baking between each cookie.

I followed the recipe precisely except for the cook time. As other reviewers, I took my cookies out after 10 min. They turned out flawless. The peanut butter flavor is just right and not at all overpowering. I will make this for many years to come.

Great recipe. I made it gluten free because we were having a party and one of the children has celiac disease and two of them have peanut allergies. I subbed almond butter for the peanut butter, used coconut sugar in place of the brown and white sugars, and used gluten free 1 to 1 flour instead of all purpose.  The cookies tasted great and everyone loved them!

Such a disappointment! Not really a chocolate chip cookie. It’s a peanut butter, oatmeal, chocolate chip cookie with very little flavor. I am not new to cookie baking, love chocolate chip cookies and have made many different recipes, but I will never make this one again. Sorry!

I swap the sugar for 12 packs of stevia. It taste pretty good though, my brother enjoyed it. And i use confection oven, turns out it need lower temp and longer baking time. I bake it at 150C for 14-15 minutes.

These cookies were great. The addition of the peanut butter to the chocolate chip recipe, along with the oatmeal, really make these standout compared to normal chocolate chip cookies.  I made these for a cookie exchange and many of the kids that helped out as taste testers like these best!

This was a hit at church. I did tweak it a bit. Instead of using white sugar i added more brown sugar. Also put a half cup of cream cheese in it. They turned out soft and chewy.

I thought these were delicious cookies, although not a traditional chocolate chip cookie due to the addition of oats and peanut butter.  I only had about a 1/2 cup of chocolate chips left in my pantry so I added 1/2 cup of peanut butter chips, otherwise followed the recipe as written. Loved the texture the oats added and will definitely make again!

I made it just as written a couple of weeks ago.  They were a hit, but a tad bit on the dry side. The second time I made them, I switched the measurements of the sugars as others have suggested and they were perfect!

These were good... did not make a lot at all! I forgot that the peanut butter has salt so it seemed a little salty to me. But otherwise they were nice and soft!

Since I have celiac and can not have regular flour, I substituted a gluten free flour blend and it turned out great.  You truly can’t tell they are Gluten Free.  Full of flavour, moist and a perfect recipe for us people with a gluten issue.  Try it out!  You won’t be disappointed.

Yummiest cookie I’ve ever tasted!  12 min wasn’t quite long enough baking time for me- it took my oven 15min (but my oven doesn’t seem as hot as others) . I loved the sweet/salty combo and subtle peanut butter taste Mmm

Made exactly as written. Baked a batch for 10 and a batch for 12 min; they don't brown much, and 10 was better for chewiness. The PB is really evident without being overpowering; the chocolate chips made for an intense chocolate bite. Delicious. Made 42 cookies dropped by scant teaspoon.

Followed recipe except added 1/2 cup chopped pecans. 10 minutes is perfect timing. Rolled 1/2 the dough into 1inch balls and froze them to bake later. Baked the frozen cookie dough for 13 minutes.. Delicious. Will make again

Wow, these really are good! I love chocolate chip cookies and make them a lot. This recipe with a hint of peanut butter is awesome, and it will be a keeper. The only downside is that it only makes 2 dozen. You will definitely want to double the recipe!

These are by far my husbands favorite chocolate chip cookie! I've made them many times.  The last time I actually used two packs of maple brown sugar instant oatmeal. Because I had nothing else on hand.  And they were still amazing !

While my cookies taste great, they're pretty dry. Next time, I plan to switch the measurements of the brown and white sugar, as suggested by guevarafamily4, to combat that.

I tripled the recipe, but only used 1 1/2 C chocolate chips total – that was plenty. I also used honey peanut butter, which I highly recommend! Mine took 11 minutes for chewy and 13-14 for crunchy.

Followed the directions as is and they turned out perfect. Had to bake for 12 minutes and my cookies did spread to be larger, which per the reviews didn't happen to others Cookies!

We really didn't like these. The peanut butter in them made them a bit strange to us. Also, they crumbled easily (could have been a baking error).

I found this recipe and it sounded like a great combo. after making it once it became my favorite cookie recipe. It's a great go to cookie recipe to satisfy your crazy cookie crave. I have made this recipe over a dozen times and just about know it by heart now.

These cookies were great!  I doubled the recipe & had no problem getting rid of all the cookies.  They turned out nice & soft and chewy.  Will definitely make again - maybe add M&M's next time too!

This cookie did not need to be improved upon- tasty treat as is!  However, I'm both a peanut butter fanatic and vegan so here's what I did: I replaced the egg with a smashed ripe banana, increased the amount of (Smucker's Natural Crunchy) peanut butter to 1 cup, I added a half cup of coconut for texture, and I also added a half cup of Reese's Piece's candy from the baking aisle (they're vegan too!).  With this single recipe, I made two dozen cookies and an 8x8 dish of blonde brownie style bars.  Totally delicious and completely cruelty free!

The people I gave some to all liked them.  They are going into my favorites list.  Very good and a little bit of a crunch with a softer center.

UPDATE: So my original post as a bit too quick. I am changing it from 1 to 4 stars becuase once the cookies set up and were cooked a little longer, (amazing what 1 minute longer can do) the flavor was better and they held their shape. I am still not a fan of the amount of peanut butter (it can overwhelm) but I got rave reviews at work. Yes, I took them to work...lol

Amazing! People raved about them. 
I awaped measurements of white and brown sugar for a chewier cookie. 
I made them into handful balls and ever so clightly pressed down. Not too much though if I want it to remain a chewy rather than crunchy cookie.
Really do only cook till edges are turning brown to make for a chewy cookie.

Since this was my first time making, I followed the recipe. I had a little Ghirardelli milk chocolate chips, mini semi-sweet chips, M&Ms, and chopped pecans. I like the texture and flavor. Saved the recipe for future.

Made these exactly as recipe states. Baked 11 min - came out amazing however hubby wished there was more of a peanut butter flavour to them - I put 1/2 cup and a spoonful (all my leftover) but will try more next time! Highly recommend !!

SO DANG ON GOOD!!!!!! Hubby and I literally devoured in a day and half!!!!! I knew it was bad when I woke up at 2 am and grabbed a plate with 3 cookies on it and ate them half-asleep in bed!!!!!! So good!!!!! (Felt guilty about my teeth all night! aggggh!!!!!) I did NOT care for the peanut butter smell as I HATE peanut butter cookies, but these tasted JUST LIKE Chick-fil-a chocolate chunk cookies!!!!!! The oatmeal definitely added an exquisite texture and the semisweet morsels paired perfectly! we also added a whole tsp of vanilla extract. Soooooo *@#& good!!!!!!

LOVE THESE!!! I strongly recommend them to anyone looking for a great recipe with a quick preparation and cooking time.  I slightly underbaked them (about 9 minutes)  for personal preference, and added a teensy bit extra peanut butter. All 18 of these were devoured in one afternoon. I can't wait to make these again!

My Family and I *LOVED* this recipe/cookies!  (So much so, *blush*...that I actually had to hide some, to make sure they would last).  Family was "SO HAPPY" when they 'thought' they were done...but I brought out the hidden container a few days later! hehehe  Really a neat combination of 'tastes'...and makes a nice textured cookie.

These were fantastic! Thank you for the recipe, I will use it over and over. They came out moist, full of flavor, soft and crispy edges.
I did add another 1/2 cup peanut butter and 1/2 cup flour. I am at a higher altitude.

Excellent cookies, they are crisp on the outside but soft and chewy on the inside. Truly delicious, though for my oven I had to do them for 15 mins and they were perfect. One of the better cookie recipes I have made yet, thanks for posting this recipe!

I swapped the sugars as someone else suggested. Other than that, followed the recipe. While I wouldn't have minded a stronger peanut butter flavor, it wasn't a bad cookie. Perfectly buttery and crunchy on the outside like a peanut butter cookie but chewy on the inside. The oatmeal lends to the chew I find. It's not super prominent which I think is a good thing - you've now hidden fiber in that there cookie! Maybe not outrageous but good cookies.

My husband and I had the same initial reaction: Wow. Just wow. Based on another reviewer (this is why i love Allrecipes site) I did switch the white sugar and brown sugar amounts.  This is a minor change that doesn't in my mind impact the 5 Star rating.  Really a perfect cookie.

I took the advice and switched the sugars measurements and used crunchy style peanut butter. Excellent. Texture is like a peanut butter cookie and very tasty.

Recipe mimics that found on Robin Hood AP Flour packaging. The biggest "hit" cookie at our local library. Changes: I add 2 tbsp. milk to the "creamed" ingredients for a moister cookie, refrigerate dough for at least three hours (helps hold the dough together when it is panned), and scoop the dough with my small cookie scoop. It is our favorite chocolate chip cookie and the best seller at bake sales.

These cookies are decent, but they are missing a bit of pizzazz. I've made a batch that I will serve at a church function, but I won't be adding this recipe to my cookbook.

I added a bit more vanilla, dark chocolate chips and only used a 1/2 cup of sugar. The cookies turned out great, I'll be saving this recipe!

YUM!! My son is allergic to peanuts so I never make peanut butter things, but today I was craving it. So we tried Wow Butter instead of PB and it was perfect! So good. Followed recipe exact. It made 2 dozen cookies. So I put two trays in the oven at the same time. Pulled out the first tray after 10 mins. It didn't look cooked enough so I left the other tray in for 4 more mins. We all prefered the 10 min cook time. Slightly crispy around the edges and chewy on the inside. Our new favorite cookie!

Have been looking for a cookie recipe that will satisfy the whole family and this is it.  

Just like others, I have made some tweaks:
1.  I modified the brown/white sugar as suggested in another review.
2.  I grind 1/2 C. oats to make oat flour.
3.  I also add 1/2 C. wheat germ.

I have learned to make a double batch which works great.  10 min. in oven is just the right baking time!  

My husband and 13 yo boys love these!  I can alter the amount of choc chips, pb and oats to make them either more of a treat or  more of a "good for you" type snack.  

Thanks for the recipe - it is a keeper.

Really tasty cookies! I had the "bright" idea of using a chocolate chip/peanut morsel mix so mine turned out more peanut butter cookie than chocolate chip. But, that happens to be my boyfriend's favorite, so I guess my sweet tooth hankering worked out pretty well for him. Thanks for this!!

I didn't have chocolate chips in my pantry, a sin, I know, but you know what: the butterscotch chips tasted wonderful in this recipe. I've already eaten two with my tea and it's almost time to make dinner. I'll make this recipe again.

It's a peanut butter cookie with chocolate chips. If these came out dry and rubbery than you did something wrong. My kids loved these and I need to hide them from my wife now.

I did the same as  another cook and swapped the brown sugar and white sugar. I added a tablespoon more peanut butter and only baked them 9 minutes. I also used dark chocolate chip at my husbands request.

These are  absolutely the best...you can make them soft or chewy. I added  corn syrup 1/3c. As I had no brown sugar wonderful and not too sugar tasting. Love the PB ...just enough

4.5 stars.  I loved the fact that these cookies didn't flatten out as many other cookie recipes do.  The taste was good, a nice blend of flavors without one or the other being overpowering.  I did add pecans, otherwise I made them as written with the addition of chilling the dough for 2 hours before baking (I do this with all cookie recipes).  I would make these again.

Absolute wow!
After years of using this site for recipes, I've never felt compelled enough to create an account and review a recipe - until now.
These cookies are the definition of what I consider the perfect chocolate chip cookie - slightly crisp on the outside, soft and a little chewy on the inside.  
I used quick oats in place of rolled oats because I didn't have any on hand, but now I am so glad I did. 
For people who complained of the cookie not having enough flavor, invest in a good vanilla extract. I always use Mexican vanilla extract in my baking (you can find it on Amazon), which has a more potent and slightly different taste than your typical vanilla you would pick up in the grocery store. 
Happy baking and thank you for the great recipe!

Just made these and enjoyed one fresh with my coffee!  Love the texture and the flavour!  I too, like a flatter cookie, so I shaped them and let cool for 5 mins before moving to cooling rack.  Made as directed and would not change a thing!

Cookies turned out well. They don't spread out at all when baking. Put 3/4 cup semi sweet chocolate chips and 3/4 butterscotch chips. The butterscotch took over a bit. I will probably emit them on the next batch

The best.  I used natural peanut butter that had the oil poured off the top before stirring (we always do that with a new jar to reduce the oil).  Fine shortbread like texture yet softer.  Mine stood up a bit taller than the picture but the result was a lovely little cookie.  Will definitely make again.

No changes... 2.5 dozen... Great flavor... They only spread somewhat so you can put them a little closer together... I did use two cookie sheets with the last one having 1.5 dozen on it... Like the hint of peanut butter... Really good cookie! Forgot... 11 minutes in my oven was perfect!

Yum!!! Deelish!  I only added 1/4 cup of Flaxseed powder (& 1/4 tsp of Cardamom spice (totally unnecessary,...I just like to add to cookies & sweet breads 4 a lil extra flavor.) I doubled the recipe as Chocolate Chip Cookies don't last very long @ our house! ??  For some added fiber, I replaced 1/4 cup of the flour w/the ground Flaxseeds.  Hubby can't tell but makes ME feel better knowing I'm eating something healthy in the midst of a decadent Chocolate Chip Cookie!

I absolutely love this recipe, all that I have tried previously were just flat and boring, these are the best cookies. They come out perfectly. And what I love about it is that you can make a batch or two and freeze and just take what you need when you need it, it goes straight from the freezer to the oven and still comes out perfect. Kudos to the inventor of this recipe.

These turned out great. I used another user's suggestion and out 1/2 tsp cream of tartar and it gave it that puffy cracked top. Now, I will add that I have celiac disease so I made these with gluten free flour. IF you're using GF flour, you need to add an extra 1/2 cup of butter or your batter will be too dry. ??

I followed this recipe to a T - except for cooking time.  The cookies were wonderful, but do not over bake like I did.  They ended up hard.  I was concerned that they were not done.  Well they were.  I also agree that they do not spread while baking, so I made patties out of them.   I will make these again!!  Even though they were overbaked, everyone gobbled them up!!

Love this recipe, I substituted the all purpose with whole wheat flour,to keep things healthy, the white sugar with organic cane sugar and I usually add a bit more oats than the recipe calls for. They're delicious!

Fantastic recipe! Swapped the sugars like others recommended and used half white choc chips and reg chips because I ran out of milk chocolate and they were DELICIOUS! Very moist with the perfect amount of peanut butter flavor. Watch the oven, 10 minutes was the perfect cook time.

the taste was good, a little bit on the dry side, yes, they do not spread much...but if ya want a cookie that's a little bit different, this is a good one. Enjoyed the chocolate & the P.Butter together, & the added oats, but isn't my absolute favorite...would I make it again..maybe.  I prefer a choc chip cookie w/ added nuts...plain & simple. But this was good & pretty easy.

This is the best cookies recipe I have ever made.  The only thing I changed is the 1 cup of brown sugar I used Splenda brown.  We are trying to cut the sugar in our diet other than that 10 thumbs up!!  Oh and a few less chocolate chips.  
They were moist but crispy around the edges..... these are a magnificent cookie.  Thank you for this great recipe.  It is a keeper ; )

I made this recipe and changed the quantity to 24.  One batch I used a cookie scoop and the result was a semi-flat cookie, but still delicious.  The second batch I formed into balls and slightly flattened with a fork.  The result was very uniform, consistent sized cookies, and again delicious.

We love these.  I think they have great flavor.  The only changes I made was that I used Country crock sticks instead of real butter and switched the amounts of sugar, as recommended by another reviewed.  I ended up getting 2 dozen cookies out of the batch.  I will definitely make these again.

Er. Ma. Gersh. These are the best cookies ever. Almost no spreading at all. Next time I might try splitting the chocolate chips into thirds and replacing two of the thirds with white chocolate chips and butterscotch chips to make a cookie that will make you pass peacefully into a sugar coma just by looking at them.

These cookies were really yummy, but I agree with the reviewers saying that the recipe was a little bit bland. I switched the measurements of brown sugar and granulated sugar. Next time I think I'll try adding more peanut butter to give it a more exciting flavor!

WOW. Yum. I kind eyeballed the oatmeal & chips, and they came out perfect and gooey at 10 minutes. All the 1 star reviews said too thin, burnt, etc. You didn't make them right. Sorry:) 
Perfect. Five stars.

I made it exactly as stated and they were delicious!! I used mini chocolate chips which I prefer and they were a soft chew cookie just what I like.  I think next time the only thing i would change is to omit the salt or use salt free butter but that's just personal preference.

I have made these many times from this recipe. They are our favorite chocolate chip cookie. Super tasty with the slight flavor of peanut butter. I have no reason to try any other chocolate chip recipe!

Nice flavor but the texture was not good.  Way too soft!  I read the other reviews that said 10 minutes was perfect but I kept them in closer to 15.  Maybe could have used more oatmeal, 1/2 cup didn't seem like enough.  Not sure I'll make these again.

These are really good. I brought them to work and had two requests for them.  I hate making changes to recipes and then reviewing them. But I did add a spot of cream of tartar to these. They were nice and puffy, and moist inside. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I made a batch and it was easy  and they were good. Better than store bought any day and I know what they are made from and when. I also freeze them and warm them in the microwave  when snacking.  Just like right out of the oven.

I made these cookies just as written except that I doubled the salt to 1/2 teaspoon which emphasized the popular salty-sweet taste, added 2 teaspoons real vanilla extract and used mini semi-sweet chocolate chips.  I pressed the cookies down, in a traditional peanut butter cookie pattern, with a fork. Since they don't spread, the pattern evened out the dough into uniformly thick disks. They were easy to prepare. Make sure to cream all wet ingredients well before adding the dry. Used a 1 tablespoon releasing scoop for the dough. These were a perfect texture - something like pecan sandies and perfect crunch, sweetness and overall mild peanutty flavor. I used organic crunchy peanut butter and unsalted organic butter, and baked on middle shelf for 12 minutes

This is a PERFECT recipe.  I made it exactly the way it was written and they turned out perfectly! I am a notoriously poor cookie maker. My cookies literally never have turned out UNTIL TODAY! In the past, they are either flat or cake-like to avoid the flatness. I learned from this recipe and reading reviews not to over mix after adding the flour. I think that is the key! The flavor and texture are exceptional. Thank you!!

A really great recipe. I doubled the amount of the ingredients and made smaller cookies than the standard. This way I got 63 (!!!!!!) cookies. Very nice taste of the peanut (I used crunchy peanut butter), vanilla and chocolate. I can just recommed you to make it!

These cookies are delicious!! Made them as written except I added a bit of extra peanut butter and vanilla, I also rolled them into balls and pressed with a fork.  Baked for 10 mins based on other reviews and they turned out perfect.  This will be my go to recipe.  Everyone whose tried them has loved them.

Will definitely make this again!
After the first batch strictly following this awesome recipe, 
we added 1/2 cup of oatmeal and 1/2 cup of peanut butter chips.  Nice flavor enhancer!
Thanks and enjoy!!

These cookies are wonderful. I doubled the recipe and they came out perfectly.  Tender like a peanut butter cookie with ooey chocolate chips and more substantial with the oats.  My oven must be a little off, because they had to bake 14 min. Maybe my cookie scoop made a bigger cookie.  Even the last tray that I left in the oven too long were tasty, not burnt.

Amazing chocolate chip cookie!!!  I think this will be the go to recipe!  We used dark chocolate chunks and grass fed butter for my daughter that can't eat other butters. It is a thicker cookie which is awesome for an all butter cookie. I thought 8 minutes ended up a little dark on the bottom, so I lowered the temperature to 325 and 8 minutes worked well. Don't go 10 minutes without checking on them.

I was making this recipe for my 2 and 4 year old. I didn't have an egg, so I substituted a small banana. I made the cup of flour 1/2 cup white flour, 1/4 cup wheat and 1/4 cup flaxseed meal. All those added nutrients in the banana and flaxseed make me feel a little better about giving the kids cookies! They were super moist, and the banana made it sweet! Boys ate them up and I will be making this recipe again, thanks!

I made these cookies exactly as written...and they were delicious! They didn't spread too much and  the texture was perfect. I think the amount of oatmeal was exactly enough to know it was there but not overpower the cookie. And then you get the suddle flavor of peanut butter and the sweetness of chocolate chips. This is a winner! Thank you for sharing!

Mine spread quite a bit, picture added. I did not add the chocolate chips. I don't think that was the issue, was I wrong? Maybe.

Love this cookie, but I did replace 1/2 the chocolate chips with peanut butter chips. It's like a peanut butter cup ...but healthy because it has oats right?

Very subtle peanut butter flavor -- not quite enough oats for me. Wish they would have thinned out a little more while  baking.

I used a full cup of butter rather than half butter and half peanut butter. I also used quick oats rather than rolled. The dough was very moist and the cookies flattened right out into a single sheet of cookie. Now, a sheet of cookies is awesome in its own right, but I was hoping for individual cookies :) So next time I'll cut down on the moisture and see what happens. Flavour was still fantastic.

This recipe is the basic for most cookie recipes. I didn't add peanut butter because I'm not a fan. I substituted molasses for brown sugar cause I was out, actually worked out better. It really depends on your oven because in mine it was only 7. Happy baking

Things I like about this recipe: only uses 1 egg, the batter is easy to work with. I had everything in the house. They don't really spread in the pan, which was awesome. I used part butter and part shortening because I wanted to finish up an open stick up butter. Didn't seem to matter. The peanut butter taste was very subtle and the oats seem like an afterthought. I'd make this again just for ease.

Love the texture! And loved that it only called for one egg and 1/2 cup butter! 10 minutes was perfect after they sit the 5 waiting to cool!

I've made it (exactly as the recipe calls for) many times. The first couple times I brought these cookies to events, I got rave reviews. Which of course prompted me to make them again. At this point, they are my go-to recipe. I always have people comment on how good they are, and even have people request that I bring them to parties.

My husband enjoys chocolate chip cookies, while I'm always reaching for the peanut butter cookies. This cookie recipe marries the different tastes to create a match made in heaven. 
 I added an extra dash of baking powder to make the cookies more voluminous and soft, as I do with any cookie recipe.

Knowing my husband loves PB, chocolate chip cookies and oatmeal cookies, I made these for him to bring to work. However his reaction was, "I can't take these to work, they're way to good!" Now I have to double the recipe every time so he will share. Awesome!!

Great cookie recipe, loved the melt in your mouth texture. I omitted the white sugar entirely (personal taste) just used the brown sugar 1/3 c  and found the cookie tasted sweet enough. Baked my batch 18-20 min and didn't find them over cooked. Will make them again. Thanks for the recipe.

I love these cookies!! The only thing I did different was the cook time. I tried two different timings per batch. The 12 min cookies were darker and crunchier. If that's your thing go for it. I then tried the next batch for only 11 min. They seemed light and uncooked but after sitting on the cooling rack for about 5mins they darkened and pulled together. I prefer the softer 11min cookies myself!!

I have made loads of cookies, and these are my favorite.  I added 3/4 tsp of cream of tartar to this recipe, and cooked them on a pizza stone.  I made them pretty large (1/3 cup dough) and cooked them for 20 minutes. Ridiculous!  I'm impressed.  They look like bakery cookies.

Seriously outrageously amazingly delicious! That pretty much sums up everything anyone needs to know about these cookies! The perfect balance of flavors, I love how the peanut butter doesn't take over from the other flavors. I used dark chocolate chips as that's what I prefer, and doubled the vanilla. Will make these time and time again!

These cookies were pretty good but I found them a bit crumbly.  I added a 1/2 tsp more vanilla extract to boost the flavor and we substituted Reeces mini chips and Skor chips for chocolate chips.

My daughter and I made these together. The two changes we made were that we put half the sugar in and half the chocolate chips. They are so delicious, we are trying not to eat them all right away;).

The end result was a yummy cookie but half of the batch burned. I followed
the recipe exactly and even after the time said to bake they were mushy yet the bottoms were burned. We cut off the bottom and liked the cookie but couldve been better.

These cookies are delicious!!! The only changes I made were to switch the amounts for the sugars - I used 1/2 c brown sugar and 1/3 c white sugar.  I omitted the salt because I used salted butter.  I also added an extra 1/2 c chocolate chips to make them really chocolatey. The kids devoured them.  I will be making these again!!

Ah-mazing!! I followed this recipe as is and it was great, I did a pinch more salt because I like the salty sweet taste and loved it. I did a second batch however and it turned out even better! I did half the vanilla it called for and the other half I used almond extract, also instead of the chocolate chips I did crushed (unsalted) mixed nuts with dried cranberries. Holy. Cow. It was phenomenal! I will make both batched again!! But I'll for sure keep adding a pinch more salt and splitting the vanilla extract with almond extract. Great recipe!!!

These cookies are awesome.  I love peanut butter so they are great for me.   My husband and kids prefer the White Chip Chocolate Cookies by KatColter.  These two recipes create very different cookies, so depends on your preference.  Since I love PB these are my pick.  I highly recommend trying them. I'm not the best baker and both of these cookies have turned out great for me.

Absolutely loved this recipe. This will be my go to chocolate chip cookie recipe from now on. It has the perfect blend of my 3 favorite cookie flavors. I used 1/4 cup of crunchy peanut butter and 1/4 smooth peanut butter, it came out the perfect consistency. Since the recipe only calls for 1 cup of chocolate chips and usually a bag contains 2 cups, I melted the other cup and drizzled the chocolate over some of the cookies. Outstanding. This recipe is a keeper!

great recipe! I have been making this for years, my husband loves chocolate chip cookies but hate peanut butter. The first time I made this recipe I didn't tell my husband they had peanut butter in them and he absolutely loved them and it has become our favorite chocolate chip cookie! When doubling or tripling this recipe I always find there are left over chocolate chips in the bottom of the bowl. there are a few too many chocolate chips for the cookie to hold together when making large batches. I just scale back about a half a cup cause we love lots of chocolat chips, oh and I have tried the cookies with milk chocolate and there are not very good because they are over sweet and they are missing that sweet and salty taste. Amazing cookies!

I whipped up cookies following this recipe, only substituting gluten free flour (I used Krusteaz) for the flour.  I chose natural chunky peanut butter, and it really added to the texture.  I saved this to make again.

This was a very good cookie :) It had just the right amount of peanut butter and chocolate, the oatmeal is noticeable but not too noticeable. I will be making them again! I didn't change a thing in the recipe and they turned out fine. I would say the 10 min mark is fairly accurate and just like others said, the cookies don't spread as much as normal chocolate chip cookies but maintain their form much more. Also, these cookies are not really soft, but rather the type to be a little crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. I think they are perfect!

These are addictive cookies! I used a little more brown sugar and a little less white sugar and a lot less than 1 cup of chocolate chips. Half a cup is plenty I think.

Just tasted them and they were AWFUL!  WAY way too salty.  Went thru my work and made sure I didn't mess up the ingredients and the only thing I can think is that the peanut butter (just plain old generic store-brand stuff) added salt.

My family declared these "amazing"...these cookies are just about perfect! I love the combination of peanut butter, oats and chocolate chips to make a not-too-sweet, perfectly crumbly cookie. I made the recipe exactly as written. I could see using different kinds of chips for variety, but the cookie itself needs no tweaking - just don't overbake. Even BETTER the 2nd day!

I couldn't stop eating the cookie dough and cookies! Pretty easy to make. Room temp/warm butter helped make whipping the ingredients easier. I will be making these again, and again...and again.

Meh. They where okay. I probably wouldn't make them again, but only because the flavour wasn't very, well, outrageous. Based on the reviews, I was expecting a phenomenal cookie. But, they where just chocolate chip cookies with a few oats in them. I would not make them again, but then again, I was hoping for more of the oat and peanut butter flavour. These would be PERFECT for someone really craving a chocolate chip cookie. Sorry.

Was hesitant about giving this four stars, but it is good. I didn't add the baking soda and switched out all the sugar for a combination of dark and light brown sugar to prevent dryness and to make it a little denser. I recommend melting the butter and sugar in the warming oven first because it made mixing so much easier. Vanilla taste doesn't come through even with extra, unlike some recipes. My main problem with this recipe is it loses its charm if you let them sit over night. Peanut Butter, Oatmeal, and Chocolate Chip flavors are not distinct either.

These were great!  I used the large milk chocolate chips from Whole Foods and baked to ten minutes.  They are so moist and soft.  Next time I'm considering using peanut butter chips instead.

Easy, fast recipe! Made it as written out. Will probably add more peanut butter next time I make these, just personal preference. They weren't done at 10 minutes, so I turned off the oven and left them in a closed oven for about 25 to 30 minutes- they were perfect! Crisp outside and chewy inside. Delicious! :-)

I made these cookies and they were delicious!  I did make a few alterations, just for personal taste. I reversed the measurements of the white and brown sugar, I added an extra 1/2 tsp of vanilla and used crunchy peanut butter! This will definitely be my go to cookie recipe from now on!!

it needs more flour, and you can reduce the peanut butter and have a perfectly good cookie.

Very tasty. Just made these... According to Directions, except I put 1tsp vanilla. Fresh out of oven! Took about 11-12min. At 350, but I made them big. My husband likes them. I wish there was a little more oatmeal flavor, next time I may add more oatmeal & less peanut butter but that is a personal preference, not a flaw to the recipe. Thanks for recipe!

Wonderful recipe!! I doubled it and my daughter accidentally put more ground oatmeal and less flour but it still was great!! I also used olive oil since that's all I had. I also used half peanut butter and half almond butter because I was short on pb! They were soft but crispy on the outside.  These are great!! I will make again!!Nutritious, and so easy to make!!!Yum!!!

I think The Award Winning Soft Chocolate Chip Cookie recipe is much, much better only gave 3 stars because my husband thought they were okay.  I found them to be a little dry, bland and the peanut butter overpowers chocolate chip flavor.

I made these as written with the exception for needing more flour. I had to add half a cup more, but check your dough before you do because you might not need to. I also had to bake them about 12 minutes, but that's might just be the way my oven bakes, it's propane. All and all these cookies are the ones I will go to when I'm looking for a chocolate chip cookie. Awesome job on the recipe.mthanks for sharing!

This is my family and friends favorite cookie !!  I started making in January and I have made a 100 batches since.  I used a tablespoon scoop and make them smaller but thick .... Like little cookie nuggets so the bake for 20 mins.  I just automatically double the recipe every time I make it.  Best homemade cookie ever. Thank you for the submission.

This cookie was like an oatmeal chocolate chip cookie and a peanut butter cookie to together and had a perfect little baby!  We added an extra 1/4 cup of sugar, but otherwise followed the recipe. We liked the extra sweetness, but I do believe it would have still been 5 stars without it.  The 10 minute cooking time was perfect.  They come out very gooey, but cool to perfection...lightly crisp edges, but firm & chewy throughout.  My husband hates gooey cookies, so I cooked the second pan for 12 or so minutes, until all of the edges were visibly brown, and that made them all over crunchy after they cooked completely.  Not my preference, so I'll stick with 10 minutes.  Loved these.  All my favorite cookies rolled into one!

I tried these because everyone wanted something sweet and I was looking for something quick that I had the ingredients for. I was hopeful by all of the great reviews, but I've been disappointed by reviews before. Not this time!  These cookies are quick to fix and everyone who ate them said they were the best chocolate chip cookie. I thought the texture of the oatmeal would be more prominent, but it wasn't. The peanut butter was a nice addition without being overbearing. The only thing I might change if it were just me would be the amount of sugar. I thought they were a bit too sweet, but then I'm not normal.

Since I like my chocolate chip cookies to be moist and after reading a few of the reviews, I decided to try 1c of brown sugar and 1/4c granulated sugar. And, WOW, delicious. Thank you for the recipe.

In honest opinion I followed the recipe but made it with a slightly smaller cup and they came out perfect. I must truly say these are a must have in the book.

I had some chocolate and butterscotch chips to use up so I typed in chocolate chip cookies and tried this recipe. I left out oats because I didn't have any and added half chocolate chips and half butterscotch chips. I was surprised by how good it was. My family and I ate them all before the next morning, couldn't stop. They were soft in the middle and crunchy on the outside, tasted like a Reeses peanut butter cup only a cookie.

I was looking for a healthier cookie recipe than traditional chocolate chip and gave this one a whirl. The only substitution I made was margarine for the butter (I was out) but they still came out great. Easy for the little guy to help with and a lot less refined sugar than most I've used in the past. What a great recipe, everyone who's tried one loves them! Thanks for sharing!

Seriously... these are so easy and awesome! I made them as is, only I did not have butter at all. I replaced it with a mix of apple sauce and corn oil (half-half). The result is still just as scrumptious. Love this recipe, it's easy and forgiving and everyone runs for it. Try to stop yourself from eating them as soon as they come out of the oven all half-baked-like, because you won't be able to stop...

This was my first time ever trying to bake cookies. With this recipe, they turned out wonderfully. The texture was amazing, just creamy enough for cookies. However, instead of adding semi-sweet chocolate chips,I added milk chocolate chips,because my family has quite the sweet tooth.

I followed this recipe exactly! The cookies were dry, not chewy or soft.  They didn't flatten at all so they look like they hadn't cooked.

Just made these. They were just okay. They tend to crumble and the peanut butter taste was a bit much. I would prefer a straight chocolate chip cookie recipe.

I originally gave these 3 stars with above comment when the cookies were straight out of the oven.

BUT, when the cookies cooled, I loved them and ate them every day!

Absolutely delicious!!  A great combination of three mouthwatering flavors.  Soft in the middle with a slight crisp on the edges.  The oatmeal flavor does get slightly overwhelmed but it still holds as a great foundation for the cookie.  My only suggestion is to lessen the chocolate chip amount to 3/4 of a cup instead of 1 cup, because then the peanut butter would shine a little more.  But really?  They come together easily, smell amazing in the oven, and well, I'm sure they'll be gone in less than 24 hours....  :]

The texture is nice and they are thick and chewy. However, the cookie itself is not very sweet, almost bland.

These are good, dry cookies. Dry is not a bad thing, I'm just stating it in case you are looking for a moist cookie recipe - this is not it.  They also crumble easily, so they are not ideal for shipping.  The combination of oats, peanut butter and chocolate chips is yummy.

By far one of the most delicious cookie recipes I've ever baked. My taste-testers don't like oats, so I left those out; I've never baked cookies as light, flavorful and fluffy as these! Use milk chocolate chips for added richness and you've got a winning treat. Will be baking these again for Christmas and for fun. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I made these and they were excellent! The only thing I changed was using Gheredelli bittersweet chocolate chips instead of semisweet.

I love this recipe! It's one of my favorites. I add peanut butter chips and use chunky peanut butter. Also I always cook them for 14 minutes minimum.

I'm not a huge fan of peanut butter, but these cookies are amazing. Replicated the recipient exactly and it was perfect.

Made these today. Added what I had left of mini kisses chocolate chips and filled the rest of the cup with mini semi sweet chocolate chips. So tasty. Next time though I think I wont add the salt.

I don't love chocolate chip cookies. My husband, on the other hand, thought they were great. I had to leave these in my gas oven for 14 minutes, but I'm at high altitude (4,500 ft). Probably won't make again, but not a complete fail either.

The best cookie I have found on this site!!! The only thing I have changed is on putting about two tbsp of jif peanut butter instead of the recommended amount so that it wasn't to overpowering. I continue to get request from whom ever has tasted them.

My husband doesn't like chocolate chip cookies and I thought he was going to hurt himself with these. The second batch I made without the chips but added raisins and they were equally good. The third batch was with coconut instead of the chips. This is definitely my husbands favorite cookie!

I like to try different kinds of cookies. I liked these because they were fast and easy to make. I think they could be a little sweeter and would recommend using milk chocolate chips. I liked the idea of these cookies having multiple tastes. I am not a big fan of peanut butter so i only put in a little bit and it turned out great.     The texture turned out great and i would recommend trying these cookies. And to those who said these cookies were horrible they really weren't that bad...

These bake up beautifully.  I always chill my dough a bit befor baking which helps with the spreading issue.  This dough does not need much chilling.

Awesome! Such great cookies. I have made them several times now and they seem to disappear faster then I can pull them out of the oven. I have even altered the recapie to make just peanut butter cookies by adding more peanut butter and no chocolate (due to a chocolate allergy) and those were even better! They don't flaten out and the texture is better than any cookie I have ever bought! Thank you for sharing!!

Love these just as the recipe is written. Crispy on the outside and chewy in the middle. Just the right amount of everything - not too peanut buttery! Stay crisp in the tin for as long as they lasted!

When I baked these cookies, I added a package of vanilla pudding mix. This secret ingredient makes the cookies very soft and moist! Try it out yourself! ;-)

These are my new favorite chocolate chip cookies! I love the subtle peanut butter taste (I love peanut butter, but peanut butter cookies tend to be too dry for me). I dissolved the baking soda in a little water and added it into mixture before flour.  I also cut down the chocolate chips and added extra oats instead.  Delicious!! It was hard to not eat all the batter.

So, just to let everyone know - you must put in the oatmeal for these cookies to be a success. I decided not to put in oatmeal and they became as flat as pancakes. Lesson learned. I also left out the peanut butter so that it would be nut free. All in all the recipe was ok, it was a bit sweet for me and they still did flatten out a fair amount. I still think I would prefer them without the oatmeal though. :)

Made these looking for something different.  Great recipe, but could have used a little more oatmeal.  We added nuts for the last dozen, and hubs said that made it better.  I will most definitely be making these again.
Update:  After the cookies disappearing within a couple of hours, I felt I needed to give all 5 stars!

Very easy recipe to follow, I added 1/2 cup of coconut shreds as well to add a little bit of flavour to it.  Unfortunately noticed I didn't have any brown sugar so substituted it with more white sugar therefor cookies were more of a "chocolate chip sugar" cookie but still very yummy ! :)

This recipe is simply brilliant! I did modify a bit though. Instead of using chocolate chips I bought a large Hersey's milk chocolate bar and roughly chopped it up to about the size of chips. The extra shreds of chocolate melted nicely throughout the mixture, but didn't make the cookie over chocolatey.  I also used crunchy peanut butter to add to texture. I recommend these modification to go above and beyond an already amazing cookie.

These cookies are so great right out of the oven that I need to make another batch already. I used 1/4 cup unsalted butter and 1/4 cup butter flavored shortening. Instead of dropping them on a cookie sheet I rolled them in balls. They made nice, soft puffy cookies. I will make these again and again...

Very good but I used Vanilla nut flavoring and a full teaspoon of it, really added a more well-rounded flavor! Yum!

I altered the recipe a bit, using nutella instead of peanut butter due to a peanut allergy, added a tablespoon of cinnamon and 3 tablespoons of nonfat greek yogurt to make the cookies a bit softer.  Overall great recipe

This recipe was AMAZING and EXTREMELY YUMMY!!! The peanut butter was not overpowering in taste, the cookies were not really crispy ( If you're anything like me, I like my cookies more soft) they were just perfect. I will definitely be making these cookies again! They were simple and pretty quick to make. 

Thank you for sharing!!!

I made these as written. I thought they were good. The family thought they were good. We will probably make them again but they weren't jaw dropping great IMO. the one thing I did love about them was they didn't spread a ton. The texture was really very good.

I love this!  You don't have to choose you get it all.  These bake up into some pretty looking cookies AND they are yummy to boot.  I texted my hubby and told him I made him chocolate chip, oatmeal and peanut butter cookies.  He asked if it was Christmas.

These cookies are awesome. I added only wheat flour and white sugar because in my country brown sugar is kind of expensive but it makes no real difference and cookies are just delicious. When I took them out of the oven I was disappointed because they turned out too soft and were falling apart when I tried to move them from paper sheet but after 10 minutes every thing was ok, cookies became firm and their texture was great.

This recipe is fantastic! I doubled the recipe ingredients exactly as written. Creamed the butter and sugar really well with my mixer. Mixed the eggs and vanilla together in a separate bowl. Then added the PB, brown sugar, and egg/vanilla mixture to the butter/sugar and used my mixer to cream all together. 
Stir in flour/oatmeal/soda/salt mixture by hand. Finally used mixer to add in chocolate chips.  So easy!  I used parchment paper on two cookie sheets and switched out pans.   An easy tip is to take the parchment off the hot cookie sheet when loading the next batch so the cookies don't start to melt before cooking. 350 for 10 minute. The cookies look a little doughy, but let them setup on the cookie sheet for 3 minutes and they are perfect! I also use a old ice cream scoop (almost 1/8 cup) to measure out my cookies and the double recipe made 61 cookies.  Basically taking me about 30 minutes to prepare and 60 minutes to cook. I really loved the way the cookie dough was so easy to handle.

Followed the recipe with the exception of using a 2tbs cookie scoop and baking them for 12-13 minutes. They were delicious! The texture and flavors work perfect together. This is a keeper!

I don't know if it's because I skipped dinner, but I thought these were delish! I followed other reviewers' advice and ground the oats. I used my own oats/chia/flax mix I usually make brekkie with. 

I used 2/3 ww flour and 1/3 white, crunchy peanut butter and probably half the sugar. These taste healthy, well as healthy as you can get with a cup of chocolate chips AND peanut butter. They do not spread, but if you roll them and flatten, they look GREAT and not like the lumps that were my first batch. 

I agree with others: there is no specific flavour, but they remind you of all three, well two in my case since I ground my oats. Next time, I will blend the ground oats mixture with the flours and THEN stir in the wet ingredients! Not a bad half an hour spent!

Holy deliciousness! This was a great recipe. I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup white sugar. I didn't have any oats, so I used 1/2 cup dried, unsweetened shredded coconut instead. I also chopped up 15 Dove dark chocolate squares to use in place of chocolate chips. The result was a divine cookie!

These were amazing!!!! I made it with chocolate chunks, a bit more than the recipe called for, crunchy peanut butter, and no oatmeal (using what I had already) and they were super delicious! I baked them in a baking pan and then cut them into squares and they were very moist and rich. Saving this recipe for sure

This is a fantastic recipe!  I've been looking for a cookie recipe that combines the chocolate chip/oatmeal with peanut butter. I followed the recipe almost to a T.  I did go ahead and beat the peanut butter, egg and vanilla with the creamed butter mix after scraping the bowl first.  And I love vanilla so I put 1 tsp vanilla in.  But I baked them at 350 in my convection oven for 10 mins and they came out slightly crisp on the outside and soft inside!  Excellent texture and not too sweet!  Thank you for sharing this recipe!  It's now one of my regulars!

I follow the recipe to a "t" and they turn out PERFECT every time.  The only possible change I would make is to say "do not over bake" - I usually bake for a minute or two less so that they are nice and chewy.

This recipe sat in my recipe box for 8 years.  I wish I had tried it sooner!  Great taste, texture absolutely wonderful recipe!  We added an additional cup of M&Ms to the batter for some fun color, so yummy.  This is going into the rotation for our Christmas cookies, it is that good!

Great tasting cookies.  I only got two dozen cookies rather than the three stated.  I will double the recipe next time.  Oh, there will be a next time! Delicious!

Too crunchy for my liking and it really wasn't anything special. Not enough peanut butter flavour despite adding an extra 1/4 cup. Don't think I'll be making these again.

First let me say I don't like peanut butter in my deserts but I tried this recipe anyway. I wanted to make something different since I always just make regular chocolate chip or oatmeal raisin. Since I had all the ingredients I thought why not. I made this as written no changes needed. This cookie is so delicious. I will definitely be making again.

This is the best cookie recipe I have ever try. My kids and husband loves it. I make them once almost every two weeks and have it throughout the week. I follow the recipe to the tip except I added 1/2 a cup of white chocolate,1/2 a cup crunchy peanut butter and the other 1/2 smooth peanut butter to it as well. I also lower my temperature to 325• or else it'll burn too quickly.  The texture and taste so soft and great with a ice cold glass of milk. Definitely recommend this recipe to anyone.

I love this recipe! Like other reviewers, I ran 1/2 the oatmeal through a food processor simply because I like that texture. I have used all sorts of different add ins from peanut butter chips, to pecans and even M&Ms and it always comes out great! Thank you, Joan for a great recipe!

I was looking for a quick cookie to throw together but didn't want one that was overly "greasy", something that was a bit more substantial. THIS IS IT!! Goes together in no time, used a good size scoop to measure them out and then flattened them slightly with a fork before baking. Due to making them a bit bigger (about 2 1/2" across), I had to bake them 12-13 minutes. Perfection!! They don't spread out much, have a wonderful flavor and a perfect crispiness yet still chewy. These will now be my "go to" cookie!!

I doubled the recipe, except for the chocolate chips, I only used 1 cup. The cookies turned out great, a little crunchy, a little chewy too. I went with the 10 minutes time on the first tray but then cooked the rest of the trays at 12 minutes. I was also using a stoneware pan, so kept them on the pan for 2 minutes extra before moving them to a cooling rack. Great recipe!

Good texture, full of flavors.  I didn't deviate from the recipe.  With that said, I'm not quite sure if I'm red hot with the addition of peanut butter in this mix.  The oats were obscure in my opinion, so I would suggest adding at least a 1/4 cup more.  Be careful, though, not to get the mixture too dry.  All in all, a good cookie.

Have tried this recipe twice now.  The first time for a group of teenagers at a sledding party.  Made a double batch and all were gone!  Everyone thought I was a genious!  I did reduce the oatmeal by half.  Next time I made them exactly with full amount of oatmeal.  While my kids still love them, I like them with about 2/3 the called for oatmeal.  This is now a must cookie recipe in our house.

Soft and chewy. Perfect taste. Followed directions as is. But I was out of Brown Sugar so I used a heaping tablespoon of honey, a drizzle of syrup and an extra scoop of sugar.

Loved these cookies. I experimented and used a muffin tray to stop the spreading and keep the consistency of the size, worked like a charm. A wonderful chewy cookie that I will def make again

I was looking for a new chocolate chip cookie recipe. It's hard to find a different, exciting chocolate chip cookie recipe bc...Well, it's chocolate chip cookie. After looking at the ingredients of several different recipes, I came across this one and was intrigued. It sounded cool that it included chocolate chips, peanut butter and oatmeal. I was a little worried bc the cookie dough itself didn't taste all that great bc of the oats. The baked cookies, however, we're amazing! They turned out thicker than unexpected, but that's alright. My entire family loved them! Not a single cookie was leftover!

Very good....the first chocolate chip cookie I've made that actually looks the way it should...not like a pancake...awesome! I also replaced 1/3 cup flour with 1/3 cup of oat bran...just to try and make them healthier cookies ;)

These cookies are outrageous - outrageously good that is! I made them just as the recipe said and they were great! I don't think I can go back to normal chocolate chip cookies.

I thought these cookies came out horrible. To much flour! I would only put 2 cups of flour.

THE PERFECT COOKIE. It is a great baseline recipe, but does well with substitutions and alterations.
My favorite so far: I use coconut oil instead of butter, almond butter instead of peanut butter, and I also add 1 tsp of farm fresh milk, 3 tsp of roasted sesame seeds and double the vanilla.
EVERYONE LOVES IT!

The texture of the cookie is good and the flavor is very good. I love the peanut butter and chocolate combo. You have to make a very small cookie to yield 3 dozen cookies. My batch made 28 regular size cookies. Also the baking time takes longer than 10 or 12 minutes. I watched mine close after 10 minutes and they took a good 15.

Love love love it. I've made them several times. I have reduced the sugars twice, and they were still perfectly sweet. I also just made them adding a bit more peanut butter than the recipe calls for, and split the 1 cup of chips with 1/2 c peanut butter chips and 1/2 c choc chips. Yum

This was a great recipe. The only issue I had was that I used whole wheat flour instead of white flour since that's all I had in the house and they were a little thick, but everyone loved them nonetheless. I think they will be even better when I make them again with white flour.

I tried this recipe twice so far, I reduced the sugar a bit and replace part of chocolate chip with raisin to make it healthier. It came out terrific. My boyfriend and children love it. My aunts and in laws wanted to bring some home. It's a combination of regular cookies batter with peanut butter and oatmeal, plus chocolate chips and raisin that made this recipe a winner and irresistible.

Cowabunga! These were SO good right out of the oven! I used white whole wheat flour to make them healthier, and my daughter brought me milk chocolate chips, so that's what I used. Wonderful! 

They didn't spread out like chocolate chip cookies normally do (and like the picture), so if you like them flat you might want to flatten them a little before baking like you do with peanut butter cookies. And I took them out at 10 minutes (the minimum suggested time), but I might check them at 8-9 minutes next time to keep them a little moister.

In my mind, this is a perfect cookie - combines all my favorite things - chocolate and peanut butter, and it stays thick and doesn't flatten out.  SOOO good.

We doubled the recipe and used just a little less white sugar and a little more brown sugar instead.  We set the timer for 10 mins baking for each batch, and they were perfect. They had a nice shape (no flat pancakes).  My family's new (and only) chocolate chip cookie recipe.

Great traditional chocolate chip cookie with a twist. I followed other reviewer's comments and processed the oats slightly in a food processor. I also used chunky peanut butter. Both additions produced a wonderful texture. I chilled the dough before baking (the key to a softer, less flat cookie, in my opinion) and baked for about 13 minutes. I doubled the recipe and made about 40 cookies. A big hit.

Awesome.  If you love peanut butter cookies, oatmeal cookies, and chocolate chip cookies; you will love this recipe.  I took the advice off one reviewer and switched the brown sugar and white sugar proportions.  The texture is perfect baked for 10 minutes.  I used Nestles dark chocolate chips.  The best chocolate chip cookie recipe in my opinion.

I didn't have peanut butter so I added Nutella.  I ran out of sugar so I used stevia instead. The chocolate chips made them perfectly sweet. I think I will add the same amount of both baking powder and soda next time.

Delicious!  I left out the oats since I wanted a more classic chocolate chip cookie.  This one was perfect.  It's definitely a keeper!  One thing to note is that these cookies do spread out quite a bit in the oven so make sure you don't put your cookies too close together.

Definitely the best cookie recipe by far. The taste & texture is great! There was only one thing I decided to change: cut the sugar amounts in half (as I always do). Oatmeal, chocolate chips and peanut butter is one interesting flavor mix! Thanks for the recipe!

As Is. This is a great cookie. I double the recipe and their all gone in no time. I do all of my baking on parchment paper. This recipe does not need a book written about it. Try them and you will love it.

This recipe was A-MAZ-ING! I made it just as written, and they turned out perfectly. For my oven it took 12 minutes and I would say that one batch only makes 2 dozen, not 3. This is my new favorite cookie recipe!

this is one of the BEST recipes I have ever made for CC cookies!  For years, I have made the recipe on the back of a Nestle Tollhouse CC bag and I will never go back to that again!  THIS is the cookie to make!  I followed the recipe to a T.  Also, I used the Kirkland brand natural peanut butter.

I liked the recipe b/c of its simplicity. I substituted 1/2 of the semi-sweet chocolate chips with 1/2 Nestle's Premier White Morsels. I thought this combination was also very good as a little different flavor.   .

This is a good recipe. I made it the first time today. I followed the directions to the letter and it is a good cookie. I have to say when I first read the ingredients that I thought a banana will go well with it. After eating the cookie my daughter and husband said the same thing. Next time I make this I will add 1 banana and try another reviewer's suggestion and turn the oatmeal into a flour. Apparently my kids aren't crazy about oatmeal cookies. I think changing the texture will fix that. 
Update 11/29/13 I added a banana, my son loved it, but to me it needed more so I added about 1/4 cup Nutella. This recipe is a keeper!

This is the easiest and the best cookie I have made. The only changes I made (and only because it was what I had on hand) is dark chocolate chips and chunky peanut butter. Exact serving size and cook time. Thanks!

This recipe was great!!!!! At first I was skeptical after reading the ingredients but thought I'd give it a try anyway. So glad I did. I made exactly as written and wouldn't change anything. But since I used a small scoop I only cooked 9 min @ 350° which yielded 3-1/2 Dozen. I will definitely be using for my upcoming cookie exchange. Thank you for sharing.

These were outstanding.  I was skeptical because I am a purist when it comes to chocolate chip cookies.  I used chunky peanut butter and swapped the amounts of white and brown sugar.  I like the depth you get from brown sugar. These turned out amazing.  Shared at work and no one believed me when I said it had oatmeal and peanut butter in the recipe.  I HIGHLY recommend you try this.  Follow the baking suggestion too of letting it rest on the pan for 5 minutes after baking.  They are too crumbly to move otherwise.  They bake up perfect after that 5 minutes and transfer easy to a cooling rack.  Wonderful recipe.  Thanks so much to the poster!!

A bit thin.  Will try 1/2 butter, 1/2 shortening next time.  Otherwise a really good cookie.

I would give this 4.5 stars if I could. The texture was nice and they turned out pretty good, but I was a little disappointed in the flavor. Just expected them to be a little better. I added less than the called-for chocolate chips, and it was still too much...The kids thought they were pretty good, and the hubby liked them, but they were not our absolute favorite cookie. Nice for variety every now and then, though. Thanks!

I used unsweetened apple sauce instead of butter and it was delicious. This is a total keeper. All our favorites in one. I agree that the 10 minute mark was perfect

I make these probably every 5-6 weeks. I would not at all consider myself a baker but I never have problems with them. I love that I always have the ingredients for them on hand. I line my pan with parchment paper  so that soaks up a lot of the grease other people have complained about. I am able to drop them on the sheet but they cook more evenly when I press them down with the spoon. I also add a little extra vanilla or have tried coconut extra instead which give them a good flavor. Don't be tempted to add extra oats or chocolate chips or else they won't hold together.

These are so good!  I had given up baking because I just didn't have the knack for it, I mean, I can cook, but I definitely can't bake.  I decided to give these a try and I am so happy that I did!  They are wonderful!  I followed the recipe exactly as written.  I was a bit worried when I mixed the first batch of ingredients because it looked a little dry, but after adding the batch with the egg it turned out perfect!  Thanks so much for sharing this one, I can't wait till my kids get home and taste them!

Neither my husband nor I really cared for these. He actually made a face when he tried them and he eats any kind of cookie around. My tastebuds weren't sure what I was eating, which I think is part of the problem. Too many different tastes going on. I followed the recipe exactly. I won't make these again.

Good flavor although a little light on chocolate chips for my taste and you can definitely tell the oatmeal is in there. I will add another 1/4 cut chocolate chips next time. I also added a heaping 1/4 cup of peanut butter chips as recommended by another reviewer. It was a good addition. I found that the cookies do not brown much--you cannot rely much on color to tell when these are done. Overall, really good, but I'm going to keep looking and tinkering.

My family really liked these cookies, they only lasted two days!! I did not care for them as the taste of peanut butter was a little overwhelming. I also did not use semi-sweet chips as requested by my family I used white chocolate chips. Maybe next time I will make it with the semi sweet chips and it will be better.

My husband loves peanut butter cookies so when I saw this recipe and how it incorporates peanut butter into the base, I knew he would love them. I added chopped pecans and they were divine. I will say that I never get cookies to bake in 7-10 minutes. I almost average double that but they still taste amazing!!!

I love these cookies.  I usually quadruple the batch because I take them to work for the officers (I work in a prison).  I like them better when I halve the baking soda and add baking powder (equal amount).   Perfect!!!  These cookies make everyone happy!

Love the combination of chocolate, peanut butter and oatmeal.  I use crunchy peanut butter for a better texture and the oatmeal gives them an even yummier flavor. Followed the recipe and didn't change anything.  They are one of the best chocolate chip cookies ever!

These cookies came out perfect! I followed the recipe exactly except instead of butter, I used butter Crisco. Took them to a cookout and people thought they were store bought since they looked so perfect. People were going back for seconds. My husband ate half a dozen before we even went to the cookout.  Great recipe!!

I  gave these a 3 because what's not to like about chocolate and peanut butter. On the other hand, I have definitely had way better homemade chocolate chip cookies. These were dry and too cakey.

OMG ! I found this recipe about two weeks ago and asked the baker in the family (my wife) too please make these for me .... long story short she spoils me ; ) ..... Made these cookies that night for dessert.....I'm a self proclaimed cookie connoisseur...cookie monster if you like...lol...these are hands down the best cookies i have ever eaten !!! So moist , so chewy , not too sweet.... Just the perfect mix of peanut butter and chocolate .... Can not even truly begin to describe how good these are ! two big thumbs up ! A must try ! Like I said found this recipe about two weeks ago and between my wife son and myself we have eaten 3 double batches ! the only thing i would change about this recipe is double it .....Cause you are going to need more cookies than this recipe makes...lol !

This recipe was a huge hit!  We loved the combination of peanut butter, oatmeal and chocolate chips.  It was just the right amount of each.

YUM YUM YUM!! These were SO good; they lasted only one night. I loved that I could bake them crunchy for me and softer for the grandchildren. I will be making them again soon.

I didn't have rolled oats so I used quick oats and they were still yummy:)

These were delish! A great combo from three great cookies. These were a hit with everyone. They didn't spread too thin, and were crispy and chewy all at the same time. This one's a keeper. Thanks!

Wow! great recipe for a tasty cookie. The flavor of peanut butter but not overwhelming. This recipe was perfect. Chewy on the inside and crispy on the outside. I tried several chocolate chip cookie recipe most where flat , hard after a few hours or cake like. I will diffinely try this recipe again. Thank you for sharing this great recipe. Two thumbs ups!

Prepared as directed, except that I baked in a 9x13 for about 19 minutes. They were soft and chewy, but bland. These may be better with more peanut butter and chocolate chips, but I won't be making these again as is.

These are pretty good. I think I would like more peanut butter flavor in mine, possibly, and DEFINITELY more oats. I love very oatmeal-y cookies.  But these were tasty and easy to make and we liked them. Thanks for the recipe!

I followed this recipe exactly.  They came out perfect (I posted a picture of them)!  They didn't spread, were chewy and delicious.  They are not super peanut buttery, but I liked that.  They are loaded with chocolate chips which I also liked.  My oven took exactly 12 minutes, the bottoms were just slightly brown when I pulled them out.  I will make these again, and again, and again!!!  Thank you so much for posting this recipe.

Followed as is, however used a large cookie scoop, which required about 16 min cooking time, then transferred directly to wire rack. Great cookie for something a little different!

Honestly I love baking and my family and friends love my baking, but one thing I've never been happy with is my cookies. I've tried lots of different recipes and this is by far the best recipe. This is the best cookie I've ever had. Amazing texture and taste!

These were awesome!!  I made a double batch today and gave them out to my neighbors, many asked for the recipe and I sent over second.  I made exactly as written, used crunchy peanut butter because that's all I had, but I liked it.

Made exactly as written and I must say a MOST delicious cookie.  I did take away one star because mine did not spread as shown in the picture [which I assume is the baker's] and I am not a big fan of a drop spooned shaped cookie. I also used a 1 TB cookie scoop, and again those came out ball shaped. I really like my cookies to spread. Just don't know what I did or didn't do.  No worries. Nice cookie. Really. I can see adding some cinnamon or peanut butter chips to make them truly outrageous, but as is a very nice recipe.
They won't look done when you pull them from the oven but let them cool on the sheet - do NOT attempt to eat them. Too hot and melty. Only after 5 minutes should you move them and attempt to eat. They also travel well to various colleges [and my kids] on the east coast. YAY!
Nice cookie Joan. Thank you.

Very easy to make. A few things that I did not mind that I would not dock a star for are the fact that they are really good but REALLY rich(a good way to remedy that is to make the cookies smaller). Other than that it seemed that it was a little dry and crumbly but it doesn't bother me much. I pushed a few of them down with a fork to see how that looked and all though they did not look bigger they looked nicer. The other way were you just drop it, it would puff up but not out so it would look clumpy(Test it and see what you like).

WOW!!! I just took these out of the oven and I am impressed! These are the prettiest peanut butter OR chocolate chip OR oatmeal cookies I have ever made or maybe even seen :) They are perfectly mounded (I used a cookie scoop) and not flat at all! They are nice and 'fluffy' and taste wonderful. I will never make a regular peanut butter cookie again! I made them exactly as the recipe but used crunchy peanut butter and mini chocolate chips. The only question I have is...why is peanut butter not in the name?? They should be called Outrageous Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip Cookies!

Tried it and loved the flavor but the fat ratio was way too high. I doubled the flour and liked the consistency much better.

Fantastic combination! My favorite new recipe. These are full cookies, but still chewy. I don't like bready ones. I used Momma's Almond Blend Gluten Free flour and no one would know they were gluten free! Love these!

Yum.  These cookies actually taste better cold in my opinion.  I like them right out of the freezer and will make a double batch next time.  Next time I will also do half and half flour/oats and add in more peanut butter and chocolate chips for a bit of a more decadent cookie.
Update: I have made these cookies countless times with the above changes, and they are AMAZING!!!

This recipe should be called "kitchen sink cookies" because you can throw just about anything in there and still get a great cookies. It's a wonderfully flexible recipe that lends itself to customization of what's in the pantry, and what your personal preferences may be. Even beyond that it's a great recipe as written. That's (5) stars!

This is the BEST chocolate chip cookie recipe I have ever tried, hands DOWN. I didn't alter the recipe at all (and I usually alter most I am given). The cookies were chewy and not too peanut-buttery, but just enough for peanut butter lovers, too.

I have been making these for 20 years, got the recipe off the back of a bag of flour.  However, after making them a time or two, I made one change (and my recipe is double this one):  I use a bag of milk chocolate chips and half a bag of semi-sweet.  The peanut butter with the milk chocolate is so good!  I've had people to beg for these and buy me the ingredients!

Came out a little bland. I would prefer either a PB cookie OR a chocolate chip oatmeal. The combo didn't do it for me.

WOW! These are just amazing! First batch, first cookie right-out-of- the-oven good! Didn't tweak the recipe a bit, only baked on parchment paper and these are perfect. I am taking these to my job interview, I will let you know if they are getting-the-job good!

We loved, loved, loved these!  Easy to make, and the flavor is great.  Just a hint of peanut butter, lots of chocolate.  A wonderful soft and chewy cookie.  I used margarine because I didn't have enough butter, and they turned out exactly the way I was hoping they would.

These cookies are absolutely delicious! I decided on making them impromptu while my friend was spending the night and have since shared them with classmates, and the cookies have become an instant hit. Everyone who tried them insisted on the recipe-haha. Since we are all grad students in public health, I made a few healthier substitutions (they are cookies, so either way it isn't healthy). Based on the recipe for a baker's dozen, I added two tablespoons of flax seed meal (for fiber), 1/3 cup chopped walnuts (for crunch), I substituted with whole wheat ground flour (that is the only kind I own), and because it is not all purpose I added a 1/4 tsp of dry active yeast, and I used butter substitute instead of butter and I used raw cane sugar as well instead of white sugar (that what I own). Absolutely delicious. Everyone who has tried them has fallen in love, and I cannot wait to try adapting them to be dairy free for my vegan friends. I would add a photo, but as soon as they were put on the table, they were gone!

This is my favorite cookie recipe! It's sweet, nutty, and perfect with a little over a cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips. I use all-natural peanut butter and it always turns out great. This is the perfect recipe for get-togethers with friends or family, or even as an after-school treat for kids.

Awesome cookies!  I love sweet and salty, so I gave it a rounded 1/4 tsp.  Perfect!  I also subbed half of the white flour with whole wheat flour, and it didn't seem to change the recipe.  These are very satisfying!

Great cookies! I upped the vanilla to 1 teaspoon. I also found that 1 cup of chocolate chips was a little over kill, I did half cup and it was perfect! So over all it was very good, the oats added a fabulous texture!

I've only made chocolate chip cookies ten or so times but these are the most incredible ones yet. Quite chewy. As someone else said, the peanut butter taste is not intense - these aren't peanut butter cookies. The batter was kinda sticky but I'm glad I didn't add more flour. Took around 11 minutes to bake.

Great taste, but not very oatmeal-y. Next time I will also use quick-oats instead of regular rolled oats. Overall a great cookie, definitely worth a shot!

I thought these were good, but I agree with some of the other reviews- it was dry. I like my cookies to have a little moisture to them, so I didn't give these 5 stars for that reason. Thanks for a good recipe though! :)

these are my favorite cookies ! The peanut butter and oatmeal makes them more dense but more filling an rich so I'm not tempted to eat them all at once ! The best part is that the peanut butter gives them more flavor and keeps them moist...these are hard to mess up !

I made these just because I was in the mood for cookies to share with friends & they were a HUGE success. I made them as written for the first couple batches & then after I got comfortable with the recipe I substituted the chocolate chips for butterscotch chips for half the recipe & those disappeared faster than the chocolate chip ones! The chocolate chip ones are still my favourite, though!

This is definetaly my new fave! Although, I did mix it up a bit, adding 2 Tablespoons of Nutella with the peanut butter, and a 1/4 cup of Rice Crispies. I did have to add a bit more flour than listed, though. The kids love it!

Delicious cookie!  I switched the measurements of brown and white sugar as many suggested.  Cooking for less time is better to retain moisture.

This is absolutely the best chocolate chip cookie recipe EVER! It is so quick, so easy and is OUTRAGEOUSLY delicious every time I make it! Everyone who has tried has loved it. Most of them ask for the recipe. When I give it to them, they can't believe how simple it is! Thank you from me, my family and my friends for this perfect recipe!

I was not impressed with these cookies and don't really understand why they get such high ratings. They were easy and came out nice and soft, but they are nothing to write home about. They are a little greasy and not very interesting. Good, but I will stick with my other recipes, which produce better results.

These cookies are amazing!  I followed the recipe exactly except I accidentally put in 1 tsp of vanilla and I only had Ghiradelli milk chocolate chips on hand.  The flavor and texture are awesome.  Thanks, Joan for sharing this!

I was disappointed at the dryness of these cookies. I think if the recipe includes less of the ingredients, i.e. not peanut butter or oats, the cookies would have tasted much better.
My room mate said they were great. 
Luckly I bake for college students, so taste is not as important as free!

pretty good cookies (everyone who I served them to liked them). The flaws I saw were that for some reason they didn't stay together very well even though the ends were brown, the bottoms felt a little grainy, and the oatmeal stayed somewhat chewy in my mouth long after i swallowed the cookie. i might make a couple adjustments next time.

YUM! It's like 3 cookies in one.  I've made these twice now.  First time as written, since that's what I'm rating on, very good.  Next batch made the following changed to make them GREAT: 1 full tea vanilla, a pinch of salt (it's needed b/c of oatmeal and pb combo) and swapped the amts of brown sugar and white sugar.  More brown sugar than white make it more homey to me.  Regardless, both batches were gone quickly.

This is my go-to chocolate chip cookie recipe. It's simply amazing every time! I've substituted Splenda for the sugars, used both chucky & creamy peanut butters, usually use Smart Balance butter and egg beaters to lower the fat. These cookies are always perfect.

Very easy to make and pretty moist when slightly undercooked. I prefer more of a peanut butter taste though, so if I make again, I would definitely increase the p.b.

tasty!  Peanut butter was stronger than I expected, but still good.  They spread pretty big, so be careful.  I might cut back pb a little, but leave rest.

These are some tasty cookies!! I made exactly to the recipe and the only thing I found was that I had to form them into balls and then flatten them a bit as these don't really spread in the oven.  Overall, easy and fast to make and DELICIOUS!!

I do not usually review recipes on here, but this is such an awesome cookie that I couldn't help it. It has the perfect chewyness and tastes amazing too! I doubled the recipe because it is a small batch by itself. Yummo!

Very yummy, but did take longer to cook.  I made a double-batch and used parchment paper (I'm a pretty novice baker and am working on gettting more baking supplies).  It ended up taking about 15 min, with the first 10 minutes being spent on the middle rack, and the last 5 on the top rack to get that golden brown color.  Delicious!

I was a hesitant on trying a chocolate chip/peanut butter/oatmeal combination, but boy are these cookies delicious!  And so easy to make too!  I agree with other reviewers that 10 minutes is a perfect baking time.  Thanks for sharing!

This is a great recipe as written. You wind up with a delicate, crispy cookie. I use my 1oz scoop to portion the cookies out and wind up with 52 cookies! I've made it 2 times. I may try adding Holiday M&Ms or chips for Christmas.

DELICIOUS! The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is that they fall apart so easily- wish they held their shape better/were sturdier (any suggestions??).  Great with white chocolate chips, too.

These cookies are delicious!  They are soft in the middle, crunchy on the edges, with just a hint of peanut butter.  I used a whole bag of chocolate chips, 1 tsp of vanilla, and 1/2 cup of brown sugar, and baked them for exactly 10 minutes.  Wonderful recipe!!

I used this recipe as a guideline only as I wanted my baby girl to enjoy some chocolate cookies but wanted to skip all the empty calories and fat. I used 1/4 cup maragine fat free stuff with omega 3's, 1/2 c Splenda, 1/2c oraganic sucanant, 1 single serving applesauce, 1c whole wheat flour, 1/2 cup rolled oats. These turned out fantastic and I was happy about giving these to my child. You are what you eat and it feels so good to show my daughter that eating good and healthy dosn't mean you have to eat lots of sugar and fat. Thanx for sharing

Perfect! And I love that they are a touch healthy with the addition of the oats. I cooked for 10 minutes- they didn't seem done, but after sitting and cooling for about 10 minutes they were PERFECT!

I made these today to rave reviews and requests for more!  While I have a sweet tooth, cookies have never been my favorite to eat or bake...these cookies changed that.  The flavor is a perfect balance of peanut butter and chocolate (my two faves).

Amazing!! I also flip-flopped the sugar quantities. I took these to a potluck and they disappeared! I used a large dinner spoon to scoop the batter, formed a ball and pressed onto parchment paper. This recipe made about a dozen palm sized cookies, I suggest doubling the recipe. "The Ultimate Cookie!" Do it!

I think this is a fantastic recipe. The peanut butter makes it all the more special for me. The only problem I had was combining all the chocolate chips into the dough. I started out with 2/3 cups and I still couldn't mix it all in very well. But hey, I guess no one can really complain about oozing chocolate, can they?

These came out just delicious just as written!  I baked mine for 12 minutes (at high altitude).  I baked some on a regular cookie sheet and some on a baking stone, both baked up nicely.  On the last batch I flattened the dough slightly because these didn't spread quite as much as I thought they would being made with butter. Yum!

Great cookies.  They were very addictive.  The only change I made was to substitute 1/2 of the all-purpose flour with wheat flour.

My family and friends loved this recipe! I made a few changes that I always make to cookie recipes: I used dark brown sugar, extra real vanilla extract,and becel instead of butter).  I also chose to use m&m's and smarties instead of chocolate chips. My cookies turned out perfect, crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside, they were not crumbly at all. Definetly one of the best cookie recipes ever!!  The only negative is that it is impossible to only eat one!

This recipe was super easy to make and the cookies were delicious.  You can taste the peanut butter right away but it's not overpowering at all.  They are moist, chewy, chocolately and yummy.  Will definately make these again and again.

Not great.  Good flavor but the dough was too crumbly and so were the cookies.  They didn't spread at all, so I flattened the last 2 pans.  Made exactly 36 cookies.

What a great cookie!! 10 min in the oven is perfect. I used dark chocolate baking pieces which to me is perfect so the cookie is not overly sweet. Thank you for this recipe!!

These cookies were so good! I did use 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/3 cup white sugar instead to make the cookies chewier. I baked them for 10 minutes, cooled them on the cookie sheet for 5 minutes like written and they turned out perfectly. Will be making them again for sure!

Had a cakey texture.  I did not care for.  Very soft and chewy, not too much peanut butter flavor.

These were so delicious. My husband said that they were some of the best cookies he has ever had. I like flatter, chewier cookies so I used 1/2 c brown sugar, 1/3 c white sugar, and 1/2 t. of baking soda. They were amazing. I think next time I will try cutting down to 1/3 c of each sugar, they were a little too sweet (and I love sweets!)

These were very good!  My family couldn't seem to get enough of them.  I put about half a cup more chocolate chips than it calls for--both semi-sweet & bittersweet--which turned out very good.  There can never be too much chocolate!

These cookies are phenomenal. I love the texture--chewy on the inside, crisp on the outside, and they don't spread! The peanut butter taste is subtle and the oatmeal just adds a bit of interest. I may try adding more oatmeal next time for a more oatmeal-y chocolate chip cookie, but overall this recipe is a keeper.

Super awesome! I used maple syrup instead of white sugar, whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose flour, added 1/3c. of ground flax seed & 3/4c. of walnuts.  I used all natural PB too.  Kids & husband love them. Will definitely make again!!!

These were great.  Careful not to over cook, they definitely needed to come out of the oven before they look done.  Mine ended up a little crispier then I would have liked.

A good chewy cookie with a slightly crisp exterior. Nice texture with good peanut butter flavor. I swapped the sugars, but that was the only change made to the ingredients. Baked on convection at 320 for 9 min - perfect. Allow cookies to cool for 5 minutes before removing to rack or they will break.

I've never felt compelled to write a review for a recipe, these cookies are SO good I had to share. I chose this recipe because I was looking for a quick and easy cookie recipe and was tired of plain old chocolate chips.  These are perfect.  I will be making these again and again.  Great combination of flavors (not too sweet like most chocolate chip cookies), and the oatmeal adds great texture.  Fantastic!  Oh, and I only switched the brown sugar and white sugar amounts based on reviews, everything I did exactly as the recipe instructed.

I have used this site for recipes for SEVERAL years and this is the first time I was compelled to register and do a review.  These cookies are fabulous!  They are the perfect mix of sweet and salt and just the right amount of crispy.  I love them and will make these over standard choc chip cookies from now on...and that is saying a log!!

These cookies are awesome! I just made them, but used white chocolate chips (because that's what we had on-hand and I couldn't wait to make this!). Everyone loved them. I will make this again!!

This is my favorite cookie recipe! With all of the convenient options of buy and bake cookie dough, I have to REALLY like a cookie recipe to make them from scratch. THESE ARE GREAT!! Totally worth dirtiying some dishes to make:)

hated them right out of the oven... very crumbly and blah, but better the next day... soft and moist.

Absolutely amazing! I took the other reviewer's advice and switched the white and brown sugar quantities. I also added homemade toffee pieces. I baked them for 12 minute and, viola! YUMMMMMMM.

Great recipe!  I used Ghirardelli 60% Cacao chips and chunky peanut butter.  I took them in to work, and they were history before lunch.  Will definitely make these again.

Wow, a cookie recipe that actually works!  These were great.  I didn't even follow the recipe exactly which is good.  I don't like recipes that have to be followed to a "T" (i.e. I estimated the butter and PB).  This was great!

Yum!!  I made a couple small modifications based on what I had in the pantry and suggestions from other viewers.  I was out of oats so I used All Bran cereal instead.  I also switched the amounts for the sugars.  They turned out to be a flavorful, chewy cookie.  I will definitely make them again!

These were fantastic. I gave some to my staff and they loved them. Stirring in the chocolate was a little difficult because there is not too much liquid so it took a little work but they turned out crispy and not chewy. A definite keeper.

PERFECTION in a cookie.  YUM.  The dough is a little drier than I expected but I added 1 tbs. of milk and it turned out beautifully!  They set on top and stay soft inside.  YUMMMMY!

Great combo cookie! these are really good, they can calm any cookie craving and theyre quick & easy to make.  i made them once following the directions exactly and they turned out good, then i made them again and increased the oats and chips a little more to my taste and they still came out great.

These weren't bad. The oatmeal flavour and texture didn't really show through nd the peanut butter tase was pretty mild. If you're looking for a more intense peanut butter and chocolate  cookie, try Flourless Peanut Butter Cookies with 1/3 cup chocolate chips from this site.

DELICIOUS!  I just made these for a house full of hungry vacationers and we love them! I added a pinch or two of cinnamon to the flour and also used a little more oats, a little less chocolate and flattened them like your traditional peanut butter cookie.  Yummmmmm!

I was looking for a cookie recipe w/ oats, peanut butter,chocolate chips, and some kind of nuts, and this recipe hit the spot! I used chunky peanut butter for the nuts, and I highly recommend to do that...the texture and flavors of these cookies are addicting! Just make sure you have a glass of milk nearby to wash them all down with :)

These are so yummy! My husband and I love them. We share with our family and friends every time I bake them, and they are always well-received. There isn't too much oatmeal or peanut butter to bother picky cookie-eaters. :) Definitely a recipe to try!

My daughter and I made these for a Girl Scout Bake Sale and they were a hit.  They are crunchy, yet chewy. As JENNJUSTIN had said I would use a little less than a cup maybe 3/4 next time. I will definitely make these again.

These cookies definitely deliver. Personally, I don't like a very greasy cookie, so I upped the oats to about 1 1/2 cups in total, and threw in some extra chocolate chips.  I also added an additional spoonful of peanut butter.  These are a great alternative to chocolate chip cookies.  Next time, I might add flaked coconut to amp the flavor.

okay, this was the first attempt my 11 year old daughter has made at cookies... this recipe worked marvelously!  She asked for minimal assistance, only to stir actually, and they turned out very good.  She made them exactly as the recipe stated too.

My mom and I actually found this recipe on a bag of flour about 15 or so years ago. Our whole family loves it and has become a traditional Christmas cookie for us. This recipe seems to be exactly the same as mine, thank goodness! The last time I moved I lost my copy. Thanks for submitting Joan!!! I can continue on the tradition for my own family now! I hope everyone enjoys this recipe, I know my husband will be thrilled!

Yum! Kept a great shape, (I hate cookies that flatten out). Followed the recipe exactly except used margarine instead of butter. Still turned out moist and chewy. Definitely a keeper! Thanks Joan :)

I work at a school and use my custodians as guinea pigs.  They absolutely loved these!  I've tried this recipe a few times and there are a couple of tricks to these.  A) Resist the urge to skimp.  Quality is a must.  Real butter (I use a 1/4 butter flavored shortening so the cookies hold thier shape) and a very good name brand peanut butter are a must.  and B) Don't eat these right out of the oven.  They actually taste better the next day when the flavors have had a chance to combine.  Thanks for sharing this recipe

Made as stated except ground the oatmeal which I wouldn't do again.  I missed the chewy texture whole oatmeal brings.  Very delicious!

My husband said these were the best cookies I ever made..........he who usually doesn't say much about my cooking. He took half to work and he said they were gone in a flash. I doubled the recipe and made 2 pans of larger cookies. I followed the recipe as written except had to cut the flour by about 1/4 of a cup because I ran out. Looked like a perfect cookie. Had to cook several minutes longer....probably because they were bigger. Took them out while they still looked a bit soft and they were perfect. I could just barely taste the peanut butter though.

GREAT COOKIE! I've tried lots of peanut butter/chocolate combination, but this one is by far the best, most balanced cookie I've ever eaten. No modifications necessary.

These are soooo good!!! It's great to find a recipe that doesn't need any altering too - absolutely perfect! Though I did roll into balls and flatten slightly before baking. I had to make a second batch the next day since they were so popular with everyone. Thanks Joan

these cookies were very good...not the best i've ever had, but very good. easy to make, batter scooped easily...cooked for 12 minutes...i did think they were a little too buttery with the mix of one stick of butter and 1/2 c peanut butter. Next time i think i'll add a 1/4 c butter and add some nuts..good basic cookie recipe

YUM!!!  Will definitely be making over & over again!  I made these to take to a Mother's Day gathering...everyone was asking for the recipe.  I used crunchy peanut butter rather than creamy.  I would also double the recipe next time b/c as written it didn't make very many.

These are great as is, but I made them again and changed it up a little and I honestly think it is the best cookie I have ever had... seriously: I followed the recipe, but I added a tsp of cinnamon and I left out the chocolate chips.  Instead I added toffee chips and then I wrapped each tablespoon of dough around a rolo and baked for 12 minutes.  Soooo good.

These are the best drop cookies I have ever made, and I have made a lot of cookies!  I followed the recipe exactly and they are perfect.  Even the amount of peanut butter is good. Be sure to use rolled oats and not the quick oats.  They give the cookies a chewy quality.  Of course they are healthy too with the oats and monounsaturated fats in the peanut butter and chocolate chips:))!!

I love these cookies. I actually have had friends get into an argument over who ate the last one! I sometimes add 1/2 cup of heath bar bits and peanut butter chips in with the choclate chips, when I add all the extras I cut the surgar back a bit as it can be a bit sweet. thank you very much for this recipe!

I changed not one thing about this recipe - I used the exact ingredients and incorporated them exactly as the directions stated. It created a loose dough that I scooped by the tablespoon onto an ungreased cookie sheet and then slightly flattened with my fingers. After 10 mins in the oven, I pulled them out and let them cool on the cookie sheet as they appeared crumbly. I was worried, so after the cooled i transfered them to a cookie sheet to finish cooking completely. They were delicious!!!! I threw a couple in the refrigerator for a  few hours and, believe it or not, they were even more DELICIOUS! This recipe is a keeper.

Best cookies I've had! Second time making them I messed up and added 1/2 cup of brown sugar by mistake and used almondbutter. They were soo good. Almond butter is a tad pricey so might not use it again but adding more brown sugar is recommended by my taste (also makes it easily to remember)

This is by far my favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe. Make sure you cream the butter and sugars really well. And they only need to be baked for 10 minutes. Cookies continue to bake on the cookie sheet after you take them out of the oven. Leave them on the cookie sheet for the 5 minutes that the recipe calls for. FYI: I usually use butter when I bake but I tried "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter for baking" and they turned out very nicely. Less saturated fat this way. Thanks for the awesome recipe!

This makes an awesome peanut butter/chocolate chip cookie! I added a little French Vanilla Instant Pudding mix and some walnuts since we love nuts. I switched the amounts of brown and white sugar as recommended by another user. I will definitely be making these again!

These cookies are really good. They did not have a strong peanut butter taste IMO. Just a hint. And the oatmeal was good, but I could have gone without it. All it did, for me, was mess up the texture of a potentially soft, moist and chewy cookie. My husband loved them!

These cookies remind me of Peanut Butter Surprise cookies from Blue Chip Cookie Company or Great American Company.  I used a cookie scooper from Pampered Chef for baking based on previous reviews.  The cookies turned out fantastic!  I ran out of semi-sweet chocolate chips, so I added white chips to compensate the difference.  We love peanut butter and thought it didn't have enough of a peanut butter flavor, but they were devoured none-the-less.  They were extremely easy and very good!

These are nice thick cookies.  They have a very strong peanut butter taste which surprised me.  I like the oatmeal in it for fiber, but other than that I'm not sure what it brings to the cookie.  The best part about this cookie was that it only used a small amount of each ingredient.  1 egg is always nice.

These cookies are truly outrageous - I could tell that a friend agreed when she exclaimed "these are the best cookies I've EVER eaten" with her mouth full :)  I typically bake cookies at 375 F and have very good luck achieving a chewy texture, these took about 12 minutes in the oven and then cooled for 2 on the cookie sheet.

I loved these.  Very buttery, nice peanut butter flavor but the texture of an oatmeal coookie.  I used milk chocolate and peanut butter swirl chips, which were really good.  I used a cookie scoop and got about 28 cookies, which were perfect baked for 11 minutes.

I was in the mood for cookies and these seemed easy. They were very quick to prepare, and tasted pretty good. I enjoyed the combination of flavors. I made them smaller(teaspoonsfuls) and baked for 9-10 minutes. Very good recipe.

Really good recipe.  The cookies are yummy and moist.  We substituted the sugar for a sugar/splenda mixture that used 50% less, 1/4 Cup of this mixture and cut the sugar calories in over half with it.  They still came out wonderful, we got 23 cookies from our batch and cooked perfect in 11 minutes.  Like others we rolled the cookies and flattened them.  So, good!

This was a very good cookie recipe. Not the best ever, but very good. I think the peanut butter kind of takes away from the chocolate chip cookie taste, but maybe it's just me. I like peanut butter cookies and I like chocolate chip cookies but the combination didn't dazzle me. For timing, definitely err on the side of cooking for less time. If you wait until the cookie edges are actually browning like it says in the recipe, they're overdone and not nice and chewy. I think 9 or 10 minutes would've been perfect (I did 11 and it was a little too long).

This is an excellent recipe for pb chocolate chip oatmeal cookies!!  The first thing my husband said was, "Wow!"  They are soft and chewy and have good flavor!  He didn't pick up on the peanut butter flavor, but I did!  He was pretty hungry and he's a man... so he got the chocolate chip part of it!!  Anyway, they are so fast and easy to prepare too... usually making cookies takes forever for me b/c you need the same measurement for most of the ingredients... this one was perfect... I got it all mixed up in about 15 minutes tops!  The cookies were all done in about 45 minutes!  I will be using this recipe again for sure!  Thank you so much for sharing!

made these yesterday and was super thrilled with the results.  Finally, a chocolate chip recipe that bakes up instead of staying flat!  This will be my regular cookie recipe.

Another perfect cookie recipe on Allrecipes.  If anyone does not like this recipe, they shouldn't be in the kitchen.  You could easily sneak oatmeal into a diet of someone who doesn't like it and they would never know. It's a cookie with subtle peanut butter flavor and the chocolate chips rock!

Great cookie, love the look and texture. I'm not much for oatmeal cookies so having a oatmeal peanut butter, chocolate chip combo is what interested me.  Nice change from the ordinary cookie but I do like mine a little chewy, so it gets 4 1/2 stars from me.

I have now made these cookies twice; once for a cookie swap at church and on Christmas Eve for Santa and both times they are a huge hit. The oatmeal offers a great texture.  I only changes made was with the portion and the butter.  I used 1/2 TBLS instead of TBLS.  Still cooked them for the same amount of time and they came out perfect.  I also substituded Crisco butter flavored instead of butter and they came out tall and fluffy.  Please try these cookies...they really are OUTRAGEOUS!!!

These were good, but the combination of the peanut butter with the oatmeal was a little foreign to me. With the small amount of peanut butter, it was like the cookie wasn't "committing" to the peanut butter taste. If I made these again, I think i'd add more peanut butter, and maybe more chocolate chips too- those kind of helped pull everything together. Not bad though- my family is eating them quickly! :)

These cookies are the best!  The peanut butter gives a nice surprise flavor and helps keep them soft.  Chilling the dough for about 20 minutes beforehand and baking for the full 12 minutes produces the perfect cookie!  This will be a regular in our house - thanks!!

Accurately called 'outrageous': delicious recipe, but very rich. I made them with milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet: a mistake. Much too sweet. I also took them out of the oven a couple minutes too early - they were slightly soft in the middle, and although they firmed up when cool, they were still a little underdone. Timing needs to be carefully watched. Nonetheless, roommate still ate them all!

These are amazing.  The recipe is also very versatile - add walnuts, peanuts, coconut, bananas, etc.  It is all terrific.  And best yet,  only one stick of butter!

This recipe was awesome! I made these for 4 of us and the entire batch was gone in a little over 12 hours.  My family kept saying that they were the best cookies any of them had ever had.  I did add a bit more peanut butter and the peanut butter actually tasted stronger once the cookies cooled.  Wonderful!

I have made these cookies over and over. It is a simple recipe with ingredients I ususally have on hand. It is the only choco-chip cookie I make now. Definately a keeper!

These cookies were SO easy to make and delicious to eat! I did make a couple changes though. I replaced the semi-sweet chocolate chips with pure milk chocolate chips. Also I did not put any rolled oats in them. My roommates ate them up in less then a day!

THESE WERE AMAZING!!!
Seriously this is my new favorite cookie recipe, it adds all my fave cookies into one: peanut butter, chocolate chip, and oatmeal! I added 1/3 each of semi-sweet chips, dark chocolate chips, and white chocolate chips (I actually added a little extra dark chocolate chips) 
I baked them about 11 minutes and they were done perfectly. YUM!

I absolutely loved the dough and the cookies turned out cookie-licious :)  I like my cookies a little soft so i pulled them out a couple minutes early, let them cool completely, stored them...and they stayed moist up until the last cookie was eaten!

Due to the positive reviews, I doubled the batch to put in my kids' lunch boxes and share with my daycare kids.  No one has been disappointed!  These are awesome cookies!  I used quick oats and milk chocolate chips, as that was all I had in the house.  Still turned out great.  I used the medium cookie scoop from Pampered Chef and got 4 dozen cookies out of the double batch.  This recipe is defintely a keeper!

Very, very good...no changes made other than I doubled the recipe because I wanted a bunch of cookies to keep in the freezer for lunches!  The oatmeal really gives them a great texture, and almost crunch.  Probably would be even better with crunchy peanut butter used next time!  Thanks for a great recipe!  This is a keeper!  :)

This recipe is really tasty. I added about 1/4 c. extra (natural)pb, 1/2 c. extra oats and a cup of raisins. I switched the amounts of brown and white sugar as several other reviews suggested. I baked them for 6 min and they came out really moist and tasty. Next time I would up the oats even more as they were a little greasy and cut the sugar a bit because they were a little sweet for my taste. Definitely a keeper :-)

Excellent cookies! I wish I had doubled the batch as they only make a few. As another reviewer suggested I used a half cup of brown sugar instead of the white. I only used 1/4 cup of white. Instead of butter I used butter flavored Crisco and they turned out fantastic. They were moist and did not flatten out. Will definitely make again!

These were OK, but not fantabulous. They were a little dry and crumbly. I brought them to a playgroup event and while the other moms seemed to enjoy them, there was something a bit off about them.

I followed the recipe exactly as stated.

YUM!  Soft and chewy...a really great cookie.  I used a med. size scoop and the recipe yield was 24...which means less calories per cookie! :)  I realized half way thru mixing that I only had peanut butter chips so I used them and all whole wheat flour so...they're healthy to boot!  Will definately make these again.

Good cookie.  Following other reviews, I swapped the brown sugar and white sugar amounts.  It made a moist cookie with great texture.

Wonderful recipe!  These cookies flew out of my kitchen with three sons and their friends!  Great texture, great flavor and you can add any chips you want to change up/enhance the flavor. I will be making these often!

I used home made peanut butter and 1 tsp vanilla. EXCELLENT cookies! Do not over mix once you add the dry ingredients! Just stir enough to incorporate. That'll help the cookies not to spread and/or fall.

They taste Fan-Frigin-Tastic! They are officially added to my cookie rotation. I doubled recipe and whipped the PB into sugar/butter. I also added an additional 1/2 c of oats. I always refrigerate my cookie dough overnight so that they form balls better. My cookies flattend out fine on their own and. I hope they keep well. Thanks again for a great recipe.

Cooked as per recipe but halved quantity and worked beautifully. Husband loved them. Make sure to press them into the shape and thickness you desire as they do not spread during cooking.

These were just alright, not good enough to make them again though.  I used quick-cooking oats but you couldn't even tell there were any in there.  They did stay soft but were dry.

I pretty much followed this recipe to the "T" and baked for 11 min. I actually like my cookies semi-flat and not chunky, so I added a tbsp of water and they came out looking just as amazing as they tasted!. My sister came home and kept asking me if I really made them, of if I used pre-made dough. They also stay so nice and soft for quite a few days, if they aren't all eaten by then!

These cookies have good flavor and when undercooked, are yummy on the inside and a bit crunch on the outside. I took another reviewer's advice and tried to form them and fork them down a bit before cooking, but that made the bottoms BURN. So I got like 10 cookies out of the recipe. Just dropping them works fine. They are a little too sweet for my liking, I think, so I may decrease the sugar or chocolate next time.

The cookies had good flavor but they were VERY greasy! I am not sure how they would turn out if I cut the butter amount in half. My husband loves anything Peanut Butter & Chocolate and he wasn't too thrilled, just said they were "Okay".

I love this cookie!  It bakes up reallly well, although they get crunchy rather quickly.  I often make a few dozen and freeze the leftover dough that I don't want to use then in balls to use at a later time.  It works great! Easy to make and my family loves them.

It's hard to mess this up - I even eyeball the PB and it turns out delicious each time. I sprinkle extra chocolate chips on top of any bald spots.

I am a good cook, but couldn't make chocolate chip cookie. I can't even make edible chocolate chip cookies with the recipe on the package. Well, no longer. I followed the recipe exactly and baked for 10 minutes. These didn't go flat and weren't bland. They were chewy with many different tastes and textures to enjoy. I like the combination of my three favorite cookies-peanut butter, oatmeal and chocolate chip. This will be my go-to recipe.

These were a DELIGHT! The balance of flavours are excellent. I added 1/4 cup of whole wheat flour to make it "healthier" and used milk chocolate chips. This ended up making about 36 cookies! 

I definitely crecommend it!

These really are outrageously good cookies. I've made them with whole grain spelt, and also with a barley flour/spelt combination to add some whole grains and they are decadent!! Chocalate-peanut flavour combination is amazing. Thanks for the great recipe.

I was surprised by the strength of the peanut butter in this cookie but it was still enjoyable, and the texture was great. Maybe next time i'll cut down on the pb and white sugar and up the brown sugar to make a more subtle cookie since i don't like mine too sweet. I used skippy which is pretty sweet so maybe a homestyle pb might be what i'm looking for.

good recipe but I doubled the salt and it tasted fine. I still might adjust the sugar as it still lacked some 'pizazz' for me.  The consistency was excellent and cookies held their shape during baking.

These cookies were really good despite how I ended up having to substitute many ingredients.  I ran out of brown sugar (did sugar/molasses combo), white flour (ended up having to use 1 1/2 cup whole wheat flour), butter (had to use 1/2 soy margarine), and was a bit short on the peanut butter.  I thought the combo of flavors and textures was great.  My only issue was that the cookies fell pretty flat.  I ended up refrigerating subsequent batches for a few minutes and that helped quite a bit.  Next time I may substitute shortening for some of the butter so that the cookies hold their shape.

It's a peanut butter cookie with chocolate chips, and some "crunch" from oatmeal. If you like that, you'll like this. I cooked 9 minutes and they are a good consistency. I would never call them chocolate chip cookies.

Wow!  What a great recipe!  Just finished making them, I used the tip a previous post had mentioned to roll dough into tbsp balls and flatten with a fork before baking and it worked beautifully!  I also used half bkg soda and half bkg powder because I like my cookies a little puffy...but they were still chewy in the middle!  Yummy recipe, I'll definately make this one again. =D

I doubled the given recipe amounts except for the butter.  Came out really good.  Little crunchy, but not overly so and not too moist/cakey either.

WOW! These are the best Chocolate Chip Cookies I have ever made!  I doubled the recipe bc I took 1/2 to work and kept 1/2 at home for me and the Hubby.  Hubby ate 5 last night, and these were the first cookies to go today at work!  
I did add in an extra 1/4 cup of oats to be sure that the cookies held together and didn't spread.  I also balled them up like one reviewer suggested, and these came out perfect.  Still slightly raised, and great chewy consistancy.  These are not my favorite cookie to make!

These were okay. The first batch I made were true to the recipe. The cookie did not spread out at all while being baked and the texture in your mouth was very dry. I added a tablespoon of vegetable oil to the rest of the dough, Rolled them in my hand and patted them down to the cookie size I wanted. This was a little better but not by much. Not a great cookie.

Excellent cookies. I followed the recipe just the way it's written and took the advice of the many reviewers to make sure that I didn't over bake the cookies. They didn't come out dry at all. If anything I found them a bit too sweet for my liking and I'd put in fewer chocolate chips next time. Thanks for a great recipe.

I made these twice.  My husband LOVES PB and choc chip cookies and he is really fussy.  I did the first batch exactly as directed, but he doesn`t like rolled oats.  I thought they were perfect already.  The second time around I added a bit more PB and I tricked him by grinding the oatmeal in the blender.  He thought they were great!!

These are the best chocolate chip cookies I have ever had! I never cared that much for the dough in the traditional chocolate chip  cookies. This is perfect with the peanut butter and oats. Very nice texture and flavor. I also like that it is a small recipe since I live alone. It would be easy to double the recipe if needed. This recipe is a keeper and any time I want chocolate chip cookies I will be using this one. Thank you so much for posting it.

I was looking for a recipe that had peanut better and chocolate. This fit the bill! The batter was nice and fluffy. I baked them on parchment paper. They did not spread too much and looked very nice after baking. Very good rich taste and great consistent texture. It will go in my file~ GREAT RECIPE~~

My husband said it best: "These are amazing!"  A really good recipe!  And the finished cookies look perfect, too.  Mine came out a bit dry, but I can adjust for that.  Also, the recipe made 2 dozen (not 3 dozen) cookies for me.  Thank you for posting this! :)

Great recipe. I modified it by adding a package of french vanilla instant pudding, 1/2 cup cocoa powder in place of 1/2 a cup of flour, about 1 tbsp of light corn syrup, and slightly more brown sugar and sugar to offset the cocoa powder's bitterness. Sooo good!

These cookies are very flavorful and delicious. However, the peanut butter dominates the taste so in my recipe collection I have these noted as "PEANUT BUTTER COOKIES". But, like I said these are absolutely delicious and I dare anyone to eat just one. I will definitely check out more recipes submitted by this contributor.

These are very nice cookies with a lovely peanut taste, but not the best I've had. I'm known amongst my friends for having the best choc-chip cookies, but they were a little disappointed with these. One commented they tasted "a bit healthy!" which is never a good thing when you're talking cookies!  I think it was the oatmeal that did that. 

I rolled teaspoons into balls and the spread nicely into thick soft cookies.

A great alternative to regular chocolate chip cookies.  We really enjoyed them and especially love that they do not spread out like some cookies do.  I am more of a cookie lover of the crisp outside but soft/chewy inside but still enjoyed the cookie and would definitely make again.  After sitting the cookie gets a little crispy but I would imagine if you threw in a slice of bread in a sealed container with the cookies that it'd help with that issue.  We only have a few left lol so I am not concerned.  I am just thankful for the great recipe.

I thought this recipe was really good. I made a little change because I relized that i didn't have brown suger but i really wanted to make these cookies so I used 1/3 cup of splenda in place of the 1/3 cup brown suger and the cookies still came out tasting great!

I have to make cookies for my daughter's daycare party.  I've tried about 3 or 4 different recipes from this website.  This is the FIRST recipe that produced desirable results.  These are delicious and I know the children will love them.  This recipe is a keeper.  The cookies came out a little crisp on the outside and soft on the inside...with a light, creamy taste.  Thanks! :)

Use two eggs, not one. The batter stays together A LOT better.

Also, extend the cooking time if you like fat cookies. Try about 15minutes.

This is my new go-to cookie recipe!  I've been looking for a great recipe that's easy and yummy, and I FOUND IT!  I doubled the recipe and made it a day ahead, chilled it overnight and baked them the next morning without bringing the batter to room temp.  PERFECT!  YUMMY!  This recipe has it all!

Wonderful recipe. I doubled the recipe with no problem. Creamed the butter and sugars with a hand mixer, then added dry ingredients. The dough was even yummy! Mine took longer to bake, I like to use a scoop and they were pretty thick. Yummy, crisp edges and chewy, fluffy inside. I found them better after they had cooled, though.

These are yummy cookies.  I added butterscotch chips with the chocolate chips and it made a great cookie even better.  Also, if you refridgerate the dough before cooking the cookie will stay puffy instead of flatten out.  Thanks for the recipe!

Actually, the raw cookie dough was the most delicious part of these cookies.  They were still very good cooked, but a little to buttery for my personal liking.

YUM! These were great cookies. I did as others suggested and switched the measurements of sugars. The recipe calls for the perfect amount of oatmeal, so as to not overwhelm the cookies and make them heavy. I've made them twice already, and they were a big hit.

These are hands down the BEST cookies I have ever made!! Thanks for the recipe. I had to make three batches in one week because I couldnt keep my family out of them. I caught them in the "cookie jar" in the middle of the night, at breakfast, when I come in from outside, basically anytime they thought I couldnt see!!! Now thats a GOOD cookie! I sent them to school, and the teachers raved. Some of the 2nd graders wouldnt touch them though. I bet the staff didnt care since they got the leftovers. I also made these as gifts last Christmas, substituting the chocolate chips with Caramel chips, Peanut Butter chips and Mint chips. Thanks for the absolutely fabulous recipe!

I Love chocolate chip cookies and was reluctant to put oatmeal into these but these were outrageously delicious! I like moist chewy cookies so I followed the suggestions of others and switched the amount of sugars (used 1/2 brown, 1/3 white) and the cookies came out soft and perfect. I made it twice - once with smooth peanut butter and once with chunky. Either way, these cookies are great. I shared them with co-workers and they were a huge hit. My only suggestion is the same as many others - double the batch!

WOW!  I'm not much of a baker, but I had a craving for something sweet and these really hit the spot.  I only had 1/2 cup of chocolate chips so I also added 1/2 cup of raisins.  These cookies are fantastic and so easy to make.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

Great, versatile recipe.  I added a handful raisins and some 3/4 c chopped nuts to my double batch.  Should have made a triple batch, they went so fast.  Only change I would make to the recipe is to cut the sugar by a 1/4, which I do with most of my baking anyway.

I just started really baking and these cookies were so easy! I make them for all occasions and so far EVERYONE has loved them! I am not a big fan or peanut butter, but with all of the ingredients combined nothing is really over-powering. I just love making them!
i like adding a bit more oatmeal...but that is just me:)

Wow! I've been making this exact recipe for years and just discovered it on here (which is great, because I lost my recipe card after I had this recipe memorized for some time)! My mom got it off a Gold Medal Flour package, I think. These cookies are one of my all-time favorites, and I used to have friends come specifically to events I was hosting when they knew I was baking these cookies. They always got great reviews!

An all around good cookie--from the ingredients you can see why there couldn't be anything bad about it.

Recipe was excellent.  Previous reviewer indicated that the result was too salty...not my take on this here.  I used other reviewer's tips (switch sugar - 1/3 cup and brown sugar  - 1/2 cup) for more moistness.  Very happy with results!

These had a really good flavor, but I thought they were a little dry and crumbly.  It was probably because I used crunchy peanut butter instead of creamy, but I'm not sure...next time I will try creamy and see what happens.

This recipe was outrageous! I just made it last night to take to my boyfriend's dad's 50th birthday party. Lately I've been having problems with my cookies and I don't know what I'm doing wrong. The first batch I made last night I simply followed the directions on the back of the Nestle Tollhouse choco. chip bag. I know I've made them before and they've turned out great, but lately all my cookies come out flat as pancakes! Then I tried this recipe (after throwing out my cookie pancakes!) and it turned out great! I just ate one this morning and it was still super soft and chewy. The only thing I changed in the recipe was adding chunky peanut butter instead of regular, and I'm glad I did. YUMMY! I'm sure they'll be a hit. I will definitely make these again.

I gave it 5 b/c they were v. tastey and crunchy - we LOVED it!  We are cookie hounds and this was a great tasting recipe. I would only add 1, maybe 1 1/2 c of rice krispies.  I also added only 1 c of flour and 1/2 c of wheat flour. Maybe that is why I didn't have a problem with the dough. It was dry but if you con't to work the dough longer everything will mix in.  Highly recommend if you like crunchy cookies!

These cookies are great!  They are more dense than an average chocolate chip cookie and both the paenut butter and chocolate tastes are mild - nothing is overpowering.  I made these cookies last night for three of us to enjoy and they are almost all gone today!

I mixed everything up as directly written. The dough seemed too runny(maybe because of my altitude)so I added 1/3 cup flour. Then the dough tasted too much like peaunut butter and not sweet enough, so I added 2 tbs butter and 2 tbs sugar and an extra cup of chocolate chips. After all these changes, I baked the cookies, and they were beautiful. But the actual recipe, didnt work for me ):

These cookies are excellent!! I was very surprised that they tasted so good since it is such a simple recipe. I used half the amount of butter and substituted shortening for the other half to make them keep more of their shape. I also cooked them on parchement paper instead of having to spray the pans.

I followed recipe as stated and they turned out good.  Others in the house thought they were great and said the recipe was a keeper.  I just thought they were good but they seemed to need something for me.  I thought I liked oatmeal chocolate chip cookies better without the peanut butter.  Since some int he house thought they were great I might make again for them.  Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe is perfect. I followed it exactly, and baked the cookies for 12 minutes because I made mine a little big, and they are so much better than I had anticipated. I will be recommending this one to my family for sure.

Hands down the best cookies I've ever made!  My husband thought they were much better than regular chocolate chip cookies, however my 8 year old niece wasn't "crazy about the oatmeal". Can't please everybody, but we thought they were wonderful!

These cookies were delicious!!! As I had my second batch in the oven I realized that I forgot to put in the rolled oats.. So I added some to the remaining cookie dough, along with a tinny bit more peanut butter....... Both ways turned out soft and yummy, .....This is a very safe recipe for work, church, family get together, ext...

Not sure why some people had 'dry, crumbly batter'.  I didn't find it dry at all...perhaps you only used a small egg? Try using a extra large egg.  It works wonders! Also DON"T OVER MIX!!

These were REALLY good...not heaven sent, but very good. I loved the different flavors...never thought of putting a bit of each into it. Definitely a twist on the ones I normally make,and I will make these again. Thanks so much!

These cookies are great! I brought them to work and everyone loves them!  They are a bit crumbly, but I like them like that. Be careful to let them cool, I tried taking them off the stone too quickly and they were falling apart.

Made them 2 days in a row, we really like them.  I agree, make sure that you keep them in a ball, b/c they melt and spread out.  

I discovered something today when I ran low on butter.  I only had 7 tbs, instead of the 8tbs needed, so I used the butter that I had and substituted 3 tbs of ground flax seed for the 1 missing tbs of butter - and you can't tell the difference.  Nice!

Perfect! Easy and delicious. I did have to bake them a lot longer than suggested (17 minutes?), but I think my oven's temperature is a little off.

This cookie was good. Switched the sugars amounts and would decrease the peanut butter to prolly 1/4 cup next time. Came out plump, not flat and tasted wonderful.

I made these cookies along with several others for Christmas, but these were our favorites!  My hubby loves peanut butter cookies and is always asking me to make them, but liked these more subtle flavored ones just as much and couldn't keep his hands out of the cookie jar. I followed the recipe exactly, though I mixed my wet and dry ingredients separately first, before mixing them together. Yummy!

This cookie was great!  Very filling cookie - almost like an oatmeal raisin cookie, but with chocolate chips instead.   And so easy to make! - that was the best part.   I used Natural PB, wasn't sure that was such a good idea.  Next time I'll add a bit less PB.  Great cookie!  Thanks.

These were awesome.  I flipped the amount of brown vs. white sugar since I like more brown.  I used old fashioned oats and added some of our favorite granola cereal for a little sweet crunchiness - oh man!  I also did not use peanut butter since it wasn't my preference.  These cookies were delicious.  One of those batters that you could eat half of before it hits the cookie sheet.  Yum.  Big hit at my house.

tasy, more peanut buttery tasting than I wanted, but good....the batter was really dry and crumbly so I thought I did somthing worng, but it formed "balls" well and the cookies turned out fine. I used my hand mixer initally to work the peanut butter and butter, egg, and vanailla into the dry ingredients and then mixed the choc chips in by hand.

Got Milk??????????  This cookies are rich, but not excessively so.  One cookie will satisfy your sweet tooth.  Perfect consistancy, and no flavor outdid the other as often happens when mixing peanut butter and chocolate.  I think next time I will try with dark chocolate chips for an even more decadent cookie.  thanks for sharing!!!

I've never been a fan of the traditional Toll House chocolate chip cookie recipe, but I really do like these. The addition of the oats gives a nice chewy texture and the peanut butter adds a lot of flavor. This will be my new staple chocolate chip cookie recipe. Next I will try substituting Nutella for the peanut butter for some variety.

These cookies tasted good, but the dough was a little too dry for me, which make the cookies a little too crumbly. But, over all, they did taste good. If I made these again, I would add a little butter or something.

Great taste and texture-- wonderfully chewy!  I don't get what's so "outrageous" about them, though; the ingredients seem pretty traditional!  They're yummy, nonetheless.  Thanks for the great recipe!

yum!!!  these are great.  i would suggest rolling the dough into balls if u want a prettier cookie.  I did for the first 2, and then said forget it and just scooped, so i have two pretty and the rest lumpy, but I don't care!  They still taste great!!!!!

Nothing fabulous about them at all...the recipe calls for too much rolled oats which just makes it taste like an oatmeal cookies; which I don't like.

I was really impressed with the way these cookies held their shape. They were also delicious warm but the next day I felt they were a bit dry. I baked them for 10 mins but maybe that was too long in my oven. Thanks.

I did not like this cookie very much.  It was like it couldn't make up its mind whether to be a chocolate chip, oatmeal or peanut butter cookie.  My husband, however, LOVED this cookie and he is tough to please when it comes to sweets.  I had to give it five stars for his sake.  I guess it is a matter of personal taste.

A great alternative to the same old chocolate chip recipe. I did roll the cookies into balls and that really helped the cookies stay perfect shape. The mix of semisweet & milk chocolate chips was great too! I added more than a cup of chocolate chips and am glad I did. I prefer my cookies to have lots of chips!

I was really worried about the peanut butter in this recipe, but it turned out wonderful!  This is so easy to make, and delicious!!  Leave them on the cookie sheet for about five minutes really helps them hold their shape.

Nice texture!  Really light for an oatmeal cookie. You can also use less (or no) chocolate chips, and push a Hershey's kiss on top right after they come out of the oven.

These are pretty good, but not worthy of 5 stars.  I did not add salt, used unsalted butter, and used chunky peanut butter.  I would have liked more peanut butter flavor and may use peanut butter chips next time.  Great airy/fluffy texture.

BEST RECIPE I HAVE FOUND IN A LONG TIME!!! 
I did add a lot more chocolate chips of course!  I had to bring them to a friend's house to get them out of my house!  They were toooo delicious.

Flippin' fantastic. My go-to chocolate chip. I almost always change recipes, but I didn't change a lick in this. Although I do recommend chilling the dough. Anywhere from 2 hours to 2 days. But it's important.

I had a cookie recipe much like this one but thought I'd lost it till I came here and found this one!  These cookies are perfectly buttery, salty and sweet, with just a tiny bit of crunch from the oats.  My favorite alteration is using Hershey's special Dark chocolate chips.  Mmmm!  These never last long..

These were outstanding! The batter was a little sticky though, and I had to keep on rewetting my hands. They came out AMAZING and I made them for my cousins (a family of 10!) and their guests and they just couldn't stop gobbling them up!

Had to cook this about 18 minutes longer to make it a little more crunchier.  It was a good cookie but I think it probably would be better without the peanut butter.

I made the cookies just as described and they came out great.  My kids and my husband loved them.  I had to bake them longer than 12 minutes or else they were a little doughy in the middle.  Still good but not quite finished.  I baked mine for 18 minutes.  These are very rich cookies and that's how we like them at our house.

These were really good! I didn't have the chocolate chips, so I went ahead without them. They were a hit!! ( I did cut down on the sugar a bit, and they were just perfect.)

OK, I'm not sure what I did wrong, but I don't think the cookies turned out as wonderful as all the other reviews said; however, I did bring them to work and everyone loved them and couldn't eat just one. I would say this is just an 'ok' recipe.

This is an excellent recipe and the cookies are DELICIOUS! I would recommend doubling the recipe and the only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the cookies are a little dry (I fillowed the recipe exactly) but they taste great!

Great change from the traditional chocolate chip cookie.  The balance of peanut butter and oatmeal is perfect.  Does not make a huge batch, so double the recipe if needed.

This recipie was awesome!! I tried this recipie instead of the other 200 chocolate chip cookie ones because it required less butter and sugar.   My children, who are extremely picky eaters, could not get enough!  This is the best cookie recipie I have ever used from here.

Yumm - great! Not too peanut buttery, I like a little more chocolate chips (used mixture of dark and semi sweet chips). Thanks for the suggestion to let sit for a few minutes before removing from tray. Make a double batch, they go quick!

A tasty change from a regular chocolate chip cookie.  Plenty greasy - I may cut down the butter next time.  Was a crumbly dough but baked up very nice.

I just made these cookies today and my husband loved them (me too:)). We both love peanut butter cookies, but find that they are usually too dry. These were just perfect because they are nice and chewy. They are a chocolate chip cookie but they have a nice peanut butter flavor.

These were the absolute best chocolate chip cookies that I have ever had! They were so chewy and moist. The oatmeal adds a great consistency to the cookies. I doubled the recipe because I thougt it wouldn't make much, but I made two dozen large cookies. The only recipe that I will use from now on!

These are wonderful!! I would suggest doubling the recipe if you want larger cookies. But other than that they are fabulous!! They certainly have a little of everything and they certainly satisfied my family!! I don't have any left!! Plus I have to go back to the store for more milk!! Thanks for the recipe Joan!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  The PB/chocolate mix is one of my favorites, add the oatmeal....now that's a cookie!

Wow, what a great cookie. The peanut butter flavor was perfect. The texture was a little on the crumbly side, but I liked it...it was a good change of pace and strangely not dry at all. This recipe is definitely a keeper. Thanks!

This recipe is INCREDIBLE!!!  I made a batch of these cookies for a party at my parents' house. They were gone so fast I couldn't believe it!  I followed the recipe exactly.  I used natural peanut butter.  DELICIOUS!!!

The BEST chocolate cookie.  I made this for a cookie exchange and it was a huge hit.  My family loved them so much, I had to make another huge batch just to get us through Christmas Day!

Very nice cookie, not too sugary or too buttery (like some chocolate chip cookies can be) because of the oatmeal in it. Makes a perfect snack cookie to share with others.

The first batch I made had a good flavor but were too dry on the outside; I increased the size of the cookies slightly and reduced the cooking time - second batch came out much softer and with a good flavor; we'd make these again. Let them cool on the cookie sheet before you move them; mine tore as I moved them.

Very easy recipe.  I used half butterscotch and half semi-sweet chocolate chips.  I also used unsweetened, all natural peanut butter because I was afraid they would be too sweet...good choice.  Lastly, 8 minutes is all they took to cook.  Any longer, and they were too crispy for my liking, especially on the bottom.

This is one of the best Chocolate Chip Cookie Recipies I have made. My Husband really enjoyed the fact there is Peanut Butter in them.  I found the cookies were moist and chewy (the way I like).  I recomend cooling on cookie sheet 2-5 min, and removing them from sheet one at a time. I found they crumbled easy when they were warm.  I also sealed them in a plastic zipper bag after cooled to keep cookie's texture.  Thanks Joan for my new favorite Chocolate chip cookie recipe!!

I loved this cookie!!  It came out very soft and tasted great.  I was a bit skeptical about the oats and peanut butter but it added to make a great and unique tasting cookie.

These cookies are absolutely delicious. I first made them for a church function.  They were so good, I'm sending them to my friend who's been stationed in Iraq. This would be the perfect gift if you have any loved ones overseas.

These cookies are so good and so easy to make. I love that they don't call for shortening.  I made 2 batches for refreshments at back to school night, and my students were so impressed! I was disappointed in one student's selfishness in eating 5! (but I guess that shows you how yummy they are!) The lesson is: make at least twice the amount called for!

These are good, but not as great as I expected.  This may be in part because I did not have any brown sugar and substituted honey.  I also used natural chunky peanut butter, and substituted the white flour with whole wheat flour.  I will be making these again, although next time I will used brown sugar, keep the whole wheat flour, increase the peanut butter, and add more chocolate chips (or maybe smarties).  Overall yummy!

I was testing these out to see if they'd be good to make for a group of kids I teach creative writing to, and the answer is decidedly YES.  Very yummy!  Like others, my cookie mix made less cookies than the recipe states - I had 16 cookies of about a 10cm diameter - so double the recipe if you need the full 3 dozen.  I personally am not a big chocolate person, so I like that these mix choc chips AND peanut butter AND oats (and I threw in a few raisins for good measure) so they keep everyone happy!

Wow, what a great chocolate chip cookie!  The peanut butter adds a great flavor, but doesn't overpower the cookie.  They are crisp on the outside, but still soft on the inside.  I may add some chopped walnuts to the next batch!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Really good recipe if you have a sweet tooth.  I used reduced fat peanut butter and still tasted fab.  Instead of chocolate chip's i broke up chocolate melts to get a bigger bite of chocolate in the biscuit. YUM.  Every one at work agrees to :) Thanx Joan

Very good.  Usually I like cookies right from the oven but these were much better cooled.  Substituted Splenda for white sugar and kept everything else exactly as written.  Thanks Joan

Wonderful cookies - great combination of ingredients.  What I really liked was that the cookies did not flatten out as my regular chocolate chip cookies do.  They retained a pretty shape!  Will use this recipe again.

I thought these were ok.  They are best still warm from the oven.  I probably won't make again though.
