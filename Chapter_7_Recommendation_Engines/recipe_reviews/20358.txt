I only used 1 cup sugar and think it could go down to a 1/2 cup no problems.  It was yummy.

Great taste and easy.  I left out the coconut and added extra pecans and it turned out just as I'd hoped - like a slightly firmer and less sweet version of a pecan pie.  I did need to bake this uncovered longer after I removed the foil and it was still runny in the middle even after cooling.  Don't know if it had anything to do with my modifications.  But it was still really good!

The pie was easy to make. It was good, but not great. When I ask my DH said it was ok. If I make it again, probably use only half of the coconut, and/or pecans.

I bake this pie in twos and keep one in the freezer for a quick dessert.  I LOVE THIS PIE.  My husband who hates chess pies, loves it also.  Great recipe!

This is the best pie I've ever had. Pecan pie has always been my favorite but this puts a nice spin on it. My kids ate it up too.

I had an extra pie crust and was browsing AllRecipes to find a new pie to try.  This recipe caught my eye because these are my three favorite pies!  I figured it would be easy to taste the pecan and coconut, but I doubted whether the actual flavor of chess would come through.  Boy, was I wrong!  This pie actually tastes like all three pies in one.  It is very sweet and rich and reminds me of all the pies I had growing up.  Love it!  I made it as-is except for the substitution of butter instead of margarine.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this pie for a fundraiser at work and the feedback was terrific. It does exactly what the contributer says: combines the best of three Southern pies; pecan, coconut, and chess. It is yummy!!

We're not much for pecan pies but this one was excellent. Made 2 for our church bake sale and they were gone immediately. Made one for Thanksgiving and everyone who tried it loved it.

Not sure what happened,  I followed the recipe exactly. Top was nice and crusty brown.So looked forward to dessert! Cut into the pie, inserted the pie server and pulled out soup! (Tasted good, lol.) Any tips will be appreciated.

Made for my gluten-free son.  A couple of substitutions: I used 1 C sugar, and sweetened coconut flakes.  I also didn't have any lemon juice on hand, but used white vinegar (as my mom's chess recipe calls for).  Used a gluten-free crust and gluten-free flour, and it was delicious!  There wasn't a piece left!

At a house dominated by regular Pecan Pie it held its own.  I found unsweetened coconut flakes at Wal-Mart.  I toasted them before incorporating them.  Next time I think I will try light brown sugar, but that is just me tweaking.  There is no need with this pie.

This is one of my newest favorite “go to” pies!  What I altered:  1. Based on other reviews, I only used 1 cup of sugar and 3/4 cup of shredded coconut.  All other ingredients  I kept the same measurements. I like to reduce my gluten intake, so instead of regular all purpose flour, I used the same measurement but with King Arthur’s All Purpose Gluten-Free Flour.  2.  I also added 1/2 Tbsp of Tapioca granules for additional thickening since a lot of reviews used the “as is” recipe and got some runny results.  Tapioca granules are great for thickening.  3.  I set my oven temp at 330*F for the first 50 minutes of loosely foil-covered pie.  Then, I turned it down to 325*F and removed the foil and let the pie continue to cook and brown for another 10 minutes (60 minutes total cooking time).  End result was a gorgeous looking, perfectly firm chess pie with natural coconut and pecan pie flavorings that were delicious on the tongue!  :-)  So glad I found this!

Since my only pie plate is a 9-1/2 inch deep dish, I had a feeling I was going to have to adjust the amount of servings in order to have enough filling.  Made recipe as is except I only had 3/4 c. of pecans to use, used real butter, and I cut back the sugar to 1 c.  Poured in into the crust and it only filled up about 1/2 way.  Since I only had one egg now, I adjusted the recipe for 3 servings and mixed it up.  I then added it to the filling already in the pie plate.  Since I was now out of pecans I added a little extra coconut and used white vinegar in the second batch because I didn't want to cut a new lemon for just 1 tsp. of lemon juice.  I also cut back the amount of sugar by 1/4 c. and accidentally spilled a little extra vanilla into the mix.  Next time I'll have to make a recipe for 12 servings in order to fill my pie plate.   I baked it for 70 minutes, removing the foil during the last 25.  The color looked about right but was a little paler in the center.  When shaken there was no jiggle so I pulled it out of the oven.  It's cooling now and I can't wait to taste it.  Update:  Tastes good, but I think next time I'll leave in a little more sugar and maybe add some chocolate chips to the bottom of the pie.  Will make again when I have all the ingredients on hand.  Maybe increase vanilla and sub vinegar for lemon.  Didn't care for lemon flavor in this dish.

I made two of these pies, one as directed and one with Splenda and an extra jumbo egg. A sugar-free version would need more tweaking however as my attempt resulted in a dry pie. However a dollop of cool whip made it enjoyable. The pie made per directions sold for $35 at the church bake sale. The purchaser informed me the pie was moist, unusual and enjoyed. 
It just has too much going on for my taste without anything really shining, I will not make it again.
