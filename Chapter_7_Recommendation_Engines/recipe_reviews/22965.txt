I tried out this recipe on 20 of my friends and they all loved it!  It took me minutes to make; I doubled the recipe and prepared it in oversized shallow glass bowl.  What a stunning presentation.  What a hit!

My 10 year old daughter made this for our  Thanksgiving.  We loved it!  the crust is fantastic and will be one we use for many pies.  The filling was frozen and very refreshing after a heavy meal.  Wonderful pie. :)

This turned out really well, all my guests enjoyed it.  I omitted the Walnuts & maple syrup from the crust and just used store bought whipped cream when searving.
