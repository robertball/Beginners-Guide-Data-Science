I did not have a fresh coconut so I used 2 cups of the packaged brand, I think next time I would use a little less, however this is a  wonderful creamy coconut custard  and it is going to be very hard to stay away from, I tried it right out of the oven. Great tasting, will be making it again.

My 2 year old and I love to drink the coconut water which is so incredibly healthy.  I was looking for something to make with the fresh coconut meat.  If you aren't familiar with young coconuts search youtube for "how to open a young coconut."  Not only is it interesting to watch but important to know how to open them correctly without injuring yourself or spilling the coconut water.  I use a simple chef's knife to open them.  Back to the recipe, I chopped the fresh coconut in the food processor to get the pieces uniform. Mine took longer to cook but I think it's because I didn't use hot water in the water bath which I will definitely do next time.  This dish does not taste too eggy, too coconutty, or too sweet.  It's a perfect balance of flavors.  Very easy to make.  I will make this dish often.  Thank you for a great recipe!

We were looking for a recipe to make with a fresh coconut we bought.  This is like a firm custard.  My stepdaughter made it and like it alot.  I'm not a dessert person so I'll take her feedback to post my review.

I made this for a pot luck party. This made enough filling for 2 of the premade graham cracker crumb pie shells. This pie was the hit of the party and people were saying it tastes just like back in the Philippines. I used a package of the frozen shredded young coconut instead of a fresh one and it was perfect.
