Great and easy!! I made homemade Salisbury steaks and mashed potatoes, the gravy was perfect on both. Will use this recipe again. 
Thank you for sharing it.

Made this with the following:  Made egg noodles, sautaed fresh garlic, 1 poblano pepper, and mini peppers: red and yellow.  Then took sirlion 'kabobs', cut them into bite size pieces and cooked with the other stuff then mixed that all with the noodles.  Served on plates with the gravy (perfect!) and the dish was a big hit! :)
