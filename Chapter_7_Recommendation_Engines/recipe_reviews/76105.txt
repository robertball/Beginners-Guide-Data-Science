Yum! I used instant potatoes. I made them as directed and held back a bit on the water by maybe 1/4 or 1/2 cup. Heated it as directed then used a hand blender to blend it adding the buttermilk to get the consistency I wanted. Made them taste more home-made and actually better than the average I thought.

OK - Let's be honest there's nothing really healthy about this recipe and it's a heart attack waiting to happen.  But there's times when you just need some comfort food.  Right now is one of those times....  I cut the recipe in half and reduced the amount of onion a lot. I added some cracked black pepper and didn't bother with the additional buttermilk on the side.

This is a great recipe...one that I have been using for YEARS! Our family originated from Poland, and this recipe came over with my grandmother. The only difference is that while frying the bacon, we add the onion, and then fry the mashed potatoes in the bacon grease. Serve hot, and pour cold buttermilk on top like gravy....these are even better the next day! Great recipe...thanks for submitting it!!

I prepared this with the ingredients called for, using the measurements only as a guide, and adding some finely chopped green pepper for even more flavor and interest.  The bacon, understandably, makes these unbelievably flavorful.  I included the bacon grease and still added some butter to boot!  I've never made mashed potatoes with buttermilk before, always wondering if they'd make the potatoes too sour/tangy.  Not to worry -  the buttermilk taste is subtle. I'll remember this when I have buttermilk to use up.  I didn't serve the potatoes with extra buttermilk to dip them in because they accompanied meatloaf and gravy (and, truthfully, because dipping the potatoes in a side of buttermilk seemed a little odd to me).  We loved this embellishment of traditional mashed potatoes to wake them up.

I made this for two separate dinners this Christmas. I made the first on the day of the dinner and the dish was very good but not outstanding, but I noticed that this dish tasted better the next day so on the the second dinner, I made this the day before and reheated it in the oven on the day of the dinner. Wow it was the best mashed potatoes. The flavours were yummy! I did use less buttermilk. I added it slowly until I achieved the desired consistency and I did not use the buttermilk as a dipping sauce. The bacon really made the difference.

Yum-my. I cut this in half, used sweet onions and a quality smoked bacon I bought from Tacoma Boys. I didn't need quite as much buttermilk as called for. I did add a cut of butter in with a bit of the bacon grease to fry the onion in. Heaven. I served this with Reunion Meatballs and steamed broccoli. Not a healthy meal by any stretch but holy moses, was it tasty!

This recipe called for way more buttermilk than needed. Next time I will just use a little bit of buttermilk and use in combination with low fat milk instead.

I had some "Gotta-Go" in the fridge so this recipe was perfect. I used chopped canadian bacon and sized the recipe to what I had left of buttermilk. I had to use some butter with my bacon, it didn't have much fat. Really good potatoes!

One of the best mashed potato recipes I have ever made!! The flavor is over-the-top with such few ingredients. I also added salt and pepper to suit my taste.

Simply the best mashed potatoes I every made. Using buttermilk made the potatoes very fluffy, the bacon added wonderful flavor. I didn't add all the cooked onions in the recipe. I used approx 3 teaspoons which was plenty for me.

I agree with some of the reviews that call out the 2 Quarts of Buttermilk. I used 1 Qt and added a stick of butter. Also ... we put roasted garlic in every mashed potato recipe no matter what the ingredients. 

Then to lean it towards healthy I lightly roasted two cookie sheets of chopped veggies sized similar to the Turkey Bacon which was about 1" X 1".  I say "lightly roasted" because it's mostly to dry them out a bit so they didn't mess up the mash, not to get that browned/roasted look or taste. I wanted to keep some of the fresh veggie flavor.  Various color peppers, broccoli, corn, carrots. Threw the veggies in about halfway through roasting two heads of Elephant Garlic. And by the way, I roasted the Onions too rather than frying them

I guess my version is really nothing like this LOL ... We call ours "Loaded Mash" (play on Loaded Baked Potato) ... but I do want to credit this recipe for the inspiration... buttermilk. I usually use Meyenberg evaporated goat milk, or Coconut Manna which are both a bit sweet, so the tang of buttermilk was a lightbulb moment. As a finishing touch I threw in a container of shredded organic Parmesian cheese.

This is my first review: This is one of my favorite comfort foods, but how my Oma (German for Grandmother) made them is she would use regular milk for the mash potatoes and then mix it as suggested.  You would then serve the potatoes and create a well in them and pour cold buttermilk on your individual serving.  Yum!  It makes me think of her so much.

We have been using a version of this Polish dish for 70 plus years.  We started with just onions fried in lard and mashed into the potatoes.  Then we fried the onions in bacon and used the bacon grease.  Now I use diced pork and onions fried in butter.  The buttermilk is always used just for dipping.  Nothing but the butter, pork and onions are added to the potatoes.  The potatoes are left lumpy.

Tip 1: Do not skimp on the bacon! I quadrupled the recipe but only tripled the bacon and I was disappointed. Tip2: If you don't have buttermilk and think you can use regular milk or whipping cream, think again. They taste a little more bland this way. If you don't have buttermilk, put a tablespoon of white vinegar to 1 cup of milk. Let sit for 5 minutes and you've got buttermilk. Tip 3: Other reviewers are right, there's way too much buttermilk if you follow the recipe. Add until you achieve desired thickness. Tip 4: You can use all the bacon grease. I did, and it's great! Overall, this recipe is the best simplest recipe for mashed potatoes I've come across and it's good!

These were amazing. My husband asked what I did to the potatoes. He never notices differences I make to a dish. He loved them.
