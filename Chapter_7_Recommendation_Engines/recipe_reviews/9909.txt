Realy really, good! But it took me a few tries to get the technique right. This might help: the chocolate has the be very hot and the balls must be very cold for the chocolate to stick right. I melted the chocolate in the microwave, so I popped it back in for about a minute every couple minutes;  and DONT take the balls out of the freezer until RIGHT before you are about to dip them. They will start to sweat after being out for a few minutes and this will keep the chocolate from sticking.

I've made this recipe several times and everyone loves them!  I use 4 cups confectioner's sugar and 2 cups peanut butter.  A few other techniques that have helped: chill the peanut butter mixture in the fridge 30 minutes before making the balls - this will help make a smoother, rounder buckeye. Also, melt more chocolate than the recipe calls for so you have a good pool of chocolate to dip the ball into (you'll throw chocolate away, but it will make the product look better).

For those of you who do not wish to use the stove top, try using a crock pot. The chocolate melts easy and stays melted for as long as you need. Remember to set it on low. If you don't plan on using your crock pot soon, cover and reuse chocolate at another time.

Quick tip for easier dipping. The obvious one of melting the chocolate in the microwave. I've made these since high school and never thought of that! The next tip is to use an ice cream scoop to get a scoop of chocolate and then dip the balls in that. The ice cream scoop gets enough chocolate in it to make 3-4 small buckeyes and if it falls off the toothpick, it's not falling far! It also helps to get a full, nice covering of chocolate instead of having to roll around the ball to get the top partially covered. Then, you can use a shallower bowl instead of something too deep for the chocolate.

I've been eating my grandmother's wonderful Buckeyes all my life so I decided to give this recipe a try (since I didn't have her recipe handy).  I would recommend this recipe with the following tweaks: definitely cut the sugar and sift it- I used about 4 cups, which worked well; add a tablespoon or two of shortening to the chocolate to help it stay a little firmer at room temperature; use semi-sweet chocolate as specified(I used a blend of milk choc and semi-sweet and it was too sweet); and to save time, just microwave the chocolate at a medium setting and stir periodically- it comes out perfectly creamy and there's no need for the messy double broiler.  What a great holiday treat!  Yummy!

This recipe is AWESOME!!!  I did a little altering... For the peanut butter, I used Smuckers Natural creamy peanut butter(it has no trans fat.  I am pretty much a health freak.), Smart Balance buttery spread(this stuff rocks to cook/bake with!) and I didn't have any semi sweet chocolate, so I used Bittersweet chocolate chips.  Everything was Perfect!!!  Also, instead of melting the chocolate on the stove, I put it in the microwave and stirred it every 40 seconds or so.  Much quicker!!!  You have to try the recipe this way.  It is about as close to healthy buckeyes as you can get!!

I make buckeyes every holiday season for my students (I teach high school).  This recipie is great.  I only have one hint.  Add some parafin wax to the melted chocolate.  The wax will thin out the chocolate and make it easier to dip.  Plus, you won't use so much chocolate...this is especially helpful if you are making a double or triple batch like I do every year

HELP!!! I can't figure out what I did to this recipe.  My mixture is too fluffy and when i started rolling them into balls they stuck to my hands and now they look like little porcupines.  I added the correct measurements but something happened.  I wonder if using my kitchenaid mixer was too much.

Rolling the balls was very sticky, so I put powdered sugar on a paper plate and dipped both palms in after rolling each ball and it worked wonders; balls came out smooth.  I also decreased the sugar in the recipe to about 4 cups, and sifted first.

This was exactly what my husband was looking for!  Tastes just like those candy easter eggs.  I used milk chocolate instead of semisweet & it gave it a much better blend...not as bitter as with semisweet.  Great taste & I'll be making it every Christmas now!

This was a fairly easy recipe to make.  I did do as others suggested and increased the peanut butter to 2 cups and decreased the confectioner's sugar to 4 cups....it seemed to make the dough a nice consistency.  I also refrigerated the dough before rolling out the balls, as well as used powdered sugar on my hands to keep the dough from sticking.  I used the crock pot to melt the chocolate and it worked perfectly.  The only problem with this recipe that I saw is it makes a LOT more than 30 buckeyes.  I doubled the recipe and ended up with well over 175 buckeyes!

I've been making buckeyes at Christmas time since I was 12 years old! I've found that the key to Buckeyes is FLEXIBILITY! I cut the butter down to 1/4 cup (it really doesn't need butter at all to be delicious). I used 1 1/2 cups peanut butter and then added one cup of sugar at a time until I had the desired consistency. It should turn out like a firm dough. If that means adding more sugar than the recipe calls for, go for it! You can't ruin these if you use the recipe as a starting place... :) 

I don't reccommend putting a tooth pick in every single one before chilling them. In fact, it works better NOT to because as the peanut butter cools it will pull away from the toothpick. I used ONE toothpick for my entire batch AFTER they chilled. 

Yum. :)

I made these ahead for fondue, so no chocolate on top for now.  Since this recipe doesn't melt the butter first, it works a lot better to cream the butter and p-nut butter together first and then add the sugar gradually.  You need a dry dough, but if you just dump & stir as the recipe says it will be way too dry and the butter won't distribute correctly.

I have attempted to make buckeyes like 4 times. This time they turned out awesome! Firstly, I upped the peanut butter to 2 cups. Kept butter the same and only used 4 cups of sugar. Perfect sweetness! HOWEVER, be sure and get it super cold before you roll the balls or else you will have a terribly hard time forming balls. The warmth of your hands will melt and you will want to pull your hair out! Ha. After rolling uniform balls they MUST put in the freezer for about an hour to set and get nice and hard. I put the toothpicks in before I set them in the freezer. Meanwhile get the chocolate melting in a double boiler. I used 1.5 bags of 12 ounce chips with a 1/2 4oz bar of shaved parafin wax. Melt well. Paraffin wax is GREAT! Take 5 balls out of the freezer at a time to dip in the melted mixture. You will get the hang of it after awhile. There is def an art to dipping! I hope this helps avoid the nightmares I have faced trying to make these things! And remember, patience is the key :)

These are fantastic! Took some time, but well worth it.  I used 2 cups peanut butter and 4 1/2 cups conf. sugar. The mixture was perfect.  I also used an ice cream scoop to help coat with chocolate.  What a brilliant idea!! I also added a bit of shortening to the chocolate to give it a shine.  Smooth out the toothpick holes after the chocolate has set.  I'm from Maryland, buy my relatives in Ohio would be proud!

Completely off base with the ingredients. Way too much confectioners' sugar. Stop at 4 cups and increase peanut butter to 2 cups. I should have looked at the reviews before making, what a mess!

The reason some people had problems with smoothness is that sugar should be sifted and 3 cups sugar to 1 1/2 peanut butter are so much easier.  Had this receipe from a very old Ohioan.
Glad I found this on internet as I had lost my original, but I remember sugar was only 3cups not 6.

this calls for WAY TO MUCH sugar, i used 4 cups and it was perfect there is no way that 6 cups would have blended it would have been a crumbly mess, so be warned do not use 6 cups of sugar. other than that these were very good i used chocolate bark to coat and it was perfect.

I loved this recipe. Although several of the reviews said the amount of sugar was too much. I found it just right. However, I creamed my room temperature butter and peanut butter together and then slowly added one cup at a time of powdered sugar. They turned out superb.

I have made this recipe numerous times and they are perfect!!! I double the batch because my two sons can eat one batch by themselves. I do not change a thing in the recipe and get rave reviews everytime that I share them with others. They are truly the best buckeye recipe I have ever had and the only one I will use from now on!!! Thanks!

We love this recipe. It is very sweet though. Next time I'll cut back on the sugar. After forming into balls I refrig. them for 1 hour to get them firm. Then dip into melted choc. and refrig til choc is firm. I agree with another reviewer, add rice krispies. It's sooooo good.

I have been making these every year for 10 years now from Mrs. Winter's recipe. Everyone raves over them! I NEVER have enough! I have found that hershey chips & creamy jif peanut butter is the best! The best thing to do is put your hands in and start kneeding hard..milk chocolate is what goes first...dark chocolate is great too..You can also drizzle melted peanut butter chips on top or roll them into crushed peanuts. Make them in the gold 1 inch foil holders and place in some tins..they make great gifts to neighbors, friends, etc..

i've used this recipe a few times now and i really like it. the last batch i made yesterday i couldn't use all 6 cups of sugar because it was just getting too dry to get to stick and roll. that wasn't too much of a problem, the one question i did have though is there a way to make these so that the finished product does not show the hole from the toothpick? mine have that dang hole in them so i don't think it looks as neat and pretty..

This is a favorite childhood dessert. I used only 4 cups powdered sugar and had no problem rolling into balls. I used real butter and I think if you use margarine, it becomes hard for the balls to maintain shape. Following reviewers suggestions, I freezed the balls and made sure the chocolate was hot before dipping. Also, I added 2 T shortening to chocolate and it coated nicely. I will do this from now on because I disliked other recipes that used paraffin wax

To help get the chocolate to stick better, I put in half a cake of Gulf Wax in with the chocolate chips when I melt them. (I cut the wax into small pieces first so it won't take so long to melt.) It doesn't change the flavor and the chocolate stays a bit more firm on the candy itself.

This recipe uses too much powdered sugar.  I used a better recipe last year which included crushed graham cracker crumbs.

Very good, but I changed the proportions. Used 2 cups of peanut butter and 4 cups of confectioners sugar. I didn't have any problems with the mixture being too sticky with the change in proportion. I did the chocolate in the crock pot, and it ended up being much thicker than if I'd done it over the stove, so I refrigerated the balls for about an hour to make sure I didn't lose them while dipping. Used a deep ladle as a dipping vessel instead of dipping them directly in the crock.

My family is addicted! I've started passing these things off as my own, and they think I'm a genius! My mother-in-law begs me to make her these things, and now that we live away at college I usually make them about every six months and freeze them. They're great frozen, and they last forever since they're so tasty and sweet it only takes a few to be satisfied.

I had a nightmare with these, but it was not the recipes fault!  I have never made anything like this before, and never dipped anything in chocolate.  I melted mine in the crockpot because it seemed so easy...however, apparently if you get even 1 drop of water in melted chocolate it will "seize" and get really solid and change the texture of the chocolate.  So that was my problem.  I ended up making it work and even saved the recipe and they turned out pretty good considering the texture of the chocolate is a little funky.  They have a great flavor and are super easy to make....just make sure you don't get any water in you melting chocolate!  If you haven't done it before you might "google" it for some tips before you do it, what I should have done : )  Will make again and learn from my mistakes!

I love these, they are easy to make and taste good. when i use this recipe, heres what i change.. 
I use an Almond bark bar of chocolate instead of chocolate chips, and when making the "eye" i use a tablespoon to measure them with, by doing so i can get about 70-80 buckeyes, using the amounts listed. 
My family and co-workers love them, along with myself.

I've made these for over 40 years. I add a 1/4 of a cake of shaved paraffin to the chocolate melted in a double boiler-helps the chocolate set. And our recipe never called for vanilla. We don't freeze them either, just refrigerate until very firm. Freezing causes them to sweat. This is a Christmas staple in Ohio, our state tree is a Buckeye. MAIN THING: Close the toothpick hole!!! I hate to see them with the toothpick hole. Real buckeyes don't have a hole in the middle (unless it's got worms! LOL!)

Love this recipe!!! I triple it and throw in a dozen buckeyes with holiday gifts. Here's the best tip for easier dipping: vegetable shortening! Mix some in with the chocolate and it will stick easier and dry shinier.

I used this to make my Easter eggs this year. I made a few ajustment. ***I only used 4-C powder sugar. ***I used the milk chocolate candie disc you can buy instead of the chips it calls for to cover my eggs. I froze the eggs; I got a few out at a time; then covered them with the chocolate; (works better when their frozen) used a toothpick to dip then with. It take some time but they turn out wonderful. Everybody just raved about them and wanted the recipe. This recipe is a keeper. Thanks for the recipe. :);):):)

If the quantities of the ingredients were correct, this would have been a good recipe; however, even to the eye itself, 6 cups of powdered suger to 1 1/2 cups of peanut butter is extreme, and wastes the suger.

These were good but too much sugar, couldn't taste the peanut butter.  I made them again and cut back the sugar to 4 cups and added 1/4 cup more of peanut butter.  I used the organic non sweetened peanut butter and they were great this way.

These were really sweet! They reminded me a little of peanut butter bars IV, except the graham cracker crumbs, make those bars a little less sweet. But, they were so easy to make and would work great to take to a holiday party. I did half the recipe and got 28. I used a 1 Tblsp. cookie scoop and did level sized scoops. I didn't bother to roll them, because I figured with the flat bottoms they would stand up better on the plate anyway. To melt the chocolate I put it in the microwave on high for 1 minute stirring after 30 seconds and it worked fine.

ok, I had to re-do my evaluation of these after making them myself. They were sooooo good!! I didn't use as much powdered sugar as the recipe called for and I also altered the chocolate coating and used half milk and half semi-sweet chocolate chips and added about 2 tbls of butter and some heavy cream...at first my coating totally started to seize and I thought I'd wasted at on of ingredients, but I just added some regular milk and it smoothed out..I think I put too much fat in!! hee hee. Anyways...these were a hit on my Christmas tray.  My cousin told me they tasted like a creamier version of a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup (R).  So you know these were good...thanks for the great recipe..I am definately making these next year!

So good!  It has taken me years to finally make these, one of my favorite treats of all time!  This recipe did not disappoint.  I was a little scared adding all that sugar that it was too crumbly, that maybe something was wrong ... nope, they rolled up great!  I did follow some advice of others in that 1. I creamed the butter and peanut butter with vanilla before stirring in the sugar, and 2. refrigerated the mix for 20 minutes before rolling (not sure if this step was necessary).  I wish I had made them a little smaller as I wasn't factoring they get even bigger with all that chocolate.  I also should have added a little shortening or paraffin to thin out the chocolate, since it went on so thick, the 4 cups of morsels wasn't quite enough.

This is the same recipe my grandma passed down to me...we've been making them at Christmas for decades now.  Though I don't leave any pb showing...we cover them completely. ;D  I usually put paraffin in my chocolate to give it that shiny, store-bought candy look, plus it tends to hold shape a little better. ;)  Thanks for posting!!

I've been making Buckeyes forever and although I did not make this recipe I was reading the reviews and can see where folks would have some problems. I use 2 sticks of butter (1 cup), 2 cups of PB (18 oz jar), 1-1/2 lbs of powdered sugar (I use a scale, weigh, then sift) (btw, 1 lb = roughly 4 cups), 2 TABLEspoons of vanilla. In a large pot (6 qt) I slowly melt the butter and PB together, stirring until smooth. Once smooth, remove from heat, add vanilla and then powder sugar, a cup at a time. The mixture will be crumbly. With clean hands, I use my hands to incorporate/knead the sugar into the butter/pb. The mixture is a bit dry. While still warm, I make several large oblong shaped balls (think snow balls how you have to "pack" dry snow into ball) then I break off small pieces and roll into little balls (16-18 grams). I put them on a cookie sheet in the freezer for a couple of hours. I melt the chocolate with PARAFFIN wax. You don't need much wax. The wax keeps the chocolate smooth and easy to dip in and out, AND the result is a beautiful shine. I tried one time to dip in melted chocolate without wax and I couldn't believe what a disaster. It clumped and they looked terrible.

These were good if you like REALLY sweet. Two suggestions that I will try the next time I make these. #1 - substitute 1 cup unsweetened cocoa for 1 cup confectioners sugar & # 2 use unsweetened or perhaps bitter chocolate to coat these.  If using bitter chocolate, let chocolate set & then sprinkle with icing sugar.  This will make them look pretty too.  I tossed all ingedients in my Kitchenaid and it turned out great.

Not as good as I thought they would be! Way too much powdered sugar as some of the others suggested! It really takes away from the flavor and way too sweet! Luckily my kids like them! I think I will keep searching!

Ive been making these my whole life with a slightly different version of this recipe.Tips:make sure your dough is cold, very cold or will be sticky when balling...use fruit baller to roll out even balls...and we used to add paraffin wax to the chocolate to aide in melting and consistency when living in Wisconsin, but you can microwave just fine...and remember..if dough starts getting too sticky put back in fridge for a few seconds and before dipping in chocolate so that it sticks better! enjoy!

These are decadent.  I substituted Splenda for the sugar and milk chocolate for the semi sweet chips.  My younger son LOVED these.  He raved about them for days.

These are my family's favorite!!  I have found that instead of melting my own chocolate it is easier to buy Baker's brand melting chocolate and dip them in that.  You just microwave the chocolate for 30 seconds and presto you have perfect melted chocolate.  It works great.  For this recipe you need three containers of chocolate.

I have made these since I was a child and they are great. I don't actually use measured amounts anymore, though. My tips would be to mix the peanut butter, butter, vanilla, and sugar by hand. It will be a little messy, but you can make sure the texture's right (just make sure to have someone available to pour more sugar in the bowl if needed). Mixing is the perfect job for kids since messy cooking is always fun. Also microwave the chocolate with a little vegetable shortening. It is a lot quicker & easier.

When it says the mixture will be dry, that's no kidding. Even after rolling into balls, you couldn't get the toothpick in without splitting them open.  So I went ahead and put them in the freezer for a half hour, still inserting the toothpick caused them to split.  This recipe really frustrated me because it was just WAY  too dry to work with.

followed other's suggestions for 4c sugar (sifted) and adding shortening to the chocolate.  Also creamed the butter and pb first and mixed the sugar in 1c at a time.

First recipe that included the freezing part. When I tried a different one, that didn't include that, they fell apart when I tried to dip them. Definitely the key to success!!! Go Bucks, O-H.....I-O

These were really good!  My husband and I were craving peanut butter and chocolate but I was out of eggs to make cookies so I made these instead. They are a little sweet for me but my husband LOVED them!  The only change I made was adding 2 teaspoons of shortening to the melted chocolate.  It made it smoother and easier to dip into.  Next time I won't make them so big!!  :)

I made these for our Superbowl Party tomorrow and my boyfriend and I just tried one.  They're dangerous...because they are soooo good!  I usually read through 4 or 5 reviews before making something off this website to see what changes people suggest.  I forgot to on this one and ended up making them exactly as the recipe says and they seem to be perfect.  I like the texture, the amount of peanut butter flavor, they hold together well.  Just plane deliscious.  I did roll half of the batch in crushed nuts so people will have their choice tomorrow at our party.  Can't wait to put them out.

Very delicous indeed! I used 2 cups peanut butter and 4 cups confectioners sugar, froze them for 30 minutes, then put the toothpicks in and dipped away. They turned out marvelous!

This is a very good recipe. I use one similar to this except I add paraffin wax to the melted chocolate. It helps the chocolate to set up better. http://homecooking.about.com/od/cookingfaqs/f/faqparaffin.htm

In order for the chocolate to "stick" you must ADD 2T melted crisco and make sure the peanut butter balls are very cold. I used Milk Chocolate Chips or the Milk Chocolate candy disks from the candy store. Add the 2T of melted Crisco to the chocolate before melting.

I've had this recipe in my family for a long time, except mine calls for 2 cups of rice crispy cereal - it makes for a fun crunchy version.  EVERY time I make it, people gobble them up so fast - and, I eat too many - so many that I can't stand peanut butter for awhile afterward.  :)

I think it calls for too much sugar and not enough peanut butter, because the balls end up so dry they crumble when you try to put the toothpicks in them.

Great recipe. I must say I don't get it when folks say a candy is too sweet.  IT'S CANDY!!! I'm getting my homemade Christmas candy tray ready...now on to the caramels! Thanks for sharing this recipe.  P.S. I did add an extra 1/2 cup of peanut butter.

This is simply the best buckeye recipe there is.  It has not been matched by any homemade or store bought buckeye that I have ever eaten in the last 25 years as an adult.  My children and I have a deal.  As soon as they find buckeyes falling from our trees, I make candy buckeyes for them and they collect the nuts for me to decorate the house.  I don't use the toothpicks to get the chocolate on, it never worked for me.  I just melt the chocolate chips in the microwave a few at a time, on a low power setting.  Absolutely yummy!

Wow these are good.  Had a Christmas party to attend for hubby's work and needed to bring a dessert.  Since we got this awful ICE storm....I had to make something with things already in the pantry.  This was perfect.  The only reason that I gave a 4 star rating is because it is almost too sweet and I reduced the amount of sugar already.  I also decided in order to hide the toothpick holes to drizzle (leftover)chocolate sauce on top so no one would notice.  I will definately be making again, but will try to find a happy medium with "too sweet".  Thanks for the post...you saved me.

I was looking for a good peanut butter center for truffles, sadly this wasn't it. It was too sweet (and I have a sweet tooth), all I tasted was the sugar. I was able to remedy it by upping the peanut butter to 4 cups.

This rating may reflect on me.  The taste is certainly good.  My problem is that I froze my peanut butter for 4 hrs.  The buckeyes defrosted in 10 min., and the peanut butter balls fell apart in the chocolate.  No one else seems to have had this problem, what did I do wrong?

I thought these were excellent!  I made two different recipes.  The first time I followed the directions exactly. I used Extra Crunchy peanut butter, which turned out to be a "good" mistake.  It gave them more texture.  I did make the balls too large, though (they were pretty difficult to eat).  The next day I made them with less sugar, more peanut butter and smaller balls.  They were a huge hit at my party. I even got comments like, "These are the best things I've ever had!"

I measured 6 cups of powdered sugar and it was WAY too much! Now, I have to add butter and peanut butter until I can get it to the correct consistency. Next time, I will browse the recipes more, or weigh my powdered sugar. Also, for the people that have issues with the chocolate: use the bowl over simmering water method. You will end up with a dried mess if you do it in the microwave. You'll need to work very quickly and stir the chocolate often, and start using it as soon as the chips are melted. I used this technique with a recipe that had the correct amount of powdered sugar, and it worked perfectly.

I can't even guess how many times my kids watched this video. We have made them twice now, they are really good! It does make a lot, although we make them a bit smaller. Both times, we quartered the recipe and that was a good thing! :)

Loved this after combining tips from others users. 2 cups peanut butter, 4 cups confectioners sugar, 4 cups of chocolate chips. Froze the dough before i made the balls and again after i made them. (Before dipping)  I used a crockpot for the chocolate and put 2-3 tablespoons of vegetable shortening, made the chocolate smooth and coat well. These looked and tasted amazing. Left over chocolate? Took another hint from someone. NO WASTE! Throw in 1/4 cup of peanut butter and some nuts (i had mixed) into the crockpot then pour onto a small tray covered with wax paper and chill. Mmmmmm.

I made these for dessert at an Ohio themed dinner party. They went over really well, but the amount is just too much! If I had made a half recipe I would have had just enough for leftovers for the kids, but I had to sent some home with everyone. Not that anyone complained! Overall a great recipe!

The amount of icing sugar takes away from the peanut butter taste. Best advice is to make them real small. Think ferrero rocher size.

My mom used to make these every Christmas, so this year I tried them. I'm really glad I read the other reviews because I cut the amount of powdered sugar to 4 cups, and I almost wish I had cut more. They turned out really good, but I think next time I will add more peanut butter and less regular butter. Just not enough peanut butter taste for me. Someone suggested to put powdered sugar on your palms when rolling the balls, that worked so well for them to stay smooth and not too sticky to handle, and I added a bit of crisco to my chocolate, that helped when dipping. Also make sure you don't make them too big (as I did) they will almost be too much, you want a one bite kind of size.

I like to follow my grandmother's recipe,  I believe it's much better.

2 cups chunky peanut butter (18 oz jar)
3 cups powdered sugar
1/4 lb. salted butter (1 stick)
3 cups Rice Krispies
1/4 of one stick of paraffin food wax
12 oz. bag of semi sweet chocolate chips.


1.  Put Rice Krispies in a gallon zip lock bag and proceed to break them down about half way with a rolling pin.

2. Cream together peanut butter and butter in a mixer.  Then add Rice Krispies and powdered sugar.  Don't over mix!

3.  Chill "dough" in freezer for about 30 min. or until consistency hardens and can form balls  that hold their shape.

4. While your "dough" is chilling, melt chocolate chips and wax in a double broiler.

5. After dough is chilled enough,  start forming little balls about an inch or a little bigger in diameter.  Dip the balls in to melted chocolate and place on wax paper.
(it may be easier to chill the dough, then form balls and chill them again for easier dipping.)

Place balls in fridge after wards to chill.

Then, WALLAH!  You just crafted some mighty fine tasting balls that are so good, they'll make you want to do a little dance.

I love Buckeyes and this recipe is very easy.  I read some of the reviews but decided to make as the recipe called for.  Next time I will sift the sugar and decrease to 4 cups like some others suggested.  I would like more of a peanut butter flavor and I do think the brand of peanut butter makes a difference.

These were good, but we did have some difficulties with the chocolate melting...first, after reading other reviews, we only used about 5 1/2 c. sugar. Then, when we were melting the chocolate (due to limited equipment size), we had to melt it in batches, and the first batch melted thick, but it worked. The 2nd batch would NOT melt thin enough! IT was this big glob! I tried honey (to prevent seizing), I tried water, then half & half (to thin it out)...it got thin enough (and it still hardened on the peanut butter), but it also got grainy and ugly...how can I prevent it from being so thick another time? Why did my first batch work and not my 2nd?

This is a very good recipe. The dough was a little too soft so I put the dough into the freezer for 20 minutes before rolling the balls. After the balls for formed, I put them back into the freezer for 20 more minutes. Next time I will split them up so they are not sittng out waiting to be dipped.

I make these every year and double the recipe, I add rice crispies that I have ran through the food processor to add a little texture.  It makes the filling taste a bit like the center a peanut butter cup.  I also use the crock pot for melting chocolate it works the best, and if you use melted chocolate for other baking items you can just keep adding chips to the pot all during your baking season (on low).

Awesome.  Totally awesome.  This was my first time making buckeyes myself and I think it will now be a new Christmas tradition.  The kids loved helping and we all loved eating!  I did increase the peanut butter to 2 cups and decrease the powdered sugar to 4 cups as per previous tips.  I had no problems.  Wonderful!

I made these last night and they honestly taste like butter and powdered sugar.  I even cut back on the butter and add more peanut butter and it was still way too buttery.  I will have to keep looking for a good buckeye recipe.

I make these every Christmas and give to family, neighbors and friends.  They are a family tradition. I recommend using a double boiler especially if you are making a large quantity.  Melting chocolate in microwave may get you started quicker but the chocolate immediately begins losing heat and will begin to harden very quickly ( before you are done dipping).  Peanut butter balls must be frozen and removed  from freezer just prior to dipping.  I use Crisco butter flavor to thin my chocolate just a bit because it will become thick and scorched after overheating it.   I chill a cookie sheet covered in waxed paper in my freezer and place dipped balls onto it and slide them back in the freezer.  An hour or so later I remove them and smooth over the toothpick hole.  I recommend storing them in the freezer if at all possible.  They taste good frozen also. Once you get a rhythm going from freezer to double boiler and back, your production of the candies will pick up.  I usually do the initial mixing and such in the kitchen then chill the peanut butter dough... when it comes time to form peanut butter balls.. I take it all to the kitchen table and take in a TV show or to while I'm rolling. Anyone who loves Reeses peanut butter cups will be in awe of these.  I personally find them to be even better!!   You can also make dough ahead, store in plastic storage bag in refrig.  make balls another day and dip still yet another day.  Enjoy! Robin, I think using the mixer is the problem.  Whi

Very good...I made these exactly as the recipe states and they were good.  Everybody liked them.  I thought that the peanut butter mixture was a tad too sweet.  Next time I'll use 5 cups of confectioners sugar and 2 cups of peanut butter and tweak it further if need be.  I used other reviewers tips, such as melting the chocolate chips in the microwave, and sticking them back in the freezer when the chocolate is not bonding well any more.  I got 57 buckeyes out of this recipe.  I think they are much better cold than at room temperature, so I stored mine in the fridge.  Excellent recipe as written, but I think I will try to tweak it a little to my taste.

Delicious and SO easy.  My 5-year-old daughter was able to help with almost every step.  Here are the changes I made:
Reduced sugar to 4 cups and sifted the sugar before combining.
Used Smart Balance peanut butter -- healthier and no added sugar.
Used an olive oil spread instead of butter -- less fat, no saturated fat, definitely healthier.
Used half dark chocolate chips and half semi-sweet, Ghirardelli brand.  Melted them in the microwave, stirring about once per minute.  Melted perfectly smooth in less than 5 minutes with no mess.

I make the buckeyes every year for Christmas. They are always a hit. I use a glass bowl and heat the chocolate on defrost or very low for a few seconds at a time, while stiring, being careful not to burn the chocolate. A glass bowl on a warming tray works well also.

This is an excellent recipe...if you follow it! It cracks me up that people complain about the balls being sticky when they use less sugar than called for. I followed the recipe exactly, and the balls were perfect, not sticky at all. However, I did add a little shortening to the chocolate chips to help firm it up without chilling.

Every day after I made this recipe for the Holidays my husband made it a habit to sneak one or two when he gets home from work...and he is not a sweet eater.
These are very good.  Like other reviewers have mentioned.  The peanut butter balls have to be very cold in order for the chocolate to stay on them.  I took a few out of the freezer at a time to cover them with the chocolate.  Even if they were left out for a few minutes they started to sweat and the chocolate did not stay on as good.

Great recipe! I did up the peanut butter and cut back on the sugar as others suggested and mine turned out perfectly. I doubled it and came up with about 11 dozen buckeyes. Also used the bakers dipping chocolate which is super easy to use. I did some with semi-sweet chocolate and some with milk chocolate because I accidentally bought the different kinds. I like them both equally. Definitely recommended!

To make this recipe easier I have used the premade chocolate dip that you can find in the baking section of the grocery.  Much easier than melting chocolate chips!

I actually didn't try this recipe, but if alot of people are having problems this is my recipe: 1 cup icing sugar, 1 tsp. butter, 1 cup peanut butter and 1 cup chopped walnuts or pecans.  Mix well.  Then mix 4 squares of semi-sweet chocolate and 2 tsp. of parawax in a double boiler.  Roll peanut butter mixture into a ball and dip in chocolate.  Freeze AFTER it is dipped in chocolate.

Very good.  I would like a bit more of a peanutty flavor....Will probably add more peanut butter next time.  Be sure to make them small.  I'd say 1/2" diameter.

Everyone just loves these things. In fact, I have family giving me tins to fill for them, before I even start making them. However, my recipe calls for 1/3 bar of parafin wax. It makes the chocolate smoother and keeps it from clumping. You can't taste the parafin. They look sooo pretty. I freeze my "balls" before dipping. It hardens the choc on them faster and keeps the balls from falling off the toothpicks. I learned how to make these as a child and have been making them every year since.

So I made this to bring to a friend's Thanksgiving.  (Most of my friends are gluten-free eaters so this worked well!)

I followed lots of suggestions put out by other reviewers:
1.  I only used 4 C sugar
2.  Definitely make small balls (don't get tricked that bigger is better...these are very rich!) 
3.  Put them in the freezer for 30 mins before dipping in chocolate.  
4.  Take out of the freezer in small batches or as the PB balls thaw they condensate and the chocolate won't stick.  
5.  I used a crockpot "Little Dipper" and it kept the chocolate perfect the whole time.  
6.  I also used a 1.5 Tablespoon scooper and filled it with melty chocolate to dip the PB balls into.  This was a lifesaver since sometimes the balls fall off the toothpicks and they didn't have far to fall using the scooper method.

Also, I stored mine in the fridge for two reasons---kept the chocolate shell firm and the PB I used was natural and is supposed to be kept in the fridge.

The taste?  Amazing!  Just like a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup but with better ingredients and a smoother, creamier filling!  Have fun!

Very good! Giving 4 stars since I used modification of 2 cups pb and 4 cups powdered sugar, as many reviewers suggested. Delicious this way! Chilled pb mixture prior to rolling which helped with stickiness. These will be a Christmas staple from now on.

used - 2 c. PB and 4-5 c. confectioner's sugar. Makes the buckeyes a little less rich on the sweetness side more flavorful. I also put 1 tsp. vanilla to enhance flavor. TRICK #1: Create PB balls (will be sticky/prickly-looking) and set on wax paper cookie sheets. Freeze for 10 mins. Now roll in hands to round out edges; replace on cookie sheet, insert toothpicks and freeze for 20-30 mins. TRICK #2: Fill lg. shallow bowl or baking dish with ice/water, set next to melted chocolate. After dipping balls in chocolate, immediately submerge in water and let sit for 5 mins as you keep dipping balls in chocolate. This hardens chocolate. Buckeyes repel water because of oils in chocolate/PB. Lightly pat dry with paper towel, remove toothpick, smooth over hole.

I LOVE these buckeyes! They turned out perfect my first try, although I did take the suggestion to use 2 cups of peanut butter and 4 cups of powdered sugar. I had tried these when a friend made them but these are even better! I will definitely make these again when I run out of them.

Used 4 cups of sugar instead of 6, and they're still very very sweet.  Might try reducing it further next time, or using a peanut butter with no added sugar.  Otherwise a great recipe!

This recipe was helpful for my first time making these. However, I do agree that I would up the peanut butter and less sugar. They were very sweet. But over all this was very easy and a good basis to make it your own.

I put them in the deep freezer a while to make them really frozen solid.  As for the chocolate, I add about 1/4 to 1/3 cake of wax to it.  They don't melt as fast when you hold them that way but don't effect the taste.

this is a great recipe.  i make it every year for Christmas, my family loves the candy and it is always requested.  when melting the chocolate for dipping the peanut butter balls, i add gulf wax.  makes the chocolate very easy for dipping and gives a great shine to the candy.  these often go fast around my house!

I halved the confectioners sugar and am so glad I did-would have been too sweet!  I didn't really have problems rolling the balls-but since it's hot outside I found it easiest to periodically re-chill the filling and then stick my hands under very cold water for a few moments then blot dry rpior to rolling.  Heat will turn them to a mess in your hands.  I kept reheating the chocolate coating, but it kept getting really thick really quick, and the balls kept falling off the toothpicks.  Kind of a pest, but the results were tasty!

I'm not able to review this appropriately because I used Costco's new "all natural"  peanut butter, which caused a total flop on the recipe and a waste of a lot of money and time! DO NOT use this peanut butter for this recipe! It is not pre-stirred and it is FULL of oil, which causes all sorts of problems with consistency and your buckeye balls come out super oily.

This may have been a great recipe...that is before Nestle's changed the ingredients of their chocolate chips. Now they won't melt for dipping (tried double boiler and microwave) They just get grainy. So I looked it up and sure enough, they are adding more wax so the chips keep their shape for cookies. Suggestions were to add oil or butter, which I did, but to no avail. So now I'm looking for another source of chocolate that will work for dipping.  I'll keep trying, but right now it's rather disappointing.

This was my first attempt at making buckeyes and this recipe was great. Just like I remembered them being. I did read several reviews before I tried them and halved the recipe. I started out with just 2 cups of powdered sugar and it wasnt quite enough. I poured a little more in mayba 1/2 cup. They turned out perfectly. I also refridgerated them instead of froze them and they didnt sweat as much while dipping so the chocolate stuck better.

Great recipe! Although I adjusted it a bit... I only used 4 cups powdered sugar and 2 cups peanut butter. I also let the peanut butter mixture chill in the fridge for 30 mins before rolling into balls. It's much easier to roll them this way. Overall this is a delicious and simple recipe.

These are always a hit at my parties and events! They have been a family favorite ever since I can remember. The only difference is that I usually dip the entire peanutbutter ball into te chocolate - yum!  Also, a fantastic tip for when melting the chocolate: add some Parawax (you can find it at any big grocery store franchises) to the chocolate when it's melting. And don't add any shortening/butter.  The Parawax is perfectly safe to eat and it helps prevent the chocolate from melting in your fingers from being at room temp. You would use about 4oz of Parawax for 12oz of chocolate chips. 
Try it out! (:

Love this recipe, except I alter it to make it allergen free by using Sunflower Seed Butter in place of peanut butter, using dairy/soy free chocolate chips and using dairy/soy free butter.  They are so delicious!  People are always fooled, not even realizing they are nut free.... And then my kids get to enjoy a staple, holiday treat.  They love these!!!

This is the best buckeye recipe youll find. It has the perfect butter to peanut butter ratio. other recipes call for too much peanut butter and not enough butter. With this recipe, the only change you should make is use 5 cups powdered sugar. not 6. with that one fix, its an outstanding recipe. better than reeses! also you can use white and milk chocolate for the coating

This recipe has WAY WAY WAY too much powdered sugar! 4 cups would easily do the tricky. If you use 6, they get really dry and crumbly and do not set at all.

Easiest recipe for yumminess!  My dad is crazy about peanut butter/chocolate and I SO did not feel like baking; this was the perfect solution.  A couple of tips from a girl who is usually a disaster in the kitchen: I melted the butter, which made for an easy and stirrable dough.  I then cooled the dough in the fridge for an hour before rolling balls.  I waited nearly 3 hours with the balls in the freezer before dipping them in chocolate.  I did half with milk and half with dark, to please everyone.  I also followed the advice of a rater who suggested the natural peanut butter and smart balance butter...would never know the difference.  YUMMO.

I have a child who cannot eat eggs or milk, so I substituted the sunflower seed butter for peanut butter and used dark chocolate. It made it a million times better. I had to add almost another cup of peanut butter - it was too dry and tastless without.

This has WAY too much powdered sugar and now I don't have any more ingredients. I always bring the buckeyes and this recipe just really really stinks. My whole house says to throw the batch out :( I am super bummed Worst buckeyes I have ever tried/made and my buckeyes always turn out good. They are a crumbly mess.

WAAAAY to much sugar... the recipe calls for too much sugar... I shouldve stopped when I thought so... I'm throwing them all away because they are disgusting... I'd agree with the person who said to use 4 cups of sugar... or find a different recipe all together. It was also difficult to dip them without the wax that one would normally use.

These turned out wonderful. I am so happy I found this recipe. I ended up having to use 4 cups of chocolate though to get enough coverage on the peanut butter balls. Otherwise everything turned out great.

This recipe is so yummy and fun to make for the holidays! I altered the recipe for just the right consistency... Melt in your mouth that is -Instead of the original ingredients, I mixed 2 cups of JIF peanut butter and 4 cups of sifted powdered sugar. Be sure to sift the sugar or white clumps will form during mixing. Finally, I dipped the refrigerated balls into chocolate and white chocolate Almond Bark. Enjoy!

No stove required. Been making these for years with plain chocolate chips or chocolate bark. Melts well and evenly in microwave. Also be sure to make small enough balls or they taste too chalky. I would suggest quarter size but no bigger. My son tends to make them meatball size... too big.

I make these all the time but to help with the chocolate sticking my husbands grandma gave me the tip of using parafin wax. Also make sure you sift the sugar.  It makes a difference.

Delish! I used milk chocolate chips instead of semisweet. Also I used a microwave to melt the chocolate instead of the stove and I tried to make the peanut butter balls smaller so they are easier to eat. Very yummy!

O-MAN! Are these good!  I made them for Christmas last year and My Brother in-laws and co-workers are already Begging me to make them again!  I did later the recipe slightly, I added the powdered sugar as needed.  I slowly added each cup until the mixture was firm enough to roll but not too dry to stay together.

Awesome recipe!! I listened to one of the reviews and cut the sugar to 4 cups and sifted it...had no problem rolling the balls right away...froze them to dip in chocolate. I'll turn these into eyeballs for Halloween and Ornaments for Christmas...posted a couple of pictures. Great recipe, thanks for sharing!

I have  made these for at least 25 yrs and they are a hit with everyone.  The one thing that works the best for me and who I learned them from  was to use lard/shortening about 2 Tablespoons at least and some paraffin wax to melt in with the chocolate in the process of melting .  It makes dipping easier and sets the chocolate better.  Its usually used in candy making.

This is the first time I made buckeyes and they turned out great! One thing that helped was to pack the dough into ball shapes before rolling so the didn't crumble. Definitely use just 4 cups powedered sugar, not 6. Yummm...

I love this recipe!  I've used it four times now, including as party favors at my wedding.  The only thing I will add is. Try as we might we couldn't get the chocolate to properly stick to the peanut butter balls so we added just a table spoon of paraffin wax in the crockpot with the chocolate chips.  It did wonders!

I haven't made this recipe yet but it's close to the one I use.  Another way to do the chocolate is to use Almond Bark chocolate.  It's made specifically to melt for candies and such so you don't have to add the parafin or shortening to the chocolate chips.  I'm from Ohio and these are a must have!

these were very good, and quite easy to make, however they are EXTREMELY sweet. i think next time i will cut back on the amount of sugar or something. i could only eat a few and i am a sugar freak. be sure to make the balls really small so they arn't too overwhelming.

I usually double or triple this, and they are so rich that I like to not just refrigerate them, but keep them in the freezer when they're finished. When you have a sweet tooth you can just pull one out to nibble on!

I made them for my boyfriend who is a huge fan of chocolate and peanut butter, and he loved them! I had a hard time rolling the balls to be a consistent size, so some of them were too big and difficult to eat I think. It was also a little tedious to dip them, especially if you make the balls bite size because you end up with ALOT of them.  I added shortening to the chocolate and used a small crock pot to melt it and kept it on warm. I didn't have a problem with the chocolate burning or sticking and clean up was very easy. Next time I will probably recruit someone to help me roll and dip, but other than that these are a fun treat. I agree with the other reviews-keep the balls in the freezer until right before you dip them or the chocolate will not coat properly.

we use this recipe at work....in a candy store....exact same recipe......  we add a little more PB cause it makes it a little creamier.   you shouldnt also put them im the freezer for 30 minutes just till there semi solid. putting them in the freezer causes them to sweat later. and of course water and chocolate dont mix.   but yes it is a VERY GOOD recipe  also u can mix it with your hands

The only change that I made was to add 4 tablespoons paraffin wax to the chocolate chips before melting. They will stay firm, so you don't have to store them in the fridge.

Oh my god these are good.  Made them for a cookie exchange and not many of them actually made it out of the house!  It was hard to dip the last 10 or so because they had softened and slid off of the toothepick. Had to fish them out of the chocolate, certainly didn't ruin the taste.  I would suggest using a tall skinny glass so that one can use more of the chocolate.

I make 2-4 batches every year. Favorite technique: microwave 1 pkg semisweet choc chips with 1/4 block paraffin. (15-20 seconds at a time, stirring to prevent scorching.) When dipping, swirl the bottom edge against a fork to prevent puddling at the base. I do NOT recommend adding shortening to the choc, that just makes it too soft and sweaty at room temps. I get 7-8 dozen per batch; I guess I roll them small. The ratios are perfect. Too sweet? Seriously? It's a BUCKEYE! If your chocolate is grainy, you scorched it. If your dough is crumbly, work it with your hands. Really. This recipe does NOT need altering.

Buckeyes are the best! I've always made the bar version of these but for Christmas this year I decided to make the balls. I did tweak the recipe a little. I used 2 cups PB and cut the sugar to 5 cups.  When I melted the chocolate, I used 2 cups semi sweet and 1 cup butterscoth bits, which helps to cut down the sweetness of the semi-sweet cho.  I also used about 2 tsp Crisco to thin out the chocolate.  This also helps the chocolate to set a little better.  These are currently being enjoyed by everyone in my family!

Really good!  I didn't have a toothpick (we just don't use those much), so I broke three spokes off of a plastic fork and it worked great!  I had a really good handle and it stayed in the filling so I could cover them.  I heated up the chocolate in a small bowl in the microwave in batches-worked great!

I finally found a recipe which might be the one I had 30 years ago and was regretting its loss big-time especially at Easter.  I made it yesterday with some changes - like anyone who knows me would guess.  I upped the vanilla to 1 tsp. and used 5 cups unsifted iciing sugar.  I liked that you could roll them right away.  I found 1 inch balls too large so made them approx. 3/4 inch and it made 114 pieces.  Make sure you use pure choc. or melting wafers.  4 cups of choc. chips didn't provide enough coating so I had to melt another 2 cups.  As I had both milk choc. and semi sweet choc. chips on hand, I made 2 cups of each, and one with half and half.  My lost recipe also added parafin wax so I guessed and added approx. one tablespoon to each 2 cups.  The wax won't melt at the same temp. as the chips so grate the wax and melt that separately in microwave - watch carefully as it's very flamable.  I had a bit of coating left over and used that to cover up some of the "eyes" (or else I would have just gone in a closet and eaten the melted choc. all by myself)and because of the colour difference, it looked kind of like specialty chocolates when done.  I found they keep better covered in the frige, although they're right "in-your-face" each time you open fridge door.  Yummy Yum Yum.

These turn out great.  They were a favorite of mine as a kid.  I haven't had them in years.  I can barely get them dipped in the chocolate before the hubby is eating them all.  I made them for the last school bake sale and they sold out before they hit the table (all the teachers bought them).  The PTA told me to double the recipe next time.  It is a perfect easy bake sale item that kids can make and a nice change from the usual cookies and cupcakes.  YUM!!!

my fiance and i made these last year for everyone as Christmas gifts(we live in Ohio, buckeyes are a favorite here). we made roughly 400 of them over 3 days. the recipe is wonderful! we added a wee bit more confection sugar to it to dry it up a bit(made rolling easier) but other than that we left the recipe as is and they turned out great! everyone loved them and we got raves from all our family on it. will definitely use this recipe again :D

This is the recipe I use.  I usually make these for Christmas.  I use the Wilton Light Cocoa Candy Melts instead of the chips and I put them in a glass dish to melt on my griddle.  I put the temperature on low and let the chocolate melt and work with it at leisure.  I make chocolate pretzels at the same time.  Best part is that I can turn if off and leave at any time and return later.  I also use a decorating bag with the green or red chocolate(Wilton) and put a colorful flowerette on the top of candy for a beautiful seasonal statement.  I was wondering has anyone ever put rice krispies in these or rolled them in crushed cookies?  Roll them in crushed candy canes?  Interesting........Oh yes, my original recipe calls for 4 1/2 Cups Powdered sugar.   Enjoy!

This recipe was perfect as is! You definitely need to add all the powdered sugar! Anyone that has made this before will know that the texture needs to be kind of crumbly, but sticks together when you roll it into a ball. Do NOT use only 4 cups. This was a huge hit at our OSU v MI game! Yum!

This turned out pretty good...I used chunky peanut butter for mine (extra yummy!) and added sprinkles to the outside because I am making them for my nieces.  I think my mom might add a little wax to the chocolate for shine!

I grew up in Michigan and ate these a lot growing up.  I made these this year for the OSU game, mostly for my kids.  The adults raved about them and asked me to make them for another party which was last night.  They were the first thing to be emptied from the potluck table .. by the adults!  Brings back memories for me and a new hit for potlucks!  Thanks for posting this!  (I will go easier on the sugar the next time.)

They tasted very good, no doubt about it. They were extremely frustrating to make for me. They were so hard to roll into a ball shape because they were so dry. The chocolate was a disaster in the double broiler, i put them in the microwave for 30 secs and they turned out fine. I found them to be way to sweet. 4 cups of sugar would have been better then 6. Even though they tasted good I will not make them again because of the trouble.

Delicious!  the first time i made them, they were a little dry, so now i use more peanut butter (about 2 cups) and less confectioner's sugar (about 4 cups).  i also add about 2 teaspoons of honey, which makes them taste even more like Reese's Peanut Butter Cups.

ADD a little paraffin wax to the melting chocolate.  It will set the chocolate a little quicker and will add a shine to the chocolate.

These were pretty good. I'm from Ohio and these are a staple during football season. I took another reviewers advice and added some milk to the chocolate, DON'T ADD MILK! The chocolate slid right off the peanut butter balls and it was too thin to boot. So, it is a good recipe to try, but I know I've had better. Thanks anyhow Tammy! I have them in the freezer now and I keep sneaking in and eating one every so often!

These were great. I also reduced the amount of powdered sugar to 4 cups and I used a mixture of milk chocolate chips and semi-sweet chocolate chips. I melted the chocolate in my crockpot and used the leftovers to dip strawberries. My hubby is orginally from Ohio and he always talks about how his grandmother would make him buckeyes. I had never heard of buckeyes, but wanted to make him something special for Valentines Day. He loved them. Thanks for the great recipe!

Absolutely Delicious!  I made these for a chocolate fondue.  Froze until ready then just dipped.  The only thing that I would do differently is sift the sugar next time to get the lumps out.  Thanks Tammy!

These were wonderful!  My guests were very
unhappy when they were gone.  I froze them (without
the chocolate) for 3 weeks and then dipped them 2 days
before I served them & it worked out very well.

I had a group of 4 kids over (ages 6 to ten) and they made these into "Easter Eggs".  They were easy and good!  We'll do this one again...  They mixed the "filling", shaped it, froze it, and dipped them into dark chocolate and pastel colored candy bark.

My son and I made this recipe exactly as written. This recipe has too much oleo to peanut butter in our opinion, they are very buttery with just a little  peanut butter flavor. We used Walmart store brand creamy PB. If I make this recipe for Buckeyes again, I will reduce the butter to 1/2 cup and increase the PB to 2 cups.  Side note: we had NO problems with the dough coming together, rolling it into balls, or dipping it when the ingredients were measured as written and the instructions followed as written.

We made these this afternoon.  They are awesome.  
We made 1/2 the recipe and got 51 buckeyes, which was plenty for our event.  
Reality check: it took us (my husband and myself) 2.5 hours to complete these little jewels. Just an FYI.  This time frame is including sealing the toothpick hole.  We measured 2 teaspoon scoop balls, so they would be consistent in size.  It was worth the time and effort, and we will treasure our bragging rights.

Always yummy family tradition. Make it easier on yourself and use Ghirardelli melting wafers. Takes the headache out of adding paraffin wax or shortening to chocolate chips. The chocolate hardens quickly and keeps when sitting out for guests. One batch needs about 1 1/2 packages of the melting wafers. I also chill my batch before rolling the balls. Makes them stiff and the balls roll smooth and don't stick to your hands.

Making it for the second time tonight. The only alteration I made was to the amount of chocolate. I melted one bag of semi-sweet chips and ran just shy. But the peanut butter balls uncoated are still good enough to eat plain.

This is so easy and very, very good. I used Earth Balance Spread instead of butter to make it vegan. My husband took a batch to the potluck at work and his new boss wanted to keep them all for herself! It's inexpensive and so much fun for Little Helpers to get involved.

This recipe has too much butter. The inner part needs a stronger peanut flavor and the amount of butter called for subdues it too much.

Started making this recipe about 4 years ago and it is THE cookie everyone wipes out first each year. Like others mentioned, the dough has to be very cold when you dip it. I take out one tray at a time using the double boiler method - worked much better than having them all out at once. I have had to use extra chocolate chips each time, so I would suggest making sure you don't count on using exactly 4 cups.

I love this recipe, although I usually use 2 cups of peanut butter, 5 cups of powdered sugar and a dash of salt. And I make sure to sift the powdered sugar before adding it to the mixture.

This worked out great. The mixture started to look crumbly at 4 cups of sugar, so I stopped there. If you want help with the chocolate, I usually add 1 tbs for every cup of chips. This helps thin the chocolate a little and also helps it melt so you can get a better and easier coating. I also recommend using the microwave instead of a double boiler. It's an easier process and you are less likely to burn yourself. For the reviewer who ended up with a sticky mixture, you may have melted your butter. It's important that you only soften it. Melted butter means the mixture will be runnier and therefor sticky. To fix this, try freezing the mixture for 30 mins. If that fails, add more sugar to thicken the mixture.

UPDATE: I made a lower carb version of this using 1 16oz container of PB2 powdered peanut butter in place of the powdered sugar.  Used 1/2 of powdered sugar and 1 cup of publix brand sucralose. The dough was soft (not crumbly) but firm enough to work with.

Two things. We used an all natural peanut butter (Kirkland natural PB, creamy) and they were super bland until we added a generous amount of salt: probably about 2 TBSP. So for any of you out there who, like me, care about the hydrogenated nature of JIF, Skippy, etc. PBs but still love sugary, buttery peanut butter chocolate goodness.... don't forget to taste the peanut butter mixture before rolling and freezing! The second point: I used a little more than 5 cups of sugar instead of the full 6. I really don't think THAT much sugar is necessary, but to each his/her own.

These are seriously delicious - everyone who ate them said that they were like a way more delicious version of Reese's cups. I made sure to take the balls out of the freezer once the chocolate was nice and hot, and had almost no trouble with dipping. I added a bit of canola/olive/grapeseed blend oil to my chocolate at one point, which didn't seem to affect the taste at all. I used parchment paper and aluminum instead of wax, and both seem to work okay as well.

I love this recipe!! It's a new treat I make every holiday season...and it's a big hit! I made a change this year..2 cups of peanut butter and 5 cups of conf sugar . It's just a little softer and you can freeze the balls for a longer amount of time to firm up.

Good recipe, here is a tip though....once you add ingredients and blend you need to refrigerate the dough until it's hard, it is far too sticky to roll into balls. Otherwise its great and they taste delicious!

I have made this for years since I have a lot of people who prefer buckeyes over cookies. I add 1 cup graham cracker (that I have crushed to a fine powder )and it gives a little more stability. You can't taste it either. try melting the chocolate in a chocolate pot if you have one.

It came out a little dry (though possibly my measurements were off) so I added a little peanut butter syrup.

Great recipe; I make these every year for the holidays. I agree with KatyP that the recipe needs tweaking on the measurements. 2 cups peanut butter and 4 cups powdered sugar. Also, I use a full tablespoon of vanilla. They come out great every time.

I've made this recipe several times and have loved it every time.  This time around I read the reviews and tried cutting the sugar down to 4 cups.  I also used 1/2 a cup of unsalted butter (because I didn't have salted) and I used 1/2 cup of coconut oil as a healthy alternative.  Turned out great!  Next time I'll try substituting the full cup of butter with coconut oil.

These were good. I followed the instructions, used a double burner, Richard's Creamy Peanut butter (100% peanuts), and Ghiradhelli semi sweet chips. I refrigerated the peanut buetter balls for a couple of hours so they were really cold, and dipped the balls in batches, keeping the rest cold, so they would not "sweat". They turned out perfectly shaped like little balls. The only negative is they were really sweet! My kids of course love them but they were a bit sweet for even me, and I have a real sweet tooth. Good recipe, though next time, I will use less powdered sugar!

I got this recipe from AR years ago; and make it for family vacation all the time.  I have used the semi-ssweet chocolate; but  I have also used Dark Chocolate, they are all great that way.    Also, I make them small about bite size, and after they set I freeze them on a cookie sheet; then dump in a zip lock bag.  They are so good cold, Just take out of freezer and pop in mouth - YUMMYl.  Everyone looks forward to them when we go to the beach, and by freezing they travel easy in ice chest, and last a long time.

This is our favorite Buck Eye recipe.  My 3 children and I make it several times a year for teachers and friends-- very kid friendly and very delicious!  Try dipping the balls in crushed almonds after dipping them in choc.--heaven!

Very good.  Dipping things in chocolate is a very versatile technique for desert.  I made these and also Rum Balls with dark chocolate.  Both were very good.  I used a 1" disher to make the balls and this made a 2-bite product.  If you use a smaller disher, you can make a bite size product.  I made 55 one-inch balls from this recipe.

Extremely easy to make and my family loved them! I had chocolate bark on hand so I used it instead of the chocolate chips. Must say - it was easier than the Oreo Balls I made!

I liked the flavor of these, but I really had a very hard time getting the chocolate chips to melt. I had made Buckeyes last year at Christmas but couldn't find the recipe so I thought I'd try these. Not happy! Sorry.

I used 2 cups of peanut butter.  I also added 1 recipe of failed unset caramel candy goop to the mixture and they are fabulous!  I had to play with the mixture to get it perfect but it rolled well and was not supper sticky as most people said.  Use mini chocolate morsels as they melt much faster and smoother than the others.  Keep the heat on low so it doesn't dry out or over cook the chocolate.

This is the best tasting buckeye recipe I've ever come across! My only challenges: prep time is much longer than 15 minutes! Even rolling the peanut butter mixture into larger balls, it still took a great deal of time--and I did not double the recipe. I used my Kitchenaid mixer without difficulty, and the peanut butter mix was easy to roll, even when not cold. The peanut butter mixture is so delicious, my kids want to eat it without the chocolate, so I stuck some in the freezer--they will eat them straight out of the freezer! These buckeyes don't stay as firm as most--I keep mine in the refrigerator if we don't eat them right away. But the peanut butter mix is so much more moist and creamy than some buckeyes I've had that are dry and crumbly. It melts in your mouth! Using the slow cooker for the chocolate really worked--but I added an extra cup of chocolate chips so I had plenty to work with.

This was my first time making buckeyes and they turned out great.  I used 1/2 cup creamy peanut butter and 1 cup crunchy because that's all I had on hand and it was perfect.  They still had a creamy texture, but with a little bit of crunch...just perfect.  It was a little time consuming and messy to dip each ball in the choc mixture with a toothpick.  Next time I'll just toss it in the bowl of choc and fish it out with a fork.  These were great and worth the time.  Thanks for sharing!

Was very disappointed in this recipe.  It was so dry and dusty tasting.  I doubt I'll ever make it again but if I do I will cut down drastically on the powdered sugar and up the peanut butter.  My grandkids did take them and gave them out to their friends to munch.

I have grown up on Buckeyes (we called them Peanut Butter Balls). While this recipe uses the same ingredients, I quickly found out that it was not the same amount of ingredients my family (mom) had always used. This particular recipe uses SO MUCH confectioners' sugar!  I couldn't figure out why they were SO sweet w/hardly any peanut butter taste...When I called my mom and compared the recipes it became clear! The recipe we used calls for equal amounts of powdered sugar and peanut butter plus other amounts of the other ingredients...So personally my family did not not enjoy this recipe as it was too sweet!

These were good (when can you go wrong with peanut butter and chocolate?) but kind of difficult to make. It was hard to roll the peanut butter with the toothpick into the melted chocolate without loosing the peanut butter ball. After rolling the ball in chocolate, I then rolled them in sprinkles for a festive holiday look. They didn't look fantastic, but they sure tasted good. Maybe something to make at home a few times to perfect your technique before trying to make them party presentable.

I found that using almond bark-chocolate and vanilla works really well and you dont have to add shortening. It comes out very thin in the microwave.

Easy and delicious! I also cut down the confectioners sugar to about 4 1/2 cups - the balls are probably a little softer and messier to roll this way but it's a good amount of sweetness.  These are a huge hit!

I make oodles of these each year!! Never fails--they are love by all. I add some paraffin wax to chocolate. This thins it and makes coating much easier to adhere nicely to peanut butter balls.

make sure you have your butter at room temperature or completely soften. i made the mistake of rushing and so i ended with a few clumps of butter here and there. overall buckeyes were good! brought it over for family dinner and the people who love sweets, DEVOURED these. i think they can be made smaller for easier bite snack as a few have mentioned.

I had to use 1/2 cup more peanut butter and 1/4 cup more butter and 1 cup less of powdered sugar to get them to roll without crumbling.  But, other than that tweak, these are great.

Loved them!  I made sure the butter was very soft, used about 5 cups confectioners sugar, froze the balls well before dipping in the chocolate, and left them in the fridge until just before we were going to eat them.  Very rich.  Very, very good.

These taste awesome!!  I had a little trouble getting the balls to stay on the toothpicks as i dipped them into the chocolate... The chocolate is so thick.  Maybe I'll add some shortening to the chocolate next time.

I made these buckeyes today and they were a big hit with my husband. It is cold here and instead of putting them in the freezer for 30 min, we took them out on the porch and sat them there for30 min.First time making them and it was really fun and they turn out so pretty! Thanks Tammy for this recipie. Kathy Dunn (OHIO)

SO delicious and extremely easy!  I've made this using all the recommended sugar and using about 4 1/2 cups.  I do like the consistency and the look better using less sugar, but it's hard to go wrong either way!!

My aunt makes Buckeyes every year around the holidays and they are always a favorite. I decided to try this recipe because it looked nearly identical to what she makes, but when I made them, I found that the peanut butter mixture was WAY too dry. They have great flavor, but next time I'll use only 4 cups of confectioners' sugar. A wonderful treat, I'd just make that one adjustment next time.

Just what I was looking for! I did make a couple changes...I used 2C peanut butter, 1tsp Vanilla, and 4-5C sugar I didn't measure it just added until it looked to be the right consistency. So with a few changes this recipe was perfect! Everyone loved them, Thanks!

Making buckeyes has been a family tradition for  us for years and they are the BEST!!  I make them exactly as stated.  Every Christmas everyone asks me when I'm bringing the buckeyes over!  They are a big hit with all!  You definitely need to double or triple the recipe to have enough to go around.  For those who don't want a hole in their buckeye, you just smooth the hole over with your finger after you dip it and you'd never know there was a toothpick there.  I've also had these when wax was added to the chocolate, personally I think it makes them taste too waxy and artificial.  Personal preference I guess!

Super easy and yummy! I used (and do suggest) a sugar free natural peanut butter. I used 1 jar (16 oz.) Teddie Old Fashioned Natural peanut butter and just shy of a 1 lb bag of powdered sugar. If it's a new bag you really don't need to sift it. I followed suggestions of rolling and sticking a toothpick in prior to freezing with one batch and just rolled the other batch sans toothpick. The toothpick makes it easier to dip but, then people eat them with the toothpick and they fall off after a bite (I didn't remove the toothpick because I didn't want a hole). I also drizzled white chocolate over the top of some to add to presentation.

So amazing and simple!  I made these for my friend's husband and ended up having to make another batch because mine ate them all!  Thank you so much!  I did use the tip for melting the chips in the microwave instead of a double boiler.  It was so much easier!  We used the left over melted chocolate to top our ice cream.  Very yummy!

Really yummy. I used crunchy peanut butter bc I had it on hand. I am in NO way good at detailed things like this, but I admit they came out great! The key for me was to freeze the peanut butter balls overnight in tupperware, and I used a stainless bowl atop a boiling pot of water for the chocolate. I also diluted it a little with butter shortening since it was SO thick at first. Give it a shot!!!!!!!!

Thanks Tammy! These were simple to make and tasted exactly like a homemade Reese's candy. Only I liked these better since the peanut butter was really smooth and not grainy like the middle of a Reeses' is. I froze these before dipping and had no trouble at all even though it was my first chocolate dipping experience that wasn't a stemmed strawberry and mine even turned out looking as good as the picture posted. Thanks again Tammy.

Not a thing wrong with them.  I recommend using Jif peanut butter, tastes the best & worked great for the recipe.  They didn't last long so I know I wasn't the only one who liked them!

I make these every year but the recipe needs a bit of tweaking, first start with 4 cups confectioners sugar, then add more as needed some days more seems to be needed and sometimes less is needed, if the dough is real sticky then add more but you don't want the dough to be too dry because then they won't hold their shape well and tend to fall apart, add parafin to the chocolate it gives it a better shine and holds better, if you don't they get soft fast, I also love to make these using Butterscotch chips, or peanut butter chips, I always have all threee on hand every christmas. It just wouldn't be Christmas without all three varieties of Buckeyes.

MMM...being from Ohio originally, I grew up with these things! If not from Ohio, I think they are most commonly referred to as 'peanut butter balls'. Whatever, they will always be buckeyes to me! :)    These are super sweet and divine- I use dark chocolate disks because I love dark chocolate, and I don't have a double broiler, I just melt the chocolate in a small pan or microwave it. When the chocolate gets too cool, I re-heat it. Also, make sure the peanut butter balls are FULLY refrigerated/cold. I had a few times in which the peanut butter balls would just slide off the toothpick if not. These are one of those treats that I just can't stop eating or thinking about once they are made.   Enjoy!!

My boyfriend and family are from the buckeye state.  I decided to make these for him on Valentine's Day and he said that they rivaled his Grandma's buckeyes - a real compliment since I know what a great cook they said she was.  I'm making them as favors for his sister's wedding rehearsal dinner next week!  I used the recipe just as is - all the tips about freezing the balls for better coating are correct.  Would love some info on how to keep the balls from melting at room temperature...Thanks all!

Another way to get the chocolate to stick to the peanut butter balls is to add a half of a square of parafin wax to the melting chocolate.  Works perfect everytime!

This recipe calls for way too much sugar which makes the texture too dry and crumbly instead of smooth and creamy. The peanut butter taste was almost not there. I kept re-checking the recipe thinking I made a mistake with the amount of sugar it called for.   I'm not sure how to get the smooth and creamy texture like the buckeyes I've had before, but I'm thinking maybe use some shortening and reduce the amount of sugar. Anyways, I'll be trying out another buckeye recipe.   I made some into "snowballs" using white chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet choc. chips and they turned out very tasty. Make sure to add shortening to the white choc chips when melting them.

I made these with help of other review tips and my whole family loves them.  you definitely cannot just eat one.  Be sure to have milk on hand to wash it down while eating, it helps with the sweetness.

Loved it!  The flavor was great - everyone says they taste like reese's pieces.  The only issue I had was the thickness of the chocolate - definitely made it harder to dip.  Other recipes typically have shortening, so I will add that next time.  Definitely a must to chill the balls before dipping!

I too only used 4 cups of sugar. Before I rolled them into balls I put them in the frig for about 15 minutes. It was great

My cousin told me to add some Rice Krispies to the recipe, about a cup or so, and it gives them a little extra crunch! Deliciooo!

These are excellent! I alter the powdered sugar a bit and I alternate between semi-sweet and milk chocolate. I followed the other user's advice and use the ice cream scoop to hold the chocolate. My family LOVES these!! Thanks!

These are delicious as is! But they are even better with milk chocolate (not a fan of dark) I melted a big Cadbury bar and dipped them in that...they disappeared before I even got one! :-( Thanks for the great recipe!

My husband and daughter LOVED THEM!!!  As for myself, I am odd, I do not like many peanut butter and chocolate things. If I did, they would be great!!  My Husband and daughter Highly Recommend this recipe.

My mom made these every year since I was a little girl.  My sisters and I have cont'd her tradition so it's been in our family for over 30 years so far.  Adding Paraffin (Gulf canning wax) to the chocolate (1/2 stick to 3/4 to bag o chocolate) allows the chocolate to set up faster and stick to the peanut butter.  Keep the chocolate temperate just warm enough to stay melted but not too hot to avoid runniness.  Since the paraffin does thin the chocolate a bit,  I make sure to triple dip.

tastes really good. Must keep refrigerated as the filling gets too soft. We added more powdered sugar, will need to up to more sugar next time.

These were... okay.  I was a little disappointed.  I probably did something because I halved the recipe and it didn't come out right... still not the best I've ever tasted.

It turned out OK!! I maded the recipe exactly the why it said to and the dough liked like bread crumbs. It was too dry! It would not even stick together in a ball. And it did not taste like what I remember. All I and my husband could taste was sugar and chocolate. But, I will try it one more time with less sugar.

I have been making these buckeyes for about 8 or 9 years, due to my nephew wanting some made at the time for a Valentine's Day party at school back then...These turned out awesome, especially for my very first try, I impressed myself!! I normally make 2 to 3 batches of these buckeyes in the fall and around Christmas each year...
I use a small crock pot/slow cooker to melt the chocolate in, an older lady that worked at a bakery thrift store years ago gave me that idea...I use the "keep warm" temperature on the crock pot once I get the chocolate wafers melted on "LOW" heat & frequent stirring...I normally purchase the "dark chocolate" melting wafers from a local craft store to use for this recipe, the kind that you use to make "shaped" chocolates, the local craft stores by me also carry the molds for the chocolate melting wafers I get as well...Everybody absolutely loves 'em & can never tell that it was chocolate wafers from a craft store!! I typically freeze the peanut butter balls, for up to 10 or 15 minutes prior to dipping them in the chocolate, otherwise I'll loose some in the chocolate as I'm dipping them with the toothpicks...

These are great, albeit a pain in the arse to make.  I usually use 4-5 cups of confectioners sugar, 2 cups of peanut butter, and add a little bit of paraffin wax to my chocolate to make it shiny.  I usually make these at Christmastime only, but my best friend is getting married this weekend... and the bride gets what the bride wants!!  :)

This is my favorite recipe, I've used this for a few years now, and always make these for Christmas. I get so many requests to make them, and have to make special packages for people who just love them! I usually have to double the recipe to make enough for everyone. I also usually end up using more chocolate than in the recipe, so I just buy a few bags of chocolate chips and use however much I need until I'm done coating them all. yum!

I followed the recipe exactly.  I used reduced fat creamy peanut butter without realizing it wasn't the regular creamy peanut butter but it turned out FABULOUSLY!!! It was SO easy to eat up.  It did not taste too rich, just right.  But that's probably because I have sweet TEETH.  I am tempted to make another batch even though the holidays are over with.  Awesome! I shared this recipe with a few others already.

I added an extra cup of peanut butter (2 1/2 cups total) for a more peanutty flavor.  Otherwise, enjoyed this recipe and will use again.

My friend made these for us yesterday and they were AMAZING!!! I've never had them before. Just a little note - instead of using creamy peanut butter, she used crunchy peanut butter. She also added some rice crispies to give them a little crunch!

A quick easy recipe. I added a bit of oil to the chocolate to thin it out so I would't get as thick of a coating on the balls.

Very GOOD! I sued a homemade double boiler and worked fine - just boiled water in a pan and then put another pan over the boiling water - workd great.  Next time I make these, I am going to use half semisweet choc. chips and half milk choc. chips and mix them -- I think it will give it just the right taste for me.

I love this candy. Instead of using the 4 cups of chocolate chips I just melted choclate almond bark and dipped the peanut butter balls in it.It came out beautifully.

Delicious yet extremely rich recipe. You may cut down on the sugar if you'd rather them be less rich.

These are great!  I served these without the chocolate at my bunco party.  I had a chocolate fondue fountain running and guests dipped them in the fountain!  YUMMY!!!  I think I gained a few pounds that week but it was well worth it!

I made this for a large group of people that I met for the first time and everyone RAVED about them.  Like many of the other readers, I doubled the batch and adjusted the recipe to less sugar and more peanut butter.  I got frustrated with the dipping part - I've never really dipped in chocolate before.  *** make sure when you melt it in the microwave you check it every 5 to 10 seconds **** it was easier to dip when I only took 5 balls out of the freezer at a time to dip ****  Next time I will use strong toothpicks since the PB balls stick in the chocolate. **** Also, to get rid of the holes, just lightly pat it with wax paper to blend it away. *** Yum!  Taste great frozen! :o

Everyone at our Football party loved these.  They take a long time to make - rolling out the balls, melting the chocolate, and then dipping.  It took one person about 2 hours to make them - not including the 2 hour time in the fridge to set.

Good But very Sweet. I'd use about a half cup less sugar. People at our house loved them and took a bunch home.  They also didn't turn out looking like buckeyes as in the picture

Yummy! Loved the peanut butter center!! It was so creamy and reminded me of a meltaway. The dipping in chocolate was little time consuming and messy, but it was worth it!

I originally saw this recipie in the local paper here about four years ago.  I'm not a big baker and thought this would be easy enough to make.  It is and everyone loves them.  In addition to the chocolate chips, I also use white chocolate and mint chocolate chips for something a bit different.

This recipes is the way I make my buckeyes... and it so simple and yummy...I was born and raised in OH..and it is a popular thing there... (being the buckeyes)only thing i change is: I use the canning wax to harden the chocolate a bit and I used both semi sweet and milk chocolate mixed...(I am not a big fan of dark chocolate) So you get my vote Tammy!!! (From a true buckeye) :o)

These are perfect if you use only four cups of powder sugar.  Also, I used half semi-sweet and half milk chocolate, which was pretty good.

Wow.  Fattening!  Make sure you have a big glass of milk when consuming these.  Very good.  Everyone loved them.  I think next time I will increase the peanut butter and decrease the sugar by a small amount to cut the sweetness a little bit.

I agree that this recipe is not as easy to do as it sounds. I made them once as directed and found them to be way too sugary and the chocolate coating too thick. I just made them again using more peanut butter and less sugar and still found the batter to be not as creamy as I'd have like it. But I did find adding a 1/2 cup milk to the chocolate makes it much easier to dip the balls.

Simply amazing recipe with wonderful results!  I have neighbors who love peanut butter and I used this recipe as an experiment.  Needless to say, they were enthralled!  Thanks Tammy!  This is the one and only Buckeye Recipe!!!  I was born in raised in Ohio (Buckeye Country) and had many buckeyes in my day.  This is the BEST by far!

This was not as easy as I expected.  The peanut butter balls need to stay in the freezer longer than the recipe says.  If they aren't really frozen, they begin to get soft and are hard to dip in the chocolate.  They are REALLY SUGARY!

Quite good, and I would make these again,
but I would make them smaller than the 
suggested size.  Also, my chocolate had
to be remelted as it took me to long to
dip.  I would also add some graham cracker
crumbs to the peanut butter mixture as this
seems to add some depth to the flavor.

Made this 3x this Christmas. Makes a ton and they were a huge hit! Use a double boiler for your chocolate! I used Choc chips from Aldi (a whole bag..and 2 squares (1in x1in of Choc bark)and made a double boiler using 1 metal pot and a metal bowl. I used my food processor the second time and had to do it in stages with the peanut butter mixture then do one big blend but it worked out good. A few extra steps... but worth it! First few batches I scraped the choc off the bottom. 3 one I just let it puddle at the bottom and my kids liked it better. NEW FAMILY FAVORITE

This is just like Mom’s recipe.  Buckeyes should be firm at room temperature and all of the powdered sugar is necessary for a traditional recipe.  I made them in a food processor and added the sugar slowly.....no problems. The mix is a bit crumbly but they roll up into a ball with no problem.  If you follow the recipe you will not encounter a sticky mess when rolling the balls. I didn’t refrigerate the balls before dipping them.  I find it easiest to add the ball to the chocolate and then poke the ball with a toothpick to pull it out.

This recipe is nonsense - the ratios are completely wrong. If you try to make buckeyes this way you will get a white crumbly powder instead of a rich peanut butter base. Cut the powdered sugar and butter in half, double the peanut butter and vanilla, and you will get the right cookie.

I made this recipe as posted and give it 4 solid stars.  I would have given it 5 but they weren't as creamy as I have had.  BUT... for anyone saying the recipe is crumbly as listed, it certainly is.  The past recipe I used had me swearing off making buckeyes ever again.  Too sticky.  What a mess.  Anyway I was left after following these directions with a crumbly bowl of dough.  I thought I had messed it up but grabbed some in my hands and was AMAZED at how the balls rolled and formed.  Inserted the toothpicks and froze for 30 minutes and they dipped like a charm.  No sliding off the picks.  Impressed.

I prefer to call them Wolverines rather than Buckeyes but they are always wonderful!  use half semi sweet and half milk chocolate. Perfect balance!

I had trouble figuring out how to get the chocolate melted without a proper double boiler but I did manage to get them finished. My chocolate is kind of thicker but they are delicious. I will work on getting a db soon. Thank you for this amazing recipe .

Excellent recipe and fun to make with my daughter.  I note the video is accurate on adjustments... what kind of peanut butter are you using?   If a natural PB, you’ll use all called for sugar.  Generic?  Not likely.  I have made many times now... with husband grabbing something different than I would.  Easy to know when ready when it starts to make crumbles under blender.  Another way?  TASTE IT!    It should be creamy and sweet    Pliable in your hands. A true winner.  Dipping is tough, so move FAST.   I dip at sides and use a candy dipper as holes huge from toothpicks.  Do your thing, though.

There was none left! Everyone love them and requested the recipe while at the party. (I used to live in Ohio, but now I love in another state so people don't really know what these are.) 

Having the PB balls as cold as possible and the chocolate as warm as possible definitely made it easier. I melted the chocolate by having smaller pan with the chocolate in it sitting inside a bigger pan of boiling water, and this worked really well.

So good! Remind me of my grandma's! I took the advice of other reviewers and cut the sugar down to 4 cups and increased the peanut butter to 2 cups. I also melted the chocolate in a tiny bowl in the microwave and this worked really well for covering them. I will definitely make these again. Thank you for the recipe!

This was a pretty good recipe. I used just 5 cups of icing sugar and this turned out fine. They should come out of the freezer right before dipping and go in the frige or freezer right after. I also just melted the chocolate in the micorwave.

I loved this recipe, and it worked for me the best out of all recipes. I put the dough in the fridge for an hour before putting into balls.

Great recipe. When you are rolling the balls, it helps to use a small meatball scooper, and really pack the pb mixture into it. Then go back with wet hands (that you keep clean and wet) and make them into round balls. That way they are uniform. I prefer to completely submerge PB balls in chocolate, and I put a lollipop stick in them so they are not messy when eating. When making for kids, I prefer to use milk chocolate as they like it best. Thanks!

I will definitely make some changes when I make these again. In my opinion they are just too sweet, I would prefer more peanut butter and less powdered sugar. I noticed another reviewer posted a different ratio of these ingredients and I will probably give that a go. The concept of peanut butter balls dipped in chocolate is delish though.

This recipe is easy and tastes delicious. I've tried some recipes that are sickeningly sweet. This one is perfect, you can taste the peanut butter. I took some to work and they were a huge hit! Will definitely make more!

This is THE BEST recipe ever!!! This is what a buckeye should taste like!! The only thing I do differently is use milk chocolate wafers which melt very well , other recipes have too much peanut butter, not enough sugar. I am an Ohioan since birth!! This IS the one to use !! It’s perfect .. I make them every year, I have special requests for my Buckeyes all the time.

This was super yummy, the dough was hard to incorporate so I took softball sizes of the semi-incorporated dough and kneaded it until it was all mixed together. It took a little longer but it was well worth it! I added a little bit of coconut oil to the chocolate to thin it out a little bit and it worked wonderfully!!! Absolutely love this sweet little snack! Perfect for baked good baskets for the holidays!

As a first time baker, I found these easy to do. Of course they take time because you have to wait to put the chocolate on, but I would definitely make them again.

I also put a drizzle of chocolate over them so they looked really spiffy

These are really good! If you like Reeses PB cups,  you'll love these. I opted for 1 cup less sugar and 1/2 cup more PB per other reviews and it is still a bit to sweet for my taste. I will tweak it a little more next time and see how they turn out.

I made these for Thanksgiving along with my family's other favorite candy, potato candy. It was a hit, the kids absolutely loved them. I also used almond bark too for some of them. They got eaten before I snapped a photo. They are sweet. But it's candy, so you know...

Easy to make and looks good. Nice and creamy but it's almost like eating chocolate coated shortening.  I'd adjust the recipe using less butter.

The quantities were way off. I couldn't even form it into  balls, it was too dry and crumbly. You need less sugar and more peanut butter.

Great recipe. Sifting the powdered sugar will make them extra creamy. I added 1/2 C. of crunchy peanut butter also. Will make again and again:)

This recipe has way too much powdered sugar.  I made it again with only 4 cups instead of 6-MUCH better.  I also added a couple tablespoons of Crisco to the chocolate morsels.  This helped as well.

My granddaughters (ages 3 and 6) and I  had a lot of fun making these Buckeyes together.  They were delicious! I just melted the chocolate morsels a bit at a time in a glass measuring cup in the microwave. Remove the bowl of  morsels from the microwave before all of  the morsels have melted. Mix  with a spoon until they are all melted together.  
Note that these Buckeyes do need to be stored in the refrigerator.

Great recipe! Super easy. Just for funnsies I also made it with almond butter (1 1/2 c equates to about one 16 oz container) and carob chips. I now know that to melt carob chips you have to add oil. Make sure to beat the peanut butter (almond butter) mixture well. I don't have a fancy buckeye dipper, so I just  impale them with a toothpick before I let them chill in the freezer, and use the toothpick to assist in dipping (swirling for carob). After you dip them, let them set for a minute or two to let the peanut or almond butter mixture warm. This makes it easier to smooth over the toothpick holes. Then back to the refrigerator/freezer/outside winter 'freezer' to set up.

These are so delicious! I made them with my 3 year old granddaughter who loves to bake. We made them on a day when it was too hot to turn on the oven. She mixed the dough with her hands (I stirred a little bit now and then with a spoon). This is a recipe that a child can definitely help with. She pretty much did everything except melt the chocolate. Since there is no raw egg, it is fun to sample the dough too.

I personally thought they were too sweet and would add less powdered sugar next time. However, I made these for my brother who lived in Ohio for a bit and fell in love with them. He loved them despite their over the top sweetness. 
Next time I would definately reduce the powdered sugar by about a cup. I wasn't getting enough peanut butter flavor.

I also adjusted the cups of sugar to 4, pb to 2. However I used natural pb, which needed an additional cup of sugar on the second batch. Otherwise, great recipe.

I halved the recipe, it made 28 buckeyes, more than enough for just me and my daughter to snack on a few days. Easy too, I didn't have chocolate chips so I used another recipe for making melted chocolate with cocoa powder and cut that in half as well.

This recipe is delicious, easy and make a LOT.  Rather than using the chocolate chips; I used chocolate disks (Wilton Milk Chocolate Melts) and melted them in the microwave.

So sad this is the first result on google for me. This calls for WAY too much sugar. go with 4 cups and add from there if needed. Up the pb to 2 cups too. While these are still good using the directions above, they're SUPER rich, hard to roll into balls and don't have the normal color. Also, I used candy chocolate instead. Very good flavor with that

Awesome flavor.  Had a little trouble keeping the Buckeyes from  sliding off the toothpick.  Definitely would make these again.  Family loved them.

I wush I would have read the reviews first...I used the 6 cups confectioner's sugar....way too much! The peanut butter looks too pale and it's a bit crumbly for making balls. Definately cut down on the sugar!!

This recipe calls for too much powdered sugar. Six cups is way too much for 1 1/2 cups peanut butter. It also has you mix everything at once rather than creaming the butter and peanut butter first.  Buckeyes were too dry and crumbly. The Jiff recipe is much better.

Yummy! I didn't have any problems with this recipe. Melted the chocolate in the microwave, stirring frequently. I did follow reviewer advice and use an ice cream scoop to dip the balls in order to get better chocolate coverage. Also, make sure they're frozen and chocolate is hot. Delicious!

I made 1/2 a batch with the same proportions as called for on this recipe.  (3/4 c PB, 1/2 c Butter, 1/4 tsp Vanilla, 3 c Confectioners and 12 oz bag of semi-sweet choc chips).  They came out wonderful by following author's recipe.  I creamed everything and then added a full 3 cups of confectioner's a little at a time without sifting.  The warmth of my hands melded the ingredients together to make the balls though the dough was dry prior to making balls.  No extra freeze time was needed and I didn't have to coat my hands with extra sugar.  
I've never made these on my own before this attempt but I've sampled quite a few--but I thought this was great recipe.  Thanks!

I followed the recipe and made 60 out of a very dry dough. Needed to buy more chocolate for dipping and it took 2 hrs. I have to question if the portions are correct. Next time will probably use 4 cups sifted confectioners sugar instead of 6 and see if that helps.

So I cut this recipe down to half (but otherwise did as is) since I wasn't sure how my hubby would like it (he's a PB treat snob, lol).  Sure enough, he wasn't too crazy about it.  They are very, very sweet.  I thought they were ok, but think that the ratio of sugar to peanut butter is too drastic.  More like powdered sugar balls with a bit of PB.  If I try these again I will be playing with those amounts.  My 5 year old only ate one, but did say it was good.  I brought the rest to work and they liked them quite a bit and ate the rest.

Good buckeyes, but I would cut the amount of confectioner's sugar to about 4 cups and perhaps add a bit more peanut butter. When I bite into these, the flavor is mostly confectioner's sugar and little PB.

This is a very good recipe my mom showed me how to make when I was six yrs old. Now I'm thirty two and I still make them but with a twist. Sometimes I had cinnamon to the peanut butter. Or last year I thought to myself what would taste good inside the  peanut butter buckeye, Carmel. Make your balls place freezer 15 to 20 minutes, remove I use a straw from McDonald's insert it halfway into the ball place my Finger over the opposite end of straw (which allows a suction force) remove straw pulling straight up. There's your hole for your carmel. I buy the square little carmel they seem to melt better and set better than any other ones I've tried. Fill it, you can cover it or leave it open and dip in chocolate.  Me I cover the hole to surprise people not expecting it.  I live in South Dakota, from Ohio believe it or not nobody out here even knows what BUCKEYES  our. Go Bucks

I made these for Thanksgiving in DC, since they don't get Buckeyes here. I read a lot of reviews, but chose to make exactly as recipe says. Would not change a single thing!! The recommendation to keep frozen until you are ready to dip was an excellent suggestion, as it is more difficult when they start to sweat. If you use the double boiler, it keeps the chocolate hot the whole time and isn't any messier than microwave. Will be saving this one and using a lot more.

I had made these for years using a different recipe (which was always very messy).  I tried this one, using suggestions from others, and they were the easiest ever.  I used 2 cups of peanut butter and 4 cups of sifted confectioners sugar.  Perfect.  Using a small ice cream scoop, I produced 61 peanut butter balls.  The suggestion to use conf. sugar on hands to avoid dough sticking was right on.  Thank you Tammy.  4 stars instead of 5 because I did not entirely follow recipe.

Used 2 cups of peanut butter and 5 cups of confectionery  sugar.  They turned out very creamy.   Everyone wants to make them.

Turned out great! I only added 4 cups sugar. I The balls formed up really easily. Their texture was super creamy and smoothe. I used my kitchen aid mixer to blend everything and if kept on low it wasn't too much.

Buckeyes are a fan favorite and are perfect for your fall tailgate parties. They are sure to defeat a bad case of the wolverines. Buckeyes also go well with the sugar bowl, orange bowl, fiesta bowl, and orange bowl.

I've made these dozens of times and they're always a huge hit! A few tips...After everything is nicely mixed form it into two or three large ball and refrigerate it for at least one hour. This will chill it and make it easier to work with. Take one ball out at a time and make a long log (size and length of a hot dog...thicker and longer depending how big you want your balls to be ;) ). Then cut the "hot dog" into the ball sizes you want and roll them out. This is a quick way to finish them up. (Instead of making one ball at a time..) 

This is a difficult treat to make during warmer months...unless you have air conditioning and aren't transporting them outside of it! ;) It can be done but soften when too warm...

ENJOY!!!

Delicious - just like Grandma used to make.  Have to make them peanut free due to an allergy in the house - not as good as real PB, but fulfills my annual holiday buckeye craving.  To make them safe for peanut allergy suffers - use sunflower seed butter (sunbutter brand is peanut free) instead of peanut butter and hershey meltable wafers (many chocolate chips/wafers are cross contaminated with peanuts but in my area hershey chips and wafers are safe - always double check labels as manufacturing varies by location).  The wafers melt nicely in the microwave, reduce power and stir every minute or so until melted.

Excellent cookies. If you add a bit of paraffin wax to the chocolate it is easier to dip.

Great recipe but add some chocolate bark for dipping to chips and it makes the buckeyes harden faster.  Another thing to try, I use white chocolate too!

These things just didn't work out. It tasted like I was eating gross raw peanut butter cookie dough with bitter chocolate. Definitely use ONLY 4 CUPS OF CONFECTIONER'S SUGAR! 4 cups was almost too sweet, I cannot imagine 6. But all in all, I was disappointed.

Great recipe. The only thing I do different is, I use Mercken's milk chocolate candy melts instead of the chocolate chips. Melt the milk chocolate in the microwave. So easy and delicious.

so good!! and the toothpick trick works really well (but you don't have to put a toothpick in each one; just wait until after they freeze and then just use one or two toothpicks). Very easy, but a little time consuming. Definitely worth it though!

Way too much sugar!! I love buckeyes and had not made them in a long time and they look beautiful, but man you get a toothache from the amount of sugar! Although if you like fudge this recipe may be for you.  I read another review saying the same thing but I like to follow the recipe as given the first time. If you love super sweet stuff this recipe is for you - if not at a very minimum the sugar has to be much less. I can't say for sure how much since the ratio of dry to liquid/solid would be thrown off. I found that I didn't really need to put a toothpick in each I just used a shallow bowl and used tongs to hold them while covering the bottoms of the buckeyes. Oh yeah, you actually need the heat from your hands to roll the balls or they will just fall apart - I squeezed them at least 3-5 times before starting to roll them into a ball and they rolled very smoothly after that. Also it is VERY hands on....I am not sure I will eat these made by someone else again...LOL

we use a weight watchers scale and measure out the peanut butter at about 10 - 12 grams each as we roll them.  also, for those having problems with it sticking to the hands, use a bit of powdered sugar on the hands/fingers.  I have used white, chocolate, and butter scotch almond bark for dipping.  a person could also put some coconut in the peanut butter mix for a change.

We were wondering if anyone has tried to use SPLENDA instead of powdered sugar? for a sugar free variety?

this is a very easy treat.

I used Skippy PB with honey in it.  Very yummy.  I found the recipe to be a bit dry when I cut it in half.  My version had 1/2 more PB than the written one here, for a total of 2 cups PB.

Awesome recipe! Easy to make and tastes wonderful! I took this to a work event and received tons of compliments. I gave it four stars instead of five because it took about 30-45 minutes just to roll the balls of peanut butter because they kept breaking apart on me. I ended up warming up the peanut butter mixture in the microwave for a few seconds and that seemed to help. Overall, yummy!

This is a great, simple and delicious recipe! Thank you so much for sharing! There are only a couple of things I did differently, per my taste... I used 2 cups of peanut butter and 5 cups of powdered sugar, they are very very sweet! 
You MUST dip the balls in the chocolate while the chocolate is still HOT and the balls still COLD, otherwise it does not stick properly together. I kept my peanut butter balls in the freezer and would take one out at a time dip it, and then put them right in the fridge. That way they don't get warm. This worked out great.
This is a must have, must share, 5 star recipe!

I love these!! I made these for my sisters family who have a gluten allergy. These were perfect because they have no gluten in them. If you are a peanut butter and chocolate lover - you have to try these!!

These turned out fantastic.  Super-easy, and they're really yummy (and addictive!).  I will say, I used chocolate bark rather than the chocolate chips listed in the recipe, mostly b/c I had the bark, and I didn't have enough choc. chips available.  Still turned out great.

flavor is awesome.  something about the texture of the peanut butter i'm a bit unsure about.  maybe try with Rice Krispies next time?    used only 2-3 cups of powdered sugar because it seemed like it was getting too sweet to me.  but then the peanut butter was too sticky, so added flour until it was dry enough to roll into balls.  only used about 1/2 cup butter.

Great recipe! Easy to follow and end result is delicious! I agree to only use about 4 cups of sugar and melt the chocolate in the microwave, its much faster, just remember to stir often.

We love these.  They are a must for football season. I've made them with a half splenda half powdered sugar and it tasted fine, but the texture was off.  I also made them with just 4 cups powdered sugar and it worked well.  I did use the tip of putting the mixture in the fridge for 30 minutes before making balls.  It helps to solidify it and makes it easier for rolling balls.

I really like candies like Reese's, but I didn't really like these. Everyone else liked them though. I also found that the peanut butter "dough" came out too dry and was really difficult to roll into balls, so I ended up compressing them into cylinder shapes. I also noticed that there was a TON of leftover frozen chocolate. Maybe this should be adjusted a little?

These were very cute!  I got distracted in the middle of making them, and must have mixed some steps up, because when I tried to roll the balls, 1. I made the balls to big, and 2. they just wanted to crumble.  I will try again!

this is a great recipe. The hardest part is melting the chocolate and not letting it get gritty. But the end results are delicious. I have been told that i should sell them!! I always double the recipe and they never last. Another thing that makes them even better is use Milk Chocolate instead of semi, EVEN BETTER!!!

These are sweet, creamy and so yummy!  I would like a little more texture in the peanut butter mixutre though.  I wonder if it's okay to use Adam's natural PB...?  I was afraid to use it because of all the oil, so I used Jiff.  Also, I added only about 4 1/2 cups sugar; it was sweet enough.

This was just like the one that my mother used to make when we were kids, loved it and so did everyone I made them for. Thanks again for the great recipe.

These are easy and my kids love them, unfortunately they are too sweet for me to eat more than 1. But this is still a very good recipe

This is my first time making these.  They are delicous!  I did use a bit less sugar.  I also used a fondue pot with the melting chocolate for dipping and it was very easy and firmed up awesome!

Yum! I think if you don't use all the powdered sugar you will certainly have a messier time rolling the dough.  I used the stated amount and had zero problems.  I do however think that less sugar and more peanut butter would probably taste better and more like a peanut butter cup, but would undoubtedly be very messy!  Thanks a ton! I only made half the batch and froze the other half of the dough for closer to xmas baking and making!

I just made these and they taste great.  I cannot stress enough how right the reviewer was that said it is important to make sure your peanut butter balls are VERY cold and your chocolate VERY hot.  It makes all the difference in the world in ease and appearance.  Also, I did half of mine with a double boiler and half with my "Little Dipper" mini crock-pot --WOW!!  I will be using the Little Dipper for all my future chocolate dipping needs!  It is perfect for the job!

this recipe is great but i would change a few things....first of all, crunchy peanut butter is a must. it adds texture and keeps your mouth watering. second, norwegian peanut butter is the best i have found yet. so if you're in norway, give it a try! also, the darker the chocolate the better---it contrasts to the sweetness and gives it a much more authentic look. last, and most important, use colored toothpicks while dipping and be sure to wear a hair net---we've had some bad experiences with this! good luck allesammen!

Was a fav among the co-workers and kiddies. Have to admit I had a problem dipping the peanut butter balls in the chocolate as they kepts falling off the tooth picks, so mine were a little messy, but just as good to eat! Thank you :)

I have been wanting to get this recipe since I had these several years ago at my friends house in Pittsburgh.  Love them!!! Except, I wanted to taste more peanut butter so I added only 5 cups of the confectioners sugar and I love nuts so I used crunchy peanut butter instead of creamy.

It tasted ok to me. My daughter loved it. I have made it twice and it is too much sugar. The sugar was very gritty and even the second I decreased the sugar. Not what I was hoping for.

I used lowfat peanut butter (b/c it is what I had in the pantry) and the mixture was too dry.  They turned out well after I added some regular peanut butter and extra melted butter.  Next time I will use all regular peanut butter.

So good, I had to give the majority away for fear of eating them all myself! The only trouble I had was with the technique of getting the chocolate to look nice. Some of them were pretty interesting looking. Definitely need to keep the pb balls frozen, as soon as they start to get condensation on them the chocolate would not stick well. Will keep and make every year!

These were great. I remember having these at Christmas time when I was a kid growing up in Ohio. 
Here are the changes I made after reading all the reviews:
Used 2 cups of peanut butter;
Used 4 cups of confectioner sugar;
Used 1/2 semi-sweet and 1/2 milk chocolate chips with a 1/2 block of paraffin wax and melted it all in a small crockpot on low. I don't think the milk chocolate made them too sweet but I have a sweet tooth. 
Crockpot keeps the chocolate hot while you are returning to the freezer (it was a lot of back and forth for me). They will fall off the toothpick if they aren't frozen and then you will have a mess.

I have been making this for years. Now my oldest is old enough to roll out the balls. My original recipe calls for melting chocolate and paraffin wax, and now instead of just chocolate I buy Almond Bark chocolate candy coating and use that. Perfect!

I recently discovered this recipe in a book that I got.  I had never heard of them but my husband loves chocolate and Peanut Butter so I knew it would be perfect.  I was having trouble dipping them like the book said so I ended up putting them on the wax paper and spooning the choclate over them---they turned out delicous but not as pretty.  I never thought to refrigerate the dough or freeze it so I will definetly try that when I make them again very soon!

I am giving this 5 stars because everyone is raving about them! My husband said it nails reese's recipe. I don't eat peanut butter, but everyone who does sure loves these! Thanks for the great recipe - by the way this made around 60 buckeyes!

This recipe did not have the intense peanut butter flavor I am used to and was way too sugary.  However, freezing them made them much easier to dip without loosing the toothpick.  I also added a bit of oil to my chocolate chips to make the dip a bit more liquid.

This is a great recipe and not to hard, but I would suggest a few changes. You may need to chill the peaunt butter mixture around 30 minutes, and you will not need to use all of the chocolate. Trust me if you use 4 cups of chocolate chips you will waste a lot. It is also easier to use the mirowave instead of a double boiler. Finally do not make the buckeyes too big because they are very rich. Good luck!

I made these last Christmas, (forgot to review) 

WAY too much butter.  They were decent, we ate them, but the butter taste was too much. I even made more with less butter.  It either needs less butter or you need to double everything else, but the butter.

Yummy! I cut down on the sugar a bit like other reviewers and thought that these were sweet enough. I didn't have toothpicks so instead of dipping, I swirled the melted chocolate on top... I guess I made reverse buckeyes. I used freshly made peanut butter. Very easy and healthier than store-bought peanut butter candies. Thank you!

This was a great recipe for Buckeyes, I have had them at Cracker Barrelresturants and these are no match, they are way better than Cracker Barrel. I took them to a baby shower and they went flying off the platter and I had to stop my family from eating them, but rest assure I will make them for the family. This recipe is a keeper. I did not change a thing on the recipe and yes I did put some oil in the chocolate which made it much easier to dip the putter butter balls.

I've had this recipe saved for months & happened upon it yesterday.  I've never made these before but, boy oh boy were they yummy!  My whole family LOVES chocolate & peanut butter combinations - these are a keeper.  Even my husband said he's tried them elsewhere but they were dry & crumbly.  He told me I NEED to keep this recipe. Very easy & not too time consuming.

YUM!  These are so good home-made. I tried my first Buckeye from a store and I wasn't that into them.  These taste so much better.  I stopped adding the powdered sugar at 5 cups because it was really stiff, so I think you just have to add between 4-6 cups until it's very firm.  I added shortening to the chocolate and it set up really fast.  Next time I would like a stronger peanut butter taste so I'll try more than 1 1/2 cups.

Perfect the way it is! Sweet, but not too sweet, in my opinion. Because they're small, I think they *can* be a little sweeter. Very good. Everyone loved them at Christmas.

These were great! I went with the 4 cups of powdered sugar like others suggested. Also, since my husband and in-laws are HUGE LSU fans, I couldn't make them look like buckeyes (since the playoffs are coming up and all). So I drizzled the remaining chocolate on top of the dipped balls and voila! My bro-in-law couldn't quit eating them!

Very good recipe.  I cut back a little on the sugar to about 4 cups.  I also added one-eighth cake of paraffin to the chocolate chips to make the coating a little firmer and smoother.

I loved this recipe! Peanut butter and chocolate is a great combination and they looked so pretty they attracted a lot of attention at my office potluck.  I used 5 cups of sugar because that was all I had and they tasted great. Very sweet.  The dough was dry and easy to roll into balls. It did not stick to my fingers.

I agree.  This recipe needs tweaking.  More peanut butter, less sugar.  And the chocolate coating.  Talking about difficult.  I used real dark baker's chocolate, and it was so thick and hard to cover the buckeyes.  I tried to thin it with water and my chocolate "seized" and was worthless (I didn't realize that adding moisture to melted chocolate caused it to seize - whoops!)  I was pulling my hair out!  But hey, the end result did taste yummy - rich, but yummy.

Made these per the suggestions in the reviews but I only made half of the amount.  My boyfriend thought they were awesome.  I've never had them before but I thought they were pretty good.  Easy to make.  Just didn't know how to get rid of the toothpick hole in the buckeyes once I dipped them.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

These turned out good...used 2 c. peanut butter and 4 c. confectioner sugar as recommended by previous readers and it turned out fine.  Nice texture, almost fluffy.  A little greasy for my taste, but the husband loved.  Covered with white choc. as that is his favorite, a little hard to dip and hard to keep cool enough to prevent them melting into the chocolate while dipping...maybe needs something to firm them up a bit?  Overall good!

Wow!  These are great!  I also took others advice and cut the sugar down.  I put in 5 cups and it was perfect!  My husband grew up having his grandmother (who is from Ohio) make these for him.  He LOVED these!  Thank you for a sweet treat!

update- new twist- this year I made them using a natural peanut butter.  I ended up using the full amount of sugar just to make sure the peanut oil wouldn't make a mess, I also used a tad less butter. Funny thing is even with no added sugar in the peanut butter these are super sweet.  One more thing is I used a good milk chocolate that I knew would set up nicely (w/out wax).  Through the years I have learned I much prefer the creaminess of the milk chocolate over the bite of the semi-sweet in this little treat.  This year I'm getting to make them with my daughter and son, everyone is enjoying that.

Just made these and they are wonderful.  When I was young I made these with my mother and her recipe called for paraffin wax.  Anyway, these do taste different but are still good, I do plan on cutting out a cup or so of sugar in the future; also I used a mix of milk and semi-sweet chocolates for dipping.

I have a recipe for Buckeyes, but will not use it again! The peanut centers are much more creamier will the extra amounts of ingredients. The only thing I did differently was roll them smaller & got almost 200 out of this recipe. My kids (& husband's coworkers!) always love these, but even more so now
