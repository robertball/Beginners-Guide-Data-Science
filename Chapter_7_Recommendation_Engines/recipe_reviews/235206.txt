This is a very tasty soup..after it sat in the fridge overnight. It tasted a lot like  just the juice when I tasted it right after cooking, so do let this sit overnight for best flavor if you can. One hour on high did not even warm this soup up for me so I set the crockpot for 3 hours on low and that did the trick One last thing.. this makes a LOT more than 6 servings..be ready

I thought the spices overwhelmed the soup. It did taste better after being in the refrigerator.

Good, has some spice to it from the V8. But it does taste better after it sits in the refrigerator overnight

This "soup" basically tasted like seasoned V8 juice. It needs more to it, like brown rice or lots of cheese and sour cream.  It's pretty blah...  And because it makes SO MUCH, cooking it on low for 5+ hours worked best.
