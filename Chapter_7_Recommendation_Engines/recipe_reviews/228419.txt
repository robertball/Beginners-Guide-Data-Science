This recipe was really great! I added ground beef to it. I cooked the ground beef and onion together. I then added the cream of chicken soup and sour cream to that mix. I also added a little garlic salt and pepper. Then I mixed that mixture and the butternut squash together in a casserole dish. I prepared the stuffing mixture alone. Then I mixed in half of the stuffing in the casserole mixed, and then topped with the rest of the stuffing. I baked for 25 minutes at 350. It was delicious! And adding the ground beef turned it into a complete meal. Yummy!

I made the recipe last night exactly as written and loved it! Even the hubby, who has no love for anything that even looks like a casserole, thought it was good! For the stuffing mix, I used Stove Top (for chicken) and thought it gave just the right amount of seasoning. The only error I made was making the cubes of squash a little too large so it took about 10 minutes more of baking to cook them through. Next time, I will cut then into smaller, more bite sized cubes. I served this as a side dish to some baked chicken.

I got some butternut squash in my bountiful basket and have never cooked with it before.  This recipe was simple and extremely tasty.  I added some shredded white cheddar on the top and it was very good.  I will definately be making it again.  Thank you for the recipe!

Made as written other than using a 8" x 8" extra deep baking dish. In step 2, at least double the time for simmering the squash to get it slightly softened as 3 minutes isnâ€™t sufficient. If not sufficiently softened, the bake time is extended with the risk of the casserole not being as moist as it could be. Using the deeper baking dish caused the cooking time to be extended to about 50 minutes (increased temp to 375 degrees during last 25 minutes). A definite make again as everyone luved this very tasty side dish. Thank you apz2002.

This is the first time I am rating a recipe and the reason - because hubs never eats casserole and doesn't like squash but went back to this for second and thirds!  I am not giving it 5 stars only because I made some changes.  I didn't use butter or shredded carrots.  I added a bit more finely chopped onion.  I also added finely chopped portabella mushrooms and lastly, I shredded some good cheddar cheese.  I just mixed everything up in a bowl (after steaming the squash) and put it in a baking dish, sprinkled more stuffing on top and threw it in the oven!  So easy! Oh I used Pepperidge Farm Herb Seasoned stuffing in the blue bag.  Thanks for the great casserole idea!

I loved this recipe. The only thing different I would do next time is not put extra stuffing mix on top (it was too dry when reheating).

This is a very good recipe! I made it for our Thanksgiving dinner and had a lot of complements. The combination of squash, onions & carrots with savory stuffing created a wonderful taste treat. The only change I made was substituting parsnips for carrots. In the future I will add a little chicken broth to make it a little creamer. Will definitely make again.

I won't make it again.  I used a little less butter and low fat sour cream and soup.

I loved this recipe, however I did make a couple recommended adaptations. I added frozen, pre-cooked diced chicken breast and extended the baking time to an hour. Delicious.

Made this a complete meal by adding cooked cubed chicken to it. Great taste. Tasted like Thanksgiving in a casserole dish! Did increase the temperature to 375 and baked for 50 minutes.

I made a few adjustments. My boyfriend is very finicky and wouldn't eat something like this without some kind of meat in it, so I added chicken and also topped it with sharp cheddar cheese in the last few minutes of baking. I made my own stuffing mix from scratch as I didn't have any stovetop and also had to improvise on some spices. It turned out great! Very filling and full of flavor.

I thought this casserole was fine, but I'm giving the recipe only 3 stars because my family really hates this dish. They didn't like the combination of flavors (particularly the sour cream combined with the squash) and referred to it as the "never-ending squash casserole."

The flavors here did not combine well. The sweetness of the squash clashed with the saltiness of the stuffing. I found it jarring.
