I served this dip with fritos scoops to some picky guests, and everyone loved it! I added a heaping half teaspoon each of garlic salt and cumin after reading reviews about it being bland.  Instead of mexicorn I used frozen corn and chopped my own green and red bell pepper- half of each.  I also added some fresh cilantro in the mix and for garnish.  It turned out great and before I knew it the bowl was empty!

Unfortunately, this was not a biggie at my dinner party. It really didn't taste much like a dip. Sorry.

I absolutely loveee this recipe. I got it from my mom a few years ago and it's a hit at every party I bring it to. I add more jalapenos and an extra can of green chilies. Then serve it with Fritos Scoops potato chips!!!

Unique dip that is very good but not great.  Best served same day since it thickened up considerably next day.  Everyone who has eaten it has asked for recipe.

Absolutely delicious!!!!  It was incredibly easy to make.  Definitely cut back on the onions next time.  I didn't have any Mexican corn in the pantry so I used regular corn and added diced red bell peppers...PERFECT!

Made this for a party and it wasn't a huge hit.  Although I used fresh ingredients and a variety of breads, it just wasn't enough to give it any oomph!  My test for an appetizer...nothing left to take home but a dirty dish.

I made this for the first time and took to a family party.  My little grandson loved it and everyone else liked it too.  I added the heaping 1/2 teaspoon of garlic salt and cumin.  It still needed some flavoring so I added a dash of salt and some black pepper and that helped. Didn't think 8 ounces of sour cream was enough so I added 16 ounces to hold the dip together.  Would add one more pepper next time and a few more green onions.  Blended the pepper and onions in a food processor with a little water so they wouldn't be chuncky.

I only had two cans of Mexi-corn on hand so that's all I could add and because I was making this a hot dip, I used reduced fat cream cheese instead of mayonnaise. I didn't add the extra jalapeno pepper because I had small kids eating this dip so I omitted it. I threw all the ingredients for this into my small crockpot after breakfast and set it to cook until lunch time. We really liked this. Next time I make this, I might cut back on the sour cream just a bit and maybe add a little salsa. GREAT with tortilla chips. I've had this before cold but I think making it hot was just as good. Good quick dip for our weekend snack day made with on hand ingredients on the cheap.

Not really that good as written, good base.  I used one block cream cheese and skipped the mayo, placed in food processor, blend cheese and chilis and half of corn until chunky, place in bowl mix in remainder of corn and green onions.  I also added garlic, and cumin to mine.  Great with corn chips.

This is wonderful. Everywhere I take it I get many compliments and everyone wants the recipe and want me to bring it over and over.  I adjust the degree of spice ( peppers) for the crowd, depending on what most of them like hot or mild. 
Fantastic

I have made this a few times. It is always "good" but not "great". It is much better if you add 1 jalapeno for each can of corn. It definitely needed a little spice. 

I also add a healthy sprinkle of cayenne.

This is one that the family loves! A game day favorite. We change it up from time to time and add chopped olives and a little taco seasoning for a Mexi twist!

The original recipe was bland tasting.  My husband and I like things spicey, so I added 2 more jalapeno peppers, 2 cloves of minced garlic, sea salt to taste, and chopped cilantro to taste.  It was the extra kick that it needed.  Although my husband thought it tasted like a seafood dip that was missing the seafood, and one of our guests thought it had some sort of seafood in it!

Very good. Everyone like it on the 4th of July. I would add more green chilis next time. There was not enough to really tast them, however, the dip was very good!

Major keeper.  I did add twice the sour cream because it was a little thick and also added hot sauce to give it a little kick.  I'm curious if it would make a nice warm side dish.  I have to try that.

This was a pretty good dip.  The only thing I changed was leave out the jalapeno, only because I didn't have any.  Next time I would add it to add a little more zip to the dip.  Went over fairly well at a party I had.

This dip received all 5 stars because it tasted great, was sooo easy to make, was done in 10 minutes & garnered lots of compliments at the backyard bbqI took it to.  My boyfriend accidentally purchased the Southwest style corn (bless his heart, he tried), so there were black beans in it but they actually worked really well.  Other than that, I made the recipe exactly as written & served it with tortilla scoops.  Thanks for sharing - will be making again!

When I make this recipe, I spice things up a bit.  It tasted a little bland, so I added about two teaspoons of chili pepper, a few shakes of black pepper, some salt, a teaspoon or two of onion and garlic powder, and anything else that I thought looked interesting in the cabinet.  I just seasoned until it tasted how I wanted it to.  It was sooo good!!  I brought it to a church dinner and it went over very well.  Every one wanted the recipe.  It is even better when it sits in the fridge for a day.  Oh, and I added 12 ounces of cheddar cheese instead of 10.  And I also put less mayo and more sour cream.  Next time I am going to put no mayo and all sour cream.  I will just add a little sugar.  I don't like mayo, but most people do.  Great recipe!!

I have to admit that people were looking at it kind of weird. The ones who gave it a try loved it.  I myself loved it.  Threw in a little ground cumin for some extra flavor - everyone loved that part of it.  It's kind of creamy, sweet and savory at the same time - I love this salad.  I omitted the green onions and used 1 can of chopped jalapenos, and served it with Frito Scoops and Tostito Scoops.  I liked it with the fritos better.

I made this for a museum function attended by around 250 people ... it was the first time so I just made one recipe.  I stood by to watch the attendees reaction (without them knowing I'd made it) and it was a hit!  They oooh'ed & ahhh'ed - it was very gratifying!  Next time, I will at least double the recipe.  Thanks!

I loved this and had many compliments on it.  I used C&W Frozen corn and added some diced fresh green and red peppers.  Subbed lowfat sour cream and added some extra jalapeno, salt & pepper.  Will add extra diced mild green chilies next time...there WILL be a next time!  I served in a Hawaiian Bread bowl.  Great with corn chips and bagel chips too.

after reading the reviews, it sounded like people liked it but it was missing a little something.  so I added some cilantro and it was perfect.

I loved the idea of this recipe, but honestly totally changed it to fit what I had on hand.  Of course like most dips the mayo vs sour cream vs cream cheese ratio is really about personal preference and texture so I just used sour cream and kept the green onion, corn, and chiles as written.  I also added a can (poured most liquid out) of tomatoes with cilantro and lime which gave it such a fresh flavor. If I made it again, and I definitely will, I'll use fresh cilantro and squeeze a lime or two in these. I also added a couple shakes of garlic and onion powders and a couple cracks of pepper, great flavor without the heavy cumin of a taco mix. I had veggies and chips, but people preferred the veggies, especially pepper strips.  Huge hit and a little different from the usual dip.

Good.  But it's one of those recipes that I could only eat a few bites of and then I was decidedly done with it.

This dip is alright. Personally Im a salsa fan, but if you're really into corn you will love this. I cut this recipe in Half and found that even half of this recipe makes more than enough. It will feed us two for 3 days

Great and easy recipe!  Was a big hit at the office!  Only change I would make next time is to use a large mixing bowl and add salt.  No taco seasoning necessary.

Great recipe! For faster dip I use one package cream cheese, 2 cans mexican-style corn, 1 can Rotel, and a can of chopped Jalapenos. Every gathering I take it to someone wants the recipe! My uncle wants me to bring it EVERY time I see him!

Hmmm...the original recipe turned out really bland for my taste and I didn't care for it....however I took it to a party anyway and after we doctored it up there (hot sauce, cayenne etc.) everyone LOVED it except me.

My husband said this was the nastiest looking dish  I had ever made but it sure tasted good. I added two cans of green chili's and two jalapenos. I was spicy but next time I'll probably add more jalapenos. I also added fresh garlic. It was very good. Took it to a get together and everyone enjoyed it. Definitely worth trying. Just don't let the way it look when you're making it scare you off.

This is a great recipe-  I usually use non-fat sour cream.  Wonderful to bring to a party.  It seems best if you let it refrigerate for at least 24 hours or more.  Always a big hit!!

This recipe is the best with Fritos. I always mix the sour cream and the mayo together before adding to the rest of the ingredients. Add just enough of the mayo/sour cream mixture to keep the mix thick like a dip.  I was at a party recently and someone made this dip and it was like soup which is not appetizing. Best made the day before. Add jalepeno's to your taste.  can be spicy or not according to how many jalepeno's you add. This is great served with Margarita's before a casual dinner. We love to serve before a grilled hamburger or chicken dinner by the pool.

Great recipe!  I wondered if three cans of corn would be too much, but it really wasn't.  The jalapenos gave it a little kick - really good dip and refreshing for the summer!

This is a great and easy recipe! Everyone at work loved, I mean LOVED this dip and asked for the recipe. However, instead of using 3 11 ounce cans of Mexican style corn, I used 1 8ounce yellow corn, 1 8ounce can of white order and measured 8 ounces of Mexican corn. I also added a little bit of sugar, seasoning salt and pepper to this dish! It came out amazing! Please take Becky's advice and use with Hawaiian bread, it was fantastic!

This dip was really good, but was missing something.  I have had other dips like this, and they were more flavorful.  I added some taco seasoning and it was much better, but no one seemed to take much interest in it at our Super Bowl Party.  I will try it again, but maybe add more spices.

Every time I make this dip, someone asks me for the recipe.  I use the yellow and white super sweet corn, instead of the mexi-corn.  I also add a generous tsp of garlic powder, salt and pepper to taste.

Everyone enjoyed this dip . . . no one could eat just one chip/frito with this dip.  The recipe makes a very large quantity though.  Next time I think I would cut the recipe in half.

I made this recipe for my neighbor's New Year's Eve party.  We loved it!  This recipe does make a lot.  You may want to cut it in half.  Also, next time I may cut back on the onions.

I serve this dip with big fritos... This is one of the yummiest dips around & the flavors blend nicely.  Be sure to let it sit overnight or for a while (chilled) before you serve to allow time for the flavors to meld together!

I tried this dip at a couple of work potlucks with mixed results.  It seems that the people who like this dip LOVE it, but there were more people that didn't really care for it.

I have made this dip twice.  One of the girls I work with LOVES it.  We are having an eclipse party tomorrow at work and they requested I bring this dip.  Very good and easy to make.  I did add some garlic and herb cream cheese and substituted cream cheese for the mayo.  Very good recipe!  Will be making for a long time to come.

This was a great dip. Everyone  enjoyed it. I used less corn than it called for. I felt like it was better with a little less corn.

I enjoyed this dip very much. However, it is very spicy for me (I have a fairly low spice tolerance) so I thought it would have been spicy enough with just the chilies - omitting the jalapeño. Or perhaps only adding half the jalapeño.

People gather around the bowl every time I make this!  My original recipe didn't call for any jalepeno but sounds good.  On occasion, I will add a can of drained, rinsed black beans. Adds color,  makes it more filling and goes even farther.  All depends on the crowd as many don't care for beans.

Use monteray jack and cheddar cheese. Also add some taco seasoning to give it some more flavor.

I'd made this many, many times - so much so that I don't even need to look at the recipe when I'm at the store buying ingredients. I love it. Everyone I work with loves it and requests it often. I've made a few additions over the years such as taco seasoning and chopped black olives. Such a great dip!!

Delicious ! As one of the previous reviews suggested, I added cumin and garlic and served with tortilla chips. I also excluded the jalapeños simply because I'm not a fan of spicy things. This recipe was an overall success.

I used fresh corn and subbed in cream cheese for the mayo.  We thought it was a little bland.  I added some garlic powder, doubled the green chiles, and topped with cilantro which helped.  I also think a sharp cheddar is key - otherwise you don't taste that element.  Maybe the Mexican corn would have added the boost we were missing!  I like the idea though.  Maybe I'll try it again as a hot dip....

This is a really great snack - and very easy to make.  I made a few alterations:  I used only 8 oz of cheddar cheese, which seemed like enough - and I added about 1-1/2 teaspoons of ground cumin.  Great recipe!

This dip was a hit at my last BBQ. Everyone is still talking about it and asking me to make it for the next get-together. I followed the recipe but the only difference was I used a block of cream cheese instead of mayo, and didn't have fresh jalapeno, so I used a can of diced jalapenos instead. Added some cayenne for a kick.

Added a whole envelope of taco seasoning to add some flavor. Was very good but not too pretty to look at and guests had a tendency to pass it up in favor of the taco soup I also served. Should have served it as an appetizer where it would have have no competition.

This was GREAT. I served it with tortilla chips and added 2 jalapenos for extra heat. I also added more sour cream than required and used frozen corn.  For spices, I used chili, onion, and garlic powder to taste. This was so easy and so good.

I've been wanting to try this but we really didn't care much for it.  I like all of the ingredients separately but found it to be a bit bland.  Maybe I should have tried some of the reviewer's suggestions to add taco seasoning?  Probably won't make again, though.

This is awesome!  I've made it for several parties and always get raves for it and requests for the recipe.  Great with Fritos' scoops!

I made this dip for our Christmas Eve celebration and everyone loved it.  If you like corn you will love this recipe.  You can't stop eating it though!!!!
