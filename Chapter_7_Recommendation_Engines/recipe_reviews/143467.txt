I just made these again, three years later than the first time I made this recipe. I did a few tweaks. You can view the step-by-step photos at www.bakedlava.com I added 2 packages of pudding mix, a full cup of chopped pistachios and a 10-ounce jar of cherries. It's funny, but the first time I made these, they did have an odd, greenish tint to them...with 2 boxes of pudding mix, that tint was just not there. This is just a great spin off a chocolate chip cookie recipe and it is going on my Christmas platters this year. I highly recommend this recipe, either as is, or with my tweaks...it is tasty either way you go!

I've never had a recipe my family asks me to make more than this!  We live in different states and every time I come "home" to visit, I know they expect me to bring a fresh batch of cookies along with!  Even my brother, who can be somewhat hard to please, raves about these delicious spumoni chocolate chip cookies!!  A must-try!

I was looking to see if there was a homemade recipe for these on here. I will DEFINITELY try it! I usually make the Betty Crocker version using the sugar cookie mix. You add pistachios and chocolate chunks and dried cherries to it. I however, improvised that recipe and add also a pkg of dry pistachio pudding mix and use cherry flavored Crasins. This recipe has such great reviews I cannot wait to give it a whirl!

Oh boy, are these DELICIOUS!  I made them for Christmas and they were a huge hit.  I've never thought of chocolate chip cookies as Christmassy, but these are, both in appearance and flavor.  My RM has asked me to make some more, so it looks like these will definitely be a permanent fixture in our dessert rotation. I'm tempted to increase the pistachios to 1/3 cup and the maraschinos to 3/4 cup, not because it's necessary, but because I'd like to have more of them.  The recipe is great just as-is-- no need to change a thing!

A wonderful twist on a classic! I used an entire 12 oz jar of cherries and chopped them well, also used a 12 oz pkg of chocolate chips. Nice, soft cookies with a very light green tint. I used a Pampered Chef medium cookie scoop and it yielded 40 cookies. If making for the holidays, you may want to add a couple drops of green food coloring to make them a stronger green color and extra Christmas-y!

This was a suprisingly good recipe. I omitted the 1/4 cup of flour (rather off the dough would have been too dry) but rather off kept the recipe intact as is. The cookies stayed nice and chewy a couple days after I had made them and overall everyone in my place loved them!

What a great cookie! I love "spumoni" icecream, pistachios, cherries, and chocolate are such a wonderful combination. So, I had to try these cookies when I saw them. My store did not have marachino cherries, so I used some pitted dark (sweet) cherries in heavy syrup, drained very well. And, they worked perfect in this recipe. Chocolate chips only come in a 12 oz bag so I used that. From the recipe I got 68 cookies using a 1 Tblsp. cookie scoop. I will definitely make these again. They were soft, chewy, and very flavorful. They will be on my Christmas cookie list next year. Thank you!

Yummy, bright and fun cookies! I cut back the amount of chocolate chips and pistachios but otherwise followed the recipe. They are somewhat floury so next time I would omit the last 1/4 cup flour or add a couple teaspoons of cooking oil.  The maraschino cherries and pistachios were the stars, I think!

These cookies were ok. After they were baked, the pistachio flavor was lost. I suggest less flour and 2 packages of pistachio pudding flavor.

These were very good. Nice change to a classic cookie. The red of the cherries and green of the pistachios made them extra pretty for Christmas. Brought them to the family Holiday party where many people complimented them.

These are a nice change of pace from the "usuals" cookie.  I followed the recipe, though I did use a little more cherry to use the entire jar and I only had 3/4 of a bag of semi sweet mini morsels, so I added a handful of full sized milk chocolate chips to make up the difference (plus, I've learned I enjoy a mixture of semi sweet and milk chocolate chips in cookies).  I LOVED this dough and thought this was going to be my new all time favorite cookie.  When I ate a cookie fresh out of the oven, they didn't quite live up to the raw dough expectation.  I reserved my rating until this morning so I could enjoy a completely cooled cookie.  They haven't become my favorite cookie, but I do enjoy that they're a change of pace from the same old same old.  THANKS for the recipe, Serafina!

These were fantastic!  I adjusted the recipe for a special Christmas cookie.  I split the dough in half, put the cherries in one half and colored it pink, and colored the other half green with almond flavoring and pistachio nuts.  Then I split a bag of mini-chips between the 2 halves, and spooned half a scoop of each and put on the cookie sheet.  They were great and well-liked!

Excellent cookie with a nice chocolate chip variation.  I added both red & green maraschino cherries (more than called for), extra pistachios and green coloring for holiday appeal.  They were a hit.  Soft cookie, but firm with the many additives. I also made them much smaller, so I had loads of cookies. A definite holiday tray delight.

I'm the only one who liked these in my family. I did try them three different ways, without the chocolate chips and cherries and then without the cherries. But I prefer them the way the recipe is written. I made some of them small and dipped them in melted chocolate for my christmas trays, they were delicious!

These are very good and I made exaclty as written.  I was hoping for more spumoni flavoring, it kinda just tastes like a normal chocolate chip cookie.  Next time I make I'm going to increase both the cerries and pistachios.  Thanks for sharing!!

These are awesome! Only thing i did different was I put in 12 ounces of chocolate chips (1 bag) instead of 16 ounces which seemed like too many chips to me. A keeper for sure!!

Spumoni ice cream lover? Make these NOW. Warning- they will go fast. Also, they are very moist because of the pudding mix but they are fantastic!

Really pretty cookies! Instead of using the pudding mix, I ground 1/4 cup pistachios with 1/4 cup granulated sugar in the food processor. The only maraschino cherries in the house were whiskey-spiked, for cocktails--what a shame!--so I used those (although I don't think they added as much flavor as I wanted them to). I added 1/2 teaspoon salt to the dough, too. These would be a nice addition to a Christmas cookie tray.

These cookies turned out fantastic- I made them for a Christmas cookie exchange. My only disappointment was that it tasted too much like just 'regular' chocolate chip cookies. I expected something more flavourful from the pistachio pudding, pistachios and cherries in the batter. Next time I will put 1.5 the amount of cherries indicated.

Not bad.  A little too chocolatey for me--the pistachio and cherry flavor is more subtle, so I'd cut back on the chocolate chips to adjust for that.  Otherwise, these are nice cookies.  Very easy, and although I was worried they'd spread a ton, they didn't really.  Very pretty with the green, brown, and red as well.  Thanks for the recipe!

DELICIOUS! I had to try this because pistachio is my favorite. The only change I made was less chocolate chips, i only used about 2/3 of the package. I think next time I will add more pistachios and cherries though. YUMMY

These are delicious!  A nice spin on the traditional chocolate chip cookie.  The cherries and pistachio pudding mix just add a touch of extra flavor.  These baked very nicely, they had just a touch of crisp on the outside but were thick and chewy on the inside.  After two days they are still nice and soft as well!  I'm amazed at that, since ALL my cookies become hard after two days, if not sooner.  Great recipe, thank you!

The cookies came out great. I love the flavor of the chocolate and the pistachio. I was planning on putting in white chocolate like a play on the Italian flag but, the semi-sweet is perfect.

This has become my very favorite cookie recipe.  I've made it several times now and it never disappoints.  The cherries make it a great cookie for the holidays and the pistachio pudding makes it rich.  I absolutely crave these cookies.

The first time I made these, I followed the recipe exactly except for using an entire 10 oz jar of maraschino cherries (because what was I going to do with the leftovers?)... it's only an extra 1/4 cup anyway.  the chocolate chips were a little challenging, since there's no such thing as a 16 oz bag - did the author mean 12 oz bag or 2 and 1/2 cups?  I went with the 12 oz bag.  People really liked them, but I thought they could be improved.  I replaced the vanilla flavoring with almond, added another pistachio pudding mix and used 3 cups of chocolate chips.  Everyone agreed that they were even better with those revisions.

I used on package of pudding and added 1/8 tsp almond extract.  Think it could use more pistachio flavor, so may play around with adding more pudding mix or extract next time. Also added a few drops of green food coloring for Xmas.

This recipe was a big hit at work.  For me it was too many chocolate chips, I think next time I will use half or substitute half with white chocolate.   Following the recipe as listed my cookies are very soft and chewy.

Just made these cookies and used some of the other reviews using two puddings, less flour.  Reason for four stars is the cooking time was off.  Had a hard time determining what worked and what I would do next.  Cooking time I used 14-15 minutes and I would flatten a bit before cooking.  Otherwise, the taste was great!

I love the favor combo in these cookies. I've made them a couple times and had to substitute a different pudding flavor once because I couldn't find pistachio. I think I used maybe french vanilla instead, and, honestly, didn't think you could tell the difference.

Oh yes!!! This cookie is so good. I didn't have pistachios or pistachio pudding mix, but I had pecans and banana pudding mix. Suddenly, I had banana split cookies!  Everyone absolutely loved them. I can't wait to try other pudding flavors. You can basically do anything with this yummy recipe!  Awesome stuff!!!

I took the advice of previous reviewers and used two boxes of pistachio pudding mix, and a whole 10 oz jar of cherries, and a cup of chopped pistachios.  The results were not bad and very colorful, but still the cookies were too "cake-like" for me - I'd prefer them to be more moist and chewy.   Maybe less flour next time?

Made these for the second time.  Love them.  The only issue I had was they did not flatten like typical chocolate chip cookies .. Can anyone tell me why this might have happened ?  They can  came out like a snow ball cookie. ..  Too much flour maybe?  I did use the 2 1/4 cups as recipie called for .

This recipe is a HUGE hit with everyone I've ever made it for.  The batch makes a ton of cookies and they are yummy.  

I didn't make any changes to the recipe.  The pudding mix gives the cookies this great pistachio flavor.  The cookies are doughier/ softer by nature.  These are so good.  I make these every Christmas.

I normally don't bake. However, I felt the need to this holiday season when I found this recipe.  Needless to say, these turned out absolutely delicious! I did alter the recipe a bit by adding more chopped Maraschino cherries and chopped pistachios, and a less than the late amount for chocolate chips (because I only had a 10oz bag on hand). As much of a choco-a-holic I am, I thought it needed even less than that. Regardless, they were delicious and I received nothing but compliments. 

P.S. My husband's family is Italian and love spumoni ice cream. This was an extra special treat to them! Thank you!

I love Spumoni, so when i originally saw this recipe, I had to try it!  My verdict is that it's a great idea, and the recipe above is a place to start, but if you like very intense flavor a like I do, I'd make a couple tweaks. I've made these every Christmas for 4 years now, and a lot of my friends love them, but the first batch I made, (following the recipe exactly), was, I felt, lacking in noticeable pistachio and cherry flavor. It tasted pretty much like a chocolate chip cookie. I think part of the problem is that the chocolate chips have a strong flavor that overwhelms the others, so I cut back on them a little. And to get more intense pistachio and cherry flavors, I bought some flavoring oils that are usually sold for candy-making - only a couple drops of each are needed. I also used candied cherries, (red and green colored), instead of jarred maraschinos. Finally, just for fun, I split the dough into 2 halves and used food coloring to make one half green and one half pink. They turn out SO good now!

This is the 3rd year in a row I have made these for our annual family cookie swap. Everyone kept calling to make sure I was making them. I guess it's my thing now.... "OMG you have to try Samantha's Spumoni cookies they are sooo good."  I know it's not my reciepe however I'll take credit where I can get it ;)

I made this to give out in my holiday gift baskets and decided that it would be much better to serve this to guests that visit during the holidays instead due to the cost. Everyone loved this cookie and I intend to make it again. People asked me for the recipe because they loved them so much. I make 20+ different cookies during the holidays to fill gift baskets and 4 batches of this one does become costly.

followed recipe exactly - except I did not have pistachio nut so I used slivered almonds and the cookies were great my new favorite way of making chocolate chips.  For Christmas cookie tray I may add some green food coloring to brighten them up.

Taste was good, but the amount of chocolate overpowered the other flavors. I used 14oz of chocolate chips. I'll use even less next time and maybe increase the nuts.

These cookies hit the spot. I was craving chocolate chip cookies and pistachio pudding. With this recipe I got the best of both world. I used 1/2 the chips, just because of the sugar and they turned out marvellous.

Excellent. I did use 2 cups of flour and 1/2 cup chopped pistachios.  These were great. I'm adding them to my favorite cookie list.

I have made these cookies a few times and they don't last in my house. I used dry cherries instead of the maraschino and chocolate fudge chips instead of semi sweet chocolate and they are amazing.
