I REALLY LOVED THIS. I DID NOT HAVE ENOUGH SALSA, SO I USED TACO SAUCE AND SALSA MIXED TOGETHER. I ALSO ADDED LETTUCE AFTER BAKING. THIS WAS QUICK AND EASY. I WILL MAKE THIS ONE AGAIN.

I was looking for a good Mexican pizza recipe when I came across this.  It was easy to make and tasted great.  I added shredded lettuce on top after cooking for a little crunch.  Also, might be good with some chopped tomatoes added afterwards.  I'll make this again!

This was really good. I used garlic bread crumbs instead. I also drizzled the chicken with olive oil and used pasta sauce in the bottom of the dish. My picky fiance even liked it. I will definitely make this again. It was easy too!

My kids were a little picky about this, but overall a tasty, and different, dish.
