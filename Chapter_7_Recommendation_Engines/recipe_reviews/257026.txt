We skipped the mint and used pasta made from chickpeas for added protein. This is one of our favorite recipes! Sometimes we skipped the beansprouts too, it's good either way.

Wasn't a big fan of the mint in this dish I will use parsley next time and add more garlic.

I loved the simplicity of this recipe but also the great taste. I found the mint to be essential and gave this recipe a unique quality.  While one might not want to overdue it, I would definitely make sure to include the mint.
