We've used the same tri tip steak rub recipe for years. We've made this BBQ Steak recipe a few times now and it is our new favorite. The only change I made was I used dried rosemary because I didn't have fresh rosemary on hand. I doubled the batch of marinade and froze half the batch for a later time. I made the second (frozen) batch last night and it turned out just as well as the first time.

Goodbye to all store bought marinades!  This recipe is actually listed as BBQ but it works great even if you are broiling or pan frying your steaks.  It's really easy too .. put everything in the blender and your done! For a sweeter variation, add two tablespoons of brown sugar.

This makes the best steak I have ever had but take my advice and delete the salt!  The only (minor) complaint I had on this delicious marinade was that it was a little salty.  The soy sauce provides enough salt.  Try this once and you will love it.

Excellent steak marinade!  I cut the recipe in half for a 1 lb. sirloin steak.  Since the type of vinegar wasn't specified in the recipe I used red wine vinegar.  I always used low sodium soy sauce and cut the amount of salt in half.  I let this marinate all day.  I put it on the grill with a fresh sprig of rosemary to give it a little smokiness and it was wonderful.  I can't wait to experiment with other typically tougher cuts of meat to see what happens.....

Very good marinade. I made this for a group on a camping trip and everyone raved.  Most asked for the recipe. One person, out of 10 mentioned that there was a bit too much vinegar. Figuring the others were too polite to tell me, I cut the vinegar by 2 Tbsp for our next dinner party.  No complaints and I thought it tasted better this way.

I used balsamic vinegar and it was the best marinated steak we'd ever had!  I have a large rosemary in the garden and I'm always looking for ways to use it fresh.  Don't be intimidated by the amt. of vinegar, this is a GREAT recipe!

I blended the ingredients in a blender and it came out great!  I poured it over our steak and let it sit for a day.  Then my husband grilled it and the steak was excellent.

As another reviewer has said, "Goodbye store-bought marinades!" This marinade rocks! I used it on Rib-eye steak for Mother's Day. I followed some tips mentioned here, and used 1/4 cup vinegar, cut the salt in half, and since I had no rosemary, I used about 1/2 tsp dried thyme. This is definitely on my list of BBQ marinades...for steak, pork chops or chicken. I think it would be good on any of those!

Thanks for posting it!

This was a very tasty change from the normal steak seasoning. I used this on some cheap patio steaks, and the sauce really made it worth eating! :)

Great marinade! I marinated some Tri-tip overnight and It came out perfect. I dont think the vinager was overpowering at all. It added a great zesty flavor.

This was such a quick and easy marinade.  Make sure that you cook it on a low fire because my husband burnt ours and the marinade got pretty crispy.  It still tasted very delicious and we look forward to trying it next time!

This recipe passed the toughest test of my mother-in-law. WOW! I replaced salt with fishsauce for deeper taste. Added some garlic butter and a bit of honey for crunchier roasting flavour.

This recipe was brilliant. For the reviever that disliked the "vinegar" taste, may I suggest using a flavored vinegar, wine vinegar, or balsamic, and fresh (not dried) rosemary. When I first tried, I used a white wine vinegar, and I think next time I may experiment with a balsamic. I would think it would be fabulous as a marinade for lamb if one used a rosemary vinegar.

This marinade was very flavorful and easy to throw together in the blender.I used cider vinegar, which was on hand. Made as the recipe states, I had more than enough to marinate the 3 porterhouse steaks I grilled last night. I'm thinking that one could easily marinate two tri tips with this or simply use half the marinade for one tri tip, freezing the balance for a future grilled beef meal. Will definitely be using this recipe again!

Yummmm!  This was so good.  I didn't have any dijon mustard on hand so I added French's yellow mustard, german grain mustard and a little mustard powder.  I only marinated it for a half hour but it was really tasty.  Next time I'll marinate it longer and enjoy the results!!

This is so delicious! I would only change one thing which would be NOT adding any salt and using low sodium soy sauce. This is just perfect for BBQ-ing. Try it on pork chops, chicken, pretty much anything you can marinade will come out flavorful and DELICIOUS.

Delicious! I have made this many times and switched out the steak.  The marinade is awesome! I split the marinade and use some marinade for actually marinating the meat and some for dipping or saucing the final product.  I made this for several family and friends.  I received rave reviews and requests for the recipe.  Will definitely be keeping this one and making it often.  Thank you SILAU for sharing it!!

Very moist (which isn't easy to do with a tri-tip) but not quite enough flavor even though it was marinated overnight. Did use apple cider vinegar as suggested by others.

I love this recipe! I am not a big steak eater, but I have been converted since I made this. The recipe requires simple ingredients (which I love!) and it makes the steaks very flavorful! I marinated the steak for a little over 3 hours, so the flavor just popped! I would definitely make this again because it makes your mouth water!

Excellent flavor. Steak in this marinade stands on its own and doesn't need additional sauce. Steak was tender and flavorful. Next time I'll cut the tri-tip in to small steaks and marinate and grill those individually so as to haev more thorough flavor.

We thought this was very good.  I marinated the steaks and cooked on my George Forman grill.  Steaks were moist and full of flavor.  I think they would be even better cooked on the outside BBQ.  Can't wait for BBQ Season!  Thanks for a very good recipe.

My family loved this recipe. Excellent flavor. I only used 1/4 cup soy sauce because I ran out. For the vinegar I used 1/4 cup red wine vinegar and 1/4 cup balsamic. I used extra garlic. Marinated a 3lb tri-tip for about 90 minutes. I ran out of propane so I roasted the meat in my Flavorwave oven (I love that thing). Served with garlic smashed potatoes and mixed veggies. The tri-tip was so flavorful and moist, yum. I will use this marinade again for sure. Thank you for the recipe!

Excellent marinade!  I cut the amount of vinegar in half, and used white wine vinegar.  I used flank steak (my steak of choice) and broiled it - it was EXCELLENT!  I garnished with some leftover rosemary sprigs.  We will definitely make this again!

This marinade is very good. I used basalmic vinegar. Steak was juicy and tasted great.

Followed recipe exactly, except I cut in half since I was only marinating one steak.  I let it marinate for 24 hrs and threw on the grill.  My fiance did not like the flavor of this at all and I didn't really see it as anything special.

This is by far the BEST marinade I've ever used.  Of course, I don't usually marinate meat, but this is wonderful.  I use whatever cheap cuts of meat I can find, sometimes just a roast that I cut into steaks, and it turns out tender and juicy.  I've also used wine instead of vinegar, and that works great.  Thanks for the recipe.

We really loved this!  Could not find tri-tip steak at our grocery so we used delmonicos instead.  Did not have vinegar so we used red cooking wine and did omit the salt.  Will definitely make and use this again!

Best Marinade I have come across yet. I ran out of Rosemary and used thyme instead - still very good :)

I'm not big on sweet marinades, and this is so savory and wonderfully flavorful!

This is a good one but I have found that if your BBQ is good enough for chip dip it will be a hit for your BBQ. I use a lot of brown sugar to make it the best you will ever use. Try it and you will be a hit.

I used dried rosemary, minced jarred garlic, and white balsamic vinegar. This made an excellent marinade. Good way to jazz up cheap steak.

Delicious!  This marinade is salty, but I didn't think it was overly so, and the flavor is excellent.

This was delicious! I loved that I could prep this in the am and let it sit in the fridge until dinner. I took the advice of another reviewer and used balsamic vinegar and it was perfection. I then shaved the leftovers paper thin to make an out of this world steak salad for lunch the next day!

This was tasty.  I made exactly as stated except I omitted the salt as others recommended.  I used fresh Rosemary and I loved how it made the marinade come together.  Used a Top Sirloin and I grilled some red onion to go along with it. YUMMY.

Was fantastic.  Used London Broil.  Marinaded overnight.  Cooked it first on an infrared burner then finished off on the regular grill.  All my guests and I could say was Oh my God!

My wife and I both thought this recipe was very good.I used it on rib-eye steaks and cooked them in a skillet instead of the grill,still pretty darn tasty. I will use this recipe again,maybe on chicken, next time. Thank you.

Loved this marinade!  I have been searching for a long time for a steak marinade that I really like and this is it.  Whole family raved.  I cut the recipe in half for a 1.75 lb sirloin and it was plenty.  Hubby grilled it to perfection for a delicious Mother's Day dinner!

WAY too much vinegar.  Next time I would cut down the vinegar and salt, but I will make again.  Made the steak juicy and tender.

Scaled recipe for 4 servings, then marinated steak chunks for kabobs.  Not as much flavor as I expected, especially after marinating 24 hours.  My husband liked this a lot more than I did.

The best steak I've ever made...I had to double up the ingredients for a bigger serving and I put a little too much salt.
Other than that, THIS RECIPE IS FLAWLESS!!!! A great hit at the BBQ...will make again!

This is totally awsome!  We have used T-bones, Venison, Rib Eyes, you name it, every time it turns out wonderful.  You will not need steak sauce of any kind.  I like to make it for company and the steak comes up several times in the conversation.

This recipe is so easy and sooooo good.  I have made it twice and results were very tasty both times.  I omitted the rosemary, used cider vinegar and didn't even bother processing the mixture in the blender, just threw the onion and garlic in with the sauce.  Pierced the steaks all over with a fork to let the marinate soak into the meat overnight.  --Yum!

At first, I thought there was too much vinegar in the recipe, but I made it exactly the way it says.  I found it to be so good in the end.  The vinegar is not overpowering.  This is a delicious recipe.  Dont be afraid to try it!!

I wish I could give this steak 10 stars instead of 5. Only change was I used top sirloin. I don’t recommend any changes to the recipe, it’s perfect as is.

My Texan husband & some best friends ( beef-lovers) raved about their steaks marinated in this marinade. They are still raving!  I doubled the recipe for (4) 1lb. each Rib-eyes (3/4 - 1” thick) & froze the remaining unused portion as per an earlier reviewer. It’s SO easy & quick to make. My only (small) changes per the recipe were, 1) I added 2 T brown sugar, 2) used low-sodium soy sauce & 3) for vinegar I used 1/2 part red wine vinegar & 1/2 part  white vinegar.   I pierced them & then marinated them for 4 hours, completely covered ( I let them sit at room temp for the last hour).   Here’s our secret: get your grill super-hot, lay those babies on, close the lid & cook for 6-7 minutes to slightly char them on one side...... then reduce flame & FLIP & only cook for 1-2 mins, no more.  This produces a great taste at medium doneness.  Shorten times if you like rarer meat.

MADE AS POSTED:  This was tasty and I really enjoyed the rosemary flavoring.  Solid 4 star recipe.  I'll make again from time to time.  Might even add a touch more rosemary.

Two vinegary. My fault for using dried rosemary, but you really need to crush it to get that sweetness throughout. Will make again.

I put the soy sauce and only 1 tsp of salt and it was still too salty. I'd hold off on the salt till you can taste it at the end. Other than that, very good recipe.

It was good but I found it took away from the steak taste. Not overpowering just hard to taste the meat I guess. I rated it 5 stars because I used the leftover marinade on chicken breast and it was out of this world.

This is the best steak marinade EVER!!  I usually cut the marinade in half and there's plenty to coat the steaks.

All I could have hoped for in a marinade - and It was a tough choice with the many on All Recipes.  I used it for beef kabobs and marinaded nearly 24 hours.  They were tender and totally flavorful.  Also reserved about a half cup for mixed veggies and marinaded them about 3 hrs and cooked separately in a grill basket.  I pretty much followed the recipe with exceptions that did not add any salt and used about half the olive oil (except added some back in for the vegetables). Will definitely do this one again...totally wowed my guests, too.  Thanks for sharing the recipe and for those reviewers that gave hints like reducing the salt.

I tried this recipe in my Airfryer. The time on the machine manual is too long. I tried in the traditional way too, which is perfect. Either way, test is great.

I think this is a wonderful recipe. The only thing I did different was use fresh Rosemary, Thyme and Oregano since I have all three. I made a high quality Ribeye with this marinade. I didn't have hours to marinade, only about a 1/2 hour. This was VERY good. Both my husband and I loved it.

Read the reviews about the recipe being too salty so I omitted the extra salt, a good thing too since the soy sauce makes it salty enough by itself. Overall, a good marinade.

I don't meat, but my family does. This recipe was simple and the meat came out a perfect medium, middle was medium-rare. They raved about the outcome, so it's a keeper!

My husband loves steak. This was the first stake I made and it was super tasty! more tasty than any we've had in restaurants. Thanks for the recipe! Will definitely be making more!

I made a few changes though, added an extra clove of garlic, a small piece of ginger, omitted the salt and mustard (didn't have any mustard in my pantry) and reduced the vinegar by 2 tablespoons. I also increased the marination time to 5 hours; even though I used undercut beef. The result was an extremely flavourful and juicy steak. I put on a layer of cream cheese on the Grill-hot steaks.

Served it with Garlic Potatoes (from this website).

Also, this marinade worked as the perfect sauce, I cooked onion rings in the left over marinade and poured this sauce over the steak! YUMMY! This marinade works perfect as a sauce! Great recipe!

Ive been getting recipes here for a long time and this is my first review. This is the best steak I ever had. Because of this recipe, I can no longer eat steaks out in restaurants because they pale in comparison. I use this recipe for pan-fried steaks and they are so full of flavor and delicious!!

Wonderful marinade! I cut the rosemary and pepper by about half and skipped the salt. Only marinated buffalo steaks for about 20 minutes (in a vacuum sealed marinating device) and afterwards cooked the marinade and reduced it to make a delicious dipping sauce. This is a keeper!

I have to give this a 5 star especially when this steak is paired with a fine red wine.  Using fresh rosemary really is the key.  I tried this recipe using filet mignon and it was awesome!  In fact I'm getting hungry for this recipe just writing about it.  Try it!

When I fixed this steak, I was not sure how it was going to come out,because I live in an apartment,and was not allowed a grill, so I fix my in the Broiler.  I cooked it  10 min on one side and 8 min on the other. I used Top Round London Broil. It came out perfect. My husband said it was the best he had in a long time.

This marinade is easy to make and excellent!  I forgot to buy fresh rosemary, so I used dried rosemary and it was fine.  We will definitely make this again.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was really good. I do have another favorite as far as marinade goes but this was next to that.

We just finished eating this steak. It was a hit for my family. I used dried rosemary and it was still quite good. I will be making this marinade again

This was awesome.  We used this on a couple of t-bone steaks and a couple of veal chops and it was super yummy.  I will use this again.

great marinade and easy to make.  Had a strip steak in the freezer and it did wonders for it.  the 3 hours was plenty of marinating time.

This steak has wonderful favor and marinaded over night and baked it until it was medium. And also added worcestershire sauce, and added garlic powder. This is a summer favorite and cant wait to make again.

I cut this recipe in half and used Boar's head mustard and regular vinegar. It was not overpowering at all,everyone at the table gobbled it up. Be sure to keep basting with reserved marinade,it keeps it moist and flavorful. Great recipe for steaks.

A really great marinade.  We are not very good at making steak but we ate these up.  Now we can invite people over for steak because these were awesome.  I didn't have vinegar so I used balsamic vinegar.
