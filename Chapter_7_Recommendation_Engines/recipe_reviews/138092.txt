This recipe immediately caught my eye because of the roasted garlic and the roasted red peppers; two of my favorite things to cook with. I followed the recipe to a
tee the first time, and while it was good, the amount of lemon juice overpowers everything else in the recipe! I
think the lemon juice amount may be a typo. Anyway, I made it again and cut the lemon juice to a 1/4 cup,
increased the roasted garlic to a 1/3 cup and left out the half & half (it didn't really need it, to me), and it was to die for. Five stars and highly recommended, just go easy on the lemon juice.

I had this with pita chips and I love it!! I added fresh dill and left out the cream- I really don't think that would've added anything.

Lovely!! I roasted my own bell peppers since I was roasting garlic. I didn't use the half and half. I also used closer to 1/3 c. of lemon juice. So very close to the actual recipe. It tasted very good, but we felt it would be great as a warm/hot dip. So we popped it in the oven at 350 for maybe 20-25 minutes. We ate it with parmesan garlic pita chips. So great!!! Thanks!

WOW this was amazing!  I took it to a party and everyone loved it.  I did not use the half & half and only about 2 Tbls. of the olive oil.  Also took others' advice and reduced the lemon juice to 1/4 cup.  Was PERFECT, will definitely be making this again (many, many times!)

yum-eee!!  so delicious!  i made with a jarred roasted red peppers and 2 heaping tablespoons regular minced garlic from a jar (too lazy to do the roasting myself), about 1/3 cup fresh squeezed lemon and the remaining ingredients as written.  well, except for the olive oil and/or half & half.  totally delish, just the right amount of garlic and lemon and red pepper flavors.  can't wait to serve to my guest tomorrow after the flavors have married.  yummers!!

Very yummy dip, but I would recommend cutting down on the lemon juice (I used about half the written amount).  This was great with toasted pita chips.  Thanks for the recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly and for once, didn't read the other reviews.  When I was done the dip was wayyyyyyyyy too lemony.  I mean, totally inedible, and I love lemon.  So I tried to fix it by doubling feta, cream cheese, peppers.... didn't work.  Don't even think I am going to serve it and I'm kind of annoyed since it's not really the cheapest dip to make with all the cheese and peppers!  Oh well, live and learn!

A potentially good recipe, but definitely too much lemon juice.  I would start with 1/4 to 1/3 cup and then add more to taste.  I made it based on the amounts listed and was dissapointed with the final product.

Wow! Delicious! I made a major change by using about 3.5 oz of sundried tomatoes instead of the roasted red peppers. I reduced the lemon juice a bit and roasted a whole bulb of garlic, which ended up being abobut 1/3 cup. This was the first dish at our party to disappear!

Would rate this a 10 if I could!  Love this recipe with the following modifications. I use 1/4 cup each lemon juice & olive oil, 8 oz. feta & cream cheese, 2 roasted heads of garlic and 3/4 tsp. of oregano and no milk substance at all.  Put it all into the food processor and mix until incorporated.  May appear runny, but after refrigeration it firms up nicely.  Serve this with naan, or pita bread.  YUMMY!!

I followed the recipe exactly except I had to sub lime juice for the lemon & I took another reviewer's suggestion and used 2 heaping tbsp of minced garlic from a jar (because that's what I had on hand).  Next time I may use just 2 regular tbsp instead of heaping just to tone down the garlic a little (I know, it's a garlic dip, but I was hoping to taste more of the roasted red peppers) IF I don't roast my own garlic - which would probably boost this review to 5 stars.  I processed until smooth & creamy - so much so that it didn't look like our fave Greek restaurant's Tyrokavteri but it still tasted delicious.  A lot of people on here didn't add the cream, I tried it before then added the cream and I think it takes a bit of the bitterness off from the garlic, so I would suggest sticking to the recipe especially if you aren't roasting your own garlic (which is sweeter & less bitter than from a jar).

Pretty awesome!  My favorite greek place makes it with roasted red peppers and cherry peppers, so I omitted the red pepper sauce and added about 5 ping pong ball sized jarred cherry peppers.  I also found mine creamy enough that I didn't add any olive oil or cream.  I really thought this was great and will definately be making it again.

This was really good.   I followed the advice of other reviewers and used less lemon juice.  I only used 4 tablespoons.  I roasted fresh red peppers rather than using store bought jar peppers.  Great recipe.

I think my feta was salty as this ended up being way too salty for me!  I'm not sure what else it might be.  Might try using a different type next time.  Also, 1/4 of a cup of lemon juice seems like a fair amount.  This is what I used and I could taste the lemon, but it was still very subtle.  Also, I didn't add the cream and it was really thick, more like a spread. I would add something to thin it out next time.  Mine turned out bright orange, which was a little off-putting, but still good!

Yum-o!  I'm pregnant and have been avised to stay away from imported soft cheeses, like feta, which means no Greek restaurant for me!  I've been looking for a recipe like this for a while and this was right up my alley!  I didn't have any cream cheese so I left that out but it was perfect anyway.  I followed the advice of another rater and used minced, not roasted garlic.  I would also use a bit less lemon juice than I did (or maybe the cream cheese would cut the acidity if I had used it). Thanks for a great recipe!

If anyone can edit the recipe, PLEASE, PLEASE change the lemon juice to 1/4 cup or more to taste, but NOT 1/2 cup. The recipe would have been a 5 Star but the lemon juice ruined it. I’ve made this before and read the reviews that most say use less lemon juice and I did. I was in a hurry and didn’t read reviews and actually ruined the dip, way to much lemon juice

This is one of my favorite dios in the whole world! I have made it with and without the half and half. Adding it gives a little extra creaminess. I prefer more of a garlic bite so after making it a few times with roasted garlic, I have made it with raw, minced garlic. It tastes even better the next day after marinating in the fridge over night. This is perfect on pita bread or pita chips, with raw veggies, or even corn chips!

I made this for my daughters Greek event at her school.  It's better than the usual hummus dip.  I roasted the bell peppers since I had to roast 2 bulbs of garlic anyways.   Adjust the lemon juice for your liking.  I also realized later that I bought a 6oz container of feta instead of an 8oz.  In case you're wondering about the pricing (ok, I'm just bored), I went to trader joes and got these: feta-$2.79, cream cheese brick-$1.69, mini pita-$1.99

This dip is so flavorful!  I didn't have the patience to roast the peppers in the oven so I actually threw the them on my george forman which worked perfectly!  Just cut them into 1/8ths so they would get flat and let them go for 15 minutes!  It may not be a traditional roasted red pepper but I thought they tasted fantastic!!  I read the other reviews and cut back on the lemon juice to about half what's called for.  I didn't have any tobasco but I did manage to put in WAY too much pepper.  Still entirely delicious.  Thanks for the recipe.  I'll be making this a lot!

I thought this was ok I would give it 3.5 stars.  If you love feta you will love this dip.  I thought it needed a little more dimension to the flavor.  Maybe a little more oregano and regular garlic along with the roasted?

This spread was tasty with the crusty bread. I took this to a Greek themed dinner and it went over pretty well. I only used 4 oz of Feta cheese and I think that was plenty.

I liked the recipe -- but it wasn't much of a crowd pleaser at Easter. (Some didn't like the Feta -- others didn't like the roasted red peppers.  For me it was the better of both worlds).  I skipped the olive oil and half and half because I thought the mixture was the right consistency without them.  Think I'll try it again with a different crowd !
