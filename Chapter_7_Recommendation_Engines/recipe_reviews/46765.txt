I've made this for years. I like to toast the bread and spread butter on before breaking it up and add the tomatoes. Good either way though!

Good basic recipe for a side dish if you like canned tomatoes (my husband not so much).  With all of the different flavors available in canned tomatoes, you really can style this up.

My mother taught me to make this when I was just learning to cook except we make it one the stove top and call it "Breaded tomatoes". This is a great take on a classic dish. We usually add some onions.
