Tried this out tonight, loved it with some minor adjustments! Cooked the chicken with garlic/onion powder, pepper, and salt. Then followed everything else except instead of tomato and bacon. Used  turkey bacon and a cup of salsa in place. Added a sprinkle of cumin, onion/garlic powder, and pepper. Put them tortillas with low fat sour cream and a bit of cheese..yum!! Will make these fajitas from now on!

I really liked this recipe as did my family.  A word of advice:  I sliced my chicken and fried them only a minute or two before adding everything else.  Also, don't be skimpy with the bacon and spices, otherwise it will taste bland.

This is a very good recipe to use!!! Except... For a more authentic mexican flavor though, use salsa instead of tomatos(from a real mexican restruant), just regular smoked bacon instead of peppered. Use salt, cajun seasoning, fajita seasoning (Any will do), pepper, and a little chili powder for the chickens seasoning. And Use small tortilas not big burrito size, Then Wet them slightly, wrap them in foil, and sit them in the oven for about 8 mins. add onions too, even if you dont like them they really snaz up the flavor. Other wise leave everything else the same cause this is a pretty good recipe!!

The other reviews were right. Definitely let the bacon cook for a while before adding the veggies or else it takes *forever* to cook. I also think that the chicken should be seasoned with something when you're cooking it because it ends up tasting kinda plain. Overall though, we were very happy with this meal and will make it again.

After reading reviewer Sally's comments, I fully cooked the bacon and added it at the end with the chicken. I also reduced the amount of the cilantro. My husband liked this more than I did, I felt it could have done with more seasoning. He really enjoyed them though. Thanks.

This tasted just as good as a resturant prepared meal...I did however make a few changes; I cooked down the onion and peppers with the bacon until the liquid was gone and I added half a lime with the cilantro in the end.  Thank you for this recipe

My husband loved this!!!  Considering I don't like peppers and mushrooms, I still thought it was good.  I changed how to make it a little. I cooked the bacon until it was crisp, and I threw in 3 extra peices (and I think next time I might even add more), I took out the bacon and stuck it in my shredder, and I cooked the vegtables in the bacon grease, and added the bacon again with the chicken at the end.  I didn't have cilantro, so I put montreal chicken seasoning in it.  I think it needs more spices.  Next time I will probably add greek with feta and oregano dressing in the fajita.  Yum.

This was ok.  I used 4 slices of regular bacon and added pepper, but the resulting dish really didn't taste of bacon very much.    I wish I had fully cooked the bacon before adding the onion and other veggies.  It was very difficult to get the bacon pieces crispy  once it was mixed in and no longer always touching the bottom of the pan.  I omitted the green pepper and cilantro (personal preference) but added some cumin.  Even though I love bacon, I think this recipe would be better without it (or crumble fully cooked bacon in at the very end).  Thanks for the recipe anyway!

I decided to make this meal AFTER I went shopping, so I did not have the cilantro or the tomato. I did however use a red & a yellow bell pepper along with the green pepper.  I also used approximately four to five table spoons of ranch as a topping at the point of serving, along with approximately one quarter of a cup of finely shredded Colby & Monterey jack. It was perfect, the family loved it, and one very full burito was enough to "fill the tank".

These are wonderful!  I cut up 5 slices of thick-cut mesquite-flavored bacon instead of 3 because we love bacon.  Easy and delicious!!

Very good!! I made a few small changes... I used regular bacon. I didn't add the tomatoes.  I added a dash of worcester sauce and a dash of soy sauce. We loved it and will definitely make these again. Thanks!

Very good although the next time I do it, I'll probably crisp the bacon almost completely before adding the peppers and onions. Actually, the recipe would be just as good without bacon. Also, I used canned diced tomatoes which gave it more of a sauce. Another change I made was baking the chicken in the oven before slicing it up. Will surely make again.

This recipe was amazing! My husband and I used taco seasoning instead of the cilantro, so it had just the right amount of spiciness I could tolerate. My daughter also loved it because she could eat the individual pieces (she's 2).

Good healthy meal!  I baked 2 chicken breasts in the oven ahead of time and chopped up.  Seasoned with garlic salt, pepper, and chili powder and stored in fridge until ready to use.  Used turkey bacon since that's what I had on hand and cooked until starting to crisp.  No mushrooms since I don't like them.  I added the chicken with the tomatoes and cooked for about 10 minutes since the chicken was cold when added.  I think that this added some extra flavor to the chicken as it heated through with the juices from the bacon and veggies, and the chicken was not bland as others had said.

Looking at what I had in my refrigerator inventory – I had bacon bits and skinless boneless chicken breasts – then looked on this site for recipes. This one I worked with tonight. Had regular tomatoes and green peppers, my husband won’t eat anything with mushrooms . . . and is not a fan of cilantro. So, first cooked chicken with garlic and onion powder and homemade taco seasoning (Allrecipe Taco Seasoning I - better than store bought. control salt) , removed from pan, took bacon bits (not imitation bacon) put in pan added a wee bit of water – till it steamed – then added cut up onion and green peppers. Sliced chicken – added to pan then added cut up tomato. Served with fresh cut up onion, tomato, salsa, shredded cheese, was pleased to find this recipe that worked great with what I had in stock!

Yummy! We made this & really enjoyed it! Seasoned the chicken with garlic/onion powder & pepper while cooking. We omitted mushrooms & cilantro(personal preference). Used salsa instead of tomatoes(like previous reviewers), but we only used about 1/4 cup. We will keep this in our dinner rotation..thanks for sharing :)

These were excellent.  We used a little parsley & lemon juice instead of the cilantro and it came out wonderful. I put salsa on mine and cheese would have been great.  Will defiantly make again.

Very delicious.  I would recommend frying the bacon by itself than removing the bacon to cool.  Add the rest of the ingredients as the directions state.  Dish was amazing!

I found this recipe when trying to use up some extra veggies I had in the house and it has become one of our family favorites.  The veggies add a lot of flavor and there really is no need for lots of extra seasoning.

Did some suggestions from past posts, like adding garlic, salt an pepper to the first cooking of chicken. I also added some corn, for additional taste and texture.

I made this last night just like the recipe. It tastes good but was little bland. Definitely will make again but just use more or different seasoning.

easy to make, although it lacks flavor.
