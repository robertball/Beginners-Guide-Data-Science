I was given a huge batch of persimmons from a friend's tree.   This was a perfect use for them.  I added a teaspoon of vanilla extract for sweetness and sprinkle them lightly with powder sugar as a desert perfection.  My family of picky eaters destroyed them at Thanksgiving.

I like the bumpy, crunchy tops.  However, I did sprinkle a bit of organic sugar on top to sweeten them and 1/4 c. raisins.  I think because the persimmons I added didnâ€™t seem sweet or ripened enough it lacked some sweetness.

I really like this recipe but I also didn't add any walnuts because not everyone in my family likes them so I just left them out. Otherwise I followed everything in the recipe and they turned out great I LOVE THEM!!!! However, the next time I make them I will probably add more cinnamon just because I love it otherwise they were perfect.

I found persimmons in the store and thought we would try them.My husband and son liked the muffins and I thought they were ok. There just wasn't enough persimmon flavor in them for me. The only change I made was to use gluten free flour.
