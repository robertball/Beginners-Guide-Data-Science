Great!  I used a 9x13 pan and it was done in exactly 30 minutes.  Although I did use 4 bananas, they were very small.  I'd recommend only 3 bananas if they are big.  No need to frost--it's moist and sweet enough as it is.  I love banana bread but often find it dry.  This cake solves that problem!

Amazing!!! I used sour cream instead of the buttermilk and it was so moist and tasted wonderful. I also used a chocolate frosting on it that is almost identicle to the "creamy chocolate frosting" on this site. The cake and frosting complimented eachother perfectly. In the middle i sliced fresh banana's and also used sliced banana's to create a flower pattern on the top. Not only did it look beautiful but it tasted amazing. Next time...instead of 8 inch pans i would prefer to use 9 or 10 so that there is not so much cake between the frosting layers. This recipe was superb though. No need to search for other banana recipes. :)

While the submitter suggests this recipe can also be used to make banana bread or muffins, I found this to be not as dense or compact a crumb as banana bread.  In other words, I happily found this to be a real banana cake, not banana bread posing as one. I am a huge fan of baked goods made with buttermilk - in my experience I've yet to make a recipe where the buttermilk didn't absolutely guarantee moist and delicious success. And it was the same with this recipe.  Bold banana flavor, fluffy, moist, and prettily speckled with brown flecks that made this perfect to frost with a chocolate frosting.  I used this recipe for 24 cupcakes and frosted them with "Chocolate Cream Cheese Frosting," also from this site.  It was a match made in heaven - they were one of those rare things you make that was so good, so delicious, it becomes  etched in your memory.  One criticism, however.   It would be helpful to have given an actual measurement in cups for the bananas, rather than "four bananas," since bananas can vary greatly in size and so, then, will the yield.  (I hope it's helpful that I've always found 1 banana=1/2 cup mashed bananas is a good rule of thumb)

Using this recipe for banana BREAD would be great - pretty perfect as is (I like that the recipe calls for butter vs. oil - bravo!)  For a banana CAKE, however, I think a more tender, soft texture is in order.  To accomplish this, I substituted cake flour in place of all-purpose flour.  And you just gotta have vanilla extract in a cake; I added 1 teaspoon.  And, dependent on the size of the bananas you've got, "4 ripe bananas" can yield anywhere from 1 cup to 1 1/2 cups of the stuff.  My 4 bananas amounted to 1 1/3 cups and this quantity worked fine.  I frosted the cake with a cream cheese frosting and pressed the walnuts onto the sides of the cake.  It cut beautifully and my guests (and I) loved it.

We had a potluck for someones birthday at work and she wanted a banana cake which I have never made or never eaten?! So I had no idea what to do since I am known as the cake maker in the office. I found this recipe and it was so yummy!!! I didn't change one thing except I did put crushed walnuts on top of the icing and used 5 bananas.TIP: My Mother-In-Law told me that if you have bananas that are really really ripe and you can't make anything out of them at the time you can freeze them and use them later for bread or whatever. So last summer I had frozen some and thought I would try them in this cake. It worked perfectly a little mushy to get in the bowl and you want to watch the strings on the bananas and get them off before you smoosh them. This cake got RAVE reviews and the girl loved her birthday cake! Thanks for another great recipe!!!

This is absolutely the best banana cake I have ever made/tasted.  Wow!  It was very moist and had a lot of banana flavor.  It seems like such a simple recipe by the ingredients, but it sure does make an impressive tasting cake.  This will be a family favorite for years to come.  Thanks for sharing.  UPDATE:  I'm still making this cake and getting RAVE reviews.  One group of people thought it was a bakery bought cake.  I also like to use the whipped cream cheese frosting on this site which is out of this world with this divine cake recipe.  Wow!!!

I absolutely LOVE THIS RECIPE!!!!  I made it in a 9x13-inch pan and substituted whipping cream for the buttermilk (I didn't have any buttermilk or vingegar to make my own) and it turned out heavenly.  I just can't say enough about how good this recipe is!  Thank you so much Kevin for sharing it with us!!  I'm off to have another piece...

I baked in 9x13 pan (took 40-45 minutes) and served as snack cake.  The family loved it!  It would make good dessert cake, too, by adding frosting.

This is a wonderful recipe, I made it for my sons birthday party.  It was exactly like the packaged banana cakes I used to have as a kid- which were so moist and sweet- it was wonderful!  I did make several changes based on the other reviews: 1. switched regular flour for cake flour (you need to add 2T extra for every cup), 2. switched heavy cream for buttermilk, 3. added 1t vanilla, 4. increased brown sugar to 1 cup, 5. put in 4.5 medium sized banana, 6. added 1t banana extract since my bananas were not overripe, 7. added 1T extra butter.  8. ommitted walnuts and frosted with cream cheese frosting on this site.  It was a  TRUE masterpiece.

I baked this cake in a 9x13" baking dish.  The flavor was ok, but not the best I've made.  Same with the texture: denser than a cake, but "sponge-ier" than banana bread would be.  Maybe best as muffins? I make banana bread/cake/muffins often to use up bananas at the end of the week.  Probably won't make this recipe again, as I have others my family likes more.

I was a little nervous about making a Banana Cake because I thought it would come out too dense like bread does. I was totally wrong. It is the perfect texture for a cake, the only things I did differently was that I added 1 tsp of vanilla extract and eliminated the walnuts in the batter. The cake turned out beatifully moist and with a light texture. I frosted it with some slightly sweetened whipped cream and then I pressed the chopped walnuts onto the sides of the cake. I took this to a baby shower and everyone said that it was absolutely delicious!!! UPDATE: Since making this back in September I've had at least 6 people calling me and asking for the recipe!!!

Delicious recipe.  I used 1 cup white & 1 cup brown sugar, added an extra egg, added 1 teaspoon vanilla & 1 teaspoon cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon baking powder & baked in a tube pan.  Will use many times when bananas go bad. Very sweet, really doesn't need frosting.

This cake was very moist and delicious. Melt in your mouth goodness! I made it to take to our New Year’s Eve gathering and everyone loved it.  This is the second time I have made this cake and it turned out great both times. This time I used sour cream in place of the buttermilk because that is what I had on hand. I also added 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract to the batter.  I baked in a bundt pan until a toothpick came out clean which took 30 minutes. I then drizzled with the vanilla glaze recipe from this site, using banana extract in place of the vanilla.  This is definitely a keeper! Thanks so much for the awesome recipe!

Ohhh; yum!  I forgot to add vanilla; though I'd planned on it) - did not put any extra spices as I'd wanted to see what it tasted like without them first.  Did not add the nuts as my stepson would not have eaten it then; though it would have been a nice additions. Used two extra large bananas.  Also seperated the eggs; and beat the whites to a stiff peak (lessen the amount of time to do this; use a hand beater with one beater; put the egg whites in a large cup; and put the beater on the highest speed; takes 60 seconds, tops with mine); then added the whites at the end; I do this with nearly all baked goods like cakes; etc.; lightens it quite a bit.     Also added one large grated apple to the batter at the end; just before folding through the egg whites; added a nice touch of flavour.  Will absolutelly make again, a huge hit with all the family!!

This recipe is great.  I added chocolate chips, made them into cupcakes, and frosted with a simple chocolate frosting. We ate them at a playgroup to celebrate my son's birthday, and both the kids and parents loved them.  Bake cupcakes for 20 min., makes about 24.

This smells so wonderful.  The smell woke up my husband, who's rather picky about banana cakes.  I decided to make this into a bundt - I baked it for about 45 minutes.  I used the Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe on this site - paired very nicely!

With so many wonderful praises I thought this recipe might be overated... Certainly not the case....this is THE BEST Banana Cake ever.  I baked in Baby Bundt pans for about half the time and they turned out excellent!!  Extremely moist and loads of great Banana flavor.

Taste great but I cooked it 30 min in a 9x13 and the center was not done.  I made the grave mistake of frosting it before testing and ruined the cake.  :-(  (We ate the edges)
If you change cake pan sizes adjust the cook time!!

This tasted great but turned out more like a banana bread rather than cake. It took 80mins to cook and I had to increase the heat to get it to cook through. I think there are too many banana's in this recipe. May try again by amending the quantities.

My husband loves banana bread but I had the worst luck making it - until I found this recipe!  Now I'm famous for it!!  I've never made it as a cake, but instead I use it for bread and muffins.  (I get one a loaf of bread and about 6 muffins with each batch, and it freezes very well). I always add more walnuts (at least double) but I follow the rest of the recipe exactly.  I make it so often I know it by heart.  THANK YOU!

Scrumptious Cake!  Bakes up beautifully golden brown.  I baked mine in a 9x13 pan and it took 35 minutes until done.  I made Banana Butter Icing from this site to ice it with.  Simply put, you can't go wrong with this cake! Thanks Kevin.

WOW! This recipe was incredibly simple and quite delicious. However, the directions could have been a little clearer. In addition, the recipe did not mention the baking time needed for muffins or other various techniques. I also found that more flour was needed in the recipe so that it would not be so sticky. I recommend you add an extra 2/3 of a cup flour. Furthermore, I was not exactly sure what to do with the bananas. All the recipe said to do was to add them. All in all I had a great time making this recipe and the finished product was wonderful. Chocolate chips are also a great addition to the recipe.

I think there's something wrong with the recipe. The butter is not enough to cream the sugar & I end up adding another half cup butter. Also the stated baking time is 1/2 hour which I take more than 1 1/2 hrs to bake!

Yum! Made this last week for a bday celebration. Delish!  Pretty much followed the recipe, but added a tsp of vanilla to the bananas, and added a few shakes of cinnamon in the flour mixture. Did this mostly to tie together the frosting since I knew I wanted the cinnamon cream cheese frosting with it. Did the whole thing for 40 minutes in a Bunt pan, let it rest about 15 minutes and then turned it out -- it came out perfectly! It was moist and wonderful. Loved by everyone. Making it again today for Easter dessert tomorrow!

I made this the other day and I must agree it was a really nice banana cake. The only quibble I might have with this is it was a tad on the sweet side for me and I LIKE sweet things so ... in the future I am going to reduce the white sugar in this to 3/4 cup instead of 1 cup. I did use buttermilk but I would also hazard a guess that this would be equally tasty and moist if you used cream or even milk ... maybe even plain greek yogurt instead.

I used 4 very ripe bananas and I also added vanilla cause imo every cake can benefit from vanilla :) Instead of white all purpose flour I used stone ground whole grain whole wheat cake and pastry flour and it made a very light fluffy moist end product.

So the short of it is .. I did make this recipe as listed with the exception of the vanilla and flour but in the future I will make the modifications I mentioned to take this from a 4 star which I think it is worth as written, to a 5 star adjusted for my personal tastes.

Excellent Banana Cake! Very moist yet light and tender. I used four small - medium bananas and it was perfect. Not overly sweet with great banana flavor. I made cupcakes and followed Naples34102 and topped them with the "Chocolate Cream Cheese Frosting" from this site. Perfect match!  Thanks for sharing!

OH my WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW.. this cake is excellent!! perfect as it is, I only decreased the brown sugar to 1/2 cup because I wanted to frost it.. Unlike other cakes, this DID NOT stick to the pan. I greased it generously with butter. I used to think that to have a moist cake it has to stick to the pan but now I know im wrong, this cake isnt like banana bread at all. its much lighter and moist. I omitted the walnuts because I wanted a good texture for a layer cake. This is greaaaaaaaaaaaat!!! I will upload a picture later. 
ps. for the frosting, used a recipe from this site. 9 ounces semisweet chocolate cut into cubes, 1 cup heavy cream. Put the cream in a saucepan, let it boil 10 seconds, then pour over the chocolate and let sit 15 seconds. Whisk until well blended. Let it cool then refrigerate for 45 minutes. Beat until fluffy
Forgot to say, dont forget to take of the strings from the bananas unless you want black worm looking things in your cake! oops! I forgot to take mine off

Wow!  My husband and I loved this cake! My 9x13 cake was done after 35 minutes so you may want to check it with a toothpick at that point.  I put a thin layer of cream cheese frosting and it has stayed wonderfully moist in the fridge.

Knockout flavor and texture. To lighten just a bit, added 1/2 tsp baking powder. For flavor, added 1/2 tsp vanilla extract and 1/4 tsp cinnamon for just a hint of taste that complements the bananas. Baked in a greased/floured 9"X13" pan for 45 minutes, turned out and when cool, frosted with cream cheese frosting. DYNAMITE!! Be certain to test for doneness with a toothpick or skewer. A few tiny clinging crumbs are OK, but if what remains on the toothpick is any wetter than that, set the timer for another 5 minutes and repeat your test. This avoids the middle sinking and that area being "doughy." Thanks for posting this recipe, which is a keeper and a sure-fire winner.

I used this to make banana bread and it was right on target!  Didn't even change one thing.  I halved the recipe to make one loaf (which was perfect) and it couldn't have been any better.  Out of all the banana breads I've made, this one is by far the best yet.

I was a little hesitant about this recipe despite the good reviews as I could not imagine what a banana cake might be like. I am impressed. It was easy and baked up well in a 9X13 pan. I used half and half with vinegar instead of the buttermilk and put on a basic cream cheese frosting. It was delicious and half of it is already gone. This is a keeper!

It's a keeper folks, just as written.   Yes, as KELLYLWARN suggests, sour cream is a great substitute if you don't have buttermilk, and if you have a nut allergy, you can substitute chocolate chips.  definitely do a chocolate icing and experiment from there.  Make sure you use a non terrycloth moist t-towel and not a cooling rack because the cake is very moist and sticks to the racks.

This is the best banana cake I've evey tasted!  It's just sweet enough but not overpowering.  I baked it in a 9 x 13 glass dish, made a simple cream cheese frosting, and watched it disappear.

This was fantastic. We were looking for a lighter texture than a banana bread, and this is perfect. We topped it with 7 minute frosting.

Very tasty and moist. I will try again.  I was really surprised at 1 tablespoon of baking soda, but I followed the recipe except, as many before me, substituted sour cream for buttermilk plus added 1 teaspoon lemon extract and 1/4 cup of milk.   Baked it at 350 in 9x13 glass pan.  It took about another 20 minutes to cook and the top was brown, sides over done with the middle seeming not quite done.  The middle sagged after cooling.  I am sure this is because of the amount of baking soda. Never seen that much in a cake recipe.  Next time I will reduce the soda and add some baking powder.

YUMMY!!! This was delicious!  I added chocolate chips instead of the nuts, cooked it in a bundt pan (+/- 45 minutes) and topped it with chocolate cream cheese frosting (8oz cream cheese, 1/4 cup butter, 4 cups powdered sugar and 1/2 cup cocoa powder).  Thanks for the great recipe!!!

Just popped the two pans in the oven.  Like others, I reduced the brown sugar to 1/2 c.  due to the sweetness of the Bananas.  I also added 1tsp. Vanilla extract.   Used sour cream in place of the buttermilk.  Batter was very tasty. not too sweet.  Will repost with final outcome.  Wish me luck!!:)  (will give a final rating based on outcome) when layers cooled, I brushed each side with banana liquor then spread creamcheese frosting then placed sliced bananas on top of that. Placed the other layer on top and iced.  Daughter and I thought the cake came out really good. Thanks for the recipe! It inspired me to bake today!

Delicious recipe.  I had this recipe years ago from a friend but lost it.  I was so glad to find it on Allrecipes.  The 4 bananas makes the cake extra moist and full of flavor.  I actually added a 5th banana cut into slices after I had the batter mixed.  The big banana hunks were extra flavor and everyone at the office pot luck enjoyed the big banana bites.

we had so many bananas turning black!  never made a banana cake before so i decided to try this one.  it seemed just slightly more delicate than a regular banana bread.  i didn't have any unsalted butter so i used regular salted butter but forgot to omit salt - it was fine; used skim milk w/a quarter teaspoon of vinegar for buttermilk; used immersion blender to puree bananas; added 1 tsp. vanilla; omitted nuts because i don't like them and baked in bundt pan greased and sprinkled with a cinnamon sugar mixture (a great idea that i found right here on allrecipes!)  this is a great cake/bread!  so moist and delicious!  maybe next time i'll try frosting it before it gets gobbled up!  thank you kevin ryan for sharing this recipe!**UPDATE: made this recipe again - this time with salted butter (omitted salt), 3/4 c milk chocolate chips, walnuts, 1 t vanilla, 1 t banana extract (from thai market) and sour cream.  baked in muffin tins lined w/paper liners and sprinkled a cinnamon sugar mixture liberally on tops before baking.  very good but i think the buttermilk is better. **

I made half a recipe and replaced milk with plain fat free yogurt and walnuts with sunflower seeds as I didn't have walnuts. I like bananas so I used 4 bananas. The batter was enough to make 12 large muffins. They were very moist and heavy......yum-yum. My hubby has requested that I make them again tomorrow. I think this time I will use a round pan or loaf pan. :) Thanks a lot.

After being up all night with a sick baby, my 7 year old cheerfully reminded me that I was suppose to bake banana cake for the company that was coming for dinner.
Now I am the baker in the family, but I hadn't baked anything in along time plus I was lacking sleep so I had my doubts as to how well the finished product was going to be. In spite of those two facts, the double batch of banana cake (I had a lot of bananas to use up!)I made using this recipe came out wonderfully.
Making a double batch gave me roughly 2 9x13 sized cakes (one was a bit smaller, so the kids and hubby got to eat that all week instead of the company) 
I did add about a 1/4 cup extra butter b/c when I creamed the sugars and butter together, it looked a bit dry to me. I added some cinnamon also and like some of the others who have posted reviews, it took longer to bake that what is stated in the recipe. I cheated on the frosting and used a canned cream cheese one, next time I use this recipe-and I will without a doubt- I will make a cream cheese one from this site.

Since finding this recipe several weeks ago I've made it so many times I can do it in my sleep. It's easy, fast and wonderfully moist and delicious. Everybody loves it and begs me for more...we'll they don't actually beg me, but you get the point. I tried it w/ cream cheese frosting and it's just a little too sweet. Maybe I'll try to invent some kind of banana / chocolate crumble thingie on it but it's great as it is right out of the pan, which is usually about as far as this cake gets around my house!

Delicious!!! I was looking for a good banana cake recipe to use up some of the bananas in my freezer and this is just what I was looking for! Made 24 cupcakes and baked them for 20 minutes.  I was going to add cinnamon and vanilla as some previous reviewers had but forgot and it tasted great without it!  I frosted the cupcakes with  cream cheese frosting and pecans.  I’ve already received request to make them again!

Good cake!  I cut it in 1/2 & baked in in an 8x8.  I omitted the egg due to my "Little Cheese" (my nickname for my son Colby) being allergic, and used an extra banana & a 1/2 tsp of baking powder.  Very moist, I liked the fact that there is no oil.  I topped it with allspice cream cheese frosting (from this site), next time I'll do muffins.  Thanks Kevin!

Very good cake.  Very moist.  Also very popular with my friends and family.  They wanted the recipe.  The cream cheese icing was also a big hit.   I used almost 1 cup of chopped pecans instead of walnuts just because I like pecans better.  Great.  THanks

Lots of sugar and lots of banana's, throw in some eggs and thats about it. A very sweet gooey cake. I don't rate it at all, neither did my flatmates. I have made lots of banana cakes.

I made this for the first time yesterday and layered it with cream cheese icing (frosting). Using five very old mushy bananas I surprised myself and our baby girls  who insisted on licking the bowl, spoons and everything else it came in contact with (a good sign they liked the mixture). The finished product was a hit, it was light and moist and the cream cheese icing gave it that extra delicious component to the cake. For a beginner cook, this recipe is easy, quick and and hassle free. Icing certainly gives the cake that extra wow fact but not necessary.
PS: Instead of walnuts, I added raisins, chocolate chips and chopped almonds.

Perfect! I wouldn't change a thing. Its moist and fluffy and has a very wholesome flavour. Personally, I only used 1/2 a cup of sugar and i found it just sweet enough. I also used plain yogurt instead of buttermilk and it worked just fine. Love this recipe, will use again!

I've been making banana "bread" for 20 years trying different recipes and they have been good, but this recipe for banana "cake" hands down is the best ever - I used another reviewers suggestion to substitute buttermilk for sour cream and I added pecans & chocolate chips, no frosting - So moist and tasty - I also baked it in a bundt pan - I did have to bake it about 10 min longer - Delicious

This is a great easy recipe!  The ingredients are ones you'll have on hand (except possibibly the buttermilk-just substitue milk w/about tsp. white vinegar).  Not sure why some think it is too sweet.  We loved it.  I baked in a bundt pan for 40-45 min.

this was my first banana cake and it turned out quite well.  i made cupcakes and mini cupcakes and found the baking time to be 15 mins for the cupcakes, 9-10 for the mini's.  i made cream cheese frosting, tinted it several different colors, put it in sandwich baggies with the tips cut off and let my daughter and neice go to town decorating.  we topped them with chocolate sprinkles.  very yummy!  i also subbed sour cream for the buttermilk (didn't have buttermilk on hand!)  thanks!

I made this cake for my dad's birthday and it was a big hit. It was soft and moist and the perfect cake consistency. I disagree with some of the other reviews saying that it is too sweet for icing. I used cream cheese icing, and it certainly worked. I will make this again next year.

I tend to have an excess of bananas that I don't know what to do with.  So this is the perfect recipe for me.  I made them in muffin form.  They're very forgiving.  I accidentally put the second batch in at 400F and b/c I caught them in time, they were just a little browner on top, but still thoroughly cooked in the middle.  At 350F, the muffins cooked in about 20 min.  This recipe is so much better than the last one I found on FN.  I'll be making these again.

For an amazing cake, follow recipe and bake in 9x13 pan.  When cake has finished baking, spread 3/4 cups of creamy peanut butter on top and allow to cool completely.  When cake has finished cooling, cover with chocolate topping.
chocolate topping: 12oz bag of semisweet chocolate chips and 2 tbs of shortening (no substitutions), microwave at 50% power for 1:15 min, additional intervals of 15 sec may be added, until chips melt after being stirred.
Makes a banana dandy (or tandy) cake. amazing.

I used this recipe to make muffins and they are delicious! The recipe yields about 2 dozen muffins and you bake them at 350 for about 20 minutes. Its is very sweet so you may want to reduce the sugar about 1/4 cup or so. The only change I made was to add a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg and omit the walnuts just because I was feeding my toddlers. These are very moist and yummy and I will definitely use this recipe again!

I'm not much of a banana lover but this cake was wonderful! I followed the recipe to the T and it turned out GREAT! Very moist and held together nicely. I baked it in a bundt pan and I did pour a little powdered sugar glaze over the top and added some chopped walnuts on top. It presented nicely & tasted fabulous! This recipe is definitely a keeper!!! Thanks! (see pic I uploaded of this cake)
***Update- I'm still making this fabulous cake but just wanted to share that I made it with 2/3 cup strong coffee in place of the buttermilk (only because I had no milk, cream or anything in the house). It turned out wonderful & was a little lighter in texture. Very good! Love this recipe!

Oh my goodness!!!!  This cake was awesome!!  I made this for a family gathering and it got rave reviews.  We ended up eating it without frosting, although it would have been good that way too.  I made the batter exactly as written and I baked it in a 9x13 pan for about 45 minutes. As others had mentioned, it has more of a banana bread quality to it, but it is great as a cake.  I don't know how this would turn out in a loaf pan, but it would make a great banana bread.  I will definitely be making this again.

Absolutely fabulous.  wouldn't change anything. The buttermilk gives it the right amount if moisture.  I followed the recipe exactly, and it was perfect; not to mention a complete hit.  Someone bought the whole thing at a local bake sale!!  Thanks for sharing such a great recipe!

I give this recipe 5 stars for simplicity and overall nice taste.  This is the recipe to make with those overripe bananas that you never got around to eating.  Plus, you probably have all the ingredients at home.  I baked in 9x13 at 350 for 35 minutes (I like my top a bit brown)  I had a piece this morning (have kept in refrigerator for almost a week now)and it still tastes fresh - tastes like banana snack cake/muffin.

This was fantastic!!!  I almost followed the recipe exactly... but... I just have a hard time following ANY recipe exactly. :)

I added 1 tsp of vanilla and used 2/3 cup of sour cream instead of buttermilk.  I omitted the nuts because Mr. U doesn't like them.  I frosted this with cream cheese icing when I was finished.

I made this because we had family in town visiting. We all loved this moist and delicious cake!

His,
Mrs. U

I made this in a 9 X 13; Added 1 tsp vanilla, sour cream in place of buttermilk. Topped with cream cheese pudding mix: Beat 4 oz of cream cheese until fluffy. Add 1/4 cup powder sugar, 2.5 oz instant vanilla pudding, 5/8 cup milk, mix. Then fold in 6 oz cool whip. This frosting goes with any cake.

My children absolutely love this cake!  I usually substitute applesauce for the butter and egg beaters for the eggs. This cake still holds together well with the low fat alterations.

my very first banana cake with this recipe at Thanksgiving.  Everyone loved it so much!!  It is moist and soft.  Only I found it is a bit too sweet.  I will cut down the sugar next time I make it.

This cake is in the running for best cake I have ever tasted.  It is incredibly moist without being oily.  It is great paired with sour cream chocolate frosting.  I can not praise this cake enough.

This cake is perfect. I tried it for a change to our usual cakes in my shop. We have customers wanting healthier food, but still sweet. I cut the sugar like others suggested, plus added vanilla and 2tbl of milled flaxseed. The finished result turnes a rich brown color and the taste is great! People will never know its health food. I have a pan that has six small bundt molds and it fills those plus three small loaf pans. Some for the shop some for us! Thanks for sharing this great recipe.

This is the best banana cake I have ever had.  I had a great banana bread recipe I used for years but this is better.  Only change I have made is to bake it in a 9x13 pan and use sour cream instead of buttermilk.  I have made it for partys & co-worker. Everyone loves it -- never fail -moist & delicious.

This cake is awesome! I frosted it with Debra Steward's Chocolate Fudge Buttercream Frosting (on this site) and then pressed chopped toasted hazelnuts into the sides of the cake. It was fabulous! Instead of largely chopped walnuts, I ground the nuts in the blender, which gave the cake a great texture. I should also mention that I made this cake on a Thursday, wrapped the layers in plastic, transported them several hours in the car, frosted them on Saturday morning and served the cake Saturday night - it traveled incredibly well and was the moistest cake I've ever made. You just can't go wrong with this one, and it is now a part of my permanent recipe collection. Thanks!

We all thought this was a great recipe. I used half whole wheat flour/half white. Then used applesauce in place of half of the butter. Didn't have buttermilk so used the skim milk+lemon juice combo. Also was out of nuts (would have liked to have them). I baked them in muffin tins and it made 3 dozen mini muffins + 3 dozen normal sized muffins. Baked minis for 10 min and others for 20. It is very sweet, we liked that but I don't think that frosting would be a good idea. Overall good recipe and pretty low in fat!

This was very good but would consider it more of a bread than cake. I also made it in a 9x13 pan and baked about 35 minutes. I didn't use any frosting since others had mentioned how sweet it was but would have liked it to be a little lighter, less dense for a cake. Maybe it would have seemed more a dessert if I would have added frosting. Anyway my family loved it as a breakfast bread and it was very easy to make.

This is a great way to use up ripe bananas.  I made it in a 9x12 pan, but was afraid it was going to turn out too plain. I jazzed it up a bit with a cream cheese frosting and some mini chocolate chips on top. It looked very pretty. My family liked it a lot, although I prefer unfrosted cakes a bit more.

Great recipe Kevin.  I made it as you wrote it, frosted and filled it with fresh cream cheese frosting.  I put sliced bananas between the layers and a few on top, sprinkled it with crushed walnuts.  It was moist, tender, nice texture and flavor.... and a gorgeous cake.

This one's a keeper. I had a recipe my mom gave me... but for some reason it never tasted "like mom's." My old recipe and this one vary only slightly, but what a difference! I did make this in a loaf dish (2), I think I had to cook them longer... for about an hour... I have also made muffins and those came out just as good too.

I have made this recipe twice. My entire family loved and my friends have asked me for the recipe. I did change a little bit, instead of buttermilk I used heavy cream. Excellent recipe A+++.

Needed to use some ripe bananas, couldn't resist after all the raves. Wonderful cake! I used a hand mixer and added about 1/2 cup extra flour as another reviewer suggested. I also had to use up some extra shredded coconut and added one cup. I also added 1/2 cup Bacardi Rum (little less buttermilk then) and made it into a  rum cake.
This recipe is great on it's own, but I jazzed it up. Frosted it with vanilla/coconut frosting.
Yummy!!  Does bake a bit dark in color.

I have used this recipe for all 8 birthday parties for my boys over the last 4 years. It's a big hit and sooooo good with cream cheese frosting. I make it as cupcakes. I don't plan on making anything different unless and until the boys ask for something different. 
The texture is so nice and moist. I hate dry cake.

I baked this in a 10x14 pan. It should have baked more quickly, but after a full 30 minutes the middle was still completely mushy. It didn't bake. I tasted an edge and it was insanely sweet.

I just made these, as cupcakes instead of the 8" cakes. They took about 16 minutes to bake. I could have probably filled 26 cupcake papers but squeezed it into 24....some have very large tops! They are definitely not even close to the density of a banana bread, they are moist, light and fluffy with almost no crumb. I will certainly make these again. I am planning to make a yogurt frosting to top them for a snack at my daughter's preschool.

OMG! Awesome banana cake! Search no more...I've tried so many recipes, my head spins just to think about it. Well that's it for me, I am sold. The kids who aren't big amateur of banana dessert, unless they are my banana-chocolate muffins that I've been making since forever, just could'nt get enough. I only change one thing on the recipe. Since we watch our sugar intake, I cut the sugar by half and it's just perfect!!! Try it you'll love it!!!

Amazing recipe. This was a spur of the moment decision to make this cake (because we had two bananas that we didn't want to go to waste.) So, I looked up some recipes..stumbled upon this one, and decided to give it a try. Awesome decision. We only had two bananas, and it turned out fabulous. My husband & I were actually fighting over who got what of the cake this evening (there wasn't much left :-) So, to sum it up...I will absolutely make this recipe again. Thanks for sharing!

I made this recipe for the first time but only had 2 bananas, used half white/half whole flour, used 1%milk with 1T vinegar and added the walnuts.  Made the fluffiest batter I've ever seen and made into 12 large muffins.  Now, these are absolutely the BEST!
I will definitely re-use this recipe!

Very good just as written. Everyone whined that no icing was used until they ate it without the icing. It really does not need icing.

I know I'm not supposed to rate something if I've adapted the recipe, but I really needed to share! I love this recipe! Don't care if it is cake, muffin, or bread it's delicious! Lots of banana flavour! The only changes were cutting out the brown sugar and reducing the white sugar to 3/4 c.  Still sweet and yummy! I also forgot the walnuts, but I didn't miss them too much.  I want to try pecans next time though.  Oh and this was a gluten free flour mix ... not too dense at all!

A very moist, delicious banana CAKE! I am very happy with how this recipe turned out. Instead of a 2 - 8 inch round cake pan I made 24 cupcakes. The ingredients were easy to put together. I used salted butter, therefore, omitting the salt. The cake itself was very moist and fluffy. The best part is the taste - very nice bananay flavor throughout! I could see the speckled brown flecks insdie the cake.  The buttermilk always makes for a moist cake. I also had 3 medium ripe bananas and a small one so I cut up the small one into small dices and added it into the batter altogether. My cupcakes were baked in 22 minutes, then cooled. Although I could have eaten this just as is, I decided to top it off with, "Chocolate Frosting I," from this website. Next time I will make this with cream cheese frosting.

This is the best Banana Cake recipe I have tried. Very versatile and easy, no long baking time and stores well, though it usually is eaten pretty fast around here. I use a ripe banana and whip it with with icing sugar for a special creamy icing, and the consistency can be adjusted easily by how much icing sugar is added. Again very simple and people think it is some sort of deluxe dessert that I slaved and spent a fortune on.

Really good, will make again.  My very picky son asked for more.  I used chocolate chips instead of nuts and would do this again as it was really good.  We did not frost this-found no need to.  Great way to use up those old bannanas.  I think I like this version better than banana bread and it was very easy to make.  I am not a great baker and found this easy to make.

I wouldn't consider this a cake.  I would consider it banana bread with frosting.  It was pretty good.  I did alter it by doing half wheat flour and half white flour, 2 egg whites and 1 whole egg, and added 1 tsp vanilla.

Fantastically light cake-can be eaten 'as-like' or I top with cream cheese frosting.  MMMM.. I do use 4 bananas; whether they are large or small; it doesn't matter.. they just have to be RIPE.. oh,.. and I use sour cream to replace the buttermilk.. just too much sour cream on hand! ;0)

I mixed everything and added 4 tbls danish strawberry preserve, 2 tbls heavy cream. Dusted with cane sugar and drizzled cognac over top before baking!! My kids and husband OVERATE!!! Try it..... Super moist and YUMMO....

This was a great cake and better paired with chocolate butter cream frosting. Due to some constraints of the night, I substituted unsalted stick margarine for butter, and  made soy buttermilk (2/3 tsps of lemon juice to plain soy milk). Granted that margarine doesn't play nicely with other frosting ingredients- but that's at my own discretion. I also used 2- 9 inch cake pans, sliced them into layers and made a 4 layer cake Everyone loved the cake. seriously. I have nothing bad to say about the cake batter at all. totally rockin'

Delicious! I had a near disaster when I went to measure out my flour and found I only had a cup and a bit left in the bag, so I substituted the rest with buttermilk pancake mix! I also didn't have buttermilk and just used normal milk. I may have added slightly less milk. It turned out amazing in the end, nice and fruity and moist. I love this cake so much I'm waiting for my bananas to ripen so that I can make it again! I'm going to try muffins next time.

the butter and sugar failed to cream the first time. internet research indicated that the ratio of butter to sugar is too low. reduced brown sugar to 1/2cup instead. cake turned out beautifully (cooked in 40-45min; made 1 8-inch pan and 5 muffins in total) however, i still find it a little too sweet. will reduce sugar to 1.5cup next time i try.

This was very tasty!  I used large bananas and instead of buttermilk used plain non-fat yogurt and I think this made the cake extra moist - and it was SOOO good! I simply spinkeled powedered sugar on top so as to not make the cake too sweet with icing.  Great recipe, would recommend!

Banana cake is my favorite, and this is the best I've had! Typically I make it with half a recipe of Sour Cream Chocolate Frosting from this site. This past time I topped it with the peanut butter icing from this recipe, and it took it to another level! I swapped the nuts for chocolate chips for my chocolate fix. http://www.sprinklebakes.com/2012/04/peanuts-in-my-coke-cocoa-cola-cupcakes.html

Big hit with everyone. I used sour cream instead of buttermilk and used the Hersheys icing recipe on the back of the cocoa box. I also sliced some bananas in the middle of the cake. YUMMY.

Wonderful banana cake recipe! This one will be my go to from now on. I subbed sour cream for the buttermilk and it rose nicely with the 1 tbsp of baking soda. Nice and moist, delicious with a lemon cream cheese frosting (8oz cream cheese, 1/4 cup softened butter, 1 cup confectioner's sugar, 1 tsp lemon extract). Yum!

I just made this last night.  What a great alternative to standard "banana bread".  I substituted the buttermilk equally for plain yogurt; baked it in a bundt pan (added an extra 15 minutes to the baking time). I was VERY moist - we didn't even need the frosting. My coworkers ate the cake in a matter of minutes!

I had a really great banana cake recipe which I make all the time.  Right before Christmas, I made it and then promptly lost my recipe.  I had an order today for two of them, and I've looked everywhere and simply can't find my recipe.  So I searched allrecipes and this was the closest I could find to it.  So last night I tried it, making just one change.  I used all white sugar, no brown sugar.  And it was great.  Looks almost exactly like my recipe.  I couldn't taste it but it looked really moist.  So thanks again, Allrecipes and thank you, Kevin!

I made this cake for our church pot luck and it went over wonderfully! I had comments that it was very good.  I will be keeping this in the front of the recipe index box ;)  I added an additional banana, and because I had no buttermilk, I used milk mixed with vinigar.  Thanks for the recipe!

wow... i used 3/4 of the recipe and made banana bread (~45 min baking time), was short of 1 tbsp of butter so i sub applesauce for that.  I did everything else the same except that I used a bit less sugar and had some trouble creaming the butter... how do you cream butter w/ a hand whisk w/ soooo much sugar?  It turns crumbly!  Anyway... i t wasn't really a concern at the end and it turned out delicious... very moist, light but not greasy.My bf wants me to make it every week now... oh no... haha.

This cake was amazingly moist and dense and delicious.  I used half oil and half yogurt instead of butter, used a little less sugar, and added a bit of vanilla, and it turned out scrumptious!  We put cream cheese frosting on it, but it is fabulous without it too.

The batter yielded 20 small/medium muffins. They were done after 20 mins of baking. The muffins were light and fluffy but too sweet even after I reduced the amount of white sugar to 3/4 cup. Great recipe!

I "veganized" this recipe (no eggs and/or dairy); I also cut back on the sugar, probably 1/4 less than called for total (but added 1/2 C. dark chocolate chips).  The batter was really sweet to me (the beauty of vegan baking -- 100% SAFE raw batter :P!!), but after all was said and done the cake really "mellowed" out after about a day.  I frosted it with [vegan] "cream cheese" frosting and the two went perfectly together.  I will definately make this again ^_^

O.K. I am not the best baker in the world so I followed the recipe as written.  Unfortunately, 30 minutes was not enough time for a 9x13 pan.  Mine came out uncooked in the center...what a mess.  The outer portion was done and tasted pretty good; however, I was so mad that the middle was undercooked that I only gave this three stars!

Wow this is my families favorite banana cake recipe!  I have been using it for years and am just now joing so I can start reviewing recipes!  This cake is so moist and full of flavor.  I love to top it with home made cream cheese icing.  If you don't ice it is great warmed up for breakfast.  Thanks for sharing!

This truly is a terrific recipe and very versatile.  I use it to make banana whoopie pies with peanutbutter filling.  They're better than peanutbutter and banana sandwiches!  Thanks for sharing Ryan.

I made this recipe in a bundt pan and added cinnamon to the dry ingredients and vanilla to the wet ingredients.  About a teaspoon of each.  I also topped it with a double recipe of the cream cheese frosting found in the Clone of a Cinnabon recipe on this website.  I added a splash of orange/banana juice to the frosting to make it the consistency of a glaze.  This cake is extremely moist and flavorful!

Very good, very light and moist. One of the better banana cake recipes! Made it in a 9 x 13" pan and baked it for 40 minutes. Have also made it in a large bundt pan and baked it for 55 minutes. Will definitely keep this in my recipe box.

Really good banana cake! I also used a cream cheese frosting which was ideal. I ran out of bananas, but would have liked to put slices inbetween the layers.

Good flavor.  Came out a bit denser than expected.  It was like banana bread with frosting.  My banana bread recipe with sour cream is moister and closer to cake than this one.  I have had better than this.

Very moist and has a great banana flavor.  It was just what I needed to get rid of some overripe bananas.  I used the banana cream icing recipe that is posted here.

Made this cake for my husbands birthday at Christmas.  Only change was I added a cup of black walnuts.  My daughters thought it didn't have a very strong banana flavor and I souldn't have used the brown sugar.  After much thought, I think maybe the bananas were't ripe enough.  Cake was very moist and I will make again with riper bananas.  Thanks for the recipe.

It was a success at my first attempt as it's really simple.  I added extra mashed bananas and also sliced bananas to make to make really authentic.  Need more baking time though, about 20-30 mins more, by this time you will have some dry crust to it.  I recommend that you wrap your cake tin with greaseproof paper / patchment paper to prevent hard crust forming.  I will serve it as a dessert next time, slightly warm (in microwave) with toffee sauce.  All the best!

Made this the first time by the recipe, except added a little cinnamon.  Didn't need frosting.  This time, used coconut oil instead of butter, Splenda instead of white sugar (still used the brown) and almond milk with apple cider vinegar instead of buttermilk, baked in a 9x13 pan.  Turned out great, again!

Wow! Actual banana cake, not bread. Light & tender cake. Our cake wasn't too sweet, even though the bananas were way past overripe. I used a 9x13" pan, baked for 30 minutes, frosted with cinnamon cream cheese frosting.

This has been a family favorite for years! I've made it as a layer cake, a sheet cake, cupcakes, loaves. It doesn't matter - it is moist, sweet and delicious every time. Sometimes we don't even frost it, it is wonderful on it's own but cream cheese frosting really adds something special.

I used kefir instead of buttermilk and it turned out just delicious! Also used chocolate chips instead of nuts. Having the first piece right now while it's still warm. It is delicious, and one for the 'keeper' file!

This is a family favorite and we've been making it for years, and it's one of the best cakes you'll ever eat!  I can't tell you how many times it's been requested by our children and even coworkers for their birthdays!  We bake 40 - 45 minutes in a 9x13 stoneware pan.  We never use nuts.  And if we frost it we always make "Whipped Cream Cream Cheese Frosting" from this website (which is easy and comes out perfect every time too!)

This worked amazing!   I had some banana's that were going off so I used what I had at home.  I used 2% milk instead of buttermilk and baking powder as opposed to soda and it tasted wonderful.  Thank you for sharing!

A deliciously moist cake. I had only one issue with this recipe,... it needed more time to bake perfectly, about 45 - 50 mins

Absolutely delicious. I modified because I was out of walnuts ... instead, I grated a bar of semi-sweet chocolate ... oh my!  Try it.

Delicious and simple recipe.  I love recipes that use buttermilk, because I love the resulting texture of the cake.  Unfortunately I was out of buttermilk when I started making this cake.  In place of buttermilk I used equal portions of milk and yogurt and added 1 teaspoon of lemon juice and let sit for 5 to 10 minutes. The end result was a moist , light and airy cake.  The first day the cake tasted good , next day better, and even better the third day after refrigating and frosting with creamcheese frosting.  I will definitely make this cake again, next time I will add some chocolate chips to the batter.

This was the best banana cake I've ever had!  I put it in a 2 loave pans for banana bread.  VERY moist!  Everyone loved it.  Didn't have unsalted butter, so omitted the salt and put in salted butter, and it tasted fine.

PERFECT! Don't change a thing, seriously. The only thing that should be optional is walnuts, especially if this cake is being served to people with nut allergies.

If you eat it right away, it has a much more fluffy consistency.  If you eat it the next day, it gets thicker - not a bad thing, the taste stays the same, it is just heavier.

Wow, so yummy!  Moist without being incredibly dense.  The flavor was the best banana cake I have had.  Was very good w/ cream cheese frosting but really would have been amazing without it too.

Awesome recipe! I was searching for a banana cake recipe that would taste just like Entenmanns Banana Crunch cake and this was it!! I added a brown sugar, flour & butter crumb topping ( for the crunch)  then melted semi-sweet chocolate chips and drizzled it over the top and tada there it was! I think it is even better, thanks for a terrific recipe. I did add 1 tsp of vanilla as suggested by another reviewer because I too feel everything is better with vanilla!

Very good and fluffy even though I had no unsalted butter and used regular butter. Also I used two 9x5 inch loaf tins @ 325 for 55 minutes (I knew this would work from previous recipes)

Delicious and moist.  I used sifted cake flour, but I'm not even sure that was necessary.  This cake was delicious and makes fabulous muffins or bread as well.

Fabulous. I used peacans instead of walnuts and ten minutes into baking, added a "ring" of peacans on the top, then glazed everything with a brown sugar and butter glaze. The result was a beautiful golden brown finish. For a thicker cake, I used an 8" round baking dish. If you prefer it to be a little thinner, I'd recommend something larger, say, a 9 or 10"-- doesn't have to be round though.

I modified this awesome recipe to make it a bit more healthy and it turned out GREAT!  I used 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce instead of butter, eggbeaters instead of eggs and (don't gasp) cottage cheese for buttermilk. I also used cake flour and added 1tsp vanilla. One last thing - I used 1/2 each white and brown sugars. I baked it in a 9x13 pan and it cooked in less than 30 minutes Can you say YUM!

I had 5 small overripe bananas left over and found this recipe. It was a snap to put together. I didn't have any walnuts to add in or buttermilk so I used part plain yogurt and milk and folded in a  cup semi-sweet chocolate chips and three quarters of a cup toasted coconut.I baked it in a 9 x 13 pan and it came out great.The chips and coconut added a whole new level to the taste. I dusted it with a bit of powdered sugar and used as a snack cake.

I just took my first bite and this was very moist and melts in your mouth (in a good way)!  I followed everything except I didn't use as much white sugar because I didn't want to risk having a too-sweet banana cake.  The next time I make this I plan on putting twice as many walnuts!

I just tried the recipe yesterday and it became a Yummy Sunday for all of us!! A delicious recipe with just perfect sweetness! Just that I replaced buttermilk with equal amount of milk and in stead of crushed walnuts I put crushed almonds.

It turned out exra delicous and my family (and I) loved it.

Very good recipe, nice and moist.  I used 2/3 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown and that was plenty sweet, because as you know the bananas add sweetness also.  I also used five bananas and added chocolate chips, really tasty.

This is a wonderful banana cake recipe.  I have made these several times as a cake or muffins and they have always come out perfect.  I add 1 tsp vanilla and instead of nuts I add a cup or so of chocolate chips.  The kids love it!

Moist and just sweet enough, made this with crushed peanuts instead of walnuts and it turned out very good. Topped it with the oatmeal-nut-sugar crunch topping featured on another recipe here (banana crunch cake). Yummy

I cut the sugar per the suggestions of others, threw in an extra banana -my 5 year old was 'helping'- iced it with a buttercream sprinkled with toffee bits.  Very nice cake.  Moist, good flavour.

This banana cake is a winner !!  Did as others suggested and used cake flour . I used presto and made the  adjustments as stated on the box. Made it in a bundt pan and baked it for 45 minutes.
I also mixed the bananas with a hand mixer until it is  uniformly mushy  before adding it to the batter. As for the butter and sugar if you are patient you will get the light and fluffy consistancy referred to in the directions.
The cake was very light and moist i used lowfat buttermilk as i cannot find whole buttermilk. Frosted it with cream cheese frosting but wish i had left if off because the cake really didn't need any.

Good cake, but I changed it a bit.  I added 3/4 cup of pecans instead of walnuts, half a bag of mini chocolate chips, & baked it in a bundt pan for 50 minutes.  After it had cooled, I melted about 1/3 of a can of ready made chocolate frosting & drizzled it over the top. I took it to a party & everyone wanted the recipe.  Very moist.

Great recipe! I didn't have any butter so I used margarine at it still turned out delicious. I made the cake one day ahead and wrapped it in cling wrap for a whole night to get the cake all moist and soft. Omitted the white sugar to half, left out the walnuts, and added in s few dashes of All Spice.Later I frosted it with chocolate ganache at it was yummm,yumm,yummm! I prefer chilling it first before eating it. A keeper!

I love this recipe, it makes moist and flavorful muffins that don't need frosting. 
This is even better( in my opinion) than the offical Robin Hood flour website recipe for Banana Bread.  Freezes well too, thanks for a SUPER recipe Kevin.

Excellent - I will keep this recipe as the one I always use.
I added chocolate chips and it was delicious.  I had to cook it a little longer than recommended.  It rises quite a bit so don't fill the muffin or cake pans all the way.

This is an absoultely scrumptious cake, muffin, bread, whatever you decide! I made it into a cake and added a sprinkle of cinnamon and a tsp of vanilla.  Served it with cream cheese icing and got rave reviews!  It stored in the frige very well and we would warm up a piece in the microwave when desired.  Thank you for this amazing recipe!

I make this cake today and it was good. Instead of buttermilk I used low fat plain yogurt and ommitted the nuts as my kid dont like nuts and make it into muffins. Will make it again in the near future.

I had 4 overripe bananas and decided to give this recipe a try.  Delicious & very moist.  I added 6 oz. semi-sweet chocolate chips and frosted (not really necessary) it with our favorite deep chocolate frosting.  My husband loved it!  He refuses to eat cakes that are the least bit dry so this one is a keeper!  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Excellent recipe!  It was very easy to make and was very moist and delicious.  The only thing I did differently was I added a teaspoon of vanilla extract and I only used three bananas since I didn't have four to use.  I will definitely make it again.

This didn't turn out very well for me. I was picturing a moist light white cake with banana flavor. It tasted great but the texture was all wrong; not at all delicate like cake should be- maybe this recipe should have been called "banana bread." It just wasn' t what I was expecting; sorry.

I used margarine, pecans instead of walnuts, added a teaspoon each of vanilla and cinnamon.  I only had three bananas on hand, and used regular milk with a tablespoon of vinegar mixed in.  (Does all that substituting really make it the same recipe??) :)  The texture and taste were great!  Frosted with a cream cheese frosting it's moist and delicious.  I baked it in a 9x13 for about 40 minutes.

UTARIDIVA, and anyone who has problems with any kind of recipe. A top secret: first in a bowl combine all the dry ingredients and mix very well, then in other bowl combine all the wet ingrediendts, when you have this 2 groups combine them. This way you have an uniform flavor in the final product.  Good luck!

This was very good. I made mine in a 9X13 pan and cooked it for 38 minutes.  I used a cream-cheese frosting on it.  Cannot wait until after dinner so that I can have some!!

Delicious! Delectable! I used the Whipped Cream Cream Cheese Frosting recipe which is also on AllRecipes.com, and I sprinkled chopped walnuts on top. The only adjustment I made to this recipe was baking it about 15 minutes longer since it was still gooey in the middle when I checked it at the posted baking time. This recipe has gone into my permanent recipe box! I give it 15 stars!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Very easy to prepare. My family loved this cake. It was so moist! I had to cook a little longer than suggested (about 37 min) I used 4 large bananas. I think two would have been plenty. Will make this cake again. Great Recipe! Thanks.

Excellent with a very good banana flavour.  Would recommend using teflon pans and still doing the butter and flouring.  I used one glass and one teflon and the bottom 1/2cm of the cake stuck to the glass pan when I flipped it onto the damp towel.  Used the Banana Butter Icing from this site and it's delicious!

This cake was very moist and delicious.  I frosted it with a cream cheese frosting which made it very yummy.  Great way to use us extra bananas and buttermilk!  I'll probably try it as banana bread and muffins too.

I never thought my oven ran hot, but my cakes got a little overdone around the edge.  Next time I'll start checking sooner, 30 minutes was too long for my oven.

The best. Most banana cakes and breads are heavy. This one is super light. Made a 13x9 and dusted the finished product with powdered sugar. Absolutely delicious.

This cake was very moist and my mother & sister enjoyed it a lot. I, on the other hand, felt it lacked something so I added a 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla. Next time I'll use cream cheese frosting as suggested to get the "something" I'm looking for.

I received a lot of compliments from this cake.  I used Susan Greene's recipe for Bourbon cream cheese frosting (I used Jack Daniels as my liquer)and it came out fantastic.  Definitely cook the cake longer than 30 minutes!

This recipe was superb!!!It's the best banana cake I ever ate.So delicious with cream cheese frosting....The only thing I done different was add more walnuts to the batter..you can never have enough walnuts in a recipe like this one!!!
This recipe done just fine in a 9x13 pan.Just bakes a little longer.. This cake had great depth.

This is the best banana cake I have ever had! My husband and kids loved it! I baked it last night and it is already gone!  I made it in a bundt cake pan and frosted it with cream cheese icing while it was still warm.  I did add a little bit of vanilla to the recipe, but other than that I made it exactly as written.  It did take a little longer to bake, but it was really moist and delicious!  Definately a keeper!!

I used this recipe to make 11 muffins and a banana bread in a standard loaf pan.  Both were delicious, though the bread took quite a long time to bake!  I also omitted the walnuts.

What did I do?  I have read all of the reviews, and I decided to make muffins instead of a cake.  They were overflowing all over my oven!!!  The only thing I can figure is that I had too much batter in each cup.  (I only had 21 muffins, next time I will make 24.)  But, with all of the positive reviews, I am going to try again the next time I have some overripe bananas.  Update:  made into a cake and used a cream cheese frosting....YUM!

My husband wanted a banana cake for his birthday, just like the cake that mother made.  He absolutely loved this cake!  It was very moist and delicious.  We do not like walnuts so I used almonds and it was delicious.  I also added 3 extra bananas that needed to be used.  This was a very flexible recipe.

This cake is the most delicious and moist banana cake I have ever made with one addition.  I added 1 Tsp. of vanilla for a little extra sweetness.  I topped mine with a cream cheese frosting but it is so delicious that it would stand alone!

I have baked a lot of banana cakes in my adult life,and I believe  this recipe is by far the best one yet. It is not too time comsuming to put the ingredients together and the taste is excellent.  Some of the previous recipes turned out on the dry side, but this one is very moist.
I will definitely be using this recipe from now on.

I found that you get a nice thin brown crust baking for 40-45 min. I also add rasins and walnut after adding batter to pan. Stiring in the rasins and walnuts keeps them higher in the cake rather than settling to the bottom of the pan.

This cake tasted really good, but it was too soft and too moist.  One of the layers fell apart when I tried to pick it up.  I don't think I will try this recipe as a cake again.

A delicious easy recipe.  I made the muffins for my first try.  Took 17 minutes to bake.  No icing needed, just sprinkled a little confectioner's sugar over the top.  Thank you Kevin for sharing this recipe!

This cake was very good.  I am not a big fan of banana-anything but enjoyed this one.  The texture was more dense than I had expected.  I don't know if it was the 13x9 pan or the 27 month old sous chef.  Thanks for the recipe and the wonderful time my guy and I had baking together.

EXCELLENT and easy to make.  Omitted walnuts due to allergies and used regular butter (not unsalted).  Made 18 big muffins.  Could probably stretch out to make 24 regular-sized muffins.  Moist and tasty - I know I'll be making these again!

Pretty good recipe, a tad sweet for my liking, but that's just my taste. Also, as a cake, it really does need a bit of vanilla. 
I used soured milk ( milk with a tbsp of lemon juice) in place of buttermilk (because  I didn't have any) and 5 bananas.
Note: the use of buttermilk, yogurt, soured milk or sour cream is important to the lightness of the cake. In baking, the addition of an acid, in this case the lactic acid in the above clotted milks, creates light and fluffy products. The acid breaks down the long, tough strands of gluten making your cake tender and light. In addition the acid activates or 'excites' the baking soda and creates carbon dioxide gas, thereby allowing your cake to rise higher and lighter. 
So you can see that by only using plain milk or cream, you won't have the same reaction... it will still be good, but add the acid and it will be even lighter and better. :) 
Happy baking everybody!

This cake came out so perfect that I was astonished at my baking skills. I am not a skilled baker but yet I was able to bake this cake with such a perfection that left me astonished. In past, whenever I tried other recipes either they remained uncooked or came out burnt but neither of these problems were experienced by following this recipe. This is definitely a keeper. I dropped walnuts from the original recipe as I didn't have some at hand. As suggested by other members I added 1/2 teaspoon of powdered cinnamon and 2 to 3 drops of vanilla essence despite these amendments I followed the recipe as it is and baked it in a bundt pan for 35 minutes at 350 degrees F. It has super moist texture that melts in your mouth.

I don't know what's wrong with me compared with the other reviewers, but I was disappointed in this cake.  I detected a definite bitter taste.  With all the delicious ingredients in the cake, I'm thinking it must be the baking soda that I taste. I've never baked a cake that called for so much baking soda.  It's unlikely that I will make this cake again.  If I do, I will try cutting the baking soda to one teaspoon.

Made this cake today because I could not find my recipe.  It was very moist, tender and flavorful. Couple of suggestions - when your bananas get too ripe but them in the freezer.  When you have enough frozen bananas to bake, defrost them in a bowl on the counter.  Simply squeeze the bananas into a clean bowl, (discard any liquid from the defrosted bananas) and mash them as directed. Also, if you do not have buttermilk in the fridge, add 1 tbs white vinegar or lemon juice to milk to "create" a sour milk which can be substituted for the buttermilk. Sour cream. or 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 milk can also be substituted.  I have also learned, after many years of baking banana cakes, that you can increase the amount of bananas in the cake, which makes the cakes moister and more flavorful.  Happy Baking:)

I just made this cake tonight for the first time.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I had bought buttermilk to make "Creamed Corn Corn Bread" and had a little less than 1 cup left over.  Perfect for this recipe.  

I did combine everything a little different though...the lazy way...lol.  I don't think it hurt the results though.  I have a Ninja.  First I combined the dry ingrediets in a large bowl and set aside.  I added the sugar and butter to the Ninja and pulsed a few times. Broke two eggs in...pulsed until incorporated.  Added broken up bananas...a few short bursts of pulsing to mix everything well.  It was really hard not to add vanilla but I wanted to stay true.  Next I poured the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, mixed together, and dumped it in a greased 9 X 13 Pyrex baking dish and baked as directed.  It turned out great.  This is a keeper.  No vanilla....just follow the recipe.

I make this all the time…muffins, loafs, cakes…recently I've had to avoid dairy since two of my children have become lactose intolerant…I substituted the butter with coconut oil and used coconut milk soured with vinegar instead of buttermilk…I've even used coconut sugar in place of the brown…they love it even more! so nice and moist!

Recipe was good and quick to make.  Don't be afraid to reduce the sugar some.  I went with 3/4 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar and we thought it was plenty sweet.

Perfecto! This is the best banana cake I've made.  I've tried about 10 different recipes for this in the last five years.  I top it off with a lemon/coconut cream frosting (I'll put the recipe in circulation)and I've been complimented at every function to which I've taken it.

I just made this recipe with my kindergarten class.  The only thing I changed was using all white sugar.  Only because we didn't have any brown sugar.  The kids loved them as muffins.  No need for powdered sugar or frosting.  I wouldn't dream of substituting anything for the buttermilk!  I love the flavor.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is by far the best banana cake ever. Very moist. I tweeked it a bit. Baked at 350 for 40 mins. Added raisins and walnuts, cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg.  Perfect. Ftosted with my very own cream cheese frosting. Awesome cake.

I thought this was just ok.  I made them into muffins.  They were quite light.  I have a recipe that I normally use, but thought I'd try something new and found this one.  I think I will stick with my old recipe.

Best banana cake recipe ever.  I think the secret is not to skimp on the bananas.  I used sour cream instead of buttermilk.  I baked it in a bunt pan and iced it with coconut pecan icing.  Everyone raved about it.  Thanks for sharing.

I don't even bother with banana bread anymore. This is my go to recipe when we have a hankering for something banana. I use 4 bananas, a little banana flavoring, and pure vanilla. 9X13 pan, 35 mins. have also substituted 2/3c sour cream in place of buttermilk. Both ways are great!
I usually frost with cream cheese frosting, but used chocolate this time. WONDERFUL!!

A bit dense for cake, but still satisfied my craving.  Used 1/4 cup less white sugar because I don't like when it's too sweet.  Iced with cream cheese frosting it's delish.

This was not a good cake at all. I picked the "suprise banana cake instead" and it turned out WAY better. http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Surprise-Banana-Cake/Detail.aspx?prop24=RD_RelatedRecipes

That's just the link in case you want to try it. It worked out well.

I have made this recipe exactly as written and it has turned out moist and rich every time… very delicious.  I do add a fourth banana if they are small.  I get lots of requests for this cake and usually make a layer cake with a cream cheese icing.

This was okay.  Of course, the taste depends so much on the bananas and perhaps mine weren't as flavorful as some.  But, I wasn't as blown away as others seemed to be. The cake was moist and good, but I didn't find it to be as wonderful as proclaimed by so many reviewers. I did add 1 t. of vanilla, but followed the rest of the recipe as written.  I will definitely make it again, but will tinker with some spices and the sugar amounts.

I was disappointed after reading these other reviews, as this did NOT make a cake.  This would make a divine banana bread, though.  I used real butter, sour cream instead of buttermilk as suggested in the reviews (we were out), and all 4 large bananas.  The batter was so thick!  To thin, I added 3 TBSP of cream and maybe should have added more.  The crumb was too heavy for a cake, but I'll try this one again with cake flour and buttermilk.  It is an excellent  banana bread!  We frosted it with the Banana Nut Frosting on here, without nuts.  It's a great combination!  Next time, I'm going to add a tab bit of rum...yum!

Absolutely EXCELLENT. I have tried numerous recipes for banana bread through the years and finally decided banana cake was perhaps the way to go because banana bread in a loaf pan never seems to bake completely through. This recipe is not only baked through but moist and delicious. Thank you so much!

A very easy recipe producing an excellent soft, moist cake. I usually add some spices (mixed spices or just cinnamon), sometimes reduce the flour by 1/4 and replace with ground almonds or hazelnuts (and reduce the butter as there is oil in the nuts), and don't include so much sugar as the bananas are very sweet. I use reduced fat milk if I don't have buttermilk. I decorate it with some whole half walnuts. It's one of those recipes for which you can ring the changes according to taste!

I made this recipe with a bit less sugar and made a buttercream frosting with abt 3TBS maple syrup. SO good. I substituted walnuts for choc. chips and used some leftover flour mix from gingerbread making. I made this into cupcakes and brought it into work. everyone LOVED them.

This was my first banana cake, and I'm so glad I chose this recipe. It is wonderful...super moist, delicious, easy to make, perfect! I used two 9" round silicone pans, and it came out perfectly made according to directions. I used chocolate cream cheese frosting found here and sprinkled coconut on top, skipping the walnuts altogether. I'm going to make cupcakes for a potluck next week, and I can't wait to impress!

I baked this exactly as the recipe called except I only had salted butter and it was perfect! I made it into a 3 layer cake using the whipped cream-cream cheese frosting and took it to my in-laws for dinner and everyone just LOVED it!!!

Good very moist, the texture is great! I used 2 cups of smashed bananas, which is just right. Added a bit of jamaican pepper which is my top subs. for cinammon. I am taking 1 star out for being way tooooo sweet. Will reduce the white sugar to 1/2 cup and add to 1 Tbs of salt.

These are absolutely delicious and we cannot stop eating them! They are definitely drool worthy and guaranteed to make one not worry about their diet or healthy eating habits. 
I had to alter the recipe a little bit, as we did not have any buttermilk. So, what I did was put 1 and 3/4 teaspoon of cream of tartar in 2% milk, along with a tablespoon of sour cream!

Picked this particular recipe because it has so many good reviews.  Changed nothing, except used cake flour instead of a/p....  Also added chocolate chips instead of nuts, so I wouldn't have to frost it afterwards.  Baked in a bundt pan, it needed a full 45 minutes in my convection oven.  Was very nice, and moist, lighter than a banana loaf (better in my opinion).  Oh yeah I also used five bananas b/c they were on the small side...   One note, though, next time I make it I will likely use miniature chocolate chips instead of regular, as I found the chips all settled to the bottom of the pan, no doubt because the batter was fairly thin... No biggie though, and like I said, the addition of chocolate chips makes the hassle of making a frosting not necessary I think (plus this cake would be easier to freeze if it's not frosted)...  All in all a nice moist cake, good flavour, quick and easy.... This one's a keeper... thanks Kevin!

I had high hopes for this recipe since it had received so many rave reviews, but this just didn't work very well for me.  Both of the cakes fell in the center and the texture wasn't light or cake-like.  I bake at a high altitude and maybe this recipe just doesn't work well at an elevation of 8400 feet?  For sure, this recipe uses a lot of soda and no baking powder which differs from other banana bread or cake recipes that have worked for me.

Get the freak out out of my way and give me a spoon!!!!!!!!!!! It's like i never did anything else with bananas before this cake. Love this no frost needed cake. My tweeks were as follows, 1/4 cup less of both sugars, 1TBS less butter or really fruit it up and replace half yummy butter w/ half yummy apple sauce, used whatever milk ( butter, soy )  i had in the frig, and i added all the bananas i had which was 1 bunch = 5 large. I could not let 1 of natures boomerangs go to waste and really you almost can't put too many in.  One more add in if you like... sour cream a 1/4 cup of the real good stuff will give you that TANG.

This is by far the best banana cake I have made. The second time I made it I used a cup of buttermilk and reduced the white sugar to 3/4 cup.  This made it even better!  Overall a lighter and healthier recipe than most.

This cake has been a favorite of both my daughter's and my son's soccer team. I make it with chocolate chips instead of nuts. It always comes out super moist and disappears in no time. It does require longer baking than called for in the recipe, but that may be because I use heavy and dark baking pans. I simply take it out of the oven when a toothpick comes out clean.

In a word....DELICIOUS!!  I've already had two slices and am trying not to go back for a third!  I didn't have buttermilk, so I used milk and vinegar.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  I topped it with "whipped cream cream cheese frosting" from this site.

I have made this several times.  I use Splenda products for both the white sugar and brown sugar.  I also substitute applesauce for the butter.  This makes it lower in calories and cholesterol.  You could also use all egg whites if you'd like.  Because I made this healthier, I added some chocolate chips to the mix.  So good!  Doesn't even need frosting.

I followed the recipe almost exactly minus the fact that I used 5 bananas and a little less buttermilk because of this. The cake hasn't actually been eaten as of yet but it looks like a good banana cake should. Oh I nearly forgot to mention that instead of creaming the butter and sugars I melted the butter and whisked in the sugars, eggs, buttermilk and bananas. Still worked out fine for me, just a lot less work :)

Made tonight and it was yummy! Subbed the buttermilk for sour cream because that is what I had and did not put nuts in because of allergies. Added mini chocolate chips - so good. :)

AMAZING. Made it for work in a 9 X 13 pan. topped it with caramel syrup at last minute. Was moist and sweet and yummy. Didnt use nuts due to the fact it was for an office party and some people might be allergic. But will use them next time when I make it for home. Not at all dry as some people said. I did use an extra banana which may have been why. GREAT recipe!Thanks

Good! I used sour cream instead of buttermilk, and omitted the nuts, cake is moist and delicious. Took a little longer to cook though, more like 45 mins.

These were a big hit with the Girl Scout troop. I had extra bananas at home and it was our turn for snack night. I took the cake and turned it into cupcakes, frosted some and left some plain. I used others suggestion and used sourcream because I didn't have the buttermilk. They were amazing!

I am so tired of dense banana breads and was hoping that these would be lighter. And they were! The recipe made 24 muffins. Maybe cut down the sugar a bit next time.

I made this recently as a dessert for a pot luck. It was GONE in NO TIME ! Very easy to make, and everyone loved it ! I split the differance adding about 1/2 small tub of sour cream with the  buttermilk, and since a few friends do not like nuts, I added milk chocolate chips instead. I made it as a sheet cake, frosted it lightly with cream cheese frosting, decorated with slices of banana & drizzled dark chocolate stripes over the bananas both ways, corner ot corner. Beautiful and delicious ! I have made it twice since then by request for girlfriends as their birthday cake ! LOVE IT !

I remember making this recipe from allrecipes in college, 10 years ago!  I still love it and it comes out great every time.   I often freeze bananas once they have turned black for this recipe or just use black bananas when we haven't had a chance to eat them all.  I never use fresh bananas as the recipe won't come out as sweet, moist or fluffy.    I never have buttermilk handy, so I use milk or sour cream.  Great recipe!

Great with cream cheese icing from this site.  Found it to be best the next day as the texture was more moist and dense with a mellowing of all the flavors.  Was a hit with all who were lucky enough to get a piece.  Made it in a stoneware bundt- cooked for 40 minutes.

I was disappointed by this.  With all of the other reviews I thought this would be delicious.  But found it just OK.

Excellent banana cake recipe!  It was easy, fuss-free, and versatile enough to play around with the ingredients and not mess it up. :)  I didn't steer too far from the original.  I only used brown sugar (and reduced the total sugar to scant 1 cup), used 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and the rest AP.  Added 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and 1 TB ground flax seed for boost of Omega 3's. :)  The batter was slightly thicker than a typical cake, but I guess that is to be expected with a heavier cake like this.  I baked in a bundt pan for 35 minutes (our oven runs a bit on the hot side, so just do the toothpick test!), and it was perfectly done.  The color is a gorgeous, golden/deep brown, and looked lovely with a dusting of powdered sugar.  A great way to use up a lot of bananas, and substituting/adding/removing a few ingredients seemed to not mess with it much at all. :)

I made this cake by the recipe using 4 defrosted bananas, a then a second time by adding a cup of oatmeal and some raisins.  My friends agreed the second recipe was even better, with what they called "the goodies."  I'll save this recipe but continue to add the goodies.  I think some shredded coconut would also be tasty.

This recipe is the BOMB! Everyone l-o-v-e-d it! Super moist; needed only the lightest white glaze. I added an additional banana and some pumpkin pie spices, but really, the original recipe can hold its own.

I loved it. It was so moist. I ran out of white flour and used about a 1/3 cup wheat flour. Didn't change any liquids and it was still very moist.

I made this for my daughter's 1st birthday and iced it with cream-cheese icing. The only difference to the recipe was that I only used 3 (large) bananas and left out the nuts (since it was for a baby). This is the best banana cake recipe I've ever used !!!

I made this using some others' suggestions and loved it.  I added a teaspoon of vanilla to the batter and baked it in a 9x13 pan.  I accidentally added the buttermilk before the bananas and just dumped the flour mix in at the end without adding nuts and it still came out great.  Very moist and delicious - no icing needed unless you want extra sweetness!  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a KEEPER! It has turned into a family request everytime the bananas go beyond ripe. Moist, easy, and TASTY! I have trouble walking past it on the counter without snagging a bite. I use a 9x13 inch pan, and it works great. Not many recipes go onto my hand written recipe cards, but this one made it there! Can't wait to try it out as muffins.

I added a half tsp. both of nutmeg and cinnamon and baked this in a 9x13 baking dish as a sheet cake. I plan on frosting it with Grocery Store Frosting, which is also from this site. I'll update after we've all tried it. EDITED: A little sweet, but very moist and banana-y. I'd make this again, only cut the sugar in half.

This was so moist! I didn't have buttermilk so took another's advice and substituted light sour cream. I also whipped up a half batch of "Cream Cheese Frosting II." Very popular at the New Year's dinner party.

This recipe is FANTASTIC as banana bread. I replaced the buttermilk with sour cream, added a dash of cinnamon to the flour mix, and omitted the salt altogether. I baked for 45 minutes, and it came out perfect. It is so moist and sweet, you don't need any frosting, just server as is.

Super easy to make and very good. I ended up baking it in a 10x13" Pyrex dish which required an extra 15 minutes in the oven. Very moist and delicious. No need to change a thing!

YUM YUM YUM. I made this cake last night. It was wonderful. I added one teaspoon of vanilla, and only used 1/2 cup of the white sugar. Everything else I kept the same.  I used cream cheese frosting,and have been thinking about that cake all day. Definately make this cake. You will love it.

Very tasty and moist. It does taste like banana bread, however, not like "cake" for those looking for a cake. I followed the recipe as written and added 1tsp vanilla as suggested by others.

Terrific cake, it was very moist and dense.  Many banana cakes taste like banana bread baked in a cake pan, not this recipe!  I topped it with homemade chocolate butter cream icing!

Whenever I have old bananas, I love to make my Great-Grandma's banana bread, but  this time I wanted something lighter.  I tried this recipe, and loved it!  All of the lovely banana bread flavor, but with a lighter texture.  I baked it in a Bundt pan, turned out fabulous!

I did not care for this banana cake. I've just made it and copied the recipe without modification. There is far too much sugar in it making it very sweet with an aftertaste. Too heavy, and takes much longer to cook than suggested. I really do feel as though I've wasted my time this afternoon.

Not recommended.

Loved this cake - very easy, moist and delicious.  Made it with no modifications (other then the milk/vinegar substitution for the buttermilk) in two 9-inch layers.  My only mistake was using canned cream cheese frosting.  Next time I'll definitely whip up the frosting from scratch.

Pretty good. It is true this mix could be used for muffins, bread or cake. I did it in a 13x9 with cream cheese frosting. I;ll make it again for sure.

I love how this recipe is so light and not heavy like most banana bread recipes. I made mine into muffins. This batter makes more than 12 large muffins. I used the remaining batter in my mini muffin pan and baked it for 17 minutes. The regular muffins took about 25 minutes. I added semi-choco chips and it was great! Really moist and fluffy! My kids loved it! Thank you!

I made this yesterday into muffins...followed the recipe except I cut the baking soda down to 1/2 tbsp because the idea of so much baking soda scared me and i added 1 tbsp of baking powder...worked just fine...oh and i added choc. chips..scrumptious..one minor problem: it stuck to the pan...usually this doesn't happen too much...i cooled it a bit and it came out in one piece...very very good...

This is a fantatsic cake, even when adapted to suit multiple allergies. I wasn't hoping for much after many failed baking episodes cooking cakes to cater for my daughter's allergies to wheat, dairy and eggs. In the cake i substituted soy milk and lemon juice for buttermilk,wheat free flour blend, 'No Egg' egg replacer and Nuttlex(dairy free margarine)for butter. I also left out the nuts. For a cream cheese icing I used a soy cream cheese and Nuttlex with icing sugar. Will definitely be making this one again. Yum!!!

This one was pretty good.  I think I overcooked it a little bit, I'd recommend maybe cooking it for less time.  The cream cheese icing touch is a must, it really makes a difference.

I love banana Cake, and I'm always looking for new recipes.  I just wish this one was a little more moist.

Great flavor, and very easy to put together.  I baked it in a bundt pan, and unfortunately didn't leave it in the oven long enough, so I ended up with a pudding center, so to speak.  But the parts that got done were great.  I'll definitely try it again, in the suggested pans next time.

Very good. A bit gooy and took a bit longer to make than what the recipe calls for. I made a whipped cream cheese frosting and slapped it on the very top, then sprinkled some left over chopped walnuts. Boyfriend gobbled it up, but he is a dog (he eats anything you put in front of him)

I don't think I'm a banana cake snob, but I found this recipe rather dull.  Perhaps because I only used 2 bananas in it, instead of 4 like the recipe calls for?  It just didn't taste like anything fantastic, or worthy of 5 stars.  Honestly, I enjoy the banana cake recipe in my good 'ol Betty Crocker cookbook MUCH better.  Don't think I'll keep this tried and true recipe this time...Too bad.

I've made this twice already. Excellent! It is great as a banana bread without frosting (I used about 1/3 extra bananas) OR as banana cupcakes with Janni's cream cheese frosting also from this site! I added a dash of baking powder to make the cupcakes and added a bit of cinnamon too. Thank you so much!

I made this cake for Easter Sunday dinner and it was great.  I followed some suggestions from reviews that I read and added baking powder, cinnamon and vanilla.  I baked in two 9" pans and frosted with creamed cheese frosting found on Allrecipe - also placed sliced bananas between layers.  My family really enjoyed this cake and it certainly is a keeper in my collection.

This was excellent!  It had a few more steps than I'm used to doing, but I followed the recipe exactly and the cake came out great--so moist with a wonderful flavor.  I used a 9 x 13 baking pan and baked for about 35 minutes.  I used the "Whipped Cream Cream Cheese Frosting" also found on this website for the icing and I highly recommend it.  I'll definitely make this again!

This is a five star recipe, but only if you let it sit overnight.  By day two, you will have a wonderfully moist and flavorful banana cake, lighter in texture than traditional banana bread.  It also keeps very well; still nice and moist after 4 days.

I've made this several times now, always in a 9 x 13 pan that bakes in 35 to 40 minutes.  I sometimes substitute the nuts for 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips, and I usually top it with a fluffy and buttery fudge frosting.  Wonderful!

I buy bananas, let them ripen and deal with the fruit flies just to make this recipe! However, I always add a splash of vanilla extract, use 5-8 bananas (depending on size) and cut the buttermilk to 1/2 cup.

I found this recipe to be very easy to follow.  I've never made a banana cake before but was aware of the fact that they're normally heavy.  I found that by adding 2-3 extra Tbsp of buttermilk thinned it out just enough. I'd recommend this recipe to anyone who loves bananas, my boyfriend LOVED it!!!

Very, VERY moist & tasty.  Had to use up some ripe bananas, so I decided to try this.  I think I ruined it when I put chocolate frosting on top (with some chopped pecans sprinkled over the frosting...no walnuts in the batter for me).  I think this would have been much, much better with a sprinkle of powdered sugar over the top & skip out on the frosting.  Will try again for sure!  Thanks for sharing!

This cake is delicious!  My family loved it!  I baked it in a 9 x 13 pan for 35 minutes and it turned out great.  I measured my 4 medium bananas for future reference and it measured 2 cups.  I also iced it with the Whipped Cream Cream Cheese Frosting recipe (also on AllRecipes.com) and found it was a great combination.  Thanks for sharing!!

This recipe was GREAT! I made a couple of changes that worked perfect. I added some garlic powder and salt and pepper to the flour and added about a half of a can of chicken broth to the marsala and sherry, then I removed the chicken and added about a tablespoon of wondra flour mix, and whisked it for a few minutes, then added the chicken back to the pan. It thickened the wine sauce, and made a little more. I also think the kind of marsala and sherry you use is VERY  important. I used "Florio" sweet marsala wine, and I used "Cribari" california sherry. I went to a liquor store where I know the manager who is VERY knowledgeable about what kinds of wines and liquors to cook with. He sells to many fancy restaurants in the area. He highly recomended both. He was right, because it came out AWSOME! My children ages 10 and 14 don't usually like chicken marsala, but they loved this! I served it with buttered noodles and summer squash. This was a perfect weeknight meal, I will definately be making it again!

This recipe is just awsome. Really soft and moist. I added cinnamon as suggested by other members. I didn't add the nuts due to allergies though. It made 12 cupcakes and 1 loaf cake! Tried some with cream cheese icing, but friends preferred it plain! Many thanks.

I didn't have good luck with this one.  Cakes are generally my speciality, but this one didn't come out very well.  I think there's too much sugar in the recipe (maybe from the juice in the pineapple?).  If I try this one again, and I may because the banana part of the cake was very good, I will leave out the pineapple and just make it a banana cake.

I topped this with Strawberry Cream Cheese frosting and my kids could not get enough.  They were nuts about it!  I also left the nuts out because I am not crazy about nuts in bread.  This is an excellent recipe, though.  Thanks, Kevin!

One of the most moist banana breads I have ever made!  Wonderful recipe.  I made it in a loaf pan instead of a round one.  I think it still turned out pretty good, just took ALOT longer to cook.  about 45-55 mins longer.  Awesome recipe!!!

I had to get rid of some banana's and luckily I had buttermilk in the house for another recipe so I thought I'd give this a try.  Because I cannot eat white flour I depended on my in home day care children to tell me how they tasted and it got 5 stars accross the board.  I made muffins so that everyone got the same size.  The recipe made 24 muffins in 30 minutes with very little mess or fuss.  Highly recommended!

This cake is great, I mean really great, I mean really really GREAT. I baked this cake once when my in-laws dropped in. I just looked around the kitchen and found a few very ripe bananas to use, and I decided to try this ecipe that I had had for some time printed and waiting to be tried. The cake took really no time to put together, as I just put everything into the mixer. Then, while it was baking, it filled the house with this beautiful banana aroma that no body could resist. A perfect moist texture, a scrumptious smell, and a wonderful taste that is just balanced makes this cake a keeper. My in-laws are very picky about food and they said this was wonderful.

I haven't had a banana cake since my mother made it for me when I was 10.  I use to have it every year for my birthday.  I made it yesterday w/o using the nuts and covered it with a milk chocolate frosting and it was delicious.  It brought a smile to my face after all these years.  I just have a question I would like to ask?  What is the purpose for cooling the cake on a dampened tea towel?

This Banana Cake is the best I have ever tasted.
Now I know that I willnever have to wonder what
to do with ripe bananas.We didn't even put icing
on the cake, it was so good just the way
it is. I baked this in a 9X13 cake pan
for 35 minutes.

I used for medium, relatively right bananas +2 very ripe,previously-frozen bananas to get a more enhanced banana flavor!  I also use Pillsberry gluten-free flour. Two 9-in. round cake pans, baked at 350° for 30 minutes with Food Network Cream Cheese Frosting (but double the cream cheese amount) & the also double the entire recipe >PERFECT!!

As a 17-year-old student with negligible cooking experience I was somewhat apprehensive about baking a cake. This recipe was easy, straight-forward, and turned out marvelously! The cake looks and tastes amazing with a golden-brown color and moist interior. I added buttercream frosting for additional appeal. Would absolutely make again.

It is an amazing cake! I would prefer a smaller serving size though(1-8 inch cake or 1-9 inch?).

Made this last night for my husband and he gave me a perfect 10. Not sure if it's because I substituted Buttermilk for Coconut milk so will try the original recipe tonight.

I had a quite a collection of bananas in my freezer so I tripled the recipe. I added  a teaspoon each cinnamon & nutmeg and half a teaspoon  Jamaican ginger to the last batch of batter after filling a double sized loaf pan without the addition. The cake was moist and had a nice consistency. Will definitely make again.

Great recipe. 
Very delicious cake. Children loved it.
I replaced the butter milk with 1/4 cup table cream 18% and 1/4 cup sour cream, still the result was outstanding. 

Thank you very much.

absolutely love this recipe. I did 6 servings(1 pan) and it was the perfect amount of serving for a family. Only used 3/4 cup of brown sugar instead of using both brown and white sugar. Used plain flour instead of all purpose. Used salted butter , however i would suggest to still add in a small pinch of salt for enhanced flavor. It was Easy and duper moist perfect with a cup of coffee. I will make this again any day.

Just made this cake and it turned out  amazing !! I added some cinnamon and a little vanilla. It was so moist I used a glaze instead of a frosting. If you were debating if you should make this cake I will encourage you to make it you won’t be disappointed. I will be making this again real soon.

It is very easy to make, and definitely the cake is light and fluffy. But mine didn't rise up much, not sure if it's too much baking soda or I was too generous with the buttermilk. Tastes great!

Great way to use up a couple of over-ripe bananas. I cut the recipe in half because I only had two bananas, used canola oil instead of butter (the butter was in the fridge and I didn't want to wait for it to warm up). I also added a splash of vanilla, because everything's better with vanilla, right? Baked it in one round cake pan for 25 minutes at 350. Mmmmmmmm! Keeper!

Made this cake and it was a big hit.  Made a home made cream cheese icing (added banana to that as well) and the cake disappeared quickly.  Definitely added to my list of favourite cake recipes.

I followed the recipe, but it was only okay for me, as it had the texture of bread rather than cake.  It also took a longer time to bake due to the center being too wet, so the end result was that the cake was slightly dry and more dense.  That being said, the family liked it. Possibly, I should have used 3 bananas and maybe tossed them in the blender to liquefy them some more before adding them to the mixture.

Very tasty BUT I messed it up.  I used a glass casserole dish and it was soggy in the middle.  We ate around the edges, though! I'll do it right the next time, because there will be a next time!

This is our go-to banana cake. We use cream cheese frosting on it. I also make these changes: I use half the white sugar suggested. I also use up to 1/3 whole wheat flour. With the cream cheese frosting, it is plenty sweet enough. This recipe is really easy to make, and everyone always loves it.

The cake came out so yummy! I steamed it in a silicone tray for about 50 mins instead of baking it and hands down the best I have made so far in my life if I may brag ????. Thank you for the recipe. Will definitely make it again.

I love this recipe! It always turns out great! I leave out the walnuts because my family isn't big on nuts. I have made it as a 2-layer cake and as cupcakes, with cream cheese frosting. Leave off the frosting, and presto--banana muffins! It's one of those recipes that taste complicated but really isn't.

I love this recipe! It’s simple and delicious. I live in the Northeast of Brazil so I always have tons of bananas I need to use.  I don’t use walnuts, but throw in a cup of Callebaut dark chocolate chips. Thank you for a great recipe.

This is DELICIOUS. I love banana bread but was specifically looking for its cake version to use as my son’s 1st birthday smash cake—something less dense. I will be using this in the future for adults and kids alike! I often cut the sugar in recipes and I did so here as well, maybe by half, because I will be frosting it (with goat cheese frosting!). Even still, it is delicious—moist, banana-y, and fluffy. I did add a banana, as I do with all banana-based recipes. I am sure the recipe would be just as good as is, though.

After I started making it, I realized I only had half the quantity of bananas available so I halved all other ingredients. I added 1/4 tsp baking powder, 1/4 cup raisins (soaked in water for 15minutes), half tsp of cinnamon, and a dash of vanilla. I didn’t have buttermilk so I substituted it with Greek yoghurt. I baked it in loaf pan and had to bake it for 40 mins at 175 C. It’s turned out very moist and soft and delicious !!

Love this recipe.  Very moist.  Made them cupcake style and iced them.  Took them to share with coworkers, they  all loved them too . I used dark brown sugar because that was what I had on hand.   I'll make these again.  Thanks for sharing!

the only changes I made to this recipe was I used 2% milk with a 3/4 teaspoon of lemon juice to make buttermilk.
I would definitely make this again. This is a wonderfully moist cake with incredible flavor. I didn't froste it and if was perfectly wonderful without it.

Skip the white sugar or just use total 3/4 cup of sugar. I did this and it was sweet enough with additional sweetness coming from the bananas. Thanks to the other reviewers who commented on the original recipe being too sweet...especially if you are going to frost it. 

I added a 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon and teaspoon of vanilla. 

Otherwise awesome recipe. Great flavour, super moist yet not as dense as banana bread. This is a new go to recipe!

Very good recipe. I tweaked it by adding a small can of crushed pineapple for added moisture. Frosted it with cream cheese frosting. Also, experimented by using butter flavored Crisco.  End product enjoyed by my family. Will definitely be a go to banana cake recipe.

This is a really good recipe that is denser than a cake with great banana flavor. I made it in a 9 x 13 pan and baked for 35 minutes. I substituted plain kefir for the buttermilk, and reduced the amount of white sugar to 3/4 cup. Old fashioned burnt sugar frosting topped with walnuts or pecans makes this a favorite at dinner parties

I baked it in a 9 x 13 pan, so I got a single thicker cake instead of two thinner ones.  I started checking it after 30 minutes in the oven but in the end it took a little over 40 minutes.  The texture turned out great, not crumbling apart but also not too dense.

I would make it again but would try reducing the sugar by maybe a half cup (say 1/4 c. less each of white and brown sugars).  Given that bananas already add their own sweetness, the amount of sugar in this is kind of overkill from both a taste and a calorie standpoint.

My absolute favorite banana cake!  I made it three times, each time  with gluten-free all purpose flour (same measurement as listed in the recipe for all purpose flour) and it turned out great each time.  All my family and friends thought it was terrific and wouldn't have known it was gluten- free if I hadn't told them!  Just have to be a little careful not too use too many bananas or otherwise the cake won't rise in the middle.  Otherwise, I made no changes to the recipe.  It's perfect as is.  I baked it in a 9x13 pan.

I truly enjoyed this cake, I frosted it with the Allspice Cream cheese frosting  on this site, I think the two complemented each other delightfully well. I definitely will be making this combination again.

Wonderful! At first I just sprinkled confectioner's sugar over the top but my husband said it needed frosting. Cream cheese-frosted made it  perfect.

A good basic recipe for beginners. Sweet and moist. Good as cupcakes and cake. I made mine with yogurt and not butter milk and I also left out the nuts.  Still it was a great banana cake and is now my go to recipe for banana cake.

Love this cake. Have made it twice and the only thing I changed was to use 1/4 cup less white sugar. Baked both times for 50 mins in a bundt pan at 335 degrees.  Yum.

I baked this cake 15 minutes longer than the time on the recipe, but I also baked it in a ceramic casserole dish which may have been the cause of the extended time. I halved the recipe (which was easy to do) and it came out great! The moistness and flavor profile are exactly what I was looking for in this banana cake. Also, I typically use a blend of white and wheat four when I bake these kinds of things and it enhanced the flavor with some nuttiness as I didn't add the walnuts. Yum!!!

I used coconut milk instead of buttermilk. The bunt cake turned out beautifully in 45 min.  I also used 1 cup Splenda for the white sugar. It really doesn't need frosting.

This was a very good cake.  Because of  some gallbladder issues, I made a few adjustments.
My husband came home from work and had 2 pieces. The cake was moist and delicious. I didn't frost it  and left out the nuts because I don't like them in cake or bread. I also cut the shortening to 6 tablespoons. I felt that with the eggs and milk it had enough fat. I also followed what a few people said and used a bit less sugar.  I made it in an oblong (rectangle) pan for 30 minutes. A keeper.

Loved it! I made it for my son's 10th birthday cake with chocolate frosting in three layers.  I think I would have liked cream cheese frosting personally, but he's not a fan of it yet!  I added some vanilla and made both sugars measure 3/4ths cup.    Super yummy and better the 2nd day :)

My favorite cake as a child was banana cake with brown butter frosting.  My mom made it for me and I loved it!  I tried this recipe with the hope to have my favorite treat again.  I followed the recipe, but added pecans instead of walnuts.  The cake looked great when it came out of the oven, then fell completely in the center.  It turned out that the center didn't bake at all. I followed the directions of 4 bananas, now I'm thinking maybe 2.  Any of the edges that cooked tasted wonderful (especially with the frosting). For the most part, the cake went in the trash. Back to the drawing board... :-(

This is a good recipe. I misplaced my mom's recipe, so I used this one as the base and added things to the best of my memory. I added a teaspoon of cinnamon, a tablespoon of vanilla, used 4 large bananas- as that is what I needed to use up-, and I reduced the milk to a 1/2 cup and only used regular milk- too lazy to get out the vinegar to curdle it. I baked it in a 9x13 pan and it took about 40 minutes. My mom said it was really close to the taste of hers. I bet if I hadn't told her I'd lost the recipe, she wouldn't have known the difference.  So don't be afraid to add some more flavor to it.

Almost as good as grandma's!
I made cupcakes.  Got 30 medium-sized  cakes .  Cooked for 18 min at 335 convection oven.  Perfect.  Texture is great.  Now to ice them with chocolate cream cheese icing.

Crumbly, moist and easy to make! No need for frosting. I used 4 bananas as stated but the baking time increased to another 10-15 minutes. Overall satisfied!

Well, I was told this was the best banana cake they had ever eaten. I did not have buttermilk so I used 2/3 cup of plain Greek yogurt and 2 T of lemon juice and 2 T of milk to replace it. Used 1 cup of brown and 3/4 cup white sugar. I used the Whipped Cream Cheese Frosting from this site and also baked in two 9-inch round pans and cut the two cakes in half and frosted in between levels. Delicious!

This was excellent...as a base.  I used 2 large bananas, added 3/4 cup shredded coconut and a cup of caramel-filled chocolate chips.  It came out moist and flavorful.

Such an easy and tasty recipe. I did make some slight alterations. I used 1 cup of brown sugar and only a 1/2 cup  of white sugar. I also thoroughly  mixed 5 bananas in a separate bowl before adding them to the other ingredients. The end result was perfect!

This is the second time I have made this recipe, and I have to say, not only is it the absolute BEST banana cake recipe I have ever tried, but it is also the easiest!  I add 5 ripe bananas to mine, but that is just a preference thing.  Make it!  Your family will LOVE it!

I added an extra half batch because I had extra bananas. It made a 13x9 sheet cake and 12 cupcakes. I left out the nuts but had crushed pecans to be added if desired when served. Topped with cream cheese icing made it awesome. Also I substituted 2% milk with vinegar added for the buttermilk. Very moist and delicious.

Pretty darn good.   It's a dense, moist cake.  My bananas were very ripe, so it has a ton of flavor.  I did add the vanilla and cinnamon as suggested by other viewers.

The most amazing banana cake.  You will think it came from a very expensive bakery!  Perfect cake texture. But here's the thing... I ran out of butter,so I had to sub a 1/2 cup of veg. oil in place of the butter. I also did not have buttermilk, so I subbed all of the buttermilk called for with sour cream. I added about a 1/4 tsp of vanilla. No nuts (allergies).  My guests RAVED about this cake and had 2nds (some had 3rd's! lol). I am assuming it tastes just fine as called for, but running out of butter and buttermilk was a blessing in disguise!  Simply delicious!

I just doctor it up a little bit to make it more moist and less sweet... Instead of 2 eggs I use 3... Added another bar of butter and I only used 1-1/2 c of sugar... Added some vanilla extract too...

I cut the recipe in half (using just one 8-inch dish instead of two) and it was incredibly delicious. Light, perfectly sweet, just amazing. It cooked perfectly in 30 minutes. I highly recommend it. The only thing I would note is that I think of it more as a banana bread rather than a cake.

I used a 9x13 pan baked 30 min on the dot. Only had 2 bananas so I mashed an avocado with them. Whipped it up good with beaters & the butter. We're gluten free so I used 2c gluten free all purpose flour & 1/2c almond meal. AND my last substitution was thick sour cream with some half n half instead of buttermilk. The GF flour made the batter thick so I added half n half to get a batter consistency. WOW! The baked cake was amazing. Quite sweet so I didn't frost. BTW I liked it so much this is my 1st review!

House smells good with this in the oven.  I half the recipe and put 3 bananas instead of 2.  Will frost with cream cheese icing.  I haven't tried it yet but will tonight after supper! Update: Cake was delicious with cream cheese icing.  I'm sure it'll be just as lovely if not better with chocolate icing!

I substituted mini chocolate chips in place of the walnuts and baked these in muffin tins for about 20 minutes. I topped these off with peanut butter frosting recipe from this site and sprinkled some chocolate chips on top.  Super yummy!

My husband, who won't  eat bananas, LOVES this cake.  This recipe always impresses my company.  I love it as is, or with semi sweet chocolate chips in it.  I've also baked it with an added tsp. of vanilla.  So great.  I frost it with cream cheese frosting.  It tastes even better the next day.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend making this absolutely delicious cake.

Add ground flax seed for a nutty flavor.  Top with a cream cheese frosting.  This is a nice cake to take to a potluck, picnic or enjoy as an afternoon snack. -Paula Akbari

A great way to use ripe bananas. Loved it. A nice dense cake. I made a dark chocolate frosting that went very well with it for chocolate lovers. Used the recipe on Hersey's dark cocoa box.

I have made this recipe several times.  Each time it has been a winner for my family and my teenager's friends.  I've tried it with both buttermilk and sour cream, and both are delicious. I'll have to try it with yogurt next time.  I skip the frosting every time.  The cake is moist and delicious without it. I find that I need to increase the cooking time by about 10 mins.

This reciepe is perfect without any changes.  You can add chocolate chips or nuts if you wanted yet I like it just the way it is.  
One thing I did do a couple times is frost it with peanut butter frosting or a peanut butter glaze.  It just added to how wonderful it really was.

I have made this banana cake numerous times.  I usually double it and make one to freeze so I always have one for whatever occasion comes up.  Rave reviews!  I top it with the whipped cream cheese frosting on this site.  Amazing!  I do leave out the walnuts as we have food allergies in the family.  Never miss them because this cake is so awesome all by itself!

I made this recipe twice and the first time I figured I used too many bananas so the second time I used less bananas still it was caved in and not baking in the middle and anything I've ever baked this hasn't happened to me so I'm not sure maybe the bananas were too big I'm not sure but I like a lot of banana flavor and in another banana recipe I used the same amount if bananas and the outcome was no where near wet or mushy I'm afraid to try it again but they do say third times a charm I don't want to use two bananas maybe I'll add more baking soda not sure but I see no point in banana cake if it doesn't taste like banana and won't bake through the middle

Wish I could give this recipe more stars!  I literally just finished my first piece of this cake.  It was very moist, very flavorful--not very sweet but just the right sweetness with a great banana flavor that is not overwhelming.  I am adding this to my regular rotation of recipes.  Thank you so much for sharing!

The best banana anything recipe I've ever tried!  I made it in a 9x13 pan, using the milk/vinegar version of buttermilk, and 2 large bananas.
I can't believe how much I like this!  Had to pin this as well as recipe box it, so I'm sure to make it again!

I'll make this again, for sure. I used all whole wheat pastry flour because I was out of all-purpose, and it still came out wonderful. I added 2 teaspoons to 2% milk instead of buttermilk; used 3 ripe bananas, and omitted the nuts. I frosted it with Cream Cheese Frosting with Brown Butter and Bourbon from this site. Love the combination!

I made it exactly according to the recipe.  It was wonderful.  Initially I thought that 1 tablespoon of soda was too much, but I did it anyway and all was fine.  Perhaps the denseness of the banana batter needs more leavening.  The walnuts truly complement the banana flavor.  Will make this again (and again).  Thanks.

I halved the recipe, and the only change I made was using 3T butter, 1 T unsweetened applesauce.  I may try substituting a little more applesauce next time, because the texture was still absolutely fine.  I baked it for 40 minutes in a square 9X9 pan, and lightly frosted it with cream cheese frosting.  My husband and I both loved it!

I tried this receipe which came out very tasty. I made a few changes because as usual i didn't have all the exact ingriedents so i improvised. First I used 100% whole wheat flour, then i used two med to lg size bananas and added a snack size portion of applesauce, then i used 2% lowfat milk instead of buttermilk, and i baked it in a 13x9 x 2 1/2 in. Glass baking dish and baked it for about  35 min. Making sure to put toothpick in to ck it at 25 min.and found it needed about 10  more minutes for a total of  35  min. As us bakers know ovens do vary so i always set  timer for less minutes and ck then add time if needed. Then i spread cream cheese frosting over a piece and enjoyed it totally. Thanks for sharing this cake receipe.

I didn't have buttermilk so I used milk with half a teaspoon of vinegar. And added some chocolate chips too! The cake turned out fluffy, moist and delicious! Goes great with a cup of hot tea.

I loved this recipe.  It is simple (especially since I used self-rising flour in a pinch), delicious and came out just as promised.  I'm trying it again today with cream cheese frosting.  Moist, banana-y and yummy!

I cut the sugar to 2/3 and used about 1/3 whole wheat flour. After that it was excellent, and much more to my family's taste.

OMG - this is SO good!  Hate to think how many calories are in it with the butter and sugar, but it's worth it.  A little bit goes a long way - so cut your pieces small!  I topped this with a buttercream icing flavored with lemon - delicious!  Easy to prepare too.

Really nice.  I used a milk/vinegar sub for the buttermilk and used raisins in place of walnuts.  Only used 3 small ripe bananas it still came out very tasty.  Didn't use any icing as the cake is more than sweet enough on it's own.

I baked it in a 9 x 13 pan since I don't have cake pans. It was prob around 35 mins in the oven and was nicely browned and bounced back when touched. [lost my toothpicks] I cut it before it was cool and found a top layer not cooked....just batter.  I was surprised since it seemed perfectly baked to me. Banana cakes are funny that way, I guess...I'll try it again and hope for better results. If I had left it in much longer, it would have been too overcooked on the bottom and top.[the taste is great!]

We loved this cake so moist and flavorful. We used coconut pecan frosting. Thanks for sharing this recipe. A 9×13 pan works well.

Awesome. Add in vanilla bean paste and top with cinnamon cream cheese frosting. Left out the walnuts but sprinkled some on top.

I made 16 cupcakes and they were nice and light and tasted good, if a little sweet.  But they were completely flat on top and tended to run into each other.  Is this how they're supposed to come out?

My family's favorite cake I may make it a bit too often and my bulldog gets one every year for her birthday. I make some frosting or glaze from butter and powdered sugar. So delish!

8 BILLION STARS!!!! I made this for the staff at one of my favourite bars and they all went ape(no pun intended) for this. I didn't get a chance to eat it but they all said it was the best thing I ever made for them. Gonna have to cheat on my diet and try this one myself :)

A great cake or muffin!  Easy and quick to make.  I've made it a number of times and it's so tasty! Personally I like a denser recipe for bread, but love this as a cake.

Absolutely wonderful, moist cake.  I even took a chance and replaced 1/2 of the butter with applesauce.  This cake baked up beautifully and with the cream cheese frosting on top, it is fabulous!

I have always love banana cake...but the ones that I bought are all too sweet for my taste. Now that I can bake one...this is going to be the one. I reduce the white sugar, and instead of mashed banana...I sliced the banana to really fine pieces, so that I can bite on the banana slices

Loved this cake.  Used sour cream instead of buttermilk.  It's a keeper!  Was good with butter cream frosting, the frosting didn't overpower the banana flavor in the cake.

This is a fantastic cake/bread.  I made it for a bridal shower for a girl who doesn't like cake but likes Banana Bread.  This will be the recipe I use all the time for banana bread/cake.  I filled the layers with a banana mousse and frosted it with caramel cream cheese frosting.

I have done up this recipe twice they were failed attempts. They did not to get brown on the top and when I test it with a stick, it comes out very very moist in the middle. I  am using a tefal table top oven. I have set it to 175 degrees Celsius and baked it for 30mins with the knob turned to the fan oven. In my oven manual however, i am instructed to bake a marble cake in 200 degree Celsius 40mins under the pastry function(which is really fan in addition to bottom heat). I am not sure what went wrong!

Delicious!  this turned out moist and made the perfect layer cake, which I filled with fresh sliced strawberries and vanilla pudding.  Received rave reviews!  It is very similar to banana bread.  Will make again!

This is a delicious cake.  I did not have buttermilk, so I substituted adding milk and vinegar as directed in another review.  I did not have walnuts so - get this, I substituted with 2 small apples cut into tiny square pieces and that worked out better than I thought. I will continue to make this recipe my husband loves it.  Its great warm.

This is a delicious cake.  I made this yesterday with the following changes.  Didn't have any buttermilk so I substituted yogurt, added 1/2 tsp. baking powder and eliminated the nuts (dietary contraints). Baked it in a 9X13 pan for 30". Sprinkled with powder sugar when done.  It was very moist and fluffy.  Will definitely make this again.

I baked this in a large baking pan for around 35 minutes and used chocolate chips instead of walnuts and it was so super moist and tasty! It could feed an army though or make it for a party because that is a lot of cake!

This is sooooo good! I cook it for more like 45 minutes though. I  make a powdered sugar glaze to go on top. It's delicious!!!

Wondful fast and light, I used creole thin skinned bananas and a butter walnut cream filling. I served it to a Frenc Chef and he raved about it.

Probably the best banana cake ever. My son asks for it ALL the time- he's 3!  I iced it with a cream cheese icing. YUMMY.

Yum.  I love this. I used half whole wheat flour and subbed half the butter for applesauce, I also used Spenda instead of sugar and lessened it by 1/4 C.  I made one full muffin tin and a small loaf of bread.  Muffins baked for 18 or so minutes.  I thought hte bread and the muffins turned out GREAT!

This is THE BEST EVER!!! I HIGHLY recommend it. I have what I consider THE BEST banana (bread) recipe but this knocks it out of the water. I made it TWICE in a ROW and am thinking about making it again ... IMMEDIATELY (HAHA). SO GOOD ... SO MOIST! I'm passing it on to EVERYBODY! LOVE IT!

Delicious, moist, and easy to make. I didn't have buttermilk on hand, so I substituted with light sour cream mixed with a little skim milk. Used really rotten bananas as well. Yummy!

Very nice. I subbed sour cream for buttermilk. I made a peanut butter icing and garnished with brown sugar glazed bacon. This was served at my son's 15th birthday party. It was a hit. Fit for The King.

I cut the recipe exactly in half using AllRecipe's nifty calculator, thus reducing the baking soda to 1 1/2 tsp. (Other irrelevant modifications included tossing in a 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg.) Still, I received the same deflated, brown result I have with other dishes incorporating baking soda. My baking soda is only about a month old; could the problem be too much baking soda to begin with? Or is the cake /intended/ to be dark and drab, i.e., not as shown in the recipe photo?

Excellent. Yum. Perfection. Made as listed. Put on a cream cheese frosting, sprinkled the nuts on top instead of in the cake batter. Then everyone knows there are nuts and if they don't like, take them off. Very moist and delicious. Make sure you store in the frig if they don't disappear immediately because of the cream cheese frosting if you make that which I strongly recommend.

I have made several versions of banana cake and this one is the best! Very moist with just enough banana flavor. I am baking another one today and I think that I will cut back 1/4 cup of sugar because the icing I use is so very sweet. I don't add the nuts because of personal preference. This will be my go-to banana cake! (Use peanut butter frosting-delish!)

A friend of mine gave me this recipe. I tried it yesterday for the first time and bring it to work today. As I didn't have buttermilk, I made it with milk and lemon (instead of vinegar). It was perfect!!! All my collegues (all French) was surprised by the texture and the taste... They simply love it!!! They told me that I could try my american treats on them every time I want ;-) Thanks!!!

This cake was good. The only thing I changed was substituting sour cream for the buttermilk as I didn't have any. I think my bananas were a bit on the large side so I probably could've used just 3. Not a biggie, just resulted in a wee-bit too much batter in my 9x13 pan so had to cook a little longer and the top got a little brown. Also, it's not sweet enough at all. I will definitely have to make an icing for it. Other than that, very good. MOIST! Nice flavor! Will make again.

This was so yummy!  I did a couple of different things.  I used sour cream instead of buttermilk and I added mini semi-sweet chocolate chips.  I put this in my mini cupcake pan for 16 minutes and they were PERFECT!!!  My daughter is very picky, and she asked for more "mini monkeys" (I love the name she made up for them).  I was thrilled to find something that she liked.  These were so sweet with the chocolate chips that we didn't need frosting.

Just made this today. I used all purpose flour as the recipe called for and it turned out moist and delicious instead of dry 'cakey' as some have mentioned they thought it might. I only had 2 large, very ripe banana's, and I used sour cream in place of the buttermilk(because I didn't have any nor did I have vinegar to make some) and it turned out great! I made two smaller square pans because my oven went out and I had to bake in a toaster over(that has a bake option), and on one I put store bought milk choco. frosting and the other I sliced into snack slices alone.  I prefer the one without frosting, it's moist and delicious, and the kids prefer the one with choc. frosting of course:)  Overall, this is a great recipe-took maybe 10 minutes to mix up(not the 30 the recipe says it will)-quick, easy, and delicious

I gave this a "5" because I used half cake flour and half regular flour.  It had a lighter, more "cakey" texture than I think it would have otherwise. Next time I may even use more cake flour and less regular. My husband said this was the best banana cake he'd ever had.  I frosted it with a vanilla frosting from a can and it was yummy!

Fantastic and so moist!  I took the advice of another reviewer and used normal milk with a tsp. of vinegar, and omitted the pinch of salt since I used salted butter.  Definitely a keeper!

This has to be the best banana bread/cake recipe that I have yet to come across.  It was a hit at a birthday party that I took it to.  It was the favorite cake out of three different ones that was made.  Thanks for the recipe!!

I made the change of using sour cream instead of buttermilk like someone else suggested since I didn't have buttermilk. My bananas were a little green and under ripe but I prefer the flavor of slightly unripe bananas compared to ripe. So with the previous statement in mind I also thought it could have used an extra banana or two for a little more banana flavor, which I'll do next time. I also opted for a chocolate frosting I made w/cocoa powder, confectioners sugar, heavy cream and a little whipped cream. It was an experimental frosting which turned out great and was very good with this cake. I made it for my SO and ended up eating two pieces myself because it's very good. thnx for this recipe.

I made this with 4 1/2 bananas and a 9 X 13 pan baking for 30 minutes. It was a little overdone so 25 minutes would have been better. Maybe it was the overdoneness (is that a word?) but I didn't think it was anything special.

This is a wonderful recipe! A keeper...I used lowfat milk instead of the buttermilk and it still turned out great. My made a loaf for my husband to take to work and his co workers raved about this recipe. Thank you.

I made this cake sugar free & here are my changes: cake flour vs regular flour, 1 T + 1 tsp baking soda, 1 C Splenda + 1/2 C powdered milk, 3/4 C Sugar Twin (fake brown sugar), sour cream + 1/4 C half & half (only because I didn't have buttermilk). I didn't add any nuts and baked in 9x13 pan--I baked it for 30 minutes but you have to check it often because when using Splenda, you don't have to bake it as long. I'm going to add the cream cheese frosting and use Splenda--you have to be very careful how much Splenda you use--just add a little at a time until you have the right consistency. It was light & delicious!

This cake is WONDERFUL! No need for icing, it is moist and awesome while still warm. I made the following changes: squeezed juice from half a lemon into the bananas, used half & half instead of buttermilk, and added cinnamon, allspice, and ginger for a spicier taste. Used 9X13 pan and baked for 40 min. Will make this lots. Thanks!!

I made this today and it turned out moist and wonderful.  I made 24 muffins and one small loaf.  I should have made less muffins.  I wasn't sure how much they would rise, so I didn't fill them too much. I hate when people adjust other peoples' recipes that they have submitted, but I had to throw in some mini chocolate chips :)

I didn't think this was as strongly banana tasting as I had hoped.  Perhaps I should have just made banana bread and frosted it.  It was moist, and I will try it again sometime.

Very Good!  I did not have 4 bananas so put in the 3 I had and added a bit extra buttermilk for moisture.  It tastes great.  I had to cook a bit longer but maybe my oven is a little off.  Also, we have tried it with adding peanut butter when we have had no nuts in the house, that was all good too.

Great recipe--I added 1/2 cup applesauce instead of butter and used 1 1/4 cup of whole wheat flour with 1 1/4 cup of all- purpose flour, added some craisins instead of the walnuts for those that have allergies, and it was absolutely divine.

Wonderful cake.  But a bit too sweet for our taste.  Next time i'll cut back on the brown sugar to 1/2 cup from 3/4 cups.  But it's a keeper!

This was very good. My husband was picky and really liked this cake. I followed some of the previous reviews and added about 1 tsp of baking powder and made my own buttermilk by adding about 1 tbs of vinegar to the milk. Made this with cream cheese frosting which was also well received.

This cake is the BEST banana cake I've ever had. And I've been making banana bread/cake for a while now. It's up there with my Grandma's banana bread recipe. I used sour cream instead of buttermilk (didn't have any) and I used 1 c. of whole wheat flour. Next time I am going to slip in some ground flax seed! hehe LOVE this esp. warm out of the oven w/vanilla icecream on top.

I just made this cake today but i made it a layered cake with cream cheese frosting. Also added a cap of lemon extract to it and sprinkeled nuts on top of frosting. Came out really good. 
Made another batch for cupcakes with same topping but this time used vanilla extract. Kids loved it and its also a great recipe to use for teachin 11 yr old to bake.

This banana cake was oustanding! This is a very dense cake however. It does have more of a banana bread consistency but in a bundt pan with cream cheese frosting everyone loved it. Personally, I swore I could taste the baking soda though...

Its been 8 long years since I last baked, and yesterday night, i finally baked my 1st banana cake using Kevin's recipe. Overall the cake is moist, but the sides was a tad too dry. The recipe called for 30 mins, which is way too short. I tested for doneness at 30mins, too wet, 45mins, still wet, and waited an additional 10 mins, hence the sides ended up a tad too dry. I will definitely try this recipe again, maybe this time, in a 9"X13" pan which might help with a more even baking, for 45 mins. My husband thanked me for the cake, and proceeded to ask me to bake him a cake for his coming birthday!

I made this cake in a 9x13 pan it kinda droped in the middle as it cooled. I think the next time I make this I'll bake at 325 for 40 mins to avoid the drooping. I didn't have butter milk or sour cream. So I used skim milk and a tsp of lime juice since thats all I had. Worked great!! This cake is very moist and tasty. I topped it with cream cheese frosting. I thought the frosting was too much but my family loved the sweetness.

This is a great cake, Kevin. Thank you. Normally I don't care for "banana" things because they taste like the dead bananas peope usually use for these reciies. But by using fresh *yellow* skinned bananas this cake has a wonderfully rich and satisfying fresh banana taste. 

It also freezes well, so I bake it as a flat sheet cake, split it up into sections, and freeze it. Perfect for a household with only two people. Then there is always "fresh" cake when company comes.

This cake adapts wonderfully well for those with egg/nut allergies by eliminating the nuts and using Ener-G egg replacer/water.  I've been searching for months for a cake recipe for my little one's 1st birthday that contains no eggs/nuts and still tastes great -this is the one!!  I frosted with a basic cream cheese frosting, the whole family loves it!  We'll make this often. Thanks for posting!!

Three & A Half Stars...  Good flavor, but just so HEAVY!  The kids couldn't even finish their pieces, and that has NEVER happened.  As other stated, this does take more time to cook.  Added in vanilla, shorted the walnuts (about 1/4 cup), added about 1/2 cup of mini chocolate chips.  Frosted with (Neufchatel) Cream Cheese Frosting, and dropped a few more mini chocolate chips on top for presentation.

Just right.  Very good cake.  Only one correction at 350 using a Viking Gas Stove it took 45 minutes to cook.  I added milk and a teaspoon of vanilla.
My family loved it.

One reason I wanted to make this cake was because it calls for a lot of bananas.  So many recipes only call for 1 cup.  Easy, moist and tasty. I added 1 tsp. of cinnamon and topped with cinnamon cream cheese frosting (cinnamon added to the frosting) and toasted walnuts. It was a hit. Yum.

Too sweet to my liking.  This was even already after I cut the white and brown sugar in half. Great recipe though.  Thanks for sharing.  Next time I will try it with only the brown sugar.

I followed the suggestions and added more bananas and a little less sugar.  I used regular milk instead of buttermilk.  I did not frost.  It came out really good.  My husband loved it!

This cake was fabulous.  I made it for my health concious boyfriend for his birthday as an alternative to a sugar-loaded birthday cake.  Not only is he asking for it again, his not-so-health-concious friends are too!  Wouldn't change a thing about it.  The cream cheese frosting is a must!

Great banana flavor in this cake, moist too.  I cut back a bit on the sugars since the frosting was sweet (Chocolate Cheese Frosting), then added a tsp each of vanilla and cinnamon.  Baked in a 9x13 glass dish for about 35 minutes.  Will make again when I need to use up those over-ripe bananas.  Thanks!

Thank you so much Kevin for this fantastic recipe.  I've never had such a moist banana cake/loaf/muffin! I love the versatlity of this recipe.  I made a double layer cake to bring to a party, topped with a caramel cream cheese frosting and  pecans rather than walnuts. Everyone at the party loved it, even the ones who don't like bananas!

Loverly recipe. Not a big fan of banana cake, but this recipe is an exceptional. I altered the ingredients. I've no walnuts on hand, so I used peanuts. And can't find buttermilk (and, to a beginner like me- i have no clue what buttermilk is), so i used milk (the one i drink everyday before leaving for school!). The batter was too dry (my housemate told me) while i poured it into the baking tray, and i added another 80ml of milk and stired it well. Baked it for 45mins. Excellent recipes. I used three bananas. the bananas i bought was HUGE.

This cake is amazing!!!!  I received many compliments on it.  I did make some substitutions...I used barley flour instead of wheat flour, raw sugar as opposed to white sugar and soya milk (with capful of vinegar) instead of buttermilk.

I just made this cake and it is awesome!
The only reason I altered the recipe was because I didn't have all the ingredients. I used skim milk with lemon juice as an alternative to buttermilk. Pecans instead of walnuts. I also added a dash of cinnamon. 

And because I did not have the ingredients for frosting, I took a ghiradelli baking bar  and broke it up and tossed it in there with an extra 1/3 of sugar (to make up for the unsweetened chocolate). The little pockets of gooey chocolate was AWESOME!

This cake is very light and moist! I would definitely make this again and this time for company!

Okay, I'm a skeptic, but this banana cake recipe really is exceptional.  I added vanilla and cinnamon as directed by other reviews as my family tends to prefer flavorful to mild.  I also added 1 c. sour cream instead of buttermilk because it was available.  We made cupcakes/muffins with our recipe as I read the tendency of the cake recipe to come out slightly underdone in the 9 X 13 pan.  The muffins were glazy on the outside and incredibly moist.  I did add nuts, probably more like one cup.  They are a must make again in our family.

Deliscious!  It was great as a batter, right out of the oven, first thing in the morning, two days later, and then finally a few days old - toasted with a little peanut butter on top.  If you love banana bread, then you really should try this cake.  A few more steps than some recipes, but worth every one!

Was so moist, I couldn't believe it. It lacked a little on the sweetness but that could be just me. Still worth 5 stars though, was excellent!

An easy and excellent recipe.  I made half a recipe because I only had 2 bananas, and also omitted the nuts.  Didn't frost it at all, but we ate it(still warm) with vanilla ice cream and hot fudge sauce. Very nice.

I wanted to make some banana muffins for Xmas and lost my mother's recipe....so I looked for a recipe that calls for buttermilk like hers and found this one. It was almost identical! Lucky for me it tastes just like hers. Great recipe. I like the sticky coating that appears on the muffins after you let them sit. Very good recipe.

This is my best friend's favorite cake (she gardens, I cook - great trade-off!). I make it with Banana Cream Cheese frosting, also on this site, and omit the nuts.

Spectacular! I made a few substitutions- 2/3 cup nonfat vanilla yogurt for the buttermilk and reduced the white sugar to 1/2 cup. I also added chocolate chips and frosted it with cool whip for a quick Sunday night treat. Big hit with the whole family! Will definitely be making this one again and again! Thanks Kevin!

Baked this in a 9X13 pan for about 35 minutes.  I liked the texture and moistness of this cake.  Instead of adding nuts to the cake, I sprinkled a few on top.  Adding 4 bananas to this recipe was a plus since most recipes only require 2 bananas.  I will be making this one very soon.  Thanks for sharing!

This is probably the best banana cake I've ever made and tasted. I didn't change a thing. I've baked this cake at least 6 times in the last 5 months and every time I get nothing but great raves from everyone. Thank you

This really is the best banana cake ever - but it makes an even better feijoa cake! Substitute 1 cup of mashed feijoa (the fruit needs to be very ripe) for the bananas.  I added half a teaspoon of ginger to the mix and it was fantastic!

Finally, I have found a great banana cake. This one is a keeper. I frosted it with a simple butter icing with a touch of banana flavouring. It was excellent. Thanks for sharing.

This is a fantastic cake - moist and delicious.  I used the Banana Butter Frosting (from this site) with it as other reviews suggested but I did not like it.  It was too sweet as an overall icing, I would suggest torting the cake with it and then ice with a lightly sweetened whipped cream.

Since my 2 year old loves bananas, I thought this would be a perfect cake for her birthday party.  It went over very well with the children and parents!  I made a 9X13 pan and cooked it for 40 minutes.  It was moist and delicious frosted with cream cheese frosting.

I just had to add my review even though the response is enormous.  Very easy, absolutely delicious cake.  I made an 8 inch layer cake which was done in 35 minutes and frosted it with cream cheese frosting.  Everyone in my family loved it and they usually never agree on desserts!

This cake was so moist and delicious.  We didn't have buttermilk so I made some, and accidently added an entire cup of milk, but it still tasted fabulous.  Topped with cream cheese frosting is heavenly.

This is a really easy-to-make banana cake and it is very delicious.  This is the second time I bake this cake, I used shallow cake pan and it came out just fine after 30 mins without uncooked inside. Also, I had 4 small size cups of moffin, it only needs 15 mins in the oven.

This was better than your average 'banana bread' recipe.  I made the recipe and it was enough for 12 cupcakes (large) and a single 8" cake.  Used canned cream cheese frosting on everything.  Cooking time could have been less - in 30 minutes the cupcakes and  cake were very brown but still good.

It was very good, I also added 7 cups of cocoa powder and 4 cups of brown sugar to sweeten things up a bit.

Very very good.  I made muffins instead of cake/bread.  I used whole milk in place of the buttermilk.  My 1 year old loved them and wanted them for breakfast lunch and dinner.  Thanks for the recipe.

Very yummy, very dense and moist banana cake.  I have so often found cakes from scratch to be so dry, but this one is absolutely fantastic.  I will definitely make this again.

Nice and moist. I made a double batch and cooked half in the oven and half in the microwave in my Tupperware stack cooker. Found that the micro. one was done in half the time! Great for those impatient kids hanging around the kitchen. Used whole milk instead of the buttermilk. Tasted great too! Was very easy to make. Will make this again!

I absolutely loved this cake, although I thought it could stand to be a little more moist.  I will add a little apple sauce next time to moisten it up a little.

This is an excellent cake.  I think it is the extra banana and the brown sugar.  I cut down on the white sugar a bit.  I think next time I will try reducing the sugar by 1/4 of a cup  each as I would prefer it a little less sweet.

I made this cake recipe into muffins w/ raisins and less sugar and they still came out quite well.  However they didn't go as fast as my blueberry muffins so think I'll make then with some fruit (blueberries, strawberries etc.) next time and add more sugar.  Still tasty though!  Think the bananas reallly give it the ummmmph!

My overall 5 star rating came from my kids - I had a very bad cold when I made these, so I couldn't taste them, but my kids said it was the best banana bread they've ever had (I made muffins and used an 8x8 square pan). I could tell by the texture that it was very moist. I'm freezing a couple, so that when I can taste food, these will be the first I try!

This recipe was wonderful!  I made my buttermilk with vinegar and milk which was great because I don't have buttermilk around the house.  The bread is a great way to use up mushy bananas!  The kids also loved the bread and were happy to help mush the bananas!  Thanks for the Recipe!!

Made it for my daughter's 1st birthday party as I wanted something not too sugary for the kids - they liked it, but the adults were raving about it!  I made cream cheese frosting sweetened with a little apple juice for the icing. Yummy!

Very moist, with lots of banana flavor. I made a cream cheese frosting for it, and then decided to add a little maple flavoring. I thought that the maple would complement the nuts in the cake. I got lots of compliments on it. I always seem to have lots of bananas on hand, so I think I will make this one often.

I loved this recipe.  It bakes beautifully, is moist and has a very tender crumb.  It really doesn't need it, but I will frost with a chocolate cream cheese frosting or caramel frosting for a very special treat.

Very Good Recipe..... But a little too much work for me. I like quick and easy.  AlthoughI would definatly make this again because it tastes great.  BTW, I added cream cheese frosting.

Fantastic recipe.  I make mini loafs with them and take them into work.  A little bit of peanut butter on them in the morning makes a great day.

I liked making this recipe because I didn't need to make a trip to the grocery.......it's make of common ingredients that are already right in the kitchen whether you bake a lot or not.

This cake topped my grandmother's cake that has been in the family for years.  I like brown sugar frosting on bananna cake and couldn't find a recipe so just kept adding butter, milk, brown sugar and xxx sugar and figured it out.  Husband agrees. Thanks
