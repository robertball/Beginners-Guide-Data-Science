These are excellent!  Not only are they beautiful and easy to adapt to different preferences (nuts, different flavor chips, etc.), but they are also DELICIOUS.  I gave out a bunch as gifts last year...everyone wanted the recipe and several of my gift recipients turned around and made some for their family and friends.

We've used this recipe for years as a Christmas craft at our yearly homeschool craft day. Our recipe is the same, except we use 1/2 teaspoon of salt and 1/2 cup white sugar. Friends/family have raved about this Christmas gift. We cut circles of Christmas material with crazy scissors, wrap a rubberband around the base of the lid, print baking directions on cardstock, hole punch and tie ribbon with directions attached around the base of the lid. Enjoy!  This one's a KEEPER!

I decreased the salt to 1 tsp with no loss of taste.  I also increased the semisweet chocolate chips to 3/4 cup and decreased the vanilla (white) baking chips to 1/4 cup.  I had to bake mine 35 minutes for it to be done in the middle using an 8 x 8 inch baking pan.

There is too much salt in this and there isn't baking soda or powder listed. This must be an error. Think twice before you try this one!

These brownies are fantastic!  Since we don't eat a lot of sugar they were very sweet to us.  I reduced the salt to 1/2 tsp, omitted the nuts, used 1 cup semi-sweet chips omitting the vanilla chips.  I think the oil could be reduced some as the mixture was very oily and when they were cut the bottom had beads of oil.  I baked for 35 minutes in a 7x11 pan.  I would use this recipe again!  The mix in the jar fit perfectly in a wide mouth quart jar as the instructions suggest.  After sitting for 3 days in the jar my brown sugar did clump, but it was still soft enough to mash with my fingers.  It's a cute and delicious gift that you can throw together very quickly and your recipient will be grateful!
