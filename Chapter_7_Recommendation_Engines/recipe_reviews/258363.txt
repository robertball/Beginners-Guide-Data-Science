This was delicious! I halved the recipe as didn't need that much. Froze part of the batch and baked the rest into an applesauce yogurt cake. Will definitely make again.

I use this with rhubarb from the garden.  I have to admit I use a pound of strawberries, "some" apples, and whatever rhubard looks ripe when I make it.  I cook it for almost an hour.  It is always delicious.

Loved, loved, loved it! So easy,  too.  Made it exactly as directed.  I plan to add the leftovers to my oatmeal tomorrow morning.
