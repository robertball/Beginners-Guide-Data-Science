I don't have the patience to fry tortillas. I just fire up the double ovens, spray the tortillas with butter flavored Pam (on both sides) and put them in the oven, turning once.

These are great--to make them healthier, I sprayed them with butter-flavored cooking spray and baked them at 425 until they started to brown--wonderful crunch!

Excellent recipe! I cut the tortillas with a pizza cutter which made it easy and gave the chips a uniform shape. I seasoned them with a mix of salt, cumin and chili powder. I've also baked them instead of frying - sprayed them with Pam and used the same seasonings then baked at 350 for 8 minutes flipped them and baked them for another 7 minutes. These are fabulous served warm with homemade salsa and guacamole!

I put these chips in my deep fryer and they turned out nicely. Not my favorite tortilla chip, but pretty darn good. I used two different corn tortillas... one had been in the fridge for a few days and the other I bought just today. I found that the older tortillas came out better... they were thinner and tasted more like store bought chips. The fresher ones turned out harder than the older ones, although they were the same brand. I prefer the older ones. Just a side note!

I'm not sure if it is a recipe, but I loved the instructions!  As someone who is not SO familiar with cooking, it was nice to check out "All Recipes.com" and find even the most simple of solutions.  I baked, rather than fried and they were delicious!!  Thank you for sharing.

This is fine and dandy, I do this all the time. Is this really a recipe or common sense? Kind of like a peanut butter sandwich. I like the idea of spraying them with cooking spray and baking them. I will try that next time. :)

I noticed one post said that older tortillas made better chips.  This is because the older tortillas will have dried out a little bit.  I used to work at a fast-food place where we made fresh tortillas and fresh-fried tortilla chips and served them with all kinds of toppings and fillings.  We didn't use the fresh made tortillas for our chips because the water content is too high.  I would definitely suggest using older tortillas, or letting the tortillas sit out between a couple of paper towels for half an hour before frying them.

I sprayed the chips with an oil mister and dusted them with Lawry's spicy seasoned salt.  They were tasty, but took MUCH longer than the expected 5 mins.  I would guess it took 20 mins.
Definitely a good recipe for leftover corn tortillas.  We had them with albondigas soup!

I served these chips with guacamole, and they were so tasty.  I used a thermometer to keep the oil at 375 degrees while they were cooking.  At this temp, the chips only took 30 seconds each side, one minute total.  I cooked them in batches that kept them from overlapping too much.

I am rating the baking version of this recipe as I have never tried deep frying the chips.  My alterations are as follows:  I stack and cut the corn tortillas in 6 wedges and arrange them on a non-stick baking sheet.  Then I spritz unsweetened lime juice over them.  Next comes a spray of Olive Oil Pam right over the top.  Lastly, I lightly salt them.  Then into the oven they go at 350 for 20 minutes.  I rarely buy tortilla chips anymore as they are full of salt, preservatives and fat.  These are much healthier!

Pretty good. I cut the tortillas in fourths instead and deep fried them. Remember that the end result will depend a lot in the quality of the tortillas you get. If you are not completely satisfied you can always try another brand. I like the fact that you can put as much or as little salt as you want.

Like someone already said, this isn't really a recipe as much as it is instructions - but they still taste great. I'm not the best cook but I do believe that home made always tastes the best. Tortilla chips are easy to make but if you fry them, be prepared for a huge mess like it is with frying anything else.

These turned out great. Per the advice of another reviewer, I brushed the chips with oil (I used olive-it's healthy) and cooked them in the oven on a cookie sheet. When they had cooked about 8 minutes and were still soft, I then broiled them for about a minute. They turned out very crunchy and medium-brown. They might be better broiled for only 30 sec. Also sprinkled some with cinnamon sugar after brushing with oil; they are delicious!

These chips have a restaurant flavor, not a "store bought" flavor, which I prefer (I fried them).  The concept is really simple and so is the work, I just cut the tortiallas with a pizza cutter, fry about 10 at a time for about 20 to 30 seconds on each side, scoop them out and pat them off really well with paper towels.  The corn tortillas that I buy sometimes bubble when I fry them and the tortilla separates or cracks really easily, so I just make sure to keep a slotted spoon nearby to smash down on the air bubbles for a few seconds.  Salt them while they are still warm, but I think the chips taste better if they sit for a day sealed in a container or in a bowl with plastic wrap.

These were really good. I baked the first batch after reading some of the reviews and they came out super good. I fried a second batch and followed up by baking them...they were even better. I know baking is a lot healthier but frying them first tastes so much better. Thanks for sharing I'll be making these a lot more in the future.

PERFECT!   I made salsa this afternoon and had no corn chips.  When I found some tortillas, I knew a recipe search was the answer.  These chips turned out perfect.  I couldn't have asked for better.   Thank you Kirstin for sharing such an easy, simple recipe that's PERFECT!  I will be making them again.

Awesome, although I wouldn't go so far as to say this serves 12 people...maybe 6 at most (unless a serving is about 4 chips each of course!)

I baked these instead of frying. I sprayed with Pam. They tasted just like a homemade tortilla chip should. Then I sprayed another batch and put some seasoned salt and they tasted like a commercial brand.

I had a ton of corn tortillas to use up. So I decided to make tortilla chips. I brushed both sides with oil, cut up in triangles and seasoned with sea salt and a bit of cayenne pepper. Baked them at 425 for about 15 mins. If you want crispier chips, then broil them for about 5 mins after baking. They are of course better and more authentic tasting fried, but that's time consuming and messy. These made great nachos! I also use whole corn tortillas and make tostado shells out of them.

I used corn tortillas with the spray Pam & oven toast method. It took more like 15 minutes, with a flip in the middle, and they're very crunchy! (Probably because they're thick to start with). I'll certainly do this again as it's a great way to get rid of excess tortillas and they make a nice extra addition to tortilla soup/taco soup. Thanks! EDIT: 7/7/10: I used the frying method this time, on a whim. Worked great! Approximately 1.5 minutes per side did the trick for me but I didn't temp my oil, just guesstimated :)

So simple to prepare; you'll think you're at a local Mexican restaurant. Try them with a little fresh lime squeezed on top or cinnamon sugar.

It's a recipe to me; who knows whether there was some magic ingredient or step if you've never made it before?  I snipped my tortilla with scissors and plopped them in the hot oil and voila!  Next time I'll try making nachos with them...

I make chips like this ALL the time, This is the ONLY way to make homemade chips, taco shells or tostadas. It's cheaper and more convenient. I also make taco salad shells using a metal ladle and flour tortillas in the deep fryer. ALL delicious to include corn tortillas and white corn tortillas! (yes it is common sence per another review but beginner cooks just might not know how to make this, I think it's a great add to AR just for this reason alone). Thanks for sharing.

OMG, these are absolutely addicting.  I prepared them exactly as written and I ate the first two batches all  by myself because they were so good.   I had to make myself stop eating them!

I had some leftover corn tortillas that were not used with my enchiladas...and did not want them to go to waste.  I cut them into eighths, sprayed 'em with olive oil, salted and baked!  Very easy and delicious.  I will be making this over and over again!  This is tons healthier than a bag of chips!

REALLY GOOD!  I did bake them though... I brushed them with oil and baked for 11-12 minutes at 400.  Didn't even have to turn them.  Yummy!

I make tortillas at least 3 times a week and chips fairly frequently, so here are my tips to help you out: (1) If you want to make chips from homemade tortillas, you need to be sure to press the dough VERY thin - as thin as possible - before cooking them.  A tortilla that is thick & moist will not crisp up when frying it.  It's perfectly acceptable to use store-bought tortillas if you're not able to do this.  (2) Place a stack of tortillas on a cutting board, slice them in half, place one half on top of the other, and slice in thirds.  (3) I personally don't use a thermometer to test the temperature of the oil; slightly below medium-high works fine. A good way to check is by placing one tortilla in it and see if it sizzles, in which case it is properly heated. (4) The first batch always turns out funky.  (5) Remove the chips from the oil as soon as they're light golden - not dark golden - don't let them burn. (6) I personally don't salt my chips.  Store in air-tight container.

Took reviewer Breeze's advice and baked them and they turned out well.  Honestly for the price and the trouble I am just going to rely on Tostito from now on.  Don't get me wrong these are really good, but with a 1 yr. old I just don't have the time (or the patience) to do this.  Thanks for the post.

Have always made tortilla chips this way, especially when making enchiladas.  My family can't get enough of them and most definitely prefer to store bought!  OK, so pan frying may add a few calories, but when properly drained and patted with paper towel, not very greasy at all!  Thank you for sharing, the best tortilla chips ever!

I did two batches of these, one fried and one baked.  Sure, one way is much healthier but the texture didn't even compare.  The fried chips were so light and crunchy and really good.

I have been doing this for a few years...they are easy and so good, kids LOVE them.  We also began experimenting with different flavors like cinnamon sugar, garlic, or favorite seasoning salts.  They are great!

Must read notes... The oil will decrease in temp for every batch so make sure to allow it to heat back up before the next batch.  If it's too hot the chips will burn quickly.  If it's not hot enough or you haven't left the chips in long enough they will be rubbery when serving.  After adding the tortillas wait for the bubbles in the oil to subside to almost nothing and I have perfect chips every time.

These were tasty, really simple and easy, although lacking flavour. Had to douse them in lime juice, which enhanced them and made them even better. However, I no longer need to buy tortilla chips from the package.

I've tried these baked and fried and they're great either way.  If you bake them, they'll probably be soft the next day, but just toss them back in the oven to toast them back up.  We don't live in the U.S. and can't get tortillas here, so these were especially yummy.  Probably if we lived in the States, I would just buy chips at the store, but these are great - very Mexican restaurant-tasting!

I used my fry daddy and flour tortillas, used seasoned salt mildly after I pulled them out of the fryer.  How is this not a recipe?  I woudln't know how to cook chips, quite honestly.  This was awesome, and buy "baked chips" if you want healthy, these are yummy.

I did the baking thing. Cut each tortilla into six wedges, sprinkled with sea salt and baked at 375 (350 in most other ovens) about 5 minutes. Crunchy and delicious!

Apparently spicing along with the salts, add Ranch packet mix, Paprika and Garlic Powder will create a Cool Ranch chip.

5 Star would be for the baked version, been doing it for years.  Started with the frying and switched.  Easier, healthier and less clean up.  Brush with oil, put a seasoned spice blend on and bake at 350 about 6-8 minutes each side depending on stove's oven temp range.

Perfect chips!  Like them even better than the name brand chips!!  YUM!!  Now I just need to figure out how to keep large batches of them from getting stale as they can be rather labor intensive when making corn tortillas from scratch for a family of 6.

Very good recipe! These are hard to stop eating if you start while frying them! Since it didn't specify what oil to use, I used olive oil. I also salted with seasoning salt as the recipe didn't specify what salt to use either.

I'm more for healthier eating. I baked these at the recommend 425 degrees F. until crisp. I have always hated throwing away the last of my tortillas. Now I have my 2 1/2 and 5 year old use a pizza cutter and make chips as a snack for themselves. Thanks for posting this

Amazing! You really appreciate the taste of homemade tortilla chips (versus store bought) when you make them fresh. I sprinkled them with popcorn salt instead of table sat. I also made some tostadas using whole tortillas.

A rather "standard" recipe, however, you can lift it up to a higher level by mixing a cup of lime juice with a 1/4 cup of salt and lightly brushing the chips before frying, allow chips to dry a few minutes on toweling before dunking into the fryer.

Very good.  For flavor I used a mixture of lawry seasoning salt, garlic powder and dry hidden valley ranch dip mix.  Almost as good as a Dorito.

Excellent.  A little less than a minute in the deep fryer, until they were lightly brown.  I salted them fresh out of the fryer.

I love tortilla chips with no salt on them but you cant find them at the store, this was the perfect solution. So easy and so good. Taste like I got them in Mexico. Thanks so much.

This is definitely a handy trick to know, but I would say the 'creator' of this recipe has only fried them and simply guessed at the oven cook time. 
I chose to bake mine to make them healthier, so I brushed them with olive oil, lightly salted and baked them for about 20min at 370 degrees until they were nice and crunchy. 
I realize that the different moisture content in fresh vs older tortillas will alter the baking time, but there is no way that they could be done at 350 in 5 min unless they had already been sitting on the counter, on a plate for a day or two before you made them into chips. 
Next time, I will start the baking time at probably 18-20 min and then check them often to make sure they don't brown too much.

Based on the feedback, I decided to give baking a try.  Yummy and healthy!  I baked some old corn tortillas (cut in to chip size wedgest) at 400 degrees for 10 minutes.  Prior to baking, I sprayed olive oil spray on them and seasoned them liberally with salt, pepper, onion powder, chili powder.  Surprisingly, they were crispy like chips.  To reheat, just pop into a paper bag in the microwave for 15 minute increments until heated to your liking.

Like others, I've been doing this for many years and there is simply no comparison between homemade and bagged chips. In my opinion, if you've taken the time to impress your guests with your homemade salsa and guacamole, it's criminal to offer bagged chips. Be careful when salting, it's best to taste them with the salsa you're serving before adding salt. If you make them ahead of time, just heat them in a warm oven before serving, they'll be super crisp.

I baked these instead of frying. I cut them into wedges with scissors, sprayed one side with some vegetable oil spray, sprinkled some cajun seasoning on them, placed on a cookie sheet at baked at 400 degrees for 10 minutes. Delicious enough to eat on their own!

The time in the oven needs to be exact according to the recipe.  I used a tall mister/ sprayer bottle from a craft store.  It resides in the 'fridge' door.  The spices are combined in a "salt shaker" for even distribution.  I use two large baking pans and in less than an hour I have a bag's worth done for less than 1/4 of the cost.  At cayenne pepper if you dare!

These were delicious! I cut up the tortillas, then layed flat on a baking sheet and sprayed each side with smart balance spray (for the illusion of healthiness :P). i added salt to one side, and baked for about 12 minutes, and didn't even have to turn over. Thanks!

I found this recipe yesterday and thought I would give it a try for a party last night.  Was wonderful!!  Very quick and easy to make.  I baked rather than fried and lightly salted the chips before baking.  I can see using different seasonings to make different flavors.  Thank you for the recipe!!

Agreeing with many reviews, this is more instructions than a recipe...but homemade tortilla chips are wonderful.  Just a thought for those thinking to use cinnamon & sugar, or honey, or any other sweet topping.....try using flour tortillas.  After living in AZ & TX for 12 years, I've learned fried flour tortillas work better for more dessert/sweet chips.

I saw someone else’s comment about topping the fried chips with cinnamon and sugar and that just really got my mind going! It made me think of sopapillas the Hispanic fried dough dessert so I sprinkled mine with the cinnamon sugar mixture, drizzled with honey and chocolate syrup put a scoop of vanilla ice cream on them and some sliced almonds, it was sinfully delicious!

Sometimes I need ideas to use up left over ingredients without having to buy more ingredients.  This is as simple as it get.  Why didn't I think of it before?  That's why I appreciate even 2 ingredient receipts that are just too simple but at times necessary. Taste is good!

I made this recipe to test it with some flour tortillas that I had leftover from another recipe from this site. I must say that I used some remnant melted butter I had in a pan from another recipe. I mildly moistened them and then put them in the oven at 450F for 5 minutes. It was delicious. Next time, I will make them using this technique. It uses less oil and the results are equally crispy.  I know this sounds like an extreme change to the recipe but honestly try it.  It is definitely a fast way to make chips out of remnant tortillas to prevent food waste.

Simple easy recipe. I buy extra thin tortillas at my local Mexican Supermarket. These tortillas are made for frying into chips. I use my deep fryer  and they are ready a lot quicker than frying in a pan.

Simple and straight forward just like a recipe should be! I read other comments questioning if this was really a recipe or just common sense. With store bought tortilla chips so readily available I imagine there are many people that have never made their own chips or even thought to do so.  It definitely takes more thought and effort than just slapping some peanut butter on a piece of bread. I consider myself a seasoned cook  and thought I knew how to make these but came here to make sure I had it right so I'm glad this recipe was posted. Thanks for sharing!

I baked these and tried brushing them with coconut oil and a separate batch with vegetable oil. My daughter loved them both.  I also tried salt and seasoning salt separately. Again, my daughter loved them. We now have a new snack that I will make often.

I sprayed the corn tortillas with butter flavored Pam on both sides before I cut them with a pizza cutter. 5 minutes; turn; 5 more minutes at 425 degrees, because I had other food in the oven.  I liked the crisper ones (some stayed soft). I'm not sure what could have made it more flavorful, but even with seasoning, I thought they were bland.

I make these all the time and even use whole wheat tortillas. People love them both ways.

Frying is great but, I use those "racks" that once can slip into a baking pan, without the pan.  This way, both sides are cooked at the same time and the oven can hold two sets of the racks.  Organic baking spray on both sides, salt - sometimes a touch of paprika... and into the pre-heated 425 oven they go.

Monitor carefully, the tortillas cook quickly. I found that the chips fry up nicely after about 30 seconds.

Going to have to try this again.  Can't remember if we liked them better with flour tortillas or corn, and it has been a while.

I used the baking method and flour tortillas.  Excellent!  Want to try again with corn tortillas as recipe states.  Definitely used lots of oil though(I baked because it was less messy, not because I wanted these to be low fat)

I know another reviewer said this was just common sense but honestly, I never thought of using corn tortillas for this purpose. Last month I was at a friends house and they made tacos by frying corn tortillas in half. It was so delicious (and so different, I always make my tacos with flour tortillas - technically a burrito I guess)..Fast forward to tonight kids and I were wanting nachos but I did not want to load 4 kids up just to go get some tortilla chips...then I thought "hmm..." and googled to make sure there was no fancy trick required for tortilla chips. There isn't and so I made these and they were delicious and really makes nachos even cheaper to make. I used older corn tortillas also.

This is a great chip recipe when made exactly as it is  written! I don't understand why so many people post a rating when they don't even follow this most basic recipe!

This is FANTASTIC. I know some people say it isn't a recipe, it is an idea, but I think its a great idea! I used super low carb, low calorie wraps, and it worked great. I baked one batch and fried the other in Canola Oil. The baked batch was terrible (probably because of the type of tortilla I was using), but the fried batch was great.  Even fried these are still much healthier than store-bought chips b/c you can use low calorie low carb kind.  Thanks for the great idea/recipe!

Yumm! There is nothing like frying some fresh corn tortilla chips in oil! I put a lot of salt on mine while warm! Maybe not as healthy but much better tasting than baked if you ask me :)

We absolutely devoured these chips. For our tex-mex dinner tonight, I fried the chips before preparing the refried beans, corn and rice, etc. But these were so good that I decided to just make nachos. I used only 3 cups of oil and added a little garlic powder as suggested by another reviewer. We will make these again and again - no more store chips : )

Loved them warm. You can reheat in the oven if they get soggy to crisp up a little.

very tasty.  I took others advice and sprayed with Pam cooking spray and it helped take away some of the dryness.
