Great! - A Killer recipe!  The Corn Nuts are not optional!  Fresh, delicious and oh so good!  I served this with Coconut crusted chicken and grilled pineapple and peppers.  A perfect meal.

My whole family really enjoyed this salad.  It was a nice change of pace to traditional coleslaw.  My only variation was the CornNuts.  I couldn't locate them. (My husband suggested I grab a handful from a bar!) I used sesame sticks instead.  I just broke them up a bit and sprinkled them over the top before serving.  Delish!!

This is great!  I didn't add corn nuts and used lemon juice instead of pineapple juice.  I think day 2 is best for eating it as the flavors can marinate with themselves.

Wow! Amazing taste and flavor, totally a keeper! I added 1 tsp. of sriracha and thank God I listened to my husband for not adding more otherwise it would've been too hot for us. Also I didn't have any cabbage and felt lazy to go to the grocery store so used Romaine lettuce instead. It was actually pretty good but I am convinced that using cabbage (red or green) would've been a better choice. Also substituted sunflower seeds for corn nuts. Can't wait to make this again. Another fabulous recipe from Chef John...thank you!

This is a really nice "change of pace" coleslaw recipe! I've never used Jicama before and bought an old, thick skinned one which didn't have the nice sweet flavor it should have had...so I only put a small amount in the salad. Next time I'll know better. But the flavor was great and the colors of green and red were festive enough for the Christmas potluck we took it to...everyone loved it!

This was good but not fantastic.  I didn't think the dressing had enough kick to it.  Most people who ate it Easter dinner thought it was bland.  May try it again and tweek the dressing somehow.

Maybe I should be more generous with my rating given the fact that I substituted yogurt for mayo and I don't know what corn bits are, however, even with those ingredients I don't know if we would have liked this. We'll stick to regular coleslaw. Ingredients are cheaper anyway. It just didn't have a great flavor and I even added more of everything to try to make it taste better. No luck. I think my other mistake may have been putting it in the processor instead of chopping it, but that still shouldn't affect the flavor. Hubby said "never make this again!"

I followed the directions exactly. It was good but I tasted it before adding the corn nuts and then after, I thought it was better without the corn nuts. My husband said the corn nuts were weird and definitely not needed. I would make it again but leave out the corn nuts which I had to go to a convenience store to even find. Overall a good light salad that is easy to make.

Pretty good. Makes a huge amount (though maybe the cabbage I used was not small enough). I used walnuts instead of corn nuts as a preference, and added about 1 tsp sriracha to the dressing. Omitted the sugar. The dressing could still be more flavourful though the hot sauce helped. Didn't have enough cilantro, and I think the proper amount would have been better. Would definitely make again and try different variations.

One of the best slaws ever. Made it twice now.  Recommend dipping jullienned apples in lemon sugar water to prevent browning.  Easily allows a day ahead of prep.  Can make dressing ahead too just wait to add until one hour before serving as suggested.  Second time I added a little bit more mayo since the pineapple really thins the dressing and it needs a bit more heft to adhere.  Total love.

Interesting ingredients in this coleslaw but as with several other reviewers I, too, found the dressing bland. Also thought it made 6-8 servings, not 4. My small cabbage and jicama must have been bigger than the ones Chef John used. Not surprisingly, I needed to increase the dressing by 1/2 also.

This is a very tasty slaw ( I don't like sweet slaw, as a rule), for a nice change-up from my standard slaw.  I didn't have pineapple juice on hand so used a combination of lemon and lime juices.  I didn't have  cilantro or corn nuts so those were omitted.  Please note that this can become a spicy dressing very quickly, so add hot sauce accordingly.  I may even add some dried cranberries to the mix for a little extra tang.

I also kept out a small amount of slaw mixture and dressed it with Litehouse Pear Gorgonzola Vinaigrette -- yummy!

This was delicious! I used a bag of pre-chopped cabbage mix and Fuji apples and had to substitute agave syrup for the sweet element because I didn't have any on hand. It was perfect on the fish tacos I was making it for. The recipe makes a lot but my husband has been putting it on everything! I'll definitely be making it again!

This is a wonderful slaw alternative.  If you're a slaw lover, this is for you.  Don't be scared to add enough hot sauce and pepper, they offset the sweet and mayo beautifully.

I loved this recipe with fish tacos! I did add 2 Tablespoons of chopped green pickled jalapeno peppers and diced pineapple.  I omitted the corn nuts!

This was really, really good - even without the corn nuts (whatever they are!) It will now be my go-to slaw recipe. Two things: I disagree that it must be consumed on day one. We managed to keep it for several days and it was just as delicious. Also, on Day Two I made Quinoa and Black Beans from this site, put it in soft corn tortillas and topped it with some leftover Apple Jicama Slaw and it was awesome!

I am not big on coleslaw, but thought this would go great with some BBQ.  Let me just say...THEY LOVED IT!!!  I didn't add the corn nuts, but did do the rest.  I used low fat mayo and Sriracha hot sauce (because I wasn't sure which one and had that on hand)  I will be making this again for the 4th.

Made it with mayo alternative (canola) due to my 2-year old's egg allergy and without the hot sauce--she had 5 servings (eaten with all of her fingers), along with a good serving of a salmon loaf recipe that I also found on this site: "Mom's Salmon Mousse." Great meal for the entire family.
