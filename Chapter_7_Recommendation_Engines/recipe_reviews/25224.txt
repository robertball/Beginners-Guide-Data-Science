I’ve made this recipe every week since finding it.  This is a great recipe on its own, but I’ve found it a wonderful launch into my own creativity in healthful cooking.  I’ve seldom used oil with this recipe.  I substitute applesauce, pumpkin, cooked and pureed carrots, squash, and banana, in place of oil.  I often add pumpkin pie spice with the squash, carrots, or pumpkin, or cinnamon with the applesauce.    I always add flax seed, and use half whole wheat flour and half unbleached.  I seldom use all the sugar.  I’ve substituted molasses or honey for the sugar, or just cut it in half.  I make this recipe so frequently; I now stock fat free buttermilk.  I don’t like raisins, and find myself adding shredded carrots, dates, pecans, walnuts, carob chips, and coconut, whatever I have on hand.  Thank you Janet, my family truly enjoys this versatile recipe.

I substitued 1 cup fat free plain yogurt for the buttermilk; 1/3 cup unsweetened applesauce for the oil; 1/4 cup egg substitue for the egg; a mixture of 5 TBSP white Splenda and 2 1/2 TBSP Brown Splenda for the brown sugar; 1 cup of whole wheat flour for the all-purpose flour; increased the vanilla to 1 tsp; used dried cranberries for the raisins and added 4 TBSP BeneFiber (you could use any of the fiber supplements).  This lowered the calories to 93 and increased the fiber to 6 grams.  My family loves them!  (I tried using frozen blackberries but it made the muffins almost too moist.  My kids liked them though.)

Absolutely wonderful!  I did make a few adjustments like other posters did: 1/3 c apple sauce for the oil, 2 egg whites for the 1 egg, 1 tbsp lemon juice with skim milk for the buttermilk, and cinnamon.  I used post raisin bran for the bran (because it gets too soggy in milk; I was going to throw the box away) and picked out the raisins.  These are very good and a great way to get a healthy dose of fiber.

Mmmm - these are good!  I made 6 regular sized muffins and 12 mini muffins from a single batch of this batter, and was delighted to find that they tasted just like the bran muffins my mother used to make.  Eat them warm with a slice of cheddar cheese - yummy!
NOTE:  The second time I made these, I did some substitutions: I replaced the oil with 1/3 cup applesauce; I replaced half the all-purpose flour with whole wheat flour; and I replaced the buttermilk with 1 tablespoon of lemon juice + enough nonfat milk to make one cup.  They were still just as yummy as the first time!

These were delicious.  I changed the recipe to make them a little healthier, like others suggested.  I substituted the oil with 1/3 applesauce.  I also couldn't find wheat bran, so I first made a batch with a store brand of Fiber One (the ones that look like twigs).  I made another batch with All Bran bran buds.  Both came out delicious.  I had better results just spraying the muffin tins with Pam.  When I used paper liners the first time, they didn't come off easily because of the low fat content.  I've added dried cranberries, chopped walnuts, chopped dates and about 1 tsp cinnamon.  I gave some away to friends and they said they really enjoyed them (their kids too!)  I'll make these frequently since they're a great snack...lots of fiber too.

I am pastry chef and I served this for a breakfast party this morning.  These muffins are excellent!  They were moist and very tasty!  They weren't "typical" bran muffins because they were moist and delicious!

These were great bran muffins! I decided to experiment, so I made one regular batch and then one lowfat with egg whites for the egg, applesauce for the oil, and reduced fat buttermilk. I gave both versions to my husband and he picked the lowfat one as being the tastier version! I will be making these again for sure!

Yummy! I used 1/2 cup dried cherries but think it would have been even better with 3/4 cup.  Can't wait to try these with dried strawberries, blueberries or cranberries!

I substituted 1/3 cup applesauce for oil and made my own buttermilk using 1 tablespoon vinegar and enough milk to make 1 cup. I made 6 large muffins instead of 12 small ones and they turned out great!

I brushed honey on top of the muffins right when they came out of the oven.  They were awesome.  People who usually don't eat bran muffins loved them.

Absolutely inSANEly delicious, just as written. I gussied them up for a special treat by adding half of a can of drained, crushed pineapple and some chopped, toasted macadamias. I brushed the tops with honey as soon as they came out of the oven. I called them "Hawaiian bran muffins," and they were inhaled. Nirvana! But even if you don't have the energy to get creative, rest assured that exactly as written with no substitutions or variations, these are UBER-muffins. Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

I've made these at least 4 times now. The first time I followed the recipe exactly - the muffins had a great texture but tasted a little bland to me. The next time I used 1/3 cup molasses + 1/3 c brown sugar. That gave them a richer deeper flavor that I like in a bran muffin.
I didn't bother buying buttermilk, I use 1 Tbsp lemon juice + enough milk to make 1 cup. 
Also, instead of raisins I really enjoy chopped dates in these muffins.
Thanks for the wonderful & versatile recipe!

I make these every week. My kids love them. I add an extra half cup of buttermilk & let it sit for 20 mins, they turn out extremely moist & very light. Other then those little changes, I make them exactly as written.

Wonderful recipe!!!  As many others have suggested, I substituted applesauce for oil, used wheat flour instead of white, used 2 egg whites instead of one whole egg, omitted the salt (watching our sodium) and used 1 cup of raisins instead of 1/2 cup.  I also used the mini muffin tins and it yielded about 40 mini muffins.  They are so delicious that even my children will eat them. :)  
In case you are in Weight Watchers, I've calculated the points with my new substitutions and one large muffin would be 4 points on the Points Plus and one small muffin would be 1 point on the Points Plus.  I did use double the raisins though, so it would probably been even lower if you use just what the recipe called for. 
Thanks for this wonderful recipe Janet.  We love it at our house! :)

These were delicious.  I made several substitutions as recommended by other reviewers to make it lighter and to use what I had on hand.  I substituted 1 cup skim milk and 1 TBL lemon juice for the buttermilk, 1/3 cup applesauce for the oil, 1/4 cup egg substitute for the egg.  I only used 1/2 cup brown sugar and it was still sweet enough to us.  We didn't miss the extra sugar.  I doubled the vanilla and added 1 TBL cinnamon and 1 tsp allspice.  YUM!  Thanks Janet for a great recipe.

The quintessential bran muffin recipe. They aren't as heavy as some bran muffins I've had and they don't have that super sweet honey taste you get from market bran muffins.This muffin is fine with or without raisins.   There are 2 things I modify to make them a little healthier. First, I decrease the brown sugar to half a cup. I also use a combination of whole wheat and all purpose flour. I use anything between 1/4 to 1/2 a cup wheat flour and make up the difference with all purpose. Any changes in texture (due to the whole wheat flour) are hardly noticed due to the bran.

Terrific recipe! I took the advice of others: doubled vanilla, applesauce instead of oil, whole wheat flour and chopped walnuts. I used a cup of raisins but soaked them first in boiling water to plump them up and then used a little of that raisin water to moisten the batter. Didn't have carrots to add so used shredded zucchini. YUM! Even my picky teenagers gobbled them up. Thanks for a very versatile recipe.

Delicious and not to mention simple! These were easy to throw together to use up the last of my All Bran cereal and buttermilk. I opted to use 1/2 cup of Land O Lakes light butter vs. veg. oil. I creamed that together with the brown sugar. I added 2 Tbsp. of molasses and 1 tsp. of cinnamon to give it some spice. I poured the batter into 6 Texas sized muffin cups topped with turbinado sugar for a little extra crunch and baked them at 400 for about 25 minutes. They smelled wonderful and tasted even better! Perfect with a cup of tea!

I love the versatility of this recipe.  I omitted the sugar and the raisins to form a batter that I could then half.  One for a savory and one for a banana chocolate chip nut muffin.  For the savory I added finely chopped boiled brocoli 1 1/2 cups, added 1/4 cup dried onion flakes, finely chopped sun dried tomatoes, 1 tbsp feta cheese, 1 tbsp romano, 4 tbsp shredded cheddar, and oregano.  This is now one of my favorite breakfasts on the go.  For the sweet I added 1 mashed banana 1/4 cup dark mini chocolate chips, 2 tbsp maple syrup, 1/2 cup combined chopped walnuts, almonds and sunflower seeds.

This is very tasty and moist!  I didn't have wheat bran, so I used wheat germ instead.  Instead of buttermilk, I used vanilla fat free yogurt.  Instead of oil, I used apple sauce and I used whole wheat flour.  I also used frozen blueberries in place of the raisins.  Another viewer was right!!  This IS a very versatile recipe!!  Next time I'll be adding flax flour and maybe almond flour!!  Thank you!!

I made these couple of times and I think they are great. Moist and fresh even days after you make them. 
I even tried them with apple sauce instead of oil and still delicious.

Pretty close to my grandmother's recipe.  I add diced pieces of fresh cherries to mine instead of raisins.  I also made the dough (being careful to not stir too much) the night before we ate it, covered and left in fridge.

I made these tonight and my husband and father-in-law have been raving about them.  I made changes to make them even healthier and if they rave with the muffins prepared this way, I can only imagine how good the straight recipe is.  My changes were: whole wheat flour in place of all-purpose, light buttermilk, applesauce instead of the oil, 1/3 cup egg beaters instead of the egg, and frozen berries instead of the raisins.  Nutritional info ended up being approx: 96 cals, less than 1 gram fat, 4.5 grams fiber, and 4 grams protein per muffin.  Awesome!

These are the Bran Muffins on the back of the bag of Rogers Bran and I've been making them for years.  Absolutely yummy!  They're good with some banana mashed in too.

Like another poster said, if you don't tell the kids they're "bran" muffins they gobble them up.  Thanks for sharing all your additions and changes!

Wow this muffins were Perfect! I have been making bran muffins for the last 3 weeks with 3 different recipes and this is hand down the best one by a long shot. I think the buttermilk is really what makes the difference (I used lowfat)Next time I will add chopped walnuts too! Thanks for a fantastic treat!***update*** I have been subbing apple sauce for the oil, use only whole wheat flour, adding 1c flax meal, and reduced the brown sugar to 1/3c. Still fantastic!!!!!!!

Fantastic. Subbed milk and 1 TBSP of vinegar for the buttermilk and added about 1/2 tsp cinnamon. Looking forward to subbing some applesauce for oil which worked well for another reviewer. Plan to make these often! :)

We are really enjoy these.  I have made them about 4 times now.  I gave them 4 stars because it wasn't one of those things that I thought WOW! That's delicious when I took a bite. BUT still they are pretty good. My only problem is that I would like them to be a little more moist (even when I made the recipe with oil).  I don't know if that is possible with bran muffins, but I will keep trying.  I decided to start using applesauce instead of oil, but the slight dryness is there no matter what.  I will continue to play with it to make it perfect for us.  As of right now it is still pretty darn good! All my kids happily eat them in place of the sugary cereal that I know longer allow them to eat...that is all that matters!! :-)

Great starter recipe for a variety of bran muffins.  I used All Bran cereal and oat flour and added craisins and almonds to one batch and walnuts to another.  I found that adding a little (approx 1 TBSP) coconut oil make the muffins less dry.  I froze what we didn't eat and have been taking them out and microwaving them for breakfasts.  Works great!  Thanks for the recipe.

Awesome! Used apple sauce instead of oil, added 1/2 cup of ground flaxseed, cut sugar to just under 1/2 cup (could have reduced even more). Will be making this again and again!

This is an absolutely WONDERFUL recipe. So easy to make, and so good! I used regular milk instead of buttermilk, added a little extra vanilla, added some orange peel and cut back on the raisins (not a huge raisin fan) and they turned out quite lovely. Very moist and a nice flavor. Really great recipe, will definitely be using it again soon!

I can't really rate this recipe as is because I changed it a good bit, but it is an excellent base and has proven itself to be extremely versatile.  I used half whole wheat flour and half all purpose, although next time I will use all wheat for even more fiber.   I used sweetened cranberries in place of raisins and I would suggest cutting the brown sugar back by 2 or 3 tsp.  if the dried fruit you use is sweetened. I added 3 T. of wheat germ.  I used vanilla soymilk (not soured) in place of the buttermilk and unsweetened applesauce in place of the oil.  I also added ½ c of chopped walnuts.  These muffins were very moist and flavorful.  I can hardly believe that they have virtually no fat.  I think that 2 egg whites would work for the whole egg if you’re watching cholesterol.   I can’t wait to try this recipe with a mashed banana or dried blueberries.  I’m sure that this recipe is excellent as written, but even with a few healthier changes, it’s still very tasty!

I gave 5 stars, but I altered the recipe a LOT.

I used 2 cups of bran flakes put through the food processor to break them up with a cup of skim milk and a tablespoon of lemon juice for the buttermilk. I also used 1/3 c. of applesauce and three tablespoons of eggwhites. I used only 1/2 c. of wheat flour. I added a half teaspoon of cinnamon, a quarter teaspoon of nutmeg, and cut the sugar down to about 1/2 c. dark brown sugar. I also added 1/3 c. chopped walnuts! 

I made 6 big muffins and baked for about 25 minutes at 375! They turned out beautifully, I can't wait to eat them for breakfast every day this week!

This recipe is pretty good, I took others' advice and used 6 oz of plain greek yogurt plus a little splash of 1% milk in place of the buttermilk and used 1/3rd cup of applesauce for the oil. I also added some choco chips (which make everything taste better) and some strawberry jam into the middles of them.... they are quite tasty! I'd make them again.

These are fantastic! Raisins do not agree with me so I used chopped pecans, YUM!  Next time I will through in some dried currants.  I am the only one that wants to eat something like this which is OK by me. They stayed fresh for the whole week. Breakfast was heaven.

Awesome! These have great flavor and texture and they are healthy! I made buttermilk using buttermilk powder and water that I then soaked my bran buds in. I used applesauce in place of the oil. I used only 1/3 cup brown sugar and then added almost 1/3 cup honey. I used whole wheat flour. Lastly, I added 1 chopped apple instead of the raisins. I filled 12 muffins cups to the brim! They came out of the oven perfectly!

A very tasty muffin!  I substituted applesauce for oil, halved the sugar, and used whole wheat flour -- they still came out nice and moist.  I also plumped the raisins and added 1 tsp. cinnamon for a little added spice.  Great with coffee!

Oh YUM!  I used cinnamon applesauce instead of the oil, added 1 tsp cinnamon, shredded carrot, and shredded apple.  The muffins were so moist and delicious!  Oh, and I used honey because I was out of brown sugar.

I make stuff according to what I have on hand so saying that...I didn't have enough wheat bran so used 1/2 cup wheat bran and a 1/2 cup of buckwheat that was ground in a coffee grinder. I used 1/3 cup of applesauce instead of oil and reduced the sugar (most recipes I find too sweet) to 1/2 cup. Used 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup of white flour instead of all white flour. I used paper cups inside the muffin tins. Brushed honey on top, as suggested by one person. What I found with these changes - should have kept the sugar at 2/3 cup :) ; applesauce makes the muffins moist but I think it makes removing the paper cups difficult; the buckwheat adds a stronger flavor than wheat bran but it wasn't bad; most likely will reduce buckwheat if I use it again. The honey on top was good. I can see this recipe allows a lot of room for playing and look forward to trying it again.

Yum and Yum!  I substituted applesauce for the vegetable oil, and was a little skeptical that this would make the muffins taste less than stellar, but they tasted fabulous!  I also cut back the sugar to 1/2 cup - still nice and sweet.  Instead of 1 cup of white flour, I did 1/2 cup white and 1/2 cup whole wheat.
In addition, I threw in a couple Tbsp of ground flax seed, a heaping Tbsp of cinnamon, 1/2 tsp each of ground ginger and ground cloves, and a sprinkle of allspice.  Lastly, I substituted dried, chopped figs for the raisins.
Could not have been happier with the outcome; I will definitely be using this recipe again (and again)! :)

Make bran muffins based on this recipe several times. Sometimes I substitute ingredients around. They all turn out well, but some more moist/dense than others. I've never had buttermilk at home, so I use sour cream or Greek yogurt instead. When I don't have enough wheat bran, I add rolled oat. I also try nuts and dried/fresh cranberries. I like this recipe because I can be creative. Update: cranberries is better than butternut squash. For some reasons, the muffins are under-baked in center when I used dried blueberries. Throw in some diced fresh strawberries is also a good idea.

I really enjoyed the results of this recipe. I followed a couple of the changes and used pureed pumpkin instead of oil, added flax seed to the mix and used one cup of chopped dates instead of 1/2 a cup. Next time I think I'll add some shredded coconut for added flavour and texture. These muffins are really moist and delicious.

I had a craving for Bran Muffins after having them in the hospital. I know that sounds funny, with hospital food's reputation, but these muffins were delicious! I found this recipe and had to try it. The only change I did was adding 2 teaspoons of vinegar to 1% milk to make buttermilk.  They turned out fantastic! This recipe is a keeper!

Can I give it more than 5 stars???  With a few modifications, this bran muffin comes in at under 100 cal per muffin.  Subbing applesauce for the oil caused no negative impact on flavor, and reduced the calories and fat substantially.  Replacing the wheat bran with crushed fiber one cereal also worked very well.  I used splenda for half the brown sugar, and a cup of frozen wild blueberries in place of the raisins.  This was a really tasty muffin!

I wish there was a rating higher than five. I love these so much. I just made them for the second time this week. I am going to need to buy more bran!
I have some picky eaters in my family who don't like raisins, but I still wanted the sweetness, so I pulsed the raisins with the bran in the food processor until I had a crumbly mixture. I also added pecan chunks. Its also good with shredded carrots added.

This will be my go to recipe from which I start to experiment, adding spices, fruits, molasses, etc. But for my first attempt I made the recipe exactly as written except I used All Bran cereal rather than plain wheat bran. I didn't think about the fact that All Bran has sugar in it. This gave the muffins the sweetness of many bakery muffins but I prefer less sweet. In the future if I use the cereal rather than plain bran I will reduce the sugar to 1/3-1/2 cup. Other than that the texture, moisture content and everything was just perfect. Baking time for me was just 15 minutes.

This is one good classic bran muffin recipe.  I changed three things:  First, I am opposed to dirtying 3 bowls to make muffins so I added the eggs etc. right into the soaked bran.  Second, I chose to use frozen blueberries instead of raisins (and based on advice from a cookbook I have, I rinsed the berries then dried with paper towels before adding - this prevents the batter from turning a strange colour and doesn't cool the batter down too much hence impairing cooking).  Third, I doubled the recipe.  The result?  Moist, light (for a bran muffin) and tasty.  I know alot of people have opted to replace the oil with applesauce or similar ingredients, but I say, what's a little oil?  I have stashed away a freezer inventory for busy mornings and have no complaints.  My advice?  Try these (unless you are looking for a cupcake, in which case look elsewhere).

This is a weekly staple in our home. As others have suggested I use applesauce in place of the oil, didnt use all the sugar, and replaced about 1/3 cup of wheat flour for white. I add craisins, shredded carrots, cinnamon and nutmeg. I sometimes have a problem with them being too dry so i'm careful to make sure the batter has the right consistency.

These bran muffins came out amazing. Perfectly soft and not too sweet. I will definitely make them again. I left out the raisins, and made a double batch. I like my muffins to be big and puff out over the edge when cooked, so I added just a touch more of everything. I got 22 muffins out of the double-plus recipe with no raisins, and everyone loved them. Easy and yummy!

i've made these twice.  the first time i made as written, and they were good, but a little bland for my taste.  the second time, i subbed pumpkin for the oil and added cinnamon.  superb!  i think i will make them again this way.  it's a pumpkin muffin made even healthier with the addtion of bran, and less fat for not using oil.  i will say the oil was not missed at all, the pumpkin kept them plenty moist and deliciousl.  i also subbed splenda for half the sugar and used egg beaters for the egg.  great way to knock out the sweet tooth without caloric overload! :)

I made A LOT of changes to make these muffins healthier, but they were still delicious. 1 - I reduced the oil to 1/8 cup and added 1/2 cup of unsweetened applesauce. 2 - I reduced the sugar to 1/2 a cup. 3 - I used all whole wheat flour instead of all purpose. 4 - I added 1/8 cup of both chia seeds and benefiber. 5 - I grated one large carrot into the batter. 6 - I used 1/2 cup chopped dates rather than raisins. These muffins turned out very nice. Moist and delicious, even with my healthy changes. Will definitely make again.

Great recipe. I upped the baking powder to 3 tsps to make the muffins more fluffy as well as I added blueberries, cranberries and strawberries. Delicious. Thanks for the great recipe

This was an awesome recipe.  The muffins are so moist and soft.  I made a few variations to make it healthier.... First of all, i added raisins to only half the batch, and i liked them better without raisins. I used applesauce for the oil, whole wheat flour, and then added 2 Tbsp of ground flax seed. For the buttermilk I didnt have any, so I did milk and about 1 T of lemon juice to equal 1 c.  I'm sure it would be delicious without all these changes, but I just wanted to try it out my way.  I'll be making this again this week.  Thanks!

These are THE BEST bran muffins.  They are incredibly light, flavourful and totally addictive!  My husband once ate an entire 6-pan in one sitting.  The recipe is also very forgiving.   

->  Use blueberries instead of raisins; either fresh or frozen (let thaw while you prep the rest).  Mix into the wet ingredients.

->  Use "Soured" milk instead of buttermilk. Place 2 tbsp apple cider vinegar into a measuring cup and top with milk to measure 1 cup.  Try with other fruit-flavoured vinegars.

->  Replace half of oil with flavoured olive oil.  Lemon olive oil adds a nice, light, bright tang.

->  Combine wet and dry ingredients and place into muffin tins JUST BEFORE putting into oven, to preserve the leavening action of the acid and base.  Double-acting baking powder is useful, too.

Stop looking!!!! You will NEVER find a better bran muffin than this one. I have made these often for the last few years and have never met anyone who does not absolutely love them (even people who don't care if what they eat is healthy or not)! You can change these with "healthier" ingredients, but they are incredibly healthy as they are. I am a little underweight yet eat these all the time, just as the recipe states. Excellent and totally delicious source of fiber.Thanks. THANKS. THANKS!!!!!!!

I love this receipe.  I make a Thanksgiving twist - use canned pumpkin instead of oil and add dried cranberries and walnuts.  Wonderful.  Has anyone tried using this receipe to make small cakes using a mini angel food cake pans?  Just wondering the results.

I was really surprised how tasty these were! I halved the recipe (using 1 whole egg) and they were wonderful! --For wheat bran, I ran Fiber One through the food processor and let that soak in the buttermilk. I also used whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose. Added a few tablespoons of flax too. --Followed the recommendation of another reviewer and brushed the tops with honey after they were out of the oven...so glad I did this! I shared with another health-conscious coworker and she thinks they're tastier than her usual bran muffins. I'm looking forward to using this again and experimenting with other ingredients.

Really really really good! Def. an enjoyable way to get your fiber.  I did 3/4 cup whole wheat flour, 1/4 cup white, 1/2 cup applesauce, 1/2 cup oil, 1 and 1/2 tsp vanilla, and two TBS ground flaxseed. 
next time I will do all whole wheat flour and 3 tbs of flaxseed.  
may try chocolate chips to make a healthy dessert as well.
try it!

Super EZ and quick recipe! I make these all the time and have used Raisin-Bran cereal or 100% All Bran cereal for all or part of the wheat bran. You can add nuts and dates and for those that think bran muffins are a bit dry... try some drained crushed pineapple. These are great little muffins and you can have fun with this recipe! Thanks Janet.

FINALLY...my bran muffin recipe search has ended. After many attempts with very bland results I have found the perfect bran muffin recipe.  This muffin has the best flavor of any I have tried.  Sweeter than most, but not too sweet.  Very delicious.  Thank you for such a wonderful recipe.

This recipe is great.  I like the flavor of molasses so I substitue 1/2 - 2/3 of a cup of molasses for the brown  sugar.  The extra liquid makes the muffins even more moist.

Great basic recipe, but of course I have my tweaks since I was out of this, low on that, but it made a great, moist & fluffy muffin. I used a cup of keifer instead of buttermilk and unsweetened applesauce instead of oil. I used all whole wheat flour and only used 1/3 cup of brown sugar, packed lightly. I added 1/2 cup of dried sour cherries and a 1/2 cup pecans.

Really light compared to store bought "bran" muffins.  I used bran flour and whole wheat to replace the all purpose.  Replaced half the sugar with apple sauce (way more concerned about sugar than fat these days).  Really heavy on the leavening ingredients - that may be to offset the density of the bran/flour, but next time would reduce to 3/4 each soda/powder (keeping salt the same).  I replaced the raisins with craisins.  All in all a really easy way to get good quality fiber.

Really good!  I used whole wheat flour, applesauce instead of oil, and almost a whole cup of dried cherries (I don't prefer nuts).  I usually hate "health"  food, but am trying to lose some weight, and decided a healthy breakfast every morning would help get me off to the right start.  I am planning to freeze 6 of them... I hope they thaw and still taste good!

OH good golly, these were good!  I only made slight changes.  Mostly applesauce w/a little canola.  I soaked my craisins while the wheat bran was soaking.  Then I folded the craisins into the flour mixture before I folded the flour into the other mixture.  I meant to add lemon zest but forgot so I grated a little on top and then topped them off with some sliced almonds.  These were so moist and delicious!  Thanks for sharing!

OK muffins, turned out really moist. I added about 1/3 grated apple and a 1/3 cup of applesauce instead of the oil, also substituted wheat flour. Tasted "healthy," which may or may not be a good thing!

One of my favorite recipes!

I substituted apple sauce for most of the oil (I kept a little to help maintain moisture) and whole wheat flour for extra fiber. Also, I soak my raisins in warm water for 10-15 minutes prior to adding to the batter. This makes for a much softer raisin after baking.

For those on WW, these equal out to about 2 points or so when made as above - a wonderful snack, or breakfast when paired with yogurt!

LOVE these muffins!  I've made them several times using the original recipe and my own variations/additions.  You can't mess these up!  I also only use regular milk in the recipe since I don't keep buttermilk on hand and don't want to mess with creating the substitute, and they're still great!

Fabulous! Moist, delicious! Will keep on hand as my new bran muffin recipe. May try to cut down on the sugar somehow, for health reasons. Tasted great!

Great bran muffin.  I used All bran and doubled the recipe.  I was generous with the sugar.  Don't be shy about cooking it long enough.  They are good when a little golden and not good soggy undercooked.

These are a great tasting muffin for having so much fiber! I was looking for a recipe on this site that would be very low in WW points. I made some modifications to make each one 2 points. I substituted 1/3 cup applesauce for the oil. I added only 1/2 cup sugar, which was plenty sweet. I added 1 tsp cinnamon and put in a full tsp vanilla for extra flavor. And, just so my kids would eat them, I put in 3 tbsn of mini choco chips! I will make these a lot :)

Following others' suggestions to up the health factor, I used applesauce instead of oil and low-fat buttermilk. I also used whole-wheat pastry flour instead of the all-purpose, so I upped the baking soda & baking powder by 1/2.  I used craisins instead of raisins because that's all I had.  This recipe is simple and delicious.  Sweet, filling, easy, and a great fast breakfast.  Thanks for the great recipe!  Next time I think I'll try the banana and coconut variation!

I love bran muffins and these were pretty good!  I did make a few modifications, but I'm sure I'd also like the original recipe as is.  For mine, I subbed 1/3 cup of applesauce in place of the oil, doubled the vanilla, added about 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and added a bunch of walnuts at the end with the raisins.  Oh, and I used oat bran because that's what I had on hand and I tossed in some rolled oats for added texture. I will definitely make these again.  Maybe next time I'll try these as is or I'll try using whole wheat flour.  Great recipe to put your own twist on!!  Thanks!

The muffins were very tasty. I used walnuts and dates instead of raisins. However I was a little disappointed that they didn't rise and look as beautiful as the picture. Maybe I'll read for more tips on making them rise more.

Really good! I used applesauce instead of oil, cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup, and omitted the raisins (hubby no like!). These came out surprisingly moist and sweet! Even my toddler liked them!

Excellent bran muffins- texture, flavor, moisture, sweetness- everything was perfect.  I substituted all the oil with applesauce, otherwise all else was the same.  I came out with 8 good-sized muffins with this recipe.  Next time I might use mashed bananas and see what happens.

Very tasty and moist muffins! I used whole grain flour instead of a regular flour but it turned out very well. My husband keeps asking me to bake these muffins every week.

Okay. So, I read most  of the reviews, and I noticed that a lot of the negative ones where complaining about how dry these are. I also noticed that they where tasteless. I thought that... THESE MUFFINS ARE DELICIOUS!  They are perfectly moist, although I only put them in for 15 minutes, so maybe don't go for the full 20! Also, I added a whole apple chopped up and that helped with the flavour. The middle was moist and soft, perfect with a bit of butter or jam, while the top was hard and exactly the way I like it. On a scale of 1-5, these muffins are a perfect 10.

Very good! I made some healthy changes: 1 1/4 cups bran and 1/4 cup chia seeds. Plain yogurt instead of buttermilk. Coconut oil and carrot baby food instead of veg oil.  1/3 cup pure maple syrup instead of 2/3 cup brown sugar.  1 cup whole wheat flour instead of AP flour.  1 cup chopped figs instead of 1/2 cup raisins. Healthy and delicious!

These were amazingly yummy! I didn't have buttermilk so I used 1 tbsp of lemon juice &  added regular milk to that (to equal 1 cup). I let that sit for 2 min &  viola, instant buttermilk! Tasted perfect!! I also added 1 cup of raisins instead of 1/2 cup!

These were great!! I also subbed milk and vinager for buttermilk and added about 1/2 cup of walnuts. For a little bit more moisture, I grated an apple and mixed in as well. My whole family loved them!

I love this recipe. I have made so many different variations by adding different fruits and nuts. My favorite, so far have been apple pecan. Today, I made them with some peaches I needed to use up, a half cup of toasted almonds, and a couple teaspoons of ginger and a little cinnamon. Regardless of the fruit and nut mixture, I always add some spices to them, as I prefer my foods to be full of flavor! I like any combination of cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg. Additionally, I typically use 1 cup of wheat bran and substitute 1/8 cup with ground flax seed and the remaining 3/8 cup with oat bran. Like many other reviewers, I also substitute unsweetened applesauce in place of the oil. They're perfect to take to work for breakfast and are delicious warmed up with some peanut butter on them. I want to try a peanut butter version of them. I've yet to make them that I didn't love them!

I have made this recipe over and over and I don't know why I've been so long in reviewing.  So delicious - I don't ever have buttermilk so use 1/2 milk and 1/2 sour cream.  I always add dates because I think that's what makes a great bran muffin.  So glad I found this recipe....you really won't be disappointed. Very moist.

Great, healthy start to the day, I added a Tbsp of ground flax and reduce the oil by the same proportoin. Toss in dried cranberries, diced, dried pineapple to create a deeper flavor! Winner in our household!

The first time making these, I replaced the oil with a little less than a half cup of unsweetened applesauce, and used 1T vinegar + 1c milk instead of buttermilk. These were **amazing** and provided that yummy kinda crisp-ish top that is sooo yummy.

Excellent recipe.  Just added some cinnamon and nutmeg, didn't put in raisins, and cut the oil down to 1/4 cup.  This is a perfect base recipe that you can experiment with.

Excellent as written, and very flexible to suit your tastes!  Second time around I soaked 1 c raisins in boiling water and fresh OJ.  Since I added extra liquid, I increased flour to 1 1/2 c and increased soda and BP to 1 1/2 tsp.  For the flour, I added oat, wheat, and ground flax to total 1 1/2 c.  I added 1/4 c yogurt and 1/4 c canola oil, 1 1/2 tsp vanilla.  Taste and texture was great (baked mini muffins for 15 minutes)...bottom line...this is a great recipe and you can do anything with it to use up what you have on hand!

Pretty good basic bran muffin recipe.  I added a crumble on top and mixed dried fruit.  Next time I will try adding some oats.

I made these muffins with no changes the first time. I did add some walnuts. They were fantastic . The next batch, I tried the healthier options of applesauce , & less oil. I cut back on the brown sugar also, & used some honey.These did not work so well for me. My husband noticed the difference. They were drier & the texture was off. I am sticking to the original recipe. It is healthy enough!

I have never put a review up for anything before but thought I would start now. I loved these bran muffins. I used the advice of using coconut oil instead of vegetable oil. I felt good about decision. I am hoping if I try wheat flour next time instead of white flour it won't change the flavor or texture too much. The flavor was great. I may put a little applesauce in just to get a little more moisture. I am going to add walnuts too next time. I really loved them just the way I made them but I just may try to make them a little healthier...if they are not good...I will go back to the original recipe (still using cocnut oil though). Enjoy!

Love this recipe because it is so easy to make healthy substitutions and still tastes great! I used to work with a chef who made GREAT cranberry-orange muffins. Since I'm trying to have healthier food for myself and my family I figured on my first attempt I would try something similar.  I substituted low fat plain yogurt for the buttermilk, splenda mix for the brown sugar (conversion chart on splenda), whole wheat flour, 1/4C orange juice and 1Tblsp applesauce for oil, added a bit more vanilla, and a little orange zest and craisins. Can't wait to try something new next week.

Great Recipe.  My husband loves dried fruit, so, I added dried Michigan Cherries.  I think it would work with any dried fruit that one might consider acceptable with bran....  It takes the edge off the bran flavor.

As far as bran muffins -- and especially low-fat bran muffins -- go, these are good.  I just have trouble giving a bran muffin an "out-of-this-world" 5-star review.  I replaced the oil with homemade cinnamon applesauce and used 1/2 wheat, 1/2 white flour.  Also added an assortment of dried fruit soaked in hot water (ILO raisins) and about 1/3 cup of walnuts.  Hot from the oven with a pad of butter they were great!  Scaled the recipe for 30 muffins and made 24 nice-sized ones.  ****SUGGEST BAKING AT 350 DEGREES FOR 20 MIN IF YOUR MUFFIN TINS ARE DARK****

Excellent base recipe. I used 2 cups of Mom's Best Raisin Bran (no wheat bran on hand and I wanted to use up the box I of cereal I had); use canola oil at 1/3 cup-same measurement; plus added about 1/4 cup of applesauce. Obviously I omitted the raisins, as the cereal had raisins in it. 
These muffins were delicious. I think next time I make them I will try a dash of cinnamon.

I was looking online for a recipe for toaster bran cakes, like the ones Thomas' English Muffin company used to make, when I came across this recipe. I've been a long time member of All Recipes and thought, this sounds good. I also had some low fat buttermilk I wanted to use up. I read many of the reviews and decided, okay, I'll use applesauce (motts cinnamon) instead of oil and whole wheat flour in place of AP. I left the raisins out, don't like them. I doubled the vanilla and the entire recipe and added about a TB of cinnamon. I put 1/3 cup of batter into my non-stick sprayed muffin top pan (similar to a hamburger bun pan) and used a spoon to cover the bottom of the pan cups and smoothed the top at the same time before baking. I was delighted with moist toaster bran cakes just like I wanted !!! I cut one in half shortly out of the oven, sprayed a little no calorie spray butter on one and gobbled it up as I drank my hot tea. How fantastic!! Thanks for the great recipe !! All Recipes is a great source of shared recipes/reviews and I'm proud to be a supporting member.

Superhealthy version:

-substitute applesauce for oil (I used one of the little containers)
-did 3/4 C wheat flour, 1/4 c. white (although the ration differs every time)
-threw in craisins, chopped walnuts, and apples instead of raisins
-substitute 1/4 C. honey + 1/4 C. brown sugar in place of sugar.
-added 1 tsp cinnamon, some cloves, and a bit of nutmeg
=mmmm.....

These muffins were great! I subbed applesauce for oil and used 1 tbsp lemon juice + milk because I didn't have buttermilk. I also added a sprinkle of baking spices (combo of cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves) because I thought it would complement the applesauce well. It turned out to be amazing and I will be making these in bigger and more frequent batches!

Absolutely delicious - the texture was amazing; crisp on the outside and very fluffy on the inside.  The substitutions I made were simply whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose, and organic cane sugar instead of brown.  As for slight adjustments, I'm always generous with baking soda/powder (heaping tsp. of each) and in this case I added a little oat bran to the wheat bran.    Overall this muffin was slightly sweet and smelled amazing.  It went really well with just butter, but with a slice of cheddar it's heaven!  My father looooved these with rhubarb compote.

Delicious! I made these this morning as my toddler 'helped'. They were that quick and easy. I followed the recipe this first time exactly, but plan to start tweaking it a bit - maybe some grated carrots, maybe some oatbran, dried cranberries instead of raisins. Thank you for this fantastic recipe!
update 12-8-07: I felt compelled to come back to my review because I STILL consider this my best muffin recie, making it all the time. Some notes: I use powdered buttermilk, and use a mix of wheat and oat bran. Just now now I used two ripe bananas and toasted chopped walnuts and pecans, instead of raisins. I used Splenda brown sugar blend. This might be my new favorite version (=

This recipe must be foolproof!  I was going out of town for the weekend and had company following me home.  Not wanting to make the 6 week bran muffins because of the volume I settled on this. I also made the following changes based on what I had on hand.  Used oat bran flakes instead of the wheat bran, used lite orange mango applesauce instead of the oil, used 2 eggbeaters instead of 1 egg, used 1/4 cup chopped walnuts instead of the raisens and added 1/2t. oc cinnamon. I made the batter on Thurs. morning and cooked muffins Mon. and Wed mornings.  They were so moist and flavorful.  I cooked them until a toothpick came out clean which was about 25 minutes.  I just read the recipe and realized I cooked them at 350 and not 375.  This will be my standard bran muffin recipe from here on out.

These are fabulous.  I tried the substitution of Greek yogurt (1 cup) for buttermilk and I cut the brown sugar in half.  Wonderful, moist, and tasty.  I will definitely try subbing applesauce next.

These are a very good classic bran muffin. I added a tablespoon of molasses,  increased the vanilla to 1 tsp.  and used brown sugar Splenda. I would have substituted some of the oil with applesauce but didn't have any so I cut back the oil to 1/4 cup which didn't affect the flavor or texture at all. I like the addition of buttermilk which adds tenderness to muffins.Yoghurt doesn’t really do that. I did find them a bit too sweet. Next time I’ll cut back on the Splenda to half a cup.

Conversation before I made these muffins:
Wife: Ugh, bran muffins are disgusting.
Me: That's just because you've never had them made right!
Wife: Bryan, your mom's bran muffins are gross.
Me: Oh.

Conversation after I made these muffins:
Me: Pretty god, right?
Wife: (screaming/shouting) Mmmm! These are so good!!

Needless to say we really liked these muffins. I followed the recipe except for a few changes:
-Add 1/2 tsp cinnamon to flour mixture
-Use 2 egg whites instead of 1 egg
-Used 1 TBSP lemon juice + remaining cup worth of whole milk instead of buttermilk
-No raisins (just made them plain)

I highly recommend this recipe, and apparently it is a lot better than my mom's recipe :)

Put a banana, coconut, dates and walnuts in it. Yummy. If you have leftover buttermilk-freeze it!

I usually add orange zest and a bit of cinnamon for extra flavours.  Also, I substitute all purpose flour with whole wheat flour.  Still taste great, but even healthier.  Sometimes, I substitute half of the vegetable oil with unsweetened apple sauce.

I think it's a yummy base recipe!  I added chopped apple (instead of raisins, preference) 1/4c of flax seed meal and 1/2c of applesauce (needed it higher in fiber) and they were still awesome - even after I messed with it  :)  Thank You Janet for a great recipe!

Used other readers ideas. Whole wheat for All Purpose flour, milk and 1/2 tsp lemon juice for buttermilk, applesauce for oil. Could not be better. Time, 22 min for 6 large muffins.

Added 1 cup of banana in replacement of the 1/3 cup of oil and they are AMAZING! Bran and banana muffins - best of both worlds and little healthier without the oil. Add a tad extra flour just because the banana makes the mix quite moist. Give it a try if you're looking for something different! :)

I love these muffins! I had no idea that a bran muffin could be so light and fluffy. I stuck with the recipe but added 1/2 cup walnuts. I made six jumbo muffins and baked them for 20 minutes. Thanks for the recipe!

My family loves this recipe, and I make it as often as I can. 

I also tried one commenter's suggestion to replace the oil with apple sauce, and it works out perfectly. 

For those who are used to the sweet bran muffins from grocery stores or bakeries, you might want to add a bit more sugar. But if you're like my family and tend to cut down on sugar in your recipes, I'd leave this one as is.

Excellent. Made slight change though: Added - Cinnamon (instead of vanilla) to taste, mixed equal parts of Brown and White sugar to bring to 2/3's cup level, added Olive oil (a few Tbsp's) to Canola oil (instead of Vegetable) to bring it to 1/3 cup level and Apple pieces...

Fantastic muffin recipe!!!  Followed the recipe and they turned out wonderful!  I wanted to make the recipe like it is so I would have something to compare too if I decide to make any substitutions.
Update:  Made this recipe with oat bran today and it was delicious too!  The oat bran soaks up the buttermilk more quickly than the wheat bran so you do have to let it sit long if at all.  Some cinnamon would be good with the oat bran although I didn't use any.

This has become one of my most treasured recipes. I never take the time to write reviews but the muffins are outstanding. I make them so often for my kids. I add 1/3 c chic chips and so use only 1/2 c brown sugar. Everyone who has them tells me I should sell them. SO yummy! And the 1 1/2 c bran makes them pretty healthy, too.

Very Good muffins. Easy to make even for a beginner. Moist and they taste great. I sub'd applesauce for the oil and used raisin bran cereal and left out the additional raisins. These are a winner.

This is the best bran muffin recipe!!  It is an old fashioned raisin bran muffin.  Not at all like the cakey variety so common today.  If you don't have buttermilk, just use 1 cup of milk & add 1 Tbsp. of white vinegar to it.  Just as good!!

These were very good muffins. I made some alterations. I changed 1/3 cup of oil for cinnamon applesauce, 1% milk for buttermilk, egg whites for egg, and almond extract for vanilla extract. I also added walnuts, 3 tablespoons ginger, and 1/3 cup shreaded carrots, and drizzled honey on top. Excellent breakfast with yogurt on the side!

I tried modifying this recipe as some reviewers suggested by using FiberOne cereal instead of wheat bran.  My mistake could have been that I finely ground the FiberOne in a food processor before measuring 1.5 cups and mixing with the buttermilk.  There was not enough liquid.  The inexperienced cook that I am, I tried to compensate by doubling the liquids.  Other substitutions I made were: agave nectar instead of sugar, pumpkin instead of oil and diced dried plums instead of raisins.  However, I did not double the other dry ingredients (flour, spices, etc.) - for fear that they would be too dry.  After cooking for 25+ minutes, the muffins wouldn’t cook in the middle.
Can anyone tell me how to use the FiberOne in place of the wheat bran - did you grind up the FiberOne or just use “as is”?

These are quite possibly the best bran muffins I have ever had! I substituted applesauce for the oil and the added some grated carrots and cinnamon. They work out to 4 points on the new Weight Watchers plan which is pretty good for a muffin!

I substituted mashed banana for the oil, used about half as much sugar and dried cranberries instead of raisins. After I made the batter I realized my muffin pans were already packed (ah the joys of getting ready for a move) so I used an oversized loaf pan instead and added about 10 minutes to the baking time - turned out great!

My low rating was due to dryness and kind of bland flavor.  I did however substitute 1/2 of the flour for more bran, and maybe since i only had oat bran on hand, it may have been more absorbant than wheat bran would have been.  I already added an extra egg and some extra applesauce for moisture but it still wasn't as moist as I would have liked the muffins to be.

Next timE I will make it with 2 eggs, extra buttermilk and extra applesaure instead of 1/3 cup oil, more sugar and add in a tsp of cinnamon.  I may also add a pureed banana or pumpkin to give it more moisture and flavor.

Fun and easy to make.  I added a variety of chopped nuts.  Before cooking I sprinkled chopped nuts, Honey Bunches of Oats Almond Honey cereal dregs, and dried apples on top.  They are yummy but I am getting used to the bran flavor, having never eaten bran-anything.

Great muffins, thanks for the recipe, have made them as is or with subs (applesauce for oil or adding fresh berries).  They always turn out wonderful.  Thanks for the recipe.

Very good recipe, but I as many others have done, modified a good deal. I used lowfat vanilla yogurt instead of the buttermilk, applesauce instead of the oil, and whole-wheat flour instead of reg flour. I did put in too much vanilla extract, but my fault. That combined w vanilla yogurt was a bit too much. I also just used OO spray and no cups, worked just fine. In my first batch, I sliced a banana and put one slice in middle of each muffin before baking. Great little surprise and kick for the muffin. Second batch is w carrot and zuchinni, we shall see how that turns out.

Watch the cooking time and temp, both or one could be raised a bit--at least for me. Enjoy!

Delicious! I substituted 1/3 cup applesauce for the vegetable oil and made half of the flour whole wheat flour to make them a little healthier. Added blueberries. Made these for my friends and they loved them.

Wow!!  I have made bran muffins before - they were dry & tasteless - gag me!!  These are awesome!!  Moist and flavorful.  I did what others did and used applesauce instead of oil, used 1/2 wheat & 1/2 white flour. And when the muffins only had about 3 minutes left to bake I put honey on top of the muffins & let them finish baking. Oh so good!!

THESE ARE THE BEST!!!  Thank you so much for putting the recipe here, I don't think I could live without it;).  It's so healthy and good for you yet everyone raves about them who tries one (well, no one ever tries just one.)  Everyone should try this muffin!

An excellent sweet bran muffin!!  I made as witten except I substituted craisins for raisins, and I used extra virgin coconut oil (EXTREMELY healthy for you!! please research for yourself!) for the veg oil.  The very subtle coconut flavor paired well w/ the bran! :)

Other than adding dried cranberries in the place of raisins I followed the recipe. I glazed the tops with honey after they got out of the oven as another reviewer recommended, good tip. These are really good. Great for an on-the-go breakfast or healthy snack.

This is a very good Bran Muffin Recipe, my son really loved them. I had just enough left-over batter to pour into a pie plate and bake that when it came out we sprinkled confectioners powdered sugar on the top. As my son said," Man these are yummy.

I made some alterations as others and these muffins turned out great! I used 1/3 cup of unsweetened apple sauce in place of oil, 1/4 cup of honey and 1/4 cup of sugar (came out just as sweet) and 1 tsp lemon and 1 cup of almond milk (that is what I had on hand) I also added chopped pecans and cranrasins.  The muffins were sweet, moist and delicious! I will definitely make them again but will use less sugar next time- I don't think 1/4 cup of sugar is necessary. Thanks for the recipe!

These are really good.  I just made a couple of changes though.  I cut out the oil and added 1/3 c of unsweetened applesauce, 1/2 c packed light brown sugar and cut the salt down to 1/4 tsp.  They are light, fluffy and not overly sweet.  I also doubled the recipe and actually got 24 med muffins and 24 med muffin tops

Baking newbs look no further.  It was my first time making muffins and with this recipe they came out perfect.  Only change I made was to use whole wheat flour in place of all-purpose.

These muffins are delicious. I couldn't find wheat bran at the store so I used All bran cereal. I ended up blending it in a blender. The end result was delicious. I also used half oil half applesauce (1/6 cup each) instead of the full portion of oil.  All in all they turned out great!

These muffins were so easy and so good - better than any bran muffin I've ever eaten!  I used 1% milk with 1tbsp. lemon juice in place of the buttermilk and filled the muffin cups up to the top so they would have nice tall peaks.  I'll be making these again soon I'm sure!

AMAZING!!! I've made practically every variation possible (fruit, chocolate, etc) a million times.  I always half the sugar and use the full amount of oil but I'm thinking of trying applesauce instead!! Thank's for the great recipe! I'd definitely reccommend it...I think it would taste GREAT with a butter base then you wouldn't need to butter them when you eat it (I don't think the oil gives these amazing muffins justice)

I made these for my family and they were delicious.  I took the recommendation of other users to make them a bit healthier.  I used 1/3 cup applesauce in place of the oil, 2 egg whites in place of a single egg, and 1T. Lemon juice & 1 c. fat free milk in place of the buttermilk.  They were fabulous!  I did brush some honey on a few to add a little extra flavor, but it was not needed.   I will def make these again.

I was unable to find wheat bran, so I used all bran breakfast cereal and followed the recommended amounts and instructions in the recipe.  Like many other writers suggested, I used 1/2 cup pumpkin, rather than oil with perfect results.  This is the best bran muffin recipe that I have found. They freeze well and provide a perfect grab and go breakfast.

great recipe.  I've added a little ground flax seed, chopped up the raisins, and for a surprise I put half a pitted date in the bottom of the liners before adding the batter.  these are good the next day cut in half with butter in the center and then microwaved to warm them.

This is a good basic bran muffin.  The recipe as it is is good, not too sweet but very nice and hearty.  This makes it stick with you and prevent hunger from coming up better than some other recipes.  Some of the changes that I will make are (at another reviewer's suggestion) swap 1/3 C. brown sug for 1/3 C. molasses,  I use whole wheat flour in place of all purpose and craisins are great as well as raisins.  I want to try adding some ground flax seed for some extra protein.

Excellent! The only change I made was to use applesauce in place of the vegetable oil. Perfect.

A wonderful recipe that's very adaptable. I made a batch today using chopped, dried apricots in place of raisins and they're very tasty. I've tried the suggestion to substitute applesauce for the oil. The muffins were good but it was difficult to peel the paper muffin cups off of them. I may try a mix of oil and applesauce next time. This recipe is quick, easy and best of all, delicious!

GREAT RECIPE!!!! i made this for a bake sale and they were a huge hit!!! But i made some revisions to cut calories----- i made my own buttermilk with skim milk and lemon juice, substituted the vege oil for unsweetened applesauce, cut out the brown sugar and replaced it with dried cranberries and a touch of stevia sugar and they tasted just amazing.  i also made a few different flavors--- allspice (just add alspice seasoning to the recipe), cinnamon and sugar (add cinnamon and stevia), lemon (add lemon zest/juice), chocolate (add cocoa of low calorie chocolate syrup) and lemon sesame (add lemon juice/zest and toasted sesame) if you have questions about the amount of ingredients to put in for tje flavored muffins just go to my profile to contact me! good luck!

This was amazing! They just came out of the oven and they're to die for! I made some modifications: 1/2 cup of brown sugar instead of 2/3 2 egg whites instead of one whole egg applesauce instead of oil 1/2 cup whole wheat, 1/2 cup white flour And, I added: 2 tablespoons of ground flaxseed  and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon  These were phenomenal. Delicious, healthy, a must try!!

I pretty much followed the recipe, except I used a little less sugar and no rasins. For my 2nd batch I added a little, fresh crushed pineapple, a little, chopped pecans and a tiny bit of coconut. They were the best my husband and I have ever had.

If you're looking for a great bran muffin that tastes as good as the ones in Starbucks, look no further. This one is moist, not too dense and not too oily. Just please, PLEASE follow this recipe as it's written; if you want to substitute applesauce for the fat, then go look for a dry, tough muffin recipe. This one is great as it is and is already low in fat (appx 2 tsp per muffin). Try adding some sunflower seeds or chopped pecans for a little bit of a crunch.

This was AWESOME! Substituted vanilla yogurt for the buttermilk and applesauce for the oil. Have had many compliments and my 6 year old asks for it!!! That, to me, is the best part.

These are the best bran muffins I have ever eaten. I followed the recipe with 2 minor changes.  I used a wheat bran cereal like "All Bran" and used regular whole milk with real lemon juice added. Thank you so much. I have finally found a bran muffin recipe that's a keeper!

If I could give this ten stars, I would! First time I made these, there were NO leftovers and this recipe makes 12 muffins!!!  My kids (ages 1, 4, and 7)LOVED them. I only used half the sugar, as some others have suggested, and used applesauce instead of the oil and they were still delicious...at least that's what I heard...I never had a chance to even try one!  I'm making them for desert tonight...maybe I'll get to finally try one! :) Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

These muffins are yummy wonderful!  I did make the following changes though.  Used puréed pumpkin in place of the oil, 1/3 cup brown sugar and 1/3 cup of honey, 1 tsp. vanilla, 1/2 tsp. pumpkin pie spice.  I made a praline topping of 1/4 c. each oatmeal, brown sugar, and chopped pecans mixed with 1 1/2 tbsp. melted butter.

Yummy! For buttermilk, combine 1 cup fat free milk with 1 tsp.-1 tbsp. of white vinegar. I used a whole teaspoon of vanilla instead of a half. I really liked the texture. They are light and fluffy on the inside, and crispy on the outside. They're also very filling and not too sweet. This is a very good recipe and I will make it again. :)

EXCELLENT recipe as-is! These muffins are so moist and delicious, one batch doesn't last long in our house. I always use All-Bran cereal. They are great plain, or try adding crasins, mashed banana, or any other fruit you'd like. My favorite way is to cave a little hole in the middle of each muffin after pouring in the pan and then fill each hole with a dollop of strawberry jam.

I made these with applesauce instead of oil ,and next time I will stick with the oil. Gave them five stars as I believe if I had followed this recipe they would have been perfect and delicious!Were a little too dense and heavy this way.

THE COLOR AND TEXTURE WAS AWESOME. I HAD TO USE ALL BRAN CEREAL FOR THE WHEAT BRAN. THE STORE DID NOT HAVE JUST WHEAT BRAN- WILL LOOK MORE FOR THIS. I FOLLOWED THE DIRECTIONS AS STATED PLUS THE ADDITION OF 1/2 TEASPOON CINNAMON. THE SMELL DURING BAKING WAS MARVELOUS. I BAKED THEM IN A DARK COATED "MUFFIN TOP" PAN ON THE CENTER RACK FOR 18 MINUTES (GAS OVEN). THEY WERE PERFECT. I ATE 2 THIS MORNING, TWO DAYS AFTER BAKING AND THEY WERE STILL VERY GOOD! I AM NOT A BIG FAN OF RAISINS, SO I WILL TRY THIS RECIPE WITH OTHER ADD-INS LIKE SHREDDED CARROTS, DRIED CRANBERRIES, OR BLUEBERRIES. THIS IS DEFINATELY A KEEPER!

Just came out of the oven and very pleased. I followed some of the substitution ideas like replacing applesauce for oil,using whole wheat flour, and cutting back the sugar. Oh, and I used bran flake cereal and added 1 TBSP of vinegar to milk in place of the buttermilk. My five year old commented on the great smell from the kitchen. I will be making these again.

These are very good. Just remember they are muffins, not cupcakes & you will be able to appreciate them.  I added 1 tsp. cinnamon.  You definately need all the sugar called for.  They were not overly sweet at all. i got more than 12 regular sized muffins. I would make these again.

These turn out great -- light and fluffy for bran muffins, but still with the signature "braniness." The quantities are right on, too. I double the recipe, use chopped dates instead of raisins, and freeze the muffins when cooled. These make a tasty, quick breakfast in the morning -- just grab one and go.

Very delicious and healthy recipie! Didn't have buttermilk on hand so I substituted 4 tsp. lemon juice and enough milk to make 1 cup and let it sit for 10 minutes. Everyone loved it!

This recipe is awesome!  Very moist, very flavorful.  I didn't have buttermilk on hand (never really do), but just did the old substitution trick of 4 tsp. lemon juice plus enough milk to make 1 cup and let it sit for about 10 minutes before adding to mix.  Also left out the raisins, as a personal taste preference, and was just as tasty!  Love this recipe!  Freezes well, and I'm taking to friends tomorrow.

This is a great recipe! I just made a batch for breakfast tomorrow. I tried a little and it tastes wonderful!  I did however, substitute non-fat plain yogurt for the buttermilk, and unsweetened applesauce for the oil. Still turned out YUMMY!

These were great, but used the suggestions that others posted.  Didn't have the buttermilk, so added a bit of lemon juice to skim; used all whole wheat flour in place of regular; used all applesauce in place of oil; and added some blueberries with the raisins.  These were amazing!

Excellent! Wanted a recipe this good for almost 15 years now.  I use applesauce instead of oil and wheat flour instead of white. Just as great.  THANK YOU FOR THE GREAT RECIPE!

I'm not a fan of bran muffins finding them dry and not flavorful. These have changed my mind. I made a batch last night and this morning to take to a brunch today and they are just great. I used applesauce instead of oil, 1/2 all purpose flour and 1/2 whole wheat flour,lemon juice in skim milk in place of buttermilk and threw in frozen blueberries. My three year old has been back for seconds this morning and anything even remotely healthy I can get my clan to eat gets five stars.

I made two batches, one with raisins and one with dates. They were both a hit with my family.  I made some in my mini muffin tins, but I put too much batter in the tins and they looked funny but were still delicious.

I substituted applesauce for the oil and used fresh raspberries instead of raisins.  These were delicious.  I've had one for breakfast every day this week.  Although the recipe claims to make 12 muffins, they must be _really_ small b/c I got only 6 medium sized ones.

Excellent!  A great basic recipe you can easily add your favorite bran muffin ingredients to.  Raisins, nuts, dried fruit - they're all good.  It's a nice small batch too.  I make them once a week for workday breakfasts.  I never tire of them.

These were quite good. I did however dip the bottoms in liquid honey and let them
cool upside down. It makes them sweet and crunchy. Delicious

I believe that it is sugar and not fat that makes us fat. Remember the "fat free" craze where everything had no fat? Manufacturers just added sugar to make up for the missing fat. Result? Americans got fatter. I do not understand all these modifications (applesauce instead of oil), etc, made to a perfectly good recipe. So I'm rating the recipe as it is written. And, it is 5 stars plus! Excellent, moist, and a recipe that I use often. And I don't substitute anything. Applesauce instead of oil? Gross.

We thought these were very good.  Like others, to make these even healthier, I replaced the oil with applesauce and the buttermilk with skim milk with lemon.  I also didn't have raisins, so I used mini chocolate chips in half of them and it added a very nice flavor.

These were delicious! I modified the recipe by using two small mashed bananas and 1/4 cup fat free yogurt as sub for oil, fat free yogurt as sub for buttermilk, all whole wheat flour, and 1/3 cup brown sugar. We ate them as soon as they came out of the oven. These were excellent warm! They were naturally the right amount of sweetness, and didn't need butter/jam.

Turned out very moist and tasty.  I followed the recipe exactly except I soaked my raisins in two tablespoons of my vanilla bean spiced rum.  I leave a jar filled with vanilla beans and spiced rum for when I bake with raisins, everyone should.  It's wonderful. The alcohol bakes out and you're just left with a little extra moisture and depth of flavor.

My grandma used to make bran muffins and I was trying to find a recipe like the one she used to make. These were dense, yet moist and soft. They bake up very nicely too. They are quick to make and the directions are easy to follow. I made 2 changes and that was subbing half the all-purpose flour with King Arthur white whole wheat. I have been experimenting with subbing half whole grain flours in recipes. Then, the other thing I did was use wheat germ instead of wheat bran. I read on-line it is an acceptable substitute. These were good, but were missing something that made my grandma's recipe had that made hers more rich tasting. I also didn't add the raisins at the end, as hers did not have them either. I may actually try these again following the recipe exactly with all the AP flour and using the wheat bran to see if my changes are what made them different or if they are the same. They will be great for a handy breakfast, though, that is high in fiber in low in calories. ty

Our bodies need fat, but not sugar.  At 7gm of fat per muffin, I kept the oil, but I did reduce the sugar to 1/3 cup and the muffins were still nicely sweet but with a lower carb count.  Remember that these are muffins and will suffer from overcooking and overhandling.

Whisk wet ingredients in one bowl.  Soaked wheat bran will get added to this right before adding to dry ingredients.  Whisk together dry ingredients for about 15-30 seconds.  Then gently stir wet ingredients into dry *just until the flour is no longer visible.  Excess stirring will cause tough muffins!

Divide into muffin cups and bake immediately.  Once baking soda has been added to liquids, it will begin to activate so it's important to get it in the oven.

This is the forth time I have made this recipe.  I am always on the lookout for good muffin recipes and this is one of the best.  I substituted blueberries for raisins.  Next time I will substitute apple sauce for the oil.  I made eight large muffins instead of twelve.

These are great muffins! Easy to make, texture is not dense, beautiful color and tasty. And I like that the recipe only makes a dozen. They are easy enough to make a fresh batch when we run out which we did already after making them just yesterday. My 7 and 5 year olds loved them!  They want me to make more today. This is a definite keeper!

This was a good start, I like real "branny" bran muffins. So I adapted as follows:
1 1/2 cup wheat bran
1 1/2 cup wheat flour
2 eggs
1/3 cup oil [ canola or peanut ]
1 cup buttermilk [ I use reg. milk w/splash of lemon juice ] 
1 tspn baking soda
1 tspn baking powder
2/3 cup molasses [ in lieu of brown sugar ]

that's it for me, you can add the vanilla, salt, and raisons if you like, I don't.   Also, you can play with the molasses amount to your taste, and if you like a real strong muffin I sometimes add a couple of tspns. of strong coffee, chopped pecans are also a nice addition.

Excellent bran muffin recipe, but like others, it's even better when you add your own specialties;  I always substitute applesauce for oil, use Raisin Bran to get the raisins, and I always add about a 1/4 cup each of walnuts, chopped dried apricot, cranberries and on top sprinkle some chopped cooked turkey bacon.  LOVE the sweet/salty aspect.  And with all the dried fruit becomes VERY moist.  Update:  I have entered these a couple of times in the ND State Fair and always come away with a ribbon for them.  A great recipe that you can be creative with!

Mine came out:
- Really dry
- Did not raise well. I ended up with 12 small muffins
- Raisins were not detectable at all
- There were no taste or mositure that you'd expect from a muffin

I made these for my mom and my brothers couldn't get enough of them.  I substituted canned pumpkin for the oil and added chopped apple and chopped walnuts.  I used All Bran cereal for the wheat bran and added lemon juice to regular milk for the buttermilk.

Bran muffins generally are not my favorite but this recipe gets a 5-star from me.  Very tasty and moist.

Outstanding recipe in all respects! The only thing I would caution is make sure you do not overbake as they can become dry. But the flavor, texture, and ease of mixing were all excellent! This is the best bran muffin I have ever had (seriously!)......

This recipe was FANTASTIC. I used low fat buttermilk and add 1/ cup of mashed banana with 1/2 cup of walnuts. Absolutely delicious, super moist and easy to make.

I've made these quick and easy muffins twice with two minor tweaks. I never have buttermilk on hand, so I mix 1 cup milk with one tsp lemon juice. I also do half unbleached and half whole wheat flour. The add-ins other reviewers have mentioned sound delightful, but don't feel like you have to mess with these muffins for a good outcome — they're great as is!

Oh this was wonderful!  I actually multiplied this recipe by four as I needed them to feed a high school hockey team.  I used one batch of the oil and exchanged the rest for apple sauce.  Wish I would have had whole wheat flour because I like the flavor/texture it gives.  These work great with any add-ons you want.  I did some with frozen blueberries, some frozen strawberries, and some with chocolate chips.  I skipped the raisins for preference sake.  Thank you, they were awesome!

I made these muffins as instructed, except that I used craisins in place of raisins. They're really delish, but I would use less brown sugar next time -- 1/2 cup would be enough for us. Also, even though I greased the muffin tins with Crisco, the muffins were stubborn coming out of the pan.

This was a two thumbs up with my kids, they couldn't stop eating them!  I substituted the oil for 1 small banana, just mixed it in place of the oil.  I also added a tsp of cinnamon and when pouring into the pans, I added one small spoonful then added a tsp of home made jelly (could use your choice, of course) then added another spoonful of mixture on top.  The jelly was a hit with my kids, they loved finding the special surprise inside!
Thanks for the recipe, love it!!!

Read reviews and replaced applesauce for oil, two egg whites and whole wheat flour and bran cereal created a healthy version. Next time I'll try honey instead of brown sugar but brown sugar is hard to resist. Very healthy muffin!

Thank-you! I was looking for a healthy, great tasting bran muffin to have as a grab-and-go breakfast during the week. I use WW flour instead of AP, and I replace the oil with a mashed banana or some low fat vanilla yogurt. Great recipe!

I had raisin bran to use up and tried this recipe.  I liked it and so did my guests, but I didn't think it was really a 5-star recipe.  I plan on making it again since I frequently have small portions of cereal left at my B&B, but will add cinnamon and ginger into it for a little more flavor.  This recipe is very easy to make and very moist, so it's definitely worth adjusting for future use.

Good muffins, easy to make.  I used pumpkin instead of the oil since I had some leftover.  I like the flexibility of the recipe to add your own mix-ins.

Edit, these stayed moist which was nice since bran muffins tend to be dry unless you eat them right away.

These were just OK, nothing special. From all the great reviews I thought they would have been better. I even added 1 tsp of vanilla and 1/4 tsp cinnamon to improve the taste because I thought it needed something. Used AllBran for the bran & maybe that was the reason. Next time try bran flakes with raisins, or Maybe Cracklin Oat Bran cereal. Recipe states makes 12, but I made 9

Not a big muffin maker but I am trying to be healthier. So, I bought some wheat bran and found this recipe. Very nice. Mostly followed recipe. Had to 'manufacture' butter milk and I added dried cherries and walnuts instead of raisins. These taste very good. Will be making again.

The best bran muffin recipe I've ever made.  My only change was to leave out the raisins and add a well drained 1/2 cup of crushed pineapple.  So good!  I'll be making these on a regular basis.

I made this recipe exactly as stated. The taste of the muffins was great but I felt that they crumbled too easily so that is why the 4 star rating. Yummy! Next time I will try some of the substitutions mentioned by others as a healthier alternative.

Substituted whole wheat flour for white and swapped 1/2 plain yogurt and 1/2 cup 1% milk for the buttermilk. Found that the muffins are not too sweet and quite grainy. They taste healthy, but they won't make it into my favorite recipes book!

This muffins were very quick to make. I used 1/4c raisins, 1/2c brown sugar, milk/vinegar combo instead of buttermilk and for the 1/3c oil I used half apple sauce/half oil. Baked for about 19minutes at 375. Really pleased with the outcome!

I made these yesterday and they were gone in hours! When my kids asked me what kind of muffins they were I said buttermilk muffins because the word "bran" makes them run! Thanks.

I made this recipe twice. It was awsome. I made some substitutions. I replaces half of the oil with 2 mashed bananas, I omitted the raisins but replaced with walnuts and I used milk instead of butter milk.
The result was 12 excellent muffins.
Thank you for sharing.

I love the buttermilk in this recipe!  I always add nuts and dried cherries.  Great recipe and easy to freeze the muffins for later if you're a small family.

I just finished making these muffins. Like others suggested I substituted applesauce for the vegetable oil and I omitted the raisins altogether because I hate raisins.  They turned out awesome and I've already eaten two. :) They are quick and easy to make and a great, healthy breakfast muffin.  Love them.

This is nice basic recipe.  I use dried cranberries or pomegranate instead of raisins and sometimes I add 1/2 cup chapped wallnuts or chocolate chips.  You can add what ever you want to switch it up a bit.  I also use whole wheat flour or oat flour.

I tried these once with applesauce and didn't care too much for them.  Tried again this morning and only changed raisins for craisins and added 1/2 tsp cinnamon.  OMG!  My eyes were rolling back in my head!  Using real buttermilk is essential!  My kids even ate them with lots of happy grunts of approval, even the picky 5 year old princess.

Delicious!  I don't care for raisins so I added dried cranberries.  A friend of mine adds chocolate chips so that her kids will eat them.  Very yummy and versatile!  I have one for breakfast every morning.

These turned out great! I used bran flakes cereal in equal measure to replace the wheat bran in this recipe. I was concerned that my batter was then too wet, but went ahead, and was pleased with the moist result! I will use this recipe again, thank you for sharing it! I found that these stuck to my paper muffin wrappers & will spray them with PAM in the future. EDIT 5/4/12: I made these again, adding equal amounts buttermilk to bran, and they were even better and did NOT stick to the paper muffin wrappers.

Made this  week-end for a brunch.  Added fresh blueberries and some fresh cranberries I had stored in the freezer.  The muffins were moist and very tasty.  It was requested by my brother to make again.  I enjoyed them so much that I made more and put them in the freezer.  I warm one every morning for breakfast.  Great, easy recipe.

Excellent. I made these two ways. The first time, I used Bran Buds for the wheat bran and applesauce for the oil. This baked up into bran hockey pucks--dense, chewy muffins with very little rising in the oven. Not bad, but not the texture I wanted. Next, I followed the recipe exactly. (I found wheat bran at Whole Foods.) These were much lighter and more cake-like. Really delicious.

These jsut might become a staple.  I could not find wheat bran at my Safeway ... and did not want to substitute bran cereal ... but I was able to find it at WholeFoods.  My "muffin tins" are a pair of cast-iron popover pans, with smaller, narrower "cups" than a standard muffin tin.  When I filled each with an icecreamscoopful of batter, I ended up with 16 tidy muffins that had risen exactly to the top of the cup.  Oh...I also added a cup of raisins to the flour mixture before incorporating it into the wet ingredients....  Perfect!  And tasty!  Thanks, Janet!

Great recipe -- as others mention, you can add so many things, very versitile.  I used some of the substitutions suggested to make them even healthier than originally listed (I'm sure they're fabulous that way too):  1 c. fat free plain yogurt (instead of buttermilk), 1/3 c. applesauce (instead of oil), 1/2 c. wheat flour and 1/2 c. flour (instead of 1 c. all purpose), plus increased vanilla to 1 tsp and added dash of cinnamon.  Everyone especially loved an apple version -- 1 c. shredded apple and 1/2 c. choc chips instead of raisins...and another version w/ shredded apple plus the 1/2 c. raisins.  Will be making them w/ mashed banana and choc chips next.

If I have to eat bran, this is the way to go!  I never used the raisins.  I think I made these every week for about a year and took them to work each day.

FABULOUS! I followed the directions except for the fact that I split the batter in half. I added 1 tsp of cinnamon, 1/4 cup of raisins, 1/8 cup dried cherries and 2 T chopped pecans to one half. I added 1/4 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips to the other half.  WOW! Both versions are amazing! I can't decide which one I like better. My kids ate one of each and loved them. They are VERY picky eaters!

Delicious and healthy! Made a few changes based on what I had on hand - Substituted one cup of low-fat plain yogurt for the buttermilk, replaced half of the oil with applesauce. Also used whole wheat flour in place of all-purpose, and dried blueberries instead of raisins. Added a dash of cinnamon. Yum!

So delicious! I wouldn't say that I am a huge fan of bran muffins, but I will make these again and and again.  I substitued apple sauce for the oil, but I had "country berry" flavored apple sauce, and it gave the muffins such a sweet berry flavor.  Instead of raisins, I threw in some frozen blueberries.  They were try delicious.  My husband and toddler enjoyed them thoroughly.

This recipe is AMAZING!! I used the same substitutions as others have used... 1 tbsp lemon juice and 1 c. skim milk instead of buttermilk, 1/3 c. apple sauce instead of oil, and I added about 1/4 tsp of cinnamon as well! I put a small squirt of honey at the bottom of each muffin cup too which made them extra tasty! I'll use this recipe over and over again.

I've been looking for a bran muffin recipe that tasted like my grandmother's.  This one was almost it.  The missing ingredient was 1/3 cup of molasses in place of an equal amount of sugar.  Now I've added a few twists that make it even better. Substitute 1 cup dried cranberries for the raisins, and add 1/4 cup orange zest.  The result is another unforgettable muffin.

These are really tasty, and very moist too. I have made these quite a few times and found they can handle many changes. I’ve subbed the white flour for whole wheat, the oil for applesauce or a banana and a tablespoon of flax mixed with 3 tablespoons of water for the egg. If I want to make them more treat-like, I sub the raisins for chocolate chips. If I am in the mood, I will add some walnuts too. They seem to work no matter what you do. This is a great recipe on its own, but an easy one to personalize and make your own, as well.

This was my first time ever making a bran muffin.  They were super delicious!!  Like most other reviewers I substituted applesauce for the oil and used milk and Lemon juice in the place of buttermilk.  I also added walnuts and Craisins.  Very moist and slightly sweet.  PERFECT!!!

Was very happy with the results! Used milk with lemon juice instead of buttermilk and added chopped dates. I prefer using wheat bran to bran cereals to make bran muffins.

Ordinarily, if I change a recipe, even just a bit, I won't do a review, but I only changed the vegetable oil to olive oil.  Instead of muffins I made a bran bread which was excellent.  The extra time in the oven gave a nice crisp top to the bread that was sweet and delicious.  Thank you, Janet, for this recipe!

AWESOME Muffins!  This is a fantastic recipe!  The only change I made was adding crushed almonds and flax seeds!  Absolutely Delicious!  Will be making these for breakfast again and again!  Also are great with apple sauce or puree banana as substitute for oil!

Very good.  I added chopped walnuts, which I think made the recipe better.  I also used 1/2 c. applesauce in place of the oil.  And 1 C milk with 1 T white vinegar for the buttermilk.  Need to change quantity to 16 to make 12 muffins.  Also added some ground flax seed.

I've been looking for a recipe that mimics Starbucks' bran muffins. This was too fluffy for me, so I changed the recipe to 1 c. honey (no sugar), all whole wheat flour, vegetable oil (not applesauce), 1 cut up apple, and 1 c. craisins (soaked in hot water to plump them). Much better.

It was delicious! As other reviewers did, I substituted the oil for equal parts applesauce and used only 1/2 cup of brown sugar. I also added some grated and dried carrots, which was a good way to sneak in the veggies for my sister, who is "allergic" to vegetables. All in all very versatile and delicious recipe. Will make for breakfast again and again!

I too substituted the applesauce for the oil. I added 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and cut the white flour to 1/2 cup. Also added 1/2 cup wheat germ and or flaxseed. These muffins are GREAT!

I replaced the oil with a single-serving cup of strawberry applesauce (1/3 cup) and the milk with 1 tbsp lemon juice and enough milk to make one cup.   They're delicious! SO moist, they rose really well, and there's just a hint of fruit flavour from the applesauce. Really subtle but so good. I'll be making these a LOT.

These are delicious! I followed the recipe almost exactly. I used powdered buttermilk instead of the regular kind. I added cinnamon, flax seeds, and blueberries(omitting the raisins). Simply delicious. Oh yeah, and I had run out of oil, so I used apple sauce. Wow, maybe I changed a lot more than I thought.

These were incredible! Like other users, I used plain non-fat yogurt for the buttermilk, whole-wheat flour, 2 egg whites for the 1 egg, home-made unsweetened applesauce for the oil, and about 1/3 cup of honey instead of brown sugar. I also didn't have any wheat bran, so I used my food processor to grind up All-Bran cereal. So delicious!

Excellent base recipe.  I modified it heavily.  I used 1 c wheat bran and 1/2 c oat bran (instead of all wheat), and added 2 tbsp flax meal.  Instead of buttermilk, I used 3/4 c Greek yogurt (whole, plain) thinned with soy milk to make 1 1/4 c.  Instead of AP flour I used 1/3 c quinoa flour and 2/3 c whole wheat flour.  I also added a pinch of pie spice with an extra (tiny) dash of nutmeg.  I used a scant 2/3 c brown sugar (dark) instead of level cups, increased the vanilla to 1 tsp, and added 2 tbsp shredded coconut.  Instead of raisins I used 1/3 c snipped prunes.  Finally, I topped it off with a sprinkling of amaranth and turbinado sugar.  These are quite possibly the best muffins I have ever eaten--incredibly moist and flavorful, with the perfect texture, neither dense nor fluffy.

This muffin was too dry for me.  Of course, I'm doing a review on a bunch of changes I made, so it's probably  my fault. I subbed banana for the oil, added 1/3 cup coconut, added 1/2 tsp vanilla extract and 1 tsp coconut extract, used egg whites instead of egg, and sprinkled cocnut on top.  I will try to make these again, but maybe put some more banana in or find a way to soften the bran more.

My power went off midway through the baking process. When these were raw long after they should have been done, it dawned on me that the oven had gone off w the power. I restarted, meaning they didn't even bake at the correct temp. They still came out delicious. My husband loved them. Thank you for a delicious recipe.

These aren't bad at all, but I'm looking for a darker, more dense muffin like those at Mimi's Cafe.  These are fluffy and much lighter.  They could use a little more flavor.  I used Kelloggs All Bran cereal.

What I love most about these muffins is the fluffy nature of the batter.  I did make some changes, because I don't see the need to use oil, when applesauce has so many fewer calories and fat.  Other changes I made included using Wheat Bran cereal, applesauce for oil, skim milk with vinegar for the buttermilk and i added dried apples instead of raisins.  These are so GOOD!

For sure this is a 5 star recipe for Bran Muffins!  I followed the recipe and I couldn't be more pleased with the results!  It made exactly 12 large muffins. Excellent. THX

good basic recipe.  my daughter doesn't like raisins, so we use craisins.  I always substitute applesauce for the oil and to make these even healthier, use whole wheat flour instead of white.  During basketball season, while my youngest was playing, I would add protein powder.  High Fiber, High Protein, Low fat.  Good for snacking too!

These are wonderful!  I love bran muffins, but this is the first time I've ever tried to make my own.  I wanted to make them as healthy as I could, so I altered the recipe a bit.  I also doubled the recipe.  The alterations are as follows: I replaced the buttermilk with 1% milk and 2 T. lemon juice (don't forget to let stand for 5 minutes); I replaced half the brown sugar with honey; omitted the vanilla and raisins (just personal preference) added 2/3 c. flax seed meal; replaced the oil with applesauce; and used all whole wheat flour.  After baking, I brushed the top of each muffin with honey.  Sooooo good and good for you, too!!!!

i really liked these even if i didn't have the right bran...i will make them again for sure...otherwise i did as the recipe said ... they are on the sweet side so next time i might cut back on the sugar and vanilla just for a change...but they are so good as they are...i guess that is why it is rated with five stars...thanks for the recipe...adding a p.s.  they are great and freeze well...have been making a batch every month since i found the recipe...thanks again

This is a great recipe! I did some changes, like so many others. I did the skim milk with lemon juice for the buttermilk, 2 egg whites for the eggs, pureed pumpkin for the oil. I used Splenda's brown sugar alternative, and it works beautifully. I added shredded carrot (about 1/3 cup), and about 3 T. chopped walnut in addition to the raisins (that I plumped before adding). I also used All Bran cereal for the
bran. I baked them for 17 minutes. They are amazingly moist and delicious! 
Thanks so much for posting this recipe!

I hate health food and usually steer clear, but in a recent attempt in being a responsible adult I decided to make these muffins. I expected to eat half of one and throw the rest away. What a shock I got as to how yummy they were! Bran muffins have always looked and felt like cardboard to me but these are GREAT!! I even forgot to add BSugar one day (it was a long day) and they STILL were great! They're a great base to different variations as well. My favorite is to add about a T of baking spices (cinn, nutmeg, cloves, etc) and a cup of chopped apples. Either I'm growing up or these are actually amazing...

I just got done making these and they are sooo good. I used post fiber one cereal, skim milk and lemon juice as a substitute for the buttermilk and left out the raisins. I also used a calorie calculator and they come out to 159 cals and 3 g fiber per muffin. Next time I will prob. replace the oil w/applesauce or reduce the sugar a bit to see if I can get the cals down. I'll make these again.

OOOOHHH  Excellent. I used All Bran cereal with clusters and dried strawberries already in the box of cereal, just for a new kick. They turned out perfect. But you have to make a double batch to share with friends and coworkers as they go fast. No one knew they were eating bran muffins.

I am eating one as I speak and "WOW!" are these good! I was a little skeptical because there were still lumps of "bran buds" floating around in the batter, but if getting a good chunk of your daily fiber intake tastes THIS good, I'll be able to give them to my husband and toddler without a fight! I subbed the usual: 1 T + enough non-fat milk to make 1 cup for buttermilk, unsweetened applesauce for the oil, eggbeaters for the eggs, and whole wheat pastry flour for the white.  I also doubled the raisins, which helped make the muffins super-moist and juicy!  My oven runs a bit hot, but it still took 18 minutes at 375 for them to be fully done.

These are delicious! I will be making these again and again!  I only substituted applesauce for the oil, and added a couple of tablespoons of flax seeds.  Other than that it was the same!  They are wonderful and I look forward to making them again!  Oh and subbed cranberries for the raisins! Yummy!

These muffins have barely been out of the oven for 10 minutes and the family has started "tasting" them.  This is a great recipe that I will make often.  Forget driving thru Tim Horton's for a bran muffin.  I'm making my own now that I've discovered this recipe. Next time I will use 2 tsps of baking soda, 2 tsps of cinnamon and 2 tsps of vanilla.

These were the best bran muffins I've ever made! I was a little short on the brown sugar so I threw in some honey. I also used craisins--yum! These muffins were so moist and delicious!

Perfect Recipe! I omitted the rainsens and they were fantastic! As a child, I loved when my mom would make her bran muffins and I have been searching for a recipe to rival hers and this is it! After making these a few times, I now use 1/2 wheat flour and they are just as good and add more fiber!
I also have tried the recipe with white sugar and had good results too. 
*I always add a dash of cinnamon too!

I used 1/3 cup Splenda and 1/3 cup golden brown sugar and omitted the raisins for personal preference. Makes 9 muffins, not 12. Fluffy, lovely texture. Could use more flavour. I'd also cook them for 13 or 14 minutes next time, instead of 15.

WOW! I used powdered buttermilk, used one cup of water with the powder and mixed. Then I added the wheat bran, 1 cup and added 1/2 flax seed mill... for extra nutrition! Followed the rest of the recipe as is. 
One of the reviewers said to add cheddar cheese - OH MY! With the raisins and the warm muffin, I've found a new favortie! And it's 200 calories less, than the 'To Die for Blueberry Muffins' that are my old favortie! YIPPIE!!

i made this recipe with raisin bran, picking out the raisins & (briefly) rehydrating them in hot water. the muffins are healthy & taste good but we thought they were a tad bit on the dry side. thanks janet.

I'm still eating one as I write this!  These really came out well!  They were easy to make and not "grainy" like other muffins I've had before.  I went half white / half wheat on the flour; used applesauce instead of oil; added about half a cup of crushed pineapple (left over from another recipe).  Ok, I cheated and put a little pat of butter on them while they were hot...OMG!  Oh!  Added walnuts!  This was very good, very easy...will make another batch this weekend!

Delicious.  I have made twice.  I used left over all bran cereal mixed with granola low fat (who are we kidding?) cereal.  I also added a couple of tablespoons "orange essense" cranberries.  That was really good.  Bought the cranberreis from Trader Joes.  Try the cranberries--it's very good.  I had slightly larger muffin cups.  I made 11 muffing and put some water in one of the middle cups being careful not to spill the water into the other muffin cups.

If there were more stars, this recipe would have them....EXCELLENT & easy. I'm making them frequently with blueberries since this year there are tons here in Newfoundland & I am freezing them for school & work  lunches.
Do try!

These were great. I did make several substitutions-- applesauce in place of the oil, egg whites instead of the whole egg, and fat free milk in place of the buttermilk. I loved them!

DELICIOUS! This is the best low-fat Bran muffin recipe I have come across to date. I made these this morning and they were devoured within an hour. I did add a 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and 1/4 tsp of allspice, but otherwise the recipe (as written) is perfect. I'm going to test out 1/2 wheat flour and maybe even flax to sneak nutrition into my picky family's diet. Thanks for a great recipe!!!

I love this recipe! My husband, who hates bran muffins, absolutely loved these, so did my 17 month old. I substituted 1/2 cup applesauce for the oil and used 1 cup soy milk and added 1 Tbs. of lemon juice instead of buttermilk and used 1 cup frozen raspberries instead of raisins. This was really easy to make and you can add just about anything to it. They turned out moist and surprisingly sweet. Thanks for sharing this great recipe.

Made this recipe according to directions and added chopped walnuts.  I also made mini muffins instead of full size for my little ones and reduced cooking time to 8 minutes.  These are delicious!  Hard to believe they are good for you.

These are really good for bran muffins, and they were better than I expected them to be.  I've made these a few times, but never completely following the recipe--I always omit the raisins, and make a different flavor.  This is a great base recipe to use and then experiment with different flavor combinations!  I have made banana cinnamon, blueberry, and cranberry orange muffins, all of which have been great!

One of the BEST muffins ever! The possibilities are endless. In place of oil, I've used applesauce and plain yogurt with great success. In place of the egg I've used banana to great success. I've even added extra bran to great success. Rasins are a must and my favorite variation of these are with two overripe bananas added to make Banana Bran Muffins. Then they are out of this world and just one of these for breakfast or lunch is completly filling!

I like bran way more than my husband but even he liked these muffins.  I didn't have buttermilk but substituted a little less than 1c milk mixed with 1T lemon juice.  The muffins were great and stayed moist until I finished the batch.  Thanks!!!

Dates worked great.  I was out of buttermilk so I soured the milk with apple cider vinegar.

I also experimented with preserves inside the muffin - fill the muffin cups half-full, spoon in a teaspoon or so of your favorites preserves (I used Polaner's All Fruit Apricot Preserves this time), then fill the rest of the way with muffin mix.  YUMMY.

I made these at my dad's house and totally messed up the order of mixing ingredients.  They still came out really well!  My picky grandmother pronounced them delicious and my stepmom said it was like eating soft warm oatmeal cookies.  I used all-bran cereal and skipped the raisins.

Everyone goes crazy over these muffins!!I have made them several times now and I just found the recipe a couple weeks ago! I always add a little more baking powder and baking soda and I have never had a problem with them raising.  I have also made them with dates, blueberries, and strawberries and bluberries together! they were great!!

This recipe is a blessing! 

I made a batch a few weeks ago and we ate them in a couple of days. Absolutely wonderful, moist, flavourful muffins!

I just made them for the second time... and I tripled the recipe! They taste awesome.

This is going to be a staple in our diet. Thanks a million!

I thought these were really good, but they didn't bake as tall as other recipes I've tried.  Another recipe off the Kellogg's All Bran cereal box calls for 1 *tablespoon* of baking powder, so maybe I'll increase it some in this recipe next time.  Thanks for the recipe!

Only 4, because while the original is great, I prefer it with these modifications:
I use 2 small eggs, add 2tbs flax seeds, use cranberries (1c) soaked in orange juice (1/2c) instead of raisins, and add 3tbs flour.

I make this recipe a lot and they always disappear quickly.  I use bran cereal and soak it as directed.  I also cut the sugar back to about 1/2 cup and substitute applesauce for the oil.

I followed this recipe to a tee, but found the muffins to be a too dry & gritty for my tastes. Granted, I know they're bran muffins -- not meant to taste like chocolate cake. But I've certainly had better ones.

I use this recipe all the time.  I substituted 1/3 cup of apple sauce for the vegetable oil, and cut down the sugar to 1/3 cup.  If you dont have buttermilk, you can use one cup of milk and one tablespoon of lemon juice (let sit for 5-10 minutes). I've added apples and cinnamon; blueberries; and strawberries... very yummy and healthy!

Wonderful!!! I made this last nite and didn't eat one till this morning.  What a wonderful treat with my coffee.  I substituted applesauce for oil, added a couple dashes of cinnamon and allspice, added chopped dates along with the raisins, and next time I make these I'm going to add a few chopped nuts just for some extra "chew" texture.  These taste just like what you would get from the bakery.

Very good muffins.  I made just as described, except used whole wheat flour instead.  I doubt I will ever use white flour with these as the way they turned out was perfect.  Thank you for a very easy, seemingly bulletproof bran muffin recipe.

A very good bran muffin recipe!  I loved the fact that the muffins tasted light and moist - not horribly heavy and dry like so many other bran muffins I've tried.  I increased the raisin amount slightly, because I like muffins chock full of raisins - but I'm sure the regular amount would have been fine.

I'll definitely be making this recipe again - it made a wonderful grab-and-go snack on busy mornings!

Rich with lots of bran and brown sugar.  Added a dash of cinnamon and tossed chopped dates with the flour mixture so they would not clump.  Delicious and hard to eat just one!

I substituted the buttermilk with soy milk first of all, and I also used flax seeds (1 Tbsp of flax seeds boiled with 3Tbsp of water until it gets bubbly and pasty) instead of eggs.  Turns out this recipe works amazingly as a vegan recipe too!

I altered this recipe to suit my husband and myself.  I took out the oil and replaced it with applesauce and I didn't have any wheat bran on hand so I used 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup flaxseed meal instead. (We don't enjoy fish so this is how we get our Omega-3 oils.) Then I replaced the all-purpose flour with whole wheat flour and the muffins came out great.  They were flavourful, moist and sweet, but not too sweet.  I will definitely make this recipe again.  Thank you!!!

I made these with the applesauce and eggwhite substitution. They have sort of stuck to the papers (which is understandable). They were much easier to remove once they had cooled completely. Also, the applesauce makes them really moist and nice and the raisins and cinammon are  a nice touch. I might increase the cin. to 1tsp next time and use oat bran to see how that turns out. I bake a lot at  my house and I didn't expect these to be very well received, but out of the dozen i made yesterday, only 3 are left now. They are a nice healthy snack in my opinion.

My husband made these and they were delicious! Great bran taste and moist texture.  He hasn't been able to keep them in the house and so began doubling the recipe. Any that are left he freezes and when defrosted taste just as wonderful. Definitely a keeper!

This is a very good recipe, they come out moist and they're not too sweet. I did substitute the buttermilk with almond milk (I didn't have any dairy milk) and I used 1 cup of fresh blueberries. They were perfect!

I was looking for a great bran recipe I could alter with whatever the family wanted since my hubbs needs heart healthy items. 

First time I made it exactly like the  recipe (except I used oat bran instead of wheat because that is all I had)- delish just as advertised! That is what I am rating. 

In case anyone else is nervous about varying the recipe - the 
 second time I made it - I used applesauce instead of oil (still added 2 tblspns of avocado oil for fun, 2 smashed bananas and reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup. I didn't add raisins or anything because there was banana but did add 1/2 pecans. Great texture. 
Am going to help my 10yr old make them right now with banana again and mini chocolate chips because that is what my kiddo wants (he is not a fan of nuts in his muffins). 
Happy and healthy eating!

First attempt worked great.   I will make more today.  I am cutting the sugar back a bit as we found them a bit sweet. 
Our youngest daughter gave me a tip when she phoned from England on Sunday (only one of our four born in Canada, she now lives in England after marrying an Englishman, the fool, just like her mother).  The Tip; if using fresh fruit (blueberries for me) dredge them in flour first.   It supposedly stops them sinking to the bottom of the dough.   I will let you know if that is correct.   Just came out of the oven - Melanie was right, the blueberries floated and are all through the muffins.   Can't wait for them to cool down so we can eat one !

Very moist and good tasting bran muffins. I also made some modifications because I did not have some of the ingredients at home. Instead of the wheat bran, I used 2 1/2 cups of Raisin Bran Crunch cereal. Instead of the buttermilk, I used Vanilla yogurt, I also added extra raisins. Will definitely do it again. This is a much better recipe than the bran muffins from the store.

Made many times. Used almond milk (not soy) with a tablespoon of white vinegar instead of buttermilk, used 1 1/2 tablespoons tapioca flour and 1 tablespoon water substituted for egg. Use 1/3 cup unsweetened applesauce instead of oil. My vegan in-laws LOVE them, especially with 1/4 cup chopped walnuts and 1/4 cup dried cranberries (or dried cherries) added. Soak 1 1/2 cup miller bran 10 minutes in 1/2 cup water to prep bran for use. Use all ingredient measurements as in original recipe. Bake in my oven 19 minutes at 400 F.  Use paper muffin liners. Perfect every time, almost no cleanup. Bran muffin haters LOVE these!

I'm able to make 30 mini muffins from  this recipe. They freeze well. I send my mom these muffins every month and she loves them. The plus on this recipe is you can adjust it with just about anything and they bake very nicely.

I did make a few changes. I didn't have vegetable oil so I used olive oil (which I usually use anyway). I also substituted 1/3 cup brown sugar for 1/3 cup molasses.  They taste excellent!

Absolutely the best bran muffin recipe I have ever tried.  Light as a feather.  I didn't change a thing.  The oil did not make them heavy and the vanilla was not an issue for me.  Great recipe.

Thank you for posting this recipe. These were amazing. I had to substitute the buttermilk with Almond milk and the Wheat bran and flour with oat bran and my own gluten free blend due to food allergies but they tasted almost identical to what I remember bran muffins being. I also subbed out 1/2 the sugar with Stevia, but they still turned out Absolutely delicious.

I made this with some changes and it turned out moist and taste pretty good. I used coconut oil instead, 1/3 c honey to replace sugar, greek yogurt (add a splash of milk to dilute it) to replace buttermilk, whole wheat flour, 1/2 c flaxseed meal, 1/4 tsp salt, 1/4tsp all spice, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and added sliced almonds with 1c soaked raisins. Thanks for the recipe!

These were great muffins. Moist. Flavorful and easy to make, will try  the low fat version next time!!!   I have been making these for about a month now changes I would make, I couldn't find wheat bran the first time so I used All-Bran put it in my food processor reduced the sugar, I like the texture better and they have more flavor. Also sub dried cranberries for raisins, better.

Looking for a bran muffin recipe, I found this recipe and decided to try it.  After reading the reviews, I elected to reduce the brown sugar to 1/2 cup (packed) and then added a tbsp. of honey for sweetness.  Not having raisins, I used prunes instead; as well as adding 1/2 cup chopped pecans and 1/4 cup ground flaxseed to the mix.  (I also made my buttermilk using 1% low-fat  milk/vinegar).   Had them for breakfast this morning...they were moist and so good, my husband immediately ate  two!  Would like to see calories per muffin ; otherwise will definitely make  again.

This is my "go to" muffin recipe. I've been making these for over a year now and I am happy with the results every time.  I prefer to substitute  applesauce for the oil, but I have made the recipe both ways with nice results. These are very good with added dried cranberries.

It was good. Very Moist. I changed the recipe by switching unsweetened apple sauce for the oil and added more raisins. Would also be good with a little nutmeg.

Yummy!  I substituted yogurt thinned with milk instead of buttermilk and added the raisins along with the bran to the yogurt for softening.  Will definitely make again.

I loved this recipe because of its versatility.  I substituted some leftover yogurt for the milk (like this because it gives the muffins some lightness) and used chopped dates instead of raisins.  Next time I will try some applesauce, pumpkin or squash from my garden. Nice and moist, be careful not to overbake!  This is my new go-to bran muffin recipe!  Thank you Janet!

Our church's local food pantry had a ton of wheat bran donated and didn't know how to use it all. So, after getting a large Ziploc bag of it, I took it home to experiment, did an "Ingredient Search" on this site, and found these muffins. I really wanted to try them, but had no buttermilk or vegetable oil (or applesauce) in the house. I solved the buttermilk issue by making sour milk (1 tbsp lemon juice and milk to equal a cup). The oil was trickier. I did have canned pumpkin on hand and thought, "Why not?" Subbed 1/3 cup canned pumpkin for the oil I didn't have and, "Voila!" They are great. Part of me wants to try the original recipe to see how they compare. The other part of me says keep using the pumpkin. Way better for us; they taste great; and the texture is wonderful. I'm definitely adding the raisins next time. I just didn't want to waste them if the pumpkin didn't work out. Thanks for giving me a yummy, healthy way to use up all this wheat bran!

I make this recipe all the time. I will occasionally add dried blueberries in addition to the raisins, and a half teaspoon of cinnamon really enhances both aroma and flavour. This is a family favourite.

There are some issues with this recipe if you don't use the right ingredients. The white flour should definitely be organic. The wheat bran shoud be organic as well, as that has issues as well.

I lost my previous bran muffin recipe, and when my husband requested them for 'regularity' issues, I chose this.  I made the recipe as printed and it was excellent! He liked it better than my previous recipe.

Excellent!  I used blueberries instead of raisins and 1/4 c. unsweetened applesauce instead of the egg b/c I was out of eggs.  They still turned out amazingly!

I have made these muffins so many times and they are wonderful!  Moist and delicious!  Using chunky applesauce instead of the oil and dried cherries instead of raisins are the only changes I made.  If you like bran muffins, you will love these!

Absolutely wonderful, and making this recipe vegetarian friendly was a piece of cake.  We made 2 batches - one that followed the recipe, and one that substituted almond milk + 1 tbs vinegar + 1/2 tsp baking soda for the buttermilk and egg substitute for the eggs.  We convection baked both batches for the full 20 minutes and they turned out great.  There is a slight difference in taste, but both are excellent in their own right.  My guests said both were wonderful and didn't prefer one over the other.  Success! :D

Awesome! First I have to say that as a baker that tries to be healthy, I don't always have the best success with finding recipes that are both tasty and good for you. But according to my family, these were the best muffins they ever had, and they had no butter or oil! I substituted natural, unsweetened applesauce for the oil, almond milk with a tablespoon of lemon juice for the buttermilk and made half the flour whole wheat. I even cut down on the sugar a bit and no one could even tell. According to them, these were the best bran muffins they've ever had and they're all begging for the recipe.

I suppose I don't like wheat bran pastry because I've tried so many times to do something good with wheat bran and every time it's a disaster. This time I added dates, granola, substituted applesause for butter, added 3 tbsp of white sugar instead of brown sugar. Actually I added one more cup of buttermilk, because the batter was so crumbly and it was impossible to mix. After 2 cups of buttermilk the batter was ok. Unfortunately the taste leaves much to be desired. Hope the muffins will be better tomorrow. But I won't do them again anyway.

I used Raisin Bran cereal, apple sauce for oil, dried blueberries for raisins and added cinnamon.  It was pretty tasty.  I will decrease the brown sugar because of the added sweetness from the apple sauce next time and add some chopped walnuts.

These are fantastic!  I make these atleast once a week for the children in the daycare i work at. 37 little mouths all agree this recipe is a keeper!  Sometimes i'll add rehydrated raisins or cranberries into the mixture, and when in season, i add fresh blueberries. Thanks for submitting!

I have been using this recipe for several years now and it's the only bran muffin recipe I'll ever use.  I love the fact that they contain so much bran yet remain beautifully moist and soft.   For the fruit I use whatever I have in the pantry which could be anywhere from mixed fruit to dried cranberries.

I LOVE these bran muffins! The only thing I changed was substitute 1/3 cup of cooked navy beans for the oil. They were great and my kids are devouring them. Yay for a bit more fibre in our diet! :)

I have always been horrible at following recipes. I like to make things up as I go along. This recipe is really good! I however added a banana, cinnamon and fresh blueberries! They were gone so fast I had to make more!! Thank you for sharing your recipe.

Perfect bran muffin base.  I couldn't resist adding a small chopped apple (unpeeled), but otherwise I followed the recipe as written.  It's a good bran muffin, moist and with just enough sweetness to keep my family happy.  Still moist and delicious the next day.  I was glad to find a recipe that didn't start with a box of cereal.  Very easy and no surprise lumps of unsoftened cereal.  I'd like to a handful of dried cherries next time.  With the addition of apple, the recipe made 12 regular and 12 mini muffins.

Made vegan replacements for egg and buttermilk...did 1 Tbsp white vinegar + 1 cup unsweetened soy milk for the buttermilk; let sit for 5 minutes to sour. And 1 Tbsp ground flax seed + 3 Tbsp water for the egg; let sit 5 minutes. Then followed directions as written.

Made as stated, adding 2 tbsp. of molasses to darken the batter and give that bran taste.  These were really tasty. Next time, I am going to keep the molasses, decrease the sugar by 1/4 cup (they are lots sweet enough), and try the apple sauce instead of oil.

Update: Made just as stated, and were also really nice.  Added blueberries instead of raisins.

I make these frequently, and I have passed the recipe on to many friends. This recipe is very forgiving for tweaking. I always use All-Bran cereal and sub whole wheat for the flour. I  use honey or Agave for the sugar as well. I use applesauce, mashed bananas or pumpkin puree for the oil. I also like to add cinnamin and ground cloves to give more of a spice cake taste.  I've added dates, raisins, or cranberries before, and even nuts; loved them all!  I've even shredded carrots or squash into to mix and loved it!  Great recipe to play around with!

My family LOVED these. It made 18 muffins - probably because I used Kellogg's All-Bran Bran Buds (didn't have regular bran.) They were moist and not too sweet; just right.Used 1/2 c. wheat flour and 1/2 c. white flour, had a few leftover fresh blueberries (about 1/3 c.), a shy 1/3 c. dried cranberries, and about 1/3c. - 1/2 c. chopped pecans (a must with my family). Delish!! Will use this basic recipe again and again try different fruits and such.

I used oat bran in place of wheat bran, as that's what I had on hand. I also used apple sauce in place of oil and dried cranberries in place of raisins. The muffins were marvelous! My husband wolfed down four of them and asked me if I'd make another half batch tomorrow night. This recipe is an easy and delicious way to put more fiber in your diet.

My very first attempt at homemade muffins of any kind. These were incredible!!! Didn't use raisins because I didn't have any on hand but still every bit yummy. Wil become my "go to" recipe for Bran Muffins. Love the way you can personalize them with adding other great things.

The PERFECT bran muffin. Look no further!! Made the substitution of 1/3 cup unsweetened apple sauce in place of the veg oil. I would rate these 10/10! Left out the raisins though.

I substitute the buttermilk for 6 oz nonfat plain greek yogurt, the oil for either applesauce or pumpkin and use 1/2 cup each of unbleached white and whole wheat flour. I have used this recipe SO many times and have experimented with adding chopped apples, raisins, pecans, coconut, rolled oats, fresh cranberries, blueberries. This really is a great starter recipe!

This base recipe is excellent.

I just made these for breakfast this morning with the following substitutions:

-Trader Joe's Organic Multi-grain Oatmeal for wheat bran
-Whole wheat flour for all purpose flour
-Non-fat Greek yogurt for buttermilk
-Pumpkin puree for vegetable oil

I also added 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon & 1/4 tsp. nutmeg to turn it into a pumpkin spice bran muffin. I used silicone baking cups and didn't need to grease - they popped right out. The recipe still yields 12 muffins and comes out to be 90 calories each muffin. They were tasty and filling!

These muffins where a huge hit with my Family, even my picky 2 year old loved them. I replaced the oil with apple sauce and used 1 Tbs Vinegar with regular milk as I did not have any buttermilk and they turned out moist and delicious. These taste absolutely heavenly when spread with honey orange butter, to make just mix together 1/4 cup butter, 2-3 Tbsp honey and 1 tsp orange zest. Yum.

A simple, stellar recipe with so much room for creativity! Since we're a dairy-free home, I substituted 1 cup of unsweetened vanilla rice milk + 1 Tbsp lemon juice for the buttermilk and vanilla extract, replaced the oil with unsweetened applesauce (to cut down on fat), decreased the brown sugar to 1/3 cup, and added 1/2 cup of dried cranberries instead of raisins. 

These turned out so wonderfully moist, with just the right touch of sweetness! I'm definitely adding this to my weekend breakfast rotation...I think next time I might switch the applesauce for pumpkin and add shredded carrot, nutmeg and allspice for a wonderful fall breakfast. :D

This was a great recipe!  To make it gluten-free to suit my family's needs, I substituted oat bran for the wheat bran, and used 1/3 cup brown rice flour, 1/3 cup millet flour, 1/3 tapioca starch, and a teaspoon of Xantham Gum.  My girls gobbled them down!  Thank you for the recipe!

Very good. I made with flaxseed and water to replace egg and applesauce to replace oil, almond breeze with a tablespoon of lemon to replace buttermilk to make this dairy an oil free. I would back off the brown sugar by half next time. Oh, I also used white whole wheat flour. Plant strong!

Yummy moist classic bran muffin. I subbed organic unsweetened soy milk for the milk, unsweetened berry-applesauce for the oil, oat flour for the white flour and a splenda- sweetened cherry yogurt for the buttermilk omitted the raisins and added ground flax. They didn't rise much - but taste great. My try subbing molasses for the brown sugar next time.

I haven't made the original, but with the few changes I made - I Love this recipe! I did walnut oil in place of the veg oil, and in place of the raisins I did 1/4 Cup Toasted coconut and 1/2 cut toasted walnuts! I also did 1 cup Bran and 1/4 cup ground flax. With the vanilla, I also added about 1/4 tsp coconut extract - so yummy and moist!

Just tried and am thrilled with this recipe.  Previous bran muffins I've made have always been dry, these were moist!  I did substitute the oil with home-made applesauce and added cinnamon and used bran flakes instead of regular bran.  I also, used soy milk (can't have dairy) with 1 tbsp lemon juice instead of buttermilk.  Thank you for this recipe.

LOVE this recipe!! I've made it just about a dozen times now and it always turns out great! Unfortunately my husband can't have flour and sugar anymore so I only make them when we have company. Everyone just loves them! Thank you for sharing! :) Any suggestions to make this recipe just as delicious with different kinds of flour and sugar?

Yummy!  And nutritious at the same time.  I substituted whole wheat flour for the white flour to make it more wholesome.  Next time maybe I'll add some chopped apples and maybe more raisins.  My kids loved this.  Great way to sneak in some fiber!

They turned out great considering a couple alterations. I used silicone baking cups which I think were a little smaller than a muffin pan and the muffins spilt over some. I used applesauce instead of oil. I baked them for a little longer than suggested, but they turned out great!

I'd never made bran muffins before embarking on these, and, I have to say, I'm a convert! Much better than any I've purchased at bakeries or Jamba Juice (yes, I've bought baked goods at Jamba - shudder!). I followed the recipe exactly, with the addition of about 8 oz. of blueberries. The blueberries were a great addition to the moist, melt-in-your-mouth muffins that came out of the oven. We ate all of them in less than a day!

My husband begs me to make these - I make them exactly like the recipe states - and they come out perfect every time. I use an ice cream scoop to put the batter in the muffin cups  - this makes them come out evenly. I also use golden raisins - which I think are a better fit than the black raisins. They are the ultimate breakfast or snack muffin. Great on the side of eggs and fruit salad or just great with a cup of coffee.

These are just what I've been craving!!  I'm in my first trimester and these totally hit the spot!  I didn't change the recipe at all except in half the batter I left raisins out and in the other half I added some raisins and some craisins.

Made these yesterday afternoon, used exact recipe as listed. It was the perfect amount for 12 regular muffins.  Had one today for breakfast and it was absolutely delicious.  Now to see if it can hold me over until lunch!  :)  Thanks for the recipe.  Will be reviewing the other comments for other ideas.

Absolutely delicious!  I used whole wheat flour and I used applesauce instead of oil, no raisins, and made a buttermilk substitute with skim milk and vinegar (Google it).  So tasty and low calorie this way (about 110 calories per muffin).

Just like EmilyRose, I also had to make my own buttermilk (vinegar + milk) because it's not available in my country. I also increased the sugar to 1 cup (we like our muffins sweet). They truned out great ! If you have a sweet tooth, you could eat them warm and covered with honey...

I really like these muffins. My usual muffins are from the recipe moms zucchini bread but this one comes close to it! I like d that the muffin is loaded with fiber. I substitued the oil for a combinatgion of applesauce, pumpkin, and some carrot. I basically threw together some leftover things. It came out great. Will make again!

These muffins are Amazing! Even though I altered it a lot, the base of the recipe is perfect. I eat gluten free but I can still eat oats, so instead of wheat bran I use oat bran and instead of all-purpose flour I use half oat flour and half buckwheat flour. I also half the oil and use half apple sauce. They come out moist, delicious, and in my opinion just as good as any regular muffin! I also add cinnamon, blueberries and cranberries. thank you for this recipe! I've made it three times already in a couple weeks

I really like this muffin. It wasn't too sweet, and is very moist. I was tempted to add cinnamon but resisted, and I'm glad I did. That allowed the bran and vanilla to stand out more. As always, the 2nd time around I make little adjustments:) I substituted the wheat bran for bran cereal, decreased the sugar just a smidge, and used 1/2cup frozen blueberries and 1/2cup frozen partridge berries in place of the raisins. Great, simple, classic bran muffin recipe! I'll be using this one again:)

This muffin is a staple in my home. I use applesauce for natural sweetness to cut the brown sugar in half (1/3 applesauce & 1/3 brown sugar) and they are still very delicious. I like to spread a thin layer of peanut butter on them for some protein-YUM! =)

For ONCE, I didn't substitute anything.  For ONCE, I actually followed the instructions.  For ONCE, I couldn't think of anything to add or subtract that would "improve" the recipe.  These were perfect.  Not too sweet, not too dense, not too dry, with lots of toasty bran flavor.  They were excellent sliced, toasted, and spread with butter the next day (not like the typical bran puck).  Regular raisins are too sweet for me, so I usually use golden raisins because they're a little more tart.  Next time, though, I'm going to try the recipe with half a cup of chopped dried apricots instead of the raisins, plus half a cup of chopped walnuts added.  They'd be good served with low fat cream cheese to spread on top.  Cannot WAIT make these again SOON!

i did as most of the others did and completely healthyfied the recipe. i used applesauce for the oil, two egg whites for the egg, whole wheat for the white flour, omited the salt and raisins to save calories. i absolutely loved it. i dont know how many calories i saved but it was worth it. this recipe was a perfect starting point. i am positive that it would have been better as written but i really am trying to watch my weight. this recipe made very easy to make it my own. i suggest everyone experiment with any recipe to suit their health wants and needs. it is worth it to be healthy in the end.

This recipe is really easy to tweak to suit your own tastes. I use apple sause instead of oil as some other reviews suggested and substitute dried cranberries and blueberries for the raisins.

These muffins are delicious, way better than any other bran muffin I've ever had. I didn't have buttermilk, or  know what that is for that matter, but read somewhere to take a Tbls of white vinegar and mix with a cup of milk and let stand 10 minutes. Instead of raisins I folded in a handful of blueberries and raspberries.

A little chunkier than I expected, maybe I'll try to break up the cereal a little more before mixing with milk next time.  I subbed pumpkin for oil and 1 tbsp lemon juice + milk for the buttermilk.  Also did 1/2 whole wheat flour & 1/2 cup sugar.  It sounds like I changed it a lot but I think it's still the same recipe, just healthier!  I think I'm going to make this my go-to bran muffin recipe - I make muffins on the weekend and freeze them so I can just grab and go to work.  By the time I'm hungry they are thawed.

My husband said he really wanted bran muffins, so to Allrecipes I went.  I found this one and WOW! He loved them.  To my surprise, so does my 15 year old daughter who is a junk food junkie.  I went to Whole Foods and bought everything in bulk and organic, something I never do.  This recipe has caused me now to revamp our entire way of eating.  It proves healthy eating can be delicious, too!  Thank you!!!

awesome recipe here! I have looking for an ultimate basic bran muffin recipe and I think this is a perfect foundation. I changed it up a tad by the following: replaced buttermilk with lowfat plain yogurt used dark brown sugar added 1/2 tsp of almond extract added 2 Tblsp molasses added a tablespoon butter to the oil

Loved these!  The kids even devoured them.  Did what other readers suggested, using apple sauce instead of oil.  I didn't have plain applesauce, so I used one of the little lunch-sized apple and banana sauce.  Turned out great!

Like other reviewers, I substituted the oil for applesauce. I upped the vanilla to 1tsp and added 1tsp cinnamon. I used dates instead of raisins as I thought they'd add natural sweetness, and used All Bran cereal as the wheat bran. The muffins have come out well-risen, soft, moist, and delicious! A lovely recipe, I will be making these again.

These were great! Like another reviewer I used skim milk with 1 tsp of lemon juice in place of buttermilk. I also used raisin bran instead of wheat bran and raisins and they were delicious. Not too sweet and perfectly moist. Will definitely make them again!

These are excellent. I did use 5 TBS of Splenda BS blend instead of straight BS. In addition to the wheat bran I added 1/4C. of wheat germ to boost the fiber. LOVED THEM. Great with chocolate chips instead of raisins. Tastes great the next day. Very moist.

Delicious and moist! I substituted the buttermilk for 1 cup of fat free milk and 1 tablespoon of lemon juice, and it turned out great. I cut the recipe in half though to make less, and I still got 9 medium-sized muffins out of it! Definitely will make again.

These were dense, wholesome & satisfying but unfortunately a bit bland for my taste. Of course this was easily remedied- I served them with whipped cream cheese and they were quite delicious! I'd like to try this recipe again with a bit more fat in the muffins themselves.

OMG! These were SO good! I used the base recipe with the following substitutions.....used applesauce instead of oil, homemade yogurt for the buttermilk and molasses instead of sugar. I added cinnamon, allspice, and ginger and doubled the raisins. These were super moist and delicious!

First time making bran muffins so this recipe was good. After reviewing several recipes I made a few changes though: used a little applesauce to make up some of the oil meas. and used chopped dates and pecans instead of raisins. I also used molasses and honey with a little of the brown sugar for the sweetness.

Makes great muffins! The buttermilk makes them moist and the wheat bran adds a great texture. I added 1 cup of chopped walnuts instead of raisins and used half white flour half wheat.  Next time I will try baking with a little honey on top!

I didn't want to go to the store so I subbed for buttermilk w/ 1TBS of Lemon in a cup of milk and used a cereal called Smart Bran which is organic and has psyllium and oatbran in it. I had homemade applesauce which worked great. Had I had all the ingredients I think I would still sub out for the vegetable oil, the texture was perfect. I didn't have raisins...too bad they would have been terrific in these! This recipe readily adapts to ingredients you have on hand.

These are the best bran muffins I have ever had. I consider myself to be an expert. The small changes I made are : about 2 tbsp. molasses, 1 and a half cups raisins. And when the muffins are done I brush the tops with melted honey. They stay very moist.

These are so good I've been making and eating an entire batch every day!  They're just as good with half as much oil, too. I just add more milk to replace the oil.

Super great recipe! One I will use often. I substituted applesauce for oil and two egg whites for the egg and used 1/2 cup brown sugar.

I made these with a few changes. I didn't want to use oil, so I subsituted the oil with pureed apricot. Also, used 1 tbsp lemon juice plus low fat milk to replace the cup of buttermilk. Left out the raisins. Muffins came out great. Tasted better the next morning than straight out the oven.

This is a great recipe.  The muffins are very moist.  They are a great source of fiber, and a nutritious way to start the day.  I  substitute 1 cup of whole wheat flour for the all purpose flour and add a scoop of ground flax seed to boost the nutritional content.They remain moist and delicious with this alteration.  The 5 year old twins ask me to make these for them. 
Thank you for a great recipe.

Best Bran Muffins! I made some changes, used coconut oil in place of veg oil, I used less brown sugar, whole wheat flour, added cinammon, applesauce, apples, bananas, and dried fruit.  So moist and very tasty. Thanks!

I made these muffins following others suggestions.  I used 1/3 cup of blueberry apples sauce to replace the oil, 2 egg whites to replace the egg, 1/2 cup of brown sugar instead of 2/3, doubled the vanilla to 1 tsp, used 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour and added flaxseed and cinnamon.  These turned out good.  A great breakfast for less than 200 calories.  Me and my daughter loved these, the husband and son, not so much.

I love these!  They're good as is, but you can also play around with them...I've add mashed bananas and also used applesauce instead of oil. They also come out soft and moist.

Absolutely perfect without changes! Even my husband commented on how delicious these are. I would add more raisins though because I like them, and maybe some flax next time.

These are beyond delicious! SO moist and fragrant! I use apple sauce instead of oil, and do half whole-wheat, half all-purpose flour to make them a bit healthier. Also, they are just as good with blueberries substituted for the raisins.

This is a great bran muffin recipe.  I cut the oil to 1/4c and the sugar to 1/2c. I separated the mix in 2 then used craisins, (since we don't like raisins). Then blueberries in the other half.  We like them both ways. I got 4 Large muffins of each type. I will double the batch next time for sure!  This is a great way to add fiber to your diet, even for those who don't love bran.

DEE-licious!!! These babies can convert even some of the most whole-grain hating family members into fiber fanatics!! Haha, excuse my insane nerdiness, please :) I didn't have any buttermilk so I just used regular milk, and to cut down on fat I reduced the oil to just 1TBS, and added 2/3c mashed banana because I just LOVE bananas. They were absolutely wonderful muffins - moist, fluffy, sweet... yum. And healthy, too? Who knew? Americans need for fiber in their diets... and this is a perfect way to get it. Highly recommend.

I gave it four stars for taste (really good, but not the greatest I have ever had)but I would give it 5 stars when I combine nutritional value and taste.  Considering all the substitutions, it is great:  1-1 substitution applesauce for oil, 1-1 substitution honey for brown sugar, weetabix combined with raisin bran (since I didn't have enough raisin bran), and I added a tablespoon of flax seed.  If I had them, I would have added a little wheat germ. I used all purpose four, but would have used whole wheat if I had it.  Muffins are very moist, and my daughter (3 years old) loves them.  I used chopped prunes instead of raisins to even further aid in digestion (she has a little problem...) to boost the fibre even more.  For a healthy breakfast or snack, I suggest giving these a try.

Yum!  I combined the recommendations of other reviewers (applesauce for oil, lemon juice with milk for the buttermilk, increased the vanilla to 1 tsp.) and was very pleased with the results.  I'll make these again!

Loved this recipe!! The only complaint I have is that the portions were too small for my muffin cups. I suggest that one corrects the servings to 14 or 16 so that you get a fuller muffin :)

I've made this twice now, scaled to 96 servings to use the whole half gallon of buttermilk.  I figure if the 6 week bran muffin recipe can do it, why can't this one?  I did notice the first time around, replacing with applesauce cause the whole mess to brown in the fridge, which looked unappetizing but didn't affect flavor.  The second time I used a mixture of wheat germ wheat bran, oat bran, oatmeal, and flax seed to equal to amount called for.  I used half whole wheat and half unbleached white flour.  I did add some mini chocolate chips to part of the batter for a treat with golden raisins and dates.  They were SO good topped with unsweetened large flaked coconut before baking.  The coconut toasts in the oven... yumm!  When I take it back out tomorrow to bake a second time, I'll need to either add a bit more baking powder (as the action of the baking soda w/ the buttermilk will have long passed) or I'll add a bit of baking soda, mix it in really well, and then add a splash of vinegar and mix it up really well.  This will add fluff to the recipe as when first made. Even if you don't do that, the batter keeps very well in the fridge.. I've kept it over a week without any problems in a large stainless pot.  Delicious recipe!

To make it dairy free, we substitute almond milk + 1 tbl lemon juice instead of milk.  Also, we added about 1/2 cup raisins and this receipe is perfect!

YUMMY!  Even with all the changes I had to make due to my Weight Watchers plan they were still awesome! Used 1 1/2 cups of raisin bran, 1 cup of skim milk w/ 1 tablespoon of lemon juice instead of buttermilk, 1/3 cup of applesauce instead of oil,  1/3 cup of splenda 1/3 cup of brown sugar and replace flour with whole wheat flour.  Which on the WW plan is equivalent to 2 points!!!  Fantastic!!!!!!!

I've made these probably a dozen times. Like many others, I've used regular milk + lemon juice in lieu of buttermilk. I've also subbed 1/3 cup of applesauce for the oil with no real issues (it does make the muffins more moist/sticky and they seem to spoil faster, though). I've never used raisins, only Craisins or chocolate chips - or both. This is a really great standard recipe for bran muffins.

This is a really good bran muffin recipe; however, I did change it to adjust for my taste in bran muffins.  I added 2 mashed, ripe bananas (rather small ones) and substituted real butter for the oil.  They came out moist and delicious.  I cooked them exactly 15 mins.  YUMMY!

I made this recipe almost exactly as written, and thought the sugar could be decreased to 1/2 cup or even 1/3 cup.  I used oil and loved the texture it gave.  I did add some coconut and rolled oats.

I loved these!  They were super yummy.  I added dried cranberries instead of raisins, apple sauce instead of oil, 2 egg whites instead of one egg, and a 1/2 tsp of cinnamon.  Great for breakfast!

Yum!  I really enjoyed these, they were actually better the third day.  I used half the amount of sugar, applesauce instead of oil, half whole wheat and half white, oatmeal/oat bran/Ezekial's version of grapenuts instead of wheat bran, and a mix of dried currants and blueberries instead of raisins.

Very good, and they make you feel good for being healthy. I took other reviewers' advice and replaced most the oil with unsweetened applesauce. I used just 2 tsp of oil and the rest applesauce.  I also used honey instead of sugar, and added a 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. I think next time I will add more cinnamon, some shredded carrots, and will try some whole wheat flour. I may even throw in some pineapple tidbits.

I now make these every week they are so good. Substituting applesauce for the oil, KAF's white whole wheat flour, Splenda brown sugar blend, and light buttermilk bumps the calories to just under 100 while the muffins taste exactly the same. Satisfies my sweet tooth and I don't feel guilty. This has got to be the best muffin recipe out there. 5 STARS!! Absolutly lovely.

AMAZING!!! All the bran muffin recipes I've tried until now have been dry and flavorless, but these were so moist and soft...mmm. I used whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose and substituted unsweetened applesauce for the oil. I also added 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon and used 1/4 cup raisins and 1/4 cup chopped dates instead of just raisins. I think next time I make these muffins I'll add berries or nuts instead of raisins, that would be delicious! Also in the future I will probably decrease the sugar to 1/2 or even 1/3 a cup. These muffins weren't extremely sweet, but I tend to be a fan of  more mildly sweet muffins. Wish I could give this more than 5 stars! Thanks for the recipe!

For once I didn't change a thing except to use frozen blueberries in place of raisins and add extra vanilla. Moist, full of flavor, and so yummy! I am so impressed. Next time I will try half honey half molasses. I think you can't go wrong with fruit/sweetener/liquid changes. The perfect base recipe,that is even perfect with NO changes. Thank you!

This recipe is amazing and easy to tweak to your tastes. I replaced all of the oil with applesauce and reduced the sugar by half. After putting the batter in the pans, I topped each muffin with a bit of cinnamon and sugar. They make for the perfect snack because they're healthy and filling! They are surprisingly moist, too.

I made these once before-(exact same recipe on the package of wheat bran) and they turned out good but dry-so i baked them this time with about a 1/4 cup of shredded sweetened coconut and i used melted crisco butter flavour shortening instead of oil.Also used more raisins because i like them. Turned out great. Taste divine fresh from the oven!
** tried these again- did a double batch and the only thing I did different was add some cinnamon, a tiny extra splash of oil and 1 small container of "fruitsations" carrot/apple applesauce. my toddler loved it...and it stays fresh for a few days if u can manage to keep them that long!! we ate 18 in less than 24 hours- me, my bf and son...and our 2 huskies. Great muffin recipe...very versatile...would recommend to anyone. planning to make them much more often!

I used applesauce instead of oil. They were moist but still kinda grainy. Maybe I should use less bran. I used fat-free buttermilk.

These are my idea of great bran muffins--not the overly sweet, cakey commercial kind, but light and pleasantly chewy. Perfect for breakfast. Like others, I substituted (unsweetened) apple sauce for oil. I also used skim milk with lemon juice because I had no buttermilk on hand.

This is a pretty darn good bran muffin. I added more raisons in, after having soaked them in boiling water for a few minutes and drained. They were particularly soft. :-)

They were good for Bran Muffins-- I feel like they would have been a little better with banana or some other flavoring. I added a tsp of cinnamon and a little shredded carrots as well just to liven it up a little. Overall, not bad and tasty with coffee.

So yummy! I added about a half cup of chopped dates and only a small sprinkling of raisins. Very delicious and semi-healthy. I also used whole-wheat flour and non-fat buttermilk.

This recipe is really very good AS IS, but I didn't have any buttermilk, so the only substitution I made  was using 1 cup skim milk with 1 tbsp of lemon in place of the buttermilk. I made them in mini muffin tins, shortened the cooking time, and they were so good! For my sweet tooth, I added some cream cheese icing on top! Next time, I'm going to add some dried cranberries and cinnamon to the batter.

I added cinnamon and chopped apple to this. Came out very moist and more dense when substituting a half cup of wheat germ for the bran.  This one's a keeper. Even my coworkers who don't like bran loved these.

MMMM mmm These are yummy!  Perfect for breakfast.  I made a few changes based on what I had available 1/4 cup of applesauce instead of oil (i like really moist muffins), 1% lactaid milk, and I used post raisin bran like the other view said but I left in the raisins. They came out moist and yummy, my 4yr old eats them!

Okay, I am the first to admit that I altered the recipe as suggested.  Too much oil and sugar yikes!  I used 1 cup nonfat milk with 1 tablespoon lemon juice instead of the buttermilk and 1/3 cup applesauce instead of the oil.  I also used 1/2 cup brown sugar and next time will use less.  I increased the dried fruit to 1 cup of yellow raisins and cherries and added a dash of cinnamon.  WOW these were super easy and I mathed out that each of the muffins altered as above = 128 calories mainly from the flour and fruit.  I WILL NEVER BUY MUFFINS AGAIN!  Took about 26 minutes total and the house smelled dreamy. A++++.

you guys inspired me!! Usually i make a recipe as is the first time (especially baking) but with all the changes the other reviewers made, i stole some and wound up with a fantastic muffin!!

I doubled the recipe, used a mixture of yougrt, fat free half and half and fat free sour cream (didn't have buttermilk), used pumpkin instead of oil, added 2 t. cinnamon and 1 t. pumpkin pie seasoning, used pam in my muffin tins, sprinkled sugar and cinnamon on the bottoms before pouring my batter in and more sugar and cinnamon on the top.

who knew a healthy bran muffin could be so delicious??

Great little recipe as is, and I too now make bran muffins every week.  But I have made some of the changes others have mentioned.  Replaced the vegetable oil with no sugar added applesauce and play with other dried fruits instead of the raisins.  I think substituting the oil for the applesauce not only makes a healthier muffin, but generally, just a better tasting muffin.  Try dried mango that you’ve diced up and reconstituted with rum. Wow…now that’s a bran muffin!

I used applesauce instead of oil, and I didn't have buttermilk so I added 1tbsp of vinegar to my fat free soy milk that I had on hand. I did half and half all purpose and whole wheat flour. Didn't add raisins, cause I don't like them. They turned out good!

My family loved these!  Great snack/dessert/ or breakfast.  I used applesause instead of oil.  Also, I would like to try carrots instead of rasins but don't know how to get them shaved so thin and fine like the ones I've had from bakery.  Any suggestions?

This recipe is awesome! I didn't have buttermilk on hand, so I used milk instead. I also added chopped pecans and baked it in mini loaf pans for 25 minutes. They turned out perfect, moist and with the perfect amount of sweetness. Great with raspberry jam!

I was surprised, but there was a great amount of taste and flavor with these muffins!  I added about 3/4 c. of raisins, and I'm glad I did.  I also  subbed applesauce for the oil.  Note to those with kids: my grandmother thought they had so much taste that she actually referred to them as cupcakes!  Will definitely be making again!  UPDATE: Today I subbed 2% milk + 2 T. apple cider vinegar for the buttermilk and  1/3 c. of honey + 1/3 c. brown sugar for the 2/3 c. of brown sugar and still was a hit with everyone!

Even people who said they didn't like "bran" muffins tried them and thoroughly loved them.  The texture is wonderful.  And they are really easy to make.  Nice healthy addition to my recipe box.

These muffins are great...I make them all the time. They are definitely better after sitting for a few hours or overnight. Not the best straight from the oven. Sometimes I use half whole wheat flour and half AP flour. I either leave out the raisins or substitute with chopped dates.

A little too sweet for my taste. But overall a great recipe. Next time I would reduce the sugar and use wheat flour instead of the white.

What can I say that hasn't already been said about these muffins?  Wow, they are fantastic; light and fluffy.  I made them exactly as written (minus raisins; didn't have any) and I would not change a thing!  But I might suggest doubling the recipe because I am on my fourth one right now and still going strong!  Thank you so much for this recipe!!

Unbelievable. I made this recipe and baked it in 6 large muffin tin last night for breakfast on the go this morning. Moist, delicious, and flavorful. My four year old wanted another one. I also have gestional diabetes and one large muffin didn't raise my sugar level too high. I will be making more and freezing them for a healthy-eat in the car on the way to day care- breakfast.

Pretty tasty for bran muffins! I made these with whole wheat flour and just added 1 more tbsp each of milk and oil, as well as 2 tbsp of honey, some flax seed, cinnamon and nutmeg. Didn't have any baking soda, so i used 3 tsp. baking powder and they turned out fine, just a little less puffy.

Thanks!

YUMMY!!! Here's what I did: I used non-fat coffee rich with 1 T lemon juice instead of buttermilk (I wanted them to be non-dairy), used 1/3 c applesauce instead of the oil, 1/2 c white flour & 1/2 c whole wheat and increased the vanilla to 1 tsp. I used craisins instead of raisins and I also added 1/3 apple chopped and 1 mashed banana. I used All Bran cereal for the bran. I also replaced some of the brown sugar with splenda and added a squirt of honey. The muffins are amazing. I got 18 smallish ones from the batch. I never realized "healthy" muffins could taste so good!! I can't wait to make these again. I think I will cut down on the sugar because the fruit added so much sweetness. I will also try some of the other variations reviewers have posted. This seems like a fun recipe to play around with.

This recipe was great. Easy to make and very moist. Like others I substiuted applesauce for the oil and added some ground ginger and nutmeg to my recipe. I also used a mixture of rasins and dates. My kids (age 8&12) loved them.

WOW these were delicious! I substituted the oil for 1/3 cup applesauce, and the buttermilk for 1 tbsp lemon juice + enough fat free milk to make a cup -I was nervous - but you couldn't tell AT ALL!! I also used Raisin Bran and just picked out the raisins as I was trying to get rid of an unwanted box. I baked for 16 minutes and they were perfect. They aren't too sweet, and with a little spray butter, one makes a really healthy  filling breakfast. The recipe made 12 really good sized muffins. I'll always make these to have some on hand. Thanks for the recipe!
FYI I did a recipe analysis, if you sub in egg whites, applesauce and ff milk + lemon juice they are 111 cals each

Great bran muffins!  Made these this afternoon and as I normally do and others have done, replaced the egg with 2 whites, replaced the oil with 1/2 cup unsw applesauce and did reduce the sugar to 1/2 cup.  I also split the flour, using half whie and half ww, yummy and healthy too!

This recipe was great! I substituted applesauce for the oil, and 2 tbsp honey + 1/4 cup white sugar (I didn't have brown sugar). I also used egg whites for the egg, and all whole wheat flour. I made 16 muffins, and they are each only 1 Weight Watchers point, for those counting. I will definitely make these again!

Wow, these were great.  I also substituted applesauce for the oil and vinegar and milk for the buttermilk; added pecans, nutmeg and cinnamon; and omitted the raisins.  My favorite bran muffin recipe has been the Oat Bran Muffins submitted by Bron, but these actually have a moister, lighter texture.  I made the batter the night before, refrigerated it, and baked in the morning.  Made 10 medium-to-large muffins.

These muffins are excellent, my family can't get enough of them!  I tried to make them as healthy as possible, so I used the suggested applesauce, egg whites, and brown sugar Splenda Blend.  I also upped the vanilla to 1 teaspoon, ommitted the raisins, and the best part of all...added 2 smashed bananas-Yummy!!! Thanks for the recipe and great suggestions.

I am rating this 4 stars because I made some substitutions and I think the original recipe would have been better. First I substituted the oil for the applesauce and used all whole wheat flour. I also replaced the egg with 2 egg whites and replaced the brown sugar with Splenda. The Splenda was a mistake. So next time I make these I will use the brown sugar and 1/2 c whole wheat flour and 1/2 c all-purpose.

Really good muffins. Nice and moist. I just substituted half the oil with applesauce. A keeper.

Fantastic! I threw in frozen blueberries and everybody loved them. They got a cold reception at work until I made somebody try one without telling them that they were bran muffins, then they were gone in a flash. They freeze well too!

I followed the recipe exactly except for using All-Bran cereal instead, in the same amount. These are so delicious. I bake them in a double muffin tin (meaning I use two 12-muffin-cup trays sitting one on top of the other). This allows me to brown the tops very well without burning the bottoms. This recipe will make 12 smaller-sized muffins, so I like to make 10 instead because I enjoy a muffin with a slightly overflowing top, bakery-style.

This is my first time making bran muffins and they were delicious!  Instead of raisins I added thinly sliced apples and that was wonderful although next time I think I will add closer to 1 cup of fruit instead of 1/2 cup.  I also used 1/3 cup whole wheat flour and 2/3 cup white flour and think I will keep using whole wheat.  Wonderful recipe!

These muffins were yummy. I didn't have any buttermilk so I just used whole milk and they came out just fine. They were very moist and had a great texture. I took the advice of another reviewer and added a little extra vanilla (1 tsp instead of half). I also used Canola oil.

Next time I am going to try it with nutmeg. I think it would be a nice addition.

Excellent! Switched the oil for applesauce which worked out excellent. I made two batches, the first without raisins and the second with raspberries which needed a bit longer to bake.

These were pretty good, and I like that they contain so much wheat bran to flour. They are, however, a bit on the dry and crumbly side though, and I followed the recipe exactly. I will try these again, but I'll throw in a couple bananas and see if that moistens them up at all.

I made a lot of substitutions (wholewheat flour, oat bran, milk instead of buttermilk, sunflower seeds instead of raisons) but I think the original recipe is a real keeper. These muffins are perfect for an extra-healthy breakfast!

I've made these muffins 4 times over the past couple weeks!  They are great.  I use milk and a little lemon juice instead of buttermilk and they still come out great. My only suggestion is to double the recipe cause you'll only get about a dozen with one batch.

I know bran muffins are supposed to be a bit "heavy," but I must have not soaked the bran long enough, as these were extremly cardboard like. Great flavor though.

I've been trying to think up some healthier breakfast ideas.  I like the bran muffins at Whole Foods and these are a great rival. I added cherry flavored craisins instead of plain raisins.  Yum!  Thanks for the recipe.

Even my kids love these.   Only needed 12-13 minutes in the oven.  Rounded my 2/3 cup brown sugar and I probably put more like 1 tsp. vanilla.  Added craisins instead of raisins because thats what I had on hand.  Perfect.  Might add some walnuts next time too.  This is a versatile recipe. Thanks.

These came out great! I made a few changes that others have listed... used whole wheat flour, 1/2 cup applesauce for oil (a snack pack size thing),cut down to 1/2 cup sugar, and omitted raisins. They were just lightly sweet and the texture was quite satisfying... thanks for a great recipe!

Very good! I used All Bran. (buds) You find this with all the other cereals. I left out the raisins & used the white whole wheat flour. To make sweeter & more moist, I subbed out the oil with 4 T. applesauce & 2 T. oil. It's true these don't rise well, but that's OK with me! Healthy, easy, & good!

I made these for my baby daughter who needs more fibre in her diet. She picked at them a bit but wouldnt eat them. I thought they were a bit too dry myself. If I make these again I will look through reviews for some added suggestions.

This was my first attempt at a bran muffin & I would've totally missed this because it called for white flour, which I try to abstain from, but I stumbled upon a review that said they'd replaced it with whole wheat flour. These were SO good! I added some Splenda & 1 tsp cinn-they were light, airy, moist & delicious. Thanks SO much for such a great, healthy recipe!!

This is an excellent base recipe--feel free to experiment with this one, it is very forgiving so long as you have an ingredient (like the raisins) to keep it moist. I did not have raisins. Instead I added 3/4 can pineapple chunks (minus liquid--reserve that for another recipe like Sweet & Sour sauce), zest of two lemons, handful of walnuts coarsely chopped and a pinch of cinnamon. Wow! Be mindful of the timer. I'd say check them at 8 minutes. Oh, I didn't have buttermilk, just regular milk. I thought the mixture was too liquidy at the end so I added a good-size handful of flour to thicken it right up. Again, very accomodating recipe.

These were ok, not as moist as some bran muffins I have had in the past. I didn't add the raisins - maybe that is why? I will try adding something to them next time for more flavor.

These muffins were so great! I used 1/3 cup Splenda and 1/3 cup brown sugar, and I substituted applesauce for the oil. I used dried cranberries instead of raisins, and added a few shakes of cinnamon. This recipe is absolutely wonderful; I'll be making these again soon.

I've been making this recipe for years and it's a family favorite.  As of late I've replaced the vegetable oil with coconut oil or almond oil and a Tablespoon of molasses.  I also subsitute frozen mixed berries for the raisins.  This variation is my family's favorite.

This was a fantastic recipe.  I did my own substitutions also.  I only used 2T oil and the rest applesauce.  Instead of raisins, I used 1 cup of frozen blueberries.  I used whole wheat spelt flour and used Splenda and sugar free syrup instead of sugar.  WOW.  These are low fat and high fibre and DELICIOUS.  Great recipe, very forgiving for substitutions.

I made these with soured soy milk (due to my dairy allergy) and no rasins and they turned out wonderfully. Nice and moist muffins. These are sure to become a staple at our house.

This recipe is super easy and very tasty. The first time I followed the recipe exactly and today I subsituted applesauce for the oil and used 2 egg whites and about 3 T. more buttermilk. They are excellent and nearly fat free!

These muffins came out totally perfect, not to mention they freeze like a dream ! Anyone who says they are dry are either not used to bran muffins or arent making them right because they are as moist as can be - I love raisins so my only change is I add a quarter cup more - thanks a bunch for the recipe - Kimmy

Excellent muffins made in a manageable quantity. I made them for friends who all did not believe that they were bran- too light, flavourfull and and airy to possibly be traditional bran muffins! I made them with golden raisins, and they really were lovely.

I used whole wheat flour, and skipped the raisins- very hearty with a good wheat flavor.  Very filling.

Followed the recipe as published.  Good flavor (not too sweet) but I've had moister bran muffins.  I will make them again but I still might search for one I like better (or a way to tweak this one).

This is a great recipe, very versatile. Like many others, I wanted to make it a bit more "healthy", so added 1/4 cup ground flax seed, cut down to 1/4 cup brown sugar and added a tablespoon molasses, used whole wheat flour, and cut the oil by one half and added that amount in applesauce. Raisins make it sweet enough for me! I've found that the muffins do not rise very high (maybe because the ingredients are heavier), but are still mounded. Will add some wheat germ in future too. A delicious, wholesome muffin!

I've cooked for 35 years and I found these muffins to be absolutely delicious.  I added a bit more brown sugar...left out the raisins...used unbleached flour rather than white, and for half of the oil, I subbed applesauce.  FABULOUS!

I never thought I'd say this about bran muffins, but these are delicious.  The only substitution I made was unsweetened applesauce instead of oil.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, Janet.

I was impressed with these.  My first attempt at making muffins and these actually turned out well.  I couldn't find wheat bran, so I used oat bran instead.  I also used powdered buttermilk (reconstituted of course) because I rarely have a use for it.  Had I bought fresh, I would have thrown out any that I didn't use in this recipe.

I make these all the time for my weekday morning breakfasts with the following substitutions: soy milk, whole wheat pastry flour, unsweetened applesauce, 3T flax seed & 1T water to replace the egg, 1/3c. brown sugar, and a couple of generous sprinkles of cinnamon. Makes 24 mini muffins.

Great recipe!  My toddler daughter loves these and they are a great souce of fiber to help keep her "regular".  I especially love the fact that the recipe requires ingredients that I usually have on hand.  Some other reviewers have suggested substitutions for the buttermilk (i.e. using regular milk with vinegar), but mine tasted much better when I used real buttermilk.

I must agree with the rest of the reviews....these muffins were delicious!  They are also very healthy, which is surprising for a muffin that tastes so good.  I used baking raisins to add moistness to the muffins, and they came out very tasty!  Will definitely make again!

MMMM SOOO GOOD...i would have never known it was healthy! I changed quite a few things but I think for the better...First I used soy milk, Oat bran instead of wheat bran (not sure if there is a difference), and added blueberries..oh and the best part..I used the streusel topping on on "to die for bluberry muffins" which consisted of Mixing together 1/2 cup sugar, 1/3 cup flour, 1/4 cup butter, and 1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon. Mix with fork, and sprinkle over muffins before baking. I was shocked at how good these turned out. mmmmm my favorite muffins ever. My boyfriend loved them! Thanks!

This really is an excellent recipe.  I used whole wheat flour and chopped up dried figs and it was fabulous.  The kids loved it!  When nutrition tastes good you know you have a winner. 
Update 1-27-05 I use this all the time.  I now double the recipe and put the batter into paper muffin liners in the pan and then freeze them.  On another day when I don't have time to make a hot breakfast I just pop them back into the muffin tin straight from the freezer and they take all of 5 minutes longer.  You can't tell the difference.  I also use freshly ground wheat flour and that comes out just as good as ever.

5*****!!!!!  This is a GREAT recipe!  Very easy to make, ingredients can be easily kept on hand (purchase bulk wheat bran at your local produce market - cheap!) and they taste great!  i omitted the raisins (eeew) and these muffins were still moist and flavourful.  thanks for sharing this one!!!  
 - PS - if you don't have buttermilk on hand (who does?) add 1 TBSP white vinegar per one cup of milk and let stand a couple minutes.  ta daaa!  buttermilk substitute.  that's what i do every time.

Great recipe! It was my first time making bran muffins by myself (after I moved out), and I loved them! They didn't taste too much like bran like some others I've had before - which is good. I used all whole wheat flour, vinegar with milk since I didn't have buttermilk, and I added 3/4 tps of cinnamon. Yummy!

This was wonderful!  I also used applesauce instead of oil, egg beaters instead of the egg and 1/2 wheat flour and 1/2 white flour.  I also used paper muffin liners (spraying the liners with Pam) and the muffins were moist and delicious.  I'll definitely make these again!!  Thanks.

These were exactly what I was looking for. They have a very nice texture and just the right hint of sweet. Who knew eating fiber could be so yummy!

These are really good, I used Lighter Bake instead of oil the first time and they are all right, but last time I used to oil and they were real good!

I've made these several times now using tips from other reviewers.  I replace the sugar with  1/2 cup honey and use 1/2 can of pure pumpkin in place of oil.  I've made them with blueberries, raisins and craisins so far.  It's an easy healthy breakfast and keeps me full until lunch.  Even my kids love them!

I didn't have butter milk so I used home made yogurt that I had in the fridge and some extra liquid whey from a previous batch of yogurt. Also, I did not have raisins. The muffins turned out great. And I will make them again. This is a wonderful bran muffin recipe. It is the best actually.

This is weird.   I wanted to enter my own recipe into my Plan to Eat app, and it is easier to import recipes from another site enter it from scratch.  So I googled a bran muffin recipe here and to my shock, this recipe is EXACTLY the recipe I have in my files - a recipe that I developed years ago!!  Mine even calls for pancake mix!   Who does that but  me?!   I couldn't believe it.  (I had to double-check the name of submitter.  Could I have submitted it and forgort!  Actually, no.)   So  I can vouch for this  recipe -  it is great.   I will suggest one thing; I use my homemade whole wheat pancake mix instead of commercial mix.  Anyway, thank you for posting it!

Moist and tasty! The only changes are that I used cran-raisins instead of raisins, and added walnuts.  I also mixed all of the wet ingredients together, and added them to the dry ingredients and I let the mixture sit for 30 minutes before baking.

These were very soupy and lacking flour. I was skeptical when I made them and checked the reviews for recipe error and alterations but I haven’t noticed any comments. I made them but added an additional half cup of flour and they turned out perfectly.

Only reason I gave it 4 stars was because I thought the amount of sugar was way too much.  1/3 to 1/2 cup is plenty.  With that change it is definetly a 5 star recipe.  I love this recipe and have made it several times also trying substituting the oil for applesauce, adding fresh blueberries and doing other variations.  It is always wonderful!!

I made several modifications based on what I could find and what I had on hand and they were still delicious. I used All-Bran Buds instead of bran (because my store didn't carry bran), applesauce instead of oil, wheat flour, and whey from yogurt I made in my Instant Pot instead of buttermilk. Thanks for posting this recipe. I have no doubt I try the original version, too!

I've been looking for my others bran muffin recipe for years and this is the closest I've made.  LOVE IT!!   I did change the oil to applesauce for WW points  savings but didn't notice a difference. Bringing  a few to her great grandson to keep her spirit alive...

I make these all the time and they are good.  This time I substituted milk/squirt of vinegar for buttermilk,  banana for egg,  zyletol for sugar and almond flour for white flour.  They were like little volcanoes in the oven and overflowed.   I guess a couple of the substitutes didnt work well together

I used applesauce instead of Vegetable oil and I added 1 tbsp of Molasses, for flavour. Sprinkled some sugar on top. I'm not a fan of bran muffins... This recipe converted me! Even my kids were skeptical, they loved them too. Next time I will make some with chocolate chips for the kids who don't like raisins.

I made these wonderful muffins for my husband and friends.  The only thing I changed the recipe is I used dried cranberries instead of the raisins.  The recipe made six large muffins.  These muffins were moist and delicious.  My husband does not like bran muffins but he ate two of these!  My friends raved about these muffins too.  I will definitely be making these again.

Good recipe! I like to use dark brown sugar, and I also added some orange rind to the mix. That’s what my mom always does and it gives it a nice flavor

I used yogurt instead of buttermilk.  I added cinnamon.  We added chia seeds and nuts and cranberries.  We reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup and could use even less.

Next time, we will use wheat flour instead of white.

I followed the recipe exactly except I added walnuts instead of raisins (because I can’t stand raisins in baked goods) and used almond milk + 1 tablespoon lemon juice in place of the buttermilk and it was so yummy! A hearty muffin with great flavor. Will definitely be making these again.

These are great muffins. I made a few changes, I used All Bran cereal, used the substitute for buttermilk of vinegar added to milk, never have buttermilk on hand because I don't use it often enough. I cut down the sugar to 1/2 cup, doubled the vanilla as others suggested. I used dried cranberries instead of raisins, didn't have raisins at the time, added pecans also. I have other muffin recipes that call for two eggs so I used 3 eggs in a double batch of muffin batter. I also used whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose. Used applesauce instead of the oil. As another person suggested I brushed the tops with honey after they cooled a bit. The results were very moist and flavorful muffins that I will make again and again. I enjoy having recipes that are easy to change around to arrive at different flavors. This recipe is a perfect one for that.

This recipe was great! The muffins were moist and delicious. I didn’t use raisins, but I added roasted unsalted sunflower seeds and dried cranberries to the tops before going in the oven. I also didn’t have wheat bran on hand so I used a generic bran cereal- and they still came out fantastic!

These turned out great!  Substituted All Bran cereal for the wheat bran, and craisins for the raisins.  Otherwise all the same.  Make sure you soak the cereal in the milk for a good 20 minutes before mixing in the rest.

Lovely basic recipe to build into best muffins ever! I had no buttermilk so substituted greek yogurt and sour cream. I then added dates and fresh squeezed pulpy orange juice and substituted wheat flour with gluten free 1-to-1 blend. I made sure to let the batter sit for about 30 minutes before spooning into a 12-muffin pan (so as to best absorb the dry and wet ingredients).  BEST. MUFFINS. EVER.

Moist, flavorful muffins. To make them virtually gluten free, I made the following changes.

1. Used 1 cup oats, processed in blender, and1/2 cup wheat bran flakes.
2. Reduced sugar.
3.  Used 1/4 cup walnut flour, 1/4 oat flour, 1/4 cocoanut flour, and 1/4 cup wheat flour instead of 1 cup wheat flour.
4. I added 1/4 cinnamon, as well!

Appreciate your recipe which is so much better than the one on the Whole Foods bran cereal box! My rendition included.....

I added 1tbles. molasses, 1/4 cup oats, 1/2tsp cinnamon,  1/2 cup jumbo raisins(Trader Joe's) + 1/2 cup chopped dates, and used whole wheat pastry flour, increased cereal to 2 cups. It made 8 jumbo muffins and cooking time increased to closer to 30 minutes.
Also, sprinkled some oats and brown sugar on top.

I never have buttermilk on hand so add the low fat milk to 1tbles. of white vinegar, let it sit for 10 minutes before adding it to the cereal.
Amazing, thanks again!

Great, simple recipe.  The only thing I changed was adding apple pie spice , extra cinnamon and diced up apples.  Was out of wheat bran so substituted with oat bran.

I LOVE this recipe!! I saw a large box of all natural Raisin Bran, so I tossed that in the food processor. I swapped out the buttermilk for unsweetened almond milk, unsweetened applesauce in place of the cooking oil, used an egg white, wheat flour and added shredded carrots and raisins. I had a large muffin pan, so they came out a bit on the small side. I will double the recipe going forward. These are so delicious!

I've made this over and over. Perfect for mornings when you are in a hurry. I always try to have some around. I'm going to try freezing this most recent batch because I made a quadruple recipe which is very easy to do. They are moist and full of flavour. I use dark raisins because I prefer the richer flavour.

I made these and they weren't quite good.  I didn't have any baking soda so I increased the baking powder.  They could have been a bit sweeter though.

I substituted whole milk for buttermilk, and one cup Cracklin Bran (that is oat bran) plus one cup All-Bran. Made the rest of the recipe as is.  Four year old grandson begged for more when I have him one for breakfast! I freeze the baked muffin and defrost as needed. Puffy, not flat, and good.

I just finished making these for the second time. They are so delicious and moist, even after a few days! I actually had to leave the lid on the Tupperware container off a bit so that they didn’t become too moist! I love this because I often find bran muffins to be dry. 
As for tweaking the recipe, I halved the amount of sugar, which is something I just automatically do with any North American recipe for any baked good. 
My first batch, I made a single batch, as per the recipe. Tonight, I doubled the recipe and they still turned out just as good. I baked them for 13 minutes in my oven using one dark and one light coloured muffin pan, and in paper cups in one pan and sprayed pan the other. They all turned out great. What a great recipe and it is one that I printed out and keep in my recipe box now. If you like moist, delicious bran muffins, definitely give this recipe a go, and if you like them on the less-sweet side, halve the sugar. SO happy to find this recipe!

Spectacular recipe. Soaking the bran in buttermilk is a terrific idea. I substitute most of the brown sugar with applesauce (it's easy to make your own with just one peeled apple) and they're very moist. Even people who don't like bran muffins like these.

I've made the recipe as is and it was great  , for the grownups. The kids needed the benefits , so I substituted 1/2 cup  cocoa for 1/2 cup of the flour and added 1/2 cup of chocolate chips instead of the dried fruit . They love them.

I loved them! I would have made the recipe exactly but discovered I didn’t have buttermilk and I’m allergic to raisins. I just used water instead of buttermilk and didn’t add raisins. They came out moist and delicious. I’m definitely going to make these again.

Will definitely make again. This is the bran muffin recipe that I have been searching for...basic classic everyday muffin. I used coconut oil in place of vegetable oil, personal preference.

Fantastic! These were lovely! I made them into mini muffins and boy did they go fast! Like others, I added cinnamon. I also added about a half cup of millet to give them a delightful crunch! I highly recommend them!

Great basic recipe. I added 1 1/2 cups of grated apples the first time. Today  I am adding 1 1/2 cups of grated zucchini they turned out perfect. Have fun with it (I omitted the raisins)

A basic muffin.  Substituted blueberries for the raisins and bran cereal for the bran but otherwise I followed the recipe.  The muffin had little flavour.  The batter was too runny and was hard to prevent overmixing.  Still, I managed to get a decent texture but would add more flour or less milk if I make it again.

Great way to add fiber to my diet. I only made a few changes due to ingredients on hand - didn't have real buttermilk so I made my own with whole milk and white vinegar,  and don't care for raisins so I added about 1/4 cup mashed berries (strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, kiwi). Yummmmmy!

Great recipe! I add zest of 1 orange, a tsp of cinnamon, a whole tsp vanilla and a cup of raisins. Freeze at least 1 batch during the spring  so i don't have to bake in summer. They freeze really well. Great regulator if you get my drift.

These are very tasty muffins. Instead of wheat bran I used Fibre 1 cereal because that’s what I had. Other than that change I made it exactly as written. This will be my go to recipe for raisin bran muffins:)

Have made this recipe twice now.  Nice taste, but way too dry.  I thought I may have made them wrong the first time so made them again adding a touch more oil but they are still feel like sawdust  while eating.
Since I have to make these each week I’ll try again adding some yogurt.  Maybe it’s my bran, I’ll buy a new box.

Absolutely delicious. The only change I made was that I used dried bluberries instead of raisins and used about 1 cup of the fruit instead of half a cup.

This exact recipe is on the back of Rogers Natural Bran as available in Ontario Canada ( perhaps other provinces).

Buttermilk makes all the difference taste wise but sometimes  I do the lemon in milk  substitution. I do know that buttermilk can be frozen. 

It's fun to play with this recipe. I often add a date in the middle of the muffin.

I and my family loved this muffin.  I changed it in one way, I added 2Tablespoons of  orange Metamucil. My mom has problems and is picky and it was a hit. I also added  1 cup of blueberries and 1/2 cup of raisins. I will make it again but add more Metamucil

I changed the vanilla to 1 teaspoon almond extract, added 1 teaspoon cinnamon, cut sugar to 1/3, added 3 tablespoons of honey, 1/4 cup walnuts & sprinkled sugar on top for that nice crunch. 
Everyone loves them.

I doubled the recipe and made 16 mini-loaves.  I didn’t make any alterations whatsoever—did not add raisins.  The muffins are surprisingly light and not too sweet.  I’ve made this twice now and will definitely be making them again soon!

I made the recipe exactly as written but instead of raisins I used a half cup of frozen wild blueberries and a half cup of frozen cranberries. Delicious !!! Tim Horton coffee shops used to sell these kind of muffins and then stopped but I think these are even better and not as many calories or fat. Everyone loved them !!!

I will make these again although I did make some changes only because I wanted to use ingredients I already had.  I didn't have regular milk so used almond milk (vanilla, sweetened) instead.  We both also love bananas so I added one over ripe banana plus about 1 tsp of banana flavoring and 1 tsp cinnamon.  Turned out great!  They are super moist and delicious.

I usually add 3-4 mashed bananas and cinnamon.  I find that it's better this way, more like banana bread.

This is one of the best bran muffin recipes I can remember trying. I didn’t have raisins so I used some of my prunes that I made from my homegrown plums that I dehydrated. Turned out wonderful.

These were moist and delicious.  Just what I was looking for.  I skipped the raisins and added a bit more vanilla, kept everything else as written.  I made them in mini muffin cups.  Next time I will make some additions suggested by others. Thanks for a great recipe.

It was a delicious moist recipe and we substituted fresh huckleberries for the raisins. Excellent basic recipe that can be modified for your palate pleasure.

These are amazing both right out of the oven and after a couple of days. I’ve made them a dozen times (or more). We never keep buttermilk in the house so, like others, I substitute 1 TB white vinegar and then enough milk to make 1 cup. Also always substitute applesauce for the oil - same measurements - which leads to a healthier and I think better-tasting muffin.

I made 12 as I preferred them slightly larger, so they baked for about 45 minutes. I used a mixture of cranberries and raisins as I'm not keen on raisins. They were delicious, moist on the inside, crisp on the top. Next time I'll take them out the pan and onto the cooling rack sooner so the outside and bottom can also crisp.

Really good basic recipe. I tweaked mine by adding currants, flax seed, and wheat germ. Subbed homemade applesauce for the oil and some whole wheat flour for the AP flour.

Replaced buttermilk w/whole milk and 1T vinegar mix. Used 1/4 C whole wheat flour and 3/4 C bread flour. Added 1T of cacao powder and used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. Also added 1T of ground flaxseed and 1C of semi-sweet mini chips. Now it's even healthier than before with a chocolate kick. Super awesome muffins! A 10 for sure!

I only made a small batch the first time I made the recipe so we could sample them. Delicious!  I'll be making more, some to eat and more to freeze. The only change I made was substituting applesauce for the oil. They taste better than the bran muffins from our grocery store's bakery and they're much healthier.

Terrific.  I've made it dozens of times now, so simple and delicious.  I've tried many variations, even using some mashed sweet potato.  About the best variant that I came up with is a bit of applesauce replacing some of the milk.  But I've reverted to the original recipe, I do use soy milk with a bit of vinegar in place of real buttermilk.

Made this now 6 times within the last few weeks it is so terrific. used it as a base recipe to make molasses bran muffins from - I adore the taste of molasses.. The changes besides adding 2/3cup of molasses are to add melted butter instead of oil and to use 200ml of sour cream plus  25ml of milk instead of buttermilk. These changes are just a preference of taste otherwise this is a fool-proof recipe..other than not using oil which I never do & use butter instead..melted.

I am giving a 3 rating just to be neutral since I wanted to review this recipe. If you like bran muffins, you will like this recipe and rate it a 4 or 5. If you don't like bran muffins or if you have never tried a bran muffin, you might be able to finish a bite of these without washing it down with something.  After tasting the batter I added a half cup of raisins and a streusel topping, it had about as much effect as sprinkling sugar over a piece of soggy cardboard. Our bran muffin lover thought they were great.

Better tasting and much healthier than supermarket "store baked". But not the best I've had. Definitely will make again and tinker with the recipe a bit more. For this batch I swapped applesauce for the oil and added 2 tablespoons of molasses.  Also sprinkled some oats on some. Everything else as the recipe states. Still a bit bland. May try to add some cinnamon and swap out the molasses for honey on the next batch.

Batter was very thick. It never "settled" in cup. Then they got brown on top but still gooey on bottom,  so I turned heat down and cooked longer.

Wonderful bran muffin recipe! I followed the recipe as stated. Since the recipe didn't say light or dark brown sugar I used dark. Distracted while making the muffins I left the batter on the counter for about 15 minutes. When I came back the batter had puffed up significantly. I used mini muffin tins and cooked them for 9-10 minutes checking on them frequently. They came out so moist and delicious! I love this recipe.

Very good bran muffin! I added one mashed banana instead of the raisins, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and used little less sugar because I put a streusel topping on these. I'll make these again!

Great recipe. These changes made it our favorite: used All Bran cereal; did not use oil; added a ripe mashed banana; used 1/3 cup brown sugar and 1/3 cup molasses; added 1 cup finely crushed walnuts.

I used all bran cereal for the bran in this recipe. The buttermilk really sets it apart and gives it a nice flavor.

To make them even healthier, I substituted an equal amount of whole wheat flour for the white flour. I increased the baking powder to 1 1/2 teaspoons. Stirring in about 1 tablespoon of wheat gluten can help also. Delicious!

Love this recipe. The muffins can be dry if you over cook them at all. Test with a tooth pick early and take out of the oven as soon as they're ready. I've made these with different fruit, like blueberries, instead of raisins or prunes. Dried cherries also work well. Very yummy.

I didn't have bran so I used Raisin Bran and added some walnuts.   They turned out wonderful.  This is a good basic recipe.  I will make again and again.

My former recipe called for a high fiber bran cereal - this one is much more economical, since I can get wheat bran in the bulk aisle.  These are moist and tasty, and it would be easy to exchange other dried fruits for the raisins.  I will reduce the brown sugar to 1/2 cup next time I make them,  but they are good as-made too!  I would also add that you really need to give the bran the 10 minutes of soaking time at the beginning, or else the batter is sloppy.

Great recipe.  

I used oat bran and ground flax seed instead of wheat bran.  
I reduced the sugar amount some.
I used pearsauce instead of oil (could use applesauce).
I added walnuts and chopped craisins (could use raisins or both).

Muffin texture was great.  Taste was great.  They kept well for a few days and tasted even better.

Great texture - light, fluffy - and flavour. Substituted 1 cup fresh cranberries for raisins. I used a large sized muffin tin (6 muffins) and baked in a toaster oven at 375 F for 30 minutes. Wouldn't change a thing.

YUMMY!  These muffins hardly needed another review, but I couldn't resist.  The best bran muffins I have ever eaten.  They are moist and sumptuous.  I substituted pecans for half of the raisins.

Really delicious. I followed other suggestions, replaced the oil with mashed banana, used half of the sugar and used half wholewheat and half white flour.  Thankfully I doubled the recipe from the get go. Plenty to freeze for the next week or two.

F-I-N-A-L-L-Y!!! I was looking for a bran muffin that tastes like the bakeries in NYC sell, but home baked, healthier and less sweet. This is it! The changes I made:I used oat bran - not  wheat , and added 1/3 cup more buttermilk as oat bran soaks in more liquid and is a bit drier. I let the bran and buttermilk soak for about 2 hours, Used 1/2 cup brown sugar increased raisins to 1 cup (cause I love raisins) and soaked them in hot water . Added 2-3 tbsp. Of the raisin water into the batter. 
If you want bigger muffins- fill it up to the top. Absolutely delicious!!! Next time I'll try it with other fruit ! Thank you so much!!!

These were truly wonderful. I couldn't find regular buttermilk so I used reduced fat. I also used an oil blend instead of vegetable oil. Just before putting the muffins in the oven I sprinkled some turbinado sugar on top for a glisten and crunch. They were fantastic. I used tulip cups instead of regular cupcake liners. It made 6 large muffins.

Pretty good base for a bran muffin you can make to your liking and easily subsitute ingredients. We used lemon juice with milk for buttermilk, cinnamon applesauce for oil, bran cereal for oat bran, half white/half wheat flour, and added chopped apples and cinnamon. The kids liked them, but I think I'll have to play around the added fruit- maybe even chocolate chips?
Good recipe overall!

Tried this recipe, while taking care of my 85 year old mother, who makes bran muffins EVERY week and is quite an expert on them! Final test: she loved them!! I did add a heaping tsp of cinnamon, 1/8 tsp of cloves and nutmeg, and 1 TBS chia seeds. My new favorite!

Yum Yum Yum.  I love bran muffins, but the fat content in store bought ones are terrible.  I saw this and decided to give it a try.  I made it exactly as is with only one exception....I used avocado oil instead of vegetable oil.  They were wonderful!  This will definitely be at the top of my "make every week" list.

I made the muffins following the  recipe, but they came out a little dry.  Twenty minutes was too long to cook them in my oven.  Even though they were a little dry they still were very good.  The next time I made them I added 1/2 cup walnuts and cooked them for 15 minutes.  They came out moist and tasted great. This is something I will be making often.  This is a keeper recipe.

I found the recipe delicious, but I did accidentally add an extra 1/3 cup of sugar, and used oat bran instead of wheat so that might have helped!  I like DANSTENSEN's idea of substituting pumpkin for oil, I might try that next time.  It is a healthy, not cloying sweet recipe that I will make again--next time without the extra sugar!

I made these using apple sauce instead of the oil, and I ran out of bran flakes so I used about a half cup of uncooked steel cut oats to make it up the full amount between the two. Turned out deliciously! I'll probably use the oats again next time!

I have never written a review before but these muffins were absolutely the best Raisin Bran muffins I have ever had that I wanted to write about them. I followed the recipe exactly and they were amazing!  I don't think I would change anything about it.  I may however try making them with blueberries instead of raisins because I like that combination too.  I got 10 regular sized muffins out of the batter.

This is a great recipe on its own, but I substitute chunky applesauce in place of oil.  I cook with unbleached flour. I substituted honey for the sugar, or just cut it in half. I make this recipe so frequently; Thank you Janet, my family truly enjoys this versatile recipe.

Love these muffins. I always double the batch as you only get about twelve per batch. I use mashed ripe banana in place  of the oil and they are moist and perfect. Also, the last time I made them I was out of eggs (realized this a little too late in the process) and used a ripe banana in place of each egg, and they still turned out perfectly (with a mild banana flavour that my kids and I loved).

I made a double batch of these exactly as posted.  I am not much of a muffin fan (glorified cake) but these turned out great.  I keep them in the freezer so they are always handy for a quick bite.

I replaced the buttermilk with pinapple juice, oil with applesauce, and brown sugar with white and molasses (only because I was out of brown sugar). I also used white whole wheat flour and used a little extra pinapple juice because we live in the desert. These were delicious and just what I was going for: sweet, a little nutty, a little crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. Thanks for the recipe!

When I first made these muffins my family was against them because  they wanted me to make cake muffins. I told them to try it first and if you don't like them I will not make them again.  Well let me tell you this when my daughter bite into the muffin everyone was watch and she said this is good now I make them every week. If I don't they will go on strike :)

These however, were simple to make and were very moist, didn't need to baptize in butter to make them easy to swallow.  I made a second batch in a jumbo muffin tin and they turned out a little dryer due leaving them in the oven a little longer because of size difference. I will not be doing that again. I would note though that even 2 days later you could butter them and eleven seconds in the nukerator and they were still awesome. My wife would recommend a steady supply of these in the future. I gave a four star due to the fact that I am not a bran muffin fan of sorts, but if you are then I am certain that you will rate them a five.

I love this basic muffin recipe, from here you can alter to meet your tastebuds. The recipe is great as is but if you need to have a breakfast muffin that can also be healthy then start here and take in the suggestions of the various reviewers as I do. No oil, I use applesauce, half the brown sugar and a few (4) packets of Stevia, half white flour and half whole wheat plus I add some freshly ground flax seed. When I made these, I did not use paper liners I just used a light spray of  olive oil Pam. I now need to do another batch as these are pretty much gone!!

Surprisingly good!  I'd never made bran muffins before and wasn't sure what to expect. Substituted homemade apple sauce for the oil and added maybe 1/2 tsp of cinnamon.  Also added 2 tablespoons of flax meal. Looking forward to trying it with sweet potatoes and bananas.

So good!  They remind me of the muffins I used to buy 40 years ago.  So glad I found this recipe.  I not only put dates but dried cranberries as well.  This will be one of my "usual recipes".  Thanks for posting.

I make these for a quick breakfast and boy do they do the job.  They are so filling.  I use applesauce rather than oil.  The last time I made them I put walnuts in them and wow was that good.  Now, my kids do NOT like them.  They think they are bland.  I think they are fabulous.

I've made this recipe twice. The first time I made regular sized muffins and I found they where slightly dry so the second time I made mini muffins and also added 1/2 a cup of apple sauce. Delicious! Will most definitely make these again!!! :)

Smelled heavenly right out of the oven and they were screaming for butter and jam! So hearty, sweet, and delicious. I substituted unsweetened applesauce for the oil, and white whole wheat flour (from Trader Joe's) for the all-purpose flour. Thank you for the healthy recipe!

My 'Tweak' ! I toasted the wheat bran in a 350 oven for 8 minutes and let it cool for 5, I grated a soft peeled Apple, I substituted yogurt for the buttermilk and oil (equal measurements) added a TBL of Cinnamon, one teaspoon of nutmeg and half tsp clove. I didn't stop there either, I added half cup of shredded coconut. My husband stopped me mid step to the batter with a handful of chocolate chips with his 'Don't gild the lily m'love!' ?? Dee-lish!

These are delicious!  I don't know why other people were complaining - they must have done something wrong.  I thought they were delicious - in our house, they were gone in one day!  They are satisfying and just the right balance of healthiness and deliciousness.

These are really good! I subbed cashew milk for buttermilk. I drizzled honey on the tops and doubled the raisins too.

Excellent recipe.  Only change I made was substituted 1 1/2 c chopped dates that I soaked in water for 10 minutes, then drained, for the 1/2 cup raisins.  Yummy

First time today, and totally forgot to add the oil. Upped the raisins to 3/4 cup because we like lots. Batter looked a bit dry so added 2 tbsp. buttermilk extra at the end. They turned out great and moist even without the oil. Will try them with butter next time because I like the flavor the butter adds to it better than oil. Good recipe!

I made these simply to use up some all bran i had taking up space in my pantry. I substituted chocolate chips for my non-raisin eaters and the muffins were delicious. I will definitely make again with raisins and/or craisins.

We made it per the recipe and it was great! Then we tried shredded apple and added a teaspoon of cinnamon instead of the raisins. We liked that too! Might add a bit of applesauce to the shredded Apple next time, or

What a great recipe.  And oh how adaptable and tolerant to changes.  After looking at all the many ways people had varied the recipe, I decided to play, which is my favorite thing to do in the kitchen anyhow - switching to whole wheat flour and adding in some extra buttermilk to compensate, swapping in molasses for part of the brown sugar, trying applesauce for oil, putting in dried cherries for raisins.  I have great super healthy muffins as a result, and like others, I will continue playing.   My one note, next time I will reduce the sweetness by eliminating more of the brown sugar.  Thank you for an outstanding base recipe - really good as they are, but fun to play with.  Seldom are recipes quite this tolerant of change!

I thought these were very good. I also added 2 tblsp of ground flaxseed, increased the vanilla to 1 tsp and did not add raisins. I use the powdered buttermilk that you add water to compensate, and it always works well. I got six jumbo muffins out of this, and they were ready at 13 min. Will make again; other things like craisins could be added to these, too.

These are delicious, and easy to tweak.  I subbed almond milk, coconut oil, and coconut palm sugar.  I also made them with 50% whole wheat flour.  Didn't have any raisins, so used the Craisins I had left and topped off the 1/2 cup with unsweetened shredded coconut.  Since I was being so "healthy" I went ahead and smeared some butter on one fresh from the oven.  Delish!

Great bran muffin.  First, I made it just as written, since then, I have made it several times adding cinnamon and clove or other spices.  I always replace the oil with baby pureed prunes or unsweetened applesauce.  They are great in the morning with coffee, and as a healthy snack at night.  The last batch I made, I used oat bran, added 1/2 cup chopped walnuts saving a few to sprinkle on top of each muffin before baking.  They were still moist and delicious.   This is such a versatile recipe!  Thanks for sharing.

Husband adores these. I have to make 1.5 recipes/week to keep him supplied. They are moist, keep well, very flavorful, and very filling!  I liek mine sliced in 2 and warmed in microwave with a wedge of Laughing Cow Light spread over the halves. 

Changes I made: 
Use craisins for raisins
Added extra egg to replace the oil.
use 1/2 vanilla and 1/2 Almond extract.

These had a great signature "bran" taste, but mine ended up a bit dry even though I baked for 15 mins. Next time I'll up the buttermilk slightly and check for doneness earlier than suggested. I love a good bran muffin, though, and this is an excellent base.

Not as great as I thought they would be.  I think part of the reason is that this recipe doesnt have molasses, which goes great with bran.

I usually never rate a recipe but I just had to do it for this one...wow it was amazing and taste wonderful.  I just substituted the buttermilk for 1 percent milk and 1 tsp vinegar.  All purpose flour for wheat flour and added some flax seed.

This is definitely a keeper recipe.  Thank you so much !

Fabulous recipe. The first time I made these I followed the directions (almost) exactly. The only substitution I made was using 1 tbsp. lemon juice with enough milk added to equal 1 cup instead of the 1 cup buttermilk, since I didn't have buttermilk in the house. I also lightly brushed the tops with honey as soon as they came out of the oven. They turned out perfectly, and my usually bran-averse husband ate nearly the whole dozen!

For the second batch I decided to make banana nut muffins, so I switched out the raisins for 1/4 cup chopped walnuts and added 1 chopped banana. I used a jumbo muffin tins (the half-dozen sized; I just divided the batter evenly between them), so I lowered the oven temperature to 350 degrees and baked for five minutes longer. I sprinkled a light dusting of cinnamon with the honey brushed on top. They turned out wonderful! This recipe is a keeper.

Love this!! So good even my 12 yo daughter will make them when we run out! I have cut the brown sugar back to 1/2 cup, and once I was out of vanilla so I had to leave it out, and no one could tell the difference.

These are yummmmy! Made these for my boyfriend and I, and they were amazing! I substituted the oil with unsweetened applesauce, and cut the sugar in half like one of the users suggested.  It didn't affect the taste at all and they were still really sweet. I also added chopped dates to the batter. I will be making these again.

I have made these four or five times since finding this recipe, and they are GREAT! I always just use whole wheat flour and leave out the raisins, and use almond milk in place of buttermilk, and usually cut the sugar a bit. But I have used oil and applesauce, and done plain and have added things like chocolate chips, nuts, or flax seeds, and they are delicious every time!

The batter also doubles really well, and I have done that a couple of times, to keep on hand to bake just a few fresh muffins throughout the week :)

for this recipe i changed a lot of the ingredients (next time ill go exactly by the recipe!!).  for example, since i had no buttermilk i substituted milk with greek yogurt and i also substituted ground flax seed for wheat bran. all in all, it wasnt too bad except for the practically non-existent sweetness. drizzle with honey or sprinkle with cinnamon.

This recipe is perfect.  Please do not substitute with skim milk or applesauce as you will not get the same results.  There's no need to substitute as this is not a high calorie food.  However, it is an excellent source of fibre.

Made these for the first time today and they are delicious! To half the batch I added one banana, the other half per the recipe. Both were excellent. Next time, I am going to add 1 T. more buttermilk if I'm not putting any fruit in it as I like my muffins a tad on the moist side. But this is truly a great recipe and one I'm going to enjoy playing around with for various flavor options!

I must say, I have made these muffins many times and never wrote a review.  Well, here is my review.  I love this recipe.  And, once you make it first time, you want to change to blueberries, or golden raisens, or nuts or whatever, you can do it.  This is very versatile recipe.  I always use golden raisins in this.  I am going to make them again today, but, I don't have any buttermilk.  I did order powered buttermilk from King Arthur Flour, which had a great review, so, I am going to experiment today and use it.  Too many times I waste buttermilk since some recipes I make ask for 1 cup.  Then the rest of buttermilk is wasted.

Oh wow  I made this with the powdered buttermilk from King Arthur.  Wonderful!  Now, I don't waste buttermilk.  I love, love this recipe, now with my handy powdered buttermilk!

I used dates instead of raisins and brushed the honey on top after they came out of the oven. I know these are bran muffins, but they were really branny!! I was looking for something that tasted better. It would have been nicer if they were sweeter with a smoother texture. They are healthy, but they taste healthy, too.

Best go to recipe for muffins. I like to use a little less brown sugar  and a little less oil, I  add some apple sauce(unsweetened}. I do add more raisins like a cup. Even added some wheat germ last batch. They always come out perfect!

Warning! If you do not love to bake, do not share these muffins with any non-bakers. You will be hounded to bake these non-stop.  They are so delicious and since they are relatively healthy people feel like they should have them on hand at all times.  They are great baked into mini-muffins and stored in the freezer.  Set a couple on the counter and they will defrost in a few minutes.  I add a cup of pecans and use whole wheat flour.  I'm so tired of making these but they really are that good and you don't have to feel guilty feeding them to the kids for breakfast.

You can make them healthier but substituting brown rice flour for the all purpose, coconut oil for the vegetable oil, maple syrup for the sugar and adding cinnamon ( a wonderful spice for health) and ginger. Buttermilk is a healthy ingredient so I left that in.

This is a great recipe, partly because it's tasty and partly because it's so easy. It's a really good base for all sorts of add-ins. I added 1/4 cup chopped walnuts and 1/3 cup chopped dried apricots and the muffins were wonderful.

Delicious! The recipe made 6 large muffins and really needed more than 20 mins to bake. Next time I'd go 5-10 longer. 

As so many have suggested, I used apple sauce in place of the oil. I used 1/2 whole wheat flour and added 1Tbsp of ground flax. Used 1/4 cup molasses and 1/4 cup white sugar. Finally, I added 1/2 cup of frozen blueberries instead of the raisins. 

I will be making this recipe again and again!

This was the first time I've made bran muffins myself. Very good recipe, tasted exactly like I'd hoped. I followed the recipe exactly as written, but added some spices (clove, cinnamon, ginger). These will be great with breakfast all week!

Great, classic flavor. I added cinnamon and replaced 1/2 of the white flour with coconut, almond & spelt flour. Next time I'll try the suggestion of using applesauce.

I used dried, sweetened cranberries instead of raisins and also added roasted and salted pumpkin seeds (from Trader Joes). I used about 2 TBSP in the batter, and then sprinkled the tops with pumpkin seeds and chunky sugar crystals about halfway through baking. Just wonderful! Thank you for this recipe. Already planning to make again this weekend.

This is an excellent bran muffin recipe!  I used plain yogurt instead of buttermilk and the muffins were moist and delicious. Definitely will make them again! My family enjoys them for a midday snack.

This is by far, the best bran muffin recipe ever.  I usually double the recipe and either share with friends or freeze them to enjoy  each morning.  My favourite additions are walnuts and cranberries.  So good!  The only downside is that they are not gluten free for those that have to watch.

These turned out just wonderful. I too substituted apple sauce for the oil and used 1/4c brown sugar and 1/4c honey. I also added finely diced apple and 1/2T cinnamon. They were incredibly moist and delicious. It was hard to stop eating at one!

Love this recipe!  Recently started baking breads with whole grains, so was thrilled to get a good muffin recipe with whole bran. Used the Splenda brown sugar (1/3 cup) (family member cutting out sugar), 1/2 c. bread flour and 1/2 c. whole wheat flour.  All loved them!  Eager to try again.  Will subst. applesauce for the oil next time.

Just pulled these out of the oven and WOW, I'm impressed.  These are really, really good!  I'm pretty new to this cooking healthy thing, so the recommended adjustments were welcomed.  I used unsweetened applesauce and a few TBSP coconut oil in place of the vegetable oil, 1/3 c stevia for baking (made brown with molasses), whole wheat flour, a healthy tsp or two cinnamon, and a handful of dried cranberries along with the raisins.  Using the stevia is unnoticeable, which I appreciate, and the cinnamon really shines through in flavor!  I was worried about them being dry so I baked them for a short 13 min and then an additional 3 min.  Perfect...no need for a pat of butter!  Warm them up and go!  **update** after several times of making these my husband requests them and even my 3 and 5 yr old enjoy them!  We've thrown in raisins, dates, and walnuts, bananas, and even blueberries!

Delicious and good for you. I used olive oil and substituted fage 0% yogurt for the buttermilk, molasses for the sugar and stone ground wheat flour for the all purpose. I added 1 mashed banana and some dates instead of raisins. Made 12 muffins and cooked for 20 minutes and they were perfect. Husband loves them too. Will definately be making on a weekly basis.

This is my "go-to" bran muffin recipe.  The only thing I do differently is while the oven is preheating & the bran is soaking, I soak the raisins in boiling water and a splash of vanilla.  I let the soak until it's time to incorporate them, then I drain them really well & add them. Makes the raisins nice and plump and juicy!

Just baked it as a cake in a round pan.  It took a little over 30 minutes to bake at 375 degrees F with a doubled recipe in a very flat round pan.  Also, I substituted homemade Greek yogurt in place of buttermilk and used dried cranberries in place of raisins; white sugar in place of brown sugar and white whole wheat in place of all-purpose flour. My household diligently counts carbs, so weights according to the recipe changes just mentioned are as follows: serving size=76.625g of pre-baked batter/carbs per serving=47.27g.

I'm giving this recipe 4 stars only because of the amount of sugar it calls for. When I followed the recipe originally the muffins were too sweet and dry for my liking. I made the muffins with half the called for amount and modified the flour amount by making it 3/4cup flour and 1/4 cup almond flour and enjoyed the outcome much more.

We really liked these. I substituted Brown sugar Splenda for the Brown sugar and I used All Bran cereal instead of the bran. But I did this to cut sugar and cereal was what I had on hand. I will try with applesauce and egg substitute next batch. I will be making these often. I know the original had I followed would have been great.  Jgled

So DELICIOUS!!! I copied the recipe to "T" the first time and they came out perfect! Second time around I substituted oats for the all purpose flour and added walnuts and chocolate chips, third time I used almond butter instead of vegetable oil and added flax and pumpkin seeds. Next tie I'm going to try fat free yogurt instead of the buttermilk to make them as low fat as possible! Adding this one to my Go-To-Recipes for Bran Muffins!

I have been making this a couple times a week since the holidays.  I also vary the sugar; add molasses.  Sometimes cinnamon.  Bananas.  Grated veg such as carrots.  The possibilities are endless with this.  Oh, half unsalted butter/half olive oil if I zest in orange rind.
If you arent sure, just enjoy it as presented.  If & when you want.  Experiment!  With raisins I simmer for a bit in a little water to soften for kids.  Drain & count the liquid towards the milk.

Thanks for this handy recipe Janet.

Substituted applesauce for oil, Allbran cereal for oat bran, and whole wheat flour for white flour. Sprayed muffin tins instead of using papers. Held raisins for kids. Turned out moist and tasty. Great with yogurt fruit parfaits.

I like this recipe as is (except no raisins because my 3-year old doesn't like them).  I usually make 3-4 dozen muffins and then put them into freezer bags and freeze them.  Even after a month or two they taste every bit as yummy once they are thawed.  We put honey on them, but they have a nice sweetness to them without it.

Hearty, but not heavy.  Could use more spices for flavor or more raisins.  Substitutions to lower sugar and calories:  unsweetened applesauce instead of oil, 1/3 c brown sugar splenda, and whole wheat flour.  Calories 117, fat 1.1g, sodium 255mg, carbs 24.9g, sugars 11.6g, protein 3.1g.

Just made these tonight with ingredients I had in the house.  Substituted 50% of the oil for apple sauce and made the buttermilk with 1% and lemon juice.  Chopped up 4 dates I had in the freezer instead of raisins.  Great mini muffins at 70 calories per muffin (per myfitnesspal app recipe creator) for 24 muffins.  Though they were big, I should have made 36 minier muffins!

Good simple bran muffin recipe. My batter did not look as wet as in the video. I had followed ingredients and instructions exactly, so I baked it anyway. It turned out great.

I make this recipe a lot.  I recommend replacing the vegetable oil and buttermilk with one can of coconut milk.  It makes the muffins really moist and does not taste like coconut.  The muffins do need a bit more flavor.  I will try some cinnamon next time and possibly a little more sugar.

Although they were moist and sweet, they lacked a certain something; maybe some fresh fruit might have perked them up, give them that umph. I used dates for my first batch as well as substituted applesauce for the oil. I'd like to try these again but plan on adding something fresh to it, maybe some grated carrots, apple, or fresh berries...

Very moist and yummy! I subbed applesauce for the oil, and fat free vanilla yogurt for the buttermilk. Threw in 1/2 cup dried cranberries and some walnuts too.

These were awesome. I did substitute the oil for applesauce,  sugar for honey, and used half white flour and half whole wheat. I also added some chia seeds. Great, easy, muffin recipe. I will be making these again!

This is a great basic recipe. For some flavor I added 1tsp of cinnamon, 1/2 C walnuts, and 1/2 C dried orange flavored cranberries (purchased from Trader Joe's). I chose to omit the raisins and add an additional 1/8 C of buttermilk to keep the muffins moist. Very tasty!

These were good! I followed the recipe except I substituted applesauce for the oil as other reviewers have suggested, made my buttermilk using 2% milk and vinegar, and I added in a heaping 1/2 cup of raisins AND dates! My only complaint is that they need some kind of spice! Next time I'm going to try adding some cinnamon and maybe pumpkin pie spice to the recipe. I would like to try another reviewer's suggestion of substituting the 2/3 cup brown sugar with 1/3 cup of brown sugar and 1/3 cup of molassas to give it a richer taste and make the muffins moister.

I really enjoyed these muffins. I substituted Flax Plus for bran. I also used dried blueberries and 1/2 cup of chopped mixed nuts. I added 1 tsp of Penzeys Apple Pie spice. They were very moist and tasted like a muffin you would get at a high quality B&B. I will be making these again.

These are the nicest bran muffins I've ever made. I like using fresh or frozen fruit instead of raisins, so I dredged 1 cup of frozen cranberries with a couple of teaspoons of flour and added that at the end. The texture was still perfect, not too wet as sometimes happens. Making these often.

They are what they say they are!
I make them with no raisins and they are good. The only way they could be better is if they were fluffier but I ALWAYS think that about muffins.

Very good recipe as is! We also tried omitting raisins and adding flax seed, apple pie spice and cinnamon - and buttering the tops as they came out of oven. Didn't have straight buttermilk so made my own with 2T lemon juice in the cup  of milk. very substantial muffin but also light and soft! Will definitely make again! (I have four children under 10 and they love it too!)

Thank you for sharing this recipe, Janet. I've made it several times in last couple of weeks with a few variations, reducing sugar to 1/4 cup, 1 tbpn cinnamon (we like spice!) and grated apples. Just delicious! Thank you

This made 12 very big muffins! I didn't have buttermilk, so I used a carton of Chobani strawberry yogurt, then poured milk into the measuring cup over the yogurt to make 1 cup, and added 2 teaspoons of lemon juice. I let this sit for 10 minutes. My gang likes muffins sweet, so I added an extra 1/4 white sugar. Then, I presoaked the raisins in hot water so they would be plump. I also sprinkled sugar on top. The muffins were sticky when done, but the muffin liners helped keep things neat when I popped them out of the muffin tins. These are heavy muffins -- not light like cake -- but delicious!

love these! I made the recipe as is first time and they were good, the second time I used others suggestions and swapped the oil for applesauce, egg for whites, sugar for splenda, added cinnamon,and used half wheat flour...they were amazing actually way better flavor and moisture than the first try. I like them with craisins and walnuts best but are good w raisins as well

ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL! DIDNT HAVE BUTTERMILK SO I USED PLAIN GREEK YOGURT INSTEAD! OMG! NEVER USING THE BUTTERMILK. ALL WERE GONE IN AN HOUR! MY 5 YEAR OLDS LOVE THEM! 2ND DAY THEY WANTED MORE SO WITH NO MORE GREEK YOGURT I USED STRAWBERRY ACTIVIA AND SOUR CREAM TO MAKE 1 CUP AND OLIVE OIL AS I WAS OUT OF VEGETABLE OIL! STILL TASTED AMAZING! THIS RECIPE IS A GREAT FOUNDATION RECIPE FOR GETTING CREATIVE WITH INGREDIENTS GOING TO USE MY HOMEMADE PUMPKIN PUREE NEXT TIME. I WOULD HAVE TO SAY IT KINDA TASTES LIKE A REALLY GOOD OATMEAL RAISIN COOKIE TURNED INTO A MUFFIN!

We liked these.  Light, fluffy, and just plain good.  Used bran flakes and subbed apple sauce for the oil.

Absolutely delicious! This recipe has become my new weekday morning staple. I omit the egg and instead use 1 Tbsp milled flax seed mixed into 3 tbsp water, and I use 1 tbsp lemon in 1 cup of skim milk. I also substitute the raisins for 1 peeled, diced apple with 1 tsp cinnamon added to the dried ingredients. I'm planning on trying them instead with dried cranberries and some orange zest next time. The recipe is so easy to adjust to your taste. I share them with all my friends every day because they are so healthy and delicious! You can't even tell they don't have butter or egg in them! Thank you so much for sharing such a versatile recipe.

Excellent and Easy!  I've been searching for a tasty Bran Muffin recipe and I've finally found it and it's super easy to make.  It is also flexible - you can substitute and add ingredients, I.e. applesauce, nuts, cranraisins, egg whites vs yolks, dash of cinnamon, etc. Fun to experiment!

This is the best bran muffin recipe ever!  No changes needed. I make and freeze them.  They freeze beautifully.  Just warm in the microwave.  Excellent!

These are very light and sweet.  The buttermilk makes them very tender.  Personally I prefer a heartier muffin for breakfast, but I can't stop snagging these for snacks as I walk through the kitchen.

Great Recipe--Thank you for sharing.  Followed the directions except for adding 1 tsp. Apple Pie Spice.  I used oil as per recipe and found them to be very moist.  I topped them with pecans, brown sugar, and some oats before baking....yum...came out superb.  I also added some cinnamon chips to the batter for flavor.  I used Raisin Bran Crunch cereal as that is what I had on hand. I used foil muffin cups and sprayed them lightly to prevent sticking...they popped right out of the foil cups! This recipe is a keeper!

These muffins make a great "healthier" snack alternative.  I made some of the subs recommended by others (milk & lemon juice for buttermilk, wheat flour, added some bananas, molasses sub for brown sugar, etc.).  All good.  Some a little better than others.  I did actually add a little more milk than it calls for.  I also always add 2-3 scoops of protein powder and still turned out great.  I put a little bit of honey on top.  My kids love them.

10 star....PERFECT recipe. Sub 1/3c applesause for the oil. Sub wheat flour for white. Made 10 lg muffins. Didn't like blueberries...did like raisins - don't use too many. Double up the muffin tins so bottoms dont burn. EXCELLENT. (going to try substituting Splenda next)

Good recipe. I did make a few changes but it's the original, basic recipe that still sets the standard. In case it's helpful to someone, I tweaked things based on what I had in my pantry. Replaced the regular flour with light buckwheat flour, reduced the amount of sugar to half and used xylitol instead, plus some molasses. Extra raisins. Oh, and yogurt instead of buttermilk. A bit of cinnamon and real vanilla bean powder. Yeah, lots of tweaking but it came out great.

These are wonderful! Although I did make substitutions as others suggested.  I used unsweetened applesauce instead of oil, 1 tbsp. lemon juice and enough skim milk to make a cup instead of buttermilk, bran cereal (I couldn't find anything else to use) and 1/2 C. all purpose flour and 1/2 C. whole wheat flour instead of 1 C. all purpose flour.  I also added 1 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and 1 C. small, red delicious apple chunks!  They are absolutely delicious; family loved them!  I will be making these again soon.

absolutely delicious! i'm going to make them once a week.  they're so moist and light.  i used dates instead of raisins and added some walnuts, too.  the dates are gooey and subtly sweet, the walnuts add a little crunch.  i also subbed applesauce for 3/4 of the oil to reduce the fat.  i think that's why mine turned out so moist.  really good recipe.  just wish the hubby would eat them too!

I used milk instead of buttermilk, omitted the raisins and used white wheat flour instead of all purpose. I put a dollop of my home made raspberry jam inside and they were terrific!

Great recipe - moist and delicious!  Couldn't find wheat bran so used Trader Joe's High Fiber Cereal (twigs).  Soaking them in the buttermilk works great.  Added 3/4 C chopped walnuts and a couple Tbs ground flaxseed. Used WW flour instead of AP.  Left out the raisins.  Very happy with the outcome. Thanks for the terrific recipe!

I thought they were a bit dense, but bran muffins are probably supposed to be that way. I am used to lighter, less healthy ones. They were pretty good though. I added in a few blueberries.

these muffins are terrific. I double this recipe. The only thing i do differently is rather than adding raisins, I added a big handful of fresh blueberries and I bake them in an oversized muffin pan.  Super moist and delicious.  I like to grab one of these with a cup of coffee on my way out to work in the morning.

These are fantastic muffins! Great texture and flavor. I've made them twice in one week already. I substituted frozen blueberries for the raisins and added some chopped pecans. Also used half whole-wheat and half unbleached white flour.

This was my first time making bran muffins; like some of the others, I used the lemon/milk method for buttermilk.  Since my husband is diabetic, and I have serious health issues, I may do some switches myself. This recipe is very easy, and it can be very versatile. My husband loved these muffins, so it will go into my collection of recipes I keep! Thank you for sharing your recipe!! Blessings to you!!

Yum!  I LOVE bran muffins--my mom used to make them out of bran cereal and I love that this way is so much cheaper to make than buying a whole box of cereal.  I use about 1/2 c. honey instead of the sugar and do the milk-and-vinegar method for the buttermilk.  Delicious!

These are delicious!  And so quick and easy to make. I used 2% milk instead of buttermilk because thats what I had in the fridge. They were great, everyone loved them. Very moist.

This recipe was so tasty. I used a buttermilk substitute (milk and lemon juice) and omitted the raisins (Hubby's preference). He loved them! I had people asking me to make more! Thank you : )

I was trying to recreate some amazing muffins we had on vacation - and this was it!  I just added about 2 cups of peeled, diced apple instead of raisins to get the desired outcome.  Will definitely be adding this one to my permanent collection.

This was my first time making bran muffins and I thought they turned out pretty good.Mine were slightly dry and  the only thing I changed was I used half oil and half applesauce.I also added a little cinnamon.I thought they had a great flavor though and I'll probably make these again.

Added 2 TBSP golden wheat germ in with bran, added extra 1/4 buttermilk, 1/2 cup crushed pineapple and used 1/4 cup of pinapple juice to plump up raisins by putting the juice and raisins in the microwave for 1 min.   delicious

Excellent recipe.  I doubled it so that I would have more.  In the doubled recipe I also added 1/3 cup honey, a little more than a cup of shredded apple and used chocolate chips instead of raisins.  Kids ate them up!

These were VERY good. I used applesauce instead of oil & added about 1/4 of dried cranberries along  with the raisins b/c I had them on hand. The cranberries added a nice tangy flavor. My 9 year old stepdaughter loved these! I'll be making them again. :)

Even more delicious when you sub whole wheat flour for half the flour, add one T each of flax seed and wheat germ, and...drum roll please...sub 1 stick of melted butter for the oil.  I make a batch every Sunday for mid moring snacks.  Also have great results with carrots, apples, bananas, or carrots

I loved this recipe! Used applesauce in replacement of the oil, 1 cup nonfat plain Greek yogurt, 1/4 cup skim milk, 2 egg whites, added 1/4 cup flaxseed and did half white and wheat flour. Used dried cranberries and added some cloves, cinnamon and nutmeg...delicious! Next time, I'll replace the brown sugar with honey for a healthier alternative. Looking forward to trying with ripened bananas instead of the applesauce. Thanks for sharing this recipe! :)

These mufffins turned out great.  I used fat free milk instead of buttermilk (I think this made them a little drier in the end, but not too bad.)  I used walnuts, fresh blueberries and craisins.  They were fabulous!

Delicious!!! I just made these, and ate 2 of them. I was very hesitant to make bran muffins. But they turned out perfect. I did tweak the receipe. I used 1 cup of low fat yoghurt instead of Buttermilk and also added 1/4cup of ground flax seed. I will definately be making these again and again.

Delicious! It was moist and a good crumb texture. I followed the recipe as written except I didn't add the raisins. I don't like raisins in my baked goods. I added chunks of banana instead and it was great! This is my go-to bran muffin recipe from now on!

These were fantastic!  And thanks to the reviewer who recommended using Raisin Bran for the wheat bran, my kids loved picking out the raisins and then dumping them back in at the end.  We all loved the "cereal muffins"!

The first time I made these, I burned them.  They were still good.  The second time, I forgot to add the oil.  Still good.  I'm pretty sure I'll try a third time - they must be fantastic when made right!

This make a delicious, hearty muffin! I used half whole wheat/half all-purpose flour, substituted 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce for the oil and added a full teaspoon of vanilla. I also left out the raisins because my family doesn't prefer them. They turned out perfectly and were enjoyed by my whole family. These simple changes decreased the calories from 168 to 118 and the fat from 7 grams to .9 grams! Not bad for a moist, pleasantly sweetened bran muffin!

When I bake these, everyone who tries them loves them. I used to make them all the time for my roommate, who couldn't get enough, and now I make them for my husband and myself, we have them every morning. They're moist and flavorful, smooth in texture and have just the right amount of sweetness. This recipe is delicious unaltered but I've modified it slightly. I usually double the recipe, and instead of using 1 and 1/3 cup of brown sugar, I use only 1 cup of brown sugar and 1/3 cup of molasses. Thank you for this! Love it!

I found them a little bland since I don't like them with raisins so I used chocolate chips they were yummy. Otherwise I stuck to the recipe as is.

These are very good.  I, too, used applesauce in place of oil and a bit more buttermilk, as the wheat germ appeared thick.  I used 1/3 cup brown sugar and 1/3 cup splenda.  Next time I would use a little bit more splenda, as it could have been a touch sweeter.  Overall, delicious!

The muffins tasted great! I just altered a few ingredients like others - used egg whites instead whole eggs, & added shredded apples.

Wow!!! If you don't think that these are 5-star muffins then you didn't make the recipe right!!!  Soooooo good!   Made them yesterday, they're all gone today. Thankfully they are super easy to make and I'll make more tonight!

Very good muffins, I did substitute applesauce for the oil, otherwise followed the directions completely, I did find the texture not as soft as I would like even after letting the bran soak as directed and I was unsure of the raisins since I'm not too fond of them, but I am glad I put them in, they really add to the flavor here.  All in all a good muffin.

Excellent! I always use the milk/vinegar combo in place of the buttermilk.  I have also subbed applesauce in place of the oil.

Best bran muffin recipe by far!  I doubled it and used my own sour milk, and kept the sugar to 1 cup.  Added a bit extra vanilla and 1 tsp. of cinnamon and 2 tbsp. of ground flax seed.  They came out nice and moist.  I'll be making these often, what a great way to sneak some good stuff into picky eaters!

Wow! amazing and perfect with what's on hand.  I used apple sauce for the oil just to be healthier, post raisin bran cereal and vinegar and milk instead of buttermilk and they turned out great.  Perfect for stress baking and eating something thats great and good for you.

these were good - a nice flavor -- cooked up  nicely.  I tripled the recipe and it made 39 cupcake size muffins.  I also used applesauce instead of the oil, halved the sugar, and used yogurt instead of buttermilk.  we put in raisins and craisins.  they cooked for 17 minutes and came right out of the pan (which I had pammed).  My daughter said they were the best.  I thought they were a little bland.

These are the best bran muffins I've tried.  My husband and his friend had them with coffee this morning and they really liked them.  I didn't change the basic recipe, but I didn't have raisins so I used dried tart cherries instead.  I had to cut them in half because they were so big.  I also added walnuts.

I followed other suggestions and substituted apple sauce for the oil and used low fat buttermilk. I put dried cranberries, blueberries and chopped prunes. They turned out great.

I scaled to 40 servings, which uses the whole box of bran, made 35 muffins, baked in 15 minutes. Very tasty and versatile recipe. I halved the oil and sugar, used ww flour for AP and soaked the raisins in hot water to make them juicy, I also add cinnamon or pumpkin pie spice. My sons loved them!

My first attempt at bran muffins-and it was a success!  I used this as a base recipe and made just a few small changes.  I substituted unsweetened applesauce for the oil, and instead of buttermilk I used 1T lemon juice and added skim milk to make 1 cup.  I also added 1/2 cup flaked coconut.  No raisins.  DELICIOUS and moist!  Even my kids loved them!

This is the most flavorful bran muffin I've found so far.  I made this recipe exactly the first time, then I made it fat free, with a little oat bran added, the second time.  It was great both ways.

These were pretty good I used applesauce in place of the oil. I could not find any wheat bran so I crunched up raisin bran in stead.These were VERY moist.

I didn't change a thing.  This was my first time to make this recipe and it was great; however, next time (for lower fat), I will substitute applesauce for oil.  Thank you!

This is absolutely the best bran muffin I have ever eaten. Made mine with buttermilk and 2 tbspof regular milk. Use raisin bran cereal instead and only 1/2 cup of brown sugar. Neighbors thought they were the best. Thanks for the recipe.

Good with dried cranberries!  They absorb some of the moisture and the cranberries end up plump and moist.  Delicious and healthy!

Make regularly - great for packed lunches / breakfast on the run. I substitue applesauce for the oil, reduced the sugar slightly, and use half raisins / half golden raisins, or sometimes dried cranberries. Keep really well up to 3 days in a tupperware tub.

I doubled the recipe and used frozen blueberries in place of the raisins.  I also reduced the sugar from 1 1/3 cups to 1 cup.  The yield was 18 muffins using 1/4 cup of batter in each muffin paper.

Simply divine!  I wanted to make the recipe a little healthier without going too crazy, so like others, I substituted apple sauce for the oil and used 1/2 C whole wheat flour and 1/2 C regular flour to pack in more fiber.  I also used slightly less sugar but it's still perfectly sweet.  I've been eating these for breakfast with a nice shmear of peanut butter for extra protein - it holds me over until lunch!  I use all organic product and free range "happy" eggs which makes everything taste that much more wonderful.    You will love these!  Now I'm going to try and make them with blueberries...

These muffins are great!  Just used the healthier replacements suggested by others: replaced butter milk w/tbspn of lemon juice and nonfat milk (total 1 cup) and used fiber one cereal cuz it was only bran cereal i had and replaced the oil w/cinnamon apple sauce. Made exactly 12 reg. size muffins.  My 3 & 5 year old kept wanting more and I didn't feel like I was giving them junk food! They loved the raisins in them too. Thanks for the great recipe!

I added a mashed banana and 1/2 cup dried blueberries to the recipe.  Instead of wheat bran, I used bran flakes and microwaved the flakes and milk until warm instead of letting it sit for 10 minutes. Turned out wonderful!!!

Great basic recipe.  I just subbed applesauce for the oil and added cinnamon and nutmeg, only cause I like it.  I split the recipe in half and added blueberries to one and strawberries in the other half.  They were great I will definitely make again.  I can added anything to them, GREAT!!

AMAZING! I made one batch of 12, and it was gone in a day. It was amazingly moist, and for once, my mother did not complain about too much sweetness.  I took the other reviewer's suggestings and substituted apple sauce for oil.  I also added a bit of coconut and chocolate chips.  Instead of vanilla (which I seem to have lost), I added cinnamon. And since I did not have butter milk, I substituted it with milk and vinegar.  Also substitued whole wheat flour for white.   The only thing that I didnt like was the raisins. The flavor clashed with the coconut and the chocolate. I'll be leaving that out next time.

Fantastic! I made as is and they were great. Next time I used some left over cooked squash in place of the oil, added some flax seeds and a little cinnamon. Also used half wholemeal and half white flour, as other reviewers have mentioned. They were great both ways. Thanks for the recipe.

This is recipe is def. a keeper, so easy to make and so easy to mix and match fruit/veggie/nut combos. So far the fav. is carrot/cranberry/pecan. I also put in 1 tsp. of orange zest and used applesauce for the oil. These still came out fantastic, I would highly recommend this recipe.

Great recipe and easy to adapt to personal preferences. I used whole wheat flour, substituted the sugar and oil, and threw in things like flax and still was absolutely fabulous. And made to the recipe results in superb muffins... These will be a weekly staple! They freeze well, and every evening I pull one from my freezer for breakfast!

This is a great recipe!  I make mine with 1/3 cup unsweetened apple sauce instead of the oil and they turn out wonderful.  I've made them twice and the second time I used orange flavored dried cranberries and they were really good!  They would be great with any of your favorite dried fruits!

These were much better than I expected. I really enjoyed them plain with nothing on them even. I didn't have applesauce but so I had to use oil but I did do half wheat flour.  I expected really heavy muffins, hard to eat, but these are soft and fairly light! Thanks!

Very good muffins. Following the advice of another reviewer, I substituted applesauce for the oil, used 2 egg whites,skim milk and 2 egg whites for the egg, and Splenda brown sugar. I did not have wheat bran so I used 2 cups Raisin Bran cereal. I also added 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon. Will definitely be making more of these.

Loved these! Exactly what I was looking for. I omitted the raisins (personal preference) and substituted apple sauce for the oil in an attempt to be more healthy. On some of the muffins, I followed the advice of another reviewer and brushed the top with a little honey straight out of the oven...let me say this made them even better! I don't even need butter to enjoy these muffins. Also, they freeze nicely and make a great quick breakfast or snack. Thanks for the recipe! Will make these again and again.

So Yummy! I followed other suggestions and used unsweetened apple sauce instead of oil. I didn’t have buttermilk, so I used skim milk with a little vinegar. Also, I had oat bran instead of wheat bran so substituted that as well. Didn’t put the raisins in either. They are so moist and delicious, will definitely make these again.

Really like this recipe, its better without the raisens however. Try roasting some almonds and peacans and bake with a little coating of honey. Chop them up fine and add them to this recipe. Adds a dash of sweetness and texture to this dense muffin.

Totally love them! I make them using applesauce instead of oil and only whole wheat flour and I'm not a fan of raisins so I've made them plain or I've used chopped walnuts also. Will make them again and again!

I made these bran muffins for the first time today. Like many others...I cut the fat and sugar by decreasing the sugar and using applesauce instead of oil. I also added 1 t of cinnamon and added a sprinkle of quick oats to the top...mostly for aesthetic reasons. My husband saw them and said I should sell them because they were so yummy and beautiful! Not to mention they are so much healthier than most other muffins. Thank you!!!

Love It!  This will be the only recipe I use in the futre.  I also made the substitutions others made such as sub'n the applesauce for the oil, 1 tbls of lemon juice plus nonfat milk to equal 1 cup, natural whole wheat flour for the all-purpose flour and I used only 1/3 cups of brown sugar plus cranberries.  I read some of the other comments, some said they could not find the wheat bran.  It can be purchase at whole food stores such as Sun Harvest.  It has 13g of fiber in 1 oz ~ the 1 1/2 cups this recipe requires equals 3 oz ~ to the 5-6g you get from bran cereal.  Also it has no sugar like bran cereal do.  Same with the whole wheat flour, it is all natural, has 4g of fiber and less than 1g of sugar.  Thus making the muffins a whole lot healthier for you.

WOW!!!  i've never made bran muffins before b/c i wasn't sure if my kids would like them.  i want to eat healthier, so i decided to try these out.  i made a few subs from what i had on hand.  used applesauce instead of oil, 1/2 WW/white flour, used Raisin Bran cereal then added 1/2 cup cranberries to the batter, then sprinkled raw sugar on top.  fantastic!  both my boys have already eaten 2 and i just took them out of the oven 15 mins ago.  will definately put these into my rotation.  perfect healthy snack.

The batter is so dense.  I used applesauce instead of vegetable oil.  It really sticks to the paper.  Taste average.  I will try other recipes.

Great recipe!  I used 1/3 cup honey and no brown sugar.  1/2 cup whole wheat flour, 1/2 cup unbleached white flour, 1 teaspoon vanilla and added chocolate chips to add kid appeal.  My 3 1/2 year old ate it up!  Yum!

These are wonderful; moist, very filling and offer great variety for making them to my own taste!  I make them with whole wheat flour and use honey instead of brown sugar.  I will add a variety of fruits depending on my mood and I like that they freeze really well, although they don't last very long.  They make an ideal breakfast.  This recipe hangs on my fridge as I typically make them at least once every week

Applesauce instead of oil, honey instead of brown sugar, and use half whole wheat flour.  Also, used cracked wheat instead of wheat bran and it worked oK.

These just came out of the oven, and they are fantastic!  I used 1 cup of plain lowfat yogurt in place of the buttermilk.  I also used 2 TBSP oil, and 4 TBSP applesauce in place of the 1/3 cup oil.  They are moist and full of flavor.  Will be making these again soon.

Good, but a little grainy.. I think next time I will try to powder the wheat bran so it is less grainy, otherwise these had an amazing taste and I will make them again.

GREAT muffins.  My husband and I finished the whole batch in one day.  I left out the oil and replaced it with 1/2 c. applesauce.  I replaced the regular flour for whole wheat and added a tsp. of almond extract.  I also put in about 1/2 c. flax meal and cut the sugar in half.  When baking I scooped a spoonful of batter into my muffin pan, made a well in the center and put in a tsp. of raspberry preserves and topped it with another spoonful of batter.  They were fantastic!

Really tasty for folks looking for a low cholesterol snack. I used low-fat buttermilk, applesauce for the oil, 2 egg whites/no yolks, half brown sugar half splenda and added 1/2 t each cinnamon and nutmeg for a little more spice. Used golden raisins since the market was out of normal raisins. Next time I think I'll add shredded carrots.
Had a hard time finding wheat bran, finally found it at Kroger by the pancake mixes.

These were very very tasty! I used a combination of wheat bran and barley "nuggets" that provided a nice crunch and substituted plain yogurt for buttermilk. They were much lighter and less dense than many bran muffins I've had!

I loved these muffins.  I used Splenda brown sugar.... and applesauce in place of the oil to cut calories and they turned out perfect.  However, after looking over the recipe just now, hubby informs me he thinks he only put in 1/2 cup of All Bran......... Oh well, they are VERY good and since cutting out 2/3 of the All Bran saved me 160 calories, maybe next time I'll just use 1 cup of bran.

Great basic recipe ... I used All-Bran Bran Buds, replaced the oil with applesauce, and skipped the raisins ... oh, and I cut the sugar in half ... I think they are awesome ... I just made all 12, and I keep them in a ziploc bag in the fridge ... heat for about 15 seconds in the microwave, and they are ready to go! Thanks!

This is the best bran muffin recipe I've ever tried - and so easy! I love substituting the ingredients for healthier options as well and it always turns out just as good! I substitute the oil for applesauce, flour for whole wheat, halve the sugar, and use frozen blueberries instead of raisins. You can substitute any fruit! I keep them in the freezer and pull one out at a time to microwave. Always a healthy treat!

delicious! used spelt flour, applesauce and Tbs butter for the oil, 3/4 tsp cinnamon and orange zest, less baking soda and 1/2 date in each muffin. Baked at 350 for 20 minutes. My new favourite. Will try a variation using rolled oats soaked in the milk/lemon juice and another with ginger/spice/molasses.

These are very good. I double the batch because 12 just aren't enough. I put 1 cup of fresh blueberries in these instead of the raisins, and they are great that way.

these might have tasted better if i had followed the recipe exactly, but i used another reviewer's suggestion and added cinnamon, which created an odd taste with the bran. however, my coworkers loved them.

did not use oil - I used applesauce instead.  Want to add carrots next time and cut back on sugar.   Maybe try the non-fat yogurt instead of buttermilk too.

The recipe itself is fine, I made no substitutions the first couple of times.  There has been a significant problem however with getting the muffins to come out of the pan.  Even using a nonstick pan, neither oil nor grease resulted in the muffins coming out of the pan in one piece.  I won't try using muffin cups (they can't be recycled, only thrown into a landfill to harm the environment) and this is not a problem any other muffin recipes exhibit with the same pans.  
Regardless of how good the muffins taste, I'll have to forgo using the recipe again.  A bowl full of muffin parts just does not appeal to my family.

I made two batches: one with dried cherries and one with blueberries.  They're both good, but the blueberry ones are the best!

Just made these and for my first time baking muffins, I'm very satisfied. The original recipe is wonderful and very versatile, considering how simple it is to make substitutions. I myself made a couple. 

For one, I used half a cup of All-Purpose flour and half a cup of Whole Wheat. I also used a cup of light vanilla flavor soy milk in place of the buttermilk which I did not have. Instead of raisins, I added some rolled oats to the batter as well as two tablespoons of natural maple syrup (the real stuff!). For garnish, I sprinkled some rolled oats.

Overall they were simple to prepare and turned out great. This is a great recipe and a healthful one too!

Everybody loves when I make these - they're quick and delicious!  I always sub a little bit of applesauce for some of the oil, and I sub some whole wheat flour for some of the all-purpose flour to make it a little healthier.  No one notices and they taste great!

Awesome!! I used 1 cup plain yogurt for the buttermilk, omitted the sugar and used 1/3 cup maple syrup. I also used 1/2 white flour, 1/2 ww flour. No raisins. Soooo fabulous with cream cheese or a slice of cheddar!

Really, really yummy! Like some of the others that made this recipe I used skim milk with a tablespoon of lemon juice and applesauce for the oil and it turned out delicious! I also put in a full teaspoon of vanilla too not just 1/2 and blueberries. Yum! Yum! WIll make this again for sure:)

I made this recipe for the 2nd time. We had to double it since 12 is just not enough! This time I substituted 1/2 of the oil with ripe banana. They turned out absolutly delicious! I think they are even better this time. We love this recipe.

I made these with one variation due to lack of supplies at our little grocery store.  So I used bran flakes and soaked them in the buttermilk instead of bran.

Neverless, the muffins turned out wonderfully, they're just as moist today and I'm always thankful for this site and that ratings aren't just stars, but everyday people with tips too, just in case!

I have never made bran muffins and these were exactly how I'd imagine them.

I did the low fat version someone suggested (applesauce for oil, ffmilk+lemon juice for buttermilk, less sugar, 1/2wheat flour).

They are delicious. Next time I'll add some shredded carrot or zuccini to make them sweeter and juicer. YUM!
Thanks for the great recipe.

This is the first time I've ever made muffins.  I was told to put more fibre in my diet and I bought the store brand.  They felt soooo greasy and I could just feel them clogging my arteries!  This recipe is GREAT.  I subbed pretty much the same as everyone.  Thank you for allrecipes.

These muffins were very soft tasty, I substituted the butter milk for 2% milk and put in chopped apples (very small) and omitted the raisins it made a real nice fluffy 12 pack of muffins with tiny apple peices in there it was delicious this is worth a try for sure!!

I don't give out five stars very often. Only if the recipe needs not improvement. This one does not. It is excellant! I used dates, because I had run out of raisins and they were excellant. Some w/o as well. These are better than the bakery muffins at the store. Fresh baked, mmmm. I am going to make these again. Next time I will try w/applesauce for a lower fat version, only because they are so good, I could eat the whole batch myself and need less calories! Thanks for the recipe!

when everyone is  adding to and changing your recipe, you might think it is because it isn't very good.  But in this case I think it is a testament of how great this recipe is.  Some people love them as is, and others love to change them to suit their dietary needs; not because there is a problem with the recipe just because thy want to try something special.  The conclusion is this muffin has the holding power to become everyones "muffin"

five stars.

These were divine! I replaced the oil with applesauce and was somewhat worried they might be dry/tough, but they aren't at all. They're amazingly delicious and very, very healthy! We used cranberries, but I can't wait to try raisins, apples, chocolate chips, etc. Thanks for the near-perfect recipe for a great morning treat!

I think this is a really good starter recipe.  I also substituted the oil for applesauce, whole wheat pastry flour for the all purpose, craisins for raisins, and added a few T. of molassas and 1/2 cup finely diced apples.  They turned out very moist and flavorful.  Next time however, I'm going to try subbing oat flour for the all purpose.  Thanks for the great start on this recipe.  It will be fun to experiment and decide which variation I like best.

"Classic" is right!  Very good, basic recipe.  I used 2 egg whites instead of the whole egg, but otherwise followed the recipe as written.  Well...I added extra raisins (plumped in hot water and drained).  Will surely use this recipe again.

Delicious!  The buttermilk is a nice touch.  My husband is not a raisin fan, so I substituted 1/4 c currants for the 1/2 c raisins.  Currants are a good compromise because they provide that sweet chewy texture, but not as big and soft as raisins.

I used oat bran because thats what I had. Also added 4 small well smashed overripe bananas. No other changes. Made 18 so they would be good for portion control Excellent- will keep this one. Oh yea- be careful with the kids as they are very high in fiber- you know what that can cause!

So far, the best bran muffins I have ever had. Even my six-year-old asks for them! They are pleasantly sweet and wonderfully moist. They are definitely going to be a regular addition in our weekly diet.

These bran muffins are excellent!  I took the advice of another reviewer and replaced the oil with cinnamon apple sauce. Moist, sweet and delicious and so easy to make.

Fantastic!  Here are the changes I made (due to lack of other ingredients & for health):

Instead of oil, I used sugar-free peach-flavored applesauce (it's all I had).  Instead of milk/lemon juice or buttermilk, I used plain soy milk.

I had no muffin paper so I sprayed my muffin pan with cooking spray.

They came out perfectly.  20 minutes exactly.  I plan to make them weekly so I can take them to work for breakfast.

I guess they were fine for what they were... but we ate 3 out of the dozen, and I had to choke mine down.  My 2 year old normally loves these things, and he wouldn't eat his.
Maybe I just need to add some things...

this recipe was really good! i switched the white to wheat flour, and used applesauce instead of the oil like one of the reviews did. i thought it was really good but i thought it was really really branny. that probably doesnt make sense but it was still wonderful!

FANTASTIC!  These are the best bran muffins ever!  I used All Bran cereal, applesauce instead of oil, and egg whites instead of one whole egg.  Absolutely delicious.  This goes on my all-time favorites list.

followed recipe exactly (used powdered buttermilk though which shouldn't have affected recipe) and they were incredibly perfect.  to lower the fat next time, i'll use applesauce instead of oil and see what happens.  great great recipe.

I always use my favorite bran muffin recipe from Companys coming, but thought I would try this for a change.
Changes other then olive oil(in all my baking), Kamut flour and Ohhh yeah I added a TBS. molasses, cus that's a must to me!
Found the batter too dry and once baked they were actually gummy??
Will try again just to see any differences.

Excellent base recipe! I made a couple of alterations: 1. instead of soaking the bran in buttermilk I used a cup of blended skin milk with an apple. 2. I used both brown/granulated sugar and slightly lowered the quantity due to the natural sugars in the apple. 3. Sub cranberries for raisins and heat them up in a ½ cup of oj on low heat for 10 minutes. 4. If you want the recipe to be a little bit more moist add the oj to the batter. Due to additional liquid add approx 3 minutes to cooking time.  enjoy! :o)

I make these muffins every week. They're so versatile! I add different dried fruits that I pick up at Trader Joe's. I've used dried cherries, apples, and peaches so far. Instead of wheat bran, I've substituted oat bran and I also use whole wheat flour and Splenda brown sugar (1/2 cup).

These are really, really great!  Probably the best bran muffin I've ever had.  They are best fresh, but reheat pretty well.  My toddler also loved them and called them cupcakes - you can't beat that!

I thought these were good.  A little crumbly after a few days, but tasty and healthy.  I used a splenda/brown sugar blend for the sugar and canola oil instead of veg oil.  I also used frozen blueberries in place of the raisins, but any fruit would do.  These are very versitle and a good healthy snack.

I have made this exactly as written and also by substituting shredded apple for raisins, adding a little cinnamon and  substituting 1/4 cup wheat flour both ways were wonderful. It tastes healthy and you can tell that it is a bran muffin, but that is what I love about this recipe, healthy doesn't always have to taste like cardboard!

First time I followed the recipe and they were very good but I've since made a few changes that I enjoy even more. I use lowfat milk and a tbsp lemon juice instead of buttermilk, 1/4 cup veg oil, 1/4 milled flax seed and whole wheat flour instead of AP. Cinnamon adds a nice flavour. I've also added mashed banana at times or apple sauce.

These muffins smelled so good baking that I couldn't wait and burned my mouth on them right out of the oven! I am quite new to healthful cooking and was looking for a wholesome bran muffin recipe. This is it! We substituted whole flour for all purpose and used applesauce in place of oil as other members suggested. With my husband reading the directions we managed to mix everything in one bowl without soaking or sifting anything and it still came out great! We also used cane juice sugar instead of regular white sugar. Such a keeper!

Definitely what I was looking and hoping for.  I could eat the entire dozen, but I'll be good. :)  I used whole wheat flour instead of all purpose flour and wheat bran flakes instead of wheat bran.  Recipe made exactly 12 muffins.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

These were awesome. Out of preference for a spicier muffin, I added a bunch of cinnamon, along with some cloves and nutmeg. I also used Splenda because my dad is diabetic. It worked out great.

These are great. I used 1 c. milk and 1 Tbsp lemon juice instead of buttermilk, put in half whole wheat flour, and accidently cooked them at 450 for 15 min. great texture. i also used dried cranberries instead of raisins.

Best bran muffin recipe I've ever tried!  My kids are crazy about these muffins and they are a favorite food gift.  I often bring these to new moms.  The muffins are moist and sweet and we follow the recipe.

I made these for my mom and she really liked them.  Very moist and almost had a cake consistency.  I might consider adding some chopped walnuts next time.

Excellent recipe. Not too sweet, not too bland, chewy texture. Like others, I substituted the white flour for whole wheat flour. I also used organic ingredients to make truly healthy muffins, and they came out fabulous.

These are really good and moist, just like what you would get in a bakery.  I left out the raisins for personal preference and was making these once a week for a while!

These were great! I used 'craisins' as someone else suggested and had to cook them a bit longer than the recipe calls for, but overall a bit hit!

I woke up at 5:00am this morning and made this easy recipe.  I didn't change a thing.  They were moist, just perfect.  Next time I'll use wheat flour and add some wheat germ and use egg beaters.

Pretty good for a bran muffin!  I didn't have buttermilk but soured mine with vinegar.  Would like to try the real deal  next time.  I added chopped apple rather than raisins and would add some cinnamon next time too.  Will make these again for sure.

What a great bran muffin!!  I added unsweetened coconut, raisins, cubed tart apple, milk choc chips and pecans.  I also did half and half white and whole wheat flour.  Unbelievably good.  Definately give this recipe a try.  Don't skip the liners -my mini muffins stuck to the tray.

Good and healthy - my favorite combo. I made about a million substitutions in this one: No sugar added applesauce for oil; 1/2C whole wheat flour and 1/2C all purpose flour for 1C of all purpose; 2/3C egg beaters in place of two eggs; Sour milk (1TBSP vinegar + milk to make one cup) instead of buttermilk; oat bran instead of wheat bran because that's what I had on hand; and walnuts instead of raisins because I  didn't have any raisins. Still turned out fabolous! Sooo healthy and a great breakfast - in fact I ate two of them this morning.

Yum! I replaced the oil with applesauce, the buttermilk with skim milk, and added a handful of extra raisins.  I soaked the raisins in hot water while I was making the batter in order to make them more moist.  To compensate for the sugar in the applesauce, I cut back a bit on the brown sugar, but next time I think I'll put in the whole amount anyway.  And there WILL be a next time!

Hearty, delicious muffin full of flavor.  I doubled the recipe to freeze some for later.  I used 1/2 whole wheat flour, 1/2 white flour--texture turned out great!  I also used golden raisins and extra baking powder.  They still didn't rise that well.   Great recipe!

I love this recipe!  The muffins are moist and tasty.  

My modifications (I double the recipe):

-lowfat organic milk instead of buttermilk
-cut the sugar (i use Sucanat) to 3/4 cup for a 24-muffin recipe because I don't think they need to be that sweet.
-whole wheat rather than white flour

My kids loved these! The first batch I made as written, although I subbed raisins,and they were very good. On the second batch, I made some changes. Instead of all white flour, I used a half cup of white and a half cup of graham flour. I also used a half cup dark and half cup golden raisins and a small apple chopped. I added a little bit of apple pie spice and sprinkled a little bit of raw sugar on top. 

I think this will be my new bran muffin recipe. I can think of many different ways to use this recipe! 

Thank you!

Healthy, hearty muffins!  I crushed up wheat bran flake cereal that I had and used that instead of wheat bran (because I didn't have any) and it turned out just fine.  I also used dried cherry/golden raisin mix instead of regular raisins and those were great!

I love this recipe!  The muffins are delicious and moist. I first printed this recipe out in 2002 and have been making them regularly ever since.  I do substitute some molasses for the brown sugar to give them a nice, dark color.  They freeze well.  Recently I substituted 1/3 cup Splenda and 1/3 cup molasses for the brown sugar to cut back the sugar content and they still came out delicious.

Made these today for the first time.  We have some food allergies in our family so I replaced the buttermilk with Rice milk, used 2 cups diced apples in place of the raisins and Ener-G's egg replacer instead of egg.  The end result was wonderful...thanks

They taste good for bran muffins, but one must remember that they ARE bran muffins and not cake.  I used a mixture of grape nuts and oatmeal along with dried cranberries and I think they turned out pretty darn good.

We love these muffins! I use half whole wheat and half white flour, and add chopped apple instead of raisins. I took them to work recently and a bunch of people asked for the recipe. Great recipe!

These were good, but probably nothing I will crave, though.  I would probably make them with applesauce instead of oil next time to make them a little healthier.  Otherwise, a decent bran muffin!

I like when recipes are flexible and this one was just great! I was able to add chopped up prunes, walnuts and coconut flakes without compromising the moisture (I did add 2 tblsp walnut oil just in case). So go ahead and try this one in a variety of flavours!!

Delicious! I added raisins and blueberries. Even people that won't eat bran ate these. I used All Bran cereal for 1/2 of the wheat bran. I'll make these again.

Not bad, pretty good for fairly low oil content. Vanilla is a nice touch.

Wow! These were the best bran muffins I've had. I didnt have buttermilk, so like others I used 2% and a splash of lemon juice. I also had a zuchinni in the fridge, so I grated it and through it in the mix. Thanks for the recipe Janet, I'll be making these for many mornings to come.

Delicious! I used applesauce instead of oil and raisin bran cereal. They were so moist! I have been using the whole egg but will probably use egg whites or Egg Beaters next time. I may experiment with soy milk too instead of buttermilk. But as is, these are the best! Thanks for sharing.

These are truly addicting!  I used oat bran instead of wheat bran and added a bit of cinnamon.  They turned out soft and moist.  I will be making these very often, I'm sure.

These were the best bran muffins.  I did make some changes, as suggested my past reviewers.  I substituted applesauce instead of oil & added cinnamon.  When they were finished it was missing something so I sprinkled McCormick's Allspice on the top and it was perfect.  Next time I will just add the Allspice when mixing ingredients.  I will definitely make these again real soon.

Excellent!!!  It was so moist and just good.  I forgot to let the buttermilk and wheatbran stand for 10 minutes and it still turned out great.  Also, you can add chocolate chips, kids will love it.

These muffins are excellent.  I have been looking for a recipe like this forever, I am so glad I found it.  My husband loves these muffins for work.  They are not too dry like some others.  I will definately make these again.
Great!!!

This is the best muffin I have ever made!  They turned out great, and there's no need to feel guilty for eating more than one.  What a great healthy recipe, and my kids loved them too.  I also found they taste just as good the next day, as they don't dry out like most other muffins do.
