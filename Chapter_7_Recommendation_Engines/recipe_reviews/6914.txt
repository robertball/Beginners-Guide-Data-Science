I accidently made it home from the grocery store with a bag of dried cranberries. I dont know how they ended up in my bag, but since I paid for them, I checked this site to figure out what to do with them.  I had all of the ingredients for this recipe.  I purposely left out the raisins and zest but used o.j with lots of pulp.  I loved this bread.  It tastes just like the cranberry loaf they bake and sell for $8 down at our gourmet bread store in town.

This loaf turns out really nicely. The graham cracker crumbs give a nice, not-too-sweet flavour and a beautiful brown finish. It's important to let the loaf cool for 10 minutes after taking it out of the oven in order to let the cake "set", otherwise it tends to fall apart.

I don't like fruit cake, so this is an excellent substitution.

Very cool recipe with a few heart healthy changes.  I used Splenda Brown Sugar Substitue in place of the regular brown sugar and omitted the oil altogether.  I used 1 cup of whole cranberries in sauce (leftover from Christmas dinner) and cut the o.j. to half a cup.  Also added 1/2 cup craisins and used 1/2 cup raisins. I didnt have any nuts other than pecans but decided against using them as with it taking an hour to bake - didn't want the delicate pecans to burn. I also had no oranges for the zest but the o.j. was enough to flavour it.  It turned out to be a very nice, dense bread with lots of zing and I especially liked the use of the graham wafer crumbs - different!
Thanks for the recipe, with the above changes, I imagine it cut the fat by at least 2/3rds! Every little bit helps in the battle of the waist-line!

11.18.13 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/6914/cranberry-loaf/ ... Edible fruitcake! Ha! Seriously, it’s good! Maybe I’ll even try a little pineapple&less oil next time. It’s very good. I just can’t leave a good recipe well enough alone. :D The only changes I made are substituting an additional 1/4c graham crumbs&1/4c oats for the nuts due to allergy. ‘Didn’t have the orange rind either. Oh, well. :) A third cup oil isn’t too much, but a quarter cup is fine as well. 12.12 Double recipe. ‘Tried adding a can of crushed pineapple & while it wasn’t bad, it wasn’t better. I drained it&added enough orange juice to equal a cup. It just lessened the orange flavor, but really didn’t add any pineapple flavor – even the pineapple pieces. Strange, but true! :D ‘Stick with the original – for now. I’m thinking of trying blueberries or half blue, half cran.1/2012: Tried frozen homegrown (sweet) blueberries & notsogood. This bread needs a stronger flavored fruit. I couldn’t find any cranberries, even frozen, so used all blueberries – &more than it states. Mostly tasted the orange&it should be an afterthought, not first impression. ‘Stickin’ w cranberries! Oh, I forgot to tell ya there’s NO need to chop those berries. What a waste of time. As you slice the bread … voila! 12/12/12 Tried the 1c confec, 2T oj, 1t vanilla glaze poked&poured while hot in pan. After 10, removed. More moist&sweet, but not a big flavorchanger. Good either way.Dbl:3/4c oats&no addt’l gc for nuts.No dryness problem. 1

THis is an excellent recipe.  My grandmother used to make a cranberry bread that was my favorite.  We have the recipe but it is missing an ingredient.  This one is so close it makes me smile everytime I make it.  Some have likened it to fruitcake.  I hate fruitcake and to me it is not anything like fruitcake.  It is great for breakfast or snack.

I made this loaf for my Christmas baking this year.  The taste was good, but was a wee bit disappointed because the texture was very crumbly, when cut into slices.  Because of this, I likely won't make it again.

I enjoyed this recipe very much.  I love the addition of graham cracker crumbs!  I made as directed, adding only a teaspoon of vanilla.  I believe this recipe was intended to be made with fresh cranberries, rather than dried, as some reviewers have used.  I made 15 muffins (baked at 350 for 20 minutes), which turned out very tender and not overly sweet.

I had some cranberries and wasn't sure what I wanted to do with them, so I found this recipe.  I started making it and realized that I didn't have orange juice.  I wanted to keep on going, so I put skim milk instead of orange juice, and it came out really good.  I didn't use raisins (because I don't like them).  I also used half all purpose flour and half whole wheat flour. The loaf turned out delicious and not too sweet, which I love.  By the way, I only baked it 45 minutes.  I suspect the time depends on your oven, so just make sure you check it frequently after 40 minutes, to make sure it doesn't burn or overcook and become too dry.

This was all right. I used whole dried cranberries, but chopped would have been better. This was a little too tart. Maybe next time I would replace half the cranberries with raisons.

I made this bread and left out the raisins and nuts.  My family prefers it that way.  It was wonderful! I will make this often!

My husband took one bite and refused to have any more. He didn’t even finish the slice he had. But that is probably his reaction. I myself found it very tart, but had lots of different textures and tasted. But honestly, I don’t think I’d make this one again

This has become a staple for Christmas breakfast and we give it as gifts.  The orange juice, zest and graham crackers really make it stand out.  The only changes we make is to leave out the raisins and nuts.

Yummy! I doubled the recipe and then used 1 cup white flour/1 cup wheat flour. (OK, I admit that I DID omit the raisins, but I'm sure many can commiserate with my anti-raisin stance!) The result was a dense but flavorful loaf.  This recipe is NOT for a Twinkie-like, fluffy cake loaf studded with little cranberry pearls: this loaf means business! My wheat flour addition made it  ready to be packed for a hike! It was yummy to boot. Great idea to have graham cracker crumbs in it- I think it made all the difference.

I really didn't care for this recipe. It seemed very bitter, most likely due to the cranberries and no sugar. I'm guessing for diabetics it might be good but it's kind of bland. If I were to try making it again I probably would drizzle some frosting over it just to give it some flavor and sweetness.

Excellent loaf, reminds you of fruitcake.
