With a few changes, this is perfect. First off, I also reduced the amount of cream cheese by half, so it adds body but not too much tangy flavor. Second, I hate the synthetic taste of Cool Whip, so I use real whipped cream, or at least Reddi Whip. Finally (and I know this is a matter of opinion) I prefer it after 24 hours in the fridge, when the Oreos have gotten softer and more cake-like. My kids, however, prefer them same-day crunchy. I had no trouble covering the bottom of a 9x13 pan with the cookies, but I think it helps to grind them finer than the recipe suggests.

This was a very good layered dessert. A bit time consuming as each layer is done seperatly but when done in a clear dish looks lovely. I used one box of pudding and one and a half blocks of cream cheese ( 12 oz total) and it wasn't tangy at all. I would go with the full two next time. I also would double the pudding amount ( 2 boxes and four cups of milk). I had plenty of cookies to cover the 9x13 inch pan with reserving one cup for on top. I crushed the cookies in a ziplock bag- they were piecy and gave a great texture to the dish. Mine was definitely firm enough to be cut into squares and held it's shape wonderfully, so not sure why some people said it was runny. I made it with chocolate pudding but may try vanilla with golden oreos next time. I plan to make this again and again! Thanks :)

Loved this-I have chocolate lovers in my family, so I used devil's food pudding in place of the vanilla, and it was great!

I made this and took it to my husband's office and the guys went crazy for it asking for the recipe for their wives!  I used 2 small boxes of chocolate pudding mixed with 3 cups of milk and a teaspoon of vanilla for the pudding layer.  For the cookie crust, I crushed the cookies fine and used the bite size pieces for the topping.  Very, very yummy!!

Took other reviewers advice and cut back on the cream cheese. Thank goodness I did because even though I love cream cheese, I couldn't imagine using two packages in this recipe. I could see how some people found the filling to be extremely tangy. Don't understand why the photo (which I realize was probably not taken by the submitter) was round when the directions clearly stated using a 9X13 inch pan. Also, from the photo, there are four alternate layers of black and white. I kept reading the directions to see if I was missing something. Nonetheless, the cake was quick and easy to put together and a hit with hubby, the kids and their boyfriends. Thanks so much Pam!

Recipe needed some pizazz. To much white in the recipe. Chocolate pudding might have been better than vanilla.

Absolutely delicious!  The only change I made was to use real whipped cream instead of cool whip.  To make the whipped cream, use 3 cups of whipping cream (this will make about 6 cups of whipped cream, corresponding to 16 oz cool whip) with a tsp of vanilla and a few tsp of sugar mixed in.    Also, I used the full amount of cream cheese listed in the recipe.  I definitely recommend using the entire 2 pkgs of cream cheese.  It's not tangy at all, and I think the recipe would be lacking without the cream cheese.  I used vanilla pudding, but I'm sure chocolate would also taste good.  Highly recommend this dessert, even though it's not healthy!

This was a good basic recipe to play off of.  I made the following changes to suit our taste:  Cut back cream cheese in half (only 1 pkg).  Added vanilla extract to cream cheese picture.  Used chocolate pudding but make the pudding as if you are using it for a pudding pie, cut back on the milk.  It will hold together better.  I processed the cookies a bit more, almost to crumbs.  I assembled the layers in a pie pan as follows:  Cookie/butter mixture on the bottom, followed by cream cheese mixture, followed by more cookie crumbs, and I added a little milk to soften the cookies.  On top of that I added chocolate pudding, and finished with cool whip, chocolate cookies.  It was great, it stayed together and cut perfectly.

I used chocolate pudding instead of vanilla and sprinkled hershey's cookies and cream candy bar on top which added a nice flavor.  Make sure you blend the cream cheese mixture by a hand mixer, it is too thick.

I tried this recipe for a treat for work and I was very disappointed. I don't think it was as good as some of the reviews claimed. Where I live we consider this dessert a torte but this was not as nearly has thick as a torte. I had a terrible time with the crust. It didn't want to stick to the bottom of the pan.

This was very good and I will definitely be making this again.  I used chocolate oreos (used my food processor to chop into bite size pieces), chocolate pudding and french vanilla whipped topping.  Delicious!  Thank you for sharing.

My boyfriend loves oreos, so I decided to make this cake for his 23rd birthday. He couldn't get enough! He absolutely loved it. It was very tasty and easy to make. The only things I changed in the recipe was that I put in only ONE 8 ounce package of cream cheese and used chocolate pudding instead of vanilla. I recommend this Oreo Cookie Cake!

Note: this recipe doesn't not make a "cake" like the one in the photo. it's a layered dessert.

My mother used to make this only on special occaisions when I was growing up. I only used one package of cream cheese and used chocolate pudding instead of vanilla.

"Healthy" tip: You can find fat free/sugar free versions of every ingredient in this recipe (well, except the powdered sugar). Believe it or not, the healthier ingredients do not take away from the taste of this dessert. Simply amazing.

I sent each of my dinner guests home with a Tupperware full of the dessert -- they raved about it all night.

Yum! Yum! Yum!  Made this on vacation.  Used only one block of cream cheese and it was perfect!  When I melted the butter, I just poured it over the Oreos on the bottom of the 9 x 13 and mixed it around before I pressed it into the pan.  One less dirty dish!  I also had some leftover toasted pecans from a salad I had served for dinner.  We sprinkled those on top....divine!

I MADE THIS 2DAY FOR MY FAMILY. I DID CHANGE IT A LITTLE BY MAKING MY OWN WHIPPED CREAM JUST A PREFERENCE OVER USING THE FAKE OIL SO-CALLED WHIPPED CREAM,I ADDED A COUPLE SPLAHES OF VANILLA TO THE WHIPPED CREAM AND CREAM CHEESE MIXTURE. I DO THINK 1 BLOCK OF CREM CHEESE WOULD ALSO BEEN ENOUGH, BUT MORE IS BETTER I ALWAYS SAY.. WAS DELICIOUS AND WILL MAKE AGIAN DEFINATELY..NICE TO HAVE A EASY NO BAKE DESSERT ON HOT SUMMER DAYS..THANKS FOR THE RECIPE.

This was outstanding!  We used chocolate fudge pudding instead of the vanilla and I think this is SO good any pudding flavor would work.  My hubby- who only rates as high as a 4 (and that is generous) gave this a 5!  This was easy enough to make that our 6 yr old helpled me.

Besides tasting delicious, all the layers to this resulted in something more like a cake, rather than just pudding.  It was also convenient because I could add each layer as I had time throughout the day.

This was excellent.  Every time I make this my staff at work just craves more more more!  I have alternated with using vanilla pudding or chocolate pudding, each with much success. Sometimes I will freeze the entire dish so it is more like a frozen cake as opposed to a pudding.  Just depends on what you like/what occasion you are using.  I have also successfully halved this recipe and had the same luck.    Well done recipe.

This was pretty good. I have been making a similar recipe for yrs. called Brownie Delight. The only diff. is that my recipe calls for cubed brownies instead of Oreos & a slightly diff. cream cheese layer (i.e. an 8 AND 3 oz. block of cream cheese is mixed w/ 2 c. confectioner's sugar/2 c. Cool-whip). I definitely prefer my stand-by recipe.  For one, the cream cheese layer in this recipe is waaay too tangy. I guess I could have ommitted one of the blocks of cream cheese as other's suggested (and I wish I would have...). I am glad that I subbed choc. pudding for vanilla tho (vanilla would be too bland, both color & tastewise). I brought this to a friends house last night. My fiance & I were invited to watch the OSU/USC fball game (go Buckeyes!) on their big screen TV. After the oh so SAAAD loss, we needed sugar (and boy this is SWEEET - I even used ff, sf pudding/Cool-whip, sugar sub. & red.-fat Oreos/cream cheese to accommodate my diabetic friend!!!)!!! My friend's son liked this a LOT (he asked for 2nd's & mom had to keep him from eating 3rd's!!!). I must say, I am glad I tried this recipe (and it's INSANELY easy to prepare to boot - just plan ahead so it has time to chill), even if I wasn't crazy for it. One word of caution (I warned you...): Your kiddos will be BOUNCING OFF THE WALLS AFTER EATING THIS - hahaha! Thx. for sharing your recipe, Pam :)

VERY easy to make. I used my food processor to chop up the Oreos and it worked wonderfully.

I did find this dessert too rich, but I used chocolate pudding rather than vanilla so it might be my own fault lol

Overall it's a quick, simple, and yummy recipe.

This is my husband's favorite dessert and his co-workers always ask for it when they have a potluck. I've changed it up a bit by using chocolate pudding rather than vanilla. Also I thought the cream cheese mixture was a bit too sweet, so I cut the confectioners' sugar in half and it made a huge difference.

Absolutely Delicious!! Instead of layering the cream cheese and pudding - I just mixed it all together and made only 1 layer. I also used low fat cream cheese and cool whip and couldn't tell anything was missing at all!!!

This was great! An absolute hit at our Labor-day cook out. I used reduced fat oreo's, reduced fat cream cheese, splenda, fat free sugar free whipped topping and used chocolate pudding instead of vanilla. It was great, and didn't taste healthy at all!

Love, love, love this recipe. I use chocolate pudding instead of vanilla. I've taken this to many get togethers and everyone loves it. Definitely a big hit! I also use mini chocolate chips in addition to oreo crumbs for the topping.

This is an awesome cheesecake to serve with co-workers or bring to potlucks. The secret to this cheesecake is the vanilla pudding in the cake that makes it so mouthmelting!Don't expect to bring home any leftovers!

I take this to all my potluck parties, and everyone loves it.  It's a great conversation piece because everyone asks for the recipe.  I've tried using cheesecake flavored pudding, and I liked it even better.

What a light, and tasty dessert, perfect for a warm spring or summer day! I followed the recipe exactly, except substituted cookies and cream jello... Yum! From my three year old niece "you make a good cake auntie!"

My family loves this recipe!  It is both sons' request on birthdays, and will be a part of tomorrow's Thanksgiving dessert menu.  I modified it slightly to place all the oreo cookies on the bottom layer instead of saving some for the topping -- and instead I sprinkle chocolate sprinkles on top just prior to serving.  Took this to work also one day for a birthday, and it was a huge hit.

this is a great cake...I've been making it for years with a few changes. First, I only use one package of cream cheese, 2 packages of cool whip, no milk, and instant pudding (in the can).  I use one cool whip with the cream cheese & powdered sugar, and another for the very top.  It's excellent! People of all ages love this!

My husband made this tonight with my 4yo daughter.  He followed the recipe excatly with the exception of 1) using a trifle bowl and doing 2 of each layer, and 2) he used chocolate instant pudding.  All 3 of my kids loved this although they couldn't finish their given serving...I am assuming it was too rich with all of the whipped cream.  It was very messy looking once my husband satrted serving but otherwise looked very yummy!  Thank you for the super easy recipe that allows for little helper hands.  Happy New Years!

This "cake" was really rich and really good.  I did take one reviewer's advice and used only one package of cream cheese.  I also used French Vanilla instead of regular vanilla.  Next time I plan to cut back on the whip cream and add an extra layer of oreos.

Made this for dessert for my parents (very small,casual)anniversary party. Used devil's food pudding mix w/3cups of milk as suggested by another reviewer and I used the two full packages of cream cheese and didn't find it too tangy at all. Brought the leftovers (makes aLOT) to work next day and everyone loved it! Will try making w/FF ingredients next time.

I've used a very similar recipe for years, but I don't make this cake in layers; I blend together the pudding, whipped topping, cream cheese mixture, and half the crushed oreos, leaving out the butter entirely.  It makes a luscious "Dirt Cake" for potlucks and picnics!

I have made this cake numerous times and it is fantastic! I use vanilla puding, light cream cheese, light cool whip and I put chocolate chips instead of cookies on top. Men, women or kids, everybody loves it.

I made this cake for my husbands birthday and it was a big hit!  Everyone really loved it.  I followed some of the suggestions of others and reduced the cream cheese to 1 1/2 boxes and substituted with chocolate pudding.  I used all light/fat-free products and it still tasted excellent!!  Thanks Pam

Growing up, I always knew this recipe as Dirt Cake. Either way, it is the BEST! I took it to work for Food Day and it was very well received. People were saying they felt sick because they ate too much :) Haha. I used a *little* less cream cheese than the recipe called for. Next time I might experiment with different flavors of pudding such as chocolate or Oreo. But, this recipe is absolutely perfect as is!

This ended up pretty good, but I found a few problems with it. First there was no way the amount of cookie would cover the bottom of a 9x13 pan, so I used an 8x11 and it barley covered, but then the cream cheese mixture ended up being too thick. Next time I will put less cream cheese as I thought there was too much. Otherwise I did enjoy it.

I made this cake and left it with a friend who said the cake tasted much better after sitting in the fridge over night.

Richer than I expected and not that great.The recipe calls for too much cream cheese for my tastes, making the recipe too tangy. If I made this again I would cut the cream cheese in half at least.

Love this but only with CHOCOLATE pudding!  This is awesome, especially for summertime potlucks! Be sure that this stays VERY cold. Love this! Not for the folks watching their sugar intake!

Woah nelly!  I was hoping to find "the oreo dessert" that is always present at potlucks.  This is it!  I served it slightly frozen on accident (didn't take it out soon enough), but everyone adored it!  It was kinda like an ice cream cake.  So this one is good thawed or slightly frozen!  Very easy to make and disappears just as quickly...especially when 12 college students are around.

I take this treat everywhere! Quick & Easy - No baking. I've tried it with the mint oreos as well and it is great. Plan on trying it with White Chocolate pudding next!
Enjoy!

The first time I made this I couldn't believe how easy it was to make this.  So I immediately made two and gave the other one to my friend who went crazy over it.  This cake is best made with quality whipped cream and cookies because it makes all the difference.

The only thing I don't like about this recipe is that it doesn't taste too good the day after.  So make sure you eat it up in one day!

This is a really good recipe. The only thing that needs changing is going from vanilla to chocolate pudding. The kids beg to have me fix this. They would rather have the chocolate pudding though.

This was great!  It is a great dessert that is easy to make.  The vanilla pudding gives a great twist on the oreos and whipped cream.  I highly recommend it for any party.

This was a super easy a surprisingly good dessert! But you have to consider the ingredients: this is RICH! And a little tricky, if you just try to throw it all together quickly. Advice: let the coolwhip & cream cheese come to room temperature! Otherwise, you’ll end up with “chunks” of cream cheese. (Even mixing extensively with the Kitchen Aid!) I also suggest refrigerating before topping the pudding layer w/ the remaining coolwhip- it will hold form much better! I ended up using more than just 1 cup of the crushed cookies for the topping, so I purposely bought an extra package- also to decorate with. It is worth it! And was a HUGE hit at the office! Like an ice cream sundae but no need to keep frozen. Great, easy dessert to serve a crowd- a little portion goes a LONG way!

This is an extremely easy and delicious dessert! It is rather rich, but if you like cheesecake especially, I'd bet that you'll love this dessert. I know that a lot of people complain about the cream cheese being too tangy in the filling, but my theory is that they removed the filling of the Oreos and just used the cookie. With the Oreo filling in, the cream cheese isn't horribly tangy at ALL. It was also really nice that this was such a simple dessert to make, and doesn't take up too much time, either. Perfect for a large gathering or potluck!

Excellent.  I actually only had one 16 ounce container of cool whip,  so I used that.  When I make this again I will use two, more for appearance than taste. The dish held together just fine without top layer of cool whip.  I also used chocolate pudding instead of vanilla.  VERY Nice and Tasty Dessert!!

Guess I'm one of the few that like it with vanilla pudding, just a personal preference to go along with the oreos.  Either flavor, people love this.  I also make it with heavy whipped cream rather than cool whip.  I think that 1/2 the amount of powdered sugar with the cream cheese is sweet enough.  Again, my choice.  No matter what you choose it's delicious and a favorite among family/friends.

I made this as the recipe states and just love it!  my pants won't tomorrow but who cares!  It is a special occassion recipe and created for us to endulge!  
I felt like it was missing something, maybe a hint of mint in the pudding?  maybe more pudding...I think I will double the pudding next time.  Now to share this with a bunch of teenage girls...I think it will be a hit!

i really like this recipe but I only had cheesecake pudding and I did not have a pie pan. I decided I would make mini cheesecakes in a cupcake pan. I also divided the oreos and I used the halves with the cream as the crust and the other halves I crushed up and put in the pudding and cheesecake batter.

Wonderful! I've had and made many desserts similar to this one, but the Oreo spin just puts this over the top.  I tried this because my son absolutely loves Oreos and he had a bad week so I wanted to give him a little surprise.  We made pigs of ourselves! I followed recipe to a tee and had no problems serving it.  Next time I'll try the chocolate pudding version.

the flavors in this do not seem to stand out at all. the only real flavor you pick  is the cream cheese layer, which was ok to me becuse i like the tanginess of it.

I have had this with both vanilla and chocolate pudding and would say taste wise it doesn't make much of a difference! I do like the presentation with chocolate pudding better. I have not found it necessary to ground up the oreos, in fact I just crush them with my hand and you have big yummy pieces that still form a crust just fine! Mmmm Mmmmm delicious!

This recipe is wonderful. I made it for my boyfriends family and it went so quick. Now they are asking me for more. The only thing I changed was to not chop the top oreo as fine as the oreos you use for the crust. Thanks! :)

This was well recieved by my family, but it wasn't spectacular.  I made mine in a round spring form and only used one 8 oz pkg of cream cheese, and it was plenty.  I also used chocolate pudding instead of vanilla.  This is definately more of a pie, and reminded me a lot of the sex in a pan dessert my mom makes, only with chocolate crust.

This is more like pudding, rather than "cake", but it was gobbled up immediately.  I used chocolate pudding.  Definitely a keeper.

Very yummy!  I first had this at a BBQ one summer and have been looking for a recipe since.  I use chocolate pudding instead of vanilla and it isn't too rich.  My only word of caution is that because you need to make and refrigerate each layer separately, it can take a while to make.  I wasn't prepared the first time I made it!  Definitely a keeper =)

im 16 and i was looking for something new to try so i decided to make this because it sounded interesting. i made it just tonight and it was really good! the only change i made in the recipe was with the cream cheese i used only one and a half of the recommended two bars. it still came out great and my mom loved it! Definately one to make again. =]

My grandma has been making this for years and I love it.  However my grandma does it a little different.  She mixes everything together instead of layering it and it really tastes great that way too.  I would definitely use this recipe again.

i made 1/2 the recipe & only used 1/2 a bar of cream cheese & 1 box of french van pudding; also mixed the cream cheese/pudding together. i also added some choc syrup to the pudding & drizzled it on top of the whipped cream.a simple easy recipe when you don't want to fuss over stove.

This recipe came out good, I too cut the cream cheese in half. I'm glad I did, I think the amount of cream cheese called for in the recipe would have been too much! My children loved it and the adults like it too. It's the perfect summer/spring dessert. And, it's very easy to make.

This is a Thanksgiving tradition in our house.  My Step-Mom made it and it was a HUGE hit and then became a tradition.  The only difference is we use Choc. pudding.  Yummy!

This is an instant hit with all of my friends and family.  I got inventive and tried different cookie crusts and pudding combinations, but the original is always the favorite.  This is perfect for the Oreo connoisseur!

Wow!  This was too good!  I happened to have some oreos already crushed from another treat earlier this week and I wasn't sure how I would use them.  I had to cut the recipe in half but I still used the whole package of vanilla pudding.  Awesome!

This is an AWSOME, easy recipe! Who doesn't love oreos? After reading the reviews, I decided to incorporate fudge on the crust and throughout rather than replacing the vanilla pudding with chocolate. Mmmmm Hmmmm. It was fabulous :-)

A friend of mine got this recipe off the website and gave it to me to try.  I used chocolate pudding instead of vanilla.  It is soooooo good. My family asks for me to make it whenever I can.  I think adding some mint extract or even Kahula, Amaretto, or Bailey's for the grown ups would be a yummy addition to the pudding.

This was pretty good.  I wasn't overly impressed.  Honestly, it just tastes like oreos and whipped cream.  Seems to be missing a special something.  I used oreo instant pudding, maybe it needs a layer of chocolate instead.

Tasted even better the next day.

I made this for my boyfriend who loves oreos and wanted a dessert different from oreo cheesecake. I decided to go for this one because all the ingredients sounded delish together and it was so easy to make i whipped it up in 15 minutes. When he tasted it he said it was just like his mom's pudding pie but with oreos not a bad thing at all but I don't know the oreo CAKE part made me think it would be more solid for some reason. It really was amazing but don't think you're going to be able to cut it in perfect slices to serve...unless you freeze it.

This is a great recipe. Everyone loves it when I bring it to a party. The only changes that I make are to put all the Oreo cookies, except 5 or 6, in the food processor. This makes a really good crust, it reminds me of the Friendly's Oreo cake. I also use white chocolate pudding or Oreo pudding when I can get it. I crush the left over cookies and put them on top.

I agree with one of reviews that I have read.  This wasn't the most greatest recipe considering I have tasted better.  It was kind of on the runny side when you actually served it. Instead of layering the whipped topping and the pudding I found it alot better when you mixed the 2 together and added cookies in the mixture.  I haven't quite found a recipe that is as good as the ones at potluck but i'm sure I'll find one.  oh yeah!  it also helps if the cream cheese is soften before you mix it.

Instead of crushing the oreos to bite size pieces, I would crush them till they are grain like.  Also, be careful about using too much cool whip.  I was hoping this would be more of a cheese cake, but in a 9x13 pan, the cream cheese mixture is thin.

Not much flavor. Maybe I needed to add more 
oreos to the bottom crust. Tasted like oreos and
coolwhip. Exactly how much in crumbs are 8 oz of oreo cookies supposed to make.
I found recipe expensive and artificial tasting. My kids loved it, but I would just as 
soon eat the oreos with a big glass of milk!

Recipe needs to be corrected. It has Vanilla pudding when it's supposed to be Chocolate pudding. I have made this recipe several times having got it from a restaurant. Also if you look at the pic they provide you can clearly see the layer of chocolate pudding.

Just made this for the third time. One change that I suggest is adding another four or five cookies to the one cup of crushed cookies/butter mix. Then put all of that into a food processor to really crumble them up so that they spread nicely and evenly over the top of the cake. Delicious recipe! My kids LOVE it!

This was an expensive recipe to make.   Keep in mind Oreos do not come in a 20 oz package, so you'll end up buying more ingredients than you need.  I reduced the amount of cream cheese as suggested and swapped vanilla for chocolate pudding also as suggested.  
It also is a bit time consuming since each layer needs time to set in the freezer or fridge so plan accordingly.

I made this four times in four weeks - everyone loved it! I used two blocks of cream cheese as listed and would not do less.  I also used chocolate pudding every time.
Another option - I used one (8 oz) block of cream cheese and 1 cup of creamy peanut butter to make a chocolate-peanut butter  dessert - sooo good but very rich!  I also want to try the chocolate-peanut butter option with peanut butter Oreos sometime, but that might be pushing even my "too rich" levels...

Whoa. This dessert is rich. I did substitute chocolate for vanilla pudding and it was intense.  Followed the advice of another reviewer and poured melted butter over the cookie crust layer to save a dish. That worked great! If I make again would also follow advice to reduce cream cheese to 1.5 cups and use reduced fat version. Also would combine it with the full container of cool whip and skip the top cool whip layer, which seemed unnecessary.

Love this recipe. I have made it many times. It is good as is but we prefer chocolate pudding instead of the vanilla. Sometimes if we have extra coolwhip I will put a whole container on top as opposed to the 1/2 that is left. I give the original recipe 5 stars.

Made as recipe is written, it was good, but missing something.  Maybe some vanilla next time & I would definitely crush the cookie layer for the bottom.

I've made this before and followed the recipe exactly as stated. It turned out good and the family loved it. I made it today but used chocolate pudding instead of vanilla to satisfy the chocolate lovers in the family! This is a nice cool dessert for the warmer months and easy to make. This is a keeper!

I have made this five times and it's a hit every time! My only substitution was to use  Glutino sandwich cookies instead of Oreos since I am gluten free. Nobody knew the difference.

The recipe as written is okay. I wouldn't make it again like this. If I made it again, I would only use one box of cream cheese and I would use chocolate pudding instead of vanilla. These are just personal preferences.

Loved  this as a kid. Few important changes. My mom used chocolate pudding (two small boxes mixed with ONLY three cups of milk). That added to the chocolate flavor, and made it thicker and a bit firmer (the pie filling consistency) and gave the layers a better striped appearance (black, white, black, white). It was one of the first things I made and experimented with as a teenager- making a nutter butter crust at times, adding a bit of peanut butter to the cream cheese layer, and some chopped peanuts on top instead of the cookies (I really liked that version). It's a great recipe for a young person to put together and use their imagination. I was so proud of myself. (I have a food processor now, but remember crushing the cookies in a bag). We only saved 1/2 cup of crumbs for the top (making crust thicker) and carefully sprinkled them evenly on. I thought it was very pretty with all the white showing through. 20 years later after making more sophisticated desserts for years I wonderd how I would feel about this, with the sweetness of the Oreos and the cool whip and the chocolate pudding (all items I tend to avoid because of the super processed flavor). I definitely think for this reason the full two packages of cream cheese are needed to cut the overwhelming sweetness. I still liked it. It cut like a dream after a day in the fridge. We had perfect, firm, square, stripes of deliciousness. The way we made it, with the two small packages of pudding, it's easy to halve.

I have made this many, many times as written and just got around to reviewing it. This is always a hit at home and parties. My family prefers chocolate pudding instead of the vanilla, and only one brick of cream cheese so the mixture if fluffier,but the recipe itself is perfect either way. No changes needed!

I enjoyed this as a kid with chocolate pudding so I switched out the vanilla pudding with chocolate which was great as usual. My bottom crust layer didn't turn out and I think I would've been better off just sprinkling cookies in bottom minus the butter.

I crumbled the Oreo cookies in with the cream cheese and whipped cream blended it up and it gave it a chocolate look and Instead of using 2 packages of cream cheese I used 1 and a half  and i omitted the pudding and it was perfect I love this recipe because I love oreo's. I recommend trying to blend the cookies in the mix without the pudding.

I used half chocolate sandwich cookies and half vanilla sandwich cookies for the crust.  I also used vanilla pudding mix instead of chocolate.  This recipe is awesome and everyone always loves it!

I like sweet things but WOW this is super sweet! The only change I made was to use chocolate pudding. Next time to cut the sweetness I think I will omit the conf. sugar and probably all cream cheese and replace that with just cool whip, maybe whip it up with some pudding to make more of a mousse type thing. Its good though as us, just super duper sweet.

Just make sure cream cheese is room temperature. Also, I might use a smaller pan because I felt some of the layers were spread a bit too thin for me.

Made this for a party at my place and also for my brothers work potluck. Got highly complimented each time, in fact my brother said his coworkers were mock fighting over the last bit. He had me make it for a second potluck, too. I add a package of chocolate instant pudding, then add half a carton of cool whip to both chocolate and vanilla to make it more mousse like. Makes pretty layers in a trifle bowl.

I used real whipped cream and served this as a birthday cake. It was a big success! I froze it for a while and sent the leftovers home later with the honoree. All were surprised at how good it was.

Very delicious... I made my own whipped cream and used Oreo cookie instant pudding instead of vanilla. I also put it in a trifle dish and would not do that again... very pretty but hard to get a serving :) definitely use the 9x13! This is totally worth making again!!

I made this before my family flew out to see us for Christmas. I should've made more! They went to town on it. I had my grandma and my mama asking for the recipie. I should've read the comment on the cream cheese because it was a little much. But I still loved it, and so did everyone else!

This is so great if you don't have a ton of time to get creative for a dessert dish. And even though it's got pretty usual ingredients, that won't hold back the amount of rave reviews you'll get. I made it once for the office and I had people asking to make it again, and people asking for the recipe. As I am sure it has been mentioned, you can have fun and tweak it with different flavored/colored oreos as well as different flavors of pudding. Have fun!

So I love my take on this recipe. I DO NOT USE THE VANILLA PUDDING! To me it offsets the cream cookie taste. I either use cheesecake pudding or the Oreo cheesecake pudding that jell-o sells. My family absolutely requires that I make it for every family function.

I made this for dessert and my Mom said this was the best dessert I have ever made (and I make a lot of desserts). It was quite easy and simple to make and I liked the fact it did not require the stove or oven. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it was a little too much for me. I will definitely make this again.

This was a family favorite growing up (my gram's recipe) in place of 1/3 of the vanilla pudding use chocolate pudding. If you wanna cut back on the butter use the cream from the cookies you have set aside for the garnishing. I didn't use extra sugar growing up but either way works. This dessert is thick and sweet, don't try to eat as much as you would regular cake or pie; you'll pop! I personally prefer slightly less cream cheese, if you use the cheese on bagels in the morning the left overs and a stick is perfect. This is always a hit, not for diabetics or chocolate haters tho. Thank you for posting this I had forgotten about it; many childhood memories.

This was delicious!! I followed the suggestion to use only 1 packet of cream cheese and because I'm a cheesecake lover, I regretted it. It just ended up being an overwhelming amount of whipped cream and I wanted to taste more of the cream cheese. However, it was still very good, next time, I plan on using 1.5 packets or maybe even all 2. I also used chocolate pudding instead of vanilla. The more days that passed, the better it tasted each day. It is very rich and full of empty calories so I would only make once in a while

This is a GREAT recipe! Super easy, and tastes wonderful. This is my son's favorite; anytime we have a family get-together this is his request. I actualy do chocolate AND vanilla pudding in that layer but everything else remains the same!

I made this for my daughter's birthday and everyone raved about it. Comments were "heavenly", "not too rich" and "if I could have food taste like one thing the rest of my life I would pick that"! I doubled the pudding like other's suggested and used chocolate fudge pudding. Definitely a new family favorite!!

Just made this for my husbands 46th birthday...with our twin 3 year old daughters help.  They loved tasting each of the layers, and even my picky twin wanted more than a taste of each one!  My husbands mother used to make something similar to this for his birthday each year when he was growing up (a long time ago he told me that it was his all time favorite desert), so this year I found Pams recipe and decided to give it a try.  YUMMO.  The twins can't wait to have a piece of the finished cake...just waiting for Daddy to get home from work!

I took other suggestions and used 8 ounces of cream cheese & devils food pudding. Everyone loved it! I had to make another batch the next day, and my hubby bought the oreo flavored instant pudding cups instead of the box. All I needed was 3 cups & it turned out great!

Super easy to make. Very good but not too heavy! Great summer dessert! I used 2 packs of ores for a thicker crust! 1 1/2 packs for the crust 1/2 pack for the topping! Make sure you soften the cream cheese! Great recipe!!!!

Followed instructions exactly and it was delicious!!  I didn't think it was tangy at all either, I guess to each his own.  The only problem I had was that the bottom crust was a tad to salty.  I made this last October and am making it for another friend's bday this weekend (she requested it) So I am going to try it with unsalted butter this time around

i made this for a summer cook out and it was a BIG hit. I read all the reviews prior to see about any variations and i did use devils food cake instant pudding vs. vanilla. Any chocolate would work. AND i added the oreo white chocolate bar crumbled on top w/ crushed oreos for a nice mix of texture. I didn't cut down the cream cheese as some people recommended and i am glad...it would have been too sweet, the cream cheese is PERFECT and adds a nice consistency to the dessert layer.

My son and I made this "cake" for Father's Day and the family loved it! It was  light and fluffy and not too sweet and I will be making it again, probably for the Fourth!  I only used 1.5 packages of Neufchatal cheese and chocolate fudge pudding mix and it was wonderful. Be sure to use unsalted butter in the crust or it may be salty.  Thank you for a fun dessert.

This dessert was a hit at a party I went to!....There were two  chef's that work in fine dining restaraunts here in Atlanta that tried it and LOVED it!!! I skimped on the cream cheese by half and doubled the amount of pudding I used...don't skimp on the butter either and it will help with the crust!

I loved this so much I made it over 5 times. But I only use 1 pack of cream cheese, if you go with 2 it will be a bit sour.

Delicious and so easy to make! I went with light, low fat and sugar-free when possible and love that it didn't turn out tasting like a diet dessert. Follwed some of the previous advice and used chocolate pudding instead of vanilla. The consistency of the cake is more like a pudding or mousse and doesn't slice well. I gave up trying to slice and switched to a serving spoon. The crust was a little too rich for my taste, so I may try a chocolate graham cracker crust the next time around. All in all, it was a hit and I will definately make this again. =0)

Good and easy recipe. Although I thought that there was too much of the cream cheese, half the amount would be quite enough. Using chocolate instead of vanilla pudding would be another change that might make this dessert closer to perfect. Overall, anyway, it was nice and easy!

The two things I changed was using chocolate pudding & a teaspoon of vanilla into cream cheese mix. I'm not sure what I did wrong, but cake was still soft after I froze final product for some time. It didn't cut nicely as I hoped but people still ate it up.

Absolutely loved this recipe. Made a few changes though. First i used real whipping cream instead of cool whip because i am not a fan of the artificial taste. Second i put whipping cream in the pudding to give it more of a solid flavor. Third i reduced the cream cheese amount by a quarter due to past reviews i've read. Finally 4th i used margerine instead of butter for the crust. And 5th i cut the powered sugar amount down a bit. Other than that i followed the recipe for the most part. It turned out great. Was after a semi-sweet dessert and this truly delivered. Thank you !!!

my family loved this recipe!  i am giving it only 4 stars because i thought it was pretty bland.  i used chocolate pudding instead of vanilla.  i cant believe it would be that good with vanilla - just my opinion.  since there is so much whip cream in it and whip cream is kinda tasteless....i think that's why i found this recipe bland.  but on the other hand, it is addictive - strange.  the pudding layer is thin so next time i will probably try doubling that layer - either that or halving the cream cheese layer.  very easy to make and definitely worth at least 1 try!

I'll try it with chocolate pudding next time.  It should specify that the pudding needs to be prepared and cool before pouring it ontop of the cool whip mixture!  I fumbled the first attempt b/c of doing that.

(ABH)Another Big Hit!! I made this one again using the Slenda for baking and sugar free OREO's. This was the absolute best dessert especially when you freeze it. It's like an Ice Cream Cake w/o the Ice Cream.

Only 1 container of cream cheese and chocolate instead of vanilla made this dish fabulous the second time around! It was tangy for us as well the first time, and the vanilla pudding tasted a bit strange to me. SO filling but SO good!

If you are looking for an easy (and beautiful) recipe to take to a party or to the office. LOOK NO FURTHER. This is a gorgeous dessert, easily presented and absolutely delicious. I used lo-fat chocolate pudding and 1/3 less fat cream cheese, and it was still so flavorful and disappeared from everyone's plates! A MUST for Oreo lovers!

I'm such a dessert snob and almost didn't try this because of the cool Whip and instant pudding, but my son picked this recipe out for his birthday so I made it anyway.  Holy cow was it fantastic!!! First of all, it's about a million times better the next day, so try to make it ahead if you can.  I only used one stick of cream cheese and forgot the sugar (talking on the phone while cooking--bad idea!) but it was marvelous anyway.  It isn't much to look at, but your friends won't care once they taste it.

This was really good. I followed the suggestion of another and used half of the cream cheese called for. I also crushed up the oreos to crumbs instead of chunks. The flavor was awesome!!

This recipe was excellent and easy to make. As some others suggested, I used only one pack of cream cheese (reduced fat)which was plenty.

This recipe was so yummy! I made it for Mother's Day and my family raved about it, then I took it to Mom's group and they raved about it. I followed suggestions from other reviews - used 1 box cream cheese (instead of 2), 2 boxes chocolate pudding (instead of vanilla), 3 cups milk, and added 1 tablespoon vanilla.

While this recipe was good, it was too heavy for my taste. I usually love Oreo based whipped dessert, but this just made me feel so full after eating. Maybe if I adjusted the amounts of cream cheese and pudding it would work better.

Great Recipe! I also used chocolate pudding, but next time I would use about half as much so it doesn't overpower the cheesecake taste. Otherwise very good!

YUMMY!  I also know this as "Kansas" Dirt cake.  My husband made it for me for my birthday.  We were just thinking it would probably be really good frozen also!  He had fun making it.

I made this recipe for my husband for his birthday and it turned out excellent.  I used light cream cheese, 25% reduced fat oreo cookies and skim milk to reduce the fat content.  Very good, my husnbad asked when I would make it again.
Thank you.

You can try different pudding mixes.  We love Pistachio Instant Pudding the best.  The contrasting colors are great, especially for Christmas, St. Patty's Day, etc.  The only change I made was using only 1/2 cup of crushed oreos on top of the Cool Whip, instead of one cup as suggested by this recipe.  My children and 7-year-old niece ask for this in lieu of a birthday cake every year!

Awesome recipe! I made this for my boyfriend's co-workers, who called it "out of this world". I am a rather inexperienced cook/baker, so that says a lot. Very easy to make. I, like others, used chocolate pudding, and it turned out great. Thank you!

Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful!  This was a big hit with the family and at a potluck picnic. One change though, I did a layer of chocolate and a layer of vanilla pudding. I may try 2 boxes banana pudding next time.  Yes, there will be a next time.  :-)

I thought the pudding and the top whipped topping layers would make this dessert too rich, but I was wrong. It came out perfect. I used margarine instead of butter and it was still wonderful. Next time I will try skipping the butter in the cookies altogether to cut down on calories/fat.

This is a very nice cool and creamy dessert.  My husband, toddler son and I all enjoyed it very much.  I even made it with low fat ingredients except for the butter in the crust. I bet it would be great with chocolate pudding, but my husband declared it perfect with the vanilla.  Thanks for a new family favorite.

The cake was very quick and easy to make
and the ingrediants were not hard to find.
However, I thought the cake had to many
man made products in it.(not very healthy or 
natural)

My family usually does not like to eat anything with cream cheese in it.  HOWEVER, they all agreed that this was the best refrigerator dessert that I have made.  It is light, tasty and looks pretty.
