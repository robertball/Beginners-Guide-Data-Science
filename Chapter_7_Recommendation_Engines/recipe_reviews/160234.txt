This recipe is easily adaptable as a slow cooker meal:  I used 2 lbs of blade steak, cut into 1-inch cubes, which I browned first. I used fresh ginger (1 tbsp, minced) instead of ground, sliced up a carrot, and cleaned 6 pearl onions that I had on hand. Toss everything into the slow cooker except for the peppers and rice, and set it on High for 2.5 hrs. Turn the setting down to Low, and add the cut-up peppers to the pot (I used 2 green and 2 yellow for colour).  Cook your rice separately, and once that's done, your meal is ready ! The meat was moist and tender, and I got the "thumbs up" from everyone.

The only thing I'd do differently next time is marinade the meat before hand so it's not so tough.  Great Flavor!

this had a very good flavor nd is very easy to make. My husband and I both felt is was a little too salty though. To be fair thought, instead of beef consomme, I used beef base, so thks may have contributed to that. I alos used only half the soy sauce as well. I served this with rice and broccoli.

Very yummy.  I dredged my steak in flour & a little meat tenderizer & pepper before frying it in the oil.  Also made more sauce by adding water to consomme and a little extra soy sauce (to taste).  It was a big hit for my picky eaters.  The meat became tender the longer I simmered it on the stovetop so be sure to leave time for it to simmer that 20 minutes or more while your rice is cooking.  I may wait until a little later to add my peppers next time so they will be a little crispier.  Will make this again - would even be a great meal for guests.  Yum!

Family loved it.  I used low sodium soup and reduced sodium soy sauce, so did not have the problem of it being too salty.  Only used about 1/2 c yellow bell pepper because family does not like it much.  I used about 1 1/2 teaspoon of ginger also.

Awesome dish! Try it with yellow, red, and green peppers for color and taste. We also added a litle more ginger than recommended. We will surely make this again! Thanks!

Just what I was looking for, easy and so good over rice.  I made this in the slow cooker.  I didn't have tomato soup but had a can of fire roasted tomatoes in its place.  I put together the soy sauce, beef broth, and tomatoes and used my hand blender on them to get rid of tomato chunks for a smoother sauce.  Used fresh ginger and garlic.  I added onion and mushrooms, along with the peppers and dropped the meat (dredged in cornstarch) in after frying so I didn't have issues about thickening it in the crockpot. Perfect.  Thanks for such an easy and adaptable recipe.

This is definitely a 5 STAR recipe! Hubby and I loved it! Made a few slight modifications though. I used 2 red bell peppers and 2 green bell peppers, but I think one could get by adding just 3 large peppers (perhaps 1-red, 1-yellow, and 1-green). I also used a low sodium soy sauce, and since I didn't have exactly 2 tablespoons of cornstarch... I used 1 tablespoon of cornstarch and 1 tablespoon of flour (which worked well), I added a bit more ginger (also added an 1/8 tsp.), and instead of adding all garlic salt, I added an 1/8 teaspoon of garlic salt, and an 1/8 teaspoon of garlic powder. I didn't need to sear the meat for 10 minutes, mine was cooked within 6 minutes. I also added a 1/4 teaspoon of dried red pepper flakes, to make this dish a bit more flavorable. I wanted to point out, after I trimmed up my 2 lbs. of round steak, I ended up with about 1 lb. plus 10-12 oz. of meat. I found this made 5 servings rather than 8. Served this one night with instant white rice, and the leftovers another night with instant brown rice. I look forward to making this dish again; as it was exceptionally good!! TUNA'S MOM, thanks for posting this recipe. This recipe is definitely a keeper!!

Okay this dish was delicious and easy to prepare. I did make the following changes. #1 Using fresh grated  ginger instead of the powder, 1 8oz tomato paste instead of the soup, a mixture of sliced peppers and onions ( red and yellow ) and I marinated the steak for several hours.  The marinate consisted of olive oil, crushed fresh garlic, freshly grated ginger and salt and pepper. I vacuumed sealed the steak and placed in the refrigerator until I was ready to cook ( about 7 hours ) I cooked the steak first, then sliced after letting the steak rest for a few min. While the steak was resting, I sauteed the peppers and onions, then added the steak ( sliced ) and the sauce. Served over basmati rice.

Great recipe. Used tomato sauce rather than tomato soup,doubled the ginger, halved the sugar, substituted snow peas for 2 of the bell peppers. Also added one medium onion. Family liked it as much as take-out!

Followed the recipe almost exactly.  Only used 2 peppers, 1 green, 1 red and that was plenty.  Also sautéed an onion with the meat.  My only complaint is the meat takes way longer to get tender, more like 3.5 hours.  If you have the time, this dish would be better done in the crockpot.

A recipe my hubby actually said "you can make this one again".   Usually he has suggestions on how he would have changed the recipe.    The only changes I made was to use fresh garlic and fresh ginger.   I keep those tubes in the fridge since we use a lot of garlic and ginger.    I make an Asian inspired meal once a week.

just tried this recipe. Used meat tenderizer before browning the steak. Used yellow red and green peppers, flour instead of cornstarch and skipped the ginger.  It was AWESOME.  Gonna make this many more times.  Everyone loved it!

This dish is absolutely amazing! It is very simple and easy to modify.(FYI- I did not use the recommended amount of soy sauce or I believe it might have been too salty so I poured to taste)  If you do not have time or the money to buy fresh meat for this recipe a good alternative is to buy John Soules beef fajita strips. They are lightly seasoned and will not alter the flavor of this recipe. Since they are already cooked I was able to skip step 1 and move right into step 2. Another thing I did was used part green peppers and part red peppers since there is a difference in flavor between the two and that made it taste wonderful while adding a little bit of color to the dish. I would definitely recommend trying this 
recipe since it is great as well as simple!

Men in family are not big on rice and I don’t like tomato soup. So I used can of diced fire roast tomatoes instead. We also used red, green, yellow and an orange pepper instead of just for green. Made for a very bright tasty dish. The little bit of left overs we added some onion I needed to use up and some five spice, still tasty.

I rarely choose recipes calling for canned soup, but I'm glad I tried this one. It was good and simple enough to make.  Instead of soy sauce, I used Bragg's Amino Acids because it is said to be healthier. 

I will use low salt soup next time because the dish was too salty for our liking, even though I didn't add any salt.

Made the recipe as written except for using low sodium soy sauce.  Family really liked it.  Next time, though,  I will marinade the meat first to make it a little more tender.  It's a keeper!

I read reviews and adopted some of the suggestions. I didn't have tomato soup so I used a can of diced tomatoes instead. I also used yellow, orange and red peppers instead of green, because that's what I had.  I also used fresh ginger and garlic instead of dried. The steak was a little over a pound but I made the recipe as written (as though for 2 pounds of steak). 
I added a whole yellow onion sliced. I sauteed the onions and sweet peppers first, then put into the tomato and beef base. Then I sauteed the minced garlic and ginger till fragrant; about 1 minute. I added that to the mixture. 
I also like the sauce a little thicker, so I ended up using 4 T of corn starch to get to my desired thickness. I didn't use the sugar because I am sugar free. It wasn't missed. 
This was the best pepper steak I've ever made. I attribute it to yellow, orange, and red peppers instead of green, and the rich beefy, tomato-y base. I'm making it like this from now on.

The meat was a bit tough with only that amount of cooking.  The flavors were good.  I didn't have beef consume so I used water with some beef onion soup mix.  I also cooked the peppers and onions for about 5 minutes before adding the liquid because I like them to be soft.

My family loved it and requested we have it again.  I used less soy sauce and crushed garlic instead of garlic salt to cut back on the sodium.  Forgot to add the sugar.  I used an electric pressure cooker to sear the meat and after adding all the other ingredients put it on slow cook while I went out to a meeting.  Slightly thickened the gravy before serving.  We served it with rice pilaf a couple of ours later and it was delicious.  Oh,  used cube steak cut into strips since that is what I had on hand.

I felt like this recipe had too much tomato flavor and the cooking time was way off. I needed 10 minutes cooking time.

I found it to be pretty bland.  Maybe a little cayenne would help.  I won't be making this again.

Made this tonight for myself and my roommates - thumbs up all around. The sauce was a little thick, but I also let it simmer a few extra minutes. I used top round and a couple of sirloins - couldn't tell the difference after the meats had soaked up the sauce.

I think this recipe is 5 stars as is. Only changes I made was to season the meat before cooking and I added onions with the peppers and cooked a bit before adding the sauce. Flavorful, easy recipe.

Everything was great.  I used red, orange, and yellow peppers instead of green and brought the sauce to a simmer before adding them.  You could add them even later if you like a crunch to the peppers.  It is a bit salty because of the condensed soups and soy sauce, so I might try adding a bit more sugar to counterbalance it.  Overall, mmmmm...
