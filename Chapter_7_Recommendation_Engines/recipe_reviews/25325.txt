Having made this a few times now, I've taken to placing the sandwich with the vegetables under the broiler for a minute or two before adding the dressing and cheese because usually the cheese will melt long before the veggies warm up. This is absolutely the best vegetable sandwich out there.

Forgot to toast the English Muffins first and used store-bought taco-blend shredded cheese instead of smoked, but still came out great. Looking over the ingredients, I thought the cheese would be a pronounced flavor, but wasn't...in fact none of the ingredients took center statge...they all seemed to mingle together to create a unique combination of flavors and textures...well done, and easier to make than I anticipated!

This was awesome.  The sprouts I think are optional.  If you choose to use onions, use the sweeter white or yellow.  Red might be a little overpowering combined with the vinegar and oil mixture.

I loved this sandwich! I used sunflower seeds instead of sesame seeds, and a heartier kind of bread. I think the ranch dressing is the key to the flavor.

Too bad that one of the three star ratings pulled this recipe down 1/2 star because it definitely didn't deserve it!
I made it with smoked gouda because it was all I had on hand and after the first sandwich, I sliced hard-boiled egg on the second.
Either way, the sandwich was great.  Thank you for sending it in.  I will definitely continue with this recipe!  Everyone at work loved it!

I made these on a whole wheat pita and liked it very much! The ranch dressing totally makes it and don't forget to salt and pepper the slice of tomato. Mmmmm! Will definitely make again.

I made these last year during lent and then forgot about them until the other day.  We loved this sandwich.  The Ranch dressing is a must!  We have made it with and without tomato and both ways this sandwich is good.  You can play with the cheese too!!  Thanks for the recipe.

Very good sandwich, and very adaptable to the ingredients you have on hand.  I made mine on a ciabatta roll with smoked mozzarella and mixed greens instead of sprouts.  I prepared it ahead of time and broiled it in the toaster oven at work.

We loved this sandwich!!  I realized too late into making them that I didn't have any Ranch so we used a Poppyseed dressing, and they were great!  Reheated nicely too.

This was decent, but needs something more. I made it exactly as specified other then I used a blend of sharp, mild and white cheddar instead of smoked. I liked the flavor but I wanted more - I almost think it needs something spicy to kick it up a little bit, but then again I like very bold flavors. I'll make it again but play around with other ingredients.

This is good but not great. I always feel kind of sickly after I eat this but my husband really likes them so I will continue to make every once in a while.

Out of all of the vegetarian meals we've eaten, this was the only one we didn't like.  None of us liked it and my daughter couldn't even finish hers.  We won't even try to alter it to make it okay.

This was allright. For what it is, it's quite flavorful. I've been trying to incorporate a veggie lunch / dinner into my weekly meal rotation lately. I like that this offered a variety of "good for you" veggies in a single serving, but even so, I feel this could stand to be improved upon. For one, I like Ranch dressing but feel that a T per sandwich is too overpowering. I personally don't think Ranch is the best match for this sandwich either, but I'll just say this is my personal opinion and leave it  at that. Second, there are way too many toppings to pile on a delicate English muffin half. Despite toasting mine first (in a toaster - it's waay easier this way), after adding all of the veggies called for, I ended up with a softer sandwich than I would have liked. I don't know about you, but I prefer my English muffins to have a little crunch. Now, the positive. :) The BEST part about this is the toasted sesame seed (you MUST toast to bring out the nutty flavor). You'll be missing out if you omit them. Finally, I have a suggestion. I didn't have a ripe avocado but did have spicy guacamole handy. This gave my sandwich a nice little flavor boost. The best part was serving some of it with tortilla 
chips on the side! :) Oh, and I subbed a cheddar blend (i.e. mild / sharp & white cheddar) for smoked cheddar and think this added a unique flavor as well. Whole grain muffins added a nutritional boost. Thanks for sharing your idea, Debbie! :-)

Wow!  This is a good sandwich!  Love the toasted sesame seed with this!  I had to use just plain cheddar and will definitely try with the smoked!  Thanks!

This was delicious! I laid the veggies out on garlic Naan bread however, and added sliced black olives.  It was fantastic, and I had half for lunch the next day!

The ranch was a little overpowering for me, although I thought I used less than I needed. I'd try again, but with only a tiny amount of ranch. Don't forget to toast those muffins! Thanks for the recipe!

Awesome...I truly enjoyed this quick snack.  However, I would go easy on the onions or eliminate altogether.  Thanks for the advice of heating before adding the sauce and cheese.

This is a very yummy veggie sandwich.  Not a fan of onions, so left those out, but otherwise followed the list of ingredients to a tee.  The smoked Cheddar really gives the sandwich that extra "mmmmmm" flavor.

I just tried this for the first time. It was a very nice surprise. I think the sprouts are optional. And I only ate 2 english muffins rather than four. This was a perfect portion and healthy delicious meal.

I didn't think this was anything special. It was a bit of work to get all of the ingredients piled on a little English muffin and then it was messy to eat since it was open-face. Not good enough to go to the trouble again.

It was ok, but I probably won't make it again.  I used bean sprouts instead of the alfafa sprouts.  It seems like this sandwich could use something more.

I modified this just a bit, but it was very good.  I used fresh mozzarella cheese and skipped the sprouts and sesame seeds.  Be sure to toast the English muffin first or the sandwich will be very soggy. Great recipe! ***UPDATE 6/13/09 I toasted the english muffins this time, I used the sesame seeds, added chopped mushrooms, and used smoked cheddar instead of mozzarella - - OMG, my husband ate 5 of them in one sitting.  His words: "These are the best vegetarian sandwiches I've ever eaten.

I've made this a couple times, and I have always left out the sprouts, just because I'm not a fan.  I also use whole wheat english muffins, to make it a bit healthier.  I also saute the onions a bit cuz they probably wouldn't cook enough for me 5 or so minutes under the broiler, and sometimes I add shredded chicken breast if I happen to have some left over.  Either way, this is a good sandwich.

These were really tasty, although the alfalfa sprouts makes them a bit tricky to eat (I will chop them up a little bit next time). I used regular extra-sharp Cheddar cheese as I couldn't find smoked. Thanks, Debbie!

I made this as a side dish for a chicken gnocchi soup, and it complemented the soup very well. I used french bread instead of English muffins, and mozzarella cheese. I'd make this again for entertaining, but not for myself.

I should have gone with my gut after reading the mixed reviews about using ranch on this sandwich.  I decided to just do the sandwich pretty much as written, but to me it just tasted like ranch dressing.  There were so many other good flavors on this sandwich that were totally wasted.  If I were to do it again, I would either put a tiny smear of ranch on it or leave it off entirely.  It wasn't a bad sandwich, but certainly far from the "best" veggie sandwich.

I made this for lunch and it was really good! I didn't have any sprouts and I used whole wheat bread rather than english muffins. I also used light ranch and low fat cheese to cut down on the calories. I took away a star because I think there was too much ranch. Also remember to salt and pepper the tomato. Overall great recipe!

I really liked this and so did my husband,mydaughter - not so much. I used whole wheat English muffins and left the sprouts off because I thought they would get soggy. Used homemade ranch dressing, and followed the rest of the recipe. I will make this again when my daughter isn't hoe for dinner. Thanks!

This is a delicious sandwich; a great vegetarian option for lunch. I used a cheddar/jack blend because its all I had in the fridge, and I put the sprouts on after melting the cheese under the broiler (watch carefully or it will burn).  Enjoyed every bite, will make again. Thanks for sharing!

I just sprouted my first ever alfalfa sprouts.  I needed a good healthy light sandwich.  This is it.  I used vegan ranch dressing, and topped with dayia cheddar cheese.  So good.

I made these one night just for myself since the husband was working. I used ciabatta bread, green onions, regular cheddar cheese, and didn't have any alfalfa sprouts,so put a little fresh cilantro on top once done. Was a delicious sandwich, you don't even need very much dressing.

This was sooo good, but I did use guacomoli instead of avacado.  I also used gluten free englis muffins.  I could hardly get them on the platter before they were being taken off.  I brought these to a baby shower.  Looking for a way to do these bite size... but a super super hit.  highly recommended.

I love this recipe! It's soo delicious!I did not use the onion or the alfalfa sprouts only because I didn't have the sprouts on hand.  I did use lettuce though and added broccoli. used less cheese. It was great, Thank you for this recipe I will be using again! Next time without any changes

I grew up eating a version of this... We would layer english muffin, mashed avocado, sliced tomato, sliced mushrooms, sprouts, and thick slice of sharp cheddar cheese on top.  You also have to salt & pepper before broiling or toasting.  These are really good, and you must add the mushrooms because they add a special flavor (I'm not usually a big fan of them either).  The ranch dressing isn't necessary to make this sandwich delicious, the other flavors are perfect.

Excellent idea for a Meat free meal! Would work with any type of buns or bread. I tossed some fresh cilantro in there and omitted the sesame seeds and it was marvelous. I like that it goes in the oven like a melt, yum, Thanks

This made for an excellent lunch and as others have said this recipe is incredibly adaptable to what you have on hand.  I used Indian naan bread instead of English muffins; a thick hearty guacamole instead of avocado, onions and ranch dressing; broccoli sprouts instead of alfalfa and sharp finely shredded cheddar since I could find smoked cheddar.  Skipped the sesame seeds all together, however including them may added an additional texture to this open faced sandwich. Yummy!!

it's just as good as everyone says- and it was very quick to make.  there are 4 ingredients that need preparing, and 4 muffins that need to be toasted.  so i mashed the avocado while the first was toasting, chopped the tomato while the 2nd one was, chopped the onion while the third one was, and shredded cheese during the toasting of the 4th english muffin.  yum!

Good-bye Quiznos.... I've found something better!  I used smoked Gouda cheese which gave the sandwich a bacon flavor. I also used ciabatta bread.  I would eat this here or there, I would eat this anywhere. Thank you, thank you, Debbie Walter!

This was a really great blend of flavors!  I didn't have the sesame seeds, so I omitted them.  I also used a soft roll, rather than an english muffin.  To me, this is more of an open faced sandwich.  Next time I'll make it differently to make it easier to eat as a sandwich!

Even if you are not a vegetarian, this receipe is great.  I was surprise, I do not care for just vegetables on my sandwich, but I decided to go ahead and try because my sister is a vegetarian.  I would make it again.  The ranch dressing was a great idea.

I made this twice.  First time, just as the recipe called for, and made it  with regular onions. It was good, but better when I made a few changes.   The second time,  I used cut up green onions.  I also stirred a bit of garlic powder into the ranch dressing, which really sparked up the taste.  I also followed the advice of another reviewer and broiled the sandwich with only the vegetables for a few minutes, then topped it with the ranch, seeds and cheese for another 5 minutes.

So delish!  I made it exactly the way the recipe calls for and found it a little too soft.  I toasted the English muffin first as someone else recommended and it was much better.

This was a decent sandwich and didn't take long to make. I do think the cook time is way off (at least for my oven), as after a couple minutes under the broiler the cheese was starting to burn. The entire sandwich would be burnt if I let it cook for the recommended five minutes. Other than that, I'd probably decrease the dressing by half just for personal taste. I'd make it again.

My daughter turned vegetarian so it is challenging to find dishes that she likes. This one hit a home run. I was not able to find alfalfa sprouts so I sautéed some zucchini instead. The store didn't have smoked cheddar so I got smoked Gouda instead.  She loved it!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Versatile recipe. I made it exactly as described and loved it. Then I started changing out the cheese, left out the sesame seeds and changed the bread. Each time they turned out well. I also put the two halves together and cooked this in my sandwich press. That worked well too. Great base recipe to modify to suit your taste.

Excellent, quick sandwich that has a lot of eye appeal. The only modification I made was to omit the alfalfa sprouts, which have that pesky habit of gettting stuck between your teeth.

This is one of the best sandwiches I have ever had, and since discovering it in April I have made it 5 or 6 times already. If your ingredients are fresh there is basically no way to go wrong with this one! I frequently omit the alfafa sprouts and it does not suffer for it at all. Same goes for the sesame seeds. It is a really simple recipe with high quality results.

I may be somewhat partial, because I love Avocados, but I really enjoyed this. The only change I made was to use whole wheat English muffins and after toasting, I added only cheese to the top half of the muffin and closed it like a sandwich rather than eating it as an open faced sandwich. I ate half of it before remembering the ranch dressing. It was good even without the dressing. 

I will share this sandwich with my husband (who will need two because as he is nearly 6ft and one of these sandwiches would not satisfy his hunger). 

For me this is perfect as posted, but my husband is allergic to raw tomatoes and avocado, so I am going to try to bake it for a while before adding the cheese and broiling. 

My only regret is that I only made one .... except that it was a late lunch and dinner is just around the corner, I would have had another!!!

This was AMAZING! The ranch dressing and cheddar cheese combine with veggies on an English muffin to melt in your mouth and entertain your taste buds... In other words, BRAVO! I added minced black olives to half of mine, it's perfect either way! Even my two year old and picky man ate these.

We liked this sandwich except we prefer cold avocado.  Next time, i will toast the bread in the toaster and keep the veggies cold.  Maybe experiment with different cheeses.

The flavors didn't knock me over at first bite, but by the second I was hooked.  I couldn't find sprouts or sesame seeds at my very sad and small grocery, (it's the kind with whole aisles devoted to pork rinds and cheap beer) but even subbing mixed greens for the sprouts and omitting the seeds it was an excellent, fresh-tasting summer afternoon sandwich.  Thanks for the post!

This was so tasty and good! I omitted the sprouts and seasame seeds. I added some garlic powder to the avocado and used cheddar cheese. Don't forget the ranch (I prefer the kind you mix with mayo and buttermilk) it really brings all the flavors together.

I wouldn't consider this the "best" sandwich, but it was pretty darn good.  I will be making this again.  I was out of sesame seeds, I used whole wheat english muffins, low-fat ranch dressing (Naturally Fresh is the absolute best) and I salt and peppered the sandwich before I broiled it.  My boyfriend (who mostly eats vegetarian because of me) does not care for sprouts, but he enjoyed this sandwich a lot!  Quite tasty!

I modified this a lot because after I toasted the eng. muffins and mashing avocados I realized I had hardly any of the ingredients... but I still loved it. It was too late to think of something new for dinner so I had to improvise. 

Here's what I used on top of the toasted english muffin:
chive and onion cream cheese
mashed avocados--sprinkled with salt
cheddar cheese
mozzarella cheese

I know this is not this recipe at all, but this tasted great! I can't wait until I have all the ingredients to make the real recipe, it looks so good!

Awesome! We substituted sprouted grain bread for the english muffins, mung bean sprouts for the alfafa sprouts, and we used a cheese substitute. My husband and I both enjoyed this sandwich! It's become a regular weekend lunch!

I loved this!  I added a little too much ranch dressing though, so they were pretty gooey, and I think I should've added more sprouts.
I did some substitutions - whole wheat english muffins, zesty guacamole instead of basic avacado, and I did a mixture of fat-free cheeses (cheddar and mozzarella) mixed with just a little smoked cheddar for the melty factor. I added some turkey slices on half of them for my non-veggie husband to try - he seemed to approve.  I will definitely make these again - maybe to bring to work and zap in the micro to melt the cheese...

My husband is not fond of avocado or sprouts, but he liked these!  Even my picky kids liked them!  YUMMY!

Very good. I added some portabello mushroom for some "meat."

I loosely used the recipe to make my own version- ciabatta bread and more veggies- cucumber and mushrooms. Really yummy and my husband didn't even ask "where's the beef?"   :)

I loved this sandwich and my kids will even eat it too. I substituted the avocado and instead spread guacamole on the sandwich. It was so yummy. I will make this again and again.

This recipe was fair, nothing special.  I liked the mashed avocado and the ranch gave it a good flavor but thats it.
