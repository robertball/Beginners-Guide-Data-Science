We had a super spicy red curry tonight - and this salad was a great cool-down! I added a little more sugar, otherwise made as written. Thanks for the recipe! :)

This is a great recipe. I made a few changes because I didn't have all of the ingredients. I put in unrefined cane sugar instead of the white sugar, and I used dried coriander instead of the fresh cilantro. I think what made the recipe special, was the peanuts. It gives the salad this extra bite!

I followed the recipe exactly. I did not add peanuts since I'm not a huge fan. There's a very mild flavor but it's extremely fresh tasting. I'd make this again for sure. Maybe next time I will use halved cherry tomatoes and chop the cukes into cubes.

I think I know the "something missing" ingredients some reviewers mentioned. This needs a teeny bit of peanut oil and some fresh chopped thai basil. It will make all the difference, trust me. If you have never had thai basil it has a lovely anise taste and aroma but very subtle. This recipe could also use some very thinly sliced radish to add the heat some felt it needed. With those modifications, it will be fabulous.

Something's missing, but I don't know what. I made this to accompany a Thai meal. I may make it again to figure out what's missing.

This is a really nice cucumber salad variation.  I don't care for cilantro, so I substituted parsley.  I also used yellow tomatoes and red tomatoes to give it even more color.  It was a big hit.

Amazing!!  This is a true Thai salad.  The cilantro is a must for this recipe.  My 13 month old loved this salad as well, onions and all!  Followed this recipe exactly....thanks for sharing!  You have to like Thai food in order to love this dish.  I will make this forever.

A nice cucumber salad that is not overly sweet.  The peanuts are a nice addition.

Very good, I was going to rate it 4 stars until I let it set for an hour in the fridge.  Only thing I did different is salt the cucumbers and tomatos. It will not keep long, so don't make it too far in advance.  Also, I may increase the dressing amount by 50% or so next time.  It tastes a lot like the chinese coleslaw my wife makes.  This would be great for a summer cookout pitch in.

Nice and refreshing, although without a bit of heat it seemed to be missing something.  Maybe next time I'll add some red pepper flakes to give it a kick.  Very tasty though.  Thanks for sharing.

Nice salad, I did need to add some sesame oil and some garlic for more flavor though.  I like how simple this salad is, and the peanuts add a good salty crunch.  Thanks for sharing!

Great starter recipe. I added chopped snow peas, sweet peppers, parsley. Also added Shirachri (?) rooster sauce to the dressing. Gave it a nice kick.

I took this salad as my contribution to a dinner invitation.  The hostess didn't know what type of salad I was taking but she happened to bake a fresh loaf of flavoured whole wheat bread with an oil & Balsamic mixture.  Everyone raved about it.  I added a little more cilantro.

I am a thai food lover so this salad looked like the perfect way to use up the 2 cups of cherry tomatoes I was gifted with by a neighbor. I made this with those cherry tomatoes and diced the cucumber. I substituted raw turbinado sugar for the white + 1 tsp agave nectar to keep the glycemic load as low as possible yet achieve the desired amount of sweetness; I used vidalia onion instead of red. I used 1 tsp coriander seed because I had no fresh cilantro. I used prepared lime juice. I used equal parts seasoned and plain rice vinegars. I did add chopped peanuts for authentic thai taste.  I marinated everything in a flat glass pyrex storage dish and turned it upside down at intervals so everything could marinate equally. This is a very mild flavor, the thai-style dressing allows the taste of the veggies to shine through. I could eat this with every meal because it's so colorful, light and healthy. If you appreciate thai food, you will like this.  My picky 13 year old enjoys it as much as I do. A complement to burgers, chicken, fish, stir fry, practically everything.  I will make this again and again with the changes I listed above.  Would be great for office potlucks or picnics.

Not bad, I thought it would be good for the kids since it's not spicy, but they didn't like it at all.  And they usually foods like this.  I still enjoyed it, made as is except I doubled the tomatoes (they were small garden ones).

Love it! Followed the recipe, except substituted stevia for sugar (son is diabetic) and it is great! Some people thought it needed something- I like it sprinkled with Salad Supreme Seasoning- reminds me of a chain restaurant's cucumber/tomato salad.

This salad went perfectly with chicken satay. The two flavor combinations complemented each other. My husband is not a big fan of salads, but this one he devoured. Yummmi!!

Very good for the faint of heart. I add 1/4 cup fish sauce-1/4 cup white vinegar-1/4 cup cold good water. Then thinly slice one jalapeno or three thai bird peppers. YUM

Very good & nice blend.  Looked pretty with all the different colors & the cute way of doing the cucumber.

This really turned out well.  The only changes I made was to dice the veggies into similar size chunks, salt them and let them sit a few minutes to drain a little. I also added a couple of shakes of garlic powder as everything could use a bit of garlic (grin).  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Loved it.  I had made early so the salad sat in the fridge for a few hours.  I added some goat cheese which was perfect with this combination.  Will be making again.

Made as is - I agree with other reviewers in that it was missing "something".  For me, that something was salt.

Nobody cared for this. I did not put in all 3 tbsps of cilantro, one was enough.

Great salad.  I made it this weekend because I had all the ingredients on hand.  It was the hit of the party.  Flavors just work so well together, especially the cilantro.

I changed the cilantro to fresh basil from the garden. Just made sense to me.

7 29 17 ...  http://allrecipes.com/recipe/205651/thai-cucumber-tomato-salad/ ... A little heat & this could be a "four".  It's close.  I like the lime & cilantro combination.  Pretty.  Second favorite of the many I've tried.

Try adding a sweet fruit like mango or pineapple. I substituted organic raw honey for the sugar, and added chickpeas to make it more hearty.

Had this tonight along side of baked salmon. Very good, easy to put together and didn't change a thing except for using sugar substitute instead of white sugar in the dressing. Keeper!!

Awesome! I made this for the first time and took it to a potluck and everyone raved about it. I had huge cucumbers and tomatoes from the garden so seeded and chopped them all for less liquid. Used a sweet onion instead of red. Because I had so many veggies I had to triple the dressing  but did add just one extra teaspoon of sugar and a splash of sesame oil. I obviously used way more cilantro because of the amount of salad I made and I mixed it in with the dressing so I wouldn't have to do it at the party. Kept the peanuts on the side so people could choose to have them or not. I was a little nervous to try a new recipe on my husbands family but it was a hit! Thank you for a great way to use up those garden cukes!

Was a little to sour, so added a little more sugar. I think fish sauce would be a great addition.
