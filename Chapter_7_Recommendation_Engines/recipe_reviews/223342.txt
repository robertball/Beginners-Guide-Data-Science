Turkey & Pork Chili Haiku: "Just finished this meal, had to review right away. No less than 5 stars!" I made this chili w/ only 1 lb. ground turkey (just dropped the 28 oz. can tomatoes -- on that note, why did that other review say "nice bean-less chili alternative" when Chili Magic has beans in it?) I kept all the seasoning/spices and directions the same, and I know that Chili Magic really DOES make chili magical, but I like to think that Nenadd's recipe also had a bit of magic of its own, b/c our bowls disappeared! I ate mine w/ cilantro, cheese, fritos, and Sriracha, but even a "virginal" bite was straight-up YUM. Next time I'll be making it w/ all the ingredients as originally written and if there are leftovers, cool, I'll either gobble them up, or freeze em.

Definitely enjoyed this.  Served one night with cornbread and the next to make chili dogs.  Nice bean less chili alternative.
