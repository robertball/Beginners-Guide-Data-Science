I was just a little worried how orange juice would work on meat, but I was  pleasantly  suprised. This is quite good to say the least.

It's good and gives a twist on Montreal Steak and Teriyaki Steaks.

This was very good! I appreciate the recipe so I could do something different other than fajitas with flank steak. Paired House Fried Rice, Sauteed Veggies and Egg Drop Soup with this and the meal was a hit! Thank you.
