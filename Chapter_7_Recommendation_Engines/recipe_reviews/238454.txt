I made this last week, but with a few variations. I used slices of bread instead of hoagie rolls.  I actually toasted my bread in the toaster first, then buttered it and sprinkled on garlic powder to taste. Then I built the sandwich on top of the garlic sides, then buttered the outside and finished it off on the griddle. So it was twice-toasted, making the sandwich extra crispy and extra good!  I used provolone slices and freshly grated Parmesan, but I think it would also be amazing with fresh mozzarella. I also chopped up the spaghetti into more bite size pieces before putting it on the sandwich. And I used bolognese or meat sauce. Oh, and unless you like cold spaghetti straight from the fridge, be sure to heat it up first. My first attempt yielded a hot, crispy sandwich with melted cheese, but a cold filling. It is SO much better with hot spaghetti. Once you try this, you may find yourself doubling your spaghetti recipe, just to make sure you have plenty of leftovers! :-)

This was an interesting sandwich. I liked the flavors, but the texture needed some help for me. It was all soft.. soft bread soft noodles.  needed meatballs or peppers or something to add a little bite

I liked this dish very much and I found it was best with ragu original.
