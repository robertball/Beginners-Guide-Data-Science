I bought a pumpin at the farmer's market for making pie & seeds, but found this recipe on a "quick meal" search & thought, "What the hey? Sounds healthy & the ratings are great."  SO>>>  I followed other reviewers & added about 1/4 Cup of food processed onions to the bubbling butter, then did the recipe as followed.  Added about 1 cup of shredded chicken to it & used Coconut milk instead of the 1/2 & 1/2, AND I used Indian Curry which made it near impossible for my children to feed their bodies so wonderfully as my hubby & me!  Made wheat rolls & topped the soup with the seeds & we were so satisfied, in & out!  This is a great, warm up your insides & get your nose running soup! So good for you too!  Thank you for this addition to my fave site!  Now this recipe card sits in front row in my soup slot in the recipe box!!!

really good and creamy.  Sauted minced onions with the butter, used coconut milk instead of half-n-half, and added cumin.  will make this again.

This soup is ridiculously good. I made this to use up some unused Christmas dinner ingredients, and I think it's going to be replacing my current pumpkin soup recipe! I made a few changes: I added one chopped yellow onion, and about 2 tablespoons of minced garlic to the curry saute, and I replaced the vegetable stock with chicken stock and the cream with evaporated milk because I had it on hand and wanted to use it up. I'm sure this soup is great without any changes though! I also added a pinch of ginger. Served it with some warm crusty popovers. Delicious! Thanks so much for the recipe!

I have done this recipe with the onion and half-and-half a couple of different ways.  I have chopped the onion to add texture and I have also thrown it into the blender so it was creamy.  I like it creamy and my husband prefers the onions chopped.  Either way you go this recipe is a winner and so easy you will not believe it.  I am so glad I tried this in October.  I will be making this a lot and we will be able to eat this warming dish all winter long!  I think it is substantial enough for a main dish.  Wonderful as is!

I'm rating medium because I know this can be so much better. my fiancee makes a soup similar to this, but it definitely uses coconut milk instead of cream, which is so much better for you, and fish sauce instead of soy sauce. both substitutes are actually oriental ingredients instead of americanized versions. also if you use a butternut squash you don't need to add the sugar as it's naturally sweeter than pumpkin.

FABULOUS.. I can't believe I made something so great tasting and easy to prepare. I used chicken broth instead of vegetable and I used heavy whipping cream instead of half and half. The way to give it a kick in flavor is either to add more curry or just more salt. I also put in a little more sugar and it really tasted fantastic and I will definitely make this again....it's an awesome "comfort" food on a cold fall afternoon.

THE ORIGINAL RECIPE is great. It didn't need changes. It's obnoxious when people rate recipes based on their substitutions.

I love this soup, or anything with pumpkin!  I have made this with coconut milk instead of half and half with yummy results.

The soup is great! Instead of canned pumpkin, I used fresh pumpkin, baked it for 30 minutes the night before.  The baked pumpkin turned out to be so soft that I mashed the it using a laddle instead of a blender. I also used curry paste and added a bay leave to the stock as recommended.  My friends LOVE the soup, will make it again, very soon!

Very good recipe.  For my tastes, it was a bit lacking in the spicy-ness, so I added a little green curry and pepper.  yummy.

I served this recipe to an entire party of people... it had a very creamy and mild flavor so I added extra curry and soysauce.  May be good to try it with the onions option in the description.  Everyone really liked it, although some spiced it up a bit on their own, a little seasoning salt and some crushed red pepper for the ones who really wanted spice. 

Great over-all!

I love the simplicity of this recipe, however I omit the sugar and add a few other spices like red pepper, chili powder and paprika as well as garlic salt to make it a savory soup.  I still love the curry.  I change out the vegetable broth with chicken broth.  This is the best recipe for large groups.  Instead of garnishing with pumpkin seeds, I like to change it out with either toasted walnuts, saut√©ed mushrooms or crumbled bacon (or all three!).  It is great to offer your guests a choice of garnishes - especially if you have picky eaters, or ones on special diets.

I served this at a dinner party and it was a big hit. And it couldn't have been easier to make! I used canned pumpkin and it turned out wonderfully.

I tried so hard to like this - but I just didn't. And to my surprise, it was Hubs who I thought wouldn't like this and he did!  It was different and interesting, I'll give it that.  But I think it was overly "curried" and that did it in for me. Hubs said for him it was the curry that made the "pumpkin" part of this soup edible!   I used chicken broth rather than vegetable broth - I never have vegetable broth on hand and know I would prefer the chicken broth anyway.  I left out the sugar - pumpkin is sweet enough.  It's very rich and again, too curried, so a little goes a long way. Therefore, I have to agree with Hubs that this would be good as a "soup shooter starter," as a complement to the rest of the meal.

Simply fantastic. Better with fresh pumpkin than with canned, but the canned stuff is obviously so much easier. I used onions and there's no way I'd go without, I also added some Garam Masala which just kicked it to an even more amazing height. I tried it before I added the masala though, and it was divine. I will make this often, there is no doubt.

Good recipe, but bland for our family's tastes.  My add-ins: I sauteed 1/2 a minced onion, 2 minced garlic cloves, and 1/2 a minced apple (I had Jonagold) in the butter, added cumin and curry and a pinch of cinnamon to the flour and then mixed in as directed.  Used low-sodium chicken stock in place of veggie, and for the cream element I used a mixture of half fat-free half and half and light coconut milk.  At the end, added soy sauce as directed, but needed extra brown sugar (definitely would have used less if I'd had dark instead of light), a few sprinkles of cayenne and an extra tablespoon of curry.    At that point I loved the taste, but wanted some texture.  I looked through my cupboard and found 2 cans of sliced potatoes and a large can of chickpeas.  I drained and rinsed them well, sliced the potatoes in half, and added the whole can of chickpeas, and it was absolutely delicious, warming and filling.    A little went a long way, so I had a bunch to freeze for the season.  Next time I will try a mixture of apple cider and coconut milk for the cream part, and add a bay leaf.  Also some fresh herbs next time... not sure what yet.

Simple and tasty.  Definitely add ginger and garlic at some point.  A bit of apple juice or crushed apples will sweeten it if you like a sweeter pumpkin soup.   Keep a can of pumpkin in your pantry and whip up a great soup in minutes.

I didn't bother with the seeds but this was amazing. I used 1 cup half & half and a half cup of skim milk, followed everything else exactly and it turned out perfectly rich and creamy and delicious. I will definitely make this again!

The base of this soup is excellent, but it needed much more flavor to suit my taste.  I love spice, and I needed to add more red pepper flakes, curry powder, pepper, and cinnamon to make it delicious.  Also, I don't think it is supposed to be a mild soup, but the recipe as is tasted too bland.  Just a splash of tabasco and 1/4 cup vinegar added at the end of cooking made ALL the difference in the world.  I would absolutely recommend this soup to anyone, but don't be afraid to flavor it to really make it shine.

I have been making this soup for years now.  It has become one of the Fall Favorites in our house.  I always add a diced onion to add more flavor to the soup.  Since the recipe makes a large amount, I always freeze about half.  It freezes well and is just as good reheated as it is fresh!

Love, love, love, love, love! Easy, quick and delicious! This soup had wonderful rich flavor with a nice kick at the end. It was devoured. I made it for a party I was going to and served it as soup shooters.  I put a small dollop of sour cream and then the onions as a garnish. They were a huge hit. Thanks for the great recipe that will be a staple in our home from now on.

This is a fantastic recipe...with a few changes.  I added finely chopped onions to the butter before adding the flour/curry powder.  I also substituted coconut milk (1 can) for the half-and-half.  I served this to a group of 15 teens, 2 college students, and 4 adults.  It was an absolute hit!  One suggestion I got from 2 people was that it'd be great served over rice...another was to add raisins.  It really does only take about 20 minutes to make.  Definite keeper recipes.  Thank you!

This is an excellent soup. Not only is it a treat for the tastebuds, but it fills the kitchen with a wonderfully rich sweet & spicy aroma. It couldn't be easier to make! The only change I made this time around was to use brown sugar instead of the white sugar. I like the deeper, more complex flavor of that sweetener better. I also only roasted the pumpkin seeds for 5 minutes total. Past episodes of billowing clouds of black smoke from burnt pumpkin seeds trained me to watch them carefully. Carmelized onions also make an excellent topping for this soup.

This was good, but better with coconut milk as a substitute for the half and half cream, and thai curry paste as a substitute for the curry powder. I used a little more sugar.  Next time I will add onions processed in a good processor as suggested by others.

This was really good, although I had to admit that I used the recipe more as a general guideline than following it perfectly, but it still turned out really well. Here's what I did: Sauteed onion in 1T butter until soft. Added garlic and sauteed for 1 min. Added a spice mixture of 1T curry powder, 1/2t ground coriander, 1/2t ginger, 1/2t nutmeg, 1/2t cinnamon, 1/2t turmeric, 1/2t red pepper flakes and sauteed for 1-2 min. until fragrant. Added 1T tomato paste and sauteed until lightly browned (basically, I made the base of a curry). Then added 1 can of diced tomatoes, 2 cans pumpkin and 4 cans chicken broth, about 1T soy sauce and brought to a simmer. I added 1C of lentils (measured dry) to make it more substantial and add some protein (saw another recipe that did this). Something was still missing. Added ~1T brown sugar and some salt, which improved the flavor immensely. I was hesitant about this because I was trying to make it healthy, but the added sugar was worth it in this case. After looking at some other recipes online, I cut up a McIntosh apple and added it in for more sweetness. It was really good, a little spicy/sweet/savory all at once. I think a little bit of coconut milk would have made it over-the-top fantastic, but I didn't have any and it would have made it significantly less healthy. Simmered for ~20 min until the lentils were cooked (I had boiled them separately for a few minutes while I was making the curry base). Turned out great!

What a fantastic recipe. My sister in law made this as an appetizer for Christmas dinner and it was a huge hit. The flavor combination in this soup is absolutely wonderful! It keeps very well in the fridge for a few days and is perfect for a hearty lunch the next day. Thanks for sharing this.

4.5 stars - I thought this was a great spiced pumpkin soup.  I followed other suggestions and added in some minced onion and garlic (sauteed at the beginning to soften), substituted coconut milk for the half-and-half, and omitted the soy sauce but added in a little bit of cumin.
This made a nice consistency, well flavored soup.  Could potentially use a bit less curry powder, but I suppose it depends on how much you like the flavor.  Proper salt and pepper seasoning really made this soup for me.  Would definitely make again!

I sauteed half a yellow onion and 1 tablespoon fresh minced garlic until almost caramelized and added it to the soup.  I subbed coconut milk for the half and half and I also added an additional 2 tablespoons of sugar.  I used my immersion blender to puree it until it was creamy and smooth.  Very good with crusty bread!

After reading the recipe, and the reviews, i decided to saute finely chopped onion and finely grated fresh ginger with the butter, before adding the rest of the ingredients. I used House Curry cubes instead of curry powder. And lastly drizzled some coconut cream before serving. I didn't add any soy sauce. I'm asian, and soy sauce is not something we add to curry, that's why i omitted it. 
Got lots of compliments on the soup. :) tks for the recipe!

Absolutely delicious!  I am eating it right at this moment, and I may need to go back for a second bowl.  I love pumpkin, but I don't like sweet soups.  I also love curry, but I can't handle excessive spice.  This recipe let me indulge both!    I made some changes, and I also halved the recipe.  I added a bit of nutmeg, ginger, and fresh garlic for extra flavor.  At the suggestion of other reviewers I added yellow onion right after the flour and spices, and since I wanted something with more texture, I also chopped up a couple of baby carrots and a celery stalk.  I also used brown sugar instead of white, and just added about a tablespoon to taste.  I noticed the sugar really brought out the pumpkin flavor, so it's worth adding.  The seeds really gave it a nice nutty flavor, although I find them a bit hard to chew when they're wet.  Will definitely make this for family!  Edit to add: I made this again and thought I would try coconut milk instead of cream, but I didn't realize we only had light coconut milk.  It didn't turn out nearly as creamy and delicious as it should have.  If you go for coconut milk, definitely don't use the light!

This was good.  I skipped the roux, but sauteed some minced garlic cloves and minced onions, then added the broth.  Homemade chicken broth, no less.  And I used evaporated milk instead of half & half.

I had my doubts about this soup.  I mean, pumpkin and curry???  But, boy was it yummy!  I added the onions as suggested and it added a great flavor.  I'm definitely going to keep this recipe and make it over and over!

The original recipe is delicious without any changes.  It has a rich, warm flavor... a great comfort food for a brisk fall day or cold winter day. To make this gluten free, substitute corn starch for the flour, and make sure the broth is gluten free.  To use fresh pumpkin instead of canned, gut and cut a 3 lb sugar pumpkin into 1" x 2" chunks, drizzle with veg oil, and toss to coat.  Roast 15 minutes in a grill pan, on the grill.  Cool and peel the skin off. Add the chunks instead of canned pumpkin, and use a stick blender (mine is a kitchen aid and it worked great) to puree the soup.

It's unfortunate that I have to rate the recipe to leave a review, because I made too many changes to the original for me to really be able to give a fair rating... but since I have to rate, I'd put it solidly in the middle.  Some of the changes I made were necessary (only had 13.9 oz pumpkin), others were due to personal preference (do not like things too spicy). Here are the changes I made: halved the recipe; used turkey stock instead of veggie broth; used approx. half amount of curry (still plenty spicy for me); did not add salt.  Next time I will mince up half a medium sweet onion (for a half-batch of soup) in my food processor, and saute that with the butter.  Too many changes to really rate the recipe as written, but I think the original is a great base and lends itself well to modification.

Simple to make and healthy, especially when you substitute non-fat evaporated milk for the heavier cream.  I only made a half recipe since I had a half can of pumpkin on hand.  I sauteed half a diced onion with the butter/curry mixture, added a splash of Frank's Red Hot in the last couple of minutes and sprinkled chia seeds on top for extra fibre.  We liked it and I'll make it again.

I do not give a recipe 5 stars unless it deserves it. The only thing I did differently was I had to use Knoor vegetable mix for broth b/c the store was out of veg broth. It's the same thing, really. Super good soup.

I'm giving this four stars because everyone at Thanksgiving dinner (12 people!) this year LOVED it, but I didn't care much for it. I think I just don't like pumpkin that much, but it's a good recipe nonetheless. I will be making this for my family again. :)

This was good but in my opinion, the soy sauce way overpowered the curry flavor. I'll make it again but next time cut way back on the soy or leave it out altogether. Loved the toasted pumpkin seeds on it. I did them in a dry skillet instead of the oven and they were ready in a flash.

It was great.  My husband added some chicken and cooked mushrooms. He loved the addition.  I personally just liked the addition of the mushrooms.  I also used a can of evaporated milk instead of the half and half.  Tasted great!  Will make it again.

I had to substitute 2% milk for the half and half, I omitted the pumpkin seeds, I used fresh pumpkin puree instead of canned, homemade vegetable broth instead of canned, and I added some Worcestershire sauce in addition to the soy sauce.  I thought it turned out great!  I will make this again and again!  Next time I will be sure to get some half and half or heavy cream because I think that would give the soup a much better flavor and texture.  I also plan to steam and puree some cauliflower (or possibly add some other type of squash like butternut) to add to the soup along with some extra vegetable broth so it‚Äôs not too thick.  I think the addition of the cauliflower or squash would give it some more dimension.

I subbed milk for the heavy cream to make it healthier.  The flavor was quite good, but the soup did taste a little too "healthy" for me.

This is EXCELLENT!  I use "wet" curry (the kind in the jar) and just tweak things here  & there to the flavor I like.  It has become a staple in my house and my FAVORITE fall/winter dish!  I've started making Naan to go along with it - YUM!!  Everyone who's tried it or even smelled it (brought it for lunch at nursing school) has drooled over it.  THANK YOU!!

I made this for a change of pace from chipotle pumpkin soup, which I make at least once a month. This recipe is good. I skipped the roux, as it isn't necessary; I just adjust the amount of liquid to achieve the desired thickness (used about 4 cups of total liquid). I used almond milk in place of the half-and-half and skipped the sugar, as it just didn't seem like it needed it. I like things spicy, so I added cayenne and crushed red pepper, as well as freshly ground black pepper. This is great topped with a spoonful of reduced fat sour cream. Nice change of pace from my usual soup. Another great thing is that it can be on the table in 15-20 minutes from start to finish, so you have a from scratch soup in about the same time that it would take to make canned/premade.

The Soup was delicious as is! Its warm and spicey and perfect for the winter months. I actually add a little more spice than recommended and, upon the request of  my brother, added some cayenne pepper for a kick to make the soup spice-y and spicy. :)

Great soup. Will go into my recipe box with a little star.

this was yummy...i had tried another pumpkin soup that swore my family off all pumpkin soups... until this one.  i made it for pennies with leftover canned pumpkin from thanksgiving!  I did add more curry and salt and used turkey stock that I had made homemade also for thanksgiving.

My husband and 2 little boys did not seem interested in the thought of it.  But, they all loved it and asked me to make it again.

What a delicious soup! We tried it with the onions, as suggested. This was fast, easy, and so comforting on a snowy winter night. Thanks for sharing, Mary!

Excellent recipe which I have now added to my repertoire of fast, easy and wonderful autumn & winter soups.  It was delicious, as written, but I've gradually introduced the following amendments to suit my personal taste: I use coconut milk instead of half-and-half; reduced the pumpkin to approx. 2 cups; and -- instead of curry powder -- I add 2 TBSP of green curry paste, which gives it a fresher, more complex flavor and just a touch more heat. Thank you so much for submitting this recipe!

WOW!  I could not have screwed this up any more than I did, and it still turned out great!  Thought I had veggie stock, but I didn't, so had to use chicken stock.  Thought I had bought pumpkin at the store, but had accidentally bought pumpkin pie filling.  I went ahead and used it, but then (obviously) omitted the sugar called for in the recipe.  Used coconut milk instead of half & half per suggestions in the other reviews.  TURNED OUT GREAT!!! Whole family loved it.  Will try again with correct ingredients!

Love this recipe!  It is now part of our Thanksgiving menu but we start making in October because it's so good! I add a chopped onion, 1 clove minced garlic and 1/4 tsp ginger when melting the butter before I add the flour.  It's not as smooth as it would be without these added ingredients but it still works (sometimes I add a little butter if it seems too thick.)  Then when the soup is done, I use an immersion blender to make it all smooth again before I serve the soup.  It tastes even better the next day!!

Extremely flavorful! We thoroughly enjoyed this! Loved having the curry taste so I added slightly more than the recipe called for. I found low sodium veg broth - so yummy! Cooking this recipe made the house smell so wonderful! I also finely chopped a yellow onion and added that to the curry mix - cooked the onion until soft. We love having onion in soups. Also, subbed Light organic coconut milk in place of 1/2 & 1/2.  I also used brown sugar instead of conventional white sugar. Mmmm! Served with a nice salad and warm artisan bread! Hubs can't wait for leftovers tonight! This is on the fall recipe dinner rotation now! :)

After reading other reviews, I used coconut milk; I also substituted soy with tamari (smoother), then added a bunch of sliced fresh mushrooms, which was delicious. Next time I may saute some tofu and throw that in. We thought this would do well over rice if you cut back on the broth and add other veggies. It's a great recipe, which I think would work well a variety of ways. One thing to keep in mind - it may be too spicy for some. We liked it and out spice-loving kids did, too, but you have to like curry.

This is restaurant-quality soup.  Only thing I did differently is to replace half the  vegetable broth with chicken broth.  Perfect cold weather soup!

I didn't care for this. As a matter of fact, we didn't eat it. It could very well have been my choice of curry. I think maybe if I would have used a sweet curry I would have liked it better. I found it too spicy for me and not the comforting soup I was looking forward to.

I really liked this soup! My husband prefers spicy dishes, so I added more curry powder than it called for. I also added about 1 1/2 tablespoons green curry paste. I followed some reviewers suggestions to make it more flavorful and substituted coconut milk for the half and half and also fish oil for the soy sauce. I added some ginger, garlic, & pumpkin pie spice and more sugar. We served it over rice. Very good!

This was excellent. To make this MUCH healthier I subbed Skim Milk for Half and Half. The taste was still very good, but it was a bit thin. Perhaps next time I will cut the quantity of milk a little or just up the rue...

This soup is VERY spicy....you may want to try half the amount of curry and soy sauce to start with. I did use the half and half but think the coconut mild sounds like a good substitute.

Made the soup with the onions sauteed and sprinkled some nutmeg at the end. I used green curry paste since I had some in the fridge. We had this for dinner with some warm pita bread. Yum. It was a filling hearty soup.

Great fall soup and very tasty!  I added about half a cup of chopped onions at the beginning (cooked with the butter) and a tsp (give or take) of ginger for more zing.

This was exceptional.  I made it with half coconut mix you get from the alcohol aisle in the supermarket and half cream.  I also added half an onion and a clove of garlic which I sweated before I added the flour.  I used chicken stock and apple juice instead of vegetable stock and i added crab meat.  This is the best soup I have ever had!

I enjoyed this recipe, but I did need to add a bit more sugar, a bit of pumpkin pie spice and some cumin to give it a little more flavor. I used fresh pumpkin (3 1/2 cups worth) instead of canned. I served with a dollop of sour cream on top and saltines. I really liked it, but the rest of my family had mixed reviews on this. Next time I make it I may add some diced potatoes, carrots, and chicken for them.

This came out great! Following other reviewers' advice, I saut√©ed 2 onions and 4 garlic cloves w/ the curry powder and flour, and replaced the half and half w/ evap. milk. I didn't have any stock, so I just used water. I also used fresh pumpkin baked at 375 for an hour. I skipped the sugar and put in some ground/powdered ginger. I will definitely make this again. :)

excellent soup! I used evaporated milk instead of half-and-half because I had it on hand. I also had to make my own curry powder using 2 tsp. ground coriander, 1 tsp. ground cumin, 1/2 tsp. cayenne pepper, 1/4 tsp. turmeric, and 1/4 tsp. ground ginger. the only other change I made was to add about 1/2 cup of cooked white potato because I needed to get rid of it. I will definately make this again; my boyfriend loved it!

A delicious blend that I would not have thought went together.  I made it for a party and it was a big hit.

Warms you inside and out - the curry adds just the right amount of spicy heat to the soup, without taking away from its comforting effect.

What a great recipe!  At first I thought there was an error on the amount of curry to use, but it was perfect. The soy sauce added a great touch. I've served it twice now and each time everyone asked for the recipe. I was too lazy to toast the pumpkin seeds so just used sunflower kernels.

as always, this is a wonderful recipe- I have tried many of the modifications suggested by some of the reviewers! I especially like adding an extra tbspn of curry powder or using curry paste!  Also, I now usually add about two cups of cooked brown rice at the end- this really gives it some more substance!
Well, it's October- so I am off to stock up on some canned pumpkin!

This soup tasted great for the first hour.  Thereafter, the curry flavor simply overtook the pumpkin...the longer it sat, the stronger the curry.  Serve it immediately and it tastes good.

This receipt is great! I loved, loved, loved the taste of this soup. It's mild tasting and very creamy. Instead of using half-half though I did what another user recommend and used coconut milk.

This is okay but I wouldn't say anything better. I added the onions and coconut milk as others recommended but thought it was extremely bland. I added add'l curry powder and cayenne to kick up the flavor.

We really liked this soup! As some of the others suggested, I swapped half & half for coconut milk and I added in 1/4 a cup of chopped onions. I also added in 3/4-1 tablespoon of cayenne pepper because I like it a little bit spicier. Super easy and cheap! Plus, there is really only one dish to clean afterwards, which my fiance LOVES!

Oh, my goodness this was so delicious! I used vegetable broth, coconut milk and used just a bit more flour because I wanted it to be a little thicker. I made jasmine rice to go with it and it was really great. Perfect for a fall day...family loved it. Thanks for such a great recipe!

I'm a low carber so pumpkin is a dream food. So many things you can do with it. I didn't use any flour and used splenda in place of the sugar. It was scrumptious!

I made this with coconut milk (boxed, not canned) and wouldn't do that again.  Will try again as written next time.  Quite good still but not as creamy the way I made it.

This has become a common weekend request from my family, and I love that it is SO EASY to make. 
My alterations: 1 c. finely chopped red onion for some additional texture and flavor, coconut milk instead of cream, fish sauce instead of soy, and I serve it over a slice of crusty french bread (toasted in the oven like a huge crouton.)

I made this using fresh pumpkin from the patch. Substituted evaporated milk for the 1/2 & 1/2.  Started with a half a small white onion in the butter before adding the flour to make the roux and then added more onion powder before serving.  I liked mine with parmesan cheese and savory croutons, my husband liked his plain.  We like this enough to plan on serving it when the family comes for Christmas. Thanks for sharing!

Oh my gosh!!! This is excellent! My 6yr old son asked for pumpkin soup even though he's never had it (no one in my family has). So I bought pumpkins and made this recipe. Wonderful!! I used heavy cream and sauteed onions. 
I recommend this recipe

This soup is nothing short of DEVINE. It's perfect. I accidentally put 2 tsp of garam masala in before I realized I was putting in the wrong spice, so did that and then 1tsp of curry spice. It's wonderful. I also only had chicken broth but it doesn't matter: it's wonderful. I will make this again and again. Serve with crusty bread. OMG perfect soup. Make it! It's EASY too. I did as suggested and did puree one med onion and 4 cloves of garlic and sauteed that with the butter and spices. Delicious. This will be a staple at my house FOREVER now. Thank you for sharing it.

12 year-old did not like the texture. Flavor was good, but actually a little strong on the curry (and I usually like curry).  Might look for another recipe next time.

I didn't know that curry could have a kick.  Very flavorful and spicey.  Loved it!

I made this soup for a group of 20 some people.  It was a hit.  I also added a couple of mini marshmallows to each bowl.  The marshmallows melt and the bit of sweetness is very good with the curry. This recipe is very easy to make.

Really different, but tastes great!  I made it a couple of times and found that some sort of cream is necessary.  Coconut milk works fine, but imo the cream tasted best.

I had left-over pumpkin in a can after making cookies, so was looking what to do with it. Found this recipe and then made a whole Indian dinner based around it. Actually this was amazingly tasty.  My husband and son were scarfing it up until I told them it was pumpkin and then they lost their enthusiasm. Note to self: wait a while and then make again, hoping they will forget that it has pumpkin in it...  Otherwise, wonderful and different. Thanks for the recipe.

Restaurant quality soup! I substituted a 14 oz can of coconut milk for the half/half. I can't wait to have friends over and blow them away with this soup!

This is a wonderful soup...but I tweaked it up a bit. I always start out a soup with onions, garlic, carrots and celery. I just ran them through the food processor and sauteed in butter along with minced ginger. I also added a bit of cayanne, thyme, cloves, cinnamon, marjoram and I used chicken stock and skim milk and topped with pine nuts.....so delicious and I think this is a great reciepe to build on. Thanks!

A good skeleton recipe. I made several changes: I doubled the pumpkin, used coconut milk instead of 1/2 & 1/2, and added some nutmeg for spice. Garnished with diced red-bell pepper I had broiled and peeled. Delish!

The first time I made this I stuck to the recipe minus the seeds.  It was excellent and deserving of 5 stars though some of the items are not readily handy now in the kitchen (canned pumpkin, curry, cream, and veggie broth)  I decided to try some substitutions and found this recipe very versatile, healthier and still very tasty. The following was substituted: curry -> cumin, pumpkin -> cooked kabocha, vegetable broth -> good chicken stock, cream -> 2% milk. I  omitted the soy sauce and sugar and added half an onion.   In the butter, I sauteed the onions and then added the needed flour until it started to turn golden.   I added the milk, the chicken powder, cumin and cooked kabocha, and blended it together with an infusion blender while cooking until it was creamy.   I also added some water to thin the soup though this is personal preference and you can use milk instead.  The taste was wonderful and warming especially now that the weather is much colder.  I find I didn't miss the sugar too much since the kabocha was quite sweet, and with a good blender even the cream is not necessary to make it smooth.  Thank you for the base recipe and hope this is useful to anyone who has squashes around!

I loved that this is a good soup with mostly things I can keep in the pantry and just make a quick run to the store for the half and half.

Great soup- very easy! We doubled the recipe and used fresh pumpkin, whole milk, no flour (to keep it gluten free) and even skipped the sugar. It was a hit for all 4 kids I served tonight.

I did as others suggested and used chicken broth instead of vegetable, 1 whole yellow onion, and evaporated milk (fat free).  I also added a teaspoon of ginger, and some garlic powder.  We don't use butter in our house so I used a couple tablespoons of olive oil.  I also had fresh pumpkin in the freezer so I used that instead of canned.  This is a lovely soup.  I steamed 1 cup of rice with half a teaspon of cardamom and cinnamon each, and a couple of cloves.  I put the rice in the middle of the bowl and poured the soup in around the rice.  That made it really hardy.  A meal in itself.  We will make this soup again and again.  It's delicious.

This is a fantastic recipe !!! I usually make it exactly as written , but sometimes will add finely diced peeled apples. I like to take it to work with me for my supper. I add a salad and savory crackers and an small cup of diced canned pears  with a ginger snap added to malke ginger pears. I usually omit the pumpkin seeds (personal choice) Thanks Mary.

EDIT: I had to up my rating after trying the leftovers, which were SO much better than the night of! I used coconut milk instead of cream because it's what I had, but next time I think I'll stick with regular cream - the coconut was a little  overpowering. I added garlic and onion and some more curry powder. Easy, delicious, and quick to make, so I'll keep the recipe on hand! Thanks.

Such a great, filling, and tasty soup! I halved the recipe and added half of a diced yellow onion and a teasopoon minced garlic to the butter. Then I used 1 tablespoon spicy curry powder and 1 tablespoon regular curry powder with the flour mixture. I also used low fat coconut milk instead of the cream.  And lastly, after serving my portion in a bowl I added some potatoes and brocolli in for more substanance.  But boy this was deeeelicious.

This is pretty good. It's not something I would like to eat very often, though. I made it for dinner and then had leftovers for lunch and I got tired of eating it. I added some ginger and cinnamon to brighten the flavor a bit.

i'm not a pumpkin fan but this was pretty good ... my rating probably reflects that i still don't really like pumpkin (and my guests weren't big curry fans).  everyone enjoyed the soup, but not enough to make again.

This is just so darn good.  It's very filling and is excellent with a salad and bread.  Kids may not like it because it is quite spicy, but it's so comforting and full bodied.

Unfortunately this wasn't as good as everyone says, at least to me. It wasn't horrible, but I definitely wouldnt make it again.

This was quite good; we used evaporated milk instead of heavy cream and didn't even miss the cream.  Thumbs up from our baby, too!

So easy and absolutely delicious. The only modifications I made were to add one small onion chopped and I replaced the black pepper with cayenne pepper for an extra kick.

This was super easy to make and was wonderful!!!! I added a dash of cinnamon and a little extra sugar.  It had a hint of sweetness that complimented the spice of the curry. This will become one of my favorites!!!!

Made this soup last night for a Fall Harvest Celebration. It was delicious!! I did saute onions and garlic with butter first and then added the flour and curry to that. Also, I added one more tablespoon of curry for extra flavor. It was a BIG hit!!

This recipe was pretty good.  I did however follow other user reviews and added a bag of frozen vegetables.  I thought this really helped the recipe.  I also added a lot more curry then asked for, as well as other spices.  I used a little hot sauce too.

Sorry. I love pumpkin soup and love curry, but for some reason I found this soup very bland. It sounds weird because it had the nice heat from the curry but that was about it. It was super easy. I made it with the chopped onions as suggested and everything (I read all of the reviews). I had such high hopes, but I was just not impressed and wont make this again.

I took a lot of different suggestions on this one.  The make-or-break part of this recipe is of course the curry. Just remember that there are many different blends of curry, some are very spicy, others are mild or sweet. Choose the right curry according to your tastes and this is a great soup!

This was really pretty good, only just a bit too thick. Had the consistnecy of being thick like grits. Next time i'll follow the suggestion of others and thin it out, but other then that, a great taste!

This recipe was an instant hit with me and my partner. Rather than using half and half I used a thick cream, and instead of canned pumpkin... went with the real thing and diced and boiled half a pumpkin beforehand. With a drizzle of coconut cream over the top when served, some chives for extra garnish and a deliciously wholesome crusty loaf this meal is a definite favourite in my house! So much so that his workmates ask for the recipe when he takes leftovers for lunch... even his boss!

Thanks for posting this recipe. I will make the original one day. I took suggestions from other reviewers and used some ingredients I had on hand. I sauted a finely chopped yellow onion and a large clove of garlic in olive oil with the curry powder. I added homemade defatted chicken broth and home cooked and frozen pumpkin. After this simmered for awhile I added the soy sauce and a can of skim evaporated milk. The curry powder I used was quite spicy so this soup is a good cure for my seasonal allergies. I didn't need to add additional salt or any pepper.

I really liked this flavor, but I'm knocking off one star just cos I had to modify it so much. I used a milk/margarine combination because I can't eat cream, and I added more curry (and the second time around I will use even more.) I also added sauteed onions, as was suggested in the description. I thought that this wasn't going to make a very good meal on its own, so I cooked up some rice and ladeled the soup over the rice. The end result was very tasty and filling--- the pumpkin works well in this recipe!

I think next time, I will take the suggestion to use coconut milk in place of half and half.  It was just a bit too thick.  The flavor however was wonderful.

I made this as described in the recipe and my family liked it a lot.  I LOOOOVED IT!!!  It's delicious and creamy as is, but would also make a great base for a chunkier soup. A great way to use up extra cans of pumpkin. Definitely making this again, probably doubling it!
My curry powder of choice is S&B Oriental Curry Powder, because it reminds e of Japanese curry rice that I love so much.:)

I've made this recipe several times, and the only time it turned out poorly was when I used mediocre/bad curry. This time I subbed the butter for coconut oil, the half-and-half for coconut cream, and the curry powder for Thai curry paste...and dude, EVERYONE loved it. Admittedly even I was impressed with myself, haha!

I made this starting with a Halloween pumpkin that never got carved (oops!) that I cooked in my pressure cooker in late December. I've always liked pumpkin pie, but never really thought about starting from a fresh pumpkin, or making other foods. I'll never look at pumpkins the same way again! I made this soup with the following modifications: I doubled the flour/butter, for a thicker broth. I added in 2 big bouillon cubes. I left out the sugar. I used a block of cream cheese instead of the half and half. All 3 of my kids raved about it, and can't wait for next Halloween, so I can make it from scratch again. :)

Loved this! Mine was SPICY. I think it was the kind of curry I used. But next time I might try to tone back the curry. I used chicken stock like several other reviewers recommended. And I served it in a bread bowl. It makes a good amount. Four people can easily eat from this and have multiple servings. With a bread bowl, maybe even six.

Really enjoyed this soup,  and the prep is so easy! I might cut down on the curry a little as it was a bit to spicy for my  partner. It's also really easy to convert to vegan, which I did today for my clients at work.

I decided to use this recipe for  some yummy pumpkin soup and I used the Halloween Jack-O-Lantern for the pumpkin, just for fun.  I just cut the funny faced pumpkin in half, and put those halves face down on cookie sheets and let them cook for about an hour.  I put the pumpkin in the blender to puree it, and then followed the recipe from there.  It turned out great and we ate every savory bite.

I made this soup on one of the first cold days of a New England fall.  It was great! I used what ingredients I had on hand, so my soup differed from the recipe.  My curry was Garam Masala - I liked the touch of clove with the pumpkin.  I used a concentrated vegetable broth instead of home made.  I would have preferred less salt in my soup, but I'm sure that's from my broth.  I also used 2% milk instead of half and half.   I didn't miss the cream.  I will make this again.  Using canned pumpkin makes this quick and easy.  Great recipe, thanks!

This was fantastic but like others I made changes. I diced onion and added it to the butter and flour. I used coconut milk instead of half-and-half because that's what I had. Chicken broth instead of veggie. My wife was also craving more of a curry over rice dish so I steamed some carrot and potatoes and then added them. The soup is think enough to make a great curry.

This was delicious and I wouldn't change a thing. My daughter thought it was a tad too spicy (we used red curry) and thinks a yellow curry might be a better option. However--I like it hot! We actually used pine nuts rather than pumpkin seeds because that's what we had on hand.

Yummy. I made some changes: added cardamom, garam masala, and hot chili pepper flakes. Quite a kick! To serve I sprinkled dried cranberries and toasted walnuts on top. The sweet-spicy-crunchy combo was just to my taste. Thanks for a simple and easily customisable recipe. Note: I think that if this is 8 servings, it's as a side. I made this into 6 lunch sized portions (main meal, not a side).

My fam loved this soup! My son grew some pumpkins for Halloween but I wanted to show him how pumpkins can be used for more than carving. I baked one of his pumpkins and made soup using this recipe and it was a big hit! I used what I had on hand and so made some substitutions. I used chicken broth and coconut milk to total the four cups of veg broth and cream instead of the half-and-half. I also adjusted the sugar, soy sauce, and powdered curry to taste. Perfect to warm everyone up on a cold November evening!

I tried this recipe with some of the modifications suggested by others, specifically substituting coconut milk for half and half.  Don't do it! The soup lost all of its pumpkin taste.  The coconut milk was overpowering.  One small change I would suggest is to add a teaspoon or two of garam marsala along with the curry powder as directed.  I think the spices in garam marsala mix would compliment pumpkin's flavors. I'll be trying that next time and will post another review if it is a good addition.

Loved this! Super easy to make -- it's just mixing ingredients together. I left out the salt and pepper in the main recipe to allow for individual adjustments of them. Used low sodium soy sauce. Didn't use pumpkin seeds, but I don't think it really needs them and it sounds like unnecessary work.

I made this for a party to accompany a Honey Baked Ham- it was a huge hit! I tripled the recipe and it was almost gone by nights end. I added the onions, a bit of fresh garlic, and some minced ginger as others have done. Definitely a keeper!
Edit:  Made it again 5 years later for a similar party, again with a ham, and again a big success. You don't mess with a winning combination!

I halved the recipe - single guy. I used evaporated milk and did add a pinch extra curry and a pinch of ginger. I used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth. I added two stir fried boneless chichen breasts cut into bite sized pieces and a can of drained chick peas. This was really good!

I had to use fresh pumpkin as we can't get cans of it where I live, but kept everything else the same. It was really good. Next time I would add some onion and garlic as others have mentioned just for a bit more depth but it was good as listed.

This was great, but I think I was heavy-handed on the curry powder (usually I like extra, this time I don't think it was a good idea). I live in a foreign country so I have to buy a gourd similar to pumpkin called ahuyama and boil it, then when it's soft I scoop it out of the rind and put it in the blender. I added 4 garlic cloves and half an onion in the blender and had that as my replacement for the canned pumpkin. Next time I might add in a few splashes of white wine. Yum!

I followed the directions exactly, and this soup was pretty terrible until I added a TON more spices that weren't listed in the ingredients. Will definitely try a different recipe next time I make pumpkin soup.

I loved this! I added a bay leaf, cumin, a pinch of cinnamon, 1 tsp or so of fish sauce, cayenne pepper and extra curry (love that spice!). I also added minced onion and garlic at the beginning. This is a great base recipe to add to if you love heat like me!

Very delicious soup with a nice kick! My 2 year old devoured his bowl. I couldn't help but smile after every bite myself. Can't wait to make it again. Will be sharing this recipe with my friends!
There's more kick still if you use red curry powder. Also, a dollop of plain yogurt on top of each serving or alongside (not mixed in) makes a nice soothing counter-balance to any spice in the soup.

I love this recipe! The curry gives the pumpkin a wonderful kick. I did do some subtracting and adding, though. I added barley, cut up chunks of brown and serve pre-cooked turkey sausage that was sauted with chopped onion before I added the flour to make a paste, chinese 5 spice powder, skim milk and cinnamon and lost the half and half, soy sauce and sugar and no pumpkin seeds. I slimmed it down and made it more diabetic friendly.

This recipe reminds of one I use to eat all the time at my friends gourmet restaurant. I read the other reviews and I only used 1 TBLSP of the Curry Powder and omitted the salt. Overall, EXCELLENT. A great Fall soup and can be eaten throughout the year for pumpkin lovers like me.

Super simple and tastes great! I had this in my bowl in under 15 minutes. No need to ever buy canned soups with recipes like this! I love how flexible it is. I made a half batch and didn't add as much curry spice. I did add cayenne which gave it a nice hint of heat. Will definitely make again and again.

Good soup! I did add some sweet onion as suggested. After all of the seasonings were added, I still felt like it needed a little more. I added about a quarter tsp. cayenne, a tablespoon or two of brown sugar and a little ginger. I will make again! Thanks for sharing.

Omitted pumpkin seeds but added one small diced onion to beginning.  Made as is, but added one extra tbs each of curry and sugar.  Awesome soup!

We made a double batch for Thanksgiving dinner, and ended up needing to customize it a bit (people with gluten allergies, pepper allergies, lactose allergies, etc.)  We replaced 2 cups of 1/2&1/2 with lactose free whole milk, added more gluten free soy sauce, added some Worcestershire, ginger, more curry, and cumin.  Salt and pepper to taste, must more flavor.  Great base recipe, though!

Fits my two dinner rules: very quick and easy and my family loved it - and my toddler ate it like it was dessert. To quote: "yummy, yummy pumpkin soup".  Made it with fresh pumpkin (we have tons of it at home). Will be making this again as part of my Thanksgiving meal.

I LOVE this recipe! I used light coconut milk in place of the half and half and add 1/4 tsp chile powder. This added a really nice sweet and spicy taste and also cuts the calories in HALF!

This is wonderful!  I did read other reviews and tweaked it a little bit - replaced the half/half with Coconut Milk, used brown sugar instead of white, substituted chicken broth in place of vegetable broth, added about a teaspoon of ginger, extra curry (I like mine strong), and added four cooked, cut up chicken breast to the soup (since I was serving it as the main dish).  Serving it with a little french bread made it a perfect cold weather soup!  Will definitely be making this again!

LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this receipe.  I don't cook a whole lot and I wanted to try my hand at something seasonal and warm.  I had had so many great soups and have always wanted to make them but thought it would be hard.  This was easy, quick and my girlfriends loved it!  I even purchased extra ingredients so I can make it again just for myself because I love having soup when its cold.  Love the site...can't wait to try some of the varieties suggested by other members!

I love curry so I thought the recipe was very good.  I did use cream instead of half/half and thought it was too rich.  Definately needed the salt/pepper too.  Next time I will add some root vegetable and maybe shrimp and follow the recipe closer.  Thanks

Yummmmmm. I added fat free honey yogurt instead of the half and half and sugar. Also took one of the other reviewer's suggestion and added cubed chicken and garlic and because I had been looking at recipes to use ginger all day I grated about 1/4 cup of ginger in there to. The soup was so good I was sorry I couldn't eat more when I was full.

Very easy and perfect for fall weather!  I did make some very simple changes by incorporating some of the most popular substitutions of the previous reviews. 1) Sauteed & added finely, minced onion at beginning 2) Used chicken broth instead of vegetable and cut the amount in half 3) Subbed coconut milk for half and half 4) Used curry paste instead of powder (I had a Thai red curry paste on hand which went really well with the coconut milk).  Will definitely make again!

Gorgeous soup.  I wasn't sure what 1/2 and 1/2 cream was so I used a tin of reduced cream, apart from that I followed the recipe exactly using freshly roasted pumpkin, saut√©ed onions and well browned diced bacon.  Beautiful soup with a pleasant heat.

Phenomenal!  I was doing this for a vegan dinner party, so I SUBBED COCONUT MILK for the half & half. I also ADDED FRESH GRATED GINGER ROOT with the pumpkin. Creative, sophisticated way to add veggies to a dinner. End result seems much harder than this is to make!

Delicious and fast.  I used 1 TB curry powder and 1 TB Garam Masala, and subbed 1/2 cup whipping cream and 1 cup skim milk.  I also used soy vey instead of the soy sauce.  It was spicy and wonderful.

This is heavenly. I use a little more butter, a little more sugar, and add almost double the curry powder. It's so savoury and satisfying! We have it with toasted garlic bread or a salad... and it's my absolute favourite thing to make!

Good, but maybe not great - a bit heavier than I like as a soup. Might be good as a real curry base to add other stuff to. The flavor was nice.

I usually love pumpkin and curry but I made need to try this again and tweak it a bit.  Was just not quite right to me.  Then again...could have been something I did so I will definitely try it one more time.  I felt that the curry overpowered the pumpkin.

Those used to eating sweet soups who tried it really liked it.  I personally would go without the sugar.   I replaced about a third of the half and half with hazelnut milk, and that worked well.  It was no to thin.    I will try it again with the soy half half and share my experience.

This recipe was perfect for turkey day.  Instead of half and half and soy sauce, i used coconut milk and amino acid.  I added red pepper flakes, garlic, nutmeg, and cumin.

Good soup with a nice flavour - perfect amount of spice for my family and even my preschooler enjoyed it.  It did add a little chopped onion to the butter and had fresh pumpkin puree so I substitued that for the canned.  Thanks!

I tried the recipe twice.  I think the amount of butter was wrong.  When the flour was mixed in it just got dry and clumpy.  It took 4 T to make the desired consistency.   Next time my husband wants me to try making it "sweet" with nutmeg, cinnamon, etc.

It was OK.  I will probably make it again, but I will most likely omit the sugar.  I used red curry, which was the best part of the soup because I enjoy spicy foods!  Anyway, this was easy to make, with inexpensive ingredients, and very healthy!

I was a little unsure when I was putting this soup together, but one taste and I was a goner. I can't wait to make it for my parents and sisters when I go home for christmas. Delicious! Oh and I didn't change anything.

We liked this soup very much, in fact my daughter raves about it.  Due to dietary issues, I used reduced sodium chicken boullion rather than butter and in place of the veggie broth, lite coconut milk rather the 1/2 and 1/2, reduced sodium soy sauce, and brown sugar.    I finely chopped some onions and carrots and sauteed them first, to give a little more texture to the soup.  What a wonderful aroma!  The first night it wasn't spicy to the tongue, but gave a nice, warm feeling inside.  The leftovers however, had much more of a curry bite (a good one!)     I'll make again, but will play with the seasonings a bit to get it more to my taste, especially since I'm dealing with reduced the sodium and fats.    Some have mentioned it turning out thin, especially when they used the lite coconut milk, but mine did not turn out thin at all - it was the perfect consistency for pumpkin soup.

Very delicious, and easy.  I followed this recipe closely (except used a mixture of chicken & beef boullion instead of veg. broth, and added a little extra pumpkin that I had on hand).  I prefer soup of this type slightly sweeter - but it worked fine to add a little extra sugar after it was made.  Will definitely make again.

I gave this 5 stars because it's very similar to one of our favorite fall soups, but much easier to make.  I didn't  have any soy sauce on hand, so used 2 tsp. of Worcestershire sauce instead and it was still good, but probably would be better with the soy.  It's a great base recipe. You could add sliced sauteed mushrooms and onions to this, and it would be great.  The consistency is that of a creamy hot cocoa, so if you're expecting a heavy soup, you won't find it here.  For those afraid of using that much curry, don't be. It's not as spicy as you might think in this dish.

This IS really good! I used 6 cups of chicken broth to get the right consistency, then with some soup I stirred in cream and with some I stirred in fat-free plain yogurt. Also, I used Jamaican curry powder to give it a little Caribbean flavor.

I found a use for powdered sweet potatoes. I substituted pumpkin for that. Also used leftover butternut squashand omited sugar. Started w/ onion/garlic diced in butter, added chicken stock. I reinvented the wheel on this recipe. Thanks for the idea.

I hate to burst everyone's bubble here but I didn't think this soup was all that fantastic.  It was a good basic start..but absolutely no pizzaz.  I won't suggest how to change it be/c everyone has differnt likes.  But as the recipe is written it's only 3 stars.

Delicious! I made the recipe as written except with fat free half & half, and it was very rich and creamy.  I loved it.  That said the other people in my family weren't as crazy about it, but I find you can't please everyone with pumpkin soup. To me it was perfect!

Very good but needed a little something for me, thus the 4 stars. Added a dash of nutmeg, handful of parmesan cheese and some diced baked potatoes for texture. Used chicken stock instead of veg as it was all I had. A really good base recipe. Curry and pumpkin are so good together!

This soup was great. I have never had Pumpkin soup and I found this one and thought I'd try it. I added a sweet onion. I served it over rice with soy sauce. I will make this again. I left out the pumpkin seeds. Fast and Easy to make.

This is definitely a keeper. I did a few things differently...I used real pumpkin and pureed a potato along with it. I sauteed onion and garlic with the butter first before adding the curry paste. Used chicken broth in place of vegetable and only added a 1/2 tsp of sugar and then the red pepper. Since I had a can of hominy in the pantry I added that as well :). Delicious!

great!  I roasted onions, carrots and garlic and pureed them and added them instead of veg broth.  I also used the coconut milk version and appreciated the tip for more cumin which helped make it a bit less sweet. great for a pre-Parade of the Lost Souls dinner

I made a combination of this recipe and the other recipe for pumpkin soup on this site.  I added onions, celery and garlic, sauted and then did a roux of flour followed by homemade chicken stock. I tasted it before adding the soya sauce and cream and it has a nice kick.  A nice hearty soup!

Very good, easy and quick to make.  The taste is lacking nothing, its very satisfying and the pumpkin seeds add some texture.  Makes a lot of soup, I will end up freezing about 1/2 of it.

I love this soup, it's fast, easy, and always a big hit. I leave out the pumpkin seeds and add about 1/2 cup of chopped onion at the same time as the flour/curry powder. Yum!

I have been craving pumpkin soup, since it's "that time of year," and my favorite restaurant that served pumpkin soup closed down.  However, this was a little too thick, and pretty bland.  I will not make it again.

i made this as the recipe reads, and then made changes. therefore the 4 stars, because the changes as suggested make all the difference. i did use coconut milk, added garlic (which should definitly be sauteed in the butter) and a bit of onion powder, ginger, and cloves. we made some fresh bread and had a hearty meal for 4! very tasty, and a wonderful way to get into the season.

Delicious! I use garlic salt instead of plain salt, add a tablespoon of worchestershire sauce, and a generous sprinkle of cayenne pepper and paprika. In addition to sprinkling the pumpkin seeds on top, I add a dollop of sour cream.

This was good, but more as a sauce, not so much as a soup. I accidently used cumin instead of curry--it was still tasty. It seemed a little bland at first, even after adding onion and garlic and a bay leaf, so I doubled the soy sauce, added more cumin and added a tsp. of hot sauce. That definitely made it spicy. Because it was so thick, I made a bag of frozen vegetables and mixed the vegetables in with the soup, then served it over rice--very tasty that way.

I don't know if I did something wrong or just don't like the taste of pumpkin outside of pumpkin pie.  The soup was okay, a bit bland.

I replaced the half 'n half with coconut milk.  It was tasty but perhaps I should have used a bit more curry and a bit less coconut milk.  Very hearty and the guests really seemed to enjoy it.

This was ok.  I thought there would be a lot more pumpkin flavor, and was disappointed that the pumpkin didn't really seem to come through.

Made the pumpkin roll cake on this site this morning and started looking for something to do with the leftover pumpkin. Thought this sounded really good and it was!! I used chicken broth, evoo in lieu of the butter, skipped the sugar, used more soy sauce than suggested, garlic and onion powders and some hot sauce to add a little kick. Fat free half and half worked wonderfully. This thick and delicious soup will warm you right down to your toes. Thanks Mary!

I just made this recipe for lunch.  I love pumpkin and had tried another recipe for pumpkin soup which was not so great.  This has just the right combination of savory and sweet to really enhance the flavor but its not so sweet that you feel you should bake it like a pie.  What a great way to add some variety to your diet.  Plus it uses canned pumpkin which is so convenient.  Many recipes I found on line required baking a whole pumpkin.  Nice for gourmets but when a 19 month old is waiting, not so good.  I added slivered almonds and a nice sprinkling of white cheese on top.

Great easy recipe!  I added 3 small bay leaves and some poultry seasoning.  I think chicken broth or stock could be used in place of the veggie broth if necessary.  I WILL be making this again!  I did not use the seeds.  Thanks for sharing!

I had high expectations due to the number of positive reviews but I thought this was just okay. I did it with the sauteed onions and even added about 2 cups small-diced potatoes which I cooked separately, drained and then added with the onions. Maybe I'm just not a "cream soup" fan, because while the flavor wasn't bad I found myself wanting more substance. The potatoes helped, but I was wishing for something more. I did use whole milk to cut down on calories and used chicken broth instead of vegetable. Would make again, but only as a small first course for company dinner.

I served this at Thanksgiving dinner. Japanese guests, traditionally curry lovers, raved about it. I used chicken stock and it was great! Thanks!
