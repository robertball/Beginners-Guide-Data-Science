This is much like my mother's borscht- here's a tip: she peels the potatoes and puts them in whole (instead of cubing them). When they soften, she cradles them in a large spoon and uses a fork to break them into bite sized chunks and. For some reason, THIS MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE. I know not why. Try it, you won't be disappointed.

Almost exactly like the borscht recipe handed down from my russian grandmother. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because star anise is such a strong flavour and, to me, overpowers the soup. Instead, we use lots dill seed (wrapped in layered cheesecloth and simmered with the bones to infuse a lovely dill flavour into the broth). Dill and cabbage go so well together in this soup!

I made this with chicken instead of beef.  Personal preference.  Didn't have allspice berries or star anise.  Used home canned tomatoes, fresh dill and it was excellent.  Reminds me of my childhood.

I made this twice. I gave it 4 stars as I made is "as listed" first. Family and I liked it/didn't love it...but it did have merit as it is quite different. So I decided to try again and tweak a few things. For one the soup pictured looks quite pink from the tomato. Mine (first try) did not, so I doubled the tomato. Then I lost some of the flavor so I also doubled the allspice, bay and cream. I increased the pepper from a pinch to 1 tsp. Family really liked this version a lot/thinks its a keeper.

Used up two soup bones, made it on a chilly November day.  4 of us enjoyed it, I'd say the consensus level was 'pretty good'.  A couple of things:
- it says it serves 8; I stayed pretty close to the listed ingredients and I'd say that it would easily serve 14.  
- my soup bones were surprisingly meaty, so probably a little more than a cup of chopped meat went in as well.
- no one found it 'overly savoury'.  I'd probably increase the flavorful stuff if I make it again.
- couldnt' find star anise, so substituted 1/2 t. anise seed.
- couldn't find whole allspice berries, so just threw in "some" ground allspice, about 2 t. I think.
- memo to self... consider adding mortar and pestle to letter to Santa

I'm giving this 5 stars, but I used this as a basis to make my own Cabbage Borscht.  Made 1/2 of the recipe, and was using up some things I had in the cupboard, like stew meat (I rolled in flour), beef broth and cream of onion soup and omitted the tomatoes, used about 1/4-1/3 cup of ketchup for tomato flavor.  DH does not like soups or stews or anything tomato based.  The broth turned out to be like a gravy.  DH said he would eat it again.

When I make soup with bones I boil the bones for at least a day and overnight to get all the nutrients out of the bones - good for the stomach. It was a good healthy soup but it seemed very bland to me. It makes a lot of soup.

I pressure cooked the beef bones with the bay leaves, whole black pepper and anise seeds.  The marrow of the bones really added to the flavour. Doubled the tomatoes.  Added dill.  Chopped the potatoes into different sizes so while they all cooked some were mushy which made the borscht a bit thicker.  How my Omi used to make it.  Topped with sour cream and a bit of extra dill.  A good homemade loaf of bread made it all come together.  My Omi NEVER used beets - she used to say "only the peasants use beets".  LOL!

This was delightful!  I did make some changes to use up some Thanksgiving leftovers. I cut the recipe in half and used a quart bag of Brussels sprout leaves instead of cabbage.  Skipped star anise and used ground fennel seeds and ground allspice.  Used leftover cooked pot roast and beef broth ... so, my version only needed to cook long enough for potatoes to get done and flavors to meld.  I also added some small noodles.  Seemed like this recipe is pretty forgiving ... and can accommodate lots of changes and still be good!

this is very much like my mother-in-laws recipe, except she used dill seed and parsley instead of anise and allspice.
