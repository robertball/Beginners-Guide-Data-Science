I broke with tradition and substituted cauliflower for the potatoes, which also imparted a nice creamy texture to the soup.  My family honestly could not tell the difference and the transformed recipe was more in compliance with the diet we’re on!  Tasted wonderful.

My only change was to add some garlic with the onions. My wife and I both enjoyed it.

Wife and I loved it, we used chorizo sausage and kale in ours and it turned out great. Needed to add in a little olive oil for sauteing the onions after the sausage was browned as the chorizo didn't render much fat. Also added Garlic to ours. Sauteed several cloves of garlic (thinly sliced) in the sausage fat and olive oil before the onion cooked through. Be careful you don't add the garlic too soon though as the onion will take longer to cook than the garlic. We also subbed in red potatoes rather than the russets that Chef John used.

I did add a good soup base of fresh garlic/olive oil with the onions. It needs the cayenne pepper and salt for sure. Potatoes are bland without additional salt. I added fresh aged Romano cheese to the soup and it became 'Perfecta' .....

Four stars because I changed it. I use white (cannellini) beans instead of potatoes, and my own home-made chicken broth with no salt added. Tasted and added salt as needed at the end. Like some others, I use kielbasa or smoked sausage because I find chorizo is a tad too salty and greasy for my taste.

This soup turned out great! That being said, I made several changes. I recommend cooking the sausage with garlic as well as onion. I didn't mash the potatoes, and because the soup was so thick, I added some water to the broth to stretch it out. I added pepper and cayenne to taste. The sausage can be cooked while you wait for the potatoes to boil to save time.

Delicious Used "regular"kale instead of dinosaur kale the second time we made this soup and it was just as delicious. We used hot italian sausage, and it works too.

I’m one who never follows a recipe.  I did everything it asked me to but, had to add pepper, and ground cumin.  This was Very good. Looking for leftovers.  Next time I would add a can of Rotel.  Just for tomatoes and a little kick, and maybe some dice carrots and peas.  I would definitely make again as is but with a few added things.

I try to make recipes exactly as written on my first attempt, but my husband came home with Hot Linguica instead of the regular.  That's the toll for him picking up ingredients - 99.9% chance of *SURPRISE* substitution.  I omitted the cayenne and salt, and the soup turned out great (in case anyone else out there has the same model shopping assistant).

A great soup, something I'll make again and again. Had to settle for andouille sausage, as the only linguica available was either online or at one place on the other side of the city. Only other change I made was to add only  one pound of kale. Can't imagine using more with only  two quarts of liquid in the recipe. Very easy to make, once you get everything chopped, peeled, and set aside until needed.

I used smoked sausage because I’m not a big fan of chorizo. I used chicken broth which made the soup very rich. When I make it again I will used low sodium chicken broth OR not add any salt. It was a tiny bit salty. But this soup was amazingly good! I highly recommend it!!

I made this using a 1 pound head of cauliflower and 2 pounds of potatoes since I had that.  I actually found the correct sausage but I ended up putting in the whole package (1 pound).  Did everything as directed but when I started stirring in the kale I only used a pound.  2 pounds just seemed like too much!  It was full of kale and it was a wonderful soup!  Definitely a keeper.  Husband and son didn’t notice the cauliflower and I’ll never tell.

Made this using Cuban cantimpalo and the hubs loved it. And the best part is he hates kale so I get him to eat it this way with a very easy, hearty winter soup.

Added celery and carrots. Sautéed along with onions. Did diced potatoes. Didn’t mash as suggested after they were cooked but next time would slightly. Would improve the consistency of the broth to give it more structure. Also added the cayenne pepper which was nice. Used kielbasa and spinach (had on hand); would decrease salt next time. Good base recipe that is easily personalized.

Had no russets, so used red skinned potatoes, otherwise as written.  Cannot imagine it could be any better with russets, but I will find out.  This exceeded expectations.  My jaw dropped at first taste and I nearly lost a mouthful. So wonderful.  I was actually looking for a Portuguese stew recipe, and this will be a point to begin an experiment.  As always, you are my culinary hero.

Made some slight alterations: used polish kielbasa, only used a pound of kale, added quite a bit more cayenne along with red pepper flakes, garlic and pepper. To top the soup I used a little cayenne pepper sauce -- kicked it up in flavor quite a bit more. After mashing the potatoes the soup was really creamy. I watched the video Chef John did and realized that two pounds of kale was going to be a little too thick -- and halved it. Soup turned out great and would definitely make something like this again. I like that this soup is good as a base and can be altered in a variety of ways.

I made this soup for supper this evening.  My husband and I love spicy food so I made a few changes.  I used Uncle Charlie's Hot Italian sausage links cut into 1-inch pieces that resembled little meatballs - used low sodium chicken broth.  I added garlic to the onions and MORE than a pinch of cayenne pepper - approximately 1/4 teaspoon.  The soup turned out delish!!!  My husband and I will definitely be making this again :)

It's more like "Soggy Mashed Potatoes with Kale" than a soup, both in texture and consistency. Even with only about 3/4Lb Kale and 1/4Lb Spinach it was extremely thick. My husband preferred to not eat on his lunch break when he came home to this. Very disappointing for us as devout Chef John followers. I basically refuse to waste food so to salvage it I've been putting about 3c at a time into a medium Pyrex pan, covering with 1/2c enriched white rice and 1c water, or 1 small packet of Saffron Rice Mix and 1c water. I bake it for like an hour(+) at 350°, stirring occasionally, to turn the already thick nature into a casserole.

this is a very good soup, but it lives and dies by the sausage. if you can't get a really good, flavorful, oily pork sausage, the soup will be bland. i'm talking butcher shop, farmer's market, whole foods type sausage.

The most unique aspect of this recipe is that it does not call for adding any herbs or spices and seemingly expects the soup to derive all its flavor from the sausage and onion. Unfortunately, I don't think this quite works. Even with the generous amount of salt Chef John adds, the soup's flavor is extremely nondescript, less like a hearty sausage and vegetable stew and more like a simple creamy vegetable soup with the occasional chunk of sausage or greens. 
I strongly suggest adding some additional spice. I had cumin and hot sauce on hand and I thought they would bring out the sausage flavor, so I added them. The soup was better, but I wish I had known that the soup would need additional spices  when I was buying ingredients.
I used cauliflower in place of the potatoes and fresh chicken chorizo in place of the linguica. I don't think these substitutions are to blame for my dissatisfaction with the soup. Potatoes are hardly less bland than cauliflower, and I used a full pound of the chorizo, which should have compensated for much of the loss of flavor.

Made mine to specifications except I added a little bit of freshly ground black pepper and a little bit more than a shake-ah shake-ah of cayenne and didn’t do a good job of mashing my potatoes. Turned out amazing!

This soup is delicious, quick, easy, and nutritious.  I like to use Portuguese kale, a sweet, tender variety that grows like a weed in my garden.  Really assertively flavored sausages add a lot, but I've cooked a vegetarian version that was tasty as well.

Another great recipe by Chef John !  The pot seemed like more liquid was needed, particularly since I was a bit shy on the quantities for kale and potato.  But truly delicious!  Thank you!

So simple, easy, natural, and amazing flavor.  I used a local meat markets chicken sausage, but other than that I stayed true to the ingredients, and it's a family favorite.  Great way to get my kids to eat Kale!
