I had never made salad dressing before trying this recipe.  It was really easy and turned out sooooo good!  I will definately make this again.

This is an excellent recipe.  I made half the recipe because that's all I need.  Like others, I felt the full measure of sugar might be too much for my taste, so cut that in half again.  But instead of using sugar, I used 4 tablespoons of honey (with the rest of the ingredients halved).  IT WAS WONDERFUL.  I'll make this again and again.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe.

I was looking for a creamy basil salad dressing recipe when I came across this recipe and decided to try it.  First I cut the recipe in half and only used 1/2 of the sugar called for and onion salt instead of an onion.  I put everything in my food processor and added the canola oil a little at a time.  When it was completed I decided to add about twelve large basil leaves from our garden which had first been slivered.  OUT STANDTING TASTE and I loved the light green color.  I found my creamy basil recipe... so glad I found the original recipe.

Fabulous dressing - light and creamy.  I cut the servings down to 5 and put everything into a mini food processor in order to chop the onions down fine.  I used 3 tbsp. of sugar and instead of dry mustard I used 2 tsp. of dijon.

I just tried out this recipe for a 4th of July Get-Together and it was well received.  The dressing was super easy to make.  I used onion powder rather than fresh onion, and the taste was still great!  I still had dressing left this week and just used it to marinate boneless, skinless chicken breasts before I grilled them.  My husband commented on how good they were; they were juicy and tender with a touch of sweetness.  Just a bonus to find another use for this handy recipe!

This recipe is OUTSTANDING, EASY and FAST!! In fact, it's something I'd enjoy having in my frig at all times. I suggest finely chopping the onions, and in fact I put it all in my blender for about 3-4 seconds. (After all, nobody wants chunky salad dressing.) I served it with fresh spinach leaves and leafy red lettuce, then added sliced red onions and mandarin orange slices. Goodness, was it ever good! A real keeper for sure.

Hurray, Hurray for Shelly A. Just made this recipe in my food processor with 1/2 a medium to large sized onion. Mmmmm...... What a nice change. Can't wait to try on other salads besides greens. I'm going to share the extra portions if we don't hog down the whole recipe this week. Thanks again!! :')

EXCELLENT!! Made this in the food processor adding the oil last.  Used this on a spinach salad with croutons and grilled chicken and candied almonds. YUMMY! My favorite from now on. Thanks Shelly.

I made this recipe in the blender, pouring the oil in last very slowly...made for better emulsion.  It is sweet so I would suggest making a smaller portion to see if it is to your taste.  Overall, I liked it as a dressing very much and am looking forward to using as a marinade, as was suggested.

This is such a wonderful all-purpose salad dressing.  Every time I serve it for guests, they leave with the recipe.  I substitute onion powder for the chopped onion and omit the sesame seeds.  It's expecially good with mixed greens, nuts (walnuts or almonds) and fruit (craisins, grapefruit, or oranges) all tossed together.  I highly recommend this dressing!

This is truly "tasty."  My husband loved it.   A nice change from our usual oil and vinegar.  I make a batch of it and keep it in the frig. Yum. Yum.

The dressing is good.  I think it's a keeper.  I did as others suggested & halved the sugar.  I also used 1 tsp onion powder instead of an onion (no reason other than laziness).

I was rather disappointed in this recipe. It is very very sweet. I wish I had saved the ingredients. I will probably throw this dressing out if no one eats it, because I sure won't be eating it.

This dressing is wonderful, and I'll definitely make it again and again.  It's tangy and sweet and creamy, but not heavy.  I used light mayo and white vinegar, onion powder instead of chopped onion, and omitted the sesame seeds.  I also halved the recipe, and it still made plenty!

This dressing is delicious on mixed baby greens.
The only changes I made was that I used white vinegar instead of white wine vinegar and I omitted the sesame seeds.

This is a great recipe. The first time I made it, I halved it, to see how we liked it. It was gone in a flash. When the salad was gone, I was dipping anything I could find in this. I used balsamic vinegar which tasted great, but looked like watery chocolate milk. Thank you, Shelly!

Pretty good dressing! I cut the recipe in half since it'd only be two of us using it. Looking at the recipe I realized that it may be too sweet for our liking so I cut the amount of sugar in half. I also used extra lite olive oil instead of veg oil, dijon mustard instead of dry mustard, and I didn't use any sesame seeds because I didn't have them. I kind of wished I had used more onion and garlic because it tastes a little on the "Mayo" side, but over all is a good dressing.

Very good salad dressing.  I used baby greens, mandarin oranges, candied pecans, thinly sliced yellow pepper and tomato.  It was a hit with my family.

I thought this had a very interested taste, both nice and refreshing.  Was well liked by my guests and easy to put together.  I don't care for onion and cut the amount in half.  I also made only half of the recipe and it was about 2 cups of dressing, more than plenty for us!

It's like a sweet and sour with a little zip.  Love it!  Be prepared. It made about 4c of dressing so we have plenty for future salads. If you're just looking for a dressing for tonight though you may want to recalculate with fewer servings.

This was really good.  I used a little less oil and also less onion.  Tasted great on a salad we made out of a smattering CSA veggies.  Thanks!

I scaled this back to five servings, used red wine vinegar, canola oil in place of vegetable oil and agave nectar in place of the sugar.  I refridgerated for and hour, and served this over cubed tomatoes, cucumbers and fresh mozzarella cheese.  Nice flavor

We love the house dressing at our local diner, and were looking for something close to it - this is right on, but WAY better.  I made 1/4 recipe and added 2 tablespoons of honey - just the right blend of sweet, tangy and creamy, and not at all overpowering.  I did put the whole thing through our mini-food processor, though, since I'm too lazy to chop onions very finely.

I improvised and used red wine vinegar, not white, no sugar, (used half the amount of sugar in honey), and left out the mayo. Also used garlic and onion powders vs. fresh, was short on time. Nice!

4 stars because as written, this would be way too sweet. Cut down on the sugar for sure.  I think it might be even better if the sesame seeds were toasted, as in Jamie's Cranberry Spinach Salad dressing, which is phenomenal. I used garlic and onion powder instead of the real thing, out of sheer convenience.

I thought this was absolutely delicious! I didn't have white wine vinegar, so I used red, and it had an appealing raspberry dressing look. I had guests over, and they all loved it!  Just the right amount of sweetness that complimented my salad perfectly!

As written, this recipe was too sweet for our tastes. I squeezed in a little fresh lemon and that made it more to my liking, but my fiance didn't like it at all and opted for bottled dressing. Thanks for sharing! :)

I made this for dinner tonight and it was GREAT! Very light tasting. I did cut the sugar in half as suggested by other reviews and I used red wine vinegar as I didn't have any white. This is something I will make often.

Although this is not the absolute best salad dressing I have ever had, I did think it tasted good and find it appealing that everything ingredient I needed I already had to make the dressing.  This did end up being light tasting despite the oil and mayo, a good dressing if you like sweet dressing or bottled sweet vidalia onion salad dressing.

I just made this dressing for supper and it is mmm, mmm, good.  I scaled the recipe down to fit my dressing bottle. I must have used half the bottle myself.  I used it with my salad and as a sauce for my steak.  This is a definite keeper!

This Dressing is so awesome! I put it over lettuce with cucumber and tuna and it was simply delicious. I only used half of the recipe and for my taste half a cup of sugar was too little, so I added a bit, adding up to a bit less than 3/4 cups of white sugar in total. (HALF recipe! :) ) I also left out the onion and garlic and sesame seeds, out of pure lazyness. 
All in all, it´s a wonderful recipe and I will make it again!!

The only change I made was to replace the 1 cup of sugar with 1/2 cup of honey.  It was still pretty sweet, but not too much.  My normally picky husband loves this dressing.  We finished it up last night and asked me to make more so it would be available for him over the weekend!

This was a great base for me to follow I didn't need five cups of dressing and I was in a rush so I improvised by eyeing the amounts to create a smaller batch. I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and agave nectar instead of sugar. Tasted great I will definitely attempt to recreate it another time.

Nice, flavorful dressing. I used olive oil for better flavor and cut the sugar in half. I didn't want pieces of onion in my dressing (nor did I want to dirty my food processor) so I used dried onion flakes with excellent results. This makes loads - a recipe scaled down to 1/4 of the current one was plenty for my seven eaters.

This was great. I used 1/2 the amount of sugar out of preference and red wine vinegar because that is what I had on hand. Also used a whole onion. Loved it.

Was expecting a light and fresh taste, got it but its too rich to be called light. It is actually quite delectible. The flavors meld great, just think the dressing needs a more fitting title because of the richness.

Again, the flavors are amazing!

i made this today, it was amazing! just perfect! my dad hates salad dressings, he prefers eating the salad as it is without any additives but he fell in love with this one.
i read some reviews suggesting to decrease the amount of sugar, but i decided to go with the original recipe as a first try. i adjusted the recipe to 5 servings, which i sufficient for 2 or 3 days if serving 3-4 people.
i didnt want the dressing to be crunchy so i put everything in the blender except for the oil (i used olive oil btw instead of veg. oil), which i added later (following people's advice to keep a good emulsion in the fridge. i was out of sesame seeds, so i just made it without them. i also used regular vinegar rather than white wine vinegar.
i served a basic salad, and kept the dressing on the side. just perfect!
i especially loved its taste with carrots.

I really liked this, especially with toasted almonds and some fruit mixed in.  My husband doesn't like salads much, but really loves this dressing.  If it gets him to eat some fresh greens, it's worth it.  Just wondering if any healthier substitutions could be made?: honey or olive oil.

Wonderful! I cut down the sugar significanly (I actually used Splenda) and used onion powder instead of fresh onion, and I thought the tang of the vinegar was perfectly offset by the Splenda. I made three dressings today and this is my favorite!

I've been making this recipe for years but never got around to reviewing it.  Let me tell you, it is awesome.  I use apple cider vinegar instead of white wine vinegar though.  I am constantly asked for the recipe.  It does make a lot of dressing, but its so good you'll just keep buying salad to use it all.  By far, one of the best dressing recipes I've found.
