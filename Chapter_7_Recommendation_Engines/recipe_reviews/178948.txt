Great recipe! Very yummy!!!Modified it, didn't use frozen veggies.  Instead, sauteed 1/2 cup of chopped onions, 1 tsp crushed garlic, about 3 to 4 cups of fresh sliced mushrooms for a few min. Drained all the liquid added the raw chicken and cooked for about 3 minutes. Then, I added almost 1/2 cup of parmesan cheese, milk (with 1 - 2 tsp of corn starch mixed in as I didn't know if it would be thick enough) and cream of chicken soup, as I didn't have mushroom soup on hand, mixed it really well.  Added drained spaghetti (cooked just past the al dente stage or about 3 minutes less cooking time) and cooked until hot. Then I placed it in a 8" x 8" glass cooking dish that had been sprayed with vegetable spray. Placed crack pepper on top as well as about 1 to 2 tbsp of parmesan cheese and put in the oven for about 10 min. on 350 degrees & then broiled it for about 5 min. until the top was browned & the noodles came out crispy on top. This is a great dish where you can double the size, use as a make ahead meal & freeze it without baking and also put in smaller containers to reheat for lunch - much better & cheaper than the frozen store bought stuff. Just serve with a side salad, dinner roll and some dairy product and what a healthy meal. If you're a cheese lover like hubby & I , just watch the calories, I used a light version of parmesan. Recipe is a definite keeper! Off to the store to get more soup, chicken & mushrooms so I can make ahead to put in the freezer! Thanks!  Note:  If f

... egg noodles ... ?? The recipe ingredients says spaghetti and the two are actually NOT the same (egg noodles are something used in Asian cookery so I assume that the pasta is what was meant to appear in the ingredients list)? Anyway - please, please consider using salty in cooking the pasta. It is still healthy as the salt merely flavours the cooking water and provides a hint of seasoning ... without it this recipe is too bland and could really do with something to flavour it.  Alternatively, use a little homemade stock to cook the pasta.

well i just got done making this for dinner tonight on 2/5/2011 and gave it 4 stars because it lacks flavor.so... this is ok BUT with modifications it is good but you need to up the garlic powder and it does need salt and definitely more Parmesan cheese so i say go by taste  that's what i did or you will not like it because it is a little too bland without seasoning....oh and i used fettuccine noodles and not egg noodles to get the sauce to stick better to the noodles. And for my frozen vegetable blend i used the frozen California blend of carrots,broccoli, and cauliflower. I also still used cream of mushroom soup it called for but i used two cans and more milk to make it creamier.

I cooked the chicken in a skillet first with a light spray of Pam. Removed the chicken, and then cooked the sauce and veggies (fresh veggies) in the same pan. It helped with the flavor, but was still a little bland.  Added parmesan to garnish.  I think with a few modifications this recipe could be a real winner.

I did change the recipe a bit and it is quite lovely.  I added browned 1/2 pound of sliced fresh mushrooms, some 1/2 and 1/2 cream and a couple of dashes of dried tarragon.  I think you will find with these changes that the recipe rocks.  Good luck and do try it again,  Bev

This was really good!  It was easy to put together and it was a nice change to use spaghettii differently.  Although it was hard for my DH not to have his normal spaghetti with red sauce, he admitted he liked the meal alot....and I liked the leftovers for lunch the next day.

This was a pretty bland recipe, and I usually like my food somewhat bland.  I'm sure it could be decently spiced up but as is I wouldn't recommend it

I made this recipe for dinner tonight and I thought it was too bland. Almost no flavor at all. I ended up sprinkling it with crushed peppers and parmesan  cheese to make it edible. My fiance tasted it but did not want to eat it. My son was the only one who asked seconds (but he will usually eat anything he doesn't have to prepare himself.) This was not awful, just not good. I will probably not make it again.

This was delicious but indeed very bland.  I knew it would be, so that was no surprise.  A great way to get green veggies into little tummies :)

I gave this recipe a 4 because it turned out really well when I adjusted the recipe. If I had not changed the recipe it would have been really bland and would have probably gotten a 2 or a 3. I read the reviews on this dish before cooking it and decided to add some things so that my dish would not be bland. I used minced garlic instead of garlic powder and I added a cup of chicken broth to the cream of mushroom. I also added about 5 tbsp. of parmeson cheese vs. the 3 tbsp. in the recipe. I had to prepare my cooked chicken so I seasoned it with blackened seasoning and cooked it in the pan first with oil. After I cooked the chicken I poured the chicken and leftover oil into a bowl. I then added the milk, cream of mushroom, chicken broth, minced garlic,parmesan cheese, and the vegetables into the pan to cook. Once that cooked I added the chicken without oil back into the pan to be mixed with the other ingredients. I used the 2 fresh vegetable packs that I bought from the produce section because they had the cauliflower and broccoli, they were on sale, and there was not a frozen equivalent in the freezer section. To guard against the bland I put garlic pepper seasoning instead of salt in the water that I boiled my noodles in. I also used wheat noodles because I didn't want to open up a new box of spaghetti(white). If I could do it again I would season my chicken with a tiny pinch of salt and the blackened seasoning. Although very good my chicken was still to bland for my liking.

Rather boring, needed more flavor. Very easy to make. I might make this again for a quick week-night dinner but will be adding some red pepper flakes & garlic or what ever the mood calls for.

It was fairly good. I used regular generic store brand cream of mushroom soup, 1 tbs minced garlic instead of powdered, and only 8oz of frozen mixed veggies. I used the mixed veggies with lima beans, carrots, peas, and green beans in it. I also used egg noodles. The recipe was definitely good, but didn’t blow my socks off. I’d make it again as an easy work night dinner for sure.

Awesomely simple.  Good flavor, but I might add fresh garlic next time, and a bit more milk.  It became dry rather quickly.

Very nice idea as a base.  I made changes which I think added the flavor some thought lacking... I used cheese tortellini, shredded roasted chicken (left over from last night), broccoli and cauliflower, garlic (not powder), and pepper.  So fast!!!!  Picky daughter loved it, and this is going to now be in the rotation for weeknight quick dinners.

This recipe was decent. Nice and quick and easy, had a good amount of flavor, but didn't WOW me. I did change it up just to personal preference but I would make it again.

I used 1 can cream of Celery soup instead, we dont care for mushroom.
I used egg noodles instead of spaghetti
I seasoned with garlic, rosemary, and a seasoning blend
I also used a can of canned chicken as I was going for the quick/easy aspect.

Like I said, not awesome, but definitely a go-to weeknight meal.

Pretty good. I made a few changes as it seemed a bit plain. I cooked my chicken in a pan with some pepper and fresh garlic. I also used 10% cream instead of milk for the sauce. Added more pepper to the sauce itself and waited for it to thicken/heat before adding my vegetables. I added peas and sliced red/green peppers as well as the mixed veggies. Really good, and super easy. It definitely needed salt though.

I, too, changed a few things: fresh broccoli, sliced mushrooms and diced onion instead of frozen veggies. A bit of poultry seasoning. Then added the spaghetti noodles to the saucepan and allowed to simmer together for a few minutes - delightful!
