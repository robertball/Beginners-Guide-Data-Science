6.9.19 I know granola is supposed to be crunchy, but I hate it when it’s so hard and crunchy that it almost makes your gums bleed. I baked this for 20 minutes and found the texture exactly the way I like it. I’ve tried a number of granolas on this site, and this ranks right up there with the best of them, maybe even is the best recipe. Although very tasty, the cranberries baked up hard and dried out, and I was expecting more ginger flavor (could be just a matter of personal taste preference here). Next time, I may just eliminate the cranberries or try mixing them  into the granola after the first ten minutes of baking, since I do like that little bit of sweetness . Enjoyed today on a morning yogurt parfait with fresh fruit. Thanks for a great new granola recipe.
