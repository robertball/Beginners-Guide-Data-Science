I have made this recipe for years but a little different.  We brown the meat with onions..drain.  Then to a pot add the meat, 2 can of red kid beans, 2 small cans of tomato sauce, 1 can (use kid bean can) of water, and 1 pk of Taco Seasoning.
Then after bringing to a boil and simmering for 15 minutes it is done.  Add soup to a bowl then top with Frito corn chips, cheese, and sour cream.
My DH is military and when he was in Korea he made this and EVERYONE loved it.  My kids love it also and want it every night!

Dee-lish, super simple and quicker than chili.  My tweaks:  Needed entire packet of taco seasoning and added a can of black beans.  Topped with crushed tortilla chips, cheddar cheese, sour cream and green onions.

This soup was excellent - I left out the corn, beans, and onion (picky family) but it still turned out great. I also chopped a fresh tomato and added it, and that added a little more substance to the soup without the other ingredients. This is a great easy soup to make at night when you don't want to spend a ton of time cooking! We eat it with cheese melted on top, sour cream, and avocado slices, with tortilla chips and it is SO yummy!

This was sooo yummy! I did change a little though. Instead of tomatoe juice I used beef broth and instead of tomatoe sauce I used canned crushed tomatoes.

Really really good! Thanks for sharing!

I guess if you can't make up your mind about whether to have chili or tacos, you can just have both with this recipe!  It wouldn't have been nearly as good if I hadn't added a tablespoon of cayenne pepper.  Next time I think I will add a can of green chiles and some diced tomatoes as well. The cheese is a must.

I made this for a job potluck and it was a hit.  It's requested quite often.  This was just spicy enough for me.  A person who doesn't like real spicy foods.

This recipe was ok but bland.  Do add the whole taco seasoning packet and extras, ie. sour cream, chips, avacado etc.  My big gripe with this recipe is it's lack of detail.  i.e. canned corn (drained or undrained) etc.

This was so easy and quick to prepare!  It was a huge hit.  I added more meat (1/2 lb),  swapped tomatoes with chilis for tomato sauce  and added a strong cup of beef broth.  I served this with grated quesadilla cheese, sour cream and fried tortilla strips.  And of course, a margarita!!!!  Thank you Becca

This soup was ok, but not great.  I felt it was too "soupy" and would use less tomato juice next time.  I also used the entire packet of taco seasoning.  Next time I would also probably use chili beans instead of kidney beans.  It just didn't have enough kick. Cheese and sour cream on top to serve is a must.

This was ok...husband rate 2.5 but son really liked it, so I gave it a three.  Followed recipe exactly.  I thought it was somewhat bland and not very special.  Probably will not make again.

This is our go-to recipe for when my b/f's 11yo daughter is over.  It's always a hit.  And that's saying a lot.  We just throw a little mexi-cheese & sour cream on top, and have it with corn chips. Yummy!

Becca You ROCK! This soup is awesome! I did change it a bit from some of the reviews but I feel sure that even if it is prepared just as you have it that it would be just perfect. The changes I made were to add beef broth instead of the tomato sauce and I pureed canned tomatoes instead of tomato juice so it would have a heartier consistency. I also added 1/2 the taco mis to the burger when I browned it and then used the remaining as your recipe instructs. Then I made a couple of servings of white rice and added it in at the end. So it was quite a bit thicker than your recipe would make, I'm sure but we all ate it until we were about to pop. Thank you! I am sure I will make this alot. By the way it's really easy and you would generally have all of this stuff on hand in a typical kitchen anyway which is MAJOR bonus points for me. I HATE having to prepare and shop especially for a recipe. BECCA ROCKS!

Very good soup. Followed to a T, until I realized I forgot the onions and had to do a quick saute on some. And add into the soup. I doubled the recipe as I do most recipes because of my family size. Recipe was simple and nice, a very familiar tasting recipe I've had before, just minus the fact of no stewed tomatoes. I will say it could used a little more umph to it. Spiked with either more taco seasoning or seasoned stewed tomatoes or rather a can of Rotel. But over all it was nice.

This is one of my favorite soups of all time.  The changes I made were adding a can of diced green chillies, 10 or so shakes of green tobasco sauce, a can of black beans, some chili powder, cumin and added another package of taco seasoning.

Very easy and very filling. I added black beans and a pepper. I also made rice and put the rice in the bowl first and then soup on top, kinda like the do at Qdoba and chipotle. The only thing i will look to change is to add more flavor, not sure if i will use a differ taco seasoning pack or use more spices.

This soup is really good and an excellent, kid-friendly, quick supper. I made it just like the recipe says and it turned out great. Topping it with shredded cheddar and sour cream is a must...it just really blends the flavors and kicks it up!

This was a very good basic recipe.  The instructions were a tad vague, but most people should be able to figure it out.  I added some salt, pepper, and chili powder to the meat and onions.  I also added the full packet of taco seasoning mix.  To the toppings I added a bottle of hot sauce, in case someone wanted it a bit spicier.  It is very easy to customize.  I will definitely make this again!

Yum! Skipped the corn-just don't care for it.  Added other veggies-garlic, celery, carrots, peppers and shredded cabbage and another can of beans (black).  Like using the tomato juice.  Served over tortilla chips and topped with shredded cheese.

I substituted the ground beef with ground turkey to make this healthier, and man was it good! I changed a few other things. (not to be a jerk, but because I'm out of a few ingredients) I used 1 can of reduced sodium condensed tomato soup, 1 8oz can of tomato sauce, 1 can of Rotel with chilies, and added 2 minced garlic cloves. The Rotel didn't make it spicy enough for us (my family loves hot food!) so I also added about a tsp of hot sauce. Yum! I will definitely be making this again and again :)

I veganized this recipe:) Instead of ground beef, I used Yves veggie ground round. I added 1/2 green pepper, diced & 1 can of black beans as well.....I didn't drain either beans or the corn. Just open the cans & dump in the pot. Ladle soup into a bowl & crush some tortillas on top. This is delicious!

What a GREAT soup for a cold night!  I have to say, I kicked it up quite a bit with about a tablespoon of Cayenne pepper, tobasco sauce, red pepper flakes, and a can of green chiles and some jalapenos. I also used the whole packet of taco seasoning. I took someone else's recommendation and substituted some of the tomato juice with tomato soup (I had extra in the pantry).  Served with multigrain tostitos.  My husband pretty much ate it like a dip with chips... either way, we both LOVED it. Thanks for the great recipe!

I gave this only 2 stars as I think it's NOT a very good taco soup.  BUT, it's a great chili!  I made as listed and it needed ALOT more spicy/mexican flavoring for it to be more of a TACO SOUP.  I served this with shredded cheese, sour cream and served this over Frito's.  Good as a chili, though not my FAV chili recipe. I will not make this again.

This was an AWESOME soup...instead of kidney beans (I was out) I used black beans, added diced red and green peppers, and since I can, I used 1/4 a pint of our hot salsa, then topped with a taco and shredded cheddar cheese.  I did look at the other reviews and found adding a full package of taco seasoning was a good idea.  Next time, I'll use a 1/2 pint of the salsa to make the soup spicier.  AWESOME recipe!

I thought this was very good.  I made substitutions based upon what I had on hand.  Instead of the tomato sauce, I used about 6 oz of tomato paste.  I also added a can of black beans and blackeye peas.  Based on another reviewers suggestion I added the entire package of taco seasoning.  It was really excellent.

This was easy and very tasty. I didn't realize that it only called for half of the taco seasoning packet, and I used the entire packet - I think it definitely needs the entire packet.

The only change I made was adding the entire package of taco seasoning instead of half.  We really liked it!  I served it with tortilla chips, shredded cheese and sour cream.  Very easy to make.

This is one of my absolute favorite recipes. It is a delicious and easy one-pot-wonder! I like to add one envelope of dry ranch dressing mix as well. Top with sour cream, cheese, and crushed tortilla or corn chips and it is a fabulous meal!

A friend of mine turned me on to this recipe, which I've made many times.  We've always added a packet of Hidden Valley Ranch dressing mix.  I think it really makes a difference.

I make mine a bit different. I use the same amount of beef and onion, then add 1 can of pinto beans, 1 can of kidney beans, 2 cans of diced tomatoes with green chiles (Rotel), 1 package of taco seasoning mix, 1 package Ranch dressing mix, 1 cup water and a whole package of frozen corn. It takes minutes to come together and it's great served over tortilla chips (baked or regular) topped with cheddar cheese.

Great!!  I added some extra tomato sauce, extra cayenne pepper, and almost the entire taco seasoning packet.  I added a cup of beef stock for every serving to make it more "soupy."  I used black beans instead of kidney beans and V-8 for the tomato juice.  I also added some fajita seasoning, garlic, and cayenne pepper to the meat while it was browning.  It gave the meat some pep.  My husband absolutely loved it!

I was a little disappointed in this recipe.  It tasted more like chili than taco's.  For chili it was good but was missing the taco flavor that I was hopeing for.  It had a big tomato flavor to it.  I added the whole packet of taco seasoning and more cumin to get a more taco flavor but it didn't work.  I don't know if beef broth along with some tomato juice would help or not. The cheese, chips and sour cream on top was a big plus.  I may try again but with definate changes.

I used chili beans instead of kidney and also added a can of northen beans. I too added a dash of cumin as well as a chopped green bell pepper.  The funny thing is, although this recipe has almost completely different ingrediants, the taste was similar to a chili recipe I have always owned/used. So yes, this is a good soup, but since it tasted so much like one I have always made...thus, I was not pleasantly surprised.  IT IS STILL A GOOD SOUP but it tastes so much like one I already own. To others: this recipe is so easy, it's worth a try and very adjustable to your tastes. Thanks Becca!

I love this soup!!! I serve it with crushed up tortilla chips on top and some shredded cheese. Excelent.

(those of us who like spicy foods will want to add our favorite hot sauce to the mix!)

We love this recipe!  I do it with either chicken or beef, depending on my mood.  I use the full packet of taco seasoning and prefer chili beans, which add a nice kick.  I also use vegetable juice instead of tomato juice (which happened by accident because hubby bought the wrong one) and love the flavor.  It's a great base recipe to tweak to your own tastes and preferences.

I've made this soup so many times and I keep changing it.  My favorite one so far is...substitute a can of hominy for the corn, add some jalapeno slices (from a jar) and use crushed or stewed tomatoes.  Garnish w/ cheese.

I made this, with leftover taco meat that no one felt like facing from yesterday.. I used white beans because that was all I had, and I looked up homemade taco seasonings and added some spices from that along with more water to stretch it. It was so yummy!

Shockingly good.  My dad has been pushing me for awhile to find a tco soup recipe.  But I don't like onions or corn in soup so I have been hesitant.  I made this tonight using two cups of tomatoe juice and two cups (1 can) of beef broth.  I also added a few TBSP of Southwestern Seasoning.  We served it by plopping some light sour cream in it, some Mexican blend shredded cheese, stirring it then crunching up a handful of tostitoes.  I was shocked by how good it was.  Everyone was.  I also made cornbread muffins which were perfect to soak up some extra sauce with.  It was thin...but that's how I like my soup.  I cut the onions big so I could pick them out and then I just ate the corn in it...it was too good to pick out.  Great suprise recipe.  Thanks Becca...

I use this recipe all the time now, it's been years. It's a great base, though I do change it to shredded chicken instead of hamburger. I boil the chicken with lime, cilantro and sea salt. I also use black beans instead of kidney, but everything else is the same! I love love this soup!

The soup was a little too thick for my liking.  I added water and it seemed to weaken the taste.  I will use the entire package of taco seasoning next time with about 2 cups water.  This was very good.

This is very much a favorite recipe at our house - especially during the winter months.  I do double the taco seasoning & buy the spicy flavor too.  The spicier the better at our house.

This recipe was awesome, and easy! I used everything, but left out the onion, and used less tomato sauce and more stewed tomatoes. It was a hit! It got eaten more than anything else, and my aunt even had 2 bowls of it!

This was good and easy to make. I did change up the recipe a bit. I used 33 ounces of V8 and a whole pack of taco seasoning. I also used onion powder instead of onions. I followed the rest of the recipe as written. I cooked this in my crockpot instead of on the stove. This had a nice flavor to it. I topped ours with cheddar cheese.

This recipe was really good! The only variation I made was that I added extra corn just because I love corn. I also topped the bowls with just a little but of mexican shredded cheese. YUM.

Yum. I tweaked the recipe just a bit. I only put in 2 cups of tomato juice and instead put about 12 ounces of tomato sauce and some Mexican style diced tomatoes in. I also put about 3/4 of the taco seasoning in. Top it off with Mexi style cheese and some sour cream. . . YUM!

My family, which includes a 4 year old and a 9 year old, LOVED it! !  I didn't have tomato juice, so I used a combo of tomato sauce and chicken broth in equal parts. It turned out great.....I'll be making again soon!

One of my families favorites. I substitute ground turkey for ground beef to save on calories/fat.  I also don't use the onion (I don't care for them) and it still turns out phenomenal.  Using turkey in this recipe (1.4 lbs) I've calculated the nutrition per serving of 1 cup to be: 226 calories, 5 grams fat, 9 fiber and 4 points (for you WW gals). You definitely need to try this!

I made this last night for my grease craving, fatty burger loving, french fry consuming family... and believe it or not they loved it which surprised me.  Even my brothers who insist on dishes such as burgers with only cheese, meat only tacos, and no vegetables whatsoever LOVED IT.  I doubled the recipe and added two taco seasonings and also added a packet of dry ranch dressing mix which was just what the soup needed.  If you're not doubling, then I suggest only using half of the ranch or it can get tangy.  Also, while browning the meat with the onions I added one packet of the taco seasoning just so it could cook into the meat right away instead of soaking into it overnight.  Delish!

My husband and I LOVE this soup! I usually use 1 1/2 pounds of extra lean ground sirloin and mexi corn. When it's ready to serve, I also offer shredded cheddar cheese, sour cream and plain Doritos. Awesome stuff! Thanks, Becca!

WONDERFUL soup!  And it is filling, which was very surprising!  Definitely recommend if you are on a tight budget and tight time.  We were eating 1/2 an hour after starting to make it.  Great for families!

Very good recipe, thank you.  I cut this recipe in half and served with Golden Sweet Cornbread from this site and got rave reviews from my husband.  I will make this again, great for a crowd if you want to make it as is or double it. I also added some chopped zucchini so it had something green in it.

I got this recipe from my exboyfriend, and I was worried I'd never find it again! It's almsost identical to this one, except without the onion or the beans. I absolutely love this soup! we put tortillas in the bowl, ladle soup over them, put cheese and sour cream on top of that. HEAVENLY! Thanks becca, for helping me rediscover one of my favorite foods!

nice and easy family pleasing. My kids are 9 and 10 and they really love it. I did not have tomato juice so i used 2 (15 oz) cans of sauce and a large can (28 oz) of diced tomatoes. I also doubled the meat and added a diced orange bell pepper. i also added some garlic powder.
You can serve it as is then add extra chili powder if you like it hot. We added grated cheddar cheese and a few doritos to the top.

It is a pretty good recipe. It was very tomatoey. I'd use more of the taco mix. I'd add more beans and possibly olives as a garnish, and use a smaller amount of onion.

Enjoyed it! I didn't have taco seasoning mix, so I added my own other spices (and lots of them! I like lots of flavour!), and I also didn't have kidney beans, so I substituted that with green beans. It was good, and I would make it again!

I used black beans in medium sauce, 3 cans of diced tomatoes instead of the tomato juice and the entire package of taco seasoning. I did drain the corn, but not the tomatoes. It was very easy and delicious! I will definitely make it again.

Love this-easy and good but with a tweak or 2. I use 4 cups of V-8 juice to kick it up a little-also omit kidney beans and use black beans instead. Top with corn chips and sour cream and shredded Mexican cheese.

I loved this soup!  Just what I needed on this cold day!  I found 1/2 pkt. taco seasoning was just right.  I was a little worried about what some said about the tomato juice so I only used two cups and two cups of water with a bouillon cube and it's terrific!  Thanks!!

Good recipe. You can add and or remove ingredients to your taste. Or just fine as it is. I prefer to add a bit of hot sauce. Sour cream corn chips and cheddar cheese are must haves for a topping. Cheers.

I made this soup the other day and it was awesome! I did add a few things that really made it even better. I used the whole package of taco seasoning, 1 15oz can of black beans, a few dashes of cayenne pepper, and a can of Rotel. I topped the finished soup with shredded cheddar cheese, soup cream, and tortilla strips! So awesome!

Made this recipe tonight and added the entire packet of taco seasoning. Other than that, prepared as directed. We loved it! Will definitely make again. Only took us 15 minutes to make. Quick, yummy dinner. Could easily be a slow cooker meal.

This recipe is delicious! It makes a large pot, so as a family of 2 we will have leftovers for awhile (fine by me!). I made a few changes. Instead of kidney beans, I used a can of porknbeans and instead of tomato sauce I used a can of tomato soup. Also I used more like 3/4 pkg of taco seasoning rather than half.   Hint: if you are wanting a thicker soup, use less tomato juice or add a little bit of cornstarch

So good! I made a huge pot and my husband and I (mostly him) managed to finish the entire thing. He could just not get enough! I made a few changes according to what I had in the house- used diced tomatoes in juice instead of tomato sauce, and chicken broth instead of tomato juice- we like thick soups so I didn't use a lot. Also, we only had cream style corn so I used that and it was fine. I used a whole packet of taco seasoning and also added garlic, salt, pepper, and cumin. We didn't have tortilla chips so we ate it with heated up tacos! Was delicious!

Very good. I took some of the advice offered here and used half tomato juice and half beef broth. Served with sour cream and Fritos (for the kids). They loved it!

Loved this!  Very quick and very good.  Used ground turkey, and couldn't tell.  Will make a lot this winter! Thanks for the recipe.

This was very easy to make, and overall was okay.  It was, however, too sweet and bland.

In the cooler months, we fix this at least once every two weeks and serve it with sour cream.  IT'S A MAJOR HIT!  So easy, fast, delicious!  Even great for camping!

This was very good. It ends up like a chili. I added a full packet of Taco seasoning just as others have done. We served it with cheddar cheese and lime tortilla chips. It's quite filling.

Good soup... I added chopped green chilis, quite a bit of cumin, and a little cayenne pepper.  I didn't have tomato juice, so used a 16-oz. can of tomato sauce and about 2 cups water.  My family loved it!

Like many other reviewers, I used V8 instead of the tomato juice and black beans instead of kidney beans.  I also added a little cayenne pepper and garlic to give it some kick.  Instead of ground beef, I used MorningStar veggie crumbles since I am vegetarian.  The soup (more like a stew or a chili) is absolutely delicious and was insanely easy to prepare.  Yum!!

Except for leaving out the onions, which I always do, I made this as is.  I expected it to be more spicy, but once I realized it wasn't going to be, I took it for what it was and thought it was pretty good.  It's a good chili substitute for those who don't like things overly spicy.  (I do wonder about *renaming* it though. :-))  I didn't find it particularly filling.

This was excellent.  I did reduce the tomato juice by a little bit (probably about 3 1/2 cups instead of 4) and added diced green chiles as someone else suggesed.  Add a little cheese and some fat free sour cream and it's a quick, healthy dinner that's low in WW points.

I would call this a chili rather than a taco soup, but it is very good. A great soup to slowly cook and enjoy on a cold day.
