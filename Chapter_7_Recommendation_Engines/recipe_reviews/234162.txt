Basically, I followed the recipe as stated.  I noticed at once the lack of regular sugar and should have followed my instinct to add some type of extra sweetner.  I will possibly try to improve next time.  Also, I knew that  it would make  2 loaf pans.  So I am going to add some cinnamon/sugar  to this batch of loafs once sliced.

I would run the raspberries through a sieve the next time, as the seeds are a huge bother and get stuck in my teeth, or just use cranberries.  The flavor was great.
