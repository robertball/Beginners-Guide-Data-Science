This was just plain weird. I am Swedish and we have Limpa bread every Christmas. I decided to try making my own this year and did this recipe first. I thought the addition of cumin was strange from the get-go and I was right. Cumin is NOT a scandinavian spice. If you want authentic Limpa, leave out the cumin and add anise instead. I found a better recipe that used brown sugar, molassas, caraway, anise, fennel and orange juice. That one came out perfect.

I've tried other recipes here and this is the best of the best. Makes for a very yummy whole grain type bread with everything you need for nutrition not to mention a great taste. Takes a little time,  but its worth it.Made it with as is ingredients, I like the whole wheat instead of rye.

besides the cumin which being Swedish one would never use Anise as all the others is the spice of choice. Use Rye flour if you can get it makes all the difference.

I also am Swedish, I elimated the cracked wheat and used whole wheat bread flour instead of the rye since Rye flour is impossible to get where I live. And I don't know where the "cumin" came in there but I basically followed the recipe but used the following seeds: Fennel, carraway, and Anise. My bread came out wonderful!!!!

I used coarsely chopped rye berries instead of the cracked wheat, and cooked the bread in a greased pie pan at 350 for 45 minutes. Wonderful flavor bread!  Thanks for the recipe!
