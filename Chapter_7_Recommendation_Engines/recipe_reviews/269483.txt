We had these with oven-baked fish and lemon mayo (stir lemon juice and lemon zest into mayo to taste), and they complemented each other perfectly. I added 1 T of the kimchi brine to the egg dip for the fish. Next time, I'll cut back on the flour; I couldn't get the pancakes as thin as I would like. Also, when Chef John says chop the kimchi, do it! I rushed through that part, and it was impossible to cut a piece from the pancake without pulling out long bits of cabbage. Next time, I'll probably run it through the mini-food processor to get a finer chop.

OMG these are so good! I make them a couple of times per month for dinner, topping them with fried eggs. I took chef John's advice and add whatever vegetables I have in the fridge and sautee them first. I've sauteed leftover spring mix, mushrooms,  broccoli, peppers, spinach and let it cool first before adding to the rest of the ingredients. Any veggies works, really. I make it all in the food processor making sure not to over process otherwise it turns to mush. You still want some texture to them.  Definitely something to try if you're looking for something different to make.
