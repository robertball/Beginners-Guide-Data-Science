I am originally from the Dominican Republic and just to give out a tiny little secret to getting rid of most of the sliminess of okras... If you place them in just enough cold water to cover and squeeze an entire lime into the water and lime juice and just let it sit for about 10-15 minutes, then drain and season to please, I promise it will lose most of the slimy texture you get when stewing, etc...  Hope this helps  :-)

Mercy me, these were delicious.  I cut a few okra up, splashed a little olive oil in the bowl, sprinkled a little seasoning salt on them, tossed and spread in a pan along side sliced zucchini.  I rarely fry foods, so this was a terrific substitute for fried okra.  Keep in mind that the longer you cook it, the smaller it shrinks, so what you think will serve four could end up being barely enough for 2.

This was delicious!!! I grow vegetables on the deck outside of my apartment and I have one okra plant (these plants grow Tall!, mine is over my head, I'm 5'4", soon I will need a ladder to pick it:). Since there is only one of me, the one plant provides enough okra so that I need to prepare something every 4 days or so. I always loved it stewed with tomatoes and onions, but I am afraid your recipe has won me over. Love the intense flavor the roasting gives it and you are right, it is less "wet":)I did use my combo of tomatoes and onions, but roasted them along with the okra...awesome! I sliced my okra, made thick slices of onion, and halved a small tomato, sprinkled with choppped fresh basil (from my deck garden also), drizzled all with olive oil, seasoned them with Old Bay and just a touch of salt and pepper. I put a shaving of fresh parmesan on my tomato and baked it as directed. Absolutely awesome!!!

This is an excellent way to prepare okra. I just recently roasted okra to help my mom with favorite foods as she is a diabetic. I roasted mine longer than the recipe calls for to dry it out and then continued to roast until it was crisp, propably 40 minutes total. I had a complete bread pan full and when I took it up it looked and tasted like fried okra, it was awesome!!

This is so simple and easy.  Folks that usually don't like okra rave about it.  I cut the okra into thirds and then toss and roast.  Can be done in toaster oven too.

My family loves okra, as long as its not slimy. We eat it steamed (whole), fried or pickled.  This recipe is the best okra recipe I have ever used. I don't believe I'll ever cook okra any other way. In addition to the okra, I included sliced fresh mushrooms and sliced white onions and used habanero infused olive oil.  The amount of salt called for in the recipe is way too much for the amount of okra listed, but that is a personal preference.  I mixed everything together in a large bowl then emptied it all on to a foil lined baking sheet and roasted as directed.  It had the best texture and flavor and NO slime. Great recipe.

So good! All the flavor of fried okra without the deep fried aspect. I put EVOO in a bowl and dumped in the sliced okra and sprinkled with seasoned salt. Hand tossed and baked for 20 minutes on a cookie sheet that I lined with foil and sprayed with Pam. Easy clean up. Yummmm...

Excellent!  Thank you so much for sharing with us this simple way of preparing okra!  I was looking for a way to fix some wonderful okra I had just purchased from the farmer's market and this was exactly the way I like to prepare many veggies, but I never would have thought of for okra.  As many reviewers have already stated, it took the "sliminess" out of it and crisped it up.  Do not hesitate to try this ridiculously simple recipe!!  Thank you again for sharing!

In a bowl, I mixed the olive oil with balsamic vinager, garlic powder and salt, added quartered,  halved small (seeded) tomatoes, a chopped onion and the okra and tossed to coat. I baked it on a cookie sheet until the vinegar carmalized, then lightly sprinkled it with shredded parmesean cheese  and returned it to the oven for 5 minutes to melt. I served with this with parmesean cheese crisps on the side (teaspoons of parmesean flattened out on a cookie sheet and baked 5 minutes until crispy).
One bite and... WaLa! A 5 star yum! Thank you for this most wonderful idea! I will make it again.

I do this with frozen okra that I rinse off and dry it off with paper towels before following the directions. No slime and perfect.

we love the clean okra flavor that is usually somewhat covered by breading. Big fan of baking versus frying

I always cook a recipe by the instructions the first go round.  This one turned out good, and offers a healthy alternative to the fried okra I normally fix, however it was definitely way too salty for my tastes.  I will cut the salt in about half next time.  Might add some seasoned salt or Tony's to see how that turns out.  Also, I will combine everything in a zip lock back to get a more even coat, rather than sprinkling it on the okra on the baking pan.

Very good and super easy!  I have been roasting okra (and every other vegetable) like this for years.  I don't even bother with the slicing - I just roast them whole.

I was not expecting how much I was going to love these!  They are like little toasty bits of heaven!  I think they are just as good as fried okra if not better....and fewer calories!  Thanks...I will always do my okra this way!

Loved it! I also kept mine in for longer to make them hard and crispy (about 40 minutes). Good substitute for french fries when made crunchy!

Being a fried okra lover, I was at first hesitant to "waste" good okra by roasting it this way. However, since this recipe is almost identical to a recipe I love using quartered brussel sprouts, I tried it. Now, it may be a offensive to my southern roots, but I think I it's much better than fried. My only suggestion is don't pay so much attention to the length of time they cook. Just keep roasting them until they are browned and turning crisp.

Because of this recipe, I can now honestly say I have never met a vegetable I don't like. Almost all of the slimeyness that turned me off from okra in the first place was completely eliminated between the roasting process and soaking the okra in acidic water (as some reviewers suggested). The resulting texture was toothsome and silky at the same time. Delicious!

THE BOMB!!!!  This is by far the easiest and tastiest recipe for okra.  We grow a massive crop of these each year and usually blanch and freeze or smother our okra, but we are delighted to have added a new way to use the abundant okra we grow.  Never frying our okra again.  THANK YOU SO MUCH for sharing this WONDERFUL recipe!!

I rarely see fresh okra where I live. So when I saw some fresh okra at a real good price on a trip, I bought some just to try this recipe cause I really like okra(at least the ones I tried). After coming back home though, I totally forgot about them and when I remembered, they were going bad already. Feeling kinda lazy, I was tempted to just throw them away but I forced myself to give this recipe a shot since it was really easy. I am SO glad I did. It was really easy and only took a couple of minutes to prepare. I cooked about 30 mins at 425 and they were just so good. Since I was cooking bbq chicken for dinner, I was just going to taste a couple but I couldn't stop once I started eating. I was worried about sliminess but it wasn't so bad. Or maybe I just don't mind that so much.I guess it never really bothered me before either which is kinda funny cause I'm usually really picky about stuff like that. Now I'm really wondering if I should plant okra this year. ^^ I should try with frozen ones and see if they come out as good.

Fantastic. Tastes remarkably like French fries! I'm an okra hater from way back, so this was a revelation. Make sure to cut both ends off the okra and dry thoroughly after rinsing. I also made a few minor changes to ensure there was no slime: I wiped the foil pan lining with oil as if greasing a cake pan, drizzled the okra with oil, tossed them around to make sure all were coated, sprinkled them with Adobo seasoning, garlic powder and pepper. I placed them on the center rack of the oven and roasted them for 35 minutes rather than the 10 - 15 in the recipe. They get brown and crispy but still soft on the inside and NO SLIME. Be advised, though- they shrink in size by half, so make sure you cook enough. My kids love them cooked this way and ask for them often.

Best Okra I have ever eaten. I baked 10 minutes: dry, trimmed okra, dribbled with lime juice and added light Pam on the baking sheet. 400 degrees for 10 minutes or so. Broiled 10 minutes till fork tender then finished in a hot, dry skillet for another 10 minutes. Got nice brown grill marks in the pan, threw on a plate with Himalayan pink salt and it was THE BEST Okra I have ever eaten. zero slime, tender and flavorful. My husband is going back to the same farmers stand tomrrow and getting more okra. Another cook suggested the lime juice and no salt till done. Also, okra should be completely DRY. Wash it one day and eat it the next day, or if you trust the farmer, as I do, don't even wash it at all.

I love, love, love this recipe.  It is easy and delicious. I usually cut them into 1 inch pieces and roast them a little longer until they are nice and toasty brown. I've tried it with fresh okra and frozen okra.  Fresh okra is definitely better.

So slimy!  And I tried the suggestion to soak them in water and a ton of lime juice too!  Maybe I am just not an okra person...

This is a great easy recipe for okra-- as long as you don't slice it. If you roast the okra whole (or grill, stew, etc.), the slime factor is practically eliminated.

Fantastic recipe. The KEY is to get as many brown bits as you can. The browner the better, really. This is also great with asparagus, acorn (any other winter) squash and green beans. Obviously, you adjust the timing for different veggies. Let the browning guide you. My kids eat the green beans like french fries - with their fingers. Seriously, the BROWNER the better :-)

Roasting okra, who would have guessed?!  I used a LOT less salt and pepper than called for - about 1/2-3/4 tsp each for 30 okra pods - and I used hickory smoked sea salt instead of plain salt.  The hickory smoke flavor was beautiful with the okra.  Thanks for sharing this technique!  I'll be using it again and again while okra is in season.

Good, but I only had frozen okra on hand since it's out of season now. Yeah.... don't use frozen. Mine didn't come out very "roasted," although it was still good. I sprinkled mine with just pepper and cajun seasoning. Thanks, ncope.

So delicious and easy, and much better for you than fried okra!  I usually coat my okra in a little cornmeal and saute in Pam and/or olive oil, but this roasted okra is equally delicious.  The flavor of the okra really comes through, and it is not at all slimy!  I will make this all the time - thanks!

I have loved okra my whole life, but have only eaten it 2 ways--breaded then deep fried or in stew-like dishes. This way is my new favorite! My kids had never had okra so I tried this as their introduction & they liked it too! Because I know okra tends to be slimey, I could detect it slightly. But my kids didn't notice at all--and they were definitely disecting each and every pod on their plates to begin with! Now I have a way to prepare one of my favorite vegetables without all the mess or time!

The guys gave these a big thumbs up. I used whole frozen okra and sliced myself. Just sprinkled a little salt and pepper on them, 2 tsps seems like an awful lot. I stirred them to keep from sticking every 7 or 8 minutes, they browned up nicely. I probably cooked them around 20 minutes until they got as browned as I liked them. They were plenty salty with just a sprinkle of salt. I was hesitant to try this, but it worked great! Thanks for the recipe.

I'm not sure how big everyone else's okra pods were, but mine looked normal, about 4 inches in length, and 2 tsp of course kosher salt was way too much, even after I had bumped up the amount of pods to about 25 and only used about 1.5 tsp. I'll make this again, but with 1 tsp of salt or less. Same for the pepper it was actually spicy and while I like spicy, it was a bit overwhelming.

Can you say yummm?  Great recipe...  I saw the review that said too much salt.  Sounds true. I never measure salt or pepper, so I didn't notice.  I think it's better to toss olive oil, salt pepper in bowl rather than drizzling...  My preference...

I have never eaten okra that wasn't fried or mixed in a gumbo, so I was very skeptical about a recipe that was so easy with such great reviews.  I was thrilled with the taste of this okra!  It was just as delicious as fried okra and is a calorie savings of about 140 calories per serving.  I followed other reviewers and shook the okra, oil, salt, and pepper in a large bowl and put it on a baking sheet covered with foil (didn't spray the foil first).  I baked them for about 20 minutes.  I started with the amount of okra the recipe called for and could tell it was not enough for 2 adults and a serious okra loving 3 year old.   I doubled the amount of okra and pepper, but kept the oil and salt to the recipe's specifications and it was SUPER!   If you are a skeptical fried okra lover, take a chance and give this recipe a try - I know I'm glad I did.   Thanks for posting such a great and simple side dish.

Yummo!   I love to roast vegetables, but honestly would have never thought to roast okra.  I roasted the whole pod, and then simply munched on them, tossing the stem.  Ate them hot and cold....Definately will make again!

This was fabulous!  I roasted mine a bit longer to see if it would get crispy.  It did a little bit.  It was delicious.  This was the easiest way I have ever prepared Okra.

Even easier, if you are grilling outside, such as steak, chicken, pork, etc, just take whole pods and grill them along side the main dish.  They come out slightly chewy (dry) with a nice smoky flavor.

I love to make okra like this - it is like fried without the guilt.  It shouldn't be slimy if you cook it at 425 until it starts to brown.  You can add some minced garlic if desired.

Being a good southern girl, I have always had my okra fried.  I tried this tonight in my quest for a healthier alternative.  It was a huge hit with the kids, fighting over the last few pods.  I didn't slice them, just cut off the tops.  Will definitely make again.

7.25.12 ...https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/204478/roasted-okra/ ...  Using okra not more than a little bigger than your pinky finger is usual size - at least in the South.  Apparently, this recipe goes for bigger, which is fine; but remember to use less spices if yours are little.  I prefer measurement. I had almost four cups cut okra so doubled the spice amounts.  Too much by far.  Yeah, I ate it; but I'll use try four cups with two teaspoons each next time.  'Could try it halfway done to add more.  I roasted mine for more than a half hour & it was good.  Definately fried tasting.  'Nice getting away from the usual boiled.  Hate those slimy pots!  :D

This is our new favorite way to eat okra. It's quick and easy (and not so slimy) & not greasy. We have a slew of okra in our garden, and it's nice to have a go to recipe that is so easy & tastes delicious! It's also very versatile. You can add different seasonings for a different twist. I've shared this with family that I give okra to, & they all comment on how good it is. Thanks for sharing! definitely a keeper!

I love fried okra, but this is great. It's healthy too. I left them in a little longer and flipped them so they would be crispy on all sides.

These are fantastic and so simple. I grew okra in my garden for the first time even though I had no idea how to make it. I figured if it was so popular down here in the south it must grow well and taste great! To me these taste like the vegetable chips you buy. They crisped up great and were not slimy at all. I don't know if the okra I picked was the right size, they were around 2-3 inches and pretty skinny but they tasted great!

I like Okra, and I hate black pepper but I made this recipe as stated and I L-O-V-E it.  We will be growing Okra in our garden this year and this is so fast we will be going to it time and again.

This was amazing!  It was first time to roast okra, but it won't be my last!  I made this back in the summer when okra was fresh and am just now getting around to rating it.  It is making my mouth water just thinking about it!!!  Please try this one...you won't be sorry!

I am not an okra fan (except when it's fried).  But when okra came with our CSA subscription, I had to find a recipe for it.  This is delicious!  I never knew okra could be so good.  I was glad to get okra a few more times during our summer CSA.

Excellent recipe!  I don't like the slimy but this is tasty!  I read the reviews before I made it.  I used a plastic baggie, cut up my okra into the baggie, added the salt (would use a little less next time), garlic powder, freshly ground pepper and shook it up.  Then added the olive oil and shook it again.  Spread it over a small baking sheet (Toaster oven) and Ta Daa!!!!!  Fantastic!!  Will use over and over!  May go green and use a container instead of the baggie :)

I love this okra.  As a good southern gal I love fried okra and this really lets me indulge without the frying and the breading.  For a special treat I will  use my very good sea salt flakes.  Delicious.

I have cooked our okra this way for years but I cut okra in bite sized pieces and add minced garlic to the olive oil and slather it all over and half way through cook time I stir.  Very Good, my kids that would not normally eat okra love it!!

If it was up to me, I would never cook okra any other way.  I used garlic-infused olive oil and sea salt.  Delicious!  Thanks for a great, EASY, delicious recipe.

I am always up for trying a new method of cooking... this just didn't do what I thought it would: carmelize. So, while I am able to overlook the slime factor, my bf (who is really good about my experimenting with new recipes) could not stomach this one... Add the slime factor to the meager seasoning and you don't get much. I think I'll keep looking =) but thanks for sharing!

Way, way too much salt. Next time, I'll halve the salt.. That'll bump it up to 4 stars and will definitely become a go-to recipe in my family.

Oh my goodness, this is so good. If you sliced the okra 1/3 inch then they will not be slimy. They will be crispy.  They actually taste like they have been deep fried. I used coconut oil instead of olive oil. My husband had several helpings and he is a picky eater! Saving this one as I will make this again and again.

Would be great but entirely too salty.  Even doubled okra and kept original 2 tsp of salt.  Will cut to 1/2 tsp next time.  Know this can be delicious!

I have been roasting okra for years and it is awesome!  Since it is not readily available in the stores year round, I do the same cooking method with frozen cut okra.  Just drain it in a colander and squeeze out the water and some of the slime.  It works great!  I also cook the whole pods this way when they are available fresh.  I put my okra pods in a plastic bag and put in a few tablespoons of olive oil, salt and pepper, and squish around to coat, then put on baking sheet.  My husband and I are from Texas and we love okra, so we have it cooked this way once or twice a week.

My whole family really enjoyed these.  I took the suggestion of another reviewer and soaked the okra in water and lime juice I didn't notice that it helped much but I also don't mind the sliminess of okra.  Other than the water and lime I made as the recipes calls for. I will definitely make these again.

Absolutely delicious!! I LOVE fried okra, & this was a terrific alternative for cutting a few calories. Next time, I'll add less pepper, since I have some in my house who aren't big "spicy" fans. Definitely doing this one again!

I roast fresh asparagus using these same ingredients all the time, but never thought of roasting okra. Tried it and it was great, not mention easy, low slime :) and easy clean-up! I did add some sliced vidalia onions, garlic powder, and red pepper flakes to the mix which made it better IMO. Thanks!

Delicious and simple! I love roasted sweet potatoes, but I'm on a no-sugar diet and this makes for a just-as-tasty substitute. Very moar-ish, so make a lot! I cooked up 12 pieces of okra and they were so good I ate most of them on my own - poor boyfriend got only a handful.

This was the first time I ate okra, so I don't have anything to compare to, but I liked this recipe.  I would make it again, though would probably add some garlic powder and maybe other seasonings.  I didn't measure the salt and pepper, but I'm sure I used way less 2 tsp

I have never make okra before.  I picked the pods from my garden, and I made the mistake of not cooking the pods right away.  They sat in my refrigerator for about 3-4 days before I decided to cook them.  Still good though!

As is it's great!  I love this healtier version and you can deffinately play around with it!  We tried it just now, and I will make this tomorrow; I might sprinkle some breading on top and cheat a little.  We have an electric oven and cooked it for 16 min, I will cook it even longer (without breading) since I like it quite crispy.

Simple, yet classic. It's really not that much different than fried okra, but with a lot less guilt!

I liked the simplicity of this recipe. Popping in the oven is less time consuming than frying in a skillet. The flavor was good and I will certainly do this again. Two things worth noting: 1) my okra was nowhere near done after 15 minutes. Thirty minutes was about perfect, 2) roasting shrinks the okra down quite a bit, so keep that in mind when thinking about serving sizes. Mine lost about 1/3rd - 1/2 its volume but I'm sure keeping it in the oven longer had something to do with that. Very pleased with it.

I hit a sale on okra at a local produce store, and remembered seeing this recipe. I bought some, since okra is one of my favorite veggies. We had it last night with some grilled chicken, and omg was it good. My usual trick for fried okra is to soak it in buttermilk for an hour or so to get rid of the sliminess. This time I did nothing, just followed the direction and grilled over medium heat on a disposable mesh sheet. This is my new go-to recipe for okra!! Thank you, ncope!!!!!!

Not as crispy as I was hoping for, but the flavor was great.  I used a bowl to coat the seasoning and oil since it seemed easier than stirring around on the sheet.

Just finished making this recipe.  I never cooked okra before and I have to say YUMMMM!  It was not slimy AT ALL.  I bit spicy with the pepper, but I'm gonna make it again.  Not only tasty, but easy.  Nice job.

I baked them whole and they were great, just picked them up and ate. I didn't have a problem with slime at all.  Next time, I'll use just a dash less of black pepper, it seemed to take away from the taste of the okra.  I also used garlic salt for the reg salt. Next time, I'll try them sliced.

I made this recipe a couple times in an attempt to introduce fruits & veggies that our household does not typically eat.  I have found a few must haves by doing this but sadly, this will not be one of those foods/recipes for us.  I read reviews about fresh okra being slimy so I followed some reviewers suggestions to minimize the slime.  I'm not sure it worked.  I found the longer I baked them & turned them, the less slimy the okra was.  In the end I enjoyed the flavor "in small doses" but not sure I'll go thru the work of making again.  I did introduce this to friends & their kids who were reluctant to try it.  Ultimately they gave it a try & they too, were not crazy about it. (I was careful to not let them see the slime as I knew they would never try it).  One did say it tasted just like fried okra, even though I baked it and did not bread it like you find in stores.  ...To each his own.  It was worth trying anyway!  I suppose if you grew up eating okra & loving it this will be a fantastic recipe.  It's just not for our household.

This turned out very good.  Even my husband enjoyed it, and he didn't THINK he liked Okra.  I added a tad too much salt, but there was no slimyness or anything.  Would make again, for sure.

I love okra, but my husband doesn't.  He hated it, I loved it!  My 4 year old loved it too, but she also likes okra.  I think you really need to like okra to eat okra.  It was still a little slimy, but not like it usually is when I cook it.   I'm glad I tired it this way, I certainly will eat it like this again.

Great recipe, but I made an operator error. Very large Okra pods have a tendency to be "woody" and do not cook properly with this method.  The smaller pods were perfect. Thanks for a great recipe.

I was in a hurry and dumped in the recommended 2 teaspoons Kosher salt.....WAY TOO MUCH!  Next time I'll just sprinkle the salt and pepper.  Otherwise, very good method (rather than frying).

We planted okra for the first time this year. We had a LOT if it so I tried to find other ways to fix it. We loved this recipe. I would rather have it roasted than any other way.

INCREDIBLE!  I'm from Georgia and thought the only way you could eat okra was fried!  My 3 boys (ages 5 and under) gobbled it up!!  My husband said it was better than fried okra and I agree! 
 
I sliced the ends off and then sliced down the middle length way and followed the ingredients as listed.  I didn't line the pan with foil and they did not stick.

Yummy! I didn't cut the okra, just tossed them in the olive oil, salt, pepper and garam masala. Super yummy, and not slimmy at all.

Really good, I think it would be better with large chunks as described - I used the chopped okra (1/2inch) that I already had. 

Flavor was very good. The texture was off; but again, I think that was on error on my part with the chopped okra.

Wow! This is one of the best recipe ideas for okra! What a tasty way to keep this vegetable healthy. In the past, the only way I prepared them was to fry or steam. I used garlic salt instead of regular salt. Even my 10 year old gobbled them up!

my FIL and hubby stood by the stove and popped these little jewels into their mouths right off the roasting pan. FIL has been in the south all his life and never once had roasted okra and loved the idea of having his okra and eating it too. won't change a thing.

Wet, frozen dethawed okra aside, these were delish with the following added: garlic, garlic powder & cajun seasoning.  Next time, will definitely use fresh! Ate 1/2, put the other in African Chicken Stew from site.

this is exactly what i like to do when making a gumbo with okra added.  i was taught long ago by my grandma this trick to cut down on the sliminess.  this is great as a side treat as well, and the roasted tomatoes really add flavor for a bit of variety as the author mentioned; just sprinkle some cajun seasoning and enjoy.  =]

Less is more.  This  is so simple and the flavor of the okra is maximized.  I love okra and was looking for a lower calorie way of preparing it.  This did the trick.  Thanks so much for sharing!

This was wonderful! I've got an abundance of okra & was looking for something different--this fit the bill perfectly!  (I cheated & used olive oil spray.) It's delicious, quick & has a fantastic (non-slimy) texture. Thanks for sharing!

My fried okra loving family loved this way even more!  Really brings out the flavor of fresh okra and is healthier without the breading.  Roasted it along with some catfish filets in a foil line baking dish....Easy, easy...Thanks for sharing!

I am 75 yrs. old, cook for only myself. This is my first review. Check out the “nutrition” breakdown below the recipe. Wow. Now I have a snack I don’t feel bad about. Of course, I ate all I had (so much for servings). Just a note, the okra I bought was soooo fresh, pods about 3-4 inch long, a big, heaping handful. I rinsed, cut into 1/2 inch pieces, put all in a zip-lock bag, then did the oil, salt, pepper thing (saved a mess). Tossed them up to evenly coat. Did the aluminum foil on the baking pan (mess saver). I only cooked mine for 16 min. Wasn’t crispy, so could have probably cooked 2 minutes more or so. Even though soft but cooked, flavor was awesome. Take it easy on the salt. NOT SLIMY. Definitely going to run out and buy some more. Totally enjoyable. Thank you ncope for a great recipe.

I also am a "good Southern gardener" and right now have bucket loads of okra. I have just recently been trying other methods than breading and frying (my favorite).  This recipe is now my second favorite. I did use garlic pepper (which has salt in it) and tossed instead of drizzling the olive oil. I found that at  15 min. it was still very soft and not browned at all. I ended up cooking about 30 min. If you want it browned and a little crunchy figure on doubling the cooking time. The end result was excellent and is much easier and less messy than frying. Thanks from another Southern okra lover!

I am (was) a Northerner who never tasted/saw Okra before I moved to Tennessee. The only Okra I ever had was when I was a kid in the 50's and ate Campbell's veggie soup. I visited some wonderful Amish foks and they told me how to prepare Okra. I LOVE IT NOW!!! Can't get enough I am even growing it now.. I love the idea of roasting it. I love the crunch.  Thank you!!!

Gosh, I have just discovered okra.  Loved it.  Served with a dish of chopped tomatoes and peppers.  Added the okra right at the end to preserve its crunchiness.

Hate the sliminess of okra? Add salty ingredients at the very end of cooking. The longer okra is exposed to salt, the slimier it will get.

Delicious!  The best way to fix okra, or just about any other vegetable.  I believe the key to reducing the slimey-ness it to make sure you slice the orka pods every inch or so.  That way the interior liquid has a chance to roast off.

I had to roast mine for 25 mins...they shrunk, but I was fine with that...however, this is a fairly mundane recipe. So, for my second batch I added a little garlic salt/powder and threw in some panko crumbs. That's what gave this recipe 4 stars! I'll make it again with the panko crumbs!

My husband reluctantly agreed to taste one bite. I was very surprised when he get gobbling it down as if I'd left cookies on the stove. Why have I never seen okra served this way before?  This recipe will be used again and again at our house!

Thank you so much for this delicious recipe; I do not like boiled okra and fried is not as healthy; I will be using this recipe repeatedly. I read where someone has an Okra Plant on their apartment patio. Great idea that I am going to try.

I thought okra was only meant to be fried - WRONG.  This is ridiculously easy and delicious.  My husband even ate it (and he claims to hate okra.  Pfft.)  I made this last night to go with some pasta I was making but the pasta took longer than I thought and I was hungry.  Long story short - the okra didn't make it to the dinner table (but was a lovely appetizer?  Ha.)  So flippin' good.

I like this as much as traditional battered/fried okra!
I cut mine into about 3/4-inch sections, so I could stir them easily with the olive oil.
I cooked them until they looked toasted. They were NOT SLIMY.
I like this recipe so much that next summer I am going to grow okra! The okra shrinks in the oven so double the amount you think you need for each serving.

Tried this and loved it though it was kinda burnt.  Next time, and there will be one, I will cook it at a little lower temp for longer.  This is the first time I have ever cooked okra.  I love it fried and this is like it only healthier!  I used the tony C's (can't pronounce it hahaha) cajun seasoning instead of salt and pepper.

This was alright, but not great. I will try okra again, but in a different recipe. It was pretty tasteless and chewy, which  was not what I expected. Thanks for the recipe, though.

Delicious and not slimy at all! It does shrink when cooking, so a pound of fresh okra made just enough for 2 of us.

Simply delicious.  I couldn't imagine a better way to eat okra as I grew up in the country and okra always seemed to come fried... I much prefer baked and I love the simplicity and the wonderful texture and flavors.  I love it as is, but if you want to treat it like a baked "okra fry" of sorts, it is great dipped in honey mustard as well.

Bill really liked this.  I soaked the cut okra in a lemon water bath for about 30 minutes.  They were still slimey going into the oven, but not slimey when they came out.  Really Good.

My son (1.5 yrs) loves roasted okra.  I'd give this one a five if there were recommendations to reduce the salt and pepper down.  Maybe only 1/2 tsp of each!

This just didn't have a lot of flavor. And it was still a little slimy. But it did the job-I needed the okra cooked and quick. It was serve-able, but not delicious.

I'm a big fan of okra in general, but I've only had it fried, in soup, and pickled, so I was excited to try this. It was tasty, but I thought it was too greasy. Maybe I added too much olive oil or maybe I should've drained it on paper towels before serving, but I didn't because the recipe didn't specify that. I cooked it for 15 minutes at 425 degrees and it was not crispy, so I would agree that it needs to be cooked longer if you want it crispy. I would try this recipe again but I'd just drain it and cook it longer.

WOW! Made this this evening. It is GOOD! 

I think the hubster was a little skeptical when I told him it was supposed to taste like fried. After dinner he said "You can make this okra any time." It was a winner. 

My 3 year-old didn't like it, but he only wanted cheese for dinner, so that doesn't count.

tastes better than fried to me....and imagine how much better it is for you.  I did sprinkle a little Parmesan on top and also left it in 20-25 minutes because I like mine a little crispy.  Love this!

I made this, but added a little bit of spice. I am Indian and grew up with okra as a staple (fried, and made into a type of curry). I prepared with olive oild, salt, and used a bit of ground cumin, paprika, and red pepper powder (sold at Indian stores) and this came out awesome. Great alternative to frying. thanks for sharing!

For us this recipe was good, but not excellent. We followed the recipe and the okra came out a little bland. We'll try it again probably, but add a little bit more seasoning to it.

So simple, so good. Don't tie yourself to the amounts in the recipe, though. The size of okra pods can vary. We pick ours young, so I used probably 40 pods or so (13 oz prior to removing the stems), and 3/4 tsp of salt was plenty.

After reading a few reviews, I pretty much stuck with the original recipe.  Sliced the fresh okra, put them in a bowl with some EVOO, laid out in one layer on foil-lined pan (for easy clean-up), sprinkled with creole seasoning and baked for 16 minutes at 425 degrees.  Was darn tasty, but may cook it a bit longer next time for some crunchiness.  My husband and teenage son both liked it.  That's a good thing, because our okra plants are producing like crazy!

A perfect way to use okra.  I added a little cayenne pepper for some tongue tingling and it was perfect.

This was the first time that I have ever eaten okra, and I was more than a little skeptical on if I would like it or not.  I stumbled on this recipe and decided it was worth a try.  It was amazing.  I did sprinkle the okra with a bit of garlic powder and onion powder, but that was the only alteration I made.  I will be making this again.

This was so good!  I had never eaten, let alone prepared okra and even our 5 year old tried it and liked it.  My only complaint about this recipe is that it is WAY TOO SALTY as is.  I had thought that 2 t of kosher salt sounded like a lot, so I only put in 1 t and it was still much too salty for our taste, and we had 24 okra pods.  I'll definitely make this again, but will probably only use 1/2 t of kosher salt.  Thanks for the non-slimy way to enjoy this vegetable!

I love this recipe!!! My daughter loves fried okra and I always feel guilty about snacking on all that fried stuff while Im cooking it. This is a healthy and delicious alternative. I actually prefer the taste of the roasted okra to the breaded and fried version. Since I grow okra in my garden, this will be a permanent recipe in my house.

I am an okra novice as it's not widely grown or eaten here. I did cut my okra in larger pieces and halved the salt It was a nice side dish.

Delightfullly easy and tasty! Added some garlic powder and cajun seasoning, but that's a personal preference. I'm sure it's delicious with or without those additions!

I sliced my okra diagonally the way I had it at a restaurant recently and loved it! Made the mistake of adding too much olive accidentally, but was perfect otherwise.  Also added some minced garlic which gave it amazing flavor.

This is so simple yet simply amazing! I always end up w/ a kitchen full of produce every summer & hate to fry anything but that's the only way I know to cook okra. This was such a hit. We will be enjoying this idea all year long!

I was not fan of okra until I tried this recipe as a healthier alternative to frying.  We prefer to cut the okra into bigger chunks but anyway you cut it (I know very punny) it's delicious!

I like okra and this was a pretty good method, though some pieces came out overcooked and were inedible (like tough straw) even though everything was pretty uniformly cut. Great flavor and will try again, taking them out at 10 mins instead of 15.

This was definitely better than I thought it was going to be.  It seemed so simple, but the flavor was great, and this would be a great substitute for french fries for me.

The only change I made was using different spices. This recipe was great for getting rid of the "slimy" reputation of okra and allowing it to be appreciated for the tasty vegetable it is.

i have also been bringing in tons of okra. we have fried, gumbo, boiled, but roasting them straight on the grill, complete horn, is one of the best ways i've tried them. they are surprisingly un-slimy and tasty. honestly when i first tried grilling them, i had serious doubts it would turn out good, but it really is

Oh my goodness...this was great!  I tossed with olive oil and then sprinkled it with Lawry's Seasoned Salt and it was fabulous!  It came out tasting like fried okra without all the mess and without the calories, too.  I did leave it a few minutes longer than the recipe called for so it would be a little cruncy.  YUM!

So easy and delicious.  I tossed the okra with olive oil, fresh cracked pepper and sea salt.  Roasted for a little longer to get the extra crispy crunch.  YUMMY!!!

Delicious!!! Easy and fast. The okra was so yummy, I ate it as a veggie side, but could see doing this and making a tangy dip to go with as a snack/appetizer at a party, an alternative to potatoe chips. YUM! Thanks.  PS - I did 1/2 my batch with just salt, pepper and garlic powder, and the other half with a garam masala spice mix, both were yummy.

This roasted fresh okra dish is excellent!   Though I roast vegetables often, roasting fresh okra is new to me, so I cannot stress enough how great it came out!  I cut the okra as directed, but put it in a bowl and tossed it gently with the olive oil and S&P and then spread it on the foil-lined sheet pan.  Outstanding!

Any easy reference for roasting Okra, but two full teaspoons of salt for three servings is incredibly high.  A few shakes from the  salt and pepper shakers after roasting was plenty. Probably no more than a 1/4 to 1/2 tsp. Can substitute almost any spice for the salt/pepper. I frequently use a cajun-style seasoning on mine.

Wonderful! Nice alternative to fried okra which is a staple here in the south. I have made this many times,  the first several I followed exactly. Turned out fantastic. Since I have experimented and found it work well with larger pieces up to 1/2 inch. Works best with large okra. Never cook okra if it’s hard and woody, but the more tender large ones work well at 1/3”. Smaller okra including the very small most tender work at 1/2”
Or a little more. 

I have also experimented with the seasoning. A little salt and some Cajun seasoning like Tony’s (Cacheres) is our favorite. Season salt was good but we enjoyed a little heat from the Tony’s. Tony’s is good on everything!

You also have to experiment with your oven and temp. Mine seems to come out better closer to the element and at 450° rather than 435°. 

Good recipe.

We loved this!! Well...other than it’s WAY too much pepper! And we like pepper! I’m thinking 2 tsp has to be an error. But other than that it’s tasty and a WONDERFUL alternative to fried okra!! Thank you for sharing!!

It was ok. Nothing to write home about. The flavor was a little plain, so next time I might experiment with different seasonings (at least garlic powder). I was pleased that it wasn't slimy.

Umm Yumm! This was soo simple and delicious! I added a bit of red pepper, which made it quite spicy too me. My husband LOVED it. I put my sheet pan in oven on the bottom shelf to pre heat along with the  oven, then toss them in the seasoning and oil in a bowl and throw them on the hot pan. Sizzle! I'm not sure if this works with foil. I just prefer to use less. Easy, healthy and, not slimy at all! We will be eating more okra. Thank you to the poster!

This is the first time I've cooked with fresh okra.  I was very happy with the result.  I added a pint of grapes tomatoes, they browned and were nice and bursted.  I served for a New Year's Day meal with sausage gumbo, cornbread and coleslaw.

I want to sure about this recipe, only ever eating okra breaded and fried.. (it's a southern thing)... anyway... this is definitely a keeper, thanks for giving me a different way to prepare okra and healthier.

Nope. Not for me. Cannot compare to fried. I don't fry my okra in a deep fryer and I don't use a wet batter. I cut in circles into a colander, wash, then sift salt and pepper and stone ground corn meal through the okra in the colander. Makes a bit of a mess in the sink, but makes the okra lightly battered, not that heavy mess like frozen okra. Then I fry a level spread of the okra in a half inch of hot oil inside a heavy skillet. Nothing else comes close to the delicious crispy texture of okra done this way.

I drizzled avocado is and ground some pepper over the okra, then roasted it on the gas grill. It was definitely the best way I have prepared okra yet. Thanks for the idea.

I made this tonight for the first time after a neighbor shared some okra from their garden.  It was very tasty!  The smaller okra pods came out very tender, but the larger ones were tough and stringy.  Lesson learned!  Would definitely make this again, or add to other roasted veggies.

We LOVE okra. It's a summer staple in my kitchen. For this recipe, I used the okra I had - closer to 30 pods than 18. I tossed them in the olive oil and sprinkled on 1 tsp. of pepper. The recipe calls for 2 tsp. Even the 1 tsp. is too much. Next time, I will start with about 1/4 tsp. pepper and a higher temperature so that they crisp up a little better. This is merely the beginning!

I thought this was really good and easy and I didn't think slimy at all. I used Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning for part of the salt and really didn't measure it or the pepper. As one reviewer stated, this is somewhat like fried okra, but with less calories and carbs. My new favorite way to cook okra!

YUM YUM YUM We love fried okra, but not the fat and calories.
My daughter and daughter-in-law are doing "lo carb" so this is perfect for both. It is so good. Did not change a thing except made twice as much, thank goodness, as it was devoured on the WAY to the table! Thanks for a great one that will be enjoyed often at our house.

Made no changes, other than placing all ingredients in a gallon-sized slider bag and ensuring uniform covering of each okra bite. "Roasted" 15 minutes. Absolutely delicious, easy to prepare.

Absolutely fabulous way to prepare okra. Make sure your okra is young and not longer than 3 or 3.5 inches in length. Make sure you slice them exactly half an inch to 3/4 of an inch... any bigger and they are not roasted properly. I increased my roasting time to 30 minutes and roasted them at 430°. I used a very little bit of cayenne pepper to give it an extra sassy kick! Next time I plan to add a tablespoon of lemon juice pre cook. Oh, and I put the oil, salt and pepper in a gallon ziplock to evenly coat. I didn't use foil but Pam on cookie sheet and they came out great. Definitely a fabulous recipe

This recipe was really great! I used chorizo instead of the regular sausage and left out the red sauce. It was amazing!! If you try this just make sure you cook the chorizo (if raw) beforehand.

WOW, was this ever fabulous!  

With one VERY BIG caveat: if I had followed the recipe, it would have been MASSIVELY over-salted and over-peppered.   

I had 30 pods and since it was a new recipe, I didn't want to risk them all so instead of 18 pods, I used half of what I had: 15, but that's only ~10% less than the recipe.  I couldn't imagine TWO teaspoons of salt & pepper on that small amount of food, so I slashed it over HALF (1 scant tsp) and it was still WAAAAAY too salty (and I *love* salt), although the pepper had a nice bite at 1 tsp. so I'll leave that. 

But on the next one, I'm using 1/2 tsp. of salt.  Yikes. 

BUT, with that said: this recipe is now my very favorite way of eating okra.  More than battered & fried, more than gumbo, and more than stewed with tomatoes!  It's amazing.

The reviews are right. I've made this 3 times now and the only problem I have, I can never make enough. The only way I liked to eat okra, in the past, was fried. This is oven fried okra without the hassle of adding the coating. Thank you for sharing this recipe with us.

What a delicious way to use okra.  Since I found this recipe this summer, this is the only way I have cooked okra.  Only thing I do different is use Cajun seasoning on them instead of salt and pepper.  Thank you soooooo much for an easy recipe that is so good!!!!

Yummy! Might like this better than traditional fried okra, and so easy to fix. I added 8 cherry tomatoes cut in half plus stirred in 1/4 cup Panko bread crumbs after reading several other recipes. Delicious.

This was so easy and delicious. Even my husband loved it! I followed another reviewer's advice and soaked the okra in water and lime juice for 15-20 minutes before slicing. The okra wasn't slimy at all.

First time I made it exactly as written. Delightful! Second and third time I spiced it up a bit. A little red pepper gives it a little kick. Experimented a time or two but the original recipe is what the grandkids want. They like it "extra crispy" so I leave it in a little longer for them.

I used two bags of frozen cut okra. I tossed the okra with the oil and seasonings in a bowl before putting on the baking sheet. I cut the salt and pepper a bit and added garlic powder and a few flakes of red pepper. I roasted about 25 minutes and the okra was still tender but the slime was gone. This was easy and a winner for my crew.

A sweet elderly woman gave me a bag of okra... a vegetable I have done well to avoid most of my life.  I made this recipe, adding a splash of Balsamic Vinegar, and found a palatable way to eat okra.  With enough of the added ingredients, it almost tasted like roasted asparagus.

Cut back on salt after reading the reviews. I added a little garlic and a bit of red pepper for kicks.  Very good. I will use this again.

I also soaked the okra in 10-minutes in lemon juice because I didn't have lime. The okra wasn't slimey.

I really love okra and was looking for a different way to make it. This seemed like it would be really good. I followed the recipe exactly and I just didn't like it at all. The texture was off..too chewy, not crispy enough on the outside & once they sat for just a few minutes, they were just flat, mushy & oily. I really wanted to like this, but it was actually a big letdown & a waste of fresh-from-the-garden okra.

I made it spicy adding coriander, cumin, paprika and chili powder. I've never enjoyed stewed okra and am trying to avoid carbs. Roasting seamed like a great option. This recipe turned out great the way I made it.

I'm not a huge fan of okra. I like it fried but that's about it. I gave this recipe a try since we have so much okra from our garden. Surprisingly good! The okra came out nice and crunchy, not slimy at all. I added a little garlic powder with the salt and pepper and it was delicious.  I am excited to try adding other spices next time. You could add a little cayenne to make it spicy or cumin and chili powder.

Needing a way to use okra from the garden, my husband went looking for new recipes. He found this one while I was out of town and tried it. He was raised on fried okra, and thought this was just as tasty. He told me about it when I returned home. I was skeptical. . . He made some tonight and WOW! Kind-of like fried okra meets roasted asparagus. The only thing he did differently was to cut the okra into 1" pieces. Move over gumbo and pickled okra! We have a new favorite for the weirdest of all veggies!

Instead of using chicken breasts use tenderloins. It turns out juicy in the allotted time. No need to pound or anything.

OMG. This is really, really delicious. I sliced the okra extra-thin (.25") and roasted them until quite brown, flipping a few times. WOWZA. Crispy and a bit salty, and not even the slightest bit slimy. But: I bet it needs to be hot from the pan to be good -- probably wouldn't reheat well. I've been getting okra in my CSA box, but I'll intentionally buy it at the store for this recipe in the future.

I was looking for another way to use the okra coming out of the garden (besides gumbo). This is perfect.

We fix this often in the summer. I cut up the okra as directed and shake it with a little olive oil in a plastic Baggie.  Ten minutes in a 400 degree oven and it's ready. Very tasty!

Roasting cuts down on the slime factor drastically.  I don't mind it, but I was looking for ways to prep okra for those who abhor the slime.  Cut some in half, leave small ones whole, toss with brussels sprouts, olive oil, apple cider vinegar and spices for an easy side dish.  Okra-haters loved it.

First time making okra, and it was wonderful!  Very simple, lends itself to more seasoning options to taste.  Next time, I'm adding garlic :)

This is a very good dish. Fried was the only way I liked okra until trying this recipe. I followed the recipe to a T except I didn't have any pepper so I substituted Italian seasoning. The okra came out perfect and was not slimy a bit.

And I thought I only liked pickled okra!  Loved it and will be making it quite a bit this season as we planted quite a bit of okra.  Hope I remember to save some for pickling!!!

Living in Japan, few vegetables that are common in my hometown, Chicago IL, are available for cheap on a regular basis. Okra is an exception. Having not ever cooked it before, I wasn't sure what to expect with this recipe, but I have grown to really understand that sometimes the simplest ingredients are the best. Delicious from my toaster oven! I'll be making this again. In response to the comment that the okra become slimy, I think this might just be the nature of okra. I didn't find it slimy at all, but it wasn't exactly crispy either. It just doesn't do that unless you bread and fry it. This is a healthier option ;-)

This was the first time I ever prepared/ate Okra. It will definitely be on the menu often now, as long as I can find it at the store. It is so yummy!!  Rather than measure salt and pepper, I just sprinkled some on once they were in the pan. You don't need much salt, as even with what I thought was a light salting, the okra tasted a bit salty. I did feel it needed another flavor, so next time I will add some garlic I think. Per others' suggestions I roasted the okra longer. I roasted it for 35 minutes, turning them over halfway through. They were a light brown and not slimy at all, which was what I was concerned about. Definitely a keeper recipe. I am hoping I can get the grandchildren to try it. I think they will like it, since Okra does not have a strong flavor/taste.

Very easy recipe! I use butter instead of oil for an extra rich flavor. I melt the butter in a saucepan and add 1 tsp salt and some Indian spices (or any seasoning/spice I feel like). Then I pour the butter mixture over the okra and mix it all together and pour onto baking dish and bake as directed. YUMMY!

Delicious. We grew okra for the first time this year and found this recipe so very good. I did spray the foil with Pam before laying out the okra slices. Have already made this twice and will make again this weekend.

I was always a little afraid to try okra, since there were so many accounts of it turning out gross and slimy.  I just gave this recipe a shot and it's great!  I wish I'd tried this a long time ago, since it was so easy to do, tastes great and is even healthy!

So delicious and simple!! I scarfed the okra down in seconds... would also probably translate well to another fav, brussel sprouts. Thanks for a great summer celebration food!

Really liked this recipe as a change from the traditional okra and tomatoes.  I did reduce the amount of pepper and salt in the dish. Thanks for posting it.  This amount made two servings.

Pretty good! I'd never had okra before, and I would have it again after this.
