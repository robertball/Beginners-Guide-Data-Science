Good and fast meal. I added a little green pepper and onions to the ground beef. and added a few diced green onions on the toppings. the Catalina dressing was a little too sweet for me but the wife enjoyed it. will make again with a little sour cream. over all a good recipe as written.

I donâ€™t use salsa, I use tomatoes. Instead of plain tortilla chips we use spicy nacho flavored Doritos. We also add a small teaspoon to tablespoon of sour cream. Great potluck dish.

I really enjoyed this recipe, as it reminds me of one I had as a child. I used tomatoes in place of the salsa and omitted the beans due to my family not liking them. My sons both devoured this. For the tortilla chips, I used Nacho Cheese Doritos for the tortilla chips and they added more flavor to it. I look forward to making this again soon (and maybe I can talk the family into the beans then!)

This is a good easy salad to put together.  I mixed the salsa and catalina dressing together and really liked it drizzled over this salad.  I used ground chicken in place of the ground beef and sprinkled some taco seasoning into it.  Very good.
