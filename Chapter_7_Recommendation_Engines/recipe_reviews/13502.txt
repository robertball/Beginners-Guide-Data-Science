I've made this pretty jello mold two years now for Thanksgiving.  I use canned mandrin oranges instead of fresh oranges.  It is definitely yummy!  Everybody loves it.

This fruit salad is terrific!  The changes I made were to use only one apple (it was more than plenty) and to use a combination of raspberry and cranberry jello (one packet of each).  This seemed to cut out the excessive sweetness other reviewers mentioned.  I also substituted almonds for walnuts.  It was just perfect!

I make this for every holiday.  I changed this recipe to be sugar free by making my own cranberry sauce with splenda and skipping the yogurt.  I have tried a variety a fruit (whatever in season) and I haven't had a bad mold yet.

Excellent flavor and presentation! My family loved this salad. I made it for Christmas Eve Buffet as stated. The day after Christmas I made it again using celery instead of walnuts to cut the fat a bit. Yummy both ways! Thanks for sharing,Robyn.

A little different because yogurt gives it a creamy textures.  Molded very well and tasted great.

I've made this recipe for the last several Christmas dinners and it is LOVED by all.  They request it every holiday now.   I don't know how I happened upon your recipe but I've saved it and am thankful for it.   NO SUBSTITUTIONS NEEDED ....it's perfect the way it is.    Just make sure you refrigerate it 8+ hours.

I prepared this salad for Christmas dinner this year. It was pretty good while I was having it with other food, but since then I've eaten it alone and it leaves quite a bitter taste in my mouth.

I think the yogurt made this recipe look not so appetizing to my family when I served it to them so few were willing to try.  I thought it was ok, but no one really ate this even though I made quite a bit thinking it would be great (according to all the high reviews).... don't think I'll be making this again.

A very tasty fruity and 'nutty' gelatin!  However, next time I will cut down on the sugar and find a way to add a lot  more sourness to it.  Too sweet considering it's a cranberry side.

Love it! Love it! Love it!  I made this for Christmas dinner because I wanted something with jello and cranberry. It is so good.  Very refreshing.  I used drained mandarin oranges (did not chop) instead of fresh. I took the peels off the apples by accident.  I am going to make this all of the time!!!

I passed this recipe to my brother in law to make.  The flavor was good even though he never took it out of the bowl to make it mold to a shape.  I would do it again.

This recipe was too sweet for my taste. I did use fresh cranberries and made it into cranberry sauce which might have altered the flavor. I would make cranberry sauce without the sugar if I made this again.

I've made this (tweeked) since I was teenager....so stinkin good! But here's what I do: I use a can of drained Mandarin oranges, reserve the liquid, instead of the orange segments. Then use 1/2 cup of the reserved juice, and 1/2 of water, in lieu of 1 cup of water.

The only thing that might make this better is something like a little lemon juice to add a background to the sweetness.
