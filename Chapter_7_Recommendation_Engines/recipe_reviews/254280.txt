I love this method of making thin crust pizza  dough! It's amazingly easy! I recommend weighing the flour based on Chef John's notes to obtain the correct consistency. Should you choose not to weigh the flour, start with 1 cup of flour, add the honey, olive oil, salt, yeast and water; mix and then gradually add the remaining flour in small increments (approximately 1/4 cup each addition) until the desired consistency is achieved. Ensure that each additional flour is completely incorporated before adding more. The dough should have the consistency of a runny batter (watch the video for guidance). I changed the recipe and method a bit, solely out of necessity. I substituted instant yeast for the active dry yeast, since I only have instant yeast at home. As a result of this change, I was able to cut the rest time by about one hour. I have to admit to cutting corners at the end; instead of piping the dough onto the cast iron skillet, I poured approximately 1 cup to 1 1/2 cups of dough into the center of the skillet and spread it around with a large offset spatula, using the circumference of my skillet as a guide in making perfectly round pizzas. This method worked for me; however, Chef John may not approve of it! ;-) I was able to make three 12-inch pizzas with this recipe, which my family absolutely loved! I will definitely make this again!

It was tricky to decide how many stars to give this because, although it was really good, there is a glaring error in the recipe.  3 cups of flour is way too much.  This recipe is supposed to make one smallish pizza, and the batter is supposed to be thin, and the 3 cups of flour was not compatible with that.  I wound up adding more water to my batter, but it was still too thick, so when I piped it into the pan it didn't make a thin, crispy crust like it was supposed to.  I also made two more pizzas and still had some batter left over!  I did get better at making the pizzas as I was working on it, so I bet I'll be really good at it next time when I use the correct amount of flour.  Chef John, if you fix the recipe, I'll adjust my review to 5 stars.

My mixer wouldn't do the job, so I tried whisking by hand. When that put too much strain on the whisk, I used a spatula and no matter how long I mixed it, I never got it to liquify. Close, but not like yours. It did rise (out of a large pyrex bowl) and that consistency was like yours, but after stirring with a ladle, again not as thin as your batter. I still made it but for some reason, I had enough batter for 2  full size cast iron pan pizzas that were about 1/2" thick. 

I gave you 5 stars because I see someone else tried it and had a 5 star experience and I'm sure it was. Also, I really liked your presentation  and witty comments. I'm still a big fan!

I used ap flour.  Using  a plasitic bag and piping the batter onto the pan did not work for me.  I  used a ladel and then a spatula to spread it out, almost like a crepe.  Also, the batter absorbed the olive oil that was in the pan, so I ended up spraying the pan with oil instead and it worked out much better.

this is really crisp and delicious! I did have an issue with my bigger skillet, the dough was stuck to the bottom and it wouldn't flip. when I changed to my medium skillet it was much better. I was craving a pizzeria thin and crispy and this definitely met my craving! I did cut the flour to 2 cups as suggested by others and it was perfect pouring consistency.

This did not work for me. It wouldn't stay together. Soggy.

I used the ingredients exactly as described, no modifications. It was a cool day where I live, so I put it into a 150 degree oven to rise. That worked out fine. However I was confused about the cooking instructions. I thought the batter was for one pizza crust, so my crust was very thick (like deep, deep, DEEP dish) so had to be cooked much longer in the pan before I considered it  done. The end result was delicious though - a true carb lover's delight. I will try this again and make 3-4 crusts with it.

I weighed out the flour, the dough was way too viscous. I ended up adding probably 3/4 c water to make it pourable. After that, the result was tasty but I think the technique requires practice. Every one I made was iteratively better
