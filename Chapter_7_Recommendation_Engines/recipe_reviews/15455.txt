Oh my gosh, I was so happy to find this recipe!  I had something like this at Lambert's in Missouri and it's delicious.  Who knew it was so simple to make?

Delicious! I doubled the recipe and added about 1/4 of a cup of powdered sugar and some marshmellows. The mixture will look a little thin and runny but thickens up after being  refrigerated overnight. Yum! My husband and kids found it in the fridge and the next thing I know, it's gone!

I added a whole 20 oz can of pineapple chunks and substituted coconut extract for the vanilla.  My whole family absolutely love it.  This is definitely going into my recipe collection.

My daughter, son-in-law and myself dined at Lamberts this past Friday. We have eaten there several times since it is in the town we live in so we had fallen in love with their Pineapple walnut salad. I found this recipe the next day and made it on Tuesday for my daughters birthday dinner. She and I both agree...this is even better than Lamberts!! Thank you for sharing!

This is delicious. A restaurant about 1.5 hours drive away serves this and I order it everytime. Now I can prepare it anytime. I prepared this for a potluck. I omitted the coconut because I'm not a fan and used pecan instead of walnuts. Can you say "FABULOUS"?? It was a hit.

When I was a little, my dad would get this salad from the food store. Always a taste I loved. When I found this recipe, and made it, it brought back memories of my childhood. Will definitly make from now on.  Thanks

Easy, tasty and even better tasting the day after it was made. 9 yr. old grand daughter made this all by herself and loved the taste, as did we all.

I used pineapple chunks & some maraschino cherries for color.  I let the cherries drain on a paper towel for a while so they wouldn't bleed into the salad. I blotted them & cut them in half The grandkids were coming over & I knew they wouldn't turn their nose up at this dessert. I had everything in my pantry which made it even better.

we have made this many times through the years, using it as a base recipe for other fruit salads...adding apple bits, marshmallows, bananas,maderin oranges, and green grapes. At family reunions and "picky eaters" we would have a line of bowls with different fruits so that everyone could add whatever fruit they wanted . For church dinners everyone would bring a large bowl of chopped fruits and nuts so everyone could individually make their fruit salad adding their choice of fruits to their bowl of the pineapple base.

Well this was pretty good. Didn't need the full 8 oz. of whipped topping and used pineapple tidbits and pecans as that is what I had. Will make this again as everyone from the youngest to the eldest enjoyed this!
