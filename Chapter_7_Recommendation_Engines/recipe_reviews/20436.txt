I LOVE "Bloody Mary Sundays", and chasing those bloody mary's is always a beer!  I tried this recipe the first time how it was written, and found it to have a "funky" taste.  Next time I subbed the seasoned salt with celery salt and used spicy V8, it's a must!  Now I don't have to be two fisted, thanks JoeDogg!

These are soooo good! Can play w/ the spices to suit your taste. Throw in a couple of olives and or a stalk of celery.

Loved this.  Like others I used spicy v8 and it was yummy. Like a bloody mary but easier.

The health benefits of this amazing beverage include soothing a hangover - its better than a bloody mary!  I like it with V8 juice as well, but don't forget the hot pepper

Very refreshing and yummy, if you like savory drinks. To me it seemed like the tomato and seasoning flavors mostly eclipsed the flavor of the beer, so I'd recommend not using a 'fancy' beer in this recipe.

This review is from my husband. He has been making this for years and absolutely LOVES it. I've tried it before and thought it was good too! He also likes to play around with the spices, adding more or less or even changing them up a bit. He says it's a keeper, for sure. Thanks for sharing. :)

I know it's hard to find in the USA, but if you can locate Extra Spicy Clamato (Tomato/Clam Cocktail mix)just use that in your beer, no other additives needed...unless you want to add extra hot sauce.

This is ok, not something we would make again.  The flavor is good but neither my husband or I enjoyed the carbonation of the beer with the tomato juice.  I guess we are Bloody Mary purists and it's not necessarily the recipes fault.

I've been making this (with Clamato, tabasco and celery salt) for over 20 years. It was my grandfather drink of choice.

This is what our favorite hangout always served as a Bloody Mary only with a stalk of celery, the day after a fun night. They are great and depending on how much fun we had determined how much Tabasco went in it. :)

You can use spicy bloody mary mix instead of tomato, vegetables,and hot sauce. Very very good served in frosty glass. ps. adjust bm mix and beer until you find your ratio.

Love it. I also like it with V8 juice and I always always always add some lemon :) 
for an extra fancy serving, try putting some lemon on the rim of the glass and frost it with salt/chili pepper to add some extra touch

I really like this recipe.  I have also made it with just spicy V-8 and also when I was out of that, I used just a bit of Heinz Chile Sauce.  That is also very good.  Thanks for the recipe!

Maybe it was the beer I used (Corona), it was very bland.
