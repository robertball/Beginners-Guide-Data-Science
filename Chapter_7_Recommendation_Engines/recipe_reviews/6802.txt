I make this cornbread often (and serve it with the vegan black bean soup from this site). I leave out the onion, add a half cup of sugar and mix all the cheese into the batter- just our preference. If you don't have buttermilk normal milk works fine the batter is just a bit thinner so reduce the amount you use. Also, I use fat-free cheddar (kraft pre-shredded) in this recipe. The bread is so moist that you really don't notice  you're missing all the fat. One note is that the batter is VERY moist- I cook mine at 400 for an hour or so. It is very soft when it comes out of the oven but will firm up as the cheese cools. Give this one a try- you won't be dissapointed!

This is wonderful-moist and tasty.  The addition of the jalapenos gives it a nice twist!

This was yummy!  It will be my standard corn bread recipe from now on.  I used one jalapeno, and it had just the right zing for me.

I used butter instead of corn oil and I used a couple tablespoons of mild chilies from the can only because I don't keep jalapeno peppers on hand and I really didn't want it to be too spicy for the little ones. In my cast iron skillet, mine was done at just under 35 minutes. I took a tip from a girlfriend of mine and melted butter in the skillet in the hot oven before adding the cornbread batter for a buttery, crispy crust. We all liked this a lot. The flavor of this cornbread was wonderful. I'd like to try this next time with Mexi-Corn and see how that is in this recipe. I think it would be good with pepper-jack, too. Making it in the cast iron I think is what made it SO good. But, isn't almost anything made in cast iron good? ;)

Good cornbread.  Not as moist as I was expecting, but great taste.  I think there was too much onion for us, I'll use half as much next time.  I used chopped green chilies for convenience.  Mixed all of cheese into batter as we don't care for the cheese topping baked on. Will make regularly.

This dish was just OK. I didn't think it had much zing at all. If I made this again, I would add cayenne.

This is the best cornbread recipe, esp. Mexican, that I have ever tasted!!! It's easy, fast., fun and most ingredients are on hand.The only thing we changed was using Mexican style corn instead of the cream style. You really should try this, esp. if you are from the South!!! Great with any dish!

This was okay, but not the best.  I substituted green chilis for the jalopenos.  It was a little mushy so I baked it longer, but the flavor wasn't my favorite.  It was a little heavy too.

Using this recipe as a guide, i tweaked a few things to try to remake this delicious cornbread i tasted a month ago at AK restaurant in Venice, on Abbot Kinney.  And i came pretty  close!  The initial base recipe was a bit moist and bland, so the 2nd time i made it as follows:  reduced buttermilk to 3/4 cup, saut√©ed a whole sweet onion (diced) and seasoned with salt BEFORE adding to batter, added 1 cup white sugar, sprinkled 5 big dashes of cayenne pepper(it was really spicy, but offset by the sweet and so tasty!), and i did NOT sprinkle the cheddar cheese over the top of the batter after i poured it into the 8x8 baking dish. I know i baked it for at least 40 minutes at 375 F, but don't remember exactly how long.  i took it out when the center of the bread was light brown and the edges were darker brown.  this recipe makes a very sweet cornbread, so if you don't like sweet, adjust the sugar to your liking.  (i think 1/4 cup would be a subtle enhancement but not too sweet)  Hope my review helped someone out!  enjoy!

If you don't have buttermilk, just stir a Tablespoon of either lemon juice OR vinegar into regular milk and let it sit a few minutes.  You will get that same thick, tangy effect that buttermilk gives.

This is a great recipe and almost identical to the way I make mexican cornbread.  My version is simplified though, I use 2 boxes of premixed cornbread mix instead of having to measure out the dry ingredients and I use canned jalapenos instead of fresh.  If I don't have cream corn, a can of regular corn, drained, works as well but I have also used frozen corn which gives it a fresher, crispier result.  Overall, very yummy which ever way you decide to make it!!

Fabulous, fabulous, fabulous cornbread to go with a Mexican meal or anytime you want a little kick to your cornbread.  We have always loved the cornbread served hot in a cast iron skillet at a restaurant that we enjoy when we visit Scottsdale, AZ and this comes as close to it as any recipe I have ever tried.  I did not want the onion flavor to predominate so I used a medium onion and realized at the last moment that the cornbread at the restaurant has a touch of sweetness so I added about 1/3 cup of sugar.  I decided to add all the cheese to the batter because I just wasn‚Äôt sure about the cheese crust and wanting it to brown and crisp nicely I upped the temperature to 375 degrees.   It took about 45 minutes to be perfectly browned, moist and scrumptious.   I believe that baking the cornbread in a cast iron skillet makes a huge difference and if you do not have one it would be worth purchasing one for this recipe alone.   Paired with Easy Chicken Fajita Soup and Avocado-Corn Salad with Creamy Salsa Dressing, both from this site, it made for a very satisfying meal, with six of us having no problem whatsoever finishing off the entire pan.

I can only give it three stars. I followed the recipe to a tee and, while it was very tasty, the bread seemed to be very dense. It was not the cornbread I was looking for, as we prefer something a little lighter and sweeter.  If you are looking for a heavy savoury cornbread, rthen this may be for you.

This cornbread is very tasty. My friends all loved it. However, I had to bake it around 50 minutes and it was still pretty mushy in the center, so allow a little extra time or make it in a larger dish than an 8" square. Also, I'm not a big fan of the cheese on top. Next time, I'll just mix it all together. Also, maybe a little less onion might be better.

This is the best... I have made all the others!  Personnally, I put more jalapeno pepper in mine and I do like the heat.  I have found a course shredded, extra sharp cheddar cheese works better than the fine grated cheese.  I find the extra sharp cheese retains more cheese flavor with less fat.  Very Good!!!!

I wanted a more tradional cornbread so didn't add the jalepenos, onion or cheese.  I added 1/2 cup sugar.  I suppose with all those changes I don't have a right to review it, but here goes.  :)  We didn't like the "pop" of corn as we ate it.  I tried creamstyle & liked it better.  My nonvegetable eater kid didn't know it was there with creamstyle.

A very good cornbread but it was lacking something.  I think sugar.
I used a little more cheese than recommended and I left the seeds in the jalapenos.  I cooked it a good ten minutes longer than the recipe calls for and it still came out surprisingly moist, but not under-cooked so I guess that's just the way it's supposed to be.

Good recipe.  I couldn't find 8 oz can creamed corn so I just used the 14 oz and it turned out great.  I also added about 2 tbsp sugar as cornbread should have a little bit of sweetness.

My family LOVED this recipe with a spicy bowl of venison chili.  I did make a few alterations:  I omitted the onion, and instead of fresh jalapenos, I used canned green chiles.  YUM!

Excellent recipe. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I did tweak it a little. I added more cheese, 1/4 cup more flour and used a dried jalepeno rather than fresh. I also threw in a sprinkling of cayenne pepper (1/8 tsp) as my father likes his cornbread spicy!! The texture and flavor were VERY VERY good. Will definitely add this to my "must make again" pile.

This bread was good, but like others, I prefer my cornbread a tad sweet so I did add a bit of sugar. This went over well in our house Lynn.

I was really impressed with this bread.  Don't worry about the spiciness of the jalapenos, the cheddar cheese cools it down nicely.  This reheats really well, all of my friends loved it.

This was a nice savory corn bread, but I actually prefer the 'Savory Corn Bread' from this site more...... Less stuff to put in for that other recipe than for this one, though there is an extra step in mixing in the corn meal for the Savory Corn bread.  So either way, the time is similar.  All I can say is our particular family prefers the Savory Corn Bread to this one.  Thanks for the chance to try something like this, though.  It was fun.

This is an awesome Jalapeno' cornbread recipe! I've been using  the same one for years. I found my on the back of Tenda Bake self-rising cornmeal. You can always make it spicier by adding more peppers. I receive request all the time for this recipe at parties and family funcitons.

I did fiddle with the recipe a bit. As I had no buttermilk, I soured a  cup of milk with a little lemon juice. Also, I used canned green chiles instead of fresh jalapenos. I preheated my cast iron frying pan, put a bit of oil in the bottom, then poured the batter in, so I got a lovely, crunchy bottom crust. This was absolutely delicious.

Awesome! My favorite Mexican cornbread ever. I always make this with a big pot of beans. We all love it. Cooks slower in my oven (more like an hour), but other than that didn't change a thing!

I didn't have most of the ingredients, so I used this recipe as my base.  I had a box of cornbread mix, made it as directed, added cream-style corn, shredded cheddar cheese, and pepper jack cheese.  I should have reduced the milk, but it was awesome anyway!  Thanks!

This is soooo good! I have made it several times, and it always is a huge hit. We never have buttermilk, so I put a tablespoon of vinegar in a cup of regular milk, and it turns out great. What a super, awesome recipe!  I actually made it with regular corn, since I was out of creamed corn, and it still was great.

I did not adjust this recipe at all and it turned out great.  I put it in my recipe box and will make it again for Thanksgiving; However, I wouldn't give this cook credit for coming up with this recipe.  I found one 15 years ago on some cornmeal bag and thought it was delicious and wanted to make it again.  This recipe has identical ingredients.  But I'm glad it's here because I really needed the measurements.  Thanks for reiterating a classic!

I thought this was gorgeous! It's very crumbly when it's warm and the next day it is really lovely too. The cheese and onion really add something extra. Recommend 100%!!!

I had high hopes for this recipe but wasn't too happy with it. It could use something to sweeten it up perhaps. I still haven't found the perfect cornbread recipe and I'll keep looking!

Gave this 5 stars because it is delicious!  The only changes I made were that I used about 2 1/2 Tbsp chopped jalepenos from a jar, (not fresh),and increased the corn meal to 1 1/2c.  (only because I had just a little tiny bit of cornmeal left, and I wanted to use it up.) Therefore, I increased the creamed corn to 1 1/2c (to make up the extra moisture from the additional corn meal) and, as others had suggested, I mixed all the cheddar into the batter at once.  I baked this in a greased 9X9 pan for 30 mins.  Served it with honey butter and a bowl of chili.  Mama happy!

This was really good!  I used a whole can of Mexicorn and left a little cheese for the top to good effect.  Two jalepenos is just right if you carefully clean out the seeds and membranes and chop them up fine.  I used half of a red onion and it didn't overpower the cornbread taste.  I will make this again!

I thought this was delicious but my family really does like at least minimal amount of sugar in their cornbread, so I guess I'll stick to those.  I poured the batter into the pan then added chopped jalapeno over the top of half for those that don't do spicy in my family.  Yummy cornbread IMO!
UPDATE 5/29/17 Made this again, but left out the onions and my husband ate 4 pieces!  Loved it even without the sugar :)

Made exactly as directed.  I will make this one more time with the addition of at least 1/4 cup of white sugar.  It does lack taste.  To prove that to my husband and myself, I made a simple syrup and poked tiny holes with a scewer all over the cornbread & while it was still warm, poured 1/4 cup of the hot simple syrup over the cornbread.  Let it set for a few minutes.  Then cut another piece for my husband and he loved it.  I tasted it and declared that this was indeed what was missing.  (must be the southern yankee in me :-)  Thanks very much for sharing.

A word of warning - if you think you have jalapenos in the house, and it turns out you don't, DON't dump in an entire 4-oz can of chopped green chiles as a substitute like I did!  The extra moisture meant it had to cook forever... and when it was finally done, it was still much more like spoonbread than cornbread.  The flavor was good, so next time I make it, I'll be sure to use actual jalapenos, and I think I'll also use a can of drained corn instead of cream-style, as some other reviewers have done.  I like my cornbread a little drier, so hopefully this tweak will do the trick!

Made this tonight using Aunt Jemima Corn Meal Mix, so I didn't have to add the flour, baking powder, soda and salt.  It was really great!  I was hesitant to add the cream-style corn as I usually think it's too sweet, but this was perfect.  Very moist on the inside and crusty edges.  I served it  with homemade vegetable soup.  I have added it to my favorites and will make it again and again.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

Absolutely THE best recipe for Mexican Corn Bread I have EVER tried.  I had to substitute whole white corn, powdered buttermilk, and nacho style jalapeno slices.....AND IT WAS AWESOME!!!  I worried a little that without the creamed corn it might not be creamy enough, so I added some Brummel and Brown.  Even my picky 12 yeard old loved it.

My family seemed to love this dish, but I'm much more fond of a sweet cornbread. This is not sweet at all. I used 3/4c. low-fat milk instead of 1c buttermilk. Turned out well.

I am not sure what is going on with this recipe. Firts time I made it , it was great the last 3 times it was mush. Following the recipe to a T. Even after cooking it for and hr and a half it was still mush. I even called the service man out to look at my oven! Just cant figure it out. I will be moving on to another recipe as the ingredients are getting too costly to throw down the garbage disposal. Sorry

Wow, great recipe.  I made some changes that made it perfect for our southern taste - minced 1/2 onion, 3 peppers, pinch of cumin, 1T sugar, whole kernel corn, mixed all of cheese in batter.  Cooked on 325 for 50-60 min.  Cooking slower, longer seems to distribute the wonderful flavor as does mincing vegs. Thanks for the best mexican cornbread recipe.

Truly a Tex-Mex Cornbread, for the milk, I used 3/4 cup sour cream, 1/4 cup milk, also added red chili peppers, put half the batter in pan ,(I warmed on the stovetop with a stick of butter), then the cheese, then rest of batter. Into the hot oven. Was out of corn, or I would have added that too. As for chilis, "the more you eat, the more you want to eat".

I love this recipe, it is great with chili.  I sometimes add browned, drained ground beef into mine, and the family loves it..

The texture of this was fine, but it didn't taste very good -- not sweet enough.  I might try it again with sugar.

Good recipe Lynn, thanks. I used the recipe as stated. I chose a large walla walla sweet onion and I did use the two jalapenos sliced but not seeded.  I love the spark of the peppers. I didn't have buttermilk on hand so I used sweet milk with vinegar (an old way of doing). White corn meal and cream corn. I didn't care that it didn't hold together like traditional bread. I took it to a potluck and put it out like a side dish. I warned those who don't care for spicy foods but only one person chose not to try it. Everyone loved it just the way it was. Sugar? Most old cornbread recipes do not call for sugar. Never thought of it as an ingredient. Most asked for the recipe. This is going in my cookbook I will make again.

I thought this recipe was pretty good.  I wish I had taken the advise to add some sugar, though.  Next time I will definitely use sugar I like it a little sweet.

I made it just as the recipe called for, but I would leave out the onion altogether and use a 13x9 pan to allow it to firm up better

Made it exactly as directed and it took waaaaaay over 35 minutes to finish.  I would make it again but add an extra 10 minutes at least and I would probably not remove the seed/veins from the jalapenos because it could have used a bit more kick.

This is good cornbread. It is dense and flavorful with plenty of moistness. I got numerous compliments on it and there were no left overs. It is not sweet so if you like a sweet cornbread just add some sugar as others have recommended. I used a 4 oz. can of roasted jalapenos that I diced up instead of 2 fresh ones since I didn't have any fresh jalapenos in stock. It was not hot. It was flavorful and moist but really no heat. I would have liked a little more heat for my tastes. I don't know if the fresh jalapenos make it very hot but if you want a tasty mild version I can vouch for the Ortega roasted jalapenos in a 4 oz. can.

Girlfriend..........this recipe ROCKS!  My only change was to add more jalapenos (I used seeded fresh but pickled would work fine)!!  I had used a recipe in the past that was essentially a "Jiffy-Mix" recipe with additions.  My DH doesn't like a "sweet" type of cornbread so I was looking for something else.  EUREKA...........this is it!!

This recipe is a keeper...  Easy and delicious.  Adding a pound of drained and browned ground beef to the top before putting on the shredded cheese makes it a meal in a skillet..  We like it spicy, so I add Cajun Seasoning, cayenne pepper, and extra diced jalapenos to the ground beef to kick up the taste.

Awesome corn bread! I doubled the recipe to take this to a themed dinner and it was a huge hit! 

I omitted the all-purpose flour and just doubled the corn meal so this would be gluten free for a family member with that allergy.

4.5 Stars: I left out the onion and used onion powder.  My husband thought it needed more jalapeno heat, so I plan to use jarred and not dice them as fine the next time.  It was super moist.

This is my second try at a cornbread recipe from Allrecipes.  This particular one is by far my favourite. It turned out slightly soggy, probably due to difficulties in getting precise measurements on my metric scales, and the fact that I added more creamed corn! Nevertheless it was delicious. I did not have fresh jalapenos so used some in brine. I also added some cayenne pepper which gave the cornbread a lovely kick. I will be making this again and will probably double the recipe next time!

this is a real good cornbread. We left out the hot stuff cuz we don't like to hurt while we eat. The only thing in our opinion is it would be better if it was sweet. However less sweet can be more depending on what you are serving it with. I served this with salmon Fillets with Creamy Dill, Our family cole slaw and french fries. Don't forget to refrigerate leftovers. we forgot and had to pitch 1/2 the cornbread this morning. :(  If you have vegetables or meat in cornbread you have to refrigerate.

My first attempt at mexican style cornbread and it turned out awesome!  I used white cornmeal, wasn't sure what kind to get and left out the onion.  The baking time was right on for me too.  The bread was perfectly moist and I forgot to add the cheese at the end on the top, but I was really pleased anyway.  My family loved the bread!  I can't imagine making any mexican dish from now on without it.  Thanks for such a simple and wonderful recipe!

I made this and took it to our huge 4th of July Shrimp and Sausage boil. It wasn't too spicy, but still had a kick, and it was almost melt in your mouth. My granddad even said it was the best cornbread he's ever eaten! I doubled the recipe, so it obviously took longer in the oven. Next time I might try and put bell peppers in too, so it will have more colors.

I made this just as recipe lists and it was fantastic! I think the reviews that listed it didn't set up or it was too moist or too much for the pan may not have followed it exactly. I looked high and low for an 8 ounce can of creamed corn and was only able to find 15 ounce cans, and if I had added it all it would not have come out right. I felt like this was a nice compromise between my husband who likes cornbread and myself who likes corn casseroles--not to plain, not to casseroly. All in all, its an excellent recipe.

This was pretty good but thought it needs a little tweaking.  I will make this again doubling the flour, add 1/2 lb. ground beef, cooked and seasoned with garlic salt, and add green chili peppers, also will cut the cheese into small cubes instead of shredding it using 1/2 sharp cheddar and 1/2 pepper jack.

Awesome. The whole family chowed down on this cornbread. I did add one more jalape√±o and left seeds in, but nothing else needed to be change. This recipe will be used many more times in the future.

added less jalepeno, didn't add the onion, didn't have buttermilk so I used half low fat sour cream and half milk. 
It was good, may add more jalepeno and use a cast iron pan next time

Wonderful recipe!  Moist inside, slightly crispy crust of cheese & slightly sweet with a lil kick!  Perfect for pairing with Hoppin' John, Chili, etc.  Turns out a beautiful golden brown.

Made absolutely no changes. This is absolutely delicious. Moist. I was worried about the jalape√±o peppers making it too spicy. I was wrong. Just enough flavor. Made this as a side with beef and spinach enchiladas.

Lower fat and sodium alterations:  saute onion and sweet red pepper till onion opaque (not brown), added small can green chilis, use no salt added canned creamed corn, add 2 tsp Tony Cachere's Creole seasoning and five or so twists of fresh black pepper mill.  Don't add the salt, there's enough provided by the canned green chili and creole seasoning, plus the spice makes up for the lower salt content and its usually served with salty ham and collards or chili.  Lower fat:  skip the grated cheddar, instead dot the top of the batter in the pan with rectangles of sliced sharp cheddar (like little tombstones) and you get little pocket of melty cheddar in every scoop.

So simple, so delicious! I only added 2 ingredients, 1 tbsp sugar and 1 tbsp cayenne. I did substitute butter for the oil. My oven required 10 minutes more, but the extra time was well worth the result. My new favorite to go with the Hellfire Chili.

Excellent recipe...I did change it a little though. I made a double batch and baked for 40 minutes since it was in a 9 x 11 glass dish. I did not use flour but all cornmeal mix since I don‚Äôt care for a cake like cornbread. Baked up golden brown with the added cheese on top! Taking it to a family dinner. I will update later.

Couple of change: instead of one large onion, I used 1/2 a small white onion; I used only 1 jalape√±o. Instead of dry ingredients, I used a box of Jiffy. I was able to find 8oz cans of non-gmo creamed corn. Let cool 20 minutes in pan before cutting.

Came out great.

Sorry, but disregard my good review. This looked great and smelled delicious,  but had no taste. I followed to recipe exactly.  I had two other people taste it to be sure and they agreed. A double batch in the trash. I guess it is a matter of your own taste buds.

This is so good. I make it as written only I use 2 tablespoons of jarred diced jalape√±o peppers with a little of the juice. I used an 8" x 8" square pan the first time I made it and a cast iron skillet the second time. The cast iron skillet is better, the outside is nice and crunchy.

Yum! Don't need to change a thing in this recipe. The cornbread is flavorful and melts in my mouth. I had to use kernel corn, since I had no creamed corn in my pantry, and it was still delicious!

I've been making this recipe for years.  It is one of my standbys.  It goes well with chili or as a main dish for breakfast.

I make the recipe as is or with whatever I have on hand, such as canned green chilis, roasted bell peppers, jalape√±o pepper jack cheese.  The only other change i make is that i cook it for an hour so that it is not mushy on the bottom.

To reheat it for breakfast, I put squares of cornbread in a skillet and fry each side, with or without butter in the skillet, till it is lightly brown.  it tastes great either way.

Taste/flavor was not  too bad. But the consistency was way too moist, and crumbly. Had to eat with a spoon.  If I try again will reduce to one egg and less cheese, onion, and corn to firm up consistency. But thanks for Recipe.

Long ago, my mother made Mexican cornbread. Since this was before the internet, she had found the recipe in a magazine or newspaper. I have been looking for a recipe that was like what she had made, and this is the closest to what she made that I have found, and so I am very happy. I don't think the recipe that she used had onions, and so I didn't use onions.

This was excellent!  The only thing I changed was to saute the onions and jalapenos, and I added about 1/3 cup of sugar. Oh, and it took about 45 min to bake in an 8x8 pan. It was perfect!  I couldn't stay away from it!  Thanks for the recipe!

I did have to substitute butter for the corn oil.  This came out very moist and delicious.  I think this would be great to serve with chili.  I did have to cook for an extra 5 mins to get this to be cooked all the way.  I used a medium yellow onion - i think the key to not having too  much onion is to be sure to chopped very fine so that it adds flavor but you are not biting into huge chunks of onion.

To serve as a sweet bread with brunch, I made again with an extra 1/2 cup sugar and using candied jalapenos (which are quite hot and a little sweet) and this was a solid 5 star - maybe six.

I made some changes due to ingredients on hand and preferences:  unsweetened applesauce instead of oil, added two tablespoons sugar, added 2 minced chipotle peppers, used mozza instead of cheddar, didn't use onion. Tasty and moist, but upon tasting I think the sugar was not needed (I had added it thinking it would offset the peppers, but it was not spicy at all--just a hint of a zing). Baked for full 35 minutes in cast iron skillet.

I made it with minimal changes: I used more jalapenos  (four in all) and added 1/4 cup sugar. And instead of greasing the pan I melted 3 Tbs. butter in it before adding the batter. I had to bake it longer, for about 45 minutes, but the results were delicious - moist, peppery, cheesy and just a little bit sweet, with a nice brown crust.

So, so moist. I cooked mine in a 10 inch cast iron skillet, and should have left it in the entire 35 minutes. It was delicious. I'll be adding a tablespoon of sugar and increasing the salt by 50% next time I make this.

This is similar to a recipe my family had used for years. I used this one as a guide because I misplaced my handwritten recipes during a recent long distance move. We add 1 lb of cooked, seasoned ground beef and bake one hour to ensure the middle is not wet.

I followed a few others and used pickled Jalapenos, didn't put the cheese on top and added 2-3 Tablespoons of honey.  Everyone enjoyed it.  Will make again!

Would absolutely make again!  A few of the changes I made:  
almond milk instead of buttermilk, just 1/2 an onion, about 1/2 cup cheese, (mixed into batter only) canned mild chilies instead of jalape√±o, then baked in my buttered cast iron skillet for about 40 minutes.  Try it served with sliced avocado!

I have another recipe for Mexican  corn bread but this one is much better. Rather than using fresh peppers I use canned and get the very hot. This recipe is much more moist than the one from Food Net Work. I will throw that one away and keep this one.

This was great. Definitely mix the cheese in and don't put it on top. I will add some sugar next time to sweeten it up a little.

I added about 1/4 cup of my roasted Poblano's  and I also made my own cream corn which is much better than canned from the store. .  I got rave reviews from all who tasted it!  Made it again with Anaheims, awesome receipt.

Have made this basic Jalapeno  Cornbread for years. Always A big hit with everyone. Very moist due to the cream style corn and cheese.. I add a little sweetness, with 3 Tbs sugar or honey.
If you have some in family that cant tolerate the spice/heat, poor half of the batter into baking dish before adding the jalapeno peppers. Be sure to Identify the hot/spicy side. Top it with slices of pepper. That way everyone is happy and no one gets a surprise .

This is a very good mexican cornbread recipe.  But, I have trouble with every mexican cornbread recipe being too mushy.  I think it's my fault, perhaps my oven is different, or the sea level thing?  But, the next day, it was sooo much better!  A friend suggested that I change from creamed corn to the sweet kernel corn drained.  I will try that.  She also suggested to add pepper flakes too, for more spice, as we would like it a bit hotter.  So, I will try again.  Otherwise, it has the right flavor!

I will make this again for sure.  I made a pot of beans and ham and didn‚Äôt have any Marie Callender‚Äôs, so I found this and we enjoyed it as much or better (also most cooks have all the ingredients in stock - no trip to the store).

Delicious! Made it exactly as written in a cast iron skillet. Moist and flavorful. I recommend mincing the jalapeno and onions or sauteeing them first so they won't be crunchy.

Great recipe! Very tasty, and the spice level is adjustable if you remove the seeds or leave some in! Mine seemed to take waaaay longer to cook though (but I think I have my oven to blame!) It was very moist when it came out of the oven, but still tasted great a day later once it "firmed up" a bit!

This recipe is missing some sugar.  When I looked at the ingredients it seemed like it would be a nice, moist cornbread with a kick and it was. However, when I started making it I was curious as to why there was no sugar at all. I do not like sweet cornbreads, but a little sugar is needed.  With some sugar, this would have been 5 stars.  It is moist and has a nice zing with two jalapenos.

This was delicious! Only thing was I had to bake it longer as it took a lot longer for the center to set. I did use an 8 inch square glass dish and it still took about 20 minutes longer to bake. Moist and delicious.

I used this recipe for my tamale casserole and it worked very well. I did use a can of chopped green chilis instead of the onion & jalapeno due to time constraints but I don't believe that changed the integrity of the recipe enough for it to not be rated as is. Thank you for this lovely recipe.

The cornbread had moisture going for it. However I made this recipe to the T and it was too savory for my taste. I think the onions and amount of cheese overwhelmed the cornbread flavor I enjoy.  Next time I'll look for something simpler.

I think this would be 5 stars as is, but I made some changes. I have a parrot that loves cornbread, but shouldn't have onion, so I left it out. I added 1 can well-drained Rotel, used coconut oil/not corn oil, yogurt/not buttermilk, coarse corn meal, bread flour & pickled jalapenos.  It is fantastic! So moist! Next time I'll use a 9"x 9" pan, as I don't want it so thick (2" in the 8"x 8"). I want to be able to fit the crispy cheese on top in my mouth with the rest of the bite...

I made this cornbread to accompany my three bean chili at a chili cook off. Folks loved it. In fact, I had to make a separate batch for two of my friends. Very very delicious.

Pretty darn good recipe. I added a full 14oz creamed corn after realizing it only called for an 8oz. Because I like mine sweet, added 1/2c sugar. Sliced fresh jalapenos which were crunchy after cooking which worked great because it was added to a bowl beans and ham. Good dish!

Nice moist cornbread.  Just the way my hubby likes it!  I can not buy buttermilk in Ecuador so I used plain yogurt and it came out fine.

Very dense(my family did not like the consistency)and quite bland even though I used two whole fresh jalapenos, I will stick with my basic cornbread and honey butter.

After reading reviews I used half the corn liquid and added 4 green onions. It does take about 55 mins to cook but is well worth it.  I'm giving the recipe to my kids. Can't wait to serve it at the family reunion

Made this for my husband and two of his friends... They LOVED it, ate the whole skillet in one sitting!  We're currently in the UK and I couldn't find buttermilk so I used 1tbsp of vinegar in a 1 cup measure, filled the rest of the cup with milk, let sit for a couple minutes before using. Also couldn't find creamed corn, so I used some frozen corn instead. Finally found cornmeal here under the label "maize meal" in a health food store... A finer grain than polenta, which is like yellow corn meal and also found in health food stores here.  Well worth the trouble!  Simple to make, everyone loved it! Very moist.

I loved this cornbread!  It smelled so delicious cooking and was very most and yummy.  The only thing I changed was that I used coconut oil instead of corn oil and dehydrated onions instead of fresh.  I will be making this again.

Great recipe. My mods: upped to 3/4 flour to give a little more body.  Added small can of green chilis and two chopped sarrento peppers. Definitely seed the jalapenos to get flavor without too much heat. Added a little garlic. I used  both a can of (no salt added) kernal corn and a can of (no salt added) cream-style. Need to bake about 45-50 minutes to get nice crust on top.  Also I recommend using the coarsest cornmeal you can get; I used polenta meal.

This was really good!! I only gave it 4 stars cuz I subbed part of the flour for mesquite flour. This gave it a nice smokey taste and brown color. I forgot to add the peppers & the cheese. It was T G  DAY and had way too much stuff going on in the kitchen. To be honest with you, I think I will heat it up in the morning and put pancake syrup on it!! Happy Thanksgiving! ! Thanks Lynn, loved this!!

I'd say 1 cup of onion is sufficient for this recipe. I speak from personal experience. That said, I have another cornbread recipe that I rather than this one. Thanks though!

This was a big hit at two different chili dinners (so far)!  I use less jalapeno, less onion and a Mexican blend of cheeses instead of just cheddar, but everything else is the same.  Nice and moist, very tasty and easy to make!

I made this recipes yesterday, made enough for 2 8 inch square pans, to take to a lunch I did for the guys at our local armory. The cornbread was the HIT! Will be making me another one today to go with the rest of the BBQ I made. I will also be trying it with green chilies instead of the peppers. I used a 1/2 can of chopped peppers btw, didn't buy whole peppers and cut them up. Can't do that with my contacts.

Great recipe, easy to adjust too. I have made it several times, with 2% milk, 2 cups of cheddar cheese in the mix, and half a can of mexicorn, without jalapenos or chilies. Came out fantastic, with great pepper taste without the heat (kid friendly!). I have also made it adding chopped ham. It's one of my family favorite sides to have whenever we barbecue.

I loved this. I did, however, change it due to lack of ingredients.  I am diabetic so instead of all purpose flour I used wheat.  I didn't have baking powder and used 21/2teasspoons of baking soda. I didn't have buttermilk and used skimmed.  Had no cream corn and used regular Kroger can corn.  Instead of corn oil I had 1/2 c of real butter on had.  I also added about 1/4c sugar because we like sweet.  I prayed it would turn out due to being out of Jiffy. LOL  I was amazed.  It was delicious.  I used all the other ingredients except Jalapeno peppers.  Didn't have any.  When it all came out it tasted like Chi Chi's cornbread they use to give on the side.  It was delicious.  Next time I will add a little more sugar for that reall Chi Chi taste.  I can't say this was a diabetic recipe, but it turned out great.  Loved the onion and had a big pot of beans waiting on the side.  Yum Yum

This did not turn out at all like "cornbread".  First I had to use a larger pan than called for and bake twice as long.  It was very moist, like a corn-cassarole.  Tasted ok, probably will not make this again.  Oh, and it did not look like the picture at all.

This is a great recipe! It can be varied up and changed, but the base ingredients make a cornbread that rises well and is moist and delicious. I took out the onion and added 1/2 cup sugar and it was great. I also have made it without onion, pepper, or cheese and added sugar and additional corn for a sweeter cornbread. This is a keeper for sure.

Very tasty! I made mini corn muffins, and while a little on the dense side, the flavor was there and great! Though, it was a bit more moist than other cornbread recipes i've used in the past.
