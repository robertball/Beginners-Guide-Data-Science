Great for gifts - however, 2 teaspoons/cup of water was far too watery, we increased it to 2 tablespoons to taste more chocolatey.

The reommended mix is somewhat watery.  I used  3 tsp. for a more chocolately taste.  I also added vanilla powder (1 tbsp) to the mix.  Very good!  Can be made with milk.  Sometimes with both the water or milk there were particles at the bottom of the drink that turned me off, eventhough I *knew* they were from the powdered milk.  To avoid this, make sure you don't have too much mix in the cup, and the temp. is high enough to disolve everything when you add it to the liquid.  Keep mixing as you sip...

YUCK.  If this rates five stars, I'm really, REALLY hesitant about trying the one that rates three!

Score!  Three ingredients=check.  No high fructose corn syrup=check.  Tastes as good as store-bought=check.  The only two things I did differently were increasing the cocoa to almost 1 cup; and using 1/4 c. mix per serving (which is what the canister from the grocery says to use).  Previously I have made this with confectioners' sugar instead of regular white, and it tasted bad.  It needed salt and vanilla when served.  But made this way, with only dry milk, white granular sugar, and cocoa, it needed nothing!  Little sis was happy that it didn't leave residue in the bottom of the cup, too.  We added whipped cream on top when we drank it, but it didn't need that.  I might give this as gifts this Christmas!

great basic mix. The more typical 2 tablespoons of mix tastes more like cocoa mix though. Typo?

I'll give it 4 stars cause I didn't use the recipe's measurements, I just went off of taste. I think I used about 7 cups of dry milk, 3 c cocoa powder and enough cups of sugar to make it sweet enough. I scooped some into individual cone shaped bags with crushed candy canes, milk chocolate and white chocolate chips, and mini marshmallows. I handed them out as gifts along with candy cane biscotti.  I also make my hot cocoa with hot milk instead of water, it comes out a lot creamier and frothy.

I used this recipe to make Christmas gifts a couple years ago.  It was a hit with everyone.  I also like to mix up a big batch and store it in a Tupperware container so I always have hot chocolate on hand.  It saves money to do it this way than always buying the packets!

As written, this is a little watery.  We had to add more, but this is a very easy recipe and worth trying.  We'll keep it on hand all winter!

This is my first one star rating.  I followed the directions and doubled it.  It was so watery.  I put 4 servings of the powder in 2 servings of water and it was too watery.

This is a good basic recipe.  I am thinking of adding cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger to it next time to make a spiced hot chocolate mix.

I used a food processor to make the mix easier to disolve when mixes with water.  Mixing with warm milk makes it creamer.

We use milk to make our hot cocoa, so I decreased the powdered milk to 1 packet (roughly 1 1/4C).  I also increased the cocoa to 1C and added 1/8t of sea salt. We use 2 heaping spoonfuls per mug of hot milk. Fantastic!

I added a little more sugar than it called for (1/2 cup more) and it turned out a quite good. We will be keeping this recipe! BTW...16 ounces of dry milk is about 7 cups. And, yes, use 2 tablespoons instead of teaspoons.

This is a simpler, tastier - and MUCH healthier - version of the hot cocoa mixes that call for non-dairy creamers...and one that can easily be adapted for vegans, as I have done.  I found that using a powdered soy milk in place of the milk powder and raw sugar in place of white yields a very tasty dairy-free hot cocoa mix.  I also used good cocoa powder purchased at my local Trader Joe's that is far superior in taste than Nestle's or any other overly-processed commercial brand.  I have not tried the healthier and caffeine-free option of carob powder in place of cocoa, but I'm sure it can substitute cocoa in much the same ratio.  With whatever type of chocolate powder used, one needs to adjust the amount used to taste - I found most of these recipes for powdered hot cocoa mix are far too heavy on sugar and not chocolatey enough for my palate!

I was trying to find a good cocoa mix for a bridal shower favor. You know, "the perfect mix." This wasn't it. The chocolatey taste seemed watered down. Not to my liking.
I was comparing three recipes for a taste test to pick which one to use. I'm not using this one.

I might have to try and make this one again just to make sure my measurements were correct.  When I made this I thought there was way too much cocoa powder and not enough sugar for my taste.

Watery if mixed as recommended.
I subbed Vanilla Creamer for 1/3 of the milk powder. Plain or Hazelnut would also work nicely.

Great option to eliminate buying hot chocolate packets.  Less expensive, have better control of ingredients and very easy to make.  I changed servings from 66 to 22 to make a smaller batch that better suited my needs.  I mixed two tablespoons of mix with warm milk and it was just perfect for my taste as a chocolate fan.  I will never buy hot chocolate mix from the store again.
