I'm 12 and made it with ease (after I found the recipe). My whole family loved it! My little brother   
hates chicken, but with this recipe asked for more!

I thought this was really good. The potato's were my favorite. Chicken was a little mushy for my taste. I think ill try brioling it for a few min. next time.

Pretty good, but chicken tends to have a soggy crust...The best part were the potatoes! They were great!

the chicken and potatoe wedges were easy to make and delicous, but the breading in the end turned out white! so next time i'll use yellow food coloring for the breading
