This is a FABULOUS recipe, even if you're not doing low-carb.  The whole family enjoyed this one and my daughter asked for seconds.  The only change I made was using a bag of frozen broccoli I needed to use, defrosting and draining it, and forgoing the boiling of the cauliflower as it was already tender when it defrosted.  I was very impressed by how thick and cheesy the sauce got after a spin in the food processor.  Definitely a keeper!

This was good - I was mostly curious about this recipe, but I can totally see loving it if I were on a keto diet. It doesnâ€™t take long to make and is oddly comforting. I put it under the broiler for a couple of minutes in the end to brown the top.

I prefer this to mac and cheese any day.   Someone gave 4 stars and said it was too much for a full meal.  Mac and cheese has always been just a side dish top me.

This was good, however, I wouldn't have it as a meal, but rather a side dish. Cheese sauce was very flavorful, but an entire bowl of it was too much for me. Would have been wonderful as a side to chicken or steak.
