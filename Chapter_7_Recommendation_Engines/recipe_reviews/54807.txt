My family loved it! I modified it somewhat, though. I used half and half, but only 1 1/2 cups chicken broth, which kept it from getting so runny. Also, I cooked the sauce with some of the bacon grease and added 2 tbsp minced garlic and 1/4 tsp ground onion; it gave the sauce a great flavor! Will definitely make it again!

After reading the reviewers that had problems with thickening the sauce, I used the tip of creating a roux with 2 tbs each of butter and flour before adding the chicken broth and cream.  I also used 1.5 cups of broth and 2 cups of half and half.  I let it reduce for a good while - at least the 30 minutes that the recipe called for.  It worked!  The sauce was plenty thick.  Next time, I would use more linguine or cut the sauce ingredients.  It was a bit too saucy.  I would also add more green vegetables like fresh green beans and broccoli.

I agree with the previous reviewer - the sauce won't thicken the way it should.  The flavor is really good, though, so I will make it again, with some changes.  Before combining the cream and broth, I'm going to make a roux of butter and flour (2 tablespoons of each) by melting the butter, then adding the flour and stirring.  Then I will add the broth and cream and proceed as directed.  I will probably also add a couple more pieces of bacon.  Other than that, this recipe is YUMMY.

Really good but due to the previous reviews of thin sauce I made adjustments but kept the ingredients the same.  I rendered the bacon in a pan and set aside on towel, reserving a few (4-5) tablespoons of bacon grease whisked in 2 tablespoons flour and whisked for 30 seconds.  Added 1 1/2 cup chicken broth and simmered for 2-3 minutes until thick, added 2 cups half and half and the chicken and simmered for 10 minutes and added the peas and the cheese, crumbled bacon, and salt, pepper and garlic powder.  Very good, thick sauce.

We tried this recipe and were very impressed! I did make a couple changes....I added the cheese to the broth and cream when it reduced and it really helped thicken it. Also, I added a few cloves of minced garlic, didn't use bacon and substituted broccoli for the peas!! Yummo!!! Love it!!

good and easy meal. i, too, used half and half instead of heavy cream, and did a roux to start, even so the sauce was a little runny, but really it was fine once it's all together with the chicken, peas, and noodles. it makes a whole lot of sauce so i served the sauce and noodles separately, and have lots of sauce for another meal. will be great with shrimp too! much better than jarred alfredo sauce.

I skipped the bacon and added garlic powder to my sauce, a dash of paprika, salt, pepper.  I knew it wouldn't be as thick since I used half & half so I mixed some cornstarch with broth to thicken... Pretty easy and I only simmered my sauce about 30 min.  :)

I started this recipe to a T and after an hour I still could not get the sauce to thicken so I ended up adding an extra cup of parm and it was the perfect consistency. It is a very tasty sauce and perfect with the bacon, chicken, and peas. I served over garlic chive pasta and DH just loved it.

As written -  I thought it was a good, basic recipe. The simmered chic broth and cream left the sauce runny but verrrrry tasty~ PLUS ~ I love that anyone can expand on it.  Will make again with additions which may include: rosemary or even basil in the simmering cream (depending on taste trying to achive), I could also see sauting the chicken with perhaps garlic and onions. Thanks!

I used fresh spinach instead of peas (just tear and add to sauce first, cook for 2 min, add chicken, etc). i also used chicken fajita strips (buy a bag at sams club) and use really good bacon for better flavor! awesome and easy!

Made this for dinner last night, left out bacon (dh) and peas (ds) and it turned out great.  Will definitely make again.  Will also make for myself with bacon.  Want to try adding brocolli to it next time.  Thanks for sharing!!

Very quick and easy as the title states. I too had trouble with the sauce thickening up as other reviewers mentioned but it was easily fixed with some flour and extra parmesan. Fast, easy, and flavorable for those times you don't have much time to spare. Mushrooms would be a nice addition for next time...just a thought.

I would make this again, but use less chicken broth, more freshly grated parmesan cheese, make a roux with bacon grease and as always with me, use more garlic.  I used an entire bulb of garlic I had roasted previously. I also recommend adding broccoli florets.  I also substituted rigatoni pasta because I just felt like having a more substanital pasta and it worked well.  It also needed more salt in my opinion.

Not bad.  I changed a few things due to lack of ingredients but it still turned out pretty good.  However, there is waaaaaay too much sauce for the amount of noodles and it's also quite soupy.  I tried thickening it up but that didn't work too well. :p  But it was still good and I most likely will be making it again in the future.

It took a little longer than I was hoping to make.  Once everything was finally put together, I too had issues with the sauce being too runny. But I must say that I used half and half (try to save on the calories).  If I were to make it again, I would use exactly what the recipe called for.  Perhaps it would have been a little better.  Overall, not bad at all, but not my favorite.

I'm a brand new "cook", just learning (at the sad age of 37), and this is one of the first recipes I tried. It came out wonderful!! Yes, sauce didnt thicken as I wanted too, but still, it was so so good. Thanks!

This was very good. My son cleaned his plate. I turned the heat up a little higher and watched it carefully after a half hour and saw it start to thicken quickly. Just read the nutrition info - will try again with half and half and spinach.

very good! only down fall is its definately not for people who are looking to watch their weight! i modified it by boiling the chicken with water and about 2 tablespoons of chicken boulion. I added about a table spoon of minced garlic, and about 2 tablespoons of flour to thicken up the sauce.  My family loved it! I will make this again!

This was delicious! The sauce did not thicken as I wanted, so I mixed a little corn starch with cold water and then added it to the sauce after I had added everything else. Easy to make and delicious.

i made this recipe tonight b/c I had all the ingredients on hand.  I cooked a "whole mess of chicken" and had stock and cooked chicken on hand.  the flavors of this dish are reminiscent of carbanara  so I knew it would be good.  well ... it was good but as other reviewers have said, the sauce is thin.  I did use 1/2 & /12 vs. heavy cream but I added an egg yolk for thickening/richness.  I don't think I'll make this again but it was tasty - and I know the leftover chicken/sauce will be good either on pasta or rice or as an ingredient in a casserole.

This turned out amazing! I didn’t have chicken, but will definitely add it next time. I was worried after reading the reviews that the sauce would be runny, but it wasn’t at all.

It was ok, not bad, not amazing. Sauce was too thin and seemed odd with the bacon. Sauce reminded me of alfredo sauce. I would’ve made it without the bacon if I do make it again. So tweeking recipe by either thickening sauce like other reviews had done and or no bacon. Just seemed like it didn’t belong.

I did not like this very much. Use a really good quality bacon because all you can taste is the bacon flavour. Also, the sauce did not thicken up. I had to add corn starch. I also added garlic, pepper, salt, and a pinch of red hot pepper flakes but didn't notice because of the bacon flavour.

Had trouble getting the sauce to thicken, just like everyone else.  It was bland.

To thicken the sauce, I cooked my noodles (4oz not 8) in it. It worked and saved me a pan. I cooked turkey bacon in the microwave and used a bag of green beans instead of peas. There were too many pans needed in this. Much more efficient ways to make this meal. For personal preference to save calories, I used 1.25 cup of almond milk and 4oz of neufchatel cream cheese instead of the cream. The second time I made this, I used 6oz fresh spinach and corn instead of peas. My husband really liked it.

This was a great recipe. I made a few tweaks...My husband doesn't eat pork, so instead of bacon I used smoked turkey sausage. I chopped it up into small pieces and fried it until crispy in butter and oil. It gave the dish just the amount of flavor and salt that the bacon would provide. I put fresh rosemary (2 sprigs) and some fresh thyme in my simmering cream mixture. At the very end I sprinkled about 1/4 tsp of nutmeg. It was awesome. It felt like a restaurant quality

MY husband and I gave this 5 thumbs up. I added fresh sauteed Portabella mushrooms. For the cooks that want a thicker sauce try this; when the sauce is simmered remove it from the heat and slowly add the FRESH Parmesan cheese in small amounts at a time, stirring continuously when the sauce is to the thickness you like THEN ADD the bacon and peas, I like to mix the pasta together with it all instead of pouring the sauce over the pasta. I hope this helps.

Have made the twice. Each time with a modification. The first modification was using Parmigiano-Reggiano in place if the Parmesan. I enjoy the slightly nutty flavor which Parmigiano-Reggiano brings to the sauce. Second time I made homemade pasta.  Homemade is a much lighter pasta. When combined with the Alfredo sauce the entire dish is not so heavy after the meal.

If you want to use Parmesan cheese and get that nutty flavor  provided by the Parmigiano-Reggiano add a 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg to the sauce.

If you are interested, this link will take you to a Web  page which discusses Parmesan vs. Parmigiano-Reggiano. https://www.thespruce.com/parmesan-vs-parmigiano-591198

I made this with some alterations. It was tasty and my family liked it. As others stated, it was very runny. I used shrimp instead of chicken and also substituted spinach instead of peas. I also added garlic and mushrooms. So yummy!

I should have read the reviews about the thin sauce. Nevertheless, this recipe is great. I seasoned the sauce while it was reducing with salt, black pepper and red pepper flakes.  And I added chopped mushrooms. Very tasty!  Next time I will go the way of a roux.

I agree with the reviewer that said that the photo that goes with the recipe is not the same as the original photo which looked appealing. In the second picture above the ingredients there is broccoli not peas and it looks overcooked and  gluggy. So thanks everyone for your comments and I won't bother to follow this particular recipe.

Are you sure the photo is correct? The recipe calls for English Peas, but I'm seeing chopped broclie.

This recipe may be quick, but not very healthy with the heavy cream  & bacon, maybe you could substitute  Canadian bacon or pancetta  for regular bacon & some low fat cream for the heavy cream!!

I followed this recipe and my sauce would not thicken.  I did use heavy cream.  I also added the peas to the pasta water, or they would not have been cooked.  It was flavorful - how could it not be with heavy cream, Parmesan, and bacon - but I don't think I'll make it again.

The flavor was nice but just as other reviewers stated the sauce wouldn't thicken up enough to cling to anything. So most bites were boring and plain but the bread dipped in the sauce left on the plate was yummy. I am hoping that reheated as a leftover it will be better but not planning on making this again as written.

As a previous reviewer said, it's basically pasta carbonara.  My husband and I liked it and didn't have problems with the sauce thickening....don't know why others did.  I do tend to "tweak" just about everything I make.  It's the type of recipe that's simple enough that HE can make it!

This was not that great.  It is the same as Pasta Carbonara but not as good nor as easy.
