This pie is absolutely incredible! It is kind of like eating a rich Reese's Peanut Butter Cup but a million times better! The reviews saying it is "too rich" are ridiculous. Yes this pie is VERY rich but that is how peanut butter pie is supposed to be. I made a homemade chocolate graham cracker crust and I HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend that you do the same and double the recipe to make the crust extra thick. Regular store bought ones are too thin and do not provide enough of a balance of peanut butter and chocolate.

I was out of town and my son wanted peanut butter pie and i have my go to recipe only it's not in my allrecipes yet and it was at home ugh. but i searched on here and found one that was pretty close to what i make. It is very rich but that is fine I ate a small piece. I used oreo cookie crust and i also added chocolate pudding on top and i froze and chopped up reese cups and put those on the top. It was delish and rich but worth every bite!

It was very delicious! I accidentally bought crunchy peanut butter and decided to add it anyways. Result was absolutely amazing. Good recipe!
