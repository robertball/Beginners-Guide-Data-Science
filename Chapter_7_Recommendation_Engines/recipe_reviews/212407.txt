This one is on my christmas cookie list! It is hard to find really good cookie recipes with all natural ingredients. I got the peanut butter ground fresh at whole foods and I usually use sugar in the raw anyway. I had to buy the Stevia in the raw online since they don't sell it by me yet.   This one is a keeper.  (if you like it moister you want to get the CREAMY peanut butter)

I made some modifications to this recipe:  Melted the butter and added the peanut butter to the butter, then the eggs.  Mixed well and then mixed with the dry ingredients.  No need to chill the dough.  Cooks in about 15 minutes, depending on your oven.  To prepare and cook took about an hour total.  The recipe contains sugar -- was hoping to use only Stevia and no sugar.
