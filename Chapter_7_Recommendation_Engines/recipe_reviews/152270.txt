This is really good and everyone loves it!  The first time I made this I left out the cilantro because one of the guests hates it, but I just made it with the cilantro and it was even better.  Only change I made was to use 1/4 cup lime juice and 1/4 cup rice vinegar instead of the 1/2 cup rice vinegar, mainly because I really like lime.

This recipe is awesome. I changed it a little. I reduced it by half and still got a medium bowl full.  I used regular vinegar vs rice vinegar and used a little more sugar to make up for the regular vinegar.  My family could not get enough of it, ran out of scoop chips before I did the dip.  Loved it and will make on a regular basis!

I took this recipe to a BBQ for the 4th and it received rave reviews.  So many people commented that it was delicious and requested the recipe.  I served it with tortilla chips, but people enjoyed scooping it up with celery, red pepper, and even used it as a condiment on their hot dogs and burgers!  I cut the recipe in half after reading other reviews and it still made plenty for the crowd of 20 that were at the cookout.  I did make the full amount of dressing, but reduced the amount of olive oil by 1/2 since some people said it was too oily.  It came out great! Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

12/09 An almost guiltfree appetizer I'm with the group saying the recipe makes too much.I used 1black,1pinto,1corn,4oz chiles,1jalepeno(which was like adding more green if it's seeded & cored well.I added another not as well emptied.Improved much.Then had a little kick.); half red,half green,half onion,half dressing(Half of the half amont of oil - meaning 1/8c.That's a coffeescoop,btw)In dressing I tried half vinegar,half limejuice 1T sugar&1t fresh garlic.I couldn't taste the vinegar, which I liked;but not the lime too much either.What I'm going to do next time is a can of black&pinto,can of corn;4oz chiles;whole green&red pepper;2jalepenos;bunch of cilantro;a cup of red onion;only lime juice&a clove or two of fresh garlic with 1/8c olive oil.Seems to me the sugar would make the veggies weep more.You want some,but not to encourage.Gonna add tomatoes,too.  First time around was good,but too beany.Think more veggies will balance it better.Might even try serving room temperature with refried beans to help bind the babies together.It tends to jump.4/12 'Tried again.Not so impressed this time.No, not bad;but no wows either.Did 1black,1pinto,2 green peppers,2japs,1/2c red onion,1c corn, 1/2bunch cilantro (bout 1c),2plum toms, 3cl garlic,1t kosher salt,1T olive oil,3T lime juice,a T chipolte pepper w adobo sauce,1/4t cayenne.Not so pretty ;D but still pretty healthy (Win!).Soo,if I make again,I'll add more lime juice&more spice.This is one to play with. 3 1/2 stsrs

Great recipe, I would recommend using only half the amount of beans and corn, but exact amounts of everything else.  Kick it up a bit with some "Frank's Red Hot".  This is great party food, you will get a lot of compliments.

Yes, this does make a lot, but that was a good thing because at the potluck I took this to, many people were eating it as a side rather than a dip.  Great make ahead dish - I tossed it all together and kept it in the fridge for 24 hours before serving and it had a great flavor. The beans had softened up a bit, but that was a good thing, in my opinion.  Only changes I made were a little less oil and I tossed in two chopped avocados right before serving.

Awesome.  This recipe got raves from all of my boyfriend's friends at our UFC gathering.  I use my food processor to chop up the onion and peppers.  I also used 2 cans of diced tomatoes with green chilies, juices drained.

I've been using this recipe as a base for my Texas Caviar for awhile now.  Fixed it for my card club for the first time and had several "volunteer" to take some home with them (and request that I give them the recipe). You really can mix up the ingredients any way you want. It is the dressing that makes all the difference. The only change I make to it is that I use seasoned rice vinegar. Just way better than the Italian dressing!

UPDATE: This is still my favorite and crowd favorite. I never use the Pinto beans. We just don't like them. What separates this recipe from all the rest is the rice vinegar mixture (I use seasoned rice vinegar) - DO NOT USE ITALIAN DRESSING. That makes this recipe like all the rest, which are good - just not as good as this.

I like the size of this recipe. I followed the recipe, except I use a bag of frozen yellow corn. It tastes great and is more colorful. It freezes well, so I put 8 to 16 0z containers of it in the freezer.  Then when we have company or just have a craving, I just thaw it out. It tastes like I just made it.

Very pretty dish!  I cut the recipe in half and still filled a medium-size bowl.  It keeps well in the fridge though so I don't mind the leftovers.  I didn't have pinto beans so used kidney beans instead and it was fine.  Also, when I tasted the dressing, it seemed just a tad bit olive oil-y so I added a squirt of "Zesty Italian" dressing and that was good.  We ate this as a side dish with Black Bean and Rice Enchiladas and also as a dip with tortilla chips.  I prefer it with the chips but hubby liked it all by itself!

I loved this! I made it on a sunday and ate it as a snack throughout the week. Like others, I halved the recipe and it was plenty. I used seasoned rice vinegar and omitted the step where you have to heat the vinegar and sugar. Seasoned vinegar essentially does that for you. No need to add sugar at all. I used less oil, but more vinegar (I like things extra tangy). It could have been a tad spicier, so next time I will use more jalapeño and/or green chilies. I also used black eyed peas instead of pinto beans. YUM!

Very good recipe, but I will definitely cut it in half next time unless I'm serving a huge crowd!  When I make it again, I will reduce the oil by half, reduce the pinto beans by half and add chopped avocado.  Very good with tortilla chips and BF liked it piled on top of the Salsa Chicken recipe from this site.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

I gave this 3 stars because I changed up the recipe to my own tastes. I made the sauce but after tasting it, the sauce is just way too sweet! Who wants sweet and sour Mexican food?  I prefer spicy, salty, lime flavor myself. I didn't use canned beans (used dried and precooked myself), used fresh corn, roasted my own green chili's on the grill, added fresh diced avocado, white onions, fresh garlic and cilantro. I used a drizzle of olive oil, lots of fresh lime juice and some juice from a can of jalapenos I had on hand. I completely skipped the sweet bell peppers, sweet red onion, sweet vinegar, and sugar. Made my way, it was fantastic! Served it over barley I had precooked and then sauteed with garlic, CA chili and cumin. It made the best taco's ever! Thanks for the recipe. As a relatively new vegetarian I've been struggling to find things I can make with flavors I love that don't include meat. This recipe sparked my creativity and although I didn't care for it as written, it was a starting point for something I will make again and again. Thanks!

I know how it frustrates some users (myself included) when folk rate a recipe after making substantive modifications, but here goes.  I wanted to pass along some alternative directions, using fresh (rather than canned) ingredients.

I used one pound each of fresh black-eyed peas and fresh black beans (simmered for about 45 mins in lightly salted water) and the kernels from five ears of fresh sweet corn (boiled for about six minutes).  I also substituted one "sweet Texas" onion for the purple onion and added two avocados (both "chunked").  Other than those changes, I followed the recipe more or less exactly.  Oh ... I added the juice of two limes and a scant tablespoon of salt (to compensate for the salt otherwise supplied by the canned beans and corn).  Very tasty!

Great recipe, and perfect for a crowd as it makes a ton ! Not only good to scoop up with chips, it's a healthy side dish. I made turkey tacos and stuffed the tortilla with turkey, Mexican rice, Texas caviar, shredded cheese, and a dollop of sour cream. My boys loved it. I did add some cumin, paprika, dash chili powder,  splash of fresh lime juice, and fresh black pepper as well to the recipe.

Loved this, works great as a dip, side dish or taco topping.  I used black eyed peas instead of pinto beans and added a little salt and pepper to the dressing.  My jalepeno was a little mild, next time I'd use two.

I doubled it for a 100 guest pig roast. Only two changes - used 1 can pinto and 1 can small white beans instead of 2 cans pinto beans and added 2 diced avacados. I made it the day before and everyone loved it, but it even got better with one more day of allowing the flavors to develop and marry. So, if possible make two days in advance. You will not be disappointed.

I made this for my vegetarian, 8th grade daughter's school lunch.  She and her friends liked it so much they all asked for the recipe.  I've been asked to make it for her "lunch table" several times already this school year.

I never ever rate a recipe without eating a portion, but this is the one exception.  I made the dressing as written, but the smell was absolutely atrocious and the flavor was even worse.  If there was a recipe for "stinky gym sock bean salad" this would be it.

Very yummy dip, perfect for pairing with fajitas.  I altered the recipe slightly following some of the other reviewers; I split the recipe in 1/2 with exception of the green chiles, prepped the peppers and onion in a food processor, added in a can of drained diced tomatoes and a can of drained sliced black olives.  For the dressing I used pre-made italian (1/2 a cup) for ease.

I received this recipe from a friend after eating this dip at her home.  I prepared it at my house and many friends loved it.  This recipe does make quite a bit of bean dip so you can share.

I made this to take to a Daytona 500 party and everyone raved about it.  It did make a lot but I'm okay with that.  I have been taking leftovers to work and putting it on my salad at lunch time. Fabulous!

YUM.  though, unless you're expecting A LOT of company - definitely halve the recipe.  A half recipe still makes a giant bowl.

Fantastic recipe! I have made it several times over the years and it always gets rave reviews! As others have said, the recipe as written makes a ton! If possible, make it a day in advance to allow all of the different flavors a chance to blend together, it's as close to a guaranteed hit as you will have at any get together!

I loved this recipe!! I wanted to cut it in half, but ended up only cutting the beans in half and it still turned out great! I guess that's what you get when you are making a new recipe with kids under your feet! :)

YUM!  I added some cold, cooked rice and made this into a salad.  With some lime juice and sriracha for added "oomph" this was absolutely delicious.  I halved the recipe and it still made tons, but it was so good I could have almost finished it off myself!

Made this for a family party - it was ok. Everyone liked it - but it didn't get rave reviews. I added some spices and tomato because i thought it to be a bit bland - and even after that I still found it to be a bit bland. Will I make it again? Maybe - but it definitely needs tweaked.

This is the BEST fresh bean dip/appetizer ever!  Used chickpeas instead of black-eyed peas.  Used the juice of one lime.  EXCELLENT.

Yum Yum!! Cut recipe in half, but used the whole can of green chiles, and the whole jalapeno pepper. Did not make the sauce given in recipe, but used half a bottle of Zesty Italian. Served with Tostito bowls with a hint of jalapeno, got rave reviews. Thanks so much for a great recipe Cassgirl 89

Awesome!!!  I did have the beans and corn as suggested.  It made plenty.  I used garbanzo beans instead of pinto, just a personal preference.  I would suggest also halving the dressing too, I had to dump some out because it was too juicey.  I definitly would take the time to make your own dressing...its so much tastier than the italian dressing! LOVE THIS!!

This was one of the prettiest dishes I've ever prepared.  I used one red and one orange pepper (they were on sale) Everyone loved this , I served it as a side to sandwiches. I will definately prepare this often, it's easy and healthy.  Will be great at a summer barbeque.

Very good recipe, half it and it still makes a large bowl.  I will omit sugar, I only put 1tbsp. due to other ratings and the sugar does not belong. I'm draining it and redoing marinade without sugar. I also added ground cumin to taste, about 2tsp.

Soooo good!  I took this dish to a party and people kept talking about how good it was.  It has a nice fresh taste.  I cut the recipe in half for a group of about 20, and it was still plenty!  I was sad when we ran out of chips.

This recipe is great and was a hit at my Bunco party!  Easy to put together. I added two plum tomatoes with mine. I did have lots leftover, but I'm okay with that.  I'm just glad I have chips leftover too! :)

Although this makes WAY more than 10 servings (I would say closer to 30) it is fantastic. I make it just the way the recipe reads, and have never been disappointed. This is great for cookouts, parties, or even just snacking.

I like an assault on my tastebuds, so I add about 2.5 tsp of ground cumin, increase the garlic powder to 2 tsp and double the rice vinegar.  I omit the oil and reduce the sugar to about 1 Tbs.  Healthy and full-flavored!

Loved this recipe.  Added avocado at the end with some more lime, as well as fresh chopped tomato.  The recipe is great as is for a large party, but as suggested, I would cut this in half for my own family.  Great as a dip or a side dish.

I love salsas and this is a great twist with a nice kick. It is awesome and fresh tasting. I used apple cider vinegar rather than rice vinegar and a little lemon juice and skipped the sugar. Also used the canned tomatoes with the chillies in them for a little extra veggies. Great for as a side salad or in a wrap too!

Should be called "Crack" Texas Caviar...it is that good. Used granulated Splenda instead of sugar. Made 5 servings but kept the 10-serving amounts of bell peppers, onions, vinegar and chile peppers. Also threw in 1/2 can of garbanzo beans I had left over. Fantastic!

Excellent!  Substituted cider vinegar for the rice vinegar. Also used 2 jalapeno peppers the second time I made it, which gave it a little more zip.  We like it with corn scoops as well.

My family couldn't get enough of this at Super Bowl. I subbed black eye peas for the corn-just personal preference. Also added garlic powder and some hot pepper sauce to kick it up.  We love this with corn chip scoops.

Definitely half the recipe, even for a party.  Even half makes a rather large serving.  I always add a diced avocado and tomato right before serving.  It's always a hit.  I add an extra jalapeño, a bit of cumin, cayenne (if it's not spicy enough) and more garlic.  I try to make it the day before because it needs some time for time for the flavors to meld together.

Great for a party.  I cut down the ingredients and it still made a lot.  Very delicious!  I served it with tortilla chips.

This is the BEST appetizer ever!  Every time I bring it somewhere I get asked for the recipe.  One time I was asked about 1 minute after placing it on the table!  It is so easy to make and it makes a ton.  I use black eyed peas in place of the pinto beans.  We even put it on our burgers sometimes!  Love it!!!!

EXCELLENT. I DOUBLED AND IT SAID IT WOULD SERVE 20 
OMG IT WOULD HAVE SERVED ABOUT 50. GREAT ON FLOUR TORTILLA WITH BBQ. I changed pinto beans to light red kidney. Beans and left out the hot peppers and then add green chili's

It's not Texas Caviar without black-eyed peas, so I didn't even consider using black and pinto beans in this.  (Not that I don't like both, but they're not for this dish)  Used frozen corn and apple cider vinegar in place of rice vinegar.  Very, very good, although this amount of sugar definitely means this is a pretty sweet dish.  Use less sugar if you want the flavor to be entirely savory.

Absolutely delicious!  I always stayed away from making Texas caviar because of the use of Italian dressing, which I do not care for.  So, when I saw this one I had to make it and it did not disappoint at all.  I did have to sub kidney beans for the pinto beans, because that is all I had on hand, but I can't wait to try it with the pinto beans next time.  The flavors are perfect.  It goes well with tortilla chips or just plain...either way it is going to be my go to salad/salsa for the summer.  Thanks a million!

Fabulous! Makes a ton, but it was mostly gone in one night.  I made as directed, but next time I will add more chopped jalapeno, just for my taste. I'm not a big cilantro fan, but this recipe really tasted great with it. I didn't add quite as much as the recipe calls for, but I will next time.  The taste and colors were fantastic, and the texture was nice in your mouth.  Equally good to eat with spoon, or put into quesadillas the next day.  None went to waste. I already gave away my printed copy! A definite keeper.

I made this to serve at our house to eat while watching a football game and we almost finished it an hour before the start of the game!  THIS WAS DELICIOUS!!  Served with lime chips and was a hit.  I didn't make any changes and it was awesome as is!  I'm definitely making this again in the future!!!

Made this for a family get together. Everyone seemed to like it, though no one raved. I thought is was a little bland but the basic recipe was good. I added another 1/2 jalepeno, and a little garlic powder..I thought it helped. Probably would make again with modifcations.

Oh this is soooo yummy.  My family couldn't stop eating it at Thanksgiving.  They were almost too full for turkey!  I did make changes as I see many have.  I used 2 cans of mixed beans, a "bunch" of cilantro which was probably a little over a 1/4 cup, half a medium red bell pepper and half a green one and a whole small red onion.  I used about two tablespoons of pickled hot jalepenos, 4 cloves of garlic finely minced and substituted lime juice for the rice vinegar.  I also omitted the sugar so didn't cook the mixture first just shook the lime juice and o o in a bottle to emulsify.  I also made it the day before to let the flavours meld.  Was a real hit and so much less expensive to make than our other favourite - seven layer dip!  Easier on the waistline too!!

LOVED this recipe!!  Took it to a graduation party (1st time I ever made it) and everyone was asking for the recipe.  I think I'll try adding avocado next time.  This recipe makes a HUGE amount.  I would cut in half if using as a dip (the whole amount makes a large "salad" :)  It is very pretty with all the colors.  Lots of chopping involved, although not a difficult recipe, just time consuming!

This was easy and delicious.  I used Bush's low sodium beans to cut down on the sodium a little, and didn't miss any flavor.  I also added 2 tablespoons of freshly squeezed lime juice (because I had it handy).  I made it to bring to my in-laws and was immediately told that some of them don't eat beans.  Well, they ate this like crazy -  ha ha!  Great recipe - I'm planning to make more next weekend!

I love this recipe. It's the best.It refrigerates for quite awhile so is ideal for snacks and easy lunches. It's fantastic with corn chips or with avocado and cheese in a wrap. Try adding some cumin!

This is good. I halved this recipe, except for adding the full amount of green chiles because I had a whole can. I used yellow pepper instead of green. I did think there was something a little lacking in the dressing - maybe cumin. I may add some to the leftovers. This was great with grilled steak and lime. Thanks!

I brought this to a superbowl party and it was a hit although I thought it lacked 'personality'.  I did way less corn, I only did black beans, and I added some salt and some garlic to it.  It was good but not great.

This recipe was a great base for the way I like Texas Caviar. I ended up using two cans of black beans and one can of corn, then halved the rest of the ingredients. I added one tomato, diced and seeded and 1 avocado. Like another reviewer, I halved the dressing, and still found it to be too much. I also added 1/2 tsp ground cumin and 1/4 tsp ground corriander to the dressing and substituted 2 cloves minced garlic for the garlic powder. I like how this recipe boils the dressing and then lets it cool; that mellowed the flavor of the garlic a bit. With these additions, I give it five stars! Perfect "side" to bring to parties and BBQs!

So good! I added a can of drained chopped tomatoes w/chilies and skipped the can of chilies. I used a sweet onion and did not need any additional sugar. I also added some feta and avocado at the end. Served with some home baked torilla chips for a low fat high fiber treat. Great recipe for a crowd!

I thought this was absolutely delicious, though it wasn't a big hit at my Christmas party. Someone commented that it was a pretty dish but nobody seemed to eat it except for me. I'll probably make this again as a cold salad but not for a party. I think our friends must not be bean eaters. FYI, this was easy to eat and delicious with Fritos Scoops.

This recipe is fantastic.  Every time I make it I get rave reviews and it disappears.  Yes, it makes a lot, so if you are offering a lot of other dishes you might want to cut it in half.  However, leftovers are great...I slice some grilled chicken and offer it up as fajitas.

Really liked this recipe.  I read the reviews and took some suggestions.  I used navy beans instead of pinto beans, and half the cilantro suggested per my personal taste.  Only complaint was too much oil.  I will cut back on that next time I make it.  There will be a next time.

I skip the green pepper and use an orange or yellow. I also use green onions for the onion. I use a 1/2 cup  to 3/4 cup of sugar and 1 cup of oil.  I aldo incorporate 2 cloves of minced garlic into bean mixture and skip powdered garlic.  I have not tried this with cilantro although I do like cilantro.

I thought this was pretty good the first night, but it was delicious the next day. I served it as a side dish (no chips), and I modified it somewhat based on personal preference: I omitted the pinto beans; added tomatoes and nopalitos (pickled cactus); used fresh corn and garlic; used freshly roasted Hatch green chiles (’tis the season in NM); subbed agave for sugar; and didn’t cook the dressing. I thought it was a touch too sweet the first night, but by the next day the flavors had blended and the heat of the chiles really came out.

This is wonderful! Then I wrapped it up in Jalapeno-Cheddar soft tortilla with sour cream, lettuce and a little turkey and it made a fabulous wrap!  A recipe will give us lunches for a week.

I've made this like 20 times because everyone loves it, even the picky eaters. I think this is the only vegetables some of my relatives eat all year.  I go a little stronger on the vinegar and lighter on the oil, and add a little salt. It tastes a lot better if you make it 12 hours ahead of the party so the flavors can meld together in the fridge.

This is great. It's my new go to potluck dish withtortilla chips. Everyone raves about it.  They want the name, recipe, etc. They always go for seconds or more. There are two rice vinagers one sweetened and one not.  I've tried it with both at different times. It didn't make a difference, they tasted the same.  I've also used splenda instead of sugar. Works well too.  Thank you for sharing this recipe with us.

Went over well for a work carry-in dinner.  I added cumin to give it more zip and doubled the garlic.  I will next time double the cilantro and use minced garlic adding ginger.

This recipe is always a fantastic hit. Are use a quarter of the olive oil and instead of sugar use seven packets of Splenda three if you’re cutting the recipe in half I also triple the amount of garlic powder. This recipe is fantastic with scoops but you can also eat it as a salad

I made this for a Halloween party. I hollowed out a pumpkin for the Texas Caviar and put the chips in a plastic Trick or Treat pumpkin.  Yummy and Super cute!

Mostly used for the dressing. Used a can of black beans, lentils and chick peas. Added red pepper, celery, red onion, canned corn, tomato, cilantro. You could pretty much use any bean or veggie you prefer. Great recipe

I followed the recipe to the letter.  It was delicious.  I enjoy the original Texas Caviar with blackeyed peas too but this is a nice change.  Great on a hot Texas Summer day!  Warning this recipe makes ALOT so cut it in half if you're not feeding a crowd.  Our friends couldn't stop eating it!!

We served it with Tostito's scoops.

I was disappointed! The flavor was bland and the texture, mushy. Perhaps I did not buy high quality ingredients. I will try this again and use better judgment before making a final rating

This was so good, I made it as is and can't imagine it any better. Took it to a cookout party and it was a hit. Thanks for a great recipe, it will be a wonderful in my collection especially with smoked meats.

I have shared this recipe 10s if times. It lasts so long in the refrigerator—you can eat as appetizer with chips, a side for many Mexican dishes, top off grilled chicken or pork. It’s a family and grandkids favorite!

I really liked this recipe - it gave me a base upon which I could  play with ingredients. I can't resist adding ingredients to make it my own. In this case it was some chopped tomato and a good-sized dash of fresh lime juice. This is addictive stuff!

I made this as a bean salad instead of a chip salsa.  I'll definitely make it again, but I'll probably cut the sugar in half.  It was a bit too sweet for me.

Great!!  Used 1/2 can diced jalapeño instead of fresh.  Used only one can of pinto beans.  Used apple cider vinegar instead of rice vinegar.  Yum, yum!

Everyone loved it on Fathers Day. I made a few alterations. Instead of sugar I used Splenda and I eliminated the chilies and jalapeño peppers. I used one cup of fresh salsa but still added the cilantro and peppers.

Yes, this makes a lot and I cut it as well. My changes are that I cut the sugar out entirely and no one has noticed. I use habanero peppers instead of jalapeño because it kicks it up a notch. Other than that it's a perfect recipe and a healthy one at that!

Only made 1/2 of the recommended recipe, and we used fresh corn in lieu of canned or frozen.  My daughter and I ate it every time we snacked for 2 consecutive days.  Just purchased the ingredients again to make this weekend.

I likes this version because it didn't use black eyed peas, although I didn't make the dressing.  Instead, I used a suggestion of one reviewer and used the juice of one lime + zest.  I also added a generous shake of McCormick Perfect Pinch Mexican seasoning. Also I added some avocado.  Served with scoops chips at a potluck... They ate every bite .

This was superb! I reduced the vinegar by 1/4 cup, added 1/2 fresh lime juiced and 1/4 tsp each cayenne pepper and cumin (so I gave it a 4 instead of 5 but only for not liking too much vinegar and wanting more spice). I took it to work (I work with nurses, md's, lab techs, pharmacists) and the bowl was licked clean!  Everyone wanted the recipe! Its a keeper cowboy!

This recipe is wonderful! I've made it twice and it's always a hit at parties. I only added cumin and avacado because I love those ingredients. I'd also like to try adding Rotel. Thanks for the great recipe!

I've made this twice now.  The first time I made it as written and it was wonderful although a little sweet.  The second time I used Italian dressing instead of the dressing made with the recipe.  I didn't see much difference in the two and found it just as good.  I'll definitley make it again.  If I do use the recipe as written again, I'll not use as much sugar.

I made this with a few substitutions to this recipe: I didn't have cilantro, so I used it's seed: corriander; no red onion, so I used cumin, red cayenne, and salt; no pinto beans, so I used canellini beans. It still tastes great. I made this years past with cucumber and some goat cheese crumbles, too.

Love this recipe! I have been making this on and off for years. I've served it as a dip but normally serve it as a side dish. Someone suggested in one of the reviews to try adding cold, cooked white rice to make it a salad, and I will probably try that next. Delicious!

In my desperate search for something that would taste like the Cowboy Caviar that I was able to purchase only once at Costco, I found this recipe. I've gotta say, this is VERY close! I made it exactly like the recipe, except for substituting yellow onion for the red, only because I forgot to buy the red onion. I didn't add jalapeno. I did add a squeeze of fresh lime juice. It is definitely a keeper that I will keep making!!!

Delicious!!! Big hit with my family!! I used apple cider vinegar because I didn't have rice vinegar! I used 2 cans black beans, 2 cans corn, and 1 can of white harmony (white corn), also i use 1 can of tomato checks with green chillies!

Love, love, LOVE this recipe! I halved it but still used used the full 4 oz can of chiles. Super easy to whip up. I can eat it with a spoon (guilty) but I prefer to serve it with scoop chips. The longer it sits, the better it gets. A++ in my book!

A client of mine made this for my office one day and after telling me where she found the recipe, I came right out and added it to my recipe box. I made this for the first time yesterday for a picnic with my motorcycle club and everyone loved it. They were even eating it without the chips as a salad. Made exactly as written, with the exception of garlic. I doubled it. I like garlic.  :)

I really like that this recipe made it's own dressing. However, the sugar was way too much for me - came out way too sweet. I would cut the sugar in half next time. 
I also like it less beany so I left out a can of beans, and used black eyed peas instead of pinto.

This is my favorite version of Texas Cavier.  Healthy, easy and makes a ton!  Get a couple bags of chips--you will need them!

The picture looks like it is topped with shredded lettuce however do not see it listed in the ingredients.  Do you top it with shredded lettuce?

I drain the dressing right before serving; makes it easier and less soggy when using with the "scoop" party chips.

CASSGIRL89, this stuff is amazing!  I made it with black eye peas instead of the pinto beans out of personal preference, but kept the rest of the recipe intact.  I could not keep folks out of the bowl when I put it out for the tailgate potluck.  It was gone before I knew it (so glad I saved some in the freezer for me!). A definite keeper!

Very good.  Obviously people can make changes for their preferences.  We like 2 cans of corn to one can of black beans.  Great for potlucks!

Good but I think next time we'll use less sugar.
