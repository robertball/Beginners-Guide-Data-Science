I made this exactly as stated in the recipe. It was good as is, but lacked a little flavor for me. To give a little depth to this dish I sauteed up some fresh garlic and thyme and added it. This addition made it more flavorful for me. I love, love, love how easy this is to make!

I think this was really good for a quick basic meal.  maybe better with some added garlic..but I add garlic to everything.

Veggie version, doubled mushrooms.  Add italian seasoning, thyme, garlic, black pepper, salt, red pepper flakes.  Would add some lemon zest as well.

I don't know if I did something wrong, but it was bland and the ricotta cheese was grainy, it wasn't a sauce at all.

I used a variety of wild mushrooms, including woodear, golden lion, cauliflower, whole milk ricotta, longaniza. fresh spinach and added chili oil with the pepper flakes. It still needed some salt so I topped it with parmesan and myzithra cheeses. 

I am going to make muffin pan fritattas with the mix instead of using pasta for a brunch option.

This is a really good pasta dish.  Only change I made was to add a little  salt,basil , oregano and finely sliced garlic. I also whisked in a little pasta water into the ricotta cheese before adding.  Sprinkle some Parmesan cheese on when serving. Thanks for another recipe to add to my rotation.

I added red onions and tomatoes. I didn't like the taste too well in the end. The ricotta cheese made the texture grainy.
