I completely disagree with the other reviewer... but I did make some changes which may have made these cookies come out so good. First of all I don't have aspartame (nor would I use it if I did) so I used 4 packets of Truvia instead. I didn't refrigerate overnight (because the batter was so good I wanted to try them already!) so since the batter was still a bit runny I baked them in muffin tins instead of in cookie-form. THANKS for a great healthy recipe!

I found these to be lacking in flavour and the texture was odd maybe I cooked the fruit for too long and there was not enough liquid. I will try again and this time add some spice to give them a lift.
