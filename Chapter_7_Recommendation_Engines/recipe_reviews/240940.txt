This is one of my go to recipes. You can use just about any type of cheese and also roll it in Panko and bake at 350 degrees for 30 min.

We just prepared and tried this incredible recipe.  I cannot begin to tell you how delicious it was.  Served it with Long Grain / white rice and grilled asparagus. My wife and I had two other couples over and served this. As much as I wanted to take credit for it, I printed it out and gave it to our friends.  This is one worth trying and keeping.  Kudos to L.J. We will follow what Jeanette commented on and try this one with different cheeses.  Brie, Gouda, etc.  Must be equally as good.  So simple.

Entertained 9 people at my house and they all loved this chicken. I used feta cheese and it tasted great. I definitely will make this again

I cut the recipe back for only 2 portions and rather than cut a pocket into them, I pounded them to about 1/4" thickness.  I then cut the breasts in half and stuffed and rolled them.  I browned the bacon wrapped chicken breasts prior to baking just to assure a nice crispness. I liked these but I prefer the spinach/cheese combo better.

I love this recipe, I created a nearly similar one. I like to precook my bacon, about half way done because I don't think it gets crispy enough without overcooking the chicken. I mix in some Parmesan cheese and some Gouda or fontina with the blue cheese for extra melty cheesy goodness. Yum!

Easy peasy!  I took the suggestion and cooked the bacon just a bit before wrapping it over the chicken.  I also watched to make sure the meat was done, but not overdone, (about 35 minutes) at 375.  I'll definitely do this one again, and maybe try Swiss or Asiago cheese.  The leftover broth made a wonderful chicken-bacon flavored base for soup the next day.

Very easy recipe and full of flavor!  We loved it!  I followed it exactly but added some fresh chopped basil and I think that even made it  better yet.

Made it per the recipe. It was very much to the dry side and the Gorgonzola just didnâ€™t add enough juiciness and flavor to make it good. Will not make it again per the recipe n

It came out pretty good. I'd not cook it so long the next time, which I'm sure is more due to my old oven and not the recipe. A lot of the cheese liquified and was wasted on the bottom of the dish. It was very good though.

So good! I had to change out the gorgonzola for gouda as my hubby doesn't like blue cheese. Was tasty! We were talking about adding some sliced apples to it next time to try  sweet and salty mix.
