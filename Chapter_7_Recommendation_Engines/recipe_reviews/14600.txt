...This was awesome!!!!...I too added 1/2 cup of mushrooms and 1 can of the beef broth. It takes 45 min or so to reduce the wine sauce, and that is boiling it on high the entire time, so allow for this. Highly recommended.

We really loved this. Once the meat was out of the pan it was difficult to keep it warm without over cooking it. So, I cooked the meat a bit less and after the sauce was complete returned the meat to the pan to finish cooking it. It was a great way to cover the meat with the delicious sauce. It worked out very well.

Excellent!!! I also added a can of beef broth and about a cup of mushrooms. Absolutely wonderful. I accidently started it all before realizing my beef was bad, and used chicken instead, and it was still very good. Recommended!

Yum, yum, yum!  We all LOVED this.  I didn't find it tough at all.  It's important to slice thinly against the grain.  Very easy too.

I really love this recipe.  The sauce is great, simple and savory tasting.  I cooked medium rare and made extra sauce and served over mashed potatoes.  This recipe is really easy, and flavorful.

My Boyfriend loved this so much that he invited his friends over to have me cook.
Although I changed the recipe a little, I did not have any red wine so I used white 
Zinfandel.  It worked really well.  I also use garlic powder.  I cooked it the correct way once and it was good but my boyfriend liked it better with the changes.

This was a great recipe, thanks so much. My husband really enjoyed it and he hates it when I cook with wine, but he keeps asking me when we will be having it again.

Great dish, very easy to make.  I cooked the steak a little longer because my husband does not like rare meat.  It was still pink and very tender.  Was even better the next night for leftovers!

This was good.  The sauce had a different taste than what I expected, but still good.  I did use a better cut of meat (all I had on hand), and I think that helped a bit.  We will try again, but I do think I might tinker with spices to get a more flavorful dish.  Thanks for the post.

Surprise, my picky 11 year old loved it. My other daughter and husband also raved about it. Like others, I added beef broth and mushrooms to the sauce. I also cooked my flank steak some more in the oven, since I hate any red looking meat. I liked this recipe. My only complaint was it was salty to me but that could of been the cooking wine I used plus the broth. Anyway, it will be made again in my home because it went over well and was simple to do.

My family loves flank steak.  I slather on crushed garlic, fresh pepper, and some kosher salt then grill or broil until barely medium rare.  A reviewer mentioned that it is hard to keep the meat warm.  I have found that if I put it on the lowest rack of my oven, have broil on low, and keep the door slightly ajar, the meat rests wonderfully and still stays warm (since I cook it slightly less than medium rare) while I complete any finishing touches to the meal. I slice it at the last minute before serving.  Really, I was going for something a little different by adding this sauce recipe, so I can't rate the steak portion of the recipe.  My whole family loved the sauce!  Thanks!

I thought this recipe was great.  I didn't think the sauce was bland at all.  I thought it was very good and it was very easy to make.

I've made this many, many times for a lot of different people and everyone loves it!!  It's my boyfriend's favorite meal, and it's easy to make.  I tenderize the flank steak first and that makes a big difference in the finished product.  I also serve whatever wine I use to make the sauce with dinner.

No one including myself enjoyed this entree.  The cut of beef was too tough and the sauce was bland.  Maybe with a better cut of meat and adding your favorite spices to the sauce would make it better.

This was awesome! My husband raved about it. I took the advice of others and added mushrooms and beef broth and undercooked the meat and added it to the sauce as it cooked down. I did add more seasonings to meat. Served with mashed potatoes, this is definitely a keeper. Thank you

We used a sirloin steak and OH WOW- the roasted garlic cloves made all the difference.  I would salt the steak a bit less next time but the sear was amazing looking and the whole meal was delicious!!!!!!!

This was excellent! I think I over roasted the garlic the first time so the second time I made this, I pulled the garlic out at 40 min. plus, I let the garlic cool completely before squeezing the cloves out of the skins on my second attempt and it was much easier to work with. I'm making it again tonight for our romantic New Year's eve dinner.

Excellent Recipe. I used a nicer cut of steak and cooked it longer but it was fabulous.  The wine evaporates quite a bit so I would probably add more wine next time. I seasoned the steak with extra italian seasoning and I found it gave it a good zing

I used rump steak which was a bit gristley so that was not the best, but the sauce was just wonderful, unctuous and flavorful.  I'll use some fillet next time.

This has been sitting in my recipe box for 11 years and I can't believe what I've been missing.  It was absolutely delicious.  I did get lazy when cooking so I sauteed the green onions in butter and then added the wine.  when it reduced and thickened I cooked the steak.  I sliced the steak immediately and then added those juices into the sauce. Cooked on high for a few minutes and then added the rest of the butter.

We thought this was pretty darned good.  The sauce had great flavor, and worked well with the steak and even the parmesan mashed potatoes I served as a side.  Made exactly as written but my steak was smaller than the recipe called for, so I had extra sauce to spoon over the potatoes.

The sauce had too many competing flavors - a simpler red wine reduction would have sufficed..

We have made this so many times and still love it. The sauce is divine. We make extra sauce because this amount didn't seem like enough for us when we had a 1 1/2 lb steak. This time we bought a .77 lb steak and kept the sauce measurements at what is called for and it was the perfect amount of both food and sauce for my big meat eater husband and I. Thanks for this keeper Warner.

My first attempt at making steak, good steak, not just cut-up beef in stir-fries or something, and it turned out wonderfully.  The sauce was amazing - added a few cut-up mushrooms because I had them in the fridge.  Used Biltmore Wine Pinot Noir and cooked until boiling and syrupy like the recipe recommended, and it was incredible!  I don't I'll look for another steak recipe again, this will be my standard for sure.

I really liked this recipe.  The steak was a little tough, but I'm pretty sure that was of my doing, not the recipe's.  The sauce was delicious!

This recipe was pretty good but I think marinating the meat prior would have helped. I found the meat a bit "chewy". Overall though, the taste was excellent; I added a cup of beef broth and some mushrooms which I think really enhanced the flavour. I know that some said it takes a long time to reduce the liquid but mine was reduced in no time at all.

Really great! I am not a big red wine fan, or a big sauce fan but the sauce was DELICIOUS! We used a garlic cheese finishing butter instead of regular butter.

This flank steak recipe was really tasty. The kitchen got pretty smoky from searing the meat with no fat in the pan. The sauce didn't take as long to reduce as it seems like it took for some other reviewers.

We like this recipe but I believe there is a problem regarding roasting the garlic.  I followed the instructions, and baked the oiled garlic at 400 degrees for 45 min.  The most of the garlic buds were hard and yeiled very little pulp.  I suggest lowering the temperature or the cooking time.

Absolutely loved it. If you don't like a really pink center, cook a minute or two longer. Otherwise, tender & great flavor overall.

Excellent and easy.  Husband said it was probably the best steak he had ever eaten.  I may even double the sauce next time.  My husband enjoyed it on his mashed potatoes.

I like simple recipes, and this one is pretty basic  - yet so tasty that my entire family gobbled it down. Even my 3-year old! The sauce was delicious and the meat tender. I will definitely make this again. I didn't make any changes, necessarily, except I forgot to buy scallions so made the recipe without them and it turned out fine.

I have made 3 or 4 flank steak recipes and this is the best recipe so far.  My husband even liked it. I just used minced garlic in the sauce and it still made it taste very good.

Warner Beatty you made my husband a very happy man!  I made this for dinner last night and it was a big hit!  My husband told me it was one of the best meals I have ever made.  (I served it with oven roasted potatoes from this site and steamed broccoli)  This will definitely be a repeat in my home.  I had never roasted garlic before so I searched the site for more hints on how to do it properly.  I used  LINDA528's suggestions under the recipe Roasted Garlic and it came out heavenly.  Their is nothing I would change about this recipe.  Thank you again Warren, you are a hero in my home!

I cooked the recipe as is except I added a bit more butter to the sauce at the end (mainly because I got distracted & was afraid I let too much wine cook off). I will try adding a beef boullion cube next time to see how that is but it was certainly pretty good w/out it & red wine & beef broth together is done so often in many of my recipes....the absence of it was kind of a welcome change.  It was a bit rare (even though I cooked the maximum time specified) but I expected that from the description & figured my hubby & son, who like beef more rare, could eat the most rare pieces. It was perfect for them. I served this w/ italian green beans w/ new potatoes & prosciutto & an onion & cucumber salad. It was a very good dinner (plenty tasty & appealing enough to serve to company)& it wasn't too much effort.

I needed a flank steak recipe without soy sauce (2 year old is allergic) and this fit the bill.  The whole family liked this and my five year old declared it "the best."  I used chardonnay because it was what I had on hand and let the meat simmer in the pan as the sauce reduced.  I omitted the butter because my two year old is allergic, but we didn't seem to miss it.  I'm sure we'll make this one again.

My husband thought this was too tart...but that is probably b/c I used cooking sherry instead of red wine(I didn't have any).  I liked it, and expect it to be better with red wine I'm sure.  I will probably try this again, but the right way.

This was great, especially the cooking method!  My flank steak came out tender and perfect.  My husband deemed it "perfectly cooked".  The sauce was very good, although it did not appeal to the kid's pallets.  The adults found it delicious!  Thanks for the recipe.

Great steak recipe!  Very tasty!  I used minced garlic rather than using head garlic and it turned out very well.  I accompanied this dish with scalloped potatoes in a broccoli and cheese sauce along with a stir fry of green peppers and red onions with Asiago-toasted cheese puffs as an appetizer.  Great combination!  Great steak dish!

No, thank you.  The steak was *okay* but the sauce was purple.  Purple!  Which doesn't exactly make for an appetizing presentation.  I won't be making this again.

I made this yesterday evening for my daughter and I.  It turned out great, except next time I think I will use less salt.  The directions are a little confusing in that you begin by saying to brown the steak for a minute on each side on medium heat, and then reduce the heat and continue cooking 3 1/2 minutes more on each side.  Next time I will start out at higher heat and reduce to medium because this did not brown starting on medium.    I also think I will cook it less time after browning, since while it is being kept warm when you cook the sauce, it continues to cook.  Overall we loved it.

I'm still trying to figure out why this is rated so high. Is it just my taste-buds absolutely turned off by the flavors that others find so appealing? I love trying new recipes and flavors. This just was gross. The flavors didn't go together...green onion, roasted garlic...with the wine. Everything was done according to the recipe; even the extra time waiting for the sauce to thicken (flour isn't necessary...it thickens, you just have to be patient!). I saved the rest of the steak, great flavor there with salt, pepper and butter... the sauce was just awful and has been disposed of. Save your wine for drinking!

TERRIFIC!!! and so easy too!  Based on other reviews I added about 1/2 cup of mushrooms.  I also fixed another bulb of garlic for a nice appetizer spread on melba toast. . . we'll have this again - and I can't wait to try the sauce with other cuts of beef.  Thank you Warner Beatty!

This is a great easy recipe...I used fresh herbs from my garden during the seasoning process.  It was quick and turned out tender and full of flavor. My husband loved it!  There wasn't a scrap left for the dogs.

My whole family loved this recipe, even my picky brother!  The one warning I will issue is use a non-stick pan.  I tried to repeat the recipe with a pan that was not Teflon-coated, and the sauce turned black and sort of burned. But the batch from the non-stick batch was just perfect!  I would definitely make this again.

Yum! This is a fabulous recipe, especially if you don't have the time to marinate a flank steak overnight...the flavor of the sauce was delicious! We will make this one again.

This was a total hit!  Down to the number of minutes to cook each side, this recipe was flawless.  My family, including my mother-in-law, said this was the best meal I've ever made.  I paired the flank steak with oven roasted potatoes and steakhouse-style wedge salad with homemade blue cheese dressing (recipe found on this site!), boiled egg and red peppers.  I was really proud of this meal!

We've had this flank steak in the freezer not knowing what to do with it.  I'm so glad we decided on this recipe - it was so great.  I also used mushrooms and beef broth.  I served it with mashed potatoes with carmelized onions.  Yum!  Thank you for this great recipe!

The sauce was marvelous.  My husband is not a wine fan, but loved this.  I found that you need to cook the steak a little more than specified though - otherwise it's pretty rare.

I've never really made steak before. I just picked up some flank in the supermarket, searched for a recipe for this cut and found this one. I didn't have wine so i substituted equal amounts of grape juice and beef broth. I loved the sause sauce and the steak was pretty tender. Definitely would make it again.

This is an eloquent dish. As some reviewers suggested, I used 8 oz. sautéed mushrooms and a can of beef broth. Be sure to slice the steak thinly, about 3/8". Delicious. I served the flank steak with a kale salad, mashed potatoes, and roasted asparagus.

This is so tender and juicy. The smell of roasted garlic while you are preparing this is amazing. I can't wait to make this again. I made it with roasted potatoes and steamed broccoli and cauliflower. Everyone loved it...

I have been using allrecipes for several years now and have decided it is time to step up to "the" plate and start reviewing. Excellent flavors! Roasting the garlic is key and using a good red wine...which does not mean it has to be pricey. My husband and I LOVED this recipe. Had mashed red potatoes as one of the sides and the sauce made them sing! Highly recommend you give this recipe a try. Nice job Warner Beatty!!!

This was pretty good with some great flavor.  I did like some other suggestions, added a cup of beef broth and sliced up some mushrooms.  Cause I was worried that the flank steak would get cold, I seared it real quick, then as my sauce (with the mushrooms and garlic in it) started to reduce, I added the meat to cook in the sauce.  I overcooked it a little bit (always worried about undercooked meat), but it still turned out really good and delicious, and surprisingly tender.  Definitely will be  making this one again!

This was SO GOOD and so easy! I used about 3/4 cup of Pinot Noir and 1/2 cup beef broth. The steak wasn't fully cooked through when I started making the sauce so I put it back in the pan with the sauce and let it simmer for about 10 minutes. This gets better with time! Great flavor, will definitely make again.

It is a very tasty recipe...I added some sliced mushrooms to the sauce because I love mushrooms.  I also added a tad beef broth.  The sauce does have a purplish color to it, but what else would you expect if using merlot.  I felt that it was a lot of work for the end product.  Roasting the Garlic made the house smell really good, but took a long time.  Overall very tasty, but seems like more work than what it is worth.

this was delicious.....I didn't have any green onions, so I used a vidalia onion!  It was fantastic.  The only thing I did differently besides the onion was to add some browning sauce to help with the color of the sauce.  Will definitely make this again, only using more garlic!

I liked the steak, but my wine sauce didn't turn out so great.  I think I just chose the wrong wine for it.  I will use this recipe again in the future, but work on bettering my sauce.

I completely jacked up this recipe and it still turned out really well!  I had a hard time with the garlic puree and ended up having to add minced garlic.  Also, I took other's reccommendations and added beef broth and mushrooms.   Very tastey!

I did not care for this at all. Maybe I used the wrong kind of red wine, I used a merlot. It was too Wine-y.

I tried this with a sirloin steak and didn't have any green onions, but apart from that followed the recipe to a tee and found the sauce to be way too bitter. I sprinkled brown sugar over it and that balanced it out, but I don't think I'll make this again.

This was SOOOOO good. I was so impressed I couldnt believe that I had made it myself. I had never made steak before, but decided to make it for my boyfriends 19th birthday. I used two sirloin steaks (traders joes, 8$ for two!). I included beef broth and sliced button mushrooms into the wine sauce, and didn't really measure any of it, just eye balled it and would add more wine or more brooth as I tasted. Just do it to your own liking. I also made grilled onions (onions, butter and a little bit of brown sugar) and oven roasted potatoes (Ann Bergs Roasted new potatoes, using multi colored potatoes: red, yellow and purple.) I also used merlot as suggested. It was so so wonderful and I cant wait to make it again! I highly highly suggest this because it is better then I have EVER had in a resturant, and WAYYY less expensive and so satisfying. I hope it works out well for everyone!   If I can make it in my first apartment, away from home and with limited supplies, then it cant be that hard.

I must not have had a big enough head of garlic because you really couldn't taste it.  All we could taste was the wine.  I'll try it again with more garlic.

The flavor on this sauce turned out really nice, though I had to thicken it before serving. (I also added mushrooms and a little beef broth) It  was a not-too-appetizing bland grey color, but the taste made up for it.  Overall this was a great recipe find when I had a few leftover flank steaks to use, but I probably won't rush to make it again just because it was a lot of time and effort for the final result.

This was not bad for a menu change-up, though it will not become a part of our regular rotation. After searing the steak, I transfered it to a plate. I then put in the 4 tablespoons of butter, the red wine, a can of beef broth, the garlic, and the green onions. I let this simmer for about 30 minutes to reduce about half the liquid, then I added the steak to the pan and cooked it 3 minutes on each side. I then let the steak rest for about 5 minutes while I thickened up the liquid with about a tablespoon of cornstarch (I don't think the liquid would have ever reached the consistenty I wanted by itself.) While the liquid was still simmering, I then sliced the steak against the grain into thin strips and transferred it back to the pan. This was a good way to heat up the steak, without continuing the cooking process, and get it coated in the sauce. Tasty!

This is one of my favorite Allrecipes.com recipies (it was the first one I made). Although it's time consuming, between roasting the garlic and reducing the wine sauce, I always get rave reviews when I make it. I add up to 1/2 cup beef broth to the wine sauce to make it a little meatier. While I usually roast the garlic as the directions suggest, I've also just peeled the cloves first and tossed them into the oven in a few tablespoons of olive oil. They're just as mashable, and then you have some deliciously-flavored oil to use in another recipe (but use within two days--home-flavored oil can grow bacteria and fungus)

I'm not much of a cook, but I made this for a dinner party, and it came out great.  I think I may have used a little too much wine though.  I think it took over half an hour to reduce the wine sauce to an amount that I preferred.  This was my favorite dish at the dinner party, but I am a big meat eater.

Normally we cook steak on the grill but it's been raining in California FOREVER and we didn't want to wait anymore!  This turned out pretty well although it is quite labor intensive.  The roasted garlic is a nice touch.  I added a cup of beef broth based on suggestions by other reviewers.  I substituted shallots for the green onions and added some porcini mushrooms to the sauce as well.

This recipe was alright. The meat itself was very tasty without the sauce and with just the salt and pepper seasoning. I followed some of the suggestions that recommended adding broth -- didn't like this too much. It tasted too much like gravy and washed out the wine flavor. Athough I wasn't too fond of the recipe, my boyfriend really enjoyed the meat. I might try to make it again with modifications.

Very good! Had read previous entries and added sliced mushrooms after the beef had been pan seared. It made the meat really tender! Then after removing the meat and pouring in the wine, I also added a cube of beef boulion. Yummy! Will definitely make this again.

This is a good recipe.  I made several mistakes and it was still good.  I left it on the eye after the wine sauce was reduced by half and forgot to add the last 2 TBSP of butter.  The rarest part was the most tender.  I added one beef boullion cube and one jar of whole mushrooms.

This recipe was pretty good.  The sauce really lacked substance.  It needed something else, despite the fact that I used a very good red wine.  Perhaps beef boulion would help.  All in all I will probably try this recipe again.

Very tasty and tender flank steak.  I 
used a cheaper wine so my sauce was bitter
and I had to add some sugar to cut the
bitter taste.  The dinner was great!  The
next morning I took the leftovers and made
steak and eggs, yummy, yummy!

This was quick and easy.  My boyfriend loved the garlic/wine sauce!
