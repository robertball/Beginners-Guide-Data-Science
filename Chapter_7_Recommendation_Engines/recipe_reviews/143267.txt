We love PB cup S'mores!
Make them in your microwave to get this special treat between camping trips or during the winter.
Lay one half of grahm cracker (2 sections) on microwave plate and add peanut butter cup to top.  Microwave for about 10 seconds.
Add large marshmallow to top of softened PB cup and microwave 5 to 10 seconds--you just have to watch it and judge according to your microwave. (Kids love this part as the marshmallow will swell up and go "crazy".)
Top with second half of cracker, smush it together and gobble up.

What a nice change from the usual s'more.  I used the full size 'Reese's' Peanut Butter Cup since I figured being thinner it would melt better.  I did try one with the fatter little ones and did not like that at all.  It will never replace the original for me but "variety IS the spice of life!"

We love this recipe...I saw it in Family Fun last year, we try different things for each family member.  My favorite is Dark Chocolate.  We use the Cookies and Cream White Hersheys, Reese's PB Cups, and we have even used Mounds for our coconut lovers!!!

Our family has been making these on camping trips for years!  They are so dang good.  We've also used the Reese's with caramel and the Hershey bar with caramel.  They are all really good, but since I am a PB freak - these are my favorite!

When I saw this recipe I really wanted to try it, but I didnt have any peanut butter cups. So I just spread some natural peanut butter on the graham cracker, topped it with the chocolate, then the toasty marshmallow and...yum! It was really good! I cant wait to try it with the peanut butter cup!

If your a s'mores lover OR a lover of chocolate and peanut butter together then this is a recipe for you! I usually make mine in the microwave or oven, as I don't go camping. I have been making these for many years, and they are a favorite treat! :)

This is much better than using a plain chocolate bar. I will recommend using full size Reese's cup to everyone from now on, they were delicious and made this taste extra special.

As a kid I always made smores while camping. The ingredients of the standard smore were all the things I really liked but the chocolate would never really melt enough for me. When I saw this recipe it sounded like a nice change. The peanut butter cup melted enough and it was soft and tasty. This is my new smore recipe from now on.

It tastes great and it's a nice change up from the normal s'mores. I have to say though that the taste reminds me of the Reese's whipped candy bar, minus the graham cracker.

While roasting your marshmallows, set the peanut butter cup on a graham cracker and place it on a rock near the fire so it softens up.  Mhhhmmmm good!!

My kids have been making S'more's with peanut butter cups for years. We keep the peanut butter cups frozen until time to use - then using a marshmallow fork that has been crimped together, we place the peanut butter cup on top of one half of the grahm cracker and melt it over the fire, then top with the roasted marshmallow and other grahm cracker.  Makes my mouth water just typing it out!

Smores are one of my favorite summer treats. I look forward to bonfires all winter long! I'm a huge fan of chocolate and peanut butter, so I had high hopes for this recipe. Unfortunately it just wasn't right for me. Something along the lines of too much of a good thing. I didn't like the combination of the peanut butter and marshmallow. I'll stick with the original.

We would use "store bought" cookies in place of the graham crackers, the preference was chocolate chip or peanut butter cookies. Another fun thing is to roll the marshmellow in 'M&M's or Reeses peices' after its cooked and then put between the cookies

This is one of our favorite ways to make s'mores.  My kids love PB cups and they are awesome when the warm marshmallow melts them.

It's April and Mother Nature is playing a cruel joke on us. Since it's snowing out I toasted the marshmallows on my gas stove and gave the peanut butter cup a quick zap in the microwave to soften just a bit  before assembling. I have not used one marshmallow. We might be sheltered but this is the first time I've tried a peanut butter cup on a s'more. We loved them. My new favorite s'more! Can't wait for the weather to warm up so we can try this over a real campfire!
