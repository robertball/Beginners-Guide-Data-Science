We had these tonight and really liked them. They are good! I used russet potatoes because that's all I had on hand.  I agree with the submitter that the sugar is necessary in this recipe and the taste of sugar is not detectable. I used freshly ground pepper and kosher salt to season along with a healthy dose of garlic powder. They crisp up very well (due to the addition of sugar). They are best served straight out of the oven when they are most hot and crisp. Thank you mmyers168 for a tasty recipe.

These are great!  They're really easy, quick to make and are delicious.  Mine didn't take the full 20 minutes on the second side. Be sure not to forget the non-stick spray - I used foil on my pan for easy cleanup and they stuck a bit because I didn't spray it. They were done in about 30 minutes of baking for me.  I only had russets so I used them and they turned out great.  Looking forward to making them with "teeny tiny potatoes" cut in half.  And also looking forward to tinkering with seasonings - I can see these tasting really good with some parmesan thrown in, or a cheese garlic dry salad dressing seasoning packet.  Definitely a keeper I'll make again and again.

Great French fry recipe.  I made a half-batch for my DH and me and served them with 'Mom's Big Burgers', another AR recipe.  The fries were the star of the meal.  I liked the crispness of the fries, and I believe it comes from the sugar, so don't omit that ingredient.  I never use the fryer in the house, so it will be nice to have homemade baked crispy fries during the cold Indiana winters. Thanks mmyers168 for sharing your "baked" version of French fries.

The sugar releases the starch (liquid) in the potatoes and then you drain it off and dry them well. When you place them on the baking sheet be sure you place them in a single layer with space around each fry to aid in getting them crispy. The liquid will cause the potatoes to steam which makes them soggy when baked, so if you remove it first then you get a crispier fry. Also, using a lower in starch potato such as red potatoes or Yukon Golds are a better choice than Idaho for crispier fries. Keep in mind the bake time will vary depending on how thick or thin you cut the potatoes.

First, let me state that I hate oven fries. Most are a pale imitation of french fries and just not worth the effort. These are not like the others. They're super easy and quite tasty. I'm a french fry purist so only used salt to season, along with the oil and sugar.  The flavor is spot-on french fry, no sugar flavor at all. I cut mine into batons and some came out tough on the outside. All of them were creamy on the inside, like a good fry should be. I'll keep playing with the cooking time to get the outside perfect. If I can do that consistently, I'll rate this 5 stars. I served them alongside Crispy Fish Filets (AR recipe). The fish cook so fast that there isn't time to mind another dish at the same time. I really appreciated being able to stick these fries in the oven and set the time. Fish, fries and no stress, it doesn't get much better!

These really are the best oven baked fries.  I use this recipe all the time and everyone loves it.  Recently I have started making a double batch. Halfway through baking, I remove half the fries from the pan, let them cool then freeze in a single layer on a baking sheet sprayed with cooking spray.  When frozen, I place them in a freezer bag and when ready to use, I remove as many as I want and bake them at 400F on a foil lined pan sprayed with cooking spray for 10 minutes on each side or until golden.  Excellent!

I used Russets and tossed them in the sugar in a mixing bowl, then into a colander for a rest as directed.  Dried them with some paper towels then back into the bowl to toss with the salt, pepper, and garlic powder.  

I baked them on a wire rack over a cookie sheet so did not need to turn them.  

I make oven fries a lot and I think I prefer the simpler seasonings in this recipe.  I also think the sugar definitely makes them more crispy.

I LOVE THESE!  You must realize that no baked fry will ever be a fried fry, so don't expect that.  These are exceptional compared to other baked fries I've tried from this site and this is now my go to recipe for fries.  The little bit of sugar is a must so don't skip it!  I follow this recipe exact every time, (and even skip the letting it marinade step when in a time crunch), and they are always all gone at dinner time.  Start early though, because this is not FAST FOOD... Between seasoning, chopping, and baking, they do take quite awhile to make.

This is definitely a 5-star recipe!  I made 1/3 a batch---two larger Yukon potatoes is all.  I used about 1 1/2 tablespoons of oil, a teaspoon each of sugar and garlic powder, 1/2 teaspoon each of kosher salt and pepper.  These were really yummy and disappeared quickly between me and my hubs.  We thought these were a keeper!  Thanks for the recipe!

Another tip I can offer from years of commercial food preparation is a neat trick.  If you guys want to make a lot of these you can soak the cut potatoes submerged in cold water overnight in the fridge. We use to make 5 gallon buckets full and the following day the starch would be in the water, then just drain well and cook.  The technique would work for this recipe as well I'm sure, just use a salad bowl and the fries will be fine for a couple days even. The little extra work really pays off if you like 'real' fries. Getting the starch off allows the fries to be crisper whether they're baked or fried. One last bit I might also add is I know the type of potato you use can make a tremendous difference in how they turn out.

Good recipe!  I just want to note that it would be helpful if recipes that used potatoes (zuchinni, whole tomatoes, squash, etc.) would also give an approximate weight value to the vegetable(s).  Potatoes come in a variety of sizes.

These were excellent! Be careful not to leave them in too long - they get a little tough on the outside.  They crisped up very well and the sugar was not noticeable at all.  I added a few more spices in the bag and let them sit for about 1/2 hour before cooking.  Great recipe!

Just finished eating these yummy potatoes!!!  I added one more ingredient, a teaspoon of Mrs. Dash onion seasoning.  My son was waiting patiently for these to bake as the smell was incredible!  Will definitely make again!!

So easy and so yummy! I just used Russets because that's what I had and the fries were still very tasty. This is a great way to make homemade fries. All the ingredients are staples that are always at hand which makes this recipe perfect for using up extra potatoes. Easy, fast, versatile, and I love that they're not deep-fried and greasy. Thank you so much! We'll be having this one again.

Made these a steak cut fries.  I used garlic flavored olive oil (I like the added garlic flavor).  The fries turned out crispy on the outside and soft in the middle.  Delish.  I also used red skinned potatoes, as that is what I had on hand.

Wow! So good--crispy outside, and tender inside. I'm deleting the rest of my baked "french fries" for this one. Next time I'll try it with sweet potatoes.

My first attempt was using sweet potatoes. Wow, wow, wow. Delicious. Dream come true. Can't get any better than this. No need to go on except for another WOW. Follow the recipe and you will not be disappointed.

Cripsy and delicious! I cut back some on the olive oil, and didn't notice any difference.  Also added one teaspoon onion powder.  You really can't taste the sugar.  I've tried many other recipes that are baked instead of fried, and this one really delivers.  I was very impressed with my oven fries!  Definitely going in the permanent file.

Perfect!  This is now our standard "fry" recipe.  We often make these with salt as the only seasoning because our son prefers that.  But these are very good when made following the recipe exactly.  The fries are crunchy outside, soft inside, and delicious all through!  I use a towel to dry the potatoes after draining.  We also use whatever variety of potato we have on hand, including red and blue!  Depending on the oven and age/variety of potatoes, cooking time can vary.  We usually end up cooking longer to get the type of crunch we prefer.

I don't usually rate recipes, but. . .  MY FAMILY LOVED THESE POTATOES!!! They ARE crisp on the outside and tender on the inside. I have now made them 4 times following the recipe except that I used russets instead of yukons. Perfect every time.  Thank You!

The key here is the way you cut them. Cutting the potatoes in half and then cutting each half into 3 or 4 wedges makes them thin enough to become soft on the inside, while crisp on the outside. I left out the garlic powder and just used salt and pepper. Instead of a plastic bag, I mixed them in a large bowl.

My husband LOVED these! So did I.  I cut my fries the size of fast food fries, but a bit thicker would have been better.  Also, I only made 2 potatoes, so I used a heaping 1/4 tsp. ea ingredient & much less oil. What I used was still too much oil. Nonetheless, the BEST fries I've ever had :-)  Also, 40 minutes was too much time...15 flip, 10 & done.

I made these last night. My husband said these were best oven fries he had ever eaten. The sugar is a must to draw out the water and drying them off first helps make them crisp. And you can use any seasonings you prefer.Love them!

These are the best baked fries I have ever had. I made them as per the recipe the first time and they were really good. The next time (and every time since) I switched out the salt and pepper for 2 teaspoons of seasoning salt and they went from really good to awesome!

Very good! I also make no fat fries by beating an egg white, add seasoning to the white and stir in the potatoes until covered well. The rest is the same as here (I usually have russets, and haven't tried sugar trick, yet). Just make sure fries are in a single layer in something larger than 9x13 (a 13x18 jellyroll pan works well) sprayed with non-stick spray. I turn about every 15 mins to keep them evenly browned, and they're as crisp as any fry that was every 'fried.' This was an idea from Oprah's personal chef's cookbook In the Kitchen with Rosie, many years ago.

These French fries were absolutely awesome, easy to make and so worthy.  My husband couldn't get enough and asked me to make them more often, usually he's not a guy that goes gaga for fries, so people give it a try and enjoy this healthier but tastier version.  Thank you for sharing this recipe mmyers168.

Delicious!  I really enjoyed the fries made using this recipe.  They came out crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.  I only had russet potatoes to use, yet they worked fine in this recipe.  Also, I learned the purpose of using sugar!  This was a great help.

OMG!!  These were undisputedly the best fries I have ever had!  They were like fried without the guilt.  They had the slightest hint of garlic and olive oil; enough flavoring that no other garnish was needed.  I had them with a beautiful steak that I wanted to just push aside and eat only the fries but people were looking at me and expected me to share.  I'm very happy,

Gotta say, these are amazing! I'm looking forward to trying this recipe with sweet potatoes to see how it works. My two year-old DD and my DH LOVE fries, so I wanted to be able to give them something that was healthier than fast food or frozen fries. I prefer to make as much of our food at home as I possibly can. No more frozen fries for us! With a french fry cutter, this recipe is super simple and relatively quick, too. I added onion powder this time and next time I might half the pepper for my DD. I also forgot to spray the aluminum foil on my pan...DON'T forget that step, lol. The oil helped the fries come off, but I had to peel them off individually. I might try these with ranch mix next time and will try both sweet and savory spice mixes for the sweet potato fries. Great, versatile recipe!

We liked these.  I sprayed canola cooking oil on the potatoes then seasoned them.  I did add chili pepper and onion powder to teh fries.  The outsides crisped up nicely and the insides were soft and yummy.  Will definitely make these again.

These puppies rocked. I was rushing and used plain russets, sliced for wedges, baked in convection oven for 20" and they were perfect!  A new favorite!

Just used regular baking potatoes, and have made this several times experimenting with different thicknesses.  ALL turned out amazing!  If you cut the fries thin, do cut back on the time, though or they will burn!  The sugar must be the trick here, because I've never had oven fries turn out this good!

I've made a similar recipe, but the potatoes always came out too soggy. This recipe produced crisp on the outside, soft on the inside baked fries that everyone loved! It has to be the sugar on the potatoes, so don't skip that step. My daughter says we should never do the frozen potatoes again. I used russet potatoes, you could probably use whatever you have on hand and it would turn out lovely. This is a definite keeper for me.

I used Russet Potatoes, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly, and it worked great. My family is addicted to french fries and these were (almost) better than the fried version. Totally making these again!

Made these last night for the first time - everyone in my family *loved* them. My 6 year old said "these are the best fries I've ever had in my whole life" :-) I left some as wedges and cut some thinner so they'd be a bit crispier for my husband and both cooked beautifully on the same pan. Well worth the prep time, nice to know there's an option for yummy fries that aren't actually fried! I will definitely be making these again!

So tasty!  These fries taste even better than classic deep fried french fries.  And they're so easy.  I used 1/2 tsp of pepper, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.

I tried this recipe this evening. Added minced garlic rather than garlic powder and dried rosemary to the marinade. They are really good- the perfect blend and flavour. I won't be using any other recipe again. The crispiness of these baked fries make it a winner. I don't miss the deep fried ones when I eat these.

Seriously this recipe lives up to it's name...Best EVER Baked French Fries.  I followed the recipe exactly, except that I soaked my cut potatoes in warm water with the sugar, then drained them and patted them dry.  They turned out so crispy and flavorful...better than fried in my opinion!

Wow! Fabulous! I only had small red potatoes on hand, so I cut down on the time.  Used half olive and half veg. oil.  Seasonings the same as stated. We love chili cheese fries, so I dumped on the toppings. My Honey just loved them, as did I. Thanks so much for this great recipe.

The sugar step makes an unbelievable difference to the texture of these fries! I've made baked fries for years, but they were always a bit disappointing. The only difference between my old method and this recipe is the sugar step. It is key and the reason why it's a 5-star recipe. Try seasoned salt, too.

I have made oven fries many times, but never used the sugar trick. I have to say, it makes a big difference in crispness! So, thanks so much for that little tip that makes a huge difference in the taste and texture of these awesome oven fries!!

I haven't tried this recipe yet, but I have made roasted potatoes in the same way, but without the sugar. I will try it with sugar but my potatoes always come out crispy without it.  I also add thyme, oregano and any other yummy herb on hand... they are delicious.  Always remember to use garlic powder with the herbs...So, with a salad, and crusty bread, they are a meal in themselves... thanks for sharing your recipe!

These were wonderful! I followed the recipe precisely except that I rinsed the sugar off the potatoes after they released their liquids (then patted dry), and added some onion powder, cayenne, and paprika to the seasoning for a little extra kick. They came out so perfectly that I can't imagine ever frying "fries" again. Thank you for an excellent recipe!

The taste of this recipe is great but I found them greasy and the sugar did not help them crisp up. It did remove liquid but that did not help them.

Just made these tonight for myself and my husband and WOW were we impressed.  I'd pretty much given up on oven fries but this recipe has changed my mind.  I used russet potatoes but other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and they were perfect.  I'll make these again and again.

This is the best french fry recipe I've ever made. And we've used our Fry Baby many times. With this recipe, the seasoning is perfect, and they turn out crispy on the outside. My family loves them.

This was a very nice, simple french fry recipe! My potatoes hadn't been soaked for 20-30 minutes in the sugar, nor had they been dried at all, and they were still wonderful! I definitely had to play with the baking time, though, and make sure you spray the foil! I forgot and they stuck, but not horribly. I will probably make these again! Thanks!

This is the very first review I have written for Allrecipes, that is how much we loved the french fries. I took time out of my busy day to say these are the perfect fries. Crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside, yummy! Thanks for the recipe.

Gotta be honest, I'm just not a big fan of baked fries but not having mastered the art of deep frying, this is my default home fry. These are pretty freakin good, I must say!! I do spice them up a bit but other than that, these are perfect!

I tried this recipe tonight for our supper on the spur-of-the-moment.  I had 2 giant russet potatoes and that was too many for the pan I used.  So my fries weren't very crispy but they tasted good and are all gone.  I will try this recipe again using a larger pan or smaller potatoes!  I like the idea of baked fries and I'm not giving up yet.

Yummy! So good--and the kids loved them! COOK FOR 15 minutes, flip and COOK FOR 15 minutes. The recipe cooked them too long for us and I ended up eating all the black fries :)

These are amazing!  I made them with BBQ sandwiches for dinner and my family loved them, even my super picky toddler lol I wanted to try a new recipe because my homemade fries never seem to turn out right, they were good but not great, i was doing everything except putting them in sugar, sugar made a 100% difference.

Followed directions including spraying aluminum foil. Had to literally peel the potatoes off one by one to flip them. would take a picture, but they look half eaten. Guess I'll keep searchung for decent oven fries, these aren't them.

I don’t know where I went wrong. I cooked these exactly as the recipe stated. Didn’t change one single thing except not cook as long but most of my fries burnt and still tasted a little sweet. I’ll try one more time since so many people were raving about this but I’m unsure if it’s worth the trouble.

I followed the recipe to a T and the fries burned badly in the first twenty minutes. I will make them again, but lower my oven to 325 degrees. Perhaps my oven runs hot, but I don't think so.

I'll get right down to business--this recipe is delicious and well worth your time. That being said, let me explain the necessity of the sugar!

The sugar works to pull the excess moisture out of the potatoes so you can end up with crispy ones instead of fluffy soft fries. If you skip this part, you're going to end up with something more akin to home fries than French fries. If that's your thing, go for it--otherwise, don't skip the sugar!

The concept/goals of this recipe are good but I was not that impressed.. I will continue searching for the best baked fries.
 I accidently I left the potatoes in zip bag about 45 mins, (even more moisture was released) which was good I think.While the fries were yummy soft inside the outside was tough/chewy instead of crisp.!

I will be making this recipe many times in the future! I made two different batches one with cheddar cheese and one plain. The flavor is on point! I was going to skip the sugar part because I never heard of it but I ended up doing it because I really didn't want to change the recipe. I'm glad I did it!

This came out great too. I just personally have never found a way to make "crispy" french fries from the oven. But these were seasoned just right.

I think the temperature was too high.  The potatoes tasted burnt.  I think it might be better to precook in microwave before baking.

Very tasty. I only had russet potatoes on hand to use but they turned out just fine. I let them sit and extra 5 min in the sugar then rolled/ blotted them in paper-towel before mixing everything in a ziplock bag. I don't like an overly potato-y texture to fries so I cut them wide, but thin. Also dropped the oven temp to 375 and stuck with the 20 min per side. Time consuming but worth it once in a while.  Served with slowcooker pulled pork sandwiches and it had hubby purring like a kitten.

Our family really enjoyed them.  I did them exactly like the recipe says to, but they just weren't the same as the prefrozen fries that we baked.  They tasted more natural, though, and I'm going for that.  Maybe I need to play with it some myself, but these still weren't the crisp fries I was hoping for.  I'm still going to continue doing it until I find my exact right baked fry.  I have no idea if it makes a difference or not, but I'm considering flash freezing them beforehand.  Maybe that will give me the crispy baked fry I'm looking for.  I'll update later if I see that my idea is what makes this beyond good to extraordinary.

Made these last night and they were FANTASTIC, healthy & yummy!  The only addition was paprika, to give it a nice color.

Thank you so much for sharing your recipe with us all.

This is the first baked French fry recipe I've tried, and there have been many, in which the French fries turn out as crispy, tasty and yummy as their deep fried cousins.  Will be making this recipe again and again.

This recipe was fantastic!   I cut the recipe in half since it was just my husband and I, but, prepared the rest of the recipe as is.   Mine cooked perfectly browned and crisp in the full 40 minutes.  I wanted to take a picture, but, they disappeared too quickly!   I will definitely be making again.  Thanks for the recipe!

Perfect fries. I didn't toss in a bag, just a bowl, but every fry got coated. They came out crispy and delicious. Dipped in a Sriracha garlic sauce found on this site. (Avocado Fries with Sriracha Garlic Dipping Sauce.)

My husband raved about these "Best Baked French Fries" (5 stars). They were crispy the way he likes, bordering on crunchy. I made two deviations from the recipe: (i) I skipped the foil and baking spray (oiled fries do not stick to my stainless steel pan); and (ii) I added the salt after baking since I had learned from westcoastmom that this was one of the secrets to crispy fries. This particular recipe is similar to the Weight Watcher's recipe for french fries which also makes use of sugar to make the fries crispy. The next time I make these for these for my husband I will play with the seasoning a bit. I prefer the Weight Watcher's recipe for myself, the major difference being that the fries are softer and evenly browned (flipped in the oven) because they are cut on the round (not in sticks). Thank you Life Tastes Good for sharing your recipe.

These fries are the best! After trying them, I'll never buy frozen fries again. There is no comparison in quality. They're also very easy to make. I use a food processor with a french fry blade to cut the potatoes, which saves a lot of time. As others have stated, I also find that mine take closer to 10 minutes once they've already been flipped. These are definitely worth the extra couple of steps.

Finally! A cooking method that makes perfect non- floppy fries!! Very important not to skip the sugar step; set your potatoes that are in the colander inside a large bowl; you will be amazed at the liquid that comes out of the potatoes! Also very important, is that each fry lays flat as recipe states. I have done it in a hurry before and just kinda piled them all on the sheet, (cause let's be honest, if you're feeding a big family, a pan of fries laid out flat will not feed many people) and they were still good, just not as crispy. But, when you take the time to lay each one out, and flip each one half way through, they are crispy and yummier. :) Also, feel free to play with the seasonings! Italian is yummy too, or Goya. :)

This is one of the better of the no fry french fries. Easy to follow and they turn out pretty darn good to boot. Leave yourself enough time before your meal to ensure your potatoes are dry enough. Beyond that, its silly how easy this recipe is. Thanks for posting it!

This is a great recipe!  So much tastier than store-bought fries.  My family is wondering, is there a way to make these in advance then freeze them?  We rarely have time to make these right before we eat.  What would be the best option to pre-prepare these?

Needed a quick French Fry recipe. Found this one and didn't even have enough time to read the reviews, which I always do. The only change I made was I used Red Potatoes because that's what I had on hand. This was a winner with both the adults and the kids. There were none left and I made a double batch. Definitely a keeper as written. Now I'll take the time and read the reviews and see what others recommend.

The recipe was great as written. I like to add onion powder, and a little garlic salt in place of some of the regular salt. Baked french fries are not fried fries, so yes they taste different. I like both!

These fries are very good.  A bit labor intensive when you are cooking the rest of the meal.  They came out crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.  Don't omit the sugar step.  I served them with grilled steak and glazed carrots.  They took a little longer that the recipe said.  But my slices may have been a bit thicker.  Used Yukon Gold potatoes.  thanks for sharing.

This sounded great but I didn't have any large potatoes so I used small redskins cut into equal sized slices. I did everything else the same except took the hint someone else posted to roast them on a rack so they didn't have to be turned.  They were wonderful, much better than any I've made in the past that didn't call for the sugar.  This recipe is a keeper!  Thanks for sharing it!

I made these for dinner tonight! YUM!  They are chewy/crispy on the outside, and soft and fluffy inside.  And no, you cannot taste any sugar once you rinse them off.  I left the peels on for more nutrition and texture, and I added 1/2 tsp. ground cayenne to the spice mix.  Will definitely make these fries again and again!

They were very good. I only gave 4 stars because mine weren't crispy. Maybe I didn't dry them enough or it could be that there was too much oil. I will try them again for sure.

Easy recipe for soft fries without any mess.  Might do less olive oil and a bit of cayenne pepper next time around.  I tried it a second time with truffle oil and truffle salt - awesome!

This is a fantastic recipe!  We used Russet potatoes instead, but they turned out great.  The cooking times and temperatures were spot on for me.  Thank you for giving me a way to make these myself!

Extraordinary baked fries!! I cut them with corrugated knife, so they are crinkle cut and also cook faster, crispier and we all love them. Never any leftovers. I can prepare a bag after sugaring them, toss it in the fridge with the spices. I add a bit of cajin hots. Then make the burgers, and when I pull the bag of fries out to put them on the cookie sheet, I hear raves.

I made and LOVED these.  I could hear them "frying" in the oven as they baked.  I've pasted this recipe on to several people and we all agree these are the best baked french fries we've ever tasted!

Had to add about an extra half teaspoon of salt to make more flavorful. LOVED this baked fries.

Made these omitting the nasty chemicals in cooking spray and used parchment paper. The fries come out golden brown. We like our fries spicy so I used a pinch of cayenne pepper and paprika. Yummy! Thanks for sharing this great recipe.

mmeyers definitely wasn't joking when she said to spray with Pam! Even with a good deal of oil on the pan, the fries still stuck, (though I was able to get them off with a bit of effort). Yum! Perfect texture and very tasty. :)

Very easy.  Do not skip using the white sugar,  crispy on the outside and soft in the middle.  Will  be saving this recipe to make again.

Thank you SO much for this recipe!  We love French Fries, but rarely have them because they are, well, used to be, unhealthy :-)  They came out perfect, crisp and soft on the inside. I would say they taste just like real French Fries, maybe even better!  My husband and (very picky) kids loved them.  Tip:  Like the common consensus seems to be, DO NOT omit the sugar step.  A lot of moisture came out, and I think that is the key to this recipe.  THANKS!!!

I make baked fries all the time minus the sugar. Sugar is not needed to crisp them, a rinse of cold water then blotting them dry before tossing them in the bag is all that is needed. A bit of parmesan & paprika, regular or hot, added to the granulated garlic, salt & pepper is a nice change from the norm as well.

This is how I have made fries for a number of years, however I have never used sugar. If you like them your fries really crispy, use the sugar but if you like them softer (like I do), leaving out the sugar is fine.

I was a little dissapointed with this one.  I followed the recipe to the letter and I felt like they didn't get crispy enough. Fries started to break apart.

They weren't bad. I would of never thought to put sugar on the potatoes to drain the moisture and not have a sweet taste on them. All in all they were good but not great. If I make these again I'll probably play around with the ingredients but definitely use the sugar method again.

Yummy fries! And it was very easy to make! I used Russet potatoes. Mine didn't take the full 40 minutes in the oven. I think it's because I cut my potatoes a bit thin. I plan to cut them a bit thicker next time.

Agree with others; had to mess around with the bake times to get it right. Next time will probably tent with aluminum foil about 3/4s of the way in to ensure inside cooks nough without burning outside.  Everyone loved them though.

Awsome! Didn't change recipe at all really, just added some italian seasoning to marinade.  Other postings are true, you can't tast the sugar.  They are crispy and delicious!!! Baked these along with Ritzy Baked Chicken livers from this website.  A home run!!!!!!

These came out great. I had my 3 and a half year old granddaughter help me with this. She sprinkled liberal amounts of sugar on the sliced potatoes. The potatoes released water and after the seasoning was added, I baked these for 45 minutes at 450F. Midway through I flipped the potatoes over. They came out very crispy. There were no left overs.  I will definitely make these again.

So delicious and easy to make. I made them skinnier ( like matchsticks) , cooked them for 20 min one side and just 2 min on other side because they were so skinny. They were a hit. I can see how this recipe you can have fun with by adding cheeses or seasonings to make a wide variety of specialty fries.

I was skeptical to try this because I was concerned the potatoes would turn out sweet-tasting from the sugar sprinkles. But a good rub down of the potatoes to remove it and to dry the wedges proved to be successful. No sweet aftertaste!

The texture of the potatoes were great. A perfect combo of a bit crispy on the outside and soft and cooked-through on the inside. The seasoning was also great. Next time, I will use a little ground rosemary, I think. This one's a keeper!

Definitely the best baked fried I've ever had. Don't forget the sugar. You won't taste the sugar once you rinse the potatoes; just makes them crispier.

These are soo good. I've also used minced garlic instead of powdered. I bake them on a Pampered Chef bar pan... no flipping required.

Good flavor, used three baking sheets on three levels to enable the fries space. They should have been crunchier. I left them in an extra 5-6 minutes and will bake longer next time.

Half my kids even liked them.  They never like anything that comes from an actual potato.  I think I'll just cut them thinner next time.  I did up the temp to 450 towards the end.  I did save the recipe so I can make them again.

This is a decent recipe. Most of the fries took a little longer than 40 minutes to bake. The fries had a very good flavor, but I ran out of garlic powder as I was preparing the recipe and only had about half of  that called for in the recipe. I leave open the possibility of modifying my rating to five stars if when I prepare it again, the extra garlic powder elevates it.

I made this recipe exactly as instructed and it turned out to be my first successful oven baked fryes. Usually I end up with half mush half burnt disasters, but not this time, I will be making this again.  I want to try this recipe with sweet potatoes next time.
Thank you  for  sharing!

Hard to make in bulk, they turn out the best if they can all lie flat on the plan without being stacked.

Make sure you use a big enough pan so that you just have one single layer. Otherwise, they won’t get crispy. But delicious nevertheless!!

This was my first time making baked fries and it was a success! The seasoning was just right and the fries were nice and crispy.  Adding sugar and then drying them with a towel was a great suggestion. Next time I’ll try making smaller cuts, though.

The sugar process is a must I still cant believe how much moisture is drawn out incredible! I broil the last couple of minutes to get that crunch factor, however keeping an eye will help from over cooking.

I was totally surprised how much starch &  liquid came out of the potatoes using the sugar. Thought at first , okay we will see but it did work and just rinsed in cold water and dried. I did use olive oil with a bit of butter just to add a buttery flavor and man oh man. Was it good. This is my new recipe for oven baked fries.

I've been making these fries for a while using this recipe, this is without a doubt my favorite recipe and a reliable one. They always come out amazing. One thing I like to do after they're done in the oven though is sprinkle with shredded cheese and microwave it for about 40 - 50 seconds and it tastes even better!

You don't need the sugar or the salt; simply dry your newly cut potatoes with a clean tea towel that you can use as your "potato towel" and then coat with oil and spices. They turn out crisp and tasty.

These were very healthy French fries without deep frying saving many calories. They tasted just like deep fried fries. I would make them again.

The sugar was such a cool trick, and worked, so I didn't end up with soggy oven fries. This is the only way I'll do oven fries from now on. And I couldn't taste the sugar, but I patted them dry and probably all the sugar melted off or was patted off.  Thans for this excellent tip

I loved these! The fries are fabulous!  I'll make them again for sure. I made a double batch planning to freeze half.  I followed another reviewer - I removed 1 batch halfway through baking, let cool and froze on a cookie sheet.  She said to bake from frozen for 20 mins at 400 (flipping halfway) on oiled, foil lined pan.

I was looking for an easy recipe to use up some of the potatoes we have.  I followed the directions exactly except used coconut oil since i didn't have any other kind on hand.  My husband HATES coconut flavor but he didn't notice and I didn't tell him.  My kids liked them and gave them a 4 star.  I'm giving a 5 due to taste and super easy to make.  I did bake 20 min on each side.  The aluminium foil needs the cooking spray as the fries do tend to stick.   I also did include the sugar step.

They were amazing though I think you can take a little bit of oil out.  If you like your fries soft either cut the potato thinner or don't use the sugar to get all of the water out and cook for a lesser amount of time.

I was a bit hesitant to add the sugar, didn't want to taste sugar in the fries, but after reading a few of the reviews, I'm glad I did. Don't taste any sugar at all, I baked them following the recipe until they were crispy and they tasted delicious! Next time, I'll double the recipe, they don't last very long!

Only had Splenda so it didn't do the greatest job removing the moisture.  Had to bake for 28 minutes on the second side (8 total extra minutes)  to remove the extra moisture  but they came out beautifully in the end.  My family loved them and will definitely be making them again!

I made half of my batch according to the recipe. The other half I decided to make them spicy and added cayenne pepper. 
They were both awesome. My family devoured them.  I will definitely add this to my favourites.

The sugar is essential! I only had brown sugar when I made this but it worked just fine. Just make sure to dry it really good otherwise your potatoes will stick on the foil. Also oil up your foil really good. I cooked mine in 30 mins instead of 20 just because I cut mine different. But other than that, this recipe is good! I used the Freddy's fries seasoning and I love it!

This was really good. I think my oven gets really hot. I checked it after 15 mins and one side was pretty dark. So I believe I will reduce the temperature next time. Overall, very good.

Very popular with the kids!  The sugar made them crispier than regular roasted potatoes, and the flavor was good.  They got a bit mushier once they cooled though.  I cooked for about 15 min on convection, tossed them to avoid sticking and because they had started to brown quite a bit, and cooked on regular for the remainder of the time.  Next time, I'll try cooking on convection the entire time, just keeping an eye on them to make sure they don't burn.

I like it, kids don't.  The fries generally do not brown evenly.  I assume it's an evaporation issue as I've tried gold, red and russet.   My solution so far has been to  turn the fries over twice during baking.  Good overall idea, better than home fries for dinner that's for sure.

I made these tonight to go with homemade grilled burgers. I loved the texture--nice and crisp on the outside but fluffy in the center. Usually when I'm making fries I soak the potatoes in ice water before baking to pull out the starch, and this is the first time I've heard of using sugar. I used the sugar and let the potatoes sit for about 30 minutes, then dried the potatoes and added them to the bag with the oil, garlic powder and pepper (not the salt--I always salt my fries when they come out of the oven after baking). The fries were a bit sweet because not all the sugar came off just from drying. Next time I would probably rinse them or even soak them in sugar ice water (combining the two techniques). I will definitely make again.

Theses are great. I follow the directions exactly, other than the cut of the fries. I use something called a Chop Wizard to make what resemble French fries my preschoolers eat at restaurants. (I also reduce the time because of the smaller size). They love them!

Delicious home fries!!! I've tried several homemade fries recipe and this by far has been my favorite. The fries are crispy on the outside and  mealy on the inside--perfect combination! They have good seasoning too. I followed the recipe just as called. As others have noted, the sugar can't be tasted. I highly recommend this recipe!

My girls don't like garlic or black pepper, so I just added salt to my oil when dredging the potatoes. They cooked up nice and crisp thanks to the sugar. Will make again. ..

I used splenda instead of sugar and also used garlic powder, chili powder and onion powder with salt and they came out crunchy and tasty!

Never put sugar on potatoes before. It did make the oven fires taste crisper. I used them as a base for chili cheese fries and they didn't get soggy.

These are delicious! Make sure you do not leave out the sugar part! I dried mine individually with paper towels. I also used dried minced onions and ground white pepper  in the bag with the fries. We loved these and I will be making them again- they were so easy and not too unhealthy. For a short-cut, try basting oil- it is already seasoned and will save some time!

I added a little bit of parmesan to the seasoning, and it worked so well. I didn't space mine out perfectly, so a few were a little squishy, but even the squishy ones were delicious! (The rest were perfectly crispy.) We made them a little too early, and they were all gone before the rest of the meal was finished cooking. I will absolutely be making these again!

Great addition to steak on the grill or served alone as a late night snack. Takes some time to prep (I used the sugar and dried the fries with a paper towel), but the results are well worth it. Highly recommended!

I just made these and they were great! I didn't have Yukon Gold on hand but Aldi's potatoes worked just fine.  I was a little thrown off when I read about the sugar but for whatever purpose it serves you can't taste it at all.  I'm not big on spicy food so the full table spoon of pepper ended up being a little much for me.  I'll just adjust it some next time.

Most important emphasis and secret in this recipe is making sure your fries are very dry.  It does not matter if your fries are fresh cut potatoes or been in an ice water brine they need to always be dry for the oil to properly coat and brown the fries.

I followed the directions even though I didn't want to spend the time waiting on the potatoes. So worth the extra effort. I will decrease the pepper next time for my kids. A little on the spicy side. No hint of sugar.

This was very quick and easy to make, they were really good! I had smaller Idaho potatoes so I used those. 

I have never before in my life put sugar on potatoes so I was skeptical when it said to put sugar on the potatoes, but I could appreciate the science behind it. I was scared that my potatoes would start to oxidize leaving them out like that but they were absolutely fine. I seasoned my potatoes with garlic powder, onion powder, sea salt, pepper, and oregano. I thought for a second I could smell a sugary sweet smell when I took the potatoes out, but all my worries were assuaged when I tasted a wedge, no trace of sugar (I did rinse them after the 30m sugar bath). I made these to go along some burgers and they were a great success, both my boyfriend and I loved them. They were crisp but not too crunchy which is something my boyfriend dislikes.

The whole house smelled of garlic so next time I would reduce the garlic powder. Also, mine cooked in about 30 minutes but were very nice and looked golden like the pictures.

I can finally stop searching for a baked fry recipe because this is the one! My four year old is a very picky eater and he loved these even more than when I make my own fried french fries. I did find this recipe had WAY too much pepper for my liking (about 1/2t too much) and a bit too much oil. I used 3 baking potatoes and by the end of the 40 minutes my little fries were swimming in oil. To fix the problem, I popped them under the broiler at 425 for about 3 minutes on each side. They crisped up nicely and went great with some homemade chicken nuggets (http://allrecipes.com/recipe/8849/baked-chicken-nuggets/). Thanks for the recipe!

I was just making a super small portion as a side for my kids dinner. I just used one potato and cut the fries quite small. I've never used sugar before and I was amazing at how much liquid came out! It really did make a difference! It didn't say in the recipe but I'm assuming you were supposed to rinse the sugar off before drying the potato? That's what I did in any case. 
I just seasoned with a little bit of canola oil, salt and pepper. It only took about 10 minutes per side because they were cut so small. 
They were great! Will definitely make again!

Outstanding! We were a little skeptical about these but they turned out great.  Do make sure you space them a bit on the pan the ones that were close together didn't crisp up as nice.  I was as to remedy that by removing the done ones and then putting the oven on broil to crisp up the last few.  Overall these were great; I'll make them in the future for sure.

Just made these quickly. Really impressed. Totally quenched my traditional deep fried, fries craving. Equally as good. I'm surprised how well seasoned they are. I love salt (believe me not bragging), I  thought for sure that I would want more, but with the combo of garlic, olive oil and pepper, 1 tsp. of salt was more than adequate! Although I followed recipe as is, I can see some very simple variations to customize with Cajun seasoning, parmesan cheese etc. But again, great as is!  Will definitely make again.

Very good. My only recommendation is don't do what I did and use the convection oven. They got a little over done on the bottom cooking them for 20mins before I turned them. Just be aware to cut down on the time if using convection oven.
Will definitely make these again.

Great recipe...I had a craving for Chilli Cheese fries but didnt want the mess of frying.  They worked great. Also added a little cumin to the fries before baking. I also soaked the potatoes in water for a few minutes to release the starch, before letting them sit with the sugar.

Excellent !  I only had red potatoes and no garlic powder only garlic salt.  Maybe it was because I was hungover but they were fantastic!!!

I made these once before and now a second time.  Very tasty.  Am I supposed to rinse the sugar off the potatoes and then dry them?

These are good, really good. I only used 4 medium Yukon Golds and it made a lot! I used seasoning salt, instead of regular salt and they had a delicious flavor. Only 4 Stars because they were tender and delicious, but did not really crisp up for me although they browned beautifully. Next time, I will cut them thinner and see if that helps. My fries, this time, were about 3/4" in thickness.

Almost rated 4 stars because  I like my fries a bit thinner than what was called for with this recipe  (some of my thinner ones  burned to the pan ) but I figure thats more my fault than anything. All I had tonight were Idaho potatoes which apparently are more watery than Yukon golds but they still came out wonderfully. I prefer to bake foods rather than fry and  if I can make these every now and then my fiance is less likely to go out and buy a deep fryer (and force me to get over my fear of hot oil). Definitely making these again and again!

I make these all the time! Great side with cheeseburger, etc. I did change a few things though. I sprinkle some paprika before putting it in the oven mainly just for looks. Also I cook one side for 20 mins, flip over and then the other side for only 15. Then I take out and sprinkle parmesan cheese on it. Put back in oven for the remaining five mins and now you have homemade parmesan garlic fries...delicious!

So I actually followed all of the directions (I usually cook by feel and fudge things) - letting the potatoes sit and then drying them before cooking (it was Sunday, so I had the time). Turns out, I should have done a double batch!

I made this for the first time exactly as written. I was hesitant about the sugar, so very hesitant. I put the potatoes in a colander and sprinkled the sugar over top. The amount of liquid that drained from them into the bowl under the colander was astounding. I dried them well with paper towel by blotting them. They came out of the oven, lovely, crisp and brown. 5 stars all around.

I just had these with tysons gluten free nuggets.   The sugar leached lots of water from the potatoes. I baked them as instructed but even at 5 extra minutes they were still soft and lightly brown. This was a good thing as I like soft fries. They were totally cooked but not crispy, not sure why!

Loved them.  After years of disappointment, finally an oven baked french fry that tastes even better than the standard deep fried.  I used russet instead of Yukon gold other than that I followed the recipe.

I didn't pay close attention when reading this and used salt instead of sugar, but it worked anyway. I trialled this with potatoes made in my spiralizer and loved them. They were crispier than just baking immediately, so five stars for method. Thanks for the recipe.

I thought I'd try this method for French fries. Never heard of the sugar trick before! I know salt does the same thing as well. The sugar did release some liquid after 30 minutes, and I decided to rinse the potatoes off and dry over paper towels. A 1/4 cup of olive oil sounded like way too much, and I didn't want the potatoes burnt so I used a Tbsp. of canola oil and a Tbsp. of olive oil. I also left off the salt until after baking as the salt can make the potatoes soggy in the oven. So I sprinkled them with sea salt right out of the oven. I have a good quality heavy bottomed sheet pan and these baked for 15 minutes on one side, 10 on the other and they were perfectly cooked. Everyone loved them!

They were very good, although they did lack crispiness which makes French fries perfect. I did leave out the sugar- I'm not too fond of sweet fries.

Best and tastiest baked homemade fries hands down. FYI for salt-sensitive people, substitute Mrs. Dash and/or paprika for salt. It works fantastic!

I used Russet potatoes instead of Yukon Gold, because that's what I had on hand.  I cut the potatoes into slightly larger fries than recommended.  They turned out very well, but next time I will cut the potatoes into slightly smaller pieces.

While the seasoning is good, the use of olive oil and cooking at 425 degrees is really off. They came out super burnt after only 15 minutes because olive oil couldn't handle the heat of 425 degrees. FAIL.

I've used this recipe several times in the past few weeks, making a half-batch or so of the standard wedge cut fries and keeping the skin on my russet potatoes, and throwing on some Mrs. Dash and Canadian steak seasoning once I've got them all laid out for the oven. They're absolutely delicious! I have to keep an eye on my leftovers - any of these fries that I try to save for the next day or so have this particular penchant for going missing while others are in the house. The sugar is a curious step, but I have to agree that it's necessary and the sugar's taste isn't really noticeable in the finished fries - especially with my additions. All in all, this is something my family and I enjoy, and I'll certainly be continuing to use this recipe!

My family enjoyed these fries. I followed the recipe exactly the first time and felt like there was too much olive oil left over. The fries were delicious, but I threw away a lot of olive oil in the Ziploc. So the next time I threw everything in the bag, then added olive oil until fully coated. I liked that much better and the fries were still delicious. I also think it's important not to skip the step where the potatoes sit 20-30 mins to dry up. I skipped that once, and while still delicious, not as crispy. This is a very easy and yummy recipe, try it!!

These came out perfect as followed.  I just used 3/4 tsp pepper to tone it down a bit. Glad I did.  Will definitely make these again!

My husband and I were pleasantly surprised with how well this recipe turned out. Easy to make and they really do taste like fried fries. We can't wait to make the next batch!

They were really good. I followed the recipe except for the garlic powder, I had none. Instead I cut up several cloves of garlic and let it sit for an hour, removed the garlic and proceeded with the recipe. The sugar is a must if you want crispy fries. Nice method, thanks

These are amazing - made them last night, and I agree with other reviewers that you don't taste the sugar at all, and that they were the closest to actual french fries I've ever tried.  And, of course, much healthier.

the taste was ok, nothing special, they were not crispy at all. I don't know what I did wrong. They were crispy until I took them out of the oven and put them on a plate they became soft....

I used Yukon Gold Potatoes and followed the Directions.  I only had time to let the Sugared Potatoes sit for 20 minutes, next time I will let them sit for the full 30 minutes.  I agree that using the Sugar does allow the Starch from the Potatoes to come out, and chemically react, and you do get an overall crisper Oven French Fry.  But, they were still a bit mushy in the middle and the edges almost burnt.  I would attachly recommend that you use Virgin Olive Oil, just sprinkle on some Garlic Powder, Salt, and Pepper, and turn the Oven Temperature down to 400 Degrees.  I will try these again, since I always get Fresh Yukon Potatoes in my CSA Share, and I don't want to buy Frozen French Fries.  Oh to see how they make those Frozen French Fries would be such a secret treat!

Absolute best oven fries I have tasted. DH keeps wanting to get a deep fryer which I object to the idea. First for health reasons and second that he has been known to flambe items that shouldn't be flambeed. Did what one reviewer suggested with putting on the cooling rack on the baking sheet and didn't have to flip them. I lightly brushed the rack with olive oil and put a silicone liner on the baking sheet so cleanup was a breeze. This will definitely be my go to recipe for oven fries.

Great recipe. I did not have time to "dry" the potatoes, so I just cooked them longer.  Excellent.

Awesome. Taste like fried fries!  And as others have said, do not forget the sugar step. I did use about 4 T of sugar instead of one. You can really see the water coming out of the potatoes. Thamks

These were OK. The flavor was good, and they were really fluffy inside. However, the outside was a little tough and chewy. It's certainly not a bad recipe, but I've had better oven baked potato wedges that didn't take as long to prepare.

I did do the sugar and the taste was good. The reason it got a 3 instead of a 5 star is there was NO WAY it needed 40 minutes to cook. I set it at 20 for the first go and some of them were already burnt on the edges. So i suggest you check them at 20 minutes or do 10 on each side. Otherwise the sugar trick was great and they were good

Followed this recipe to a "t" and thought it was too greasy. Will continue to look for a different recipe.

Simply Awesome!!  But don't use Yukon golds - use Russets - you'll get much better results.

I absolutely love this recipe. It is made at least 3 times a month. My whole family loves it too. I use sunset potatos and add parmesan cheese. It is great.

Its delicious. The bake time is worth the wait. I've never heard of adding sugar to oven fries, but I was intrigued after reading the cook's note. Thanks for sharing.
