This has been passed through our family for years.  A great recipe!  Some suggestions would be to serve it on top of lettuce, instead of mixing it in.  That way you can keep it for leftovers.  Also, mix the dressing  with the meat, beans, tomatoes and cheese first, then add the chips on top and lettuce on bottom.  You can do without one of the onions, and one of the beans, kidney beans work best. A great dip for chips as a snack/appetizer, too!

This has been a staple in our house for years.  I don't change the ingredients, just make it more figure friendly.  The Kraft "Light Done Right" Catalina dressing is great and has less fat/calories.  The leanest ground beef and using romaine/iceberg mix helps too! I also substitute Baked Doritos for the corn chips.  Very hearty & satisfying salad...Yummy!!

I served this at a tex mex party and everyone loved it.  I left out the meat though, because I was serving it with enchiladas and tacos.  Make just what you need, as it doesn't last for the next day.  I had everything cut up seperate and did a quick mixing just before serving.  I used the chips as a bedding on the bottom of a large bowl and put a few chips on top for garnishing.  I will use this recipe again.

Excellent recipe... been using one very much the same since my grandmother brought it back from southern Ca. in the 80's....  try using a little less catalina and mix some sour cream and taco sauce with the dressing you do use for a delightfully different tasting dressing. Sometimes I add 2 pkgs of taco seasoning to the meat, unless of course, you are watching salt intake.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe Melanie.

Perfect for lunch!  I used some left over chili I had on hand vs. ground beef and canned beans.  I layered everything over the lettuce and added tortilla chips vs. corn chips and topped it with a bit of sour cream and "Smoked Paprika Vinaigrette" from this site.

This is by far the best Mexican-influenced salad I've ever found.  It is better on day 2! Don't add chips, though, if you plan to eat it more than one day.  Chips become soggy.

This is the first "allrecipe.com" recipe I didn't give 5 stars.  I thought it was terrible, and everyone thought it was too sweet..just not a good combo of ingredients.  It tasted far better without any dressing and without the meat.

I was looking for a summer salad to use as a meal (with a good healthy balance).  This was WONDERFUL!  I used light cheese and only an 8 oz bottle of Catalina.  Yum!  Thank you!

VERY good.  I used too much dressing, so it was a little soggy.  Flavor was great.  Don't count on leftovers, does not keep well (what salad does).  Will make again.

Oh how I've missed you, recipe!  I think this was first popular in the 60's?  I had actually forgotten about it (and lost the recipe) until a friend asked me if I had that taco salad recipe my g'ma used to make, so I went looking.  I followed the recipe with the exception of leaving out the avacado and green onions only because I completely forgot  to pick them up from the store, and YES, that bummed me pretty bad.  Like many, I combined everything but the lettuce and dressing, since I cook for just me and knew there would be many portions.  It only lacked a bit of "bite" so I did add some Louisiana Hot Sauce at the end.  Thanks for the memories!!

Great recipe!  You definitely don't need to use the entire 16 oz bottle of catalina dressing.  I had the 8 oz bottle and that was plenty, otherwise it's too sweet.

Brought this to a large gathering.  Usually, taco salad is taco salad, but I kept hearing comments about this one even from people who didn't know I had made it!  I left out the onions, red because they are too strong for many people, and green because I simply forgot although they would have been good.  Where I come from, Dorothy Lynch is the ONLY dressing that goes in taco salad, try it instead of Catalina.  I used fat free Dorothy Lynch.

I have always liked this version of taco salad.  I use an 8 oz. bottle of Catalina dressing.  I also add chopped bell pepper because it gives even more crunchiness.  This is one of those recipes that you can easily change up, depending on your preference.  I also have chopped avocado for anyone who wants to add it.

This taco salad was fantastic! Simple, every-day ingredients so it made it real easy to make. I loved the Catalina dressing on the salad, and I think that is what sets this taco salad apart from many others because of the unique taste. Some people said that they thought the Catalina was a bit off for a taco salad, but that is the key ingredient in making it different than your typical taco salad. Will definitely make again. AND my son ate his whole plate - WOW!! Thanks for the wonderful recipe, Melanie!

Good salad. I skipped the pinto beans and avacado. Plus instead of chips I deep fried (using a tin can to shape) a few soft taco shells to make edible bowls. Yum!!

I've been making this recipe for years, it's great for all seasons!  What I do differently...if you're concerned about sodium skip the packaged taco seasoning and add your own blend of spices. You may also substitute low/no fat Catalina dressing. I do not mix the meat and beans with the salad rather I add the dressing and chips to the salad (toss) and then top with the meat mixture. If you want left-overs skip mixing dressing and chips and do so individually. That way the lettuce doesn't become soggy.

All time family favorite! My family has enjoyed this salad for 30  years.
The key here is to use CATALINA dressing.  We always use the kraft LIGHT Catalina.
Also, try with Nacho Cheese Doritos for the chips.
this is so fabulous!

Who doesn't like a taco salad. I only used one can of pinto beans and left out the kidney beans since it was just the two of us. We didn't use any dressing just topped with some light sour cream.

I just started making this salad recently. My family loves it! This version of the salad is particularily good. One suggestion I would make is using nacho flavored tortilla chips it really kicks it up a notch. This recipe is the best for taco salad I've ever tried.

I debated on reviewing this recipe, because of the changes I made.  I used chicken because I didn't have ground beef.  I used plain white onion because it's what I had.  I thought the salad was very good; maybe a bit too many beans, and I did miss the traditional green pepper.  Overall tho, very pleased with the results.

This is delicious and classic taco salad.  I only used one can of black beans, but besides that it is perfect!  The one critical review stating it would be better without lettuce and meat made me laugh out loud.   Well then it wouldn't be a taco or salad, now would it??

My children and I love this salad! I leave out the avocados, not a big fan of them. I have to put the tomatoes and onions on 1 side. My daughter doesn't like 'em. I have used the taco seasoning recipe from AR and I can not tell a difference from the packaged. Great recipe!

I was a little sceptic because we never eat Catalina dressing, however this was great! quick & easy to make! I left out all the onions. I also didn't add the dressing until I made each salad, that way I could add ranch dressing to the kids salads. Yummy!

I really liked this recipe. I made my own taco seasoning from AR and added my onions to the beef. I also made my own dressing, 1/2 cup of salsa and 1/4 of ranch. It was enough for two large salads. I've made single serving with 3 tablespoon salsa and 1 tablespoon ranch. Yummy!

My family serves this salad as a 'build your own' so we can make it just the way we like it. We also use Russian instead of Catalina. A favorite for sure!!

Can't go wrong with this recipe!

We left out the pinto beans just because we didn't have it on hand. And the onion because my husband isn't a huge fan.  Still very good!

Made this for the family tonite and it got rave reviews even from my 7yr old who is a picky eater.  Added sour cream on top for even a bigger yum factor.  This is quick and easy to make plus it is delicious!!!!!!!

This was so good and really hit the spot tonight; not to mention that it took practically no time to prepare. I used ground turkey and made my own taco seasoning so I could control the salt. Instead of mixing everything all together, I placed the salad around individual plates and put the meat mixture in the center. Can't wait for lunch tomorrow! Thanks so much Melanie!

Catalina dressing???!!!!  No way.....I'd only use a salsa ranch or plain old salsa.  Otherwise it's a pretty good salad.

Delicious, only used one can of black beans instead of kidney and pinto beans.  Makes a lot of salad I halved the recipe and we still had lots left but its not a salad that's good the second day.  I also made the salad again later on in the week and made it vegetarian by adding taco seasoning to my can of beans.  Still tasted great. Another tip is I use the taco seasoning recipe on this site and make a large batch of it, you will never have to buy those individual packets again.

This is another dish I made for my sisters Baby shower and it was super easy to make and I just love avocado's so I added some to this recipe and I also added a can of corn. Everyone loved this dish and I just loved how easy and simple it was to make! I just found another favorite dish!

I don't use the Catalina dressing.  I mix 8 ounces of sour cream with 8 ounces of taco sauce and mix it well into the remaining ingredients.  Haven't had a complaint yet!

This version of a taco salad was super tasty. I love the Catalina dressing- it is the first time I tried it on a taco salad- and it really really worked! 
I have made this with chicken, ground turkey, and ground beef.
I usually add more veggies also- such as carrots, bellpepper, mixture of lettuces (spinach, green leaf), lots more avocado, etc. 
I also used less cheese, and added a small dollop of sour cream.

Really really good, I used only kidney beans, Doritos instead of corn chips, & just about 1/2 cup (4 ounces) of Catalina dressing, I tried another recipe in the past that used a whole bottle of Catalina and it was WAY too sweet. Nice to be able to add beans to a dish and still have everyone enjoy it. Thanks for posting the recipe!

This is an EXCELLENT taco salad. The only thing I would do differently is not slicing the onion but chopping it up instead, the onion slices were way to big in my salad. My fault though! I will certainly do this one again.

Made it, loved it. We like chopped black olives, will add that next time. Will use less dressing next time. Had leftovers. Will have bowl of lettuce separate from bean, meat, onion, dressing, etc. mixture. Serve Fritos on the side so they don't get soggy. Teens say it is all mixed at grad parties, goes quickly! My daughter likes hers with sour cream and taco sauce.

My husband and I loved this taco salad! The only changes I made were I used black beans along with the pinto beans because we don't like kidney beans. I also added a can of corn. I took the advice of another reviewer and mixed salsa with sour cream. I also had a bottle of  Hidden valley salsa ranch and used that as well. I kept the lettuce, mission tortilla chips and sliced avocados separate from the other taco salad ingredients so the avocados will stay fresh and the lettuce and tortilla chips will be crispy for tomorrow. I added the lettuce to my plate, then I topped with the mixture and then added avocados and the sour cream and salsa mixture and then a little of the hidden valley salsa ranch dressing and then topped it with crushed tortilla chips and mixed it all together on my plate. It was absolutely delicious! My husband loved it and so did I. I will definitely make this again! :)

This has been a favorite of mine since I was a child. I now make it for my kids and they love it. I do not mix the ingredients which allows everyone to make their own personal salad. My chip of choice for this salad is original doritos. YUMMY!

Excellent taco salad. Instead of Catalina dressing, we have used Thousand Island dressing for years.  Also, because the chips tend to get soggy if all the salad is not eaten, we let each person add their chips.

This has been a favorite of mine since childhood.  To add extra kick you can substitute doritos for the plain corn chips.  Also, french dressing will work if you don't have Catalina.

I did change out the kidney beans for black beans... for my taste buds only. We served this for guests & the next time my girlfriend & her husband came for dinner she expressly asked for This Taco Salad because of the Catalina dressing! She had remembered that taste for almost a year. Now that's a recommendation!

Very good. Mixed the pintos into the meat mixture.  Served everything on the side so everyone could add what they liked. And I could keep the salad and it would be good the next day.

This was a great recipe and a different way to eat Taco Salad, however, the lettuce, cheese, chips and meat mixture would probably not be a good idea if there will be leftovers.  My avocados were too ripe so I had to omit that ingredient, but I'm sure it would have added a different flavor.  I normally fix my Taco Salad with Southwestern Chicken and Italian dressing to top it off. So sure I will make this again with the necessary variations.  Thanks Melanie!

Love taco salad in the summer. This one did not disappoint. Catalina is a must in taco salad in this house. I couldn't use onions because hubby won't eat them and I was bummed I forgot the avocado. Tasty!

Easy and crowd pleasing! I leave out the red onion and avocado. If making for dinner, I let me family assemble their own with the desired toppings and then add the dressing. Otherwise, you can't save leftovers as they'll be soggy with dressing. Fritos brand chips are a must for this dish!

I love this recipe. I used 1 1/2 heads of lettuce because there was so much dressing. I added 2 jalopeno peppers diced very small and 8 ounces of mediem salsa. Many of people asked for the recipe. I will make again.

Super dellish.  The kids enjoyed the cruch of the chips in the salad.  I used ranch dressing this time, but will look for the Catalina next time.  Both are a refreshing change from regular salsa and sour cream.  Thanks for the recipe!

Loved this salad! I mixed kidney beans in with my meat then mixed the meat mixture with the avocado, cheese, and tomatoes and put this on a bed of lettuce with the chips and dressing on top. This allowed for the meat mixture to be saved for leftovers without getting soggy. I'm making this again for dinner tonight!

This is a great salad!  I've made it for years and everyone loves it.  Awhile ago, I served the taco salad as an entree, accompanied by macaroni and cheese as a side dish.  There's something about this combo--cold salad/warm mac & cheese, sweetness (the Catalina dressing) and crunchiness/creamy cheesiness--double yum!!

Taco Salad III Haiku: "Deceiving salad. Healthy? No, but tasty? Yes! (Separate, to save.)" OK, so I changed a few small things, but I'd stress not mixing everything together, so that if you have leftovers, they won't soggify. My only changes, due to what I had, were to use black beans, romaine lettuce, and spicy-nacho doritos, as well as tossing in a handful of corn. Mmm I love how I trick myself into thinking "salad for dinner! No guilt!", but end up devouring a mountain of this, b/c it's just so good.

This was a hit. I roasted the peppers and onions and I let out the dressing and topped it with a little bit of nacho cheese. It was quite well received.

I  left out the red onion, and used one large can of Bush's chili beans, green leaf lettuce, and Fritos Scoops. While the Scoops held up very well, the green leaf lettuce wilted a lot more than I think the iceberg would have. It was very good, but the leftovers weren't worth saving. I will make it again, but will serve the lettuce separately next time.

I used a double batch of Bill Echol's taco seasoning, only cut back on the salt and heat because I'm feeding little mouths. I did cook the onion and pepper together with minced garlic, then added it to the beef mixture. I used shredded cabbage, as it's healthier than iceberg and I served it with corn chips, homemade salsa and sour cream. Very good. One of our favorite comfort meals made better with homemade products and healthier ingredients. EDITED: After trying the meat mixture, I did add a tbsp. of brown sugar and a tbsp. of fresh lime juice.

This was a great recipe, but I liked the few changes I made. Instead of both types of beans, I just used one can of black beans. As well, I used a new salad dressing that just came out called salsa ranch - it was dynamite! I have a family event to go to this weekend, and everyones already asking if I'll make this again - good job!

This is a fabulous recipe!  I don't add the lettuce or catalina until after, on my own plate, since my kids don't care for it.  They prefer ranch on top.  We make this all the time!!

This recipe is good with a few changes.  I donot add any beans, I use Frito brand corn chips and Honey Catalina dressing.  Allow each person to add their own prefered amount of corn chips. It does not keep well for left overs so adjust your portion sizes accordingly.

Five thumbs up for this delicious meal.  I added canned corn, canned chopped green chiles and used grape tomatoes instead of chopped regular tomatoes.

I made this recipe and it was so good that every body had seconds.  In fact it was so good that we all ate way tooo much!  I only used a quarter of the bottle of dressing (low fat Catalina) because it was already very moist with the tomatoes, and a little dressing goes along way.  I also used whole grain tortilla chips so it felt a little bit healthier! Awesome taco salad and so easy to make!

Yummo.  I didn't have the dressing so we just used picante salsa and taco bell hot sauce as the dressing.  I also mixed the iceberg lettuce with mixed green lettuce for more health benefits.  I also added black olives, used guacamole rather than avocado, chili beans rather than plain pinto beans, and added canned sweet whole corn and red bell pepper for a rainbow colored mostly healthy dinner.  Nacho cheese chips worked well as a substitute for tortilla chips.

Made it as written and it's terrific!  In California our Taco Salad is basically the same with these changes. For dressing make Italian dressing using the dry package then add a drop or two or more of Tabasco,  according to your tastes.  Mix dressing and crushed tortilla chips just before serving.  What's amazing is the left over salad is terrific as a wilted salad. Just add some more crushed chips and enjoy!

Nice basic taco salad recipe!  Just as good with ground turkey instead of beef.  Catalina dressing didn't sound appetizing to me. Topped it with salsa instead. Thanks for the recipe!!

I prefer the variation of this recipe where I mix the French with salsa. Cuts calories and keeps the taco theme. I've also added cucumbers instead of onions. I keep the dressing and meat separate so it saves as leftovers.

This was a delicious, one-dish salad for supper. I preferred just adding all of the ingredients to the top of the butter lettuce mix I had as opposed to mixing them all up. I'm sure that would work great for a crowd, though. I used leftover sloppy joe mix, because I like to use what I have on hand. In place of the pinto beans, I used light red kidney beans. I liberally sprinkled homemade taco seasoning mix over the salad before adding the dressing. The Catalina dressing works really well here, and I used my own homemade version from another site. I also used tortilla chips instead of corn chips. Thanks for the great recipe, Melanie!

This was very good. I did everything as written. The only thing I would change next time is to reduce the amount of red onion, or perhaps dice it instead of slicing it. It was just a but much. Otherwise, very yummy! Thanks!

Big fan! I didn't use catalina dressing. Instead I used about half cup of salsa. I don't normally rate recipes that I have altered but I have had a similar taco salad with catalina so I know that it's good. My boys gobbled this up fast! We will make this again soon!

Wonderful!  Only changes: used ground turkey, romaine lettuce, sub black beans for the kidney beans and used ranch dressing and salsa.  Putting this one on the rotation.

Brought this to a potluck and it was gobbled up!  Right before serving, I mixed in about half a bottle of the dressing and corn chips, microwaved pre-seasoned and browned ground beef to heat up and put on top of the salad.  It was very good!

I usually use a friend's taco salad recipe, but I had misplaced it and I hadn't heard back from her before I had to shop for ingredients; so I logged into this trusted website and again, you didn't let me down. 
I choose this recipe for the convenience of it. It was easy to make - and I made a double  batch because it went to a youth groups end of year bash. My bowl came back EMPTY (and there was lots!!) I'm glad I made myself a bowl to taste it before I sent it; it was AMAZING! I can't wait to go out shopping for more ingredients to make some for myself. 
I did not change anything in the recipe; I did omit the avocado per my son's request. Next time, I'm adding the avocado!! 
ps - I so appreciate the review that made this recipe a little healthier since I am trying to stick with healthy choices now. 
THANKS SO MUCH!!

wonderful! The avacados in our local store were nasty so I bought prepared guacamole and snipped a corner off the bag and squirted it over the other ingredients. I used a bag of shredded lettuce (time saving) and subbed the pinto beans for garbanzo beans as suggested in another recipe. My husband raved. We will be using this again.

This is a great, basic Taco Salad! Big suggestion though -leave out the dressing! It's delicious served with your favorite Salsa, some sour cream, and avocado or fresh made guacamole. The flavors come to life and it cuts out extra fat and sugar that comes in the salad dressing. Refried beans are a great replacement for the whole beans too.

good. i gave 3 starts because 1 whole bottle of catalina dressing was just too much, i'd use half that amount. i did like the catalina in it though. i had taco shells instead of chips, so put it in the taco shell bowl and then break off some bowl and put it in the salad, eat some, break off more, and so on. next time i would cut down on the onion too. this recipe has endless possibilities!

Great taco salad, I minused the beans. The guests seemed to like it. EDIT : Made with the beans and I really liked it! I will use half of each of the beans next time because it was super beaney!

This has been a staple in my house and for parties for years. We love it. I use Catalina dressing or for a little zing- Western dressing is great.

This salad was declicious! I used the premade southwestern chicken strips and added black beans instead and was impressed! I will eat this up for lunch tomorrow. Very easy to make and no cooking involved with the chicken!

We loved this recipe!  Didn't have avocado, so we added black beans to the meat as it was cooking - provided additional nutrition, fiber, color, texture and flavor.  I put everything in bowls like a salad bar and let our family make their own salads.  We will make this again and again.  Thanks Melanie.

This salad was really good!  We left out the onions due to personal preference but that was the only change we made!  I'm bringing the leftovers for lunch tomorrow.  Thanks Melanie!

I was surprised to find this recipe here. I thought this was my family secret. This recipe has always been a every other week dinner in my family growing up. I also now make it every other week for my family. My husband at first thought I was crazy when I introduced it to him and now he can't get enough. My mother mixed it all together also, but with my family I don't mix anything together. I have some that don't like beans or less dressing. Also some with extra cheese. So I decided to mix it in our own and it's easier to store for leftovers.

This was great because it was hot outside and I didn't want anything heavy. I left the avocado in slices and didn't mix this in a big bowl. Everyone assembled this on their own plates. I used black beans and only 1 can instead of the other 2 kinds. We all enjoyed this meal, thanks!

My husband got me started on the search for this recipe and I am sooo glad I found it. I LOVE this salad. I serve it up separate due to picky eaters and then add the dressing (it doesn't take much) and Frito's on top. My family loves tacos, so this is a little variation we throw in to mix it up. Thanks for sharing!!!

I made this and put it in taco shells that I baked in the oven.. I used refried beans for convenience and my own chipotle dressing since I don't use bottled!.. So good with cilantro, cheese, olives, salsa, green onions!  I didn't put the chips in, but served them on the side!.. Thanks!

Very tasty. I left out the avacado and used French dressing instead of Catalina. I don't add the lettuce or corn chips directly to the salad because they get too soggy for leftovers.

I used veggie crumbles instead of hamburger and skipped the beans. I prepped the "meat" right  before assembling the salad and tossed it in while still warm on top of the lettuce, tomatoes & avocado. I sprinkled the cheese on top of that, then the  crushed chips and then tossed it all together. For dressing we served salsa and sour cream on the side and everyone got to dress their own salad as per their taste. 
It was a bit hit, even with my fussy kids & husband, and the leftovers tasted good the next day too.

made this for a family party of 21.  added black olives to the recipe, it was delicious!  i felt (as did most others that i ate it with) that you didnt need any dressing, the juice from the meat was good enough!  im adding this to my go to easy recipes!

This was really good! I read a review about using 2 packets of taco seasoning, tried it, bad idea. The meat was way too salty! The salad mixture itself was delicious. Next time I will use only the green onions and I am going to use ranch instead of the catalina. Other reviewers have great add-in ideas (black beans, corn, black olives) which I can't wait to try. I am so glad I found this site!

Very good although I'm new to this site and didn't know that you could adjust the serving size.  I made this for me and my wife last night and it made a LOT of salad before I realized it was 8 servings.

Otherwise, very filling and doesn't leave you feeling "fat".  I had 2 helpings :)

What I like about thie recipe is that all of the basic foundations are here to make a really great taco salad!

How I changed it though, is that instead of using iceberg lettuce, I used romaine, though I think people should use the lettuce that they personally enjoy.

Also, I substituted ground beef for ground turkey (again a personal preference).

I didn't want my salad to be too 'oniony' so, I opted to leave out the red onion and used only the green onion.

I didn't want my salad to be too 'beany' either, so instead of using both the kidney and pinto beans, I used only the kidney beans--though on second thought, maybe using black beans would be nice too.

Also, I don't like the idea of combining all of the ingredients together. So, instead, I layered everything like a GIANT tostada. First with the layer of lettuce, then the meat, next the cheese, and then the beans, tomatoes, black olives (I decided to add this too) and then lastly the green onions.

I topped the whole thing off with a LARGE dollop of sour cream and for the dressing, I drizzled on some Ortega brand taco sauce. (To me, the Catalina dressing somehow misses the mark in that in kinda detracts from the 'taco' taste of the salad.)

Though all in all, this is quite an excellent recipe!!!

Thanks so much for posting this!!!

This was great! I wanted to make it a healthier choice, so I use fat free Catalina, and 2% cheese. I also left out the onions and avacado. I didn't mix it all together and the next day use the meat and bean mixture for nachos. Yummy!

I made this recipe exactly as written with the exception of eliminating the avocado. I was hesitant that it would discolor. Everyone really enjoy the salad, but it does taste better served the next day.  The flavors meld together.

I have not personally made this specific recipe but I have made something that is very similar to it! I use Dorthy Lynch dressing instead of the Catalina dressing and it gives it AWESOME flavor. My husband LOVES it!!!! So if you are wanting something that isn't really sweet, try the other dressing you wont be mad you did!

My husband and I thought this recipe was great! My husband is not a big fan of Taco Salads....so, I was pleased when he said this one was the best he has ever had. The only thing I did different was I waited to put the lettuce and chips. We just put them on our individual servings. We used Frito corn chips...it was delicious!

Everyone in the family really enjoyed this salad and asked if I would make it regularly. I don't like Catalina salad dressing, so I used Ranch. And I didn't really need to add very much, maybe only 1/3 of a cup. I also omitted the pinto beans and added sliced black olives. I had leftover taco seasoned meat in the freezer, which made this dinner very quick and easy.

I thought this recipe made a very good taco salad!  The only changes I made were to use Lite French dressing and I omitted the beans (personal preference).  I did not mix the dressing in the salad but put it on the table and let everyone add how much they wanted.  Very good!

We were hungry for tacos, but didn't want to make the shells, so threw this together. I only used pinto beans, (Ranch style with jalapenos) and a spicy home made ranch dressing.  I also added some chopped cilantro when I chopped the avacado, onion and tomato together, added a little lime juice and bottled pepper sauce to that as well. Wonderful warm evening supper!

The basis of this recipe was great,like many others I changed this a little, I used 3/4 of a head of iceberg lettuce and a whole head of Romaine(much healther) ommited the red onion(two kinds of onion to much)omitted the pinto beans and avocados.  Added sliced black olives and used only a cup of home made ranch dressing not catalina. I also used white tortilla chips not corn.  It sounds like I re-did the whole recipe.  I took this to church last night and everyone raved about it.

This was really good!  More than enough to feed 4, doesn't keep well so I'll half the recipe next time.  I even mistook the "corn chips" for fritos and it was still good.  ;)

Very good and easy salad to prepare. Enjoyed by everyone at luncheon. Will use iceberg next time--I didn't have anything but romaine and thought it would work. Lesson learned.

Reviewed with these changes. I omitted the red onion and green onion and added  chopped onion when I browned the beef. Also the pinto beans as we don't like them. I didn't use the avocado but should because they are so good for you. Thank you heatherjane for the recipe

This turned out great. Took it to a pot luck and had one guy go out of his way to tell me how good it was. Changes I made were to omit the onion, used only 1 can of beans and no avocado.  It took most of the bottle of dressing, which I put on right before serving along with the crushed nacho chips.

This is my Taco Salad inspiration recipe! I vary depending on what I have on hand. Love the pinto bean in it and  the Catalina does it for me especially if the meat is spicy! I do use a vegetarian meat alternative, never used kidney because for me....yucky... and we prefer a green mix vs. just iceberg.  Roasted corn, radishes, cilantro, jalapeno or Hatch, black beans or whatever and it has always been fantastic in our home!

It is good, but too sweet with the Catalina dressing. Maybe using a salsa instead of dressing would be better.  Also, I the prep time seems highly optimistic. It took me 1hr 15min from start to finish. There is just no way to slice up an onion, a bunch of green onions, 2 tomatoes, and shred the cheese all in 15min.

I followed the recipe and wasn't that impressed. I didn't like the dressing suggestion and think it would have been better if it was a spicy lime vinaigrette. I thought it was a little bland. If I would make again, I would add jalapeno and I would change the dressing. My family all used the dressing the recipe called for, while I used salsa.

I grew up on this salad on hot days ! Saw this recipe come in and thought my family should give it a shot! After much grumbling and "that looks gross" as they watched me make it, they all tried it with much tripidation. When they all went back for seconds, I realized next time I will double the recipe. A new family favorite !

Perfect recipe for quick dinner.  Maintain the meat mixture separate from the greens for several days storage.  A great mixture for baked potatoes.

The salad was really good, but WAY too much for two people. I will cut the recipe in half next time. I didn't have a big enough bowl to mix everything. I used two large bowls.

Good recipe but a good taco salad involves a tortilla bowl...not corn chips. Corn chips are for nacho salads.

pretty good, girlfriend absolutely loved it! I kinda like meatier food so I would have added another half pound or even full pound of beef..

FYI to the people who say it's "too sweet"..

you're not supposed to dump the entire bottle of dressing into it, read the recipe through before commenting!

I made this for my family and it was a big hit.  The combination of the seasoned meat with Catalina dressed lettuce and chips is wonderful and I think its great that you can be flexible with the other add ins to satisfy personal preferences.  I have a request for an encore this week.

Nice summer dinner. I subbed kidney beans out of personal preference. I used a sweet Vidalia onion tomato dressing and it was perfect for this. I skipped the chips but added a dollop of sour cream. Served instant Mexican rice on the side for a quick, throw-together, too hot to slave over a stove kind of evening. Next time I'll cook up the meat in the morning for more flavor and possibly add cilantro to brighten it up a bit.

This recipe is awesome! The best out there. However there is one thing I do different that makes a big difference. After cooking the ground beef and adding the taco seasoning, I then add the beans and the Catalina dressing. This is refrigerated over night. The meat soaks up the dressing so it's not too soggy. The day of serving add the other ingredients. I then crush  taco flavored Doritos and add them right before serving. If you had chips to any portion that will be left over, they will be soggy.

left out the red onion because I'm the only one that likes it and omitted the kidney beans because I don't like those.  :)  But my husband loved the salad and we all had seconds!

This was very good.  The best part was that everyone could "build" their own salad based on their tastes.

This is pretty close to how I remember it from when I was little.  I thought I would make this for my daughter and her girlfriend, but they didn't like it as much as I had hoped.  I'm not sure what it is, but it's VERY sweet.  I'm assuming that Catalina dressing over the years has really changed because I don't remember it being this sweet.  Then again, that may have been the reason why I loved it so much when I was little!  I'll keep it and tweak it to our family's taste with some thousand island mixed in to cut the sweetness!  Thanks!!

This is how my family has always made Taco Salad! When I make it I leave out the taco seasoning, onions, and avocados. You must use Catalina dressing and Frito type of corn chips.

My boyfriend & I loved this. I used ground turkey instead & fried up my own corn tortilla strips for that extra crunch. Will definitely be making this again. Thanks for sharing!!!

I liked this recipe a lot. It really satisfied my craving. I changed a few things, didn't add so much onion, I made Pico de Gallo instead and used that. I also cooked my own kidney beans and just used those. I added some sour cream and Mission chips. Yummy!

I made this at home 1st before making it for a pot luck just to be on the safe side since it was a new recipe. It was amazing! I substituted ground turkey and added frozen corn to the meat when you add the seasoning. This was so good I made it three times that week and can't wait to make it again.

Pretty good!  I love onions, but for someone who doesn't, this would be too "oniony" for them.  Makes a lot, so plan accordingly!
