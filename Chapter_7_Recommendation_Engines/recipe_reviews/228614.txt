I made Polenta Pizza Last night and it was outstanding.  As soon as I saw the recipe I HAD to have it.  Made a basic polenta with chicken broth and Golden Pheasant "Polenta type degerminated corn meal" which my Raley's carries.  I spread it in sheet a cake pan and chilled. I cut into rectangles about 4" X 6" and pan fried briefly in a dab of olive oil. I didn't have mushrooms and almost made a several mile trip just to buy some, but in the end made do with sweet Italian sausage, onions, peppers, Italian seasoning, sauce and mozzarella. It was heaven. I will make it again with lots of saut√©ed mushrooms...like TOMORROW!  Thanks for an outstanding recipe!

I had never had polenta before but I did have a package of prepared polenta on the shelf which I had purchased quite some time ago. Not wanting to waste it I searched and found this recipe. Instead of cooking it in a skillet, I sliced it 1/2 inch thick, brushed a little olive oil on both sides and placed them on a foil lined baking sheet and broiled them until they turned slightly browned on both sides. While that was happening I cooked onions, garlic, mushrooms and the sausage in the skillet. Hubby doesn't like peppers but I bet they would have been great in this. I cooked it all until their juices dried up before adding the spaghetti sauce. When it was all nice and hot I poured it all on top of the polenta on the baking sheet, sprinkled a little parmesan and covered it with mozzarella cheese. I put this back under the broiler until the cheese was melted. It was fabulous! Tasted wonderful. Hubby went back for seconds but he did say that he would have preferred pasta in stead of polenta, but polenta is a nice change of pace and this is an excellent way to use it!
