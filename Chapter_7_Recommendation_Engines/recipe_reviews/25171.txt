This is a delicious and light-tasting Italian dressing!  Per other reviewers, I eliminated the 2 tablespoons of salt and it was just right without it.  I doubled this recipe to fill a 16 oz bottle.  I used balsamic vinegar which makes this extra special.  It seemed like the amount of oregano was excessive but really it is perfect once mixed and poured on the salad.  This dressing mixes and tastes best when the ingredients are allowed to "marry" overnight in the refrigerator.     Finally a wonderful salad dressing that tastes as good as any in an Italian restaurant - we loved it!  Update - Since I doubled the recipe, I used 1 tablespoon garlic salt and one tablespoon garlic powder which really gives this dressing a smooth taste with less saltiness.  After making this quite a few times, adding a bit more sugar will temper down the acidic taste.  I've also been adventurous and added dried, minced onion bits.  Yummy!

To replicate the Zesty Good Seasons mix, add 1 tablespoon dried red and green bell pepper mix (found with the dried spices) plus 1 teaspoon dried red pepper flakes. Also, I suggest omitting the 2 tablespoons salt. You may want to add 1 tablespoon lemon pepper (not lemon pepper salt!) to increase the "zest."

Experiment with balsamic vinegar, fruit juices (orange juice is great with red wine vinegar) and flavored oils.

Side notes: Blend the vinegar and 2 tablespoons mix and let sit for at least 5 minutes before proceeding with the recipe. This helps dissolve the individual spices and herbs.

The water is unnecessary. You only need that with the Good Seasons mix, for goodness knows what chemical reaction to occur.

This dressing will not stay emulsified (mixed) when stored in the refrigerator. Just shake it up well before use.

I make my own Italian dressings most of the time, but I use a ton of italian dressing mix when I cook and it gets very expensive.  This recipe is great.  I have used it for everything from marinading steaks to on popcorn.  I think it is actually more flavorful that the packaged kind.  I have not however tried to make it into dressing though.  The the reviewers that complained about the lack of zestyness I would suggest adding a couple of shakes of red pepper flakes to your dressing.  This should increase the zing.  Hot sauce also works, but you tend to be able to taste it more the the pepper.  I also decreased the salt by half.  I just worried that 2 T was too much.  I was right, the saltiness was perfect for us.  I won't be buying any more packaged italian dressing mix from now on.  Thank you Debby!

I want to add an update to this review...
I recently added this mix to a 50/50 blend of mayo/sour cream to make a veggie dip.  It was great.  I would say it would also be great for chips, or if you thin it with a little milk, it would make a great ranch dressing.  Again - I left out the salt.


This is the best, simplest, most useful & versatile recipe I have found for italian salad dressing on this site.  It is wonderful as is, and I have made it several times with modifications per our taste of the day. I've used olive oil, canola, red wine vinegar, cider vinegar, balsamic and combinations of these. I have also substituted salt-free seasoning (just the cheap kind from Big Lots) for the salt. These changes all work well.  Substituting Marjoram or Savory for the Thyme, celery seed for celery salt, 1/2 garlic powder for the garlic salt also works well. Sometimes I add a squirt or two of spicy brown mustard when mixing in the oil & vinegar.  Thanks for submitting it.

I loved this recipe.  When spooning out the seasoning mix, I felt that I couldn't get an even amount of the granulated seasoning and flaky seasoning.  The next time I make this, I will separate items like sugar, salt, onion powder, pepper, celery salt from items like basil, oregano, parsley, thyme and spoon 1T of each (granulated and flaky).  The great thing about this recipe is it is a versatile Italian season mix.  I spooned out this mix into a cold pasta salad, and I spooned some into a homemade pasta sauce.  You don't have to use this just for salad dressing.  Try it.  Experiment with it.

This is a very good dressing mix. I agree with many other reviewers, though.... I use less salt and either all garlic powder or a mix of galic salt and garlic powder. Like Stephanie, I also prepare this in a Good Season's cruet. I use the lines on the bottle (vinegar, water, oil) and 2 heaping tablespoons of this mix.

I had problems with this recipe, but I was able to make it work for me.  First, it is too salty.  Use garlic powder instead of garlic salt and cut the salt way back (1 tsp. or less).  Second, I had problems with both the dry and liquid ingredients separating.  It's hard to combine the flakes with the granules.  The liquid ingredients wouldn't stay mixed together, so I used an emulsifier that I read about a couple of months ago in Cooks Illustrated.  I came up with this combination: 1 Tbsp. vinegar, 1/2 tsp. each dijon and mayo (the emulsifiers), 1 tsp. flakes from the mix, 1/2 tsp. granules from the mix, slowly drizzle in 3 Tbsp. olive oil while whisking.  This worked brilliantly and the dressing stayed uniform!

This was awesome!  I used extra virgin olive oil in place of canola oil and used only 1 tablespoon of kosher salt.  Excellent.  This will be my 'staple' Italian dressing from now on!

I'll make it again, but cut waaaay back on the salt next time.  I mixed it in an old "Good Seasons" bottle--you know the kind with the little lines on the side for oil, water and vinegar?  I noticed the lines measured up perfectly with the measurements given as long as I add the dressing mix first and then the vinegar, the water and oil (in that order).  That makes it easier for those of you who have those bottles:  no measuring!  Anyway, it was too salty for us even though I used celery seed instead of celery salt.  Maybe cut the salt in half, too?  Just personal taste, otherwise great.

Terrific flavor, I subsitute red vinegar, minimize salt & add parmesan cheese. We use as our Special House Dressing at our sub shop & everyone loves it. One problem, when making 1 gallon jars, the vinegar & oil separate so much (even after blending), we can't pour evenly into smaller shakers. Any suggestions are greatly appreciated! Thanks!

Wow! A great tasting mix where I can control the sodium! This is going to make great gifts this Christmas! Like others, I subbed garlic powder for garlic salt and celery seed for celery salt. I did use the regular salt. I am so happy to find this recipe! Thank you.

Great recipe! Very similar to "Good Seasons" and works great in a pinch! I cut the recipe in half to give it a try and am glad I did. I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt and cut the salt down to 1 tsp. vs. 1 Tbsp. When mixing the dressing I used a good quality balsamic and olive oil vs. canola and added a pinch of crushed red pepper flakes and some grated Parmesan cheese. Overall, very good over mixed greens and I'm sure this would work great on pasta salad.

I needed Italian Dressing for another recipe and did not want to buy anything with unhealthy additives or preservatives.  I am so glad that I found this recipe!  After reading some of the reviews, I decided to substitute celery seed for the celery salt and cut the regular salt to 1 tsp.  Next time I would eliminate the salt entirely, it was a little too salty.  I added in about 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes and after tasting it, decided that it needed a little extra sugar as well.  I used white vinegar this time, with olive oil (since canola oil is genetically modified and we try not to eat GMOs) but next time I would use balsamic vinegar or red wine vinegar.  I also had to leave out the dried parsley since I didn't have any in my pantry.  All in all, I think this is a great recipe and very flexible for future use.  Thank you!

I omitted as much of the salt as possible - used garlic powder rather than salt.  I had only celery salt, so I used that.  One thing I added was a shake or two of dried mustard.  It works as an emulsifier so that the oil and vinegars stay blended. I mixed those together well, then used olive oil, red wine vinegar, and a few shakes of balsamic.   I tossed a portion of that into a head of romaine, about a 1/4 cup each of pepperoni and mozzarella cheese, and a chopped tomato.   We absolutely loved it - tasted like it was from a restaurant. Thanks!

This dressing is on point! I DID use the amount of salt called for in the recipe because I did NOT use garlic salt or celery salt but instead garlic powder and celery seed. I can easily see omitting the 2 tbsp of salt if using the other ingredients as called for.  My husband isn't a big salad lover but he really liked this dressing. I'm not much of an italian dressing fan at all and even I liked this.  I will definitely be using this simple recipe again instead of something out of a bottle.

Very good seasoning recipe that can be adapted according to what you have on hand.  I used garlic poweder for the garlic salt, italian seasoning for the oregano, poultry seasoning for the thyme, splenda for the sugar, and omitted celery salt because I didn't have any.  Also cut down the salt to 1 T. and the oil to 1/2 cup.  I used a mortar and pestle to blend the spices together.  Great dressing for pasta salad and as a dry seasoning for grilled chicken breasts.

Good. I am tired of paying the price for the dressing mix at the store!!  I used garlic powder, dried onion, celery seed 1 1/2 Tbl. salt and rest of ingredients as stated then pulsed it all in my coffee grinder (which I use only for seasonings).

Good basic mix, but try using only 1/2 teaspoon salt and instead of celery salt use celery seed.
This should help those who thought it was way too salty.

Very good!  It lacks the preservaties found in some mixes. However, to reduce the sodium content, I used 1/2 tablespoon garlic powder instead. This reduced the sodium content to 425mg sodium, rather than the 1236mg sodium that AllRecipes had estimated.

I had to start making all my own dressings because I have a sensitivity to soy and most commercial dressings their first ingredient is soybean oil. Anyway this is a great mix and when making the dressing I used 1/4c. of red wine vinegar and 2/3 c. of olive oil, instead of white vinegar and canola. Just personal preference; I used this dressing to make Greek Garbanzo Bean Salad (off this site). It was awesome; thanks Debbie for sharing your recipe!

This is a great base recipe.  I did make a few adjustments:  I used garlic powder and celery seed instead of garlic/celery salt; cut the salt back to about 1.5 tablespoons; used 1.5 tablespoons oregano powder and 1 tablespoon of dried Italian herb mix instead of the thyme, basil, and parsley separately.  When I made the dressing, I added the juice of 1/2 lemon and about 2 tablespoons of Dijon mustard along with the vinegar and oil, and omitted the water.  I let it sit overnight before serving over salad and it was delicious.  I am eager to try it with chicken.  Will definitely be using this as my go-to salad dressing...no more store bought for me!

This ROCKS!  I actually made and used it as a dry seasoning on a beef roast, which turned out great.  Yesterday I decided to use it as a dressing on a cucumber, tomato & onion salad and the entire family enjoyed it.  Thanks for the great recipe Debby!

Ack!  I just made this for Christmas Eve dinner, and it was the saltiest dressing in history!  Thankfully everyone cracked up.  It was so salty that it was funny.  Believe it or not, I actually cut the salt back by a tablespoon. Oh well.  The flavor of the spices was great, but that's where the compliments end.

I loved this dressing mix. I was tired of buying the pre-made mixes from the grocery store and this was perfect. I omitted the celery salt (because I didn't have any) and it was still great. I also used Olive Oil and Apple Cider Vinegar instead of the canola oil and white vinegar that was asked for. I also loved that I used only one serving and made a full pasta salad with it. Perfect!

I am rating the ORIGINAL recipe only 2 stars.. This recipe as it is, contained way too much salt for everyone who has eaten what I made.. Cut the salt down to 1 tsp, or eliminate it completely. Try mixing 1 T. with 1/2 cup sour cream, 1/2 cup mayonnaise, 1 cup shredded cheese (I use Asiago and Mozzerella). Mix well, spread a generous amount on 1/2 in slices of the small loaves of French bread. Place 6 inches under broiler for 3-5 minutes till cheese melts and bread is lightly browned. Watch closely!! Delish!! Great appetizers..

I used extra virgin olive oil because I've been using it in practically everything basil-y lately.  Made myself a little salad with mozzarella balls, cherry tomatoes, fresh basil, some chopped up canned artichoke hearts, slivers of onion, and a bit of green bell pepper.  A sprinkle of parmesan cheese, too.  It was like sex.  This is the perfect dressing. Thank you!

This is the best dressing mix. I was in a pinch and could not run to the store for a bottle of italian dressing. Luckily I had all ingredients on hand. We do not use salt at all, so the salt was eliminated and also used garlic and onion powder, not salt. It was so fresh and delicious. Nothing like bottled dressing. I used it for a pasta salad, added chopped sun-dried tomatoes, salad supreme and a huge clove of elephant garlic. Took it to a gathering and it was devoured. Thank you for this wonder recipe.

This recipe is GREAT! I took others advice and eliminated all but a pinch of salt, and I also added about a tablespoon of parmesan cheese when I mixed up the actual dressing. It turned out delicious! To quote Guy Fieri "You could put it on a flip flop and it would be fabulous!". Thanks so much, this one's a keeper!

My hard to please husband loves this!  (Me too!)  Per some of the other reviews, I used the combo of red wine vinegar and olive oil the first time I mixed this up.  Yesterday, I followed it as written with the white vinegar and canola oil.  It was out of this world.  Debby, thank you SO much for submitting this.  This is a keeper!

I made this a few days ago, because I wanted party wings.  Party wings are buffalo wings, but with a packet of good seasons zesty italian thrown into the buffalo sauce.  It's really different, they're hot wings, but also spicy wings. So, party wings!  At my local market, good seasons is $2.29 a packet.  UNREAL.  So I made this mix.  I did two things with it.  First thing I did was make a salad dressing.  I used balsamic vinegar, and canola oil.  FANTASTIC!  The next thing I did was take 3/4 C of my hot sauce, and add 2 T of my mix.  Put that in a container w/a lid, shook it up, and put it in the fridge.  Two days later, BEST freaking party wings EVAH.  (Add a T butter before you toss your fried wings in this sauce).  Best thing is I STILL have so much mix.  I'm thinking I may take a Tbs to toss w/breadcrumbs and parm or w/cornflake crumbs to make moist baked chicken.  I can use it for a totally different dressing w red wine vinegar, or w/ cider vinegar.  This mix would also be great sprinkled as a seasoning on garlic bread.  Thanks for the recipe.

I just made this mix and my husband loved it. I am not going to buy salad dressings anymore because you don't know what is in them. I didn't use garlic salt but just garlic powder because my husband has high blood pressure. I only used 1 tbs of salt. I used 1/3 cup of olive oil and 1/3 cup of canola oil, I used the white vinegar but also added about 1/4 cup of basalmic vinegar. It is really good and will have this be my go to italian salad dressing!

I made this recipe to go with a recipe needing Italian dressing mix. The seasoning was very easy and quick to make. I used fresh parsley in place of dried because I was all out of the dried and didn't have the option to refill my stock. So becase of using fresh, I just placed all the ingredients and stored in the frig, made really nice that after I had the batch in the frig a week later ;-) As for the spice mix...great. I havent yet made a dressing with it.

Very good, but I think the salt is a bit much. When I make the dry seasoning, I actually remove the salt completely and just add 1/2 teaspoon or so of garlic powder. When I mix the dressing with oil and vinegar, then I add the salt to taste. I also cut the sugar in half.

I also omitted the amount of salt and used sea salt to taste. I used garlic powder, white wine vinegar(3tbs),1/3C extra virgin olive oil and 1/3C peanut oil. Almost forgot, no celery salt.  Let it sit overnight in the fridge and its even better.

Very tasty Italian. Very similar to my fav restaurant dssg that I used to pay $2.50 per bottle. Now I don't have to! I did take the advice of other reviewers...used garlic powder instead of garlic salt, cut the regular salt by have to 1 Tbsp and I also added a few drops of tabasco and a pinch of red pepper flakes. I also used Splenda instead of sugar. It was good when I first made it, but when I had it later that night after it had sat for awhile, WOW! Great flavors.

This is a really neat recipe. We loved it. I might add less salt next time (by half) and add some chopped fresh garlic but other than that, tastes better then the real thing! I wont by the bottled stuff again and I can imagine this would make great gifts! Thanks!!

I haven't made this into a dressing yet but I use this when I am out of the store-bought dry Italian dressing packages and it works great.  I have used this on roast, jerky and potatoes.  We like it and can't tell the difference that I made it on my own.  I don't use Italian dressing over salads often so I'm still debating if I will make this into a salad "dressing" or not. Thanks Debbie.

Delicious but TOO MUCH SALT!!  Instead of garlic salt I used garlic powder.  Instead of celery salt I used celery seed, and I eliminated the 2 TBSP of salt.  Also used olive oil which tasted hearty.

This was very easy and quick to put together. I'm glad I found it cause I needed Italian Dressing for another recipe. I did sub EVOO for the Canola Oil since I didn't have that. I also cut the salt in half. I like salt but even so, 1 T was a bit too much. Next time I'll leave it out altogether.

Love this mix but use less salt!  I used garlic powder (instead of garlic salt) and celery seed (instead of celery salt) since that's all I had.  I also only used 1 Tbsp of salt instead of 2 and I think it turned out great.  If I had garlic salt and celery salt I probably wouldn't add any salt on top of that.

Good once the salt was cut back to 1tsp. The recipe only calls for 8.5 tbsp of incredients so I can't see how you would get 16 servings  out of this. Which is fine but it throws the nutritional value way off. I don't think anyone would used just a 1/2 tbsp of dressing on a salad.

I have used the mix-only in a recipe, & recently twice made up some dressing. The mix only for the recipe worked well. First run of the dressing I made as suggested here & it was too much oil. The second time I followed the Good Seasons packet (1/2 c oil, 1/3 c vinegar & 3 Tbsp water & the packet is ~2 Tbsp).  It was much better just cutting the oil that little bit. No it doesn't taste like Good Seasons, but does it have to?  I used olive oil on the 2nd run, & I'd like to try balsamic vinegar. It's definitely handy having these homemade mixes around. I know exactly what's in it & I can use only what I need. My one complaint is the salt. I'm a saltaholic so that seems sad to say. I made some using the salt blends but with only 1 teaspoon of salt & that was fine, but it's a drastic cut. I also tried tasting the mix side by side w/Good Seasons & it tasted like there was less garlic & more salt.  (It seems wrong when the homemade is saltier than the packaged.) So simply replacing the garlic salt w/garlic powder (w/the 1 tsp salt) might be perfect.  GrandmaRossi, no.  First, the calories are for the mix -  the recipe is a mix, not a dressing.  And even if we include the oil, a tbsp of the dressing would not be "at least" 123.   If the oil is about 2/3 of the total, then *2/3* of that tablespoon of dressing is oil & hence ~80 calories. (That's not considering the sugar but per tbsp of dressing would not be much.)

This is outstanding if you use red wine vinegar instead of white and add 2 teaspoons of honey when reconstituting.

This recipe is so salty it is inedible as written.  The recipe is absolutely delicious when the salt is cut in half and garlic powder is used instead of garlic salt.  Fellow reviewers, please rate recipes as written, before making major modifications.

This is great!  I use garlic powder instead of garlic salt, celery seed instead of celery salt, and cut the salt down to 1 tbs. I needed some dry Italian Dressing Mix for a recipe I was making so I weighed it for that.  It makes a little over an ounce.

We loved this recipe! I used olive oil instead of canola and red wine vinegar instead of white. Also did not have garlic salt and just used garlic powder. Also cut the salt to 1 tablespoon based on other reviews.

Clearly the salt amount listed in the recipe is a typo.  If you think before making it (lol) and drastically reduce the salt, this is actually quite good.  You can always add more salt but you can never take it out, so start with a pinch and increase it to taste.  If you do, I think you will be pleased.

If you don't like it when the dressing separates I have a solution for the problem. Use a stick blender and emulsify the mixture. It looks like creamy Italian but the only difference is the air beaten into the dressing.

I did not feel this was too salty but I do think it had too much thyme, basil, oregano or all.  I also agree that it needs more sugar.  I will alter this one or keep looking.

Pretty good.  Really simple.  I agree about the salt.  I made the first batch exact.  Very salty.  So I made a second batch with garlic powder and no salt.  I put them both together.  and....GREAT!!

Not bad.  I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt and celery seed instead of celery salt.  The white vinegar smells very zesty but it tastes fine.  I might use a different vinegar next time and maybe olive oil instead of canola.

Edit: I have used this time and time again. It is AWESOME! My husband loves it. I make it with balsamic vinegar and olive oil and it goes on absolutely everything. Thank you, thank you!   First Impression: What a great mix! I used balsamic vinegar and olive oil and used this for a grilled chicken marinade -- it came out GREAT.  Can't wait to use this on a salad.

Excellent Italian dressing however I did make a few changes.  Instead of garlic salt I used 1 1/2 tsp garlic powder and 1 tsp minced garlic (dry) and kosher salt instead of table salt.  When mixing the dressing I used 2 T. balsalmic vinegar, 2 T. red wine vinegar, 1/3 cup olive oil and 1/3 cup water.  To that I added 3 T. mix because we like a more zesty Italian dressing.  It's wonderful and I will not be buying Good Seasons Mix again!

This was wonderful!  I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt, and added only 1 Tbl. regular salt instead of 2 Tbl.  I thought those adjustments were perfect.  This is much better if it sits overnight before using.  Thanks for the recipe!

I've made this a few times & am delighted with the result.  I'll no longer buy Good Seasons Mix.  I used my Good Seasons bottle- red wine vinegar, almost up to water line- little water to water line- THREE Tablespoons mix- oil to oil line.  Just 2 Tbsp of mix (as called for) was to bland for me.

This recipe is fabulous!  I used about half the amount of salt it calls for, and found that to be plenty.  Even my picky husband, who never eats any dressing other than Ranch on his salad, loves this Italian dressing.  I can't wait for Christmas as I plan to make this in pretty glass bottles to give to everyone on my list!

This recipe is great.  I substituted half a clove of garlic for the powder and used olive oil.  I also used rice vinegar.  My family loved it and prefers it over the store bought!  The added bonus is that you have everything you need right in your spice rake.

I replaced the salt with season salt, and used different vinegars and oils. I am diabetic so I replaced the sugar with a sugar substitute and it was great! I have a new favorite.

This is a really good recipe! Very quick and easy. I used olive oil and it came out great. I tossed it over cold pasta, added tomatoes, black olives and parmaesan cheese and it was really good. Thank you for a great recipe that can be made at the spur of a moment!

LOVE this mixture!  I screwed up the first time I made it and used kosher salt - bigger crystals than table salt - which is ok if you are using it in something that will dissolve it, but for just sprinkling on things (like on homemade pizza - yum - or subs) it needed to be table salt.  Good recipe.

This is my go to recipe for everything from salads to marinades.  It's so easy to make a big batch and keep it in the cabinet.  Change up the oils and vinegars for totally different tastes.  I decrease the salt in half.

A great recipe, however the Italians have never heard of "Canola" oil. Good Italian olive oil makes this recipe so much better and the Balsamic just adds to it.

Loved this recipe with a few changes.  After reading the reviews regarding "too salty," I changed the above recipe to the following: used garlic powder, instead of garlic salt, used 1/4 tsp celery seed (did not have celery salt) and reduced the 2 tbsp salt, to 1 tsp.  It was perfect. (And I LOVE salty things.)  I'm glad I read the other reviews because I would have had to throw it out, or keep adding multiples of the other ingredients in order to "fix" the too salty mix.  When I got through and mixed up the dressing (per the above instructions, with the water, oil, and vinegar), I went on and made two more batches of the dry mix for future use (especially since I had 10 different ingredient containers out.)  I used my dressing for a fresh home grown tomato and cucumber salad.  Delicious!

This works great!  Once you start making your own fresh dressings, you'll never want to use bottled again!  It's SOOOO easy!  BTW, I mixed 2 Tablespoons of mix with 2 oz. of red wine vinegar, let it sit to absorb flavors; then instead of oil, add a half cup of mayonaise to make a creamy italian!  It was great!  Enjoy!

this is AWESOME!!! I was looking to make some homemade Italian salad dressing to go over my beautiful cheese tortellini pasta salad and this was perfect! I read the other reviews that suggested to cut down on the salt, so I did. I used olive oil, and I only used 1 TBS of sea salt and split the 2 TBS garlic salt wtih granulated garlic. I also added some crushed red pepper flakes, which added some zest and about 1/4 tsp of ground mustard to help the oil and vinegar mix emulsify. Came out nicely

This was delicious, BUT WAYYYYY too much salt! I only used 1 tablespoon as opposed to the 2 it calls for and it was not edible. I'm going to try again with no table salt and do 1/2 tablespoon of garlic salt and 1/2 garlic powder instead. I figure you can always add salt but you can't take it out! Great flavor otherwise though. Someone really needs to edit this recipe!

This stuff is the best ever!  i have never really liked Italian dressing, but i went on a diet and decided to try this stuff to see if i could make it cheaper to be on my diet.  Man, this stuff tastes better than any other dressing i've ever had!  ANd i use the dry mix on croutons i make at home for less than half the price of the store-bought kind.

A good mix to have handy in my pantry.  I also use it for baked chicken, mixing it with parmesan cheese and panko crumbs instead of using Shake and Bake.

This turned out great! The only difference is I halfed the salt and left out the pepper since I react to pepper. Next time I will double this as in two weeks we went through the mix. I mainly used it as a dressing and marinade. It is so easy to prepare, and is best after the it sits for a bit to meld the flavors.

Never used olive oil and vinegar as a dressing before so I didn't enjoy it. I was hoping for something that taste similar to Wishbone's italian dressing

This is WWWWAAAAAAYYYYYY too salty.  I made the recipe as is except cut the 2T of salt to 2t.  It was still too salty.  Maybe leave it out all together or at least reduce to 1t.

Perfect. I can't say how it tastes when making salad dressing but I used it in place of a packet for Slow Cooker Italian Beef for Sandwiches (AR) and it was great, I used the full amount the recipe made. I did use garlic powder instead of garlic salt and cut the salt down to 1 tsp. But that is for family health reasons. Thanks for the recipe!

Decent dressing. I used 1.5 tsps garlic powder instead of onion powder and only 1 tsp of salt. Not bad at all. I used it to marinade my chicken before breading. Easy to make and you get enough dry mix to make about 3.5 batches.

Made as directed except did not add the salt.  Good thing, because it was salty enough for our taste.  Used this recipe as the dry rub for the "after work beef pot roast dinner" from this site.  Great mixture of spices that I already had on hand.  Put all the spices into my portable chopper and ground everything to the same size and to really mix it up.  I save the empty spice containers so I can label it and keep with my other spices.  No more store bought italian dressing for me.  Will try making dressing with it next.  4/3/11.  I finally got around to making it into salad dressing.  Oh my, oh my, oh my.

I used this dry mix to make chicken nuggets... but removed the 2 tablespoon salt and added one teaspoon paprika, threw in 1 cup of wheat flour and coated 3 chunked up chicken breasts... then fried it up in about 3 tablespoons olive oil...  OMG  It was soooooooooo good!

I love homemade mixes that can easily replace those sodium laden commercial products. I used garlic powder and celery seed instead of the salt blends, was out of basil and parsley so I just used a tablespoon of store-bought pizza spice, reduced salt to one tablespoon and added a quarter teaspoon chili flakes. When making the dressing I added a teaspoon of mustard, and used half cider vinegar, half balsamic vinegar. Turned out well, and will be using it in another recipe on AR.

This is a super recipe.  It may seem like a lot of ingredients, but it takes minutes to prepare.  I doubled up to make ~16oz and ran out of canola oil, so ~1/3 is olive oil.  I substituted balsamic vinegar and eased up on the salt, only using about 1 tsp.  I also added 1/4 tsp of Cayenne pepper for a little kick.  It definitely gets better if it sits for a day or so, allowing the dry ingredients to soak and the flavors to blend.

This is a great recipe! I have sent it to my family and friends. I mix it in a cruet with red wine vinegar and olive oil. I didn't have celery salt so I used celery seed, and I used half garlic powder and half garlic salt. I have used it mixed this way on salads, and as a marinade for meat and grilled vegetables. Its great for all these things.

As written this is WAY too salty. If I make it again, I will probably eliminate the 2 T of salt all together. Seriously, I wonder if 2 T of salt maybe isn't a misprint. It is very overwhelming.

I halved this recipe, omitting salt and using Splenda for sugar and added it to 3/4 c. sugar-free tomato juice, 1/4 c. red wine vinegar and 2 t. Splenda (or to taste). This makes a great sugar-free, fat free salad french herb salad dressing.

I was so dissapointed when I first made this.  I used the canola oil as the recipe says and did not like the taste at all.  I made it again using olive oil and it tasted much better.  Good dressing if you're in a pinch.  I will use the leftover dressing made w/ canola oil for a mariade.

Great after I omitted the garlic salt and salt and added 1/2 tablespoon garlic powder instead. Perfect for low sodium diets. I make many low sodium recipes. No one needs that much salt!

This is an excellent dry italian mix (IF YOU LEAVE OUT THE SALT). I almost think the salt on there is a typo. I didn't add any and it was very flavorful. I used this on fresh salad, and in Tangy Dill Potato Salad. Great for both! I'll be keeping this on hand. Thanks!

Is it a typo on the salt?  This was WAY too salty when used as a marinate for chicken (mixed with evoo and chicken broth).  My husband wouldn't even eat it after one taste. And I cooked a whole chicken in it.

I made this to use in the Angel Chicken Pasta from this site. Worked out beautifully. Great recipe! UPDATED: I do not add that much salt. I should have clarified that I used garlic powder and celery salt and cut the salt down to a half tsp. You really don't need all that much.

Fantastic!  Since I used garlic salt and celery salt, I only added an additional 1 Tbsp salt figuring that I could always add more.  I'm glad I didn't add 2 Tbsp, because the 1 was just the right amount.  Also, I didn't have canola oil, so I used olive oil, which I had on hand.  It was absolutely delicious and so easy!  No more store bought Italian dressing for me!!  Thank you for submitting this!

I love it!  I used the recipe exactly and keep the herbs in a baggie on hand in my cupboard for when I need some Italian dressing for a recipe since I never use it on an actual salad (I like my balsamic).  I put a sticker on the baggie saying how much oil, vinegar and herbs to use to whip up a batch whenever needed.

Very good.  Even better when using red wine vinegar and extra virgin olive oil for the liquids.  (I use garlic and  onion powder, cuts down on salt intake). Yum! Will use this recipe again!

I've never found a recipe for italian dressing mix that I liked until this one.  Now, I'm sold.  It is a bit salty, so next time I will probably reduce the salt a bit.  Also, I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt -- with garlic salt I think it'd be even worse.  I like to use a mixture of balsamic vinegar and apple cider vinegar rather than the white vinegar it calls for.

A great Italian dressing--this is better than most brands you can buy.  I cut the salt in half, used red wine vinegar and a mix of vegetable oil and olive oil instead of canola.  Do your body a favor: don't use canola.

I loved this mix. I use it for so many other things than just dressing. Also, I gave this recipe to my sister who is following a Low-Carb diet and she substituted the sugar with Splenda and it still tastes great. I couldn't tell the difference myself. Highly recommend!

Nice mix. I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt as others have mentioned. Turned out good. My husband loved it. I used it on a tomato and cucumber salad. Next time I will try it using olive oil and red wine vinager.I also used my good seasoning container for the mix, worked out well. Thanks for the recipe.

Good recipe. Cut out the garlic salt and replaced with garlic powder. Nice to have on hand. Like the idea of using this as a rub on the turkey. Seems like it could be used on chicken breasts as well.

This was great!!  Easy and good.  I will double or tripple it next time so I have extra on hand. We like it best on pasta salad.  The salt amount is good but needs to be dissolved before use (can heat in microwave for a few secs. then let cool).

Excellent recipe.  I use garlic powder instead of garlic salt and sometimes increase the amount of basil.  It's a good mix to alter according to taste.  I also use olive oil and red wine vinegar when I make the dressing.  This is a great mix to keep on hand.  Thanks, Debby.

Good recipe.   I opted to leave out the celery salt and use red wine vinegar rather than white vinegar.  I also used a little extra garlic salt.

I read the reviews and made the following changes:  NO salt, increased garlic salt to 2 T.  I made the dressing with 5 T. balsamic vinegar, 3 T. water, 4 T. olive oil, and 2 T. mix.  I then used about 1/3 of it to marinate cucumbers, tomatoes, peppers, and onions--wonderful!  Excellent!  DH used it on his salad and said it didn't jump out to him...thus the 4 stars.  Nice mix, though.  I will keep in on hand.

This is a good dressing mix.  I cut the salt to 1 Tbsp. and used half garlic powder/half salt in place of the garlic salt, as I didn't want to buy garlic salt just for this. I also used much less than 2/3 of a cup of oil when mixing up the dressing.  I put everything except oil in a measuring cup and then topped it off to the 2/3 line with the oil, which seemed like just the right amount.

This makes the BEST pasta salad!  The second batch I made, I used some garlic powder instead of garlic salt, as the dressing itself is quite salty, and omitted the celery salt, as I didn't have any.  I'll definately make this again.  Then tonight I put it on some hot spaghetti noodles and added olives and Parmesan cheese and it was excellent again.

I used olive oil instead of veggie oil and omitted the salt after reading the reviews (but next time plan to add the salt as it would allow for an entire extra batch of dressing).  It is SOOOO yummy on my cucumber, tomato, onion salad.  YUM YUM YUM :)  I don't think it tastes "just like" the bottled, but that's a good thing! ;)...a great recipe if you don't want all those added chemicals! :)

We made this at the last minute when we had salad and no Italian dressing and it worked like a dream. I still have a substantial amount leftover in my pantry and use it for seasonings here and there and will use it for dressing when we want Italian. Two thumbs up! Thanks for the last minute salad saver!

What a great idea for the thrifty. Homemade Good Seasons! I used garlic powder instead and left the salt the same. Used Splenda instead of sugar and we loved it!

Great mix of spices.  Per the suggestions, I left out the salt.  The salt from the garlic salt is plenty.  I also added 1 tsp of sugar for better balance.  Overall, great recipe.  Thanks!

The mix of the spices is good but I thought the directions on how to make the actual dressing was nasty. All that oil nearly made me gag. I definitely use the spice mix in recipes but keep looking for a better recipe for an italian dressing.

This recipe was wonderful!!  I am on a low salt low sugar diet, and I substituted the sugar with artificial sweetener, the garlic salt with garlic powder and the celery salt with celery seed.  I omitted the regular salt and the oil altogether and added about a teaspoon of prepared mustard.  I am sure I will use this frequently to flavor up the bland food I am eating!!  Thanks so much!!!

I cook at a large camp and this dressing is great! We have the spices on hand and mixed up so it can be made in a jiffy, nice and fresh. We often use red wine vinegar for a little twist.

This was great! The only thing missing was that ZING you usually get with Italian dressing. I especially like the fact that I can make as much, or as little as I need at a time. Thanks!

I used balsamic vinegar and olive oil with this recipe.  It is great!  I marinate my chicken strips with it and cook them on my George Forman grill.  My family loves this and the chicken is great on a salad, topped with this Italian dressing.  Thanks for the recipe.

We love this salad dressing.  I usually have a bottle of it prepared at all times.  It works great as a dressing or as a marinade.  I have made this several times with different vinegars and oils.  I don't think you can go wrong with this recipe if you are looking for a good Italian salad dressing.

Well Debby, I would unfortunately not rate this well, (although you were well intentioned).  There is waaaaay too much sugar and waaaay too much salt in here.  Salad dressing shouldn't taste sweet unless by fruit for a special dressing.  We are all trying to be healthier so that much salt is not good. And unless you use something to bind it together, it is always going to separate and you will get straight oil on the top and will be forever trying to get the herbs off the bottom.  Add some mustard and beat it up so it emulifies and will stay mixed up.

I mixed this recipe up last night, put 1 tsp. of it into a jar with a bit of white balsamic vinegar and some olive oil. Shook it well, tasted it, and decided it was good. Well, it was delicious on my home grown salad greens topped by my delicious home grown sliced tomatoes which I layered on top of the greens. I dressed the greens and the tomatoes separately before combining. I also added cubes of mozzarella on top. Delicious! Will be using this salad seasoning recipe often!

Not getting the rave reviews on this one. It is way too salty, and bland besides that. Not like any Italian dressing I've ever had. Not like any dressing -period - I've ever had, in a bad way. Spend your efforts elsewhere.

Couldn't use it for even one serving - it was awful.

I have never liked any type of vinaigrette-style dressings. However, I decided to give this one a try based on the rave reviews. I halved the mix recipe and just made a double batch of the actual dressing. I omitted the celery salt since I didn't have any and halved the salt (used himalayan) as others suggested. Also used balsamic vinegar and EVOO. Mixed it up real quick in my vitamix (i hate 'big' pieces of dried spices). oh, i actually used local honey as well instead of sugar. it was pretty good! haven't used in on the salad yet, as I literally just finished making it at 10 PM, but I look forward to giving this a try! I can imagine it would make a pretty good marinade too! :)

Great flavor but if you make too much, and let it sit until you use it again, it gets WAY too salty. Also, having to measure water and canola oil each time was kind of annoying. But, this was the best mix that I've found that was close to storebought. Did not use it as a marinade, but I bet it'd be awesome.
I followed the recipe exactly and the only plan to change next time will be to substitute the garlic salt for garlic powder, omit the 2 teaspoons salt, and just have the celery salt as the salt ingredient.

Oh, so simple and it's always ready when you need the blended spices. I have not only used this mix as a salad dressing, but I use the dry mix for salmon, pork chops, chicken, roasts, etc. as a seasoning. I even use it in my homemade soups. Perfect spice blend. I do omit the salt, however. Great!!

I love this recipe. I actually use it to make Italian beef. I coat the roast in the spice blend, drizzle with a little olive oil and add 1 cup beef stock to the crock pot and let it cook slowly until it falls apart.

I used this in place of a packet of Italian dressing mix in my corn and bean salsa recipe and I wish I would have read the reviews about the salt - it was way too much - other than that I'll definitely be making this up in advance to have on hand again!

I made this today and just had to try it out. I was preparing an Italian Pasta salad for tonights dinner and it required Italian dressing. I didn't have any so I found this recipe. I followed the ingredients exactly but omitted the salt and substituted garlic powder for garlic salt and also onion powder for onion salt and celery seed for celery salt as other reviews suggested. I didn't have any thyme so I added 1/2 tsp Italian Seasoning because that has thyme in it. This was just awesome. I will never buy bottled Italian dressing again. I tested it out and had a salad for lunch and used this dressing. I didn't even need to salt my salad at all. It was perfect. WOW!!! This recipe is a keeper. Thank you for this recipe.

I made this today for grilled chicken salads, using it to marinate the chicken. I don't have garlic salt or celery salt, so subbed garlic powder and double the amt. of celery seed.  And because we find Italian dressing too wimpy, I subbed 1 tbls Mrs. Dash extra spicy for half the salt. Ground it all up in my spice grinder to avoid having the powders separate from the leafy herbs and mixed it using only about half the oil for the marinade. As others suggested, i let it sit for 5 minutes before adding the oil. Yum! I was planning to use a mustard vinaigrette for the salads, but think I'll use this mix instead, with the full amt. of oil. The extra spicy Mas. Dash gave it just the zing we like and with only 1 tbls. salt it is perfect. Thanks for a great recipe!

Not quite the store bought variety, but tasty nonetheless.  Does anyone know what those red pieces are in the store bought variety? I'd like to add those for a bit of color.

I didn't use this as a dressing, but as a seasoning for chicken fajitas according to a recipe on here. Excellent! The mix is very aromatic, and tasted great!

I loved this! I whipped it up in a few minutes and had everything on hand. I tried this dressing in my effort to eliminate GMOs from my diet, and as most dressings have soybean-something in them, I thought I'd make my own. It's seriously much tastier than any bottled dressing I've ever bought - not to mention healthier and cheaper. I used 1/2 olive oil and 1/2 canola (organic).

I've used this dressing mix for my own Italian dressing a number of times.  I cut the salt down to 1 tablespoon which is plenty.  Recently I needed some Italian flavored bread crumbs and only had plain bread crumbs in the pantry so I added this to the plain bread crumbs along with some parmesan/romano blend cheese.  It was really good and will continue making it this way in the future.

WAY too salty as written. Reduce the salt to one Tbs and this Italian dressing mix would be 5*****. We use this mix constantly. I omit the water in my preparation because I find the lettuce tends to have water on it from washing. Thanks Debby

Used on italian beef (on this site) & it was grea t for that! I used garlic salt & celery salt so I felt I did not need to use whole amt of reg salt so I just halfed it. I also added some crushed red pepper. Like I said it was great for what I used it  for. I will try this for dressing too, cant wait! Im sure it will be just as good for that too.  Also will try the dip recipe that another person suggested.

TOO MUCH SALT! I wish I had read the reviews before I mixed all the ingredients together. I used this recipe on a beef roast and made Italian Roast beef sandwiches. My husband and I thought it turned out delicious albeit too salty.

I had to find a recipe for italian dressing to put in another recipe, when I didn't have any and that's where I ran across this recipe when I had all the ingredients to make it. I decided to have a salad using this dressing and it was wonderful. I will never buy store bought italian dressing anymore. This is all I use!

Excellent base for a dressing. I had to cut down on the salt. 1 tbsp + 1 tsp. I used garlic powder. Mixed it with 1/2 cup of oil and 1/4 cup vinegar. Turned out excellent. It is a keeper. Tasted like it was a boughten package mix.

Very good dressing mix. It worked really well as a dressing for a pasta salad that I made. Per the other reviewers, I used garlic powder and celery seed to cut down on the salt.

I made this as a dressing for pasta salad. It was really good! I omitted the sugar, used garlic powder in place of garlic salt, and cut the regular salt down to 1/3 the original amount. I then mixed the seasonings with white wine vinegar and extra virgin olive oil. Much tastier and healthier than bottled!

VERY good! When I mixed the herbs with the vinegar and oil, I used white balsamic, so it made the dressing quite sweet. I will try it with regular vinegar next time just to see what kind of results I get.

Wow this is really good.  I cut back on the salt per other reviews, and mixed it with a new oil that's a blend of olive oil and canola, and we used it on salad.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was ENTIRELY too salty. I forgot to read teh reviews, bad call on my part, which most people suggested eliminating or at least reducing. After making the recipe as is, I simply doubled the other spices to reduce the saltiness and it was perfect!

I am very excited to find this.  I made it just as the recipe stated and it was way to salty.  Though it had a good flavor.  Next time I will not be adding any salt and I think it will taste great.

I Love this!  I have a problem with most bottled Italian dressings as they are WAY too tart for me.  but not only can I control the vinegar but following the recipe with the vinegar to oil ratio it was perfect for me!  I changed just a couple of things.  We try to keep the salt down in our diet, so I used garlic powder in place of garlic salt.  and only about 3/4 tablespoon kosher salt.  everything else I followed exactly.  GREAT recipe thank you for sharing!!

Great recipe. I used it for the Chicken Strogenoff recipe because I didn't have any good seasons.  Made the recipe as is except I did use 2T of salt and 1T of garlic powder.  I never have garlic salt on hand.  Great to have on hand.  Will try it as a dip as others have suggested!

it was pretty tasty.  not what i was expecting but pretty good.  the only thing i noticed was i went off a review below and used olive oil because we didn't have canola oil.  if you use olive oil i think you should add a bit more vinegar or else it's too oily tasting.  but otherwise a nice addition to our condiments :)

This is ok. I am looking for a recipe for Italian dressing that tastes more like the kind you buy and less like oil and vinegar. This isn't it. After a few days in the fridge, it mellowed a bit, but it still wasn't what I wanted it to be. I'll hold on to this recipe, because its the best I've found so far, but its just not quite there.

I could kiss the poster of this recipe! My Sicilian grandfather made a fabulous dressing, and, of course, passed away before truly passing it on.  This is just as good as his dressing, most of the seasonings are the same!  I used canola oil and white wine vinegar and it was outstanding.  My proportions weren't carefully measured and it was still delicious.  I foresee many more salads in my future!  Thank you!

So nice to have this on hand--we use it to season our meats, mix in dips, or sprinkle on bread before baking.  So much cheaper and I love using all these wonderful spices in place of artificial flavors.

Wish I could give this 4.5 stars.  It's a good mix, but wow! it's potent!  I would definitely start out a bit conservative when measuring this out and up the amount to taste.  But overall, a good solid recipe!

I have been using this site for years, but, I've never bothered to rate anything on here...until today. I always use the italian dressing packets from the store, but, they're expensive and I was out. So I decided to give this a try. Not only will it save me a ton of money, but, I will NEVER buy store bought packets again. This was AWESOME!!! I did cut the salt in half because I read other reviews that suggested it, but, wow...I loved this! Thanks so much for sharing!

Thanks Debby! Quick and Easy! Just the way I like it.  My wife loves good Italian dressing and this is one of the best. Do yourself a favor and use only quality ingredients and this turns out even better.  Have a small bottle with a lid ready you'll need it and give it a good shake before serving.

excellent, may be better with less salt.   After making this dressing many times we have decided to not use the salt.

With all the great reviews I was sure this was a winner.  What ruined this for me was the 2 tablespoons oregano, it was just to much in my opinion.

I'm so glad I read the reviews first! I didn't have garlic salt so I used a little less with garlic powder. I used the suggestions of 1TBS salt and also added a dash on ground cayenne.  I used 1.5 TBS of oregano mainly because I ran out. I was afraid it wouldn't taste salty enough or the red pepper would be hot.  this was not the case!  it was wonderful and I can't wait to see what the family thinks tonight!  that is if I can stop myself from dipping veggies in it.  Next time, I may try an olive oil or an apple cider vinegar just to see.

This is DELICIOUS!  I'm making it in a big batch this time so we can use it to marinate chicken in and also have some leftover for our salad.  Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful recipe!

We did add 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes to the Italian Dressing Mix. Added just enough red vinegar to cover the dry mix while, in the meantime, wrangling all the salad fixings that need to be used up. Then I only added maybe 1/8 cup of olive oil (instead of the 2/3 cup canola oil) before shaking it up. The flavor of the spices and the vinegar do all the work. The oil is optional in my opinion.

Wow.  For dried spices this has a LOT of flavor.  Made a pasta salad and divided it in half.  Put this dressing on one and a bottled dressing on the other.  We will not buy bottled again.  This was wonderful!!! I didn't add salt at all because of the celery salt and the garlic salt.  It was absolutely fine w/o the added salt.  I might consider adding a tsp or so, IF we used garlic powder and celery seed instead, but doubt that I would add a TBL.  It was really surprising how flavorful this was.  Thanks for sharing!

I use aged balsamic vinegar or Al Jerez (sherry)vinegar in stead of white vinegar. I also increased the vinegar by 2 tablespoons since the vinegar I'm using is mild flavored. I used extra virgin olive oil instead of canola oil. I use garlic powder instead of garlic salt. I also increased the garlic powder to 1 1/2 tablespoons instead of just 1 tablespoon because I love garlic. I used celery seed instead of celery salt. I use 1 teaspoon salt instead of 2 tablespoons.   To keep the oil from separating after mixing: I first whisk vinegar, herb mixture, along with 1 teaspoon mayonnaise and 1 teaspoon dijon mustard until smooth. Continue whisking and slowly drizzle olive oil until thoroughly combine.

Great knock off recipe. I used Splenda instead of sugar. I also used Olive oil and white Balsamic vinegar to be really Italian. Cut the salt in half.
-Update: Make your own crutons using day-old Italian Puliese bread cut into crutons. Heat 2 T. Olive oil in a frying pan and add two cloves of garlic. Let the garlic cook and season the oil, then remove it. Put your cut bread into pan and brown the bread in the flavored oil adding a sprinkle of this salad dressing mix. After they are browned, you might want to finish them off under a broiler or in a toaster oven to brown them completely. Boun Apettito!

I will probably never buy Italian Dressing again.  This is really good, my husband even liked it.  I did take other reviewers advice and omitted the two tablespoons of salt and it was just right.  Doubt I would have liked it with the additional salt.

Please eliminate the salt from this recipe. I failed to read the reviews before I made it, which is unlike me, but I had to throw this out because it was soooo salty. I could tell the flavor was really good though and I will make it again without the salt.

I use this recipe over and over again! Don't use old spices. I add a dash of xanthan gum to thicken slightly. Use garlic and onion powders instead of salt. A family favorite!

Very good, but cut down that salt big time. Also, I prefer a higher proportion of vinegar to oil. Otherwise I really like this mix. The longer the dressing sits the better it is. I'll be using this dressing often with my tweaks, and yes would be a great seasoning for other than dressing.

Do yourself, and anyone you love a favor and MAKE THIS. It is by far the best I've ever had. I will never buy store bought junk again. This is the real deal. The only modification i could see in the future is to make is spicier for marinades with red pepper flakes or something. But until I can bring myself to deviate from this spectacular original, I will enjoy it as is.

its good without the salt too.  I use pressed garlic and a little chopped onion.  Ommitting the celery salt and plain salt as well still leaves a fantastic dressing mix.  Let it blend over night!

I will never buy a mix again.  I did use the recommended 2 T salt, but used garlic powder and celery seed instead of garlic salt & celery salt.  If using sea salt reduce to 1 T salt.  I will be using this mix for gifts.

Very good!  I scaled back the recipe to 8 servings.  I didn't have garlic salt so I used garlic powder and added the 2 teaspoon of the salt listed in the recipe.  I used this in the Spaghetti Salad I recipe.  It's so nice not to have to buy those expensive italian seasoning grinders anymore!

Great recipe!  I keep the mix around for anytime I need to whip up a nice Italian Dressing...actually, I have some in my cupboard right now.  I did reduce the salt and I added 2 tablespoons of dried, minced chives.  As other reviewers noted, I, also, used garlic powder in place of garlic salt and celery seed in place of celery salt. Also, it's easy to adapt the recipe for use with balsamic vinegar and red wine vinegar. I found using olive oil changed the taste for the worse. Canola oil did give it a better taste (I use Smart Balance which has both olive and canola.) 
As a dressing, it's great for pasta salad and muffalettas.

WOW!  What a versatile recipe.  I liked it for dressing, but...

it is really better on oven fries and roasted veggies.  Just sprinkle dressing mix on veggies and toss with EVOO (Extra Virgin Olive Oil).  For extra quick and easy clean up line your baking pan with no-stick foil first.

I did cut the salt in half.

If you want your potatoes to be extra crispy sprinkle on a little more sugar. (you can't taste it, unless you get crazy with it)

I loved this dressing mix!  I keep it on hand to season other recipes too.  To add a little more zing, I mix it up with some balsamic vinegar.  It works great as a marinade for the grill.

This was great!!!  Cheap, fast, and EASY!  I omitted the salt, and I used regular garlic powder and celery seed.  Even though I didn't have parsley or thyme, I couldn't tell that it was lacking anything.  Tried it out on some carrots and superb!!

I just made this and I was very pleased.  I did however use garlic powder in place of garlic salt  and replaced the celery salt with celery seed. With other reviewers saying that the salt was too much I only added a dash as for some people in my house are on a low salt diet.  This will be my new Italian seasoning mix for everything!

This recipe is great! We use a lot of salad dressing so now I won't have to buy it. I increased the recipe so now if I need dressing I can make it quickly.  The only changes I made were to use olive oil instead of canola and reduce the salt to 1 TBSP.  Thanks for sharing.

Great!  Like others, I substituted garlic powder for the garlic salt, celery seed for the celery salt, and cut the regular salt to a little under 1 tbsp.  I used red wine vinegar and olive oil.  It tasted better after allowing to mellow for a day.  Definately a keeper!

Very good, and an excellent way for quick access to fresh salad dressing. It also makes a great vegetable marinade. I crushed the large leaves in a mortar before adding them to the mix.
Just remember when you are mixing a batch adding more is easier than taking some out - this makes a very "herb-y" dressing.

Just perfect!  I used it in Patty's Pasta Salad and it turned out great!  I used less oil, however, and used more olive juice instead of water.  I had a suggestion to use Balsamic vinegar.  Might work well!

i sort of butchered this recipe--cut in half omitted the celery salt cause i didn't have it and probably used way too much of the dry mix because i didn't measure and it still turned out great.  i made pasta salad and didn't have enough dressing so i whipped this up.  it was great.

I made this for a dinner party for my family and EVERYONE loved it!  I gave the rest of the dry ingredient mix and directions to my mom because she plans on making it today!  There was no dressing left and none of my store bought dressings were touched.  Plus, this is really easy and I had all the spices on hand!

Very yummy!  I am not a fan of italian dressing AT ALL, but had a recipe that called for it.  I figured I would make a small amount of this to "test the waters" and I can definately say it'll be made again and again!!  I can see how this mix would work well for marinades too!  The only thing I changed was to add some crushed red pepper as I like things a bit spicy.  Thanks for the recipe - very easy and much better than the store bought dressings!

Really, really good. I used extra virgin olive oil and white zinfendel vinegar and it turned out superb. I made it because of a pasta dish I make that required bottled Italian dressing - which I've never liked, so I decided to use this home made dressing instead. The difference was awesome, and my pasta salad was so much better. I'll use this recipe in place of all Italian dressings from now on.

YUMMY! I marinaded chicken in this and used it for "Florentine Stuffed Chicken" and it was great! I also made some into a salad dressing, which turned out kind of green (this greatly disturbed my mother) but I still liked it. It is good as a salad dressing and a marinade, but between the two, I personally think it is tastier as a marinade. Thanks for the recipe!!

I've made this several times to marinate my grilled chicken and I think the flavor is fantastic. I like to use apple cider vinegar though, and use minced garlic instead of garlic salt. I've also omitted salt altogether when I made it last, and it still has a wonderful flavor.

I thought this recipe had a lot of ingredients, but liked the sound of it more than others i read.  It turned out fantastic and my family loves it!  The next couple of days it gets even better!  I added some shredded Romano cheese to it and I think it was the cherry on top of the cake!  Thank you for this great recipe!!

I can only rate it as it is written.  Perhaps it might have been good if modified-  too salty and the celery salt is also an issue.

Per the suggestion of other reviewers, I used garlic salt but omitted all but a scant teaspoon of table salt.  I used extra virgin olive oil and I added about 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes.  Since I wanted to use this all immediately in a large pasta salad, I made 1/2 the dry ingredients and mixed them with double the liquid ingredients, which was just about right.  I would have liked to let them marry overnight but didn't have that luxury.  Slightly too much basil to suit me but it was  quite tasty so would recommend this.  Feel free to modify it to suit your taste.  Thanks for sharing!

I quite liked this recipe, but agree that it included much too much salt. I used granulated garlic and only 1 tablespoon of salt instead of what was called for in the recipe. I also added 1/4 teaspoon of chili flakes to give it a bit more zing. I finished up the original batch I made the night before last, and just whipped a double batch to replace it...!

Very Nice! Just like everyone else I eliminated the salt. I also used garlic powder not garlic salt {I don't care for salty taste} I did use the celery salt and I added 1 tablespoon Parmesan. Best made the day before so it all blends together. 

First time I used red wine vinegar, good. Next time I used balsamic - better :)

This is delicious, but I left out all the salt except for 1/2t celery salt. I can't imagine what 2 TBLSP salt would taste like! I also left out the thyme (don't like it dried). I used it for the Artichoke Salad and it was great.

It's OK.  I used far less salt, practically no sugar and it certainly needed pepper.  I would never use canola oil for a salad dressing, but rather peanut, sunflower or olive.

Love it with HALF of the olive oil as a marinade.  

As a salad dressing I prefer it with a bit more sugar.

This is a perfect blend of flavors, with one exception. I used one tablespoon of salt which is really PLENTY. Next time I will omit it altogether. Thanks for a good recipe.

Far too salty, and this was after cutting it down  to 1 1/2 tablespoons. I can't imagine it full strength. 1/2 -1 tablespoon should be plenty. Otherwise, the herbs were wonderfully balanced.

We loved this recipe! We gave up all foods with MSG  So, no longer could we use the popular packaged dressing mix. I was afraid we would not find a replacement. This recipe is even BETTER than what I was buying!! Thank you!!

I made this recipe last week, with a few tips from others when it came to adding and taking away of spices. It tastes exactly like the Zesty Italian Dressing from Good Seasons.

I added 1/2 t cayenne for zip.  One reviewer chose to use Olive oil.  I choose to support the farmers of my country and use only Canola for everything.

I have been looking for a great D.I.Y Italian dressing for a while and I FOUND IT!  This was fabulous.  I followed the recommendations of other reviewers and used only I tablespoon of garlic salt.  I added an additional tablespoon of garlic powder (omitted onion powder, since I didn't have it).  It tasted great immediately after making it; I can only imagine how it will taste tomorrow.  I used this as a dressing for garbanzo salad (also from this site) and I almost ate the whole serving bowl of salad.

Leave the salt out, as some others have suggested, then add to taste... if desired.  But the best way to use the mix is to make what I call an "Italian Balsamic Vinaigrette"  Also subst. Stevia for the sugar, in the recipe.  I prefer the Colavita brand Balsamic Vinager, and Colavita Extra Virgin 1st Press, Cold Press Olive oil.  This is the "Heart Healthy" version.  This is a wonderful dressing for about any salad.

This is an excellent recipe!  Thanks for sharing!  Was making pasta salad for my family, ran out of Italian Dressing and didn't feel like going out to the store again, so I threw this together.  I'm thinking I may never buy pre-made Italian again!

This is the best!! I use all organic seasonings and organic canola oil. I do not add salt. I add 1 tablespoon each of dried red & green peppers. I mix the oregano, thyme, basil, parsley, red & green peppers in a seperate bowl and then the rest in another bowl. Then I added 1 tbsp of each and it seemed more balanced. I do not add water. ITS PERFECT!!!! GMO free as well  :)

So glad I found this recipe. I did not have garlic salt so I used garlic powder. So good to have this on hand. Dont think I will ever buy bottled italian dressing again.  I did not put the salt in until after I tasted it after reading the reviews and since I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt, I did end up adding a little salt.  Very good, this one is a keeper.

I did not care for this dressing at all. Way to much oregano. No zip to it at all, even after I doubled the vinegar. I will be searching still for a good Italian dressing recipe. Very disappointed after reading all of the great reviews.

I like it, but even using garlic powder instead of garlic salt leaves this dressing too salty for our tastes. I'll cut the salt in half the next time.

This is not only the tastiest homemade Italian dressing mix, but it's the easiest thing I've ever made--with ingredients that are all common staples! It's great not only as a dressing, but as a marinade and a rub. I add just a wee bit to different sauces to enliven them--it's my secret ingredient!

Delicious.  I eyeballed all the ingredients and salted to taste and it came out beautifully.  This is definitely worth doing.  I got tired of buying the stuff and it expiring on me or not having any when I needed but now that I know that it can be made with stuff I already have in the pantry, I won't go back to store bought again!

This had a really good flavor!  To me it was similar to the pre-made Italian dressing packets you buy in the store, and this is a much cheaper alternative.  The only thing I would change when I make it next time is to not add as much salt.  It tasted too salty to me, and this was even without adding garlic salt (I used garlic powder).  Otherwise, tasty!

I really like the concept of making the mix ahead of time and keeping it on hand. I did add crushed peppers for some zest. I like making my own dressings to avoid msg and to lower the sodium content. This is also a great marinade for meat or veggies:take two tbls of mix, 1/4 cup of red wine vinegar and 1tsp. of dijon mustard, marinate for at least 2 hours in the fridge. Thank you for the recipe.

I agree that it is too salty for my taste as written and usually substitute garlic salt for the garlic powder and leave out the other salt entirely.  Also, I sometimes leave out the thyme (personal preference).  This makes wonderful dressing with 2 or 3 tablespoons of grated parmesan mixed in with the oil and vinegar too!

I haven't made this into dressing so I can't vouch for how it tastes that way.  But I have used it to cook with.  Let me tell you, it's amazing.  I've used it in chicken dishes, pasta dishes, and today I added some to the homemade pizza dough I made for lunch.  No more buying italian dressing packets for this family.

My husband loves making this. I even bought little bottles for him to store the dressing! :)

*The only things that we did differently was to use Extra Virgin Olive Oil and Rice vinegar because it's what we have on hand.

Fabulous Italian Dressing Mix. I used 2 tsp. of salt and I feel that this dressing had enough flavor. For best results and best taste, prepare 24 ahead of time. Really yummy! I may consider this my "Italian Seasoning" too. Enjoy! :)

Love it. Used celery seeds and garlic instead of the salted veriety and Splenda instead of the sugar. The dry mix alone is great as a spice on cooked vegitables and the dressing itself is great on salads or as a dip (I especially enjoyed it as a dip for plain sliced avocado).

This was very good.  I used red wine vinegar and olive oil.  Maybe a little too salty.....(and I used garlic powder)  Next time I will use one tablespoon of salt.  Also: make sure you don't make this right before use.  Otherwise it will taste like dry herbs.  It needs time for the herbs to absorb the liquid.

The flavor of the mix was ok, but combining it with vinegar and oil didn't turn out so well. I didn't really like the flavor on a salad and I ended up with a congealed mess after 2 days of refrigeration.

This is easy and very yummy. However I didn't read right away that I was premaking a bulk batch of the mix, lol. Neither did my friend when she used the recipe for her raw salsa.   I have Celiac and can't tolerate soy either, so most pre-bought salad dressings are a no go. My friend and I use this ALL. THE. TIME. and always tastes awesome :)  Thank you!

I love this recipe.  Rave reviews from all at the Christmas gathering.  Two changes I made to the original were: half the salt, twice the sugar.  Oh, and I was out of parsley so I just omitted.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe.

I'm not a huge fan of Italian dressing on salad, but I was looking to make some for a grilled Philly-style sandwich like I used to get back home.  So I gave this one a try, implementing a few suggestions by others (half garlic powder / half garlic salt, omitted the regular salt, added 1/2 tsp ground mustard, and used balsamic vinegar).  It was perfect!  Not sure how it is on salad, I'm not the best judge for that, but it was exactly what I was looking for - thanks!

This dry mix is very good. I thinks its great for salads,  but it doesn't really taste like Good Seasonings to me if that is what you really wanted. I did reduce the salt to 1 Tablespoon.

Great recipe for a healthier version of the "Good Seasons" dry mix.  I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt & cut the amount to 2 tsp. +/- with only 1 tsp. of sea salt.  Using 1 & 1/2 TBLS. of the dry mix in the Good Seasons dressing bottle with oil & vinegar (half wine & half baslamic) & it's a hit at our house!

Instead of all the different herbs, I used Spice Islands Tuscan Chicken spice blend.  Any Italian spice/herb blend mix would work in this.  Don't leave out the salt completely, or you will have no depth of flavor.  I reduced the salt to 1 teaspoon. So that the spices and herbs blend together, grind them together with a mortar and pestle.  Works great!  My next batch will be using Spice Islands Pasta and Pizza spice/herb blend (and NO I do not work for SI, it's just what I happend to have on hand).

I have never made my own dressing, but tonight I found my bottle of dressing gone and a pasta salad completely prepped.  This was easy and I had all ingredients on hand.  I added a dash of cayenne and a dash of red pepper flakes for a little kick.  WOW!  I feel like a kitchen goddess!!!

thanks for saving my Memorial Day Dinner. It is the end of the month, and the end of the groceries, and a Holiday. I couldn't make a salad no more lettuce,  couldn't make macaroni salad no more mayo, or coleslaw. I looked in my cupboard, and thought pasta salad, but alas no italian dressing, till I saw this. Made an excellent pasta salad, cut up and used all my left over veggies, and some cheese and salami. It was wonderful, in fact a friend of min loves pasta salad, and took a bunch home with her.

I made it as listed. The herb flavor was great but the previous posters are correct that there is too much salt in it....next time I will cut the 2 TB back to 2 tsp of salt.

This was a great base recipe.  As per other users I reduced salt to 2 tea.  I used red wine vinegar.  No celery salt so I ground up a pinch of celery seed.  Next time I will cut back on the oregano, very overpowering.  My kids helped make this and loved it on salad!

This is a very nice Italian seasoning mix. Pretty salty, so I would opt for granulated garlic rather than garlic salt, and/or maybe reduce the amount of salt called for. It was also pretty heavy on the oil so I would decrease that a bit. Otherwise, great flavor!

Amazing salad dressing.  We didn't have any parsley on hand but it still tasted great.  You only need half the amount of salt.  We will definately make this again.  P.s. This also makes a great marinade for pork or chicken.  Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

This was excellent...exactly what I was looking for.  Light with just the right amount of spices/herbs.  The only change I made was to omit the 2 tablespoons of salt...it didn't need it.  Will not buy bottled Italian again!

GREAT dressing! Per another reviewer, I used Olive Oil in lieu of canola, and Balsamic vinegar in lieu of white vinegar & water.

Perfect! I needed some dried mix for a recipe I was throwing together, and I had everything but the celery salt on hand (I substituted onion salt). It's so much cheaper than buying the pre-mixed stuff. Thanks!

OH! MY! GOODNESS!  I was looking for an emergency substitute for my favorite boxed pasta salad mix.  I will never use that stuff again.  I doubled the recipe (reducing the oil just a bit) and tossed with a pound to tri color pasta.  Best pasta salad we have ever had!  (and we are kinda snobby about pasta salad)

I have abandoned my much loved ranch dressing in favor of this more healthy dressing.  I am trying to avoid preservatives/msg and other junky additives and this is just perfect.  If you use olive oil instead of regular oil, it is even more healthy.  I only use one tablespoon of salt, but other than that, follow the recipe exactly.  Thank you for sharing your recipe!

When made as written it was way too salty.  The second time I made it, I cut the salt back to 1T and subbed garlic powder for the garlic salt.  I also used balsamic vinegar.  I served it to my small group in a tossed salad that accompanied lasagna roll-ups and garlic bread.  There were rave reviews for the dressing.  I will make it again with adjustments.

Like most reviewers, I used garlic powder in place of garlic salt and only 1 T. of added salt.  It was great on a sub sandwich.  The dry mix also works well for seasoning meat.  Very versatile and easy to change a bit for personal taste.

I gave it 5 stars because it is so easy to change it to anything you want. You could store or use this recipe for ever and put it on veggies or pastas.  Leave out the salt, substitute dates for the sugar, substitute the oil with zucchini or 1/2 avocado & 1/4 cup of water or 1/3 c water & 1/3 cashew nuts or your favorite nut. Add more water if it is to thick.  Every ones tastes are different and this is a recipe that can be made to please every one.  Powder the herbs in a vitamix or coffee grinder.  Add small chunks of carrot, celery, green pepper, zucchini or cilantro &parsley to the dressing chopped very small.

I use this recipe for marinating  chicken for the grill. I marinated chicken for around 6 hours in the fridge & the results were better than any grilled chicken I have ever eaten at any restaurant. Used the leftover chicken for salads, sandwiches, etc...thanks so much for this recipe.

Good stuff.  I didn't have any Italian dressing on hand.  I forgot to add the salt and only had celery leaves (not celery salt).  After reading the reviews I guess I lucked out!  Definately didn't need anymore salt.  I think next time I'll make it in advance and give the herbs time to marry.  I made it and used it right away.  It was still good.  Also, I used olive oil.

Awesome!  After noticing all the salt in this recipe I changed the garlic salt to garlic powder and left the measurement the same. I increased the celery salt to about a teaspoon and added less than a tablespoon of seasoning salt.  Really good.

Am I glad I found this one. I needed some Italian dressing and didn't have any. I followed the recipe with the exception of the salt. I didn't have any garlic salt and I only used 1 Tbsp. sea salt. The flavor was perfect. I poured this dressing over chicken thighs, potatoes and carrots before baking them in the oven. Thanks for this recipe.

This is my new favorite dressing!  I used half the recommended salt, but did everything else according to the recipe and really like it.  It's best as a dressing after the flavors have combined a bit in the fridge, but I like to keep this quick mix around the house for last minute marinades.  Thanks for this gem.

This is a wonderful, generic spice mix. I've used it for making potato wedges, baked chicken, and, yes, I've made the dressing too.  I like to make a double batch and keep it in an airtight container for a quick and easy rub.

I agree that this recipe has too much salt.  I will replace the garlic salt with garlic powder and half the amount.  I will replace the celery salt with 1/2 the amount of celery seed - which is very flavorful and will eliminate the regular salt altogether.  I live in the Middle East and cannot find Hidden Valley Italian seasoning mix here so I'm hoping this will be a good substitute.

I really enjoyed this. I thought the recipe asked for way too much oil though. I changed it a bit by using 1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil, 1/4 cup red wine vinegar (and because I like my dressing a little zingy-er, 1/4 cup of white vinegar. I also added a teaspoon of crushed red pepper to my mix just to give it a bit of a kick.

Good in a salad, or to marinate meat with before cooking. Did not have celery salt on hand but it still turned out great. Used garlic powder, and only added 1 Tbsp of salt, and it was perfect. I prefer making the salad with balsamic vinegar and olive oil, leaving out the water. This makes a great seasoning as well.

Like others, I used garlic powder and celery seed instead of salt.  I still thought it was a little bit too salty.  I didn't see anyone else say that, so it just must be our taste.  Nice mixture to have on hand.  I used it over Napa cabbage, slivered, sliced red onions and pickled eggs.  Thanks!

this was great. i didn't have celery salt so i omitted it, used half the regular salt, and used olive oil instead of canola. my garlic salt also had parsley in it (mccormick's) but i still added the parsley the recipe called for as well. it wasn't too much, tasted great.

very tasty.  I ended up adding in a hefty pinch more basil and black pepper as well as a splash of lemon juice once everything was blended up with the oil and vinegar.  I also used fresh minced garlic instead of garlic salt to cut down on the salt content.

This was an excellent dressing!  I used olive oil and red wine vinegar, omitted the salt and added a small amt. of red pepper flakes.  The sugar is a good balance for the acidity.  I'll definitely be making this again.

This went into a marinade mix for chicken.  Since I cannot really rate it on taste (though the marinade came out good, I haven't tasted the dressing by itself), I am rating it on ease.  When I realized I didn't have any Italian dressing for the recipe I wanted to use, I set about making it and found this recipe.  It worked out well because I had all the ingredients on hand.  It was quick, and pretty hard to goof up!

I love this dressing. It does taste like Good Seasons but there's something about it that makes it better. I like to double this recipe and keep the extra in an air-tight container so I always have some on hand. Also, like other reviewers, I cut way down on the salt, considering that when you double up the recipe it calls for a 1/4 cup of it! 
Thanks again.

I made this mix up a few months ago and forgot I still had it. I have been enjoying caesar salads lately but tonight felt like Italian. So convenient to just mix this up in the morning and have homemade dressing on the table for dinner.

I am a fan of the packaged salad dressing, in fact it is the only dressing my 13 yr. old will eat....he is very picky! I made this dressing because I was out of the other and my son said this was better than the packaged and I should make this all the time. So, i would highly recommend this recipe. I also cut down the salt to 1tsp. and used celery seed instead of celery salt. It made a difference. Very good! You will not be disappointed.

Although I love this dressing I am giving it 3 stars because of the amount of salt it calls for.  We used garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  Celery seed instead of celery salt and cut the regular salt to a scant teaspoon.  Other than that followed the recipe.  It is really good this way and not too salty!  Just right!  Thanks for the recipe.  It's a very good dressing!

This is a fantastic recipe that I use time and time again. I knew a girl who worked at East Side Mario's, and she says this recipe tastes exactly like the italian dressing they use. Everyone who tries it loves it.

This took less time to make than it does to walk down the grocery store aisle, pick out a bottle of dressing, and pay for it!  I omitted the celery salt (as I didn't have any) and reduced the salt to 1 T. like everyone else said, and it was perfect.  I will never pay for Italian dressing again!  Thanks so much for the great recipe!

I thought this dressing was very good, and I followed the recipe exactly except for using only 1 tsp of salt. Now I can save a few dollars by making my own Italian dressing.

I accidentally left out the salt. Thank goodness because it was plenty salty without it. I added a little red wine vinegar and in the future would only use red wine and half veg oil and half olive oil and reduce the oregano. It is a fairly close match for Good Seasons but needs some tweeking to get there. Overall very good.

sorry, I didn't like it at all, and I tried twice.  First it was way too salty -and I LOVE salt!  So I cut back to 1 tbs salt and added 1 tbs sugar.  Maybe it's just my preferance but this was very vinegary to me and I was looking to match the Good Seasonings Italian Mix.  I still haven't found anything that good.  Also, the dried spices didn't blend well, and even after a day were rather "tough" in the dressing.  Perhaps fresh or ground spices would be better.
This one's not for me -- I'll keep looking.

I've worked in Italian restaurant and this recipe is right up there with some of the best house dressings I've had. Italian dressing is not supposed to be very tart, and this is just perfect! I am going to bottle the spice ingredients for my friends! Thank you!

great mix, but we would recommend using a bit more vinegar for a stronger kick. This dressing is also best used fresh, as the flavour begins to dissipate overnight.

Very good recipe! If you love salty, leave this recipe alone. If you prefer a little less salt, definitely half the salt or even less. This is a great recipe that you can tweak to your tastes. Works well with a variety of oils and vinegars. Thanks for sharing it!

Fantastic! We decreased the salt to 1 tb and didn't have any onion powder. When we mixed everything up, we also added 2 extra tb of vinegar to give it more of a bite. We tossed this with tomatoes, onions, and feta cheese and ate it all in a wrap. Next time, we are also going to marinate chicken in this and grill it. Oh, the possibilities! I can't say enough about this dressing! I am never buying Italian dressing again!

I really like this recipe because it gives you the oppotunity to always have your italian dressing on hand, and you only have to make a little bit so you don't have to worry about having too much!  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Wayyy too much oregano!  I needed this for a pot roast recipe since I didn’t have the packaged version and it ruined my roast due tue being extremely overpowered by the oregano.  I should have followed my gut, my fault.  I’ll try it again with one teaspoon as opposed to two tablespoons. Hopefully it’ll work out.

This is fantastic!!!! I used the good seasons dressing bottle and red wine vinegar and olive oil, followed the instructions but only used 1 tsp of salt and regular celery seed and garlic powder instead of what is in the recipe and it is fantastic!!! You will not be disappointed!!!

I love this recipe. Since I never have Italian salad dressing on hand and my favorite steak soft taco marinade recipe calls for it, with this recipe I am always ready to go!  I just add a tbs. of chili powder, 2 tbs chopped cilantro and substitute lime juice for the vinegar and I have my marinade.

I didn't have an Italian dressing seasoning packet for a recipe and came across this. Although it took some time to assemble and measure ingredients, it saved me a trip to the grocery store.  My only slight reduction in rating was how salty it was. Instead of garlic salt, I plan to use only 1 tsp of garlic powder to reduce the sodium content.

I made several batches of this mix and used it to marinate 35# of chicken for shish kebobs at a large wedding shower.  I used garlic powder rather than garlic salt and onion salt rather than onion powder. (I made the switch because I was out of the onion powder) It was delicious and received RAVING reviews from everyone.  
The recipe was requested by several people.  One woman requested it because her husband loved it and he doesn't normally like chicken.  I marinated the chicken for 24 hours which made the flavors of all the different spices really soak into the chicken.  I am going to try it with beef next!

This is an excellent Italian dressing. I used balsamic vinegar instead of white vinegar and used extra-virgin olive oil instead of canola oil. I also used Stevia instead of the sugar. This is now my go-to Italian dressing - SO much better than anything bottled!

I made one change...I reduced the sugar by a pinch or two. So really, not even a measurable change! I adore this recipe. It reminds me of the first time I visited Chicago... We went out to eat and I commented that the dressing on my salad was the best Italian I'd ever had. My family looked at me like I was nuts... They said, "hey, you're in Chicago!!" This dressing is just like that was... Perfect, flavorful Italian. I will always keep this mix in my kitchen!!

Great option over store bought. I use this in casseroles  and other dishes calling for dry Italian dressing. I do tweek it to reduce  sodium and sugar. I use 1/2 garlic salt and 1/2. garlic powder for garlic salt and reduce sugar to 1 Tbsp. Work great with Crockpot Chicken Stroganoff by JudiAnn. Thanks for this recipe!

I omit the extra salt and use a variety of vinegars.  Balsamic is especially good. I also try to use 1/2 olive oil instead of all canola oil. This recipe makes a great marinade too!

I have made this several times now. It is perfect! Know what I use it for most of the time? I mix about 2 tablespoons of it with a cup of flour. I dip chicken breasts in eggs that have been beaten and then  coat the egg soaked chicken with my flour and Italian dressing mix. So delicious! I've made it, of course, as the dressing, as well. Even my picky brother in law was won over by this dressing!

Very good, but this recipe must be wrong in saying 2 TABLESPOONS OF SALT!   Per other reviewers suggestions I went to just 1 tablespoon of salt. STILL A little too salty and I LIKE salt more than most! I'm starting to think that perhaps this recipe meant to say 2 TEASPOONS, not tablespoons. I used onion and garlic POWDERS, not salts, although I did use celery salt.  
The flavor is wonderful, but I couldn't give it 5 stars as written because of the salt problem.

I was purchasing a dry mix and adding vinegar, oil and water to it. One day I forgot to purchase it and remembered that my mom made hers from scratch. So why don't I? Well after tasting this, I'll never purchase the packets again. This is so much better. And just as convenient. It seems that the older I get, the more I know that "Mother knows best"!

HOLY SALT! That must have been an error - 2 Tablespoons. It almost ruined my dish I was making.  This could have been five stars easily with ONLY the garlic and celery salt used. It's kind of sad really :) I will make this again & will be very happy WITHOUT 2 T OF SALT! Also, I agree with another reviewer that it would be helpful to separate the dry herbs from the granular items & do 1 T of each so it's an equal mix, otherwise it doesn't mix well when stirred or shaken in the jar.

honestly, not worth the trouble.  When I made it, I let is sit in the refrigerator for a while, but the herbs all still tasted raw and dried.  I thought it was a good way to use up spices in the cupboard, and good in a pinch when no salad dressing at home, but really not worth it.

Very good dressing. I also used the mix in a chex-mix-type recipe, and it was very tasty. Great one to always have on hand! I use garlic powder and celery seed to keep the salt down a bit :)

Followed the original recipe, using balsamic vinegar and olive oil (both the cheapest kind in the store). Tasted great! The oil separated out really fast, though, so I added a little squeeze of brown mustard as an emulsifier. Worked like a charm, and didn't detract from the flavor.

I make this regularly..I use garlic powder instead of garlic salt and reduce the salt to one tablespoon of Himalayan pink salt...also use extra virgin olive oil and wine vinegar to make the dressing...it is wonderful! If we want more salt on our salad we simply grind some on.
I use all organic spices, so what's not to love?

This is a good recipe, but I believe there is a mistake with the amount of vinegar used. The ratio for an oil/vinegar dressing is three parts oil to one part vinegar. Using this information, a serving of six should be 1/3 of 1/4 cup. Not 1/3 cup. If you do that, the recipe is great.

Exceedingly versatile, even if you adjust the amount of salt. I'll definitely revert to this when I want an Italian dressing and a dry packet mix is unavailable.  I added a little more vinegar because I thought the proportion of vinegar to oil was a little low (If I'm not mistaken the classic proportion is about 3 parts oil to 1 part vinegar.)  I used it in a doubled Zesty Southern Pasta and Bean Salad recipe, and it turned out great.

This recipe was very good. I was in a pinch I ran out if Italian dressing for a recipe and I found this online. I left out the celery salt and the thyme because I didn't have them in my spice rack. I kept the salt the same. It tasted great. I haven't used it as a salad dressing but it was a great marinade. I've made it twice already and I am looking forward to trying it with the different vinegars.

I have been using this recipe for many years now.  It's wonderful as a salad dressing, especially on arugula. I also use it in spaghetti sauce, on sandwiches, and even as an olive oil dip with some fresh baguettes. My kids love it, they call it mommy's special seasoning!

This is an outstanding recipe.I wanted a pasta salad to go with dinner but didn't have any of the bottled stuff so I looked here and glad I did. Now I just use this recipe rather than using the bottled stuff! I put everything in my nutri bullet and blend it up in a jiff. Love it!

I make a quarter of the recipe at a time (once tried the full version, and then the remainder of the dry mix turned to stone, even in a closed contained) and mix it right away.  I add a dash of mustard to help with emulsifying, and use more olive oil.  Very good.

I should have read the reviews before I tried it. Everyone was right, it was great but too much salt! I used garlic powder and no celery salt and it was still very salty. I would make this again but with less than half the salt.

This really is a great dressing mix.  I looked it up this morning because I was making the "Zesty Slow Cooker Chicken Barbecue" and I had neither the BBQ sauce nor the Italian Dressing (I made both from scratch and was very pleasantly surprised, as I mention in my review for that).  I mixed up the dry ingredients as stated, and then I tried tarragon vinegar instead of the recommended white vinegar.  This was really tasty.  I can see why it has so many good reviews.  I added some this morning to a Chuck's Famous BBQ Sauce I found elsewhere for the Zesty Slow Cooker Chicken Barbecue, with my own variations on Chuck's sauce--to lessen the sweetness--and I was very happy with the results.  From now on, when I need Italian dressing, I'll just refer to this one.  Oh, I did follow another reviewer's suggestion to leave out the 2 tablespoons of salt.  I agree that it wasn't necessary for my tastes.  Others might prefer it though.  Thanks for posting this recipe.

I love this recipe, I make it all the time, with different kinds of vinegar but my favorite is balsamic.  However, DO NOT use 2 tablespoons of salt!!  That is WAY too much, and I'm pretty fast and loose with the salt shaker. It has to be a mistake. And also, I tried making this with olive oil but it congeals too much in the refrigerator so stick with the canola oil.

I modified a little as I didn't have all the ingredients. I used an Italian herb blend and used red vinegar instead of white and olive oil instead of regular oil...and I squeezed a little lemon juice into it as well. YUMMY! I will use this to dress a cold chicken and potato salad.

I've been using this recipe for years and keep this Italian Dressing Mix in my pantry at all times. I use it to make salad dressing in a pinch, but more than that I season everything from soup to eggs to cream cheese with this mix.  I omit the salt so that I can add it to other recipes that are already salted; I just need to remember to salt the dressing. Thank you for this recipe, Debby!

2 tablespoons of salt!? I wish i followed my instinct,  or at least read the reviews.   I used this recipe dry on a chicken dish and it ruined the dish. Way too salty.

This stuff is nothing less than In Your Face Kick'n It Italian Dressing Mix.  Seriously - outstanding!  Only change was to drop salt to 1 tsp (and I'm glad I did).  Aside from that, made exactly as directed and it ROCKS!

I was in a pinch for some Italian dressing to be used in pasta salad.  I found this recipe and gave it a try to RAVE reviews!!!  It's very light and the the seasonings are perfectly balanced. It DOES make a lot of the seasoning mix but that's great: just store in a jar with a lid or a zipper bag and you'll have dressing in about 2 minutes.  My sister wouldn't leave the house until I gave her the recipe!  Nice work!

I made this recipe exactly as listed except I cut back on the salt after reading several review.  It is wonderful.  I made it again with changes Jillian suggested using olive oil and balsamic and it was horrible.  I don't advise these changes.

Great light dressing.  After making this minus the salt and sugar, I made a double batch and use the seasoning as an Italian seasoning for fish, bread, etc. very versatile.

I used garlic powder and celery seed instead of what was listed and also was out of thyme. I didn't mess with the salt because of not using celery or garlic salt and it was perfect. Will make again.

Made it once so far and changed the quantities so that it made only on serving as we didn't want any to go to waste if we didn't like it.  It was fantastic and I'm kicking myself now!  Should have double it rather than quarter it!

This was phenomenal, I used 1/4c. of balsamic vinegar, 2/3 c. of olive oil, omitted the salt and used Splenda instead of sugar. It was a huge hit at a dinner party.

I really really like this recipe. The first time I made it, I used extra virgin oil in place of canola oil, and we really liked it.  The second time I used again the extra virgin oil, and instead of white vinegar I used balsamic vinegar and it was absolutely fabulous.

Good basic recipe. I made this so I could use it for cooking chicken for the slow cooker chicken stroganoff on this site. First time I did the recipe as it stated and it was too salty. Second time around I omitted the extra 2tbs salt and it was perfect. Will keep this on hand for dressing and cooking.

This is much better than bottled Italian dressing. Only problem is that I just ate a gallon of salad because I kept wanting more dressing.

I just made this tonight, and can't believe how similar it is to the store bought italian dressing packets (I usually go for good seasons myself). I used garlic powder, onion powder and celery seed instead of the salts. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, because I think it might need a little tweaking, the taste is spot on, but there are a lot of dried flaky herbs in this recipe, so it ends up being a really leafy salad dressing, I am going to try and eliminate the parsley (because IMHO it doesn't have much flavor) and maybe reduce the oregano to 1 T and see if that is any better, also the celery seed is a bit iffy to me, I might try and leave that out next time as well. Thanks so much for this recipe, it is awesome!

As said before and before and before in other reviews....way too much salt. Cut salt by half at the least. Try to make dressing beforehand as to give the dry spices a chance to release their flavor. other than that, this recipe is totally a keeper.

I excluded all salt (including using just garlic powder and celery seed) and didn't miss it. What I did miss was tang - I don't think there's enough vinegar in the directions to prepare the dressing, and I think next time I would use red wine vinegar or balsamic instead of plain white. Personal preference, though; I thought the herb mix was good, if a bit heavy on oregano for my taste. It's nice to be able to mix up my own healthy Italian dressing whenever I want!

This is way better than any store bought mix.  I use white wine vinegar and either olive or canola oil.  I've tried it with balsamic vinegar, but it wasn't as good.

I needed Italian Dressing Mix for a roast recipe I was trying and I couldn't find any at the grocery store. I made this with ingredients I already had and it did the trick. No need to buy a pre-made mix again!

Didn't have a pack of this on hand for a recipe... so I used this instead!  It turned out great!  I omitted the salt like everyone else.

I toned a couple of the spices down a bit according to personal taste.  I've tried a lot of homemade italian dressing over the years and this is one of the better ones.

I'd give it 3.5 stars. I found the Oregano to be overpowering for my tastebuds. I'd make this again in a pinch. I'd say it's better used as a dry mix added to a slow cooker dish, as opposed to bottling it for salad.

I needed Italian dressing mix for a recipe, but did not have any on hand.  I found this recipe.  The problem is that the sodium is high.  It can be greatly reduced by using garlic POWDER, celery FLAKES, and either skip the salt or use a salt substitute.  I used those changes, and the result was very tasty.   It is also great because you can customize this to taste.

This mix was great even without celery. When I make my salad, I add parmesan cheese, croutons, and some pickled pepper. Also I didn't add extra salt as suggested by others.

This wonderfully tangy dressing is reminiscent of my favorite house dressing at a local Italian restaurant!  I tried it with red wine vinegar instead of white for a more complex flavor.

Mmmm good and easy!  I did sub out dry ingredients for fresh where I could.  I subbed celery salt for just celery seed and minced fresh garlic for the garlic salt.  I cut the salt back to 1 teaspoon and it was just right for us.  I made a second batch just the same only I omitted the salt and added Parmesan cheese.  This recipe is easily changed up with different oils and vinegars and is a new staple on our table.

Great combination of flavors in this mix. I usually sprinkle the mix directly on my salad, then toss it all otgether with EVOO and vinegar. Adds a nice flavor to the salad greens.

I made this as followed except used equal instead. I put the whole mixture of dry mix with 1/4 cup vinegar and 2/3 c. olive oil. Realized I messed the recipe up before it was finished, therefore, I cannot blame anyone but myself for messing up a perfect recipe. I give it 4 stars because it would have been perfect if I would have read through the whole bottom line. :o)

I really loved the flavor of this dressing. I thought the sweet/savory flavors balanced each other well.
I would use less oil next time.

What a great mixture to keep handy for Italian dressing whenever you crave it.  I modified the recipe by substituting 1 tablespoon of garlic powder for the garlic salt.  I also reduced the salt from 2 tablespoons to 2 teaspoons.  We loved the end result.

Only gave this 4 stars because if I had added the 2T of salt it would have been way to salty. Otherwise this is an excellent recipe, will not be using a store bought dressing again. Replaced white vinegar with red wine vinegar, and used EVOO in place of the canola oil. Also excellent as a dip for bread.

Good recipe! No need for store bought brands anymore. However, I changed things up to my liking. 

Skipped the 2 tablespoons of salt and instead added salt to taste AFTER it was mixed. I use a little less than 2/3 cup OLIVE oil, and use red wine vinegar instead. The dressing becomes a little thicker when cold, so if separation is a problem for you, let it chill thoroughly.

Really good mix of herbs/spices, but I find that it is a more flavorful dressing if you use red wine vinegar or balsamic vinegar instead of the regular white vinegar.  I'll be making this often :)

Tastes great! I use this for slow cooker chicken stroganoff. I reduced servings to 4 and added it directly to the crock pot (less salt and add red pepper).

Very nice mixture.  Used veggie oil, since we had no canola.  Might use olive oil in the future and maybe a flavored vinegar.

Excellent ;) I did cut back on the salt after reading reviews ( using only the garlic salt ) and it's excellent ;) Not buying the store bought stuff ever again ;) Love it ;)

I love this dressing!  I did use a regular vegetable oil and it still turned out great.  It was great as the dressing mixed in with the Floret Pasta Toss recipe also found on allrecipes.  It was also great poured over chicken and baked.  The chicken was so moist and delicious.  I will definitely make this dressing again!

Did find the the herbs and sugar did seperate so didn't get good mix when making.  So as on reviewer suggested maybe they should be mixed together at the last minute.  I won't do this again as I would have to keep them in two jars.

this mix is ok in a pinch.  Usually, I think homemade is better than store bought but this isn't as good as the Good Seasons packet mix.

Perfect! Just what I was looking for! I'm pregnant and I am constantly craving cucumbers in an Italian mix. This was just what I was hoping for. The only thing I did differently was use red wine vinegar but that's just my own personal taste. The mix itself is perfect just the way it is.

This is really good, you can make it for cheap and do it healthy by using Canola oil instead of that soy garbage at the grocery store.  The only problem is this seems to be missing something. I recommend you also cut back on the oregano, it seemed overpowering.

Yup...far too salty.  Substitute one tablespoon garlic powder for garlic salt, delete the two tablespoons of salt completely and add the 1/8 teaspoon of citric acid one reviewer recommended and you have an absolutely perfect Italian Dressing, using only 1 1/2 T. of the mixture to the vinegar/oil/water base.  Individuals can add salt at their discretion...but for those of us with high blood pressure...this would tip us over the edge.  Above changes are still extremely tasty.  Try on Pea Salad!

curlyg, add 2 T mustard (I use Dijon) to ingredients and mix all except oil in an electric blender on medium speed for about 30 seconds. Then pour oil in a thin stream through the feeder opening in the lid while continuing to blend. Keep blending another 30 seconds after all the oil has been added. This will keep the mixture in an emulsion. For the quantity you need, you will, of course, need to do in batches.

This recipe is excellent! The dressing mix tastes a lot better than the prepackaged store kind. It's really great on thinly sliced cucumbers with a little sliced onions.

I used garlic powder for the g. salt, about 50% more sugar, added 1/8 tsp. citric acid, and no salt (I will decide the amount later). I wish I used half the pepper--fresh ground was waaay too spicy! Maybe half the basil. I ground the ingredients a couple pulses in my spice/coffee grinder. Awesome recipe. Dried veggies would be all this is missing!

I wish I had found this years ago! We use a lot of Italian dressing in our house, both for salads and for marinades. It always seems to be on the grocery list! I now keep a jar of this mix on hand, and just whip up a new batch of dressing as needed. It is delicious, economical, and so convenient.  Per other reviewer's suggestions, I did reduce the salt to 1 T., which I think is perfect.

My 13 year old son loves this dressing mix. He is personally offended when the mix is not available. I don't keep celery salt in the house, so I omit it.  Plus, I skip the 2 T of salt.  I have made and enjoyed this with less oregano. It is also delicious with a garlic oil/olive oil mixture instead of garlic salt and canola oil (in this case I add a half tablespoon salt to the mix).  I almost always use olive oil and a different vinegar. I believe it is hard to mess this recipe up because you can play with it and it still turns out wonderfully.

Wow!  Super easy to make with stuff I have in the cabinet!  My only substitutions were garlic powder instead of garlic salt and splenda instead of sugar.  I cannot have MSG so this is a great replacement in recipes whenever they call for an envelope of italian dressing mix.  Which leads me to say that I used it in conjunction with the Balsamic Salad dressing recipe posted here and it was went well!

Great recipe. Not only a good salad dressing but perfect and convenient to have on hand to use in any recipe that call for Italian spices - soups, casseroles, spaghetti sauce, cream sauces, cheese balls, Italian beef, etc. It's all in there! Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

I wanted to comment on this, because after following the recipe I added other dried ingredients that were in my pantry that work well in salad dressings that were not listed on this recipe. To be honest with you, I love this Italian dressing and will no longer buy ready made from the store. Not only are they expensive, but they contain so many unwanted ingredients; some with MSG! Yuck!   As an added perk, I make extra and keep the DRY ingredients in a clean spice jar, so when I need to it for salads or a maranade, I take out as much as I need or to taste. One more thing, use extra virgin olive oil. Its so much better that way! But again, it's up to everyone's taste and preference!

Really good.  My guests loved it.  I did cut the salt in half and used fresh thyme because I had it in my garden.

This mix is amazing! Never again will I buy the commercial mixes or Italian dressing in the bottle.  Aromatic, economical, and above all extremely tasty. Only thing I didn't differently was reduce the salt drastically.  There is enough already in the garlic and celery salt.  Thanks, Debby. Great recipe.

I sub garlic powder for garlic salt, and omit the celery salt... This helps reduce the saltiness. I make HUGE batches of this blend and then just mix in the good season's cruet. Some reviewers have mentioned that you don't need water, but I always add the water  because it helps to tone down the vinegar flavor a little bit. Last night I used balsamic vinegar and extra virgin olive oil.... I added twice the vinegar as it calls for and the result was DELICIOUS! My husband likes this recipe using lime juice instead of vinegar... we also use lime juice, yogurt and this powder as a marinade for chicken!

Good Stuff. I'm not a fan of bottled dressing and this hit the spot - flavoring salads & mending sandwich ingredients together.

Thank you for the best recipe! My husband a little suspicious at time of what I put together, took the store bought Italian seasoning and smelled the two and he said the stuff that I made had a more rich aroma, he now requests that I make the seasoning instead of buying it.

I did reduce the salt but I found this recipe had way too many herbs.  I used organic herbs and when I put it on my salad it was terrible.  I think I kept eating oregano.  My oregano has large pieces so maybe that was the difference.

I *hate* creamy/mayo based dressings, so my options are limited to Oil & Vinegar, Italian dressings. So, I'm always on the hunt for a new way to spice up oil & vinegar. This recipe is perfect! I didn't have the celery salt, and per other suggestions, I omitted the 2 tbsp salt. Thank you for posting it!

This was my first attempt at making my own salad dressing & it turned out pretty well.  I scaled the recipe down to 2 servings (which made about 2 tbs) & that was plenty to cover an entire spinach salad.  I didn't have any celery salt, but other than that made it exactly as directed.  For my personal taste, I think next time I will scale back on the oil a bit & up the vinegar a tad.  All in all, a good dressing and nice because I knew there were no preservatives or anything.  :)

I cut this in half since there's just two of us, and did not have any garlic salt so I subbed garlic powder, skipped the onion powder and thyme (didn't have them) and it came out great! I sprinkled a bit of Parmesan into the finished dressing and used it for Cold Tuna Macaroni Salad (on this site.) Thanks for a quick, simple, delicious recipe!

This is a really nice blend of spices.  I used garlic powder to cut the sodium.  When I lived in Japan, I mixed this blend with sushi vinegar (which is very mild) to make vegetarian fat free salad dressing.  It makes a very good marinade spice, too!!

Very good recipe using things I already had in the house.  I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt and cut way back on the regular salt too.  I used celery seed because that's what I had on hand.  Next time, I may put less oregano because that flavor tended to overpower the rest.  I've used it to make dressing (in a Good Seasons cruet - about 2 TBSP plus oil and vinegar as indicated on the bottle) and for other cooking.  Worked great every time!  Thanks!

This was really good. I took other reviewers advice and cut the salt down to 1 Tablespoon. For us, it needed just a little more zest, so next time we'll add a dash of red pepper. Thanks so much for the submission...this will be a mainstay in our pantry!

This is a great e-z recipe that can be used for many things other than as a salad dressing.  I used Splenda in place of the white sugar, added 1 tbsp garlic powder to the garlic salt, used 1 tsp. lemon-pepper (not salt) in place of black pepper and eliminated the 2 tbsp. salt.  The taste was great - will never buy bottled italian salad dressing anymore.

I run a camp food service ans go through alot of dressing. This was an easy recipe to make a large batch . Also this is great marinade for beef or chicken. It is a little zippy and is great on the grilled meat.

My only complaint is that it is difficult to measure out the finished mix to add to the vinegar/oil mixture. The finer ingredients seem to settle into the bottom of the mix with the other seasonings on top.

This is a good basic recipe.  Not a lot of zIp.  Next time I make I will try using a olive oil and balsamic vinegar like other reviewers suggested.  I cut the salt in half and it was fine.

I was out of store bought Italian dressing mix that I usually use for crockpot Italian chicken, so I tried this.
My kids ate it alright, but I much prefer the store brand taste.  This may not be a fair review because I didn't use it for dressing, but I don't think I would make this again.

this is very good.  I mixed up a batch of mix and then a double batch of dressing.  I used garlic vinegar and some red wine vinegar (ran out of garlic vinegar) and used olive oil.  It worked great as a marinade for the Restaurant-Style Chicken Tenderloins that we grilled.

It was a little difficult to keep the dry ingredients well mixed, but the taste was so good I had to give it the five stars. :)

This is the perfect blend of herbs! I did cut out the salt, and I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt. It turned out great that way. Also, I questioned the amount of oregano, but it is definitely the right amount. I used red wine vinegar and canola oil to mix it up. Great recipe!!! I can't wait to try the dry mix on chicken and in other recipes.

I did not have onion powder, so I added fresh onion instead.  I put all the ingredients in my mini blender with the onion and chopped it until smooth.  Then I marinated thinly sliced red onions and tomatoes in the dressing for about an hour, then mixed it all up with salad greens and grated parmesean.  It was yummy!

I made some small changes too at the advice of other users.The thing about this recipe is that it is very flexiable.You know the ingrediants that you like,dont like or have on hand,so use this recipe as a starting guide line, and add more or less of what you want.I even used a couple sprinkles of roamano cheese and an Italian blends grinder that contains several spices pre mixed in in the bottle.

Fantastic idea and great recipe!  I've gotten tired of paying so much for store-bought dressings, some of them with a lot of high fructose corn syrup.  I was looking for a dressing that is easy enough to whip up before a meal and found this one.  Better yet -- Now I have a delicious mix of herbs and spices that I just need to add a few ingredients to.  As recommended by several reviewers, I reduced the salt by about half and I'm glad I did.  Thanks for the great recipe!   We will be using this often!

I used garlic powder rather than garlic salt, ground celery seed rather than celery salt, and reduced the salt to 1tsp, rather than 2T!  This was just right for us. Used 1/4c white wine vinegar & EVOO. Great to have this on hand.  Thanks, Debby!

I liked this and will make it again, maybe cut down on the salt a little bit. I love salty foods, but yikes! This was pretty salty for me, but not so bad that we didn't eat it. Other than that it had wonderful flavor and is way better than bottled.

Great recipe!  As others suggested, I cut the salt way down-to 1 tsp, and also used garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  I've been trying to get my husband off the chemical laden bottled stuff for years.  I think this will do the trick.

This was okay, but not great.  I used it as a salad dressing base following the measurement instructions on the recipe.  I skipped a lot of the salt per other reviewers.  I had to add at least a tablespoon of sugar to give it more flavor.  It seems to need something, maybe some Dijon mustard in the mix or really good, strong vinegar (I used white per the instructions).  I also thought that the dried herbs were a little obnoxious in the mix, maybe I will run them through the blender next time to get smaller bits or maybe just use less parsley.

Looks good, smells good, tastes good, and saves a couple bucks to boot. Hooray. If I don't watch myself I'll end up sprinkling some of the mix in spaghetti.

This was actually better than I expected. It is more flavorful the longer it sits. I usually use a Good Seasons mix. While the flavor of this recipe is not as strong as the store bought mix it is still great and probably healthier without all the preservatives.

I used this dressing for Greek Veggie Salad, after I realised the one thing I had forgotten to buy for my husband's birthday dinner was the dressing. This was very quick to make up and our guests enjoyed it. I will be using this from now on. Thanks.

This was really good.  We used 1 T plain salt and it was still a little salty, but my husband the picky eater loved it.  The only complaint I have about storing it for later use is that the spices and salts don't mix well so it's hard to know that you're getting 2 T of flavor when you mix it up.  Other than that...very good!

Excellent!  Just like the the expensive bottled stuff, but at a fraction of the cost.  Plus, I like knowing that there are no artifical flavorings, colorings or preservatives.  We'll be keeping lots of this mix on hand.

I used 1 tablespoon of salt as suggested by reviewers. I prefer zesty italian dressing so I added 1/2 tablespoon of pepper flakes and 1 tablespoon of balsamic vinegar but still didn't get the zestiness I wanted.

I changed it a little based on other reviewers advice...I cut the 2 tablespoons of salt to 1 tablespoon and added a pinch of red pepper flakes.  I thought it was very good, but still needs a little bit more to make the flavor stand out.  Also used red wine vinegar because I didn't have white and it was fine.

I was looking for a quick recipe for the dressing and I ran across this and it fit the bill! These are all ingredients everyone should have in their pantry...although I didn't have the celery salt(I will have to add next time)...this was great! I will never get store bought dressing ever again! Thanks for sharing!

Very good!!  The only thing...too much salt.  I just added a tablespoon and I found it was still a little too much.  Next time I'll just add a half a tablespoon.  Yummy!

My family and I found this to be a bit too strong as a dressing, but we marinated chicken in it the next day and it was amazing!  I only marinated for a few hours and the taste was superb.  This will be our BBQ chicken marinade from here on out!

This is a great recipe!  I love having the dry ingredients on hand.  I use this mainly for marinading chicken for grilling and/or pasta salad dressing.  I also used powders instead of salts and didn't have the celery salt.  Red wine vinegar and EVOO (extra virgin olive oil)!  
Keepin' and passin' along...............

This was very good, much better than bottled because you control the ingredients. I used white wine vinegar and olive oil.

Very good and easy to make.  Will be very good on sub sandwiches too.  I used red wine vinegar instead of plain, and olive oil instead of canola.

This recipe is really good! I read the reviews first and decided to reduce the salt by using garlic powder instead of garlic salt and it turned out perfect. I recommend making this as far ahead of time as you can, the dry herbs don’t incorporate very well at first and need to rehydrate some.  I also added about 1/8 tsp of xanthum gum to stabilize and thicken it a little more. The flavor is perfect! No more Good Seasons Italian for me!

The mix was fantastic albeit a bit salty. It was great on my chicken/rice dish, but too salty to make a dip with. My sister is a salt freak and it was too salty for her. But, the flavor was so good we couldn't get enough! I'm going to cut the salt and try it again.

I’ve made this a few times now, I always make the seasoning by the recipe, however I change the oils and vinegar. Maybe it’s just my Italian family’s preference when I was growing up, but we always use extra virgin olive oil, not canola and either tarragon or white balsamic vinegar instead of plain white vinegar. The seasoning is spot on and tastes very similar to my grandmother’s dressing, which unfortunately she never recorded the recipe to.

Original recipe has WAY too much salt. I doubled it and eliminated all salt in the second addition. Much better. I also used half olive oil and half vegetable oil and it added nice fruitiness to the salad dressing..

Okay I listened to other reviews and used garlic powder, celery seed (no salt in any of the spices) and only put 1 T regular salt. So only regular salt in entire recipe. It was perfect. I used this for marinade and basting my meat on the pit. Perfect!

Can't have sugar (allergy), and substituted a bit of Stevia. Really enjoyed the flavor, but yes salty and I cut back a tablespoon. Will only put in maybe a half or quarter next time.  Also, used extra light olive oil.

Better than any store bought salad dressing. Mixed a large batch and use it with the Four Seasons dressing shaker. 
The only thing I have changed is backed off on the regular salt - garlic salt was enough. Plus, easier to adjust for taste later.

Thank you for everyone who said to reduce or eliminate the salt. I had already added it to my bowl but when I saw those comments, I scooped about half of it out and was thankful for it. It was plenty salty Andy would have been way too much. I also added a teaspoon of mustard to help it stay blended/emulsified. It was really good with these changes. I look forward to making it again and saving a bunch of money that I spend on Good Seasons. We eat a lot of salads in our house and also use this for marinades

I like the flavor even better than the packets. And I like that I know the ingredients going into it. 
It makes great bread as well.

My whole family LOVES this dressing, so do I.  The only thing I do differently is I add 1 clove of fresh garlic and mild pepper rings both chopped fine.  I also replaced the 2 TBS. water with the juice from the pepper rings.  FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!!

Love this mix, but I did substitute garlic granules for the garlic salt & added a 1/2 TB of Sriracha sauce for a little zing. Mixed 2 TB of dry mix with 1/2 cup oil , 1/2 cup cider vinegar & 1 oz. of water. If you want to thicken it like the store bought add 1/4 tsp. guar gum or xanthan gum.

As suggested, I made this without the 2 Tablespoons of salt.  This was quite good and definitely a keeper!  I can not imagine putting 2 Tbls of additional salt in this.

Very good salad dressing.  I didn't have the salty components of the ingredients listed so I used the full salt amount. I might reduce it a bit next time but not by a whole lot.  Another reviewer suggested adding 1/2 tsp ea Dijon and Mayo, which I did, and what a great suggestion it was. I like being able to make up salad dressing as I go, rather than having a bottle in the fridge that will sit there for months.

Wish I had read the reviews before I made this, as I agree, it is way too salty.  Very tasty though.  Next time I will eliminate the 2 tablespoons (!) of salt, should be perfect that way.

I will try it again. However, I didn't read the reviews (shame on me) and the salt actually made it inedible.  I will remit the salt completely. I use Italian dressing when making Italian subs. So the salt isn't necessary with the meats used on the sandwich and the vinegar that's added.

I made changes. I omitted the garlic salt and onion salt and only used garlic powder.  After all the dry spices were mixed together with a spice grinder/mill, and the oil,  vinegar and water were added, it had too much of a  salty taste,  so I added a little more water, vinegar and sugar. That seemed to bring the saltiness down to a taste that was more palatable. I was using this mainly as a marinade for cucumbers.

I loved this recipe.  I made it a second time substituting  1/3 cup tuscan olive oil and 1/3 cup canola oil in place of the 2/3 cup canola oil.  That was a real treat.  This is great to have on hand for the summer months and all of those cold pasta and mixed lettuce salads. Enjoy, we sure did!

Waaayyy too salty for me as written, 1 T was just right , with subbed out garlic powder ( a little less than recipe) for garlic salt. My favorite variation adds 1 T balsamic vinegar, red pepper flakes and a good teaspoon of freeze dried shallots. A little fresh lemon juice really good too, if you want more zing. Like this base recipe more than the packet Italian dressing.

This is one of the best Italian dressings I have tasted.  I made the following minor adjustments: reduced the salt to 1/4 teaspoon; I used balsamic vinegar and half olive oil and half canola oil.  I also used a couple tablespoons of the dry seasoning mixture when making chili and it gave it a wonderful flavor.

This recipe did not work out well for me? Not sure what happened but 2 tablespoons of seasoning mixed with the oil & vinegar left me with a lot of dried herbs. The texture was not appealing. To much herbs. Going to try again because I really want this to work!

I thought it was good and like to have it on hand. It isn't the same as the packet. But it makes good dressing especially if you make it ahead and let it sit in the fridge overnight.

This dressing was a hit twice! I really like this fresh, tasty dressing. It's easy to make and as other reviewers noted, even better tasting after a night in the refrigerator. 
I omitted the salt and garlic salt (using only garlic powder), but kept the celery salt. Still good, but found I needed to add about a teaspoon salt after all to make the flavor shine. This is a keeper for my house. Thank you for sharing!

This came out great! I had just about everything on hand but improv is the name of this game! I can see this being super flexible. We used this on sub sandwiches and I was able to easily adjust the quantity so that there wasn't a lot left over. I like that. The subs were better than the takeout "way" and I've got a premade Italian seasoning that I can use in lots of recipes. Thank you!

Very tasty.  Used garlic powder instead of garlic salt.
Use extra virgin olive oil instead of canola.
Made the dry mix and then used a tbs of it with  EVOO and some vinegar and mixed with some mushrooms to bake on the BBQ.  Delicious!

Followed this recipe but omitted celery salt (didn't have it) and replaced suggested oil with olive oil. I added about an 1/8 cup of balsamic vinegar and it was delightful.

This is a good Italian dressing base, however there is WAY too much salt.  Next time I'll cut the salt in half and use garlic powder instead of garlic salt.

Much better than store bought.  Easy peasy too.  I use extra vinegar and less oil for a healthier dressing.  Get lots of compliments on this dressing.

Basic recipe to make a light tasting Italian Dressing. If using garlic salt, I would omit or at least significantly reduce the 2 tbsp salt (think it’s a typo in the recipe…definitely will result in a very salty dressing). I used 1 tbsp garlic powder and about 2 tsp kosher salt. Otherwise, left the other ingredient amounts the same. I followed the author’s directions to prepare the dressing and found it to have too much of a strong vinegar taste. To counter this, I added a little sugar at a time. Definitely would recommend, as with any homemade dressing, to let the dressing sit in the fridge for several hours to let the ingredients meld more—typically overnight is best. Next time I’ll use olive oil and slowly whisk in either balsamic or red wine vinegar…maybe white vinegar again…we’ll see what’s on hand and will omit the water—don’t think there’s really a need for it. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Sooo easy to make and my husband also suggested heating it up in a small sauce pot to bring out the herbs' flavor and aroma!  Absolutely mouthwatering, thank you Debby for sharing this recipe.  It came very handy at a time where a brand name dressing was not available in the fridge but the recipe was simple enough that we already had the ingredients in our spice rack and pantry.  It saved hubby from running to the store and his wallet :D

I make this all the time without the sugar and keep it by the stove in a shaker bottle as a seasoning for cooking.   (Course grind salt helps keep the proportions even when shaking it out.)  It's great in Italian food and especially yummy on roasted grape or cherry tomatoes and onions drizzled with olive oil.  I save old spice bottles and give this as a gift.

Tastes great; did drop off garlic salt and salt; used 1/3 amount of garlic powder in place of garlic salt.  Still enough salt with the celery salt to bring out herb flavors.  Thought if family member likes more salt they can just sprinkle on salad and toss it with the Italian Dressing.

This works great as seasoning a roast chicken. I had a 4 lb bird I wanted to roast tonight. I went to the pantry to make my traditional spice rub for roast chicken and saw these spices already mixed (I made a double recipe last time I mixed them for dressing and put the used portion in an airtight container). I smeared olive oil all over the chicken and sprinkled 2-3 T of the spices all

I eliminated the sugar (yuck!!!)

I also used garlic powder rather than garlic salt and olive oil instead of canola oil.  

Helpful tip: the longer it sits, the stronger the flavor.  If I can, I like to let mine sit for a week.

I've been using this recipe for years, but somehow missed the "2 Tbsp salt" when I copied it into my recipes.  Without it, it's already very salty; I can't imagine adding all that salt to it!  I keep the mix in a small jar.  When the jar's almost empty, I use a funnel to put each ingredient in (NO SALT), then just shake the jar before each use.  On the jar, I have a label with the instructions to mix 1/8 cup of rice vinegar (milder), 1/3 cup of EVOO, 1 Tbsp of mix, and 1 Tbsp of water (half of what's listed).  Perfect for two of us on our big salads.  Again, leave the salt out!  You can always add salt, but can't take it away.  The garlic salt and celery salt are plenty salty enough!

Very good! I just cut back on the salt, subbed celery seed for celery salt. It made a yummy pasta salad with fresh shredded parmesan cheese, roma tomatoes, black olives and pepperoncinis peppers. Pepperoni/salami would be a great addition as well.

Delicious! I made this recipe as listed and loved the saltiness. It's just like the type you'd get at an old school Italian restaurant which is just what I was looking for. Next time I will try adding parmesan and some red and green bell peppers as another reviewer suggested.

This is an excellent substitute for the expensive, packaged dry Italian dressing mix.  I used much less salt, more garlic powder and added a tablespoon of red pepper flakes to recreate the zesty Italian dressing.  My only issue was the fact that it really didn't emulsify well; but it tasted just fine.

Good. This recipe makes 4 batches dressing + and 2 batches fills my dressing cravat. Alterations I made: 1/2d salt to 1Tbl. Garlic Powder instead of Garlic Salt, copped up celery thin and added instead of Celery Salt. Used Balsimic Vinegar and organic extra virgin olive oil. Added 1/2t red pepper. Was yummy and used 1/2 on Italian Chicken bake. ??

Very good - my changes based on what I had in the spice cabinet was the only salt element I added was the regular salt. Celery seed, garlic powder instead of the salted version. Really like making my own Italian dressing it justs seems fresher and tastier than store bought.

Bc some reviews described this dressing as tasty but not zesty, I decided to experiment.    The recipe calls for a dry mix to be made, and then a portion is to be used in making the dressing.   I decided to use the entire dry mix, not 2T.     To my pleasant surprise, I really loved it, and so did my guests.   No one described it as extreme, and one person asked to take home the rest of the dressing.    So, I think I will make it this way in the future, too.

Nice and light! Perfect for summer. Refreshing. I used garlic powder and celery seed. I prefer a slightly sweet dressing rather than a salty one, so I may double the sweetener next time. All in all this is a good dressing, but I'd likely use it more for a marinade. That's just me.  It would be great for chicken or pork. It would also be good on an iceberg, tomato, red onion, and black olive salad. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I cut the onion as I didn't have any, and used garlic powder instead of salt, instead of white vinegar, I used red wine, and used olive oil instead of canola. Delicious.

Pretty Good, but I've tweaked it with good results.  I cut the table salt to 1T as others have suggested.  Also added 1t ground red pepper, 1/2t ground mustard, and sun dried tomatoes ground in a spice grinder, about 4t.  Very close to the over-priced  pouches of Italian dressing mix.

I love this dressing mix, and what I use it for most...  a dry rub on chicken or pork!  I actually have to give my husband credit...  he used it without know what it was meant for and now this is our go to if we are going to barbecue.

I made this recipe a few different ways, & using white wine vinegar with minced garlic & celery flakes instead of garlic & celery salt works best for me.  I crushed the dry ingredients with a mortar & pestle to open up the flavors.  I also tried the mixture with rice vinegar, & it gave the dressing a little sweeter taste with less of a bite.

Super fantastic base for many different dressings.  Thank you so much for  saving my sanity!  We live in Denmark and they just do not sell regular Italian dressing here.  Only fat free???  My husband kept complaining that he missed the taste of Italian dressing, so I would buy many other types but nothing but Italian would satisfy his tastebuds.

We recently found out my husband has both high blood pressure and is diabetic. So I came to AR today in search of home made Italian dressing. I had everything this one called for and decided to try it. I was very pleased with  the flavor, I adjusted to fit for hubby health issues as in 1/4 teaspoon of salt ONLY.  I also had to use garlic powder and ground celery seed instead of with salt. Instead of sugar I used two packets of Stevia in the Raw. He liked it and so did I. I will use if often from now on.

Great recipe when in a pinch or trying to cut out extra "junk" ingredients you find in pre-packaged mixes. I did cut salt down  by subbing garlic salt with 1 1/2 tsp garlic powder and 1 1/2 tsp salt. Also did not use 2 T salt but only 1 tsp. Otherwise rest of ingredients are the same. I have not used this to make dressing, but used it for making Italian beef.

I've become soooo addicted to this. I LOVE IT!  I hear some people saying it's too salty, I subbed with garlic powder cause I didn't have the salted version, and I still added a shake of salt to top it, but I love salty salads with radishes. :)

Reading's fundamental! I messed this recipe up by mixing all the dry ingredients with 1/4 c of white wine vinegar, 2 T water,  and 2/3 c canola oil. I realized what I was doing too late. It turned into a coagulated mess! I decided to keep it to see what I could do with it later. Well... I needed to use 4 T of the coagulated mess rather than 2 T of the dried mixture and the same amount of water with a little bit (a tablespoon or two) less of the vinegar and canola oil. I blended it all up and guess what? It's quite tasty. Talk about fool-proof. Will try the right way next time.

Excellent and flavourful salad dressing.  Way better than anything you buy in the store.  I recommend reading the recipe closely though so you don't make the same mistake that I did.  The recipe is for the dry  seasoning mix.  You only use a portion of it at a time mixed with the oil and vinegar as stated in the recipe. Mi missed that small detail and used all the seasoning mix with the oil and vinegar at first and had to quickly increase the size of my batch.  Other than that detail, you won't be disappointed.

My family loved it. I skipped the sugar so ours had a wonderful zing to it. I used garlic powder instead of  garlic salt and extra virgin olive oil instead of vegetable oil. It was difficult trying to divide up the mixed size dry ingredients so I just estimated how much total dry mix I had and made one big batch. Next time I will make a 1/2 batch.

I used this recipe for another recipe on here "Zesty Slow Cooker BBQ Chicken" as it called for Italian dressing and I can't buy bottled stuff and it came out amazing.

I could drink this stuff!  I, too,  cut down on the salt, add extra water.  So easy to keep on hand, make as we need it.  Definitely a keeper!

I mix this up before I measure out two tablespoons of the mix. Then I use a mortar and pestle to grind the mix very fine, almost a powder. I add the mix to the vinegar and let sit for a few minutes.

Delicious, light tasting dressing.  I omitted the salt and changed the garlic salt out for garlic powder, and was glad I did.  I may reduce the sugar next time as well.  I would probably double the recipe in the future, because this made only enough for two batches and I'd like to keep more on hand.

i used this in Slow Cooker Italian Chicken on this website and it worked beautifully.. i made some modifications based on what i had and what other reviews suggested.. i omitted the salt and sugar.. as you can always salt to taste and we're not into adding sugar in our dishes.. subbed garlic powder for the garlic salt, celery seed for the celery salt, and onion flakes (quadruple the amount) for the onion powder.. i haven't used this recipe to actually make italian dressing yet, but look forward to trying.. ty for saving me a trip to the store!

This seasoning was good but very salty.  I should have read through the reviews first but I was pressed for time.  Thankfully while making it I started to think there was too much salt and cut the plain salt by half.  Unfortunately, still too salty.  I think next time I use this, I will cut out the regular salt completely and possibly cut back on the celery and garlic salts as well.   (This is coming from a salt-lover by the way.)

It's a keeper, used Olive Oil.  Didn't have Garlic Salt, only powder and forgot to add the salt.  Turned out great!  Used it to marinate boneless chicken breast.  Even my very pick grandson ate it.

I reduced the salt to 2 tsp instead of T, and it worked out fine.  I used 2 tablespoons of the mix to replace a packet, and that was fine too.  I probably could have gotten by with a little less even.  I think I'll try to make a bigger batch of this and keep it on hand like other reviewers have mentioned.  Of course, because of the differing densities, this must be stirred at each use to ensure the proper mixture.

I've been making this for probably a year now, omitting the salt as many suggested, and I love it! I didn't realize how much until I came across a few packets of the famous brand and decided to use them up. I didn't read the label, but they must have added pectin or something in their recipe, cause the dressing came out "gloppy", for lack of a better word. I never had a problem with it before, but now I find I prefer this homemade mix. The viscosity level is much better, and we probably use less dressing, too. This is about the only dressing I ever make, so I also love knowing that I have the mix on hand when I need it, and don't have to go and shell out the big bucks for the premade packets.

Delicious! I used one tablespoon of salt  instead of two as recommended in the recipe.  I also used fennel seeds instead of celery salt, which I did not have and the dressing turned out great. This will be a staple in my home.

Based on other reviews, I omitted the 2T of salt.  The recipe makes a very  herb-y Italian dressing.  It is either that or my oregano is particularly pungent.  When I make again, I am going to try to cut back a bit on the oregano to try to balance the flavors a bit more.

I really like this recipe...It is too salty, but I took out the garlic salt and replaced it with garlic powder and used sea salt which resolved it.  This recipe makes a classic Italian dressing that reminds me of my favourites that I had as a kid.    I've made it a couple times now and I tend to leave out the dry parsley and add some fresh finely chopped parsley instead when mixing it up with the oil and vinegar, since I always have fresh parsley in the fridge.  I hit the dry mixture with a small food processor to blend it well before putting it in a container for storage.

Excellent! Do decrease the salt. Add Dijon mustard to aid in emulsifying the dressing - about 1/2 tsp (more if you like the taste of the mustard to be stronger.) This is an old chef trick to emulsify dressing and keep it in suspension longer. You may still need to shake it up if its left to sit for a day but will not seperaste as badly. This draining recipe is versatile and works well in Italian crockpot beef for sandwiches. Thank for sharing!

A good starting place.  I used way less salt and garlic powder instead.  Didn't have celery salt.  Good herb flavor but much better when reconstituted with olive oil and red wine vinegar rather than canola oil/white vinegar.

The only changes I made were use avocado oil instead of canola oil, cut way back on the salt as other reviewers suggested by using only the 2 TBSP of salt, 1/4 tsp of celery seed instead of the celery salt, 1 TBSP of garlic powder instead of garlic salt. I omitted the water. Very good recipe, thanks!

I made this minus the celery salt (I was out of it) and salt.  I mixed the dry ingredients with a teaspoon of dijon horseradish and 2 tablespoons of vinegar as an emulsifier before adding vinegar and oil and it turned out perfect as a pasta salad dressing (I didn't add the water.)   Poured it over pasta, mini pepperoni, sliced black olives, sun dried tomatoes and shredded mozzarella cheese and it was awesome.

My family loves this recipie! I also use garlic powder instead of garlic salt. My only other tweak is to use half sunflower oil and half olive oil and it seems to mix up well with this combination.

Made a double batch, used all dried from my garden ingredients (for the most part) substituted garlic powder for garlic salt, cut back to 1/2 of the salt and used Pink salt, doubled the amount of basil, added 1 TBSP of dried carrot flakes, and 4 TBSP dried red bell pepper, 4TBSP of sun dried tomato, and 4 TBSP dried Parmesan cheese. Used 1 tsp of Dijon Mustard for an emulsifier when mixed with the wet ingredients.  I cup white vinegar 1 tsp balsamic, and 2/3 cup extra virgin Olive oil to 3 TBSP dry ingredients. VERY delicious!

Amazing! my new favourite salad recipe. I agree with the comments, the extra two tbsp of salt aren't needed. I halved that, and even then, didn't need it.

Also, you can make your own garlic (1 to 1) and celery salt (3 salt to 1 celery ratio). This perhaps is why you don't need the extra salt.

I love it!  I don't use the garlic salt, just granulated garlic and use Italian herb mix!  I also add some crushed red pepper, but use the 2 tablespoons of salt!  We just love it!  Change it up by using different vinegars and oils!  So good!

Great flavors! I buzzed it in a food processor which helped the consistency. I  used olive oil instead of canola. I also did not use celery salt, garlic salt or sugar. I substituted those with  celery seed, garlic powder and maple syrup. The 2 tablespoons of salt added at the end was more than sufficient and I like my food salty!

We love this recipe. The only thing I do is use my good old Good Seasons Bottle, fill the lines on the bottle and add the dressing. I do cut back just a bit of the sugar since it seemed a little sweet the first time I made it. Overall great dressing!

I like this quite a bit, but a tad bit too much on the salty side.  Husband said it was too vinegary, but I thought that part was fine.  I do love the convenience of having this on hand whenever I need a quick, not bottled, dressing.

I ran out of Good Seasons, which is a staple in my house. I figured, I have most of the stuff I think ... lets see what I can find, and we found this. 

When we made this, we added just 1/2 the salt called for, but otherwise left the recipe intact. It was glorious! I will experiment with small alterations based on the comments of others, too. 

Alter the spices to your liking, but I will offer this one pro-tip: powderize the mix by GRINDING this up in a coffee grinder (i have a small Mr.Coffee grinder I use for such things). This will help SIGNIFICANTLY with the emulsion of the mix into the oil and vinegar.

Loved this dressing. Better than bottled and you can regulate the salt. i used rice vinegar and just a dash of salt. Very mild and great taste.

Make as-is except DO NOT add the salt. At all. You already add garlic salt and celery salt; that's sufficient. Otherwise, this turned out really great. I also used this when I had a recipe calling for a packet of dry Italian dressing, but didn't have any packets on hand.

I never made homemade Italian dressing and after spending hours making a nice dinner and salad for my family I seen we didn't have any (my boys can be picky mostly my youngest so I was a bit worried) I didn't have celery salt (I ready the reviews there was a few others that didn't use it either. I also didn't use 2 tablespoons of salt. That just seemed way to much. I had to crush the dry mix together some so it would all mix together good. In the end it tastes so much better than the store kind. I should of done this long before now. We use Italian dressing for so many different things. Just a few is toss salad, pasta salad, chicken breast plus much more. I am going to have so much more fun making my own I see I can add stuff and make veggie dip ect. (My very picky son even liked it) I love to cook and will spend hours in the kitchen. I can take an hour dish and spend 4 hours making it. Just like to make it special and add my own special touches to it and play around with tastes.

This was pretty good. I halved the salt, and it was still pretty salty when mixed as a dressing. Next time I may sub garlic powder for the garlic salt and I think that'll make it just right. I used celery seed instead of celery salt because that's what I have. All in all it's a pretty tasty mix, without any extra chemical  that is in the store bought mixes, and it's way cheaper. Thanks for a good recipe!

Wow. Easy and excellent. Like other posters, I used garlic powder and, because we had it, dried celery leaves instead of celery salt. Then, I did add the two tablespoons of salt. I also used olive oil vs. canola, just for preference. But, very easy and nice authentic taste. Thank you!

This is a very good dressing and I like the fact that I can mix the dry mix and make the dressing as needed. I agree with others who said it was too salty as is, so I used less salt. But other than that, this is my go to marinade for lamb or as a salad dressing.

LOVE this mix! We have experimented with different vinegars and it makes it taste a bit different each time.  Red wine vinegar is the current favorite.  Sprinkle a bit of the dry mix on chicken breasts and bake is awesome too!

Great base recipe. I omitted the salt and sugar, and reduced the oregano by 1/2.  I use red wine vinegar, olive oil and honey.  I mix a large batch and keep in a spice container bottle.  This makes is convenient to make multiple small batches of the dressing.  My husband loved it and guests rave over it.  I made it once with mayo but prefer the vinegar/oil mixture.

Thank you for this excellent recipe!  No more packaged dressing mixes with questionable ingredients for us.  I keep a container of the mix in the cupboard to mix up quickly when needed, and use the bottle I have from another mix company to measure the liquids.  As noted by others, eliminate salt if using garlic salt, and I highly recommend adding other spices you may like, such as red pepper flake, chipotle pepper mix, or lemon peel.

A pregnancy craving for Italian dressing over pasta led me here.. I've had this craving a lot and I've run out.
 I surprisingly had everything on hand (thanks to my spices collector husband) except for the celery salt, I wasn't sure how important it would be, but it turns out it was great without it! I also added some freshly minced garlic, for me. Just the powdered garlic salt just wasn't cutting it. ;) 
I loved this and I will certainly be making it more often! Much cheaper than buying it already made at the store, too! :D

This is a really good recipe that can be adjusted to fit your tastes. My only changes were less salt and I used balsamic vinegar instead of white. I love this on pasta salads.

I follow this recipe exactly as written and use my Good Seasons bottle.  Love this recipe - easy to make and tastes great.  I combine all ingredients the day before I use it to get the best flavors.  This is much better than buying the little spice packets at the grocery store - who knows what kind of preservatives and other additives are in there. Thank you for sharing, Debby.

I used the basic recipe and cut it down for a single batch of dressing.  I used fresh garlic and onion.  I also added the oil slowly while blending with a stick blender to make a creamy version.  It was very good, by son and daughter in law both thought it was pretty good also.  I think I will make a batch of the mix to have on hand.

Very good flavor but a bit salty as is for my taste. Next time I would just use garlic and celery seed rather than the salts. Thanks for sharing.

So good and just like the Good Seasons packets that you can buy.  I use this to make dressing but also it is great to marinate meat and as a rub.  Great to add in soups too.   Make a big batch and give in mason jars as a nice homemade gift.

This worked great as a substitute for Good Seasons dressing in a pasta salad recipe I use. However, I did modify the recipe per other reviewers (omitted the salt), so that's why I'm giving it 4 stars. Otherwise it was great!

I omitted the salt and still thought it was too salty. I'm saving the recipe, but I'll use straight garlic powder instead of garlic salt next time.

Just made this tonight MINUS the salt (used celery salt).  Big fan of Good Seasons for years, found this and am now a complete CONVERT!  This is delicious . . . Now, if only I could magically whip up some fresh greens and tomatoes to put it on!  Love all comments re different ideas for use.  Absolutely going to try this as marinade on some BBQ chicken and egg plant.  Thank you sooo. Much!

Just all right for me. I thought the mix is okay but the proportions for the final product are way too much oil to not enough herb, in my opinion.

This recipe is pure genious.  I usually double or triple it.  It makes making homemade dressing so much easier and less intimidating.  Like some others I use less salt and sub in olive oil.  I make it a little different every time and everyone likes it.

Excellent!  A lot cheaper than purchasing Good Seasons dry mix!  Very nice mix of herbs and seasonings.  I added a bit of garlic salt and reduced the plain salt to 1 tablespoon.  Thank you for sharing!

I was very happy to find this recipe.  I made just as directed and thought it was great.  I have not used it to make dressing for salad.

This wasn't awesome, but I wound up liking it a lot. I've been buying various bottled Italian dressings for years, mainly out of laziness, and had never thought of looking for a mix recipe like this. I made this exactly as written - for the "dried thyme" I used thyme leaves instead of ground thyme, as I find both sold at my grocery store, and for the salt I used a sea salt.
The bottled dressings I was used to have some kind of thickener, so I found this dressing, as prepared, unusually liquid, so after the first batch (2 tablespoons of dry mix, prepared per step 2), I omitted the 2 T. of water in subsequent batches, and liked the results a little better. The dressing is a bit salty, but I got used to it, and the flavors are not overwhelming, but pretty nice anyway. This is quite useful to have on hand for salads, and I may just make it again.

I made this to use as a substitute for a packet of Good Seasons. I read the reviews after mixing all the dry ingredients in a bowl, and used some to season some chicken breasts before baking. To salvage the blend from being overly salty, I poured the rest of the batch through a FINE MESH colander. This easily removed the salts and sugar. I will keep this salt/sugar combo, to adjust the saltiness to my liking when I use it again. What was left in the colander was only the flakes of herbs. Made a test-sized portion of the dressing using only the dry herb blend, and oil and vinegar per the original instructions. After allowing it to sit awhile to reconstitute the dry herbs, I added less than 1/8 tsp.of the salt/sugar mix to the dressing, and found the flavor to be very satisfactory.

I am rating this recipe as the recipe is given.  It is so salty that it is inedible.  It has got to be typo...maybe it is supposed to say 2 tsp of salt?  But even that would be too much.  Like others, I eliminated the salt and it is actually quite good, even for my picky Italian husband.

I love love love this recipe! It is my favorite homemade dressing i have ever made! If you like  Italian Dressing you are sure to love this recipe! Sometimes it is a little bit strong for little kids so maybe you would want to dilute it a little bit for them. To make it a little bit healthier instead of using Canola oil i use olive oil and instead of white sugar i use sucanat. i also use apple cider vinegar instead of white vinegar. and i leave out the celery salt because i don't have any normally and it still tastes really good!

This is the best homemade Italian dressing mix. You can easily vary the amount of water, oil, & vinegar to change the consistency.

I'm very happy with this mix and added my own ground dried tomatoes as well as ground vegetable soup mix found in the bulk foods section at Winco.  I let it sit for at least an hour in the fridge and am looking forward to making some homemade Suddenly Salad with an extra sprinkle or two of the seasoning mix.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe!!  P.S.  I added a photo of my vintage Good Seasons jar!

Leave out the 2 Tablespoons salt and this goes instantly to five stars! But between the salt called for, the garlic salt and the celery salt, this is waaaayyy too salty (even for a salt love, like me!). Leave it out (the salt in the garlic and celery will be plenty) and this is the best mix ever! I use it in many dishes and have made it into a dressing using EVOO (instead of canola oil) and it was delicious!!

I added 1/4 more cup of vinega, 1/4 more cup+2 T. sugar, 1/4 more cup  water for the 2 T. mix.  I also use EVOO instead and blend it up with a stick mixer.

I agree with other reviewers that this is too salty (and I'm a salt lover), so will reduce salt next time.  I also had trouble getting the right proportion of light, flaky spices to salt and sugar with each spoonful when making the dressing.  I will experiment with leaving heavy ingredients out of the mix, and adding when making the dressing.  That said, this is a good substitute for the expensive dressing packets!

Well...  This Dressing just rocks!  We used to buy Newmans Own and while I still love that dressing, I think this one is even better.  The cost savings alone makes it worth it.

I found this and decided to try it one night that I was craving Italian dressing and didn't have any. I didn't have any because I usually don't even like it. The other thing is that when I was making this I did not have any onion powder - which really bummed me out! I otherwise followed the recipe and the entire thing turned out GREAT! I don't think I will ever buy Italian Dressing in the store again! This was just wonderful. I try to maintain the lowest sodium diet as possible so I did not include the salts, and just stuck to the powders of the various ingredients. I relied on the vinegar for the punch rather than the salt. Just...so nice. Thank you!

This is my go to recipe for all my Italian dressing needs.  I find it to be the perfect blend.  The only thing I change is I do 1/3 cup canola oil and 1/3 cup olive oil and for the salt I use a mix of pink Himalayan sea salt and French sel gris (grey salt) because it really kicks up the flavor.  A wonderful recipe for salads, pasta salads, and so much more!

Glad I only added a sprinkling of sea salt because it would not be edible with it! It tastes great! but a little too salty. I would use garlic powder next time. was missing two ingredients. Still tasty. I used virgin olive oil and apple cider vinegar. I added a teaspoon of sugar.

We loved it.  But I did omit the salt as other reviewers suggested.  I am not a big fan of dried parsley so I  omitted that also.  Looking forward to having this salad dressing in my fridge for salads and for marinates. Great to have a spice mix ready when I need it.  Will be experimenting with different oils and vinegars.  Thanks for a great recipe.

FABULOUS!! I have never made my own dressing before and this was super easy and oh so good. I have been trying to watch my sodium I left out the salt, used garlic powder, and celery seed ground up. Only changes that I made and this tastes so much better than my store bought dressing.

Used this as a substitute for the Zesty Italian Dressing mix packet for a crock pot chicken meal. Too salty. Ruined my whole meal. Next time will just go to store for a packet of dressing mix. Was not worth wasting almost two pounds of a meal.

The seasonings in this dressing are spot on!  I thought it seemed like a lot of salt to me, but made the dressing up exactly as written and it is absolutely perfect!  Better than any bottled Italian Dressing I've ever had.  I can hardly wait to try it out as a marinade!

A very tasty recipe.  I used only 1 tbsp RealSalt and celery seed.   Used 1/8 cup red wine vinegar and 1/8 cup red cooking wine to reduce the acidic bite.  Increased water to 1/4 cup and used 1/2 cup garlic grapeseed oil.

I just made this recipe and it is delicious.  Following the other suggestions, I used 1/2 of the salt and it came out fine.  Instead of sugar (low carb dieter), I used an artificial sweetner.  I'm going to let all of the spices mix and have a delicious (and healthy) salad tonight!  I don't miss the preservatives at all.

I was so happy when I found this recipe. I make it fairly often. The only changes I make are using canola oil instead of olive as I'm allergic, and celery seed instead of celery salt. I tried toning down the salt as some of the reviews have said but I didn't find it tasted enough like Italian dressing. I'm interested in how it would be as a marinade, though.

This is a good recipe if you use a FRACTION of the salt listed.  I made it the first time without reading the reviews and had to throw it out.

We love this recipe! I cut back on the oil when I make it a dressing or marinade, just use 1/2 cup, because we like it a little tangy-ier. But we put this on everything.  We even left out the sugar when we were doing a sugar detox diet, this became our staple seasonings.

Used a Val Di Mazara extra virgin olive oil(Italian), cut the salt and sugar in half. It is the best salad dressing I have ever had.

It's really good.  I followed the suggestions of others and about the sodium content, so here's my version: garlic powder instead of garlic salt, celery seed instead of celery salt, and just 1 tablespoon of kosher salt.  For the dressing, I used balsamic vinegar instead (for preference).  Then, I added 1/8 teaspoon of salt; otherwise, it was kinda bland.  Thank you so much for sharing your recipe!

Great base for an Italian dressing. I omitted the salt per suggestion of other reviewers, and also used extra virgin olive oil instead of canola, which gave it a great tanginess. If you're worried about zest, maybe use balsamic vinegar instead of white, or add some red pepper as others have suggested. This mix works well because with a little imagination, you can make it completely your own.

Great mix!  Did not have parsley but it turned out fine.  Substituted Splenda for white sugar and olive oil for canola oil.  I did not use as much salt; maybe under a tablespoon.  I also used garlic powder and celery seed to further reduce the salt.  It was a hit over my pasta salad!

Thank you soooo much!!  I have always loved Good Seasons, but in the last few years it seems they have added garlic....which I can't tolerate!!  Also I don't like a lot of salt, and I definitely don't like paying through the nose for a lot of preservatives!!  It just doesn't taste good to me anymore......but this does!!!!!!!!

I just made this and I must admit it is pretty good. This coming from a person who is not fond of dressings. I did change a couple things..used garlic powder instead of salt..added some minced garlic and onions...instead regular white vinegar I used white wine vinegar with a splash of lemon juice and used hemp seed oil instead of canola.

I had an onion powder malfunction (lumps in the bottle of onion powder).  So I threw all of the dry ingredients into our mini chopper and it was great!!!  Everything was chopped and mixed perfectly.  I doubled this recipe, used most of it on the garden pasta salad recipe on this website and bottled the rest.  We used to buy bottles of salad dressing from an italian restaurant chain (O.G.) but this I'd have to say is just as good or better!!! Glad I kept the bottles from the O.G. salad dressing we used in the past :-)

Nice restaurant style dressing. I made it healthier by using raw sugar and a little bit of splenda. I also supplemented the canola oil with grapeseed oil. I threw all the ingredients in the blender, increased the water and oil. Perfect amount of oregano. I also increased the basil and parsley...I didn't use thyme because I hate dried thyme. Very nice tasting

Absolutely loved this dressing!  Makes a delicious pasta salad.  I doubled the the seasoning mix added to the wet ingredients and it disappeared quickly from the 4th of July BBQ.  Have used it several times since and never regretted it.  Always comes out perfect.

Used garlic powder instead of garlic salt. Reduced the salt by half and used Ideal sugar substitute instead of sugar. I made this into a dressing tonight and liked it.....it was good....but I think I like good seasons better for some reason. I will use and incorporate the rest into some sort of recipe , soup or sauce. Thanks.

I decided to make some italian beef but didn't have the mix the recipe called for. So, I stirred some of this up. It was a life saver, thanks. But, the meat ended up really salty. I will use this recipe again, but next time I will definitely CUT THE SALT IN 1/2.

This recipe is great - I made just as directed and put all the spices in a jar with a label indicating how to make the dressing - I used olive oil.  I even sprinkled some of the mix into scrambled eggs - delicious - even on top of bread, spread with a bit of olive oil and broiled - thanks much for the best dressing mix - no more bottles for me.

This is very good except it is too salty. I just made a batch but I used red wine vinegar and grapeseed oil. Very tasty but next time I made a batch I am going to omit the salt.

This is absolutely perfect. I live in a house with multiple food allergies and it is hard to find good allergy free salad dressings...I do agree with some of the other reviewers, the salt is off the charts in this recipe. I use 2 tsp of salt, not 2 Tbls. It comes out perfect everytime!

too much salt... seems to seperate so perhaps you are supposed to pour off of the top.  The recipe calls for 2 tablespoons of salt... wow!

Very good , but I dont understand how it has only 8 calories....a tbs of canola oil has 123 calories...so if I use a tbs of this dressing it has at least that right?

I made this yesterday and served it over pasta it was great, because I'm allergic to MSG it's hard to find dressings that are made without it, there a  few but I won't ever buy an Italian one again.

I made this with the suggestions from other users - no salt, 1/8 tsp of red pepper - to make a dressing for a pasta salad.  Delicious! I will definitely keep this mix on hand from now on.

I made this seasoning mix specifically for a fajita recipe (Fabulous Fajitas) that is also from this site. It works great. I haven't tried it for anything else yet but I hope to in the future.

I made this mix weeks ago, and whipped the actual dressing up one night, popped it in the fridge and totally forgot about it until just now. 2 weeks later. It was amazing flavor!!! I suggest possibly straining it if you don't like on the herbs sticking to your teeth etc. But with that little thing, It is absolutely perfect.

This would probably be good if it wasn't SO salty!  I didn't add the celery salt since I don't have any (thank God) as there is already so much salt.  Now I have a jar of this mix.  If I ever use it up and am tempted to try this recipe again, I'll only add 2 teaspoons of salt and use garlic powder instead of garlic salt.

I made the Italian beef with this as the dressing mix it was perfect.  I used some frozen smoked brisket and just threw it in the crockpot.  I don't think that I have ever eaten beter leftovers in my life.

I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt and it came out wonderful.  I use this for cooking and dressing; much better than the expensive Good Seasons mix.

GREAT! How many times have I looked at a recipe and it called for dry Italian Salad Dressing mix and I didn't have any.  I just made this up to fix the Slow Cooker Chicken Stroganoff and will definitely keep on hand. Thanks for sharing!

Too salty! And that's after I skipped the salt and used celery seed instead of celery salt. Next time I would use skip the salt altogether by using garlic powder and celery seed instead of their salty cousins. I whipped this up to use in another recipe that called for an Italian dressing packet and it worked great aside from the salt issue. I will try it as salad dressing sometime too.

Like everyone else, I was out of Good Seasons so looked on this site real quick for something close. My wife and I like it even better. Next time I will make and let sit over night. Great recipe!

I love this Italian dressing. I didn't add the extra salt, you have enough with the garlic salt.  I do put in a touch of balsamic vinegar for the extra flavor.  This also works and an excellent marinade for chicken!

Good recipe.  We enjoyed it.  Need to play with it a little to get it to come out right - the lack of stay power to the emulsification was a little frustrating.

I really like the combination of flavors and think it's a great recipe.  One thing I especially like about this recipe is that I can control the amount of oil.  We are sometimes dieting and watch our fat intake.  I have even lightly sprinkled this mixture on a salad in it's dry form.  It's also good sprinkled on sandwiches.

This is a very good base for Italian dressing!  However, we prefer more flavored vinegar and less oil.  Would definitely make it again!

Good start. I didn't have celery salt or garlic salt, but only the powders. So I added only the 2 Tb salt, and a teaspoon seasoned salt for zip. I also used olive oil. Other than that I followed the recipe and it was great!

I had really high hopes for this but it just didn't taste very good.  I used olive oil to prepare the dressing, maybe that was why.

I did a half batch, although I omitted the salt and used 1/4 tsp lemon-pepper-salt blend and 1 tsp kosher salt. Since my dry mix measured around 3 TBS, I used 1-1/2 times the wet ingredients and poured it all into an empty salad dressing bottle. Tastes good right off, and I am excited to try it in several hours! Thanks for sharing!!

I'm giving this a 3 star because I found it way too salty.  It may be because I always use Kosher (coarse)salt and I think it's much more intense flavor, but it's still salt and I'm not sure if it would have fixed it enough using regular kitchen table salt.  I even put less than called for b/c it seemed too much to start with.  Other than that, I think it's very good and I will try it again but only use maybe a tsp. of my Kosher salt instead.  My husband and I couldn't even finish our salads it was so salty.

Very good, but it was way too salty.  I cut the salt from 2 TBSP to 3/4 tsp. and adjusted to taste after adding to salad.
