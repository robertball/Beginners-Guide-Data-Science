These are fab! A few tips to make them easier: smear softened cream cheese on the meat (intead of pickle), place wrapped pickles back in fridge for about an hour and then cut. Use a variety of meats, pickles, and cheeses. Sweet pickle with a turkey wrap is tasty. Have fun & play with your food!

these are SO good. My sister first made them a few years back and although I am not a fan of dill pickles, I love this appetizer. I could eat them all the time. My personal favorite it ham - the thicker imported ham slices. I add a tad bit of horseradish to the cream cheese too. A recommendation so it isn't so messy. Dry off the ham slices first and spead the cheese on the ham, not the pickles. Very easy and YUMMY!!!

Very good & easy app.  I make other rolls like these using Buddig corned beef, cream cheese & chopped green onion.  So what I did was chopped the pickle added it to the cream cheese & spread it on 2 slices of Buddig honey ham then rolled it.  The guys always count on me making these, now I have a little variety.  Thanks Linda!

My grandma has been making a similar snack for years. But she calls it Dill Pickle Dip. Instead of putting the pickle in whole, she chops up the pickles and mixes them with cream cheese, a little pickle juice and a dash of salt creating a dip. She sometimes spreads it across bolonga, but she usually serves it as a dip with chips, pretzels, etc. It's been a staple in our family for years!!

This is a great snack - always the first to go at a party!  Spreading the cream cheese on the ham is much easier, I also put garlic powder on the cream cheese once it's spread on the ham - couldn't imagine it without the garlic!

I've been making these since I was ten. We use thin deli-sliced ham, spread the cream cheese on the meat, and either cut into slices or serve them whole. They go faster than anything. They are simple to make and incredibly delicious!

Pretty good! I made half with ham and half with roast beef. I also kicked it up a bit by adding about 1 tsp each of Dijon mustard and horseradish to the cream cheese. They are very messy to prepare. I also only used one 8 ounce cream cheese versus the 2 packages. This was plenty of cream cheese. Can't imagine double the amount. Also more time consuming then expected.

I've been making these for years and they are always well received.  I use the dried beef (rinsed and dried), spread the cream cheese on the beef and wrap big Claussen dills.  I then refrigerate them so the cheese sets up and then slice them into 3/4" slices.  I keep the ends for "family eats" and serve the rest.

One of my roommates introduced me to this recipe awhile back and now all of our friends make it.  We use sliced ham instead of beef and it is easier if you spread the cream cheese on the meat instead of the pickle.  Everytime I bring this to a party, they are usually gone in seconds.

my family has been doing this ever since i was little, so at least 30 years!  we use the rectangular shaped ham you get in the grocery store.  it's best to pat the ham and pickles dry so they don't slide all over the place.  we ALWAYS smear the cream cheese on the ham, NOT the pickle.  it would be too difficult that way!  we also double the ham, so it goes ham, cream cheese, ham, cream cheese, pickle.  it makes for a better ratio of ham to pickle in my opinion.  once they're all rolled up together, we stick them in the fridge for a few hours or overnight so that they'll be a lot easier to cut.  these are so good!

I like to use a flavored cream cheese in this recipe. This works with any deli meat you want, I like to use roast beef or deli ham. My family absolutely loves these.

These were extremely tasty, and so easy to make! I made them for a work event and they were gone very fast. One thing I do recommend is to spread the cream cheese on the ham, which should be patted dry as well as the pickles. Other than that, awesome recipe!

This is a "kid approved" recipe. (at least in my house anyway, but I don't mean to generalize). There are no PICKY eaters here as my hubby and my two young beauties will eat almost anything. (I'm so blessed)! These were great, easy and versatile enough to add any seasoning or spice you desire to spice it up. Thanks Linda; by the way; nice name. tee, hee!

A few tips I learned the hard way: It's important to dry off the meat before trying to spread the cheese on it, or the meat will tear. It's also important to chill the entire wrapped pickles before slicing, or the meat will pull off. I had a lot of trouble making these, so I don't know if I will attempt it again.

I do this with ham, in the exact same way. I wrap my rollups in aluminum *tightly* and refridgerate overnight to make cutting super easy. It also helps if you stick the knife in the freezer before slicing.

I've been making these appetizers for many years and it's one of my favorites. I add a little horseradish, garlic powder and a drop of Tabasco to the cream cheese for flavor. One thing, tho....I am trying to imagine why anyone would try to smear cream cheese around a pickle when all you have to do is spread the cheese on the meat slice and roll the pickle up in it. Different strokes, I guess. I've made these with roast beef, dried beef, ham and smoked turkey. My favorite is dried beef, but all are good.

I don't have patience to spread cream cheese on a damp pickle so I did it in layers----first the tortilla then place the meat on that - then more cream cheese on the meat and then the pickle.  Less hassle but same great results - these are a hit for any ocassion.

Excellent!  Everyone loved them.  Just make sure they stay COLD or they are not good.  We put them in a metal bowl and put that bowl in a larger bowl full of ice.  I had no problems spreading the cream cheese on the pickles (I thought it was easier then spreading it on the meat because the meat just tore.) and then wrapping the ham.  Definately goes in my recipe book!

I use a variation of this recipe.  Instead of the sliced beef, I use dried beef from the deli, not the processed stuff in the lunchmeat department.  Also, it is much easier to spread the cream cheese on the meat and then wrap it around the pickle.  You can also use the soft cream cheese in a tub instead of the packaged cream cheese, just don't used the whipped cream cheese.

I've made these pickles a million times.  I use pastrami slices for a bit of kicked up flavor. I've made them in a moment's notice by warming the cream cheese in the microwave a bit before. It definitely is easier to spread the cheese on the meat slices.  The red and green make it "festive" for the holidays.

Sounds awful, but tastes great.  When I am pressed for time, I put the pickles through my food processor, add them to the softened cream cheese, and use as a spread on thin ham slices. Adding a little pimento zips it up a little also.

These are good, but even better with a sweet gherkin pickle. It isn't as "low carb" friendly that way, but the sweet pickle is a great flavor with the salty meat. A little more difficult to assemble because of the tiny pickle, but I just spread some cream cheese on each and then slice the meat into strips a little narrower than the pickle and wrap. No need to slice, one small gherkin is a perfect serving.

Good--but I recommend full-fat cream cheese with this one.  I tried the light stuff and it just isn't the same to me.

We beg for these on special occasions in my family. We call them Hammy Pickles. We spread the cream cheese on the beef and then wrap the pickle. It is important to use smaller pickles, the larger ones make things more difficult. Yum yum.

I could not wait to try this recipe! I'll admit, the ingredients looked gross together, but my college roomate and I used to stay up late and eat dill pickles with  cheddar cheese all the time so I thought I'd give it a try!!  This wasn't as good as that, but it came really close!! I also spread the cream cheese on turkey and sprinkled it with some garlic salt.  I also used plain dill pickles, next time I'll pick up a jar of the zesty dill and see if they come out a little better!

This recipe was a big hit at a 12 year old girl's slumber party. I used ham instead of beef.

Love this recipe! I have been making them for a few years now and I use pastrami instead of ham (amazing combo with the cream cheese and pickle). I also melt the cream cheese a little to make it easier to spread and spread it on the pastrami instead of the pickle first.

Ok trying to be pc here so will change name, but when I got this recipe about 40 years ago they were called Pickle "Richards"   For sure spread the cheese on the meat not the pickle and hot dills work great.
The guys always cringe when the slicing starts.lol

These were a pleasant surprise! 5 stars for ease of preparation & taste that I think would appeal to a lot of people (provided that they like pickles, of course!) I made these this past weekend as a last-minute appetizer to add to my spread for a baby shower I hosted for a friend, & they got eaten up! I used both roast beef & ham & I thought both were yummy, although I think roast beef was preferred by more people. Definitely a simple, no-fuss appetizer that's great for parties or snacking!

This is a favorite in my family!  We spread softened cream cheese on the beef, and sometimes do a double layer of that for a little extra oomph:)  Everyone always fights for the leftover ends.  Delicious!

My husbands family always makes these.  They call then picke rolls.  But we use corned beef!  The easiest way to spread the cream cheese onto the corned beef it to put the cream cheese into a pastry piping bag!!!!

Absolutely delicious!  In addition to beef, I also made with ham, turkey, smoked turkey, and pastrami.  Definitely spread the cream cheese on meat. It's a great flavor.

Great snack or appetizer.  Hadn't thought of using ham, but will try that next time.  Be sure to get the crisp, garlicky, refrigerated pickles.  A true classic!

These are yummy, but I would definitely spread the cream cheese on the meat and not the pickle.  Also, put a layer of cream cheese on each layer of meat.  It makes a difference!  The taste combination is great!

I just popped on to add this recipe!  My Mom made them over Thanksgiving and I couldn't stop eating them!  They are absolutely addicting!!  She used ham instead of beef... and I may try them using just cream cheese and tortillas with the pickle...many of my friends are not big on meat.  But this is a must try!  :)

My whole family loves these.  I use sliced ham. I spread the cream cheese on the ham, add the pickle to one end and roll up jelly-roll style, then slice.  The tray of these always comes home empty when taken to a party.

Oh these are so good!  I have made these since I was a little girl and they are so addicting.  I normally use the chipped beef lunch meat, but ham is good as well.  I smear the cream cheese on the meat first, then roll up.  I cut them in pieces immediately with a sharp knife then put them in the fridge.  At that time about half of them are already gone from me picking thru them and eating them lol!  So addicting and delicious!

I liked these, but I've made them before and instead of ham I used salami. So my audience didn't really care for these since they liked the salami better.

Surprisingly delicious! Honestly I thought this recipe sounded horrible, but it had such great reviews that I had to try it. I'm making these for a Christmas party tomorrow night, but I tested one first and they are so good!   I patted the ham dry and spread the cream cheese on the ham as suggested by other reviewers. I also used 1/3 less fat cream cheese and I can't tell a difference in taste at all.

I have been making these for years, after  hesitantly tasting one (and then another, and another ...) at a company Christmas party. I use thin-sliced deli ham (blotted dry) and spread softened cream cheese on that. Then I take a pickle spear (also blotted dry) and roll them up. Refrigerate for about an hour, then slice. What a strange concept, but oh so delicious! Thanks for posting this recipe!

I made these for a BUNKO party and everyone loved them!  They were a hit.  They might be a little time consuming to make but so easy.  I used one jar of baby dill pickles, a package each of turkey and ham Buddig (sp?) lunch meat and not quite one 8 oz block of cream cheese that was softened.  These are great for the pickle lovers!

This recipe is wonderful!  Sounds weird, but they are GREAT!!!  Not only did my entire family enjoy them at our Christmas get together, but so did all of the kids in my Sunday school class at church.  In fact, several of the KIDS are asking for the recipe so they can make them at home. Thanks!

I add some shredded, sharp cheddar cheese and finely chopped green onion (use the green part, too) to the cream cheese (mix well) before spreading on ham slices.  Grandkids (all ages) absolutely love this recipe....

These are soooo good!  I love that they are a low-carb snack and low in points for Weight Watchers.  My kids love them!  I use the whipped cream cheese so make it easier.

My mom made these for my sister & I for our lunches while in elementary school.  Even picky 5th graders wanted to trade foods with us to get some of these!  P.S. - We prefer ham instead of beef.

I spread the cream cheese on the meat before wrapping them. I layed a couple of these in front of hubby while he was talking on the phone, he stared at them with a strange look on his face! Then he took a couple of bites and fell in love! This is a neat little snack idea. Thanks!

We call these picklewiches. They are always popular when I make them. My husband tries to snitch them before I get to serve him. I let him have the butts.

For pickle lovers, these are amazing! I served these at my New Years party using ham and they were a big hit. My suggestions would be-1)use soft spread cream cheese because I found it a bit difficult to spread on the meat and 2)use the smaller dill pickles. I bought the normal size and ended up cutting them in half. For presentation purposes I think it looks nicer with the round center. I will def. make these again!

I made these with the Super Bowl spread.  My daughter really liked them.  I reduced the fat by using FF cream cheese.  For variety, I used ham, roast beef, and turkey.

I have made a version of this for a few years now.  My only tip is make sure that both your pickles and meat are as dry as possible.  It will all stick together much better.

Ebony loves Pickles! I made these for a Superbowl party! Though the slathering of cream cheese around the pickle was a bit messy they turned out pretty good. My guests mentioned how good they were over and over again.  My niece who went to college in Iowa said that the locals eat these fancy pickles on a regular. I'll make these again. Great, easy party/snack recipe!

Very good.  I used the refrigerated Claussen pickles to be certain the pickles were crunchy.  The Buddig packaged meats are too small; I bought thinly sliced roast beef and ham at the deli and made half with the ham, half with roast beef.  Great if your coworkers are on the Atkins diet!

I have been making these since I was a kid. So that's been 25+ yrs :).
We called them Frog Eyes.  A few tips I have learned over the yrs I will pass on to you. 1st: Make sure your meat is not too thin. (if it is too thin it will tear when you are trying to spread the cream cheese) 2nd: DRY off the ham. This will make the cream cheese spread easier. 3rd: Sweet pickles ROCK with this combination. Either use the mini or the regular size and half those suckers. 4th: I have found that a thicker layer of cream cheese tastes great. And make sure you let your cream cheese set out at room temp to soften up.  This will surely make those "Frog Eyes" jump right off the plate!!

I mix half mayonnaise and half cream cheese (easier to spread on ham) and serve on a large flat platter decorated with leafy lettuce underneath the slices.  In each piece, I put a colored toothpick so people can pass by the plate and pick one up without needing a plate or fork.

These sound so bizarre...so, I had to serve them at a Baby Shower. I had a little trouble convincing people to try them, but, those that did really liked them! I'll make them again! A variation of this I've been making for years replaces the Roast Beef with Ham and the pickles with scallions. Very yummy!

I make these all the time, for superbowl parties and my youth group get togethers. It takes time, but i spread the cream cheese right onto the ham and then wrap that in a pickle and stick a tooth pick in it to keep it together. It takes longer, but it is totally worth it. these are SOOO good and they're always gone in a couple of minutes :)

I think if I made these again I would finely chop the pickles and beef and mix with the cream cheese to make a spread and roll them up that way.

This is a matter of taste.  I really liked them, but some of my guests didn't. Its best to cut the slices fairly thin, otherwise the dill pickle overpowers the beef and cheese. Thanks for the recipe.

Very tasty.  I used the large sized dried beef in a jar..it was great tasting and perfectly sized for the pickles.

I made these for a party and my guests just scarfed them up.  Beware the recipe calculator--I bought way too much cream cheese, and not enough roast beef.  Putting the rolls together was a bit challenging, I just used my hands and squeezed it all together.

Low rating due to wifey not liking pickles anyway, but I liked the different tastes together.  I put the cream cheese on the meat and then put the pickle on top before rolling them together.  Seemed to work well.  I got impatient and had one right away.  They probably will be better after the recommended overnight chill.

These were a huge hit at my Super Bowl party. Everyone from 2-59 gobbled these up. Only change I did was to spread the cream cheese on the meat (easily done with it softened) instead of the pickle and by the end I made 9 and still had some left from only one package. I personally wouldn’t use 2. Next time I’ll use thicker meat possibly but honestly this easy and cheap appetizer is awesome as is. Thank you.

One of my favorite appetizers! Spread the cream cheese on the meat, place toothpicks through the meat into the pickle, then cut in between the toothpicks. It won't fall apart on you that way. Pat the pickles and the meat dry. It helps the cream cheese spread easier.

If you want it to be REALLY easy, chop everything and mix it together. To add a little more flavor, add a packet of dry Italian or ranch dressing mix to the cream cheese mixture. Serve it in a bowl with crackers on the side.

I have been making this for over 30 years. I make it with Italian beef, squeeze cream cheese and baby dills, or rotisserie chicken cream cheese and spinach,  or ham, onion and chives cream cheese and baby dills. Never have left overs.

I make this exact recipe but, I chop all of the ingredients (sometimes cubed ham), mix all together and add a little more pickle juice for wetter texture for an
 easy cracker or veggie dip. I always am asked for the recipe. Just an assembly variation

This was a delicious treat! I wanted to use roast beef but my budget called for cooked ham instead. I also used some deli turkey as well. When I was done, I cut the pickles into bite-sized rolls as shown in the pictures, and for additional flavor, sprinkled lightly with oregano, which gave them a hoagie-like flavor. They were yummy.

I have been making these for years!   Here's what I do:  I use deli thin to med sliced ham.  Spread the softened cream cheese on each ham slice (I use a paper towel and dry the ham slices so that the cream cheese sticks).  Place a whole pickle (I buy the fattest whole dill pickles I can find) and roll up (may need to cut another pickle in half and add so that the pickle fills up the width of the ham slice).  Chill and slice.   These are the first thing gone at a party!

I used (chive flavored) whipped cream cheese  to make it more manageable for spreading on the beef slices. I wrapped the beef around a pickle and secured with toothpicks. With a sharp knife these didn't need refrigeration before slicing. This one is a keeper!

Delicious! Made exactly as is and they don't need anything else! I've had these with ham before, but the roast beef really is fantastic! I ended up using 4 overlapped slices becauce the pieces were small. Super easy to make, and can easily be cut into small or large pieces depending on the crowd. As others have stated, it's much easier to just spread the cream cheese on the meat instead of trying to spread it all over the pickle.

Five stars because this is simple, good, and a real hit with the football fans.  In a hurry tip:  soften the cream cheese with a little pickle juice and mustard.  This makes the cheese more spreadable onto the ham and eliminates the need to refrigerate overnight.  Just make and go.  Of course any refrigerating time before the big game is always an added flavor plus.

It is a 5 star with these changes. Beating the softened cream cheese before spreading makes it MUCH easier to spread on the meat.  I also used Buddig's corned beef as it imparts more flavor.  Be sure to dry the slices before attempting to spread the cream cheese.  If using Buddig's, use about 4-5 slices, not just two.  Spread cream cheese on each slice.  Be sure to chill overnight before attempting to slice.

My family calls these piccadillies. Not sure where the name came from! But we make these for every family get together and they are always a favorite! Here's how I make them.... Warm a block of cream cheese in the microwave for about 30-45 seconds, just until it's soft. Spread on a slice of corned beef or honey ham. Wrap around paper towel dried dill pickle. And repeat one or two more times depending on the size of the pickle. Refrigerate for an hour or overnight. Slice them up (keep the butts for your own snacking because they don't look as pretty!) and arrange in a Tupperware container. We place wax paper between our layers so that the cheese doesn't smear and make a mess.

I thought my mother was the only person who made this recipe!  So excited to see it being used by others.  My mom always made these with sweet pickles and they would last about a minute before everyone ate them up!  I never thought of using a dill pickle, I will have to try that next time.  Everyone always looks at me strange when I tell them this recipe, but they change their tune after they try one!

I have been making these for years! They are a little time consuming, I think I eat more than I get made, but well worth it! I use the thin sliced deli meat in the little packages, usually in Corned Beef or Pestrami, but any lunch meat works well.

These were a real hit for our rehearsal dinner! We also varied the meats with chicken and turkey to change things. All were very much accepted. Thanks Linda!

excellent: easy to prepare, but I used the small whole kosher dills, and once you get the phil. cream cheese warm from your hands, it works great.
