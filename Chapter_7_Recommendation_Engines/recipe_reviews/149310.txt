I always use this recipe for any self-rising flour recipes--this is the same one that Grandma taught me to use when I was just beginning to cook. Why spend almost three bucks for a package when you already have the ingredients on hand?

Great recipe to use when you run out! And, it's basically made of stuff you already have on hand. Thanks!

I had a recipe for self-rising flour, but didn't have any. I used this recipe and it worked perfect. Thanks for the baking tip.

Good but one minor fix - take out 2 teaspoons of flour to accommodate the salt and baking powder, and then you have 1 cup of self rising flour!

Thank you for this! I know this may sound silly, but sometimes I forget the ratio of ingredients to use when I need to make some of this (because I rarely ever have the need for self rising flour) This works perfectly and I can quickly look it up without having to search all over!

I LOVE this recipe! I hardly ever buy self rising flour because I rarely use it, but this will keep me from buying boxed mixes of cakes and pancakes. It's so simple!

I am so glad someone suggested this recipe to me on the exchange. It worked perfectly and I am grateful! All ingredients are typical ones you would have on hand where self-rising flour is something that isn't.

The flour/baking powder ratio was helpful. Because I am on a salt restricted diet, I can now make my own self-rising flour with salt substitute. Thanks

I'm so glad this recipe is here.  Making my own self-rising flour is so much cheaper and more convenient than buying a bag at the store.

Worked perfectly!!  I plan to keep this recipe handy because I rarely use self-rising flour and now I won't have to buy it for just one recipe.

I was ecstatic to stumble across this recipe as I don't often need self rising flour, so do not tend to buy it.  I decided today to make Apple Snack Squares for an afternoon snack for my boys (from AR), which calls for self rising flour, so this recipe was a saviour!  Will use this again I am sure!

Works perfectly. I never buy self-rising flour, and why would I when I can so easily make the amount I need with three ingredients I always have on hand?

I found this recipe on-line a long time ago. It may have come from here. It works great for recipes calling for self-rising flour. The first time I used it for a biscuit recipe and it worked well. I don't use self-rising flour enough to buy a bag of it, so this is a good quick subtitute.

I've had to toss partial bags of self-rising flour over the years because I buy them, use a little, and then the baking powder fails by the time I get to the end of the bag.  This will help me salvage the partial still on the shelf by adding new baking powder in the right ratio.  I'll never buy another bag again.

This came in so handy for a recipe I made tonight! I don't keep self-rising flour on hand (because I know I can make it) so this was a convenient substitute with ingredients in my pantry.

WORKS PERFECTLY.  I, TOO, DO NOT KEEP SELF-RISING FLOUR IN THE HOUSE, IN FACT, I'VE NEVER BOUGHT ANY MY WHOLE LIFE! (54) I MAKE 8 CUPS OF THIS AT A TIME, 4TBSP BAKING POWDER AND 4 TSP SALT, PUT IN AIR TIGHT CONTAINER AND KEEP IN THE PANTRY.  SO GLAD I FOUND THIS RECIPE.  THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR POSTING IT!

Worked perfectly in Judy's Pumpkin Muffin recipe on this site.  I will never buy self rising flour again because I rarely use it and always have regular (or bread) flour on hand.  For people who don't bake a lot, this is a real money saver!

Works perfectly, thanks! I don't always use the salt, but I think the key here is the ratio of baking powder to flour.

I am so happy I found this recipe! I can't tell you how many times I've thrown out expired and barely used bags of self rising flour. This recipe worked just as well as the store bought stuff, which I will never buy again.

Thank you for posting this method! The ingredients I have to choose from where I live (Denmark) can sometimes be limited so I often skip recipes that call for things like this that I just can't find. I had been wondering for quite some time how I could recreate it, but now, thanks to this post, I can!

Great recipe but you left out a very important direction. You should always "shake" the baking powder before you measure it. This activates it. Too many new cooks make this mistake.

I made this in a pinch realizing I needed self rising flour and did not have any. Grocery stores rather far for us so running out for one ingredient is really not an option. This turned out great albeit I am not to familiar with self rising flour. I made mini muffins for my kids and they turned out amazing! I will definitely make this again insult buying self rising flour. Thank you!!

Wow this is really helpful and works just like the self-rising flour you can buy in stores. :) Just don't mistake baking soda for baking powder. I heard using baking soda makes the dough saltier.

Do you have to use salt or is this just a taster.

I needed 1 1/2 cups self rising flour to make Paula Deen's Peach Cobbler recipe. But I wasn't about to drive all the way to the store to pay $4 for an entire sack of self rising flour. Thanks! The cobbler turned out beautiful and delicious!

Worked perfectly.  I was making 'Cranapana Bread' and was short 1 1/2 cups self-rising flour.  Made up this recipe and the bread rose beautifully.  I will continue to use this recipe in place of purchasing self-rising flour.

Thanks for this recipe! I won't have to buy self-rising flour for those "once in while" recipes and then have my self-rising flour get outdated before I need it again.

Works great. Just make sure to sift the ingredients together thoroughly or you will just end up with salty dough like I did the first time I made this.

This self - rising flour works fine. I used spelt flour instead of all-purpose, and it turned out great. It is very handy to have this. Add it to your recipe box!

It's good to know that you can convert regular flour into self-rising using this easy recipe. I needed some for the French Veggie Loaf from this site, and it worked great. Thanks for the easy, in-a-pinch recipe!

I used half unbleached and half whole wheat pastry flour and I used this to make whipping cream biscuits. It worked perfectly!  They were light, tender and fluffy.

WOW!!!!  This recipe is amazing!!  It's just like my grandma used to make too.  I never thought one could make this at home.  I don't always use self-raising flour, but on odd occasions I might need some.  Thank you so very much for this one.  Gosh, what a find!!

Thanks a lot

This worked out great!  In fact I think I will always make my own from now on.  Why pay more when I can make my own? :-)  i'm just sayin' it's another way I can save money in my kitchen!
