This recipe is absolutely excellent! Very quick and easy.  My hubby loved it (and he usually doesnt rave about food unless its puertorican). He said it was a keeper!

Same ingredients, only double the liquid.. and put it in the crockpot for 5-6 hours, worked great.

Somewhat bland. May help to marinate the chicken in the juices overnight. Was good served with black beans and rice.

I found this dish to have plenty of flavor. Used boneless/skinless thighs instead of whole chicken, came out great!

I made this with chicken breasts, and found it did not have much depth of flavour, but it is unusual enough that I will make it again, adding some stock powder. Served with oven rice, black beans and a spinach cranberry salad, it made a good menu.

The chicken didn't really take on any of the flavors and was pretty boring, but wow, that sauce! I could eat that over rice any day of the week.

Tried this--smelled great, but was kind of bland and greasy.  My always hungry teen-aged son passed on seconds.  I won't make this one again.

This chicken was pretty good. My husband really enjoyed it. We eat a lot of rice and therefore, cook a lot of Asian food. It was nice to find something different to serve over rice. I did cook this in the slow cooker so the different flavors really incorporated into the chicken. Will make again.
