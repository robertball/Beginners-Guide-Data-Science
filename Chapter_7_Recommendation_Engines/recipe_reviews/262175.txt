Delicious with an amazing texture.  I made a mistake somewhere as the cake did not come out thick enough to cut into three layers.   But the final product was definitely a keeper!

Very good and unique.  It didn't rise enough to make three layers, though.  Also, the sour cream and sugar never  really thickened, even after whipping it on my stand mixer for over 20 minutes, but it was still delicious.
