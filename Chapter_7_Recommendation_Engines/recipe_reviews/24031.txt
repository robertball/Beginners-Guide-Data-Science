Cookies came out really flat and nothing like Thumbprint cookies.  They were also very hard.  Very unattractive cookies.

Very tasty!  Since I had to wait for other cookies to finish baking, I put the dough into the fridge-I found that the first few batches were a little 'fluffier' than the ones that were done after sitting at room temp. for a while (seemed to spread a little more).  Also added a touch of vanilla extract.  A definite easy make-again!
