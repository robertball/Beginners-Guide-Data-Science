This is great as a salad or a sandwich filling. If I'm using it as a salad, I don't put the ham mixture in the food processor - I simply chop the ingredients the old fashioned way. I like it a little chunkier. I also add about 1/4 c. diced onion and a dash of freshly ground pepper. I love this wrapped in lettuce leaves. Thanks Barrett!

I would never have thought of adding cheese but I found this recipe when I was looking for a ham salad recipe.  This is great.  I used almost half and half ham to cheese.  Terrific idea!

I love adding celery to sandwich fillings for both the taste and the crunch, but my husband HATES how celery strings get in his teeth and avoids it at all costs unless cooked to death. I would have never thought of putting it in the processor with the ham! It's the perfect solution! I'd never made ham salad before, but we really like this recipe!

My family was not very impressed with this recipe.  After the first dinner I added some salad dressing (Miracle Whip) and sweet pickle relish and my DS and DH found the salad more palatable.

Yummy!  And SOOO easy to make!!  I was done in about 5 minutes, and now I have tons left over for lunches throughout the week!  UPDATE:  I've recently started adding 1/4 c chopped onions and a few chopped baby carrots to the mix...great way to get in those veggies!  I've also been using fat free cheddar and mayo with great results...i've been leaving out the mustard because I rarely have it in the house (not a fan)

I used this to make finger sandwiches for a club meeting, and everyone seemed to enjoy them.  I really liked the combination of flavors.   I left out the celery because I didn't have any on hand.  This was my first attempt at making homemade ham salad, and I'll definitely use this recipe again.

This did not taste at all like ham salad I ate as as child or bought in the store.  My children did not like it and neither did I.  It was easy to make.  It was just not creamy enough for us.

Great recipe.  Decided to make it for a change of pace for breakfast, but my celery had gone south.  So I used apple instead and a splash of sweet pickle juice to loosen up the salad and to keep the apple from browning.  Worked just as well as the celery does.  Next time I will use both celery and apple.  Thanks for the recipe!

YUM...We LOVED this! I've never made ham salad any other way other than the usual ham/relish/mayo combination, but this was great. We really liked the crunch of the celery and the cheese was a nice addition as well. I just eye-balled the mayo and mustard to taste. I will definately be making this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I've been making homemade ham salad for over 25 years and I never considered adding cheese, even though I seem to find a way to work cheese into as many recipes as possible.  I use Miracle Whip instead of mayonnaise, and also add a couple of tablespoons chopped onion in my ham salad.  The addition of cheese made an easy and tasty recipe even better.  If anyone finds the recipe too dry, I suggest adding a little more mayo and mustard until the salad reaches your desired consistency.  It really is as simple as that.

How funny Barrett; I ran into the same problem while making school/lunches-not quite enough ham salad. Found this recipe and wondered why I never thought of putting cheese on ham salad before. Such a simple idea! My daughter loves brie, so that's what I used. You could do a lot with this recipe, such as, grilled ham salad and cheese, or placing the salad into mini phyllo cups, topping with the cheese of your choice and popping them into the oven for yummy little appetizers! Thanks!

This was pretty basic stuff, and I used sharp cheddar and Miracle Whip and mesquite smoked deli sliced ham. I skipped the food processor and just used my cutting board and my favorite knife. This was alright but I feel like it was just missing something only I couldn't figure out quite what, maybe pickle, onion, or eggs? My husband did not like it at all. This made a really quick easy lunch for me though. Thanks!

Onions are essential! I used about half an onion and three small stalks of celery.  After running them the food processor, I added them to the mayo/mustard mix.  Also, I used a little Penzey's 4S seasoning salt for an extra kick.  Simple and tasty recipe.

Made this as I was looking for a ham salad recipe that was a little different.  I hadn't ever thought of cheese in it! I forgot the mustard, and I think next time I'll throw in a few jalepenos in the mix.  YUM. Don't think this will last the day in this house. Thanks for the recipe Barrett!

Awesome! Added about a 1/4 cup of red onion and a couple of Tbsp of dill relish. Served on the small Hawaian rolls -- just wonderful. The recipe is similar to my own but had never thought about adding the cheese, mustard and doing in the processor. How easy. A keeper.

Like others, I made additions: 2 boiled eggs,chopped; 1/2 cup onion, chopped.
I didn't use the food processor as it was easy to chop ingredients by hand.  It's a permanent recipe for me.

I added a teaspoon each of garlic/onion powder and a little Frank's Hot Sauce. I also used dijon mustard. Very good. This was enough for five sandwiches. NOTE: This works with turkey ham, for those on a budget.

I've made this several times on many occasions, exactly as directed (though assuming 2 stalks of celery was meant to say 2 ribs) and it's been a hit every time. Works great as a sandwich or wrap filler as well as a dip for crackers or pita chips. I've also made it with chicken and added a bit of dried dill weed. A perfect solution for what to do with that last bit of leftovers!

I have never tried ham salad as it has never seemed too appealing. This was really terrific. I do not like celery so I substituted green onion instead. I processed the ham so it was a bit chunky. I added a bit of hot sauce. My husband thought it was the best he's ever had.

This was my third time eating ham salad, and my very first time making it! As I looked into the refrigerator looking for lunch, a sudden inspiration hit me: time to use up the leftover Easter ham and make ham salad!

This was a very good recipe, and the list of ingredients was nice and short. I spread this on whole wheat bread, and found it tasty and satisfying. However, it needs more celery; and beware of chopping the ham too fine like I did (a beginner's mistake :) Preparation was not too long.

Overall, very good and if I ever have any more leftover ham, I might just make this again!

Try adding a couple of healthy shakes of cayenne pepper. I add it to egg salad also. Gives it a little kick. Of course cayenne lives on my counter next to the kosher salt and pepper mill.

We had some leftover ham from Easter and I ran across this "idea", fixed it in a hurry just as the recipe said. I only have a small processor so it got kinda messy, but the taste was fantastic. Thanks for sharing.

As written this is ok. A bit bland. Easy to prepare. Bring it up a notch with a sprinkle (not much!) of ground cloves or allspice. Also try it with one scallion, white and green parts.
