I loved this! I played with it a little. My husband wasn't thrilled with the idea of using spaghetti noodles, so I used the spirals instead. After reading a comment about the lack of flavor, I adde two envelopes of Italian seasoning dressing along with 16oz Zesty italian dressing. It was sooooo good. I got a lot of compliments on it!

I make a similar salad to this, but I like using angel hair pasta, rather than spaghetti, and break in thirds before cooking. Also try adding a package of pepperoni cut into quarters.....YUMMY!

Oh, I love this stuff! I used half a bottle of Ken's Steakhouse Three Cheese Italian and added mayo and garlic powder. ( I prefer it to be a little more creamy and a bit less tangy.) I added diced bell pepper and chunks of turkey  and I also broke my spaghetti into thirds before cooking. It's definitely better to make this the day before you plan to serve it.Very good flavor... light and fresh. DH says to add black olives next time. Thanks for the post!

I had to make a salad for my daughters school - I made this, but did a few changes. I added purple onion instead of green. I added a jar of McCormick Salad Supreme; which added alot of flavor. It is a good basic recipe. You can do so much to it to create your own. Will use recipe again.

use this spaghetti salad recipe but also can add pepperoni cut into quarters as well. Also many people use Salad Supreme (found by spices) instead of Italian Dressing mix.

Delicious!!!  It was actually a very refreshing after work lunch.  I left out the olives (hubby doesn't like those) and used Ken's Steakhouse Zesty Italian dressing which is a stronger dressing so it had plenty of taste.  The only thing I'm going to do different next time is use two cucumbers, maybe I just like them too much but one just didn't seem to be enough.

My aunt and I love to entertain by the masses, but our budget tends to be tight... so this was the perfect recipe for a recent shower that we hosted. We were able to class this dish up by piling the pasta high and topping it off with 2 to 3 beef and shrimp skewers. Serve with a flavored iced tea and a beautiful dessert and everyone will think you are the best hostess ever!

I used some leftover cooked buttered spaghetti for this recipe. I was out of tomatoes so I added a red bell pepper to still get the red color. I did all the measurements to taste, great light lunch or side dish.

I used light Italian dressing.  This salad is as good as the tomatoes you use.  It wasn't bad as a healthier alternative to the mayo-based pasta salad, but it wasn't spectacular.  Solid, but not thrilling.

It was a really good recipe.  I really enjoyed it.  I used a little bit more italian dressing though because initially it seemed a little too dry for my taste.

I made this for Poker night at our house..didn't have some of the items listed so I changed it a bit.  When spaghetti was cooled off I added season all (quite a bit) then accent sale, then tony's cajan spice, I used red onion, 2 cucumbers.  Next time I will add pepperoni slices.  But everyone went on and on!  Thanks a bunch

This recipe has turned into one of the most requested 'dishes to pass' that I make.  I use the Kraft Zesty Italian dressing and the larger elbow noodles (better for kids to handle). Great every time!

Very easy recipe but it didn't have much taste even after marinating overnight.  Needed something more - all I tasted was oil (and I used zesty Italian).  Not tangy at all.......had to add salt, more Italian seasoning and 'Garlic Garni' from Garlic Festival Foods.

YUM!! This recipe is great!! You chop up the veggies while the pasta is cooking- doesn't take long at all.  Great for cookouts- Make it the day before- that way you aren't so busy as you are getting everything else ready for a Barbque

This is edible, but it's way too bland for me.  I had to add vinegar and more italian dressing and I still don't like it.  Maybe I was just expecting something different, but I won't make this again.  I would have rated this two stars instead of three, but I made some minor changes to the recipe that might have been part of the problem (i.e., red onion instead of green).

This recipe has potential. I made this with rotini and left out the olives due to personal taste.  Next time I will try adding pepperoni and use canned diced tomatoes. Overall it was good, quick,and easy.

I made this recipe and adjusted it to suite my taste! I halved the recipe (for two), substituted purple onions for the green, I used angel hair pasta and left out the Italian seasoning. (Mainly because I didn't have any). I think next time I will add a bell pepper! I didn't let it sit overnight, because after making it, I couldn't wait to eat it!

This was a great salad. I broke my spaghetti in half prior to cooking it. It was much easier to serve and eat. I also added about 1tbsp of salad supreme spice. I also added  fresh broccoli which softens  nicely in the salad dressing over night.  Stacy Zack

It's really funny, because I wanted to make a pasta salad for tomorrow but I didn't have the right noodles, and thought up this exact recipe using the spaghetti because it was all I had but I was worried it wouldn't work. Then I looked on all recipes to see if I could find any suggestions and found this, so I got all the reassurance I needed! Thanks a bunch, great minds think alike ;) It turned out great!

Make this all the time-it is great.  I do usually add pepperoni or sometimes ham chunks.  Great anyway.

This was pretty good, but a little blah.  I added more dressing to give it more flavor, but it could use something's add additional favor.

Zesty made it good, I added a can of small diced tomatoes. I had no olives but it tasted good anyway.
