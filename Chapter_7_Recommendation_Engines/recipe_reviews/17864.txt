Pinenuts and Craisins go together nicely.  Nice taste.  I liked it toasted and then spread with butter.  I only had 1 cup of Craisins and think 2 might be excessive.  I had to use more that 2 cups of flour in order to knead the dough because it was too sticky.  Also, this was done in just 30 minutes, 45 to 55 minutes would have burned it.

BREAD MACHINE REVIEW:  I decided to try at making this in the bread machine and it really did turn out quite well.  First of all I added all the wet ingredients, then the dry (even the cranberries and nuts) then turned it to the dough setting.  Once it reached the end of the dough cycle, I kneaded a little and dropped in a greased pan.  I glazed the top with beaten egg, and cooked in the oven as usual.  Great tasting breakfast bread, perfect with a smear of butter!

I used mixed dried fruit instead of just cranberries, and I think the loaves taste great. They didn't rise as high as I thought they would, but their texture is light. Watch the baking time on these though--35 minutes in the oven and mine came close to being burnt. 45 minutes would be way too much time in the oven.

Excellent!  The only substitution I made was using pecans instead of the pignoli.  I often buy this bread at the market, and was happy to find a recipe that was exactly like the one I love.
