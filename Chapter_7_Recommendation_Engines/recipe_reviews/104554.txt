this is tami, the recipe submitter...thankx for all the comoments, however for those who said it had not much flavor, i can see why, just by looking at the picture that someone put up on this.  it looks NOTHING like what this is supposed to. i need to put one up i think:)

it should come out looking very very VERY juicy, the pan over half full with an orangy liquid to where the onions soak up this color and are almost melted.  if the onions are piled on top and still white when you take it fromt he oven, you didnt add enough season all, or water. this dish does not need anything else but that, unless something else suits your palate:)

enjoy!

I consider myself a fairly decent cook, but I have never been able to solve the mystery of the pork chop.  No matter how I cooked them, I could never produce anything but tough dried out chops.  Until now!  Thank you Tami & Ed.  I can now cook pork chops that I almost have to arm-wrestle for!  These truly are fall-off-the bone tender.  Woo hoo!

The cooking method really does make the most tender pork chops my family has ever tasted.  However, the seasoning is just so-so.  I added garlic because I couldn't see how just onions and seasoning salt could give much flavor and I was right.  The chops were perfect for the applesauce my family was craving but I think it could use a bit more flavor.  I think adding onion soup as a previous reviewer stated would definitely give this the flavor I was craving.  Thank you for the recipe, we will definitely be using the cooking method in the future, we will just be changing the seasonings.
**Update** My husband told me these were the best.  He gave them 4.5 stars, so I updated my rating.  The leftovers absorb all the "gravy" and the flavor comes through more.  Who knew pork chops could taste better the next day?

This is fabulous! Follow the directions and like magic - juicy, tender and tasty pork chops/onions.  This is my favorite pork chop recipe.  I like to use 3/4" or larger bone-in.  The recipe calls for season salt which is fine but add your own garlic, seasonings or whatever your taste buds conjure - I don't think you can screw it up.  If you do use the dried onion soup as a seasoning use only a tsp or two, maybe with a little poultry seasoning (it works well here).  But do not skimp on the real onions - vidalia are my favorite for this recipe.  And guess what?  At the end of the 1-1/2 hours, if you are not ready, just turn the oven off and leave them there; they will be even better after they rest.  And don't bother making gravy out of the liquid - just pour it on as is.

YUMMMMY! I used this recipe "Method" to prepare 'My Own BBQ Chops' for dinner tonite! I have never had such Tender Pork Chops (besides mush soup chops in the crock pot) I season my chops with Emils Rib Rub, Worchestershire Sauce and top each chop with BBQ Sauce and spread it around. Followed the cooking instructions exactly and they were SUPERB!***** This is a KEEPER!!! Thank-you! for the recipe! ;)

These are the most tender pork chops I have ever had!  We used barbeque sauce instead of water, which we all thought gave it great flavor.  Even my picky seven year had seconds.  Served with baked potatoes and green beans.

While these were tender, they weren't particularly flavorful.  I used seasoning salt but didn't use a lot because I didn't want the chops to be too salty.  Perhaps adding garlic powder would help. I have another recipe which is simmered on the stovetop that is better - chops are browned in a little oil, then simmered on low in a combination of can of cream of mushroom soup, dried minced onions, drained canned mushrooms and a little white wine.

I have made a similar recipe but I trim the excess fat from my pork chops and season them with season salt, garlic powder and black pepper.  Next I put the fat in a heavy skillet and render the grease from the fat.  There will only be enough to cover the bottom of the skillet.  If not, add enough oil to just cover the bottom of the skillet and flash fry the chops over high heat until they are brown on both sides but not cooked thru.  Next I place them in a baking dish, cover them with onions, you decide how many just insure each pork chop has some, add about 2 to 3 tablespoons of water or chicken broth, cover and cook 30 to 45 minutes until tender and succulent.  My family calls these "Mama's Pork Chops."  Try them they are super easy, really flavorful and very very tender and succulent, not dry. I bake them at 350.

I was overall pleased with this dish. I noticed that one user mentioning the meat came out dry and another user mentioning the use of a gravy. I too, ended up with a very dry pork chop even though I followed the directions to a tee. I kept the gravy comment in mind and added some flour to the left over liquid in the dish and got a nice semi-thick gravy mixture. Of course, it could be made thinner or thicker depending on the person's liking. After I made and used the gravy concoction, I was very happy. I still think I'll try cutting down the cooking time or perhaps the temperature next time but over all, with the gravy included, I was happy and content with this dinner. Thanks!

These pork chops were very tender and tasty.  I found them to be a bit sweet tho...I guess that comes from the onions.
I added garlic and garlic salt/powder and otherwise cooked as recipe calls.  I will make again and maybe not put in as much onion (even tho we love baked onions) and see if that adjusts that sweetness since we tend to like more savory dishes. Still really good.

best pork chops I have ever had. I didn't have season salt, so I just used garlic powder, salt and pepper. I also added a few sliced potatoes on top. So tender and delicious. They aren't the nicest looking pork chops, but they are delicious. Next time, I will try browning them first.

I tried taking a pic but it was gone before the camera could focus!  I only added mushrooms.  My family LOVED it and I'm the man once again!

Very tender and easy. I scrubbed and thickly sliced about 3 idaho potatoes and put them in  with the chops and they came out just right. Used seasoned salt, garlic powder and adobo and 1/2 cup of water instead of 1/4 cup since I added potatoes.

I love pork chops but every time I make them they come out tough and dry. I tried this recipe hoping they would come out tender, and that is exactly what happened.  These pork chops were falling apart as I was trying to get them out of the pan. I seasoned them with some random Parmesan Garlic seasoning I had in the cabinet and they were the best chops I have ever made! Beware: the pan turns brown and looks like it will never come off but make sure you use a glass baking dish, and if you soak it in warm soapy water for a few minutes it comes perfectly clean! :)

These are THE BEST Pork Chops ever! No more dry, chewy, chops! I used 1/2 in. boneless, and they were so soft we didn't even need knives! I seasoned according to my family's tastes (more seasonings) and the onions also came out soft and carmelized. I'd make this again for dinner tonight if I had more pork! Thank you, Thank you, submitter! I've always dreaded making pork chops because they come out so tough and chewy, but not anymore!! One of the best recipes on this site!

I have made this as written and doctored up. It's a great recipe either way. You can do so much with it.  As written, the key is the seasoning salt and to slice the onions thin. Be generous with the seasonings. The only thing is that it seems to high of an oven temp and cooking time.   I doctor it by using beef broth instead of water about a cup of it then I add garlic, mushrooms, adobo, Garlic salt and onion powder.  I also cook at 350 for 45 minutes.  Thanks for sharing- it's really good especially with mashed taters. :)

These were the best pork chops ever! Just wanted to thank you very much for this recipe. My husband and family said that these were the best pork chops they ever had. The only change I did was put the seasoned salt on both sides of the chops, sprinkled the tops with garlic powder and worcestershire sauce. Absolutely delicious, tender and yummy!!! Thanks again for this recipe. My husband wants me to make it again next week. Is on the top of my list for dinners to make.

This was delicious! Instead of water I used low sodium/fat beef broth (1/2 c.), otherwise made the recipe as stated.  Served with rice and zucchini!

These turned out great!  Since there are only 2 of us, I used 2 boneless chops and for personal preference used 1/2 water and 1/2 Worcestershire sauce, baked at 400 for 30 minutes and turned the oven down to 300 for another 25 minutes.  They were very tender and flavorful.  I served with broccoli, cauliflower and carrots in light cheese sauce and fresh strawberries.  Great!

I really liked these. I made them last night and they were very tender and moist. I think maybe they could use some more seasoning but that's just in my opinion. I seared both sides before putting them in a baking dish with chicken broth and onions and mushrooms. Very good!

This is the most incredible pork chop recipe ever.  Make sure you use LOTS of seasoned salt!  I coated both sides of the pork chops with it.  I didn't measure the water but just added water until the pork chops were just barely covered with water.  The broth that it makes is delicious, so you want to make sure you have enough.

I served the pork chops on top of rice and then spooned the extra broth on it.

Delicious!  I wouldn't change a thing!

FANTASTIC!  So tender you didn't need a knife.  The cooking time is correct even if your pork chops are thin.  I used Italian seasonings and Worcestershire sauce.  The onions were fabulously carmelized and I will increase the amount the next time.  No more dry pork chops for us.  This is a definite keeper.

This is a great basic recipe for juicy, tender pork chops. I modified this recipe to include seasoning such as sage and a dash of garlic powder. I also poured a thin layer of honey barbeque sauce on top of each chop before I placed them in the oven. I used a single vidalia onion and it was more than enough for the whole pan. I also added a squeeze of lemon juice to the water in the pan.

If you're afraid of serving the same dry, chewy pork chops everyone has regretfully endured at one point or another, try this recipe. The method of baking the chops in water is excellent and will be my base for all pork chop recipes. Try this recipe and modify it to make it your own.

This one didn't "grab" us.  It wasn't bad really, just not so good either.  The chops were tender, but while they weren't lacking taste, they were kinda boring(?)  'Seemed like a recipe from a good cook who doesn't need to use recipes - which fits this one perfectly.

Awesome Pork Chops!!  I don't think I'll cook them any other way again!!  I did think the seasoned salt was a little too salty for us, so I used Emeril's Essence tonight and they were DELICIOUS!!!

This recipe has become a standby for me!  The key is using lots of seasoned salt.  I use boneless chops and bake for 1 hour at 400, then 1 hour at 300--so tender you don't need a knife!  Try replacing the water with dry white wine.  I've even forgotten the liquid, and they still turned out great.  I always serve with mashed potatoes.

HUGE hit. These pork chops were mentioned for days after. I created a dry rub for the chops using sea salt, black pepper, dry mustard, lemon pepper, and a hint of rosemary, and added chopped carrots to the pot. The pork chops were incredibly tender, and so very tasty. Huge hit for a very simple recipe! This is certainly a keeper, and a recipe that allows for a lot of individuality. Experiment with it, and make it your own. Thanks for sharing a wonderful basic recipe.  So much better than frying...

This was one of the easiest recipes ever and was ready for the oven long before it was heated up. I used 1 Texas sweet onion and added some fresh ground black pepper. These smelled delicious while they were baking and the aroma was mouth watering for sure. My husband loves pork chops and really just picked at these. I thought this was a rather bland dish and it turned out really dry too. The onion flavor was mild and I really didn't notice it much. I think a healthy dose of garlic would help this dish a lot.

I loved this recipe. The chops were so tender.  My hubby did not make it home for dinner, so he ate his for lunch the next day.  Left overs were good too, but not as good as fresh out of the oven in my opinion.  I had 4 boneless chops about ½ - ¾ in thick.  Baked the covered chops about 30 minutes at 400 degrees then turned it down to 350 (my oven cooks a little hot) for 10 minutes. Then I decreased oven to 300 for 35 minutes. I used 2 Vidalia onions sliced into rings. Didn’t change the actual recipe except for proportion needs.  Served with  Grilling Beans; marinated cucumber, onion and tomato in low fat Italian dressing. Will make again.  Company quality, lighter-side dish.

Thank you so much Tami and Ed, I'm now able to cook a chop everyone will eat, it's fork tender and delicious.  IDK why people state it doesn't have enough flavor, mine are always delicious, here are a few suggestions to up the flavor, use some garlic/garlic power, sub white wine instead of water, I always add some herb . . . strangely enough using 1 t. of poultry season works well, has the perfect herb blend for pork as well as chicken.  I love this recipe and it's become a almost weekly meal at my home, again thank you so much for the wonderful recipe.

I have to admit I was really skeptical when I first saw this recipe.  I thought that onions and seasoned salt alone couldn't possibly work, that it'd be too bland.  I was wrong!! The pork came out so incredibly tender (no knife needed), and the pork and onions were delicious.  Sometimes being simple goes a long way.  Definitely worth giving it a shot if anybody is on the fence about trying this one!! :)

I made this for dinner tonight. I am a masters student  with not a lot of time on my hands. While studying I made this. Only took 15 minutes to prep. I added mushrooms and bell peppers to add more veggies! So  good! I am sending this to my friends to try! Couldn't be happier with these simple ingredients!

All the high reviews promised a lot, so I had my hopes up high for these chops. Maybe that's why I was so disappointed. I used two bone-in chops that were almost an inch thick and, with the exception of adding pepper and garlic powder, I followed the recipe exactly. They were cooked through and moist, but they certainly weren't fall-of-the-bone tender. I still needed a steak knife to cut them up. Maybe that was due to the thickness...? The juices in the pan after cooking weren't really appetizing, so I didn't do anything with them. They tasted alright though, but I do have to say that the best thing about this dish is the onions, which, after being cooked for so long, were deliciously sweet and tender. I wish I had put more on top of my chop. We served these with potato pancakes and applesauce - a classic combo. I'd like to try a variation of this again to get the moist chop, but I'm not sure what I could do to make it better. Maybe a broth instead of water...?

My family doesn't like the consistency of onions, but my daughter wanted baked pork chops without breading, so I decided to give this recipe a shot and just modified it a bit.  After reading the reviews I decided to use 1tsp garlic powder, 1tsp season salt, about 1/4 tsp black pepper, and then a couple tsp of dry onion soup mix (less podwer, more miced onions).  Our chops were thinner, so I baked at 400 degrees for 50 minutes.

Dinner was Awesome tonight.  Family of four was disappointed that I didnt make more than six chops.  My one son who will never eat anything chewy litterally consumed these!!  The first time I have made Pork Chops that have not been chewy!  Thank You.  I did add seasoning including Garlic but they were great.  Also great for my husband who is diabetic.

Oh wow!  These pork chops came out fork tender and delicious.  The onions gave them a nice sweet taste (and were delectable in their own right).  No dry pork chops with this recipe! Thanks!!! I am so glad I fought the urge to pan sear them first - sticking to the recipe was the way to go.  The only deviation in my version was to place some sprigs of fresh thyme in with the onions.

Perfect fall off the bone tender pork chops! I put some of the onions under the chops and the rest on top. Sprinkled chops very well with lawrys seasoned salt. Covered the pan tightly with foil and they came out so juicy and tender. I did add 1/2 cup of water instead of 1/4 cup but that was a mistake because the chops were swimming in juice when I took them out so next time I will go with the 1/4 cup recipe called for.

These pork chops were SO moist, though I needed a knife for some bites, most of them really did fall apart off the bone.  My husband doesn't LOVE onions (thought I do) so I picked his off when I served it, and he still liked the flavor a lot.  I marinated the chops before- because I didn't know exactly how I would cook them - in worsteschire (sp?), honey brown beer, a little soy sauce, a splash of bbq sauce, garlic salt, and seasoned pepper.  This was super yummy and I will probably make it again!   I would recommend if you are serving anyone that doesn't appreciate cooked/sauteed onions, pick a different recipe...but for the rest of us, this is so good!

It did smell very good while cooking, but after the first hour, my chops were already well over 160 degrees in temperature.  The meat cut easily but was dry and overcooked.  The onions gave the pork chops an odd flavor, and I normally LOVE onions.

This recipe was very good! Every time I make pork chops, they turn out dry. I used 5 pork chops, 1 large Vidalia onion, and seasoned both sides of each chop with Montreal Steak Seasoning. The best pork chops I've made in a while!

This is the best pork chop recipe I've found so far as far as baking and it's quite healthy notneeding any breading or oil. I did use garlic powder and pepper along with the seasoning salt and these turned out so tender and fell off the bone! My boyfriend said these are the best baked chops I've ever made!

Loved this recipe!  Husband said the best pork chops we've ever had.  Was nervous about the little water but a ton of juices came from the meat so it wasn't dry.  I cut off the fat from the chops and the ones with more fat were actually better.  I used boneless though.  I love how there isn't any added butter or stuffing.  Used one big yellow onion on top.  Seasoned with garlic powder, poultry seasoning, salt, petter, seasoning salt.  Turned out great!

Delicious.  And diet friendly.  I cut most of the fat off the pork chops and sometimes add a little balsamic vinegar to the water.  I must have fixed them a dozen times already.  Thanks for a simple, but fabulous way to have tender chops, not to mention the scrumptous onions.

Yummy!!!! This turned out fabulous.  It was fall off the bone tender and the flavor was awesome.  I only had 4 chops, so I used only 1 and a half onions.  Will use more next time.  I made a side dish of rice and was stealing the onions off the pork chops for the top of the rice.  I failed to read some of the other comments about the gravy.  Will definitely do that next time.  Husband loved this dish.  Its a keeper!

We just finished dinner and are unable to eat a lot of tough, dry leftover pork chops.  I followed the recipe exactly, so I don't know what went wrong.  There was plenty of liquid left in the dish.  After reading other reviews, I was looking forward to a really good, moist pork chop.  Very disappointing.

Mine turned out a bit dry, but it may be because I was only cooking 3 big pork chops and 1/2 an onion, but didn't change the cooking time or temp.  I didn't have seasoned salt on hand, so I seasoned it with salt, pepper, onion powder, and garlic powder.  The flavor turned out very nice.  I added a big spoonful of flour to the pan after removing the meat, and it was the easiest gravy ever, if a bit salty.

though i didn't put onions on these and i added my own seasonings i used this recipes mainly because i wanted another way to cook porkchops in the oven without drying them out, this I must say is FANTASTIC!!! we had no left overs, and in fact my family was beggin me to make more. I dont care that it takes an hour and a half to make it; it was well worth the wait. I could cut the pork chops with my fork, they were so tender. Thanks so much for this recipe.

My 7 year old is the pickiest eater ever but when I made this recipe he ate 2 pork chops! My hubby was running a little late from work so I cooked them for 2hrs & 20 min I think it helped I also added garlic powder with the season salt talk about fall off the bone!All I can say now is YUMMY!!

This is an excellent recipe for moist, tender pork chops!  If your chops are a little dry, trying reducing the cooking time at 300 degrees to 15 minutes instead of 30.  However, I cooked exactly as directed and these were perfect!  I added a little barbecue sauce on top of my onions, and it added just a tint of barbecue flavor.  :)

I thought this was fantastic! I added more water than it called for, as I checked around half way and it was mostly gone. I added chopped garlic on top of the chops, beneath the onions and used pork seasoning and sweet chili pepper seasoning. 
I got the "What is this? Pork? How is it so tender?" response, which was great!
Thanks

This did not turn out very good for me.  I used Emeril's seasoning as a previous reviewer suggested, and did everything else as the recipes reads.  My chops were not fall apart tender, they had too much onion taste and no color.  I sauteed some mushrooms and tossed the onions in to use as a topping for some flavor.  Rather disappointing.

Make sure you use good seasoning.  I used bone-in chops with lemon pepper seasoning.  The onions were great bu the chops lacked flavor and tenderness.  Don't shorten the cooking time.

This is a great recipe! The pork chops are definitely the most tender I have ever tasted. I only made 2 servings of pork chops and used 1 vidalia onion, with adobo, paprika, oregano, pepper, and cumin. I substituted the water with white wine. Delicious!! Next time I am adding more onions!!! Cooked at 400 degrees for 45 mins. Best pork chop recipe in the world so far!

Gave it a 5* simply because it is so easy to make and yet so tasty. As stated, it was super tender and the onion & seasoned salt combination lent a wonderful flavor to the chops. Absolutely, among the best tasting pork chops I've ever had - and so simple!!

Wonderful simple recipe. Had my doubts when I first viewed it, but followed the amounts as printed.   The only change being that I browned the chops first - always do because this is how we like them.   Lots of flavor here if cooked properly.  Thanks for submitting

This is a very good recipe, yet so simple.  I only made half the recipe.  I had 4 chops and 2 large onions.  I placed them in the crockpot on low before I went to work.  I came home to some very moist chops. It smelled so good in the house.  I didn't put any liquid in the crockpot-probably should have added the 1/4 cup.  I put most of the onions on the bottom of the pot and a few on top of the chops.  The onions on top of the chops were very dark.  They should have all been together.

Oh yeah, this is good. Used cajun seasoning, hot but excellent. Makes excellent pan gravy too (See D's Skillet Gravy on this site). You could use any seasoning you like.

great, easy recipe. I don't use a lot of salt due to health reasons, so I substituted Mrs Dash, paprika and a little salt for the seasoning salt. Pork chops were very tender and the paprika gives a nice smokey flavor with nice color.

This turned out fantastic!  I didn't change a thing, except probably add a little more water.... it made a fantastic broth and the meat was so tender and delicious!  I ate each bite with a spoonful of broth & a slice of onion.  Everyone else loved it as much as I did!  Truly an easy and VERY tasty dish!

Easy and good. I put cabbage in the bottom of the dish and seasoned everything w/ garlic powder and paprika. I had to go to church and my husband didn't turn it down for the last 30 minutes, but it was still great!

Very nice and tender chops but was somewhat lacking in flavor (spice).  The season salt just wasn't enough umph!  My only change: I tossed in 16 oz. of chopped fresh mushrooms during the last 10 minutes of cooking.

These were very tender.  I served them with sauteed mushrooms, and I sprinkled garlic salt and pepper on them prior to baking.  The flavor was okay, but I think they would have done better with a good gravy.

Chops were dry, tough and basically tasted "boiled" in a watery liquid.  Not tender, with very little flavor.
And they looked very unappetizing.  They were so grey, my husband thought they must not be done.

These chops were fantastic. I'm always on the look out for recipes that I can adjust for just two people, actually when you in your mid 70's it's more like for one and a half people because our appetites have decreased but we still like highly seasoned foods.  I followed the technique exactly but I added a lot of seasoning. I used about a tablespoon of Pensey's Northwood's seasoning about 2 tsps Montreal seasoning, 1 tsp. granulated garlic and rubbed it on the two bone-in center cut loin pork chops.  Added 1 sliced Vidalia onion,  1/4 cup of water, gave both chops a big squirt of Sweet Baby Rays BBQ, covered the whole thing with a sheet of foil lightly sealed. I put foil on the bottom of the dish too.  I think my husband could have eaten two of them, he wants it again tomorrow night......nope......he's going to have to wait a few weeks so it stays special!  Thank you Tami for the basic idea.

I made this recipe because it's snowing like a mother outside and we already had all the ingredients...all three of them...in house. I wasn't expecting much because, for pete's sake, it's three ingredients, but holy cow this was fantastic! I will absolutely make this again, but next time I'll probably sub apple juice for the water for flavor.

I've been making these for about 2 years now, and it is our favorite way to eat pork chops!  3 onions sounds like a lot, but they cook down to nothing. It could even use more lol!

I was amazed at how tender my pork came out.  I think it helped that I had exceptionally fatty ones and the fat helped to keep them moist.  I used Lawry's Seasoned salt with black pepper and some garlic powder.  Delicious, thanks!

Finally, pork chops that are moist and tender.  The only thing I added is a very small amount of Worcestershire sauce basted onto the raw chops.  The dish was delicious and the drippings made excellent gravy.  I will always prepare pork chops this way.  Can't miss - and easy, too!

I normally shy away from pork chops since I can never get them done without being tough but the local grocery just ran them at a crazy price and I was able to get a huge pack of chops, thick ones, for four bucks so the frugal cook in me had to try again...this recipe was the salvation for my chops...they were falling off the bone tender, juicy, and the liquid went wonderfully over steamed rice.  My family normally dreads pork chops for the reasons I dread cooking them but there were no complaints with these and my husband has already requested them again.  I went back to the store and bought two more packs of chops knowing that I can now make them delicious!  Thanks so much for the recipe!!

I had two bone in pork chops probably 1/2 inch thick.  I baked them at the high temperature for 45 minutes before testing for temperature and they were already above 145 degrees.  I couldn't imagine baking pork chops for 90 minutes but maybe that will work for thick chops.  I used Montreal Steak Seasoning on the chops and added a little Swanson Flavor Boost chicken flavor to the water. I must say that the pork was tender and flavorful and the onions delicious.  Thanks!

I needed a good recipe for tender pork chops- hubby is going through chemo which creates a very sore mouth.  I added a bit of apple juice with the water - he can't tolerate spices so this is perfect.  Thanks so much!

These are INSANE!  They come out perfect every single time.  I can not even imagine how anyone had trouble with dry chops unless you did not follow the instructions.  The only extra "tips" that do not change this recipe one bit is that - I use a Dutch Oven to cook them in, dry my chops off with a paper towel before seasoning them, and season them liberally with garlic and onion powder, season salt and pepper.   Everyone in my family loves these!  Even if you hate pork chops try these!!

This is very good..It's so quick and easy. I only had 3 boneless pork chops, but I used the same amount of water, also I used seasoning salt on both sides of the chops, and as another person suggested, I threw in some broccoli for the last 30 minutes. These pork chops were so moist. Wil definitely make again..

The rating here is really for the cooking method. I wasn't able to use a grill, and I didn't want to fry them first, but I modified the cooking method just slightly and they turned out amazing. Marinaded the chops in olive oil, oregano, onion, garlic, salt, pepper, and sugar for 4 hours. Prepared the dish with half water, half Worcestershire sauce, baked at 350 for 35 minutes, and 300 for 15 minutes. Very juicy, and way easier than using the frying pan.

Fantastic way to cook thick cut pork chops! Tender and juicy and really, really worth turning on the oven for. I added chicken stock to the pan instead of water, and a little italian seasoning to the chops, they were wonderful.

I made this last night for the first time and, boy!, was it worth the hour and a half cooking time wait!

It was sooo juicy I couldn't believe. It has a simple, yet delicious flavor and I couldn't be happier. It's my new, go-to, wholesome family meat dish.

Used a little less onion than called for and beef broth in lieu of water.  Seasoned chops with salt, pepper, garlic powder and paprika.  Really delicious!!

Chops were definitely tender but wish both the onion and the chops browned a bit. Not sure if I took foil off in the end if itd be as moist but will give it a try.

After getting absolute RAVE reviews from my husband on how moist, tender and delicious the pork chops were in this recipe, it has now become a household favorite!  I made Ranch mashed potatoes to go with it as well as candied carrots and all we can say is "YUM!" (My husband ate his chop with BBQ sauce - very good to dip in!)

Made just as recipe instructed.  Super moist & very tasty.  I overdid the seasoning salt a bit, but next time will just cut down a bit.  A definite keeper.

I too, read the ingredients and assumed another dry pork chop. Boy was I wrong. These were so tender and juicy.  I made it with 4 boneless thin chops (I just prefer these), 2 onions, 2 tablespoons of water. I added green pepper garlic salt and worchestire to the top of the chops. Since I had less and they are smaller chops I baked at 400 degrees for 30 min and 300 degrees for 30 min.   I chose to melt a piece of swiss cheese on mine after it was done. It was amazing. Can't wait to eat the leftovers tonight!!

This was excellent! I did not have season salt, but I have herbs in my garden, I put sage, thyme, rosmary & basil at the bottom of the pan and seasoned the chops wih sea salt & pepper. I did everything else the same...fab!!!!!! I am going to try this with pork short ribs.

Thank you for sharing this recipe. My husband is picky about pork but he loves this. I just used different spices and it turned out great. Used sweet basil and oregano instead of season salt.

Just got done with making this recipe for dinner.  The pork chops were delicious and so easy to make!  They were juicy and the meat just fell off the bone.  I had no problems with the meat being too dry at all.

I am giving this 5 stars because for something this simple that turns out this good it has to have 5 stars.  Yes the porkchops are moist and tender I could cut them with the side of my fork.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was good nothing super fantastic but easy quick and good.

I followed the cooking method from this recipe and it's perfect.  I used 2 XL yellow onions and Lawry's Seasoned Salt (my favorite for chops).  Along with 1/2 c. water I pureed 1 head of garlic, 1/4 c. flat leaf parsley, and 1 T. Italian Seasoning, then brushed over the onion slices.  This will definitely be popular during the cold months when I'm not grilling.  Moist, beautiful, and delicious!

Finally found the base recipe for pork chops!  The entire family loved these pork chops.  I pan fried with garlic powder, celery salt, parsley (for color), salt and pepper.  Used 1 cup of water and beef bullion, was not too salty.  My daughter liked the fact that she used her fork to cut her chops!

Very good.  The sweet onions were my favorite part.  I didn't like that my meat looked so pale, but it tasted great.

I was surprised how good the chops were.  Very good.  Lots of flavor and very moist.  I did this in my slow cooker.  Four pork chops.  3 onions.  Each chop generously salted with the seasoned salt. I added 5 small, waxy gold potatoes that were scrubbed but not peeled. I added more water.  Maybe a cup to 1 1/2 cup of water.  Only needed a couple of hours on high to cook and I didn't have to heat up the kitchen with my oven.  No need to make the A/C work harder. :)

Good in terms of texture; not dry at all. However, will try to enhance the flavor in the future.

For those afraid of using too much seasoned salt, try an unsalted spice seasoning mixture so that you can add the spice without the salt.  Then, everyone can salt to taste.  A very good recipe to prepare and forget...until its ready to eat.

I made this for supper yesterday.  I used an entire package of onion soup mix, but I took the onions out and rubbed the soup seasoning into the chops.  Then I seasoned with black pepper, garlic powder and poultry seasoning, skipping the seasoned salt altogether. I poured the dried onions from the soup mix on top of the chops, then smothered the fresh onions over all. This was absolutely delicious! I will use the method of cooking for  chops with other seasonings.  I am anxious to try it with barbecue sauce.

I followed this to a t except for the season all..I just used salt pepper and other on hand spices such as minced garlic. It came out bland and chewy and the onions did not brown at all. I made a gravy with the juice to add some flavor. Helped a bit.

Instinctively, I knew 1.5 hours is a LONG time for pork chops. I used a digital thermometer and it only took 30 minutes to come up to 160F in a 400F oven. I used boneless chops in a covered baking dish. Next time I'd like to try caramelizing the onions under the broiler.

After trying this recipe, I am still eating dry pork chops!!!!I am with another viewer on Pork Chops.  I have always had trouble making a moist pork chop for as long as I've been cooking and I think I'll give up.  These were just as dry as any other pork chop I've ever had.  Good flavor, but still dry.  I followed the recipe to the tee, but shut the oven off about 10 minutes early.  I don't know what I'd do different, but I won't be making pork chops anytime soon.  Thanks

Update 10/20/09 Tried this one again and had a little more luck so I changed the rating to 4 stars.. used 3 bone in chops which I seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic poweder and cayenee, used beef broth instead of water, reduced the heat to 350 and baked for a little under an hour. Chops were definitely more tender and this was so easy that I will definitely keep playing around with it.  -----------I halved this recipe and added a little more seasoning as other posters suggested but I only gave it 3 stars because the chops were not tender at all. I baked at 400 for 45 min and then 300 for another 45 min. I may try again but cut cooking time by a bit.

I made it just like the instructions said. My teenagers wolfed down a couple of these chops apiece and were eyeing the one on my wifes plate and mine too.
I enjoyed the simplicity of it and the taste was quite satisfying.  The four of us give it a thumbs up ata boy five.

I used boneless, so the meat was a little dry. But if I had used bone-in, that would probably have not been the case. The meat was TENDER. It was fabulous. I actually browned the chops first for a couple of minutes on each side in a cast iron pan on the stove. Also, used chicken broth instead of water for extra flavor. Then just put them in the oven in the same cast iron pan, with lid. Then when they came out, I removed the chops and added a little corn starch to the juices to make a yummy gravy. Very delicious!

u have to make sure to add lots of water...and dont ever drain the pan! u need that fat! make sure u coat both sides of the meat with the salt and dont be shy...if u add too much salt to anything, put whole potatoes in it to get the salt out....load it up with onions and when they are done u should have a half pan full of juices and water left...if these come out with no taste and are dry u definelty did something wrong.

I was skeptical about this recipe but tried it anyway.  The pork chops ended up turning out so tender and juicy.  I'll continue to make this when I'm looking for a meal that's simple to prepare.  This offers a lot of flavor with very little preparation.  I do agree with the reviewer who said that this might be better served with gravy, though, because mine didn't have very much juice left to serve with it when it was finished.

These were great!  I changed them a little though.  I added garlic powder and some worchestershire sauce before I baked them, and then added about three tablespoons of butter to the mix for the last fifteen minutes.  When they were done I pulled the chops out and stirred in a couple of tablespoons of sour cream.  They're great with roasted potatoes, but they'd be good over rice or noodles also.

My family loved this recipe. I used lipton onion soup mixed with the water and that gave it a great flaver and then the drippings made a wonderful gravy afterwards. Next time I may try to add a few potatoes and carrots in the mix also.

Awesome.
I cut back on the onions slightly, because it was a little strong for us. I thought the chops had tons of flavor!

Thanks for such a great and SIMPLE recipe! This is the only way we cook pork chops now.

Great recipe as is! So moist and flavorful! Because I like to play around with recipes, I made this a second time with a few changes and it came out really good as well: used a mix of chicken broth & white wine instead of water, peeled and thinly sliced some apples to layer the bottom of the glass pan before placing the chops in it, and added garlic powder & a pork rib rub to the seasoning. Deliciousl!!

Excellent. I used this wonderful recipe as a guide, but modified it to suit my preferences. I did use thick chops & put them a quick 15 minute marinade before cooking chops. I rinsed the chops afterward & patted dry. Then I seasoned the chops as directed & sautéed them before baking them in the oven. Instead of water as the liquid, I used reserved marinade combined with white wine. After baking for the first hour, I added a bit of chicken broth. Additionally, I made a mushroom gravy to top the chops. These turned out to be easy & delicious! I will make them again.

AWESOME !!  Tender/Juicy Pork Chops are not easy to cook perfectly by any means.  THIS recipe however is dummy proof and they are perfect every time and believe me, I have cooked pork chops every possible way during my lifetime.  The onion is totally optional and does not effect the tenderness or juiciness of the chops, it ONLY changes the flavor and we love them both ways.  The only thing I do different from the recipe is that I use either beef or chicken broth in place of the water and I use fresh cracked pepper and garlic powder along with the season salt.  Awesome flavor.

This is a basic recipe that I've used for years. The only difference is I brine it for about a half an hour in saltwater. Also, I sift flour on top of and in the water which helps it make its own gravy. It's a good old standby! Thanks for sharing!

Pork chops were so tender. Loved this method. Reminded me of a friend from long ago who told me the onions cried onto the pork chops and made them tender.

This recipe is great. I had a 6 pack of "assorted" chops all bone in. Brined for 2 hours before using recipe and used beef broth instead of water, but skipped the seasoning salt. The cooking method itself was perfect. Chops were super flavorful, tender and moist. Thanks for sharing!

Very good. I also went and put the pork chops in water and a little salt for about 30 minutes before I started the recipe. Very tender and flavorful.

I didn’t deviate from the instructions at all. I have tried for years to cook some decent pork chops. They all looked and felt like hockey pucks and tasted the same.  This recipe works for me.  It’s the only way I’ll cook chops from now on.

I have gotten to the point of making recipes based  on ingredient and process rather than by reviews, most reviews are about how the reviewer made the recipe, not what this is about.  I made these the way the recipe stated with the proper amount of ingredients, and this recipe made a hit with me.   Salt and pepper if you like

So good !!!   Used bone-in pork chops and tenderized with a mallet on both sides   Sprinkled Trader Joe's Everyday Seasoning, layered with onions added water and covered with foil per instructions.  Always turns out tender and delicious.  Thanks for the recipe......

So easy. I used a can of french onion soup  instead of cutting up an onion & the water. The last 30 minutes I removed the foil & let bake @300°.  :) Served over rice & spooned with the pan juice.

This very, very good. My Grams made our baked pork steak the same exact way.  You do have season well with salt and pepper, I add a little garlic, Gram's didn't.  But she did separate the sweet onions into rings and scattered them on top the pork.  That way they steam evenly and make the best sauce.  No need to thicken.  We always had mashed potatoes and sweet and sour cabbage.  Yummy.

Delicious.  I’ve had just like the recipe dictates.  Last night I put cream of mushroom soup with 1/2 cup water mixed in it and spooned it on the chops. Then the onions and water as the original recipe says. 
My friend likes gravy so we added brown gravy mix to most of juices from the pan and made gravy. Yummmmm

I'm sorry I thought these pork chops were going to be tender because of the high star rating on the reviews.   They are usually spot-on and I followed the recipe verbatim. I found them dry and not too tasty. I can't think of any alterations on the recipe that would help these pork chops

I've made the chops pretty good. I was looking at other reviews and there's 1 of 3 reasons yall didn't work based on the pictures you all posted. You weren't using bone in pork chops, the bone adds flavor and a longer cooking time. Your oven needs to be calibrated. Which is something most people don't know. Especially with older ovens. The temperatures are typically off. Or you didn't use the exact portions that were in thw recipe. It's hard to alter a recipe that's not your own or that you have made successfully before.

I made these chops according to the recipe. While I was pleased with the tenderness and juiciness of the pork, they lacked flavor. I made them again and instead of water, I used V8 juice. It made all the difference in the flavor department.

So disappointed.  My chops were STILL not tender.  I did the recipe, and no luck.  Is California pork too, too lean?  All that time and I was really looking forward to a solution to dry, tough chops but it did not do it.  So sorry.

This was my first time making pork chops and I'm very unimpressed. Yeah fine they were tender and the recipe is really easy, but they're soooo bland! I apologized to my family after dinner was over even though they claimed to like the chops. I guess I should have doused the pork in seasoning instead of just sprinkled, and used some liquid other than water.

I made this recipe as written the first time and it was awesome.  So tender and juicy.  Second time I made it, I added broccoli to the dish when you turn down the oven for the last 30 minutes. Which earned me brownie points with my wife.

These were not moist for me.  I'm still not sure why considering the cooking method.  I'll have to give it another shot.  Flavors were not what I'd hoped either.  Used plenty of Lowery's and granulated garlic powder, but the flavors were still very mild.

These are simple but very tasty. I made with Laudry's seasoned salt. "To taste" is not a helpful quantity here, the amount of ss is critical. After reading the other reviews, I coated both sides with seasoned salt. After cooking, they came out pretty orange and slightly too salty, but yummy and juicy.

How simple and how delicious!  Only cooked 4 chops instead of 8, but prepared just as written.  I did lower the cooking temperature by 25 degrees because I used a countertop convection oven and didn't want to overcook. DH couldn't believe they hadn't been in the slow cooker all day.  Will definitely be cooking this dish again!

REALLY BLAND! I did, however, use the leftover meat in a mushroom sauce over pasta the next day.

Sorry - these weren't that good!  Followed the instructions exactly and there was no liquid left in the dish and the chops were pretty unflavorable.  Won't bother with this one again.

Simple, incredibly tender (able to cut them with a fork), and the most amazing flavor I have ever witnessed a pork chop to have. Everyone loved them and went back for seconds!

I bought some bone in chops and was looking for a fast and easy recipe to use them up, and oh my...this recipe is fantastic! and sooo easy! My husband was looking over my shoulder when I prepared them going 'that's it? are you sure you aren't missing any ingredients?'. Then when they came out he told me I could make these any day and to next time make more so  he can have them for lunch the next day! Instead of serving with hot sauce, we put some spice on the chops before cooking. These are amazing - highly recommended!!

We bought pork chops to grill. Due to the weather we couldn't even think about it.  Grilling was the only way we have ever made chops.  I was a little nervous about trying something so simple.  But, we were not disappointed!  This is now my favorite way of preparing pork chops!  Thanks for the recipe.  We served it with brown rice so we could use the yummy gravy/broth it made!

Very tender, as everyone else said!  Loved that about them, and the fact that it was so easy.  However, the color left something to be desired.  Not sure I'd serve these to company.  They looked pallid and not nearly as appetizing as they tasted.  Maybe next time I'll dress them up somehow.  Be prepared for grey-ish chops.

I made this dish the other day for my family of picky eaters and they LOVED it!  My husband enjoyed the leftovers almost more than the original meal!  The chops turned out so juicy and tender you didn't need a knife.  This will be one of those dishes that will go into my family cookbook of recipes I plan to give each of my boys when they leave home!  Thank you, Tami, for such a wonderful recipe!

I love a meal that is so easy, and turns out wonderful.  This is it.  Tried it last night, and everyone loved it.  I marked it down as one I could serve company...and I'm sure I will.  My only notes:  Use Season All (by McCormick) seasoning salt; it simply is better.  Make sure the foil is tight, and maybe double the water.   I reduced the heat to 200 and left it in 30 min. more. Ours was moist and tender! Thanks for the recipe!!!

These chops are wonderful! I was looking at several different recipes and chose this one b/c of the + reviews on tenderness. There is no exaggeration, they were so tender and delicious. I added garlic powder & pepper b/c we put it in everything we eat. Everyone loved them. My sister even wanted the recipe and she doesn't like to cook! Thanks Tami

I didn't have any onions in the house so I used onion soup mix instead of just water. I also cooked on 300 for an hour and then 400 for 30 minutes. This was by pure accident because I didn't read the directions correctly. :) But it turned out great! They were tender and delicious!

This was surprisingly good and very easy. Will make again. I used boneless pork chops that were on sale. Lined a Corning casserole dish with half the sliced onions. The pork chops fit in a single layer over that and then sprinkled in steak spice, fennel, sage, and ground coriander. Covered that with rest of onions and the water. Put the glass lid on and baked as directed. Served with mashed potatos and caesar salad.

Fabulous! I used wine (dry white) instead of water and added some fresh rosemary while roasting.  The meat falls right off the bone.  The only complaint in my household was that I didn't make enough!

I followed the recipe exactly and i was pleasantly surprised with the moist, tender and flavorful chops i got. It may be tempting to add other spices but they really don't need it. My husband doesn't like pork chops and he loved these.

I did this and it was okay. It came out a little chewy and not a lot of flavor. But I have some ideas to make it better so I will try again. I will brown the chop first and use seasoning salt,  ketchup and some hot sauce along with the rest of the recipe. I did use chicken broth instead of water.

Yummy! I did sprinkle about half package of dry onion soup mix over the tops, along with the onions. I kept everything else the same. I shook the onion soup mix up in the pkg before sprinkling in order to mix all the ingredients that settle in the bottoms of those packets. Chops turned out tender, and best of all for busy cook...they take care of themselves. Stick them in the oven and forget them till time for dinner.

Made it just as written, other than using just 4 boneless chops. I'm sure they would have been more moist if I used bone-in chops, but they were still very tender and delicious! I used plenty of seasoning salt on the chops and sprinkled it on the onions. Just using salt and pepper won't be as good, as seasoning salt has things like sugar, paprika, etc. I'll make this again!

OMG  This is so easy and delish!  My hubby doesn't care for pork chops, but loved these. Even my teenage son, who doesn't eat meat, liked this.  Is great with scalloped potatoes.  Thank you so much for the post.

Thank you for an easy pork chop recipe that doesn't contain soup.  The chops were so tender and delicious. I seared both sides of the chops before baking to seal in the juices.  I've also found this recipe works well in a crock pot. Thanks for sharing. We love this recipe.

I saw this recipe and thought that it had potential...however, i found it to be quite  tough and somewhat bland. I followed the directions exactly, and have no idea what went wrong. Also, the onions weren't at all finished when the pork was... i had to saute them in a pan on the stove to finish them off. I don't think I would make this again.

These chops were very moist and tastey.  I added some garlic salt for an extra flavor as well.

Super moist and tender, but something was missing.  They weren't very flavorful, as odd as that seems, with all the onions.  I would make again, but just experiment a little.

This turned out really good- I read the other reviews, so I was careful to use lots of season all and onions. I put in some dry onion soup mix as suggested by another reviewer, it gave it a nice flavour. We will try the BBQ sauce with it next time. I dont think i'll make it too often, but it's a great change from our usual dinners. You will have nice moist pork chops with this recipe.

My family is not big on pork chops. But this one had them going back for more. The trick here is the season salt. I went overboard with it because I was skeptical about the flavor. And it was not too much. I also added fresh chopped garlic. YUMMMMM!! We will make these again.

this was an awesome recipe after a few changes.  the pork chops i used had been marinated in adobo seasoning, salt, and peper.  after seeing a few comments about the lack of taste i decided to brown the prok chops in oil and garlic then pour the drippings over the chops once they were in the baking dish.  also, i used red wine with a splash of balsalmic vinegar instaed or water.

This was an easy way to make pork chops taste great! I think next time I may increase the cooking time so that the meat will fall off the bones like it did for others who tried it. Quick and easy! I'll use this instead of the standard "shake n bake"!

These were so tender and delicious.  My girls scraped the onions off but thought they were really good.  My husband really liked them too.

Great recipe! We modified it slightly to make it more New Mexican. Rather than using water we use red chile sauce! The pork chops are quite yummy by themselves, with calabacitas, with beans, or choppd up in a in a burrito or taco!
