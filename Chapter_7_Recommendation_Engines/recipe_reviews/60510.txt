I served this at a shower and finally wrote down the recipe, made copies and handed them out--that's how many times I was asked for the recipe.  It is delicious and also makes a beautiful presentation.  I used tub whipped topping--so if you make it exactly as written, it will be even better!  YUM!

Very rich, creamy sauce.  I tried it with coffee liquer instead of orange liquer, and I expect it would also be excellent with a touch of rum, vanilla liquer, irish cream, etc.  Try serving it in martini glasses.

I'm not sure why, but the cream mixture melted a lot and it turned out really soupy.  They tasted okay, but I will probably not make this again.

My family enjoyed this treat outdoors after a great meal - what a treat!  We've never had the "real" version so we didn't know the difference.  We all thought it was delicious and elegant served in wine glasses.  I'll definitely make it again when strawberries are in season!

Not as good as the original. I served this, and my guests were really disappointed.

This was "so-so" and certainly not worthy of serving to dinner guests.  It wasn't awful, but I won't use it again.

Didn't care for this one. It was too tart tasting and the flavors just didn't meld together. Look nice though in the parfait glasses.

We had this for dessert after a Valentine's Day meal.  It was the perfect finish!  Not too heavy, but still totally delicious and decadent.  Served in wine glasses-- it was really wonderful.

I love the use of sour cream. This is a great dessert for adult, very elegant and fitting the Romanov name. Thanks for sharing the idea of serving it in wine glasses. Will make it again for sure.
