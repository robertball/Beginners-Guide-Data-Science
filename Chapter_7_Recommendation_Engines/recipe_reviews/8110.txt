I have used this recipe several times. It is fool proof and always a hit.

This was such a good sauce for a fresh apple cake I made for my granddaughter's 20th birthday party.  We served it hot with Vanilla Ice Cream on top. The hard sauce made it so much better. I used Korbel Brandy instead of rum as that is all I had and it was so good with the Brandy.  I also heated the sauce in a sauce pan and then spooned a litte on each piece of cake.

The recipe just didn't come together taste wise. It will do in a pinch so I'm going to keep looking for something a little more tasty.

Not quite sure how this is a 'sauce.'  With 1 cup of butter that you whip the heck out of, it is more of a frosting.
