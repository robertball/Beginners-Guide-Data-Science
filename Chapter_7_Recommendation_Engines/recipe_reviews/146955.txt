This is my mother-in-law's recipe, but use basil and NO cilantro.  Very tasty and always a hit a pot lucks.

This is a good recipe IF you can tolerate Splenda.  I don't care for the taste of Splenda but hubby doesn't usually mind it.  This was a bit too much "Splenda" taste - even for him ....  I am rating this middle of the road, as it isn't a bad recipe, just not for us.

I swapped the Splenda out for regular old sugar and had to use oregano because I was out of tarragon but this is a yummy version of the classic!

I doubled the recipe, didn't use tarragon, cilantro or splenda.  Substituted regular sugar for the splenda.  Also, had no red wine vinegar so, since I doubled the recipe, I used 3/4c up red wine and white vinegar.  Mixed it all up, let it set overnight in the fridge, perfect.  Tastes like the salad my grandmother used to make.

I make this very often as a regular "supplement" to my diet in order to get more legumes in. I follow most of the recipe, cutting back slightly on oil and vinegar. But I have never added the sweetener. Why would I want my beans sweet when I can have them oh-so-savoury? Ditch the sweetener and you'll have a very healthy addition to any meal of the day.

The flavoring is very tasty but next time I am going to do only 1/4 C of Slpenda and 1/4 C sugar. Noticed the Slpenda after taste. I will also cut oil in half and put water in its place. Going to company picnic. I hope they enjoy it. My 2 yr loves it and keeps asking for "more"!!!

I have made this many times since finding this recipe.  My husband and I both love it! It is great for a high fiber diet.  I reduced the red wine vinegar to 1/2 cup, added 1/2 cup water, and reduced the oil to 1/4 cup.  It still tastes great, but makes fewer calories.

Excellent! and SO easy! I did use regular granulated sugar instead of Splenda. I didn't bother to "cook" the sugar/vinegar...just whisked it until the sugar disolved. I am not a huge fan of cilantro...so I reduced to just 1 teaspoon. Otherwise...did not make any other changes. Delicious.
