I grew up eating cookies similar to this, we called them "Aunt Edna's Sugar Cookies". Her recipe was slightly different, it calls for shortening rather than butter and uses confectioner's sugar for all of the sugar, not half granulated. When made this way, you get a cookie so airy and crisp it literally melts in your mouth.

Disappointing. I halved the recipe, maybe that was the beginning of my problems. The dough was so dry, it could barely be rolled out. There are much better recipes than this. Will not make these again!

I have been looking for this recipe. I use shortening insead of oil. If one would use an ice cream scoop to drop the cookies on to the sheet and a flat glass to flatten them (which has been dipped into a sugar and cinnamon mixture)the process is easier than rolling.  These cookies just barely have time to cool and become crisp before they are gone. There have been times that I have had to put the dough in the frig on warm day or when the kitchen is hot between baking time.

This is the only sugar cookie my daughter wants to make.  They are so good!  We frost them with a powdered sugar & water glaze, and decorate them for school parties with colored sugar to match the holiday.  This is a terrific, easy recipe. Note though that the ingredients are not listed in the order they are used, so read the directions carefully!

I made one small change - I swapped out the vegetable oil and used coconut oil.  Wow, they were fantastic!!!  They tasted buttery, crispy, but with a little tropical twist.  Highly recommended!

Wylie,  I am 8 years old. I baked the cookies by myself! They were so good! My mom, dad and my little brother loved them, too! They thanked me for thinking of sugar cookies!

I halved the recipe and they came out AWESOME.  I've been looking for sometime for a recipe that would mimic those Pillsbury sugar cookies with the holiday pictures in the middle...those are SO good, never could find a recipe that came close.  This one is about as close as I need to get! Delicious! I substituted Sweetex shortening for the oil and people thought I had bought them commercially, they didn't believe I made them! Excellent!

Thank you so much for posting this recipe.  My mom had a recipe in her recipe box that I used for years.  After I moved away, the recipe was lost.  One day I came across this site and decided to see if I could find a recipe that matched the one I remembered.  If you do a search on sugar cookies, 119 come up and yours is on the last page.  It was the only one that was even close.  The cookies are great!  Thanks again, Tami.

This is the best sugar cookie I've ever had, let alone made from scratch.  They remind me of the cookies I had from a bakery in my childhood.  I love a good sprinkle sugar cookie (non pareils), so I dipped the rounded balls of dough in regular granulated sugar on one side and the other side, I dipped into the sprinkles.  Then I flattened out with the bottom of a glass.  They were so good!!  I will be making this recipe for years to come.  Tonya

If your looking for that cookie that will set off your Holiday cookie plate, look no further! These cookies were so easy, and the directions were simple. The hardest part was waiting 3 hours for the dough to chill. Ignore the single star rating's those people probably can't boil water. This recipe is a keeper if your into quick and easy but not compromising taste.

I made these for halloween, but when i was balling them to dip into the sprinkles i noticed they were very oily. I have worked with sugar cookies less oily than these but they were still great.

I don't even LIKE sugar cookies, but made these because I was out of molasses for my usual cookie recipe.  When I couldn't talk my hubby into trying one fresh from the oven, I broke down and ate one.  (he doesn't like sugar cookies either)  As seen by my rating, it was DELICIOUS.  My kids, 6 and 10, gave each 2 thumbs up.  Only the best recipes make it into my 'keeper' book, and this one made it on the first round.  I followed the recipe exactly.  The only itty bitty suggestion I could make is that they are a touch saltier than some might like, so you could cut the salt back to 3/4 tsp.  Great recipe.  Thanks for sharing and Merry Christmas!

Loved these cookies. Be carefull about refrigerating the dough however. If you leave the dough in to long it becomes very difficult to work with.

Wow!!  Amazing raw sugar cookie dough, which is a great start. I subbed shortening for the oil and left out cream of tarter (another reviewer said you can't tell).  I also didn't spend refrigerator time. Just use a large spoon to make "balls" and roll in sugar. Press the glob with a glass. Perfect. Delicious. Keeper recipe.
--- anyone who rates this less than 4 has a serious baking issue (can't measure, mixed flour for sugar?, no telling)......powdered sugar + milk = perfect icing :)

This is the same recipe passed down for many years with my ex-mother-in-laws side of the family. It is the only sugar cookie recipe we make in my family.IF you use 1 cup of shortening instead of oil them do make the best rolled sugar cookies. I even use the butter flavored shortening sometimes. Also don't roll too thin or they will not come out soft when you bake them.

These are amazing and so very delicious.  I have made these 3 times in the past 3 weeks.  Does anyone know if you can freeze the dough or if  the cookies  can be frozen after they have been baked? I did use Crisco shortening instead of the vegetable oil.  Thank you for sharing recipe

Made recipe w/ intent to roll out dough rather shape into balls. Cutting w/ 3-inch 5-point star,  1/4-1/2 inch thick, I made about 80 cookies. Dough was somewhat sticky (expected it to with all the butter/oil in it), but easy to work with. Woody’s Sheriff Badge cookies (decorated from family.com) were gobbled by the children at the birthday party. Made extras to keep at home, freezing for future use.  Next time will try applesauce in place of butter and use almond or rootbeer flavoring instead of vanilla. Thanks, Robin, for sharing with us.

I don't know whats up with this recipe. I made it twice. The first time, I tried reducing it using the allrecipies calculator- I only wanted to make half. This recipe does not reduce, the dough turned out way to powdery. The second time I made it, I made it exactly as it reads. The dough was sooooo greasy! usually, sugar cookie dough is more manageable, but this is just crazy greasy. I won't make these again, but if I did, I would cut the veg oil down to only 1/2 or 1/4 cup instead of a full cup. Its just toooooo much.

Hi Robin I just made your sugar cookies yesterday and they turned out delicious.  I am going to forward the recipe to my grandaughter because she is a baker like me. They won't last until Christmas so will have to make some more.  Thanks

These cookies were loved by my family. I didn't use the cream of tartar and instead of confectioners sugar, I doubled the white sugar. It felt oily before baking but turned out great. My son had fun with the cookie cutters and my kids and husband ate half the cookies within the first hour.

YUM! Followed the recipe exactly and they came out amazing.  The person with the dry comment clearly made a mistake.  I used a cookie scoop to place the balls on the baking tray, then flattened them with the bottom of a cup dipped in sugar.  They are superb on their own, as well as with icing.

Love them made these for my sis and I loved them. Be careful when you add the butter, sugar e.t.c. because it will be really hard to beat.

Spectacular!! My first attempt at sugar cookies, ever...and they turned out just perfect. I even forgot the salt! oops....but they turned out wonderfully. They really do need to be dipped in the sugar, to make them sweeter. I added some sugar cookie frosting on these and they were absolutely delectable. I wish the directions were a little clearer, but other than that, perfect recipe. These cookies were gone FAST. Not sure why there are any negative ratings on this one...

These are fabulous sugar cookies! Light and butter with a lovely texture. I am ashamed to say I didn't get the "108 servings" the recipe said it would yeild.  I made the cookies much bigger and am going to make some vanilla/candy cane ice cream to make ice cream sandwiches with them.

My mother in law passed this recipe down to me.  It is the Best!! The cookies are so nice and short.  She added an additional 4 teaspoons of flour to the 4 cups asked for.  Now I wonder if I really need those extra 4 tsps.?? ;)  This recipe make a really nice Big Batch!!

Super yummy cookies. The reason for only 4 stars is because they are incredibly delicate. If you're looking to pack these as a gift or even ship them they will not servive. I brought some to work and they didnt even make the 5 mile trip. They were crumbles of yummyness when I opened up the tupperware.

I made this recipe, but I used 1/2 cup of oil, and I used 2 tsp of vanilla.  I made the batter the night before christmas, and refrigerated the batter overnight.  I rolled out the dough the next afternoon, and it was so easy to work with.  I used this recipe for christmas cookies.  I cut them out, baked them 350* for 8 min, and they were perfect. I frosted and decorated them and served them to family on christmas day.  My family loved them and they took some home with them, and the rest were gone by bedtime.  I was weary about this recipe because of some of the reviews, but I am so glad I used it, and will use it again next year.  We love that these cookies were soft and not hard and crunchy.

I searched and searched for a great sugar cookie recipe, and I've found it! These sugar cookies turned out beautiful! I was a bit nervous about adding 1 cup of oil so I used 1/2 a cup of olive oil and wow they still turned out amazing! I bet they would still have been perfect if I did the full cup. I will definately make these cookies again and again. It comes at such a perfect time of the year that I found this cuz today was my pre Christmas baking day. I can't wait to make these in a few weeks. I would love to make shapes and decorate them with icing next time to add some fun for my 2 year old daughter :) Thank you a zillion times over. P.S the people that said they were  are dead wrong, they probably don't know how to bake lol!

I'm deleting my entire review from April 3, 2014 to update it four and a half years later. As is, the recipe is pretty good. What I don't like is how sticky the dough is. It's not suitable for rolling and cutting. I thought it had too much oil so subbed it out  for all butter. My results were very dry cookies. So I subbed half of the oil for an extra stick of butter and it was the same thing. The amount is important for soft, moist cookies.

After using this recipe for so long, I made some of my own changes. To combat the oiliness, I use an extra cup of flour. This makes the cookies a bit softer after they're baked and a bit easier to work with; I can roll it out to cut into with cookie cutters. I roll out sheets of dough between parchment then freeze them for a bit before cutting, otherwise I can't roll or bake shapes at all.

I use about a tablespoon of vanilla (preferably homemade) and a tablespoon of buttery emulsions. They're good without the emulsion and extra vanilla but with them, these cookies are OMG amazing. I also like to add a bit of  vanilla flavored sugar (also homemade) when I'm creaming the sugars and fats together. 

I use these cookies for my little business that I'm just starting and have gotten nothing but positive comments about them. Thanks for the recipe! I'm sure I'll be using it for years to come!

These turned out great!  They are not super sweet, went great with coffee! I did decorate half of them and they were awesome!  I cut the recipe in half also and it turned out fine.  I even had to leave the dough in the fridge overnight and it wasnt a problem.  I tasted the dough before I baked it and it tasted kind of salty so it had me worried, but once they were baked we did not taste the salt.  I think these may be the best sugar cookies ive ever had!

This is very much like my mother's recipe, only instead of vegetable oil, she used buttery oil.  I guess this was something you could find in the supermarked in the 70's.  I have found that buttery oil popcorn topping works really well and tastes better, but I don't put as much in.  I use about 1/4 cup of this along with 1 3/4 cups of butter.

This recipe was easy to make, and took no time at all once I got going. Some of my cookies were crumbly, and they smelled like they were burning only 5 minutes after cooking. I put mine in the oven for only 9 minutes and they were done. However, I think it's fair to mention that I have a gas oven and cooking times did vary between 8-10 minutes per batch. Other than that, these cookies were pretty good tasting, and they will be even better once I get the frosting on them :)

I always say I love to cook and hate to bake, but I needed sugar cookies for the start of a new school year and found this recipe.  Very easy to make and they turned out great.  Hints: make sure you do put the dough in the fridge and definitely press the cookies down if you like flatter results.

Great sugar cookies. Very light crunchy, fragile and delicious.  I’m an amateur baker, so I followed the recipe to the T except I added a half teaspoon more of vanilla. Cookies flatten out on their own while baking so easy on pushing down on glass dipped in sugar (spray glass with cooking spray often to get sugar to stick). Get as much sugar to stick on top of cookie for better sweetness if you like baked glazed sugar. Other wise if not enough just coat after baking but I like the baked sugar taste better. Make a small as you can because they do flatten out during baking. This one is my favorite sugar cookie recipe by far.  And I have tried many. I’m crispy cookie fan not a soft one.

Overly sweet with little to no flavor. These cookies have a very odd texture. Also, the dough is very sticky and hard to roll out. I also tried the icing used on the cookies it is the same overly sweet taste and a gritty texture.

I used margarine and shortening; always use margarine in baking. This is a wonderful cookie. Not easy to roll, but I rolled into balls and pressed with a fork.

This is the best sugar cookie recipe I have tried. I didn't have cream of tarter so I didn't use it and I heard other can didn't use it so I figured it was OK. Used half the oil. Shortening instead of butter. And it says chill 3 hours. I didn't chill at all and it was great.

I tried this with all regualar sugar it was so oily and gross. Do Not Do This. After adding more flour I think it worked out ok.
