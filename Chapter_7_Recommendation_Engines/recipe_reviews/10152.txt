I've been baking cookies for more than 45 years, and this is the absolute best gingerbread cookie I have ever tried.  The dough handled beautifully, required no chilling and didn't spread in the oven. They taste wonderful, too.  The icing recipe included is also good, though I had to add more milk to make it go through the decorator without effort.  If higher humidity makes the dough sticky (which I doubt will happen with this recipe) you can always roll it between sheets of parchment paper and freeze it.  It will be easy to cut almost straight out of the freezer.  Works with any roll-out cookie dough.  If all else failed, you could make drop cookies.  Throw out cookie dough?  Not in this lifetime!

I have made Gingerbread cookies before because I love the taste of molasses.  Those were very sharp and I was the only one who really liked them.  This recipe is easy!  The gingerbread dough is very stiff, and I used my mixer with the dough hooks to mix.  It has a lovely mild taste that is spicy enough for me, yet my husband loves these cookies too.  It will be a Christmas regular for the rest of my days!!!!!

These cookies were incredibly good!  We didn't use them as ornaments, just made them to decorate and eat.  The first batch didn't even make it to decorating, we just gobbled them up!  This dough was the best for cutouts.  I chilled it for only a half hour and it was wonderful.  I think if you changed the name of the recipe to Christmas Cookie Cutouts you would have a ton of rave reviews- I don't think enough people are finding this gem of a cookie recipe :)  Thanks for the new favorite!

Very good! I made gingerbread people out of this recipe and they turned out great. The only thing is that although the recipe says it'll make about 12, it made 3 dozens. I'm glad I didn't double up the recipe as I had planned initially!

These are delicious! Not overly spicy. Everyone loves them, from my toddler to my mother. I generally make these with decorator's frosting, which makes them easy to stack. They are absolutely adorable on the Christmas tree this year, too. If you roll them a bit thicker and cook for the low range of time, they are soft and delicious. Roll them a bit thinner, and cook for the entire recommended time (or maybe even a bit longer) and they're hard enough to make ornaments - just make the holes before you bake!

Great and easy recipe, even my 3-year old enjoyed rolling out the dough.  we made dinosaur footprints on regular cookie circles and stamped faces of his favorite cartoons, and they baked great!

I made changes to the spices though, because i only used what i had at the moment...i used grated fresh ginger instead of the powdered and changed the nutmeg to freshly ground cloves.  The molasses i used was the Billington's Molassess unrefined cane sugar, and it worked very well.

Great recipe to begin with, i can't wait to experiment and just use freshly grated lemon and orange rind in leiu of the spices for a more refreshing taste.  Thank you for this recipe!

These are a great holiday treat. But you don't have to stop at Christmas ornaments  - make all kinds of designs.

Great flavor and texture.  Nice and soft.  I tried them for tree ornaments and they didn't work too well, some of them broke.  Could have been all the icing the kids used.  YUMMY! (4 stars cause they broke)

This is an excellent ginger bread cookie recipe.  As others have noted, the flavor is not as sharp as some ginger bread recipes so expect a soft, delicate flavor.  I did not refrigerate my dough, but rolled it out immediately after making it and I had no problems with the cut-outs not holding their shapes.  I rolled between two bamboo skewers to get a perfect 1/8" thickness and the cookies turned out great.  Slightly firm, but still soft enough to be delicious.  Definitely a keeper!  Thank you.

I agree it's a great solid cookie.  Texture was perfect.  I used Karo syrup instead of molasses, and 2tsp. of Oriental spice instead of all the other spices.  Came out to be a perfect cookie to have with a cup of tea.  I would make again.

These cookies were so good! My dough ended up not being moist enough so I had to add an extra 1/8 of a cup of butter then it was perfect.

This is my new favorite cookie. Thank you so much for sharing. The only thing I did different was to use lemon flavoring in the icing (that is what my grandmother always flavored her gingerbread men with). Absolutely perfect, my kids loved making them and my husband AND kids loved eating them! Thank you again!

This is my favorite gingerbread cookie recipe. My daughter and I make them every year. I sometimes have to add a bit more butter, but you can roll them right out and bake them.

I have made this many times.  We love making this for our annual Valentine party so the kids can decorate the cookies.  The flavor is not too strong and not too sweet.  I roll them thicker so you get a soft cookie instead of crisp.

great cookie recipe. the gingerbread taste without too much spice. I did have to use milk to thin the frosting but no big deal. my kids were doing the decorating so I didn't want the frosting too stiff to easily pipe for small hands

I made this for Christmas Eve (for Santa) and my kids and husband loved these. These were absolutely fantastic. I'm sure Santa loved them too. We've made them 3 times since.  Great recipe.

I made no changes, dough was crumbly at first but easy to work with once rolled. Excellent taste, will make again.
