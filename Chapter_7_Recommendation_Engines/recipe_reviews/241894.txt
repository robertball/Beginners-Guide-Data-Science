I used same basic idea but instead of pound cake i used brownies cut into tiny cubes to fit more in and prepared chocolate pudding instead  of the ice cream topping because i had those ingredients on hand.  Simple to make, impressive  presentation and delicious!

This was a big hit with everyone at our family dinner party.  I did substitute angel food cake for the pound cake, and it worked well.

Was a great success. Couldn't find pound cake at the time so I used the small short cakes instead and it was still a delicious desert. Will definitely make this again.
