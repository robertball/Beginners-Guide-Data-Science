This is a great recipe, after a few modifications. I turned it into a casserole and diced the chicken. I found that there was not enough 'extras' so I doubled the salsa, rice, water, and soup. Make sure that you cook the rice first or you will get very crunchy rice! This is an easy casserole to make and very delicious!

I make this using a 16 oz. jar of salsa, a can of corn, a cup of black beans and top with a mexican cheese blend.  I serve it with tortilla chips and the kids can't get enough of it!  They actually cheer when I tell them it's Chicken Fiesta night. It's also good reheated.

I liked this recipe quite a bit just because it was different. i had some chicken i needed to use up and it seemed to fill us up. I followed the directions to the tee and my rice DID cook thoroughly because i let it cook 20 minutes extra due to other reviewers saying the rice was undercooked, and to my dismay the dish was a little dry. 10-15 minutes extra is best for sure. Anyway, I grilled the chicken in taco flavoring and I only had a half cup of salsa so I added one medium sized diced tomato that i sprinkled with the taco flavor as well. On the top of the dish I also added monteray jack and colby cheese along with crushed tortilla chips. My fiance ate the 3/4 of the dish by himself he liked it so much!

I added some black beans and everyone in my family really liked it. Soooo easy to make, but the rice didn't cook all the way according to the directions, even with an additional ten minutes of cook time I still thought it wasn't quite done. Next time I make it I will probably cook the rice a little bit before adding it.

My husband really enjoys this recipe. The only things we change are omitting the cheese (to be a little healthier) and cutting up the chicken, so it's more like a casserole. Definitely worth making!

My family loved this!  I did alter it a bit by adding a rinsed can of black beans.  While one of us ate it as it was, the rest of us cut up the chicken, put it all in flour tortillas and topped with sour cream! Per their request I have made it twice in 2 weeks!

Yummy!!! This is a very simple recipe that I tried because I did not know what to make for dinner and had all of the ingredients. It was definitely worth it and will stay on my list of recipes to continue to cook.

I've made this three times now and it has been a hit each time. The most recent time was for a potluck -- everyone asked for the recipe because even the toddlers loved it.  I  have made it both ways and the casserole is the best. I used shredded chicken, which I added taco seasoning on the stove to give it more flavor. I also stirred in a half cup of fat free sour cream and some cheese into the dish. One time I added black beans and another I went with refried beans. Both were well received, though I liked the refried beans the best.  Topped with a little extra cheese and it was absolutely delightful.

This recipe is sooooo easy.  I don't precook the rice, but I do add and extra 1/2 cup of water before tossing it in the oven.  I dice the chicken, double the rice, and also add a chopped onion and a sweet red pepper, just for colour.  I've also played with the cheese blend, using whatever I have in the fridge.  All this fits nicely into a 9 x 13 pan covered with foil.  VERY EASY recipe.  Thanks

This was a quick and easy weeknight dinner!  I chose to cook the chicken prior to assembling the casserole and add a can of black beans.  I cooked the chicken on the grill to speed up the oven time.  It cut the time to 25 min.  We ate it in tortillas with additional salsa and sour cream!  Yum!

The rice mixture was really good, but the chicken was bland.  Next time, I'll cube the chicken and make it more of a casserole type dish, and hopefully give the chicken more flavor.

Turned out really yummy although next time I think I will add some fresh tomato and black beans as someone recommended. Maybe some cilantro to give it a really fresh taste. As far as the problems with the rice cooking completely... Try adding another 1/4 cup water to the recipe and covering it for the first 45 min. in the oven. Then uncover and put some cheese over the top and let it cook for 10-15 more minutes.. The rice cooked completely this way. Oh, I also used individually frozen chicken breasts and used them frozen.

I made this for my husband and me late one evening.  It is so easy. I tried to follow the recipe, but it did not have enough rice.  I just added some leftover rice in the fridge, so it was pre-cooked. It is so tasty and it will be just as amazing tomorrow.

After reading some of the reviews I cooked a cup of rice in the rice cooker. I had whole chicken breast with rib. So I deboned and removed skin then cut chicken in to chunks. I had a pack of fajita seasoning so I seasoned my chicken with that. When I made my sauce I added chili sauce alone with some taco bell taco sauce. Topped with herbs and a litte cheese. I only cooked for 35 minuted. Tasted great!

I have made this dish several times and have never had a problem with the rice being undercooked or hard.  (Maybe that's because I usually add a few extra minutes to ensure the breasts are cooked all the way through!)  I usually omit the corn and instead add sliced jalepenos for a kick!  The oils from the jalepenos come out during cooking, so the rice gets really spicy!

This was pretty good. I cut the chicken breasts into small pieces so it was more of a casserole, and I used a southwest salsa. Next time I will add some cumin along with the paprika.

I made this recipe according to directions except I added brown rice. The rice was HARD so you do need to cook the rice 1st. I will make again adding as others suggested more rice and corn. I also cooked the boned, skin on chicken 1st (in a cooking bag) and cut it up and added instead of whole breast as used in recipe. It was good except the rice was hard. I will make again.

The combination of cream of chicken soup with salsa creates a very unappetizing color. After it was fully cooked, the color had not improved and was  visually unappealing. The taste was ok.  Additionally, the chicken breasts were very bare and undercooked-looking.  I added garlic salt, pepper, and fresh parsely for some color and flavor, then broiled the whole dish for a couple of minutes to brown the cheese.  It looked better .. but I won't be making this one again! My husband thought it was OK. I did not care for this recipe.

This pretty good.  My family doesn't like spicy so I substituted the salsa for diced tomatoes and added black beans.  I also chopped the chicken into cubes for easier eating. 
There are three things I will do differently next time: 
1. Use instant rice, not long grain.  It was unevenly  cooked so some still had crunch.
2. Add sliced spanish olives for a little extra zip.
3. Add a top layer of tortilla strips for proper crunch.  
Otherwise, my family was pleased, as was I.

This was really easy to make and tasty!  I made a few small modifications because I found that the rice didn't cook fully when following the directions. I cooked this recipe at 350 degrees covered tightly with tin foil for an hour, then I removed the tinfoil and cooked it an additional 10 to 15 minutes uncovered. Once it's done I sprinkled the cheese over it and let it cool for a couple of minutes. I also added some avocado slices for garnish and mixed in a dollop of sour cream which adds great flavor. I also added the same amount of seasoned black beans as you would corn along with the rest of the ingredients which adds some extra spice. Enjoy!

Minor changes with what I had on hand. Added a bit more water and baked for 15 minutes longer.

The flavor was great, but my rice didn't cook all the way.  I'm willing to try it again with extra water for the rice, or cooked rice added at the end.  :D  I did add a little extra salsa.  Garnish with cilantro for a really nice meal.  YUM

Really great simple recipe with things I have on hand usually. I did dice my chicken as well, made leftovers the next day much esier. It is simple but that's what makes it great. It's good alone and has plenty of room to change things around to what you like. It is definitely something I will make fairly often.

3.5 stars in my book.  It's a great start...but kind of bland as is.  I added more salsa before it went in the oven....and more at the table, as well as topping it with chopped jalapenos.  After reading a number of reviews, I did pre-cook the rice, perhaps I should have cooked it in something other than water to add some depth to the recipe?  Maybe some taco seasoning mixed in with everything?  I'm not sure, but I will revisit this recipe.  It's things that I always have on hand, and I really think with some tweaking, it could be a 5 star recipe

This was really good.  I did have to cook it longer (I made it for 6 people and so did it in a 9x13) and some of the rice was a little bit crunchy.  However, the flavour was delicious.

I liked it, but my husband didn't. He thought 1) it was too spicy and 2)it would be better as a side dish. I kind of agree with #2. Take out the chicken and you've got an awesome rice side.

We thought that this was great.Although we made a few changes. We put in rotel instead of the picante sauce.  We also put green beans in. A little spicy, but good!

I used two cups of cooked brown rice. I also sprinkled the chicken with taco seasoning instead of paprika, but it was still on the bland side. I cut the chicken breast in half, lenghtwise to increase the serving size and to speed up cooking time, but it still took 45 minutes.  I also dumped in a can of pinto beans, but I think black beans would look better. Mine came out more soupy than I expected, but I think that has to do with the cooked rice and fluid ratio. Needs a little tweaking.

I first ate this dish when I had dinner at a friends house. The rice was a bit crunchy ;but it was delicious! I did the recipe as is but (learning from what my friend experienced)I cooked the rice before baking and I added some garlic salt, cumin, chili powder ;and paprika to the chicken and cut it into cubes to make it as a casserole. I doubled up on the rice, soup, and Picante sauce, and I added two cups of black beans. I toped it with Mexican mixed cheese and baked for give or take 20 minutes. MUY DELICIOSO!!

I've made this a few times and I love it. My family enjoyed this dish. I liked it because it was easy to make and very tasty, especially with chicken that I had already cooked and seasoned. I'd recommend using mild salsa for this, and possibly adding a bit of cornmeal to the crust for more authentic southwest flavor.
