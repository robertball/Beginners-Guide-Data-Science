This was good, of course. I used one small really ripe frozen banana. I'm not sure what the recipe submitter considers a "scoop" of ice cream, but 5 scoops would be way too much for me for one serving, even a big one. My single-serve Ninja could only handle 3 scoops. Some recipes call for way too much milk, but 1/2 cup  was just right. I didn't see the need for any extra sugar. Thanks for the recipe.

I agree with the previous reviewer who commented on the 5 scoops of ice cream. I only added about how much I would have in a regular serving, ~1/2 to 1 cup. I had to add more milk to get the blender going (don't have a Magic Bullet), and it still came out quite thick. I also added 1 scoop of mocha-cappucino protein powder. Delicious and filling drink!
