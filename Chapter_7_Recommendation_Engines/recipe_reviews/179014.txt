Great way to replace the oil and still have a moist cake.  There is no sign of tomato soup in the taste!  My husband loved it.

I've never made tomato Soup cake before - it is the most delicious, moist, light tasty cake that my 82 yr. old mother thinks should win awards.  She was going on and on about it.  Great with Cream Cheese Frosting II.

This is a great recipe who would of thought you could replace oil for tomato soup great tasting and very moist wish I would of seen this sooner. I might try this with choc cake mix.

Very moist and delicious. Made them for Mother's Day and iced with Betty Crocker whipped cream cheese frosting (I was pressed for time!); they were a HUGE hit. Fed the leftovers to my coworkers and not one could tell there was tomato soup in it. Printing it out to keep. :)

These have a definate tomato soup "twang" to them. If you're looking for a substitute for oil...stick with applesauce. : )

Made this cake for the first time today to take to a family meal to serve as dessert. When it was baking it filled the house with an amazing aroma that was wafting from the oven. The cake came out perfect. It was moist and delicious. I used a whipped cream cheese frosting. I have a busy life and don't always have time to make things from "scratch" so this fit the bill perfectly!

My grandson, who  claims he hates tomatoes, just LOVES, this cake. This is my first time baking it. I made cream cheese frosting from scratch to go with it. I like that you don't have to add oil or butter  to  this, and it comes out very moist. This recipe is a KEEPER.

This was very moist and yummy. I gave it four stars because I think the tomato soup made it salty, which wasn't awful, but I didn't care for it. I used a store brand, so I wonder if that contributed to the problem. I didn't notice any other reviews with that complaint. I will try again with Campbell's or maybe even a lower sodium variation.

Have been enjoying this cake since I was a youngster - Mom made it often and I have continued the tradition. Sometimes I add about 1/4 tsp of pumpkin pie spice  to the batter, and about 1/2 cup of choc.chips to each pan (dust them with flour and sprinkle on top of batter-they will sink into the center of each layer as they bake). Don't worry-no one will know there is tomato soup in the cake - just is a spicy moist cake.

I used chocolate cake and it was good. Nothing amazing, but it was good.

I guess if you are trying to cut down this is an alternative, but it has a weird after taste.  I do a lot of low fat/low sugar coooking and there are lot better substitutes than this one.  I wouldn't waste the time making it again.

I've always made my tomato soup cake from scratch so I was pretty excited to see this "shortcut"!  All I added was some raisins.  Delicious!  Thanks for the time-saver =)

Fantastic recipe.  I made cupcakes for my husband's potluck at work & he said the cupcakes were the best!
