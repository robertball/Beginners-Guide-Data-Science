These are softer than typical scones, due to the pumpkin. Tasted great with a cup of coffee this morning. I used only all-purpose flour (because I didn't have any wheat flour on hand), and skipped the raisins (as the kids don't like them in scones). Other than that, I followed the recipe, including brushing them with the optional egg white wash before baking. I did add a caramel/cinnamon drizzle on top (powdered sugar, 1/4 tsp caramel flavoring and 1/4 tsp cinnamon, thinned out with a few teaspoons of milk to get the right "drizzle" consistency). Thanks for the recipe!

I made these with puréed over ripe fuyu persimmons instead of pumpkin and they came out fabulous. Family devoured them!

I’ve made this a couple times now-just like the recipe says. It’s perfect. I’ve been baking them in a pie plate for the shape, but they have to bake a little longer because they’re thick. Absolutely delicious.
