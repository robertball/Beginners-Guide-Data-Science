My husband, who is from southern India, found this recipe and asked me to prepare it.  This is fabulous!  I added 11 fresh green chiles rather than just 4, since we love spicy dishes.  Also, I didn't have whole peppercorns on hand, so I just used 2 teaspoons of ground black pepper.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I found it bland compared to the real Chicken Chettinad. Need to add, cloves, red chili powder,  scraped/grated coconut and increase the curry leaves.
