This was really wonderful!  I did change it just a little.  I cooked the chicken in a little olive oil and poltry seasoning.  I also used 4 cloves of garlic.  I used a blender instead of a food processer because I was afraid of the texture.  The sause was smooth and creamy, I would never have known it was a lower fat recipe.  My family loved it!!!

This recipe tastes OK, but is very easy and is healthiest white sauce I have found.  I will make it again.  If you are looking for a very creamy, traditional alfredo sauce then find a recipe with cream because you won't be happy with this low-cal substitute.

This was a very good recipe. I had a couple of changes, but nothing too major. I didn't have any flour, so I used Chicken frying mix (which is mostly flour base with seasonings). And I also added McCormickâ€™s Chicken seasoning while it was simmering.  This combo adds flavor and complements the chicken very well. I didn't have to add any salt. My family enjoyed! Thanks for sharing.

This was a fantastic, virtually guilt-free, base sauce!  I embellished with the spices as other reviewers did & added sauteed onions and bell peppers (omitted minced onion), and boy was it rich!  I doubt anyone could tell it wasn't heavy cream!  Tip:  Remember to adjust your sauce accordingly when adding more pasta &/or vegetables to recipe -- I didn't and ended up short on sauce -- better to err on the side of too much in my book ; )  Bon Appetite friends!

A good facsimile of the real thing...but needed a little more of a zing, I thought.  Perhaps a sharper cheese?  I added chicken and sauteed mushrooms to mine...yummy!

Not bad at all. I used ground chicken which gave it a weird texture; next time I'll use cubed like the recipe calls for. The kids ate it and my man had no complaints.

For low calorie, I don't think this can be beat. The sauce was a little bit chalky for my tastes, but my husband couldn't even tell it wasn't the real thing. I don't know if the chalky-ness was the flour, or if I warmed it too long... I just kept waiting for it to get thick, and it never did! The flavor was excellent, though, and I will try this again using cornstarch ? or something instead of the flour and less milk.

Yum.  Great option for a low fat, but still creamy alfredo.  I used leftover chicken and seasoned it up with some italian seasoning.  Quick & tasty!

I love Alfredo sauce, but it's usually so unhealthy.  This recipe is a terrific solution!  Made it as directed, but was liberal with spices.

Super simple and really delicious! I was a bit reluctant to try it at first but it makes a really nice creamy sauce. I just add a little extra garlic other than that the recipe is great!

I really liked this for a quick weeknight dinner.  I sauteed the chicken strips in olive oil and garlic.  Did everything else in the recipe the same.  It would be excellent with mushrooms in the sauce too.  I will make this again.  I was craving cream sauce and this is a lower fat sauce.  I had Penne pasta which held the sauce nicely too.

I really wanted to like this.  Really.  It's so healthy plus so easy...how can you go wrong!?  Taste, unfortunately.  It just tasted...sour.  Even adding more garlic power and onion as others recommended for flavor..it was just off.  I won't be making this again.

I sauteed a whole onion with some minced garlic in butter, then gently stirred in the pureed ingredients. I used whole wheat pasta and fresh grated parmesan. I also sprinkled a little fresh parm over the top when serving. My husband and oldest abhor cottage cheese but inhaled this. The rest of us enjoyed this as well.

I recommend doubling the sauce--there really wasn't enough to cover the pasta the first time, but it worked better the second time after I doubled it.  The sauce never quite seemed to thicken for me either--my mom recommends I boil it rather than merely heat it as the recipe says.  I'll try that next time.  The flavor is a little bland too, but this is a good base recipe that I'll definitely expiriment with.

Good recipe considering the low fat element, but shouldnt really be compared to true alfredo sauce as the flavor and texture was much different. Bonus points for ease though. Substituted Quorn(TM) for the chicken for a vegetarian meal.

Thanks for this alfredo recipe, it's different.  I made it as written except I used 1/2 c yogurt and 3/4 c chicken broth instead of milk due to an allergy and I doubled the parmesan.  Very flavorful and healthier than most alfredo recipes.

This was so fast and easy to make and it was soooo delicious.  I changed the minced onion for minced garlic instead (didn't have any minced onion) and loved the taste!

This stuff was okay, pretty bland.  With a few modifications it could be good, but if you're looking for a real, creamy alfredo, don't try this.  This is good either for a quick dinner or using low-fat alternatives.  I ended up using more pepper, some italian seasoning, and some fresh parsley on the top for flavor.

This worked well for a lower-fat alfredo sauce. I made the sauce ahead of time and refrigerated it for a few hours.  I was definitely heavy-handed with the parmesan cheese.

I make this sauce often, and have enjoyed it from the beginning.  It goes without saying that it's delicious on any type of pasta, and is a much healthier alternative than creamier sauces.

I was not really impressed with this recipe.  It had a sweet flavor to it and did not taste at all like alfredo.  I added a ton more Parmesan, some garlic powder, and tossed in a packet of Knorr pesto mix.  After my additions it was good, but still not worth the effort.

Ok. So I had 2 thawed chicken breasts my wife wanted me to make but I am sick of the Foreman grill and the standard baked chicken! She's kind of a health nut, so I went searching for recipes here (as always). I came across this one and noticed that I had FF cottage cheese, and all of the other recipes except the noodles.... all I had were bowtie pasta noodles which work out really well for this recipe. I loved the flavor and consistency of the sauce, but I really like garlic so the only thing I added to the recipe was 2 cloves of garlic. I put them in whole and let the processor do the work! Not the best chicken alfredo I've made, but definitely very easy and tasty!!! It took less than 15 minutes to put everything together and we were seated at the table! Thank you~

I used more garlic powder (as always) and half of a small onion. I always substitute whole wheat flour as well. I used some leftover smoked chicken breasts (about 1 cup) and some broccoli (about 2 cups) steamed w/ lemon juice. Mixed in the meat and veggie w/ the sauce. I served this over some spinach fett. Everyone loved this and my ten year old daughter wanted it for lunch the next day. My husband does not like cottage cheese either, but he liked this. I will definately make this again.

Excellent, easy, and the healthiest Alfredo recipe I have ever seen. I have also made this with vegetables instead of chicken and turned out great.

we enjoyed this recipe.. i'm lactose intolerant but i can eat most types of cheese.. i used a blender like BANGERS did (i don't own a food processor).. replaced soy milk for regular milk, added more garlic powder and a lot more parm, forgot the onion (doh!) and used chicken sausage instead of breast meat.. i really can't compare this to true alredo sauce since i'm not familiar with it.. but bf said it was close.. ty for the recipe

I modified the recipe slightly by using 1 tbsp in place of the garlic powder and salt/pepper. I also added 2 tbsp of butter with sauteed red peppers and mushrooms, and omitted the onion. It was delicious.

This was great!  I cut up two chicken breasts, seasoned them with italian seasoning and cooked them with the onions in some olive oil, then added it to the sauce.  I also added some chopped fresh basil to each plate which put this over the top.  Great recipe, thanks!

I have made this recipe many times since discovering it here on Allrecipes last year.  We LOVE it.  It's a very healthy alternative to a heavy alfredo sauce dish.  It doesn't taste like a full fat recipe, so don't expect that.  But if you are used to eating lighter, I bet you will enjoy this simple recipe. I do add more seasoning...like many others mentioned, just play around with the recipe with spices you like.

This is a good recipe for being "quick and easy". You will have to season it to your own taste, as it is kind of bland if you do not deviate from the recipe posted. Just play around with it, you will get it. I also added some Parsley for looks. I will upload a picture soon.

I added some broccoli and used penne pasta. I didn't have a problem with the sauce being too thin like some other reviewers. I just wasn't crazy about the taste-- just a little strange. My husband said he thought it was OK, but didn't go back for seconds or eat the leftovers...

I had some cooked chicken breasts and cottage cheese, but not much else--so this recipe let me put dinner on the table.  Everyone liked it pretty well.  When I first added in the pasta, it was runny, but by the end of dinner, the leftovers had thickened nicely.  Next time, we will leave a little time for it to thicken before eating.  As I said, I didn't have much--I substituted dried milk, 3 T. dried minced onions, 1 tsp garlic salt, and elbow macaroni.  It looked kind of bland, so I added about 1 T. dried parsley leaves.  Topped with fresh grated parmesan.  Needed a little more salt.  It was pretty good.

Tasted really good (I omitted the salt and added some Italian seasoning) but it was very runny.  Maybe I did something wrong?  Loved that it felt somewhat healthy!

Great recipe! Very fast and simple to make. My husband and I loved it. The only things I did differenly was add a garlic clove in place of garlic powder, as well as a few Italian spices to give it more flavor.

This was pretty good and pretty simple.  I started it around 5:45 and was serving dinner at 7:00.  I even had to broil the chicken.  I definately recommend adding more garlic and onion, otherwise, it might be kinda' bland.  My family ate it just fine and did't complain.  I even stirred some steamed broccoli in with it.

Very good, easy recipe!  Not my favorite, but I'm not a fan of alfredo, however my husband and 1 year old LOVED it.  I was able to work this recipe into our Weight Watchers meal plan due to the light sauce.  Definately will make this one again.  Easy and fast!

Okay flavor, a nice tang, but i had texture issues (I don't have a food processor, so I used my immersion blender), and not "alfredo-y" enough.  I tossed in a jar of store-bought alfredo sauce (Bertolli's), and it was great.  A less-guilty but not guilt-free sauce.  P.S. - I cooked three cubed chicken breasts in two tbs butter and two cloves chopped garlic (plus salt and pepper), then stirred into the sauce w/ some steamed brocolli.  Result was YUM!

We liked this pretty well - it was not as flavorful as we might have like, but Chicken Alfredo rarely is, so it's not this recipe's fault. I fear the only way to get really flavorful alfredo is by adding highly salted ingredients, and in our sodium-concious household, that's not an option. It might be nice with some sun-dried tomatoes or other ingredients thrown in for more flavor. The sauce had a beautiful consistency, though, and was very easy to make!

This was pretty good.  I made 1 1/2 times the sauce, used onion powder instead of onion, added roasted garlic  and sauted mushrooms, and a little more parmesan then the recipe called for.  I also boiled the sauce until it thickened before I added the chicken, mushrooms and pasta.  Yummy!

Good -especially becuase it is so easy.  I blended it all the night before, put it in the blender in the fridge and then poured it into the pan for dinner the next day.  Pretty good, but my two girsl, both small, did not care for it.

This is a great recipe to use if you are trying to watch calories/fat. It's a great tasting sauce without the heavy cream and butter that most Alfredo recipes call for. I would, however, recommend using onion powder instead of minced onion- just a personal preference.

What I liked most about this recipe is how easy and fast it was. I needed some freezer meals for my family to be able to just take out, thaw and heat. This dish fits the bill, and froze beautifully! If you are in a real time crunch you can even just pour a jar of alfredo sauce on top and add in the onions and extra garlic. I topped mine with the parmesan once it was completely cooled and sprinkled dried parsley on top then froze it.

I used ricotta cheese instead of cottage since that's what I had.  I also had only an ancient little nub of parmesan left.  It was good, but it probably would have been better with fresher ingredients.  I recommend this.

Like everyone else said, you would never be able to tell there was no heavy cream in it. It was amazing, my very pregnant and hard to cook for in the moment wife loved it!!! 100% the best Alfredo Iâ€™ve ever had. I did not have enough of cottage cheese, the closest replacement I had was vanilla Greek yogurt, you couldnâ€™t even tell!!!

Good flavor but a little runny when warm.  Next time I will add less milk.

Copied for advice: "This was really wonderful! I did change it just a little. I cooked the chicken in a little olive oil and poltry seasoning. I also used 4 cloves of garlic. I used a blender instead of a food processer because I was afraid of the texture. The sause was smooth and creamy, I would never have known it was a lower fat recipe. My family loved it!!!"
