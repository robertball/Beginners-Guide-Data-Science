Make sure to use the coarser grade of chickpea flour for an authentic texture.  Also, I omitted the nuts due to allergies, and added 1 TBSP ground cardamom for flavor.

The key to making this is patience, and a little extra flour.  Make sure that the mixture is close to room temperature before rolling, flour your hands, and allow to set. If the balls lose form while setting, flour your hands again and reroll them when they are cooler.

This is delicious!  Not quite the ball shaped because I didn't read the helpful hints beforehand, however, I am super excited about the taste and the experience!

Really simple recipe with great results. I modified it a bit though, for my own tastes. Instead of cashews and pistachios, I used walnuts and pistachios - and even added about 2 teaspoons of powdered cinnamon. Instead of besan flour, I used a gluten-free blend of millet and sorghum flour, and a bit of of standard white flour. I would estimate it was about 2.5 cups and .5 cups respectively.
