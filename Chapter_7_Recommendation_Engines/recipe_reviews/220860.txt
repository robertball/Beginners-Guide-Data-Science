i made this two nights ago and my husband loved He said it tasted like his grandma's!! I changed the recipe a little by adding baby carrots and a little less onion. The meat really was fork tender and the flavor was so good. This recipe is a keeper.

I made this in an electric pressure cooker and followed the directions exactly, using a 3.5 lb butt roast.  It turned out perfectly!  This is my new go-to recipe for this type of roast. It's a family favorite.

This was fantastic! The pressure cooker method was easy and the drippings made the most wonderful gravy. I was nervous to try a recipe that nobody had rated yet, but really glad I did. My husband and I couldn't eat it fast enough, so delicious!

Adjusted cooktime for my 2.2 lb roast; used only 1/2 pack of onion soup mix. Added beef consomme instead of water.  Cooked 45 minutes on high, released pressure, added potatoes (quartered), 1/2 onion sliced & quartered and 6 carrots (peeled and sliced in 2" logs); also added 1/2 can of chicken broth I had left over from lunch. Cooked on high for an additional 10 minutes. Great! Could have done 9 minutes on the vegetables in my Cuisinart PC; they were soft - but not mushy. Will make again and might try a variation of this recipe adding a can of cream soup.
Note: My husband said I should have cooked the roast a little longer in my Cuisinart PC so I will add about 10 more mintues next time before adding the vegetables. It could have been a little more tender.

I know this is a weird review to post, but I remade this recipe with turkey instead of chuck roast because it's leaner.  I browned and pressure cooked it, but only for 30 minutes since it's a smaller cut of meat.  It turned out incredible.  I made mashed potatoes instead of roasted, but next time I will put the potatoes in with the turkey.  Thank you for the inspiration to try the pressure cooker with turkey - delicious!

My husband said, "This is the best pot roast I've ever had."  He doesn't like pot roast but he found this one to be "good" and with the gravy,  he declared it "very good".
I had a 2.2 lb chuck roast and I used Montreal steak seasoning for the salt and pepper rub.  I used one package of Lipton Onion soup and about 1/3 packet of Lipton Beefy Onion soup.  I cooked it in the Instant Pot on meat setting (high pressure) for 45 minutes and then let pressure come down naturally before putting in baby carrots, half a large onion, and large chunks of potatoes (3 large ones), and a sprinkle of celery seed and celery salt.  I added some beef broth  lifted the meat over the vegetables  to make sure the vegetables were immersed.   Then it was manual low pressure for 9 minutes and natural pressure release for 15 minutes and then I released the rest of the pressure and placed the meat and vegetables in a platter and made the gravy as instructed.  It was tender, juicy and so delicious!  My son and I ate more than we should - so  yummy!

This was a really good recipe.  I made it exactly as written except I used the Onion Soup Recipe from this site by Mammakittyto3.  This was also very good.  I really liked this because the meat became tender without drying out.  Thanks so much for posting this recipe

I acquired  a good pressure cooker from a thrift shop and it is better than the one I bought new.
This recipe did two things.  I got great instructions to use the pressure cooker and it is a great recipe. It was very delicious. Everyone loved it.  The meat was so tender and infused with the Onion soup flavour.   I found a new Lipton Herb and Garlic soup and I plan to try it this way.  Ya gotta love Lipton.  Bon Appetit.

My 3 lb rump roast was slightly frozen so it took long time to get pressure so I over cooked it some but it was very yummy. The carrots which are my favorite were amazingly good. I did add 1 packet of brown gravy mix (dissolved in water)when I added veggies and omitted the flour gravy step. My husband loved it. Meat was from local farm.

So good! I cooked the roast mostly as written though my roast was smaller, about 1.75 pds for family of 3. I did use 1 pack of onion soup mix because of that. I cooked this in my new electric pressure cooker only 40 mins b/c of the weight. Added/cooked the vegetables as described here, then thickened the gravy. Was perfect timing on all and the texture of the gravy was spot on. Will fix again and again.I'm putting my crock pot away.

Based on instructions for my pressure cooker I cooked for 45 minutes and even that was a bit too long. Added carrots and mushrooms. Gravy was especially good.

The meal was amazing and everyone loved it.  I followed the recipe to the letter but did use the onion soup recipe on this site rather than buy it.  The meat was moist and tender, the gravy was awesome.  This is a keeper!!

The meat was gorgeous. I liked 3/4 tsp of red pepper flakes and smokey paprika added. Great basic recipe to play with. :)

I used an electric pressure cooker and changed the cook time on high pressure to 1hr with a 2.5lb. chuck roast and added 2 sprigs of thyme before cooking. I also added carrots for the additional 10 min of cooking which I regret, so mushy. But potatoes and whole onions turned out perfect! Gravy was really good but made a lot.

When I first bit into the meat, I could not possibly believe that something I made could be this delicious.  

Since I've done little with roasts other than slow cook or perhaps try cook them in the oven, I was not ready for the experience of pot roasting.  I had not experience with making gravy, frying in the pot, or even pressure cooking at all, so this felt harder than it probably really is.  But it got easier as the process continued.  

Potatoes and onions were delicious.  I was a little surprised that carrots weren't part of the meal, and I must have missed that, since I had peeled a bunch of them before I realized they weren't in the recipe.  Nonetheless, I threw one in, just to see if it would work, and it was great.  Carrots absolutely can be part of the recipe, if you want.

What a delightful recipe.  It encourages me to continue the pressure cooking experiment!

Amazing! I cooked the meat on top of onions, used a can of Beefy Mushroom soup and can of water. My roast was 2.5 lbs so using elec pressure cooker on high pressure for 50 mins and then quick released pressue, added qtr'd potatoes and baby carrots at high pressure 15 more mins! Awesome!! Served with biscuits to sop up the great gravy!! Grandchildren could not stop complimenting me! SCORE!!

This recipe is sensational.  Made as directed. I used 2 ounces of ( 5 Star ) Onion Soup Mix  on this web site. If you have a pressure cooker and enjoy tender, delicious Pot Roast this recipe is a must. No more stringy, tough roast for me. 
I did remove the roast from the cooker after searing and deglazed the bottom  with a little water before proceeding.
You too can  make a tough cut of meat into a fork-tender, excellent flavored roast.and gravy. I'll be making this  recipe  over and over. 
Thank you for sharing such a wonderful  recipe.

I would give this a 5 for flavor but the meat seemed a little over cooked so I would cut the time, maybe 10-20 minutes. My rump roast was only 2 lbs instead of three so I cut the time to 1 hr to begin with anyways. I only used one onion soup pack because that sounds like a lot of onion, I didn't add any raw onion and I added about 15 baby carrots. Very good flavor. I'm saving the extra gravy, I'm sure I can find a good use for the leftovers.

I. love this recipe because it reminds me of my Mimi's recipe and all of the wonderful and comforting flavors.   I have used this recipe  several times and it has been wonderful every time. Love it!  It was a big hit in celebrating Easter.

It was so mediocre and it took a very, very long time to cook. I got a pressure cooker to help with cooking time and this took almost 4 hours. The end result was basically something from a slow cooker so I don't get it

Very tasty and easy to make, however the meat was over cooked.  I used a 3.25 lb. rump roast.  The next time I will reduce the cooking time  for the beef to maybe only 45 - 60 minutes.  Pressure cookers vary and  I think an hour and a half is too long for my Instant Pot.   I added carrots, along with the potatoes and onions and cooked for the time recommended in the recipe and the veggies turned out great.  Quick, easy gravy.

I added carrots to the recipe and only used 2 onions I chopped the unions to small so it made a bit of a mushy paste. Overall this is a good recipe.

Love the oniony flavor!  My husband loved it too.  I was concerned that 2 packets of soup mix would make this too salty but it was not so bad.

This is a winner.  made twice so far.  Adjusted the cook time for a more tender roast (+5 minutes at low temperature).  I'm not normally a fan of pressure cooked veggies, but those who like more tender vegetables really went for these.  Will be added to the regular routine.

Since we are a small family, my roast was a little over a pound. I only cooked it for half an hour in my pressure cooker. Instead of just water, I substituted 1 cup of it for organic mushroom soup. I also added raw chopped garlic , rosemary, & a couple of bay leaves for flavor. I added red potatoes, red onions, & baby carrots after it cooked for half an hour & cooked it for an additional 10 minutes. Then I turned it off & added raw broccoli & placed the lid back on it & let it sit for 10 minutes to cook the broccoli. It was delicious, I ate it like soup & my daughter put it on corn tortillas dressed with cilantro, raw onion, & Mexican cheese.

This was the first recipe I made in my new Cosori Pressure Cooker - it was delicious!  My roast was a little over 2# so I cooked it on high for 45 min. then added potatoes, baby carrots & an onion & cooked on low for 9 min. I used a can of cream of mushroom soup & about 1 1/2 cups beef broth; removed the meat & veggies from the pot & made the gravy on the soup setting. I couldn't believe how tender the meat was. I will definitely make this again.

My first time using a pressure cooker, other than to make popcorn lol, and let me tell you....It was amazing!! I didn't have the soup mix so I seasoned roast with garlic, pepper, and salt, and used just a half of a cut up onion in with the roast... it was wonderful!  My family loved it and my hubby is super picky so 5 stars!!!

Very nice flavor but anything over 35 minutes was too long for 3.5 pd. roast with 2 1/2 cups beef broth in my pressure cooker.   The time given with my cooker manual was accurate at 30 minutes.   Will adjust time in future as well as add some red wine.

I made this in my Instant Pot. Made a few modifications. I don’t like potatoes cooking with my roast so I omitted that from the recipe. I also used 1 cup beef broth and two cups water. Followed the recipe and added 2 sliced onions per the directions. YUMMY. Food coma.

I made this but changed a few things. I added 14.5 oz of breef broth and just as much red wine instead of the water. I lightly sauteed the onions, before adding. Over all it was very good. I cooked in my Pressure cooker for 40 minutes  for a 3 lb chuck roast. I think I could have added another 10-15 for the meat. I added the carrots, potatoes, and celery. Very good!

Great, Great and Great.. Recipe was easy to make (directions were easy to follow) and tastes wonderful.  Kids liked it too.  I made the recipe with a rump roast.  Followed recipe except used 1 1/2 packets of onion soup mix instead of two.  Cooked for 1 hour and 45 minutes  and was tender.  This is now my go- to recipe for rump roasts .

This is a wonderful recipe for roast. When I opened the pressure cooker to add the vegetables the meat was falling apart. When I added the potatoes and onions,  I added  more water and carrots and celery with them.  Was a great dinner and even my picky 4 and 9 yr. olds ate every bite.

Great recipe, cooking times were perfect except for the very end... took decidedly longer for the gravy to thicken up but gravy can be like that.  I did have a lot of juice so that was probably why.  Thanks!

why slow cook it when you can pressure cook it and it tastes better in a fraction of the time?  Ketchup is a must for this.

A great recipe, I don't have much experience with my new  electric pressure cooker, followed times and the meat turned out tender and the potatoes were perfect.  I did not have the onion soup, instead added a half orange bell pepper and some dried herbs in the beginning. Instead of the shortening I used vegetable oil. Used yukon gold potatoes, my family loved them.  I used the remaining flour to thicken the gravy. A great meal for a winter night.

I have made this recipe several a times and it has NEVER failed me. I added carrots,celery, and one bullion cube. I also used two regular onion soup mix packets, and one beefy onion flavored soup mix. It turned out great! I have an 8 quart pressure cooker, and I had six pounds of roast and lots of veggies!i highly recommend this recipe.

Very good pot roast recipe.   Simple to make and gives you good results.   I did feel that it needed more veggies like carrots, celery, etc., and that it could stand some other seasonings.   Regardless, a very good recipe.

I followed the recipe, and it turned out great.  My guests loved it.  The only thing I will do differently next time, is I'll leave the onions in bigger chunks, they broke down a little too far.  Also, I didn't allow enough time for bringing the pot to a boil, I live at high altitude and underestimated that part.  I'll make this again soon.

I made this last night after read some reviews.  I had 2.2 lbs of pot roast. I only used 1 envelope  from the package of  onion soup mix. Cooked on high pressure for 35 mins. After released pressure,  add 1 big onion, some baby carrots, celeries and 6 potatoes  for 5 mins on high pressure and it was perfect!  My family loved it! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe. It was so easy to make & tasty. Definitely  I will make this again.

This was awesome.  I used 3 cups of beef broth for the water.  I cooked my 3 lb rump roast for 2 hours as directed and made a roux to add to the finished broth. I also added 3 sticks of chopped celery.  It turned out fantastically!! My bride was very skeptical but this won her over as the best roast she has ever had.

I haven't done much in a pressure cooker except canning and vegetables, stews etc and was a bit afraid to take something more expesive like a roast of beef, but I am extremely grateful for this recipe!  I will never cook another roast any other way!!  This was extremely tender and made the best gravy I have ever made.  My background is English and I grew up having roast beef dinners and Yorkshire puddings every Sunday, so I do know about roast beef.  Try this recipe, you won't be sorry

It was a hit tonight! I used two smaller roasts and an hour and a half was perfect. I used no onion and added carrots but that was the only change.

Did a Frozen Tip Roast lbs for 1 hour high. Still turned out amazing! My Family just .Loved it! Added a little Beef Bouillon just to jazz it up and only cut potatoes in 1/2 instead of smaller pieces. Potatoes soaked up flavor of sauce and made things amazing not needing to ad a seasons at the dinner table. No leftovers ... it was that good!

Extremely tender, great flavor! Added in carrots and would have maybe let veggies go a couple minutes longer. Also used fairly fatty blade roast which detracted but the recipe itself worked out great!

Delicious... Thank you.   I'm very new with using a pressure cooker. I'm in the process of learningr. The pressure cooker came with some basic recipes. I tried one out and it was horrible. So I decided to see what was on Allrecipes and see if i had better luck. I was excited to find such a highly rated recipe. Your directions were easy to follow and everyone loved it.

This is a good basic recipe and I love how easy it is! Fast too. I gave it four stars instead of five because I've had better roasts in terms of flavor.
