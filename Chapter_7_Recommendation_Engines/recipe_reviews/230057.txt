Very sweet! No need for marshmallows here! My husband said TOO sweet! I said YUM!!! I prefer this very much over other sweet potatoes I've had! I'll make this again to share during the holidays. Thank you:)

Make no mistake this is a sweet sweet potatoes dish but I thought it was wonderful. I m even thinking of mashing them up with some of the syrup and topping with a huge dollop of whipped cream for a dessert. Thanks for sharing!

My family loved this recipe although it was still on the sweet side even after halving the sauce ingredients. But definitely a keeper and the vanilla added a refreshingly different flavor to this classic Thanksgiving dish.
