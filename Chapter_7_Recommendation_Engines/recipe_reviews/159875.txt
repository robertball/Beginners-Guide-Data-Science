The best way to describe this is that it is like a crustless sourcream cheesecake but with yogurt. I used lowfat plain yogurt and fatfree sweetened condensed milk without any problem. I did add a teaspoon of vanilla and mine baked up in about 25 minutes. It was a bit too sweet for me and if I make it again I will not scrape the milk can clean but just pour in what comes out and see how it is then or if I need to adjust more. My understanding of Bhapa Doi (steamed yogurt) is that it is traditionally made with evaporated milk and is an unsweetened Bengali dessert flavored with cardomom and/or saffron. However I have seen sweetened versions of recipes posted on the internet. This would make a nice presentation baked in individual ramekins.

Very easy and tasty. I made it for Valentine's Day so I added an Oreo crumb crust and drizzled caramel sauce and chocolate sprinkles on top and I used pecans instead of almonds. Next time I will make the plainer version using lowfat yogurt and see how that goes. To confert to metric, for a 300ml can of sweetened condensed milk I used 775ml of yogurt and it worked great. Firms up real nice. Definitely a keeper. Thank you.

I did not care for this.  I did as another reviewer recommended and did not scrape the condensed milk can clean and this was still way too sweet.

Wow... What national is this recipe (Indian, Mexican, or totally fusion)? I will try it next weekend. Are you sure we don't need any flour? Will it stay formed?
