This is my first recipe submission, so I wanted to add a couple of comments. First, my original recipe uses baby arugula, which gives it even more flavor. Since it is hard to find in some stores, I used mixed greens. Also, the recipe makes enough pecans for several salads. I might put a 1/4 to 1/3 cup as a topper on each salad.

Overall a tasty salad. With my first bite, I kind of missed the acidity and thought I'd like it more with the addition of vinegar or lemon juice. The more I ate it, the more I liked it as is. I took the recipe submitter's advice and made it with arugula, since it is readily available in my local grocery store.  The salty gorgonzola compliments the sweet pecans and peppery arugula perfectly. I liked how the pecans were toasted with the egg white mixture. They turn out really crunchy. Next time I will add a bit more cayenne since I couldn't really taste any spicyness. For optimum flavor, make sure you get a piece of pecan and some gorgonzola in each bite!

This salad is so simple yet delicious!  I was afraid my husband wouldn't like it because he usually doesn't like this type of cheese, but he loved it as much as I did.  I have made this with spring mix of lettuce.  I have not been able to find hazlenut oil yet.  A good quality of olive oil and balsamic vinegar lightly drizzled over top works well too.

Perfect combination of flavors, complex enough to make guests think I spent a bunch of time on it, when in fact I hardly spent any time in the kitchen fixing this dish at all! Thanks for the submission!

Delicious perfect for when you donâ€™t want just regular dressing. This recipe added  flair and a sweet/slightly spicy taste. I would serve this to guests who I know would be impressed as I was. The recipe is spot on for all ingredients and cooking time.  2 cups is a lot there will be plenty leftovers.

I loved this. Was unable to find hazelnut oil, so I made a vinaigrette with olive oil, rice wine vinegar, sugar, dijon mustard and onion powder. Loved the arugula! The candied pecans rocked! Easy way to impress your guests.
