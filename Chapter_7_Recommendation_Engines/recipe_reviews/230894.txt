This was great!  I substituted garlic powder for onion powder (since I was out) and didn't add extra salt, as there's enough in the chicken broth.  Definitely better than cooking on the stovetop.

The only thing I'll change is to reduce the cooking time to 45 minutes next time, just because of the brand of brown rice I buy.  Even then, it wasn't overly dry after an hour.

Great way to make brown rice. I will increase the cayenne next time.

Liked this but made some very minor changes! Used 2 c water and 3.5 c broth. (Since the package directions called for 5 cups water I felt that 3 was too little water.) Recommend reducing salt and pepper to 1/2 t. each. Baked 1 hour exactly and it was great texture! Will make this my new brown rice method!

This was very flavorful and easy to make -- an average recipe that can be "doctored" up in lots of ways. I liked having the extra burner available on the stove to prepare the rest of the meal while the rice baked in the oven.  I had trouble judging the time.  It was not ready in 45 minutes as others said it would be, but it would have been way overcooked had I left it in the full time called for in the recipe. I will have to play with the time when I make it again -- which I will!

Reduced the salt to about 1/4 tsp (due to the sodium content of the chicken broth.) I was out of cayenne pepper so used a pinch of paprika instead. Only needed about 45 min to bake. Just turned off the oven & cracked the oven door while the rest of the meal was finishing up.

This very tasty.  But 1 hr & 15 min is way too long.  I baked it for 45 minutes and it was overdone.  Next time I'll try 30 minutes.  Aside from that its a great recipe.

Rice came out really good.  I did add cilantro and a can of seasoned tomato and I'm glad I did.  It came out so flavorful!

Really like this method for Brown Rice. Added finely chopped carrot, celery, onion and green pepper to make a great pilaf. No added salt.

Good and easy, I did add extra water at about 35 minutes and it was finished at 50 minutes. I guess it depends on the brand of rice and the oven, I'm glad I checked on it early. Makes a ton so it is perfect to freeze some for another day.

Made this exactly as instructed and it was the best brown rice I’ve ever made! Side note, I washed the rice before sautéing one the butter. Makes the rice fluffy and non sticky!

This is an easy method for cooking brown rice. I now prefer this to the lengthy stovetop or rice cooker method. I made the recipe exactly as written and it was delicious.

I checked the pot in the oven at an hour and I'm glad I did. The dish was on the verge of being WAY too done. F or me, 1 hour and 15 minutes was too long. Next time I will add a half cup more broth and only cook for 45 minutes. Still, it's a great way to cook brown rice pilaf.

great recipe with many options - i did it vegan with diced vegetables - carrots, tomatoes, sweet peppers but could also do with chix or beef broth with shredded meat. Made in my heavy casserole. Like others tested after 30 minutes and every 15 after that to check rice softness.

Great recipe!  Easy to prepare.  I actually under cooked it the first time and my family like the slightly nutty taste better.

I added a bit of finely diced onion, 1 tbsp garam masala, and a bay leaf. Delicious! I think next time I'll go easier on the garam masala and add some diced dried apricots. Some toasted almonds or pine nuts would be good also.

Way too much heat.   Otherwise it does make a great textured and tasty rice.
