I too grew up eating this, but as a breakfast treat. The recipe was passed on from my Grandmother to my mother, and on to me. It was one of my first baking experiences and now I am a professional Pastry Chef. My notes are simple.... for better flavor use either butter flavored shortening or replace some or all of the shortening with butter. Also I put cinnamon IN the cake batter instead of just on top. For the folks that didn't think it was exciting enough remember this is from the days of simplistic home baking. When mothers still cooked for the families everyday.

This was a great cake to make, very quick and easy. I followed earlier comments and used margarine instead of shortening, and I mixed in the cinnamon with the flour etc. I also modified the topping a bit, after spreading the margaine on top I sprinkled some powdered sugar on the top of the cake, rather than add 3/4 of a cup. It just sounded like too much sugar! My boyfriend enjoyed it, said "It's bang on!", and I agree. A good, traditional tasting cake.

Excellent recipe!  I made it just as it's written and I didn't think it made too much topping.  You can control that anyway since you sift it on the cake at the end.  The flavor reminded me of a homemade powdered sugar doughnut.  You can tell this is an old-time recipe.  Definitely a keeper for me!

This is a great recipe - the cake was very moist and delicious.  I took the suggestions of another reviewer and added cinnamon to the batter and I replaced all of the shortening with butter.  It came out great!

This is the same recipe that has been in my family since my great-grandmother's time (originally from C&H sugar box). My GGM made it as a Sunday night supper cake; this tradition was continued by my grandmother, then my aunt, and then myself.  I love it just as-is and haven't changed a thing, although I must admit that the cinnamon-sugar topping called for is way more than you'll need for one cake-- a third of that will suffice.  My GGM used to serve it with gingered pears spooned over the top. Tasty and traditional, a simple old-fashioned recipe.

Made this with butter vs shortening and 1 T. of cinnamon  in the batter.  Since I am high altitude > 5,000 feet, I reduced the baking powder by 1/8 teaspoon so that it would come out okay.  I also used cake flour.  Put about 1 1/2 teas of cinnamon in powdered sugar.  I am diabetic so I do not eat sugar foods of any kind, but hubbie ate half at one sitting.  He gave it the above rating.

This cake is great! But when you make it you might want to dubble your recipe because it dosen't make very much. Also I thought the recomende amout of toping was to much, but it was one of the best cakes iv'e had.

Loved this! I did cut back a little of the powdered sugar and added some cinnamon to the cake mixture, although I may add a little more cinnamon to it next time because my children like a little more cinnamon taste.

I just made this cake for my husbands birthday.  He LOVED it!  I substituted applesauce for the shortening to help reduce the fat content and I doubled the recipe. (doubling the baking time)  It turned out great!  I was a little worried when I tasted the batter that it might be too sweet, but it was just right after baking.  I didn't use all the 'topping', but put on enough to where the butter had stopped soaking through. (about half, I'm not big on powdered sugar, I also added more cinnamon to it.)  This is a great simple cake to make.  I know I'll be making it again. :)

LOVED this recipe and I must say... I made this cake while listening to all three of my preschool girls whine about how they wanted a special snack -- and for some reason cinnamon was the requested spice?!? I live in Germany, although am an American, and there are NOT many cinnamon cake/roll recipes... I found this recipe just browsing "cinnamon" and thought I can do this. I doubled the recipe as some readers had said to do. I didn't let the butter and sugar cream together long enough and had a clump, so I added the vanilla and was as impatient as the girls and added the milk. Looked TERRIBLE... to try to get a decent batter I went ahead and added all the ingredients and left it on mix while I helped one of the girls get dressed. I came back to a gorgeous batter, but wondered if I "overmixed" it. I did add cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter and put the   cake in the oven for 20 minutes as wasn't sure and took it out at 22 because I was scared of it getting too brown. I am thinking I underbaked it, but it was UH-MAZ-ING!!!!!!!!!! I think the cake was gone in 15 minutes flat and I don't mean cut up and on plates, I mean I couldn't cut it fast enough GONE in every tummy within arm's reach! My Turkish husband requested an encore... wow, YOU saved my DAY and I am indebted to you! Thank you for sharing such a fantastic recipe!

I've been snow-bound for 2 days and craving a coffee cake but didn't have a ton of ingredients around. I just wanted a simple cinnamon cake and this recipe is perfect. I followed the recipe but I added cinnamon to the batter and I like it a lot!  This is just a basic cinnamon quick bread type cake. Very simple. Not too sweet not complicated. I did make one little error while mixing the ingredients; I grabbed chili powder instead of cinnamon and started shaking away into my batter!!  I caught myself after two shakes and finished up with some ground cinnamon but I think it was a happy mistake!  Chili powder gave it just a little extra kick. Lovely little cake

Simple to make, this non-complicated and wonderfully 'clean' tasting cake is a great way to start the weekend!  My 5 yr old daughter loves to help add the ingredients while making this cake, and loves the idea of having 'supper' for breakfast!

If I could give this a 6 star rating I would  - Not sure why but this is the best Cinnamon cake I have ever made.  I did make one ingredient change - butter instead of shortening and added the cinnamon to the batter,  I cooked in a 10" bunt pan and baked it 45 mins. I changed the topping to a confectioner sugar/corn syrup glaze.

this is an excellent one for beginners. soooo easy. i used softened marg and added cinnamon to the batter, also. shortening is always soft, so to get the marg or butter to cream into the sugar, it must be soft. the powdered sugar on top is a matter of taste. right after you take it out of the oven, rub the top with a pat of butter, then powder it. it looks like allot of sugar but some melts. if you don't have a sifter, use a strainer or a colander, or just sprinkle it on. after i did that i cut around the edge and used two spatulas to put it on a serving plate. beautiful. good for after supper and good for breakfast, too. i shared this at work and they all loved it.

I loved this fast, wonderful dessert!  Like most others, I subbed margarine for the shortening and added 1 tsp. cinnamon to the batter (I think that's a must for this cake's flavor), and it was wonderful!  Next time, I may experiment with some walnuts and a butter/brown sugar crumb mixture on top, but it's great just the way it is!

Fantastic!  I added more cinnamon to the batter (2 teaspoons).  It's very moist and has a good texture.  It doesn't make a big cake - I'd do a double amount and make 2 layers for a decent size.

Really tasty dessert. I did use butter instead of the shortening. Easy to prepare and just the right size for our family.  My seven year old daughter pretty much made this herself. She thinks this is the best cake she has ever tasted. We'll keep this recipe!

I was expecting this cake to actually have cinnamon in it. And, although I could add that myself & will the next time, I don't think it is right to call this a cinnamon cake without it in the batter. Take away the glaze & there would be no cinnamon.

This cake was fantastic! I also added lots of cinnamon to the batter itself and used lots of powdered sugar and cinnamon on top, and it is FABULOUS! The melted butter with the confectioners sugar kind of makes a glaze at the bottom layer of all the confectioners sugar, so it is well worth it to use the whole amount called for if you ask me! Thank you for sharing! My husband absolutely loved it, as well as my 18mo old! :) As a matter of fact, I made my first batch last night, and it was gone by this morning, so my husband requested I make another one! LOL! He ate it for breakfast (and obviously during the day while I was gone! LOL!) so I doubled the recipe tonight! :) WONDERFUL! :D

Delicious, especially still warm from the oven.  I followed other peoples' advice and put the cinnamon in the cake rather than on top, and I only used about 1/4 cup powdered sugar for the topping.  That was just the right amount.

I didn't have shortening so substituted butter, also added about 1 teaspoon cinnamon to cake batter. Excellent taste and texture. So easy, so tasty - I'll make this again and again. Thanks for sharing this!

I grew up watching my mom make this, and getting to lick the beaters and the bowl. It is one of my earliest memories, and the first cake I baked.  I won’t use shortening anymore, so I’ll use the filtered coconut oil instead. For those of you changing all kinds of ingredients, why not try the recipe straight out, with the exception of the trans fats. THEN modify it if you want to!

Used real butter instead of shortening and added cinnamon to the batter, as per others reviews. We loved it, but next time I think having some ice cream to go with it would be great. If you don't eat it right away, the next day it's a bit dry.

I've made this for years now, and it's become a family favorite. I would really give it ten stars if I could. If I ever ask family or friends for a suggestion to bake, they give me this.  I love this cake so much! 

My suggestion, as I've made it hundreds and hundreds of time now (I could make it in my sleep now if I wanted) is to add only about a tablespoon or so of powdered sugar and just a 1/2 cup of sugar in the cake. It makes it a little less sweet and makes the cinnamon pop out in the cake a little more. Pretty much just cut down on the sugar is what I'm trying to say.

Overall, this really is the best cake I have ever made and I think the best cake that I will ever make. It is my go-to cake and I'm sure it will be yours as well!

I would love to make this cake again. Even the raw batter tasted delicious! The only thing I would change is that to put the cinnimon in the actual batter.

For my culinary class, we made a cinnamon supper cake and it turned out great, even without any glaze added to it. I found no issues with it and it doesn't take that long compared to other cakes.

This is exactly the same cake my mom made for Sunday dessert when I was a little girl. It is a lot of sugar, but for my sweet tooth it is very satisfying.  To be a teeny bit healthier, I will cut the topping sugar in half next time and see how it turns out. Thank you for sharing it.

It was an easy bake with a great result. I ran out of butter so I used honey to coat the top of the cake and added the powder sugar. My husband pretty much ate half of it!

Made this for an after dinner treat for my husband, who loves cinnamon. I added 1 heaping tablespoon of cinnamon to the batter itself, and then sprinkled the top of the cake with cinnamon and sugar and just a dusting of powdered sugar over that. It was delicious and easy to make. Will definitely be making again. Only wish it had been a bit bigger. :)

It's very good but sry from all of the powder on the top, but I tried it again and put the powder on top before I put it in the oven and some butter on top of that and it soaked through the cake it was very good.

This is simply amazing ...Its moist and just the right amount of sweet...I took the advice of some of the reviewers and added cinnamon to the flour.and substituted butter for shortening and it came out more than amazing...it needed just 15 mins in the oven for me...next time I am going to try adding cocoa maybe it'll come out equally as good as a chocolate cake.

Added about 2 teaspoons of cinnamon to the batter AND sprinkled some on top of the finished cake. (We love cinnamon!) my husband just ate 3/4's of one of the cakes. (I doubled it. Baked it in an 8" and a brownie pan.) Mine was ready at 20 minutes. Almost balked at the 375 degree temperature, but it worked!! LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this cake!

I added about a tablespoon of cinnamon to the cake. I doubled the recipe and got almost 18 cupcakes out of it. I reduced the cooking time to 18 minutes for cupcakes. The cake rises quite a bit so next time Ii'll leave maybe 1/2 an inch of room in the cupcake tin to the rim. They deffinately remind me of a doughnut!

Very easy. I added cinnamon to batter as others did.  Mime came out a little dry but I'm not the greatest baker. I might try this again adding like 1/2 cup of applesauce and see how that turns out. Either way I will make this again.  Oh and I love that it is a small cake. We never finish a regular size.

Wonderfully simple.   My husband and I don't like desserts that are overly sweet.  This was perfect.  Just sweet enough. I also enjoyed that it is so easy to throw together for a spur of the moment dessert with ingredients I usually have on hand.

I found this recipe to be kind of bland. If I so choose to make it again, I'll probably add more cinnamon or all spice to the batter itself. It's also very pale which wasn't too appetizing. But I suppose it would be ok if you were you pair it with something else: i.e. with fruit and custard or a light sauce on the side?

Delicious and different!  You definitely don't need as much topping as the recipe suggests -- a little sprinkle of cinnamon & sugar is all you need.  I also added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon to the cake batter -- gives the cake a nice color and flavor.

It was simple, quick, and put together with ingredients that are typically in the cupboard. For that I give it 5 stars. For the taste...well, it was fine/good, nothing real special. The topping just doesn't feel like it is part of the cake. You have this moist cake with a pile of dry powder on top. It is odd when you bite into it, you will find that you shake the majority of the topping off just to obtain moisture in your mouth. (And also to not have a roof full of stuck powdered sugar.) Overall it was nice to be able to have a fresh baked item in the morning with limited ingredients and limited time, but it is not a guest worthy cake.

A really nice basic cake to make with ingredients that are often on hand!  I substituted the white sugar for brown sugar for the topping because I wanted the brown sugar taste.

I was disappointed with this recipe.  The cake part was fine - though nothing special and like others have stated, a little flat due to a small amount of batter.  I just didn't care for the topping.  It was dry and powdery.  When I was done, my husband was sure there was another step to cooking this!

I love cinnamon cakes but this one had an off taste to me. Wasnt as i expected it to be. It did have a nice texture and lightness to it. Was just kind of bland for me.
