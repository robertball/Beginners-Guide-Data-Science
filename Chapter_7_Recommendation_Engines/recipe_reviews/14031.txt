I served this recipe to a large group and it was a hugh success.  I also made it
one day ahead and chilled until ready to bake.  I used a sour dough bread and 
1/4 cup fresh basil rather than dry.  I also sprinkled a parmesan, romano and 
asiago mixture on top.  I will definately make this again.

This was very easy.  I used fresh tomatoes and added some minced garlic and topped it with a ton of grated romano.  It was a huge hit! Thanks.

Absolutely LOVE this recipe!!!!  I did read the reviews before making, so used seasoned dry croutons instead of regular bread cubes.  Used the tomatoes from my garden.  The slightly sweet taste (used a little less brown sugar then called for) is WONDERFUL!  This is, definitely, a keeper!!!

I honestly had some doubts about this recipe, but it is definetly a keeper!  I used olive oil instead of butter, and sprinkled parmesean cheese over the top for the last 10 mintues and the dish got rave reviews.  I baked it in a 9 X 9 pan instead of 9 X 13

Delicious!  I used Roma tomatoes because they have less pulp in them.  I used 6 good sized ones since they are a little smaller than regular tomatoes.  Next time, I will use a stouter bread instead of "kids'" bread (Wonder, yuck!), which is all I had on hand.  The grated cheese idea sounds good, too.

This was a very good dish.  Different from any way I've fixed tomatoes.  I did add more bread
than the recipe called for because it seemed smushy when I first mixed it up.  I also stirred it some parmesan cheese.  I'll definitely make this again!

This recipe is delicious. The brown sugar plus the tartness and acidity of the tomatoes are wonderful. Tip: Don't cover this dish when you bake it--the bread will be firmer and not so mushy if you leave the dish uncovered. I also add shredded motzarella cheese on top during the last 10 mins of baking. So good!!

This was really yummy! The tomatoes have a wonderful flavor - it must be the brown sugar that makes it so good.

I am not a fan of tomatoes, but I've been looking for ways to eat them that I can actually enjoy.  This recipe did the trick!  I made mine with a nutty multi-grain bread, which added great texture.  It's super easy, good for you, and I made it for less that 50 cents!  Great with a sprinkle of parm and a side of toast.

I thought it was yummy and different sidedish. It was very tasty eaten with breaded chicken breasts. My Father is a big fan now. But my toddler daughter wouldnt touch it.

I loved this recipe.  I probably would not add as much brown sugar next time, as I like my tomatoes a little less sweet.  I followed other suggestions and toasted my bread cubes until crusty, and added some garlic.  Substituted half the butter for some olive oil.  Would definitely make again.

These are scrumptious! The only change I made was to add a small chopped up green pepper because I had a lot from the garden. I think maybe if I made it again I might decrease the sugar by just a tad and maybe even use a couple more tomatoes. But just wonderful the way it is. Thank you!

This was a mess; the brown sugar made the tomatoes bitter. This won't be a repeat in my house.

Terrific recipe!  I had so many tomatoes ripe in the garden that I didn't know what to do with.  I used a mixture of red cherry, golden dwarf, yellow plumb and snow white tomatoes for a nice color variation.  I'm glad I came across this recipe.  I read all of the reviews and decided to mix in 1/4 cup shredded parmesian as well as sprinkle a bit on top.  I used fresh basil, about 1/4 cup. The bread I had on hand was a sourdough wheat.  It added a subtle flavor of it's own.  Turned out great!  Will make again soon.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was a mush, a not very much tomato flavor mushy bread.  I wasted 6 of my beautiful home-grown tomatoes on this dish that I just threw away after one taste.  Don't bother making this unless you like mushy white bread.

I use seasoned croutons for this recipe and layer everything in the casserole dish rather than cooking it on the stove top first --- with home grown tomatoes (especially at THIS time of the year, I have so many to use up!), this is delicious.  I layer everything in the casserole dish and then bake it.    Mix the salt, pepper, basil, sugar, dried onion, and some garlic powder together, then 1 layer of croutons, 1 layer of tomatoes, sprinkle half of seasoning mixture , 1 layer of croutons, 1 layer of tomatoes, rest of seasoning, 1 layer of croutons), melt the butter and pour over all, then bake.  When I have it in the fridge, I also add some fontina and layer that on top of the seasoning.  OMG, I'm making this again this evening, I'm hungry just writing about it!

I have to admit, I was skeptical about this recipe.  Brown sugar...really?  But it had so many good reviews, and we had so many tomatoes, we decided to give it a shot.  I used toasted wheat bread and added Parmesan.  It was delicious!!!

made it last night w/many tomatoes fresh from my garden.  Added chopped fresh spinach, mozarella, parmesan, seasoned croutons instead of bread cubes, and a good amount of garlic.  Even my 14 year old ate it.  It's all gone now because I had the rest as breakfast!  Very nice recipe find, thank you.

I had a bunch of tomatoes that were "on there way out" and was looking for a way to use them up. This turned out to be a delicious and relatively simple treat. I used wheat bread instead of white, because that's all I had.   I cooked the tomatoes in the pan untll they were very soft. I also added about 1/4 cup of shredded mozzerella to the top right before baking.  The result was wonderful.  It tasted like eggplant parm without the eggplant.  I think this would be great served right on top of spaghetti. I'm a vegeterian and this was a great find.  I never thought about using tomatoes in this way before, but I will happily make this again.

This sounded good and looked pretty but I guess I was expecting something else. Baked tomatoes have a little different flavor than raw ones. You taste no sweetness from the brown sugar in this recipe. It might have been better with fresh garden tomatoes instead of ones from the grocery store. I didn’t have a mushiness problem. I used slightly drier bread cubes made from leftover French bread. For assembly I sautéed my onions and butter in the microwave and mixed the spices into the butter and onions. Then the instructions would be better to say to gently fold the tomato slices into the spiced onion mixture to coat. I think firmer tomatoes help too. Then, also gently, fold in the bread cubes to coat. Then, still gently, spread in your baking pan to bake. I made this at noon and baked it for supper. The tomato slices and bread cubes still held up well. I might try adding some parmesan cheese to the leftovers.

This was a very good side dish for people who like tomatoes.  I am not a tomato-lover, yet I have got over my childish dislike of them, so I enjoyed this dish.  It is very tasty.  However, my picky siblings did not enjoy it.  It's definitely better not to serve to kids.

Loved this recipe. It's a great way to use the abundant harvest we have had this year & it tastes delicious. As others have done I used seasoned croutons, added garlic & topped with Parmesan cheese for the last 2 min. My husband called the meal a feast. This will be my 'go to' recipe for tomatoes.

This recipe sounded unusual but I was looking for something different to do with homegrown tomatoes.  We enjoyed this very much and I will be preparing tomatoes this way again.  I halved recipe to serve just 2 people. I did not add mozzarella as some reviews suggested and I'm glad I didn't.  This doesn't need the extra calories or sodium. I did use less brown sugar as ripe tomatoes were extremely sweet.

Great recipe, everyone loved it.  Tips: slice tomatoes and lay them on paper towels to get some of the liquid out.  I used some toasted bread and seasoned bread cubes that you make stuffing with.  They held up great and did not get mushy.

When unpacking my groceries, I discovered that my  plum tomatoes had been "roughed up" quite a bit in transit. They needed to be used quickly and in a way that would disguise their condition. On the advice of other reviewers, I toasted my bread cubes in the oven prior to mixing them in with the tomatoes, onions, and seasonings.  Also, I had fresh basil on hand, so I tossed some in, along with the dried basil that is called for. I love the flavor, but I find the mushy bread cubes give this dish an unpleasant texture. My mother used to make a similar dish that called for garlic croutons and was cooked in the microwave. I will try this again, but topped with bread cubes or croutons, not mixed in.

Delicious!! This recipe is perfect for using up tomatoes that are not so red & ripe. Even better the next day reheated in the oven! I made sourdough bread in my bread machine just to make this recipe. This is now a monthly meal my son asks for.

Loved this dish.  I did add just a little parmesan cheese and mozz. cheese.  I will be making this again. This would be real good without the cheese. Thank you Linda.

I really wasn't sure what to expect from this one, but was intrigued enough to give it a try.  I thought the bread (I used a nice Italian bread) did get soggy in parts and that was to be expected, I suppose.  I would suggest toasting it beforehand (or going with others' suggestions in using seasoned croutons) but really, as is, it's pretty dang delicious.

I have been making this for years. My 2 year old grandaughter can't get enough of them. We have to remove them from the table or they are all she will eat. I use part of the butter to dab on top.

I followed the recipe to a tee and used homegrown tomatoes. Though I didn't hear complaints, noone helped themselves to seconds. The end result was soggy, and chewing on tomato peels was bothersome. I will try the recipe again peeling first and using drier bread cubes.

These were excellent!  I used store bought "vine ripened" tomatoes and they came out great.  I am sure they would be even better with home grown tomatoes.

This was an interesting recipe that offered up a way to use those extra garden tomatoes. I liked the concept of this recipe and it smelled wonderful during baking. I added garlic, freshly sliced basil and grated parmesan cheese to add more dimension.

There were textural issues which created a mushy result. I saw that other reviewers suggested using croutons in place of bread cubes to get an element of crispness. However, I would recommend this recipe to tomato lovers since it has so many positive reviews. It was both a healthy and  creative way to use tomatoes.

This is a very good recipe, but it needed croutons instead of bread. I used  garlic flavoured croutons.  I added parmesan cheese into the casserole, my husband also suggested adding sauteed boneless, skinless seasoned chicken, which I did the next time, then topped it all with more parmesan cheese & mozzarella cheese. It was delicious!!!

This turned out great with a few tweaks.  I only used 1 tbsp of butter, 2 tsp brown sugar, whole wheat bread cubes, and 2 tbs Parmesan sprinkled on top. It turned out way better than expected!

Very very tasty. Used homegrown tomatoes and seasoned croutons, added a little garlic, and topped with parmesan shavings during the last 10 minutes. Will be sure to make again soon.

The original version of this recipe was something my mom used to make.  I made it once for my husband and he didn't like it.  Then I saw something similar on a cooking show but with some additions.  The additions were garlic, basil and cheese.   I love the original.  Hubby loved the morphed version.  Each is a great way to showcase fresh out of the garden tomatoes.  And in mid winter, try it with canned diced tomatoes.  takes you right back to summer!!!

Great dish! I used it as a side dish with scrambled eggs and whole wheat pancakes - basically in place of hashbrown casserole.  The only change I made was to use whole wheat bread and I toasted it before mixing it in.  The flavor was great.  Like another reviewer said - I may peel the tomatoes next time.  Also it was a little soupy.  But overall it was a great compliment with our brunch.

I also added cheese, parmesan and a mozza cheddar blend... I forgot the brown sugar but sure did not miss it.   Yummmmm!  I also just used some foccacia croutons instead of the bread cubes.   A very good vegan side dish to use up my Roma tomatoes!  Thanks Linda for the awesome recipe!

YUMMY!  I added a bit of garlic and a sprinkling of parmesan cheese.  I also used old bread - dryer than normal.  The bread was sourdough cheese bread, and that added even more to the flavor.  Thanks!  A very adaptable recipe.

This was so good, I used my own canned tomatoes and crushen them up a little bit.  I also used the unseasoned bread stuffing.  It was alot easier than cubing up the bread.  I took the advice of other reviewers and added garlic and cheese on top.   My family loved it, we fought over the last spoon full.

I made this the other night and thought it was really tasty.  I cut the suger to about 3 tbs., added garlic (because I just had to!) and used fresh herbs with parm and garlic/herb croutons.  I finished it off last night with a little chedder and some guacamole on top.  Very tasty!!!  Thanks!!

I baked this in a 9x9 inch square pan. I used 3 hot house tomatoes and a bit more basil.You definitely don't need any butter for this recipe. Saves you alot of calories too. I'm on a diet so I ate mine as dinner. This is great when its hot. Very yummy!

I DOUBLED THE RECIPE, BUT I USED STILL THE SAME AMOUNT OF BUTTER AND 1 ONION FOR A SINGLE BATCH. WE DON'T LIKE ALOT OF ONION FLAVOR. I CUT THE BUTTER TO CUT FAT. IT WORKED REAL GOOD. I SIMMERED ALL INGREDIENTS ON TOP OF THE STOVE. DIDN'T WANT TO HEAT UP THE HOUSE.  WORKED GREAT FOR US. THANKS, CATHY

The taste is almost good enough to be a dessert.  I make this recipe as is using homegrown heirloom tomatoes and left over challah bread.  This is my go to recipe to use up large amounts of tomatoes at the end of the season when our  tomatoes all seem to peak at the same time.

DELICIOUS. It's like tomato stuffing. I added some more seasoning based on other reviews. Some marjoram, extra dried basil and a little garlic powder. I did not expect such fantasic results. I will be making it again!

I was really hungry for breaded tomatoes. Found this recipe but did not have fresh tomatoes or white bread. I substituted a 28 oz can of stewed tomatoes, only 3 tsp of brown sugar and 2 cups of cut up dinner rolls. Also used a 9 x 9 glass dish. DELICIOUS,

We had a ton of tomatoes this year, and I was running out of ideas.  This was very good (husband approved!).  I did use seasoned stuffing cubes instead of fresh bread cubes, and substituted oregano for the basil (just because I didn't have any basil).  This is a keeper!

This is a great recipe.  Very tasty - my only suggestion would be to use very crusty bread.  I used Texas Toast sized white bread the first time and it turned out ok because I didn't use much.  I used gluten-free white bread the second time and it was mush.  The crustier the bread, the better off you'll be.  Delicious though - the tomatoes don't need the bread much so I'd keep the bread to a minimum.

I used croutons and I think that's definitely the way to go.  I used fresh cracked peppercorn and I think the taste took over the flavor. I will use black pepper and less of it the next time I make this. Was very different and a good way to use fresh garden tomatoes.

Served this for a side dish at dinner and everyone liked it.  I substituted seasoned stuffing mix instead of bread crumbs. It was not soggy. I thought the hardness of the stuffing mix would hold better than bread crumbs and it turned out great.

Have made this several times now for family and friends and it is always a hit with everyone!  Only change I have made is to use toasted whole wheat  or rye bread.  Really great and the rye adds an excellent flavor without overpowering the original recipe.

We were not crazy about this. I had some tomatoes and croutons to use up, so I took others' advice and used seasoned croutons (possibly too many) in place of bread. It was edible, but that's all I can say. Tastes like stewed tomatoes and bread cubes mixed together.  Could possibly be improved with the addition of a huge amount of melted cheese!

I am not a big tomato fan but this recipe is sooo delicious.  I had a bunch of tomatoes from my CSA & did not know what to do with them. I figured I would try this. I will definitely make this again.  I made it as is other than adding Parmesan cheese.

Was easy to do. Took the advice from other reviewers and add minced garlic, used seasoned dry croutons, and toped with parmesan cheese for the last 10 minutes. Next time I think I shall try a sharp cheddar instead of parmesan. Oh and use a 9X9 pan instead of the 9x13.

I just made this dish because I need to use the abundance of tomatoes from my garden & I was not disappointed! My husband and I are really enjoying this! It's not something I would have ever thought of as  a summer dish but pairs well with my grilled chicken. The only changes I made, after reading the reviews, were adding garlic & fresh basil. I also toasted the bread & I also had a green pepper from my garden that needed to be used so I added it when i sautéed the onion & garlic! Delicious. I will make this again! Thanks for the great idea.

This is a fabulous recipe.  I made it as directed.  I used a crusty bakery-style roasted garlic bread.  To keep it from getting soggy, I put the tomato mixture in the 9x13 pan and placed the bread cubes on top to get kind of crispy in the oven.  Three of us finished one recipe as a side dish to ocean perch, fresh corn on the cob, and cucumbers I had placed in a homemade vinaigrette.  Magnificent.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe.  I will make it again and again while I have so many tomatoes.  I'm sure this would be good with canned tomatoes as well.

8 16 15 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/14031/scalloped-tomatoes/ ... I didn't add any sugar - using homegrown toms.  I doubled the bread cubes (juicy toms) using Italian bread & topped with panko.  Adding cheese & garlic would be a good idea.  A simple, but good dish.  The panko made a nice topping.  Sprinkled on fresh basil.

I really loved this recipe-simple and delicious. I eye-balled the bread, so it may have had more than two cups. Other than that, I made it as written. I used some grape tomatoes fresh from my garden. It would be a great base recipe. My kitchen smelled wonderful. Alas, I cannot take a picture of it because it is all gone. (note to self-always take picture before you try it).

This is a recipe often found throughout Italy - with a few adjustments.  Olive oil in place of butter, fresh basil in place of dried, day old bread made into croutons in place of bread, garlic added to the onion saute, Romano cheese added to mixture, & topped off with mozzarella cheese.  Drizzle lightly with extra-virgin olive oil when it comes out of the oven & you are all set!

This dish is so delicious.  My husband went back for seconds and is looking forward to me making it again soon.  I didn't have any white bread.  So, I used Seasoned Italian Croutons and omitted the salt.  I also added some extra tomatoes and topped it with mild cheddar cheese.

I used tomatoes that I had blanched and froze from last year's garden, and drained most of the juice. I followed the recipe, adding additional brown sugar because we like them sweeter, basil, garlic salt and parmesan cheese. Instead of white bread cubes, I chopped up garlic herb rolls my hubby had bought at the bakery. We loved this and it will be a go-to recipe for our tomatoes this year!

Really good and a great way to use up old bread and ends of tomatoes. I had extra tops and bottoms along with a slice of ciabatta that worked very well without pre-toasting. Parmesan was added at the baking stage and some mozzarella the last 10 minutes which I would definitely do again. The dish was put together early in the day and refrigerated, but baking it uncovered made a great consistency for us. Thanks for the recipe - we'll use it regularly.

This was excellent. So glad to find a recipe with fresh tomatoes as I used to make a version with diced canned tomatoes.  Only changes were that i used gluten free bread cubes and I misread the recipe and used 1/4 c brown sugar.  For our taste that was perfect!

Made this with the last of the cherry tomatoes from our garden. Left out the onions because of an intolerance in the family. I toasted the bread cubes and used gluten free bread. Served with parmesan to sprinkle  on at the table because not all of us can eat cheese, and it was delicious. Thanks!

Came out a little soupy, but was very tasty! If you have an overabundance of tomatoes from your garden it is a great recipe for them!

Pretty awesome. It was a bit soggy but the taste made up for it. This would make an awesome pizza sauce.

I finally found out the secret to perfect pizza sauce, this is it! Actually, its perfect just as it is! I think I added a tsp more of brown sugar. Used olive oil instead of butter. Can't wait to make this again. Probaly costs under $5 to make a batch. Great side dish or if you love tomatoes like me, this is dinner!

Lou and I loved this. We use the extra and blended it into a meat sauce and covered home made manicotti too. Absolutely wonderful.

My mother made a similar side dish with the same ingredients but cooked it entirely on the stovetop.  I liked the fact that the baking thickened the juices slightly and resulted in more of a "pudding."  This was wonderful served alongside Chicken Piccata.

This is a such an easy side.  We love bruchetta and this tastes like a simpler, one dish way to do it. Thanks!

Tasty, but became a soggy mess once cooked.  The texture just wasn't appetizing.

This made a very nice side dish. Great when you have extra tomatoes that you need to get rid of.  I added a little cheese to mine.

This was a nice alternative for veggie fare. I loved it and remember my mom making something similar when I was a kid... but my husband and son didn't care for it. I think it would work for a ladies luncheon. I'll make it again just for me! Thanks Linda!

This was almost like a desert for me.   I made this a couple of months ago, I'll have to go back and make it again.  I love tomatoes.  I'll have to go to the farmers market and get some fresh ones!
