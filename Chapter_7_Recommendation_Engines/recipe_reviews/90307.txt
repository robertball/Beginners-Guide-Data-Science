This was absolutely awfull.  The 7 lemons & coconut milk = SOUR.  The sugared nuts...not enough butter to melt the sugar and it sure doesn't happen between 7 & 10 minutes...don't waste your time.  A simple citrus & honey recipe is great on fruit salad...Glad I didn't pour it over my beautiful fruit!!
