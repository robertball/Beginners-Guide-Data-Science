I used extra-large eggs and soybean oil, and those were the only changes.  The cookies turned out LARGE and beautiful.  Lots of strawberry flavor.  They have a soft texture.  I would make them again; but, they will not be part of my regular rotation.  I think the 2 1/2 tablespoon size is too large.  I got a dozen big cookies, but could have gotten 2 dozen if I had made them smaller.  They were really sweet.  That could mean I should use a different brand of cake mix.
