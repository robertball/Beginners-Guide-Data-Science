Instead of baking the spaghetti squash, try microwaving.  I put cut side down in a pyrex dish, add about 1/3 cup water, cover with plastic wrap, and it takes about 15 minutes.

Sooooo good! My boyfriend and I loved this recipe! However I did make some alteration to the cooking of the spaghetti squash. Instead, I cut it in half, placed it open side UP, sprinkled it with seasoning salt, garlic powder, dried minced onion, and oregano, and then placed half a stick of butter inside each half of the squash. I added a whole package of turkey (20 oz.) then followed the rest of the recipe to a tee. This puts any type of pasta recipe to shame! My boyfriend was  excited to have leftovers for the next day as well. I will definately be using this recipe again!

Absolutely delicious and as easy as it gets.  I didn't have ground turkey on hand, so I removed the casings from 3 reduced fat sausage links, sauteed separately and drained the grease, then added to the sauce as it simmered.  I also added a 14 oz can of diced tomatoes with Italian seasonings (undrained), which made the sauce extra hearty.  Next time I'm going to try adding some mushrooms, or maybe using cannellini in place of the turkey for an even healthier (and Lenten appropriate!) version.  Word to the wise - don't skimp on the grated cheese!

My husband is on phase 1 of the South Beach diet.  This was a great recipe for him and he loved it!  It was a good way to curb a pasta fix and we didn't feel super full as we would have with the equivalent amount of pasta =)

What a great way to satisfy the spaghetti craving if you are on a lower carb diet.  My family is very picky and they said this recipe was a keeper.  Only omitted the capers. This dish also tasted very good as leftovers!

This was great!  Super easy, and very tasty.  It was a nice, low calorie, main meal.  For even faster prep, you can put the squash in a casserole dish with about a 1/2 inch of water, cover with plastic wrap, and microwave for about 15 minutes.  However, you will lose a little of that "roasted" taste.  I will definitely make this again!

Not bad. I don't care for either spaghetti squash nor ground turkey, and this was a decent way to fix both. However, even for our Tex-Mex-spicy-loving family, this was too hot. I'd halve the red pepper flakes. As is, it left my lips and mouth feeling burnt.

Fantastic combination of flavors; very earthy and rich. 

Aside from the cooking time for the squash (which in my oven took 90 minutes), it's a cinch to put together.

The spiciness quotient makes it a little less kid-/tenderfoot-friendly as is. I recommend scaling back the red pepper flakes.

This recipe was really good.  We've never had or made spaghetti squash before and my husband was really leary (due to a traumatic squash incident when he was young).  I combined this recipe with the Italian Style Spaghetti Squash recipe from this site.  I cooked the squash in the microwave for about 16 minutes and halfway thru flipped over the halves and put a tbsp of butter into each half with some garlic power and some salt and pepper.  I ommitted the capers and made the sauce using 2 cans of diced tomatoes, red wine, onions, green peppers and zuchinni.  Next time I will drain one can of tomatoes before I add it-- the sauce was slightly watery.  The squash itself doesn't have much flavor-- it is slightly sweet so adding some red pepper to the sauce and salt and pepper was definitely a hit with my husband.  He really liked it and said I should make it when his parents come to visit!

I modified this a little to tailor it to our tastes (and to Hubs’ sensitive innards) and we enjoyed it – its crisp/tender strands of spaghetti squash against the flavorful, tomato-y, slightly piquant sauce.  First of all, because I intended this as a side dish I skipped the turkey.  I was lucky enough to still have tomatoes I had put up from last year’s garden, used  white onion instead of green (but not a half cup, for sure!) and drastically reduced both the oregano and especially the crushed red pepper flakes.  A good sprinkle of  fresh grated Parmigiano-Reggiano upon serving made this particularly delicious.

we were never a spaghetti squash family...but this recipe is AWESOME!  i did change it up a bit.  i added slivered zucchini to the sauteed veggies before i added the meat.  i only used a tiny bit of red pepper flakes and i added mozzarella and parm cheese. when the squash was done i placed it into a baking dish sprayed with PAM then topped it with one layer of the meat then some of the mozzarella, more meat mixture them more mozzarella then a tiny bit of parm.  baked it at 350 for 35 minutes...family loved it.  this is a keeper!!!

Amazing! I made it into more of a sauce by adding some tomato paste and water. I also used fresh basil, Italian parsley, and oregano. My son gobbled it up and wiped the plate clean.

YUM! I used a different method of cooking the squash... I pierced it all over and cooked it at 375 for one hour. It makes it so much easier to cut this way! This sauce recipe was delicious... pretty spicy, just how we like it. I didn't have crushed tomatoes, so I subbed a 15 ounce can of tomato sauce and a 6 oz can of tomato paste. I also simmered it, covered, for about an hour. I love that this uses fresh herbs, and I LOVE that it calls for no salt! Will make this again and again!

WARNING!!: I followed the suggestion a reviewer made to cook the squash in the microwave.  I used a common glass casserole dish I'd used a zillion times in the oven, and I'm positive it must have been microwave safe.  After about 12 min it was done, I took it out, set it on the counter and BAM! it shattered into a million little pieces.

I had to make quite a few changes, such as using dried parsley (it's all I had), white wine vinegar (don't have red wine), used tomato sauce because it's all I had, and left out the ground turkey. I loved it, though, so delicious.

This has become a staple in our household. The flavors are amazing. I've tried a few variations: I use diced tomatoes instead of crushed which makes it less saucy. Ground beef overwhelms it, so stick with turkey. You canmake a vegan version easily with TVP instead of turkey. I use the TVP "crumbles" and add extra oil and an extra half can of diced tomatoes to compensate for the absence of juice from the turkey.

Our new favorite pasta sauce, as we really enjoy the spicy kick!  I'll often add some fresh mushrooms to the onion and garlic saute and stretch that cook time to four minutes, and add a can of petite diced tomatoes to make the sauce even heartier. Dried herbs are just fine too.  I use 1/2 of what the recipe calls for when using dried. And don't usually bother with the capers. Play with it and adjust as you please, you can't go wrong!

This is absolutely perfect! I've never had spaghetti squash, and I thought this was fantastic! Very well written and easy to follow recipe. Love the taste and a nice spicy flavor. I made two change: I halved the red pepper since my husband is not a fan, and I added the whole small bottle (from a four pack) of Cabernet Sauvignon.

The taste was great, and it was a very healthy meal.  I substituted the crushed tomatoes with a jar of marinara sauce to enhance the flavor.  I forgot that the cooked spaghetti squash is very watery and next time I will drain the water out before I serve it.

KEEPER for sure!! Thanks for the FABULOUS recipe!
AMAZING wonderful FLAVOR and sooo simple!  My husband and I couldn't stop eating this!!  
TWEAK:... I don't like to open a bottle of wine when a recipe only calls for 2tblspns... so I substituted the wine with 2 tblspns of cooking sherry... perfect!  Also, I added a dab of butter to the squash before putting the sauce on and I added 2 tblspns of SUGAR to the sauce while it was simmering.  SUGAR cuts the acid in a tomato sauce.  I can't wait to make this again!  It's our new fave!!  Also... DRY oregano is just fine if you don't have fresh.  YUM!!!

I made few changes--microwaving the squash in a Pyrex container with 1/2 inch of water for 15 minutes, then baking it in the oven for about 10 minutes. The sauce was okay, but we all felt like it needed some basil. The squash itself could use a little seasoning too. This is a good base recipe that I will continue to play with.

I really enjoyed this.  My squash was a tad sweet, but it was great texture and did not taste like a vegetable at all.  I did have to cook some regular pasta for hubs, but he enjoyed the sauce.  I did add about a tablespoon of dried basil as I love it in all my pasta sauces, and we both salted to taste at the table.  I also sprinkled about 1/4 cup of feta on mine, hubs used grated parm.

Things I changed: I did not use capers (didn't have any on hand). I put the whole spaghetti squash into the oven at 400 degrees for 60 minutes (it was too difficult to cut in half). I opened it and wasn't completely sure it was soft enough, so I put some olive oil on each half and popped it back in for 15 minutes at 375. The whole dish was so yummy, my husband was pleasantly surprised! Thanks for a great dinner! I will definitely make this again.

Someone gave me a spaghetti squash from their garden and I had no idea what to do with it, but this recipe was a great choice!  I left out the capers, used 1 lb. of turkey, and 1 can diced tomatoes with juice.  We didn't think it was overly spicy and it was really really good!

This is the best spahetti squash recipe ever.  I made many modifications-- according to what I had.  I used cooked chicken breast meat instead of turkey (2 small breasts cut up).  I used 1 cup diced tomatoes and 1 small jar of marinara sauce, which replace the red wine.  I used roughly 2 C of diced onions and diced tomatoes.  No capers.  It turned out great!

Great way to use spaghetti squash.  I used diced tomatoes (a whole can) and 1/2 small can tomato sauce.  I also added an extra tablespoon or 2 of wine an definitely cut back on the peppers.  There is no reason to bake the squash.  Microwave times I noticed in other reviews are too long...will produce a "mushy" squash. For a small squash, microwave about 7 minutes, face down, in about 1/4 cup water.  Cover tightly with plastic wrap.  Next time I will add spinach to the recipe...what could  be bad?

Excellent! Adding to my rotation. Note that the squash produces a lot of juice which will water down your sauce. Scoop the squash into a strainer over the sink to reduce the juice. Also reduced red pepper by half and used diced tomato with jalepenos to add layers to the sauce.

Absolutely Loved It!  Did increase the wine a bit to about 4 tbls as well as the red pepper flakes and garlic ( I like things really spicy!)Great for those on lowcarb diets and craving pasta!  Definately make again!  Note though I recommend using the garlic basil and oregano diced or crushed tomatos for extra flavor!  Thanks Robyn!

I really have never liked squash or zucchini types of vegetables, but there was so much positives about spaghetti squash, I decided to try it. I found this recipe and put it to the test. I added chopped tomatoes to get rid of them and followed everything else as written. This recipe is very easy and pretty quick, my squash was done in the oven ahead of time. I was scared to try the microwave as some comments stated. I was only disappointed that squash is so watery, which is probably one of the reasons I never liked it. Like okra, if you don't have it made correctly when you first try it, you will hate it forever...at least I usually do. I put free mozzarella on it and really liked it. I love the sauce and will likely put it on some fettuccine at some point. I will also cut down a little on the cayenne. This does not take the place of pasta If that is truly what you want, but it is great as a way to enjoy a fun meal in place of a standard pasta dish to save on some calories and carbs. Thanks for the recipe and for helping me to Try something I never would have a year ago.

It didn't look especially pretty (perhaps my squash cooked too long?), but I thought this tasted pretty good. Unfortunately, my 2-year-old (who has pretty expansive tastes) did not agree!

This recipe is awesome. I didnt think it was going to be so easy. I left out capers and I just used the seasonings I had at home... so the only one that was fresh was basil (which isnt in recipe). I made it for a low carb diet but it was so good I will continue to use.

For a family who doesn't particularly like squash or ground turkey, this recipe broke the mold for us. It was a fabulous recipe. We've made it several times, and can't wait for spaghetti squash to go on sale! Made it as is, maybe adding a little extra garlic, and we love it!

the squash has barely any flavor at all to it.  I wouldn't really call this spicy either....unless you add more red pepper or hot peppers of some type...

I have never made or eaten spaghetti squash so when I bought one and found this recipe, it was a must try!  What a fantastic and unique dish...great flavour, healthy and low cal, we loved it!  My only small changes were using dried herbs instead of fresh (was out) and I added a pile of mushrooms in with my onion and garlic, yummy!!

Excellent dish! I made this as written, except I used spicy italian sausage instead of turkey. This recipe is a great alternative to pasta. If you prefer to tone it down some, simply leave out the red pepper.

This was really good. I did take the time and baked the squash for one hour. This gave it a nice flavor. I followed exactly except for the red pepper - which I left out because my family does not like spicy. Everyone loved it even my 13 year old! It was very healthy and light tasting! Will make again!

This is one of the best recipes we've tried.  We did not make any changes to this one and will definitely be making this again in the future.  I did keep a portion without the red pepper flakes for my kiddos as the spice would've been too much for them.  My husband and I enjoyed the original version very much!

I skipped the step of cutting it in half.  I pierced it with a knife all over and nuked it for 10 minutes, not covering it and no water.   Came out perfectly.  I used leftover ground lamb and pork tenderloin for the meat.  Used a 29 oz. can of the crushed tomatoes and omitted the wine and capers.  The thickness of the sauce was just right.  We put freshly grated Romano on it as a great finish.  This was very tasty and also a very attractive dish.  I am going to add cubed eggplant to it for the leftovers.   If served alone, this was enough for 2 of us to eat for one meal and enough for a 2nd meal as leftovers.

This was the first time I had tried spaghetti squash. We enjoyed this recipe very much with a few modifications. I used ground beef instead of turkey since that is what I had on hand. I added a small can of tomato sauce since I wanted thicker sauce. Sugar about 1 tbsp for a little sweetness,1tsp basil and used the tomatoes that had garlic oregano and basil added. My husband raved about it. He said "this is really good and I said thanks". He said" no his is really really really good!" I also left out the capers since it seemed like it did not really go with the other ingredients.

I felt this deserved 5 stars for a very healthy, low fat/low carb meal.  To save time I halved the squash and cooked in a microwave for approximately 10 minutes with halves face down in a pyrex dish and approx 1/4 c of water.  I chose to eliminate the capers and added lots of red pepper flakes to add heat.  Topped with freshly grated parmesan cheese.

Wow, this was so good.  The only reason I gave it 4 sstars and not 5 is because it was way, way too spicy.  I mean I love spice, I am all for it, but this for me was way too spicy.  Next time I will use 1/2 the recommended amount and see how it tastes then.  I mean I could not even have a spoon full without having a drink because my lips were on fire! But this is an amazingly easy recipe and the meal otherwise was edible, although it was painful, because all the red pepper!   Be Warned, use 1/2 the recommended red pepper or be prepared for burnt lips!  Otherwise it would of been so delicious.  My husband could not even get past the first bite, because all the red pepper!   It does freeze well!

The sauce was great.  Kids asked for it again, but on "normal" spaghetti.

This recipe is really, really good! I was looking for something different and I found just that! I don't think it would quite satisfy a pasta craving, as the squash has a very different texture, but it was still delicious!  AND, it's good for you! Can't beat that. Served with some homemade bread.  I'll def be making this again.

This was an extremely good recipe. I ended up cutting the spaghetti squash, placing them cutside down, and microwaving them on high for about 10 minutes before scooping out the flesh. I also omitted the turkey, as I used this as a side dish for a meaty pizza. This was delicious and healthy, my two favorite things!

Wow! This recipe is delicious! I love spaghetti squash and I was looking for something quick and tasty to serve with it. I added more garlic and red pepper flakes as previously suggested.  I also added a little lime juice and parmesan cheese on top. My girlfriend ate the leftovers and absolutely loved it! I will definitely make this again, thanks for the recipe!

My husband has me make this for him weekly now!  This is really, really good.  I make it extra spicy to counter the sweetness of the squash and add lots of fresh grated romano or parmesan cheese on top.

Really loved this recipe! I had never made spaghetti squash before and was afraid I might screw up the texture but it was perfect- it does take a long time in the oven, though. Followed the recipe very closely but added half a can of tomato sauce, upped the oregano, fresh parsley, and garlic. I used tofurky Italian sausage instead of turkey and it matched the flavors beautifully! I also added basil while the sauce was simmering, and I tossed the squash with a tiny amount of butter, sugar, and salt before combining everything. This dish was satisfying but quite low in calories. Thanks for the recipe- I'll definitely be making this again!

Simple and easy. Plus it tasted so similar to high-carb pasta! Great for my South Beach menu. My changes were to omit the capers and scallions (didn't have them on hand), switch basil for the oregano and leave out the turkey this time. Still tasted great! One tip - sometimes spaghetti squash can be wet, so you may have to drain it a bit (esp if you microwaved it with water). Otherwise you'll have a soupy mess.

Way too much red pepper flakes.  
Why not bring them to the table, instead, and let those who care to partake in them sprinkle them on instead.  If I'm using the oven anyway, I roast about 6 to 8 cloves of garlic sprinkled heavily with red pepper flakes in small ramekins and serve them on a lazy susan in the middle of the table along with other condiments.  My boyfriend just loves 'spicy' on his spaghetti type dishes, but I recognize that not everyone does, so this works quite well and if someone wants just a small taste, they can!  :>D

My boyfriend and I really enjoyed this and I will definitely be making it again.  I give it four stars because while it didn't blow my socks off, it is a great healthy recipe.  I did change the recipe a bit though - I only used 1 tblsp of red pepper flakes which was perfect for us and I doubled the onion.  I cooked the squash for 60 min on 375 and that was perfect.  Also, my boyfriend doesn't eat meat so I left out the turkey and added some vegetarian meatballs.

excellent, spicy spaghetti squash.  I already had some leftover spaghetti squash so that cut my prep time down considerably.  I am vegetarian so I left out the turkey but kept the the recipe otherwise. This was an easy dish to prepare and much healthier than eating the same portion of regular pasta.  thanks for sharing!

Found this to be way too spicy for my taste, which was disappointing because the sauce looked really great while making it - my fault 20/20 hindsight just wish i hadn't put the red pepper flakes in there.  Will try again without the red pepper flakes next time.

Hubby and I liked this and he is hard to please! Some changes I made: 
- Cut the squash in half and baked it for about 15-20 minutes and then took it out and microwaved both halves together for about 7 minutes. 
- No capers, no red wine, no crushed tomato
- Used fresh tomatoes and some spicy tomato sauce and added some mushrooms too!

This is so wonderful. I have tried spaghetti squash a couple of times in the past, and was less than impressed, so I was a little hesitant about this recipe. Not to worry, it's delicious! Changes: I had a can of diced tomatoes, not crushed, and it was only about 1 3/4 cup, so I added some jarred Prego to the mix. I don't keep wine in the house, so that was out. I had some pesto in the fridge that was wanting to be used for something, so I added a bit of that. Cut the red pepper in half and I think next time I'll use close to the full amount. Also added a couple of leaves of fresh chopped basil because I had it on hand. I almost didn't use the capers, but those went in too. Overall, this is a great sauce that will make a repeat appearance here, whether it's over spaghetti squash or regular spaghetti. Thanks so much for sharing.

This was awesome! I made it for my dad who was recently diagnosed with the first stages of diabetes and he thought it was great - did make one adjustment - added about 4 teaspoons of capers instead of 2, but that's just personal taste, we love capers! Also used fresh tomatoes (didn't have a can) and boiled them for a couple of minutes before adding, and turned out great :)

Wow - I actually like this better than spaghetti with sauce.  I even went back for halves (half of seconds).    I'll be very sad when squash season is over.

This is a must try! This was the first time I tried spaghetti squash - glad it was in this recipe! The only change I made was to use tomatoes with chile peppers to add to the spicy.  The combination of the sweet squash and the spicy sauce really worked. Left overs the next day made a great lunch. Will be part of my regular rotation. Thank you for this low cal flavorful recipe

Excellent meal, I was worried about the squash at first because I dont particularly like other types of squash much.  This one howeer has a nice flavor and mingles with all of the other flavors really well.  I added a finely chopped red bell pepper while cooking down the onions which tasted great. I will be making this one on a regular basis! Being a type 2 diabetic, recipes like this are life savers!

YUMMY!  My whole family loved this (from my 82 year old MIL to my 17 year old son).  My hubby said "Don't lose that recipe."  I made it as written although I did microwave the squash for 10 mins with a bit of water instead of baking it.  Also cut back the red pepper flakes to 1 1/2 tsp.  Thanks!

Easy and delicious!  Made this last night and used what I had; the changes included 20 oz ground turkey and an entire large can of Muir's crushed tomatoes.  I had reduced the red pepper flakes to one teaspoon but later decided the two would have been just fine (not too spicy).  Everything else I followed exactly.  Roasting the squash in the oven is much better than the microwave (more of a roasted flavor).  No extra butter is needed...keep it healthy, it's delicious as is!

I'd never made spaghetti squash before.  I'm usually a butternut or acorn fan.  Since my husband is a newly diagnosed diabetic, I've been looking for new recipes to try.  This sounded good.  I was wrong - it was great!  I took other reviewers advice and cut the crushed red pepper in half.  I'm so happy I did.. It was hot enough that way.  I'll definitely be making this again, as it was wonderfully reminicent of "real" spaghetti, but much better nutritionally for my family at this time.  It got the kids to eat squash - gotta love that!

In the interest of full disclosure, I will note that I had never had spaghetti squash before I made this recipe.  The sauce forms the basis of this rating, however, since it could be seen as a "universal" sauce, usable over any number of different bases.  This was alright, but nothing spectacular.  If I make this again (I probably will), I will leave out the capers and perhaps substitute something like mustard powder in its place.

the sauce is really good, hard to believe it is so low sodium.  Would be good used with lots of other things: grains, pasta, or crepes.

This was really good and fresh tasting. I made a few modifications...left out the green onion (didn't have any), used dried seasonings instead of fresh (didn't have any), added some leftover shitake mushrooms  when I cooked the onion/garlic mixture, used ground chicken instead of turkey (didn't have any), used about a tablespoon more of wine than called for, added a little salt at the end. This was so easy, healthy and quick. Even my teenagers loved it!

I really liked this recipe.  It was my first experience with spaghetti squash.  Scraping it out of the shell is very cool!  My husband did not like this recipe only because of the texture of the squash.  He and I both really liked the sauce.  I will at least make the sauce again.

I had so much spaghetti squash over the summer that I tried several recipes. This one was super! I didn't have capers so I just left them out. For me this needed more squash so after the first time making this I used a larger squash.

So-o-o yummy.  I didn't have the ground turkey but had leftover meatloaf and used it instead (crumbled up).  The oregano and capers really do the trick!

I really enjoyed the taste and texture of the dish. The only ingredient I left out (not in my pantry when making this) was the capers, but I still thought this had a lot of flavor depth. The red pepper flakes did add heat, so people not as comfortable with spicy/hot foods heat might want to cut that in half or omit entirely. I also took the advice of several others to prepare the spaghetti squash in the microwave. It cut the preparation time significantly without impacting taste.

I (sort of) made this. Left out capers, red wine and green onions.  Used dried oregano, basil and thyme, added more minced garlic.  Used organic ground beef.  Added chopped red bell peppers and sweet onions.  It was great!  Forgot the picture, but will be making again ;-)

The sauce is very easy to make and satisfyingly flavorful (I used extra-lean ground beef instead of turkey, because that's what I had around), and the spaghetti squash has a nice flavor and texture. The only thing is that it gives off a good bit of water after you take it out of the shell, so let it sit first in a collander so it will drain before you put the sauce over it.

So delicious!!! My family loves it. Some cautionary notes: I think the servings are off. I made 2.5 times the amount (2 medium-size squash, 2.5 lbs turkey), and it was just enough for the 5 of us (admittedly it was 4 hungry men, but just so you know). 6 servings with one small squash seems way off to me. I also cook the squash for 80-90 minutes. I cut the red pepper flakes in half.

Delicious. I got my VERY picky boyfriend to eat this by replacing diced tomatoes with tomato sauce and eliminating capers. The spicy kick really makes it! Will definitely make this again and recommend to friends.

Great recipe!  Followed the suggestion to cook spaghetti squash halves upright with salt, onion flakes, oregano and butter.  Was generous with the wine but added it before tomatoes to let the alcohol cook off.  Also added a tsp of brown sugar to balance the acid of the tomatoes after they had cooked for a few minutes.

I had to make some substitutions, I had no red wine, I used balsamic vinegar, I hate capers-I omitted, I don't care for cilantro-I omitted, I had extra mushrooms so I added them.  I'm not saying that is what people need to do, just what I did.  We really enjoyed this meal. My 8 year old step son couldn't even tell it wasn't spaghetti noodles.  It was indeed spicy, but we like spicy.  This will be my go to recipe for spaghetti from now on.

Wow! Delicious! Adjustable to your tastes. I didn't have turkey so I used ground pork and pork sausage. To me, the capers and wine are what give it a wonderful depth. I cooked my spaghetti squash in my pressure cooker- 8 min, garlic sale and Italian seasoning. Yum!!!  Let us summer for at least an hour to meld the flavors.

Very tasty and a great alternative to pasta noodles. Remove meat for a vegan option.

We enjoyed this recipe a lot. Only thing is our squash took so long to cook so I may up the temperature next time. I made this recipe because I was looking how to roast the squash and found that I had many of the additional items needed so why now try it! This actually worked well with some frozen cooked turkey meat we had leftover from a previous dinner.

Pretty easy. I did have to buy quite a few seasonings & such that I didn't already have, but apparently worth it because everyone said they liked it! I have 5 kids and it's almost impossible to find meals they all like, but they said to definitely make this again

I made it exactly from the recipe the first time and loved it--my husband thought it was great and there  was not a bit left over! The second time I made it I altered it quite a bit due to what I had on hand--I had leftover pork that I cubed up, the spaghetti squash, onions, garlic, scallions and capers. I cheated by using a really good organic marinara sauce and it was awesome! What a terrific recipe that is easy to make or alter :o)

This was simple and delicious. The sauce had tremendous flavor with a faintly piquant bite due to the capers. You can add as little or as much hot pepper flakes as you like. I added a moderate amount and loved the bite. The spaghetti squash was every bit as satisfying as wheat pasta without those empty carbs and high glycemic index.

This is awesome! We tried it because Hubby is diabetic... Trust me on this... you don't need that disease to love this healthy plate of heaven!! I do flip the squash upright ,after a bit , pour a small amount of olive oil into center & baste it around. Then sprinkle any seasonings I want, especially Italian, Basil, Garlic Powder, Salt & Pepper

Just made this tonight for the first time. I was just trying to look up the cook time on spaghetti squash because I couldn't remember and came across this recipe. Was actually going to use jar spaghetti sauce. My daughter had told me at the grocery store that we had sauce at home, but when I went to get it discovered it was salsa and not spaghetti sauce! So, I decided to try this one. Sooooo glad we were out of jar spaghetti sauce so I had to try this! Will totally be making this again, and will be in regular rotation at our house! I made one change...by accident. I was adding spices, but when I went to my cupboard I was thinking red pepper...not flakes. So, I added a full teaspoon of cayenne pepper instead of the pepper flakes. As soon as I dumped it in, I thought, wait, that's a lot of cayenne!! LOL It was spicy, but we love spice and not too spicy for us! Also, chose to not do the ground turkey this time (we use all the time normally though) because I had some organic chicken and spinach sausages from Costco we opted for I made separate  since we have a vegetarian in the family.

This is one of my favorite recipes! I add more crushed red pepper because I’m a fan of spicy and sometimes a bit of tomato paste to thicken the sauce but otherwise wouldn’t change a thing about it.

Yummy, easy and filling dish.  More like 4 servings than 6.  You don't really need to let the squash cool after cooking - so you can make the sauce in parallel and finish faster.  Heats up well as leftovers (I stored them separately).

This was fairly bland. The red peppers add some heat, but very little taste. If I make it again, I will probably change the turkey to beef, make sure to drain, switch from crushed tomato to a tomato sauce, and season the squash.

Definitely a good substitute for pasta and something different for the family to try.  We liked this recipe.  I only put half the recipe for red pepper flakes after reading some comments, and I also took some advice and seasoned the squash before baking.

The red pepper flakes overwhelm this recipe.  I only put in 1 tsp. while increasing the rest of the ingredients and it was still too spicy for us.  I guess, in fairness, it is called SPICY spaghetti squash but for me, it didn't balance well, even with less red pepper...  Also, this would have been better if after the squash is almost done to mix with the other ingredients, lay it out almost flat, add some Parmesan cheese and stick it under the broiler for a few minutes to crisp.  I will not be making this again but if you like spaghetti squash and HOT sauce, go for it.

Great Recipe! i cheat and just add the ground turkey to a simple pasta sauce, omit the capers and add a little  more of the pepper flakes.Sprinkle with shredded mozzarella or Parmesan. keep sauce and squash separate for leftovers. Squash reheated with a little butter and parmesan - the bomb! Definitely a keeper recipe.

This was my first time cooking spagetti squash  

The flavours of this recipe were a delicious blend and the texture of the spagetti squash was perfect.  I didn't have turkey, so I used leftover chicken.  The only real adjustment I made to the ingredients was cutting the amount of red pepper flake used in half and it still had a nice spicy bite.  

Easy to make, delicious to eat and oh so healthy!

Very good.  1 squash halved for 2 people though, not 4 - that would not be enough.  Could also be a good vegetarian dish.

This was the first time I tried Spaghetti Squash, and WOW awesome! This recipe was a great but however, I love using hot Italian turkey sausage when doing a meat sauce. Just remove the casings and ground like you would any other meat. It adds great flavor and is still more healthy than beef. I also added fresh green bell pepper. Will be adding this to our regular menu!

This recipe was great! I didn't have capers, red wine, or green onions so I just used half a regular red onion. Also, I substituted the 2 cups crushed tomatoes for pasta sauce. Will definitely make it again, and I might season the turkey with spices.

This was awfully tasty! I followed the directions more or less as is, but cut a little bit of the red pepper flakes out and added a little extra spaghetti sauce I had in the fridge but only because I wanted it to be a little saucier. The spaghetti squash was perfect with this dish, and my picky eater of a boyfriend asked me to make it again, so if he wants it you know it's good!

Good!  Took a lot of time to prep, usually I make dishes that take less time to take.  My husband and I didn't have any leftovers.  I doubt I'd make it again and I'd definitely recommend giving it a try.  I used diced tomatoes instead of crushed (one can), a whole package of ground turkey, all dried spices, no capers, and leeks instead of an onion.  .

Pretty good.  I used dried oregano instead of fresh which was a bit overpowering.  Next time will add a small amount of brown sugar to balance the flavors.

OMG!  This dish is wonderful!  I would order it over a bowl of pasta any day.  The squash is so satisfying.  The taste is delicious.  I didn't have the capers and I used 2 cans of Italian stewed tomatoes(drained).  Would be great for entertaining guests.

Very good and very easy. We left out the red pepper flakes due to the toddler and it was still fantastic. I added a can of diced tomatoes per other reviews and put the whole package of turkey in as well.  So yummy.

Delicious.  Gobbled up quick.  Used Italian Sausage, only because that is what I had on hand.

Healthy and delicious.  I used "chili-ready" diced tomatoes because that was all I had, so I omitted the oregano and the red pepper.  I will try it next time with regular crushed tomatoes.

Pretty good. I prefer my spaghetti sauce with spaghetti squash instead of this recipe so it wouldn't go into my regular rotation. However, if I was looking for something in a pinch and had all the ingredients for this dish, I'd make it again.

Awesome recipe! Highly recommend trying this one. I substituted ground veal+lamb for the ground turkey, and doubled the amounts of oregano and capers. Super yummy!
