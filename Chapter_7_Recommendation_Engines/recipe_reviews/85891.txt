I normally don't try recipes from this website with only 2 reviews, but this one sounded interesting so I made it. I made it as directed, then transferred it to a crockpot, and let it simmer for a few hours. I also added meatballs from another recipe on this website. (To me it just isn't spaghetti without meatballs!) When eating, I wasn't sure, something seemed missing. I then re-read the recipe and realized I had totally forgot to add the sugar and had also forgotten to season with salt and pepper as directed at the end of the directions. So the next day I threw the leftovers in the crockpot, added about a tablespoon of brown sugar, some salt and pepper, and just for fun, threw in a cup of red merlot wine. Let it simmer for a couple of hours. Oh my goodness, it was amazing. Served it with multi grain pasta. My favourite spaghetti sauce recipe from this website so far. Glad I gave it a chance.
ps - I also forgot to add tomato paste, and found I didn't miss it - sauce was still plenty thick enough. Next time I make, I will try adding and see if it makes a difference.

I made this a couple of weeks ago, and it was my first attempt at making homemade spaghetti sauce.  It was delicious!  The only changes I made were to add 1/2 pound of cooked, crumbled Italian sausage and 1/2 pound of cooked hamburger.  I'm making it again tonight!

Nice easy sauce Inger.  I make a sauce close to this but without the chicken granuals (and with pork & beef), and since I was using this to make chicken cacciatore, I was like "bonus"!  It worked out fantastic, not only for the cacciatore, but for my daughter who won't eat my normal sauce because I add beef to it....she like it on her spaghetti tonight.  I cut the oil down to about 2 tbsp.  Don't be afraid to add the sugar...I use brown sugar (about 2 tbsp), as it does take the acidity from the tomatoes.  Thanks for the easy recipe!

I made this sauce today.  I just threw it all in the crockpot rather than doing it on the stovetop so I could run some errands while it simmered.  It was very good.  My husband and I thought it was perfect as is without adjusting the recipe at all.

Great sauce recipe! I must admit that I haven't ever made it with all of the veggies (husband isn't a veggie guy...) but whenever I just can't stand the thought of sauce from a jar, this is the recipe that I always go to, and that rates it 5 stars in my book. It just has that 'authentic' taste. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was my first homemade spaghetti sauce and it turned out very well.  I made it in the crock-pot so I could fix it and forget it.  I also added more vegetables like cooked carrots and then pureed it after it all cooked because we like a smooth sauce.  This is a great way to sneak in tons of veggies.

i thought this was good but a bit too salty... probably due to the chicken bouillon.

We were not crazy about this sauce.  It really turned out pretty much like doctored up crushed tomatoes.  The texture is not sauce like and it has way to much green pepper for us.  The green pepper is definately the dominant flavor in this.  I might try to doctor  up the left overs a little and maybe use my imersion blender to smooth out the texture.  Thanks anyway but I'll keep searching for a great spaghetti sauce recipe.

I had a bunch of garden tomatoes I wanted to use so I decided to make this recipe and freeze it in portion-size zip lock bags.  Using my digital kitchen scale, I weighed out the equivalent amount of fresh tomatoes.  I just chopped them, not worrying about peeling them or removing the seeds.  Like others I made this completely in my crock pot and I used brown sugar, rather than white, and added it to taste.   Last night I pulled some out of the freezer to serve with spaghetti and Johnsonville Italian Meatballs, also from this site.  When I reheated it, I decided to add a little cornstarch/water slurry, just enough to give it some body.  I had been tempted to puree the finished sauce, but decided against it, and both Hubs and I really liked the chunkiness of it. It was delicious, and a terrific way to use our wonderful summer tomatoes!  Iâ€™d definitely make this one again!

I have to admit, the unusual ingredients (bouillon, poultry seasoning) were what caught my eye in this recipe.  I'm lazy, so I skipped the sauteeing and tossed everything in the crock pot on low for a few hours.  I overdid the sugar (scant T instead of t...oops), making it a tad sweet so be sure to start w/the correct amount and add to taste.  I also added a little red wine for some depth and a can of petite diced tomatoes for some texture, per personal preference.  I skipped the green pepper, simply because I didn't have one on hand, but will try adding it the next time.  THANKS, Inger, for a great tasting sauce!

Best spaghetti sauce we've ever eaten! We even use it for our pizza sauce. I make it in the crock pot - just throw everything in, set it on high for 4 hours, and done! Because my husband and I are on a low-sodium diet, we use no-sodium chicken bouillon granules and no salt added tomato paste. It cuts the sodium content down significantly without cutting out the flavor. I usually remove 2/3 of it for freezing, then add a pound of cooked ground chicken to the remainder in the crock pot and let it sit on warm for 30 minutes, so the chicken can absorb the flavor of the sauce. 5 stars! :)

I've never made spaghetti sauce before and was horribly afraid I'd screw it up.  I found this recipe, saw its simplicity and the reviews, and I am SO glad I tried this one instead of another one from the intimidating long list of spaghetti sauce decisions.  It has a wonderful flavor and my hubby loved it.

I found this recipe really easy. The only thing that I added was some water because it got kinda thick and started to burn the bottom of the pan and my temp was only on 3/4 so not very hot. The end product was amazing though.

This spaghetti sauce was delicious.  I used 1 teaspoon of sugar and that was perfect.  We used this sauce for a family get together and the whole family was happy

Served this sauce tonight.  My family is not keen on meatballs, so I skipped them.  The sauce was "nice".  Nothing special but the chicken boullion and poultry seasoning intrigued me.  I didn't have 4 hours to simmer it.  Let it simmer for 15 minutes.  I was told tomatoes simmered any longer then this turn bitter and sour.  Maybe next time I'll try the full four hours and see if it makes the difference between "nice" and GREAT.

I thought very good. I used fresh basil from my garden so adjusted the amount for fresh. My bf likes a lot of spice, so next time I will use more basil, oregano, garlic. I used fire roasted canned tomatoes for it. Will keep this one for my spaghetti sauce recipe for sure, thanks!

I've made this a couple of times. It's easy and delicious!!! I used home grown tomatoes from the garden. I reduced the chicken seasoning to just 2 boullions, no more or it's too salty. In addition to the 1 tsp of sugar, I added about 1 tablespoon of brown sugar, and I used 4 garlic cloves.  Also I did sautÃ©e it all and put it in the crockpot on low for a few hours. It's great but tastes even better the next day. I'll never used jar spaghetti sauce again.

I was thrilled to find this non-chuncky sauce recipe, I hate having huge chuncks of tomato in the sauce and this one really solved that issue. It turned out great, I used brown sugar instead of white sugar. I used it to make manictotti and it was a big hit.

I work overseas and am based on a UN camp for 2 months at a time. It is recipes like this that make us not miss convenience items of home like canned sauce. I made this once for our crew and became the go-to guy for making pasta sauce. Thank you very much! It is great as is, only change I made was adding some chili peppers, because we all like a bit of spice.

Excellent and very flavorful recipe! I did add ground beef/ground venison mix to the sauce, and was surprised to find that the chicken seasoning and bouillon worked very well with it! I will definitely be saving this one!

This is a very good sauce, and simple to make. I made a huge batch of it and canned it for later! I love being able to go to my fruit cellar and bring up jars of goodies instead of having to spend so much time in the kitchen everyday.

this was delcious!  Made with garden tomatoes so needed to add a little baking soda to reduce acid, also cooked with couple carrots and removed before serving to reduce acid.  Will definitely make again.  I also added Italian seasoning and parsley

This was my first time trying home made spaghetti sauce.  I find the store-bought sauces too salty.   I left out the bouillon granules and seasoning mix, and just added a pinch of salt and pepper.  I also added zuchinni and mushrooms. The sauce was great and I didn't have to drink a gallon of water afterwards!

This was an easy sauce to make.  I followed all the directions and then threw it into the crock pot for a few hours to simmer.  It was good but a bit too tomato-y for me.  I wanted to add something but just couldn't put my finger on what it was.  As is, it was great on meatball subs but for pasta it needed something extra.  I like the tip to add a cup of merlot.  That might tweak it to my liking!

Superb and simple sauce.  Omit the pepper if you like.  Very forgiving and flexible.  We use it for all kinds of dishes, including chicken parmigiana.  Terrific!

First time from scratch.  Was intrigued by the chicken spices so I thought I'd try this one first.  
Followed the direction, except that we like mushrooms and ground beef in our spaghetti sauce so I added those.  SautÃ©ed the onions, peppers, garlic, and mushrooms.  Then browned and drained the meat and added all ingredients into the pressure cooker.  Cooked for 30 min. in the pressure cooker and done since the wife and I were hungry and didn't feel like waiting 4 hours!
My wife says it's the best spaghetti sauce she's ever had!  It is very delicious.  Next time I think I'll use brown sugar instead of white sugar and maybe a little more than a teaspoon for my taste.
Done looking for a from scratch spaghetti sauce after first try!

Some in the family liked this sauce but I did not.  I'm used to a thick sweet sauce and this was really pretty bland and oily.  My husband is super fussy and like it but I will not make again.   I did serve over chicken.

I refused to drive to the store, so made due with some substitutions of stuff I had on hand. It still looks and smells delicious and tastes really good! This batch will be refrigerated overnight and then put in small batch containers in the freezer to go with the meatballs I'm making next. It went together quick and easy!!

I followed the recipe and added celery, grated carrots, mushrooms (my leftover veggies) and cooked this in the crockpot on low heat for about 10 hours.  I needed to add more sugar to cut the sour/tart taste down but I'm not sure if that was caused by all the extra veggies I threw in.  I love the idea of throwing everything in the crockpot and letting it go.  No frying, no need to watch the stove....just let it go.  I would make this again but need to figure out the sugar balance.

I did make some changes because I didn't have all the ingredients, but generally, I followed it.  The major change was using tomato sauce instead of the other tomato products and adding red chili pepper.  I loved it!  I will make it again!

I didn't have crushed tomatoes like I thought, so I used 28 oz of diced tomatoes and 28 oz tomato sauce. I added a pound of ground turkey to make it meat sauce.  Overall, I thought it was quite bland.  The poultry seasoning is the strongest flavor and it just didn't work for me.  I also think the oil could have been cut down.

This is a great pasta sauce. Making more today and doubling it! The only change I made was I used fresh tomatoes from the garden. I store it in the freezer in bags that hold just enough for my husband and I.

My entire family loves this! I have made this several times! I used 2 TBSP of brown sugar, 1 1/2 tsp of salt and let it cook for 6 hours.  I let it cool and pack it away in ziplock bags for later use.

Its amazing, I use this all the time. The only thing I change is I do not use that much sugar if at all because I like the more acidly taste. But that is a preference. You can also finish this in the crock pot.

My family really liked this spaghetti sauce, definitely will make again. Followed the recipe, but instead of using 2 cans of crushed tomatoes, I used one and crushed tomatoes from our garden. Only item I didn't have on hand was the poultry seasoning, seemed fine without it. I also used 1 tsp white sugar and a little more than a Tblsp. brown sugar and simmered for hours. Delicious!
