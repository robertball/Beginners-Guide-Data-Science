Cora!  Girlfriend.  Way to make me look like a rockstar in the privacy of my own home (which is all that really matters to me).  

The only thing I did differently was BBQ/grill the chicken breasts before tossing them into the soup.  
To be perfectly honest?  My thinking was, if this doesn't pan out at least the chicken will be on point.  Well we loved it, all.

I have THE world's pickiest (and most honest) hubby and he was raving.  

The lime and Sriracha ending are everything, don't leave them out.  Same with cilantro.  You know what?  Don't leave anything out, this bad boy is on point.

I thought this was an awesome, simple recipe. I added some other ingredients which I think made it more amazing and just as simple. I added tomatoes, curry, fish sauce, chicken stock, chili powder, and coconut milk. I sprinkled curry over my chicken and added to the broth. I also added a spoonful of fish sauce and substituted chicken stock for chicken bouillon.

Great recipe! the only modification I made was to cook a chicken under pressure in 8 cups of water with a packet of chicken bullion, stained the broth adding it in along with the two shredded chicken breast.

We loved this! I used the crock pot because of timing.  I sautéed the onion and mushrooms until golden then pressed in the garlic, stirred a bit and dumped it into the crockpot with 2 cartons of chicken stock. I peeled a piece of ginger and dropped it in along with a large boneless skinless chicken breast and let it cook for a couple of hours. When I got home I shredded the chicken, dropped in the noodles and chopped the cilantro and green onions while the noodles cooked. Add the sprouts, cilantro and green onions before serving and remove the ginger chunk. Serve with soy sauce and lime and offer the other suggested add-ins to taste.

Yum! I used basil instead of cilantro, and 4 cups chicken broth with 4 cups water and bouillon for the total of 8 cups. This is a really yummy dish and is really easy if you have the chicken cooked ahead of time. Definitely rivals pho bought at a restaurant.

Great, simple recipe.  I made it vegetarian by using veggie bullion cubes & tofu, then added jalapeños for some extra spice.

Delicious! I did make a few tweaks. I used a carton of tom yum soup base instead of the bouillon, I browned one cubed chicken breast and added that in with a pound of sauteed shrimp. With the bean sprouts I added a thinly sliced serrano pepper, I sprinkled the green onion and cilantro on individual servings as a garnish. Also, I had some leftover cold rice so that went into the bowls first with the soup poured over instead of using the maifun this time. Definitely a keeper recipe and so glad to have found it here! This will be made again and often!

Just a note, if you put the rice noodles in when the recipe says, they will disintegrate. They only need to be soaked in hot water for a minute. Drizzle with sesame oil before serving.

This is really good..I added just a few other things to it and used better than bouillon reduced sodium for the chicken broth and it's really good. I also added some fresh ginger, fish sauce and some mint..very good. Been looking for a good recipe and this was it..thanks for sharing! I wanted to add bok choy but couldn't get any so added water chestnuts...actually pretty tasty...

I made this for the first time and I'm impressed how much I liked it. To make life even easier my local grocery (Wegmans) store had Pho broth base in the freezer section. Look for it!

I used chicken broth instead of bouillon and water and went heavy on the sriracha. I thought this was easy, quick and delicious.

I actually used this recipe as a starting point but made it with beef broth and added sliced beef for the protein. I also added some soy sauce stew started.  It came out great.

Put chicken into the crockpot in the morning with canned broth.  In the evening finishing was a snap and everyone loved it.  Yummy and healthy!  A keeper.

Absolutely delicious! We didn't actually cook the chicken before dumping it in the soup but it cooked in a couple of minutes and was fine. Didn't add bean sprouts. Used vegetable bouillon instead of chicken. Topped with Thai basil as well.

This soup is delicious and easy to make.  I have used chicken breasts that I have boiled myself and I have used a roasted store bought chicken both were very good.

This was very good but slightly bland to me, thus the 4 vs 5 star rating. I would make it again but adjust for a little more flavor.

I LOVED this!  My husband said it was really good and he doesn't ever say that.  He TOLD ME TO WRITE DOWN THAT HE WILL EAT THIS AGAIN,  I didn't measure anything.  I loaded up on the garlic. Added a little curry.  Added hot pepper seeds.  I used part chicken broth, part chicken bullion, part chicken stock.   Skip the lime, better without.
