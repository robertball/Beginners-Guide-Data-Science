I added fresh crushed garlic to the marinade, then baked the chicken instead of frying.  We avoid frying. Delish!
Next time I'm going to cook it on the grill-- I think that would be even better.

This was awesome.  Very quick and easy to make, we used chicken drumsticks, served it with rice and a vegetable--perfect!!  Very, very tasty.

Tasty and easy.  My husband loved and I loved it.  My husband especially liked the subtle hint of olive flavor.  Yummy!!

I know that this is a fried chicken recipe, so I am sorry for messing with that part, but for anyone wondering how this tastes as a healthier recipe here it is. I cut the olive oil down to 2 Tbsp, keep everything else the same, marinate and grill on our indoor electric grill. It is the best darn chicken EVER. Ever.

We liked the lemon flavor, but I could not resist putting a light coat of flour on the chicken before frying it.  I think it was a positive addition.

Fabulous flavor in this.  I added more cinnamon, and would definitely use less olive oil next time.  This chicken tastes great cold, and would be great on a green or ceasar salad. This will definitely be a regular in my roster.

This is a great recipe! It is now my VERY picky daughters' favorite chicken. The only suggestion I have is less oil in the skillet. I did drain most of the oil from the pan before I browned the chicken and it turned out excellent. If you like a LOT of flavor you'll love this chicken!

I just wanted to add to my review and say that I made this again on my foreman grill and LOVED it. The taste was the same without the extra grease. We love this recipe so much!!!

We really enjoyed this - to get the marinade to really work, poke all the pieces well with a fork before marinating.  I also let it marinate for about 2 hours - wonderful flavor throughout the meat - not just on surface.

This was great and I will make again. But I did change the amount of pepper to 1 tsp. 1-1/2 Tablespoon just seemd like way too much. Also add about 1/4 cup white wine.

This chicken needs more time to marinate, I was short on time and it showed on this dish. Not much flavor :( Sorry GJMavris.

We **loved** this recipe! We recently moved from Tampa Bay, which has Tarpon Springs and the home of the best Greek food anywhere. Great Greek restaurants are a dime-a-dozen there, but very rare where we now live. Finding this recipe was awesome! I added 10 cloves of fresh chopped garlic to the marinade and it was just right for us. Also used virgin coconut oil to fry the chicken in, as it is much better for frying than olive oil (low burn point). Poured all the marinade into the skillet after browning the chicken on both sides, then put the lid on for a few minutes. The chicken was moist and flavorful, and the roasted garlic that carmelized in the skillet added some amazing flavor and a light crunchy texture to the plated dish. Definitely now my go-to Greek chicken recipe! If there were more stars in the rating, I would click them all!

SO DARN GOOD!!!  However, I didn't have any lemon juice on hand so I had to skip that AND instead of using the spices listed I used Penzey's Greek Seasoning (and dusted lightly with flour as somebody else had suggested).  The cooking method was FANTASTIC and my family and I loved the end result.  I will definitely make this again the same as I did only add the lemon juice as indicated.  ENJOY!!!

I used just a little oil in the marinade, then baked the chicken and served it with rice. It turned out beautifully, and I can't wait to make it for my friends!

Yes, oh yes!!!  I used only 1/2 t. salt because we're watching our BP and one T. of Greek Seasoning (from this website) instead of the spices listed.  Instead of using another half cup of olive oil for frying, used only a couple of tablespoons and added the marinade to the skillet as well.  Must of been mightly good...there were no leftovers and some serious finger licking going on...

This recipe is easy, it comes out right every time.  Use a dark olive oil if you want any of the olive taste.

My husband really liked this but I thought it was just ok. It was very easy and the chicken was very tender but a little bland for me.

Great flavor!

I cheated and used Cavendar's Greek Seasoning instead of all of the different spices listed and I used store bought lemon juice instead of fresh lemon, but it was great.

A little salty, but that was my fault for adding too much seasoning.  Will definitely make again.

This chicken is so good I'm certain it would be just as good baked or grilled. We had it fried. It was moist and delicious. Next time we will use the grill.

The dish, as is, can be lovely when paired with something else.  I did use Greek seasoning for all the herbs.... I ended up browning bacon in the skillet with the chicken, followed up with a bit of minced garlic. Then lightly browned flour before adding warmed milk  to make a cream sauce out of the leftover marinade and pan juices. Let that simmer for a bit to thicken and let the flower taste melt away before adding some fresh dill and then thinned it a little with lemon juice. Sliced chicken and tomato over pasta and topped with sauce. I tried to keep everything the same but BF is on a strange diet where he needs sauces to be able to swallow.   The BF loved it! Thank you. Will make again!

Fantastic!  This is a very flavorful recipe, with the wonderful Greek seasonings just right.  After marinating the chicken, I poured the whole thing into the hot skillet, thus reducing the oil by 1/2 cup; still plenty of oil just in the marinade to fry the chicken.   My family raved; I will definitely be making this again.

Overall, I loved this! I added fresh minced garlic, smoked paprika, and some zest from the lemon. The lemon juice overpowered the rest of the flavors (not enough to make me not like it, but enough to make me say "wow, this is really lemony!") and toughened the meat, so next time I will use only a bit of the zest. Otherwise, this recipe is a keeper. Oh! I also pan fried the chicken in just a drizzle of olive oil, instead of frying it as the instructions suggest. Next time I will grill it, I think.
