This was a wonderful chili it had great taste and even the kids enjoyed it. Each kind of bean and the spice blend really worked together to make it very flavorful. I only used one onion because we are not onion lovers. This makes a TON of chili; it barely fit in my biggest stock pot! It was perfect though because I wanted to freeze some and now have enough in my freezer for 3 more dinners. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

This is a good mild chili. I served over corn chips and topped it with Mexican Shredded Cheese.
