This is the way I have baked ham for the last 35 years. Always tasty! I have gotten lazy over the years and just chuck a couple of 20 oz cans of chunk pineapple in the bottom along with the Vernors (got to be Vernors!) and the brown sugar and left off the cherries. Still good! I only baked it for 3 hours, turned out fine. Thanks for the recipe!

I couldn't get a hold of MY Grandmother to get her ham recipe (which is VERY similar to this one) so I decided to make YOUR Grandmother's recipe instead.  Easy and delicious!  Thanks!

Our family has  made ham like this for as long as I can remember.  I use less brown sugar than called for and baste several times during baking. It tastes as good as it smells while baking. Served with  Pineapple Bake from this site.  Thanks for posting, Dawn

This ham had some great taste to it.. Just not great for this family.. I am not sure what it was or wasn't because I was sure this was the way my grandma did it as well and everybody loved hers.. There was just something slightly off for us... We did eat it and were not saying it was bad, it just wasn't for us.... Mine did over cook slightly around the edges but Im sure that's from falling asleep in the wee hours trying to cook Thanksgiving dinner...

Never made a ham this way before but certainly would make it again.  The ham was not dry and the sweetness balanced the salty nature of the ham that we are not overly fond of to begin with.

This is also my Granny's Easter Ham Recipe!  The only difference is she used whole clove pieces to hold the pineapples and cherries in place, which flavored the ham slightly but didn't overwhelm the other flavors.  Discard the Cloves when serving up.

I am not a big fan of ham.. However this recipe has completely changed my mind! I followed it to the letter and it turned out fantastic! My husband could not stop eating it, and raving about it! I wouldn't change a thing. The sauce is perfect for basting over the ham, too. Thank you for an amazing recipe! It's a keeper:)
