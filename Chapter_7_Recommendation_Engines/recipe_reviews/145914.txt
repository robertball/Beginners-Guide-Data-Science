I cooked my string beans in some salted boiling water for a few minutes (3-4 minutes), I used frozen string beans.  We like our veggies crunchy so I undercook a little bit and then quickly rinse with cold water.  I sauteed the garlic in the olive oil.  I threw the green beans in a bowl poured garlic and oil over the whole thing and squeezed 1/2 of a fresh lemon and tossed again.  Added a tiny bit of salt and it was great.  I think 1/4 cup of oil is too much.  2 tablespoons is more than  enough.  Follow your common sense when cooking and you'll never go wrong. Thanks for sharing.

I think you need to be Italian to really enjoy this dish.  My boyfriend's whole family makes a variation of these green beans and they love them. My friend's overweight 13 year old daughter won't eat any vegetables, she told her mom the only ones she can eat are green beans. So I made her a batch and she ate the whole thing!  I used 4 garlic cloves and sunflower oil instead of oil (my preference). I also substitute a little white vinegar in place of some of the lemon juice.

Tasty. I use shallots instead of garlic due to allergy. Simple to make. They can be served cold and are quite good that way.

After reading many reviews that said this recipe was too oily I decided to cut the oil down to 2 tablespoons and I had a little more than a pound of beans. I first boiled the beans in salted water and then rinsed them with cold water. I sauted the garlic in oil and poured it over the beans. They were great with the changes.

Love the flavor.  I lightly steamed the green beans and then heated up  1/8 cup of olive oil and 2 tablespoons of butter and garlic in a fry pan.  Stir fried the green beans lightly, adding salt and pepper to taste.  Topped with sliced almonds.

For those who don't like the tartness of the lemon juice, cut down to 1 tablespoon and use the zest of half a lemon.  Loads of lemon flavor without the sourness.  I also cut down on the olive oil to 2 tablespoons and added a bit of fresh ground black pepper. One of my favorite ways to prepare green beans!

These remind me of the green beans from Bucco di Beppo, one of my favorite Italian restaurants.  I loved them, my son who wont eat green beans ate the.  Husband said they were ok.  I personally could eat them like this everyday.

I boiled the beans for 10 minutes, removed into a bowl and then covered them in one large lemons juice and garlic salt.  I thought they were a great side dish and I didn't even bother with the oil.

As is, I didn't care for the recipe, but  I saved the lemon juice/oil mix by adding More lemon juice (I didn't measure), then adding some onion power, adobo, minced garlic,pepper, AND the special addition of organic unrefined brown sugar! That made the mix taste great.

Very good! I increased the garlic to 2 cloves and used some McComick Montreal Steak Seasoning to the dressing. Very Quick and Easy!

I like garlic so used 3 cloves of grated garlic, added about a tablespoon of honey and some freshly ground black pepper. I didnâ€™t have lemon so used about 1/8th cup fresh lime juice instead. The recipe came out much better than expected, was very tasty but I agree with another reviewer that quarter cup oil is too much. I will make this again.

Am a big fan of lemon, so these were a big hit with me as well as my family. It was a nice change serving them at room temp!  Quick and easy, too.

I used about 1/8 cup of EVOO and 1/8 cup of lemon juice. I cooked the beans about 20 minutes. My husband who is not fond of string beans actually asked me to save the recipe.

The original recipe was ok. By the time we got to the table, they were cold. I think heating the mixer and pouring right on the beans. Then let it sit for 2-3 min would be better.
