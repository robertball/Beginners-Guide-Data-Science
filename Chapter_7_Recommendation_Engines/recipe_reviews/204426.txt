Don't knock it until you try it. This is really one of the ultimate salty/sweet combinations. I heard about this first on Diners, Drive-in's and Dives and we had to make this for ourselves. It's really good. No, really. Just make sure you do use a good quality dog and a nice brand of swiss cheese.

This is the best hot dog recipe i've ever tried.  I also recommend when you melt the cheese on the hot dog with the lid on it pouring a splash of chicken broth in the pan before you cover it over, MMMM steamy chicken goodness!

I used raspberry instead of strawberry jam and regular hot dogs. The taste is there, but the method needs a little work to make execution easier. I thought Monte Cristo sandwiches are supposed to be lightly battered then deep-fried? No matter, we thought this was an interesting twist on your traditional hot dog, as we enjoy sweet and savoury combinations. Served this with "Carolyn's Sweet Potato Fries" from AR.

I used turkey dogs, since that's what I eat, and I have to say that I am a big fan. I do not think I will brave eating this in front of the man or friends, but when I am home alone - with no one but my dogs to make gross faces and ridicule me, you betcha!

This was excellent!  The sweetness of the jam and the saltiness of the meat was a wonderful combo! I will make these again!

Awesome. So easy to make. I've also tried it with rasberry jam and it was great! Think I might try cream cheese and jam next time. Definitely a winner. Thanks for the recipe!!

My husband loves the monte cristo so i made these for lunch one day.  He wasn't overly impressed, but we did enjoy the new variation of hot dog this presents.

I used an Angus beef dog and made this on a brioche hot dog bun. I also added some chopped cooked bacon and used seedless raspberry jam.  This was AWESOME!!!?? Thanks for your recipe! Hope you don't mind the changes! Petite Chef Ann, from Ann's Around Town, L.L.C.

I gave this a 4 because I didn't have strawberry jam and had to use grape jelly and I thought it was GREAT! It is a keeper for me when I need a hotdog with style!

Wow, these are good!  We didn't have strawberry jam (!!) so I had to substitute cherry, and they were still yummy.  Quick and easy to make.  My kids and husband and I really enjoyed this different twist on hot dogs!

This was the sophisticated hot dog recipe we have been waiting for...even the kids asked for seconds.
