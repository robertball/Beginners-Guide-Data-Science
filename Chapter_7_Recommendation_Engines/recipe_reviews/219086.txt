For those who love the taste of squash, this recipe is definitely for you!  This recipe is for the squash lover at heart, and those who are looking for something really sugar sweet and coated will not find happiness here.  All of us at the house decided this isn't the recipe for us as we prefer more...spice and less in your face squash flavor.  The glaze was fantastic, but there simply wasn't enough to go around for us to enjoy our squash with.  We're headed back to nutmeg, agave, cinnamon and vanilla.  I halved the recipe and omitted the cayenne as the kids don't do spicy.

I tried this recipe for my first-ever encounter with acorn squash!  I prepared it exactly as instructed, with the one exception of softening the squash in the microwave before cutting it in half (so much easier!).  I pierced it with a fork and nuked it for about 5 minutes, then reduced the initial time in the oven to 20 minutes.  It turned out beautifully.  Scoring the flesh really allowed the glaze to seep in well, and my guests loved the fact that the glaze was sweet, but not TOO sweet.  It is refreshing to stumble upon an acorn squash recipe that doesn't drown the flavor in butter and brown sugar!  As I side dish, I prepared rice with sauteed celery, mushrooms, apples, onions, water chestnuts, almonds, and Craisins.  It was a delicious and relatively simple autumn meal, and I will be making it again!

Another great Chef John creation.  Simple, delicious and nutritious.  Very family friendly.  I made the sauce in a small glass measuring cup in the microwave.  Easy cleanup.

Pretty good side dish, the scoring made the glaze adhere better, but the cooking time on the written recipe isn't accurate, should cook longer the second part of cooking more like 40 minutes as in the video.
Thanks for the recipe

Thanks, Chef John!!!  Love the wonderful squash flavor shining through!  I didn't have orange juice the second time I made it so I substituted a small can of Dole pineapple juice.  Didn't even need the brown sugar with the sweetness of the pineapple.  A definite go-to for my family!

I thought this was really a winner. I read some of the other reviews and took some of their advice. I changed the orange juice to pineapple juice and doubled the maple syrup and butter but took out the brown sugar. The best part was the cayenne pepper. When you first taste this dish it is sweet but in the aftermath of your bite... a nice warmth from the cayenne. I will sure make this again!

This was wonderfully delicious!  The only trouble I had was scoring the squash; find the right knife and be careful!  I found a small paring knife to be the best once I cut the squash in half.  Great recipe.

Recipe is a keeper! The squash was not as ripe as I would have liked it. It wasn't that beautiful orange color of John's in the video. Next time I will get the squash from the Farmer's Market instead of Walmart.

I added some fresh oj to the glaze as well and just divided that equally into the squash and served with the glaze in the middle.

I did not find that this extra work really did much for the squash. It is possible that the squash did not have the best flavour to start with.  You know how it can be with squash. I will not bother again.

To be fair, I did not have orange juice so maybe that's what would push this to 5 stars but for us it was just ok.  I think we all preferred just the brown sugar and butter traditional way of baking acorn squash.  That being said, Chef John has always delivered 5 star recipes for me so I will try this again when I have orage juice.

I love this recipe. It's so easy to make but the roasting and accompanying glaze gives it such a rich and complex taste. I follow it exactly as written and am never disappointed. Just make sure the acorn squash is ripe and it's best to make when in season only.

Timing was off. 45 minutes on the front side, 30 is more accurate for the 2nd stage. Plus, you don't add any liquid to help steam the squash. I had to cover it with foil to finish it off.

This recipe is delicious. I meant to buy Butternut Squash but my supermarket was out of it. So I bought Acorn Squash instead and went straight to Chef John to see what he would do with it. I had to make another trip to the market for maple syrup and a navel orange but it was worth it!! Thanks, Chef John, this recipe is a keeper. And for a 2-person household, Acorn Squash is more the right size than the typical Butternut. It's going to be a great fall!!

This was a wonderful treat to have a side dish. I only made one and saved one half for leftovers. The glaze came out real well.  In the photos, it's unseeded. But in the recipe's ingredients, it doesn't say to remove them. Maybe it should before you add the glaze. I'll remember to remove it the next time I make it.

Very tasty.  I didn't have orange juice so I put some apple cider on them before the initial roasting.  Mine were overcooked and dry with the total time but my squash were on the small side so keep track of how long you bake based on the size.

This was the second time I've cooked acorn squash and I guess I just don't like it. I gave the recipe three stars because it's easy to make and it looks nice but I had to fill the cavity with mini marshmallows and toast them to find it palatable. If you already know you like acorn squash, you'll probably like it.

This turned out ok but prepared as directed, it seemed a little bland.  I ended up adding more brown sugar at the end.  I will make again but with a few changes (like I mentioned above).

The squash came out Wonderful!  I did cook it longer for the second round, as was previously suggested by another reviewer,40 minutes.  My only additions were a spoonful of Orange Marmalade and pinch of Chili powder (instead of the cayenne powder) into the sauce.  I will definitely be making this again!

I made this mostly as written, the only exception was  that following a reviewer's comment, I nuked the squash for about 5 minutes after poking a few holes in it and decreased the first round in the oven to 20mn. It softened the squash enough to make it much easier to score. The squash came out perfect. Don't forget the sprinkle of salt.  I used sea salt,  it gave the squash a perfect slightly salty sweetness. I've used a similar recipe and it was rather disappointing. I think scoring the squash allowed the brown sugar mixture to seep down. Another hit from Chef John. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I "taste tested" so much of the delicious glaze, I had to make a second batch for the squash!  Due to food allergies, I substituted lime juice for orange juice (lime & spicy pepper go together, right?), olive oil for butter. Skipped the sugar to let the maple syrup dominate the flavors.  The saltiness was like salted caramel.  And the cayenne was magic.

This is an excellent recipe.  I double the glaze.  Don't leave out the tiniest bit of cayenne.  It's what takes this recipe to gourmet.  It doesn't add heat just an amazing flavor combination with the other ingredients!

As usual,  Chef John comes through with an adaptation of a good dish that elevates it to the next level.  The mixture of sweet and a hint of kick is my favorite part.  I may try it with a tad more cayenne next time.

11.08.16 ~ Yum! Loved the hint of orange in this squash. Simple to make, great to the taste. Served this with 'Roasted Pork Loin', 'Alyson's Broccoli Salad' from AR and Brussels Sprouts. I will be making this recipe, again.

Really, really good!  Followed ingredients exactly but made the glaze in a bowl in the microwave for ease.   Love the slight heat with the sweet and salty flavors.  Depending on the size of your squash, you may want to use less or more glaze.

I have clients that don't cook with salt or butter. I used honey and orange juice along with pepper and cinnamon.  They raved at how delicious it was.

Yum!
1st time making acorn squash.
The only thing I did different was cut ingredients in half (only made 1 squash) and scored squash with knife after the first 30 min "softening". Also, I squeezed a "Cutie" orange onto the squash instead.
Awsome taste and super easy to make - thanks!

P.S.
I made the squash seeds like we do pumpkin seeds...extra bonus with this squash....

Made as written except omitted sugar and baked about 10 minutes longer on first step. It was delicious!  Not too sweet and just barely a hint of heat. Easy too.  I'm making it again tomorrow!

Just ok.....made just as written but it seemed to lack much flavor.  Someone said that they thought it might be the squash didn't have much flavor in itself and that could be it but I still prefer just plain old butter and brown sugar in the acorn squash.  The grooves gave some visual appeal  and I will do that little part again, but as much as I love Chef John's recipes, this one just didn't do it for me!

This was delicious!  I did make some changes, I used less butter and then substituted coconut sugar for brown sugar and used agave nectar and honey in place of some of the maple syrup (I used a tiny bit of real maple syrup).  I will make this again.

I have been baking squash for 50 years and never thought of scoring to absorb more flavor.  Works like a charm.  I used
1/2 tsp  cinnamon and pinch of nutmeg instead of cayenne. 
Delicious and will certainly make again.

My entire family absolutely loves this recipe. I also switch it up a bit with substituting the orange juice with apple cider. Then apple cider creates a slightly different flavor. Both ways are YUMMY and the kids don't even have a clue how nutritious it is for them! ;)

It was very good, though someone drank my orange juice so had to use apple cider. I did add a bit more cinnamon to balance with the cider. Turned out very good.

Used Apple juice instead of orange since it was what I had in the fridge. Squash was perfect. Sweet enough to get the kiddos to eat it but not too sweet. Cooking time was spot on for me. I like the scoring concept. It provided a little twist on the appearance and gave more texture for the glaze to adhere.

This is "hands-down" the best glaze I have ever tasted in my life! I made these acorn squash & I fell in love. I ended up putting the glaze on everything on my plate because it was so good. I added 2 tablespoons of vanilla flavor to mines as well. It's awesome & I now make it for other dishes as well. I highly recommend this if you need a good glaze for anything. Good job Chef John!

Liked the orange juice-maple-spices glaze.
For a not too sweet note I used salted butter and skipped the brown sugar.

Not a winner here. The combo of sugar, syrup and squash flavors just didn't work for our tastes. Going to try some variations with less sweetness added.

I used this recipe and stuffed it with apple stuffing (Apple-Stuffed Acorn Squash). Excellent!

I make this a few times a month. My hubby (Chris, the Veggie Hater) loves it!  I only change it by using lite whipped  butter and skipping the brown sugar.  Maple syrup seems to be enough.  I also use the microwave to melt butter, syrup, etc.  works out fine.  Chef John is becoming my "go to" guy.  Love him!

OK.  Prefer just butter or orange juice on my squash.  Less sweet.

This was delicious. The rare times I have eaten squash, never liked them. However, this recipe is excellent! I have become a fan of squash thanks to this recipe!
