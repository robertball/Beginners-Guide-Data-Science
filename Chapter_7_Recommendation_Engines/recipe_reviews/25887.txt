Leave out the mayonaise and the red pepper, and increase the horseradish and it's just like the famous restaurant version! Yummy!

I served this with a standing rib roast to rave reviews from my guests. I used real mayonnaise and full fat sour cream instead of the low/non-fat versions called for in the recipe, and doubled the horseradish.

A good recipe. Important to note that horseradish in the jar already contains vinegar- may wish to leave out the vinegar in the recipe for this reason.

Since I was making a spread, more then a "sauce" for a flank steak sandwich, I made some adjustments to this recipe and thought that it was one of the best horseradish sauces I've had.  First off, I used fresh horseradish from the root.  I simply used 1/2 cup of peeled and diced horseradish place in a food processor and processed with 1/4 cup of white wine vinegar and 1 tsp. sugar and a pinch of salt.  It was processed until it was pureed.  If you do not like fresh you can just use prepared horseradish in this step.  However, I feel that the freshness adds to the flavor.  In a small bowl, I then used 2 TBSP of the prepared horseradish above and added the 2tbsp of low-fat mayo.  My hubby does not like sour cream so I used one "triangle" of laughing cow light swiss cheese and creamed it in really well.  Then proceeded with cayenne pepper. We used this as a spread on our sandwiches.  I'm sure if you wanted it as a sauce you can simply thin it out with milk or heavy cream.  Thanks for sharing this recipe as it was a basis to a wonderful spread!

Delicious!!  Not overly horse-raddishy, but added a nice subtle flavor and VERY creamy!  It was excellent with our prime rib roast.

MMMMMMMMMMM. I loved this sauce on a nice piece of fresh cod fish I made last week. I did, however, add more horseradish as we like things a little spicey around here! Thank you Carol.

Good thing I considered another reviewer's suggestion to omit the vinegar.  With her head's up I decided to prepare this first without the vinegar with the thought that I could always add it later.  She was right - I'm so glad I didn't add it, as it was tangy enough without.  Other reviewers who added more horseradish were right on too.  This was on the subtle side, so I nearly doubled it. The ground red pepper (I assume that meant cayenne) didn't appeal to me so I skipped it. I used full fat sour cream and mayonnaise.  With a fair amount of tinkering this turned out ok, but I much prefer "Creamy Horseradish Garlic Spread," also from this site.

Very good.  I used Hellman's light mayo and light sour cream vs. fat free. This is one of those recipes you have to play with a bit to suite your tastes but once you get the right combination you get a very nice sauce.

This is an awesome(!) sauce that my husband selected from this site to go on our 
pit beef when we make it for the family.  Since we can always make it fresh and 
the ingredients are always readily available in our refrigerator, it has become a 
welcome addition to my recipe box folder:)  We used it on our Christmas Prime Rib
and it was really fantastic, but we mostly use it for our Pit Beef sandwiches as we can't
always find Turkoff's Tiger Sauce.  It really gives our sandwiches a taste of "WOW"!

Only one word for this - Delicious!  Served it on Christmas Eve with a rib roast.

"Ilovetoeat" has to be kidding.  They made it for a dessert?  No wonder it went over badly.  Sheesh....

Pretty much tastes like the creamed horseradish you can buy in the store but much more fresh. Kick it up by using the hottest prepared horseradish you can find. I made this to serve with a standing rib roast and it was so delicious I added it to just about everything else short of ice cream after that. Hmmm, ice cream and horseradish? Interesting.....

The red pepper adds a wonderful kick that can be adjusted to taste.  This sauce is great with roast, steak and even deli sandwiches.  We added ketchup to our leftover sauce and used it as a cocktail sauce for shrimp the following night.  YUMMY!

I usually change a recipe even the first time I try it, in order to tweak it according to our personal tastes.   However, the only thing different I did with this one was to make 2 separate cups; one with more horseradish and one with the recipe amount.  My husband loves horseradish but his sinuses don't.  I love horseradish as does our daughter, so I added more for our portion.  I used this as a dip for fried green tomatoes and then as a thinner sauce for grilled yellow summer baby squash.    I thinned it with about 1 tbsp of cream I had in the frig. As we eat a lot of veggies but don't care for the typical butter and salt for seasoning, this recipe will be a staple from now on.

I did not care for this recipe. I followed the recipe proportions exactly, tasted it, then added another T. of horseradish. I let it sit to marry the flavors for a couple hours, but It was very thin, even with full fat mayo and sour cream, and the vinegar completely overpowered the whole sauce.

This was tasty, but I did a few things differently. I read all the reviews first.  Put the ingredients in as written; then made my changes. My Horseradish Sauce is great.

Ooooooh this is excellent.  Can't wait to slather prime rib with this.  Just perfect with a nice kick of heat.  I didnt have red pepper so I added a pinch of cayenne instead.

Served this with a slow cooked roast with garden veggies. I was a bit nervous because I used my home-grown, dried, powdered horseradish for the first time, in the recipe. Got RAVE reviews. I didn't have the sour cream so I used Plain Yogurt. My family loved it. Thank you.

I made this for a Christmas Day Roast and it came out Fantastic. I made it exactly as the recipe called for about three hours before dinner and tasted it as I put in the fridge. The taste of the Cider vinegar seemed very strong. When served the Sauce was smooth creamy and the blended ingredients complimented each other perfectly. Even those who cannot take a lot of "Heat" enjoyed it!

This recipe is PERFECT as is.  I did you regular mayo instead of reduced fat.  It was wonderful with my Prime Rib.  Thanks Carol46 for this 5* recipe.

I made this recipe for dipping w/chicken, pork & beef fondue,( mainly for the beef). I happened to be around horseradish lovers so it went over really well but I thought it was too horsey,(had no sinus problems at all that night!). This would probably be great spread on a steak as indicated but even then I think I would cut back on the horseradish a little. Overall, it's a great recipe and I will definitely use again. Thanks!

I left out the red pepper but otherwise made it exactly as written. It may seem like you need more horseradish but it gets more flavorful  chilling in the fridge. I served it with prime rib and roasted potatoes. I will definitely be making it again!

Made this a few days ago and left sit for the flavors to meld. Served it yesterday with the Corned Beef and most everyone loved it. Some people just don't appreceate good flavor. I didn't have any mayo; used miracle whip instead. We like our sauce to nip back so I added about 1 tee more horseradish. Couldn't a 1/8 t measure so I guessed using 1/4, and went on the heavy side. Thanks for sharing.

I doubled the recipe because my whole family loves horseradish sauce and I always increase the horseradish too. With or without the vinegar is fine. Same with the ground red pepper, not necessary. I have done both but guests usually prefer without red pepper.

It's an okay place to start. No low fat or fat free products, though.  I think the mayo makes it taste too much like a sandwich spread and I was using it for a very nice prime rib. I doubled the amount of horseradish and used a couple dashes of hot pepper flakes.  It was perfect like that.

I used this sauce on french dip sandwiches - yummmmm!  I think it's a perfect horseradish sauce - just the right amount of flavor, not overpowering, a nice consistency.  I'll use it in the future for sure!

This was just like Arby's horsey sauce only richer and had more of a mayo aftertaste. I used extra hot horseradish and it was strong but not too hot. I was impressed with this homemade sauce and will use this again. Thanks for posting!

This was a fantastic recipe and went very well with my prime rib for Christmas dinner.  I didn't add the dry mustard (didn't have it) or the ground red pepper (my step-dad HATES it) and increased the horseradish like some others suggested.

I made this to accompany our Christmas Dinner of beef tenderloin.  This sauce was PERFECT with the beef.  I added a smidge more horseradish than called for, only because we love horseradish.  The sauce was not too spicy at all.  It complemented the meat deliciously.

Unfortunately, it was not to my taste as written.  The cider vinegar really overpowered it.  I remade it without the vinegar and used 1/2 cup of mayonnaise instead of 3T and it was actually very good.

This is fabulous!  Hubby never puts much sauce on his beef, if any, but he kept piling this on!  I didn't have any ground mustard so I used a bit of very coarsely ground mustard. We loved it!

I had to substitute spicy prepared mustard for the mustard powder (1 tbsp vs 1 tsp), but this was delicious. Saving it and making it our go-to for prime rib or tenderloins.

I substituted real mayo and real sour cream for the low fat stuff because I enjoy life.  I also used 3 Tbsp. of horseradish and left out the red pepper because I didn't have any on hand. My version was certainly worthy of more stars, but I just can't bring myself to give a good rating to a recipe that is mostly comprised of ingredients that are made in a lab.

We had a massive amount of left over ham from the Christmas season and so ham sandwiches were in my near future. Being a lover of all things horseradish, I choose this recipe to see how I liked it as a sandwich spread. Followed the directions to a T and it is amazing!  Had all the ingredients in the house which is a huge plus and the sauce will become a staple.

THIS IS AN AWESOME RECIPE. I LOVED IT. REMINDS ME OF THE SAME HORSERADISH SAUCE YOU GET FROM OUTBACK STEAK HOUSE. WILL MAKE AGAIN. GREAT ON BAKED POTATOES AS WELL.

As good (or better) than what you buy at the store, only fresher.  And so easy with ingredients you typically have on hand.  *****UPDATE 5.8.18:   This was delicious on a roast beef sandwich on a ciabatta roll  yesterday , but it also worked well in another recipe on this site, Creole Marmalade Sauce.  I’d just bought a new bottle of super fresh horseradish, so I added a bit more than called for to ramp up the heat.

I could really tell that this was reduced fat.  I think the flavor would be much improved by replacing some of the reduced fat ingredients with their full fat brethren.  I have only tasted it on the spoon; it will be more tolerable with the corned beef I'm serving tomorrow.

I omitted the mayo & the red pepper and added salt to taste.  If you use extra hot horseradish you might want to add 2 tsp., then taste, and add more if needed.  I added 1 Tabl. of horseradish and it is super hot and not suitable for wimps.

With a little tweaking this came out pretty good!  I used a little less cider vinegar and mayonnaise (regular instead of reduced fat).  I also used low fat sour cream instead of nonfat.  Will definitely use again!

my sis-in-law made this and I loved it.  It didn't have a lot of kick so you can always add more horseradish according to your liking.  It was a very nice consistency and I can't wait to make steak to have this again!

Excellent as is!  I am not a horseradish fan, but I really enjoyed this!  Not too strong but I guess if you want a stronger flavor you could add another tablespoon or so of prepared horseradish.

This sauce was WONDERFUL!!  I made it the day before Christmas for Christmas dinner to go with the prime rib, and everyone loved it!  I followed the recipe, for the most part.  I doubled it to start with and I used old fashioned horseradish, not the prepared horseradish.  It turned out great and I will be making this each year to go with the Christmas prime rib!

I absolutely hate horseradish, so I wasn't planning on trying this with the steak my hubby made, but I was so pleasantly surprised.  I loved it, as did my young kids.  It was just a hint of horseradish, not spicy at all.  We made it just as the recipe says.

We usually just prepare our horseradish that grows wild in our garden by adding vinegar and a little sugar... but I wanted to try making the creamy sauce like you can buy in the store... and this came acceptional close to it... very good flavor but far from being as hot as our normal prepared.. I like mine hot so I doubled the horseradish and cut back a little on the sour cream and mayonnaise... it tasted good will make again... espically if it keeps well because I made A LOT!!

I've served this with beef tenderloin for two seperate dinner parties over the last week.  It was so good that the guest where trying it on the potatoes too.  In fact I will try and incorperate into a scalloped potatoe dish soon.  Not too spicy and just the right amount of tang.  Very good.

I don't know how this got 5 stars by other reviewers.  All I could taste was bitterness (maybe it was the vinegar) and I followed the recipe to the T.   I actually threw it out. Would much prefer a nice bernaise sauce with my roast beef.  Sorry, but I have to be honest.

Very yummy- thanks for the recipe!  I like a little more bite and thought this was a tad too mellow, so I added hot horseradish and more of it. Overall very good with the prime rib I paired it with. Even my husband liked it and he HATES horseradish!

This was spectacular and I loved the flavor.  I used extra hot horseradish and it turned out wonderful.  Not to hot for even the tenderest of pallets.

Everyone who ate this on their prime rib on Christmas thought it was wonderful except for my husband.  He would have preferred another TBSP of horseradish in it. But I knew it would be perfect for the people I was serving it to.  When I make it for just the 2 of us or people who I know like spicy, I will add another TBSP of horseradish.

spicy - love it that way - but you have people that are sensitive to heat, hold back 1 T of the horseradish

it was good and everyone liked it with our prime rib. most of us like more of a strong horseradishy taste so i put the jar of 'prepared' next to it so people could adjust it to their liking.

We made this horseradish sauce to go with our Christmas prime rib and it was delicious.  Everyone raved about it. Very easy to make, too. I followed the recipe exactly, except that I used lowfat (instead of nonfat) sour cream. Definitely a keeper.

A high-five to Carol46!  Thanks for the perfect condiment to the Breaded Rib Roast that we had for Christmas Day, 2005.  Everybody loved it.  It has just the right amount of all ingredients, including the ground red pepper, which provides a nice little spice that compliments the bite of the horseradish.  I will remember this one.  Follow up note:  Had this again for Christmas Eve 2007.  We mixed it together quickly for Garlic Prime Rib on this website.  I must try to remember to prepare in advance, which allows the flavors to better mesh.

I changed the recipe just a bit. The recipe was mild for me, so I used 4 tablespoons hot prepared horseradish, and 1/4 teaspoon caynne pepper. Turned out great.

Perfect as is.  Sometimes to switch it up a bit, I add an ounce or so of whipped cream cheese to one ounce less of the sour cream amount.

Our traditional Christmas dinner is whole beef tenderloin, and the table would not be complete without this sauce.  I must agree with the reviewers who noted that when using prepared horseradish, we can omit the cider vinegar.  Make this sauce a couple of days ahead, and double the recipe!  It's great on leftover tenderloin sandwiches.

i mixed all the ingredients except for the sour cream. i added the sour cream a bit at  a time to get the flavor i wanted. I used regular mayo. It was the best horseradish sauce i have had and have  eaten it with beef, pork and lamb.

I wish I would have read the reviews first. Waaay too much vinegar. I used up all my ingredients so can't remake. Maybe it will mellow before serving time.

Fantastic sauce. I added a little more horseradish to taste no also used white pepper instead of ground red to keep it white. My spouse kept finding things to put it on for the next week.

Nice recipe. I made it with the vinegar and it overpowered the sauce. I agree with everyone that said to omit it and also to add extra horseradish.

I did not like the cider vinegar in this. It seemed too acidic or bitter. I countered it with some lemon juice and worcestershire sauce. Don't know how that worked, but it did. I didn't have enough prepared horseradish, so I added a couple of shakes of tabasco to get that heat factor. Gotta stock up! :) A really good guide on some great horseradish sauce, though! I'll make it again...

If you use the Horseradish in jar,  skip the cider vinegar...too much.  Otherwise very good.

I have made this a few times.  The only addition that I made the last time was adding the juice of  half of a lime.  Either way it is a solid 4 stars.  The family seems to prefer the lime addition to tone the spiciness.

Made it but added less vinegar per reviews. Used 2 tsp white vinegar, couple dashes of garlic powder, cracked fresh black pepper, 2 tsp Worcestershire sauce, and a Tbsp of Dijon mustard. (Sampled it before our additions and after adding, we absolutely loved it).

My first try at horseradish sauce and it was very good. I might try no mayo and a touch more horseradish next time. This was good, but I was looking for a bit more bite.

This was a great recipe.  I did double the horseradish root needed. I also used Dijon mustard instead of dry mustard. The consistency was good. It seemed to gain potency after being in the refrigerator for a while.

I really enjoyed this! I used full fat ingredients and left out the red pepper flakes. It was really good! Next time I will use a bit more horseradish to give it more zip! I used it to compliment beef pot roast. It makes a lot of sauce so I have plenty leftover.

Great recipe - but I did leave out the cider vinegar and added an extra tablespoon of horseradish.  Used reg mayo and reg sour cream because that's what I had.  Love it!!

This is our go to dipping sauce for steak and prime rib. We just add a little bit more horseradish...also no need for vinegar as it's already in the horse radish. Love this sauce!

I made this recipe as written. It went well on a ham sandwich. I tried to save it to use for lunch again the next day, and it didn't hold up; so be sure to use it all or make a smaller version if using for something small.

i really enjoyed this sauce despite having to substitute mayo (full fat) for the sour cream due to being lactose intolerant.. would like to try this with yogurt.. i added a little more vinegar (but that's a personal preference).. and sprinkled a bit of salt at the end.. i'm sure if bf were here he'd say to add more horseradish.. but like others i think the point was to have it be a nice subtle flavor.. not overpowering.. this would be great made into tuna salad or egg salad.. i'm looking forward to making this again and letting bf try it.. ty for the recipe

We did a monster Prime Rib dinner for 22.  We used the horseradish and red pepper from our garden and used regular mayo and regular sour cream.  Everyone that used the horseradish was complimentary.   Excellent recipe!

I've been looking for a horseradish sauce that we like, for a very long time. I've tried several different recipes that were just too one dimensional. I made the recipe using more prepared horsedradish, and full fat mayonnaise and sour cream. I think that the cider vinegar, and dry  mustard made the difference, but the cayenne pepper was definitely not unwelcomed. This is now my go to recipe. I made this to go with a Prime Rib Roast/Standing Rib Roast - really good!

I have made this twice now and I really like it.  I used all ingredients except for the red pepper.  It was too vague for me (cayenne pepper, paprika, red pepper, chili pepper, what?) AND because after I mixed up the other ingredients I decided it didn't need it.  I made it in the exact proportions the recipe called for and let it sit overnight, and I decided it needed about another teaspoon of horseradish for my taste.  It was a little thin but tasty.  I will make again but I will try some kind of thickener to make it a stiffer sauce.

I really loved this.. I have never eaten or made horseradish sauce before but wanted to try something new with my roast that I made.  This was perfect.  My hubby really liked it but said it neeeded more horseradish.  I did not add the vinegar due to some of the other reviews.  I will for sure make this again next time I make a roast.

This was definitely a restaurant quality sauce.  I did add an additional TBSP of horseradish and omitted the vinegar because there is enough in the ground horseradish.  Excellent reviews from our dinner guests!

Hubby and I both liked this.  I needed something different to do with my horseradish as an accompaniment to corned beef brisket with cabbage, carrots and potatoes.  I haven't enjoyed corned beef so much outside of a reuben sandwich. (will probably use it in the reubens tomorrow)   I had to sub a couple of things.  Running short of sour cream I used cream cheese.  The only mustard I had was in seed form, so threw some seeds in a plastic bag and beat them into submission with a hammer.  Worked well and was nice and fresh.  Thanks for the excellent recipe, Carol.  It's very forgiving because an extra tablespoon of horseradish jumped in the bowl and was still Yumsville!

I usually make things exactly as stated - at least the first time.  I doubled the recipe because I had a lot of company cooking but realized I didn't have enough horseradish to double.  So I made it with as much horseradish as I had (2 Tblsp plus 1/4) and only 1 Tblsp of cider vinegar.  It came out great!  I would have liked more horseradish but it still had a good kick.  I added a sprinkle of sea salt to it as well.  Soo yummy.  I can't wait to try again with the right amount of horseradish!

Good but needed more horseradish - personal preference.  I also added 1 tsp. dijon mustard to kick it up a bit. MAKE THE DAY BEFORE!  Huge difference in flavors after it sits.

Delicious!!! Taste of horseradish not overpowering unless you want to add more. I made this with regular mayo and sour cream and we LOVED it..used it as  a sauce  for Cube Steaks with Gravy, We loved it and I will use it on a number of other recipes!!

Wonderful!  I didn't feel the need for mayonnaise so just left that out.  I did add more horseradish than indicated in the recipe.  Everyone raved about this sauce.  Thanks to Carol for this keeper

This was a perfect sauce served with the Foolproof Rib Roast by SALSIEPIE from this site!  The only change I made was to use light sour cream instead of non fat because that's what I had on hand.  My sides were Twice-Baked Mashed Potatoes by Margaret Mayhugh and creamed spinach.  It was a perfect New Year's Eve dinner.  Thanks to all of you that contribute to Allrecipes!

this was really good.  I used a horseradish cream which I didn't care for much - it was a little sweet, but that's not the recipe - that was me.  The sauce itself was really great.

Used fresh horseradish, which I tripled in amount, with less mayo and sour cream. It was still mild, but a really nice addition to our Christmas prime rib.

I really liked this.  I served it with Restaurant Style Prime Rib from this website.  I added some fresh parsley, and it went over very well.  I couldn't really taste the vinegar as others have mentioned, and I used prepared horseradish that had vinegar.  I will definitely use this recipe again!

Perfect! I eat at a Brazilian Eatery named Porcao' and they have it there. Perfect with all the Churrasco and Sausages and Steaks. Only thing I had to add a bit more Horseradish, other than that thanx!

I made this last night to go with the steaks I made for dinner.  I made a few changes only because I didn't have all the ingredients on hand.  I used lemon juice instead of vinegar and dijon mustard insead of mustard powder.  Since I was using it as a sauce I added maybe a teaspoon or two of milk to thin it down a little bit.  If I was using it on a sandwich, I'd skip that next time.  I still give it five stars because mine was great so the original must be great too!

This is the best horseradish sauce I have ever tried. This is my go-to recipe for leftover roast beef for sandwiches. YUM!

Good- I think the horseradish could be doubled though.  I used dijon mustard instead of dried.

Really good sauce.  The only thing I did different was using light sour cream instead of nonfat.  This tasted better after it had sat for a few hours to blend.  Next time I make it, I'll probably serve it after it's been sitting out for 20 minutes or so.  It was just a little too cold on the prime rib.

this was ok, but not my fav.  It had a very strange taste, I think too much mayo, worked fine but won't repeat.

This was a hit with our Christmas Prime Rib Roast.  I took suggestion of other reviews & doubled the horseradish.  I will definitely make this again!  Thanks for a great recipe.

This is very good.  Made as written, however I think with the leftovers I am going to add a smidge of ketchup.  I will use this again.

Very smooth and creamy. But we added a lot more horseradish for a bit of a kick.

This sauce is easy and delicious.  I've used it for several years with beef rib roast for Christmas dinner.  leftovers, if there are any, are great with any kind of sandwich.

This was pretty good.  I made this to go with a prime rib roast that I made. The only change that I made was omitting the red pepper.  I will make this again.

It was extremely easy to make, even ahead of time.  I didn't use real sour cream, I used the Tofuti stuff.  It was really nice.

A very solid sauce for prime rib. The only thing that could have made this better would be to use real root! Thanks.

Awesome.  I actually could have gone for a little more horseradish, but this was a hit.  I made it on Christmas Eve for Christmas dinner, and it was all I could do not to eat it all with a spoon!!

Went great with prime rib today - I will definitely be making this again and again.

I have tried making horseradish sauce several times and none has compared to what I get in a good restaurant.  This was not bad but the red pepper added to the horseradish makes for a very hot sauce.

This horseradish sauce was very good. I served it with a rotisseried beef tenderloin at a backyard BBQ. It was a huge hit!
