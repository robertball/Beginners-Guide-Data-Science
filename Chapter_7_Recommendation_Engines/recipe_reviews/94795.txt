Pretty good.  I used a jar of Ragu instead of tomatoes because I didn't have any available.  I'd make it again.  :)

Excellent taste. I suggest you allow the tomato and tequila sauce simmer for more than 5 minutes.  The tequila was quite intense at 5 mins, make it 10 minutes.

This recipe is fantastic!!  I served it with rotini pasta because that is my grandson's favorite.  He is 4 and always asks me to make the "curly noodle" spaghetti with the "sugar" (parmesan cheese) on top.  I made it for family, and they all wanted seconds, even thirds.  The seasonng is flavorful and satisfying.  This recipe will always be a hit with us.

This was different, not sure the tequila really worked with the flavors.

My daughter and I tried this recipe.  We did not use any salt due to not cooking with salt for health reasons.  I am not sure if that would have made a difference, but the flavors didn't seem to mix well with one another and I would not make this again.
