I had this recipe at a friend's house.  She served it with crackers as an appetizer.  I love eggplant so I enjoyed this recipe.  I then got the recipe from this site and made it as a side dish with salmon.

This was delicious!  I modified it slightly - I had already cut up an eggplant for another recipe so I boiled the unused eggplant for about 4 minutes to soften it. Used splenda instead of sugar, and left out the parsley - didn't have any fresh. All the other herbs were fresh from my garden. My husband put it on top of a bowl of romaine lettuce and raved about it. I loved the flavor of the spices and oils together. I will make this again and will try the eggplant baked, or grilled as well.

I'm not a big eggplant lover but I did like this recipe and it was very easy. I like the balsamic flavor and the touch of sweetness. Great on crackers or pita bread.

Love this recipe!  Not eggplant fans but my family will eat this everyday!!  I didn't use dried parsley or basil instead i used fresh ones!  Also added a bit of lemon juice to the mix - absolutely delicious!!

My husband said "MMMmmm gourmet".  You can play with the spices/herbs.  I used 6 cloves of garlic (yikes) and more fresh basil.  Thank you for this recipe.

I agree with the other person who said it came out too sweet. Maybe it was both the vinegar and sugar. I'm not sure what it was, something just tasted a little off-target. Grilling instead of baking the eggplant might bring out the flavor better.

I made this last year and loved it. I added more balsamic vinegar for my taste. It is a bit sweet, but lovely. I just made it again and decided not to peel the eggplant, because I don't peel it in some other recipes and it's fine. Not for this one- I would recommend following the recipe and peeling it! It just doesn't turn out the same.

I didn't like this as is. The sugar was too much and it was rather bland. Next time I will only put maybe a third of the sugar and add some more spices.

I loved this recipe....scaled for one person...I thought this was delicious...I had grilled eggplant that I had left over from the weekend, sliced in nice slices with the skin on that I tossed with olive oil, sea salt, pepper,garlic powder, and balsamic vinegar before grilling...so with the leftover pieces..about 1/2 the eggplant, I diced them and added all the herbs as well as some fresh basil! I did not add more olive oil as I used olive oil before cooking, so I just added the vinegar and the rest of the ingredients.....really delicious and light. Will make again. Thanks!

This came out sweeter than I expected, which I didn't like.  I don't think I'll make this again.

This was terrific. I added fresh parsley, more garlic, and Maldonado smoked flake sea salt. I also sliced it in rounds for a different look. The texture is pleasing. There is slight sweetness from the balsamic and sugar and pungency from the garlic. Feels very "umami". It did not need to marinate long with the thin slices, and I served it warm. Will make again for company.

It was awful. The color was the worst shade of greyish brown, the texture was slimy, there were a million seeds in it, the taste was way off, and I can't imagine eating it myself no less serving it to anyone else.

I roasted the eggplant because I love the texture it gives.   I heated this up and topped with a little marinara.. liked it fine. I don't think I care for cold eggplant, but I do think this recipe needed a little zip

I skipped the sugar. It is a very good dish. I didn't have time to roast it, so I just diced, put some salt and let it sit for 15 minutes.  Rinsed it and voil√°.... microwaved for 3 minutes and use the rest of the seasonings/olive oil. Great dish. I served as a salad, with slices of tomatoes and onions.

I couldn't see wasting the energy to roast the eggplant whole.  I peeled and diced it and roasted for 30 min.  While I'm sure it would be delicious as is as a salad, I mashed the roasted cubes and added in enough of the dressing to make a spread.  Also would be very sweet--in error we used 2 tbsp vinegar and even that is a bit on the sweet side.
