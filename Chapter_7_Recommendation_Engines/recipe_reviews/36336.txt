I did not have to change a thing in this recipe and it turned out perfect. It had so much flavor. I will definitely make this again.

I used this marinade for shrimp skewers and finished them with the sauce from "Chicken the Old Bay Way" recipe from this site, these were out of this world delicious.  A definte keeper for a summer bar-b-que, so easy and yummy!

Flavor was okay.  I think if I make again I would marinade it much longer than a half hour.  Thanks

This was quite bland as written.  I will try one more time with some added cayenne, and hope that helps.

Having 'Spicy' in the recipe would lead you to believe it's...spicy.  While this was a good marinade (we let chicken marinate 2 days, BTW), it is not spicy.  Up the black pepper or add some cayenne if you like heat.

The Boy really liked this chicken; I thought it was okay. Next time, I think I may cut the chicken into strips and marinate it a little longer.

It was ok. Nothing spectacular. The oil creates flare ups and blackens the chicken if you are not careful.

I thought this recipe was delicious! I measured the oil and vinegar, then eyeballed the seasonings. Definitely added alot more Old Bay and marinaded for 1-2 hours. Add Old Bay before broiling on each side, terrific!
