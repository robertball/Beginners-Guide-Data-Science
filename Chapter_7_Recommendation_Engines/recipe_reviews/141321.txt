This is a good fajita marinade for about 1/2 pound of meat. I did add a couple tablespoons of olive oil to tenderize the meat along with a teaspoon of liquid smoke (personal preference).  I let this marinate for 8 hours and grilled it over charcoal.  I cut up some onion and pepper and sauteed that while the meat was grilling.  This was so good with warm flour tortillas and all the fixin's: fresh salsa, guacamole, pico de gallo, shredded cheese, and a dollup of sour cream.

i was in a pinch and had to hurry up because it was so late!  i didn't have cumin or cilantro (don't like it much anyway) but had everything else.  i bought a sirloin steak - about 3/4" thick, trimmed it well and sliced it thin.  sliced up 1/2 a onion and dumped it along with the sliced beef into a plastic storage bag, massaged it well and just let it sit on the counter for about 10 miinutes while i prepared tomatoes, lettuce and tortillas (put on paper plate, covered with very lightly damp paper towel and nuked for 25 seconds.)  then i flash fried the beef and onions in very lightly greased non-stick well heated pan and it was done!  very good taste!  everything from start to finish took maybe 20 minutes!  now that's the kind of dinners i like!  i didn't have salsa but i put some sliced jalapenos from the jar and a dollop of sour cream in mine.  the kids just had lettuce, tomato and bagged mexican blend shredded cheese.  thank you very much for sharing this recipe!  mucho appreciado!

This was good but needed some tweaking.  It didn't make nearly enough for 1 1/2 pounds of meat so I added a couple tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil and about a teaspoon of worcestershire and also threw in a little extra tequila and lime juice.

Boy is this good!  I thinly sliced strip steak and let it sit in the fridge for several hours in the marinade.  Then I sauteed onions and mushrooms with the meat.  Served it with tortillas, fresh cilantro, homemade salsa, mexican cheese and sour cream. My husband and my two year old loved it. I wouldn't change a thing.

Used this on about 20 pounds of flank steak this weekend. Wow! I wasn't very exact with the measurements, but after marinating most of the day, it was the best flank steak I've ever made. Also, I was running low on tequila, so a little white rum got mixed in, too. Topped the steak with some fresh pineapple salsa, and it was a delight.

There was WAAAY too much of the lime flavor. I marinaded the steak for about 6 hours! It was slightly spicey but the only real flavor was the lime. It smelled wonderful but I will not be making this again.

That is what supposed to be what fajitas taste like!  This is an excellent authentic southwestern marinade!  Really good flavor, thanks for posting the recipe, now I can make fajitas that TASTE like fajitas. There may need to be an adjustment to the salt, but please, do NOT use soy salt, use SALT!

I marinaded 24 hours; a very short marinade might have been okay. With the tequila and lime combo it had a weird sour flavor.

This was wonderful!!  I didn't have tequila, so I skipped that and I also didn't have the cilantro, so i just used 1 tbls. puerto rican sofrito which I had on hand.  I used chicken instead of steak and the fajitas were great!!  I'll make this marinade for fajitas over and over again.  Thanks for sharing.

Exactly what I needed. I tripled the recipe to work for two and a half pounds of beef and flipped the tequila/lime juice amounts. I also added onion powder and a little worchestershire sauce. Thanks for sharing this.

Loved the recipe. Added just a few more ingredients and changed to light rum from tequila. Added 2 chopped jalepenos, 1/2 tsp mesquite smoke, 1 tbl. worcestershire sauce and a tsp. of honey wine vinegar, which balanced out the lime. Fabulous. Great base recipe to put your own touches to. If you don't have the vinegar just use 1 tsp of honey.

made this tonite for an unplanned dinner and used a new york cut as the market didn't have flank or skirt steak. I pierced the meat with a fork as I didn't have time to marinade over nite.  I used all the ingredients and added about a tablespoon of soy sauce and some olive oil.  After grilling and tasting, I had to sprinkle salt over the meat to balance out the strong lime flavor.  adding salt made the marinade more to our taste, and with this addition would use this recipe again.

Excellent recipe ~ I was looking for something to change about it, but after marinating it all night and cooking it on the grill the next day, I wouldn't change a thing!!  A definite keeper in my recipe box!

The flavors blended well for very tasty fajitas.  I did not change anything in the recipe, and left the meat in the marinade for 24 hours.

I did equal parts oil, lime juice and tequila.  Also added a splash of soy sauce.  Made for tender beef, the longer you can let it marinate the better.

Very flavorful and tender.  I marinaded it overnight.  I did add some olive oil... In general this could have used some salt, something that was overlooked in the recipe.  I will try this again, then again I'll add some sea salt.

This marinade is easy to throw together but, as written, it just doesn't have the spicy kick that we like so much.  The meat was tender and smelled fantastic but I just could not get past the overwhelming lime flavor.

This was a great recipe...I put only slightly less lime juice in it and marinaded overnight.  The beef came out delicious and different then typical beef fajitas.

I didn't really like it, it made the meat taste just wrong in my opinion. My family didn't really like it either.
