I have made this about 30 times since finding this recipe...I SOOOO should have posted this rating sooner. This was FANTASTIC...I noticed the last two people rated this with ONE star and they must be crazy or not experienced with baking. I bake almost every day...for the past 10 years and this is BY FAR the best pound cake recipe I have found yet. It is moist, tasty fluffy and flavourful....I think I baked it in less time, but I prefer things baked with a lower temp and less time...just a personal preference. I took it out as soon as the center seemed remotely cooked and left it on the counter for about an hour before attempting cutting it. It was soooo good. My hubby and kids ate a whole one that night and my hubby took another to work the next day and got rave reviews from it. This is the only pound cake I have made since finding this recipe and it will of course be the last...we have found a winner!!! SOOO tasty and moist. I have made this recipe as is about 25 times and a few times I made it with berries or apples or just with cinnamon. Its sooo good the way the recipe intended, but also good once in awhile with berries. Thanks soooooo so much for posting this recipe. Its definately a keeper.

An excellent recipe and a true pound cake, where you use an actual pound of each ingrediant. I reject any recipe that does not have a pound of butter in it. Those cakes are good, but not true poundcakes. I've become a poundcake snob. LOL!

I add some lemon zest, or a full two teaspoons of vanilla extract sometimes. I've also been known to trade the sweet milk, for buttermilk. 

I've made this and the other Grandmother's poundcake from this site over and over and will not use any other recipes for my pound cake.

I think the individuals that posted bad reviews have no concept of what pound cake is. If you're used to Sara Lee or Entenman's, don't bother. Real pound cake got it's name because you are supposed to use a pound of each ingredient. The result should be a very dense cake. Of course, you have to be careful not to overbake or you'll end up with something too dry!

I took the following suggestions from the invaluable reviews: 1. Add a tablespoon of vanilla. 2. Replace 1 cup of white sugar with 1 cup of brown sugar. 3. Beat the butter and sugar for 5 minutes, and then for another minute as each egg is added. I also beat for a minute after adding the vanilla (which I do after the eggs). Result: A gorgeous, dense, flavorful, buttery cake with a crisp brown crust. For those who like Sara Lee pound cake (and I do) this creates a very similar flavor. Fantastic cake.

Yes, this is the formula for a classic American pound cake as it has been made for well over a century and a half (1:1:1:1 or 1 pound butter, 1 pound sugar, 1 pound flour, 1 pound eggs.) I used this as a base for petits fours, and the texture stood up to repeated cuts (I halved the recipe, and baked in a 9"X13" pan, then cut 7X10 into (70) 1-1/4" squares) and didn't shed crumbs, neither when it was cut, nor when the fondant was poured over it. I did, however, add more milk. This was so short on liquid that the result was closer to a dough than a batter. I added 50% more milk, and added extracts (combo of almond, vanilla, orange, lemon , maple and coconut) as I needed the cake to have sufficiently assertive and complex flavor to stand up to the uber sweet fondant. The 9"X13" was done in 27 minutes. I cooled it in the pan for about 13 minutes, and it released beautifully onto the rack to finish. This cake is appropriately dense, sturdy and velvety moist (with additional liquid.) It's a 4-1/2 star recipe as is, but a 5 with additional milk and flavoring, which yields distinct sensory improvement.

made this real pound cake again today. I dont understand the one star ratings this recipe is getting. you absolutely MUST beat the softened butter and sugar for more then five minutes with a good mixer. more like ten minutes. beat that mix like it owes you money. add the eggs one at a time. add your flavorings before the flour. remembering to subtract that liquid amount from the milk amount. add the flour and mix JUST UNTIL its blended in. I made a lemon bundt pound cake today. i used 1 and 1/2 juice and rind of regular lemons. added vanilla also. I only needed small amount of milk. im goin to glaze this deliciousness with lemon glaze and serve it for thanksgiving dessert.

This was delicious and exactly what I was looking for: rich, classic pound cake. I've made this cake twice in the last week.  Once with a tsp of almond extract and once with a tsp of vanilla.  I scaled it down to 15 servings to make one good sized loaf.  Because I didn't have enough of the right ingredients on hand, I substituted half of the white sugar for brown sugar, and the unsalted butter for salted butter. Instead of using parchment paper I buttered and floured the loaf pan. Result was terrific with (or despite??) my modifications!  Thanks!

This turned out terribly. There was far too much butter and I know I followed the recipe to a tee. It was rubbery and tasted more like sweetened bread than any pound cake. If this was the intended outcome then it turned out just right, otherwise it's really just not a pound cake.

Fantastic! Hard to improve on such a classic, but I did add a tablespoon of vanilla extract - it turned out perfect! I made this with my four year old, and I know we'll be making this for many years to come. Thanks Patricia!

Excellent! This was delicious, and not hard to make at all! I used whipping cream instead of milk, and a little white chocolate flavored toroni syrup. I also cut this recipe down (instead of 30 servings, only 10) which was plenty! It made a loaf cake and six cupcakes, I used this for strawberry shortcake and it was delicous! I have to say I was surprised because this had a wonderful texture and flavor, I also sub. margarine for butter, since I didn't have any butter.

Perfect! I looked at over 30 pound cake recipes, but being a purist, chose this- so glad I did.
Lovely crumb, texture and flavor spot on. I halved the recipe (no room in freezer after huge meat sale) and baked it in a bundt pan- it came out perfectly.
Do cream the living daylights out of the butter and sugar, and beat for 2 minutes after adding each room temperature egg.
Next time I'll experiment with different additions (vanilla, lemon, etc.) but my family LOVED it. Served it with strawberries and whipped heavy cream- Yumm-o. Not only are the possible additions endless, ways to serve, also. Chocolate, fruit, frostings...thanks for the quintessential pound cake recipe!

I never write a comment even though I read them. This is THE best pound cake.  I followed the directions but added 1 teaspoon of vanilla.  I plan to use cake flour next time (I have made this pound cake 4 times since Nov. 2010 !)  It really works, the batter is thick, beat butter and sugar for 10 min and beat 2 minutes after each egg....got this from reading the reviews. :) I am telling you -- make this and stop searching for the perfect pound cake recipe!

I'm sorry but maybe I too did something wrong with the recipe because it really turned out not so good. I love to bake so it was amazing that I had trouble with this cake. Maybe I'll try it again one day.

Excellent! I think the key to getting a cake with great texture is to make sure that ALL of your ingredients are at room temp before you start. Pre-measure your milk, take your eggs and butter out (it helps to cut your butter up into small cubes before you use your mixer), but yes, take everything out at least 30 mins before you start. Also, be sure to beat at a medium-high speed, rather than a low speed. The batter should be super smooth (no lumps) when you're all done. And it's a bit thicker than regular cake batter too- sorta like frosting at room temp, or maybe just a hair softer. I thought that I had over mixed mine, it was incredibly light and fluffy, but it came out PERFECT and I mixed for a long time in between eggs and milk/flour. I don't think I'll have to worry about over mixing next time. The only modification I made to the recipe was that I added 2tsp of PURE vanilla extract and 2 tsp of almond extract. I could have gotten away with just one of each, or even none at all, it's a tad sweet, but still yummy as ever. 
Great recipe! It took awhile to find a classic pound cake recipe- I am very pleased:)

This recipe was exactly what I was looking for! It's just like the pound cake my mom made when I was small--not too sweet, very dense and moist, and a nice, sugary crust on top.  Two things: I was alarmed when I was finished mixing the batter and the instructions read to pour it into the pan, because my batter was so thick I had to spoon it in and level it with a rubber spatula. So, don't worry if your batter seems thick. Also, since I halved the recipe and used a 9.25 x 5.25 loaf pan, I only had enough batter to fill the pan a little over halfway. The cake didn't rise much, which is not a bad thing at all, but the final shape of my cake was kind of funny, flat loaf. (My fault entirely!) Next time I'll use smaller pans, and whatever the size, make sure I fill them 3/4 full.  Great recipe, thanks for sharing!

Classic!  I used just two 8x4 loaf pans and they baked wonderfully, there was no mess.  3 loaf pans would have made the cakes too small.  My boyfriend said this recipe reminds him of the Pound Cakes his mother used to bake when he was a child.  Without a doubt a 5 star recipe.  Thanks WHOLEGRAINWOMAN.  This is my new "go-to" recipe for pound cake.  I can't wait to share this outside of the home.

I would give this cake 10 stars!  Wow!  I have never made pound cake before, but wanted to try it.  I won't ever search for another recipe.  The only change I made was adding 2 teaspoons of vanilla.  It was the best pound cake I have ever had (don't tell my mom!).  Since it makes 3 loaves, next time I will try to add some small chocolate chips to one, as I think that would be good too.  Thank you so much for sharing such a wonderful recipe!  This is definitely one of my new favorites on this site.

Apparently some folks don't know what a pound cake is, and this is it.  It's exactly what my grandmother's was like and it's fabulous.  Watch the cook time right at the end.  The edges may burn quickly at the end.  I'm so glad to find a real pound cake recipe.

This is a great pound cake recipe!!! You have to remember, since there is no leavening in a traditional pound cake, YOU (the baker) have to provide the leavening by creaming the ingredients appropriately and beating each egg in one by one. Doing this incorporates air into the batter, which is what helps the eggs to their job in leavening. Cream the butter and sugar for a minimum of 5 minutes, if not longer. It should increase in volume and turn white and fluffy, looking a lot like whipped heavy cream. Beat each egg in for about a minute before adding another egg (yes, watch the clock...a minute can be longer than you think!). I added a dash of salt because I didn't use salted butter (there is a dairy allergy in the house so I used shortening instead of butter), added a Tbsp of vanilla extract, and I used rice milk in place of dairy milk (again, the dairy allergy thing). Perfect!!! Good, old fashioned pound cake.

I couldn't give this recpe a full 5 stars because I didn't follow the measurements, but rather the author's note about using a pound of evrything. I go my kitchen scale out & weighed 1 pound of eggs (which ended up being 8 or 9 eggs), a pound of buter, flour & sugar. But nonetheless, my cakes turned out AMAZING... so glad I got rid of most of it or I woula eaten it all myself!

Absolutely the best pound cake I've ever had.  This recipe is a true pound cake recipe.  I think the recipe is perfect as is.  It is moist on the inside and the outside is slightly crispy.  It is amazing.  It is delicious and addicting plain and outstanding with fresh strawberry sauce and whipped cream.

AWESOME.  An elderly lady once told me that CREAMING means that when you rub it between your fingers there are no sugar crystals.  It takes 15-20 minutes if you have a great mixer.  Be patient.  This did not need anything at all but was incredible as strawberry shortcake.  I followed another reviewer's recommendation and baked in a bundt pan @350 for 50 minutes.  I had enough for a small loaf pan as well.  It does not rise much but I didn't want it to overflow.  It makes ALOT of cake...  My grandma owned a bakery where she used pound cake cut in 1x2x3(or height of cake), roled in a runny frosting, and then rolled in crushed salted peanuts.  She called it a salted nut roll and I am looking forward to that as soon as I get some peanuts.  YUM.

HOLY MOLY.  This is my first time making pound cake.  I'm not exaggerating, I think this may be the most delicious cake that I have ever eaten in my life.  I made just one loaf and added 1/2tsp vanilla.  WOW.  Amazing.  Only weird thing was I took it out after 50min and it was even a bit overdone!

Exactly what I was looking for... I added one teaspoon orange flavouring and used it as a base for orange/ berry trifle.  Yum!

This IS an authentic pound cake! Soo yummy! If you like fakey cakey pound cakes (like the junk you get at a store) this is not for you, but as someone who craves authenticity, I loved this sweet, buttery, dense treat.. I halved the recipe since I bake for myself and this thing was gone in a day! This was my first stab at a pound cake and it turned out divine. Will make this again when I get rid of the wight from the first one haha!

This was really good!  I made it exactly as the recipe stated.  I mixed the butter and sugar for 10 min. until it turned creamy and white just like others recommended.  I made strawberry shortcake with it by topping it with sliced strawberries mixed with sugar and homemade whipped cream.  I got compliments from all my dinner guests on the crispy outside of the pound cake.  They especially loved that part.

Having never made pound cake before I pretty much impressed myself! I did cut the recipe in half but next time I'll plan to go ahead and make the 3 loaves! Only change I made was to grease and flour my loaf pan and did not use parchment paper. The loaf fell out easily once I ran a knife around it and let it sit for a little bit. Surprised at how moist it was. Will HAVE to do this again!

I made this pound cake in a bundt pan, used swans down flour cake, sifted twice. Great moist cake.  I have baked it twice and I have rave reviews each time.  Such an easy cake to make.  I turn my nose up at store bought pound cakes now!

This is a pretty good recipe.  I never made pound cake before, so I cut the recipe in half (15 servings) and made it in a 9x5 inch pan.  It's very dense.  I added a little vanilla to the mix.  Overall, it was very tasty when it was warmed up.

Wow, this was great! I baked at 325 since I used dark pans and they were done in 45-50 minutes. Nice light texture but dense at the same time-different than any store bought cake I have ever tried. this is going to be my standard cake recipe for the trifles I like to make. I did add 2 tsp of my homemade vanilla since I love the flavor it gives. I was very careful about the mixing after I added the flour since so many seemed to have problems. The batter was very light and pretty much stayed where it poured so needed to be flattened a bit. Thanks so much for the recipe!

Wonderful! One note for those who have had problems or those who haven't had a lot of experience baking where eggs are the only leavening: it is really important that all ingredients, but especially the eggs, are at room temperature.

Awesome! I cut the recipe in half and added a half tsp of vanilla extract.  I used 3 - 5x3 loaf pans and baked for 35-40 min and it turned out fantastic!

I thought it was great -- I used vanilla & almond extract -- The 1 start people may have over mixed it once the dry stuff is added.  Rubber consistancy when baking is usually over mixing!!  Pound cake is made with 1 lb of butter/sugar/flour -- that's how its name

This cake is YUMMY! I did add 2 tsp of vanilla extract as others have suggested. Each oven is different because my cake cooked in 45 minutes on 350. This is my second time making a pound cake from this site and this one is by far my favorite. I only modified the number of eggs because I used 5 instead of 6. I dont like eggy cakes. That is the only change I made.This cake is not overly sweet and I am thinking about putting a glaze on it but it is not necessary. So glad to have this recipe. Next time, I will make this recipe for cupcakes or even a sheet cake. This is my new go-to cake recipes. Very delish!

I do not know why someone would give this 1 star, especially because it was too much butter.  Do they know what a pound cake is?  This was amazing.  I have to say that I only had 3 eggs in the house so I halfed the recipe and put it all in a 9 x 5.5 bread pan, turned th temp. to 325 and added an extra 5 mins.  Great!!!

I have made this recipe three times and it was very good each time. I have added 1 tsp vanilla to one batch, zest of three lemons to another, and zest of 3 meyer lemons to the third.  I have to say the meyer lemons were my absolute favorite, I highly recommend it. Thanks for sharing this delicious and versatile recipe!

So good and so "real."  I felt like I was eating the same pound cake that pioneer women made.  Well uh, not the same exact cake, but you know what I mean.   Don't add anything.  Enjoy it just the way it is.

I love this recipe, but I change it a little bit from the original! I use 3 cups of cake flour instead of regular flour, cut the milk and use heavy whipping cream instead w/ just a 2 teaspoon of vanilla or lemon! You can play w/ the recipe and it will come out real good. Love it make it all the time now thank u!

In place of the butter, I used 50% butter and 50% cooking oil to make this cake more moist. Great recipe.  This was my second time making this cake and it turned out great both times.

Very yummy pound cake!  I did not have the loaf pans on hand so I used a bundt pan and it turned out great.  I halfed the recipe and wish I would have made it for 20 servings instead....It would have made for more cake :)  I baked for 40 min at 350 and came out perfect.  I also added 1/2 tsp of vanilla.  Thanks for a great recipe, will make again!

awesome! easy to half, and oh the wonders of what I could do with it! I added vanilla, next time ill add a bit more with a hint of almond flavor! try it with this frosting: 2 sticks butter-whip well
                          4 cups sifted powered sugar
                          3/4 cup cocoa powder
                          4tbsp milk
the kep is to get your handmixer and whip and whip and whip, adding just enough milk to get it perfect for you taste, though you will need at least 2 of the tablespoons of milk.  can  adjust the cocoa too.

Simply delicious.  This is almost identical to a recipe that I misplaced that had been handed down for decades.  This is the real deal...I made a couple of modifications;  I used cake flour as one reviewer mentioned, decresed the sugar by 1/2 cup, added one more egg, and sprinkled "Sugar in the Raw" on top...the sugar gave it a crunchy sweet flavor...made it twice in a greased and floured tube pan both times with no sticking-Thank-you Whole Grain Woman!

I followed this recipe to the letter, and got a super crunchy top.  The interior cake consistency is rather fluffy - not very much like a pound cake at all.  Not sure I'd rely on this particular recipe in the future.  The flavor is nice... but this isn't much of a pound cake, I'm sorry to say.

Holy moly this is a good cake. I made it today for my husband's birthday. He wanted a "real" pound cake and I must say that this recipe delivered. So delicious. I added 2 teaspoons of vanilla and next time I'll add lemon flavoring and zest.....soooo good. Taste like what mama used to make.

The perfect recipe - thank you for sharing! I even halved the proportions and made cup cakes with the batter (I got 24) and they turned out fabulous! I grated in the zest of a lemon for the aroma. I had to bake for 30 min...maybe 25 next time so the outside doesn't crust as much.

This was SOOOOOO easy to make!  I cut the recipe in half (just me and my 3 yr old son)...I pulled the ingredients out as soon as I walked in the door after work.  About half an hour later, I mixed the ingredients together and baked 2 small loaves.  It turned out perfect!  Moist and compact...just like it should be!  I did make an adjustment...I wanted mine for strawberries, so I made a vanilla key-lime pound cake...this is going in my recipe box at home!

I made this pound cake last year for the office staff at my school.   They asked if I would please make it again this year!  Everyone loved it and even remembered it a year later.

The quintessential pound cake.  Couldn't be easier and has turned out perfect every time I've made it.  Very moist and dense with a pleasingly sweet and slightly crunchy "crust."  Pound cake is my husband's favorite.  His grandmother always made it for him on his birthday.  He confided recently that this is even better than his grandmother's.

My daughter was hounding me to make pound cake and adored this cake.  Made 3 full-size bread pans, which was perfect to freeze so she can have later.  Followed recipe exactly, only added a little vanilla.  Key is to whip butter and sugar for at least 5 minutes at high speed.  Looked beautiful and golden brown, very moist.

My DH has been driving me crazy asking for pound cake, so I tried this one and we're both happy I did.  It is wonderfully dense without being heavy (if that makes sense) and a rich, buttery flavour. At DH's request, I added almond extract, and found that it needed 2 tsp.  Instead of three cakes, I used slightly larger pans and made two, so I increased the baking time by about 5 minutes or so.  One cake disappeared in a day and a half, so I hid the other one in the freezer where I hope he won't find it for a while. :)  Thanks for the recipe!

This pound cake is wonderful!  The only change I made was by adding 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract.  The only problem was that I ate 1/2 a loaf in one day!!!
Love it!

Great old fashioned pound cake recipe. I scaled it to make 20 servings.  If you are looking for a light, high fluffy pound cake, this isn't it. It's a very dense low delicious cake.  I didn't know if I was supposed to line the entire pan with parchment paper so I just lined the bottom. I used a nonstick pan so I don't think I even had to do that. The cake came out very easy and the crust is awesome. My husband, son and grandson loved it. I added 2 teaspoons of vanilla. I will make this again.

Love it! This is way better than any store bought pound cake! I added pure vanilla extract & a small spoonful of sour cream to mine, it turned out great! Now I can see why maybe a few people gave this recipe bad reviews, if you eat this right out of the hot oven, it doesn't taste so great hot. It needs time to settle & cool. I highly recommend waiting until it has completely cooled before you try it, you shouldn't be disappointed! I think it tastes even better the next day! Great recipe, so simple, so easy to make. I love it!

I gave this cake only three stars because although it was good it wasn't exactly the best pound cake i've had as other reviewers said my cake came out too fluffy for a pound cake in my opinion.  I did cut the recipe in half and that might have made the difference but I'll think I'll need to find a new recipe

This is perfect as written.  If yours did not come out be patient when mixing it.  Cream butter and sugar well and add the eggs one at a time creaming mix each time.  Take your time with it and you will love it

EXCELLENT. This is a fantastic recipe. I baked at 325 and it is the best pound cake I've ever had. I accidentally didn't measure my butter correctly and put 1/3 of what is called for and it turned out great :). Just can't go wrong here. Oh, I did put a dash of salt and vanilla.

This is a really good recipe. The only thing that needed to change for me was that it didn't take as long to bake as the recipe calls for. I even had the temperature down a little because I did not want to burn it and all ovens are different. My cake baked for about an hour.

YUMMMMMY!***** I looked at this last night and made it today The only thing I did different was adding in 1 TBSP pure vanilla etract. I would recommend reducing temperature if you are using one pan i.e bundt pan. I will definitely make this again and again. Thanks for sharing!

Added heavy cream instead of milk, and one tsp vanilla.  Best pound cake ever.  Got my husband hooked on pound cake.  Very dense with a crispy crust.  Excellent,  and wholesome  ingredients.

This vintage recipe is the real deal! It's supposed to be dense, subtly sweet, and butter-rich, and this cake is all of those things. Delicious by itself with a cup of tea or top with strawberries.

I did not have much luck with this recipe and  I made sure to mix the butter and sugar a lot and in between each egg.  Mine turned out dense. I only cooked for 50 minutes and maybe could have cooked less.

I made this cake yesterday. It was a great hit with my family. My picky three year old said it was the best cake ever. I did add 1 tbsp of lemon extract and 1/2 tbsp. of vanilla extract. I also sifted my flour. which equaled up to 3 1/2 cups of flour. I will be making this again. Thanks for a wonderful recipe. I did have to bake the cake 20 mins. longer for a 10 inch bundt cake pan.

I increased the batter amount to 1 1/2 times the ingredients to make a 16 x 16 sheet cake.  WOW!  This turned out amazing.  FYI - I added 1 TBS of vanilla and 1 cup of heavy whipping cream instead of milk as suggested by another.  I will be making a 2 layer 16 x 16 graduation cake this weekend.  Will let you know how it turns and will post a picture.

First time making  this pound cake. Excellent. Will definitely recommend it. I read the reviews and did  some variation. I used one cup of heavy whipping cream in place of milk. I added one teaspoon each of pure vanilla, lemon and almond extract . Baked at 325 for 10 inch tube pound cake for 50 minutes and the loaf for about 25-30 minutes. It was enough batter for both. It was so easy to make. As they recommended room  temperature on your eggs and butter .

This is one of the rare recipes that needs no adjustments.   I have made it several times exactly as written, and it's perfect every time.  It even bakes in the amount of time called for.  I generally have bad luck with cakes from scratch; this one works like a charm.  It's good plain or in a trifle or shortcake.  My husband's favorite way to eat this is to butter and grill it, then serve it with Chef John's strawberry sauce.  Do use real butter.  When you have so so few ingredients, you have to use the real thing.  Normally I use shortening in cookies and pie crusts, but butter makes this cake stand out.  Happy baking!

VERY BUTTERY. I've had real pound cakes that are sweeter. But this recipe was good. Make a sweet whip to go with it. Just keep in mind, if you don't like butter, don't bake this.

As it's just hubby and I (and I only had 2 eggs), I cut this down to a "1/3 Pound Cake" (10 servings) in one loaf pan, and it turned out great! Followed the recipe exactly, but pulled out of the oven at 60 minutes, because the edges were getting pretty dark. I let it cool in the pan on the counter probably another 20 before cutting it. So fluffy but moist and beautifully dense, as I think pound cake should be. I would love to make this in bundt shape sometime, but this is definitely going to be the recipe I keep going back to!

I made this cake last night (had a sweet tooth) This has got to be the best butter/pound cake recipe I have ever found. I messed up by using too small of a pan (so be sure to use a bigger pan) which resulted in the cake falling in the center and my having to cook it longer to compensate for my error. I too cooked the cake at 325* and added an extra few minutes to the time to get the result I wanted. Even with all of my mistakes the cake was unbelievably wonderful. It is worth all and all in the end.

This cake is great. I have made it several times. The first time I followed the recipe, except using a bundt pan because this is what I had. It is excellent! Next time added a teaspoon of homemade vanilla extract - even more yummy. Last time, 1 teaspoon of lemon extract and 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract - so good. However, this cake is perfect with just the recipe as stated! Classic flavor that you can adjust as you like.

I made this out of curiosity as I really wondered how it would turn out without any baking powder. I followed directions exactly as laid out and got the most beautiful results. My Nigerian grandmother made cakes like this,with delectable flavor,rich texture and thoroughly moist. I added orange zest (as Mama would have done for its incomparable flavor profile) to subsequent cakes but it's really fantastic as is. I do mine in Bundt pans and bake for 25 minutes then tent with foil and bake for 10 minutes more. This is super easy and a great cake to whip up for company.

This was very good and easy to make.  I did add a little bit of vanilla extract to it which enhanced the flavor.  I only wanted to make one loaf so I scaled the recipe down to 10 servings without any problems.  I used this as a base for strawberry shortcake.  Several of my guests went back for seconds.  I had a request to make this again for Father's Day to go along with some locally grown organic strawberries!  YUMMY!

A very traditional and true recipe for pound cake. Nothing wrong with the recipe I just didn't like it as much as I like other poundcakes. I thought it was a little too sweet and the bottom and sides had a thick browned crust that isn't as good as the top or middle. This type of cake is better the next day when the ingredients have time to mellow into one another.

Tasted a bit bland, and I'm not sure why.  I used regular salted butter, I also used a mix of brown and white sugar, and added a bit of vanilla (which the recipe didn't indicate, but I followed some reviewers advice).  The cake rose well, and had a good texture, but the flavour was a bit dull.  Maybe I should have put extra vanilla.  Will try again another time, and see if it comes out better

Great pound cake recipe..I altered it a little...I added 1 tsp. vanilla extract and 1 tsp. lemon extract and make it a little denser I omitted one of the egg whites. I baked this in a 10" angel food cake pan @ 325 for 1 hr. and 45 mins. Delicious!

I halved the recipe and made only 1 loaf.  It turned out perfectly for our strawberry shortcake dessert!  I may have over mixed it a little - next time I'll mix by hand as others suggested.  This was just the buttery, sugary treat we were looking for.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was wonderful! I've been looking for a pound cake recipe and was delighted to find this one. After readings the reviews, which I always find helpful, I also added a teaspoon of vanilla, but may try almond extract next time. Can't wait to try it with berries and whipped cream!

Unbelievably simple to prepare. I added a teaspoon or so of homemade vanilla extract. The batter was surprisingly light and fluffy and very tasty, too!

This recipe is fabulous, If you end up with a breadlike cake its because you blended the flour too much, you might want to try 1/2 AP Flour and 1/2 Cake flour to prevent it from developing too much gluten

This recipe is my first experience with pound cake and I'm hooked! I knew when it made my kitchen smell like sugar cookies it was going to be good! I used my kitchen scale to measure out a pound each of sugar and flour. Great results!

This is exactly what pound cake is supposed to be. The folks who said it wasn't "really" pound cake just don't know what pound cake is. Also maybe they didn't cream the butter and sugar enough or maybe they beat the flour too much after adding. All those things can mess up a good pound cake. But this is the easiest and best one to me. Of course I usually add cocoa to mine!

Very easy, and with very few ingredients! I agree with another review, let cool completely before eating. The longer it sits the more tastier.

This was the best and easiet recipe. I used one other on this site and it was good, but this one is great. cake came out wonderful. The only thing is I used a bundt cake pan instead of a loaf pan and it was to much batter for the bundt pan, but other than that it was wonderful.

This was an EXCELLENT recipe!  I scaled it to 2 loaves.  I used 1/2 margarine, 1/2 butter as I realized at the last minute I didn't have enough butter.  For flavoring, I added 1/2 tbsp vanilla and 1 tbsp almond extracts.  Ended up greasing and flouring a bundt pan--no need for parchment.  Mine was done in 60 minutes but could have been baked a few minutes less.  Used it for strawberry shortcake.  Next time I'll try lemon extract just because.  Thanks for an out of this world experience!

I've never eaten a pound cake before, but this one was tasty! I scaled it to 10 servings. I was worried about it not rising without baking soda/powder, but in the end it pulled through! I didn't have parchment paper so I just greased and floured my baking pan. The only change I made was adding 1/2 tsp of vanilla after creaming the sugar & butter.  I baked mine in a 8x4 for 1 hour. The end result - moist and dense on the inside, a little crispy on the outside.

I was looking for a recipe like the one my mom used to make to bring to a visit with a cousin who loved my mom's pound cake.  This was the closest to what I remembered of the recipe she used.  Everyone loved it!
PS: like other reviewers have mentioned, be sure to cream the living daylights out of the butter and sugar to get enough air into the batter for it to rise properly.  Using buttermilk instead of regular milk also helps.

This looked to be a true pound cake recipe, and I had high hopes.  I used half and half instead of milk, and  added a teaspoon of vanilla.  I also baked it at a lower temperature because the batter was so thick.  Unfortunately the cake was very dry - I must have left it in too long adjusting for the lowered temp.  I hate it when people alter recipes then cut the rating to two stars, so I am keeping it at five stars because of the simple ingredients and flavor, which was wonderful.  I will try again and follow the recipe exactly next time.

I only had one 9" loaf pan, so I cut this recipe in half.  Also dyed it pink because it was a last minute birthday cake for my 5 year old daughter.  Cake was very buttery and delicious.  Not too sweet, and reminded me of shortbread cookies. I loved how easy this was to put together, and I had all the ingrediants on hand. I think I cooked it a little too long though.  For my 9" loaf pan, I should've only cooked about 50-55 minutes.  So, check your cake after 50 minutes for doneness.

This cake is quick and easy to make.  Because it is your basic pound cake, you can flavor it any way you like.  The taste is rich and buttery.  Also a good cake to try if you're making one for the first time.

This is a fabulous recipe! I am taking two of the cakes to a bake sale and keeping one for us! I used orange extract for the flavoring as that is what I had on hand and it is wonderful! Thanks, Patricia, for sharing!

I loved the taste of this cake. I divided it in half and tried to make 2 pound cakes but I didn't quite have enough batter to make 2 cakes. None the less, it turned out great and will be made again.

Everyone loves when I make this recipe!  I had to make two, utilizing 2 bundt pans b/c there is an abundance of batter ;-). I also cut the baking time down to 45m.

I suspect the people who had trouble with this recipe don't really know what "light and fluffy" means when it comes to the butter and sugar part.  You really have to beat it for a long time. Very soft butter, 4-6 mins. Semi-soft butter, 5-8 mins. If you're a novice baker, this is an easy mistake to make. Most other things don't need you butter and sugar beaten this much. 
Also, when mixing the milk and flour alternately, make sure you start and finish with flour. If you finish with milk, the texture looks off and it might cause you to over-mix.

I gave it the benefit of the double based off negative reviews and unfortunately, I agree with the bland taste..
It tastes like dough and bland, I really think salt and vanilla like usual recipes are essential.

This is how pound cake is done. Think of the name-it’s not called lite and healthy cake is it?  For the users that got it wrong it’s simple chemistry. All ingredients must be room temperature before you start. One cold ingredient will coagulate the batter.

This is an amazing recipe that I will use again and again! My Farmer's Market had strawberries, and I wanted to make homemade pound cake to go with it. Just got my pound cake out a few minutes ago, and tried a small bite that was incredible. It was sweet without being too sweet, and I love this recipe very much. I'm not big on cake, so this is amazing for me. I did add a few splashes of good vanilla because I do that with most of my baking.

I followed the recipe exactly, changing nothing, except I did add vanilla flavoring, and adjusted the amount of milk to reflect that, so the liquid measurement wouldn't be changed. All of my ingredients were at room temperature. I used a Kitchen Aid stand mixer to do all the considerable beating required. Eggs went in one at a time, beating at least 90 seconds before adding the next. The batter was lovely, very fluffy and pale yellow, like I remember my grandmother making. (I was so excited over that! She made amazing pound cakes!)  I greased &  lined the loaf pans, put the batter in and set the loaves baking at 350. When they  were done they looked beautiful, just like my grandmother's. The outer crust looked perfect, that little split in the top crust was there. I put them on cooling racks. When they cooled I cut my husband a slice. There was this greasy line near the bottom of each cake, where it appears butter settled. The cake itself had a nice texture but a bit heavy and was very very eggy tasting. I couldn't taste the vanilla flavoring at all, and I added a tablespoon of that. Overall I'm so disappointed. I had hoped to give two of the cakes as thank you gifts in a basket of goodies, but I'm thinking now I'll make cookies instead. 
I don't know what went wrong, but all three loaves had that identical oily looking streak near the bottom. I know my oven temp is spot on, I baked for the time stated in the recipe. I can't figure out what caused it. I've never had this issu

This pound cake recipe was very good, moist and dense. I used buttermilk in place of regular milk and added 1 tbsp of vanilla extract and it turned out great. To finish the pound cake I boiled one can of condensed milk to make a caramel frosting to place on the cake. Excellent!

I made this cake for my father's birthday. He always mentions how much he loves the traditional pound cake with no glaze or frosting. And I'm so glad that I've tried this recipe!
The batter was more than enough for one bundt cake pan, so i made mini cupcakes of the remaining batter.
I've tried making pound cakes before, never liked any of them. This one is more than amazing!
But to my taste, I added 3 teaspoons of vanilla extract and substituted heavy whipping cream with milk. I found the batter to be so dense so I followed one of the reviews here and added 1 cup and 3 tablespoons of the whipping cream. 
The result is amazing  more than I've imagined.
Thank you for this recipe! Will definitely make again!

Perfect old fashioned pound cake!! Added a little vanilla and followed other reviewers who said to beat the butter and sugar for at least 5 minutes and with each egg addition for at least one minute. This made a big difference from the last time I made pound cake. I think the mixing can be a make or break. Also had to cover up with foil to stop the top from burning since it had to be in so long. Delicious! Even my husband who doesn't like a lot of sweets loved it.

Didn't have the right size loaf pans so used a 10 cup Bundt pan. Worked out nicely as I lowered the temp to 350 degrees as another reviewer suggested. Baked in a convection oven for 55- 60 minutes. Nice crumb and texture. Good flavor with the addition of 1TBlsp. Almond extract.

Added tablespoon of vanilla.  Beat the butter and sugar for 5 minutes, and then for another minute as each egg is added. I also beat for a minute after adding the vanilla (which I do after the eggs). Bake at 325  ~50-60 mins for two 9x5 on highest rack

Very good. Instead of making 3 loaf size cakes I used the auto adjust to cut quantities by 1/3 and made 2. (For example instead of using the 6 eggs as called for I used 4).

This was exactly what I was looking for. I did the 3 loaves and just lined the inside of the pans to make removal easy. I had been looking for the right recipe to go with the fresh fruit topping and homemade whipped cream. I highly recommend if for that application. I also made it exactly as is. I do not see a need to alter the recipe. It's the classic pound cake you would expect to pick up at the store.

Unless I miss-counted the number of cups of sugar or flour, this cake tastes more like bread than cake. If I make it again, I'll play with the sugar/flour ratio.  Was hoping it would be better.

I was shocked how simple it was and it came out tasty!! I cut down the recipe to half and put it in a regular cake pan for 40 mins like how another rater did and sprayed the pan with Pam cooking spray and it came out perfect!

I added 1-1/2 tsp. of pure vanilla extract to the recipe. The cake was delicious - wonderful texture and moist. I used this recipe to make an Easter lamb cake for our 9 grandchildren and the recipe was enough to fill the lamb mold plus a loaf pan.

Sorry, but I really have to question the one-star reviews; maybe they were just expecting something different? Because honestly, I think you'd have to try to mess up this recipe. I actually only made this cake so that I could take pictures of it for a project, so I wasn't terribly invested in the end product- in fact, I only chose pound cake because it required the fewest ingredients and, therefore, no grocery run. I cut the recipe down to one third, I rounded measurements, and my rarely-used loaf pan turned out to be bigger than I thought, so I ended up with an odd, flat loaf. My butter and eggs were cold, and I probably could have beaten everything a litte more thoroughly. The point? This cake is STILL pretty darn good. Would I bring it to a party? Probably not, but it won't last long around my husband and me. And considering how I tortured it, imagine how good it would be done right. For what it's worth, I did add a tablespoon of vanilla, and took it out after 40 minutes because my single, squashed little loaf was looking a bit brown around the edges - probably would've been perfect at around 35 minutes.

OMG! Light, fluffy and delicious. I added a tablespoon of vanilla and made a loaf and 6 mini bundts. Definitely a keeper and going to try different flavors i.e. lemon, orange, etc.

Was excited yet nervous about trying this recipe, pound cake is one of my favorites but haven't been able to have since becoming gluten sensitive. Most gluten free flour mixed just don't match up in texture to regular flour. However, have begun using "Cup4Cup" brand gluten-free flour. Reduced this recipe by half so that if it didn't work well I wouldn't have wasted the full amount of ingredients. Well that was a mistake! This recipe is absolutely outstanding. I was stunned that the flavor and texture were perfect. Honey & Sister were also amazed at how good it was. Will be making this as often as my diet will allow but will make a full recipe. Thank you so much for a wonderful recipe!!!

I was curious if this recipe would work as I have read both good and bad, but I can tell you it definitely does! So light, fluffy, and just yummy! I made a few changes...I only had one 8 x 8 pan so I cut the recipe in half and just made one square pan, baked at same temp for same amount of time. I also added a teaspoon of Vanilla to the batter and some chopped up pineapple bits just cause I had them and it turned out amazing!! Give it a try for sure!!

I made this recipe with soy milk, soy margerine and spelt flour.  It came out nicely moist (did not take as long to bake as expected) and crusty on the outside.  I would halve the sugar next time though.

THE BEST pound cake I've ever had!!!!! Wow! I did add vanilla, and reduced baking time to 325, since I was using a dark bundt pan. Buttered the pan, then coated with sugar, so it made the crust divine. Increased the cooking time to 1hr25min since I had reduced temp. It is dense, moist and has an amazing flavor. LOVE IT!!!!

LOVE this easy & basic recipe! It's great the way it is, but I have also used Self Rising flour when I didn't have AP Flour: still good. I have put a fruit and syrup mixture in the bottom of the pan before pouring the batter in- for upside down cake. I have baked the whole recipe in a half sheet pan, then decorated it for birthdays. The best and easiest cake recipe I've ever used.

An almost perfect recipe. It turned out great just as written. Base cake is a little bland for my taste, though that's the nature of the beast. Next time, I'll add a little vanilla, salt, and cinnamon... maybe blueberries.

Wonderful!!!! Makes alot! Only things I changed was adding vanilla extract, only used 3 sticks of butter and the containers I baked it in. It made 2 9x5 loaf pans, and two trays of mini muffins and added chocolate chips(which my kids LOVED to snatch!) The mini muffins baked less then 20 min. and my loaf pans were only about 50 min.  I took the 9x5 loaf pans and cut them into bites sized cubes, layered with vanilla pudding and strawberries and it made a wonderful dessert! Passed the recipe on and got rave reviews all around! Someone even baked with blueberries!

I reduced this recipe for 10 servings and found it a bit small but terriffic. I added 1 tsp of vanilla, just right. One of the best pound cakes I have ever made. I would add 1 TBSP of vanilla to the full recipe.

This recipe is perfect. I love pound cake and have been looking for a home made version of the famous store-bought brand for over a decade. This is even better! It easily allows for variations, but I love it just as it is. Thank you for sharing!

One word: AMAZING! This is the delicious pound cake that I grew up with and have been craving! The only additions I made was a touch of vanilla and it was perfect! It made my house smell like sugar cookies for days after. Thank you for this amazing and simple recipe!

Wow, amazing pound cake! We used fresh sliced strawberries with it and it was delicious. The nice thing is you have all the ingredients already and don't have to run to the store! I did add a Tbl of vanilla and did not use parchment paper (just greased and floured pans).

Delicious and easy.  I just wanted a "snack" so I just used 1/3 of the recipe.  It turned out great.

I made this pound cake as a trial run for a for a two tier cake project I am making in school. I added orange zest and some of the juice from the orange.I also baked them in a six and ten inch cake pans at 350 for 45 minutes. Wow they turned out amazing! They are dense enough to be stacked but still light enough to be enjoyable.

Thank you for this wonderful, classic recipe! I have actually used your recipe a handful of times over the past year. I usually add mini chocolate chips to ours, and I'll mix up the pan sizes depending on what we're in the mood for. The last batch made one standard loaf, two mini loaves, and a dozen mini muffins. Delicious!

A good and simple recipe that filled our desire to have strawberry shortcake one night.  Simple to follow directions and the cakes themselves turned out how we expected them to look/feel.  We thought it tasted a little too much like sugar and butter without any other complex flavors.  But served with fresh strawberries and whipped cream - it was good.

Very delicious and traditional pound cake.  Be careful not to overcook, check every few minutes after specified time.  I topped it with a lemon glaze, and it was very well received.

This was really yummy!  I scaled it down to make just one loaf and it turned out great.  The only change I made was to add a pinch of salt (I used unsalted butter) and 1/4 tsp almond extract and 1/2 tsp vanilla extract.  It turned out really dense and yummy, and the crusty top and sides were my favorite part!  Oh, I also subbed almond milk for the regular milk.  Will definitely make this again.

Great pound cake. It was a little heavy and the next time I will halve all the ingredients so that I dont end up with 3 pound cakes. I think that I will also sift the flour. That may be the reason it was a little heavy. I also used my mixer to make this but the last step to mix flour and milk in I will forego the mixer and go with hand stirring. Hopefully this will lighten the cake some. I added coconut flavor to one cake almond to another and vanilla to the last. they were all just YUM.

I use cake flour instead of AP. This basic pound cake recipe is a great basic so that you can add whatever flavor extract you want. I've added sweet dough flavor, and I also made a caramel cake using vanilla butternut flavor. Both came out great. I baked the cakes in regular cake pans because I wanted to slice and decorate. The cake was very sturdy. I did bake it at 340 for 40 min. And let cool in the cake pans for about 15 min. before removing. Turned out great. Will never use another pound cake recipe but this one.

Awesome cake! Tastes great topped with custard sauce and fruit or even plain. I love the fact that it requires no leavening besides the eggs. Also nice to use for strawberry shortcake.

WOW!! This is the best pound cake I have ever made.  It is so moist and delicious.  The only problem I had was I put the batter in two 9x5 pans and that made too much.  Took to long to bake and the top got a littlt too done, but other than that this recipe is GREAT. I added two teaspoons of vanilla, but I might use coconut next time.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.
Just wanted to add another note.  I cut the recipe down to 20 servings and put in two 9x5 pans and they come out better.  Tonight is my 3rd cake in two weeks.  My husband and all his co-workers love this cake and each time I have changed the flavoring-vanilla, cinnamon and tonight is coconut.

excellent pound cake!!  I followed all instructions, only adding a little vanilla as others have said. I have never made a pound cake before, I definitely loved it even more the next day.  The texture was perfect, I will definitely be making this for the next family party!

I used this pound cake and tweeked it. I only wanted to make a cake. So I sliced down the serving size to 15. I made a marble swirl cake with it. Nice texture. Added some rum ontop. Took less time to cook. Using this all the time :)

I have never made pound cake before, so I thought it turned out pretty good for my first time and it was a rather easy to follow recipe. I didn't have any extracts to add more flavor (like others suggested), so I added a few tbsps of french vanilla creamer, and powdered hazelnut creamer. I also added cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice. So far everyone has loved it. My hubby ate almost 3/4 of entire loaf to himself!

made this and it is soooo easy and great. I put in 2 cups sugar and 1 cup splenda and then because splenda doesn't rise the same added 1/2 cup skim milk powder and 1/2 teaspoon baking soda. It was beautiful and we're eating it with fresh strawberries. Cooking time was lower than recipe calls for so be careful.

Awesome Recipe!! I added a touch of vanilla in one of the cakes and it makes a difference.  Cook time for me was also a little long.  Just keep an eye on your cake as it gets closer to an hour.

Of course I give this a 5 star!  This is the traditional way to make a pound cake.  The key to a gread pound cake is beating the butter and sugar for at least 5 minutes (my grandma would say 10 minutes!) Beat 1-2 minutes between each egg.  Great served with strawberries and whipped cream or just alone wtih a cup of coffee! mmmmm :)

This is a great pound cake recipe. It is exactly what I expect from a pound cake - a dense, moist cake. It doesn't have any strong flavors. It is wonderful topped with berries and cream! I decreased the servings to 10 and made just one loaf. Thanks for a great recipe.

Mmmm, perfect pound cake!  I made this to use as base for Strawberry Shortcake and it got rave reviews!  Followed the recipe as written and it was so delicious.

This was sooooooooo delicious!!!  I had to make another batch for my family.  Also, I messed up on my diet and ate this wonderful cake.  I couldn't just eat one piece. Wonderful!!!  I did pour a small bit of glaze over this after it was done cooking.  I made the glaze from confectioners sugar and milk.

I scaled back the recipe to serve 10 and it came out wonderful.  I drizzled the butter sauce from Kentucky Butter Cake (this website) over the pound cake.  I think I just died and went to hog heaven.  Thank you.  Will make again.

This is the best fool proof pound cake recipe I have ever found. I have made it with almond flavoring, lemon flavoring with poppy seeds in it, and mandarin oranges and orange flavoring in it. It comes out fantastic every time.

As is, the cake turned out dry so I overhauled it for my taste. Reduced the flour to 3 cups, used 1 cup of sour cream instead of milk.  I added 4 t vanilla and 1/4 t baking soda. I separated the eggs and dropped in the yokes one at a time. I whipped up the egg whites until stiff peaks formed and folded the egg whites into the cake batter just before pouring into the bundt pan.  The cake came out fabulous and I keep getting asked to make it again and again.  Thank grandmother for her great base recipe.

i made this cake a few days ago and i got great reviews for it, my cake turned out moist; it tasted great. I didn't heat my oven at 350degrees; for fear that it would burn; i lowered the heat to 310 degrees for an hour and 20 minutes

This is just the recipe that I wanted. It is the fourth recipe I tried, and the best. It was easy to make and very good. I did add the vanilla.  I made this for a Thanksgiving dinner with a tropical fruit topping.  Everyone loved it and 3 ppl asked for the recipe.  One is an ex- baker

It came out better than I expected!  Delicious - everyone loved my first foray into making my very own pound cake instead of buying another preservative-laden store-bought one.  I added vanilla extract and next time may test it with lemon extract.  :o)

Didn’t change a single ingredient, but halves the recipe. Had to bake my 9x5 loaf pan for about 80 minutes. Dense, not-too-sweet, with an awesome “crust” and fantastic with homemade whipped cream and raspberries!  Made a loaf on Friday and making another for my daughter’s teacher appreciation lunch on Monday.

I adjusted the portions from 30 to 10 because I only needed one loaf.   This is the best pound cake my husband and I have ever had.  The first loaf was gone and he had to go on a road trip and he asked me to make another so he could snack on it during the trip.  I highly recommend this recipe.  Also, I live at 5400 ft. and did not make any high altitude adjustments for ingredients. Just keep an eye on your baking time, not sure if mine was less because of my oven or my altitude.

Thank you for the recipe!
I made this cake and brought it to our church’s potluck lunch. It was a hit and not a crumb was left! They were asking for more!

I also whipped up a cup of powdered sugar with two tablespoons of milk and a teaspoon of cinnamon for a glaze.

I want to say 1st that I do not like pound cake!!! I made it for my God mother because she requested one and I like to back. I came on this website searching for a repicie and I chose this one. I read all the reviews and after a few alterations, this cake was delicious even for me. My alterations were: I preheated my oven to 325 degrees. I used 2 loaf pans instead of a bundt pan. Eggs and butter must be room temperature! I used one cup of brown sugar and 2 cups of white and creamed with the butter for literally 20min ( I set a timer). Add one egg at a time, 1 min apart. I used 1/2 tablespoon of pure vanilla and 1/2 tablespoon of almond extract. I also put in 1/4 tablespoon of lemon extract. I used cake flour instead of all purpose flour and sifted 3 times before adding in with heavy whipping cream instead of milk. I baked for about an hour.  I waited until it completely cooled.  Cake came out light brown, full flavored, and delicious.

Turn out great! Per other reviews I used Cake flour in place of all-purpose, 8 Eggs, 1 cup of heavy whipping cream and 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract. I used 3 loaf pans cooking on 350 for about 50 to 55 minutes.

I didn’t change a thing (just added vanilla extract) and it came out perfect!! 
I made a loaf cake instead....10 servings instead of 30.
It’s perfect on it’s own. Next time I want to maybe add some raisins and nuts to it or go lighter with some kind of fruit in there or add icing to it. I’ve so many plans with this cake lol

This was a success for me on the first try! My family devoured it! I decided to add a lemon glaze which all loved. Big hit! I can’t wait for an excuse to make it again.

This pound cake was excellent.  We enjoyed it with some fresh Florida strawberries and whipped cream.  A perfect dessert!  I followed the recipe exactly - you really have to take the time to cream the sugar and butter...and even more time mixing after adding each egg.  A little time consuming, but worth every bite!

This is the best pound cake recipe ever! I followed it almost exactly. I used half brown sugar half white sugar and an extra teaspoon of vanilla. I also made a brown sugar pineapple mixture and placed it in the bottom of the bread pans. It turned out amazing! I will make this for sure again. A note to those who think this recipe doesn't turn out, there is gluten in flour and when you overmix it, it becomes rubbery. The 5 minute mixing is meant for before you put in the flower. I mixed for five minutes before adding eggs. I then mixed for one minute after each egg then only mixed long enough to incorporate the flower by each cup.

I've made this several times when I need pound cake for a trifle. I  use 1/3 the ingredients, cut the sugar to 3/4 cup and bake it in a 1/2 sheet jelly roll pan for 15-20 min.  This is a great, simple recipe.

I added almond extract and vanilla extract; beat the sugar and butter for 10 minutes as suggested by someone else and used pastry flour instead; also made a cherry filling from frozen cherries, sugar and tapioca starch that I added to the middle. Cake took 80 minutes to cook in a bundt pan, no doubt due to volume and extra filling. Delicious!

I love this pound cake!  I had a hanging for a cherry pound cake so I added a jar of well drained maraschino cherries mixed with about a 1/4 cup of the flour the recipe called for.  I also added a tbsp of vanilla extract as stated by a few reviewers.  
I lined the pans with parchment and the loaves turned out golden brown and delicious!    The baking takes a little time, but well worth the wait.  An excellent pound cake.  I'll never buy store bought again!!

OMG! So good. My husband has been asking me to try making pound cake. I used this recipe and he didn’t even get out of the kitchen with it, just ate it right there. I added 1tablespoon of vanilla, otherwise I made it as written. This will definitely be my go to pound cake recipe!!

This recipe is amazing! Everyone loved and required one for the holidays coming. I sure will add this as a 'go-to-fav! I added and subtracted a couple ingredients and a glaze. I added banana flav and a pinch of salt for contrast. Subtracted 1/4 sugar since I added glaze. Yum!

For the glaze, I used 4 oz of white chocolate, 1/4 cream cheese, tsp vanilla, .5 stick of butter, .5 cup confectionery sugar. Room temperature, whip all ingredients. If needed, thin with a with few drops of water. Drizzle over cake.  Yum

This cake was ok.   I’ll probably just keep looking and try a true pound cake, which is a pound of each ingredient  (a pound of sugar is about 2 cups, not 3; a pound of eggs is about 8; no milk should be added). I did add a tablespoon of vanilla. It’d be pretty bland without it. Also, a recipe I used (and lost) a long time ago said to beat the sugar and butter together for about 10 minutes, because you want the sugar crystals to dissolve, to give it a better texture. I did do that.

I won't be saving this recipe. It was bland and tasted too much like butter.  Now having said that the  cake was amazingly soft and fluffy. Possibly a good starting base for a pound cake, minus the excess butter.

I keep making this .... I don't know how many times -- I shouldn't eat a lot of carbs, so I tend to gift these.  The only change I made, is I stir in a half-teaspoon of double-strength vanilla  with the milk because I love the aroma of vanilla (I use Penzey's as it's not half-artificial like other double-strength vanillas tend to be).  I have nice ceramic loaf pans that work really well.  The key is having all the ingredients at room temperature.  Use the highest quality ingredients you can afford -- if that's the uncut pound of store-brand butter, it's still tasty, but this is a recipe where all the ingredients shine because it's so basic and has so few ingredients.  If you can pay the tariff on Euro or Irish butter, then go for it.  Same for farmers' market eggs.

I have made this twice, and it has been delicious both times. I got raving reviews about how good it was. No use looking for another one. It’s the best.

I absolutely loved this recipe! It was a hit in my house. I only used half the amount of sugar and it still tasted delicious!. In the future i plan on serving this with a lemon glaze. Definately a recipe to keep ;)

I found this recipe and was uncertain how it would turn out because of the mixed reviews but figured I would give it a go. 
I used coconut oil and coconut milk because I had no butter and also had leftover coconut milk, I was very nervous about the turn out since this was my first time making this recipe and I changed it on the first go, which I never do. 
But the cake turned out fantastic, the texture of this cake is absolutely amazing! It was a hit with my family but I do have one complaint...
I disliked the lack of flavor, I was surprised there was no vanilla in the recipe. I am sure if I had used butter it would have been more flavorful, but the lack of vanilla or other extract shocked me. I will toy around with adding vanilla or some other extract when I make again.

I accidentally undercooked it a bit cause I thought it was starting to burn the edges. It’s like a sugar cookie. Very good, but leave out on counter. In the fridge it gets hard to eat. Cupcakes sound awesome!

Too sugary.  No salt.  Maybe salt would cut the sugary taste.  Texture wise, its great tho.  I just think the sweetness was way too high.  If yours comes out 'rubbery' like the occasional reviewer calls it, that mean you developed gluten.  Avoid gluten by not over beating once the flour is added.

Very good!  This was my first time making pound cake.  I baked 2/3 of the batter in a 9x12 stoneware cake pan and the other 1/3 in a stoneware loaf pan.  I followed the recipe exactly  and buttered/lined the pans with parchment paper - it makes getting the cakes out so easy!   They cooked a little faster than expected, about 55 min.  Thank you for sharing!

Amazing.  I used European butter to give more buttery flavor.   Made one batch with almond flavor and one with vanilla... almond was better.   Froze next batch in slices and it comes out perfect when you thaw later.   This is a great recipe. Easy to make and delicious.

This is the perfect recipe for pound cake ! Thanks for sharing .
I used half the ingredients and made just one loaf .I used less sugar because my husband likes the cakes less sweet . 
Like another reviewer suggested I whipped the sugar + butter for a good 20 min, and sifted the flour before measuring .
The result was AWESOME !

A critical instruction is missing from Step 2. The butter, sugar and eggs must be beat for a good ten minutes. If you mix until just incorporated you’ll end up with a dense bread-like lump, resulting in a 1 or 2 star result. I mix butter and sugar for 7 minutes and then 1 egg at a time, allowing about 1 1/2 minutes between each egg addition. Magic—the difference between barely passable & outstanding.

The batter tastes like sugar cookie dough! Very moist and crunchy on outside. I made it in a tube pan and added a glaze. Next time going to use about 1/2 c less sugar. Just a little sweet but so delicious!

Enjoyed this. A few observations: the end result batter was thicker than I expected. Worked out fine, but I was surprised. I don’t get the parchment paper idea. Unnecessary imo. Next time I’ll go straight to the pan. I added a little vanilla extract - a little more than one table spoon. Didn’t make a difference. Next time I’ll ad 3-4. And I baked it too long. I was using the toothpick method as per the suggestions in the recipe. It was coming out not clean well over the time so I left it in. Ends up I should have taken it out earlier. It’s just a hefty batter and it would have been fine at 70 minutes. So I’ll do that next time. Mine was still quite good but it was a little dry because of the over baking. I’ll make this again for sure though. Simple ingredients. Easy to make. Just make sure all ingredients are room temp and mix well. I didn’t use a mixing bowl thing and it was fine.

For those who want success with any pound cake:  First of all, the ingredients need to be at room temperature.

Beat the butter alone for a good five minutes and gradually add in the sugar. No shortcuts on time here! You want it to be thoroughly incorporated. Add the eggs, one at a time, and again, beat well. Repeat. I've always added in the flavorings next, beat well, and then the milk, beat well. Then slowly add in the flour. You should end up with a very smooth, silky and thick batter. Spoon it into your prepared pans and bake.

Great recipe, my family and I loved it. Very lightly sweet, and not a heavy, buttery pound cake. It was nice and light. Also very few ingredients, and we always have them at home. Good to make anytime! Thanks for the great recipe:)

WOW! This has to be the best pound cake recipe outside there!
I did use truvia to lower the sugar in the carb count. And beat the stuffing out of the butter and truvia. Just made 1/2 pound cake  due to just two of us. An absolutely lovely cake!

My grandma made this with me as a kid and it brought back memories.  I used a bunt pan and dropped the time down to 58 minutes in a small convection oven.  Next time I will drop a few minutes and see if I can mail the moisture.  I put the left over batter in small loaf pans but cooked it too long.  Great recipe and simple to make.

This is the BEST pound cake.   I did add one tablespoon of vanilla.
This is so easy and delicious.   I put it in a bunt pan, it baked on 230 degrees for 70 minutes.

I halved the recipe and weighed my ingredients to get exactly half a pound of each. I also substituted pouring cream for the milk but I needed the 2/3 cup of liquid for the half recipe as was called for in the whole recipe, and I added 2 tsps of vanilla extract. I baked at 320F (160C) for 75 minutes in a large 2lb loaf tin.

My brother loves cakes made from scratch.  I don't usually bake but I had to make this one twice because he loved it as well as my sister who happened to pop by.  Made two cakes in 24 hours.

I added a teaspoon of  vanilla and about 1/2-1 teaspoon of salt (I only had unsalted butter on hand). Followed the rest of the directions and ingredients. Creamed butter and sugar for 5 minutes on med-high and then added eggs one at a time beating for 1 minute after each egg. Then added salt and vanilla and beat for 1 more minute. Alternated adding flour and milk and spooned into bundt pan sprayed with baker's joy. Baked 350 for 60 minutes (until center was set). Yum!

I love pound cake, and after trying a few recipes with disappointing results, I come back most often to this one. I gave it 5 stars because it's an excellent base cake and can be tweaked to perfection according to taste. Not to be one of those people who are like, "I loved it! I changed half the ingredients," but this is how I make it, with stellar results. I love a buttery cake with a hint of salt to offset the sweetness of the sugar, and this hits the spot.

I make a half recipe and put it in a sculpted Bundt pan, which fills about 2/3 of the pan. I use cream instead of milk. I add 1 tsp salt (so if you're making a full recipe, make it 2 tsp). I add 1 Tbsp of vanilla (again, double for a full recipe). I have also made this with a tablespoon of orange zest, or lemon zest (either one is great! you get a beautiful light citrus flavor), or 1/3 cup of chocolate chips.

If you're using a Bundt pan, bake for 45-55 minutes. My oven runs a little cool, so I test at 50 minutes and then go for the extra 5 if needed, which creates a glorious brown crust on the cake. Then, let the cake cool on the oven top for 10-15 minutes, then bang it hard against the floor several times to get the cake to release from the sides of the pan. You can let it cool for another 10 minutes or so if you wish, then turn it out of the pan.

Another secret: wrap the WARM cake tightly in Saran Wrap. No, this will not make your cake soggy. It seems like that's what would happen, but it doesn't. It seals in all th

This was great for my red, white, & blue berry trifle dessert.  I halved the recipe, then baked it in a 8x4" loaf pan.  I cooled the baked cake, cubed it, then layered it with raspberries, vanilla pudding combined with Cool Whip, then the cake.  The sweet crust  added a nice texture contrast with the soft-textured ingredients.  Was beautiful & delicious!

I made this pound cake, I didn't like how much batter was left when I made this. However I did add some ingredients that made the cake more sweet. I added half a tablespoon of sour cream, a teaspoon of almond extract and half of a teaspoon of vanilla extract. This makes a great treat for a get together. :)

I followed directions exactly, except for cutting recipe in half. This includes having ingredients at room temp, and adding eggs one at a time an d  beating for two minutes each. Don't know why this is important, but it seems to be! I never thought I would be able to make a 'from-scratch' cake that turned out so well. It was light, fluffy, just the right texture, and WHAT A TASTE! Going to make it again now,

I'm rating the recipe 5* because the cake itself  is great, exactly as written.  (pound cake batter is always thick, and it does not require additional liquid to thin it out).   However, I made the mistake of pouring all the batter into a large bunt pan, layering as I went with maraschino cherries, and that was a mistake.  The outside of the cake cooked faster than the inside did so the outside was dry and the inside gluey. :(  Next time I will either make 1/2 the recipe or I will use 2 or possibly 3 loaf pans to ensure even cooking.

This is a true pound cake, dense, moist, and delicious. For added flavor, I added a tablespoon of vanilla and a tsp of almond extract. Be aware that almond extract is a very strong flavor. I wish I had added less, but this pound cake was delicious nonetheless. It has a crunchy outer layer  with a moist interior. As noted in other ratings, the batter is quite thick, so "pouring"  the batter into prepared pans is not quite an accurate term. I "scooped" it into the pans.  I ended up with extra batter, which I baked into muffins. Excellent recipe!!

I always use this recipe and I serve it topped with fresh fruit and a dollop of freshly whipped cream!  So much better than the fruit cup cakes they sell at the market!.  It goes together in a snap.  The recipe is always requested when I make it for company so I keep pre-made recipe cards on hand to give out.

One of my friends said said this is the first recipe that ever came close to his own grandmother's beloved pound cake.  He asks for it for a birthday cake and treasures every bite.  It makes WAY too much batter.  I am going to try cutting it in half next time.

This recipe is VERY similar to one I use. My recipe calls for Swan's Down cake flour, and 3/4 cup of milk instead of 2/3 and is baked at 325 instead of 350 for 1.5 hours in a tube pan. This cake is delicious!!!!

Turned out delicious! It was moist and tasty, yum! I beat the heck out of the batter with the egg beater (I may have to purchase another one in the near future, sounds like she's starting to give out, haha) I used a round bunt pan and baked for about 45 m @ 350 degrees...I followed baking instructions posted in a review.

I will say that you definitely have to make sure you beat the butter and sugar until very light and fluffy, and do not skip the adding only one egg at a time. It might not seem like a big deal, but since there is nothing else to make this cake rise, you MUST beat everything very well before you add the flour. Once you're adding the flour, don't overbeat it or, again, it won't rise correctly. I always make a recipe by the directions the first time, and it is awesome, but I'm sure it would be great with vanilla,lemon, or almond extract added. Yum!!

It's a great basic recipe and there are so many things you can add to it. I've made it with sliced strawberries and honey so far. My family loves it!

Amazing.  As suggested by others, I added a teaspoon of vanilla.  My husband, who is not a fan of pound cake, raved about it.  I will be making this again.

I made the exact recipe just because I wanted to try it! It was okay, but not as good as other recipes I've tried. I know I can't really criticize because it's a pound cake, but it started browning/burning on the edges really quickly and the top is sort of marbled from the butter. All in all it was an interesting experience but I'll go for a different recipe next time.

This is a good base recipe but I think it needs to be a little more specific! My first attempt came out badly (rubbery and crumbly) but I researched some baking tips for pound cake online and the second came out perfect! 

Use unsalted butter (you can add salt to your taste if you'd like). Make sure all wet ingredients (eggs, milk, and butter) are room temperature. Make sure the butter is softened (not melted or still hard!). Add the 1/3 of the flour to the sugar/eggs/butter, mix, then 1/2 the milk, mix, then 1/3 of the flour again, mix, then the rest of the milk, mix, then add the last of flour. When mixing (I used a hand mixer), total mixing time should only be 3-5 minutes.

The reason why cakes turn out rubbery or crumbly is because it is overmixed (which is what I did the first attempt). Also you need to let it cool before taking it out of the pan or else it will turn even more crumbly. 

I hope this helps!

Wonderful crispy crust on the outside and tender, moist cake on the inside. This is awesome! I bumped the liquid up to 1 cup and used a combination of buttermilk and heavy cream. I also added 1 TBSP of vanilla. I used 9 x 5-inch pans. Otherwise, I followed the directions exactly. My cakes were done in 60 minutes. They fell out of the pan very easily and the parchment paper came off on its own -- I didn't need to peel it off.  I wrapped the loaves in plastic wrap and stuck them in a ziplock bag until serving time. I agree with others who have said that those who  find it bland and "bread-like" don't know what pound cake is supposed to be. This is fabulous and the perfect backdrop for the strawberries and whipped cream that will go it later tonight.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

This did not rise or brown the way I thought it should. I am not sure why. From the pictures it should have.  I did use slightly larger pans(9x5) maybe I should have divided the batter in half rather than thirds. The cook time was also off by 25 minutes. Thank goodness I know when things begin to smell they are typically done. Otherwise, I would have had a very burned pound cake. The flavor is somewhat eggy but good. I am looking forward to trying it with strawberries and whipped cream. 
Edit*** My family loved this topped with strawberries and whipped cream. Yum! Thanks for a great recipe!

I'm going to give this recipe all the stars I know it deserves even though it didn't turn out well for me. The center was gooey no matter how long I baked it. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of adding  1 T. of vanilla extract and baking in a bundt pan. Clearly I did something wrong but I have no clue what. Will definitely try again because I know how great it will be when I get it right!

Great recipe!  I halved the amount and it all fit into a 9x5 loaf pan. I only added a teaspoon of vanilla extract but pretty much stuck to the recipe as stated....this will definitely be a staple for my family!

The recipe states to "pour" the mix into the loaf pan but my mix was too thick for that and I ended up spooning and smoothing it down.  I was worried it was going to turn out terribly but despite my concerns, it rose perfectly and tastes amazing!

NO CHANGES NEEDED...I have made this recipe a dozen times...and it always comes out perfectly...whenever we attend a pot luck...and I am asked to bring a desert...I always take this cake...when I walk in and set the cake down with all the other desserts...I can always feel the attitude..."oh how nice...you brought a POUND CAKE"....but it is ALWAYS the first desert to be eaten, everyone wants the recipe, and I NEVER have to take anything home...If you loved your grandmothers pound cake...then your gonna love this one !!

PLEASE NOTE:   Use the best ingredients that you can buy...I always use the best Irish Butter I can find, and farm fresh eggs....literally....if you can find eggs that were in the chicken coop a few hours ago...the end product will be AMAZING !!!

I used this recipe as guide as I really wanted a sponge I could make with coconut flour.  I was the afraid that the butter would be too much so I used one cup and 1/3 cup of coconut oil as the coconut flour I was using was also pretty oily.  I used 1 1/2 cups of coconut flour reducing the white flour to 2 1/2 cups.  It turned out beautifully the first time!  The next time I tried it, I made cupcakes for my niece's birthday and added a coconut frosting. Perfect!

This was my first time ever making pound cake- I used to make a trifle with bananas, pastry cream, whipped cream and vanilla wafer crumbs.  

I creamed the butter for a couple min on med speed, then added the sugar and creamed it for a few more min.  I added the eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition.  I used 3 loaf pans and baked it at 340 degrees for about 70 min.  I think I slightly overbaked it.  It can be a little deceiving because it looked gooey in the middle still but I should have taken it out about 10 min sooner.  If you overbaked, it'll get very dry.  it was still really good and had great flavor!!  Will make again!

I halved this recipe last night. I'd always assumed pound cake would be one of those things where baking it would be difficult and, maybe not worth the effort. BOY was I WRONG! It was easy to cut the ingredients list in half and it worked up fast!  I ended up with a beautiful, high, light, crusty pound cake that was as delicious as it was beautiful. The crust was light, but crispy. The  inside was moist and silky. I will never be able to eat store-bought pound cake again!

This is a yummy recipe. I made it for 30 servings to only use one pan and it was delicious.  However I under baked it.  Other reviews had it baking for shorter time than listed. I baked it for 45 min at 350. The center was not done. I will make again and bake longer.

My 91 year old father in law has been after us to find the "Dutch cake" he remembers his grandmother making or bakeries having.  Dense, fine textures and won't fall apart when you dunk it .  Ta Da!  This  is it or as close as he can remember it being.

I cooked it in a small nonstick square cooking pan (to cut into cubes for fondue) and it actually cut the time in less than a half. Tastes great but watch it or it will burn.

This was yummy. I only added 2 and a quarter cups of sugar and it was plenty sweet for me. I also cooked it at 325 instead and checked it every 10 minutes after it was in for an hour. Moist, sweet, dense. I would use again for sure.

It was a very good density, but I thought the sugar was too much. Sugar did not seem to dissolve completely, although I'm sure it did- it just tasted as though it didn't. Having said that, my husband and friend thought is was wonderful. They each gave it 5 stars, but my preferences is difference perhaps, so I knocked off one star. I will try using a little less sugar next time, but it was an otherwise good recipe.

I made this recipe exactly as instructed, except that I added 3 tsp of vanilla extract and 2 tsp almond extract.  Even with all that flavoring, it tasted somewhat bland.  I'm not sure why all these reviews say that you need to beat the daylights out of the batter--the recipes says no such thing and actually cautions against over-beating in the final stages.  I wish I had ignored the reviewers and spent less time beating this batter.  The cake came out much, much too fluffy for a pound cake, which should be denser.  Otherwise, the texture was very nice.  I ended up having to frost it for the sake of flavor.  I might make it again, but with a lot less beating and a fruit compote to drizzle on top.

I used this recipe for a flag cake.  It was a big hit! Everyone loved it. I will definitely make it again, maybe with chocolate chips in it.

It was an amazing base!!! I tweeked it a bit. Made half the batter to fill two 6 inch pans, but instead of using 3 eggs (which would be half the recipe) I put 4 and the milk would have been 1/3 cup but I put 1 cup (even more milk than the original) I added a splash of vanilla and two generous spalshes of almond essence.

I don't think I will ever make this again. It turned out almost burnt on the outside, and not cooked at all on the inside. I triple checked the temperature to cook it at, but it was fine. My failure might have been that I accidentally added too many eggs, and it looks like it might be an all right recipe if I had the guts to try it again correctly. Other than the eggs, I followed the instructions exactly.

I used a scale to measure 1 pound each of flour, sugar, and egg. In my experiment, I used extra large eggs, and got 1.08 pounds from 8 eggs, after removing the shells.

I substituted lemon juice for the milk to make a lemon pound cake. The dough was liquidy enough to flow in the bowl, but when I poured it into the pans, it broke off in pieces just past the rim. The result was far superior to pound cakes that skimp on butter, or eggs. For my personal not-too-sweet-please tooth, the sugar was a little much, but not so much that I would deprive others of it.

This is such a great recipe. Unfortunately, I made an error on the sugar, I added 2 cups instead of 3 but it still turned out nice. Guess you just can't go wrong on this recipe. I used margarine instead of butter. Apart from that, I followed everything to the letter. Such a great recipe. This is a keeper! Next, I'm trying with vanilla essence, raisins, chocolate chips, etc

This recipe is just ok. It is a very basic pound cake nothing special. It was very easy to make. Taste was kind of blah by its self and it was dry. I ended up putting some raspberry jam on it and it was good. I probably will not be making it again.

Wonderful pound cake!  I made no changes to the ingredients or amounts.  I did not add any extracts.  This cake was delicious and everyone who tried it agreed.  I beat butter and sugar for 5 minutes, maybe a little longer; and one minute (minimum) after each egg.  I baked in a Bundt pan, which did not easily release the cake - this is where lining with parchment would have helped.

This is a great recipe, The middle cooked pretty slowly though, and by the time the middle was cooked, the edges were a little darker than i would have liked them.But the taste was spot on.

Only needed one loaf, so it was really nice to be able to adjust the servings. Made the cake to go with fresh strawberries and whip cream.  The cake was still warm when we are, delicious!!  Will definitely make it again.

Wow! The entire family enjoyed this pound cake. Brought one to work and it was gone in minutes, will never use another recipe. I did add 2 tsps of vanilla, other than that followed the recipe to a tee. Go ahead, make it, you won't regret it.

I don't think I've ever given 5 stars, but I have to with this recipe.  I followed the instructions exactly and have a beautiful, delicious pound cake which I am enjoying now with home made ice cream.  However, in my oven at 350, it took 45 minutes, not 70, so check your cake at 45 minutes and see if it needs more time.  

 The batter is huge and was too much for my pan so I took the left over batter (about 2 cups) to my landlady.  She promptly filled it with nuts and dried cranberries and I baked it for her while she was out.  I'll get her review later, but this recipe is fantastic.

Nice buttery flavor.   Easy to make.   Proportions are at the limit for my kitchenaid mixer.   I did 1 standard loaf,  8 mini loaves, and 8 cupcake size. 
I added 2 tsp of vanilla,  6oz dried cherries,  2 cups of ghiradelli chocolate chips. 
Will make again!

I think this is war time food, calorie dense and made to sustain a person through a nuclear winter. It's so sweet even my SO declined to finish his slice and that's pretty rare. Eating the crust on it is akin to having the caramelized crust on a creme brulee. The texture is WONDERFUL, however. Very light, fluffy, and soft. I baked mine in a bundt pan for the full 70 minutes, but no longer even though the middle was still a bit wet. After it rested it was perfectly cooked. Otherwise the flavor was a little bland, aside from the sugar, and definitely needs something else to make it stand out.

I was very pleased with this pound cake and my dinner guests loved it.  We had a Brazilian couple over for dinner, so I wanted to give them a classic American experience.  We had vegetable beef soup with grilled cheese sandwiches and this delicious pound cake with fresh strawberries (slightly sweetened) and whipped creme).  They really seemed to love it.  It was fun to explain to them about "poundings" and how the pound cake got its name.  It was a great evening thanks to this wonderfully simple dessert, and since it made three loaves I was able to send them home with one!

Turned out great, I weighed my ingredients to a pound on a scale (except eggs, and milk). I added a cap of almond and a cap of vanilla extracts. I only had one loaf pan so i put the rest in a 13x13 ( i dont have many cake pans!) and it turned out just fine, pulled the cake pan out before the loaf as it was done earlier. This was my first time making pound cake, and the batter was surprisingly fluffy and light, I was afraid with nothing to rise it would be flat. but it turned out perfect!

I halved the recipe.  I used almond milk (that's all I had) and I should have baked it 60 minutes instead of 70.  Made a cream cheese frosting glaze for the top.

It was my first time making pound cake and it was delicious! I followed the recipe exactly then added almond extract and vanilla extract. I served warm with vanilla ice cream and fresh sliced strawberries, drizzled with honey. nom!

This cake was certainly moist. The cake is comparable to a basic cake that needs other flavors to enhance it, such as a vanilla, lemon or orange extract topped with fruit. I've made other pound cakes for others and they agree that this particular recipe is not their favorite.

I made this cake several times. I was not happy with the results and will not make it again. Every time I made it my crust crumbled. I tried mixing less, I tried lowering the temp of the oven, I tried a different cake pan, I tried different flour - nothing worked. It was, however, very tasty, just not pretty. I want my cakes to be as pretty as they taste.

There was nothing wrong with how this turned out, but the flavor reminded me of too many of my other recipes for baked goods. I would have preferred something that stood out a little more and was perhaps a bit lighter. This was quite dense, though moist. Perhaps a simple blueberry compote on top would add something??

I really liked this cake, and I will use it again.  It did form a crust from all of the sugar though.  Like a tough outer crust, top and bottom.  I will try reducing the bake time next time.

I was hesitant to rate this with 4 stars, because the end result is so delicious.  The flavors are on point. I added 1 tsp of vanilla and 1 tsp of butter extract as the previous comment suggested.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 however, because it baked so unevenly, the inside was more like gooey butter cake than pound cake while outside edges got pretty crispy and I had to kind of pry it out of the pan...this could have definitely been due to operator error but I did follow the directions to the T, so I'm not sure what happened. Give this recipe a try - it's quick, easy and delicious, despite the issues I had with baking it.

This pound cake is delicious. I added some vanilla for flavor. My only gripe was that the cooking time was (for me) a little too long. I like my pound cake non crispy on the outside and 70 minutes cooking time made it crispy. Everybody else loved it though!

This is a very easy recipe for pound cake and turned out great. If I wanted it to be larger, would perhaps change amounts to 20 servings and bake in 1 loaf pan, cake was a little small.  I added about 3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract, other than that no changes! I will probably make this again.  Planning on serving as an easter desert with jello and fresh fruit and whipping cream!

Great flavor and texture.  I'm not sure about the parchment paper lining though because I had to pull the parchment paper out of the sides of the loaves making for a funny shaped loaf.

I followed this exactly except for the part i missed - I only used two pans instead of three and i had to cook an additional 8 minutes.  It is DELICIOUS!  Perfect texture, moist and firm, sweet crunchy top.

I tried this recipe over the weekend with my children and it was amazing. The only thing I did different was add 1 1/2 tsp of pure vanilla extract. It was very moist and didn't last the day in my house of 8.

Perfect!! I made this for new Year's Eve to Dip in Chocolate Fondue. I saw this recipe made 3 loafs. I didn't need that many for 8 of us for Fondue, so I decided to cut this recipe in thirds....so I only made 1 loaf. Boy, I should have made the 3....it was way better then store bought SaraLee Pound cake. Next time I will make the 3 loaves and freeze the. Can't wait for strawberry season to make more for Shortcake! It's even very tasty by itself....with a cup of coffee in them morning!! You won't be disappointed! ENJOY :)

Even with the tooth pick coming out clean, it was under baked when cut into. 
It tastes fine (though not like pound cake which I'm usually a fan of) but is structurally a mess. It's the first thing that hasn't come out good in maybe a dozen years or more. It has the exact structural issue as the first cake I ever baked without supervision (6th grade maybe?)
Again, the mess up is probably my fault, but then again, it's not easy baking a new recipe while making dinner and holding my baby all at the same time.

I was looking for a great pound cake recipe and came across this recipe it is fabulous! My client loved it so much that she has ordered another one for Christmas! Thanks to the person who submitted this recipe. Even after overcooking the first one and burning the top part it was still fabulous. 12/23/14!  I just made this cake again for the same customer, this time, I used  lemon extract!  OMG it was better than the first.  This will be my favorite pound cake.

Oh this is the best cake! Perfect for gift giving too. I added a few things to make it original. I added 1 tsp salt, 1 Tblsp lemon extract, 2 Tblsp vanilla extract, & 1 tsp coconut extract. If I had almond extract on hand I would have added 1 tsp almond extract. BAKING change too. Grease Bundy pan with Crisco butter & flour lightly. Set  Oven temp 325 degrees bake cake for 90 minutes(1&1/2 hrs.) To not burn cake & soon as it cones out the oven place serving plate on top of bundt pan & flip it as it slides right out of cake. Easy cleanup too.

I love this recipe! It's not dry like most pound cake I tasted, it's light, fluffy, but still crisp on the outside.
I added a teaspoon of baking powder and added a little bit of vanilla just to kick it. And it was wonderful. I'll try to make it again without any modification next time.

I just made this cake today for the first time. It is amazing! We will try it tomorrow with strawberries (some with balsamic vinegar)and whipped cream. I made 2/3 of a batter and put it in my bundt pan. Cooked at 350 for 45 min. Perfect. I followed as written except used heavy cream since I was out of milk. Thank you for the recipe.

I've never made pound cake before and this was a fantastically perfect recipe! I only made a third of the recipe and used it for strawberry shortcake, and got RAVE reviews!

We enjoyed this classic cake!  Just the recipe I was looking for.  I added 1 Tbsp of vanilla extract and it turned out wonderful.  I was planning on freezing a couple of the loaves but I don't think we will have a need!

Simple and tasty!  Added a little vanilla extract, scaled recipe down to make one cake. Baking in square pan in convection oven only took 35-40 minutes.

Was an excellent pound cake for our Memorial Day picnic this year.  It paired well with a lemon pie filling...  The sweet and sour complimented one another.  Will definitely make it again, so easy!

This came out great & was simple to make! I halfed the recipe which made enough for one good cake. The only mistake I made was opening the oven to check on the cake... it caved in and stopped rising, so don't be tempted. I am making it again, 4 days later...

I tried this recipe yesterday but I cut the ingredients in half because I only wanted one 9x5 loaf pan sized cake. Went together really easy and baked up nice and full but at 350 for 70 minutes it burnt around the edges. Could be the new loaf pan I used because it's a dark metal one or maybe I need to bake it at 325 instead. We haven't tasted it yet but it seemed kind of dry when I cut it in half to wrap it but I know that was because it was over baked. Anyway next time I'll try turning the oven down to 325 and just watching and testing until it's fully baked so I don't burn the edges again. I'm rating it 5 stars just because it goes together so quickly and easily and has so few ingredients. The over baking was my own fault since I was using a new pan and halving the recipe and then not watching it close enough. We're going to use it for strawberry shortcake so I'm sure the juice from the berries and whipped cream will make it more than edible.

Delicious!! I only added 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract, changed the recipe to 15 servings and baked it in a loaf pan for 75 minutes. It was so good! Next time I will add 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract and the vanilla.

I just made this today for the first time.  It's a simple recipe that's true to the old-fashioned pound cake and most importantly, it's delicious!  I did add vanilla extract to it and rather than baking it in loaf pans, I divided the batter in between 2 cake pans.  It took less time baking this way so, if you're planning on making a layer cake, keep an eye on them.

This was absolutely delicious! My family members all loved it! I did add in a tablespoon of vanilla into the batter but otherwise I left it exactly the same. I managed to make to make 1 loaf, 12 cupcakes and a square sheet cake with this one recipe. Thanks for posting it!

Made the pound cake for my mother's birthday and it was a huge hit.  I love it, too!  I also added 2 tsp of vanilla and approx. 1 TBSP of lemon rind.  Next time a will also a tsp of mace.  But it was very tasting and moist.  My husband who doesn't like a lot a sweets loved this recipe.  Thanks for recipe.

I searched for a pound cake recipe for quite some time before settling on this one... Glad i did... the first loaf was devoured within 30 minutes of it cooling!!  I too added vanilla after reading through the comments.  Thanks for the recipe!!

I made this in a 1/2 Sheet cake pan (10x15) for a potluck. I was biringing Strawberry shortcake. It turned out perfect. I added Vanilla. I think Lemon Extract would be great as well.

This recipe came out great! i made it for my mom's birthday and she and the family loved it. Its a little sweet for my taste so next time i may cut out some of the sugar but overall i liked it. I also made a few changes like substituting milk for buttermilk and added both vanilla and almond extract.

This is definitely true pound cake.  Came out nice and dense, and perfectly browned.  My oven always seems to take longer on baking, so I baked mine for about 1 1/4 hours.  I also followed the reviews and added 1 1/2 tsp of powdered vanilla.  (I could have added more, it would have taken it nicely).  I mixed the butter and sugar for a loooong time in the food processor ( I don't have a hand mixer) until it was super smooth, then made sure not to overmix when adding the eggs, and finally, I poured everything into a mixing bowl and used a hand whisk to add the flour and milk.  I think it made a world of difference in the texture, so for those who are having texture problems, try it.  The key is to not incorporate too much air after adding the eggs.  Thanks for such an authentic recipe :-D

Very good cake with excellent texture.  Not sure why some didnt like it.  I reduced the quantity of the sugar though, but that's only because I never like my cakes too sweet.  I reduced the sugar by 15%.

absolutely delicious! That cake was wonderfully moist, but dense at the same time.  A true winner :)  Variation: Ginger/lime pound cake: Add 2 tsp. ground ginger to batter. Lime icing: juice of 1 lime, 1 C. powdered sugar, 1 T. milk. whisk together and pour  on luke-warm cake (about 45 minutes out of the oven).

I made this in a bunt pan and for whatever reason, it took FOREVER to bake.  Like twice the amount of time it should have.  I'm still giving this recipe a 5 because although I didn't bake it as directed, the cake itself, is really good.

I made this cake for my nephew's birthday.  I baked it in a 9x13x2" pan.  It came out great!  I even melted some chocolate chips and added that to half the batter to make it a half-chocolate cake.  I also added 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract.  Yum!

FAN.TAS.TIC!! I reduced servings to 10 and made 1 loaf. Followed recipe and ingredients exactly. Did not add anything. Used salted butter. Tastes like my home made shortbread cookies in cake form. Outstanding.

perfect pound cake if you are looking a for good old fashioned pound cake thats dense and moist in a really good way.  I made it many times since I saw it last month and comes out perect everytime. I add 1 tsp vanilla and 11/2 tsp baking powder when i made 6 servings. The recipe makes large number so I always halve it to 6. 

EDIT*
i made it again today Jan 7th 2011, in 30 servings, and substituted milk with whipping cream cuz i had some and wanted to finish it before it spoils and also added 1/2 tsp baking powder and vanilla because i like it to rise a bit.
It was delicious
everyone, from dad to neighbours devoured it

Easy to make and it tasted good, but it came out too fluffy for my tastes.  I was looking for a very firm, dense pound cake, and this was definitely not that.  I followed the recipe exactly except I cut the recipe to make only 10 servings, which was equal to one loaf pan, and I baked it at 325 for only 60 minutes.  It was still too brown for my liking.  If I make it again, I'd bake it for maybe 45-50 minutes.

I halved the recipe to fit a 9x5 loaf pan.This is my first time baking a pound cake and it turned out dense and very heavy, like a brick. Not sure if it is suppose to be like that ,but it was sweet and still tasty with berries. Tasted like shortbread according to my husband.The only difference I would do next time, is baking it for 50min at 325 since 60 min seemed to start burning the sides and the cake had a very thick crust.

Yum... Completely fool proof, I don't bake much so this was as simple as it gets. The family loved it as well. I melted the butter (not knowing that creaming it involves soft butter) and folded all the rest of the ingredients in and it turned out great! It had a crispy buttery top and it was dense, probably because I didn't cream the sugar and butter properly. But it was still delicious... it lasted for 2 days at my home. Thanks for the recipe!
