Although the kugel tasted very good, the noodles, fruit, and cottage cheese never bound together in the way that I think of when I think of kugel. I used whole wheat noodles, but I wouldn't think it would make a difference. Who knows. In any case, I wouldn't make this again and would look for something with more of what I consider to be the traditional kugel consistency.

This kugel didn't hold together (as the other reviewer said) because it has no eggs (possibly mistakenly left out of the recipe). Kugel is basically a noodle pudding or custard, and needs eggs to set.  Otherwise you just get baked cottage cheese and pineapple with noodles.
