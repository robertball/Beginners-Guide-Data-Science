Note from the recipe author -- There is a typo in the recipe.  It should be 1/4tsp of pepper.

This was really good. How can you ever go wrong with potatoes and thyme? I used fresh green beans so I steamed them first. i cooked the potatoes in the broth mixture and then added the green beans when the potatoes were done. I used chicken broth instead and found that i didnt need the starch because the starch from the potatoes thickened it quite well.

The changes I made to this recipe were that I sauteed the potatoes briefly in butter along with some chopped red onion before adding the broth, seasonings and fresh green beans.  I also added some kielbasa chunks to make this a one-skillet meal. Didn't find it necessary to add the cornstarch.

This recipe was easy and I had all the ingredients in the house. It cooked well and even held for a little while when my husband was late. My 16 month old liked it too! It was soft but had chunks. The thyme was tasty.

Just average.  I would recommend adding the beans until potatoes are 1/2 way cooked...ended up looking like goulash.  Needed more flavor, but considering it's a low cal side dish, was just okay and very easy to make.

Good idea... Didn't have everything at home, and was not in the grocery store mood, so changes were made. Turned out great, but wasn't a vegetarian-like dish anymore:
- Recipe was doubled: ...Hungry boys will do that to a recipe anyway
- No fresh parsley: Used some dried seasoning that had mostly parsley in it... to taste...
- No vegetarian Worcestershire: Used the regular stuff
- No vegetable broth: Used 1 cup beef broth and 1 cup french onion soup (I think this was key!!)

Residents and guests alike raved... there was nothing left!

I personally thought it wasn't good at all, and I just put half the pepper it called for and it was WAY too much.  Maybe I made it wrong, but I didn't like it.

This was very good -- next time, I'll cut back on the thyme as it was a little too much for us... or, maybe I'll substitute garlic (we're garlic fanatics!).  

Great side dish!!!

I am giving this one star because it turned out absolutely terrible. No flavor, just gross. And it takes a lot for me to say that. I don't know if I did something wrong, I can't even think of one thing to save this recipe. I won't make this ever again.

These were delicious. They have a good kick from the spices, but my husband and I really enjoyed them. My son wouldn't eat them though.

I've always loved potatoes and green beans together, and the idea of cooking them in thyme, Worcestershire and stock really appealed to me. I used some extra green beans (about another cup), used chicken stock instead of veg broth and regular Worcestershire; otherwise kept to the recipe.  The trick to dishes like these is the cooking time.  You can't take recipe times as gospel, you have to use your judgement based on the size and type of your potatoes and beans.  Don't over cook them.  I didn't add my beans until the potatoes had cooked for about 10 minutes.  Wonderful side dish, but for this to be 6 servings would be tiny servings. I'd say 4 servings is more realistic.

This was pretty good but it took longer to cook...maybe my potato slices weren't thin enough.  The flavors were good and a nice change to my standard green bean uses.  I will make this again.

I substituted soy sauce (I don't have access to vegetarian  Worcestershire sauce) . This made an excellent side dish.

I used potatoes, thyme, and green beans from our garden.  I'm sorry to say it was a waste of time and ingredients.

I made this according to the recipe... It is a refreshing change from the standard "Potato" dishes we have. I found it refreshing ... rather than the normal mashed, baked, steamed or fried potatoes that we normal have. Only reason it didn't get 5 stars was my other diners didn't care for it.

i used worchester sauce, because I couldnt find vegetarian sauce. I also found out the potatoes can cook too long. Its best to cook lesser munutes or tun down lower in required time. You might want to add a little more vegetable broth than required. I agree it should be less pepper( the staff typo)
Overall it taste good:-)

Good and easy. I used 2C. chicken broth instead of the vegetable broth. I threw in some chopped onions. Added extra corn starch to make broth thicker as well as some Mrs. Dash at the end for an extra kick. At 420 calories (by my estimates) and no oil ... this one's a keeper.
