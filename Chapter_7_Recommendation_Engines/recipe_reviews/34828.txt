These green beans were FABULOUS! I absolutely loved them and would rather eat these than the pizza we had tonight! A recipe keeper for sure.  I did make a few slight changes, boiling the green beans for 5 minutes and then shocking them in cold water since I don't have a steamer.  And I left the beans whole, but will probably cut them in half next time! And I did not have red onion so I used white onion and sauteed it (I do not like a heavy onion taste). Also the olive oil and vinegar is way too much in my opinion.  I only used 1/4 cup olive oil and the full amount of vinegar (but red wine instead) and there was a huge puddle at the bottom of my bowl.  Next time, yes there will be a next time for sure, I will use 1/8 cup oil and 2 tbsp red wine vinegar.  Five stars!!

I thought this recipes and the blended flavors were very good, however the next time I make it (and there will be lots of next times), I will not use the olive oil/balsamic vinegar for the dressing.  The blue cheese tends to be strong to the point of overpowering depending on what brand you use, and I felt that the taste of the blue cheese and the balsamic vinegar were "fighting" for supremacy in this salad.  I will use a light Italian, Greek or plain oil and vinegar next time.

This was a great cold side dish for our Thanksgiving dinner.  The only thing I changed was replacing 1 Tbs. of the balsamic vinegar with Apple Cider vinegar.  Will definitely make again!!

To my surprise the flavors complemented one another very nicely.  I did not love this dish but my husband and co-workers did.  It was easy to make, so I will do so again.

BTW - I followed another users advice and just used an Italian dressing that I liked...much easier than the oil ect..

This was a nice way to do beans. My kids loved it I wasnt that rave about it but will make it again as 100% better than just plain old beans.

YUMMY - I increased the blue cheese, only "coated" the beans with oil/balsamic, and replaced pecans with walnuts.  Still good.

This recipe was awesome. The flavor of the blue cheese and balsamic vinegar was very good. I did make a couple of changes though. Because I'm watching the fat in my diet, I eliminated the oil completely and I only had almonds on hand...just as good. I will be making this again!

This salad was pretty good.  However, I agree it would be better to use less oil and vinegar.  I loved the combination of pecans and bleu cheese.

For those who complained there was too much dressing, I suggest that they should just add dressing "to taste" and save the remainder for another salad.

Very nice variety.  Easy to make ahead and serve chilled at a picnic.  I cut back on the pecans a little.

This looked better than it tasted. Some salt should be added while boiling the beans. The concept was good though. Thanks for the recipe.

I altered this one just slightly... I used toasted walnuts rather than pecans because I had them on hand. (But I'm sure either would work fine!) And I used a garlic vinegrette dressing; I didn't measure it though, just poured enough on to coat the beans. Don't over cook the green beans; you want them to have a nice snap to them. I would suggest shocking them in ice water too so they keep a sharp green color. I served this to company last night with Orzo With Parmeasn and Basil, (from this website) and filet mignons. Everyone loved it! I'm always looking for a new type of salad and this one was marvelous! A definite keeper!

A nice change from typical beans.  I boiled the beans until just tender.  Next time I'll add more sliced onion and more blue cheese.  For the dressing I used about 3-4 Tbs. of both the balsamic and olive oil -- it was just enough to coat the beans without puddling in the bottom of the bowl.  I didn't add the nuts (we're allergic).

Very good side salad for a barbecue! As others have stated, there's no need for so much dressing: I only used 2T olive oil and 1T vinegar.

This was a hit for Easter dinner. Made a few modifications based upon other reviewers suggestions, but nothing earth shattering. 1. used feta instead of blue cheese purely on accident 2.  added the vinegar and oil tablespoon by tablespoon until was the right amount...recipe way too much. used equal amounts of each. 3. sauteed the onions and nuts (i used almonds as I had on hand) before adding to salad 4. finally, added some salad seasoning...needed a bit more flavor for my taste 5. added some halved grape tomatoes...add some nice flavor and great color All these changes are pretty superficial though...this is a great recipe all on its own. Loved that you could prepare entirely ahead of time and not worry about it anymore.

Great recipe....I added the blue cheese while the beans were still warm so it melted.  I added some finely chopped portobello mushrooms that had been soaked in balsamic vinegar and chopped some dulce to add minerals and salt flavour.  Agreed one tbsp of olive oil is enough.

I made this today and it was a hit.  I did add about a 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes to the dressing as my family likes a lot of flavor but I think it would have been great without them.

Nice! The oil can be cut WAY back - to 1-2T, but ths is a really tasty combo. I added a little fresh basil and really like Christina's idea of adding tomato so I may try that next time, but this is great as is (minus a lot of the oil - why throw it out?). Thanks for the recipe!

I had some just picked fresh organic green beans and wanted to make something that wouldn't cook out that fresh green bean taste. This recipe was perfect for that. I only steamed the beans for 4 minutes and blanched them in cold water to stop the cooking and kept them a pretty green. Only used 1T of homemade Italian dressing, we're not big fans of oil and vinegar. I did let chill for two hours with the dressing over the beans. Didn't add the toasted pecans until ready to serve. What a nice way to serve fresh green beans.

My husband and I LOVED it.  I used slightly less oil based on what other folks said and used almond slivers b/c that's what I had.  A great way to eat fresh veggies without eating a hot dish in the middle of summer.

Ok, this might be how we eat green beans for the rest of the summer!  This is great, the blue cheese gives such a nice tangy creaminess.  I substituted some things simply because what I had on hand.  Used scallions instead of red onion and almonds instead of pecans. I also cut back on the oil and vinegar.  A little goes a long way.

This is a great dish.  I revised the recipe slightly.  I sparingly coated the beans with oil and used Balsamic spray salad dressing instead of straight Balsamic vinegar. Also, deleted the nuts. Unless you really like your food well salted, suggest you leave it out -  Blue Cheese provides enough salt for the recipe.

I made this for our Memorial Day get together and it was a hit.  I sauteed a sliced Vidalia Onion insteead of the red onion so it would not have too strong a raw onion taste.  Also, I used white balsamic vinegar so it would not  change the color of the green beans, added sliced cherry tomatoes, and served the blue cheese on the side since some in our group don't like it.  I will definitely make this again.

This salad is so seriously delicious!! I had two servings yesterday, and then ate some for breakfast today!  I may try to make them with toasted almonds next time. Loved it even more the next day, but it wasn't as pretty as the balsamic color sort of took away the brightness of the green beans.  I will be making this again and again!

I made this for a party and it was a hit! The only thing I didn't like was the amount of oil at the bottom of the bowl. If I made it again, I would cut it in half.

This was yummy! I used frozen french-style green beans and cooked them as directed on the package and let them cool. I omitted the pecans because I didn't have any and added grape tomatoes, marinated garbanzo beans and some garlic powder. I also reduced the amount of olive oil to make it healthier and was glad I did because I don't think all of that oil was really necessary. I can't wait to try this again with the pecans as I know it will be even better! Thanks for posting. :)

I made this recipe exactly as described and it was yummy but with too much oil.  The 2nd time I made it, I doubled everything but the oil and vinegar.  I have handed out this recipe so many times after our BBQ last week, I ended up just referring everyone to allrecipes.com to find it themselves!!  Permanent addition to my cookbook!

This was great!  I made it for a cookout with my friends and everyone loved it and wanted the recipe.  I doubled the recipe except for the oil and vinegar I only did a single recipe of that and it worked out perfect.  We are having another cookout in 3 weeks and they said you can bring anything you want but if I wanted to bring the green beans again that would be fine with them!

Nice combination of flavors, I was the only one who would eat it though. I probably won't make it again simply because I couldn't eat the entire recipe myself!

This was the most wonderful side dish I've had in quite some time.  I made enough for six and my husband had three helpings!  I've made it twice since I found the recipe and everyone loves it.  The only thing I tweaked was a little less oil & vinegar.  Otherwise, it's a permanent fixture in my own recipe book.  Thanks!

I decided to make this for some company only to realize I didn't have red onion or balsamic vinegar but they were already on their way over!  So, I used malt vinegar and yellow onion instead and hoped for the best.  It was wonderful!  The company loved them and my hubby wants me to make them again SOON.  If it can be this good with the wrong ingredients, I can't wait to try the correct ones!

Great recipe! Had a few changes for what I had on hand. Sauteed the onion in olive oil and used almonds instead of pecans, which I sauteed in olive oil as well, so didn't use anymore oil in recipe. Used Gargonzola cheese instead of blue cheese. Also used apple cider vinegar b/c I did not have basalmic vinegar. After everything- tasted fantastic!!! love it!

This in a one word, FANTASTIC! My husband made this and it was amazing.  So simple, so delicious with wonderful flavors.  I couldn't stop nibbling!  We omitted the pecans, but no worries, this is a wonderful side dish that would compliment any meal.  This is a definite keeper!

This is great!  Steam the green beans until they are done to your liking.  I love balsamic and I love nuts and blue cheese.  We have tried substituting other things for the red onion but believe me, the red onion is the best!  I am not a fan of fresh, steamed green beans so this recipe is perfect for diets or if you just want something healthy!  You must try this recipe.

Making it again right now. Our family doesn't like blue cheese so I used feta. This time I will use less oil and vinegar, too much left in the bottom of the bowl.

Great recipe.  I agree with other reviewers that the amount of oil and vinegar should be cut back.    IF you have leftovers, drain most of the liquid because the vinegar can soften the green beans and the next day, they will be very soft.   Due to my own personal tastes, I used some apple cider vinegar in place of the balsamic.   Next time I make it, I will probably go with a 50/50 split to see how it tastes.  
  Oh, and I added some halved cherry tomatoes, which were a very good addition.

I think I could have steamed my beans about 2 minutes longer. This was really good AND different. I like finding and sharing new recipes. I added 4 slices of thick bacon, diced and cooked. I also added 1-2tsp. Minced garlic with the bacon at the end. Because I was running late, I used Italian dressing. I am a big fan of Bleu Cheese. I will definitely be saving and making this again.

Great recipe; so versatile! But, pour the dressing in judiciously (it makes way too much, in my opinion).  I have also substituted goat cheese for the blue cheese when blue would be too strong for the accompanying entree.  Next time, I may kick up the Italian and add roasted red peppers and olives, while substituting ricotta for the cheese and pine nuts for the pecans.  Thanks for the inspirational recipe.

Love this recipe. Every time I make it people ask for recipe. The only thing I changed was I roast green beans and onions with olive oil and salt and pepper on them. I saw that in a different recipe so tried it and worked great. Then combine and add balsamic per your taste. Great way to do green beans. Thank you for recipe.

If a recipe has blue cheese in it, I'm in!  
Hubby devoured this and I really enjoyed it too, yum!  Really flavorful. I forgot the pecans, but that would be a great addition. Thanks for sharing!

04-28-16 ~ Great salad!  I made a double batch of this for a birthday carry-in at school.  I did cut back on the olive oil.  I just poured some in until it was nicely coated, but not pooled in the bottom of the dish.  I didn't add the cheese as I took a container of bleu cheese and a container of feta cheese so people could put on their choice.  I stirred the pecans in right before serving so they would stay crisp.  Everyone loved this salad.  I kept some at home for our dinner and I loved it with the bleu cheese, hubby enjoyed the feta on his.  This is a great summer salad when you are trying to find a different way to use up green beans.

Such a simple list of ingredients that gave a great punch of flavor to otherwise bland green beans.  Added sun-dried tomatoes and herbed feta (because I had them on hand) Really liked this a lot!

Made this for Fathers Day this year. Added sun gold tomatoes and cherry tomatoes from my garden.  Toasted the pecans with a little olive oil and seasoned salt. Used both blue cheese and feta. Everyone loved it. Safe for diabetics. Toss beans in some of the dressing  &  refrigerate a few hours ahead - then add the rest of the ingredients  for added flavor. Yumm!! The whole family loved it.

My husband loves green beans, but his family opens a can and serves them boiled-to-death again. Oh, no no no!! I steamed the green beans as directed and then put them in a strainer with ice to rapidly cool them. Much faster! Used less oil with basalmic vinegar, added thawed frozen corn and sliced almonds. Delish! I will add this to my "make it often" list, and my husband agrees. I'm so pleased that he can experience something other than plain canned beans.

I made this every year for both Thanksgiving and Easter Potlucks from 2008 to 2012.  Then my best friends mother passed and as this was her favorite dish, I just couldn't bring myself to make it.  Well, here it is 2015 and the old group is coming together once again for a Thanksgiving bash.  I was in tears as I pulled this recipe up.  Thank you Melanie for the wonderful recipe and the great memories it invokes.

I reduced the olive oil to 1/4 cup, the balsamic vinegar to 3 tablespoons, and increased the blue cheese slightly, to about 1/3 cup. I also used walnuts as I didn't have pecans on hand. Plenty of salt with the cheese, so I only added black pepper. Not 5 stars since I had to make those changes, but definitely a good place to start.
