For the person who wondered why their doughnuts didn't rise... this recipe isn't very specific about the temperature of the liquid to be mixed into the yeast/flour mixture. The instruction "until butter melts" could end up with the liquid too hot and that will kill the yeast. Use an instant read or candy thermometer and check that the liquid is at around 120째F-130째F for "rapid rise" active dry yeast 110째F-115째F for regular active dry yeast.

This is a good recipe for anyone wanting to make donuts similar to your local donuts shop. They are not cake donuts and if they turn out like that, then you didn't make them correctly. I recommend microwaving the milk, butter & sugar one minute or until luke-warm to avoid killing the yeast when you add it to your dry ingredients. You may need to let the doughnuts rise longer than the recipe calls for. Also make sure that you are using good yeast that hasn't expired. It's all about the rise and that they are cooked properly. I recommend using a thermostat controlled deep fryer to accurately fry these doughnuts just a little bit past golden brown. Let them cool down before you coat them. They are excellent with glaze, powdered sugar & various flavors of cake icing.

This is my favorite recipe so far and I have gotten a lot of compliments on this recipe and everyone has asked me for it that has tasted the doughnuts. I did dissolve the yeast in 1/4 cup of lukewarm water instead of using a mixer, you may have to increase the flour if you use this method, and let rise till double, then shape or cut, then let rise again. I also used a glaze of 3 cups powdered sugar, and 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla, and 3-4 tablespoons milk.

Very good. I probably could have let them rise a bit longer to make them fluffier, though- the next day they were a bit hard already. I used the suggestion of using confectioner sugar and milk to make an icing, but I also used about half confectioner sugar, half chocolate milk mix. I only wish I had waited until the doughnuts were cool before dipping them into the icing, because the icing melted on them right away, covering the overall doughnut rather than making a nice-looking icing. Overall, very satisfying.

Great recipe it's very similar to one I have been using for years. A tip for first timers: the side that you have facing up while rising turn them over and deep fry that side down first and it will help the doughnuts rise better and they wont turn out as cake like.

These were delicious! You've got to try these! Smelling them cook was almost as good as eating them. I coated some with cinnamon sugar in a ziploc bag, and dipped the rest in glaze. YUMMY! My son wants me to make a batch for his 1st grade class at school. I would suggest just a variety of doughnut holes for that.

I followed directions perfectly and waited 3 hours for the dough to rise. Never did. Will throw this recipe out. Never will try this one again. It does not even rate a 1 star.

These tasted pretty good but I wish that they had risen better. Unlike suggested by other reviewers, the milk and butter mixture was not too hot causing yeast death and I allowed them to rise for double the time required once rolled out and they still did not rise enough. They did puff a bit more in the oil but they were a little heavier than I would have liked.  I was looking for a very light-textured puffy doughnut and this was not it.  My kids liked the taste though and loved rolling them in cinnamon sugar and dipping them into chocolate glaze; so if I can't find a perfect light and puffy doughnut recipe we will make these again.

I really had high hopes for this recipe, but I think you've really got to have a good feel for bread making to get this one right. I do ok with bread, but I'm not amazing at it. Like several others, I had serious problems with the dough rising properly. It took me three tries and letting it sit out over night to finally get it to rise. I am sure I killed the yeast the 1st time. I was careful to temp the milk-sugar-butter mix the 2nd time, but it did not work. After that, I tested my yeast and my thermometer to make sure that was not the issue. The 3rd time, I was very very careful with the temp of the milk mixture, and finally after letting it sit out all night, it did rise, but not well. The resulting doughnuts were dense and difficult to fry with out burning, but they tasted alright. Not amazing by any means, but good, especially with a sugar glaze. I do not plan on using this recipe again.

The first time I used this recipe I found them delicious, however they did not rise well.  So the second time, I did the milk, yeast, and sugar together then followed the recipe.  They were much better.  Instead of dusting I made a choc glaze and a vanilla glaze.

Me and my family live in Chile and sell these doughnuts to the public. It did take a little getting used to, the first couple times we made them they were rather hard and un-risen, but now they are just as fluffy as store-bought. I strongly suggest this recipe.

I couldn't get the dough to rise so these didn't make very good donuts.  But what I came up with when I was done was a very good tasting "pretzel".

Not quite what I wanted in a doughnut.  I was looking for a lighter, less bready texture, and definitely a little sweeter.  I'll keep looking.  Not bad, just not my doughnut.

I'm pretty sure I'm done trying different doughnut recipes. This one turned out just how I like them. I put a basic glaze on them and sprinkled my left over holiday sprinkles on them for the kids.

I followed the direction to a T and they tasted more like cake doughnuts. They weren't soft and and chewy in the inside they were more cake like. My husband liked them as for me I like the taste of actual yeast doughnuts.

Great tasting! The dough needs to rise twice so be sure to plan ahead.  These were very easy to make.

There are several reasons why this might be tricky: using yeast always is. The disasters some have noted almost certainly occurred because the yeast was dead (stale). It might be advisable to proof the yeast before making the recipe: dead yeast will never leaven anything. Also, if one wishes a fluffier or lighter doughnut, don't bat the dough down completely: fluffier dough means a fluffier outcome.  I must say I make this with sugar substitutes (being diabetic): xylitol or Diabetisweet (an Isomalt product) works fine: indeed, xylitol can be bought in powdered "confectioners'" form.  It also helps to add some "nonbulk" sugar substitute also, Splenda (Sucralose) being preferred, in addition to the xylitol or Diabetisweet (which should replace granular and confectioners' sugar on a one-to-one basis): I would suggest four or five packets per recipe.
Keeping your yeast alive and happy till baking is, I would say, key.

Gotta bring this one down a notch.  I've made them twice, and they came out dense and dry.  I think the yeast may be mixed in wrong.  I would try activating it with the sugar next time, and maybe using half the egg.

My husband made your yeast doughnuts recipe and the dough did not raise.  He said he followed the recipe and the yeast was just purchased a few days ago and was fresh.  We are wondering what went wrong.

I had to watch them very carefully when I was cooking as they went brown very quickly, but these were yummy. Some with a blob of jam in the centre were yummier still.

My first try at doughnuts and I was worried because the dough didn't rise as expected but they came our pretty good.  I made a second batch and tested the temperature of the milk to make sure it wasn't too hot.  Everybody loves them.  I didn't put a hole and filled them with canned lemon pie filling and topped with glaze.  I haven't fried the second batch yet.

Made these. When using the oil, always fry in small batches (4max) to ensure they cook evenly. When they come out, place them on a wire rack to get the oil off.
