After reading WAY TOO MANY reviews, here is what I did and it came out PERFECT!!!  6 eggs, 2 cups half and half (no milk), 2 tsp vanilla and 1/4 tsp of cinnamon, soaked overnight, let sit out while oven preheated and turned each piece over, baked covered with foil for 20 minutes, poured sauce over the top and baked uncovered for the remaining 20 minutes. FANTASTIC!!!  Kids and grown-ups ate it all up.  Served with fresh melon.  This will be our new Christmas morning breakfast!!!

I wanted to make this for guest over the weekend but was a litle put off by all the mixed reviews.
I decided to vary the recipe with a combination of reviewers ideas.  Here's what I did to achieve a great recipe that my guests really enjoyed. 
Used only 6 eggs, 1 1/4 cups of milk and 1 cup of cream. Used a larger dish. Let rest overnight and turned the bread over after a couple of hours.  Baked in the oven and when the top had gone a crunchy brown (not too dark) I removed and turned all the bread over and popped back in for about 15 minutes.  This then allowed the egg mixture to puff up in the oven and dry out slightly.
We didn't find this soggy at all and my guests requested the recipe.  Hubby wants me to make this again, so I guess that says it all.

I've made this for years...tips - 3/4 cup milk, 3/4 cup half & half, 7 eggs...I always cut the slices almost 2" thick...I put 14 slices in the 9x13 pan...When cooking this - I cook for half the time and then turn each piece over - comes out Great and seems to eliminate the "extra soggy" center....

Before making this dish, I read the reviews... Wished I hadn't! The dish is fine the way it is, and I would have enjoyed the taste better, not wondering what it would have been like if I used less liquid. This is a casserole dish, more like bread pudding is accurate, not like traditional french toast. You have to squeeze the bread in the 9x13 dish... but can be done eazily. My suggestion to you is to try it the way it is intented... then try it other ways too. Make sure that your oven is giving you an accurate temp., as you will under cook if not. This is a good base recipe... I find that you can make this recipe fit you needs for taste, which is why I gave it 5 stars. If you like less liquid you can do it, less sweet can be done too. This is a recipe that you can make yours! But keep in mind that if you are reading the reviews, you may be disappointed with the intial taste... Serve it to someone that hasn't read the reviews and see what they have to say. Thanks Laura for sharing!

This was delicious, but mainly because I made the modifications made by other reviewers. I did 6 eggs and 1 c. milk and 1 c. half and half. I also added a lot more cinnamon, just my personal pref. In order to get my bread just right, I sliced it and then put it in the oven at 200 to dry it out a bit, flipping once while in there. I think that helped a lot, as would slicing it and letting it get stale on its own. I then cut each thick slice of French bread into 4 pieces. 

In the morning, I flipped all the pieces about 2-3 hours before it went into the oven. There were a few pieces of bread that were dry (maybe b/c I used a little more bread than called for by accident), so I did up a little more of the egg and cream mixture and just drenched the dry ones. I put it in the oven covered for about 25 minutes and then removed the foil and poured the caramel mixture over (used maple syrup instead of corn syrup which gave it great flavor). 

This was for a brunch for about 15 ladies and it was a hit! Many requested the recipe. I found the texture was perfect, crispy on top, but not hard. Yet still moist. The flavor was great, not too sweet as others had said. I really labored over all the previous reviews because so many had issues w/ it being soggy, but I will for sure make this again with the changes.

(I did double this recipe and serve in a chafing dish, and it held up really well to being kept warm for about 2-3 hours. And it smelled delicious all the while).

I love this recipe!!  I've made it 5 times in the last 2 months and every time I serve it it's a big hit!  I do only use 6 eggs and 1 cup of milk, though, otherwise it's too mushy in the middle.  Make sure and slice your bread AT LEAST 1" thick -- even a little thicker than 1" is best so that the liquid can be absorbed into the bread rather than staying on the bottom of the dish.  Definitely sprinkle w/ toasted pecans!  Very yummy!

(I'm shouting here)YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE TO READ REVIEWS TO FIX A RECIPE!!!!!  I thought, being this recipe had over 230 reviews and rated 4 star average that I would be just fine!  It ruined my Christmas breakfast!!  Usually reviews give you ideas on enhancing, not fixing.  Next time, I'll be more careful.  This was soggy and looked like the eggs you pass up on the buffets!  The top tasted great, but the bottom looked so bad, I couldn't eat it.  I will search for another recipe next year.

You cannot try any recipe on this site without first READING THE REVIEWS. Others that have tried it will give you tips to make it better. This recipe is GREAT but you have to reduce the liquids or it will be mush. When the liquid is reduced  it come out PERFECT.DO NOT PASS THIS ONE UP!!!!!

This is an awesome recipe!! I made this for my sunday school class and everyone just loved it. I think it's important to use very dense or day old french bread not fresh. I sliced the bread in one inch slices. I took heed from the other reviewers and instead of pouring the mixture over the bread sliced in the pan, I dipped them and placed in the pan. I took the excess liquid and spooned in into the center of each slice and covered and left in the fridge overnight. I cooked the next morning until the pieces were lightly browned on top and had no problem with mushy bread, the toast was firm and delicious. I will definitely make again...thanks for a wonderful recipe!! :)

This was delicious!  I used an oval-shaped loaf of "rustic" looking whole wheat bread, cut into slices a little larger than 1 inch.  Used all the milk (used skim), eggs and cream, and the bread soaked it right up!  (I was worried it wouldn't, because it is almost 4 cups of liquid!).  Sprinkled extra cinnamon on top.  Used only 1/2 cup plus 1-2 TBS. of butter, and maple syrup instead of corn syrup.  It was so good but so filling!  We have a lot leftover.  I baked it covered for 40 minutes, then uncovered for 15 until it didn't look so "wet" anymore.  Served with fresh fruit.  I also love "Grandma's Peach French Toast" from this site but it's hard to say which one is better now.

First off I want to say that I liked the recipe as shown. The amount of custard you need to use it going to change depending on how moist your bread is. That is why I prepare it this way... I slice the bread the morning before I want to prepare the dish and leave it on the counter to get stale. When I get home from work I make the custard and  pour 1/2 into the casserole and then place the bread on top of it. Then I cover and refrigerate it until the bread takes all of the custard (about 1-2 hours). Then I flip the bread over and pour 1/2 the remaining custard over top. Right before bed, I check it to see if I need to add the rest of the custard. When cooking it there shouldn't be much (if any) custard on the bottom of the dish. Pour the sauce on with 10 minutes left and boost the heat to 400. Crispy outside and like the best creme brulee on the inside. Remember guys baking times change with the outside humidity and temperature (and stop opening the oven door).

I would give this 10 stars, if I could!  Everyone raved over this!!  I took the advice of another reviewer (Michelle Mullis) :   used   6 eggs, 2 cups half and half (no milk), 2 tsp vanilla and 1/4 tsp of cinnamon, soaked overnight, let sit out while oven preheated and turned each piece over, baked covered with foil for 20 minutes, poured sauce over the top and baked uncovered for the remaining 20 minutes. This was PERFECT!  Thank you for sharing your recipe and giving us a new Christmas breakfast tradition.

This is my third time making this recipe and it surely won’t be my last.  This time it came out a little on the soggy side even though I drained out most of the egg mixture.  Still, it tasted delicious.  Next time I will be sure to flip the bread after a couple of hours and drain all remaining liquid before baking.    I love the sticky buttery topping.  Make sure not to skip this step.  You really don’t have to warm the butter on the stove.  You can let the butter get to room temper and then blend the topping without heat.  Then spread the topping on before you bake it.   If you are trying this for the first time and you and not completely happy with the results then try again.  I promise you it is worth it.  This recipe is simple and yummy.  I think that each time you make it you have to adjust the amount of liquid depending on the size of eggs you use and the freshness and size of the loaf of bread.  Since these variables greatly impact the outcome I do not think it is fair to grade the recipe based on consistency since it is likely that no two attempts will turn out the same.

Delicious!  I used a "day-old" French bread loaf from the grocery store bakery -- I think you probably shouldn't use very fresh or soft bread for this one -- and sliced it very thick.  (Still needed a HUGE pan.)  I followed other reviewers' advice and cut back the eggs (six) and milk/cream (a cup each), and dipped the bread before putting it in the pan.  Pour the rest of the liquid over -- I didn't think it would all soak up but it really did!  The syrup mixture produces a lightly crunchy top that even holds up for leftovers.  I don't think it would turn out if you covered it.  I meant, but forgot, to add chopped pecans as another reviewer suggested -- maybe next time.  Whatever you do, though, don't forget to spray the pan before you start!    Thanks, Laura!

This was GREAT!  I did follow some of the other reviewers suggestions and cut back the eggs to 6 and only used 1 1/2 cups of half and half. After I buttered the 9 X 13 pan, I dipped each slice of bread into the egg mixture and layered the pan with 2 layers of bread.  I poured the left-over egg mixture over top and put in the refrigerator overnight. In the morning I melted the butter, brown sugar and corn syrup and poured it over the bread and baked for about 40 mins. until it was a little crispy on top. I also added pecans to 1/2 of it. It was not mushy at all. Tasted like sticky bun french toast!!!! Delicious!!!!!

The first time I made this, I didn't read the reviews to half the liquids.  Although it was a distaster, it smelled so good, I tried again.  This time, I followed previous reviews.  IT STILL DIDN'T TURN OUT!! I cannot tell you how bummed I am about it.  The bread was soggy and ended up throwing it away both times.  Unfortunately, I won't try it a third time for fear of another disaster and waste of food. The amount of ingrediants (or the instructions?) aren't right but I would love to see a recipe like this that is. My house smelled good for hours.

First. Use only 6 eggs, 1 cup of milk and 1 cup of half and half.  Ditch the corn syrup (why would you use that anyway?) and add 1/4 to 1/2 cup of pure maple syrup to the butter and brown sugar mixture.  I add a bit more vanilla and cinnamon. I've made this every Christmas for the past few years.

This is very close to Paula Deen's baked French toast recipe, and, as written, is only OK. There was way too much liquid and it just didn't cook through well (results were mushy, although very sugary which enticed kids to eat it). BUT if you follow the suggestions by most of the reviewers, this can be amazing. You MUST cut down liquid to 6 eggs and 1.5 C half-and-half/milk. You will very likely need more than one loaf of bread, and slices should be 1.5-2" thick. Cut the bread and let it dry out overnight before soaking it in the egg/milk mixture. Other great suggestions (and I think they are essential to this turning out well) are (1) to cover the dish for the first 30 min (ensures even baking), then uncovered for another 20-30 min; (2) flip the pieces when you go from covered to uncovered; and (3) put on the sauce after you flip the pieces, just before you put back in oven to bake uncovered. Other more minor things that I followed was to replace the corn syrup in the sauce with maple syrup (I did not have corn syrup), add nuts to the sauce (pecans or walnuts are lovely), and I didn't bother with pre-heating the sauce, I just used the heat from the toast to get warm and spreadable. Following the major tips from the reviewers will result in a 6 star dish. My dp does not like sweets, but he LOVED this. Ate almost half the pan himself! And he's already requesting it again! Can't say I don't mind...this was delicious.

I made this recipe for our Easter brunch and everybody absolutely LOVED it!  It's already been requested that I make it for our Mother's Day brunch as well!  I read through all of the reviews and modified the recipe slightly, using 1 less egg and only 1 and 1/2 cups of skim milk.  I also used fat free half&half.  I used an entire teaspoon of cinnamon and a full tablespoon of vanilla to give it a little more flavor.  For the carmel sauce topping I used 1/2 cup of butter and 1 cup of brown sugar with 3 teaspoons of maple syrup and there was more than enough of that to cover the entire dish!  I used a baguette and sliced it a little over 1" thick, I turned the bread over halfway through the soaking to make sure that everything got absorbed.  I also made a triple berry sauce that I served warm on the side.  Definitely a hit!!  Very yummy!

This was just delicious.  Based on other reviews, I did leave out the milk and just used the eggs and half and half.  It turned out perfectly.

Made this for a church brunch and amid all the egg & sausage/ham/etc casseroles, it really had a place of its own. Like most readers, I used 6 eggs and cut the milk/half & half combo to about 2 cups total. My advice: if you want a more "custard-y" texture, follow the recipe & if you want a "french toast-y" texture, reduce the milk & eggs. I tried another reader's suggestion to use maple syrup instead of corn syrup in the topping and that also adds to the "french toast-y-ness." This is a really good change of pace breakfast or brunch dish! I can't wait to try it with the raisin bread!

This recipe definitely needed some tweaking. I used 6 eggs, 1 c. milk, and cut out the topping entirely. The trick is that you have to use the whole 1 lb. of bread - any less and it's much too custard-like. Slice the bread and put it on a cookie sheet for 15 min. in a 300 deg. F. oven - this will dry out the bread (if you're not using stale bread). Now dump it all in the pan (don't worry about getting it to fit in the bottom of the pan) and pour the liquids over it (beat the eggs very well!). At that point, you can squish all the bread into the bottom of the pan and make sure all of the bread is soaked equally. Bake for about 50 min. and serve with syrup. Yum.

I don't get all the reviews saying that they couldn't fit a 1 lb. loaf of bread in one layer in a 9x13 pan, or that there was too much liquid.  I've made this several times for groups of people (work, family gathering, etc).  It gets rave reviews and recipe requests every time.  I love that it practically falls apart as you eat, the smell is delicious, and it tastes wonderful!  I'll continue to use this recipe for my special occasion breakfasts and brunches!

I made the following modifications based on prior reviews:  reduced to 6 eggs, 1 cup milk and 1 cup half-and-half, 1 cup brown sugar and 3 T maple syrup (instead of corn syrup, added chopped pecans and baked for 50 minutes.  It turned out perfectly crisp on the top and creamy on the bottom.  It says a pan serves 12 but I did two 9x13, to feed 13 adults and kids and there wasn't a thing left.  So simple and delicious!

I made a few changes to allow for what I had on hand. No cream, just 2 cups whole milk. Used a 1-lb Challah (braided egg bread) instead of French bread (it absorbs the liquid perfectly). Also added 2 peeled, chopped Granny Smith apples.

My husband says "this is the best French toast in the history of French toast!"

I was so disappointed with this recipe.  It was way to soggy in the middle and bottom and we ended up throwing it away.  My son hated it as well.Husband just ate it to try and make me happy.  Once he saw that I couldn't eat it he stopped.  I followed this recipe to a T and was so excited about it the night before only to be very disappointed the next morning.  I don't know maybe if you don't make the night before???

As with most recipes I use I "tweeked" this one a bit. I usually add a few tablespoons of sugar to the egg mix and serve this with whipped cinnamon butter and real maple syrup instead of baking it with the brown sugar syrup mixture. I also bake it in a single layer in a large sheet pan so that all of the pieces are equally crispy. A pretty good basic recipe that takes all of the work out of French Toast!

this is a good dish and easy to make.  I listened to all other reviews and used 6 eggs and 1 cup of milk.  I also cooked it for about 1 hour.  It turned out great.  Will probably make again.

I own Harrison House B&B in Columbus Ohio. I have tried many French Toast recipes..and this is the BEST. I have made some minor alterations to the recipe but overall it is the same. My guests rave about this dish, never leave any on their plates and ask for copies. I gladly send them the link.

This is so good, I made it for a Church Breakfast and everyone was saying, Who made this? My husband said it was the best french toast he had ever had.  The only changes I made were that I only used 6 eggs and one cup of milk and one cup of half and half.  Thanks for the recipe!

I have made this twice for my family.  I halve the recipe and put it in an 8x8 baking dish.  I use 3 eggs, 1/2 cup milk, and scale back the half and half a bit, too.  The next time I make it I am going to try pouring out the excess liquid before I bake it, and "swirl" the syrup on because it is VERY sweet with it poured all over the top.  I also bake it for 50 minutes.  Very easy...I do recommend it!

I make this for my family at least once a month. It's perfect as written.  If you want less "custardy" bread, don't use fresh, soft bread - let it get stale a day or two and toughen up.  If your slices are submerged,  they will be more "custardy" just cut them thicker to prevent this if you like.

Absolutely divine! This has been our family's Christmas brunch dish for several years. I make it exactly according to the recipe (including the suggestion to sprinkle chopped pecans on top) and it turns out perfect every time. And it's so easy and convenient to prepare!

For those reviewers who didn't like that it was "mushy": 
1) I use day-old bread (which I just noticed is not listed in the recipe) - but I know to always use that for breakfast casseroles that are soaked in eggs and milk so I've never used fresh bread. I can see how using fresh, moist bread would make it turn out mushy.
2) Not sure if this applies to anyone, but if you're wanting something that's more like regular French toast that's fried on a griddle and has a firm texture (but has the convenience of being baked in an oven), this isn't it. It's more like a super-moist bread pudding with a caramelized topping...which is what I expected and therefore was delighted with the results.

A true 5 star recipe is one you do not have to tweak in several areas.  It is not just a matter of taste, but does the recipe correctly instruct you toward perfectly proporioned ingredients that gives you a truly delicious dish.  This one DEFINITELY does not do that.  I had a soggy mess!  I tried to pour the excess liquid off just to lose the shape of my bread.  It was so soggy the bread could not hold together and some of it fell into the sink along with the excess mixture.  You will get no crispness from the bread if you pour the brown sugar mixture over the top at the beginning.  I baked it for 20 minutes and then added the brown sugar mixture.  I am totally disappointed in this recipe.  I spent in excess of 30.00 on this just to find neither my husband nor I liked it!  If I had wanted bread pudding for breakfast, which is what it was somewhat like, I would have looked up bread pudding.  Whoever heard of eating bread pudding for breakfast anyway?? Make at your own risk is all I can say!

My boyfriend and I *loved* this recipe.  So quick to put together the night before.  And it's easy to control (with the baking time) how crunchy you want the french toast.  I soaked the bread in the milk/cream mixture all night and then spilled out the excess in the morning.

This was fantastic.  I made it for a church brunch and everyone loved it and many people asked for the recipe.  The butter, brown sugar, and corn syrup (I used dark since that is what I had on hand) made it so yummy.  It reminded me of those gooey carment rolls with that stuff on top.  I would recommend flipping the french toast over both while it is sitting overnight and 20 minutes into baking it.

This was one of the dishes I made for a baby shower brunch, and it was the first dish to disappear.  I gave out several copies of the recipe.  The french bread really soaks up the egg mixture overnight and nearly doubles in size.  I used maple syrup instead of corn syrup, and it tasted great.  Just a classic, moist, delicious french toast.

Looked good, smelled good, but tasted like cinnamon scrambled eggs.  Very soggy and mushy and I baked it longer because it still looked very wobbly after 40 minutes.  The only reason I gave 2 stars is because the outside crust of the bread was a little crispier and stood up to the egg bath. Would not make again, sorry.

This is a delicious recipe. I wanted to make it for a Easter brunch and tried it before hand. I also read the reviews and used 6 eggs and only one cup of milk, I also dipped the bread and spooned the extra over the bread in the morning. It turned out wonderful. I think most people expect french toast to be more bready when they make it at home. I know most restaurant french toast is a bit more soggy. So if you like a very custard-like french toast then follow the recipe as is and if you would prefer a breadier french toast make some of the changes suggested.

This recipe was grrrreat!! I made this based off of Michelle Mullis' review...her version was perfect. There are a lot of reviews on this recipes and it makes the reader hesistant to try this. Nevertheless I made this for Easter brunch and it was really good. Nice a fluffy and different from the mundane eggs and bacon...thanks for sharing!

As other reviewers suggested, I used 6 eggs, 1 c. milk and 1 c. cream.  I also cubed the french bread into 1" chunks (I couldn't fit all the slices in the pan) and quickly dipped them in the egg/milk mixture, placed them in the pan, and then poured the remaining mixture over. I made the brown sugar sauce as directed, but it seemed like too much, so I only poured 3/4 of the sauce over the casserole before baking.  It turned out beautifully, but it was too sweet for my taste (and I like sweet stuff!!) so next time I will only make a half recipe of the brown sugar sauce.  Definite keeper with these modifications, and I will be serving this at the next brunch that I host, accompanied by fried potatoes, bacon or sausages, and a fruit salad.

This is wonderful! I make it for every special occassion. Christmas morning, Easter morning, husbands birthday, etc. I do have to say I don't use all of the "sauce" when I prepare it the night before. It depends on the bread. True french bread is needed to get that crispiness.

Amazing!   I have to admit was a bit worried after reading some of the reviews, but in the end it was great.  I will say that this recipe is less like "french toast" and more like a french toast casserole.  Here are the changes I made:  I used all the eggs but only a total of two cups of milk and 1/2 and 1/2.  I added two tablespoons of flour (from another top  French Toast recipe on this site), and about 1tbs of sugar.  I used regular store sliced french bread that I dried out in the oven at 200degrees to age it a bit. I layed the bread flat and alternated direction on each layer for a total of 3 layers.  I poured about 80% of the liquid over the bread and then after about 5min I TRANSFERED it to another very well buttered dish in the same layered style.  This moved the dryer slices to the bottom and put the really soaked ones one top.  Then I poured the rest of the liquid over the bread.  I let is sit for a minute, rotated the pan around to help spread it around and then poured off probably about 1/4c. of extra liquid.  For the topping, I mixed 2 sticks of butter, 1cup brown sugar, 1-2 table spoons maple syrup, 1 cup chopped pecans, and a dash of cinnamon.  Spread that over the top and baked coverd for 20min, and then uncovererd for another 40 checking to be sure it was cooked and NOT mushy in side.  The result was a semi-firm pillow of deliciousness with a carmelized topping and sugary-crispy sides!!  TO DIE FOR!!

Made this for breakfast for Christmas morning and it was fabulous! I did add a pinch of salt but the rest of the recipe was perfect. I might try next time cutting the bread into cubes and making more of a casserole but my very picky family raved about this!

Everyone loved this recipe.  I would recommend pouring out the excess liquid before you actually put the french toast in the oven.

wow...this recipe is SO good. I have made it for my family twice now. Its a big hit. I made a few variations per other reviews-I dipped the bread into the mixture and then placed it into the buttered dish. I added pecans and it was delicious!

I made this for Mother's Day brunch this year and it was a huge hit. After reading some of the reviews I used 6 eggs instead of 8, 1 1/4 cup of milk, and 1 cup of half and half. I also used a 1/2 cup of butter, 1 cup of brown sugar, and substituted maple syrup for corn syrup. It came out rich and fluffy and perfectly toasted on the top. Everyone loved it and both my mom and my bf's mom asked for the recipe. I even got high complements from my mom's bf...he doesn't even like french toast and he called it "outstanding". I'm definitely keeping this recipe for special occasions.

I've been following this recipe for about 2 years now.  My husband and I perfected our variation in two different forms.  We had a destination wedding and served it everyone, the morning everyone left for home!  1) Use all half & half, instead of milk & half & half.  Yes it is higher in fat, but as an indulgence, you cannot beat it.  2) Around holiday time, substitute the half & half with custard eggnong (store bought or homemade)

When baking.  Let the dish rest at room temperature when the oven is pre-heating.  Bake, lightly covered with foil for the first 20 minutes.  Then cover with caramel glaze.  ANd finish baking uncovered.

Simply divine!!!
P.S. If you do not have corn syrup, maple syrup will do in a pinch.  Don't let that stop you from making this delicious recipe!

Made this for a brunch - I was a little nervous to try a new recipe with guests but it turned out wonderful.  Got many rave reviews.  I follows others' advice and used only 6 eggs and 1 cup milk.  I also used maple syrup instead of corn syrup in the sauce.  Very delicious!  Will definitely make again.

Great recipe with some modifications.  I like to make it the day of.  To make the day of use 2 french baguette cut it 2 inch slices  Dip them really well into the egg mixture.  Place them in the baking dish then spoon more egg mixture into the center on the bread pieces.  Add the topping as usual.  Do not turn the bread during baking, they look much nicer with out flipping.  Great recipe and quite attractive to serve!

I loved this recipe. It is so nice to put this together the night before and just simply pop it in the oven in the am. Mine puffed up and was crispy and moist. I loved it! I will most def make it again and maybe add a few extra things next time.

Yum, yum, yum! These turned out like caramel sticky buns. After reading many of the reviews, I decided to cut down the liquid to 2 cups (1/2 c half-n-half and 1 1/2 c milk) and cut the eggs down to 6. I did manage to get almost a whole pound of french bread in a 9x13 by cutting smaller pieces and stuffing them in the holes left by the bigger pieces. I also cut down the brown sugar to 1 cup and used maple syrup (per reviews) instead of corn syrup and was glad I did. Last thing I did was sprinkle sliced almonds over the top and baked for 50 minutes. Next time I'll use pecans for the sticky bun effect. As I read over this I realize I changed the whole recipe but the bottom line is that these were really good. I didn't have any trouble with mine being too soggy but if you're looking for crisp baked french toast, this isn't it. It is definitely moist. We loved it!

Okay, after reading reviews I changed it a little bit and this stuff turned out great!

I used normal wheat bread "that is all I had"  I mixed up 2 eggs, one cup of milk 2 teaspoons of Vanilla one teaspoon of nutmeg some cinnamon, and 3 tablespoons of brown sugar.  Double layered the bread in a small pan, soaked up the liquid with the bread completely; I let it sit in the fridge for 2 hours.  The Glaze, I made only a half of cup of brown sugar some butter, maple syrup, and some pecans.  Cooked in the oven for 40 mins.  Crunchy on the top and not soggy at all.  Loved it. Served with some butter and some warm syrup.  Will make again!! Yummy.  The key is not too much liquid.

This is a great recipe for a sweet bread pudding, if you bake it a little longer and fry it in a pan for a bit.  I was hoping for french toast.  French toast is crispy NOT mushy.  A big let down

I was so disappointed with this recipe. I served it at my Christmas Day brunch and it was awful. The bread was soggy in the middle and too crunchy on the outside. I shared the recipe with a co-worker and she had the same results. I am shocked at the rating this recipe received because it was the biggest flop I've ever tried to serve. Thank goodness my guests had been served lots of champagne!!!

I scaled the recipe by half and baked it in an 8" square pan. If you halve the recipe, you will only need THREE eggs and 1/2 cup of milk. It made two large stand-alone servings, but would probably serve four if you were serving it as part of a larger meal (i.e., eggs, fresh fruit, ham/bacon/sausage or meat alternative, etc.) As mentioned by another reviewer, be sure the bread is cut to 1" thickness or slightly larger. I didn't have light syrup, only dark, but it turned out wonderfully anyway. Oh! And consider setting a cookie sheet on the next rack below the dish, as the syrup may bubble over the sides of the dish! :) DEEE-LICIOUS. Thanks for submitting this, Laura.

Very good and similar to bread pudding.  After reading the reviews, I limited the amount of liquids (by pouring out excess).  Next time, I may leave a little for added moistness.

This is a great recipe left alone. I think the confusion is that people are using French Bread from the bakery. I used a 1 pound(16oz) loaf of Franz French Bread from the bread isle at the grocery store. I think we cannot actually tell how much bread is in one loaf from the bakery. I cut the slices of bread each diagonally, this arranged much easier in the pan and allows the bread to soak up the mixture better and bakes nicer and evenly. I did Not have to flip over the bread every 20 min. The Baked French Toast turned out absolutely Wonderful this way. :)

As is, this recipe is excellent.  A few important points to be stated.  First, a nice dense French bread must be used for it to hold its shape and it must be left overnight to have time to absorb the liquids.  It should also be allowed to come to room temperature before baking.  This recipe is meant to have a bread pudding consistency and I have even made it by cubing the bread and adding apple chunks, cranberries and raisins.  Awesome dessert.  I think what most reviewers are looking for from a consistency standpoint based on the modifications/reviews I've read  is "Overnight French Toast, found in Company's Coming Christmas Edition".  I've made this for years for Christmas morning.  It is the number 1 request from the extended family that comes to brunch.  It doesn't use the sweet sauce poured over it.  Instead, I serve it with pure maple syrup, or warmed apple, peach and/or strawberry preserves.

Oh, wow. This was amazing. Thank you so much for this delicious recipe! I did take the advice of another user and cut the amount of eggs to 6 and used 2 cups of half and half (no milk). I added more cinn, but that's a personal preference. I also cooked it in the oven for 20 minutes with foil and 20 mins without the foil. 
I will note I made the mistake of using a smaller baking dish and I do not recommend this because some of the bread will have a difficult time (or no time) soaking up the liquid. It was still delicious though. Thanks so much for a great recipe, I will be making this often.

I have made this a few times at Christmas and family get together. I have the recipe memorized and it is a definite hit and really easy and filling. I have learned that Half & Half really isn't necessary and if I don't already have it in the house, and I usually never do, I just go ahead and use milk and it turns out just the same. I also like to use a little nutmeg and allspice in the egg mixture to make it a little less bland. One important tip is to flip the bread over in the egg mixture either a few hours before you plan on cooking it or a few hours after you put it in the fridge, otherwise one side tends to be more soggy then the other.

I read the reviews and made the recipe WITHOUT changing the measurements to see  how it actually turns out.  Perfect!  Did it again also without changing anything - each time it was perfect.

I brought it to a brunch and everyone asked for the recipe.   I was worried about the soggy middle, dry tops and the amount of syrup mentioned in the reviews.  No problems!  The way to make sure it does not get soggy in the middle or too dry on the top is:

1- flip the bread slices before baking (make sure your slices are 1 inch, too thin otherwise it will definitely be soggy).  I used day old french bread, fresh bread is too soft and will get soggy as well.
2- bake way longer, I think I did 50-55 mins.  It gets a nice crunchy top (just watch towards the end so it doesn't burn) and the middle gets cooked longer - no soggy middle!
3- then let it rest before serving, somehow that makes a difference.

I used maple syrup just because I prefer not to use corn syrup - gave it a nice breakfasty smell.  Didn't have cream and used all milk.  Too  yummy with eggs and bacon, quiche, breakfast hams - I'm getting hungry :D

I love that this can be made in the oven. Really great idea! I say *idea* because I didnt follow the recipe... First, I cut it in half, I used 5 eggs, I used only milk and I added more cinnamon. I used texas toast and also used 2 - 9x13 glass pans... I seem to always have a hard time beating in the cinnamon so i used my stick blender and it worked great!

I made a few changes like not using half and half at all. I made a small portion so I used 4 eggs and thus halved all other ingredients. I also made a major change by not leaving it overnight in the fridge. Infact, I had it sit in the fridge for an hour only!! My family absolutely loved the result.

This recipe got 5 stars from my family, but I'm rating it a 4 because the recipe itself is off pretty dramatically. I read a couple dozen reviews and followed Jgordon (Jan 1st)'s suggestions and it turned out fluffy, delicious and NOT soggy.

I made this dish for Sunday breakfast. I did make a few changes...I used fresh made cinnamon swirl bread, added ground cloves, nutmeg & pure vanilla to the mix. I used all 1/2 & 1/2. Chopped a couple of apples(they needed to be used quickly) and added to the top. Sprinkled 1/3 c sugar in the raw on  top, and skipped the caramel topping. I served warm, homemade maple syrup with it, for those who wanted it. My whole clan loved it! Recipe is great as is, or as a base. Will certainly make again. Thanks for sharing! ***THE KEY TO NOT HAVING THIS OR ANY FRENCH TOAST TURN OUT SOGGY, IS TO USE A THICKER MILK, SUCH AS EVAPORATED, 1/2 & 1/2 or HEAVY WHIPPING CREAM***

I made this for Christmas brunch and everyone loved it. I followed the advice of other viewers and didn't use the milk at all. I turned the toast over half through the baking so I had no mushy issues. The last 10 minutes I poured the sauce over the top and continued to bake for 10 more minutes. Yum Yum!

Super good-I followed the advice of only using heavy cream and not milk.  I sprinkled with white sugar instead of brown.  Yummy!

I made this in both a metal and a glass baking dish and both times the toast was impossibly stuck to the bottom of the pans after baking and I didn't skimp on buttering the dishes.  I wasted a dozen eggs before learning that putting waxed paper under the toast in the dish is the only way to get your pieces out looking decent.  I totally destroyed the first two batches trying to remove them from the pans.  Don't make my mistake!  Use waxed paper!

I did this for our familys annual Christmas Tree day morning, and it was amazing.  I did make some changes to the original tho.  I used 6 eggs, 1-1/2 cup milk, 1-1/2 eggnogg (for that extra Christmassy flavor) Also I used a large loaf of Italian bread and I made it two layers.  My bread soaked up all the liquid right away and was not the least bit soggy after baking the next morning.  I also added a pinch of salt because otherwise this turns out a bit flat.  For a special occasion I add a splash of rum to the butter brown sugar mixture and it just adds some great flavor to this.  I did everything else the same as the original and it was a hit!

I was very embarassed today when I served this to overnight guests for breakfast.  We all ended up eating something else.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was a soggy mess that just fell apart.  Way too much liquid.  Would not reccommend this recipe.

Love this dish!! I make this over and over. We have used it for men's breakfast at church and company. I make a slight variation. I like REAL maple syrup so instead of the brown sugar and corn syrup, melt real maple syrup with the butter. Always a hit!!! I'd give it ten stars if I could!

I thought this was more custard like, not like your basic french toast, took longer to bake, and not all my slices of french bread fit in a 9x13. Next time I will reduce the milk and eggs. Tastes good though!

To avoid the the "soggy bread" complaint, eyeball your bread mixture.  You need to consider the density of bread and size of eggs used. I used 1.25 lbs. of french bread and 10 eggs(med). I reduced brown sugar to 1 cup and used only 1/2cup butter. I highly recommend using maple syrup instead of corn syrup.  Also, I tore my bread into egg size pieces instead of slicing. This was delicious. Like a bread pudding--I would make it often if it was not so fatting. Ohhhhh it would be blissful to a skinny person!

I actually tried this recipe last easter and thought I had thrown the recipe out, however I just came across it and thought I would let others know what I thought since I read reviews from others when searching for a recipe to try. I made the toast the night before, left it soaking as suggested. My family came over for brunch Easter morning and I popped it in the oven. When it came out I was disgusted with the amount of juice in the pan and the toast had not cooked at all, I tried frying the toast in an open skillet trying to salvage something and it was to no avail, only half of the toast was edible but it was horrible. I was glad I made crepes to go with it and that is what we ate. I honestly could not tell you how to 'tweak' this recipe to come out right. I am an experienced cook and this was a first for me to not make a recipe succeed. Will not try again!

I am so sorry to say that this was awful.  I have made oven french toast before and this particular recipe was very disappointing.  The top was beautiful, but no one in my family would eat it.  It was incredibly mushy.  There was absolutely no bread texture remaining and reminded us of undercooked scrambled eggs.  I hesitate to try it again, but would recommend trying only HALF the amount of liquid and milk.  The density of the bread could also be a major factor so use a dense loaf.  Good luck and I'm so sorry for the bad review!!

This recipe turned out great! I also only used 6 eggs and 2 cups of half and half, no milk. I also used regular white sandwich bread instead of French bread and it turned out great! I will definitely make this again!

I tried this last night and when I tell you its good, OFF THE CHAIN! Of course I put my on spin but not much. I took some advice from other commenters and left out the milk, 2c half and half, 6 eggs, much more cinnamon maybe 2-3tb(the best part),1/2t ground cloves,1/2t ground allspice. I don't have time to be soaking bread(because I'm ready to eat)I soaked for about 40m turning the bread over after 20m then cooked as directed. For the sauce, I didn't have corn syrup so guess what, didn't miss it lol. My growing boys almost finished the pan, I had to say, "you had enough"! I thought it was a little eggy so next time I'll try 5

Amazing with the changes I made.  Everyone loves it and it will be our Christmas breakfast.  I used 1/2 loaf home made wheat bread, 6 eggs, 2 cups milk, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp pumpkin pie spice, 1/2 cup pumpkin.   I dipped the bread before putting it in the pan.   There was very little liquid left.  Soaked over night and used honey instead of kero syrup.  It was amazing.   We also cooked it a little longer uncovered.

my house loves this recipe.  I use random bread... everything left in the kitchen, hamburger buns, bagels, english muffins, etc.  Ive made it several ways, including with almond milk instead of cream.  When i didn't have light corn syrup i used more brown sugar and butter.

I read the rest of the reviews before I started and I'm glad I tweaked it according to what the reviewers had written. I used 7 eggs and 1 1/2cups milk only. I also reduced the sugar and butter caramel. The result was a crispy top and a soft bottom. My colleagues who had it like it too. I'll attempt this again for my family members next time.

This was hands down the best french toast that I've ever had!  My boyfriend loved it (it made the perfect Valentine's breakfast) and I can't wait to make it again!  Thank you to Michelle for reading all of the other reviews to compile what works best.  I followed that exactly (using 6 eggs and half and half instead of milk, turning the pieces over and cooking covered for 20 minutes and then uncovered for the last 20 with the sauce on it) and it was amazing!

Delicious!  I read many reviews and adjusted.  I only used 6 eggs.  I used 1C milk and 1C half and half.  I used maple syrup instead of corn syrup.  According to another reviewer, I dipped the french bread slices into the mixture instead of pouring.  Once I placed them in a 13x9 throw away pan, I poured the remainder of the liquid over the bread.  Refrigerated it overnight.  Turned the slices over the next morning.  Baked it for half the time (covered).  Took the cover off and poured the sauce over it and continued baking, uncovered for the rest of the time.  The top pieces got crispy, but the bottom was a little soggy.  But I thought it still tasted delicious!!

This was a good starting point for a baked french toast recipe.  I've made many in the past and have never turned out well.  This year I went with reviewers suggestions and it was pretty good.  1- used 12 slices of honey wheat bread (regular sandwich bread) 2- used 2 9x13 pans, 6 slices of bread in each 3- used 7 eggs (6 would have done it too though) 4- omitted the milk and used 2 cups half n half 5- dried the bread in the oven for 15 minutes on 300 degrees turning frequently to dry as much as possible 6- poured half the egg mixture with 2 tsp vanilla and 1 tablespoon of cinnamon into each 9x13 pan and poured off any excess into the other pan. 7- turned bread slices over to ensure all sides were coated with egg mixture.  There was no leftover egg mixture pooled in the bottom of either pan. 8- let sit over night and baked at 350 for 15.  9- turned every slice of bread over at the 15 minute mark 10-
made the sauce as directed but only used maybe 1/3 of the sauce 11- spooned 1 tablespoon or slightly more of sauce onto each slice of bread directly which helped cut down on the extreme sweetness.  Next time I won't make the sauce at all but use regular syrup at the table to avoid eating all that butter. 12- finished baking it for 20 minutes more after the initial 15.  Nothing was soggy.  Both sides of the bread were actually crisp too.

VERY sweet and rich.  Better as a side dish, I think, sort of as you'd serve sweet pastry.  I served it with eggs, bacon and a fruit salad.  Perfection.

I made this for my daughter's first birthday.  I followed others recommendations and used 6 eggs and 1 cup of milk and about 1/2 cup of cream.  Cut pieces of french toast at least 1 1/2 inches thick.  This was loved by all.

Made this for a Christmas brunch and it was lovely! I did, however, leave off the syrupy topping altogether and left it for others to decide how sweet they wanted it. Before baking I flipped each of the slices over so the wettest side was up. They turned out beautifully!

This was made with no modifications aside from reducing the number of eggs to 6 and the total liquid to 2 cups.    The interior portions of this french toast were  fantastic and a wonderful consistency, but the caramel sauce made this recipe entirely too sweet.  In fact, this was sweeter than most desserts I've had.    Unless you like your French Toast to be incredibly sweet, I would certainly adjust the amount of caramel sauce.

I am a pastry chef and bakery owner and I have made this recipe at least 50 times. My husband's family LOVES it so it has become my obligatory breakfast for every visit and holiday. Some time saving tips:

1. I found the brown sugar sauce can be poured over the soaking french toast the night before to save you time in the morning. It doesn't change the outcome one bit.

2. It freezes extremely well! Make the french toast, pour the sauce over the top, let it sit overnight and then cover and freeze it. When you're ready to bake it just put it in a pre-heated oven and double the bake time (I know it's done when it puffs up and has crispy looking edges). If you do this, make sure you use a metal dish- a cold glass one will break when it slides on to a hot oven rack.

3. I use 2 cups half and half, 6 eggs, cinnamon to taste and Madagascar Bourbon vanilla bean paste. Let it soak for 30 minutes while you prep the sauce, then flip each piece and pour the sauce over top and sit over night. I have also tried this with Bollio bread from the mexican supermarket and it's superb.

Serve it with fresh fruit and some ham or bacon- the perfect easy breakfast for a crowd!

In the spirit of being an honest reviewer, I give this recipe as written two stars (at best)- without alterations, it is a SOGGY MESS! The second time I made it, I cut the bread thick- about 2 inch slices- and used a bigger pan so all the bread fit. I used 6 eggs, and only 1/2 cup half & half and 1/2 cup milk. Any more liquid and it will turn into mush. I soaked overnight as directed, and also turned the bread over in the morning- that helped the dry areas get coated. I also doubled the cinnamon and vanilla (yummy). The end result of making the recipe this way was AMAZING!! It tasted like carmelized cinnamon rolls and got RAVES at brunch! DO NOT make the recipe as directed though, its not worth wasting the ingredients!

I made this for a crew of 10 guys (ages 18-50) and they loved it! I got multiple compliments, and even questions on how I made it - they could tell it was different from regular french toast.   I followed advice of the other reviewers in making the bread slices really thick (they were about 1.5") and using less liquid. I used 6 eggs, 2 cups of half-and-half, and no milk. I also used a large Italian loaf, rather than French bread, so the sliced were ginormous and I ended up needing two baking dishes.  My favorite part, besides that it's absolutely delicious, is that you can prep it the night before and then stick it in the oven in the morning and not worry about it. When you're making breakfast for such a large crowd, this is a huge bonus!

With a few modifications, this recipe made phenomenal baked French toast. I took some suggestions by other reviewers. I started with fresh French bread and didn't think about leaving it to stale or dry out in the oven. I'm fairly certain that the original recipe is calling for stale bread because it just seems like an overload of liquid. Anyway, I sliced the loaf into 1.5" thick slices on the diagonal. Then I only used 6 eggs, 1/2 c half and half, and 1/2 c milk (only had skim). Kept the vanilla and spices the same. I dipped each slice in the liquid on both sides and wedged them into a 9x13 baking pan, left overnight to soak. I had some liquid leftover and just spooned it over the middle of thicker pieces. In the morning, I melted only 4 T butter and 3/4 c brown sugar for the sauce, which was more than enough. Topped mine with chopped pecans and baked in the oven for about 40 minutes. Served w/fresh blueberries. A bit hit w/my boyfriend! I'll definitely be making this again for special occasions.

I have made this recipe more than 5 times over the last 2 months and everyone loves it.  I do make a couple of modifications.  I use 6 large eggs, 3/4 cup milk, and 3/4 cup half & half, and I don't flip in the middle of cooking.  It's perfect!

This is the most popular breakfast casserole I have ever made -- and I cook a lot!  The change I made does make it more of a casserole, however, and it helps with the soggy issue some reviewers had.  Tear the bread into pieces instead of slices.  Whether it's day old or not, it will soak up all of the liquid.  I also sometimes use fat free French Vanilla coffee creamer in place of the cream and vanilla since I often have that on hand.  Be sure to stir the mixture in the morning before it goes into the oven to move the liquid that has settled overnight back to the top.

This is the basic receipe turned around for Creme Brule French Toast.  The butter, brown sugar, cs mix goes on the bottom of the pan followed by the 1" or thicker challah or hawaiian bread and the egg and half and half mixture is on the bottom.  I didn't try it this way, but the Creme Brule French toast is spectacular.

This recipe needed alittle tweaking, but was a huge hit.  The previous reviews stated that it was a soggy mess.  I baked this 1 hour until tall and puffy.  Trying to watch calories for company, I used half eggs,half eggbeaters, half 1/2&1/2 and half milk.  I pressed the bread down in the custard before I refridgerated it covered with foil.  And just before baking, omitted the caramel and drizzled about 1/4 real maple syrup over it.  Everyone took home the recipe.  This was a great success and this site is great!

I took the advice of the other reviewers and cut back on the liquids.  I also ommitted the brown sugar mixture.  I used brown sugar and cut in the butter to make a crumb topping on the french toast.  So it never got soggy.  I think it came terrific.

This dish is awesome!  I really don't know why it didn't turn out well for some cooks.  After reading the reviews I used 7 eggs (medium) & 1 cup each of milk and half & half.  I absolutely LOVED how it was all golden brown and toasted at the top and soft and moist on the inside.  Next time I will make more of the brown sugar topping.  Will definitely make again.

Great recipe! I reduced the liquid a little and cooked a bit longer as suggested by other reviews to avoid soggy results- it came out great! I would like to try it with pecans and maybe egg nog instead of the heavy cream for Christmas! Its a keeper!

SO delicious!  I doubled the recipe and placed everything in a sheet cake pan and it turned out amazing.  I cut the bread thicker, used 2.5 C whole milk and no half-and-half, and I was very pleased with the results.  My family was, too!

I followed the advice of others and used 6 eggs and a reduced amount of milk/cream.  I ended up mixing up the remaining milk, eggs and cream and using it too!  I dipped the bread in the mix, placed it (layered) in the pan and it came out fantastic!  I found the amount of syrup that went on top a little excessive.  I added extra cinnamon and everyone said it tasted like cinnamon buns.  Try it with all of the milk and eggs...its worth it!

Hmmmm, this is probably the lowest rating I've ever given a recipe on allrecipes. The crispy top was good but the soggy bottom part was not too appealing. My son hated it, my daughter thought it was ok and so did I but DH wasn't too impressed by the texture. The bottom does taste as other described, like undercooked scrambled eggs...uggh! I even baked it 10 min more and it didn't help. I think if the liquid part was reduced it might be salvageable. I think I'm going to have to make French Toast the good old fashioned way. Thanks anyway Laura.

My family loves french toast so I thought I would try this.  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out really mushy.  I was disappointed because I really wanted this to work.  I tried it twice and turned out the same way.  It just seems like there is too much liquid in the recipe.

I found a way to make this recipe much more like regular french toast with a crispy outside and regular bread inside.  Like other i used 6 medium eggs. I used a splash of milk and 1 pint of half and half. i also cut the Dark brown sugar back to a little more than 1/2 cup.  After beating the eggs, milk, cream, and vanilla and cinnamon, instead of pouring the mixture over the bread, simply dip each peice of bread (both sides) into the egg mix once. Keep any left over mix. then place each piece standing on its side into the baking dish and refrigerate overnight. In the morning take each peice and dip it once more (both sides) into the mixture. If necessary butter another baking dish and put all bread lying face up into the dishes. Bake for 30 minutes uncovered on 350 degrees. While that is cooking, combine the butter,brownsugar and corn syrup in a saucepan. Heat until they bubble.  Then after the 30 minutes, brush a little of the brownsugar mixture on top of each peice of the bread. Also if desired, top with a few chopped pecans. Cook another 5-10 minutes. Then eat.  Enjoy!

this did not turn out well - too soupy.  if you make it, use a bigger baking dish and just 2 cups of half and half, no milk.  Probably could get by with 6 eggs and the 2 cups of half and half  Like some others said, turn the bread over before baking and bake for 20 minutes covered and then add the topping and bake another 20 - 25 minutes uncovered or until no longer soupy.

Easily made in advance for next morning oven.  Very tasty. The second time I made, I sliced the bread a bit wider and used the same liquid volume ingredients - improved.

DO NOT make this recipe as is. Take into consideration the reviews and decrease the amount of liquid in the recipe. Mine ended up crispy on the top and the rest mush. Good flavor, just NOT the right consistency.

I loved this recipe! It's breakfast and a cinnamon roll at the same time. Since there are only three of us, I adjusted it this way and it was perfect, plus lactose free:1/2 loaf of French bread/6 1" slices, 4 eggs, 1 cup lactose free milk, 1 t. vanilla, 1/8 t. cinnamon and I halved the topping, but used Dark Karo instead of light.  Did what a few others did by turning the pieces of bread over before cooking, covering it for the first 20 mins, and pouring the topping over and cooking it uncovered the last 20 mins. It was DELICIOUS!

My family loved it! 6 eggs, 1 1/2 cups half and half, 1/4 cup milk, heavy shake of cinnamon, 2tsp vanilla. Topping 1 cup brown sugar, 3/4 cup butter, 1 whole apple peeled and chopped finely bring to a simmering boil until apples are soft. Awesome!

This was so yummy!!! I only had to make a couple of changes due to what I had on hand. I only had 6 eggs and used syrup instead of corn syrup as that is all I had. I turned each slice over halfway through cooking and then put the topping on. The only thing I will suggest as put a drip pan under as it will bubble over some because the bread puffs up some. Thank you for an amazing recipe!!

I have made this recipe for years - you can use any bread or rolls you have leftover - I mix all the wet ingredients (eggs, milk, half & half, vanilla - whatever is used) in the blender set on low - one time I added a 3 oz. pkg. of cream cheese to the blender - I do things creatively. I like a lot of topping (cinnamon & brown sugar, touch of nutmeg) the topping is crunchy and good. Definitely needs to set overnight in frig to get the best consistency when baked. In my biggest pan I have used a lot more eggs and adjust liquids and bread.

I was a bit nervous to try the recipe as is bit I did and it got rave reviews! I tried to dry out my bread and think it would've been even better if i had dried it out even more. I wanted to cook it longer but it was bubbling over into my oven so I pulled it out. I must have gone wrong on a measurement b/c it seemed like way too much caramel sauce. It was delicious as written but I may try to play with the recipe (and the bread) to save my oven next time.

This was very yummy, but also incredibly sweet. I put slivered almonds on top instead of pecans and I would urge anyone making this to add some type of nuts. It makes it delicious. But it sticks terribly to the pans, so put down a layer of foil or non stick paper before you bake these. I used a whole french stick and used two pans with one layer of bread. I halved the egg mix and caramel mix between them.

Yummy!  I made for Christmas brunch and it was a hit!  Keep an eye on the oven towards the end of cooking; mine puffed up and started to bubble over.  You might want to put a cookie sheet on the rack underneath.

Pretty good recipe, I followed the recipe exactly as stated. The glaze on top is delicious and has a very caramel like taste. The only thing I would do different is let it cool a lot longer before eating, it firms up nicely and tastes better. Made a wonderful addition to Easter breakfast!

This was AMAZING! I made one tiny change and that was to use maple syrup instead of the corn syrup in the sauce. Everything else stayed the same. I took it to my church for Easter breakfast and everyone raved about it. It's some where between bread pudding and french toast. I had to print out the recipe for everyone!

Flavor-5 stars
Texture-1 star

I made something very similar to this last Christmas and found the texture soggy.  I made it again because the flavor is awesome.  This time I read over some of the reviews and cut the eggs, milk, and cream.  I also flipped the bread before baking and while baking.  Still soggy.  
Now my brother just said, "that was some good stuff!  Thank you."  if you like bread pudding, this is delicious.  If you don't, its not easy to avoid the texture.

It was good, needed to cook longer, though. It was like a flan (custard) inside, and my husband prefers it kind of dry, like a sweet bread. However, it was really good next morning. If I make it again, I'll add some sugar or honey to the custard, it didn't taste very good inside, unless it had a lot of the syrup.

This was delish just the way it is...more like a french toast bread pudding. The only thing different I did was melt 1/2 stick butter in the bottom of my casserole, sprinkle some brown sugar and pecans over it with a little cinnamon. Makes a nice caramel bottom! Add a few pecans to the top also. This the dish everyone expects when we have a brunch in our home!

This was great, decided to make this weekend for a treat.  As there was only the 3 of us I scaled it back to 4 serving.   I followed the recipe the only thing i did was add 2 more eggs for a total of 5 eggs, as I also had whipping cream that needed using I used that in place of the milk very yummy.  I think the next time I make this I want to try cubing the bread and see how I like that better.  I also want to try doubling the sauce part, as is, was great didn't need any syrup but I want more of the sauce

I agree that it is way too much liquid. I used the suggestion to use two cups half & half and six eggs (and no milk). It turned out perfectly. I also baked mine a little longer to get it a little crisper on top. It was awesome. My kids are REALLY pickly and they loved it!

OMG! There is not a word good enough to describe this! I had a whole loaf of my homemade braided bread sliced. I only used 6 eggs with  some vanilla soy. (We don't do regular milk). It was plenty egg mixture. I added a dash of nutmeg, just b/c I love nutmeg in my french toast. it sat in my fridge overnight and the next day until I baked it for dinner, still turned out delish. I halved the brown sugar mixture just b/c I didn't want to pour that much sugar butter over my french toast! But it was still plenty!  I baked covered for 20 min than added the sugar mixture  and than continued baking uncovered for 20 min. I love this recipe! I even bumped up the temp to 400 for the last half to oven bake some bacon. Perfect!

I made this per the directions with the exception of using croissants instead of french bread.  I had some frozen croissants that I thawed and sliced in half.  I weighed out 1 lb - don't remember exactly  how many I used.  The croissants had no problem soaking up the liquid - maybe the results were similar to bread pudding, which I don't mind since I love bread pudding!  I used my own recipe for buttermilk syrup - my kids like it much better than maple syrup.  All in all a successful recipe.  I only knocked off one star because I made a major change in the bread.

I think this recipe should be called French Toast bread pudding or French Toast custard. It definitely does not come out to the french toast consistency that we were expecting.  A lot of work to throw it all away and scramble around to make another breakfast meal.  The inside of this was mush.  Wet and soppy are the only words I can use to describe it.  If you like bread pudding, you'll probably enjoy this recipe very much.  If you're looking for a recipe for French toast, look elsewhere.

This is soooooo good! It will keep me from going to IHOP for my french toast fix. I didn't have any corn syrup so I just melted butter and added a small amount of brown sugar. So good! I also didn't have 1/2 and 1/2 and it came out fine.  Added some nutmeg to the milk and egg mixture too.

I followed the recipe as is.  After being in the oven for over an hour, the bake was still soggy.  I thought when I was putting the recipe together that 3 1/2 cups of liquid seemed like a lot.  I was right.

Decadent and yummy!!  Made for Christmas morning breakfast.  Attempted the recipe a week before and made the mistake of slicing the bread too thick and found the bread was dry inside.  This time I cut proper 1 inch thickness and soaked over night then flipped over the next day.  I added pecans to half the pan with the sauce...its great with the pecan, almost like warm pecan pie.  Thanks for the recipe - it'll be our christmas tradition now!

Had no real half and half cream, so I used one 12 ounce can evaporated milk plus 1/2 cup fat free half and half. Did not add milk and the 2 cups of liquid was enough. Cut the sauce down to 1/2 cup butter, 1 cup brown sugar and it was plenty. Used a loaf of pre-sliced country white bread, baked it 20 minutes pre-sauce then 20 minutes post-sauce. Perfect even with substitutes!

I just made this for the first time for my college age daughter and her 4 girlfriends. They gobbled it up! I was actually quite surprised how much they ate! Barely any left for me and my hubby (he really liked it too!). Served with a big bowl of fresh fruit. I read a lot of the reviews and used 6 eggs, 3/4 cup milk,3/4 cup half-and-half cream. I dipped the pieces of bread and put them in one layer so ended up using 3 glass dishes. Before baking I turned them. I baked 20 minutes, turned again and then added the sauce. Will definitely make again.

After reading the reviews I decided to make one simple modification.  Instead of pouring all the egg mixure over the bread I dunked each piece for about 15 seconds seperately and then placed them standing up and leaning on each other.  It was not soggy at all this way.  I did have a little egg mixture left over and I threw that away.  Everyone loved it even the 4 young children.

I wish I had read the reviews first like I usually do. Like others, mine was a soggy mess. I couldn't even flip the pieces because they were falling apart. Too eggy for me too; more like a soggy bread pudding. If you make mods to the recipe please don't give it 5 stars- it's misleading. This needs a lot of modifications to be good.

This was the second time I have made this recipe.  The first time I made it, I followed the recipe and didn't like the souffle texture at all.  It was soggy, but the parts that weren't soggy were wonderful.  I made it for Christmas breakfast using only half of the liquid and eggs.  It was a hit this time.  I will make it again and again, but alter the recipe the same.

This was easy to make and the family enjoyed it. Used challah bread, cut down the liquid to 6 eggs, 1 and a quarter cups of milk and 1 cup 1/2 and 1/2. I baked it as is for 20 minutes, then poured the syrup on top (i only used 1 stick of butter and 1 cup of brown sugar and 2T corn syrup). Baked it for 20 more min. It wasn't as soggy this way.

This is a staple at any brunch I throw. It tastes more like bread pudding - but we love it! when it's done baking I sprinkle it with a little powdered sugar.

After reading reviews, I also adjusted to 6 eggs and 2 1/2 cups milk. I highly recommend one additional change:  I blended softened butter and 1 cup brown sugar and spread mixture on each slice, place in pan buttered side down, cover bread with egg mixture let sit overnight and bake. Perfect!!

This is incredibly delicious!  I made it for Christmas brunch, following the recipe exactly, and it came out great.  I flipped the bread just before pouring over the syrup and baking, and left it alone while baking.  The only change I made was to bake it a bit longer than recommended, so that it was drier.  My mom would have loved to have it more like bread pudding, and my sister thought it was too wet, but they both thought it was good.  You just have to watch it in the oven and let it bake to your desired consistency- without burning!.  I made it again and this time decreased the half and half to one cup, with no noticable change in taste, but it was a bit drier.  It's a huge recipe for two people, and very filling, so I'd save it for company.  Now I'm looking for excuses to have people over for brunch!  ** Update- I've made this many times, and realized the bread is key.  The best one is a crusty, chewy, baguette, cut thick and left to soak well overnight or longer.  Anything softer will be soggier.

Should have listened to other reviewers and cut back on the eggs and milk/cream. Was a little soggy and a little too "eggy". Used challah bread instead of french which was delicious, only the bread expanded and it all stuck together. Added a bit of nutmeg to the seasoning as well and left off the crunchy topping. Will definitely make this again with the modifications.

Ok next time I will try this with day old bread instead.  I purchased fresh and used that.  Secondly since it puffs up and the caramel sauce gets bubbly in the oven it bubbled over somewhat and so make sure you have a cookie sheet or aluminum foil under the pan to catch the drippings.  
I did try it with less liquid.  I used 6 eggs and only 1 cup of milk.  It was still more like bread pudding than standard french toast.
I think to get the best results you need to have day old bread!  My bread was too fresh.

This was WAY WAY WAY too sweet for everyone at my brunch.  I made it as some suggested using 6 eggs and a total of 2 1/2 cups liquid.  I made it in a 9x11 pyrex glass baking dish layering the bread along the bottom.  To fit all the bread I sat the slices like you would on an apple torte - not flat but not standing straight up.

Well, the top of the bread was really crunchy and the bottom more like bread pudding.  Kinda of an odd mixture.  But, what ruined it for us what just the sugar topping.  I didn't even use all of it and it was beyond sweet.  The kids and adults at the brunch all passed after 1 bite.  Then clean-up....aargh clean-up.  The sugar coated the pan and I had to use boiling water with a scrungie to clean-it up.  

I was surprised because this got such great reviews.  But, here at our house we will never make it again.

This is a great recipe. I made it using heavy cream instead of half and half and it was awesome. It is a nice dish to prepare in advance and save in the fridge the night before baking.

I have been making Laura's recipe for a couple of years and it is loved by our entire family. We actually had it for breakfast this morning! Merry Christmas! This is the most requested holiday dish! (and birthdays too!) The only changes that I have made are: I use a 9 x 17 glass pan instead of a 9 x 13. I actually add an egg since I am using a larger pan. I also use a bit more french bread. I bake at a lower temperature and a little longer. Everyones oven heats a little differently, so adjust as needed. Also, I let the dish cool a bit so it sets. It reminds me a bit of a firm custard, bread pudding or flan. We love it!

Tried this recipe after reading all the rave reviews.  But I think I did something very wrong as it resulted in a overly sweet soggy mess.  I did use normal bread instead as I didn't have any French bread.

I made this recipe for Christmas breakfast this morning, along with some crispy bacon.  Wow!  This is one of the best foods I've eaten in a long time.  I used a fresh baguette, and made it about 3pm yesterday afternoon.  My only suggestion is that you will want to put a tray underneath the 9x13 pan to catch the bubble-over.  This is SO good though.

I brought this to a bridal shower and everyone asked for the recipe.  I used french bread from walmart and cut it into 1" slices.  I arranged them on a 9x13 pan and followed most of the directions. I used heavy cream instead of milk/half and half and added 1 tsp more vanilla to the egg mixture and doubled the brown sugar topping, opting for maple syrup instead of corn syrup.  I think I crammed the bread to tight because some pieces rose and the egg mixture was left on the bottom.  Next time I won't try to cram every piece of bread in and I may use less eggs too.  Note***You can't use regular sandwich bread or any like that.  Use a dense or hearty bread.  Next time I'm gonna use challah!!!

I made this recipe for a fathers day brunch - it was one of three breakfast casseroles I chose.  I read other reviews and followed advice and added one of my own.  I used 1 cup of buttermilk plus the one and a half cups of half and half (skipped the regular milk).  I also used only 6 eggs.  I used cinnamon bread and dipped each piece before layering in pan.  Added extra vanilla and a little nutmeg to topping.  The cooking time was perfect.  Everyone RAVED about this baked french toast and several people asked for the recipe.  I chose the Brunch Seafood Strata from Better Homes and Gardens and Southern Living Magazine's Breakfast Casserole found at your web site as my other casseroles and they were all big hits.  Thanks.

Just made this recipe this morning for about 12 15 yr. old guys (sleepover) They loved it!! I used 8 eggs, 1-1/2 c. milk, extra vanilla and extra cinnamon. The rest I went according to recipe. It all depends on the bread you use and it won't be mushy.   I used braided egg bread (Challah) Which is a hearty bread.  You can't use something like Wonder bread.  I really packed it in the pan tight (used every space up with bread) The only problem is the syrup did over flo alittle in the oven but thats no biggie. It came out all puffy and wonderful.
I will use this again, very good!

I used the entire amount of eggs, milk, and 1/2 and 1/2 but split the cut loaf into a 9x13 pan and an 8" square pan.  Right before putting it in the oven I flipped the slices over.  The reult was not mushy at all.  Instead of the corn syrup I used real maple syrup. There was none left and I plan on making it again.

After I made some changes, this was really tasty. Thanks to other reviewers suggestions, I decreased the amount of eggs to only 4, added only 1 cup of milk, and 3/4 cup half and half. I also added extra vanilla and some nutmeg. I also used slightly stale bread and turned the bread a few times before I went to bed last night. When I cooked the syrup, I decreased the butter by 2T. I had no problem with this being soggy or custardy, to me it was just right.

I adore this recipe. It's simple to put together at night and even easier to make in the morning.

For those who are upset by soggy bread, I say this: Either think of this as a French Toast bread pudding (crisp on top, smooshy on the bottom)OR reduce the amount of eggs and milk you add. Allowing your bread to sit out and harden a bit should help, too. 

I slice bread and then tear chunks to fill up the spaces between the slices in the pan. Otherwise, I've made it as directed every time with the same result: Yummy!!!

Oh my, this was good.  Odd as it may sound, I thought this got better as the day went by.  I used the full amount of eggs called for and decreased the milk by 1/2 a cup. I also used fat-free half and half...but you couldn't tell.  Next time I might add some brown sugar or maple syrup to the egg mixute.  I like mine a little sweeter..that way I don't drown every peice in syrup.  The brown sugar syrup gave the top of the bread a little sweetness.  Mine turned out beautifully.  Thanks for sharing Laura.

I'm sorry, I didn't like this at all. I can see how people would like it-I just think it's my taste. It was a little too sweet for me, and the bread was a little tough on the outside and too soggy in the middle. But it could be the way I cooked it...

This recipe turned out WAY too moist and I ended up throwing almost all of it away. I reduced the eggs to 5, reduced the milk to 1 cup and baked it for over 75 minutes but none of this helped. I definately will be looking for a different baked french toast recipe next time.

This recipe might be the worst thing I have ever made from allrecipes! I cooked it for 40 minutes and it was very soggy. I cooked it for 60 minutes and it was soggy. I cooked it for almost 75 minutes and it was kind of done. It basicly looks like uncooked scrambled eggs. I think I'll stick with regular good ol' french toast- and stay FAR away from this recipe.

This was great. I made two of these. Everyone loved this at my brunch today. I will make this again and again. I did use the 6 eggs and the 1 cup. I made the original last week and it was good but a little like bread pudding. One tip: This time I cut the bread into smaller pieces and I put them upright in the pan rather than flat in the pan. I was able to fit the whole lb of bread and it looked pretty. I served it with mixed berrys (blue, black, and rasberrys).

WOW!  Great recipe!  Made it the night before and was easy.  A little soggy - I'll try putting it on the bottom rack like another reviewer did.  Great for a brunch.  I also used extra bread and it was fine.  I'll use again!

Today is a sunny, Los Angeles, December 25, and I just finished devouring this breakfast dish, along with strong black coffee.  All I can say is Merry Christmas!!!  It was wonderful.  I ended up wedging in more bread to fill the pan (12 oz. total weight), but this dish was fluffy, moist, caramelly, and custard like, nonetheless.  A "keeper" of a recipe, if there ever was.  Thank you Laura.

I am surprised by the 1,2, and 3 star reviews for this recipe. Those that did not like it probably don't like French Toast.  I have made it many times and the only change I made was to use sugarless syrup instead of the brown sugar, syrup, butter mix.  Try cutting the bread a little thinner and put a layer of sliced bananas between two layers of bread. 

If your oven is coming up to the correct temp you don't need to change a thing.

My family and I loved this recipe.  My husband and son both took seconds.  I followed the recipe; changed nothing.  I will make it again, however I will use a larger baking pan as the bread puffed up and the liquids overflowed a bit.  The toast comes out in a state much like a custard; so yummy, rich, and decadent.  It was the perfect recipe for New Year's Day morning.  I turned on the oven and took the chilled toast out of the fridge.  Then I prepared the topping while the oven preheated.  By the time the oven temp was ready, so was the topping.  I poured the topping over the toast and popped the pan into the oven.  Approx. 45 minutes later it was done and we were about to be treated to a wonderful warm breakfast.  In short, a keeper!

I am a breastfeeding mother with a baby who has a milk sensitivity so I made the following substitutions and it was delicious! Coconut milk (replaced milk), canned coconut (replaced cream), maple syrup instead of butter, reduced corn syrup to 1.5tbs.

I have made this recipe for the last 3 years for Christmas breakfast.  
We love it!!  All the right ingredients are present you just have to design it to your taste and texture preferences.  I reduced the milk to 1c milk and used the half & half has shown.  I use 6 eggs.  I us1 tsp cinnamon.  In the morning, I turned each piece of bread, cover with foil for 20 mins, then pour sauce over and bake another 20 mins without the foil.  I have used maple syrup instead of corn syrup, too.

I followed another reviewer's advice, 6 eggs, 2 cups 1/2&1/2, cinnamon and vanilla, and this turned out very well.  My only complaint was that it didn't get as "done" as I like my french toast.  The center was still fairly runny.

The topping, however, is amazing, and really saved the dish.

I did what Michelle Mullis suggested (6 eggs, 2 cups half and half - no milk), but in the morning, after soaking the bread all night long, I also sliced up 4 Granny Smith Apples and threw them + 1t cinnamon in the pot with the rest of the sauce ingredients and boiled them until tender. Then I spread the slices evenly over the bread and poured the sauce over top and baked as recommended. It was delicious. I will be making this again, although I may decide to play with the recipe, as it's hard to use that much cream, butter and sugar and not feel guilty about it!

I never had baked French Toast before,  so when a friend wanted to stop in early one morning, while her husband was having health tests,  I decided it was time.  I prepared the recipe just exactly as written.   It was very good!   It was very custard like.  I will make this again,  but won't use as much milk.  I think it will become a 5 star recipe then.

One suggestion that makes it less soggy is using day old bagels.  If they are cinnamon raisin or another sweet type bagel or plain it works well.  Slice in half and be sure to saturate both sides of the bagel.  Bagels will absorb a lot of the egg/milk that you soak them in but will not get soggy like regular bread.

Really good and easy!  I might increase the butter or decrease the brown sugar since as the french toast cools a bit, that mix gets hard and crunchy.  Will make again.  :)

Another tip...Use 1 to 2 day old bread.  The drier the bread the more liquid it will soak up.

5 stars with modifications! Like others have said, 6 eggs only 1 1/2 cups liquid, I did 3/4 half and half, 3/4 milk.  cook for 20 minutes turn over and finish for another 20.
I agree that you shouldn't have to read the reviews to get a recipe perfected but I appreciate all the chefs out there that take the time to post their changes! They save me time and money!!!

Because I love Carmel I doubled the amounts for the Carmel sauce on top. It was awesome but extremely rich in my opinion. The company I had over loved it as well

Reduce liquid*. I made this with 2 cups of milk and seven eggs, omitted the half and half and the center was still soggy, outside crispy and delicious! After reading reviews in the future I plan on using the 1in French bread but letting it get a little stale prior to adding the liquid and flipping the bread to help soak up to liquid.  As for the liquid 6 eggs and 1 3/4cups of milk or half and half and milk combined, I don't think I'll be adding more than that. 
For the topping, I used 1/2 cup of butter and 1 cup of brown sugar, maple syrup, this was just perfect. Overall great dish and one you can be creative with and will taste great even if a little soggy.

My whole family LOVES this recipe! I use it with whatever bread product (any type of plain flavor bread, buns, dinner rolls etc.) I have left over and it works every time. My favorite are dinner rolls and burger buns from the old-fashioned bakery where I work! I also use a slightly bigger (and deeper) pan than a 9x13 and the topping doesn't bubble over this way. Otherwise, just try placing the pan on a foil-covered cookie sheet to save yourself from cleaning a mess! I just fill this pan with a layer (at least 1 in. thick) of bread/buns and then pour over about half of the egg/milk mixture. Repeat and refrigerate covered overnight! I use 10-12 eggs and 4 cups of whole milk as well as about 1/2 cup of flour and 1/4 cup of sugar and 1/2 tsp cinnamon plus the vanilla in the egg/milk mixture!
Next morning, I make the topping and bake as directed! It is a bit like bread pudding only a lot better! Delicious!!!

This was very good.  After reading the reviews, I did modify it some in ways that made sense to me.  Now that I have made it, what I will do differently next time is make it less sweet by using less of the butter, brown sugar & corn syrup topping.  I love sweet, but this is really, really sweet!

I followed this recipe to the T!!! It was disgusting.  Completely soggy, watery, it was just gross.  Very disappointed.  I was looking forward to making this for my parents on Thanksgiving morning.  There's no way I can serve this. :(

loved it! I only got 10 slices in the pan instead of 12, but the ratio was fine!  I also had heavy cream instead of half&half, not sure how much difference it made... I knew it was done when it puffed up in the middle, like a souffle... not 40 mins, but I'm still calibrating my new oven.  The caramel sauce from the bottom drizzled over it like maple syrup was to die for! This will be served often here!

I loved this recipe!  Made it as written and it turned out so good.  A day later it turned into more of a custard, but still delicious.  Unfortunately, my family did not like it at all, so this will be a recipe I save for family events or brunches.

THIS WAS GREAT!! I fixed this for Father's Day & my husband's birthday. I used some of the modifications from other reviewers & it turned out perfectly. My family can't for my retirement (Dec 2013)so that that I can make it more often. Thanks for the recipe & to all the reviewers suggestions.

Overall - very appealing to the eye but too sweet. I'm a sugar lover and the brown sugar topping was way too sweet for me. The only changes I made were: I used Oroweat Italian bread and sliced it into squares, I did not soak the bread overnight (about 20 min til liquid was absorbed), I added crushed corn flakes on top before baking, and I baked for about 45 min. Otherwise I followed the recipe. My suggestions: depending on your preference for the bread consistency (soggy or less) bake for 40-50 mins. Double the cinnamon. For the sugar topping, use half the amount of butter and sugar and no corn syrup and just drizzle mixture over top of bread before baking OR skip the sugar topping completely and let each person sweeten it themselves with syrup or other. Unless you're feeding a family of 6, cut the recipe by a quarter (which should still be enough for 3 people). Spray Pam or butter the bottom of the baking dish AND mix bread and milk/egg mixture in a separate bowl before placing in baking dish. Be careful, it will rise a bit, don't burn yourself! I'll try to add a photo later.

Flipped while making the sauce, added 1 tsp cinnamon. No other changes were made. Turned out great and was devoured at our church breakfast and even complimented. Thanks!

Let me start by saying I am not a frenach toast fan, but my partner is hinch why I made it. I followed a mixture of the review as I hate sogging bread. I did not add the topping as I let people of a choice of flavored syrups. I enjoyed it and my partner has asked for it three times in the week since I made it. Next time I will add a little more cinnamin and vanila with a splash of sugar for our taste. This was such a quick prep dish and since I am up about an hour our two before everyone else it was ready when they were.

The taste was wonderful but I made a huge mistake!  In a rush to get food on the table for Christmas brunch, I left the foil on top of this dish when it went into the oven.  It was SO soggy!!  Very delicious though - I wouldn't change a thing except to pay more attention to how I baked it!!  Thanks for a great recipe!!

It was tasty, but soggy.  If I make again, will use some others suggestion about reducing the amount of liquid prior to baking.

This bake made for a delicious breakfast for our visitors.  I had to bake it an extra 20 minutes and used 1/2 of the caramel topping, but I was very pleased with how the dish came out.

This is great... my sister made it for the family for Mother's day brunch... she took the soak bread out and put it in a new pan before she baked it.  It was a little hard to cut...  I made it the following weekend and followed the directions exactly and it was delicous!  It was more like a soufle.

I have never had baked french toast before, so i thought i would try it. This tasted more like bread pudding than french toast.  That said, my hubby liked it.  I thought it was more work than french toast, for something that tasted like and was the consistency o fbread pudding. After reading other reviews i did cut the liquid in half, even then it was mushy. Sorry, but won't be making this again. I will stick with original french toast.

Oh my goodness, tastes like candy!  It does have a bread pudding consistency though, so if you don't like the "soggy bread", this probably isn't the recipe for you.  I followed a few reviews and did 6 eggs and 2 cups of 1/2 and 1/2 (no milk).  The pecans taste like candied pecans on top- so great!  I also did add a little powdered sugar on top just before serving for appearances only.  Very good recipe, great for taking to a get together in the morning.

I left out the corn syrup, and the recipe was still delicious. I used thick-sliced "Texas Toast" bread rather than French bread and found that 40 minutes was not enough ... still mushy inside ... probably fine if I'd used the recommended bread.

I thought this might be a good recipe for Christmas morning, but decided to try it beforehand and make sure it was good. I halfed the recipe and made a few changes that the other viewers had mentioned. I omitted the milk and didn't lay them flat, but angled them. I tried to flip them half way through, but it was difficult because they were so soggy. They cooked fine, but looked unappealing. My husband said they were too sweet. I wasn't that impressed with this recipe and probably won't make them again.

Mushy, mushy.  I used 3/4 of the bread called for, less liquid as other reviewers had said, turned the bread over and it was still too mushy for our taste.  I ended up taking it out of the baking dish and putting each piece- not touch anything- on a broiling pan and baking until the entire piece came out firm.  I was hoping for a quick and easy meal with the pleasures of french toast without the work and I ended up more frusterated and in the kitchen for longer than if I had just made it on my skillet.  I gave it a two star because the flavor is good (it is exactly what I use for a skillet-prepared french toast) but it was just so gross and mushy I can't rate it higher.

I followed this recipe exactly as written, and let me just say it was delicious!! I used Texas Toast, since I didn't have a loaf of French bread, but that was the only change I made. I was worried that it might be a bit soggy, but hubby, who dislikes anything that is remotely mushy, loved it! I think it would be extra yummy if it were made with raisin bread. The brown sugar, butter, and corn syrup combination was just right, so that the French toast did not require any syrup or powdered sugar. I served it with Farmer John sausage links, and Pumpkin Spice coffee. A yummy breakfast indeed!

Good.  Made it into my permanent recipe file for when guests are over, but I think this is very fattening and not the traditional taste of french toast since it is so sweet.  I don't think you need to use all of the topping to make it good.  I used 6 eggs instead of 8, 1 cup milk instead of 2, and 1 tsp of cinnamon instead of 1/4 tsp.  Added pecans on the top.

Yesterday I made the french bread recipe on this website (by Jenn Hall) and out of the three baguettes it had made, I had one left over this morning. On a whim, I decided I'd like to make french toast out of it for breakfast.  As this was a last minute decision, I only soaked the bread in the egg/milk mixture for about 10 or 15 minutes (while the oven was preheating) and it still turned out SO GOOD.  I used 6 eggs, 2 c. milk, and 1/2 c. of heavy cream (because that's all that was left in my fridge), plus the vanilla and cinnamon. I baked it for 20 minutes covered with foil and then I uncovered it and flipped each piece over. I drizzled a bit of maple syrup and sprinkled a bit of brown sugar over it all, and placed a thin slice of butter over each piece. After cooking it for the remaining 20 minutes, I served it with maple syrup and some defrosted strawberries. It was HEAVENLY.

I made this for our Easter Brunch and it was a hit with the family. I read the reviews and used 7 eggs and reduced the amount of milk and half and half(3/4 cups each). I did use the exact amount of vanila and cinnamon. Instead of pouring the mixture over the bread, I dipped the bread in the mixture and poured the remaining mixture in between the bread slices and spooned over the bread. I then sprinkled additional cinnamon on the bread. I let it sit overnight in refrigerator. The next morning I placed in the oven and let it bake for approx. 15 minutes, then poured the sauce over the bread and in between. Baked for approximately 30 minutes and flipped the bread over. Then poured the remaining sauce over the turned over pieces and baked for another 30-45 minutes. I noticed this seemed to prevent the bread from getting soggy. The sauce helped to form a delicious caramel crust. I continued to flip until I felt the bread was firm to my liking. This also eliminated the mess others mention. It was perfect. Will definitely make again. Oh, I used fresh French Loaf(bagette).

Yummy! I halved the recipe for my fam of four. Used only 3 eggs, a little less than 3/4 cups of milk and 1/2 cup of cream. I turned bread over after a couple of hours in the fridge. Baked in oven the next morning for 30 minutes, then turned bread over again and baked for another 15 minutes.

First off, this will not be like traditional french toast. It will be much softer (read: soggy), even though I used only 6 eggs and 2 cups half and half. It is, however, delicious. I had rave reviews and people even asked for it for leftovers the next day.

This is a very good recipe and even better since it can be prepped the night before.  I used a good loaf of vienna bread which worked out very nicely.  I didn't have half and half so I used a milk/cream mixture which turned out just fine.  I also didn't realize until the morning that I did not have any corn syrup so I use real maple syrup in it's place.  It actually made more sense to me anyway, so I think that will be a permanent substitution for me.  I also halved the recipe because we didn't need a 9x13 pan for my small family.  I followed the recipe exactly other than that.  My family really enjoyed it for a special father's day breakfast.  The top had a nice crunch and the bread was soft.  My son called it "french toast cake" because it had a layer of egg custard on the bottom.  Next time I make it I will probably reduce the eggs to 6 as some other reviewers have suggested.  Easy and delicious.  Thanks for the recipe.

Great recipe. I serve this on Christmas morning. I use Pannetone for the bread and substitute eggnog for the cream. For the last 15 minutes it is baking, I toss on about 1 cup each of tiny (Wymans is good) frozen blueberries and thinly slice canned peaches. It's a huge, huge hit! I brought this to work and now I am an office star!!!

Love, Love, Love this recipe.
My suggestion:  I dip each piece of bread in the egg mixture, like regular french toast, rather than pour it over.  That way I don't have any "dry" spots.  If there is any egg mixture left over, I just pour that over the bread.
Enjoy!

I find it quite funny how people review recipes, like "This is great, but only if you make it completely differently than it says and change everything!"  In short, this is wonderful as written, and if you feel you must monkey with things, for whatever reason, then it stands up well to a lot of variation.  To say you "must" do this or "must" do that is pretty much ridiculous, because it's a matter of personal taste, so people put off by those type of reviews and simply ignore them with full confidence.  I've made this a number of times with a significant number of variations, all turned out well.  I personally cut the amount of butter in the glaze, simply because it's already up there on the calorie scale, though I will admit it tastes better if you make it as written.

In a frenzy the night before one of my daughters' birthday celebrations when the whole world was coming over for breakfast, I happened on this recipe which was an amazing, delightful taste experience for the whole family!  Even people who usually turn up their noses at French Toast were asking for seconds.  Considering how easy the preparation was, I could not say more about how great the results were.

Made this for brunch and they came out great.  I did follow the suggestions of others and reduced the eggs and liquid. I also turned them over once they were in the fridge for a couple of hours.  As other suggested I would recommend cutting the bread between 1 1/2 and 2 inches thick.  This was a home run with my family!

I made this for my husband and son for our Father's Day breakfast before heading out to watch a baseball game. We loved it!  After telling my family about it, the are wanting me to make it for our next get together.  I did take the advise of others and dipped the bread inot the mixture an flipped the bread half way through cooking. I have a gas stove and it took about 15-minutes longer to cook.  Will definately make again.  Thanks for the recipe.

Thanks to all the advice from the past reviewers.  I also cut the recipe to 6 eggs, 1 cup milk, and 1 cup 1/2 and 1/2.  I warmed the cut french toast (1 1/2 inches thick) to remove the moisture prior to assembling the dish.  I used a bigger dish -- didn't like the sound of it bubbling into the oven!  I also included a teaspoon of nutmeg and cinnamon.  After the ingredients soaked for several hours, I flipped the bread.  The next day I baked for 20 minutes -- removed from the oven, turned the bread, and THEN added the butter/sugar mixture with chopped pecans and baked for another 20-25 minutes.  Frankly, it didn't look like it was going to be good at all, but turned out delicious.  It was not too soggy. I will bake this again, but think I can do without the topping -- too much sugar!

This was really good.  I made it for my birthday brunch, but didn't have time to make the syrup, so I just used maple syrup instead.  Also, I turned the peices half way, and baked for a total of 40 minutes, and reduced the cream and eggs as recommended by some reviewers, and I can't imagine it would be better with more liquid.  People raved about it.  My only complaint is that I didn't make enough, and only had a bite or two left by the time I made my plate up!  Several people asked for the recipe.

As suggested by someone else, I reduced number of eggs to 6 and milk to 1 cup, and the french toast was excellent!  After the required time it looked as if it was not finished baking, but after letting it rest it settled down - almost tastes like a sticky bun.  Company loved it for Easter brunch!

This was just ok.  It was pretty soggy but the flavor was good.  More than likely won't make again since regular french toast is faster and better.

I followed the suggestions in the reviews to lower the number of eggs and amounts of milk and cream.  This was great!  I used 6 eggs, 1 c. skim milk, and 1 c. fat free half and half.  I had many requests for the recipe.

Wow!  This was great!  I really didn't know what to expect because of the mixed reviews.  I used more half and half, less milk and more cinnamon (I can't give measurements as I did a splash here and pinch there).  I sliced the bread about 1 1/2 inches thick and turned the bread after about an hour of soaking in the egg mixture.  The sugar mixture really makes this dish. It puffed up while baking and smelled wonderful!  

I bit of advice, the inside of the toast is a custardy..it reminded me of a bread pudding.  Regardless, it's really good!

I followed the advice of CZARDAS.  This was the best french toast I've EVER had! I used a large sheet pan and laid each piece of bread flat.  I cut both the milk, half & half and eggs as suggessted by CZARDAS. I flipped the bread to let both sides soak.  When it came out of the oven the next morning... it appeared a soggy at first but after it sat and cooled for a few minutes it was perfect. Every guest loved this recipe and wanted seconds.

Great recipe. I prepared a smaller portion. I also added nutmeg which gave it a great flavor and aroma. Will make it again.

I love making this recipe and it's allways a big hit.
I bake it in a larger dish and usually use Challah bread sliced at least 1" thick. I never have problems with it being soggy. Sometimes I mix in some frozen berries as well.

Well, what can I saw.  The reviewers were right, too much liquid, suggested pan too small.  The liquid spilled over and soon flames were coming out of my oven. I almost called the fire dept!  It took hours for the smoke to leave the house.  The french toast escaped injury - while tasty it was too soggy.  Would I make it again?  Not sure -- if I am willing to risk burning down the house.

Extremely disappointed with this recipe.  If I could give 0 stars, I would. The quantity of liquid is too much for the quantity of bread.  The top of the dish looked beautiful with a wonderful carmel color, but the inside of the dish was a mushy, mealy texture. Was hoping for a great breakfast idea to make on Sunday mornings to help with the morning rush for church, but not so.  From the raves reviews, thought it would be a great dish, but it was a unappealing, nasty mess of mush. Would have been better off making French toast the old fashioned way.

I just came back to this recipe because I keep giving my printouts away to people who beg for it!  I've been making this for over a year and realized I never rated it.  This recipe puts regular French toast to shame!  I've made it as per the original recipe and I've also made modifications I've read in other reviews, namely reducing the egg by 1 or 2 and reducing the liquid by half a cup.  If you cut the bread slices thicker, use more egg and milk.  I've never had it get wet/soggy with the original liquid measurements, just more eggy and custardy.  Reducing the milk/egg resulted in something more close to classic French toast....still very, very good.  I'm making it tonight and can't wait till morning!!

Like some other reviewers, I modified this a bit, but it still came out just so-so.  In order to fit the whole sliced loaf in the pan, you need to layer the bread. I changed the brown sugar topping and heated 1 cup brown sugar and about 4T of real maple syrup.  I baked lightly covered with foil for 20 minutes, then removed foil for final 20.  The bread will rise while baking, which means the brown sugar sauce will drip over sides, so do put a cookie sheet underneath.  After removing from oven, you must let this dish rest and set for at least 10-15 minutes before eating (let's the egg set and avoids mouth burns).  Even with these changes, the kids rated this 3 stars, hubby wouldn't eat it, and I'm hopeful it will reheat OK because there's LOTS left over.

Made this for Father's day and it was a hit! Served it with cherry pie topping for the top.  I also only used 6 eggs, and followed another reviewers tip of "dipping" each piece into the mix rather than soaking it in the pan. It turned out more crunchy and less soggy, which is exactly what I wanted.

Great!  Used a 10X14 baking dish.  1 cup whole milk, 1 cup half & half, and 2 tsp cinnamon.  Also, only used half the butter/brown sugar mixture and it was plenty sweet.  It was not mushy at all...perfect!

I took the most helpful advice on this one, using 6 eggs and just 1 cup of milk. We all thought it was delicious, and just the way we like our french toast! I would make this recipe again. Thank you!

I think this is the BEST idea!  It has saved me so much time and my family just LOVES IT!  I use day old white bread and always try to pick up some day old cinnamon bread from my bakery to mix in.  I cut it in chunks and also layer some melted butter and syrup in between the layers.  FABULOUS!  Great to make the night before too so you can just pop it in the oven in the AM.

This was a hit.  As many suggested I cut down on the eggs (six) and milk & half & half (1 cup of each).  I used a 9 x 13 and an 8 X 8 pan.  It was nice to hear the compliments.  Thanks for this one.

This turned out soft and eggy and boiled over in the oven.  The flavor was wonderful, however, so if you do decide to make this I recommend using 6 eggs and less 1/2 and 1/2 as another reviewer suggested.  Also, be sure to place your pan on a baking sheet so it doesn't boil over.  I won't be making this again, however, I think it was too soft.

This is a great brunch recipe that I have been making for a few years.Some reviews call it mushy with undercooked apples.The apples should be sliced thin and the bread should not be fresh or it will become mushy.

This tastes great but a few modifications were neccessary.  From other reviewers, cutting down the milk/cream part to 2 cups and using only 6 eggs was a good suggestion. I used evaporated milk instead of cream or milk, added 1 tsp. of cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. allspice and the french toast turned out perfect.  My family loved this recipe and will certainly make it again for guests.

Excellent recipe..be wary if you are health conscience though!!  Very fattening..  Treat yourself-you are worth it! I used 2 cups heavy cream/milk  instead of half and half in the egg mixture(all I had on hand)and only used 6 eggs and made it the morning of-I just let the egg mixture soak for like an hour or so-turning halfway through to let both sides get a good soak- before topping with the butter and brown sugar mixture and I didn't even pour all of the butter mixture on top of it.  Very sweet and very yummy.  No butter or syrup required to have with these.  Kinda reminded me of a cinnamon bun! To those giving bad reviews because of the sogginess-that's what baked french toast is suppose to be like- make it on a skillet if you are looking for stiff and crispy french toast.

Yum!  This was very good.  I made a few changes per previous reviews (1 cup of milk, 1 cup of half-and-half), and I also broiled the bread (unsliced) for a few minutes per side.  I've never had crispy french toast, but with all the "too soggy" reviews I thought a slight crisp to the bread wouldn't hurt.  I brought the dish to a ladies' bible study group and they all loved it!  A few even asked for the recipe.  Oh, and I sprinkled some powdered sugar on top.  YUM!  :)

I made this for Thanksgiving brunch.
The only thing I did differently was substituted a loaf of PANNETONE (Italian Christmas bread w/ raisins and candied orange peel) for the baguette.  It was DIVINE!  Everyone loved it.  I served a pitcher of maple syrup and it was more like a bread pudding.  Easy and elegant.  Make it for any special brunch!

Ignore all negative reviews, these were the best!  I actually used a 9x13 and a pie dish.  I only used 6 eggs and 1 cup each of milk and half-n-half.  They tasted exactly like sticky buns, without all of the work!

The first time I made this, it came out soggy. So I tried it again, but I used regularly sliced whole wheat bread. The key is to pour enough of the egg/milk/etc mixture to barely cover the thin bread slices. It will soak it all up the next morning so don't pour too much. Needless to say, it baked perfectly! Also, generously butter the pan or else the bread will stick to it.

MMmmmmmmmmm....this was really delicious! I made this today for a family brunch, and it was a hit. There was only one little piece left at the end, everyone had seconds. I only used 6 eggs, and I used 1.5 cups of egg nog in place of the milk. I also used maple syrp instead of corn syrup...YUMMY!

This was a HUGE hit with the family! I used French Bread, but was concerned about other comments saying it could be soggy, so I cut back on the milk (not half-n-half) to 1 cup, which was perfect! I also sprinkled liberally with cinnamon before covering with the brown sugar mixture.  They simply LOVED it.  The 9X13 pan served 5 people with nice portions (everyone went back for 2nds)! The brown sugar gave it such a wonderful tasty topping. WOW - this was fantastic! Everyone said this was a 5+ star recipe! Thanks!

This was very sweet.  It smelled wonderful while cooking, but it was ok.  I was out of milk, so I used water and I couldn't tell the difference.  I felt that the light corn syrup would make it very sweet, so I left that out, but turns out, it was still sweet even w/o the syrup!  Anyhow, I wouldn't make this again.  The classic french toast recipe on martha stewarts site is much better (w/ almost identical ingredients) and always recieves rave reviews.

This was so good!  My husband makes the best french toast, but even he says this is the best he has ever had!  I made it for Christmas morning along with some other recipes from this site, and this was the first to go.  Next time I will double the recipe.  The adults love this as much as the kids!  And it so EASY!

This turned out too soggy on the bottom and too sweet.  Next time I make it I will omit 1 cup milk and 1/3 cup brown sugar.  It was a great idea and I will try it again.

Fabulous!!!!
I love this recipe. I have made this several times and most recently screwed it up by using 1/3 cup of brown sugar instead of 1 1/3 cup of brown sugar and everyone still raved about it! I notices but no one else seemed to.
This is my first review of anything and for good reason!

This recipe was everything that the other reviewers said it was...DELICIOUS!  As per other reviews, I reduced the eggs and liquid.  Before baking I transfered to a baking sheet lined with -parchment to ensure even baking and easy cleanup.  It puffed up beautifully and was a snap to cleanup.  Before serving, I sprinked with powered sugar and served with orange slices...great presentation..Everyone LOVED it!

I was a bit hesitant to try this for company, but I did...came out great!   I did cut back on liquid ingredients by about 1/3rd.  Based on all of the previous ratings, I allowed the bread to soak up the batter for about 15 minutes, then I poured off the excess the night before, rather than waiting until just prior to baking.  The bread was custardy on the bottom, and crispy on top -- delicious!  Because we all have sweet teeth around here, I kept the syrup recipe in tact, and threw in a few handfuls of pecans...the general reaction from the table was YUMMMMMM...  This one is a definite keeper!

Wonderful.....tasty....and a super easy crowd pleaser! CUT THE MILK DOWN TO 3/4 or 1 CUP (or it's too soggy in the middle).  I have fixed this several times now with no problems since I decreased the milk. Loved the fact that it makes it's own syrup right in the pan!!! Everyone inhales it. I serve it with a dallop of whipped cream on top, and a dash of cinnamon.  It's as pretty as it is delicious!

Watch out because this really puffs up when you put it in the oven.  My overflowed because of the syrup that you put on top. A little big more egg consistency than I thought it would be.  Maybe next time I will cut bread thicker and use a little more.  Worth trying though.

Our family loved this recipe!  I did move the casserole to the lower rack for the last 10 minutes so the bottom wasn't quite so soggy.  It is great and we will have it again.

I made this for breakfast Christmas morning with a couple of substitutions. I decreased the eggs to 6 -like the one reviewer said so it wasn’t mushy- extra cinnamon and thick slices of challah bread. It was AAAHHHHHMAAAZING! Everyone could not stop eating it! Thinking of giving trays of this out to family when we host Christmas Eve for their Christmas morning breakfast.

My head was spinning after reading the reviews - but it came out great!!!  Here's what I went with:  6 eggs, 2 cups 1/2 & 1/2, a little more than 1/4 cup cinnamon, cut bread diagonally 1 1/2 - 2 inches thick, dunked each piece in egg mixture then poured rest over bread.  Let it soak overnight and next morning flip all pieces and bake covered 20-30 mins and then flip again before pouring sauce over and bake uncovered for remainder.  Used maple syrup instead of corn syrup.

I have to agree with the reviews. It was dry on top and soggy on the bottom. I will adjust my recipe to suit my phamily next time. Thank you for sharing just the same. Because we makes changes does not mean we do not appreciate the recipe. Thanks gain.

Made it per the recipe and it was fabulous! Cooked extra 10 min for the soggy middle issue but let sit for 10 min after taking out of the oven & everything was great. Very hot so it needs to cool before serving.  Really more like a bread pudding than frenchtoast but would be awesome holiday breakfast for a group. Mimosas, fresh fruit and you're set. Next time might try adding bit of brandy & cream cheese for some of the butter.

This has a good flavor and is easy to make, but it is too moist. I even left out some of the egg/milk mix because I thought it was too much, and then it was still very mushy. I will make this again but with probably half the milk & half and half. I also added 1/2 cup chopped pecans before pouring on the caramel glaze.

Made this for New Year's Day breakfast. We absolutely loved it!! I made it exactly as written except for using 2 c half and half and turning the bread over in the dish before baking. It came out perfect. Not too mushy. I think the extra milk might have made it a bit soggy. I topped it with chopped pecans before baking. Thank you for this delicious recipe!

After reading reviews went with 7 eggs, no milk, 2 cups whipping cream and maple syrup instead of corn syrup.  Also flipped bread after a couple hours of the overnight stay.  Cooked 20 minutes, flipped and added coating for final 20 minutes.

Was good but too sweet for our liking.  Swedish pancakes next Christmas.

I can't exactly "rate" this recipe yet. But I liked the way it read. As others did, I made a couple of modifications. First, since it is Christmas, I like to splurge on fat content in my food. We all know that fat makes the food taste better, so I substituted heavy whipping cream for the 1/2 and 1/2 (if I was on a dairy farm, I would have used the sweet cream). Secondly, my kids, in particular, my son has a healthy appreciation for cinnamon (he is a savory eater, but cinnamon is his thing to mitigate "sweetness"); a 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon didn't seem to be enough, so I subsequently put in a full teaspoon. Bottom line: 1.5 cups heavy whipping cream and 1 tsp cinnamon are my modifications. I will see what it tastes like later today. Merry Christmas all!

I first made this for my daughter and her husband.  I had gone to stay with them for 3  weeks when they had my first grand child.  It was a hit, probably took some of the sting out of my staying for so long.

I've tried several overnight French toast recipes and this is by far the best. I like to add blueberries on top, just before pouring the corn syrup mixture on top. Yummy!

This would have been a good recipe with some changes. I tasted more of the egg and cream than the french toast itself.  I would reduce the number of eggs to 6 and add just one cup of half and half and a bit less milk.  I'd also cut the bread a bit thicker than 1 inch.  I am going to look at a similar recipe that calls for generally the same ingredients but fewer milky ingredients.

Amazing! I made this for my family to wake up to on Christmas morning and everyone was absolutely loving it!
Next time I would just use less of the egg/milk mixture because the bottom of the french toast was a little runny, and I like things more well-done. But if you like things more runny, leave it the way it is, because I got NO complaints!!
De-Lish!!!

EXCELLENT! I did make changes per reviews. I used 6 eggs, 2 cups half & half (no milk), 2 tsp vanilla and 1/4 tsp of cinnamon. I only soaked about 6 hours (made for dinner). Next time I will slice bread in 2" slices (as another reviewer suggested) so all slices fit in pan. Sit out for a bit while heating oven, poured sauce over and baked at 400 for about 30 minutes. Lowered to 350 and let bake until it no longer looked soggy. All 7 family members loved it!

I add chocolate chips, either milk or dark, toasted pecans, cinnamon, an 8oz. cream cheese cut in chunks - any or all of these ingredients. Sometimes I sub the plain french bread with pepperidge farm's cinnamon swirl or raisin.

I had this at my sisters house for our Christmas breakfast. She didn't make any modifications. I didn't know what it was, I just ate some and it was great so I asked her for the recipe. That's when I found out it was french toast. I've read many of the reviews and seen that lot's of people are making changes to the recipe because it comes out too wet. Well maybe so for french toast. When I made it at home I made one modification, I changed the name to "Bead Pudding" and served it for desert! It tastes just like what we get at Chef Point Cafe just outside of Fort Worth, Texas. Awesome!

First off it calls for WAY too much liquid, which I mixed as directed, but I didn't use even half on a loaf and a half of sliced bread. I just lightly greased a sheet of parchment paper placed inside my pan so sticking wasn't an issue. No matter how long I let it cook 10min longer than suggested but it still never toasted, just remained a soggy mess. I even tried to pan fry it after 40min out of desperation because I was using this recipe to feed people a New Years breakfast and it was just a mess!!

Oh yeah; it was good. Ended up using the changes Michelle Mullis suggested. Only change I made from there was cutting that recipe in half to share between my wife and I. I ate most of it.

Yes I have prepared this dish quite a few times and I love it as do my guests!  I make it with Croissant rolls that I cut in half instead of French bread!  Excellent!

I made this for Christmas brunch it was a hit! I did a few of the tweaks that users recommended and it was perfect! Dried the French bread slightly the night before in the oven on 200 on both sides for about 20 minutes total. I used six or seven eggs and I cut the milk down to one cup.  I used a teaspoon and a half of cinnamon. And I used maple syrup instead of light syrup for the topping.  I flipped the bread halfway through the overnight soaking process so it went completely through on both sides.

I made the alterations to the recipe as I saw fit having read the previous reviews.  I used 6 eggs and  two cups of half and half - these were the only changes I made  other than baking  a longer period of required and not pouring the sugar/butter mixture until 2/3 into the cooking process.  It tasted great!   Def will make again for brunch.

I make this every Christmas, it's a new tradition. Don't worry about the reviews, everybody has different tastes, likes and dislikes. The type of bread you use *will* make a difference. A softer bread (softer, not fresher, there's a difference) will absorb the egg better. If you like your French toast very eggy, leave recipe as is. If you like it drier, decrease the liquids significantly.  Try it and figure out how to make it your own!

I made this using the 6 eggs & 2 cups half and half, suggested by another reviewer.  It was great and not soggy.  The entire family loved it.  However,  I first tried to use a 9by13 pyrex dish, but all the slices didn't fit.  I transferred my slices to a larger casserole dish that I have and all the slices fit.   I'm glad I ended up using the larger dish because the bread puffs up while baking and some of the sauce spilled over the side.  I can only imagine what happens with a smaller pyrex size.  The other change we'll make for next time is to make half the sauce. The dish was too sweet for my family.  I felt like I served dessert instead of breakfast.   Will use half of the sauce next time and top with pecans to try it a little differently.

Rave reviews from a teenage sleepover party.  I cut the bread a bit thin and had to use a 13x9 and an 8x8.  Even using both dishes I was upset that one bubbled over and burnt in the bottom of the oven.  Next time I will use a bit less liquid and a taller casserole.  Other than that the flavor was great.  Thanks for posting

I made it for Thanksgiving morning and it was devoured- even by my husband, who is a maple syrup purist. He loved it just the way it was. It even reheated pretty well! A winner (but with challah)!

We made it today and loved it! I read many reviews about it "being soggy" so I took one person advice and cut bigger pieces and dipped the pieces instead of pouring it over. I also used two loaves of bread with the recipe above. I made double the sauce though(It probably could have just been 1 1/2 instead of doubled)

Absolutely love this recipe!!! It's so versatile....I love swapping in light eggnog for the cream, and I always use egg whites vs eggs. Very yummy, but very high cal and fat ?? I mostly use challah bread, but today am trying with potuguese sweetbread. I'm sure it will be equally as yummy. Lastly, I find the sauce holds up best with either one of two things...adding it half way through cooking, or doubling butter/maple syrup and keeping the brown sugar as is. Most times it takes more than an hour to cook enough, and that turns the sauce into a crust. If you like a wet custard type french toast you may not have this problem so much, but my kiddos won't go for that lol. Happy Baking!

Meh.  It didn't turn out as fabulous as I was envisioning it would. I only put in 1 cup milk and 1 cup creme, and although they weren't soggy, it didn't brown the way French toast normally does when you fry them in a pan.  I guess I should've greased my pan too because I couldn't flip them over like some people did.  I ended up putting butter in a pan and frying up my french toast for a bit.  For the sauce, I melted butter, put in sliced granny smith apples and 1/3C brown sugar.  I think I'll just stick to frying it up in a pan than baking.  I like the soaking overnight idea though.

I made this but tweaked a bit..I mixed the batter (no cornstarch or half and half) in a bowl first..broke up some French and Challah bread and put in my pyrex and poured the mixture over top. I didn't prep the night before...made it for a family bruch. I added brown sugar clumps over top with extra cinammon...turned out amazing. When I make regular french toast..I use flavored coffee creamer..soooo delish. Will do the same with this next time. Oh..and I used egg  beaters...I'm sure there are too many ways to tweak this..but still a hit nontheless!!!

This is fabulous!  I added about 1/8 c.-1/4 c grandmarnier liquer and grated orange rind on top. Use whatever amount you feel comfortable with.  This is a real adult breakfast.  Everyone always asks for more

Even used other reviews to tweak this and it didn't work out. It basically turned out to be mushy bread with a hard candy coating. Don't know what happened but so much for not wanting to waste left over Italian bread!!!

Had to cube the bread after reading all the reply's from everyone. It was to much like a bread pudding for me. Not really a breakfast french toast. The flavor was yummy but still a bread pudding and not a French toast.

This is similar to the Cajun Pain Perdu (leftover bread). We add a Tbsp of Gran Marnier to the egg mixture to give it a kicked up lemony taste!

I have made this for years -- our family calls it "The Yummy Breakfast".  I make it exactly as is - but use a loaf of challah and bake it for one hour.  I don't think you need to adjust the liquid at all if you bake it longer -- maybe it is the challah too.... My sister substitutes Stonewall Kitchen Butter Pecan Syrup for the light corn syrup and swears this makes it even better.  It is the perfect breakfast for Christmas morning.  So easy!

I've been making this recipe for 15 years for Xmas morning brunch and my "kids" still love it.  I don't feel like cooking a big meal today so we"re having breakfast for supper, french toast and ham with asparagus.

Delicious recipe! Be sure to put a "drip pan" under the pan of french toast as it can drip over the side....I caught my oven on fire once with the dripping syrup! But it is so good!

Although this was tasty, it was not French toast to me. This is bread pudding – even with the reduced liquid.  I am not a big fan of mushy so I will stick with regular French toast.

Did change it - so based on that I loved it. Used thicker slices - about 1.5-2". Also, used only 6 eggs, 1 1/4 cups of milk and 1 cup of cream. Not too sweet. Delicious.

Update 11/14: Made this again. I used about 2lbs of day old homemade bread with the original recipe ingredients. Amazing again. I would use half of the ingredients for 1lb of bread.

Update 6/17: I made a bigger batch - 2lbs - same amount of liquid. This is best when the bread lays flat.  I will use two pans next time to bake in oven with the caramel sauce.

This was so yummy!  I made a couple changes.  I used Challah bread instead of french bread and cut them into cubes.  I didn't have time to let the bread sit out over night and dry out like I've done with other recipes because I like that added crunch so I toasted bread cubes at 350 until they were golden brown and some crispy (maybe 10-15 minutes).  I followed the rest of the recipe nearly exact only adding 1/3 cup of honey and 1.5 cups of frozen blueberries.  When I  melted the butter and brown sugar I probably only used a 1/3 of a cup (if that) and drizzled it over the top prior to baking.  It was fantastic!!!  Not to sweet and the perfect amount of crunch and softness.  I got loads of complements on this dish and have been asked to give my friends the recipe.

I really don't like giving bad reviews, but we didn't care for this at all. It was too eggy, and I reduced the eggs to six. With the sauce that goes on top, it really wasn't that sweet to me. Don't think I will make this again, sorry.

We made this for Easter brunch and it was amazing! We made it exactly as written except that we didn't have any corn syrup so just used an equal amount of real maple syrup. It puffed up and browned beautifully. It's nice to do most of the prep the night before. We'll definitely make this again for a special occasion.

So delicious, almost like a bread pudding for breakfast. I quadrupled the recipe and served it for snack to fifty 3-4 year olds. Almost all of them liked it and their parents liked it even more. It feels like you are adding too much of the butter/sugar sauce, but trust the amount the recipe gives!

I was excited to try this... I used the modified recipe as most reviewers did - 6 eggs , 2 cups half and half and glad I did; the consistency was perfect. I can't imagine all that extra liquid. 
I enjoy sweet things but I must say this is very sweet and heavy, def not able to eat a lot.  
I also read a review where someone mentioned sticking to bottom and if I ever make this again I'd either use non stick spray or wax paper as it does stick a bit.  Overall it was good I just didnt get that amazing feeling like many of reviews.

My family loved this on Christmas morning. I added walnuts to the topping. Really can't be saved for leftovers. Not that there was much. Bread becomes too soggy.

only used 6 eggs, and followed reviews and flipped half way.  Think if I had diced the bread it would have been even better.  Turned out pretty good though, will make again.

So delicious!  I did as a few reviewers did and decreased the liquid (2 c. half & half) and used my biggest baking dish (10x15).  I also added a couple of shakes of nutmeg.  Other than that, I followed the recipe as stated.  YUMMY!

Disapointed.  First, this should be called Caramel French Toast.  I wasn't at all expecting such a strong caramel flavor.  Secondly, the caramel topping became hard and chewy and stuck in my teeth.  And lastly, way, way too sweet.  I was not at all worried about the reviews saying this was too sweet.  I'm someone who loves pancakes to practically float in maple syrup.  But this was far too sweet for me!  I'm not sure I even want to experiment with the recipe since it was so far from the regular baked french toast I was looking for.

Well just tried this yummy recipe with a few tweaks of my own. I only used milk as that's all I had on hand. I also  used monkey bread instead of fb and only let the bread soak for about 30 min. Came out Perfect!!!!!

By far one of my favorite make-ahead breakfasts!  This is super yummy and all of my friends and family love it.  I have made it for special occassions many times and all my guests rave about it.  I love that you can make it ahead of time.  It is very rich so a little goes a long way.  I make it exactly the way the recipe calls and have loved it each time!

The original is great.
I substituted almond extract on one batch and cut the butter to 1/2 cup and added 1/4" cubed ham on another.. Go ahead and experiment...

Not completely satisfied with the recipe.  Taste/Smell was GREAT.  I do not like the soggyness.  Next time I will try just dipping it and baking it, instead of soaking it!  Great Recipe!

I made this recipe as listed (I did flip the bread before baking) and while the flavor was nice and sweet, the consistency was too loose for my taste. It was almost like a bread pudding and I was looking for more of a french toast. If I make this again I will try taking out some liquid to see if that helps. It may also work better with day old bread.

followed the exact recipe, only cut my bread slicer a big thicker.  Still came out horribly soggy!  somehow there is too much liquid in this.  Threw away the whole thing.  Not sure I even want to attempt this again.

Won't be making this again. I used the cut down recipe of 6 eggs and no milk (only half and half) - thank goodness as any more liquid and it surely would have been mush! The kids didn't like it at all and my husband and I didn't much care for it either. Texture is definitely more bread pudding like. My stomach is still upset by it :-(  Paula Deen has almost the same recipe so I was sure it would be great. I'll stick to regular french toast.

my daughter and I love this recipe. The second time I made it, I replaced the corn syrup with pure maple syrup. It was still excellent. Oh, and i haven't had half and half either time i made it. I used almond milk with my egg batter. Awesome recipe !

I loved it!  I used a variation (6 eggs, all half-and-half) and it was great, but I think the original would have been even better.  My biggest problem was squeezing the bread into a 9x13; next time, I'm going to use two smaller pans so all the slices keep their nice shape.  VERY RICH!  And if kids aren't used to 'egg' tastes in their french toast, they might complain (even with 6 eggs), but I ADORED the flavor and wished I'd used all 8 eggs.

I took the other reviewers suggestion and drained some of the egg prior to soaking in the fridge.  Turned out perfect.  I did sub maple syrup for the corn syrup b/c I didn't have any but it turned out great.  I served with sliced strawberries.  Definitely making this every year.

This tasted good, but not enough to deal with the mess it produced.  I followed the recipe to a T.  It was pretty easy to prepare.  A common 9X13 was not high enough on the sides to keep everything from bubbling over onto the oven.  I had drained out some of the egg mixture, but the last 30 minutes it cooked my entire house was filled with smoke and smelled terrible for the company that I had over.  The taste did not knock anyone's socks off to deal with that again.

Amazing!! Made this for my hubby's birthday and got rave reviews from the whole family. To lower the fat I used egg beaters, skim milk, fat free half & half, and halved the syrup. Also doubled the vanilla and cinnamon. Leftovers were just as delish this morning =)

Absolutely delicious!!!!! I used Texas Toast instead of french bread, but that was the only change. The "caramel" sauce was decitant. I have some very picky eaters and it was a huge hit! It boiled over and made my oven a huge mess, but totally worth it! :)

This is perfect, and there's no need to change anything.  I've been making it for a few years now and my coworkers beg me to bring it to work all the time.  The only thing I do differently (and just to make it easier on me) is ask the bakery dept at the grocery store to slice the bread for me and I generally choose an italian-type bread.  That way the slices are nice and thin and seem to soak up the egg mixture evenly.  This is one of my favorite recipes! And I love that it is SO EASY!

I made this recipe this morning for my in-laws, and it was a huge hit. I followed the advice of one of the other reviewers and only used 2 c. of half and half and 6 eggs, and it was delicious. I debated over making the sauce or just serving it with regular syrup, but I am SO glad I went ahead and made it. It was so yummy and caramel-y! Thanks so much for the recipe. Its a keeper!

This was wonderful! I made it for Christmas breakfast and everyone loved it.  I did follow some of the hints and only used 6 eggs and 1 cup milk.  I also dipped the bread in the egg mixture then spooned the remaining mixture over the top.  This will definitly be something I make again.

From the reviews, I expected much more than this.  It was good, but not much different than what I make on my own.

Made several times with day old and fresh bread, variations with cranberries, blueberries, cream cheese and sasuage, orange extract, and sometimes raisens. Simple and special, and fun.

I make this for Christmas morning and when we have over night guests, it's so easy and delicious! I also make sure to keep printed copies available because I can't make it without someone needing the recipe.

Big hit at work! I wanted something easy to make but yummy to eat, this was it! Went quickly at work and I got rave reviews.  I used all the eggs and liquid, because I wanted to pile the pan high as possible with bread so there'd be enough for everybody. It goes so quick next time I'm going to have to make 2 pans.

This was fantastic!  I used almost an entire loaf of french bread, but reduced all other ingredients to 9 servings so there was less liquid in the pan.  I forgot to add the vanilla to the egg mixture, so I added it to the brown sugar mix.  I think I prefer it this way because the vanilla flavor is present, and I am a huge vanilla fan.

This recipe truly boasts everything we love about french toast. The a.m. sauce that is added tastes just like maple syrup on french toast. Don't change a thing and follow the directions - you won't go wrong. Breakfast is a hard meal to serve to a crowd - this accompanied by a quiche and some fresh fruit takes the hard work out of a big breakfast without compromising taste and quality. My grandparents love it as much as my children & everyone in between!

This recipe is great, as is! The ONLY thing I do differently is that I cube the bread and perhaps use a bigger pan than stated. The only reason I cube the bread is that it makes the casserole easier to eat and serve. I have made this for many different group meetings and it is always a hit.

I thought this was really yummy, like a custard base with french toast on top.  A couple people thought it was too sweet.   I was able to fit more bread slices in the dish by cutting them straight across instead of on an angle.  I had six slices that wouldn't fit into the pan , so next time I will slice them thicker.  I did not have light corn syrup, so I just used 3 t. water to thin the syrup. Next time I will increase the vanilla and decrease the syrup.

I made this recipe but I cut it in half for the three of us.
This is very tasty but as many others have said it's also a really moist Baked French Toast.  I thought it could use revising so I will start by reducing the milks by a 1/4 cup each.  
I already extended the baking time by a minimum of ten minutes.
Other modifications I made:  1 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp vanilla added to the syrup mixture.
This is so tasty even if it was on the moist side.  I will be making this dish again.
****120810  I baked it again this evening but this time used an apple loaf and a blueberry loaf and it worked out well.  ONLY change I made to the recipe -used cinnamon in the syrup, cream that I had on hand instead of half & half and baked it for about 25 minutes longer so it wouldn't be soggy.  It was perfect, edges more 'done' and center a little softer but not quite mushy.
This is a great dish for day old French loaf.

This is going to become our Christmas morning tradition from now on. SO delicious! I used 1 pint of half & half and omitted the milk. I refrigerated it overnight, and in the morning, flipped the slices over before baking. They turned out perfectly delicious - not too much liquid. This one is going in the family cookbook!

I make this on Christmas Eve every year to be enjoyed Christmas morning.  A similar recipe was given to me by a co-worker, originally, but I lost it.  So I found this one and have made it ever since.  My mom says it reminds her of caramel rolls/sticky buns.  It simply rocks.

I made this for our Christmas morning brunch and it was amazing!  I did modify it some based on the reviews of others and I'm glad I did.  I used only 6 eggs, 1 1/4 cup milk, and 1 cup cream.  Then I dipped the bread and poured some of the remaining liquid over the top in a 11x14 inch dish (I didn't use all the liquid - that was too much).  I also had to bake it for about 45 minutes, but the end result was wonderful.  I'm now in charge of making this an annual Christmas morning brunch tradition.

This is delicious!  Used the suggestions of CZardus (sp) with 6 eggs and larger pan, his idea for the cream to milk ratio and turned over after several hours.  In the morning, I sprinkled extra cinnamon over all the slices before baking.  How easy - and still left time for visiting with our Christmas Eve.  Thanks so much for sharing this.

I took the advice of other reviewers and reduced the liquid. I also made it healthier by using fat free half and half, and 1% milk. It turned out PERFECTLY. It was a hit at brunch and everyone wanted the recipe. I also love that you make it the night before--so easy! I will DEFINITELY make this again and again.

This was excellent.  Very simple to make and it was very tasty.  I used a 9x13 pan but it REALLY bubbled over so I would suggest putting a water-filled pan on a lower rack to catch anything that may boil over as it bakes.

I'm giving this 4 stars only because I personally didn't like it but everyone else did so maybe it's just me.  I thought it was a little too sweet and the texture was not really something I enjoy... I don't like bread pudding and I thought it was a bit like that.  But again, everyone else loved it.

This turned out like wet, mushy bread. I ended up throwing it out and going out to eat. It probably would have been good if there wasn't so much liquid in it because it smelled delicious. But, I dont think I will try it again.

This recipe would have only received one star if not for its potential to be adjusted.  I always make an effort to follow the original recipe exactly before using suggestions from others, as sometimes those suggestions actually ruin things.  This recipe, however, did not turn out well at all.  The bread was, literally, mush once it had completed cooking, and keeping it in longer did not solve that problem.  It was completely inedible--the first genuinely bad recipe I have tried from this site, in fact.  The flavor was good, so I imagine with a little work and reading, I can find the proper combination of ingredients to make this turn out well.  We'll see what happens, but the original recipe is not good at all...

Made this for a brunch and everyone loved it.  I made a few alterations.  I used 1 1/2 loaves italian bread (1.5lbs.  After I poured the egg mixture over the bread, I turned over the bread so it was coated evenly.  In the morning, I turned the bread over again.  When I made the brown sugar mixture, I added a capful of maple extract and some cinnamon.  Delicious.

This had a very good taste, but I did find it to be a little too soggy. Next time I think I will use stale bread and cut down on the liquid.

I made this recipe over the weekend, and it was to DIE for!! I made it with some cinnamon swirl bread, which I cut to about 1 inch thick. I also took the recommendation of another reviewer and reduced the number of eggs and the amount of 1/2 and 1/2. I will make it again, for SURE!

Terrible. Followed the recipe exactly, After baking 40 mins the frnch toast was soggy, like bread pudding. We even baked it for another hour, and it was still pudding. Had to throw the french toast away!

My family loved this recipe! I also made a few changes,I used 6 eggs and 1 cup of  milk and I cut the bread in cubes and used a 10x13 pan. It was like a bread pudding and not a bit soggy!

I used Challah instead of French bread. After reading the reviews, I also "basted" with the egg mixture before baking to prevent sogginess. It was delicious!

This recipe was awful.  There was way too much liquid and when it was cooked, there were gobs of eggy mixture in between the bread.  The Oven-Baked Caramel French Toast recipe is MUCH better.

I made this for a family brunch and it was not a hit at all, way to mushy, I was so disappointed after reading all the rave reviews. I did just as the recipe said, let it sit overnight, made my slices thick, and they hardend overnight before using them, hoping they would not get soggy.

i made it exactly the way the recipe read.  the taste was very good, but didn't realize how high it would puff up until the smoke alarm went off because of it dripping over the sides onto the bottom of my oven.  next time i will definitely have a cookie sheet underneath it

I have never liked French toast before, but this was great!!  I did turn the bread over half way through baking like others recommended.  Next time I will use a longer dish.

I was hesitant to try this recipe because of all of the modifications that others needed to make but it turned out wonderfully. I did use challah bread as another reviewer suggested and I omitted the milk - I just used 2 cups half and half. The dish did almost have the consistency of bread pudding, but after reading reviews, I was expecting this. The challah bread I bought was fresh so I sliced it in advance and let the bread get 'stale' for a few hours before soaking it with the egg mixture. I used a 11x15 baking dish and it almost bubbled over while baking, foil under the pan is a must. Did not need any additial sweetening (like syrup) but I did garnish with some powdered sugar - it looked and tasted wonderful!

This is such a great recipe to make the night before and then pop in the oven in the morning.  The kids (and adults) loe to watch the bread bubble up - it looks like it's going to burst.  Don't worry once you take it out of the oven it floats back down.  It's so much less time consuming then cinnamon rolls or sticky buns but with a similar taste.

If you're looking for crunchy, traditional French toast, then make it in the skillet! If you like custard, or even flan, then this is the recipe for you! I make it just as the recipe says, and have done so for years. Every time I make it for someone new, they ask for the recipe. We warm leftovers in the skillet, and none ever goes to waste. Every time I have guests, and for every holiday, this recipe makes a victorious appearance. It's economical, too:..8 eggs--$1, some half and half--$1, 2 cups of milk--$1, bread--$1, sugar--$1.

This was soo good. Definitely a "special" type breakfast as it isn't very low fat, but that's what makes it so good. I folloed the recipe exactly but I used 1 1/2 loafs of bread and cut them about 1 1/2" thick. I put it in a big roasting pan and cooked it for the full 40 min and the middles were still a bit mushy so I turned the toast over and baked another 10 or so min and it turned out great. The outside of the bread was all carmelized. I tooped it with toasted peacans and powdered sugar. So yummy!

I followed other reviewers advice and used no milk, 2 cups half and half, and 6 eggs.  I used a couple days old french bread, cubed it and followed the rest of the recipe but adding the sauce half way through cooking time.  I used a 9x13 pan and want to warn you to either use a bigger pan or a drip pan because the sauce seriously bubbled over and my whole house was filled with smoke!  It tasted really good though, kind of like a caramel-ish bread pudding.

I made 6 batches of this recipe for our wedding reception brunch and everyone raved about it! Not a single piece left. I modified it as suggested, using only 6 eggs and 1 cup of milk, but left the recipe otherwise unchanged.

used challah bread, doubled the amount of bread (2 loaves) but used same amount of other ingredients.  did have to layer the bread (2 layers) and use one 9x12 plus one 8x8 pan.  turned out perfect!  will make again.

A VERY sweet version of baked french toast. I used the original recipe, but next time would take the advice of others and reduce the eggs to 6 and milk/half & half to 3 cups total. Mine turned out more like bread pudding or custard. I could probably do with about half of the caramel mixture, too.

Soooo ooey gooey good! Per previous suggestions, I did cut back on the liquid - using only 6 eggs and 1 cup each of the milk and half-and-half. I couldn't fit a whole loaf into a 9x13, either, but it wasn't a problem with the addition of a 9x9. EVERYONE went back for seconds... even my mother said she wouldn't change a thing. That in itself is a rave review! This one is getting laminated.

Absolutely wonderful!  It's very easy to make - no time at all.  My husband and I first had it at a friend's breakfast meeting.  Had to have the recipe and have made it several times since.  I did use less liquid and added the pecans.  This recipe has gone into my "use often" box!!

My husband and I both hated it... It was like mush on the bottom, and I don't understand how you can fit a whole loaf into a 9x13 pan.  It is not possible.  If you let it sit for about 20 minutes the top gets a little crunchy, but the bottom tasted like bread soaked in water.  Maybe I should have layered the bread, but it said nothing in the recipe regarding that. Sorry, but we hated it. This was a total waste of my time.

I made this for Christmas morning. It was absolutely amazing. I prepared it the morning before hand. After putting it together I read some of the reviews about using less liquid. I then spooned out a good 5 or 6 table spoons of liquid. I did not want to spend any time in the morning putting together the brown sugar part,so when I prepared this I made a crumble of butter,brown sugar and flour, mix until crumbly and put it all over top. I then let it sit for the 24 hours and baked it about 1 hour. It came out crispy along the edges of the bread, nice and soft when you cut each piece, it was truly perfect.It was not at all soggy. In fact when I took it out to bake it to me it looked like about 90% of my liquid had been absorbed by the bread before baking. Everyone gobbled this up and 3 people asked for the recipe for their next brunch! No leftovers here. Would definitely make again using the modifications I made.

I wish I would have read the reviews first because this was way too mushy. The taste was good enough, but the texture was way off. If I make this again, I would cut the eggs and liquid in half.

Made this for Mothers Day brunch and it was a huge hit!  I left it in the oven 10 extra minutes and the top was almost a crust while the rest stayed very custard like.  This was delicious!

I made this for Easter Brunch and it was a huge hit!  It was so easy to make and delicious!  I did follow the advice of other reviewers.  I used 7 eggs, 1 cup milk, 1 cup half and half, 2 tsp of cinnamon and I added 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg.  Everyone loved it!

When I decided to make french toast using this recipe, I really thought I was going to end up with something special.  The only surprise in this recipe is the disappointment experienced from the end results.  The top of the toast turned out crispy/crunchy brown, the middle was soggy, and the bottom was eggy and tasted like flan.  Worst of all the glaze mixture seemed to restrain the toast from turning out thick and fluffy because it was so thick and weighed the bread down.  The only reason I gave this recipie 2 stars instead of 1 is because I was glad it didn't stick to my pan after coming out of the oven.  No matter how you cook this recipe, it will never have the flavor and texture of good old fashioned skillet cooked french toast.

I saw the problem with this recipe...it needs to be cut in half. Only 8 oz of bread will fit in a 13x9. So this is what I did- & used real maple syrup instead of corn syrup. Turned out really well. Might want to bake around 30 minutes- might got a little too brown. No need for syrup on top, although I did sprinkle on a little powdered sugar over the top before serving. This will puff up, so cut all the ingredients in half & you will be fine! Oh- I used left-over egg nog in place of the half & half & used 1/4 t. nutmeg instead of cinnamon. Yum!

I was kind of disappointed in this. I served it for Christmas brunch and had a couple problems. I don't think this is supposed to fit into a 9x13 pan. I had to stack the bread in two layers to fit the pan. In the morning, the topping spilled over into the oven smoking out my guests. It turned out kind of mushy. More like bread pudding. The taste was good, but too mushy for my taste. Might make again using 2, 9x13 pans so there is one layer of bread per pan. Line bottom of oven with foil and cook a lot longer.

this was excellent.  I added some shaved almonds to the top before cooking and it gave it a little more texture.

This is a staple in our house and has become tradion for holidays and "special" days.  I've made it for more than 2 years and it's always been enjoyed. Crust on the french bread should help soak up mixture so middle is not so soggy.

I have never made french toast like this, overnight with egg soaking through the bread.  Plus I live overseas where you can't just find "french bread" that is similiar in the US, and there's no such thing as "half and half".  Since I'm a busy mom with two young kids/working from home I had to find something that was very quick and easy to make but also tasty...I used thick sliced wheat bread (if you're in New Zealand like me I used the "toast slice bread")It was honestly perfect, I added apples, some frozen berries...and to save time, I used the commercial maple syrup that my dad recently shipped me...Everyone was very happy and they loved it.  Next time I plan to make the syrup properly.  Just to be on the safe side I used less eggs and milk, but I think next time I'll have no problem using more of the eggs and maybe a little cream. Thanks Laura!

Incredible!  Used 11 x 15 pan.  Substituted 1 1/2c. half-and-half with 1 cup Vanilla Nut coffee creamer and added 2 tsp cognac.  Used slightly less than 2 c. of milk.  Oh my, we loved it.

Made this twice now, both times to rave reviews.  Make sure to use hard, crusty French bread!!!  Also, for some reason I always buy heavy whipping cream, instead of 1/2 and 1/2, but I can't see where that hurts anything.  I also soak the slices of bread in the mixture before placing in the pan, and not quickly either.  The extra liquid I pour over the bread to soak up for the night. This is just a great breakfast.  I really believe the key is to leave that French bread out of the fridge (if you've bought it the day before) and make sure it's from your grocer's bakery, not mass produced.

This recipe was Awsome! I made it for Christmas brunch, so I added some nutmeg. It added great flavor! I added the sauce after it baked for 20 min. then added it. Next time I will add it befor this goes in the oven.  I think it might caramelize better.  I think I will try using eggnog next time insted of milk and cream. Will deffinantly make again!

I tried this recipe this morning and won't make it again. I read the reviews and I halved the eggs and milk. I let it set overnight. The bread did soak up most of the egg mixture. I also baked it for 30 minutes before adding the brown sugar, butter mixture. If you make it I would suggest halving that portion also. It still came out very soggy. The outer portion of the bread was crisp and the center was soggy wet bread. I will not make this again because no one in my family would eat it.

I was sooo disappointed with this dish!  After reading all the rave reviews, I really thought we were in for a treat.  NOT! Gross and disgusting are the best words to describe this dish.  Maybe it's just me, but I don't like my french toast to be so soggy that it's dripping!  YUCK!  I even followed a suggestion by another review and left the dish in the oven a little longer so the top was crispy.  However, that didn't help the fact that everything below that nice crisp top was a soggy mess.  The flavor was good, but after one bite the texture was just too squishy for me to handle in the morning.  Basically, I wasted all those ingrediets and time.  If you like your french toast crispy, please don't make this!  Sorry for being so honest, I just don't want anyone else to make the same mistake I did.....

This turned out perfectly when I tried it for my extended family on Christmas morning.  The topping makes it very rich, but everyone raved about it!  I made mine with a loaf of braided Challah (egg bread) that I baked the day before instead of French bread.  Heavenly!

This is a fantastic recipe!  I agree with some on liquid but I usually make the whole thing and gauge how much I use based on bread density.  If you use all liquid it will be custardy if eaten immediately.  Usually the night before there will be excess liquid in the pan, but only 1/4"ish, don't worry about it.  I have made this probably 10 times with success every time.  My wife and mother-in-law ask me to make it for many events and it always disappears.

Made this for brunch with friends and everyone asked for the recipe. It's truly delicious and so simple to make. The best part is being able to prepare it ahead of time so I could enjoy my company. I did add cinnimon to the top for presentation.

I personally don't like French toast, however, I made it last year for Christmas Brunch and everyone inhaled it and couldn't stop talking about how good it was. It was also was easy to make the night before and in the morning no need to be in the kitchen cooking. I just threw it in the oven and actually enjoyed Christmas! I would definatly make it again!

I loved it!!! I tried with half the eggs on the recipe and the liquid came just right amount for 1 lb. bread. I love the texture of the toast with the soft and moist top and crispy bottom.

I haven't found anyone who hasn't been wowed by this dish.  I make it with egg substitue, eliminate the half n' half, use 2 1/2 cups of whole milk and since I use a raisin bread I reduce the brown sugar to 1 cup.

WOW! This was such a hit at my Thanksgiving brunch! I did cut back the milk to 1 c. but kept the 8 eggs. Baked it an extra 30 min (!) and the results were fantastic--a wonderful "souffle" quality. My daughter's fiance reheated the few pieces left over and ate it for dessert the next day! Thanks so much for this recipe! One comment though--really pack in the sliced (day-old) French bread in your baking pan: it helps absorb all the liquid and gives great results.

Great breakfast dish, I served it with hash browns & sausage.  However, it was a little sweet.  I will cut down on the syrup mixture next time.

All I can say is yuck times 5. No one in my family liked this breakfast.  Everything cooked the way it was supposed to, I even added less milk and eggs, per others suggestions. However, while the flavor is decent, this dish is very soggy!! We won't be making this again.

This recipe was not what I expected based on the wonderful reviews.  I followed everything as stated in the recipe. The french bread layer was very very tasty due to the brown sugar topping. However, there was too much liquid on the bottom and we particularly did not like the scrambled eggs combined with the sweet syrup.

This sounded so good and we all were looking forward to it for a nice Sunday breakfast but we were very disappointed.  I followed directions exactly but all I got was a big soggy mess.  I tried baking it longer, up to an hour more than required, but it would not stiffen up.  It was just soggy and uneatable.

I have been making it for years and it is absolutely delicious. The only adjustment I have made is how I prepare the bread. I take packaged hero rolls (you can get them in the bread aisle) and I cube them. They soak up the liquid perfectly.

My entire family loves this dish and it is yummy.

It was so easy to put together.  Fixed it while camping with family.  It was a hit.  Everyone enjoyed it.  The only thing I would do differently would be to spray the pan with Pam prior to melting the butter.  It was a bit sticky at the bottom.

First off I had to scramble and use wheat bread instead of French bread but that didn't change this from being more custard & bread pudding like than French Toast. The Caramel Sauce really seemed to overwhelm the dish and could have used maybe a maple flavoring.

I love this recipe and make it every time I have brunch. The only thing I do differently is I use older bread as its nice to get rid of day old bread and I rip it into pieces versus using sliced bread. I get great compliments and there is never any leftovers- 5 stars all the way

Followed the recipe, but I made bread pudding style. French bread cut in cubes. I added saltine toffee crumbles (left over from V day)Maybe a half cup of them. Also made a strawberry sauce.

As written, way too much liquid and was just mush. I took other reviewers tips ... 6 eggs, 2 cups of liquid, and doubled the cinnamon and vanilla. It was still just okay in flavor. Maybe try with a cinnamon bread or something?

Amazing. Prepped it on a Thursday night so my kids could have a special breakfast before school (it's that easy) I used Fresh baked Italian crusty bread (from Cosco)- about 4 days old.. so it was VERY dry. Used 6 eggs, 1 cup milk, 1 cup 1/2 1/2. Flipped bread while it soaked (a few hours in). Popped in oven, covered, for 20 mins, then uncovered with sauce on top for another 20. It was too sweet for us, but that's just our family. Next time I will use WAY less sugar and butter. Even still was great! My husband brought some of the leftovers to a friend at work, who declared it the best French toast ever! Can't wait to try it again with 1/2 the sugar!

We use homemade gluten-free French bread and this recipe has been a hit with everyone! It makes an excellent dish to serve at a brunch because you can mix it up the night before. Easy to make but so very delicious!!

I followed the recipe exactly and what a disappointment!
What I wanted was a crisp but not hard exterior (kind of like a grilled cheese sandwich). What I got was a soggy mess.
What I wanted was a cinnamon sugar flavor. What I got was hardly any flavor but plain egg.
I put a few pieces in a skillet to try and boil out the wet and create a crust but it didn't work,I agree with another reviewer that said, you should not have to read the reviews to fix a recipe!

Great recipe! Made half the recipe and half the amt of syrup.....delicious but I think less syrup would have been fine. Yum!

I have made this recipe many times and love it just as written.  My latest discovery is it's a great way to use up left over toasted coconut.  Just sprinkle it on before the syrup is poured on so it doesn't turn to charcoal when baking.

This was good, I would give 4 1/2 stars.  First, it was pretty easy.  It didn't really "feel" like french toast, more like a bread pudding, but nonetheless we enjoyed it tremendously.  The middle part was a little soggy, even with 45 minutes of baking, but certainly not so soggy that we didn't eat it.  The top part with the sauce was super crispy and caramelly.  Super yum!  No syrup needed, which was good because I was out. :)  Will make this again

It is Christmas morning and I was so looking forward to having this for breakfast.  I am so mad because I didn't read other reviews first--mad enough to get on the computer and see what I did wrong.  THERE IS WAY TOO MUCH LIQUID.  The flavor is great, but the texture is that of soggy bread (sopping, soggy).  My kids (from 5 - 14 years old) won't eat it because of the consistency.  I will try this again, but follow some of the other reviews and decrease liquid.  Don't make this as is, unless you don't mind a very, very, very moist bread pudding--which is resembles.  Also, force all the bread in the bottom of the pan--make it fit.  You need the big loaf to sop up all the liquid.  Next time, I will cram it all in there, and decrease the liquid as suggested by other, wiser cooks than I. Ugh.  Big disappointment--2 stars (toggling between 1 star--there is potential here; therefore 2 stars).

Will make this again for sure. No need to improve but I can't help but play with every recipe, so... next time I am going to add a can of apple pie filling for extra moistness and added flavor, maybe nuts and raisins too, hmmm.

So good! I didn't have the full amount of bread, only about half loaf, but it was older dry bread and worked great. I also, didn't refrigerate overnight, just let it set for about 20 min, and still worked great.

Yeah, this is pretty soggy if you make it with all that liquid.  I was darn upset the first time I made it and it turned out to be a soggy mess.  But it had a great flavor so I made some changes.  I've been making this recipe, with alterations, for almost 4 years now and it really is scrumtious if you cut back on the eggs and liquids. I use 6 eggs and 1 cup of milk and 1 cup of half and half.  I also add some fresh grated nutmeg (love that stuff!). I also increased the bake time to an hour. Some reviewers use 2 cups of half and half and I can see that working, too.  Now using these alterations still keep it custardy, but definitely nowhere near as soggy as the original.  I usually let it set for a few minutes before cutting into it.  If you want it to be more like griddled french toast with crispy outsides, you will need to either reduce the liquids way more, or figure out another way to adapt this recipe.

I made this French toast exactly as recipe called for.
I found it very mushy to the point of gelatin consistency. I would really decrease the liquids. Gonna tweek it myself and see how it turns out. But I must say this had wonderful flavor.

I've made this for our sunday pontoon brunch for friends. Everyone loves this but I did change it up a bit. I use 9 eggs and a little less liquid.  I used 1 1/2 C milk and 1 C 1/2 & 1/2. I also baked it a little longer.  50 min. Turned out perfect. I am making it this weekend again for overnight guests but I plan to add cooked apple to the brown sugar mixture and pecans on top.

Way too sweet for me. Next time, I will omit the corn syrup sauce as it has seriously wreaked havoc on my digestive track. That being said, I should also mention that I am not a huge fan of sweet things, and unfortunately, I am not a fan of this.

I have been making a similar recipe for years and it has become a tradition to make Christmas morning. It can be baking while presents are being opened! My twist on the recipe is that before I bake it (after it has been in the refrigerator overnight) I put a package of frozen mixed fruit on the bottom of a 9 x 14 baking dish, then put the french toast on the top. Bake it for the required time and then put a dollop of yogurt on the top before I serve it! Delicious!!

One of the best things I've ever eaten.  Someone made this for a breakfast potluck today and now, 13 hours later, I can't stop thinking about it.  Yes, it's soggy in parts but that doesn't mean it wasn't fabulous!  Eggy and sweet!

It looked and smelled so good, but it was just too sweet!!  it might have worked a bit better I hadn't made & poured all that syrup on it before baking it. 
and it was super soggy.  Dont eat this unless you like your french toast (toast?!) soggy and ridiculously sweet.

Followed the recipe as written and served for Easter brunch. My family raved, but I found it bland in flavor. Could be sweeter and needed more of the spices. Had a hard time fitting in the slices in the baking dish, I wondered if cubing the bread would be better. With all the tweaking this recipe will require, I will explore the other recipes instead.

This was really good. I have never made it before. I did add a little of my own to it. Instead of using just cinnamon, I added nutmeg and cloves. I also topped each piece of bread with sliced apples and walnuts.

We love this recipe!  My daughters girl scout troop makes it for a lot of their sleep overs.  I generally use raisen bread.  I follow the recipe pretty close.  If I do not want it as sweet I will cut down on the amount of topping.

This was very good. Made as stated, but mine did NOT fit in just one 9 X13. I tried to layer, but that just made the middle pieces mushy. Next time, I'll just use 2 pans.

Delicious! I did not change the ingredients at all and it came out so good there was nothing left at the end of the brunch. I did not have time to let it soak overnight so I just let it sit about 30 mins. Everyone commented on how good it was.

This was amazing. It was very custard and dessert like, and absolutely delicious. I did follow one reviewers suggestion and turn over every piece before baking it in the morning. I used a pan that was too shallow and it boiled over all over my oven-my fault! It still turned out yummy. Everyone at worked raved about it.

This was great. I made it for a group of 10 people and they all LOVED it. I decided to half the recipe to cut down on sogginess potential and will likely do this in the future. Making it tomorrow morning as a matter of fact, so my wife is excited.

Truly delicious but also very sweet. (My 4-year old daughter felt it was too sweet for her taste.)

I cut this in half as I only had half a loaf of bread and baked it in an 8x8 pan.  I only decreased the milk a little and it turned out great!

I should have read the reviews - that may have helped me.  Followed recipe as is - very mushy, not what I expected.  After baking, had to take each slice out of pan & fry them separately.  Sort of helped.  Guests were waiting - oh well, live & learn.

I made this for a work potluck and received rave reviews.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because it is too sweet and I followed the recipe in the review by Michelle Mullis for the liquid to egg ratio.  I used Trader Joe's Cinnamon Swirl bread (which is sliced thick) that I let sit out for a couple hours to dry out.  I did not flip the bread over the next morning.  I omitted the cinnamon (since it was in the bread) and I reduced the brown sugar to 3 cups since the bread is slightly sweet.  It cooked perfectly.

This was so delicious!! Served it to guests for brunch and everyone raved. I baked it a little longer than 40 minutes and the top became like candy and the corners crunchy. I will be making this again.

My husband and I loved it so for that, I give it 5 stars. My 2 year old and 3 year old hated it and only ate a few bites. I  used 6 eggs, 2 cups half and half, excluded the milk, 2 tsp vanilla and 1/4 tsp of cinnamon, soaked for only 4 hours and turned each piece over. I boiled the topping and placed on right before putting in the oven. Baked for 40 mins. YUM!

This recipe is great for a big crowd if you just do 2 loaves of bread and don't double the other ingredients. With one loaf it is more like bread pudding and the sauce is overpowering.  It would probably be better cutting the sauce to 1/3rd the recipe and using it as a drizzle so you can still top with some maple syrup. Also make sure you butter or spray your pan well b/c the bread will stick.

I used two less eggs, left out the milk and added 1/2 cup of buttermilk and it was OUTRAGEOUS!!!  This is the second time I made it.  The first time I followed the recipe, but took the advice of some of the reviewers and used less milk.  It was still too soupy.  Leave out the milk and use less eggs and you would be fine.  Great idea and very tasty:)

I made just two changes to this recipe and it was perfect. First, I used challah bread that I let sit out for two days. I then did two layers of bread instead of one. I turned the bread in the egg mixture a couple times while it soaked. I used the amount of eggs & liquid that the recipe called for. I covered in the butter/sugar mixture before baking it. I think I had it in maybe 45/50 minutes, but it turned out to be AMAZING. It was like a bread pudding and everyone loved it. This is definitely a keeper!

I really liked this recipe! The toast was light and fluffy, but still sweet. The only problem I had was that we made too much! It fills you up really quickly, so it's better made for a big group of people, probably for a brunch idea.

I too followed Michelle Mullis' directions.  I prepared mine in the early afternoon and just left sit out at room temperature to have breakfast for dinner.  I sprinkled a little extra cinnamon and pecans, delicious!  A note to remember if you bake with the caramel sauce:  put a pan underneath the dish in case of overflow!

The flavor of this is wonderful!  I followed other reviewers suggestions and only used 6 eggs and 2 cups of 1/2 & 1/2, still think there is a little too much liquid even doing that.  This recipe has the consistency more of a bread budding versus a french toast.  I was hoping for more of a french toast so I think I'll keep looking.  Overall, people ate it and it tasted good.  The only problem I ran into was when I put the sauce on top it ended up overflowing in my oven (oops!).

I find that I prefer french toast prepared the traditional way rather than this method.  The finished product was soggy, mushy, and didn't have much flavor.

This one is a keeper!! I reduced the egg and milk mixture a little bit the second time I made it. The first time was a little too wet and egg-ey for my taste. Also, the second time I made it I added chopped pecans and a little cinnamon to the syrup mixture. So Good! Reminded me of a sticky cinnamon bun. No need to add more butter or syrup to the final product. I have made this for Sunday brunch twice and I got amazing compliments. PS - Use crustier french bread, day old if you can find it. I feel like it holds its shape better.

I have made/reviewed many recipes on this site and this recipe is by far the worst one!  It tastes okay, nothing like the French toast taste that I was expecting. I will never make this recipe again. I am still looking for a simple and basic French Toast recipe.

Edible, but an otherwise complete mushy mess.  I even tried cooking it twice as long to see if I could get it to firm up a little more.  The taste is not bad, but certainly not worth using all the ingredients to get to this.  Disappointed is an understatement.

If you do not want it too "mushy" be sure to use all of the loaf to french bread.  Do not lay it flat in the pan but lay them at an angle against one another.  When you add the liquid pour it over and in-between the slices.  This gives more bread to soak up the liquid.

This has the potential to be a good recipe but, as is, I was very disappointed.  It was very soggy in the middle.  The edges browned nicely and that tasted good but a bit too sweet for my liking.  I even actually really like sweet things but this was a bit much.

This recipe was dee-lish!!! I did not change a thing. I thought about turning the bread over halfway through cooking but decided not to bother with it. One thing....I am not sure if it was the bread I used but the french toast really puffed up and the syrup spilled over into my brand new double oven. Next time, I will be sure to put a pan lined with aluminum foil under the casserole dish.

The flavor is good, but it's not "french toast".   I flipped the bread and used less liquid as suggested, however it was still soggy.  It's much more like bread pudding than breakfast.

This was not the hit I expected it to be. I had to bake it 20 minutes longer than the recipe called for and it was still very watery on the bottom. The tops were golden and crispy and yummy. But the bottom was mush. I did use fat free half-and-half. Maybe that had something to do with it?

The ONLY think I did different was to flip the bread 15 minutes before I took it out.   I did this because I really do not like soggy bread.   My family really liked it, I thought it was pretty good.  It was cooked well, and tasted good.  Since I had flipped it the syrup created a soft crust on the bottom of the bread (yummy).  If I make this again I think I will double the syrup and add half before baking and half when I flip it.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for my family over Thanksgiving and it turned out fantastic!! I used milk instead of half-and-half (I didn't have it) and it still turned out really good.

I scoured the reviews to hear from anyone that didn't soak overnight, and couldn't find any. So I just got brave and tried it anyways. I had some homemade whitebread, and I cut it about 1/2" thick. I soaked the bread on each side for about 10 minutes. I was only able to fit 6 slices in the 9x13 pan, so I halved the recipe. The result was pretty good...It was much more like bread pudding and much less like french toast, but after reading scores of reviews it was what I expected. Also, I substituted maple syrup for corn syrup since I didn't have corn syrup. I thought the sauce tasted wonderful this way.

I took this to a baby shower brunch. It was a hit. Several people asked for the receipe. I actually used one of the suggested changes that other people put in. You could change this receipe around and still get great results. YUM

It was way too eggy for me and my husband. I put 6 eggs in instead of 8, and it was still too much.My kid didn't touch too much. I didn't have any corn syrup so I didn't make the topping. I used maple syrup as a topping which made it edible.  I'll probably stick with the skillet kind :/

This turned out really messy for me.  The bread and mixture bubbled high over the pan during baking and oozed onto the bottom of my oven.  I had a huge, sticky mess to clean up!  The taste was good - similar to bread pudding.  I probably won't make this again, though, due to the mess.

This is a fantastic recipe and I use it frequently.  Always comes out perfect. You don't need to change a thing.  You may want to place it on a cookie sheet because sometimes it boils over in the oven.  It's really delicious!

The baked french toast of your dreams.  Get up early if you used a pyrex dish so you can let it get to room temp before you throw it in the oven.  I used soy milk and half-n-half and it was great.  Did not make the sugary glaze-I spritzed with powdered sugar then used Mrs.B's sugar free syrup (girls gotta stay in control!)

This was a nice, light baked french toast- some of them can be so heavy. To make it lighter, I used one less egg, and skim milk (I had no half and half anyway). My parents didn't want the topping (too much butter for them) so I just sprinkled some brown sugar on top.

If your looking for standard French Toast, you won't find it here. Don't monkey with the recipe, and you will get something between French Toast and bread pudding. I loved it as is, but it was a little rich for breakfast.

This was the best! The caramel sauce on top created a nice crispy crust that was incredible. I agree with another reviewer that is almost more like bread pudding. Will definitely make again.

This was a really tasty recipe. I followed the changes that Michelle Mullins recommended (6 eggs, 2 cups h/h, no milk). It was great except I would recommend that you choose a gooooood bread that isn't hard. I didn't like the outer crust being too crunchy after baking.

Very Good! Great for company! I took another's advice and only used 6 eggs, 1.25 cups of milk and 1 cup of cream. By morning, there wasen't any liquid left in the dish. The bread had soaked it all up. I also flipped the bread over before sticking it in the oven so it would cook more evenly.

I had to cook it much longer and it was still soggy...it was too eggy and it almost tasted like the eggs weren't completely cooked. Not sure what I did wrong..I couldn't fit anymore bread in the pan. I would love to figure out the problem, because it SOUNDS delicious!!

This is awesome french toast!!! It has a custard center that is nice, fluffy and moist. I included the ends of the french bread (the thick crust), and they did not soak the mixure well. So I will leave out the ends next time. I love how I can prep it the night before and just pop it into the oven in the morning . I will definitely, absolutely make this again! Thank you!

Loved this receipe.  I did however take recommendations from other readers.  I only use 6 eggs and cut a 1/2 cup off all liquids.  I also turned over before I went to bed christmas eve.  I cooked longer and lower than the receipe called for and it was excellent.  The topping really was delicious as well.  Would highly recommend!

Very tasty!  But next time, I would only make half of the brown sugar topping so its not overly sweet.

I made this for breakfast on Christmas morning and it was a hit with everyone but me.  I did change the recipe a bit, here is what I did.  I used regular whole wheat bread 10 slices); 7 eggs; 1 cup half and half; 1 cup milk and a pinch of salt.  I covered the dish and cooked it for 20 minutes before adding the sauce and then cooked for another 20 minutes.  I broiled the dish for a few minutes at the end to just crisp it up.  The end result was tasty, but when the dish cooled, the 'caramel' sauce became hard and really difficult to chew.  Others liked this aspect of the dish....I did not.

This really smells good in the oven. That's about the best I can say about it. :-( I decided I better do a test run of this recipe before using it on Christmas morning since there are so many mixed reviews. I would have been so disappointed if I made this for my guests and it was this bad! I'm really glad I listened to the reviews and used less liquid - this would have been a disaster if I'd have used all of that liquid! There really is hardly any flavor at all and it's not even pretty to look at! My mom and I each had one piece and the rest went in the trash. A big ugly soggy mess. :-(

We just love this recipe. I always modify according to another review I read when I first made this dish almost 2 years ago. 6 eggs, 1 cup cream, 1 1/4 cup milk. I make it just a bit healthier by adding ground flax seeds to the egg mixture for the kids.  Once the caramel topping goes on, you can't even tell the flax is there.  10 stars!

Excellent recipe. The amount of spice is up to the cook. I only changed the bread. Challah (egg) bread has added flavor.

This recipe was too sweet for even my 13 yr old daughter who has a major sweet tooth.  It is more like bread pudding, but WAY too sweet.

I love these kinds of make ahead recipes. This baked french toast recipe is one of the best I've made. There are only 4 of us and I cut it in half for us. Works perfect everytime. Many times, I add raisins and diced apples when cooking the syrup, that's a big hit at my house!

I have a passion for bread pudding. This recipe is closer than the real thing to that, and is the best especially with the praline topping.  I made it for the first time for a Women's breakfast at my church. Now I'm asked to make it every month for breakfast there. Don't change it and don't wait for it to brown. the praline topping will do that for you. I went on a cruise and they had bread pudding every day and that was the first place I stopped each meal. This is better than all of their recipes.

If you are expecting it to look like French Toast, then follow the other suggestions.

I made this as the recipe instructs and was disappointed with the end result.  It tasted good, but the bottom of the pan can only be described as being similar to flan.  I guess I will scale back the liquid and perhaps flip the bread half way through baking to avoid this.  I will say that the prep was super easy so if you can get the mixture right it would be worth the high rating.

Overall, I think this is a good base recipe.  I took the advice of others and only used six eggs, one cup of milk, and one cup of half and half.  I also dipped the bread into the mixture instead of pouring it over the bread.  I couldn't get the bread in a single layer, so that caused the bottom to be soggy.  I turned the bread over half way through, but that didn't help the bottom layer to much.  Next time I will split this into two separate pans and I think it will be great.

This is an absolutely perfect recipe. I altered it a tiny bit because I usually make it on Sundays before I go to church, so to cook it for an hour was too little.  I found a site online where it suggested that you'd be better to cook food at 225 degrees for 1 1/2 hours, instead of 350 degrees for an hour.  I did this last Sunday, and the Baked French Toast came out perfect!  Everyone was raving about it.

I loved this!! I made a mistake and added the brown sugar to the egg mixture (didn't read the directions first).  BUT it turned out fantastic!!!  I didn't make any sauce- just ate it like that, was hot and crispy.  I won't make it any different from now on...

I was disappointed with how this turned out and I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and used only 6 eggs, 2 cups half and half (no milk), flipped the bread over halfway through cooking, etc..,  I will try this again sometime but I think I will do as yet another reviewer did and put the sliced bread in the oven to dry it out first.  I may also try using maple syrup instead of corn syrup for more flavor.  I hope that it turns out better next time.

Yummy! I made half a recipe, used mostly heavy cream with a bit of milk, skipped the cinnamon. Baking time was just right for us, but be careful of the topping- if the pan you bake in is too full, you'll have a big mess on your hands, since it bubbles up. Put the dish on a baking sheet just to be safe.

Used raisin challah, cut the recipe in half and didn't find it too soggy at all. Took another reviewer's suggestion and started it without the sauce for 20 minutes, flipped and added sauce and let it go for about 25 minutes. Delicious!

Fabulous. Made this for my mother-in-law's 70th birthday breakfast. Big, big hit!!  I had a chef once tell me to substitute a small amount of orange juice and triple sec for the milk. Adds a touch of sophistication. You'll want to skip the cinnamon if you do. Try a quarter cup o.j. and a tablespoon of triple sec.

I brought this to work for our Friday Morning Breakfast Club, and everyone loved it! I listened to the reviews and cut back on the eggs, milk and cream. It turned out great. 

P.S. - I work at Allrecipes and everyone in the office loved it! Thanks for the great recipe!

SO very good!  I used a loaf of Hawaiian bread and cut slices about 1.5" thick.  Made in about 10 minutes and set aside for company the next morning.  Upon recs from other reviewers, I only did 6 eggs, 1.25 c milk, 1 c half and half.  Flipped slices about 30 minutes into the process and baked for another 20 minutes.  Delicious with some oven-cooked bacon.

Great recipe, very easy! I made this for my Husband's birthday and it certainly was a hit with him! It was really sweet and a little soggy, but other than that I really enjoyed it! I did add 3/4 cup of chopped pecans, and I will do that again! I will also do like others have said and make my slices thicker and cut down on the eggs, milk, and cream.

Needed casserole recipes for a Dr's Day brunch at our hospital.  Found this & thought it sounded good.  IT WAS A HIT!  I have made it a couple of times and people always want to know the recipe.  I plan on making it for our Women's breakfast at church some day.

I did not enjoy this. My bread was soggy on the bottom from having soaked in the fridge for 8 hours, and the top was too crunchy and hard. Maybe I did something wrong, but I definitely don't think I'll be making this again.

Made this using a paesano crusty loaf (used 1/2 of it as I halved the recipe) and cubed it vs slicing it.  I also cut back on the butter by 2 tbsp for the topping.  Overall, fantastic taste.  The next time, I may also use 1 less egg (3 vs 4 for 1/2).  Definitely a great recipe and easy to prepare for company.

Very good. Took the recommendation from other posters and reduced the amount of eggs/milk. I made it for a brunch and everyone said they liked it.

I soaked fresh French bread overnight and it didn't get soggy at all.  In fact, I wish it had been absorbed more into the center of the bread.  The taste is great - just the right creaminess.  I used 1 cup milk, 3/4 cup half and half and 6 eggs.  I didn't care for the butter and brown sugar mixture though.  Next time, I'll just have it with good maple syrup.  My husband really liked it.

i made this for my family one school day using day old french loaf of bread( well it was actually one week old) and i used suggestions from others about the (6)eggs and (1 cup)milk. And then i didn't have any cream so i use cool whip about a cup or so (i know it sounds wierd!) and i mixed it with an electric hand mixer and soaked it overnight(in the bread). When i took it out to bake in the morning it looked really weird and that worried me on how it would taste. Then when i went to make the syrup that goes on top i used about 1/2 cup of butter, and a cup of brown sugar and omitted light corn syrup (cuz i didn't have any). i was worried cuz i had changed so much of the recipe and i had remembered the reviews talking about how it was soggy but it came out fine, and i served it with powdered sugar and syrup. My little sisters loved it and my parents even loved it which says a lot! i will definitly make this recipe again!!!!

I used the suggestions of other reviewers, using less liquids, and also "toasted" the bread some in the oven before putting the liquid on it. This turned out amazing. I cooked it for a crowd for Easter breakfast. Will definitely make again!!

I made this for Easter Breakfast.  It was AWSOME! I did dip the bread in the egg mixture (like I would when making french toast) instead of pouring the egg mixture on top of the bread. Besides that I followed the recipe as written. I think I might try adding cropped walnuts next time I make it. Excellent recipe!

I made this for Easter morning. I added 6 eggs and reduced the milk as recommended by other reviews but this was way too soggy. It was like mush, I tried cooking it longer but that didn't help. I won't make this again. very dissapointed!

TOO SWEET! I was excited to make this recipe since french toast is my favorite breakfast meal and thought this would make a great easter treat.  Think we like the texture more when made on a grill pan and would skip the sauce.  Would hate to know what our glucose levels are right now :(

Fabulous!! This recipe was a huge hit for all my family. A super recipe for a busy morning as all the major prep is done the night before. I even assembled all the topping ingredients in a sauce pan the night before so the next morning, all I had to do was turn on the burner and go! We'll definitely have this again. Thanks for sharing.

We had to bring a food to church and at the last minute, our dogs ate my daughters cake.  I threw this together, baked it and ran out the door.  OMG...the rave reviews were wonderful.  I now have to bring the recipe to church for all to have.  What an incredible breakfast, even the kids had seconds.

This was really yummy tasting, but it was too soggy for me even after following others suggestions (used less milk and cream). 
We had lots of leftovers and reheated them the next morning in the oven at 350 for about 15 minutes and they were PERFECT!
Not siggy and nice and crunchy on the outside! We were fighting over the last piece!

I made this for my daughter and her family for breakfast on Christmas morning. I used one cup of real maple syrup warmed in the microwave with two tablespoons of butter instead of the brown sugar mixture. It got rave reviews and will definitely go on the "Lets have this again list" at our house!

I made this for Christmas Breakfast and it turned out WONDERFUL!  I made the recipe as-is, but I cut the bread early in the afternoon to let it dry out before assembling it at bedtime.  I did turn as much as the bread as I could in the morning before baking as other reviewers had commented on.  The whole family LOVED IT!  This will be on our table again very soon.

I have made this dish a number of times.  Everyone enjoys, especially the kids. I think people shouldn't expect it to have the same consistency as regular french toast. It does come out soft and mushy but I think that's what make it delicious.

This is fabulous!! I recently cooked this for my family when we were on vacation. It was a hit!! I used 1 cup of milk (instead of the suggested 2 cups) and 6 eggs (instead of the suggested 8 eggs). You cannot go wrong with this recipe! One user suggested putting pecans on top. While I didn't do this, I will definitely try it with the pecans next time. A real winner!!!!

I have made this dish several times, now and have found that using wheat french bread is the best. Otherwise I do not change a thing. When I layer the slices in the pan, I just squish them together to fit.  I use all but a couple of slices from the french bread.  Anyone who eats this, always asks for the recipe.  It reminds me of some fabulous bread pudding that I had last year in England at a very old pub!

This tasted delicious but the bread was very soggy -- almost like the consistency of bread pudding.  I used Italian bread because I did not have French.  Perhaps that is the reason it was soggy.

this turned out great, I made it the night before and in the morning, I flipped over each piece of bread as to coat the whole piece with the milk mixture.  Other than that I made it just as the recipe called for.  The topping was just right and not at all too sweet like some of the reviews had stated.  And when I made it for a whole group, there were no leftovers and eveyone raved about it even the next day.  I will definately make it again.

Delicious and easy.  I made this for my grown-up kids and we all loved it.  I tweaked the recipe and only used 6 eggs.  Next time I think I'll follow the recipe as is.

OMG!!  This was SO yummy!  I made a dish of it camping and it was a huge hit!  I used a whole loaf of raisin pecan french bread from Safeway but halved the rest of the recipe because I was worried about it being soggy but I think that next time I will use the recipe as listed because the egg mixture made a wonderful custard like substance at the bottom and there just wasn't enough of it!

I prepared this recipe the night before Easter.  When my children woke up Easter morning, I put it in the oven and by the time they found their baskets, took pictures and played breakfast was ready!  It is so delicious and very easy to make.

I made this for a Mother's Day brunch, and it was enjoyed by all.  I'm not really a fan of any kind of French Toast, but my family loved it.  The caramel sauce overtop the bread really made this dish.  It gets very crunchy on top of the bread.  It's very easy to make, as well.

I made this for mothers day. This was so good!!! I had no problems as others stated. I made sure I butter the pan good so it wouldn't stick. It was a little soggy, but it was still good. Mine didn't all fit in one pan so I used a 8x8 for the extra bread. I topped it with powered sugar and fresh blueberries and strawberries.

None left for me!  Sooo good, don't know why this had some bad reviews.  I have never had a problem fitting the bread in the pan.  I did reduce the milk and eggs as well as a little less brown sugar in the topping but it is soo superb!!!!

thought this recipe was awesome.  My grandson says it's the best french toast he ever had (high praise from him)  I have made it several times and it has always come out perfect.  The only thing I changes was that I used maple syrup instead of corn syrup.

I'm not sure that this recipe needs another review, BUT!
  I made it yesterday for a brunch, among a gazillion other things. This was the hit of the day. Everyone raved about it an asked for the recipe.  I made it exactly as the recipe stated, and it was perfect!(Also,my dil told me that some of the syrupy mixture dripped onto the roles baking below, and she has requeste4d that I add that to all bisquets.).

Made these for my husband and kids. They loved them. I was afraid of them becoming to mushy so I cut back on the milk. Will add a bit more next time.

wasn't very impressed, especially with all the great reviews.  i found the french toast really sticky and chewy because of the light corn syrup.  will try again, because of the great reviews and repost results.

This was GREAT - I followed the recipe and made the modifications mentioned below.  I did use two pans and prior to pouring the egg mixture - I poured it into a large measuring cup to make sure that I poured evenly over the two pans - And it was delicious!!  Thanks!!

This recipe is wonderful.  Reminds me of bread pudding.  You can definately use less eggs and also replace the half and half with milk if you do not have any available.  I've been making this for years and has always been a big hit in my family.

I tried this with reduced amount of liquid recommended in reviews - still soggy. I'll probably stick to old fashioned french toast from now on.

This was pretty good, we enjoyed it and took reviewers advice to ensure that the middle was not soggy by using less liquid. But, I only used the corn syrup/sugar mixture on half the slices, and I am glad I did. The tops burned and the syrup became bitter. While the taste of the syrup was yummy, I would prefer just maple syrup. But, we will be making these again.

This was a hit at my job! I did change the recipe alittle after reading everyone's comments.  I used ff half and half and ff skin milk.  I also used two pans one small and large.  This way it wasn't as soggy.

I actually made this for dinner tonight. I thought it was really good, I liked the sauce you put on top, it gets nice and carmelized. Its more like a bread pudding. I did half the recipe because I have a small family and it turned out great. My husband said it tasted good, but he'd rather have regular french toast. This is a good special occasion recipe.

I took other reviewers advice and practically halved all the wet ingredients and I still ended up with a somewhat soggy dish. The top was nice and crispy and the sides of each piece were delicious, but the centers were all a soggy mess.  I will try this again, but with more moderations.  I did use cinnamon bread instead of the french loaf and it gave it wonderful flavor.

I used this recipe to feed a big group of exchange students that stayed overnight at my house. A loaf of bakery french bread was way too much for a 9x13 dish. To accomodate the bread, I had to cube it, smoosh it in, and up the liquid and eggs (1 more cup of Milk/cream, and 4 more eggs) I also added 2 tbsp sugar to the custard mixture and intend to double the carmel topping. It was really good, but was only slightly sweet prepared as the recipe directs. I like my french toast/custard to be a little more noticably sweet. All in all, it was a big hit and the leader of the group asked for the recipe and intends to use it for Easter Brunch. I will definitely use again.

Overall a great recipe.  It's even better as leftovers.  Make sure to cook it through or it gets really soggy.  Also,  if you leave your bread uncovered for a day, it will be stale and make for a less soggy outcome.  The sauce is devine!  Thanks for sharing.

Very good!  I make this EVERYTIME we have a potluck at work.  I do a couple things different. Instead of slices I cube the bread (easier to dish out).  I added pecans to the topping and then poured on the bread.  I also used egg beaters instead of eggs and I used light butter syrup.

I've tried this recipe a couple of times now and no matter how I arranged them they came out mushy in the middle. I'll stick to french toast the old fashioned way.

I made this EXACTLY as the recipe stated, and it came out very good.  I squeezed the bread together to fit into the pan, and didn't change any of the measurements.  If you like your french toast crispy, this isn't the recipe for you.  If you want to try a fluffier, creamier french toast, then this is the recipe for you.  I made it for Christmas morning, and got rave reviews.

This is an awesome recipe and half of my family enjoyed it.  The rest of us found it to be too sweet so when I make it for Father's Day, I'm going to decrease or eliminate the brown sugar.  Thanks for the great recipe that feeds a crowd!

Very easy to make and very good.  I used 6 eggs and 1 cup each milk and cream as suggested in other reviews.

This is very good but I made some changes after reading the reviews.  I only used 6 eggs and 1 cup of milk (no half and half).  It also has to bake for close to an hour or it will be soggy.  We also sprinkled pecans on top before baking. And I used alot more cinnamon.  We loved it!  It is very sweet but we liked it that way.  Will make this again soon!!  Thank you!

I made this brunch on Mother's Day and even though I added the corn syrup, brown sugar after I took it out the oven(I forgot)I received rave reviews. This was the best French Toast that I ever had.

Ok I am giving this 5 stars. I didnt have french bread so just used regular wheat. I didnt cut it up into pieces until the mroning and think that helped with the soggy factor everyone talks about. I didnt use any milk, just the half and half also didnt use all the milk mixture, I dipped the bread pieces in the mixture just like you would for regular french bread and then drizzled a bit on top of the bread too. And the topping in the morning, i used only a half stick of butter. I still used syrup too it didnt seem very sweet to me for some reason. And as it sits it gets better!! I will try to make this again with french bread and im sure it will be awesome.  I will add vanilla extract to the brown sugar topping too, it needed something else, but it carmelizes awesome!! This definitely needs an hour in the oven, not 40 minutes, just watch it, you want it brown and a little hard in spots, the carmelized parts are the best tasting parts!

This recipe is awesome! I will definitely replace my old french toast casserole recipe with this one.  The only adjustment I made was I only used 1/2 c. of butter and 1 c. of brown sugar.  Everyone really enjoyed this. :)

Made this for X-mas brunch and it was a hit!  It was gone in no time and everyone was asking for more!  Here's how I changed the recipe:  Cut the bread into cubes (I couldn't get the whole pound of bread in otherwise), used only 7 eggs, used 2 cups of heavy cream, 1 cup of half and half (because of the "soggy" comments from others), 3 tsp. vanilla, maple syrup instead of corn syrup.  Made a raspberry sauce and a rum sauce (both from this site - raspberry was originally blueberries and used Captain Morgan's rum).  I'll definitely make this again along with the sauces!  Also made the BH&G Seafood Strata, which went well with this dish.

Was very easy to make . Loved the fact it could be done the night before. It was a little sweeter then my family is used to. Would go a little less on the brown sugar topping. We will use this again

Very good, but did have to adjust a few things.  First don't pack in the french bread, cut pieces to fit into the smaller areas so each layer in complete.  Next decreased milk to 1 cup and increased half and half to 2 (no use in waisting the 1/2 cup left in the pint lol)  Added 1/2 cup brown sugar to egg mixedture, subbed corn syrup for maple syrup.  And also baked for 1 hour 12 minutes.  Once pulled from the oven check density to make sure egg is cooked.  Drizzle with maple syrup after removal and serve.  other than all that I followed the recipe.  Family really loved it.  Served Christmas morning.

This recipe was amazing.  Everyone loved it.  I suggest it to everyone who is planning a brunch party.  Just beat the eggs well.  I don't think I did and when I baked it, some pieces of unmixed eggs were baked in my caserole...AND IT WAS STILL GOOD....

This was delicious!  With a few simple adjustments this turned out great.  We decreased milk to 1 c. and eggs to 7.  I agree with the others...add liquid as your bread density tolerates or you may be in for a soggy mess.  We also increased cooking time to 1 hour.  My picky 11 year old son helped me put this together last night, simply put HE LOVED IT!  Thanks Laura, this one is a keeper!

What can I say about this that hasn't already been said. I made this for Father's Day breakfast and it was awesome, I didn't read the recipe all the way through and added the brown sugar to the liquid, before I realized it was supposed to be part of the syrup.
It turned out great anyway and in the last 15 minutes of baking, I put butter all over it and used bottled syrup. My family is already asking when I'm going to make it again.
Thanks for sharing!!

This turned out way to mushy which means that the serving guide is wrong and the egg/milk/half & half mixture could have used another entire loaf of crusty bread... at least!  The only good part about this recipe was the topping.

I've been making this for years but I had to share this---for the holidays I decided to replace the milk with light eggnog and the half & half with skim evaporated milk and did NOT make the caramel topping.  It was a great holiday variation!  Might become a x-mas morning tradition.

WOW! I wasn't going to try this one cuz it got only four stars, but it was great! Since people said it was way too mushy, (cuz i hate mushy bread), i halved everything except the bread, and still had a little leftover. it came out crunchy, and yummmyyyyy!! Thank you!

This was so good!  I was worried at first, though, because it looked really soupy.  But it baked beautifully!  The brown sugar/butter sauce gives it a nice crust, like creme brulee almost!

Excellant recipe, but a little too mushy for me...I will use less of the egg mixture next time. Also, for special occasions, stir together 1 cup br sugar, 2 tbsp. lite corn syrup 1/2 cup butter-simmer until melted, pour in bottom of pan-sprinkle with 1 cup chopped pecans, then place bread on top and continue recipe (using less egg mixture)-after baking let rest for 10 mins.Make sure to serve with flat spatula & invert on to plate!Enjoy!

I made this for Christmas morning breakfast.  It is most delicious & easy.  I used pre-sliced french bread from the Oroweat thrift store.  This recipe is a keeper!

I had no problems fitting the bread in a 13X9 pan.  Thanks for the suggestions in using the 6 eggs and 1 c. milk.  We used eggnog, but I don't think it mattered.  (Maybe you could taste the eggnog more if you skip the topping). 
 

I made all the topping and just poured some of it on the top of the bread.  I think it works well to use your judgement and not to use the whole amount.  We LOVE sweets and that would have been a little much, even for my family!

I used Brommel and Brown yogurt spread in the topping and it worked out fine!

Great recipe (with the changes).

Will use again and again!

I made this for our "morning after" New Year's breakfast.  We all enjoyed it.  I did cook it covered for 1/2 the time then broiled it quickly for a few minutes to crisp up the top.  Next time I'll let it sit for a few minutes before serving to let the toast firm up a little.

This is great on holiday mornings because most of the work is done the night before.  I just took this to a teacher's brunch yesterday and everyone raved over it.  Quick, easy, and yummy!

I read the reviews, made a few adjustments, and despite that, I'm sorry, it turned out horribly.  The brown sugar coating on top was just too much to handle, and we ended up throwing most of it out. Thank you anyhow!

I made this for Easter, and everyone loved it.  The topping gets a little firm and is almost like a carmel corn topping.  Very very good.  I decreased the milk by 1/2 cup because I didn't want it to get too mushy, and it worked out just fine.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

Tailgate at a West Point game last week and for breakfast I make the French Toast.  Prepared the evening before and cooked that morning, wrapped in foil and then a towel around it and traveled to the game - 1 hour later the dish was still very warm and delicious - everyone including the kids loved it - had to share this you.  Thanks Laura for such an easy and yummy recipe!

Made this for mothers day.. everyone loved it! I used only 1 cup of milk and poured out the remaining liquid (just a little) before baking.  Used lots of pecans! I had to make 2 layers in the dish.. next time I would make sure I coat the bottom layer better with both the egg mixture and syrup mixture.

I made this for Mother's Day Brunch.  It was sooo easy, and soooo good.  Although I didn't read the reviews (like many others) before I made this nobody complained it was soggy and it was quite good.  I was nervous when I was making it because of all the liquid, but the bread sucked it up quite nicely.  I will try cutting the mike back to 1 cup and the eggs from 8 to 6 to see if I like that better.  I didn't use all the glaze the first time, because it just looked like to much.  Incredible dish, I can't wait to make it again.

This was absolutely wonderful!  I brought this to
work and received rave reviews from everyone.  I did use 6 eggs and reduced the milk to 1 cup.  And reduced the brown sugar to 3/4 cup.  It was perfect, I will make this again and again!

Great recipe! I made this for out of town guests & it couldn't have been easier. I followed the suggestions from other reviewers & decreased the amount of liquid used, as well as the amount of brown sugar. Also, I had run out of vanilla, so used maple extract instead. Awesome! I will definitely make this again.

I made this at midnight the night before a baby shower I was throwing.  I was incredibly tired and not paying attention.  I ended up combining ALL of the ingredients and pouring them over the top (just melted the butter).  Imagine my distress when I realized my mistake the next morning!  My husband convinced me to bake it anyway and I did.  I warned the guests, but they all LOVED it!  I hadn't read the reviews beforehand, so I had no idea that it might be soggy.  Mine was not soggy, but I did leave it in the oven after turning it off to keep it warm.  I can't wait to make it again, only this time the correct way!

This was a great recipe for guests, just like suggested. I recommend a cookie sheet under the pan, or a bigger pan, since mine (like others, so I've read) dropped over into the bottom of the oven. Everyone loved it, though, and I will make it again and again!

I made this for Easter Brunch for family of 25+.  I used homemade bread a ginger/cinnamon/cloves recipe, then continued with the Frenc Toast recipe.  I looked horrible because my bread was already dark due to spices, but it tasted heavenly.  Rave reviews all around.  Next time I'll use regular french bread.

Made a more low fat version. Still used the half and half but used skim milk in place of regular milk, and used egg beaters instead of real eggs and it still came out great.  Next time, we will double the amount of ground cinnamon and vanilla extract.

This recipe was really easy to make.  I made it for brunch and my whole family loved it!  It reminds me of bread pudding.

I made this with only 1 cup of milk and it turned out wonderful.  It was really sweet, so next time I'll only use half of the syrup mixture on top. YUMMY!

This recipe was so different - it tasted like a breakfast french toast custard.  Unfortunately, I had it as a dessert for lunch and supper, too.  It won't last too long with my family because of it's french toast flavor!

Made this for family while at the beach for the weekend, it was a great hit.  I did put only 1 cup of milk after reading the other reviews and it turned out wonderful.  Everyone wanted the recipe. This is a keeper.

I made this recipe for my sister's baby shower.  I served it in a sterling chafing dish.  It was out of this world.  The recipe has been past on to almost all 30 guests!  I'll definitely remember this one for holidays and future family brunches.  The perfect blend of flavors....a keeper of a recipe!

This was a huge hit at a family breakfast for 25.  I loved that it could be prepared the night before.  I even made the topping then, and just nuked it in the morning before pouring it on top of the bread.  Scrumptious!    Rory4371

The top of the baked toast becomes somewhat crunchy and the sauce topping crisp, creating a great combination of spongy and crunchy textures.
The quantity of liquid ingredients seemed high to me, so I reduced them by about 1/3 and got great results (I think it would be a little too "eggy" otherwise).  I also reduced the sauce ingredients by about 1/3.  Thus the dish was not so outrageously fattening but still excellent.

Served this recipe at a brunch last week for 50 people. I made five of them and everyone asked for the recipe. It was wonderful but I did need to clean my oven as it spills over. Baked french toast was a hit at my party.

I tried this for my son's birthday brunch and everyone loved it! I was worried because it looked as if there was too much liquid (after pouring it on top of the bread) but in the morning, I was amazed to find it all absorbed into the bread. It was a terrific success and I passed the recipe along to my daughter-in-law and my friends.

This was really delicious. I never really tried anything like this before so I was very pleased with the results. I only used 6 eggs and one cup of milk and I also baked it for an hour and it came our perfect, not soggy. I will definately make this again and again. The really good bonus is there's no messy clean-up!

I will make it again but add raisins and double vanilla. I used maple syrup rather than the corn syrup with more sugar and butter. Bread really soaks up the egg mixture!

I used 6 eggs and 1 cup heavy cream and 1 cup milk(just because that is what I had...may try with just milk next time). I cut outs 1 to 2 tablespoons of butter too. ?? I covered it for the first 20 minutes in the oven and uncovered it for the last 20 minutes. ?

This recipe as written is a Zero star. Read the reviews and you will be able to make something you can eat.  It is a shame to even have it listed because a lot of people will fail because they don't read the reviews. Mine was a success only because of the reviews but as written it is a total failure.

I've been making this recipe exactly how it says for years and I'm always asked for the recipe. I've used raisin bread or plain old white bread with the same delicious results.  I'm begged to bring this to our annual pot luck brunch each year - I bring a full tray and it's the 1st thing to go. Definitely a holiday staple!

I THOUGHT THE LIQUID WAS TOO MUCH, BUT MADE IT LAST NIGHT BEFORE BED, THEN WENT TO BED.  I SERVED IT TO GUESTS THE NEXT MORNING-TOO SOGGY!  I FINALLY LOOKED AT THE RATINGS AND LOTS OF PEOPLE SAID IT WAS TOO MUCH MILK.  YOU SHOULDN’T HAVE TO READ REVIEWS BEFORE MAKING A RECIPE.  THIS MADE ME SO MAD.

I loved this recipe and all of my 15 guests did too!!
I added pecans on top which added nice texture and great flavor. The only change I will make next time is to cut the bread slices a bit thinner. The recipe says 1 in slices and I may have gone closer to 1 and 1/2. Wonderful recipe!

I forgot the French bread, so I used some sliced sour dough and oat nut that I had on hand. Because of this I had to cut back on the half and half so it wouldn be soggy. It was super good and kids loved it! Thx for a new fave!

Excellent and my husband loved it.  I only made half the batch, spread in a 9x13 pan.  Also accidently poured ALL the ingredients together instead of topping with the sugar mixture.  Still great.

I used to make this recipe once a week! It's always a hit, but DO NOT alter the recipe. Follow it to the letter if you want it to turn out the best it can be. Yes, it all fits in the pan. Yes, you need all the liquid. If it turned out too soggy, you didnt follow the directions. Have fun cooking everyone!

This is one of my favorite brunch dishes to make for a buffet crowd, and I’ve made it about a dozen times over the past several years.  As usual for me though, I made a few minor changes........I use white/oat/cinnamon/and or raisin bread cut into cubes that I leave uncovered  a few hours to become “stale” rather than French bread, because the French bread is a bit too chewy for some of my family. I cube it because I cut and serve this in squares rather than whole piece servings. I cut the melted butter back to about 6 T. because it doesn’t all get absorbed by the sugar and is too greasy, in my opinion.  
Remember to use a foil lined pan beneath casserole while baking, in case the topping bubbles over.  If you halve the recipe, it fits nicely in a loaf pan.  Written as is, it’s still a five star recipe and tastier than others I’ve experimented with.

I followed others advise to toast the thickly cut bread slices, etc... I did not use the sauce as family/friends have different tastes (some love/hate maple  syrup/honey/sugary anything). 
So I set up a "French Toast Bar" with butter/syrups/jams/honey/whipped cream/nuts and let everyone make it to taste.  This is now a Brunch Classic!!

The only thing I did was cut the bread and leave it out to get a little firm before going to Easter Vigil.  Maybe that's why so many complaints about soggy middles.  All raves at this Easter Sunday brunch.

Wayyyyy too much liquid. It never absorbed it. I had to dump out liquid before I baked. Just like other reviewers I changed up the quantity of liquid I used next time I made it.

I agree with one reviewer, you shouldn't have to look at the reviews to better the recipe. This recipe taste delicious but it's way too soggy and too much liquid. I had to place it in the oven for double the time and it still was soggy in the middle.

I love this recipe  exactly how it is, however my husband thinks it is "slimy" in the middle, so I made a few tweaks. I only used 6 eggs instead of 8 and I also used Dunkin' Donuts coffee creamer in lieu of the 1/2 and 1/2; OMG AMAZING!!! I also took some above advice and baked it uncovered for 30 minutes without the topping, and then added the topping and baked for an additional 30 minutes. If you don't like it "soggy" drain the excess egg and milk mixture off after you turn the bread and let it set out waiting for the oven to preheat.
I also added raisins to the topping mix a few times when I felt like having raisins in it; delicious!

3 stars as written - I could see how this would be too moist with 3.5 cups of liquid. I did 6 eggs and 2 cups of half and half, as some of the reviews suggested. In the morning some of the pieces of bread still looked too dry, so I did 2 more eggs plus another half cup of half and half.  Also used a bit of almond extract in addition to the vanilla. 

It turned out great!

I followed the recipe except I added the syrup 1/2 way thru the baking. Half the syrup would have been sufficient. As others said, the recipe as written is too sweet and too soggy. I’ve made bread pudding before - this is soggier than bread pudding. The sweetness of the syrup overpowered the taste of the bread. I won’t be making this one again.

Put a pan under it!!! Took a shower while it baked and came out to find it had bubbled out all over my oven. Sticky, sugar mess stuck all over burning. Awful. Then I pull it out and it’s total mush. I have 1/3 out and out in another dish to keep baking. I hope it works. Looks like I will be cleaning my oven today.

Love this recipe!  I used 2 cups eggnog and 1/2 cup of milk.  While soaking in refrigerator,  2 hours in I turned slices over and let sit in refrigerator overnight.   When baking, halfway through bake time I turned slices and then continued baking process.  Absolutely a big hit! This is definitely a keeper!

I followed the advice of the other reviewers for this recipe and it was still awful.  The flavor was okay although nothing to write home about.  The texture is what sent this entire casserole to the garbage can.  It was so mushy and gelatinous that I could barely swallow my first bite.  Ugh.  What a huge waste of time and I had nothing to serve my guests for breakfast.

This was good. Way to much liquid. Eliminating the milk or using 2 cups of a milk/ half & half mixture is plenty for this dish. The bread is to soggy using all of that liquid causing  the sauce to just burn to the bottom of the pan. Next time I am going to use 2 cups of liquid (1 c milk & 1 c heavy cream) and add the sauce on during the last 10-15 minutes or just sprinkle the bread with cinnamon and brown sugar mixture. GREAT method for cooking French toast for a crowd.

I made this recipe years ago and found it on all recipes. From my notes, I used 6 eggs, probably why I didn't have to reduce the milk. 3-1/2 cups milk a mix of non-fat and whole. I also reduced butter to 1/2 cup, brown sugar to 1 cup. Used day old bread. I think I did flip the bread prior to adding sauce, like someone else recommended. Making it again for Mother's Day.

I made this many times. I always followed the suggestions of not adding milk and using two cups of half & half. I also used 5 eggs and 3/4 cup of brown sugar! This is my favorite breakfast treat and it taste even better the next day.

I've made it for brunch and even as dessert and it's always a hit! If I'm using fresh bread, I lightly toast the slices for a couple of minutes in the oven first. It is quite sweet on its own so to freshen it up I serve it with assorted berries and plain yoghurt

Perfect as written.  My family loves this recipe, it is always requested at overnight gatherings.  I flip the bread before putting it in the oven.  Not sure if it makes a difference or not.

I used my homemade whole spelt flour, which has a tendency to be a bit crumbly and this recipe worked fabulous! I only made 3/4 of an milk&egg mix to let the bread soak in over night and added 1/4 of it with butter before baking since it seemed a bit dry. Next time I'll make it according to instructions ;-). Great recipe!

This was excellent and I got raves from our guests.  Used 7 eggs, 1 cup milk and 1 cup half and half.  Flipped the bread over once while soaking, and once while baking and then added the topping. Took about an hour to bake.  Thank you Antlala for the recipe!

Like many others, I adapted this to meet my smaller family needs.  But I kept the recipe as written, with a few minor changes.  No half-and-half, but I used whole milk and added cinnamon to the caramel sauce on top.  I like a quick morning breakfast like this, and probably will let the bread and egg mixture sit in the fridge overnight, but this first time, I let it sit about 15 minutes and it turned out great!!  I particularly like the sauce on top, as it didn't need anything else but some fresh fruit to go with it.

This was sooooooo good!!! I read the reviews and did what most others had done - used half the amount of milk. I used 2 cups of half and half TOTAL and no other liquid and it came out perfect. I also omitted the corn syrup. I also topped it with a ton of pecans before baking. So delicious. 
My boyfriend and I ate this for Christmas morning breakfast and couldn't get over how good it was and how it was not overly sweet at all. Just perfect. Definitely halve the milk/cream. I can imagine it'd be a soggy mess if I used what the recipe said.

It was delicious. Added pecans halfway into baking, and followed a suggestion to bake 20 min. covered and 20 min uncovered. Yummy!

This recipe turned Christmas breakfast into a sloppy mess.  If you've made this leaving out half the liquid, YOU DID NOT MAKE THIS RECIPE.  You should not be rating this 5 stars if you have to alter it that much to make it work.

This was so good, my family loved it!  The best part is the crust formed from the brown sugar mix .  So if you don't like soggy  french toast make sure to lay the bread down flat (1 loaf squeezed into a 9x13 pan) so the crust can go all over the bread.  This is a keeper for Christmas morning!

I make this recipe all the time but make the following changes.  I use only 6 or 7 eggs, 3/4 cup half and half and about 1 cup milk.  I also use real maple syrup instead of corn syrup.   I also flip the bread before heading to bed.  Cook half the time without the sauce then add the sauce and cook the rest of the time.

We make it just as the recipe states; we own a restaurant and after LOVING this one Christmas morning, we offer it every Mother's Day as a special topped with fresh berries and it's a huge hit.  We've had it at home every Christmas since and in fact, I'm making it right now!

The only change I made to the recipe was that I cut the bread in cubes instead of slices and while the oven was heating up I stirred the bread and egg just to ensure that the bread soaked up everything.  My family and co-workers love this dish!

Better than the Overnight French Toast recipes with the syrup on the bottom! It was perfect with the following changes:
1) fit cubes of bread 1+" deep into bottom of greased pan;
2) only use 6 eggs, 1 tsp. vanilla, 1 cup milk and 1 cup half and half;
3) bake 20 mins without syrup on top, flatten puffy areas;
4) heat syrup just until bubbly, then pour over top;
5) place cookie sheet under & bake with syrup for an additional 15 minutes. If bread puffs up, the syrup will spill over. YUM!!
No need to soak overnight.

Excellent!  As close as I've come to the toast at the French cafe  in my 'hood.  I did not alter the custard proportions, but did change the topping by replacing the corn for maple syrup.  I also used challa bread that was dehydrated a bit by placing it in the oven at a very low temp.  
I've made this twice.  The first batch I cut the egg by one and deacreased the liquid by 3/4.   This batch was delicious but more the style of stove top French toast. The second, I followed the recipe as posted and  find  it more custard-like.  My family prefers the recipe in its original proportions as well. Also, I would suggest very thick slices of a dense bread.

I didn't have French bread, so I used a loaf of generic soft whole wheat bread. I subbed evaporated milk for the half & half, and used real maple syrup instead of corn syrup.  I didn't change the egg/milk quantities as others did, but it baked beautifully. Everyone who ate a piece loved it and wanted the recipe.

This recipe is a keeper! I didn't have any half and half, so I used 2 cups whole milk. I also wanted more of a casserole, so I broke up the break into pieces. Make sure you use a glass pan, because it takes some elbow grease to clean out all the sticky, but it is worth it!!!

I thought this was just OK, I always read most recent reviews, so did the 2  cups half n half,  6  eggs, etc. You really have to watch this toward end of baking, easily burns and sauce  turns into hard candy. Will keep looking for that perfect recipe.

1st time making  a baked french toast, though I did change it a little.  I used 16 eggs, 3 cups of half & half (no milk) 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, 3 tsp of vanilla and 1 lb of Italian bread (it came sliced, so I cut the slices diagonally in about 1" pieces and stuffed them into the pan).  I followed the directions otherwise.  I also left it in the oven and turned the heat off and let it sit another 20 minutes.  For the topping I used 2 cups of brown sugar, 2 sticks of butter and 3 or 4 tbs of dark corn syrup ( I had it already).   This came out awesome! Topped it with strawberries cup up with sugar mixed in for the juices.  No extra syrup was needed and all the kids loved it.  One of the kids called it cake.  So good!

I gave this recipe 4 stars because I don't know if it was my error or the recipe is bad. 1. I followed the suggestion of 6 eggs, 2 cups of half and half and no milk. There's A LOT of liquid that never gets absorbed even after cooking for 40. Is it supposed to be like that? I cooked it for 90 minutes. 45 each side and it tasted great. Not burnt. Nice and toasty like French Toast.

I'm going to have to agree with Tamara Grimes assessment. If I had not read the reviews prior to making this it would have been a complete disaster. As it was, I was able to salvage it by reading a few of the reviews and applying some of the "fixes" from them.

This recipe has entirely too much liquid and that caused the bread to fall apart, causing it to be nearly impossible to flip halfway through the cooking, which was absolutely necessary.

I will most likely try this one more time after making adjustments, but if I have this much trouble with it again, I am likely to just look for a better recipe.

Excellent recipe and feeds more than I thought! I baked two but only needed one. Sent the rest home with my kids. Delicious.

The only change I made was to use all coconut milk and vegan butter because of food sensitivities.  It was a little soggy but delicious and nowhere near inedible.   I'll definitely make this again!

I was hugely disappointed in this recipe. After all the rave reviews and altering the recipe to, what seems to be, a sure thing, it still came out soggy in the middle and way to egg-y. 
I cut the eggs to 6, 2 cups half and half (no milk), 2tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp cinnamon. Let soak overnight. Popped it into the preheated oven and baked for 20 minutes, pulled out to turn them but they were so wet I couldn't risk it without breaking the slices of bread. Put in back in for another 20 minutes, still way too soggy to even consider it done however, did turn them. Another 20 minutes, looked like they were done, thought they were done. Within a minute they deflated and looked like old prunes. When I cut into a piece, it was still very wet in the center and the flavor was overly egg-y. I did NOT however, use ALL of the syrup. But I couldn't imagine how wet they would have been had I have used it all!! I'm only giving it two stars because my sons, after putting powdered sugar on it, decided it was "ok".  I might try this recipe again with even fewer eggs and maybe a cup of half and half instead.

This is a great recipe that you can make your own personal changes to. We personally don't add the sugar or corn syrup  since my kids eat it with maple syrup drizzled over the top.. That's enough sugar for our family! Great recipe!

This is our special New Year's Day french toast.  I have made this a few times now with a 16 oz bag of homestyle white bread from the bakery.  I also reduce the eggs to 6, eliminate the milk, and increase the half-and-half to 2 cups.  I then bake covered  for 20 minutes, add the sauce and finish baking uncovered for another 20 minutes.  It comes out great - very sweet and fluffy.  Make sure to allow 15 - 20 minutes for the dish to cool because it comes out VERY hot.

Really good recipe except that next time I will pour out any extra liquid from the bread before I add the brown sugar glaze and bake. That way the bread will have a firmer texture.

I make this recipe every Christmas for my family and they love it! I use only 6 eggs and 2 cups of heavy whipping cream and two layers of Texas Toast bread cut diagonally or I'll cut French bread two inches thick. Before refriderating over night I flip the bread. Then the next morning I bake covered at 350C for 30 mins, then pour sauce over bread and bake uncovered for another 20 - 30 minutes. Came out perfect!

Made this to take to Christmas brunch at my sister's in 2015.  I used the French rolls from Costco - about a dozen of them.  The were pre-sliced in half and I then cut each half in two pieces so they were like French toast sticks.  Soaked overnight in 2 cups of 1/2 & 1/2 with the eggs  (didn't use the milk) and there was just a little liquid left in the bottom the next morning.  I baked covered at 350 for 15 minutes, removed the cover and poured the brown sugar mixture over and left the lid off for aout 15-20 minutes.  Used a very big casserole---I think it's 10 x 14, and it almost overflowed.  But there was very little left after feeding 11 people (we also had an egg casserole & biscuits and gravy) Don't burn yourself on the syrup when you take it out of the oven as it is almost carmelly  and I got my finger in it removing it from the oven and it stuck immediately!  Great recipe though!

Guess who forgot to read the reviews!! After 40min I could see it wasn't going to be done.  This can be saved!!! First turn down the heat. 275 or so. Transfer everything to a larger pan. I used a lasagna pan. Bake for 30 min longer give or take. check every so often. It will have a soft/pudding consistency as it is basically bread pudding. With crunchy edges. If you prefer a dryer/firmer type bake you could try baking it longer. Overall it turned out yummy.

I loved it.  Family liked it.  I tend to be the one who likes decadent food.  Family likes simple stuff with lots of syrup.  No syrup necessary for this delicious dessert-like breakfast dish.

This is the second time I've made it. The family loved it. We had it at our Thanksgiving Day Brunch and everyone said it was by far the best thing on the table. I will continue to make this. I've never used any nuts. The second time I made it I had extra bread slices and placed them on the top of the bottom layer. Next time I will break up the extra pieces and places into the small open spaces on the bottom layer, so there is a full stuffed bottom layer. No diagonal slices so all the bread can fit. Straight slices only.

This recipe is amazing, I make it any time I have guests! We are dairy allergic and I just sub the cream for non-dairy coffeemate. I've also successfully used coconut cream. I always add a few more spices like cinnamon, nutmeg or pumpkin pie spice because I like it a bit spicier. I also don't use corn syrup because I'm not a fan. Just pure brown sugar for me. 
You could also modify it and make it blueberry, chocolate or any other flavor that you like. If you like it sweeter, add a bit of brown sugar to the egg mix. 
TIP: After slicing the bread, I always toast it in the oven first and then cool it to make sure it is nice and dry to soak up the egg mixture.

Excellent, but next time I will use 6 eggs instead of 8 and half the topping.  I covered it for the first 20 minutes and uncovered it for approximately 35 more.  And it probably could've used more time.  I don't like it when it's mushy. Easy, good recipe.  Thx!

This time I replace the milk with buttermilk (no half &half).
And instead of using the butter and brown mixture, I used a 11oz. bag of caramel bits and hazelnut creamer. I melted the two together and poured  it over the bread , before putting the casserole  into the over.

I made this exactly per the directions, and it turned out horrible. For the sake of the recipe, I hope I did something wrong. It turned out like soggy bread soup. It was awful. I ended up popping in some toaster waffles instead. Disappointing.

I loved this recipe. I've made it several times, as is, and it always turns out great! I don't think any adjustments are necessary but as with anything, you can tweak things to your own personal taste.

This came out awful. I followed the instructions exactly but it came out super soggy on the inside. After eating some, I put it back in the oven for around a half hour. The outside was crunchy and delicious but the middle was still soggy.

First time I followed directions exactly and felt it needed adjustments. The next time I used what I had in the pantry. Made the recipe about 4 hours ahead of time for a brunch. I used 1  1/2 loaves of cinnamon swirl bread, 6 eggs,  2 cups of half and half with just 1 cup of brown sugar, used maple syrup and omitted milk - kept other ingredients the same. Turned out beautifully, not too soggy or sweet. It did not need the extra step of flipping the bread midway through cooking.

I tried this recipe for the first time for a family brunch and it was delicious. I did use heavy whipping cream rather than half and half because I bought the wrong stuff but can't say if it made a difference. I did not read the other reviews before making the dish and had no problems. It is very sweet, but everyone liked it. In fact, we ate on it all day.

Just another version, I cut bread 2" thick making a pocket, like a slice.  Mix 8oz. cream cheese, 1 egg, 1 tbls. sugar or splenda and 4-5 oz, apricot preserves.  Mix well and put inside bread slices.  Proceed with rest of recipe.  Enjoy Birdnurse

Loved it. I feel that this recipe is a great "base recipe" and could be suited to a variety of toppings or flavors.
After reading the reviews I too decided to cut down on the liquids. I used 6 eggs and 2 cups milk with some vinegar added (to sub for the half and half) and it came out perfect. 
I added two handfuls of chopped almonds to the brown sugar topping. It gave a nice flavor and texture.

I did not care for this french toast recipe!  It's a soggy, sugary mess!  I cooked it longer hoping it would improve and then put it in a pan to fry hoping it would get crisp but with no luck.  Even if it had gotten crispy, it was soooo sweet!

6 eggs, 2 cups half and half (no milk), 2 tsp vanilla and 1/4 tsp of cinnamon, soaked overnight, let sit out while oven preheated and turned each piece over, baked covered with foil for 20 minutes, poured sauce over the top and baked uncovered for the remaining 20 minutes. FANTASTIC!!! cut french bread into 14 pieces. use large pyrex.

The taste was wonderful, but I think that I am going to have to try this again. After reading another review, I reduced the eggs to 6 and used 2 cups half and half. However, it was still quite soggy. Also, one pound of bread does not fit evenly in the pan. I had to stack some pieces, which meant that the syrup did not get spread very evenly. Next time I won't do that and just use about 3/4 of the loaf. This is a good recipe, but you really have to tweak it to make it something delicious. To each his/her own.

This was good, but it wasn't my favourite. I didn't have cream so I used all milk and doubled the cinnamon. Before I put it in the oven I sprinkled each slice generously with pumpkin pie spice. I will try this again with cream and see if I like it better. I think this would also be good for a chilly Fall morning with pureed pumpkin mixed into the liquid mixture.

I didnt make any major changes to this recipe however I did reduce the milk and I made it all the day of. It looked and smelled great but the bread was literally sopping with milk - I even baked it at 375 and for about 15 minutes longer. If you plan on making this for entertaining purposes I suggest making a trial run first to see how you like it. My boyfriend said it tasted ok but he didn't get seconds which makes me believe he secretly didnt like it but didnt have the heart to tell me. I wish I had just made regular french toast!

Everyone loved the flavor.  It was custardy in texture.  I let the French toast REST for about 15 minutes when I took it out of the oven and it seemed to absorb some of the excess liquid.  Next time I may try to cut down the milk/half and half by just a little bit and see what it does.  This french toast is delicious when served with the Cinnamon honey butter recipe found on AllRecipes and with a good-quality maple syrup.

Unfortunately, this was not at all what I hoped it would be.  I have had baked french toast that I liked before, but this just did not work.  I decreased the liquid, per other recommendations, by nearly half.  It was completely soaked up by the bread in the morning so I thought it would turn out fine, however even after baking it an extra 10 minutes it was still soggy- each piece too, not just the ones in the middle of the pan.  I turned the pieces of bread over halfway through baking, but that did not seem to help.  They also stuck to the bottom of the pan like nobody's business.  The topping sounded good, but when I made it I quickly realized that it was not a syrupy sauce but a thick, gooey caramel sauce that hardened after being baked, instead of soaking into the bread.  I poured the sauce on when the bread was nearly done (and only on a few pieces) and those pieces were completely glued to the pan.  It was also incredibly sweet, and just too much.  I was really looking forward to this for breakfast, but it just was not good at all.

This was ok.  Tastes more like Monkey bread which we love but this was more work.  I used the modified version with less eggs and it was very moist but no doughy center.

Very disappointed.  I did all that I could to keep this from becoming a soggy mess, including; dipping the bread opposed to pouring the liquid over, turning, minimizing the liquids, and waiting mid bake time to pour on the "sauce"  I will not make this again.

I only used 6 eggs and followed Michelle Mullis directions. This turned out wonderfully. THe only thing is do not over cook. I kept thinking it wasn't done and when I took it out some of the brown sugar mixture had carmalized and was really hard and chewy. The middle of the pan was still delish. This will be a birthday breakfast treat for my boys.

This was wonderful. I decreased the milk by about 1/2.  I also didn't use corn syrup because I didn't have any.  I used pancake syrup.  I also poured the syrup ontop the same time I prepared this the night before.  In the morning I just baked it.  I also added walnuts and rainsins.

I made this recipe as directed by the poster, and it turned out very soggy.  I wish I had read some of the reviews before I attempted to make it, but I always make the recipe as stated the first time regardless, therefore I'm rating this recipe this way.  I will make it again and take into account reducing the liquids.

Made as is this recipe is not to my liking.  I really should have taken the time on this one to implement reviewers suggestions.  This was soggy.  It smelled wonderful, but was not to my liking.  I will try again with 3/4 cup each of milk and half and half and 7 eggs.

I have made this twice. The first time I used Michelle Mullis' suggested changes as well as replacing the corn syrup with maple syrup. I served it to a group of ladies for brunch and everyone was asking for the recipe. I'm trying to recall the texture and believe that it was chewy/crunchy due to the caramel sauce. I made it for the second time today. I started off the same way as before, but my bread was on the hard side so I thought I might need more liquid. I added more egg and milk (7 eggs, 2 1/2 Cups milk). The flavor was still wonderful, but I wound up with something much more resembling bread pudding. I prefer the first and will only use 6 eggs and 2 cups of half/half (or milk).

I absolutely followed the suggestions. I did dip instead of soak. I did lean them on their sides. I used just enough of the caramel sauce to make it a sweet treat and not a carbohydrate coma inducer. Cooked them at 350 then 400 (40+ min) after I leaned them the other way and quick broiled them the last 3-4 min. This crisped up the edges nicely. My family loved it!

I have made this recipe for our family Easter Brunch for a number of years now... They all love it.   I had a second Brunch to attend this Easter and they all loved it including the men.  It goes well with the egg bakes others bring. No additional  Syrup necessary!

Very good - my only complaint is that it is a little soggy.  Not sure how that can be fixed - maybe thinner bread slices?  VERY tasty though - this will be a part of our family's special occasions.

I planned to make only half the amount of french toast so I made only half the egg/milk/cream mixture, but then I ended up using the whole loaf of french bread because it seemed like so much liquid.  I'm glad I did because it turned out perfect and not too mushy like some other reviewers mentioned.

I made this for Valentine's Day breakfast. I took a reviewer's advice and dipped the breads in the mixture, rather than pouring the mixture on the breads. I'm sure I avoided a bigger mess, so I liked doing it that way. I followed the recipe exact and liked the texture. The bread was soft, but not soggy. The edge was firm, but not hard (I did use 1-2 day old French bread). Only downer: the taste was a little bland. I will add salt and pepper to the egg mixture the next time I make it, but this recipe is a keeper. Thanks.

I love to make this and mini quiches (try the crustless quiche from this site) on Sundays to reheat during the week for the kids.  The flavors get even better the next day or two and the kids love to have a 'special' breakfast even when things are crazy and hectic.  I love to use Safeway's French Toast Bread for this recipe, it just gives it a little something extra.

Really wanted to like this, but it was just too mushy inside for my family.  If there's a next time, I think I would just use sliced bananas and that might help.  After dipping in the egg batter (which was too much and we skipped the 1/2 & 1/2 altogether) we dipped the bread in an oatmeal, brown sugar, cinnamon mixture for crunch on the outside which was the hands down favorite part of the bread. But we also used regular bread, so maybe that was another reason why it was mushy inside...Sorry!

Loved this receipe.  I like it a bit soggy...but I baked it a higher temperature about 30 miutes longer.  In future I would decrease the milk by about a l/2 cup.  Also could do half egg beater and eggs to decrease the calories/fat grahams.  Also can decrease the butter in half in the topping and add a tablespoon of Caro Syrup....still adds lots of flavor.  Make sure you do not cover when you bake and give room to have the french toast rise above pan.

I made this for a Christmas brunch and it was yummy!  The candy-like crust tastes like pralines and I think would be improved by the addition of a handful of chopped pecans.  We garnished this french toast with a puree of "no sugar added" peaches and 2 teaspoons of peach brandy instead of syrup.  A dab of whipped cream just tops this off!

I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised at how well this turned out. It was crunchy on the top and super moist on the bottom with just the right amount of sweetness. You definately didn't need syrup with this one. Fresh fruit is an excellent topping for this sensational French Toast!

Good, a little soggy on bottom - probably could turn it and make it better.  Great for guest, I would have as a side dish not as the main just because it is as sweet as cinnamon rolls.

We made this with egg bread and it was very good. I liked the ease of preparing it the night before and finishing up in the mornings. Nice brunch/holiday recipe. I served it with country sausage and thought it was even better the next day. I did put the dish on a cookie sheet that was sprayed with Pam for easy clean up.

Really good!  I used french bread that was a few days old and didn't have any problem with there being too much sauce. My sauce did end up spilling over the side a bit, so next time I'll put my baking dish on a cookie sheet to catch any spills. This does come out almost exactly like a bread pudding though, so if you don't like that you probably won't like this much either.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe.  I make this for brunch potlucks all the time and I'm asked for the recipe everytime I make it.  Great dish to make for Christmas morning.  No changes to this recipe needed.  Fantastic as is.

We made this for a family brunch.  It was fanastic and loved by everyone.  Be sure to use a large enough pan to bake it in - ours spilled over a little while baking - it rises quite a bit.  Not a healthy breakfast by any means, but great for special occasions!

I've made this twice now, and it is a great base recipe.  The first time, I poured off almost all the liquid before cooking, and it turned out great.  The second time, I used only 6 eggs, and increased the half & half to 2 cups, but did not include the milk.  I still poured off excess liquid before cooking, and it turned out wonderful as well.

This was really good! I couldn't find a loaf of french bread the evening that I made this, so I used a baguette and it worked just fine. I made it for a girl's brunch with Mimosas and a Grey's Anatomy marathon. It went over very well!

I made this as written because I didnt want to tamper with the recipe since Ive never made french toast before. This came out VERY puffy. Almost like a egg-puff casserole. The french toast was very soft and did not have a crispy outside. My DH said it was ok but didnt like the technique for making it. I did like the carmel sauce a lot on the top of it...made it taste good. I dont think I will make this again...its kind of weird.

absolutely DELISH! I made it for breakfast at work and everyone gobbled it up. there wasn't nearly enough. i used challah bread and i'm sure brioche would be great, as well. my challah was on the smaller/medium side, so i had to pour some of the egg mixture out in the morning. otherwise it would have been baked into a sweet quiche-like french toast.

I thought this was delicious. I loved the sweetness of it. I was a little confused on how much milk and cream to use since I didn't have half and half here. So I used half milk and half cream and then a little more milk. I used the 8 eggs, but I think I might use less next time. It was very eggy underneath, but it blended well. I made it for a women's breakfast and everyone liked it. They said it tasted like bread and butter pudding and I have to agree so here in Australia it could pass for breakfast, brunch, or dessert. :-) I'd never made this before so it was a nice change.

I followed some advice by reducing the liquids. I followed the recipe exactly after those minor changes. My two pregnant friends thought this was the best meal they had ever had. I think it was a bit sweet and will leave the sugar mixture off of some toasts next time.

I cooked this at 400 degrees  because I needed to get it done a little faster.  It was great.  I also took 1/3 of the ingredients and put it in a  2.8 L casserole dish on the side. This was perfect.

This was the BEST baked french toast I have ever had.  I only made one adjustment, I cut the bread into cubes rather then leaving it in slices. It went farther that way!

Even following the modifications suggested by others (reducing the # of eggs and cream) and leaving it in the oven an extra 10-15 minutes, I still ended up with a soggy mess.

I love french toast and this recipe was ok. It's a bit soggy and the brown sugar/syrup is far to sweet. You have to turn it for 10min before removing from the oven. Next time I'll cut back on the cream and add a bit more milk instead and leave the brown sugar/syrup.

I made some minor changes to this recipe based on other reviews, but the results were great.  I used 6 eggs, 2 cups half and half, and flipped halfway through the baking time.  I added the syrup mixture after flipping.  We loved it!

Found this recipe the morning of...hadn't read the reviews.  Not big on mucky french toast so wasn't concerned with not having the overnight soak.  As I was putting it together, I felt there was too much liquid, so cut back 1/2 cup each milk and cream (thank goodness).  20 min to soak then combined topping mixture, reducing all parts to 1/3 of what recipe called for (again, thank goodness...plenty sweet enough).  Puffed up beautifully and tasted great, though still a little on the mucky side underneath...but not bad.  I cooked it a little longer too.  Was glad for the changes I made, but will continue to seek a drier french toast recipe.

After reading many reviews I made this with half the liquid and less eggs.  I'm glad I did as the other reviews of those who liked the original recipe wanted more of a bread pudding. I did sub. cinnamon bun coffee creamer in place of the cream and instead of slicing the bread I cut the bread into 2'' squares.  It came out looking very pretty, was simple to prepare (baked while opening presents), it's sweet, but other than that it didn't have a whole lot of flavor.  I plan to make it again keeping the bread in slices and maybe using more cinnamon and vanilla. I also think maybe it would have been good to bake 20 minutes, flip the bread, cover with topping, and then finish baking. It was hard to rate this since I didn't really use the original recipe. I would suggest making it your own and doing a practice run before serving.

Have made various versions of baked french toast casseroles and this was very good and easy to make. My guests gobbled it up. Think I'll add a bit more liquid and spice next time as we prefer more custard like that of a bread pudding.

It was good and wasn't difficult to make.  But I wish I would have read the reviews before I did it.  It did turn out pretty soggy, but still eatable.  Next time I'll try cutting the liquid mixture in half.

This was very easy to make and everyone asked for the recipe.  The topping that you put on in the morning made a nice crisp top layer.  I did a double layer of bread and wouldn't recommend doing it, it left the bottom layer soggie and it caused the juices to overflow in the oven.

Incredible!  I love this recipe... I used Vienna bread and sliced it in about 1 to 1-1/2 inch slices.  I didn't have the corn syrup, so I used honey instead and it worked fine.  This turned out absolutely delicious.

I made this for my husband and was pretty disappointed.  I should have read the reviews, but I didn't because it had so many ratings.  The french toast overflowed causing my whole kitchen to smoke.  Complete soggy mush if you follow the directions exactly.

I made this according to the recipe, and it didn't work for me. If I decide to make this again, I will definitely cut the liquids by HALF, and dip the bread into the mixture rather than pour the mixture over it.

I used 2 french baguettes for a total weight of one pound, and was barely able to fit all the bread in my 9x13 pan. I used 3/4c maple syrup instead of corn syrup and brown sugar, and baked it for 55 minutes (at 40 minutes it was a bit too soggy on the bottom for me). The top pieces came out crispy-dark, and the bottom pieces were more like bread pudding. If the pan hadn't been so full, it probably would have helped to flip them before baking. But the finished product was delicious and my family really liked it.

I make this recipe everytime I have company and everyone loves it!  Some of my friends request it everytime they come. I have never used up all of the liquid, as soon as I see the break is covered, I pour out unused portion.  I also don't ever use all of the syrup and it always turns out great!!

this recipe was delicious! I decided to make it this morning for lunch the same day. (so I had to alter the recipe a bit) I cubed the french bread and put it into a bowl. I poured the egg mixture into the bowl and chilled it for about two hours stirring occasionally to ensure the bread soaked it up. Then I poured it into the pan, and while it was baking stirred it about three times. then I let it brown under the broiler. it turned out wonderful!

Turned out a little soggy even after following all of the reviews.  My husband said he'd prefer "normal" french toast and I think it's just as easy as this dish.

This was soooo good, it reminded us all of sticky buns.  I was afraid of the bread getting soggy like some had said so I just poured the mixture on right before I put it in the oven and it turned out great!!  It was so easy to do everything the night before and just dump all together the next morning.  Thanks, I'll be making this again.

What a wonderful recipe!!!
A must try. I didn't add the brown sugar
syrup to the recipe (by mistake). So, I added pancake syrup when it had finished baking. It still turned out fantastic.

Oh my gosh, I love this recipe!  I have tried many baked french toast dishes and have never been satisfied, but this is fantastic and so easy.  It has a custard consistency and tastes so good.  Because of my work schedule, I prepare it on Sunday to sit overnight, and then my husband bakes it to be ready for when I get home the next evening.  I know it is considered a breakfast dish, but I really love it for dinner (no need for dessert).  Wouldn't change a thing with this recipe.

Very good.  I had my doubts when it came out of the oven.  But it firmed up once it was removed.  I added some chopped almonds, which was nice.  The only thing is that it takes considerable space.  I reduced the recipe to 6 servings, filled the 9 x 13  dish, and the 4 of us ate every bit.  I think next time I'll try it in a jelly roll pan.  But I would make it again.

The overnight french toast recipe I use puts the homeade syrup on the bottom, then the thick cut bread, then pour the egg mixture over the top. Refrigerate and bake as usual.

This recipe is amazing.  My favorite bread to use is sourdough that my boyfriend sometimes brings home from San Francisco.  It's nice to see that this recipe still tastes good when I make it a little healthier by using fat free milk and fat free half and half.  I cut the eggs down to 6 total.

I really liked it. My husband didn't so much. He doesn't really like anything sweet for breakfast though. I thought it was a lot like bread pudding. I sprinkled pecans on top and it came out very nice. I also put whipped cream on top and didn't put any maple syrup. The middle was too mushy and the eggs didn't look cooked so we didn't eat the middle.

I was really looking forward to making this after reading all the reviews.  Unfortunately, it was very soggy on the inside, to the point of like mush.  I was even sure to use less of the egg mixture and cooked it longer. After I ate a piece, I stuck it BACK in the oven.  The outer parts were pretty good but I would have much rather had regular french toast.  I hope you have better luck!

I used pre-sliced french bread. It was so simple and very good, and also very sweet. Yummy!

I made this recipe Christmas morning for my family brunch and it was very easy to prepare the night before.  Another family member brought another baked french toast recipe with cream cheese/maple syrup and while that was tasty, this was by far the hit and the pan was empty in no time.  I followed the other reviewers suggestions to reduce the number of eggs, milk and cream.  This one is a winner!  Highly recommed the recipe.

Took the others suggestions and reduced the eggs to only six and they still came out really mushy but excellent!!  I had stacked the toast in two pans but will seperate them into one layer on multiple pans next time to ensure they wont be too mushy, even though I dipped individually the sauce built up on top...one more try and it should be perfect!!

I made this baked French toast recipe for Christmas breakfast and, frankly, it was a disappointment.  Despite the use of a good quality French bread, the French toast ended up with a crusty top and a soggy interior floating atop a watery layer of egg custard.  It was not overly sweet, which is good, but it could have benefitted from something more in terms of flavor -- a little more cinnamon, maybe a touch of nutmeg, some raisins, or maybe a different bread such as challah.  Even regular French toast would have been preferable to this recipe.  I might try a baked French toast again, but not this recipe.

Love it!! Followed other reviewers advice and toasted my french bread so it would really soak up the egg mixture.  In addition, I cut it in smaller pieces and put them in the egg mixture then moved them into the baking dish.  I poured the left over egg mixture over the bread in the baking dish...YUM!!

Easy and excellent.  I've made it for brunch on several occasions and it is now requested.  I made no changes to the recipe except to double the servings.  It's also good the next day should you have leftovers.  Enjoy

I made this for a teacher appreciation brunch at my daughter's school today.  Wow, was it hit!  The only thing I changed was that I very lightly toasted the French bread before placing the egg mixture on top.  Thank you for the great recipe! :)

Took a lot of the advise, reduced milk and eggs etc.  Bottom line, it just wasn't that tasty.  I had 4 hungry teen-age boys who eat just about anything that didn't even bother to finsh their serving.

I guess I should've read some of the reviews because this did not come out for me at all.  I thought when I was ready to bake the liquid would've all been soaked into the bread, but not true.  I took out about 2 cups before I started to bake and when it was done it was still mushy.  I took out the bread and actually fried the bottom.  The taste was good, but way too much liquid.

I LOVE THIS RECIPE-THE FLAVOR REMINDS ME OF CREAM BRULEE. MY HUSBANDS FAMILY BEGS ME TO MAKE IT AT EVERY HOLIDAY! I DO A COUPLE THINGS DIFFERENT. I ADD ALMOND EXTRACT TO THE EGG MIXTURE AND I SPRINKLE BROWN SUGAR AND CINNAMON INBETWEEN THE LAYERS. AFTER IT'S COOKED I TOP WITH FRESH WHIPPED CREAM AND FRESH BERRIES OR FROZEN BERRIES I'VE COOKED SLIGHTLY WITH A LITTLE SUGAR. SO YUMMY!

This came out differently than I was expecting, the egg baked more fluffy than I thought.  Our family still enjoyed it and I was requested to share the recipe.  We topped ours with syrup, and it had a nice flavor.

I followed the directions and ingredients exactly.....unless you are a big fan of sweet egg souffle, don't bother.  It has the consistency of jello, which isn't exactly appetizing first thing the morning.  This recipe doesn't resemble any french toast I've ever eaten...

I made this once going up north and I have continuous requests to make this. My mother-in-law, who is the best cook I know even asked for the recipe. This is fantastic. You need to plan for it since it is prepared the night before, but its super easy to make and very good. I may try to lighten it up and use milk instead of the cream to make it slightly more healthy.

This recipe is definitely a keeper.  Next time I might just use 7 eggs instead of 8 though.  The only complaint I got was that it was a bit "eggy".  But it tasted soo good and was not hard to make at all.  It's perfect for hosting OOT guests.  Just making the night b/f and pop in the oven 1st thing in the am.  I can see myself using it over and over.

I was sooo excited to make this special breakfast, but it turned out to be a real disastere.  The french bread didn't fit in the pan... It was very mushy and eggy. Bleck... I wish I would have followed others reviews prior to making this. You live and learn.

More like 3.5.  The bottom pieces were more like bread pudding - not firm, a bit soggy.  Also borderline too sweet.  Will probably make again, but this is something I'd probably make only a few times a year.

i wish i could rate this 3 1/2 stars. i just can't give it 4. this was really sweet, way too sweet for breakfast for us, mainly because the sauce practically WAS candy. i turned the bread over during it's soak in the fridge and when baking and it still stuck a bit to the pan. it also looked very unappealing. i was the only one who ate it. it tasted good, but nothing new or exciting. sorry!

This recipe is delicious! I doubled it and was able to feed 21 people. Everyone really enjoyed it. I didn't change a thing about the recipe and it wasn't soggy at all. I will make this over and over. Thank you Laura!

Currently I am undecided on this recipe. I followed some of the previous suggestions cutting the milk in half. But I am not sure if I am wild about the syrupy sauce that gets put on top before going in the oven. I will try one more time.

I couldn't fit the loaf of bread into the pan so I ended up cutting the bread inot little cubes. I baked it for about 1 hour and it's still mushy in the middle and burnt on the outside. Aside from these, everyone raves about it! Will make next time with suggested modifications by other users.

Really really yummy. My morning was really busy so I wound up letting this sit two nights in the fridge. It did not affect the  recipe at all. Delicious; I will make again and again.

Very good, thanks for sharing! I made this for Christmas morning breakfast, and it was a huge hit. The only change I made was that I used Italian bread because that's all I could find, but it was great. Thanks!

It simply does not get better than this.  I have made this exact dish for a couple of years for several occassions, and I get more praise every time!  This was requested for a family holiday brunch this year, and will probably be a requirement for many years to come!

This dish was excellent.  My kids, who are usually quite picky, loved it.  It was a little soggy for my taste, so I might cut down a bit on the liquids next time.  Otherwise, I would definintely do this again.

My wife & I made this last Sunday & I have to agree with many of the other reviewers; this is way to mushy for our taste. We were sure to bake it for 20 minutes and flip it over as one reviewer advised to make it firmer and we even cut the liquids that you soak it in overnight in half per suggestions by reviewers but one person described it best when they said that everything but the crust was "like custard". The flavor is okay but the texture is not our cup of tea; we won't be making this again.

This was very good, I had to bake it for quite a long time so it wasn’t soggy but when it was done it was very good!  I would not add or take anything away from this recipe, it was very good.  Thanks for sharing it with us,  I will be making this again.

Way to sweet and very mushy in the middle.  I even reduced the eggs like suggested but did not make much differene.  Will not be making it again.  Would work better under dessert catagory.

Absolutely excellent dish.  Very easy and quick to prepare.  Everyone raved about it!  My only piece of advice is to put a cookie sheet underneath the dish as I found it expanded and boiled over. I will definately make this recipe again and again!

The flavor of this recipe was surprisingly mild, I expected it to be too sweet.  However, the bread was a little soggy.  It was borderline soggy/custard.  I want to try this again but maybe flip the bread like some of the other reviewers suggested and cut back on the liquids.

I made this recipe quite a bit healthier by using skim milk and fat free half and half, splenda and brown sugar twin.  I also flipped them 1/2 way through. My husband loved them!

I wasn’t sure what to expect with this, but it came out excellent! I followed the recipe exactly except I halved it because we had several other things too (bisquits and gravy from this site, bacon, and fresh tomatoes stuffed with feta cheese, green onion and parsley). I am not sure what people are doing wrong to not have this come out perfectly. The texture was excellent. Thanks for the recipe.

My husband loves this French Toast so much that he compares it to his favorite bread pudding and requests this as his birthday dessert.  It is now a Christmas brunch staple for our family.

This is an excellent recipe. Very tasty. I used 2 cups for the half and half and 1 1/2 cups for the milk and I also baked it for 5 more minutes than what the recipe calls for. Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!

I really wanted to love this and give it 5 *, but I just can't! I used stale bread and less eggs AND less liquid ingredients, cooked it longer, and it was still soggy.

I tried this recipe and it was terrific!
Due to not enough bread on hand, I had left over biscuits, and used 3 biscuits, and 6 pieces of plain bread cut into pieces. The biscuits I had cut into strips about 1/2 inch wide.  I then followed the rest of the recipe, and was very pleased!
I also froze the rest in foil. I then unwrapped this, turned upside down, and put in a microvable dish. I then heated at 1/2 power for 2 1/2 minutes, then full power for 3 1/2 minutes.
WHAT A GREAT WAY to start a SNOWY morning with 10 inches of snow outside!

We just took our Girl Scout troop and their moms for an overnight "stress-less" weekend.  This recipe was perfect for our theme since  you can make it the night before and not have to get up and do a lot of cooking in the morning.  It was a big hit with the moms and everyone requested the recipe.  We all thought it would be a great recipe for those that go "camping" and have access to an oven!

My family really liked the more it sat.  It was mushy when it first came out even after taking other reviewers advice and cutting the milk and eggs in half.  After sitting for about an hour it was perfect.  This recipe reminds me of Monkey Bread from this site.  Thanks

This is a great recipe and a must have for any brunch.  I make one change, I use the Pepperidge Farm French Toast bread instead of the French Bread and it puts it over the top!

This was great, I made it for Easter brunch and was really nervous because it seemed a little soggy before I baked it, but after it came out of the oven it was perfect, w/ a nice carmelized crust!  Everyone loved it and my 4 yr old is constantly asking me to make it again!  I did follow the other reviewers suggestions and cut the eggs to 6 and only used 1 cp of milk, other than that left it alone and loved it!

Yum.  I followed the other reviews and decreased the eggs to 6 and the milk to 1 cup.  I also used maple syrup.  Received rave reviews at a brunch.  However, it is very sweet, so don't pair w/ something that is also very sweet.  Will make again!

I made this for MOther's Day Brunch. I loved it but some people thought it was a bit too sweet. I might decrease the brown sugar sauce. No need for syrup. Great, easy made the night before.

This is absolutely delicious!  We had it for a mother daughter brunch and it was perfect.  It has convenient to make ahead and then just pop in the oven in the morning.  Thanks for a great recipe that everyone keeps asking ME how to make.

I followed the directions exactly, and the middle was soggy and horrible. I'll just stick to the run of the mill french toast, it's a lot easier of a process, I know how to they are going to turn out and the topping is usually just syrup.. not the fatty combo of corn syrup, butter and brown sugar. Plus the pan was a PAIN to clean, even when I buttered it as directed.

Excellent recipe and I love the fact that you can make it the nite before.  Perfect for when you have overnite guests.  Based on the reviews I tested this out on my husband and daughter.  I used 1 cup of milk and 6 eggs and it worked perfectly.  My bread was a little soggy but it was still tasty.  I think that the next time I would use 1/2 of the syrup mixture that you pour on top so that it is not sooooo sweet.  My husband said that this is the best breakfast I have EVER made and the best french toast he has EVER tasted :)

Very good recipe.I used only 6 eggs and 1 cup of milk as suggested. I also used King Hawaiian bread because of the sweetness and density to hold more liquid.

love this recipe. No worries! I only use 1 cup of milk and 6 eggs and I bake it a little longer and just wow! You need to make the sauce for this. It is a bit sweet but it really just is so wonderful when used moderately.

I took the other reviewers' advice and cut  back to 6 eggs, and 1 cup each of milk and cream. You do need to bake it about an hour. The really good thing about this recipe is if you need to keep it warm for a while it's still great. Two guests came 45 minutes late for brunch, and it was no problem to leave it in a 200 degree oven.

Very Delicious. Served it to 60 people at Xmas brunch. Have made it 3 times this month, each time a little different. I agree that using eggnog, buttermilk, etc. in place of milk would be good. We tried slicing apples thinly and putting them and more cinnamon in the bottom of the pan first. Used chopped nuts on top with the syrup topping. Most Excellent. Everyone raved and wanted the recipe. Used Maple syrup & butter as the sugar topping (could have used lots less) and let people sweeten as wished. We made a hot fruit compote to serve on/beside. Will make this over & over. I think people with "mushy" problems didn't bake long enough or had egg & milk out of proportion?

I doubled this recipe and brought it to work this morning for our annual Holiday Breakfast. It received rave reviews, and so far I have received three requests for the recipe.
It is so easy to make, and the night before prep. makes it even more of a gem. This will definitely be served in my home on Christmas Morning.

OMG...this was to die for.  If I could give more than 5 stars, I would.  I served it for a Bridal Shower Brunch and I made a vanilla custard sauce, a strawberry sauce, and banana rum sauce on the side.  YUM

This was an excellent recipe. Simple and great to be able to prepare ahead of time. Trying to cut back on the calories, I used 1/2% milk for the entire recipe, instead of milk plus half and half. Next time I will cut the butter back to a half cup. Make sure you cut the bread 1" so it will soak up all the liquid. Thank you, Laura!

This recipe was okay, but it turned out pretty mushy. Next time I will cut back on the milk and half and half.

Very good!  Served it at a women's brunch and it was a big hit.  There was very little in the pan left.  I used fat-free buttermilk instead of the milk and added some nutmeg, and used real maple syrup instead of the corn syrup for the topping.  It was a little mushy but no one complained and it tasted divine!

I made this for the first time for my girlfriends for a brunch. It was a huge hit, they both took home the recipe. I followed the directions exactly, even the baking time, and it was perfect, nice and bubbly and golden on top and definately not mushy, and I'm fussy, I would not have enjoyed this had it been mushy. Awesome recipe I will make it again.

I found this receipe to be excellent, more like a bread pudding tho.  The bread mixture is not  sweet as there is no sugar in the egg mixture so the topping is a perfect touch.  I did bake it a little longer til it was crispy on the top.  I tried it once and added a little sugar to the egg mixture and it was way too sweet like that, so went back to original receipe.  Thank you Laura!

I took this casserole to work and everyone loved it!  I would recommend cutting the bread pieces into sqares though, because it was hard stuffing them into the bottom of the casserole pan.  Also, I only used about half the loaf of french bread.

Out of this world!!!  I made this as part of a Mother's Day Brunch.  My family loved it.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  Although, the overall appearence was not the best...the sugar/butter mix is very dark.  Don't let the looks fool you!!!

This recipe got rave reviews at the brunch I hosted for Mother's Day today. My mom and aunt loved it! It was a huge hit. I did substitute chopped hazel nuts for the pecans, just for personal taste. It was great, I will surely make this again!

Jumping into the hoards of comments about this great recipe...it's painless, quick, and always a hit.  So much easier than grilling pancakes or waffles one-by-one and there are never any leftovers!  I can't make it big enough!

I wish I can say this recipe was great but 1lb of french bread wouldn't make one layer so I had to do almost 3 layers in a 9x13 pan.  The top layers came out good not soggy but the bottom layer was very soggy, I cut the milk in half and used 1 cup. I would love to make this again but am afraid it wouldn't turn out good.

Flovor is very good.  But I should have read more reviews before tring.  I also thought the bottom was too mushy.  But I think it would be oaky by reducing the liquid.  Would try again!

Excellent!  It was nice to have it all ready to go the night before.  My 3 1/2 yr old son helped stir everything together.  It was very tasty and everyone asked for the recipe.  I followed previous comments and cut down the milk to 1 cup and the eggs to 6, it was perfect.  I can't wait to make it again!

I had seven guests staying with me this weekend, so I made a number of casseroles, this one was BY FAR the favorite.  I followed the recipe almost exactly, but was a little worried about pouring the hot syrup directly on the cold eggs, so I wait until it had been in the oven for ten minutes.  Regardless, it came out perfectly.  I made two trays and both were demolished in about 15 minutes!! Definitely serve w/toasted pecans, it makes this wonderful dish irresistable.

This recipe is terrific. It was a hit. In fact, it barely feed 7 people though it says 12.I did decrease the milk, not 1/2n1/2, to 1 cup and still used 8 eggs. This decreased the sogginess. I overlapped the bread in three rows to fit it all in, but made extra sure to get every piece moist with the egg mixture before soaking. recommend this recipe to all who want  a simple, quick, delicious breakfast.

This was the best french toast that I have ever had.  Very simple to put together, which is important in our house with 2 small babies

I just didn't care for this recipe. It had no flavor and it was soggy even though I used less milk. The kids wouldn't even touch it. I'll stick to traditional french toast.

I liked this quite a bit, but will use less eggs and milk next time along with less caramel sauce on top.  Would go great with eggs and bacon, and a nice cup (or two) of coffee.  Soaked the bread for 10 min, not over night, still came out awesome!!!!

Loved this.  SO simple.  Aside from having to be started the night before, it took very little time to prepare.  Much sweeter and more rich than the traditional version; the topping reminded me of a cinnabon.  A wonderful brunch treat.

Thanks for a great recipe! I used the suggestions from other readers and not only decreased the amount of all liquids, but I also baked a smaller batch for fear of having a less than stellar-tasting dish on my hands. Boy, do I regret doing that… It was so good that everyone wanted seconds! By far, the easiest and best tasting French toast I've ever made!

I made this a couple of years ago and gave it 4 stars. I am updating to 5 stars now that I have toyed with the recipe a bit: only 6 eggs, less milk, and less half and half (I omit half and half if I don't have any on hand and just use all milk- still turns out great). Let sit in fridge overnight per recipe. The next morning, spray a baking sheet with Pam, transfer the bread to the baking sheet. Cover with the syrup and bake per the original recipe. Comes up crispier and delicious.

This is a great recipe...do follow the tips to reduce eggs to six and milk to one cup.  Also, I put it in the oven for 10 minutes while I made the topping for it.  After 10 minutes, I pulled it out of the oven, poured the topping mixture over it and returned it to the oven for 30 minutes.  Voila!  It was fabulous!!!

Easy to put together but cooked results were so soggy that the dish was inedible.  Might try it again, cutting WAY back on liquid ingredients.

The flavor of this was wonderfull. The only problem that I had was that mine turned out more like a wet bread pudding. I followed the directions so I don't know what happened. I think next time I will only use half of the egg/milk mixture.

Well, since I am notorious for never following directions...I didn't see the suggestions about 6 eggs and 1 cup milk.  However, I drained all excess liquid before cooking and lowered the temperature to 325 and cooked for 2 hours and also added more cinnamon.  I also added a package of frozen blackberries (thawed) the night before and served it with some fresh blackberry syrup. mmm mmm mmmm.  It was goooooood.

A soupy disappointment!  I put in extra french bread, and it was still swimming in raw egg even after leaving it in the oven for an extra 45 minutes!  I think this recipe has great potential, but if I make it again I will definitely drain off any excess liquid before baking.

I made this recipie using sandwich bread, (10 - 12 slices, torn into bite-sized pieces) and found that it was the perfect consistency - firm with the egg batter absorbed throughout. Those inclined to try it again may consider this option.
Brought 2 13x9s in to the office and it was VERY well received! I'm sharing the recipie (with my adddendum) with all.

I baked the dish for my office and it was a huge hit.  Everyone wanted the receipe.  I changed the receipe like the reviews were saying to 1 cup of milk instead of 2 and 6 eggs instead of 8.  I also cooked the dish an extra 15 minutes to make sure that the egg mixture cooked all the way.

This dish was easy to make.  Sorry to say but that is the only good thing I have to say about it.  Tastes nothing like traditional french toast, very disappointing.  Too soggy, sweet and "eggy".  Will not make again, sorry.

Exceptional baked French toast - makes getting up a pleasure knowing that this is waiting in your 'fridge.  Let it rest for at least ten minutes after it comes out of the oven.

This sounded so good. But, it was so soggy!! The bread was swimming in the egg mixture, and it baked into a big gooey mess. 
Sorry, but I won't make this again.

This sounded so good we couldn't wait for breakfast!  But what a disappointment.  I cut the milk and eggs down as suggested, baked it for an hour and still it was a mushy, soggy mess.  Thank God I didn't make it for company.  Please help...where did I go wrong???

I have a daycare with 8 kids.  This was so easy to fix the night before, the kids loved it, my neighbors loved it and we reheated the rest for breakfast the next day.  This recipe is definately a BIG HIT!

I made this for my niece's Baby Shower Brunch and we had so many requests for the recipe that we put a copy of it in the thank you notes.  I did as others suggested; used just one cup of milk and 6 eggs.

My husband loves french toast but I don't like all the steps involved - cooking in the morning is NOT my forte.  This recipe was GREAT - I could make it the night before (when my brain's still functioning) and it was wonder tasting!  Can't wait to have overnight house guests so I can show off this recipe!

This had good flavor..but I tried to convert down to 2 servings and it just didn't work.  The sauce was carmalized and there just wasn't enough moisture.  It's too large of a recipe for just two...but we ate it with fresh strawberries and blueberries and it tasted great!  I'll try it on a bigger group next time!

I found that I needed to add some more milk to cover the bread.  Using French bread and not loaf bread will require more liquid because it is more dry.  The sweetness was a little too much for our taste, and I will cut back on the sugar next time.  I also used real maple syrup instead of corn syrup.  Overall a keeper which will be added to our Christmas breakfast menu.

I also cut back to six eggs, 3/4 cup of half and half, and only 3/4 cup of brown sugar and it came out perfect!  I served it for brunch with my in laws and everyone loved it.  Great recipe, just needs a bit of revision to suit your own personal taste.

I made this for Father's Day brunch.  I had 14 people and they all thought it was
so delicious!  However, a few of the ladies asked to see the recipe and were upset
by all the high fat ingredients!  It is a special treat and so easy!

This is just too easy to fix! And the added help of being able to stick it in the fridge overnight and just pulling it out in the morning is wonderful and makes having breakfast for company a breeze.

I used only 6 eggs and reduced the amount of milk and half 'n half.  There was plenty of moisture to be absorbed by the one pound loaf of bread.  Very good.

USE STALE BAGUETTE BREAD and it turns out much better.  Reduced the milk and half and half to where it just covered the bread slices.  Used less sugar (I think around 1/2 the amount the recipe calls for).  It was MARVELOUS.  I made it on a Friday night and only had to get out of bed on Saturday to pop it in the oven.  Threw some link sausage in a pan to cook alongside it and had a nice lazy Saturday morning with vey little clean-up.

SOGGY!!  We made the original recipie and perhaps should have altered it as suggested by some users.  However, would not care to try it again.  Much too sweet and sat in the pit of my stomach.  Don't know how it got such high ratings.

WOW!! I made this for a women's brunch, using the revised recipe (6 eggs and 1 cup of milk)
It was sooo yummy, definitely a keeper for my family as well. (There was nothing left to take
home to hubby, so now I HAVE to make it for him!!!)

I confidently tried this recipe for a Mother's Day brunch that I was hosting for 14.  It was a smash!  Everyone loved it from age 2 to - well, let's just say that everyone loved it!  It is very easy, very simple and even good cold or reheated....I recommend making it in a disposable baking dish - no fuss - no muss!

I made it, like others, with 6 eggs and 1 cup of milk.  It came out very tasty.  Next time, I would use less of the "syrup"...it made it a bit too sweet.  I was suprised that it was not too soggy.  It came out just like freshly made french toast.

Mmm. The French toast has a delicious taste. It is very sweet, though, and I would make sure you make it as a side dish and not as the main breakfast dish.

Overall great recipe. I modified it to achieve a more crisp and less soggy version. Reduce eggs to 6 and milk to 1 cup and bake for 1 hour. The syrup really makes it so I increased it by half. I have made both versions and everyone loves the second even better.

I just made this for company this weekend and everyone loved it.  I did however change the milk to 1 cup and the eggs to 6, as suggested by other reviewers, and it turned out just great.  It puffed up and got really nice and crunchy on top.  It was just what I was expecting!

This was a great recipe! We let the bread toast a little before adding the syrup.

This was a big hit at my Easter brunch.  There was nothing left.  I did not use the topping because I thought it would be too sweet.  After reading other comments, next time I will give it a try.

I made this recipe on Easter. It was a big hit! I have another recipe for baked french toast, but this is much better(according to all my guests)The sauce that you put on just before baking looks like it is going to be too sweet but it is perfect and actually makes serving easier as you do not need to put butter or syrup out on the table.The kids also enjoyed this very much!

Instead of baking for 40 minutes; I baked it for  1 hour and it still was too soggy.  I would not make it again.

I made this Easter Sunday for my family. We loved it! Next time I will try using almond extract instead of vanilla for a slightly different flavor. This is one recipe that I will add to my collection of favorites!

Overall, I thought this was rather bland. Too much "egg" for my taste.
