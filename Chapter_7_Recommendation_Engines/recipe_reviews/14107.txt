This is the absolute BEST (and easiest) recipe for sweet potatoes I've found. I substituted brown sugar for the white & ended up having to bake it a bit longer. It was a HUGE hit, a MUST try even if you THINK you don't like sweet potatoes!

I made this for a crowd - it was a big hit - especially with my husband!  I did make a couple of substitutions - I used 8 large potatoes and doubled the sauce.  I used brown sugar and some honey - not quite 2 cups total but close.  I stirred and turned the potatoes several times and sprinked the top with a little cinnamon.  You couldn't taste a lot of liquor - just a hint which surprised me.  It was clearly an adult sweet potato recipe - not the cloyingly sweet marshmallowy mess and we really, really liked this one.  A real winner in our book.

I've made these with fresh sweet potatoes and canned as well.  The canned don't need to cook as long, but are almost as good as starting with fresh - and certainly a time saver.  I really love this recipe!  I've also used Jack Daniels for the whiskey and substituted Splenda or stevia herb for the sugar. You might want to cut back just a bit on the liquor as it can be overpowering for some. Great for the holidays!

At first I didn't think there was going to be enough sauce becuase the potatoes weren't even covered.  Some other folks that have rated this recipe have thought so, too.  But, you don't need to make more sauce, really!  If you make more of anything, then make more of everything!  (You're going to need a big baking dish, and turn occassionaly to help cook evenly.)  The potatoes will definitely cook down and the sauce will thicken up, and this side dish will be the first one gone at any potluck!!

I just made this recipe for Thanksgiving and my guests loved it. I tried it with half white sugar and half brown sugar as another reviewer recommended. I did make sure that upon heating the sugar, bourbon, butter and vanilla on the stove that all ingredients were completely disolved to avoid a "sugary" texture.Although the butter and bourbon mixture was never completely absorbed by the sweet potatoes, the resulting dish was excellent.(I am at high altitude, and some foods react differently than they would at lower altitudes.)Thank-you for sharing this recipe, Mozelle! You helped make our Thanksgiving a delicious one!

Wonderful recipe,Mozelle! A rich buttery flavor that enhances the taste of the sweet potato without the cloying sweetness we all dread at Thanksgiving. I'll be serving more sweet potatoes!

This was really good.  I cut the amount of sugar in half and added a quarter cup of honey for a more earthy flavor.  I also covered the dish as others had suggested and mixed the potoates every 15 min.  The only other thing I'll change for next time is to broil them with out the foil cover to have some crispy tops.

Fantastic!  A few changes, however, add some zip.  I used brown sugar instead of white.  Added 1 tsp. cinnamon and 1/2 tsp. nutmeg (I used freshly grated)  Mmmmmmmmmmmmm!  The bourbon cooks away, of course, imparting a wonderful flavor to the potatoes.  This recipe has become a Thanksgiving fave and this is the 2nd year my husband has taken it to the workplace potluck and it disappears before anything else.  A KEEPER!

Best sweet potatoes I've ever fixed - satisfies the sweet tooth without having to use marshmallows, syrup, etc... You WON'T have a problem at all with the potatoes drying out as long as you stir twice during baking. That way - the potatoes aren't steamed and have the little bit of sugar crunch to them without being dry at all!!!

I will use this recipe again and again - would be a nice way to impress guests!!!  All this and very quick and easy to boot!!!!!!!!!!

I took these to a pot-luck and they were a hit. I will say, though, I used fresh roots, and ended up cutting them up into 1-inch pieces and they still took about 30 minutes longer than it said. And I ended up using only about 5 sweet potatoes. Very good though.

This recipe was the hit of all our holidays last year.  I was so glad to still find it so I can mail it to more friends this year.  The men in our family especially liked it.  I think it will be my contribution to a family tradition.

I loved this recipe for a twist on sweet potatoes at the holidays.  It went over very well, but it made a huge amount.

A delicious fast and easy recipe. We took ours to a christmas party and everyone loved it. We sliced our sweet potatoes and it tasted wonderful. Our child didn't like them because of the bourbon.

I could not get the sweet potatoes fully cooked or covered by juice. I would either cook the sweet potatoes first and then bake them, or use less potatoes so they'd be fully covered.

I have to agree totally with another reviwer that "the sauce was not absorbed and it did not get crusty and brown". I would not make this recipe again. Hardly anyone at the table even wanted any and most of them like sweet potatoes.

I  made this recipe for thanksgiving and I made a few minor changes. I was making it for two people and the sweet potatoes were large, so I used two of them. I made the bourbon sauce as directed, but it didn't seem like enough so I made a second batch of it. I layered pats of butter in between the potato slices and added a pinch of cinnomon and ginger. These were heavenly, so good, I would recommend the recipe highly. I gave it 5 stars. i also used brown sugar in the sauce, instead of white sugar.

These were wonderful.  I used a slightly bigger pan. I lined the pan with reynolds non stick heavy duty foil(easy cleanup). After I poured the sauce over the top, I tightly put the same foil over the top. It all steamed nicely with more than enough sauce, and no need to stir.  I did allow the sauce to come to a boil for about a min. to make sure it was all disolved. The bourbon is not too strong, but really does add to the flavor. Yummmm

To much butter and was just not my thing.  I guess I prefer sweet potatoes with orange juice or marshmallows or pecans.

When this first came out of the oven, it smelled really strongly of raw bourbon. I was so disappointed! But it cooled to room temperature and was then reheated later for the family Christmas dinner, and after it mellowed it turned out very nicely. Everyone really liked it, especially the DH. I used all brown sugar for a more complex flavor.

The sauce for these is awesome!  After baking the potatoes I ended up taking a potato masher and turning them into mashed sweet potatoes.    Just as good.

I loved this, as did guests. I also found the baking time much longer than mentioned in the directions--well over an hour, in fact. And I also stirred every 15 or 20 minutes.

The best way to eat sweet potatoes!  Made this for Thanksgiving and my mother ate 3 helpings!  Be careful not to cook the sauce too long, as it could burn and you need to start over.  Now I fix this every year and we all love it!

This was a GREAT recipe!  I gave it 4 stars because I feel altering it would make it PERFECT.  Next I plan to use half white and half brown sugar (or maybe all brown) and about half the bourbon (it was not too strong but overwhelming).  Otherwise, a GREAT recipe.  Plan to make it again, thanks!

This is a fantastic recipe! It's unfortunate my wife is not a fan of sweet potatoes. More for me!

I increased the baking time by 15-20 minutes; the sweet potatoes were much more tender.

Very tasty and simple. What more can you ask! As good as any candied sweet potato dish and not as sweet. Use fresh sweet potatoes! I scaled it down for two people and it worked fine. Some people might want to double the sauce but I felt it was sufficient.

This was very good!  However, it did take a lot longer than 40 minutes to bake.

Though I like bourbon, I used some Applejack I had left over and it was quite good that way.

I used 1/3 the sugar and inclreased the Bourbon. I then cooked them on the stove top in an iron kettle and mashed them afterwards - solves the problem of having some dried out potatoes. It was a bit hit at Thanksgiving.

I didnt have bourbon, and the liquor store was closed, so we substituted cognac.  It smelled like wino potatoes!!  I also used a large dish, and it didn't seem like there was enough liquid to cover, so I doubled the sauce.  I also reccomend covering in the oven, some of mine were a little dried.  But dispite the strong smell, they tasted pretty good. I will make them again, but i'll probable add some OJ to the sauce, and use a smaller dish.

Great-not too sweet-sweet potatoe dish. I doubled the recipe & had so much liquid left after the potatoes were done,that I drained most of it & boiled it on top of the stove until it thickened!

This was terrific - not as sweet as I had feared.  I used only half of the butter, (if that - I eyeballed it), and it was plenty rich enough.  Make sure to use a good quality real vanilla extract, as the taste comes through nicely.  These were tender and flavourful (especially when served with fresh ground black pepper) and a definite hit.

these are good but I cut them like steak fries and let the sauce carmelize so that they had a little crunch.  it was awesome.

I tried the recipe as written and it was good. The second time I personalized it a bit. I cut the potatoes in bite sized chunks- try to get them evenly sized so they cook evenly. I used 1/2 lightly packed brown sugar, and 1/2 white sugar. I added 1 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, and 1/4 t. nutmeg. Instead of the bourbon, I used 1/2 buttershots liquer and 1/2 dark rum. I lightly turned and basted the sweet potatoes every 15 minutes or so, and kept checking the doneness. Before serving(several hours later) I covered the top with 1 pkg. 10 oz. mini marshmallows, then broiled until lightly browned and puffy. Try it, you'll love it!

I've used this recipe for several years and it has always been a hit.  I cook the sweet potatoes first, then arrange it in the pan.  I then pour the "sauce" over the top and cover.  I let it sit in the sauce at least overnight, so the sweet potatoes will soak it up.  Cook as directed, and they melt in your mouth.

This is the recipe I have used for years and have become famous for!  Except....mine calls for 1/3 cup of bourbon and 2 eggs and you mash it all together and then bake it. Little kids don't care for the bourbon taste but everybody else does!  I am excited to try slicing the potatoes this year, this is one of the dishes I look forward to every year!

I really enjoy these sweet potatoes. I have made them several times. Although,I have altered the recipe. I use half white sugar and half brown sugar at the recommendation of another review and preferred the taste. I also only use half the bourbon that it calls for.

Great recipe! I used Jack Daniels for the burboun, and also boiled the yams for 20 minutes before baking them, as I like them very soft. It came out perfect and was sooo easy.

I found this recipe to be overly sweet, it was a little too sugary.  The bourbon and vanilla extract gave it a nice hint of flavor.  The sauce was not absorbed and it did not get crusty and brown. I would not make this recipe again.

This is now my favorite sweet potato recipe!   Use a nice, smooth bourbon such as Jim Beam's Kentucky Straight.  Also, use  stainless steel pan for boiling the mix and also stainless steel pan for baking; this will give you a much cleaner flavor.  Cleanup is not as easy as if you had lined the pan with foil or if you used a non-stick pan, however those things will taint the flavor.  Anyway, I love this recipe; tastes lovely and  it's easy!

Family loved it. I made a few changes. Use 2 cups of Bourbon, 1 cup brown sugar, 1 stick of butter. Reduced all of that down to about 1 cup.  Add to blanched potatoes, bake for 30m.

These are amazing.  It's the only way I like sweet potatoes.  When I used 6 I needed to make more sauce, but I usually half or third the amount of potatoes and it's perfect!
