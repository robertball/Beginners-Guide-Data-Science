I made sure to spray the bottom of my crockpot before I layered in the enchilada ingredients. Instead of water, I used enchilada sauce and I layered a little on the bottom of the crockpot before starting
with the tortilla layer (I wanted to start with the tortilla on the bottom as to have a sturdy bottom when I went to remove it from the crockpot) and a little over the top when I ended with the tortilla/cheese. I served this with mexican rice and refried beans. Not a bad dinner but I think this would have turned out better had I just baked it in the oven. It was a lot of work trying to layer it in the crockpot for a "quick" dinner for me.

I tried this recipe the other day and it was REALLY good. The photo I added is before I had put it in the crock pot. I suggest adding a little more water while it is cooking because it was pretty dry when it was done.

I will definitely make this again.  I am busy mom with a busy family that enjoys Mexican food.  We almost always order enchiladas when enjoying our favorite Mexican restaurant, so being able to make something at home that tastes similar and can be made in a slow cooker is a BIG plus.  I wasn't exactly sure how this recipe is intended to be served, so I made some decisions on my own.  Rather than layer only one corn tortilla at a time, I used enough corn tortillas to cover each layer of the meat mixture.  It took 3 overlapping tortillas to cover.  For the last layer, I used 5 tortillas to cover the last of my meat mixture and covered the 5 tortillas with the final layer of the cheese.  After 5 hours cooking, I used a spoon to scoop out each serving.  While you don't get the nice enchilada rolls, you do get very good enchilada flavor.  As recommended by others, I sprayed my slow cooker with cooking spray, and I added 2 cups of frozen corn to the meat mixture.  When I taste-tested the meat mixture before assembling in the slow cooker, I thought it was a bit bland, so I doubled the spices. I am glad I did.  I used the 1/3 cup of water that the recipe recommends, but I may try enchilada sauce next time.  I didn't think he finished product was soggy, in fact, it was a tad toward dry.  I think a serving could be enhanced further by having some of your favorite red or green sauce to spoon over it, along with sour cream, lettuce, olives etc., as you like.

This was a big hit in my house! I have been making a similar version for a while the only difference is I add both pickled and fresh jalapenos for more spice.  I also add a can of corn to the mix and completely leave out the water, you don't need it. Serve this with a dollops of sour cream and a couple dashes of hot sauce and it will be a crowd pleaser.

I have been making this for many years after finding it in the TOH magazine. It is such a simple recipe that can easily be altered to fit your taste (although I never have). We do use flour tortillas, but have no doubt that corn tortillas would be just as good {or better}...I may just try them next time! Note: The photo added was taken before I actually turned the slow cooker on. After 3 - 4 hrs on low, it turns into cheesy goodness! Great topped with lettuce, black olives, and sour cream too.

I also greased my crock pot. I followed the recipe as written and my entire family loved it. I heated up a spicy chipotle sauce and a roasted Pasilla chile sauce and served them in little bowls on the side letting everyone choice there own heat level. Mom liked it as is and so did I but I also enjoyed it with mild and smoky flavor of the chile sauce. Bill went for the spice. I served this with greens and bacon. As I said everyone enjoyed this dish very much.

Great meal to come home to after a busy day. Very easy to make. I doubled the salt and pepper and served with olives and sour cream as someone else suggested. My family loved it!

This was pretty tasty and easy, but I thought it could use a tad more flavor and a little more water.  I will probably double the spices next time.

Update: I made it again with the water and the spices doubled, and it was just perfect! I also added about 1/2 tsp paprika. I baked it in the oven at 350 rather than the crock pot (about 15 mins with aluminum foil and 5 mins without).

made this for dinner last night to use up leftovers in the fridge so a few changes were made.  first, I used ground beef instead of turkey and a can of red enchilada sauce instead of water.  I also added a small bag of frozen corn and a cup of uncooked white rice.  the enchilada sauce was enough for the rice and it came out perfect, not runny or too dry. it was delicious.   I would not make this with flour Tortillas because they do not add flavor to the dish like corn Tortillas do.

I made this (per the recipe) for a friend that just got home from the hospital.  They loved it.  I made it for myself and I used 2 lbs of ground turkey rather than 1 and I put a cup of chopped banana peppers in also.  Gave it just a nice mild zing.  If you prefer more spicy, try 2 cups of chopped banana peppers.  I made my layers a lil thicker and ended up with 4 layers rather than the 6.  I used a 4.5 Qt crock pot and when I placed my tortillas in, I used more than one tortilla per layer cause I tore and spread it to completely cover the turkey mix rather than a single tortilla in the middle of the mix.  Lastly, I tore up some fresh cilantro leaves (removing the stems) and sprinkled them over the cheese of each layer.  That took about 1 1/2 cups of the fresh cilantro.  This recipe will definitely be on my fav's list.

We are trying to go low carb so I just cooked it on the stovetop and just made turkey taco bowls, did not even use the slow cooker, left out the tortillas.  Everyone really  liked it including the kids and husband!  The kids ate it over a little rice. Had cilantro, salsa, lettuce, sour cream to add as we liked. Turkey had good flavor.  Everyone said I had better cook it again!

I will make this again and add additional spices, cumin, all of the spices MORE OF THEM.  Otherwise very good.  My layering was different than described (three corn tortillas per layer). 5 hours is plenty of cooking time.  Didn't spray the crock with anything.  Maybe added a bit more liquid last hour of cooking. This was very easy to make and provided a satisfying meal that my husband (the family chef) even enjoyed.  I think he's just happy anytime I cook something giving him the night off!

It was easy, but I think I didn't use enough corn tortillas, so it tasted more like chili.  I did use beef instead of turkey but the flavor wasn't what I expected. Probably will not make it again.

Nothing about this is like an enchilada. I followed the recipe except for the slow cooker part. I baked it in the oven at 350 for 20 minutes covered, and 10 minutes uncovered. We liked it but felt it needed more pazazz, so will probably add a can of green chiles and maybe a second can of Rotel tomatoes with green chiles. I also served on the side some guacamole, sour cream and chopped black olives to put on the top.

I didn't like the texture of eating mushy tortillas. If I tried it again, I would do what some other reviewers suggested and decrease or leave out the water or use enchilada sauce instead of water. I didn't find it had a lot of flavour. I also agreed with another reviewer that I would like a firm bottom to the casserole. So I agree that putting a little enchilada sauce on the bottom and making the first layer tortillas would be preferred. I wonder if it would have tasted better done the traditional way, rolled in the oven.

I really enjoy making this meal.  It's simple and yummy.  It's a great meal to make when having a couple friends over.  I have renamed this meal: Enchilada Lasagna.  The cheese and the tortillas all melt together to make a delicious-ooey-gooey dinner.  I have made this meal three times already and will most likely make it again.  The only thing I need to figure out is how to not let the very bottom tortilla burn.

Might have been me but he tortilla shells ended up too mushy for my liking.  It all tasted good...texture was wrong.

This was very good.I used flour tortillas. Put together Saturday night. Sunday morning plugged it in before church. Had dinner all done when we got back home.
