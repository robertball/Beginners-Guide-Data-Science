This is almost exactly like the summer sausage that has been handed down to me by my grandparents. It is the best sausage I have ever eaten! Our recipe uses garlic salt instead of garlic powder and has 1/2 teaspoon of black peppercorns per pound of meat.  It is really good when made with ground turkey too. That is the way I usually make it these days.

Oh my goodness.  I can't believe how easy this is to make and how wonderful it tastes.  Thank you for this recipe.  I took 3 logs to Christmas Eve and Christmas Dinner and there was none left.  My brother was asking me to make some with some deer meat he had.  I will be making a lot of this and putting it in my freezer for a quick snack for unexpected guests.  I bought 10 pounds of hamburger to make some so I would have it for New Year's Eve.  I think I will add jalepenos to one batch.  Thanks again for this easy recipe.

I followed this recipe exactly. I used a very good quality of beef, 100% home raised angus. The sausage turned out great! Next time I will experiment with more spices, possibly adding a little more red pepper for an additional kick. I think I will also try adding some venison for a gamier flavor. All in all...good recipe.

I mix up about 12 lbs of venision to 3 lbs ground pork. The first batch I cooked was good but very dry. I cut the cooking time back to about 6-1/2 hours for my next batch and it was much better. I mix for 15 lbs of meat.

EXCELLENT!!!  I doubled the garlic powder, cayenne pepper, red pepper flakes and I used Mesquite liquid smoke.  I also used Tony's more spice for the salt.  Kids and husband LOVED it!  Making some now for late Christmas presents.  YUM!

This recipe was disappointing. It wasn't BAD, as such, just not good. It seems to be missing something, some flavor or spice that I can't put my finger on. My husband and I both were expecting something somewhat sweeter, for some reason. I'm not going to throw this away...it's not that bad. I'll serve it for company and whomever likes it will get to take it home :~D I won't be making this one again, because I'm sure there's something better out there. Oh, FYI, I did use all beef (90% lean) and followed the directions and amounts as presented, making no changes.

this is great stuff, but i have questions for TGFROST. Looking at other recipies on internet, some say to wrap in foil and poke holes in bottom, will this keep the out side from getting to hard and chewy?  And I found a recipie just like this except smaller portion and they added water, what is the difference? I am going to try with venison and turkey next. Thanks Lisa

THANK YOU for this recipe! Everyone loved it. I will be making this often. I used deer this time but will try beef for the next batch. I doubled the liquid smoke and added about 3 teaspoons of peppercorns. I omitted the cayenne pepper just because I couldn't find it at the store. For the curing salt I used Mortons tender quick. I cooked them in my roasting pan. That worked perfect

Made to the recipe. Had never made summer sausage before so I pretty much had to. My husband raved! He will be making sure I make this again. Would make great hostess or small gifts around the holidays. You can be sure no one else will be giving homemade summer sausage, but take the recipe because you'll be asked!

First had this 10 years ago at an office party.  Loved it and was so glad to find the recipe.  Exactly like I remembered it.  Really tasty, perfectly seasoned.  My picky husband and son loved it so that is saying something!  My husband wants me to try it again using half venison.

This is a great base recipe. We didn't add the liquid smoke because we put the sausage in a casing and hang it in the smoker to cook. As you see many added more spices and made it to their liking. Love to take out of the freezer when needed.

I like your recipe, although I would stuff it into non-edible skins with a sausage stuffer before cooking.  One thing I will comment on is that Morton's Tender Quick is not sugar based (at least not the bags of it I have), it is a mixture or ordinary table salt and potassium nitrate, essentially cure #1 with enough salt in it to make it easy to measure.  So if you want sugar in your recipe for some reason you should add it separately.  Cure #1 is the cure you want to use for cooked things so it is absolutely the right cure for this cooked sausage.

This is my second time making, everyone loved it so much the first time, we decided its a keeper recipe!  I used ground turkey this time and added peppercorn.  Can't wait to taste.

This turned out a bit more bland than we expected, and was pretty dry, going to try adding a bit more spice and add in some pork, and perhaps reduce cooking time or make the rolls a little thicker and shorter. not giving up on the recipe though.

Way too spicy for us.  This was my first try at sausage of any kind and it was easy but we do not care for highly spiced foods. Next time I will leave out the paper flakes and probably the other “hot” spices. Mustard seed, garlic will stay and less salt.

Wow! We have a freezer full of beef and venison so I used a couple pounds to test out the recipe. It is delicious! I added extra spice and smoked paprika to one log and made one more mild. They are both getting rave reviews! I will probably make a bunch more to bring to holiday parties with Home smoked cheese. Thanks for the recipe!

Followed the recipe exactly. I was expecting it to taste like store bought summer sausage, but it has a weird flavor. It's not necessarily bad, but doesn't taste like summer sausage... I'm not sure what to think..

Well it's okay but I made it better. To two pounds of hamburger I added one pound of ground pork, one cup of cold water, 2 TBL of Morton Tender Quick, 1TBL of liquid mesquite smoke, one TBL of  garlic juice, one TBL of onion powder, one TBL of mustard seeds, one Tsp of ground cumin, one teaspoon of red pepper flakes, one tsp cajun- louisana seasoning blend, and one Tsp of black pepper. I wrap my summer sausage in 1 lb chubs in plastic wrap and let  it in the fridge for 24 hrs and then re wrap the chubs in aluminum foil then punch holes( 3 or so) in the aluminum foil on the bottom with a knife. Lay them on a rack with a cookie pan underneath and bake at 300 degrees F for 1 and 1/2 hours. Best way tho is to use a meat thermometer and as soon as the internal temp reaches 160 remove the chubs keep in the foil and let them cool naturally. Re-wrap in foil and refrigerate or freeze. Tastes pretty close to store bought.
