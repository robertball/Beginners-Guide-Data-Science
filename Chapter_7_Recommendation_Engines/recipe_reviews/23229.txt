I love the idea of these bars, but found them difficult to make and wasn't pleased with the results. The caramel was very hard to manipulate as it was so sticky, and there should be some note as to the best way to melt them (mine started burning). It was also hard to spread the caramel over the dough, and then when it was chilled, it was very hard to cut the bars. Also, they didn't hold together well when I tried to dip them into the chocolate. I may not have let the dough chill long enough, but overall I found this recipe difficult and not really worth it.

After reading the other reviews, I made the following change.  For the caramel layer I melted them in the microwave with about 3 Tablespoons of milk.  this made the mixture easier to spread and cut.  they were great!

The carmel was trouble to work with; too thick mixing it, then after chilling it was too hard to cut.  The top layer seemed more like peanut brittle then carmel.
