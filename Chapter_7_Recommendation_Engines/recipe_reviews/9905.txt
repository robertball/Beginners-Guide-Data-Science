I figured out why many people are saying there's not enough crust! The recipe ingredients have been scaled to 1/2 the original and it is stuck at that serving modification but the instructions are for the original yield of 24 (2 dozen - see intro text under "submitted by"). So, of course half the ingredients would not really work in a 13x9" pan. Either bake the current modified version in a 9x9" or 8x8" pan or double the ingredients and bake in a 13x9" pan. They are good!! I would recommend pressing the butter/cracker mix down into the pan. I used fat free saltines and fat free s.cond.milk and pecans instead of walnuts with good success as well.

i luv this recipe because i can put whatever chips and nuts i have left from making x-mas cookies (this years batch has milk chocolate,white,and butterscotch chips w/ pecans and cashews). i've found that 1 stack/sleeve of crackers and 1 stick of butter/marg. makes a perfect crust. then put any chips or nuts and coconut u like on and ONE can of milk.

This is simplicity at its best!  I made these without the optional nuts and cooked them in mini-muffin pans for 12 minutes.  (It yielded 40 "cookies".)  So deliciously sinful and easy-- I'll definitely be making them again!

UPDATE: I just made these again, this time doing it bar-style.  Aaaahh-- I can't decide which way is better, but I sent them all to work with my husband, and he called me to say that his co-workers said that they were awesome.

I was unsure about using a soda cracker crust for this recipe, thinking it would taste odd. But it turned out to be very good. I took the advice of others and increased the soda cracker crumbs to 1 1/2 cups, and kept the butter at 1/2 cup. I think it created just the right amount of crust. Since I used salted crackers and salted butter, the flavor of the crust was just right, too. Because our family doesn't like super-sweet desserts, I used unsweetened flaked coconut (which you can purchase at a health food store or in the grain-cereal section of a supermarket). We tried the recipe twice, once with the semisweet chocolate chips and walnuts, and the other time with milk chocolate chips and pecans, using the same measurements. Both tasted great. Thanks for a delicious recipe!

Amazingly easy, delicious, and supremely adaptable.  You could use any type of crackers for the crust(well, probably not onion or garlic-flavored crackers!)and the rest of the ingredients may be swapped out.  For example, I used soda crackers, toffee bits, semi-sweet chips, and a sturdy cup of pecans.  I melted the butter in the pan while the oven was heating up, then just mixed in the crackers and pressed down the crust. I omitted the coconut due to family allergies, and they STILL came out fabulous!  Thank you so very much for this recipe!

Very good, easy recipe.  I liked the way the crust turned out, with whole-wheat saltines.

These couldn't be any easier!  You'll never know they're made with saltines -- they form a wonderful crust when it's all done.  Very rich, absolutely wonderful!

Could this be easier and yummier! the crackers are really good in this too. Ive tried to spread the cracker mix onto the bottom of the pan but it would never fit so i increase the crackers and butter a bit.. adding about a 1/2 of what was called for again... so about 1 1/2 c. crackers and 3/4 c. butter.
Once, for a variation, I also added about 1/4 c. of peanut butter chips as well. YUMM

I had high hopes for these simple bars... They were very easy, but they turned out soggy; I can't cut them into bars. Not sure why this is... I like the simplicity and the variations one can make (I used pecans instead of walnuts and added butterscotch chips in mine). Prob will not make again...

very good, very easy recipe.  i made this with nonfat sweetened milk and it still was a verrrry sweet, chewy bar cookie.  in the future i think i'd double the cracker layer to cut a bit on the sweetness.

My son made these. First I thought there would not be enough crust. It turned out to be good. We used directions as given. Except we did not have walnuts, we used pecans. Will make again.

It diddn't taste very good, it had to many random ingredients in it. I think you should cut down on some of the ingredients.

interesting flavors with the soda cracker crust, tones down the powerfully sweetness of the topping a bit. Good recipe if you need something in a hurry!

Definitely agree with the review from Teresa. These work much better with 2 cups of cracker crumbs. The crust came out too soggy and greasy with only one cup. I like the use of saltines since I think regular 7 layer bars are too sweet. But the Hello Dollies II, that use vanilla wafers are better.

I liked this recipe, but they tended to fall apart a little bit.  I am used to doing this with graham crackers.  I do prefer the saltines.  However, I did use a bit more saltines and butter to cover the bottom of the pan.

I like using the soda crackers instead of Graham crackers. Not sickening Rich. I agree the crust is too thin and I will double that next time. I will also spray the inside of the pan sides. Very good flavor.

Not half bad.  I read an earlier review that commented on the lack ofsaltiness in the crust layer, so I added about 1/8 tsp salt to the cracker crumb-butter mixture.  I also threw in some butterscotch chips along with the chocolate chips.  Very rich with a salty note to the crust that helped to balance the the sweetness of the filling.  Next time I think I'll leave the butterscotch chips out though.

These were OK. A lot like the seven layer bars I am used to. I didn't think the crackers added anything but a layer. They provided no flavor. I thought there was going to be a salty kick to the sweet, but there wasn't. I'll just stick to the regular graham cracker crust next time. I found the crust part bland.

Pretty tasty! The first time I made this I used a 9x9 pan and it worked fine. These bars are delicious, chewy and very chocolaty. There can be many variations done for this tasty snack. I love using this crust the best though because it's light and doesn't make the bar any sweeter (because its already VERY sweet as is.) I might reduce the butter in the base next time or increase the crumbs for the base so the crust will be less greasy.

Tried these bars the other night. Very easy to make, but I agree with other reviewers that the amount of crust is just not enough for a 9x13 pan. I upped it by 1/2 as well and it seemed to work just fine. Also, next time I would defintely bake the crust for a few minutes before adding the other ingredients. Although the taste was terrific, the crust was soggy and fell apart easily. VERY tasty and unique however and worth making again with modifications!
