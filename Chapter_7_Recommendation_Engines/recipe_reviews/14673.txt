Tonight's liver & onions entree was the best I've ever eaten in my lifetime. The liver was very tender and mild flavored. Perhaps contributing to the tenderness was the fact I did soak the liver in milk first for about four hours. Also, it seemed one teaspoon sugar was adequate because I used sweet Spanish onion, sliced rather than diced. Another thing I did was cut the liver slices into smaller pieces, added salt and onion powder to flour, and after dredging, browned quickly in batches. This recipe as I made tonight is company perfect--absolutely delicious for liver lovers and a special taste treat for those who say they don't care for liver.

I made a liver lover out of my sweetheart with this recipe!
I did not cut the liver up but did add cooked crumbled bacon as a topping. I served with potaoe halfs filled with butter, bacon, melted cheddar cheese and topped with the sour cream.

This is the quintessential beginner's liver and onions.  Easy to make and tasty.  I gave it three stars just because of a couple of tweaks it really needs.  First, unless you really enjoy the very strong and sometimes bitter liver flavor that often gives it a bad name, which I actually do but most do not, you must soak the liver in milk first.  Just put the sliced liver into a shallow dish and add just enough milk to completely cover it.  Let if soak for about an hour and then take it out and pat it dry before moving on to the dredging step.  The second tweak is simply to season the flour with salt and pepper...some garlic powder is really good too.  That's it...other than those things this is the best recipe to cut your teeth on when cooking liver.  Oh, I also prefer the onion sliced rather than diced but that's just a matter of preference.  I have to give props to the cook for recommending the correct cooking time for the liver as so many recipes call for way too much time and overcooked liver is tough and not appealing at all.  Kudos to Lola for the cooking lesson.

delicious! although my bf said it was very good, he also explained to me, that when he cooks his liver, he adds water to it about 3/4 of the way through cooking and lets it simmer for 15 min. claims it makes the liver much more tender

This recipe is ABSOLUTLY wonderful !!!
The sugar takes away the bitterness of the liver.
You would have to have ZERO tastebuds to say this is a bad recipe or just not like liver !!
Will make again !

Wow, this is SO good...never would have thunk it!  The 2 keys to this meal are to  use real butter, and don't forgo the sugar.  I used 2 onions and doubled the sugar, but it was just a tad too sweet; would use 3 tsp next time.  My kids weren't terribly impressed however.  When I remarked that I thought that this was exceptionally good liver and onions, my son replied, "Yes, it is exceptionally good liver and onions.  But it still  tastes awful, because it's liver and onions!"  Oh well, you can't win 'em all. ;)

Best liver and onions I have ever eatten. Absolutely delicious.  I pretty much followed ther recipe as written but used less butter and a little olive oil to caremalize the onions to make it healthier.  Also seasoned up my flour a bit.  At the end dump the onions back in with the liver and add about 1/2 water, cover and cook for additional 5-10 minutes and it makes a beautiful gravy.  I should have taken a picture it was so pretty.  The liver was so moist, not at all dry.  My liver came in a package and was already cut up so I didn't have to slice it. Don't worry if some pieces are smaller, they all come out good.

Very delicious!  This is the way I make Liver and Onions.  The only thing I would change is the amount of onion.  You can't "smother" a pound of liver with 1 carmelized onion.  I use at lease 4!  Thanks for sharing.

I used this recipe as a guidline last night and it was a tremendous help and also helped ease my mind about the liver turning out to tough. I had never cooked liver  due to the horror stories of hearing how it turns out tough like shoe leather lol. So in the past I always just had my grandmother make it for me lol I read over alot of the comments first before using it and adapted some of the suggestions. Sprinkled salt n pepper directly on top of one side of the liver before flouring, used whole slices of liver instead of slicing into 1/2 pieces, cooked in electric skillet on 250 for about 3-4 minutes on each side, 2 onions instead of one and only one teaspoon of sugar in them. My boyfriend said it was fantastic and that I now know how to cook liver sense it turned out so tender! haha Yay! I did it. If I can, anyone can! Ooops! I forgot to take a picture, but I have to say, it did turn out really pretty! Maybe next time! Thank you very much for sharing this recipe!

I had a craving for liver and stopped by a local restaurant and was so disappointed that I was determined to fix my craving by making it myself.  I am SO glad i found this recipe.  It was PERFECT.  I didn't have any milk so I soaked liver in a mild salt water solution for about 15 minutes.  Also, it is important to use deveined liver to help with the tenderness.  I carmelized the onions first with only about a half tsp sugar, salt, and pepper for about 10 minutes. Near the end of the liver cooking time, I added a little water to help deglaze the pan and tenderize the liver more.  Again, I loved the simplicity of the recipe as well as the flavor. Thanks for sharing.

I added some vegetable oil along with the butter,  and it wasn't as greasy as it may sound. i liked the texture of the meat coated w/the flour, wasn't sure about the sugar but used it and it had a great taste. the meat was so moist, will always make my liver & onions this way.

I also simmer the liver in some beef broth; really makes it tender. With mashed potatoes is usually the way it is served in restaurants and the broth makes a good gravy. Also good now that the sweet Texas 1015 onions are in season! And by reading all of the review, and see that will work for others, and than for me, to make it more flavorful or lot better for me to do! Anyway, excellent to do a SCRATCH on recipes. The more I play with my food, the more I love cooking, to make a recipe that will work for me, that is!! Than I can do the happy food dance!! I've will added this to my recipe book with my additions. THANK YOU!!

Perfect! It has been years since I made live and onions. My husband made some for me a while back and it was not very good. I found this recipe last week and used it as directed. The liver turned out exactly as it it should! Thank you for this submission. This will become a permanent recipe in my catalog.

I learned after this last night and enjoying it for dinner that the rave reviews are well deserved! This is truly delicious. Neither my husband nor I have been big fans of liver in the past, but this has made a true believer of me. I loved the carmelized onions. I made this recipe just as originally printed with one exception: I used stevia in place of sugar (with great results!). Next time, just for good health's sake, I think I'll try using olive oil instead of butter and oat flour instead of wheat. I will now make this on a regular basis.

This was the best Liver and Onions that I've ever had, and it was my first time cooking it at home.  We've always went out and had this meal.  But it's now a stay at home meal that I'll fix all the time.

This is how I've always cooked liver. The key is to not overcook it! It should still be nice and tender, not dried out.

Easy and very tasty. I will probably cut back on the sugar the next time. It doesn't really need it, the onions will sweeten as they caramalize.

Being home by myself I wanted to cook liver & onions - - this recipe was FANTASTIC!  Having cooked liver before I was looking for a great recipe.  I cut the quantities for just me and I was really impressed.  Loved the bacon added to the caramelized onions.   5 star!

Wow! I had a taste for liver and onions and thought I'd come here for a recipe. Glad I did! I rarely follow a recipe as written but this time I did. The only thing I did differently was to season the flour with salt and pepper. This was wonderful! I could have eaten all of the carmelized onion right from the pan. Delicious! Thank you for sharing.

fantastic recipe! my liver came already deskinned from the walmart freezer section; it was also very thin... I added the extra 3/4 cup water and set the liver on top of the onions. The flavor rose up, and it came out wonderfully. A+

This recipe was VERY good.  Only small tweaks were made to my liking.  Since I like onions I sliced rather than diced them.  I also salt and peppered the liver before cooking it.  Lastly I added water while the liver was cooking and that thickened to gravy.  This will be my liver recipe from now on.

I rated this a four star just because I dislike liver. I made this for my boyfriend for his birthday, and he really liked it. I tried a piece with onion and thought i could eat it, but then I tried a piece by itself and no, I could not eat it. But he really liked it and said it was perfect. I didn't change anything.

I've never been a big fan of liver, but this was amazing! I soaked the liver in milk for about 2 hours and added the salt and pepper along with a teaspoon of garlic powder right to the flour. Thank You

Thought the recipe was awesome. The only thing that is you should do the onions afterwards not before then pour on top of the liver. Do it before the onions get too hard. Other than that little tid bit it was great.

I love Liver & Onions and this recipe is the way I love it.  I did omit the sugar - I cooked the onions with medium heat and a lid on for about 30 minutes stirring several times. Kept the onions warm cooked the liver for about 5 minutes each side - just enough to cook it through but no more.

MMMMMMM so yummy! I added garlic powder for extra flavor and soaked liver 3 hours before cooking in milk. Turned out very tender-the sweet onions smothered on top were incredible. Didn't have to do dishes...everyone licked their plates clean:)

This is a really good recipe, although kids still won't eat it. I've tried soaking it in milk which makes it taste even better but kids still won't eat it. I do though thanks 4 the recipe.

I don't usually "rate" recipes but this one was so yummy! and easy to prepare.  I'm not a big liver fan but need to increase my blood iron count to donate blood and the caramelized onions definitely make it more palatable.  The second time I made this I added a little cinnamon to the onions.  Very nice. I also cubed the liver for bite size crunchy pieces.

Very good!  My only change was to use brown sugar rather than white.  It adds to the caramelized flavor of the onions, and a nice color too. Yummy!

To be honest, I am giving this recipe 5 stars because my husband said it was the best liver and onions he ever had.  It was very easy to make.  I bought the liver frozen and pre-sliced.  I never liked liver as a child, but attempted to try this excited about the reviews.  My husband loved it!  Some of us just don't care for liver.  Will make it again for my husband whenever he asks.

Liver and onions is one of our favorites---rich in iron and full of flavor.  When people rail against liver (eeewww) it's because it is the stronger version -- i.e., beef liver as opposed to calves liver.  I grew up with it, I fixed this recipe as a departure from what I always fixed, it was fabulous.  And I am now going to add to my menu of appetizers and look for veal liver pate to join my chicken liver spread.  It is just so healthy and rich and flavorful and easy to digest.  Try it.  You will rejoice.

I have of yet to find a liver and onions recipe that is anywhere as good as my Mother’s recipe.  Or as  appetizing.  She makes it by slicing the calf liver into strips after she soaks it in milk for 20 minutes.   Then she sauté the onions adds the sliced liver and cooks it until the liver is cooked through add a couple of tablespoons of flour, salt and marjoram.  Cooks that for about a minute so use Lois the raw flour taste and adds warm water to make a lovely gravy.  Yummy yummy yum!!!

I made this to what I thought was the recipe but after I was all done and let it simmer I realized I forgot the sugar!  It was still good but lacked flavor for my tastebuds. I also like a little more sauce to go over top of my liver and onions. I’d make this again to add the sugar next time and add some water and let it simmer for a few minutes to thicken up. I’d also add more garlic and onion powder along with some course ground pepper. Maybe some hot sauce on my plate too. Thanks for the recipe and I was bummed I forgot the sugar. Next time tho.

Came out perfect. I put the liver slices in milk for about half an hour I added half a tablespoon of garlic powder, 1 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp ground black pepper to the flour mix (for 250g liver), used veggie oil instead of butter.

Fried Applewood smoked bacon after the onions and added 2 tablespoons of rice wine vinegar to deglaze the pan after frying the liver. 
Best calf liver dinner ever made!

I haven't eaten liver for literally decades because my mother always used to overcook it and it would be dry.  I wanted to try it again because it was recommended for my weight loss program.....nutrient dense and high in protein.  I followed the recipe except I didn't use any flour for dredging as I am intolerant to gluten.  I just sautéed the slices of liver and caramelized the onions until they were almost crispy and it was delicious!  Next time I'm going to try soaking it in milk as others have suggested.  Otherwise I think liver is going to be part of my regular diet again!

Made it for the other 1/2 as I am not a fan, added some cooked bacon with the onions I had and he said it was delicious. I did cook it longer than the 2mins a side.

Excellent recipe.  I followed other reviewers and soaked in milk (cashew), patted dry, and added seasoning to the flour.  The cooking time is spot on, and the onions were delicious.  This will get me back into the liver!  With later versions I will try making the gravy others have made, and the bacon bits.

This is a great recipe and very easy to make. I did a couple of tweaks. Before cooking the liver I fried a batch of bacon till crisp then used the bacon fat to fry the liver in. I also sauteed four sweet onions so I could have the smothering effect. One thing...if your using sweet onions be to very sparing with the sugar. I used 2 tsps of sugar and it was almost too much. Once the liver was cooked I made a gravy with the remaining bacon fat and added the onions to it. I crumpled the bacon over the top and served....Delicious!  Two things to keep in mind that has been mentioned in other posts is the importance of not over cooking the liver as well as soaking it in milk (i soaked mine over night because I wasn't ready to cook it right away). The result was a mild and very tender liver and onions dinner.

I just had to review this recipe! It is my first  Allrecipes review  although I have been a member for many years.  DH and I have always loved liver and onions but seldom cooked it at home.  Several bad restaurant experiences over the past few years meant we did not eat it often.  We will do  so now, using this recipe as a guide.  Only change:  I carmelized 4 yellow onions using the same 2 tsp of sugar per recipe, sliced (not diced) for 1/2 pound of Skylark brand calves liver.  Leftovers were excellent reheated for lunch the next day.  Served accompanied with mashed potatoes with butter, French cut green beans, and carrots cooked in orange soda.  Forgot to take a picture but our plates were colorful and visually appealing.

After growing up eating over cooked liver, when I learned this recipe while living in Colorado, I was sold.  Not only did I convert my family to the dish, but it was the first meal I served my husband 40 years ago.  The only thing I do different, to be really sinful, I use both bacon fat and butter, and I top each slice with a strip of bacon and melt some shredded sharp cheddar on top.  Obviously, in the interests of heart health, I don't serve that dish too often, but my husband still asks for it.

Made recipe as written with following changes. I soaked the liver in milk for a couple hours (overnight would even be better) and drained the milk off thoroughly.  Seasoned the liver liberally with Tony Chachere's Creole seasoning before dredging in flour.  Otherwise went right by the recipe.  Best liver and onions I've ever eaten.

I'm normally not a fan of liver.  My husband bought it to increase my iron levels.  I saw this recipe and gave it a shot and now LOVE liver!  My kids have always hated it but after all 3 tried it, 2 of them like it now as well.  One even ate most of my dinner!  Delicious simple recipe.  Something about cutting it in thin slices really made it wonderful too.  Will be making this often :)

This was a great recipe. I did switch up on some things. First I soaked the liver in milk, suffering from anemia as a child my mom taught me this.  Once soaked I dredged it in Italian Bread Crumbs and seasoned it with salt and pepper.  I sauteed the onions in the Italian Butter, which is basically butter, garlic and herbs with some Romano cheese, added the sugar and a little EVOO.  My husband loved this. Will make again and soon. Had not had liver since I was young because I was force fed it so much by my mom.  Who would have thought that 30 years later I'd be saying - YUM, YUM more liver please!

Was a good recipe, but I won't add sugar to the onions next time (too sweet)

This recipe is fantastic but with one slight alteration (substitute garlic salt for the salt!)will make a fantastic change to your taste buds!  Another change is to deglaze the pan with sherry... and then pour all over your liver. Try it!!!   YUM!!!

I got tired of paying overpriced diner joints to make this for me, so I did it myself. This is sooo easy to do... and so good- second only to Mom's.  ;-)

I can't believe how tender and delicious this is. It was so easy and my family raved about it.
I will cut the sugar in half next time as caramelized onions are fairly sweet.

I rinsed the liver and soaked it in milk for a couple of hours before dredging in flour and cooking.  I also mixed Lawry's seasoning to the flour instead of salt and pepper.

LOVE liver and onions!  This is a great basic recipe.  Lola is so right, do not overcook!  That is when it gets tough and chewy which is what turns people off.   I would eat it once a week if I could get decent calves liver.

Obviously you don't want to  mess  with it too much, but i tossed garlic, a bit of red wine, a bit of mustard and some salt and pepper into the sauce with the onions. Turned out very nicely, but it would have been better if I'd been more patient with the caramelizing onions...that's on me hahaha

Soaked the liver in milk for about an hour but otherwise made as written. Don't make liver and onions very often but always a nice change. This basic recipe keeps it simple and makes liver and onions as good as any other method I've tried.

All I can say is my, my, my! I haven't had liver in years! I was nervous that it wouldn't be cooked all the way. It is! It is so tender! And the caramelized onions are the icing on the cake! Delicious! I will be making this again!

This is an excellent recipe. Liver and onions does not have to be a complex recipe and shouldn't be! This one is basic but excellent! I do agree with soaking the liver in milk for an hour or more to remove the bitterness. This recipe in my opinion was almost exactly how my mother did it!

Great recipe.  I soaked the liver in almond milk while the onions caramelized; result was very mild flavored liver.

Great and simple recipe, I'll definitely be using it again. 
Just a note, since "all stoves cook differently", I cooked mine for about 2 minutes (or a little over) per side and it still came out perfectly. I also used kymbrown's suggestion of garlic powder, black pepper, and salt in the flour.
Thanks, Lola (and Kym)!

I made this for supper tonight and loved it.  I did soak my liver in worcestershire sauce for an hour and I omitted the sugar.  I also used rice flour instead of wheat.  This was super easy to make and came out delicious.

TRY RECIPE WITH 1/2 CUP OF CROWN ROYALE MAPLE OR GRAND MARNIER!! This recipe was soooo good I became a member here! OK round these parts when somebody makes a perfectly delicious meal they would tell the cook "you put yo foot in that"! Well the cook who put this recipe together should be nicknamed "FOOTLOOSE"!

I grew up loving liver and onions. I made a few changes by adding a pound of bacon and adding a more onions to it with a little more sugar. My girl friend came home witch hates liver and asked what smelled so good, I said taste this. SHE LOVED IT! I then told her what it was and she ate two helpings and she is a small lady. GREAT DISH!!

I didn't really like this recipe much. I won't make this again. My oldest son who eats liver the way I cook it said, "YUK" when he tried it.
