I love the flavors of this burger, it is so gourmet tasting! The only changes I made were instead of mixing ketchup in with the meat etc. I mixed 2 tbsp. of whole cranberry cranberry sauce and I used breadcrumbs instead of a slice of bread. The results were excellent. I also topped the burger with some cranberry sauce and a few slices of brie. FANTASTIC!

Amazing!  I did make a few changes though.  I added breadcrumbs when I realized the piece of bread was not allowing the meat to clump together.  I also added more cranberries and cheese.  I would highly recommend going light with the rosemary as it is a very strong herb.  My burgers were overpowered with rosemary (which my husband loved, me not so much) but the turkey burger was still delicious.  Next time around I will go light on the rosemary.

The best Turkey burger I've ever had.    Made exactly per the recipe with ONE change.    Since some of the other reviewers had used cranberry sauce instead of ketchup, I thought I'd kick it up with 2 T of cranberry horseradish sauce instead of either ketchup or cranberry sauce.   5 stars!

I made a major substitute by using goat cheese instead of the brie, which I'm not a huge fan of, and since I love goat cheese these were very, very good.  I did happen to leave out the ketchup by mistake, and I'm not sure if that was the reason I found the burgers to be a bit bland.  As another reviewer mentioned, I thought the rosemary flavor was a bit strong (and I love rosemary!) so next time I think I'll use a combination of rosemary, thyme and some rubbed sage.  Still, the cranberries and cheese (whichever kind you end up using) make fabulous additions to a turkey burger.

I also omitted the ketchup, and subbed 2 TBSP whole cranberry sauce. I subbed bread crumbs for the bread, and popped the patties in the freezer for a few minutes before cooking them up on the griddle. A great recipe, thanks!

This recipe is amazing, though I did make a few changes based on other comments.   I used 3/4 cup of bread crumbs instead of bread. 1/2 cup of dried cranberries that were soaked in hot water. 2 tbsp of mustard instead of ketchup since no one seemed to like it. Mustard did add extra flavor. We dont like Rosemary so I added 1 teaspoon of honey which was amazing!  Also, make sure you serve this with a pineapple salsa--it makes all the difference. If you need a quick recipe, 1 cup pineapple, 1 cup papaya, 1 1/2 cup of your favorite tomato salsa.  Next time I make this I will brown the onions and increase the cranberries even more.

These were DELICIOUS!!!  I made a raspberry dijon to 'dress them' by mixing some melted raspberry preserves with whole grain dijon mustard, and they were fantastic.  I'd love to make these for company, and next time I'll use my grill pan to cook them.  YUM!

These were really good.  The kids gobbled them up!  I subbed in mozza, as it was on hand and used gluten free bread as we have a celiac in the house.  I also grilled them on the BBQ.  I would add a few more cranberries next time as they were a bit lost in the other flavours.

Fixed as written, but couldn't really taste the Brie. We cooked them on the grill, but the cheese did not ooze out and they stayed together very well. Next time I will put the Brie in the middle for a stuffed burger. Otherwise, the favors were great. The cranberries made it taste kind of like thanksgiving turkey!

This recipe was simple and delicious!  I substituted 1/3 cup breadcrumbs and left out the rosemary, but other than that, stuck exactly to the recipe.  My husband told me the next morning that he wished he wanted them for dinner again that night.  Good news for him....the recipe made 5 big burgers and we're having leftovers tonight. :-)

Lots of nice flavors packed into one little burger -- and it works!  Don't be afraid of the ingredient quantities as listed. The only change I made was to use seasoned bread crumbs rather than the slice of bread softened in water. We cooked them on the gas grill.  No bun needed. Next time I might figure out some kind of salsa or chutney to serve as a condiment.  Thanks for a great new way to perk up turkey!

These were good- I added more cheese then the recipe called for. It still needed more, and more cran. I added 1/2 a cup of bread crumbs to the recipe because I seemed too moist. Even with the added texture I had trouble trowing them on the grill. The turned out good once I got them to work.

This was pretty tasty. I added garlic. I bought my turkey from the local shop and the grind was too fine, it made the burger too soft. I think I'll put some beef or pork in it next time. I'll also add more cranberries, because I love them and I added one sprig of rosemary and will add a touch more last time. I think this recipe is 3 stars cause o f my meat, but I gave 4 because it wasn't the recipes fault.

These are fantastic! I only swapped bread crumbs for bread because that's what I prefer and we grilled them. I grated the onion as i think the flavor becomes more incorporated. They reheat well. The combination of flavors is thoroughly enjoyable. I highly recommend!

Great recipe, but used 3/4 cup bread crumbs and 2 Tbs cranberry sauce in place of the white bread and ketchup. Top with slices of brie and more cranberry sauce. Reminds me of Thanksgiving!

Also prepared a version of this recipe as small turkey loaves:
I substituted 1 cup quick oats in place of the bread, 3 Tbs cranberry sauce in place of the ketchup, and 1/2 large naked red onion in place of the medium regular red onion. I also added 1 egg. I mixed all the ingredients minus the Brie until uniform, then added the brie, mixed briefly, formed fist-sized loaves, and placed them on a baking sheet pan. I cooked them at 350 F until 170 F in the centers. When I pulled them out, I placed a thick slice of Brie on top and served it on grilled ciabatta with a bit of cranberry sauce. Perfect!

Delicious and different. Made these changes: used 12 grain bread instead of white, made 4 burgers per pound instead of 6, and grilled them instead of broiling. My family really liked them. Served with "A Twist on Pasta Salad" from this site and sauteed zucchini and yellow squash with sour cream for a delicious summer meal. Served on whole wheat buns. Thanks!

Thanksgiving is my favorite meal so I'm always on the lookout for recipes that bring out the flavors of turkey and cranberries. This recipe is just what I need to get my thanksgiving fix any time of year. The only swap I made was I used goat cheese with cranberries in place of the brie. Instead of making them under the broiler I used my Geo. Forman. They were done in less than 5 min. (using my meat thermometer as my gauge for temp.) I will definitely make these throughout the year.

This was the best burger I've ever had.. just add more Brie. Definitely not enough cheese in the recipe. Also, a thin layer of mayonnaise makes it perfect.

Delicious!  I made these into meatballs and served with pasta.  The brie became the gooey stickiness to hold it all together.  Was perfect for a cold winter dinner.   Definitely going to experiment with this recipe some more.

I have made this several times and my family just loves it. The Brie adds a creaminess, and the Rosemary compliments the cranberries. Delicious!

We felt this needed more spice.  I used panko breadcrumbs instead of a torn slice of bread but that was the only substitution.  If I made these again, I'd add some worcestershire sauce maybe some more garlic

This was a very nice recipe, pleasant change from normal turkey burgers. I took the advice of others and used 1/3 cup seasoned bread crumbs, used cranberry sauce in place of ketchup. And served them with cranberry mayo. Delish!!
