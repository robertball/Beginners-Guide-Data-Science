Don't even think about making a shortbread recipe with white sugar! You'll be missing out on too much! This recipe is so easy, and so amazingly flavorful, I highly doubt you'll bother ever making another recipe again. This recipe is very flexible. Here is how I make it, and the kind of variations it can handle. I will use regular flour, whole wheat flour, organic flours, etc. They all work great. The butter needs to be SOFTENED, not MELTED. keep this in mind, please! If you need to soften butter in a hurry, cut the cubes into 5 pats apiece. Arrange them in a ring on a dinner plate, (none in the middle!) and place them in the microwave. If you have power percentage control, put it on 10% and give it 30 seconds or so. Repeat, testing until it is perfect. Dont leave the microwave. Yes, it'll take a few minutes, but it's better than finding a time machine so you can leave the butter out to soften this morning. If you don't have percentage control, cook the pats on high power for 4 or 5 seconds at a time, waiting about 20 seconds inbetween heatings. This is very important, so you don't end up with melted butter. Cream with the brown sugar, then add the cups of flour (I just use 4, I find it makes the cookies nice and tender!) and mix well. I don't knead the dough, I don't roll it out. I grab golf-ball size balls, place them on the sheet, and put a thumb-print in the middle. that's it! Cook them for the suggested time, no more, and you'll have fantastic melt-in-your-mouth shortbrea

This recipe really wasn't very nice.  Yes it was simple to make and the ingredients were all easily at hand-  but the result was a very bland biscuit.

After reading the other reviews, I had thought that this recipe would yield a better result.  But this biscuit lacks both flavour and the texture of a true shortbread;  and it leaves a dry feeling in ones mouth after eating.

I believe that it is misleading to name this biscuit a shortbread-  it definitely lacks the true characteristics of a melt in the mouth, buttery shortbread.  This is not a dreadful biscuit, but it is not tasty or exceptional.  Defintely not a treat you'd serve to guests.

I have tried many, many shortbread recipes for the past 41 years in my quest for the "perfect" shortbread - and this is it.  I didnt' roll it out but made it into bars - I used 1-8x8" cake pan and one pie plate so they'd be nice and thick.  It's even husband approved!!!  And he's a very tough cookie to please.  Thank you so much!!!  Now, I just have to find a butterscotch pie like my mother-in-law used to make and I'm done.

I found this recipe too heavy & floury as written. BUT when I started with cold butter cut it up into pats. Mixed it & the sugar on high until it became fluffy (5 mins on high). AND if I used 4 C flour exactly and no kneading, & chilled the dough prior to shaping, the texture and flavor improved a great deal. It changed it from very heavy & doughy tasting to light & buttery & crumbly.

WOWOWOWOW!!! I resisted the VERY strong urge to tinker with the recipe and I am so glad that I did. First of all I softened the butter, then creamed the sugar and butter together. Then, I used 4 cups of flour, which I added a little bit at a time. I then used my cookie scooper and placed the balls on a cookie sheet lined with Release. I then sprinkled the tops with granulated sugar and then pressed the bottom of a glass down on the cookies. These did not expand much at all so you can really load your cookie sheet up. These turned out delicious (and pretty)! Thanks for the post!

WOW!..a moment of silence please..1.So you can hear the sound from my expanding thighs :) 2.For the absolute perfection of this cookie! My quest is over for the best shortbread cookie recipe, Thank You Linda! I will never by the famous shortbread cookies from the stores again! I just finished making a batch of these and the only changes I made were to add a tablespoon of vanilla, a pinch of salt and used the dough hook on my stand mixture to "knead" the dough. I also used powdered sugar instead of flour to roll the dough out. I sprinkled the tops of the cookies with sparkling white sugar (press into the dough) & then pricked with a large salad fork. If you love shortbread this is definately the cookie to make, it will now remain in my recipe file for years to come!

How can 3 simple ingredients send one to heaven?  That's the bliss of this shortbread.  No need to make cookies, tho.
I pat it into a 9x9 or 13x9 (for thin cookies) pan and prick with a fork.  
Dust with powdered sugar when still warm, and they melt in your mouth even better than granulated sugar.  Don't forget the vanilla (bourbon ONLY) and 1/2 tsp salt. The salt lifts the sweetness.  These last about 15 minutes in my house.

Authentic shortbread taste. Sooo much better than what you find in stores. I made mine entirely by hand (no mixers here), and didn't have a rolling pin or anything, so I let the dough sit in the fridge for about 15 minutes, then rolled it into balls, flattened them with my palm, and did the fork punches. Cooked them for about 18 minutes and the outcome? Super tasty. If a college guy like me can do it, anyone can. Inexpensive and easy recipe. I highly recommend it!

This shortbread is very yummy!  But, beware of baking time.  Mine were done well before the bake time in the recipe.

I am new to cooking, but love this website.  I find it so helpful to read the reviews as I am able to get the best out of a recipe.  On this recipe I used 3 & 3/4 cup of flour.  Next time I would increase that amount because while the taste of the shortbread was absolutely fabulous, the shortbread did spread. Also, when I kneaded the dough, I used 1/2 flour and 1/2 confectioners sugar on the board.  This gives it a much sweeter taste.  I took it to a party tonight, and it was a BIG hit.  I even got asked for the recipe.  Not a single piece left, but thank goodness I kept 3 pieces at home to have with my tea.  Also, I cooked it in 2 batches.  The first batch turned out perfect at 25 minutes.  The second batch was a little overdone at 25 minutes.  I realize I would rather have them underdone than over done.  Brown does not work on shortbread for all you novices out there like me.  Cheers.

I'm Scottish and would just like to add that if you reduce the flour by half a cup and add half a cup of rice flour, it really improves the texture.  It gives it a slight crispy crunchy texture that I like.

This is the real deal! My grandmother hailed from Glasgow, and she would have been proud. These have the perfect sablé texture. Not crumbly, soft, but with a hint of gentle crunch, with a light, tender, delicate crumb. Everything shortbread should be. Just the right degree of sweetness. I made the dough by pulsing the 3 ingredients (used 4 cups flour) in my new 14-cup Cuisinart, which made easy, fast work of it. They came out perfect in 21 minutes. The edges were just starting to turn a barely light brown, thank heaven! My mom's recipe that I grew up with had less sugar (always brown) and more flour. The dough was always very crumbly and hard to work with. This dough is a dream. My mom's recipe was handed down from my grandmother, direct from Scotland, and this one is actually better. If you have no rolling pin, you can either use a wine bottle, or just pat it to 1/2" thick. Cutting can be accomplished quickly with a pizza cutter. Don't forget to prick the dough with a fork, or the cookies will swell and blister in the oven. Walker's, move over! These are much better than those big bucks numbers in the fancy tin!  Makes me want to crack out the haggis and single malt! UPDATE: I substituted 3/4 cup rice flour for 3/4 cup of the flour. The difference was subtle, but lent just a bit more "crisp" without compromising the tenderness. Will do this in the future everytime I make this.

Others suggested adding a little extra salt in the recipe to bring out the shortbread flavor and I concur.  I made these using all brown sugar and that's where the delicious taste lies.  Also tried a half white sugar, half brown sugar and they weren't as tasty I think.  I made some for my mom and she was in heaven -- was delighted to have such a simple recipe.  She makes them all the time now.  I make the dough then chill it in a squarish "log" shape wrapped in plastic.  Then when chilled, I slice and bake them on parchment.  Much easier for me than rolling them out.  Plus I can make several batches at once and slice and bake as needed.  This dough freezes well.

Every year at the holidays I go and get the large box of Walkers Shortbread, sometimes two.  I have been searching for a receipe that would duplicate that taste.  This is the receipe.  Even my daughter who is 5 said "these taste like those cookies you buy and hide from us"  They were great , I made them just as the receipe states, and then I wrapped them in a piece of Saran Wrap in a long block style and put in frig for a hour, then cut them no problem and baked for 21 minutes.  Very good thank you!

I added 1/2 t salt, but really, the recipe's a 5-star without it. Love the simplicity of shortbread and this recipe's directions. My advice? Follow it. Don't get caught up in all the shortbread "hints and tips" you'll read on the 'net and in cookbooks. Just know your oven and prepare to take the cookies out up to 5 minutes earlier than the recommended bake time, if the edges start to tan and the cookies look done. Ha! Well I guess that's one "hint and tip," huh? Enjoy!

This is the same recipe my grandmother made, and I have made it for years.  It is the best shortbread I have ever tasted.  You can't take shortcuts, though.  Use butter, not margerine.  Don't melt the butter, allow it to soften and cream it well.  Mix in the last of the flour by hand.  You can tell there is enough flour when you make a ball in your hand and flatten it - the dough just begins to crack on the edge.  Even now, I don't always get the right amount of flour - if you use too much, it will taste floury.  If you use too little, the cookies will spread and be too crispy. Make sure to use the lower oven temperature and don't overbake.  (I actually bake at 300).

These are so simple and delicious! I halved the recipe and got 32 1" x 2" cookies. The brown sugar is definitely what was lacking in all of the other recipes I've tried. Bravo, Linda!

This recipe is wonderful! A big hit with friends, family and coworkers alike. Use all light brown sugar for a more savory cookie, and 1/2 dark 1/2 light for a perfect sweet shortbread. I roll the dough into logs 1" in diameter and cut slices 1/2" thick for an elegant round cookie. Thank you for this easy and delicious recipe!!

Not what I expected at all. The brown sugar shoud've clued me in, but I was looking for a classic tasting Scottish shortbread recipe. The brown sugar changed the taste of it. It hardly tasted like Scottish shortbread at all.

I made a double batch of these for Christmas presents.  First time I ever made shortbread!  I used 1/2 salted 1/2 unsalted butter, softened. What I did after incorporating the rest of the flour was to cut it in half and work with half at a time.  I didn't know what a "soft dough" was but ended up taking about to play dough consistency.   To roll it out, I found it kind of "flaked" when I rolled it, so instead of rolling it all the way, I basically got it to size and shape I wanted, patting it down with my hands to make it thinner.  Then I ran the roller over it to smooth it out.  I used a clean metal ruler to measure.  I used a pizza cutter but the cutting was pretty finicky.  At the end I took out a flower shape cutter and used that, it made really cute shapes.  I wish I would have done that for at least 1/2.  I cooked them for about 4 minutes longer, as the first batch came out a little undercooked. It's hard to tell but just until it's barely barely toasted looking around the edges and I cooled on the pan. I wasn't impressed with the flavor and texture at first but it was much better after a night in the fridge.  Thank you for this recipe!

These always get great reviews from the people I make it for. However, I have one IMPORTANT suggestion to everyone - add about 1/4-1/2 tsp. of salt to the recipe. Salt is essential in bringing out flavor, not just in this recipe, but every recipe. It doesn't make it taste salty, it just makes it possible to taste the butter and sugary goodness. Good luck!

Very good recipe.  I made a few modifications based upon the reviews.  * Added 2 Tsp of Almond Extract to the butter/sugar mixture  * Blended cold butter and sugar until fluffy, and mixed all flour in.  I did not knead, and I refrigerated all dough before rolling and cutting into cookies  * I cooked in a 300 degree oven for approx 25 min (start checking at 25 min)

WOW!!  I made mine into sandwich cookies with apricot preserves and seedless raspberry jam.  They taste just like the fruit galettes from Harry and David.  The secret is definitely in the brown sugar.  Thanks!!

Great!  Drizzled them with white and dark chocolate, and they looked awesome!  I added vanilla to it to add flavor too!

Absolutely fabulous. I loved them. My daughter and I made them together and it was really fun. I drank mine with a big cup of English tea. They were really great from the raw dough to the fully cooked. We would absolutely make them again.

Good recipe! Lovely, except, you do not dip scottish shortbread in chocolate!!!!!!!!! I would know, I'm from scottland, and good shortbread shouldn't need that. Trust me, just dust with sugar and stick to the recipe.

I've tried several shortbread recipes, and this is my favorite!  I'm now sold on brown sugar as the way to sweeten shortbread.  One variation I made:  I rolled and cut out small (quarter-size) rounds, placed a dollop of melted semi-sweet chocolate on the back of half of them, and then placed another on top to make little bite-size sandwich cookies.  I dusted them with powdered sugar, and they were an elegant and tasty addition to a fancy tray at Christmas.  Thanks for the recipe!

I was very impressed with how simple this recipe was, and it produced AWESOME cookies!  I made them for my husband for Christmas, and I will be making them again next year!  One note, make sure you have plenty of flour, I ended up using the whole 4 1/2 C, plus maybe a bit more for dusting.  All in all, these are GREAT!

Excellent recipe.  The only thing I did different: I did rolled the shortbread into little balls and used my thumb to flatten them somewhat.  Then I sprinkled a little superfine white sugar on the tops of half of them.  I couldn't stop eating them!  My mother brought some to her job and her co-workers devoured them within the hour.

The brown sugar sounded interesting but it totally ruins the biscuit. I would say that many of the people rating this have never tried real shortbread if they think this turns out anything like what a shortbread should be. Neither the flavour nor texture is right for shortbread. It is dry and hard unlike the the melt in the mouth, buttery shortbread characteristic a shortbread should have. I'd suggest giving this a pass.

We added more vanilla to make the cookies just a tad sweeter. They came out so buttery and delicious! Also, we used cookie cutters to make the shapes more uniform. Thanks for a terrific recipe. My hubby LOVES them!

I grew up with this recipe, these are the only shortbread cookies I have ever known and the only ones I will ever make, i roll mine out and cut Christmas shapes or just circles, I add colored sugar to the tops (usually green and red as I only make them at Christmaas) I am glad to see there are others out there who enjoy as I have for 30 something yers:0)

Simple recipe with complex taste, my kind of baking!  I doubled the reciple and it fit perfectly into two large jelly-roll pans with a slight lip.  I was also able to smooth the top with my rolling pin once in the pans for a neat, more professional appearance.  Then, taking a regular dining fork, I pricked the dough into 4 X 6 rows.  Because our last name has the initials VZ, instead of pricking random holes in the dough, I 'monogrammed' each cookie with the letters VZ, very simple to do cause let's face it, an 'S' would have posed a problem, the VZ was simple to make, being just straight lines. Anyway, when they came out of the oven (at 25 minutes), I quickly cut them along the perforated holes that represented the boundaries of each individual cookies (with a very sharp knife), then let them cool a while on the baking sheet, later transferred them to a cooling rack, later, when completely cool put inside a cookie tin.  My relatives were delighted and impressed to be served monogrammed shortbread, and I felt like a genius, what a happy coincidence!  I also added to the doubled recipe 2 tsps. almond extract and 2 tsps. vanilla extract, they were perfection.  Melt in your mouth, very European taste.  No embellishments needed, I think that would mar the simple elegance of this particular biscuit.

These cookies are a nice take on regular shortbread, but my family missed the taste of icing sugar in the traditional recipe. However, they dissappeared from the table pretty quickly, and they do have a rich, buttery flavor. I would recommend rolling them to a 1/4" thickness instead of 1/2". They seemed too thick and the ones I made thinner cooked better and had a nice crunch to them.

This is simple and great.  I separated it into two balls and flavored one with orange flavoring and the other with almond.  I dipped both in chocolate and put some grated orange peel on one and a single almond on the other.  I took it to a food day at work and had raves and at least a dozen requests for the recipe.  This is the simplest recipe I have ever used for a food day and the most requests for a recipe.

So easy and the best simple recipe.  I made these cookies and used a heart shaped cookie cutter and iced them with pink colored royal icing and used them as wedding reception favors.  Everyone LOVED them!    It's not so easy if you have a hand mixer.  Try to use a stand mixer.  It will save your wrist!  Don't melt the butter, sit it out and let it soften.    After the dough is mixed I covered my cutting board with a sprinkle of flour and placed parchment paper over the dough and rolled the dough out to 1/2 inch thickness and used a cookie cutter.    I baked the cookies for 23 minutes, don't wait til it's too golden brown or they will be over done.    Let the cookies cool and decorate with royal icing.  Royal icing:  3 egg whites to 5 cups of confectioners (powedered) sugar and 1 tablespoon of vanilla or almond extract.  Beat egg whites until foamy and add extract. While beating, add sugar.  Beat until you reach desired thickness.  If it's too thick add a little water (tablespoon at a time) if it's too thin, add more confectioners (powdered) sugar.    The cookies are sooo easy to make and such a delicious taste.  Don't subsitute with white sugar because white sugar doesn't taste half as good.  Use brown sugar only.  Light or Dark is fine.  Shortbread is much more tastier than sugar cookies for decorating!

OMG...I CURSE THE DAY THAT I FOUND THIS RECIPE...BECAUSE IT'S THAAATTTT GOOD!  :)  I was skeptical to try it bc I am a shortbread junkie and I really don't want to gain the weight...but I can't help it.  I ate the entire batch.  It's delicious!  It tastes just like the shortbread from the store.  Next time, I will add a bit more flour though to make it harder.

I made a half batch of this recipe using a pinch of salt and a teaspoon of vanilla just to try them out and they turned out really good. My family and guests devoured them immediately. For a holiday effect I rolled out the dough and cut out star shapes sprinkling granulated sugar on top of the rolled out dough before baking. 

Like someone else said, "They are so easy to make that you feel as though you are cheating."

I added 1 Tablespoon vanilla extract and 1/2 tsp. salt.
I creamed butter and sugar for 10 min. 
I used the dough hook and kneaded for 7 min.
I formed the dough into two separate rectangles wrapped in plastic wrap and chilled for 20 min., then sliced in 1/2" slices and placed on parchment lined cookie sheets. 25 min. was perfect
I dipped half the cookies in chocolate.
Excellent.

Ok, these cookies are amazing!! I made half-recipe, and they turned out perfect. The cookies look so beautiful, and they have that melt-in-your-mouth texture. The only thing I did differently was that I took the cookies out of the oven a few minutes earlier than 20 minutes because they were already done before that. Besides that, I kept everything else in this recipe the same. Bravo! Will definitely make again.

I really enjoyed this.  Light and flaky with a hint of brown sugar flavor.  I might add some finely chopped pecans next time, just for my own preference, or a either use dark brown sugar or a touch of molasses.  I kneaded this with the KitchenAid, switching from the paddle to the dough hook after the first addition of flour.  I only needed 4 cups of flour for this.  I'll make it again when I've got a spare POUND of butter handy!  Thanks for sharing!

I made this in my kitchen-aid, skipped the kneading.  Rolled and patted the dough directly on to a large baking sheet, scored with a pizza cutter, pricked with a fork, and baked. Separated into individual cookes after they've cooled some. If you didn't completely cut through the dough with the pizza cutter, you can do it while still hot when you take them out of the oven.I  cut them on the diagonal in a diamond shape so they wouldn't look like Club Crackers.  Heavenly flavor!

These cookies came out very bland with no flavor whatsoever.  Besides that, the dough was a huge mess to deal with.  I won't be making these again.

Wonderful recipe!  Super quick.  I've got a powerful mixer so I added all the flour and let it do the kneading.  Then I scooped out cookie balls and pressed them down with a flat bottomed glass dipped in white sugar.  Baked per directions.  Wonderful for tea time!!  Thanks~

These are the best shortbread I have ever made!  Similar to the taste of shortbread cookies from Big Island Candies in Hawaii.  For an extra treat I melted chocolate chips in a double boiler and dipped half the cookie into it, placed it on saran wrap and put it into the fridge to cool.  Once the chocolate has hardened they can be packaged and given away as gifts.

I have been looking for the perfect shortbread recipe, and I think this might be it!  I have never thought or heard of using brown sugar, but the results were perfect.  I quartered the recipe (1 stick butter, 1/4 cup brown sugar & 1 cup flour) as I did not want to have too many cookies.  I beat in my stand mixer rather than kneading and rolling out the dough.  Then I scooped and rolled about 2 teaspoons of dough into a ball, pushed down with fingers and cris-crossed with a fork and baked about 20 minutes.  This made a dozen nice sized cookies as good as any shortbread you can buy.  Next I might make a whole batch and dividing and add some chopped crystallized ginger, lemon zest and/or chocolate chips!

What I love about this recipe is how simple it is.. I didn't knead and used 4 cups of flour.  However, you can taste the brown sugar difference - which tastes great but is not the same as white sugar.  Also the color is just a bit off due to the brown sugar.. it's not the snowy white color of scottish shortbread.  Finally, if your cookie tastes like flour or spreads (loses its shape) - then you didn't use cold butter or you whipped it too long and warmed it up.  The colder the butter the more tender/crumbly the cookie result.

Yummy! Mine weren't the exact texture of real scottish shortbread, but it didn't matter because they were still really tasty. I followed the recipe almost exactly, but I did use flour AND confectioners sugar to roll out the dough, so the added sweetness was nice!

Such a simple recipe with an amazing flavor. The key is not to overwork or overcook. I also added chopped glazed pecans. My coworkers ate the entire batch within an hour.

I love this recipe--easy and delicious, with minimal cleanup--just a bowl, fork, and measuring cups!  These are fantastic baked exactly as is, or modified to become chocolate shortbread cookies (I melt 4 squares unsweetened chocolate in the microwave, let this cool, and then mix in with the butter before creaming butter and sugar.  Amazing!).  These have become my go-to study food.

Very tasty, heavy shortbread.  Bake for less time (no more than 20 min) and possibly at a lesser temp (I turned it down just a touch to 315 instead of 325 and baked for 20 min and they came out just right). I burned the first pan on 325 for 20 min and my oven bakes about right on if not a touch hot.  Very good, would go great with coffee. YUMMY!

Terrific recipe!  I totally suggest substituting 1/2 C of RICE FLOUR for 1/2 C of regular.  It makes a wonderful difference.  Also, for the lazy bakers (like me), no need to roll out dough.  Simply press into a jelly roll pan and cut into "strips or cookies"  (before baking) with a pizza cutter.  After baking go over cuts again with pizza cutter.  Turns out wonderful.

I have tried several recipes for things on this website. This is the first real winner I have found. I followed the recipe and added at total of 3 3/4 cups of flour. I added a 1/4 teaspoon of almond and 1/4 tsp of vanilla extract. Sprinked with sugar about 10 minutes into the baking. The cookies aren't too sweet or bland. True scottish shortbread isn't very sweet, so if you are looking for Lorna Doone, this isn't it. Only thing I did was cook it for about 30 minutes. I will see if they harden too fast. Tasted perfect right out of the oven and the whole house smelled like shortbread so I knew I was on the right track. A keeper recipe!

This is my "go to" shortbread recipe for the holidays. There isn't a crumb left whenever I bring a plate in to work. The brown sugar makes for a deep, rich flavor. I cut the amount of flour down to 4 cups. I use whatever real butter I have in the house - unsalted yields a more delicate flavor. I spray a 9x13" glass pan with non-stick baking spray. Then I prepare the dough as directed (using softened butter), pat it into the pan with my fingers, and prick the top with a fork (shortbread releases steam as it bakes). My tip: sprinkle the top with white sugar before baking (slightly caramelizes for a nice little crunch!). Then bake as directed. While still warm from the oven, I slice the shortbread into about 30 fingers with a very sharp knife. Then I place the pan on a wire rack and cool completely. Break up & store in an airtight container.

Needs a pinch of salt and 2 drops of vanilla.  I make these for my son ALL THE TIME!  He LOVES them with half all purpose flour and half almond flour.  YUMMMM!!  I also refrigerate my dough in a long block then cut into rectangles and bake on parchment paper.  (I have some in my oven right now .... If I think about it, I will take a pic and post it with this review)

UPDATE:  I make this recipe all the time now with my above changes, but now make them with half white and half brown sugar.   This dough freezes well in a block/log and easy to have on have when company drops by.

These cookies were perfect! We cut them into heart shapes and dipped half of the cookie into melted chocolate (and some sprinkles for Valentine's Day last year). Everyone loved them. Easy, looks pretty, tastes yummy.

I made these heavenly shortbread bars then dipped one end of each in melted dark chocolate, sprinkled with crushed Candy Canes on 1/2 batch and chopped hazelnuts on the other 1/2 batch.  I recently have moved to a small northern community and decided to give these along with my other Christmas cookies as neighbourly gifts... I am now the talk of the town!  One person even started to cry after only one bite.  Linda, you are my hero for sharing this great idea ;-)

For a real treat. Melt grillradille(sp) bittersweet choc chips with 1 tbl shortening. Dip the top of the cookie in the choc and top with chopped peacans. The balance of the flavors are out of this world and taste like a very expensive bought cookie. Great for christmas giving.  Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe is fairly authentic, but way too much butter - which meant it was too heavy and greasy.  I found an alternative British recipe with 8z butter, 4z sugar, 12z flour baked at 350F for 30mins which gave much better results.

These are my favorite short bread cookies.  I make them as directed, except that I shape them like regular cookies.  I usually end up using about 4 cups of flour unless I am rolling them out to make actual shapes, then I use a little more.  I bake them for about 20 minutes, though I have figured out "just" the color I like them and try to watch the last few minutes to be sure.  

These are so delicious with coffee or hot tea.

This is a fantastic recipe!  Very easy to make and SOOO delicious.  My kids LOVED them!  I altered the recipe only slightly: I used only 4C flour, added 1T vanilla, and a pinch of salt.  I wanted strips that were easy and uniform so I baked them in a rectanglular springform pan for 30-35 minutes (golden brown) and cut them with a very sharp knife after they cooled for 20 minutes.  Then I let them finish cooling on the pan. YUM!!!

Out of all the shortbread recipes on this site, this is my favorite and I will use it as my standard from now on! The key is the brown sugar (sometimes when I'm feeling rebellious I use DARK brown sugar). If you're so inclined and have a wicked streak like me, dip one half of each shortbread cookie in chocolate. I know, sinful. This really is easy and fun and a great one to make with kids.

Because I didn't have enough butter, almost half a kilo, I halved the recipe to see if the rave reviews were based on anything solid. I'm so glad I made this recipe! I actually used more flour then the recipe, only because the dough was to sticky to handle otherwise.  As many here have said I too popped it in the freezer for a short amount and made little balls I pushed flat. They were delicious and I will definitely make these again (and again and again... ) !!

Edit: I did make them again and I made them larger this time. I didn't like the structure in the finished larger cookies, therefore I've changed my star rating to three. 
So for small cookies, really good, for larger cookies, that's a no go (at least for me)

These are wonderful and so quick to make! I halved the recipe and needed only 2 cups of flour for my cookies. I used a small cookie scoop, instead of doing strips, and got 30 cookies. I added sprinkles to half the batter because my 5-year old doesn't think a cookie is a cookie if it doesn't have chocolate chips or sprinkles...preferably both! Will make again!

For some reason these did not turn out at all.  They bubbled and crisped in the oven instead of baking.  But the raw dough tasted good, so I ended up frezzing the dough in balls so I can use it as cookie dough in a cupcake recipe and in ice cream, all I have to do is add chocolate chips.

Make these cookies as stated.  Very easy and VERY good!  Must love the taste of butter to love these cookies!  Needless to say they were a hit in our house!

A perfect recipe!  Simplicity itself, these do require tender care when rolling as over rolling will make the resulting shortbread tough.  I shape it into a rectangle by hand to start with then a few passes of the rolling pin, I'm ready to cut them by hand and bake.  Shortbread is not supposed to be overly sweet and these are perfect with tea or coffee.  The brown sugar provides a depth of flavor that is divine!  Try these, make some tea, relax and enjoy!

Coming from Scotland I have been looking for a great shortbread recipe for some time.  This one is perfect.  I made it last night and most of it is gone.... I need to make a new batch tonight.  It is quick, easy, cooks up a treat.  Don't change a thing and thanks for the recipe.

This shortbread recipe is SO delicious and SO easy to make! Using only real butter results in a rich flavor, yet the amount of brown sugar is not overpowering with sweetness. I didn't alter the recipe one bit, and, they turned out wonderful! Thanks, Linda!

I decided to try these as they were in the Christmas Cookie Countdown. I used in my Swedish Spritz maker and I thought they turned out great. I used the disc which makes lined bars and baked as long strips. I sprinkled with holiday sparkled sugar and baked. As soon as I removed them from the oven, I cut into small rectangles and served with the Chocolate Chip Cheese Ball on this website (which was also yummy). I would make these again as I think they had a nice flavor, texture. Gosh, they also couldn't have been simpler to make! Thanks for this great recipe!

I used 1cup rice flour and 3cups all purpose in leached flour.  I added a tsp vanilla.  I rolled out the dough without a lot of kneading and cut simple shapes.  On some I sprinkled coarse brown sugar.  Next time I will add a half cup more brown sugar.

I tried a half recipe without other changes.  The cookies are tender, just buttery enough, just sweet enough.  The taste is delicate.  They look lovely.  I don't like a lot of crunch in a shortbread cookie and the texture of these is spot on.  I intend to use this recipe again.

Great Recipe as written but I got snowed in today and found that I didn't have quite enough flour/brown sugar so here is what I did. 2C salted butter, 1/2 c dark brown sugar, 1/2 c. icing Sugar, (throw these into my mini chopper for a couple of minutes to process finely), 3 1/2 c. flour & 3/4 c. cornstarch  (pre-sift these 2 together).  I always use my Mix Master Beaters to make this.. I whip the butter on high for 3 - 5 min, then add the sugar and continue whipping until combined and then gradually add the flour/cornstarch mix.  Spread into pans lined with parchment paper about 1/4 inch thick, press firmly into pan, prick with fork and bake for aprox. 20 min.  or until edges are turning brown.  Cut as desired and allow to cool in pan.  Today, I was making them purposely to use in a couple of other dessert I am going to be concocting.  I am supposed to be saving them to be brushed with Irish Cream and/or Kahlua for these desserts however, I have devoured almost 1/2 of them already before I got them to the container. LOL.. they are very decadent and addicting dipped in Irish Cream and my teenage son is currently devouring the other 1/2 and is dipping them in Eggnog!!  Needless to say.. we're both enjoying being snowed in today!  Have a wonderful, safe holiday season & thank you for the great recipe!

This recipe is delish!!  I used other people's recommendations and used 4 cups of flour, 1 tsp of vanilla, 1/4 tsp salt.Perfect texture - my mother in law said they tasted just like Walker's shortbread. Definitely adding to my recipe binder... Thank you

My family really enjoyed this recipe and it was fun to make since it was hands on compared to the "drop" cookies I usually make. I think its only fair to state though for people just starting out that this cookie does not get firm in the oven. It will firm up as it cools but in the oven it still feels "raw" even when burnt to a dark chocolate brown thanks to the hubby distracting you and making you forget about the last tray. lol.
Thanks for sharing!

This was my first attempt to make a shortbread, and it turned out beautifully! I halved the recipe, followed instructions, and brought the ready cookies to my Scottish dance club as a prize for a raffle.

Hi should have read Sy Chandell's review before making this recipe.  I made the mistake of melting the butter, rather than softening the butter.  It made a very crumbly dough that was difficult to roll out and when cooked didn't taste as good as I was hoping.  I am a fan of Scottish shortbread, so I think I'll try this again sometime using softened butter instead.

My husband loves sugar cookies and shortbread and I am always trying new sugar cookie recipes for him.  He loved these!  The amount of butter is ridiculous so they will only be for special occasions!  We rolled them out and used cookie cutters. I used dark brown sugar and they turned brown versus the gold of shortbread, so if you want that look use light brown sugar.  And you definitely need to chill the dough prior to use.

Not only is this a perfectly rich, simple cookie, but it's also excellent to use with cutters, as it does not spread at all and keeps beautiful crisp edges-especially if rolled out a little thinner than recommended. 
Not overly sweet, they actually taste better if kept for a day or two, and are wonderful with tea or cocoa. 
I dipped some in chocolate, and the kids devoured them, but I preferred them plain myself.
I will never make a different shortbread, except maybe to add flavors to this one, it's that yummy.

This was so buttery and good! And much easier than I expected. I followed someone else's suggestion and put some of the dough in the fridge before rolling, which seemed to make those cookies less floury tasting.

So good! These shortbread cookies rival store bought brands! I halved the recipe, used one stick of margarine & one stick of butter and added 1/4 teaspoon of salt and vanilla. I also put the dough in the freezer for 15 minutes or so before cutting and baking. This made it much easier to cut and made the cookies I credibly flaky. Yummy! I'm not sure how much my tweaks helped the recipe but I can tell you that the cookies I ended up with are simply amazing.

Made exactly as the recipe calls for. The first time they burned even tho I only had them on for 20mins, so i ended up throwing the whole batch away. The second time I watched them very closely and it only took about 15-17mins for them to be done. I was really excited to make these since I love shortbread, but these did not come out good at all, all they tasted like to me was flour (and I used dark brown sugar for more flavor) Im not sure what went wrong :( They did not have a nice texture either. I do plan on making this recipe again, but altering the amount of flour or something like that and will update when I do. But for now :( im really bummed.

AWESOME RECIPE!!!  I reduced the amount of flour to 4 cups and made cookies instead of cutting the dough into strips.  Twenty (20) minutes turned out to be the ideal amount of time for baking in my oven.  They came out perfectly!  And they are delicious!  THANK YOU!!! :)

This is an exceptional recipe for shortbread! I make a shortbread chocolate chip cookie & this is the same base but w/ chips added & cooked as a drop cookie. I followed other reviewer's suggestions not only from this recipe but from many of the other ones on this site & used only 4 c of flour & I also believe it was perfect! I added a splash of vanilla & patted it out into a jelly roll pan & pricked it & sprinkled it w/ sugar crystals. My daughter had to have an authentic Scottish dish for a presentation @ school & we did it late @ night so we chose this option instead of of individual cookies. I cooked it about 22 min & let it cool b4 cutting into bite size pieces & it didn't crumble @ all. Absolutely melted on our tongues!

Really great texture. I was worried it would be a little bland when I tasted the dough but it wasn't. I hand formed cookie patties instead of rolling out and cutting. I like that because it gave each cookie a little character. We topped it with some homemade buttercream icing. Yum!!

Best shortbread cookies I've ever made!  I like to add a tsp. vanilla and a pinch of salt to the ingredients.  I use these for my thimble cookies--roll them out into whatever shape you like and press down in the middle a ditch for your favorite jam (mine's raspberry) and cook like normal.  EVERYONE absolutely loves these cookies!!

f I could give this recipe 10 stars I would! By far the best shortbread recipe I have ever used. I've only ever used confectioner's sugar in the dough, but will never go back from the brown sugar! I did add 1 teaspoon vanilla to mine as I love the vanilla flavor. I used 4 cups flour (I read somewhere that the ratio of flour to butter should be 2 to 1 in shortbread). I kneaded for around 30 seconds in the bowl, and then pressed the dough into a jelly roll pan. After pricking all over with a fork, baked as directed. I also sifted confectioner's sugar all over the top of the warm cookies before cutting. Made them look beautiful, and gave just a little added sweetness. I LOVE shortbread, and will make this recipe over and over. Thank you SO very much!

This has been my standard shortbread recipe for years, and I get rave reviews on it. My family and friends literally BEG for it. They speak of it in hushed tones of reverence. You HAVE to try this recipe if you like shortbread. It also lends itself to variations - add almond extract for a brief glimpse of heaven. THANK YOU Linda!

I took a different approach. I used a melon baller to make smaller cookies and sprinkled them with Vietnamese cinnamon and sugar before pressing then with the bottom of a cup. I also baked them for 1/2 the time. Little bites of heaven

WHAT DID I DO WRONG? The bars just melted into oval flat cookies, i trimmed them so they were rectangle, but they were now only 1/4" thick, so many good reviews, what did i do wrong? The oly thing that I changed was I chilled the dough (like you do for pastry) for 30 min b efore rolling out. But that wouldn't make them melt the way they did. I had the same amt of flour in the recipe'. ANYONE, I baked a second batch & had to push all my cut rectangle cookies together so they wouln'dt melt out like the others, I shored it up in a tin foil rectangle, but they were so greasy (yes it was butter but not the fresh crispy crunch of a good shortbread. Perhaps baking them on parchment would absorb a little of the melting butter, (I used Plugra European style butter for better flavor. Reg Land o Laks wasn't geat either as far as taste. I will try one more time w a different all purpose  flour.  Britishblueeyes goes back to the drawing board

This was not amazing, nor was it bad. The buttery layers are yummy, but the second day the cookie takes on an almost cake-like quality. Still crumbly, but too moist (if that makes any sense). Also, a trick I learned in Scotland is to grind rice about 1/3 cup very fine(almost like flour) and mix it in with the dough. this gives it a delicious crunch. Make sure you grind it well!!! Thank you for posting this recipe, it was nice to try something different!

I like a minimal sweet shortbread and this was exactly what i was looking for!  It was a little work, but well worth it.  Next time, i plan on getting some of the bigger sugar crystals to put on top---delicious!

Great, basic recipe!  I cut them into squares that are about 3X3 and I wish I would have cut them smaller because they are so rich!  As one reviewer suggested, I added 1/2 tsp. of salt.  Bake time for me was about 20 minutes.  I am going to be giving these as a gift to chocolate lover, so I plan on dipping one edge in chocolate and crushed pecans.  Will definitely make again, but be sure to cut into smaller pieces.

I this recipe following the directions awhile ago and the result wasn't quite what I wanted.  So I changed the recipe to 1c butter, 1/2c brown sugar, 1 & 3/4c flour.  I lightly pressed white sugar onto the surface of the cut rectangles then sat the batch in the fridge to stiffen, cook time 18min.  It turned out wonderfully, just like the store.

If you are getting a biscuit texture and lack of flavor you are using too much flour.  The original recipe calls for more than is needed in my opinion.

This recipe was incredibly easy, and they tasted wonderful as well.  I used a floured pizza cutter to cut mine which worked very well.  I can't wait to make these for my Mom because she loves shortbread cookies.

This recipe came out very well for shortness, but came up a little low on taste and sweetness.  I think it needs more sugar and a definition of what kind of sugar - I used demerera.  I was very glad that I chose to sprinkle vanilla sugar on top of this before putting it in the oven, it adds a little something special.  This recipe is a brilliant starting place though and with 1/4 cup more sugar will probably be perfect.

Delicious cookie.
I followed the directions and my cookies came out really thin and crispy.  Maybe I over mixed the dough? My next batch I will mix less and cut them thicker.

I can't stop eating them.....

Perfect. Just what shortbread should taste like. You don't need to change it at all. I used unsalted butter so I added just a tiny pinch of salt. To the person who said it tasted bland, they aren't supposed to be overly sweet. I think next time I might dip one end in chocolate.

Wonderful and perfect. I added 2 tsp vanilla amd spread the whole dough out with my hands onto a cookie sheet, then I pooked with a fork the entire sheet. Baked for 22 min and they were perfect. As soon as they came out or the oven I cut squares with a knife. I was soooooo easy and I love how you didnt need any tools of much ingredients. Oh and I also sprinkle the dough with regular sugar before baking so that it would look shimmery and pritty. Its tasted like heaven.

These came out very tasty.  They were very crumbly until they cooled completely.  They were perfect the next morning with my coffee.  I rolled in golfball-sized balls, rolled them in white sugar and some in colored sugar, and flattened slightly with the bottom of a glass.  On a few I pressed a hersheys kiss in the center and those came out great.  Also, I melted some chocolate chips and half dipped a few in melted chocolate.  All varieties were great.  Only bummer is there's SO much butter in them and it's expensive right now.  I halved the recipe and that called for 2 sticks for 12 cookies... YIKES on the hips!  To sum it up:  Good cookie!

My husband really like this shortbread. He gives 4.5, I left it in the oven a little longer than recipe suggested and it came out crispy. I left the dough in the fridge for overnight. Will make this again. Check out the photo.. :)

This recipe is excellent, and definitely deserves 5 stars.  I made this for my parents, and my Mother who isn't a baker and admits it actually said, "It would be nice to have cookie around that isn't too sweet, but satifies your hunger for something sweet, and yet it also isn't too hard to put together." Another thing I wanted to say is if you're having problems telling if it is done.  If you have more than one cookie sheet, or even if you only have one cookie sheet:  one cookie on your cookie sheet don't prick with the fork and then when the time is up, then prick it with the fork and you can tell.  I actually forgot to do one and it was very helpful, because one of the sheets wasn't done.  I hope it helps someone and if you're reading these reviews and wondering if this cookie is good or not (like I was) it is!!

Just finished this recipe.  First time cookie baker, never made any before.  Very very good. Only change I made was to follow ITERIB's method of using a glass in sugar to flatten balls of dough instead of rolling out and cutting.  Everyone here likes them very much tho the last batch is still in oven.  Cooking time was right at 20 minutes. Thank you Linda.

I've made this twice and found it to be a very forgiving and easy recipe. I make it super easy by doing 1/4 of the recipe and melting the butter in a bread pan. Then I mix everything in the same pan and bake it in that pan too. I'm surprised that people are complaining about the texture - I've had the walker's shortbread and I think this is just as good AND I even make it with whole wheat flour. I like to finish mine with a sprinkle of unsweetened coconut flakes on top.

Sooooo yummy!  Even my Scottish son-in-law raved!  I added a pinch of salt and 1 tsp. vanilla, and my oven required 40 minutes.

I only had one cup wheat flour, and two cups white in the house. I had to just pat it out, as it ended up too soft to roll. I mixed with a dough hook in my mixer instead of kneading it. They turned out very nice. They did get soft after a while of sitting out, but I'm not sure if that was because of the flour... they were wonderful right after cooling.

Make sure you use salted butter! And feel comfortable adding a little extra. The salt will bring out the sweetness of your sugar. This recipe was wonderful. If you have to use two pans, expect the cook time to be just a few minutes extra due to decreased air circulation. I personally used my kitchen aid mixer to do all the labor, and I did not knead anything. Easy easy easy...

Super simple, no frills taste. Can also be made in a round cake pan or pie plate. Just bake til browning on edges and done in middle for extra simplicity.

I took the advice of two other reviewers and used cold butter and chilled dough for about 15min in freezer prior to baking (except I kneaded dough for about a minute just to incorporate ingredients together).  After baking, and while still hot, I sifted powdered sugar over as another reviewer suggested...that made the recipe go from good to great!  Ono!!!

Love this recipe! So simple! I actually didn't knead the dough, and just put it in the fridge so it wouldn't be sticky. Then I rolled it out and did cookie cutouts with the dough. If you try to eat them when they are still warm, they will be dry and sandy. Wait until they are cool! It's a crunchy, crumbly, buttery cookie. Great with tea!

Very simple, very cost effective, very good timing as I needed a quick sweets recipe for quick gifts for a bunch of people and no time to go to the grocery and had everything I needed already on hand. When mixed just right and baked for just the right amount of time they are very buttery and crispy. I do suggest refrigerating for a short amount of time to help the dough stiffen a little before rolling out and cutting into shape to safeguard against spreading. Just remember to wrap tightly so no moisture is lost. Also stole one reviewer's suggestion to add confectioner's sugar to the flour when kneading. It does add nice extra touch of sweetness.

I was very skeptical since this was such an easy recipe....but these cookies were great.  Added vanilla to the recipe and dipped the finished cookie half in melted chocolate.....looked nice.  One note, these do not freeze well....they will taste all right but nothing like when you first make them.

Love this recipe!  Easy to make, great taste.  I didn't knead the dough, just mixed it a little with my hands in the end.  And I baked it on a cookie sheet to make bars.   Perfect for the base layer of my homemade twix bars!!

These cookies are deceptively simple. At first they seem to lack flavor, but then the brown sugar explodes in your mouth. It's really great.

I just made these.  OH. MY. GOSH!  They are melt-in-your-mouth fantastic!  Wow!  I halved the recipe to make half a batch.  According to other reviews I added a sprinkle of salt and about 1/2 t of vanilla... this are soooo wonderful!

These were so easy to make and turned out pretty good! I wish I had read the reviews about freezing the dough first before cutting and baking. If I had known that instruction before making this recipe, it would have made it tons easier.

One word:  Divine!  If you're looking for a recipe for Walker's Shortbread.  Followed the recipe exactly as directed.  removed from oven at 23 minutes.  Scrumptious and totally worth the 5 minutes of kneading.

Cookies don't get any easier or more delicious than this.  If you just want something fast, roll the dough out on the cookie sheet and use a pizza cutter to score the bars.  Bake as desired and let it cool.  Then the cookies will just break apart.  You can make them pretty but they will taste great no matter how much effort you decide to use.

After reading reviews and comparing to my English grandmother's (hers only 1 1/2 C flour to 1 C butter) , I added 2Tbls butter, used only 3 1/2-4cups flour (was somewhere in the middle) and an estra 1/4 sugar.  I used 1/2 brown/white sugars.  I think the dough tasted really nice (in the oven now:) and used my kitchen aid mixer, beat it until it was fluffy so I did not knead.  For my choc loving son when it comes out of oven will cover top w/ choc chips and spread when melted.  Cut before chocolate is hard and ship them off to college. I like that this makes 24, I patted in two smaller cookie sheets so will be thinker than yours so shorter bake time.  Grandmas was baked @ 275 for 50 min...don't know if that would change the texture or taste.   Thanks ALLRECIPES for recommendations on cookies for shipping!

Very good, very easy.  I skipped the kneading and the rolling and shaped the cookies into little torpedoes in my hand, smushed them a little on the baking tray, and pricked them with a fork.  I baked for only 20 minutes.  Next time I might do as other reviewers did and press the dough into a small pan, prick with a fork, then cut into rectangles before baking; that sounds even easier than what I did.

These are WONDERFUL if you are careful about the flour measurement. I did not roll mine out, choosing to make balls by hand, so I did not add in the last bit of flour. I imagine they do come out rather floury if you roll them in that much flour! Or if you misread the directions and just add all that flour in. It does specify only adding 3 to 3 3/4 cups of the 4 1/2 cups listed into the dough! If you must roll them out, try rolling them in confectioner's sugar, or a blend of flour and confectioner's sugar, or between plastic wrap like a pie crust. I can't wait to try these again with dark brown sugar! Thanks for the recipe :)

Overall, a very tasty cookie. I made sure to cream the butter and sugar very well before adding the flour. I watched the cooking time very closely, as these go from perfectly pale to very browned quickly. I think these are best when the bottom of the cookies are a light brown, and the top still pale. They turn out crisp and not floury/dry. I think these could do with a hint of vanilla extract for a bit of added flavor. I served with lemon curd, and they were delicious :).

this is a wonderful EZ recipe. Be sure you really cream the butter and sugar well, and I just patted into a jelly roll pan and pricked the dough well.  (I used a BBQ fork!)  Please, please, wait till it is completely cool before cutting it or you will have a crumbly mess on your hands.  Actually I cut it along the lines of the fork pricks I made. (be sure fork goes all the way to the bottom of the pan)

Wonderfully simple recipe.  The brown sugar gives a great flavor.  I adore  shortbread and I've tried many diffferent butter:sugar:flour ratios and this is by far the best.  The only thing I changed to ensure a velvety texture was substitute 1/2 flour for 1/4 cup rice flour and 1/4 cup starch.  I like my shortbread more thick and less like sugar cookies, so I pressed them into a pan (about 1/2 inch thick) and cut them into bars before they hardened.

Use rice flour!! Also your butter bits need to be cold when you mix it into the batter.

This is the BEST Scottish Shortbread recipe (I did add the 1/2 tsp. salt others suggested and a tsp. vanilla).  I had no problem working with the dough, I used the entire amount of flour listed.  I shaped it into a rectange-ish log and sliced them about 1/2" thick.  They were the most tender, delicious shortbread cookies I've ever tasted!  I was worried that the brown sugar would be overpowering but it was perfect.  They did take about 10 minutes longer to bake than listed, but they were worth the wait.  I will definitely make these again!

I love this recipe!! The only problem was that the baking time is a little long so they came out a little dry. Other then that they were good.

This recipe is very close to the one in Martha Stewart's Christmas baking book.   Very good recipe.   I added some vanilla, salt and toffee bits for a little twist.  It came out very well and I would recommend this recipe highly!

I made these exactly as written and they turned out beautifully. I did use 4 1/2 cups of flour. Rolled them out on a wooden cutting board, dough is a delight to handle.  I made rows of fork pricks and then used pizza cutter to cut into the cookies. These are gorgeous! I got a little more than 40 cookies. This is well worth the ingredients.

Not the shortbread flavor i am used to. I think it had a too strong brown sugar flavor. Easy recipe and very nice looking when done, though.

Simple, tasty recipe.  You won't find a better one anywhere.  Thanks to the  previous reviewer who said to spread the dough into a 9 x 13 jelly roll pan and cut the dough  with a pizza cutter. It worked out very well and made things so much easier. Cut the dough before baking, prick with fork, cut along same lines after baking.  No need to roll out at all.

Thanks, Linda!  These cookies are AMAZING and SO simple.  I also added a teaspoon of vanilla and a pinch of salt.  I don't have a rolling pin, so I just used a mixer until smooth and spooned the doug onto a cookie sheet and pressed with the bottom of a glass (dipped in powdered sugar).  Fantastico!!

Wonderful!  Super easy and really good.  Better than any other shortbread I've made.  The brown sugar makes the difference.

These were easy to make and taste great, I used golden brown sugar, instead of the firmly packed brown sugar.

My 3 yr old daughter started to roll them in little balls so I let her continue instead of rolling them out( next time I'll have to try them rolled) She even poked out the little holes. Def a fun easy recipe for her.

Instead of dark brown sugar (which is just white sugar with molasses mixed back in), I use Rapunzel brand rapadura (unrefined sugar). The taste is phenomenal. 

For the coffee lovers in my house, I also add about 1/8 cup good-quality ground coffee (or more depending on the amount of dough I'm making) for Espresso Shortbread. 

This is the easiest and best-tasting plain shortbread recipe there is. DO NOT DIP THEM IN CHOCOLATE. (What's next, music? Explosives?) I have made them both ways with different types of chocolate and I always get unanimous votes in favor of the naked original.

The espresso version is a killer knock-out variation.

This is the perfect shortbread!  Mine spread out a bit in the oven, so I recommend sticking the cookie sheet in the fridge for about 20 minutes before you bake them so that they don't lose their shape.  These heavenly cookies  don't last long in my house once they come out of the oven!

Excellent recipe! The dough was a bit crumbly, and was difficult to transfer after the cutouts, but the baked result was too good and totally worth the effort! I flavored the cutouts individually with granulated sugar, a few with whole almods and the rest with freshly ground cinnamon. Thank you very much for sharing this absolutely delicious recipe!

Fabulous taste, excellent consistancy, easy to make.  All the things you could want from a cookie!  I am guilty of reading a LOT of reviews, so I took advantage of some of their advice.  I let my butter come to room temp, and used half salted, half unsalted.  Then when it came time to roll out, I used powdered sugar instead of flour.  The result was VERY tasty!

I'm still a novice baker so I was a little worried about the kneading. I wasn't too sure what the correct softness it should be but this recipe is very easy~! I baked it in 2 batches, the first I followed the recipe and found the dough very hard to roll. It just kept crumbling, rolling and using my fingers to flatten it was much easier (and created a cute pattern). The 2nd batch I added 1 and 1/2 teaspoon of cocoa powder and it was divine. Both batches I added 1 and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla essence as well, also I added 3 cups of flour and while kneading I added in a mixture of 1/2 cup icing sugar and 1/2 cup flour. It doesn't really melt in my mouth, but it still takes excellent.

I halved the recipe to try it since it called for so much real butter.  Now, I know they are worth every penny and then some.  This recipe is even better than the pricey store-bought shortbread.  To top it off, you get delicious aroma in your home.  Do try.

I made a different recipe before I used this one.  I have to say that the Brown Sugar puts these over the top!  The only thing I changed was adding a tsp of Vanilla.  The only trick is not to under bake these.  Wonderful cookies!  I think I'll go make some right now.

I made these cookies to be served with a vanilla poached pear and grand marnier custard sauce.  I have to admit, wasn't a fan of the sweetness and overwhelming flavor of the brown sugar.  Just a personal thing, but not the taste I'm used to with shortbread.  They were pretty, though, and a hit at the dinner.

Wow, I was impressed.  I've never made shortbread before and I was surprised how simple it was to make!   I cut the recipe in half because I didn't have enough butter softened and was short on time, but they were so easy! I used unsalted butter, I'm wondering if lightly salted might work better and I think I had a bit too much flour.  I took another reviewers suggestion and scooped them out and pressed them out with my hands then put the fork to them.  they were so cute!  I loved them! Will certainly make them again! YUM!

WONDERFUL WONDERFUL! These cookies are truly wonderful! I have to add my praises as has nearly everyone else. I made only half the recipe as a "test" (to save my precious Kerry Gold Irish butter!) and immediately made a second half batch while the first was cooling. I added 1 tsp each lemon extract & vanilla as well as a sprinkle (maybe 1/4tsp?) of nutmeg...I am in love with this recipe. My shortbread cookies came out crisp, flakey & just sweet enough. DELICIOUSLY PERFECT! (if you use salted butter, i'd leave out any additional salt) I used the "glass pressed in sugar" method & would also recommend it...so easy. Also for those whose cookies spread a lot , maybe your butter was too soft? Mine barely spread at all.

I love the recipe for shortbread! It's DELICIOUS!!!! I will never use white sugar again. I followed the recipe except I added a tablespoon of vanilla and a tsp of salt in with the butter and brown sugar. I also just put balls of the dough on the cookie sheet and smashed them a little, I really packed the pan up because they barely spread. I baked them for 20 minutes. It was so easy because all I did was measure, mix, scoop and bake-no kneading necessary. They are sooooooo good and tender and perfect!!!!

Having made shortbread several times with white sugar, I was skeptical about the brown.  I'm now a believer and a sugar convert...great, simple and SUCCULENT cookie!

Absolutely delicious.  I added a little vanilla to mine.  Everyone in my family loved these.  I agree with other reviewer.  Beware the cooking time.  I baked at 300 and mine were done in 20 minutes.

This is SO YUMMY! I was very confused though, because at the top it calls for a different amount of flour than the recipe instructions at the bottom. I changed the serving size to 12 instead of 24 because I didn't have enough butter the day I made them.

Very easy recipe.  Instead of strips I made little balls and flattened them with a glass cup that I had dipped in sugar.  It flattened the ball and added just the right amount of sugar.

I halved the recipe and only used 2 cup flour. Loved that you only need three ingredients that are always in my pantry. Goes great with coffee and my 9 year old dunked them in milk.

I dont know if true scottish shortbread has brown sugar or not?personaly these do taste like the real thing,although i perfer icing sugar it gives more of a light taste and melts in your mouth more.
Well thats my perferred taste.so I think these are a heavier cookie,but there still pretty good. Hope this helps...:-)

I'm doing a 'homemade' Christmas this year and began looking for a good shortbread recipe that would make easy, yet wonderful gifts.  This is it.  I won't look any further.  The cookie is so tasty, with the most wonderful buttery texture.  Thanks for the recipe!!

Lovely! I wanted an easy and quick recipe for shortbread, and this was both. Even my 2 year old helped out. They're really tasty and melt in the mouth. Like someone else said, next time I will space them out a bit more on the baking sheet as they spread out quite a bit. Thanks for this one Linda.

I have made this recipe many times and the cookies always come out great if you use salted butter (or add salt if you use unsalted). When I accidentally made the cookies with unsalted butter my husband thought I did not add enough sugar.  You really need the salt to bring out the sweetness of the cookies.

Wow!! I was hoping to duplicate some shortbread from a gourmet store...perfection.  Next time I will place them further apart on the baking sheet as they spread just enough to touch and lose the nice smooth edge.  Mine needed the full 25 minutes.  Great cookie!!

I made this as a base and a 9 x 13 pan, and then I melted caramel candies with some cream and poured that over it. Let that chill. And then I melted milk chocolate with a little oil and cream and poured that over it. Chill overnight and it’s one of the most popular things I’ve ever made, better than Twix

Delicious, crumbly, buttery shortbread. The brown sugar gives an incredible flavor! I rolled the dough into a log, then sliced into 1/2” rounds, pricked with a fork, and baked for about 22 minutes. Perfection! I will definitely make these over and over.

Go buy a pack of Scottish Shortbread cookies.  These are nothing like them. In fact, these are not short bread at all. 

Warning sign 1: no salt... Bad bad bad.
Sign 2: creaming sugar and butter. This is not short bread. That is a standardized cookie method. Butter should not be bound with sugar and flour. It should be chunked in for a crumbly texture. 

This really isn't good. Not even a little. I made it with no changes using the best ingredients I could find. All I did was waste 4 sticks of butter. 

To a lesser extent, brown sugar was a poor choice but that is my taste. The other issues are entirely wrong ways of making short bread. 

Do not make.

These cookies are delicious. Not as delicate as some shortbread, but a nice crumbly texture. The brown sugar really lifts this recipe to a new level! i did change it up a bit by adding the zest of two oranges and 3/4 cup of mini chocolate chips. i only used 4c of flour. i also took out a 1/2 cup of flour and replaced with a 1/4c each of confectioner's sugar and cornstarch.  i didn't knead the dough until i collected all of the scraps, then kneaded them together to re-roll. i mixed some flour and confectioner's sugar together and sprinkled on my counter to roll the dough on. i laid a sheet of parchment on top of the dough to make rolling easier. i cut them into heart shapes using a cookie cutter, to about 1/4 in. thick, chilled again before putting in the oven to bake. i baked them for 16 mins and they turned out beautifully. i pricked them, but forgot one. that one didn't look any different from the ones that were pricked. so no need to prick the rest.  i will definitely make this again written as is. i tweaked this recipe to fit in with one that i was making as part of my #AllrecipeAllstar challenge. Thanks for sharing a great recipe Linda.

THIS SHORTBREAD IS AMAZING!!!! I made this for the annual cookie exchange and everyone has asked for the recipe! I did tweak this a little bit according to other reviews, adding a pinch of salt and 1 tsp of vanilla. I also ran out of brown sugar so had to substitute with white. 4 cups of flour was the perfect amount, I actually thought it was a little crumbly but they didn't break so it all worked out. I rolled it into balls, topped with sugar and then pressed them down with a glass. They were done in 15 minutes and so amazing. Can't wait to make these again!

Just like my Scottish grandmother used to make! I used 3 cups of flour, and rolled the dough out to 1/2 thickness, then used a shot glass to cut out circles. I placed half of a red glacé cherry on top (like my dad used to do). They turned out buttery, with just the right consistency; not too crunchy, not too soft. Perfect!

I have to try again: I mean, they were good, and my family was impressed all right, and I got compliments. But I (a big devourer of Walkers, and eager to have my own) found them somewhat lacking: is it the salt that's missing? was it the handling (by hand and so perhaps not evenly mixed)? the rest in the fridge, which honestly I didn't allow? don't know. So to be fair I'll give them another chance

This recipe was just what I was looking for. My other half loves the shortbread rounds from Disney World, they are made in Scotland by Walker shortbread. I was trying to find a recipe which produced something which closely resembled the taste of those cookies. These were it, I even stamped them with Mickey Mouse heads. He loved them he said that the taste was almost identical and they were delicious.

I used LauraCA1212's suggestions, adding vanilla and a little salt (I cut the recipes into fourths, so I only used a pinch).  This was delicious and very satisfying.  I would have given it five stars, except that I think it needed a little more liquid.  It crumbled coming out of the pan and had to be eaten with a spoon.  But the flavor was so good I didn't mind.  The brown sugar is a great improvement over other recipes, and I loved how buttery this shortbread tasted.  I will certainly make it again.

This is one of my favorite recipes to bring to gatherings. The rich, delicious shortbread is a perfect addition to any potluck. Instead of making individual cookies on a cookie sheet, I press the shortbread dough into a greased brownie pan and serve it in bars. The recipe really is quite flexible. An addition that I rather enjoy is a splash of vanilla. It goes incredibly well with the richness of the brown sugar. One bizarre thing that I have noted is that some people cannot stand the taste of shortbread. My brother is one of those people. He hates it when I make the shortbread, because he says it gives him a headache, even though the taste is good. Nearly everyone else who has tried it enjoys it, but it would seem there are some poor souls who can't tolerate shortbread. Two thumbs up for brown sugar shortbread!

Excellent recipe.!!! Love it, is a keeper!!! They remind me of Christmas time in England. My husband used to buy boxes of shortbread cookies and we ate them with a cuppa of English tea in cold days. I've baked these cookies for teachers in Christmas time and they love them. I'm glad I came across this recipe they are soft and crumbly, the texture is perfect.

I really enjoyed these cookies. So easy to make! I found that after I creamed the butter and sugar and added the recommended amount of flour, it was just not holding together well enough to roll out. I added slightly more than the recommended amount of flour with no success. I became concerned about making the cookies too floury so I did what another reviewer did. I made them into small balls and pressed them flat with a glass (to the half inch thickness recommeded or slighlty thinner). I then pricked the cookies with a fork and sprinkled some granulated sugar on top. They didn't LOOK like traditional shortbread cookies but they tasted that way. They were a huge hit with everyone who tried them. (The recipe yielded so many cookies that I had a lot of taste testers:)

This shortbread was absolutely wonderful.  This took no time at all to make considering there are only three ingredients.  My husband is english(we all know Scottish vs English. lol..) and he fell in love with these melt in your mouth shortbreads.  Thank you so much for the recipe.  I cook for over a hundred people for wednesday suppers at church and plan to make these for dessert for my next dinner!

This shortbread is ridiculous.  I followed the directions and got something very, very special in return.  This one goes in the Drawer of Well Loved Recipes (messy drawer in my kitchen).

Great recipe.  Followed the directions and could not believe the result.  I used 4 cups of flour as noted by other reviews.  My grandson actually asked me where I got the recipe.

These. Cookies. Are. Amazing!!!
Like others I just whipped the  out of the butter and sugar, then added the flour. No kneading at all. I added just a touch of vanilla as a personal preference and rolled these out with powdered sugar. So, so yummy! These are as good, if not better, than the bakery shortbread cookies. This will definitely go into my regularly used recipe box! A must try, you wont be disappointed.

Really nice, quick and easy - I added a little bit of salt. Will definitely be making these again. I made a much smaller batch and it worked out fine.

Watch out for unclear instructions! I didn't read closely enough, and as a result I added the entire 4.5 cups of flour into the mix. The result was not pretty - very powdery and definitely not a dough. That's when I realized my mistake. To fix it, I creamed together another cup of butter and half cup of brown sugar, and added another half tbsp of vanilla extract (in addition the 1tbsp I put in to begin with) as well as another pinch of salt. Then I continued to incorporate additional flour as needed during the kneading stage. 

The end result: These things are amazing.

I added a dash of vanilla, salt and white sugar. Easy recipe, but if you add few of the extras it comes out tasty! Hardest part was kneading it and rolling it out, falls apart really easy and sticks to the rolling pin, had to add more flour very delicate process.

These are delicious!  So easy to make.  The first time I made them, I just used a knife to cut them into rectangles.  Well, I clearly can't cut a straight line...  tasted great, but weren't too pretty.  Today I used a square cookie cutter, then pricked the top of each cookie with a fork.  Much better looking.  Pretty enough for gifts during the holidays.  I was able to knead, roll the leftover dough and keep using the cookie cutter until the dough was gone.  They took 25 minutes to bake in my oven.

I've been making this recipe going on three years and I LOVE it.... Decided to dip them in melted chocolate this year, and poof! I got the video in my email today... love it.  Very easy to make.  I've been baking them as a single sheet by just spreading the dough out in the cookie pan, then cutting cookies out of that afterwards with a pizza cutter.  After seeing the vid, I'm going to try cutting out the cookies before baking.

I love shortbread and thought this recipe was great.  I appreciate the dough's flexibility in preparation:  you can press it into a 13x9 pan, make cut outs, I rolled it into logs and sliced round cookies, you get the idea.  The brown sugar gives it s bit of a different flavor, too.  I will definitely be using this recipe again.

THANK-YOU THANK-YOU THANK-YOU!  This is the identical recipe I used as a child learning to bake.  My Mom and I would make these before thanksgiving and put them in a tin to age in time for perfection at Christmas!!  I am so pleased to have found the recipe!  People looked at me like I was from space when I would ask for a shortbread recipe made with brown sugar, butter and flour!  The aging ( if you can resist) really makes them 6 stars!

Followed recipe and my cookies turned out a tad too crumbly. They had wonderful flavor, not too buttery.  Best part, they were a breeze to whip it.

The recipe is simple.  I think there may have been an error.  I made a second batch thinking I got it wrong but there was simply not enough sugar.  The brown sugar added a flavor that just didn't work but this may simply be a matter of opinion.

I've tried this once. The butter and sugar were far too much and I had to bake one batch (I made one, which yielded more than the stated 24 servings) for 45 minutes and another (to which I added slightly more flour) for 35. I liked the simplicity of the recipe and the fact that it uses everyday ingredients. In future I'll cut the butter and sugar by 1/4 (and won't pack in the sugar). PS I swapped one cup of flour with unsifted flour and I think I'll swap 2 or 3 cups in the future, not only for better health but to improve taste and texture as well.

Melts in your mouth- truly. I found the cooking time a little short- probably because my oven runs a little cool and the tray was in the lower half of the oven- use the 'bounce back' test by pressing the middle of the biscuit and seeing that's it's soft but firm enough to bounce back. I did add a little vanilla but now I regret not adding a little salt. Nevertheless, this is a simple recipe and the results are just lush - really buttery and yum...

very good. I read reviews ahead of time, and cut the flour to 4 cups since I was planning to pat into a pan and cut into bars.  I dropped the temp since I have a convection oven but then baked them again at the recommended temp the next day because they just didn't bake all the way through at the lower temp, maybe because they were bars and thicker than cookies.  I did add a 1/2 tsp salt and some vanilla.  absolutely addicting and sooooo simple.

I thought this recipe was very bland.  I always do a prototype baking and after tasting it, I added 1/2 cup of brown sugar.  I also melted a few tablespoons of butter and added that because the cookies were very "floury" tasting.  I'm glad I didn't waste a whole batch before I tested them.  After the adjustments they were much better, but I'll look for a better shortbread recipe next time.

Tastes great!  My husband loved this recipe, but it's soooo unhealthy, you might as well eat a cube of butter rolled in brown sugar... lol!!!  It is very easy to make and very yummy, but don't indulge too much, definitely not a healthy treat  :-)

Made these to go with some homemade strawberry froxen yogurt.  They turned out light and crispy with a rich flavor.  The second pan baked for 3 minutes over the 25 and were definately overdone, but are great dunkers.

This was amazing. I put it in a silicone 8x8 baking dish. I let it cook for about 35 minutes at 325, until it was starting to get firm to the touch. I took it out of the oven and let it cool for a minute so I could flip it out of the pan, onto a bread board. I then cut the strips into logs. In order to get those cute dots, I put a quick design on them with a fork. I then transfered them back to the cookie sheet and cooked them for about 20 more minutes at 325. I took them out, let them cool. and then wrapped them in wax paper and put them in a cookies jar. Today, 1 day later, they taste awesome! They will continue to taste better as they sit - I promise!!!

This shortbread shines in its simplicity. Very no muss, no fuss. Given its understated sweetness, it pairs wonderfully with fruit preserves and other slightly sugary toppers. I like to warm mine before eating, to soften it a little and revive its buttery quality.

I just made these and I have to tell you htey are amazing.  I bought some really expensive shortbread cookies last year and it made me want to try some on my own.  This recipe is definitely a keeper! I added a bit of vanilla and they are perfect!  Thanks again.

Fabulously delicious :) Cooked them for a bit longer than the recipe suggests, otherwise they were still a little bit doughy.

My whole family LOVEs this recipe. Hot out of the oven, with some lemon curd spread on, accompanied by a hot cup of tea -- heaven! We rolled ours out 1/4 inch thick and some a bit thicker (nearly 1/2 inch thick as recipe says).  We prefer them 1/4 inch thick.  Otherwise this recipe is spot on!

Absolutely wonderful.  I added pecans to half the batch to make Pecan Sandies.  I also backed off the flour by a cup (personal preference) and sprinkled brown sugar on the tops just for a little crunch effect.  This is a very easy recipe to modify if you want to be a little creative.

These were really good, I think they would be better around the holidays though!  They were just what we needed to cure our sweet tooth, and perfect for the ingredients we had in the house, no eggs, no chocolate chips, no cocoa.  I only left mine in for about 15 minutes, and I didn't add any vanilla or salt, just follwed recipe exactly.  How do you cut the rectangles so straight?!  Do you cut them or use a cookie cutter?  We had no rectangle cookie cutter, so we cut them with a knife, and they were so wobbley :S  I can't wait to make these for Christmas!!!!

It's funny how many different recipes exist for such a humble cookie. I liked the idea of trying the brown sugar and will try that next time, but since I didn't have any on hand at the time, I  used superfine castor sugar and brushed the tops with a little cream before sprinkling belgium waffle sugar on top.  I also substitute a little rice flour for the wheat flour; it just gives it a nice, snappy crumb I favor.

When they say IV........can you 'mainline' these divine treats?? (just kidding)!  I did add 1/2 tsp. vanilla and 1/4 tsp baking soda and dropped in walnut-sized balls which I flattened with a floured glass.  Only cooked them 15 minutes since they were thinner than the recipe reccommended.  Killer-diller

This recipe was very good although next time I think I will take the "Cookie" shape some people suggest as it was very hard to knead kept having to add more and more flour which made cookies taste a little floury.  Also I think I like more traditional white sugar shortbread a little better, but I'm not a big fan of the molasses taste.

We couldnt stop eating this! Only reason I put 4 stars is that it was not as "sandy" as other shortbreads. Very tender and rich--almost too soft. Baked in 9" pie dish, cut into wedges. A small 2" square is plenty BUT you will eat more anyway!

This recipe was outstanding! It was my first time making shortbread, but it was simple and tasted great. I used cookie cutters to make shortbread ducks and dogs. I would maybe add some colored sugar on top next time for decoration - but tasted great!

Yum!  I only made half a batch because I was low on butter, but I'm so glad I tried them.  (I used half salted butter and half unsalted, and also used self-rising flour, forgot to put vanilla in at the beginning so I put a little in at the end, during the kneading.)  I used my cookie scoop and flattened them with a sugar-coated cookie press.  We never got to give them away, because we ate them!

super easy and tasty! I made them twice, the first time I didn't use the entire amount of flour (maybe only 3 3/4) and they spread a little, the second time I dumped in the whole amount and they kept their shape better but were just a tad on the tough side (which is my fault because I then had to use more flour to knead the dough) so definately save a portion of the flour for kneading! I used the vanilla and salt recommended by reviewers. Also, to make even thickness, I used 1/2 inch dowel rods on either side of the dough for the rolling pin to rest on.

I am in the process of making these cookies right now and already am in love with them.  I will be giving them out as part of a Christmas gift.  My heritage is Scottish, so I think it is a neat way to incorporate my roots in Christmas.

Wonderful, simple, delicious cookies!

This is by far the best shortbread I have ever had!  The last batch is still in the oven and the first is already gone!  Me and my 5-year-old whipped these up in no time flat!  When I brought out the rolling pin he ran for the cookie cutters.  Not what I was intending to do, but they turned out great!  We just used small cutters though, I don't know how bigger shapes would hold up.  I also convinced him to let me make a few "my" way, like the picture, and there was no difference.  Great easy recipe!  Definitely worth a try.

Perfect. My daughter's friend offered to buy some from her at school... 

We made them small and round and added a dark chocolate chip to them. I used "50/50 smart balance" with no repercussions.

Once they cool, these are hard enough to hold their shape and soft enough not to crumble. Great for a portable snack.

Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a great tea time cookie recipe. I have a Scottish friend and I passed some of this shortbread along to her and she prounouced it excellent. 

When I was making this, I did have to work in some water to make the dough hold together. Once I did that, the kneading process was fine and I was able to roll it out. This may have been the quality of flour I was using and not the recipe itself, however.

These are decadent! cut these with cookie cutters.  poking them with holes prevented the shortbread from puffing too much, but either way was really fine.  I dipped the cookies in the caramel from "Caramel Shortbread Squares" and then redipped them in melted dark chocolate.  These buttery gems don't last.  Everyone loved them.

These cookies turned out great.  I cut the recipe in half and used brown sugar splenda in the place of the brown sugar.  I should have only used 1/4c of the splenda blend however I wasn't thinking and ended up using 1/2c.  I had a taste of the dough and wondered why they were so sweet.  DUH!  Regardless they were still excellent!

I thought this was great. It was light and sweet. I halved it because I was in a hurry and I didn't measure exactly, but it still turned out marvelous!

I just made this for the first time and it was heavenly!  I halved the recipe because I didn't have enough butter for the whole thing on hand, and had a bit of trouble bringing it all together, was kind of crumbly.  My son helped me cut it into holiday shapes and decorate them.  A second batch was just cut in strips and poked with a fork.  They just melt in your mouth!  Tastes just like Walkers!  My Gran would have loved them.

Oh My! So delicious. I used some other's tips: I halved the recipe, only used 2c. flour, baked at 300 drg for 20 min. I also spiced mine up by adding vanilla and dashes of salt, ground ginger, allspice, and cinnamon. But it is soooooooo good!

Wonderful melt in your mouth cookies with a rich buttery taste! In the first batch I made I added 1 tsp. of vanilla extract & in the 2nd batch I added 1 tsp. almond extract. They were both incredibley good. I decided to roll them out & use cookie cutters to cut out holiday shapes. The dough rolled nicely & I sprinkled colored sugar on top. This recipe is a keeper! My 5 year old summed up these cookies in one word, "incredible!"

Pretty good cookies. Made them in a cookie press and added colored sugar. Liked the very thin ones the most. Tastes just like it is supposed to.
Want to drizzle some chocolate on them next, for the holiday feel.

These are simple, easy tasty cookies. I was going to top them with some melted chocolate, or make some with sugar on top as others have suggested... but after the first batch came out of the oven, I liked them as is! I did add some vanila and salt as other suggested. Next time, I might make them smaller and/or thinner since I like them extra well done. Thanks for this great one!

This recipe is wonderful!  Since it calls for so much butter I just made half of the recipe to make sure I would like the finished product.  For years my go-to recipe for good shortbread has been made with white sugar but after trying this recipe I think the brown sugar makes all the difference in the world.  Great, rich flavor.  Light, flaky and buttery can best describe this cookie.  I will never use the white sugar recipe again!  Fantastic!

Before you try anyother shortbread recipe or buy a package of Walkers you NEED to make these! They are incredible. I made 150 servings for the Soup Hour in my community and everyone loved them. They may not be very traditional but they are better! Just remember to add the flour in 1/2 cup amounts to the mixer and make sure to cream the brown sugar and butter well. 
Linda you rock my socks!

The brown sugar makes these delicious.  Simple shortbread with a wonderful taste.  I added a little vanilla but I don't think they even needed it.  Will definitely add this to my recipe box.

Thank you Linda for this recipe.  I have been looking for a shortbread that tastes like the one that my Grandma made.  She was the only one who would use brown sugar in her recipe.  Your recipe is the closest I've come to it and I just love it.  It brings back great family memories.  I just made this tonight and my friend and I are devouring it!  Thanks again!

Quality butter! 
One year I tested about 8 shortbread recipes
and this one is now my prize.I use the best unsalted butter available and you can't go wrong. It melts in my mouth.Dried cranberries added makes an interesting alternative.

I used this cookie for gift tins at Christmas, and am still getting requests for the recipe!  Be sure you don't overbake, and just for a pretty effect, I sprinkle granulated sugar on the top before baking. Wonderful cookie and very easy to bake.

This recipe for shortbread was excellent.  I also took another reviewer's idea and dipped the cookies in melted chocolate.  The family went nuts!  They LOVED these cookies!

This is such an easy and delicious recipe. I used whole grain flour, 3 3/4 cups, and 1 1/2 tsp vanilla extract.  I rolled out in powdered sugar and cut into hearts. After cooking and cooling  I used an eggless royal icing to finish.  My husband loved them!!

We made these exactly as written, only cutting it in half.  The cookies have a great texture, but we found them a little bland.  WHEN I make them again, and I will, I think I will increase the sugar a little bit.  Otherwise, they are great.

keep an eye when adding the flour.  I had to add melted butter to make it more dough-like.  Bonus, my son preferred it with the extra butter.

Love this recipe. I have made 4 batches, adding the zest of an orange or lemon is a great mixer upper.  I do bake for longer as I like my shortbread less chewy. My family’s new favorite cookie.

It calls for way too much flour. By the third cup, the dough was good to kneed, so 2 1/2 cups went into my batch - and it's not really sweet. I can only imagine how bland these cookies would be with two more cups of flour I need them.
We dipped them in chocolate, to add sweetness.

Only variation from the recipe was to keep them in the oven for about 35 minutes at 335 degrees (the first batch was slightly undercooked at 25 minutes/325). Otherwise, they taste great!

I have made this several times and they consistently turn out. I have sometimes forgotten to kneed the dough and they are still good. I do add 1 tsp vanilla and a couple shakes of salt for flavor. We make these into "moon cookies" for the Mid-Autumn Festival and they hold the shape of the molds very well! For easy release, grease the molds and roll dough balls in sugar. They pop right out with a solid wack! My kids love to make and eat them! Thank you for sharing a wonderful recipe!

After reading many of the reviews I became paranoid that I was going to overcook them. Even so I cooked them more than 8 minutes longer than suggested in the original recipe and they are still underdone! Shortbread isn't supposed to be soft of moist in the middle. It's a crumbly finely textured thing. I feel like this is heading in the right direction and the brown sugar adds great flavor but just far far too soft. If a moist and chewy texture is what I wanted I'd had made soft sugar cookies.

I always find myself coming back to this recipe for shortbread. I use it for the base for coffee shortbread which basically is I just add a couple of Starbucks Via sticks to the dough and also I add a few drops of Penzey's double strength vanilla which makes it heavenly. (I usually make half size dough). Make sure you do not soften the butter or it'd be really hard to handle the dough because it'd be too soft. Always remember to use extra flour while rolling it out. I use cookie cutters for the cookies and I make sure I apply flour liberally.

Made twice. Basic recipe is useable and adaptable, which is what recipes should be before you find ways to make them your own.  Here were my changes.
1/4ed the recipe. Added 1/8 tsp salt. Added drop of vanilla extract, a drop of almond extract. Formed dough in a long rectangular log and rolled each side in sugar crystals. Wrapped dough and froze it for a couple of hours or so. Took it out for defrosting and looked for forms to make imprints in cookies. Chose an owl form on a teaspoon and shell forms on hors d'oeuvres picks (pictures included). Cut dough squares about a 1/2 inch thick (if the dough breaks as you cut, it needs to defrost more-found that out the hard way!). Dipped forms in flour, tapped out flour, made imprints, pricked along cookie edges with a fork, and baked for about 15-20 minutes, checking for brownness, and adding more time if needed. Let them cool completely before eating: flavor improves. Freezable afterward. Giving as a gift.

I baked it in a flat pan rather than cutting it into cookies. I would need to do a lot more work for that, I just cut afterwards. I also used white sugar as I had no brown sugar. They still turned out like when I have made them before.

A simple cookie recipe that is great to do with kids! Only three ingredients (we added a splash of vanilla extract and next time we might try lemon zest to add some extra flavor) !  The kids loved kneading the dough and rolling it flat and cutting it into shapes. No eggs makes it a nice choice for our dessert with our vegetarian friends.

My husband who doesn't normally like shortbread liked these.  However, I normally love shortbread and just thought them ok.

Wow. Once you have had shortbread made with brown sugar, there's no going back. Turned out perfectly. This is a softer shortbread, not crunchy or flaky like some. I used salted butter. On the advice of a woman from England who told me to use the finest-grain brown sugar I could find (and I couldn't), I put it in the food processor first. These cookies also did not enlarge much in the oven, fairly true to the cut size.

I love these shortbread cookies! They're perfect with a nice cup of tea. I've also added Young Living Vitality Essential Oils of Lavender and Lemon just for a different healthy flavor.

Really yummy. Not like my “Canadian melt-in-yourmouth” shortbread. Just different, with a firmness and mellow flavour. I made half the batch plain in fingers and the other half with orange zest and mini chocolate chips. Delish. Next batch is going to have Skor chips. Just a few. Sorry, no photos, all gone. Add salt and vanilla.

Made just as is!!  2 batches - 1 pressed into cookie sheet (found too soft in middle but delicious!) 1 rolled into 2” balls, flatted to 1/4-1/2” and poked with a fork— PERFECT crisp & softish Center.   Made my Scottish hubby & Mum-in-law VERY happy! ??

Really Yummy!  Will definitely make these the standard in my house for shortbread.   Just a note - my personal taste, not a complaint - I made them half with salt and vanilla, and like 'em a wee bit better that way. But awesome in any form.

This was the best shortbread ever! I used a little less flour because of my elevation and a touch of vanilla.... creamy and smooth! It will be my new “ go to “ shortbread!

It is fantastic! The big points are to not Knead the dough, your skin will absorb the butter making them dry. Use cold cut butter, not room temp. It will help make them "melt in your mouth" good. Lastly, pull them out 1-2 minutes early and let them finish cooling on the pan. This will help lock in the butter and prevent them from burning. I did bake them on parchment, this helped them release easily without added oils after cooling. 

Touch the dough as little as possible. I used a pastry cutter to mix up my butter and brown sugar. It worked VERY well.

The hardest part is finding a cookie that is just as good the next day, these are!

I added vanilla and salt as other said that these are bland.

I had a Walkers Shortbread cookie in the house to compare.  This recipe is better!  (All shortbread cookies ARE dry to eat alone and you need to drink with tea or coffee.)  :)

This was a fantastic, easy shortbread recipe. I quartered the recipe and fudged around with the amounts of ingredients until I got what worked best. I baked on the shorter side, since I like a softer cookie. I also made my cookies a little smaller and thinner, though it didn't mess with anything too badly. However, it's difficult to dip the cookies in a regular bowl of chocolate, so I recommend spreading on with a knife or spoon. All in all, a fantastic recipe that I'll definitely make again!

This is pretty simple. Yes, knead it. No don’t add powdered sugar, salt or anything else to it. Cream the butter and brown sugar in your stand mixer until the granules of sugar dissolve in the butter, scraping down the sides of the bowl as it mixes. Sift the flour. Slowly add 3 ½ cups to the mixture. Put another ½ cup on your kneading surface. Turn the mixture out onto the surface and knead that flour into the dough. Add up to ½ cup more flour as you knead. Judge for yourself how much is enough. I live at 7000 ft in the desert and an extra ¼ cup works just right. Now, here is the crux. The dough will not want to hold together well. That’s OK. Using your hands and a rolling pin, shape the dough until it is ½” thick, tamping pieces that crumble, back into the slab. Tamp the edges and pat down the top. Do not make a thin slab. Really go for ½” thickness. Cut the pieces as suggested or use medium size cookie cutters of simple shapes. Carefully slide a spatula under each piece and slide it onto the baking sheet. If using cookie cutters, use the spatula to put the whole thing on the baking sheet and carefully remove the cutter while pressing the dough down inside the cutter with your fingers. 22 minutes in the oven worked well for me. Allow the shortbread to cool before removing from the sheet. Once they cool, they will stay together quite well. You do not want to see a browned bottom. Top and bottom, same color. Perfect shortbread.

I made it exactly as the recipe said and it was delicious. I halved the recipe and filled a 8x8 pan and cut into bars. Had to bake for close to 30 mins. Was crumbly and the taste phenomenal. I also added about a tsp of cinnamon pd. I think it needed more. It is a good base recipe to experiment with. Can add some lemon zest and ginger pd. Or almond extract. I gave it only 4 * because it needs that addition to make it phenomenal.

These are SO delicious, it left me wondering how they could have possibly gotten a bad review... until I tasted my first tray.  I had baked them until they were puffed up and white... but these were much better after they turned just slightly golden.  I had made the cookies on subsequent trays thinner, maybe 1/4 - 1/3 of an inch, and baked them 2 minutes longer, until they were golden.  I tried these first, and they were beyond delicious.  I chilled the dough, then  rolled them in half flour, half powdered sugar, as another reviewer very helpfully suggested.  I suspect the person who left a very bad review didn't bake them long enough.  My underbaked cookies were crumbly and tasted like flour, not butter.  Oh, and I chilled them for an hour after kneading, but before rolling and cutting.  I baked on parchment paper instead of poking holes to prevent air bubbles.  Adding less flour initially made for better cookies.

Pure, simple, and good.  What else do you need to know?

I have made this recipe a few times, now. I even modified it once to add some peppermint extract and crushed candy canes (for Christmas cookies).  This is foolproof!  I use my medium biscuit cutter to make the cookies and pierce them once with a dinner fork.  I bake them on parchment.  They come out perfect every time.  (Heed the other reviews' warnings about watching the baking times.  It is very easy to overbake these, destroying the texture.)

I have never made shortbread before.  These are easy and very rich. They want to melt in your mouth.  

NOTE: COOK TIME VARIES BY THICKNESS. THEY ARE DONE WHEN THEY ARE LIGHTLY BROWNED AND SET! Use whatever cookie cutter you feel like. I used a 2 inch circle and it only took 12 minutes. I also opted not to dip them. I dare anyone not to love these. 

P.S. Thanks to allrecipes.com, I am having the best Christmas baking season ever! I am never relying on a single cookbook again. Happy baking!

Excellent recipe - cookies exactly what I was looking for. Will make them a little smaller for a dainty plate 1x1 perhaps.

These cookies have a wonderful flavour!! They are very moist and not dry and brittle like other shortbreads.

I love short bread cookies, but certainly not the price stores charge! I've made Linda's recipe twice now and it's soooo easy and delicious. I did incorporate other ideas from the reviews such as   adding vanilla and salt and shaping the dough into two logs, wrapped in wax paper and chilling them in the fridge prior to baking. This makes it much easier to cut the logs into uniform 1/2 slices. I also used dark brown sugar. I found the baking time is pretty critical depending on the thickness of the cookies. I put the first set in and baked for 22 min. and the second set and baked for 24 min. The 2 extra min. gave the second batch a better flaky melt in your mouth texture texture.  I had tried chef John's recipe and while good, the process of cutting in the cold butter was a bit tedious and time consuming. I took another reviewer's idea and cut the cold un-salted butter into slices, ringed them on a plate, and micro-waved them on defrost just enough to soften them a bit. It makes it easier to incorporate them using a mixer. The second time I made them I decreased the vanilla by 1/2 tsp. and added 1/2 tsp of almond extract and rolled one log over cinnamon sugar prior to slicing and baking. They tasted was so good!

Very good! Nice flavor, easy to make. Like a lot of other people I used 4 cups of flour and didn't knead it. I also added some vanilla and salt, I can't help myself. Great recipe, tender and flavorful

I made it as suggested and found the flavor to be just ok. It wasn't bad, but not really worth making again. I'll search for another shortbread recipe with a bit more flavor.

Don,t waste your time or butter on this one. Truly not a shortbread. Tastes bland even after I added 
vanilla to the batter.

I was worried on how this recipe would turn out with how skimpy the ingredients were but it turned out to be delicious. I had to add less flour due how crumbly it got.

The cookies turned out great! I added two teaspoons of vanilla extract. Also, once cooled I dipped the cookies in melted chocolate which made them extremely rich......but who doesn't like chocolate!! I will definitely make it again.

Awesome! I made it with my 2 and 3 year olds and came out great! We made half the quantities, as I could not imagine us eat that many. Came out about two dozen. We had Christmas shapes and the 3 year old help cut them out.
I let the cookies bake in the oven for 20 minutes, but when I tried to take them out they seemed they were all too mushy, I put them back in for another 5 but they were still mushy, so I took them out anyway, realizing that's the way they were supposed to come out.
They hardened once they cooled off. And they are delicious. The kids love them and they had lots of fun making them.
Thanks for a great recipe!

Finally found the taste of scotch shortbread again! - actually made this recipe with gluten free flour mixture blend (equal amounts of white rice, Quinoa and oat flour) due to gluten allergies. Used 1 T of lemon peel and 1/4 t salt - and it worked great! Only did a half recipe to see if it would work and it did!

This is hands down the best shortbread recipe I have found. I see there a few negative reviews here and all I can think of is that I use salted butter for the recipe and then add 1/4 teaspoon of himalyan pink salt (finely ground) which really gives it a lovely buttery, salted brown sugar taste. These shortbreads have gotten rave reviews from everyone I give them too (as gifts). The best.

Yah!  I can bake cookies!!  I'm a great cook - but a terrible baker -- my cookies and cakes are always disasters (usually because I rush it I imagine).  I made these - they are great.  I don't have baking tools - so I creamed the butter and sugar with a fork (sore hand now), rolled them out on a cutting board with a wine bottle, and baked them on the bottom of an upside down corningware lasagna pan.  If I can do this - these are un-mess up -able.  Delicious!!

I made this shortbread recipe but added Raspberry Jam after baking  to an indent made with a wooden spoon handle down the center of each strip. Then I made a simple confectioners sugar and milk drizzle icing to drizzle over the rows after baking. The best shortbread recipe I have EVER made.

I loved this recipe! After I took it out of the oven, I brushed the top of the cookie with melted salted butter. This made all the difference in the recipe and the taste was a genuine shortbread flavor.

I turned the shortbread into thumbprint cookies.  They taste so good!!  I did everything as stated in the recipe except letting the dough rest for 20 minutes in the fridge and baking the cookies at a higher 350 temp for 20 minutes.  The cookies came out short, tender, crisp,  light golden brown and the jam dried out enough for a slight chewy texture.   I may cut down on the sugar the next time I make thumbprints, but I would leave the sugar level alone if making plain shortbread cookies.

Having made a few changes based on other reviews (added vanilla & salt), I can't rate this recipe down too much, but I will say it is much sweeter than shortbread normally is--almost like a sugar cookie.

This is the recipe, the one I've been searching for, for so long! I will never use white sugar again in my shortbread; that was what made the difference in the taste. I did take some suggestions from other reviews. I added about a 1/2 tsp of salt (I do this to every cookie recipe, anyway). I also made a second batch, swapping out 1/2 cup of rice flour for the same amount of white flour, and those came out the best! The texture was exactly what I was looking for-that sable texture with just a little crispiness. Perfection! I don't know if it was because of the rice flour, but that batch seemed to be done 2-3 minutes earlier than the all wheat flour ones. I started checking my oven around the 18-20 minute mark.

I added 4 egg yolks and a tsp or so of salt. I may add another 1/2 tsp next time I make this recipe. I made a basic powdered sugar icing ( water, vanilla, and powdered sugar) and added sprinkles. SO GOOD! I will be saving this recipe.

I've made this recipe for years.   It is  identical to, except for  cooking temp and time, to another popular cooking magazine/site recipe.  It's a sturdier, delicious old fashioned shortbread cookie.  It would be great to add to one's  Christmas cookie  gift list.  You could dip the ends in chocolate, do different shapes as well.  I have used other cutters, leaf shaped for example, small pie sized for bite size cookies and medium, and pressed the leaf line pattern into the tops as well.  As the cookies don't raise or spread, they hold the patterns for the most part and can be a great addition, w/out having to add frosting,  to a cookie tray or dessert table  for any occasion.  My tip is to use a pizza cutter if your doing simple square, rectangular or diamond patterned to cut.

Made this last night. It was delicious. When I was kneading the dough I stopped once the dough reminded me of sugar cookie dough. We tasted when it came of of the oven and it was weird but once it cooled down it was wonderful. It was too hot for tea so we had ours with milk.

This shortbread is insanely delicious. I used the recipe because I was trying to make up a layered cream cheese/strawberry jello concoction. Well the top layers just turned out to be meh but we ended up scraping it off and eating ALL of the crust because it was SO good. My son loved it. So now that I've tried it as a crust (and I will definitely use this recipe for a crust again. I'm thinking next time pressed in a tart pan and topped with lemon curd) I'm also going to make cookies with it. Since the Girl Scouts decided to stop making the only Girl Scout cookie I've ever liked, the Scot-Teas (these were shortbread cookies but had large granules of sugar on top, YUM) I'm going to make round cookies with sugar on top. I'm sure it will be incredible. I used my food processor to cut the butter into the sugar and flour and just pressed it into a 9X13. Perfect!!

I thought the cookies tasted bland but okay. However, the real test was done by my 11-year-old. She's never seen a cookie she didn't like...except this one. She ate half of one and said "Gross, Mom!" A cookie kids won't eat? That must be a first!  I am going to retry the recipe, though, with white sugar instead of brown.

I like this cookie, it is good. One of my friends showed me this recipe, it tasted good. Also the amount of ingredients is a small amount.

Made exactly to recipe and turns out perfect every time.  The only shortbread recipe I use anymore, in fact just delivered several Christmas cookie boxes as presents to friends and family this last month. Have made both rolled out and cut into sticks or rolled out and done in shapes with cookie cutters.  Only thing for me is that it's so sweet you can only eat a little at a time - but that's probably for the best anyway!

Absolutely, deliciously sinful desert! fast, easy & ingredients most always have on hand.  I added chocolate chips & it lasted all of one evening!  thank you for this recipe!!  best short bread we have ever tasted.  ( second time I made it I mixed flour & sugar together  then melted butter and added it.  mixed together to form soft "dough" & pressed into pie plate & baked.  turned out thick,  buttery & almost cake like.  it was pure joy)

Enjoyable flavor, easy to make, and great with a cup of coffee. But I couldn't help but feel like my bake was just a little off. Be it in the texture or in the flavor, the potential of the recipe was not fully realized in my first bake- but I'll have to try again soon!

I made these for the Christmas holidays. They went over very well. They freeze well. 
I used, light brown sugar, unsalted butter, used 1/4 c. less flour, spread the dough mixture in the shallow pan, took a pizza cutter and made 1 inch squares, poked each with a fork. After baking I brushed on melted salted butter to give a smooth finish without the floury texture. And sprinkled icing sugar on top. Pure buttery heaven.

I made this as the recipe described, and added a little vanilla extract and a little sugar dusting as suggested by other reviewers.  I used my ceramic shortbread molds and they were perfect at 325 degrees for 20 minutes. These are the best shortbread cookies I have ever had, and I can't believe how easy they are to make!  Thank you so much for this recipe!

Anyone who says these aren't a true shortbread didn't have a Scottish grandmother. These are wonderfully authentic & take me back to memories of my grandma :) Do NOT switch out the brown sugar for white!! The brown sugar is what gives these cookies their wonderful, albeit mild, taste. Scottish shortbread should make you want a cup of tea  because they're a tad dry. Mmmmm, pure heaven!!!

These were so good!  Exactly what I was looking for.  Didn't change a thing.  I did sift the brown sugar to get out any lumps.  Takes a little extra time but worth it.  Perfect!

I was born and raised in Scotland. This recipe is not quite as good as my grandmothers but very close. I used shot glasses to cut out the perfect sized circle and I added chocolate chips too. Yummy

Amazing! These are sort of like tea or coffee biscuits, but BETTER! My family didn't like them as much as I did, but I love them! I made half the batch the first time and they were (not too) sweet, crunchy, and most importantly, delicious!

Several reviews recommended cutting back the flour by one half cup (1/2 C.) and that felt right to me.  I wish that I had set the timer for a bit shorter time and checked it earlier, as I cooked according to instructions and they came out a tad bit brown, especially around the edges. 
That said, I had never made shortbread and tried this recipe to take to our local Celtic festival.  The "experts" in attendance said that it was absolutely perfect despite being slightly brown and it disappeared quite quickly. 
So, this will definitely be my go-to recipe for all of our Scottish events.

Nice recipe! Added lemon extract and vanilla with a pinch of salt. Used 3 3/4 c. Flour but used extra flour with confectioners sugar to roll. Was a bit sticky at first but did roll out nicely and I used a scalloped cutter. The time was longer than the 25 min but kept a close eye on them and turned out great!!

My mother makes the best Scottish shortbread ever! That was until I made this recipe today. I would never have thought of using brown sugar but I'm glad I did. Thank you for this recipe as I silently sit and devour my third shortbread! And I just finished making them before school gets out so I still have time to hide them!

Absolutely amazing just as it is written.  I did 3 cups of flour in the mix and then hand mixed the flour into the mix on the cutting board while kneading.  I ended up using about 4 cups of flour.  I did add vanilla and a touch of salt.  I formed it into a rectangle on the board and cut it with a pizza cutter.

Perhaps I dont know what a shortbread is supposed to taste like, but this was bland. First thought after first bite,"4.5 cups of flour may be too much flour."

Decent cookie. Not a showstopper whatsoever. I didn't get the "fall apart-melt-in-mouth" results I thought I'd receive judging from the reviews. Followed the directions to a 'T' but the cookies came out soft and not as buttery as I'd have liked. I doctored a bit with some Biscoff spread but I'm going to try colder butter next time.

I made 2 batches of this, and both were great! The first I followed the recipe exactly (with the exception that I did chill both to use a mold). It came out buttery and yummy on its own, though I did fancy it up with a light sugar/lemon glaze that went well with it. The second I used some of the other reviewers suggestions and added a smidgen of vanilla & almond extracts as well as a very small pinch of salt. It took it to the next level: Heavenly! Fantastic on its own and perfect for customization, Awesome recipe!

We absolutely LOVE this recipe. Before you eat, you may want to grab a glass of cold water. These are delicious, but are very dry. (not a problem)  You can shape them using cookie cutters which we found worked VERY well. It is very simple to make… you will probably have the ingredients sitting in your kitchen already! Especially if you like to cook often. Note: I am a child writing this review, and as everyone knows, children love sweets. Well, most children. But my mom loved it too.

We made these for Christmas and therefore changed the recipe to 12 servings because we won't be serving 24 people. CharlotteChef, (ME) recommends www.allrecipes.com  -  and says to make it a habit to come here for all of your food directions. 

Thanks for reading our review!

12.20.12 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/11341/scottish-shortbread-iv/ ... I, surprisingly, liked white sugar ones better than brown.  I cream & add the flour, press into a jelly roll pan.  350,10 minutes; 300,40 minutes. Score after 2 minutes.  Cool in pan.  A little dark chocolate on one side is yum.  Note4Me:  Not about the recipe, but an idea. Photo showed cookies, but this is what got me: Looked like those peppridge farm white chocolate mint drops (shaped like hershey kisses) that come out at Christmas. They have a name I can't remember, but are in a clear bag with white round pa-?- sprinkle things, come in yellow, pink & green.  Anyway, those with a candycane stuck in the center.  My idea: Kisses with a birthday candle stuck in it.  How cute would that be?!  I'm thinking KK's birthday 14!  :)

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and the family loved it. A guest even said it's better than store bought. It's easy and delicious. A winner for sure and the recipe will be shared with my children.

Wonderful recipe! Halved the ingredients, used light brown sugar, added 1/8 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp vanilla paste. Baked only 20 minutes and it came out crumbly and perfect with tea. Will definitely bake again. Maybe I'll even stick to the original next time. :)

I split the ingredients in half, used sifted whole wheat flour, margarine, and added medjool dates in the creaming stage with the brown sugar. I used the food processor for creaming and kneading. It was ready in a snap. Perfect cookie to complement tea.

Easy, basic, dangerously delicious. This shortbread was dense, tender and quite popular. I doubled it and baked it in two round cake pans, then covered one with caramel & chocolate. The plain turned out just as delicious as the jazzed up version.

Another novice! I've never tried a shortbread recipe!  I DIDN'T CHANGE A THING - except the baking time.  Why?  I made fat bars maybe 1" x 1-1/2" x 3" and baked 30 minutes instead of 25 because I only left a 1/2" space between bars - not knowing they EXPAND.  My bars snuggled next to each other - so they needed that xtra 5 min.  Yes, use salted and SOFTENED (but NOT melted!) butter.  Bake on baking paper (parchment)!  Then they do not stick to the pan. Thank you!!!!!

I must say, when I'm craving short bread cookies yours come to mind.  it's easy with only 3 ingredents, easy to make and always comes out perfect.  It sort of has a nutty taste with the butter and brown sugar.

Amazing, delicious! I chilled the dough as was suggested, but it was still very very crumbly. I pressed it into a pan and then sliced it up before cooking, and 10 minutes after cooking. I don't know if they get better with time because they didn't last long around here. I'd give 5 stars, but the dough was very crumbly and I coulnd't roll it out.

Best shortbread cookie I have ever tasted.  I made it for the first time to take to our annual Academy Awards party (I try to bring foods that fit the movie titles and this was the year of "The Last King of Scotland"...I know, I know, Idi Amin wasn't Scottish...but it still seemed appropriate!).  Anyway, every year since, my friends tell me to bring the shortbread cookies.  I'm making them now...along with "Ava-tarts"  :)

So rich and delicious.  These aren't very hard to make.  We made them pressed in a round and then cut them into wedged, but I caution you to keep those wedges small, this is one dense, rich cookie.

This was great! and very very easy.  This is everything shortbread is meant to be - it melts in your mouth, it is moist and also sweet.  I added crushed macadamia nuts and it turned out so so so good!

omg these cookies are phenomenal. I just baked them and they're already half gone. I will make this again to take to work. Everyone loved it. It came out really good, just a little pale because I made them in different sizes.  I also used less flour and it came out soft and a little crunchy. Baked it for 10 more minutes because I wanted it a golden brown color. It was really good.

I thought this recipe was just okay. I followed the recipe and got a very light cookie with a sort of powdery texture that melts in your mouth, and I like shortbread that's denser with a bite to it. I feel like you wouldn't even really need to chew these, just press them against the roof of your mouth with your tongue and they'll dissolve. Maybe that's exactly what most people like in shortbread, but it wasn't what I was looking for.

delish! this is one of those true Scottish short breads. a heard hearty biscuit. if you are looking for a more tender cookie like experience, i suggest icing sugar, butter, flour and a pinch of cornstarch. i did not whip this recipe at all. i just used a wooden spoon. i also pressed half the dough into a pan (my dough was not very rollable) which took a little more cooking time, the results were a true Scots cookie. Good Luck

Compared to other shortbread recipes, this is just okay. The consistency is a little hard to work with (My dough was very soft and tore easily -- it made for some interesting looking cookies). The taste wasn't exceptional but not terrible. Overall, just okay.

Best shortbread recipe I've ever found for an "authentic" taste. I have to stop myself from eating the dough each time! Be mindful of your oven settings, however, and make sure the dough isn't too dry on your first batch.

These are very yummy even my 1 & 4 yr old girls agree! I cut the recipe in half as I only had 1 cup of butter. The only thing I did different is I did not knead the dough and I sprinkled them with white sugar. The reason I did not knead the dough is cause I used a spatula to cream the butter then I slowly added the flour until it was stiff enough and when I formed a ball it didn't melt down. I used a tbsp to measure out and rolled them into balls, flattened them a little and sprinkled the tops with white sugar. Not sure how long I baked them for but it was just before they started to turn golden around the edges. These made 35 cookies using half of what the recipe called for. I just took them out of the oven and we already ate 10 of them. They will deffinatly not last long. I will have to make more. OH I used salted margerine not butter. Update:March 11 2009. I have made these twice since the first review and I did make 2 changes. I used real unsalted butter instead of margerine and used 1/2 cup rice flour. I will still be tweeking this recipe a little to make them more flaky but not much is needed and they are really good as the recipe calls. These will be great for Easter as I will sprinkle Easter colored sugar on them.

I made the recipe exactly as written. I have to say I am pleased! It made way more servings than indicated which makes me feel less bad about how much I want to eat! The only difference is that I sprinkled white sugar on the top before I bake them. My husband is half Scottish and has spent a ton of time in Scotland. He's happy. If my picky Scottish husband is happy, I'm happy!

What a great recipe for shortbread... and to think I always used white sugar! These cookies melt in your mouth and will be gone in no time.  Next time I will try and spice them up a little.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I used the suggestion of the drop cookie, using a scoop and dropping directly onto the sheet. Then I gently pressed down with two fingers. My daughter dipped one half in melted chocolate bark and some she drizzled in a random pattern. Very good.

Tasty but not quite the original shortbread. I guess for an American cookie it taste great but for the true Scottish cookie I think it falls a bit short. I plan to replace 1/2 cup flour with rice flour instead as I heard it gives it the "real" Scottish shortbread texture.

I made these for my family and they love them. My husband and I find them too buttery, but I think that's the point of the cookie. I am miserable at making them look uniform like in the picture, but at least they taste good either way.

These were great.  I rolled them in balls and dipped the top in sugar in the raw and flattened them with a glass.  I dipped some of them in milk chocolate.  We'll add these to the favorites.

I followed the recepe exactly, making half a batch. Nice crispness, but the cookies are slightly bland. My family still love it though. i roll the dough and press it flat before pressing a M&M candy in the middle of each cookie. Managed to make 34 small round cookies.

Super yummy cookies!
I added a little vanilla and used spelt or oat flour or a combo of the two (I forgot which kind of flour I purchased)? Anyway, it worked well and the dough was very moist. It would have rolled very easily, but I just spooned it onto the cookie sheet. The cookies spread a tiny bit. In the future I may add a bit of cinnamon and may press the cookies into a pan, then cut for squares. They were a bit crumbly after cooking. I only cooked for 19 minutes at 325.

Absolutely perfect.  I decided I wasn't going to roll out the cookies, and instead formed the cookie dough into a long rectangular shape, wrapped it in plastic wrap and chilled it.  Then I sliced individual cookies off from this loaf, poked little depressions on the top, and baked them.  Much easier.  

I shared some of these cookies with my mother who raved about the taste and asked for the recipe.  She couldn't believe the recipe had only three ingredients.  

The dark brown sugar definitely made a difference in the taste.  Next time, I will try about 1/4 white sugar, 3/4 brown sugar just to see the difference.  These are the best I've ever had, though.

Oh, and someone else's suggestion about dipping these in chocolate - yum!  Or how about putting a square of chocolate on the cookies the last minute they're in the oven?

Awesome! Very easy and quick. You may not think you can do much with these basic ingredients but you'd be wrong! Use actual butter; the taste is pure and classic.

I made these to include in a hostess gift bag for someone having us over tomorrow. I was nervous about giving a new recipe as a gift, and even though I liked them, I tried them out on my husband and he loved them. He kept sneaking in to snatch them while my back was turned. Great recipe!!! Thank you!

I only gave this four stars because the dough was so hard to work with.  I had to chill for an hour before rolling it out because it would just stick to my powdered sugared board. Even tho I am not a big fan of shortbread I like it alot.  I sprinked it with granulated sugar before baking.  Smells great while cooking.

This was my first atempt at shortbread.  I was looking for a simple tasty cookie for the holidays that I could leave alone or decorate if I felt ambitious.  They turned out great.  Having never made shortbread, I wasn't sure what the dough was supposed to look/feel like when it was ready.  I may have over kneaded it.  They were somewhat, but not too hard.  A nice crunch.  I also tried Scottish Shortbread 1 which turned out much lighter. The shortbread lovers in the family loved them both.  I will definitely be using this recipe again.

Wow is all I can say.  These cookies are the best shortbread cookies I have ever eaten or made and I have tried several recipes before, all were good but nothing compared to these!

The dough I found a little a pain but most shortbread dough is.  I added 4 cups of flour.  Very good and will make again.

Very good. I am trying to become more of a "baker" instead of a cook.. so this was a great recipe to start with. Got a little creative and added a hint of almond extract  and dropped an almond in the middle of the cookie once they were cooked. 
Took the advice of another review and just rolled the cookies into balls and flattened.

I don't know what happened with this recipe.....it came out horrible for me. The finished product spread when it was cooking making a total mess in my oven. It actually tasted really good(when does butter and sugar ever taste bad) but it ended up about 1/4 inch tall.   I will try again because it was so simple maybe I'll just make one batch instead of doubling it.  If it works next time, I will rate it again.

Really good, but I wish it were lighter and more melt-in-mouth sensation.

Yummy shortbread recipe.  I also added 1 tablespoon vanilla and cinnamon as others suggested.  I had also sprinkled a mixture of brown sugar and cinnamon on top prior to baking.

These shortbread cookies are fantastic. After baking them, i place them in the freezer and pulled them out right before I dipped them in melted mint chocolate. They were fantastic and disappeared quickly!

This was exactly what I was looking for... I made teaspoon sized cookies to serve with tea... delicious!  And do be warned... though simple, they are addictive.

Very good recipe; I think baking times or amt. of butter may be off...my bars spread like wild fire!  came out distorted and mishapen.  I am going to try again tomorrow, trial and error I guess!

The cookies aren't bad, but they don't taste like shortbread - maybe it's just me; my husband loves them, but to me, they just taste like toffee with flour.

I followed LEVINIDO's tips for the rasberry shortbread cookies & dusted them with powdered sugar at the end.  So easy, so good!! I don't usually like shortbread cookies but I was impressed.

The up-turned glass dipped in sugar suggested by another reviewer was great, by the way, and I'll use that tip again for other recipes.
I approached this recipe with real interest, given the rave reviews it has received from other writers.  But it was rather disappointing.  Yes, it is a nice enough cookie.  No, it is does not have the taste or texture of authentic Scottish shortbread.  And, no, I don't think I will bother making it again.

This is the way it should be! I even halved the recipe and it worked out well! Some of the other shortbread recipes on here are too dense or too floury. I shaped these in balls and flattened adn tehn pricked with fork....YUM
