I have made this a couple of times.  My favorite way is using raspberry lemonade and lime or raspberry flavored vodka.  Depending on the number of people, I will sometimes serve it mixed with lemon-lime soda.

Awesome. I ended up adding an additional beer to cut down on the "syrupiness" and because everyone was drinking it up so quickly. Have made this 3 times already. This will be my go to backyard BBQ drink! Thanks for sharing.

This was quick to make, I had most of the ingredients on hand, and it tasted great!  The only thing I didn't care for was the beer smell was kind of strong when drinking it, maybe I need to use a better beer :-)

Very good! It tasted like something I had back in college! It was a very good drink for the summer.

This could be very dangerous... it tastes like candy! It did have a rather strong beer smell like another reviewer mentioned, but it didn't really bother me. I used Yuengling lager. This would be a great summer drink!

My husband and I really enjoyed this drink, very summery.  We doubled the beer like other reviewers suggested and added lemon slices.

Made this for a fantasy football party and called it "Linebacker Lemonade" - HUGE hit! Inexpensive to make for a large group and tastes great.

We used to make these back in college, but we called the concoction "Strip and Go Nakeds". It's tasty but deceptively potent. The last time I drank this I remember very little other than finding myself in the men's bathroom at a college bar. That was 27 years ago, and I'm still a bit scared to drink this.

Try using a flavored vodka, like cranberry or lime to add a new dimension to the flavor.

Great refreshing recipe!  I'm sure there are a lot of versions of this easy thirst quencher...We called them Sip and go Nakeds back in the day :)  Be careful, they sneak up on you!
