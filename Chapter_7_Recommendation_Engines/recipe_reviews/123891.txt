Oh my goodness!  This cake is amazing.  I made it just as directed except had to mix in some walnuts with pecans and it turned out amazing.  I have made 4 of these at friends/family request.  When I took it to a family reunion everyone thought my mother-in-law had made it!  Now that's a compliment.

Absolutely delicious! I will be making this often! I baked it in a 13 by 9 pan for exactly 33 minutes. I reduced the sugar in the cake to 1/2 cup and used walnuts instead of pecans because that is all that I had. No need to double the crumbs, there were plenty, and the cake was very moist! Oh and I skipped the glaze altogether. Really no need for the extra sugar!

You can't go wrong with this recipe.  It is perfect, though a bit sweet.  Next time we will reduce both sugar amounts as the drizzle topping is also total sweetness.  Perfect dinner dessert and morning leftover!

This was verrrry good!  I made it in a 9X13 pan.  The batter was a little thick and I was a little worried but it came out wonderfully.

Very tasty and I like that it is from scratch not a box mix or using a yellow cake mix! I did use a little less sugar in the batter mix. I always add more nuts than called for and I'm always happy I did. I will make this again. Thank you.

Made according to the directions, and turned out great. Take it from oven and left sit for 10 minutes removed from pan and HB started eating right away. He comment was "oh my god this is good", another keeper.

Very good and moist.  I ran out of time so I skipped the icing and didnt miss it.  Maybe next time I will put a small amount on for looks but the streusel so tasty you dont need anything else.  For the streusel I put it all in a food processor (with a bit of vanilla) and pulsed a few time.  Nuts were a perfect size and it all combined great.  45 mins in a bundt pan was perfect, makes more then enough streusel so you dont need to double.

I always make the recipes the way they're written the first time, unless everyone agrees on a modification.  I didn't have pecans, but this moist coffee cake is delicious.  If you do like I did, and not split the batter/topping in half but just put all the batter in with all the topping on top, add about 5 minutes to the cooking time and let it cool a lot before trying to serve.  :)  Will make this again.

Very Delicious! This is the first coffee cake I have ever made and it turned out fantastic. My husband helped by reading the directions while I mixed everything up;I did make a boo boo while mixing the ingredients, however, it still turned out great :) This is absolutely a keeper. Thanks for sharing!

this coffee cake was superb!! I couldnt stop eating it! i added 1/2 cup of brown sugar to the dough and also added a bit of confections sugar to the frosting to make it thicker, and i added walnuts with the pecans. the time of 45 minutes was perfect and it was a delicious treat soon to be made again!

This coffee cake is AMAZING.  After reading some of the reviews, I opted to leave the icing off and the cake didn't suffer a bit for it.  The streusel topping, as written, is outstanding.  I will be making this again and again!

Delicious and very moist and the streusel makes a lot however, when I turned it out of the pan the bottom stuck to the pan. I don't know what I did wrong, but the cake still looked good just more of the topping exposed. Will make again because this is a great coffee cake.

This coffee cake is very good. It is very moist. This is the first coffee cake that I've had with sour cream in it and it definitely gives it a different flavour than what I am traditionally used to. This recipe is a definite keeper.

Best coffee cake I ever made! So easy to make but oh so tasty. I made it exactly like the recipe. I only did not put pecans because my children don't like nuts. Even without the pecans it is delicious! This recipe is a keeper and a winner! Thank you for sharing!

i bake a lot but my bf doesnt.. and he wanted to try to bake coffee cake by himself.  He did everything wrong.. he mix all  the ingredients in different orders.. he didnt' even have a mixer so he was mixing with a spoon. and amazily the cake still came out DELICIOUS!! haha :-)  the only problem we had was the streusel topping wasn't crumbling. it was liquidy so we couldn't crumble it on top like how it said.. it was more like plopping pieces of liquid sugar on top instead. i'm not sure what we did wrong.. but in the end it still tasted very very good! very easy to make. luv it!  this will definately be the GO TO Coffee cake recipe to keep!!

I am only reviewing the streusel topping and icing. I used these with the Quick Coffee Cake submitted by Stephanie from this site. I loved the topping and so did my Hubby! I mixed it throughout the cake and on top. I am saving this for sure.

My teenage daughters asked me to make a coffee cake--I chose this recipie to try.  I wish I never had! The cake was gone in a day--now I am left with the memories---so so so good. I substituted greek non fat yogurt for sour cream but everything else stayed the same.  Perfect!

Absolutely love this cake!  I didn't have pecans last time I made it so I got pralined pecans from the gas station and the cake was delicious!!!  The only problem I run in to is that the cake always seems to fall apart, even though I follow the recipe?  Don't really care!!!  Tastes just as good whether it's in one piece or two!!!

This cake was moist a delicious!  The sour cream really gave it a wonderfully moist and unique delicate crumb.  Since I didn't have a bundt pan available I used an eight inch cake pan wrapped with a wet magic cake strip to help keep the sides from overbrowning.  I also made extra streusel to sprinkle on top of the cake, and eliminated the icing because I'm not overly fond of both icing and streusel.  This made it have just the right amount of sweetness, I'm definately making this recipe again!

I thought this was really good. It got a lot of compliments when I took it for a teacher appreciation week snack. I used heavy whipping cream in the glaze rather than milk and spread the "frosting" just on the top part. It tasted yummy. And the frosting I will use on cinnamon rolls. :) Good recipe. Will make again.

To me this was very dense.  I like the usual crumbly coffee cake, and I'm thinking maybe there should only be 2 eggs in here rather than 3.  It was a bit too heavy for my liking.  I did reduce the sugar to 1/2 cup and it was enough.  Also, I added a pinch of salt.
I skipped the icing part.  I just did a bit of conf. sugar with milk for a lighter icing.  I don't think I will make this again, as it's just too heavy of a cake for my family.  It's very sweet and rich.

Delicious! This will definitely be my "go-to" coffee cake recipe. I loved the filling. This is even great without the glaze.

I have made this cake a few times and it gets better & better.  I no longer use the icing, it is wonderful without.  I will be making individual cupcakes this time around, it keeps things neat and easy.  I do not have to portion for my guests.  Awesome recipe!
I did cut back on the baking soda, used half as much.  Still came our amazing!

Made this for the first time yesterday. It is really good, very moist and tender. I don't think it even needed the icing so I might omit that next time. Also, I wouldn't split up the streusel topping, just put it all in the middle. Otherwise, the recipe is delicious!

This is an awesome recipe just like it is. If you follow the directions to the letter, you cannot go wrong. Two tips - if you enjoy cinnamon, don't hesitate to double the cinnamon to one teaspoon. And consider pouring a small amount of the icing slowly over the cake as soon as you remove it from the pan. The warm cake will absorb the icing, making the flavor a little sweeter. My wife and I absolutely LOVE this recipe. So do her co-workers. You will too. Thanks Jim!

I followed the recipe exact and my family loved it!!  But I can not rate it with the icing because they ate it before I could add it.  The struesel part makes it sweet enough and gives it great presentation without the icing.  Definately will make again.

I would use less butter in the topping next time. I used the recommended amount and it turned out very thick and was unable to spread it over the uncooked batter. I ended up mixing it slightly into the batter. Wasn't the best result but it worked. Also used a little more powdered sugar in the icing so it turned out thicker and sat better on the cake.

This cake was very good!  It was moist and delicious! I skipped the icing since it was sweet enough with the streusel in the cake and on top.  Will definitely make again!

I made this for a brunch yesterday. I just loved it, the ladies loved it and my husband too! I did make some changes though: I lessened the sugar to 1/2 cup, I used whole wheat flour, and used walnuts instead of pecans. I was a little bit concerned the dough was too thick, but after reading other reviews I was reassured it would come out just fine, and so it did! You could also lessen the sugar calories by substituting the white sugar for Agave Nectar. But beware Agave Nectar's Sweeter than sugar so remember this rule: 1 cup sugar = 2/3 cup Agave Nectar. Enjoy!

This was pretty good. After trying several coffe cake recipes, this is by far the best. I used a dark bundt pan so as one reviewer commented to watch the baking time I did only have to bake for 35 minutes. I left the nuts out due to nut allergy in the family, but everything else the same. Will make again.

Excellent recipe!  This was a hit at a woman's breakfast I took it to.   The streusel topping was amazing, and I have made that by itself a few times, to use in  quick cinnamon roles.  The icing turned out terrible though, but that could have been my mistake...

I was pretty my result however, if your using a dark bundt pan; you should take 10 minutes off of the posted bake time to avoid burning the cake.
