So I can't rate this recipe for itself the way it is written. I'm giving it 4 stars only because the baking time is a bit low and at 15 minutes even when cooled the cookies fell apart when I picked them up. SO bake them longer an additional few minutes... also I added one cup of walnuts 1 ripe banana and I left of the currants...I thought they would be too sweet with 1 whole cup of condensed milk but they weren't! Perfect on sweetness. Try them! They're yummy:)
