My reason for not giving it a five is due to the fact that the recipe should tell the novice cook to let the sauce sit for a moment so that it will get a bit thicker.  I put it in directly with the pasta(as listed in the directions), and for the first 5 mins had pasta soup.  It eventually thickened up, and had great consistency.
   On the "taste" end of things, I thought the sauce was awesome.  I'm being serious.  Now, I'm a big fan of the Alfredo from Olive Garden, and anyone who eats there regularly will know what I'm talking about.  I'll have to say, this version is second to Olive Garden's.  I was more than pleasantly surprised.  
   Anyone who loves some good ol' Alfredo, definately try this one out.  Also, I added extra parmesan to the sauce.  It was magnifico!

I have one major complaint: The recipe doesn't make enough sauce!  Eight servings?  No way.  At least not with the size servings we have at my house.  There were 2 1/2 servings at best.  Next time I will triple or quadruple this.  I reduced the salt by half and it was ever so slightly salt top-heavy, probably because the butter I used was salted.  But that is a minor, easily corrected issue.  And it's a common reason why recipes come out too salty.  As another reviewer recommended, another reason that it might be too salty for some is if one uses the off the shelf parmesan cheese.  Since it's such a major ingredient, spring for the fresh stuff.  I used freshly grated asiago cheese, and it was spectacular.  I thawed and microwaved a couple of chicken breast cutlets.  Slicing the chicken in long pieces makes for a nice appearance if one places the cutlet on the pasta in it's original shape--not to mention a great recipe enhancer, making the pasta a full-on meal.  Pasta, chicken, sauce, in that order.  What a meal!

With this recipe the alfredo sauce is to die for, however the type of pasta that is mentioned in this recipe is not good.  Mostaccioli is a heavy pasta that does not work well with the alfredo sauce.  When I make this sauce I use Fettuccini.  The Fettuccini makes this dish one of the bests.

This recipe is a KEEPER. A genuine GREAT "base" for dressing pasta dishes. I've been using it for years (just never knew -- or even thought about -- the proportions). 

Thank you.

*******

Given this SAUCE tossed over pasta, you can decide about your accompaniments (chicken, beef, seafood, vegetables, etc.).

Add whatever you like (cooked onions, peppers, peas, corn, carrots, zucchini; cooked beef, poultry, seafood or whatever) to your PASTA.

If you feel like it, add (fresh is preferred, but dried is OK, too) Tarragon, Dill, Marjoram, Basil, Oregano, or Cilantro. 

Got a man (or older boy teen) in your home? Think about incorporating bacon and/or one or more "shakes" (approximately 1 T.) of Worcester Sauce and/or Hot Sauce and/or prepared Horseradish) into the SAUCE.

Use ANY pasta of your choice. IMO, the "thicker ones" (e.g., rigatoni, rotini, gremeli, penne, etc.) are preferred (they're more prone to absorbing the SAUCE, as well as the flavor(s)). 

Use THIS SAUCE and your own preferred "accompaniments". It's unlikely you'll go wrong!

*****

We use SALTED butter in my home. Therefore, I do not add salt during preparation of ANY dish I prepare (the shaker is on the table at all times, but no one seems to notice). At the same time, this recipe seems to "work better" when UNSALTED/SWEET butter is used.

My advice: start with this SAUCE (it's really good) and "run with" the rest of your mral.

Though this was pretty good the first time I made it we added chicken and I thought it was still a little salty.  Also though I like parsley, we thought there was a little to much.  Now when I make it, we cut back on the salt and parsley and use penne pasta.  I also use chicken breast cut into chunks and sauteed in olive oil.  If your looking for a little extra kick, cut up your chicken breast add to a ziplock back with cajun seasoning, shake till all chicken pieces are coated sautee till no longer pink and add to sauce so flavors blend.  Yummy.

**Great with shrimp added too~**We loved this ! But I  just had to say 'NO' to the heavy cream.  I used my standard replacement~carnation fat free evap milk--12 oz can, 1/2 cup salted butter and 2 TBS low fat cream cheese. Real garlic, not powdered and NO SALT.  sooooo good with chicken and grilled eggplant

I was looking for a simple recipe and I finally found it.  I modified it somewhat.  Instead of boiling the pasta and making the sauce seperate, I used 2 cups of water and 1 cup of 2% milk, added the butter and parsley, left out the salt. I brought the mixture to a boil, then added 1/2 box of no.9 spegetti.  I boiled that till the liquid was reduced by 1/2, took if off the heat, then added the parmesian cheese.  I let it stand till all the liquid was absorbed by the pasta, we each added the salt to taste and it was great!!!!

Ugh! Not sure what I did wrong but this was sooooooo salty.  I used dried parsley but I halfed it.  I tried to add more cream and milk, but it didn't help.  I finally put potatoes in it to absorb some of the salt. I will NOT make this again.

I think this is an excellent sauce, just as it is and the type of pasta you picked to go with it was a good choice as well. I usually add some vegetables to it-sometimes asparagus sometimes fried zuchinni but always top it off with spinach and chopped roma tomatoes (cooking everything but the tomatoes before adding them in of course). The vegetables complement this dish and make for a nice presentation. Thanks for the yumminess Kimber. =)

This was so easy to put together. I added 1 cup of Ricotta cheese to make the sauce thicker for pizza and also used fat free evaporated milk to cut the fat. My family raved and when our 4 year old actually eats something new, well we count it a keeper. A must try!

Followed the recipe exactly, except for adding some sliced chicken breast. The sauce was amazing! Tasted like it came from a fine restuarant. I will definitely keep this for future use.

2.11.15 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/26249/alfredo-mostaccioli/ ... "IT!" Using a cup of heavy cream, 1/4c butter & 1/2c parmesan - Yum.  Only thing was that I had to thicken it.  I used 2T cornstarch & it did fine thickening it, but was less than smooth - slightly like melted cheese.  Not stringy, but not creamy like it should be.  Sooo, maybe a T is the right amount.  Oh, & used with salted butter so didn't add any salt.  Also didn't add garlic.  That's for the garlic bread you serve with it!  :) Time2:  1T flour did fine for thickening.  Also, with the amounts I gave, this recipe makes a cup & a half (half pound of fettuccine's worth, maybe a little less).  GOOD...1/13 Another update: First time I've added the sauce to the pasta.  It thickened just a little too much so maybe 1/2T or even none (I know, I know, I read the reviews, too! :D It just doesn't look like it's thickening.) is required. Adding it to the pasta, it needed some salt, too. It is so rich that half pound serves 4-5. Can only eat half as much as a good portion of spaghetti.  'Thinking double sauce & a 12oz box pasta would be right. Update: Probably 1 1/2# for double recipe. Tried 1/8t salt w fett & it's too little; try 1/4t next.  1/2T flour is fine when putting sauce with fettuccine.  Yum.  Still more (sorry!) Final IT: 1# fettuccine,1/2c salted butter, 2c heavy cream,1c parmesan, 2T flour (if having it on the side),1/4tsalt (if mixing with fettuccine).NOTES for me: Look at Manassas & reeree818 re

I used this sauce with some mini penne pasta by barilla and it was wonderful! I used fresh parmesean cheese I grated myself and had to add a little extra salt to the finished dish. I think maybe people think this is too salty because they used the parmesean in the green bottle from Kraft - good stuff on some things - but not for this recipe. My picky husband who doesn't like cream sauces even said it was pretty decent. I'm a vegetarain and love to indulge on cream sauces and thought this one was great.

I altered this a bit. I made 2 lbs of vermicelli noodles (family of 6) and tripled the sauce recipe. I used half and half instead of heavy cream, and I was a bit shy on the parmesan so I added finely shredded mozz cheese. I did not add any additional salt, since I was using salted butter. And I needed to add flour to thicken the sauce. However the end result was SO good. I added broccoli and mushrooms to the dish for a rounded meal. Next time I will include chicken or shrimp. Thanks for sharing - it's a great base to build from!

I totally killed this recipe - but it still turned out great!  I was trying to double it, and
added twice the parmesean.  So I added more cream and butter - but it was 
too thing.  I added some cornstarch - MISTAKE!  I thought it was turning out fine,
when all of a sudden the whole thing separated!  My sister suggested since I 
couldn't make it any worse, to put it in the blender.  It worked!  It was thick, 
creamy and really cheesy!

I love it! I add cooked chicken and mushrooms to mine when I make it,use a little less parsley, and use fettuccine instead. Everyone that I have made it for loves it, even my husband that's not big on alfredo.

This was soooo good and even better - EASY!!  I wish alfredo sauce would reheat well!!!  I did double the sauce which was the perfect amount for a 16 oz box of pasta and added 1/2 c extra of a 3 cheese blend (asiago, romano, parmesean)  I will definitley be making this again, maybe next time I'll cut down the butter just a bit.

Flavor wise this is great. I served this as a dipping sauce for Cheesy Chicken Meatballs. I followed the recipe with no subs. It was a tad salty so next time I'll leave the salt out since cheese is naturally a bit salty. In the saucepan it seemed to be melted all the way but as it sat and I was dipping my meatball I noticed that the cheese was clumping up. I will probably try to make this again because I love alfredo and this had a great rich taste. I just need to work on getting the parm to melt all the way.

I have made this several times.  I made it as written the first time and found it was oozing butter, had too much salt, and too much pasta for the amount of sauce...3 stars.  With modifications it is a very flavorful and healthier recipe.  Now I use half the pasta, replace the heavy cream with whole milk, reduce the butter in half, and eliminate the salt.  Usually I saute chopped onion or shrimp in a little olive oil with fresh garlic (instead of powdered garlic) and to that I add 1-2 T flour and cook for a minute or so; I add this mixture to the butter and whole milk mixture and let it thicken slightly before adding the Parmesan cheese.  Add your favorite vegetables, seafood, or chicken to change it up for even more variety.  Great flavor.

I melted the butter first, added some minced garlic, about 3 tablespoons of creamcheese, melted that-then the whipping cream.  Simmer for a while to thicken.  Yummy

This was a very good recipe.  The only change I made was that I upped the Parmesan cheese to 3 cups rather than just one because I like my alfredo sauce thick.

Use chopped fresh garlic instead of powder. Always tastes better.

good flavor, just way too salty! I guess my butter was salted (it was out of the package, so I couldn't tell), and I only added half the amount of salt. I added broccoli florettes to the last few minutes of the pasta while it was cooking and sauteed chicken breasts to the sauce. This sauce is thin as well, but I thickened it by adding a mix of heavy cream and cornstarch and adding it to the sauce. If I make this again, I will tweak it a little.

Loved it! So easy to make and delicious. I will definitly be making this again. I didn't give this five stars because I think the sauce needs to be doubled. ..This is a keeper, thanks!!

I've made this sauce a couple of times.  The first time it came out great; the second time it wasn't the same- probably my error.  My first try at alfredo sauce and it was yummy!  Thanks!

Quite good. I lightened it up a bit with fat free half-n-half and I only used a pinch or so of salt. I also used fresh garlic, instead of garlic powder. I just sauteed the garlic in with the butter just a bit before adding the other ingredients. I did add lightly steamed broccoli, just to cut a little corner at dinner time.  Four servings? Psh. MAYBE four. We really liked this. REALLY liked it. No leftovers.

Fantastic sauce.  Great for dipping too!  I did omit the salt, and it still had plenty of taste.  Will certainly prepare this again.

This was wonderful. I changed it just a tad, I used 1 pint of whipping cream instead of a cup because that's how it is bought and I didn't want to waste it. I also didn't use fresh parsley but dried parsley, instead of a cup I used 1/4 cup. I sauteed shrimp on the side and placed them on top when served, it was great. Awesome Friday night meal during lent. :) I'll be making this again.

Very good sauce and the right choice for pasta.  I would use less pasta than the recipe calls for because I like excess  sauce to dip bread in. I would also use a little less parsley.  A keeper though!

Not enough sauce for a full pound of pasta, I'd triple the sauce amounts. The sauce is thin and the pasta soakes it up as it sits. Used fresh pressed garlic, 3 cloves, and omitted the salt. I've had better, won't make again.

I used whole milk because that's what I had on hand.  I also wilted some fresh spinach and added a can of diced tomatoes.  With my additions, both the taste and the appearance reminded me of an Italian dish called La Bandiera (the flag).

This is a huge hit with my family, especially my Alfredo-loving husband. I did make some changes after the first two times I made it because it was too salty for us, and the Parmesan ended up being too gritty both times (still tasted great though!). I now use unsalted butter, no parsley and lessen the amount of black pepper, as well as adding Asiago and Romano cheese and grilled chicken on top. It always goes fast in our house!

This was such an excellent base sauce for me! I am a complete Nub to alfredo and wanted to do something nice for valentines day, all I changed was adding in about a tbsp or a little more of lemon juice and ditto for wine, and then added some asiago shredded cheese with the parmesan because I felt festive. It was amazing, I even had the sauce done early and had to reheat it (bad timing on my part) and it turned out fantastic, simple, easy, cheesy, and delicious!  I mixed in steamed broccoli and boiled chicken afterwards for some zest and the flavor carried through, definately will reccomend this one, and added it to my recipe book!

Wow! This one will have you licking your plate clean! I made it with 2 cloves of fresh garlic and freshly shredded parmesan (from a container). I have a warning, however. 1 tsp of salt will probably be way too much. I used less than half a teaspoon as well as unsalted butter and it still came out a bit salty. I suggest tasting it before you add any salt. Odds are if you use salted butter and salty parmesan, you won't have to add any salt. I may want to try thickening it a bit with cornstarch next time so that I don't have to let it cool off so much.

The sauce was absolutely great. I served it with Penne pasta and chicken , I sauteed the chicken in olive oil and cut up some onion to cook with it. I only used 1/4 a cup of the Parsley instead of the full cup the recipe calls for and I only used a dash of salt, it came out great.. I will definitely make this again
Thank you

Amazing pasta dish!  I switched out the black pepper for some crushed red pepper and a touch of ground Cayenne and halved the parmesan I put in, and by the time I had eaten one bite my three friends had eaten the rest.  I will make this over and over again

This recipe was a good one.  The sauce came out really great, and I personally did not find it to be too salty.  The only issue I had was that it was only really good when first served.  It doesnt reheat well at all.  Once you refrigerate it the sauce seems to dry up completly.

I really liked this recipe. It was super easy to make and didn't take very much time at all. I would say that the next time I would make it, I would add less salt. It was a little to salty for me. I would recommend this recipe if you want a tasty fast meal. I will definitely be making this again!

I put it on some fettucini and I thought it was  going to be amazing becuase of what the other reviews said. But wow was that misleading. It was so buttery, it felt like I was swallowing liquid fat and not in the good way. Also, it was pretty tasteless, and no matter what I did, it just could not be fixed.

yum!! the sauce was perfect, took the advice to cut down on the salt because of the salt in my butter and the advice to make more than the 8 servings. I tripled the recipe (except the salt and only doubled the pasta) and it was devoured! It was simple to make and delicious, everything you want a good meal to be!

Did not like this. I followed the reviewers and let it sit before pouring over noodles. Still too runny. Will not make again.

I love it! Yummy-next time I will double it though so we have enough! Thanks!
**Update-Needs to be doubled to comfortably feed eight people and "pair" appropriately with the amount of noodles. Make sure that if you use sticks of butter - which I have grown accustomed to doing - that you use the unsalted butter. It will be way too salty otherwise.
This has certainly become a favorite in our home. We have had it several times now and we love to serve it with chicken for a more complete meal. Thanks a billion for posting this recipe!

Very yummy and even the kids love it.  Must be served right away because once is cools it isn't as creamy.

I had a hard time getting the Parmesan to melt, but the sauce was very good.  Note - trying to heat leftovers causes the butter to separate.

I doubled the sauce like others suggested and I added a teensy bit of fresh garlic with the powder. It was deliciously rich and tasty, will definitely make again!

This is great alfredo!!  We always double the sauce, never seems to be enough, and serve grilled chicken on top. Be sure to let the sauce thicken before tossing though. Yum!!

THIS WAS DELICIOUS!  I'm a VERY picky eater and I made this on a Thursday and because it was so good I made it again the following Saturday!  Great for singles like myself who want a quick but good meal.  I added Italian Seasoned Chicken by Perdue (already cookd) to my sauce and some leftover broccoli and had a fulfilling meal!  I love the fact too that Allrecipes recalculates for smaller serving sizes so I had no waste.  Just remember to allow time for the sauce to thicken and ENJOY!

I made this for the  first time last night and I only changed one thing. I doubled the recipe because I have a larger family, but I didn't add as much parsley as was called for. Only because I didn't have more. Still came out yummy.

The entire thing was SUPER delicious. Reviews have stated that it's too salty and I think the problem is with the butter they're using. You have to use UN-salted butter...

My only advice is watch what butter you buy and don't feel like you have to "add" anything because it's good all by itself. Great for the novice cook that wants to make a quick meal and not have to worry about anything.

What a wonderful dinner I made last night. Thanks to this little dish. It was perfection. I made almost as written, usind unsalted butter and making sure to let my sauce stand before adding the noodles. It is easy and way yummy.

I don't understand what is so special about the recipe. I used fresh grated cheese and it definitely needed some salt to it. Good thing my guests enjoyed the dish because I think it is too plain.

I thought this was the best/easiest alfredo sauce I've had/made yet.  It was a bit salty when I tasted it alone, but once you tossed it with the pasta it was perfect.  Thanks!

Wow, was this awesome! I did feel it was very salty, so next time I'll omit the salt and lessen the parm. Plus I sauted zucchini in butter prior to sauce completion. Maybe that should have been accounted for in the salt measurement? Either way, a little tweak for the veggie addition and its will be a regular! Thanks

Used a lighter pasta as suggested.
Felt it needed more garlic. Also a I felt it was a bit thin.

The alfredo sauce is great.  My boyfriend says it's better then Olive Garden, however, I thought that the mostaccioli was a heavy type of pasta.  Next time I make this, I will use a lighter pasta.

After I wrote this, I tried the sauce again with Fettucine and it was to die for.

I served this sauce over chicken and angel hair pasta and it tasted great.  Next time I will only add half the salt because it was a bit salty.  Also, I didn't have any fresh parsley so I substituted with 1.5 teaspoons of dried parsley.

Yum very good. I added spinach and chopped tomatoes, used a crushed clove of garlic as well as some garlic salt. Mine was slightly grainy. I think due to the cheese being almost 2 weeks old, I wanted to use it up and it didn't melt well. It was still good. Though next time I make this I will use half the box of pasta, there wasn't quite enough sauce for the whole box.

This was outstanding, after reading some reviews I doubled the sauce recipe and used a 1/4 of the salt required, the garlic powder and parmesan cheese provide enough of a salted taste that was perfect. Did let it stand for several mins so it was not runny. This was very, very good...

I really loved this and was so simple to make! I added sauteed mushrooms to mine, used half a cup more of cream, but cut the butter to 1/3. Will definitely make again! Served this with a mixed green salad with garbanzo beans and garlic bread.

Although we will definitely have this again (a non meat dish my husband likes is a keeper!) there were a few issues. One, as most people have pointed out, there is too much salt! I would leave the salt out of the sauce and add it to taste if necessary later. I used fresh garlic rather than garlic salt, and used a bit more parsley. Two, the sauce needs time to thicken, and I still added spinach because it was very thin. Three, this is NOT 8 servings. There was just enough left over after two of us ate for my husband to take some in his lunch! But overall, really really good!

Just finished eating this - SO, so good!!! Very few changes made: Used fresh garlic and boiled Penne pasta instead (that's what I had on hand). I also used Asiago cheese. I'm sure the recipe "as is" would taste just as good, but that's what I had in my kitchen and it was wonderful. Not the healthiest, but from time to time what a lovely treat. No issue with saltiness like other reviewers. Perhaps unsalted butter is the key here (that's all I ever use). Loved the amount of parsley used in this recipe! I lightly fried some chicken strips for my husband then added that on top of the pasta and then drizzled the sauce on top. I'm a veggie so I lightly fried some veggie chicken strips for my son and I. This is a definite keeper and I'll share with my guests in the future. If I have guests I'll double or triple the sauce recipe as the sauce fed just the three of us - perfect! Must try this as it was really to die for...

This was wonderful, however you'll need to at least triple the amount of sauce for the amount pasta. I had to go back and make a lot more.

This got raves here. It was fast, simple, and my husband even got seconds he liked this so much. I served this with a salad and garlic toast. I only used about 2 T of parsley the entire amount called for seemed way too much for our liking. Thanks I'll fix this again soon.

I give this 5 stars for ease. I was trying to throw something together last minute, with stuff I had on hand. I halved the recipe, and used evaporated milk because I was out of cream. I added 1/4 cup frozen chopped spinach to give it some veg, and ate it as a meal for dinner. Yum! Very easy and versatile recipe.

This alfredo sauce was one of the best I've had.  It was hard to believe that I made it!  After reading some of the reviews, I made some of the suggested revisions and it worked out wonderfully.  I used the recipe for 12 people but kept the pasta at the 16 ournce package to make sure I had enough sauce.  It was just right.  I used unsalted butter and hand grated parmesan cheese but I added a little extra because I like it that way.  It was just perfect!  Not salty at all.  Nice cheese flavor.    Great dish and not hard to make at all.

Simply wonderful. I wanted to try out a new pasta recipe (I had been doing experiments with my grill.) I love this, its look and feel, texture...I have to say, it is one of the best pasta's I have ever cooked.

So easy and very light. It's not a filling heavy alfredo. I loved the amount of parsley that is needed.

I've been making this recipe almost exactly for years!  The only difference is I use 1 quart of milk and 1/2 pint of heavy cream, reserving one cup for the end.  I do let the sauce thicken more and then I bake it in a lasagna dish.  This was my Italian husband's family recipe.  It really is WONDERFUL!

Mmm this was tasty!  But be sure to let the sauce sit for a couple of minutes (it needs that time to thicken before adding to the pasta).  Also if making for a crowd, adjust the recipe- this made 3 normal-sized portions, maybe 4 if you're dealing with light eaters.  Thanks Kimber!  :)

This sauce was so good! I made a few changes and added sauteed chicken tenders and broccoli. I used fresh garlic, fatfree evaporated milk, lowfat cream cheese, fresh grated parm reggiano and penne pasta. It came out great!

Delicious!  And very easy to make!  I made this exactly as directed, & it turned out fabulous!  One note though, it does make quite a bit, so you may want to cut it in 1/2 for a smaller family!

Excellent recipe for a basic start. I added 6 oz. of Parmessan instead of the 1/2 cup and lots more garlic... fresh garlic... I never use garlic powder! Next time I will reduce the amount of parsley... 1 cup was just a little too much. Then I threw the sauce in a sautee pan with pasta and grilled chicken, and sauteed for a couple extra minutes to get everything evenly heated and to thicken the sauce a bit. EXCELLENT!!!

Delicious!  Do let it stand 3-5 minutes before serving and it thickens up to the perfect consistency.  Wonderful flavor as is, and, as previous reviewers have mentioned, many variations are possible starting with this basic recipe.  This was a big hit with the whole family- served with grilled halibut and a garden salad and everyone commented on the pasta!

Easy and Delicious.  Not the best pasta dish I have ever had, but it was exactly what we were looking for in an alfredo sauce.  I used minced garlic and dried parsley.  Also added brocolli.

This was very good! The parsley added a nice surprise (I put a little less than called for). I did take the advice of the others and cut the salt in half and it was plenty. Try with seasoned shrimp it's even good with just the shrimp if you want to omit the pasta -  for all of those "guilty eaters" out there! Thank you, will make again.

The best Alfredo I've ever had.  I changed it a bit to make it more like a meal and added chicken.  Mine wasn't salty at all and I seasoned the chicken with garlic salt. By using dried parsley or not using the right parmesan cheese definantly would cause it to be salty.

My husband and I LOVE this recipe.  I make the pasta and the sauce and he sears some chicken on the stove.  I am usually done with my part before he is so the pasta sauce thickens up nicely mixed in with the noodles while it waits for the chicken.  It's definitely a family favorite!

This recipes was great! Quick and easy! I did it in my crock pot. I cooked the noodles separate but I did the sauce in my crock pot and added the noodles and shrimp it was great! The crock pot kept it warm. I am a student and a mom so I come home for lunch and try to prepare dinner or get stuff ready for dinner so this was great. I cooked it at lunch and came home and ate it for dinner! My husband LOVED IT!

I read the reviews before making the meal, and read that others found the sauce to be too salty.  Because of this, I altered the recipe before I started cooking.  I omitted the salt, used half the amount of parsley, and I hoped that would do the trick.  Unfortunately, it was still too salty and the meal was just alright.  I guess there's no way around it- you have to buy "real" parmesan cheese. Thanks for sharing though!

I must say other than the 1 cup parsley it was good but you had to get past all of that parsley to taste it. I think it should call for 1/4 cup instead of 1 cup.

This is ok.  I have had much better.  Anyone who puts a cup of parsley in is going to be very let down, to much.  I put maybe a quarter cup in.  This isn't bad but NOT a wow!

This was easy to make and very tasty.  My hubby ususally doesn't care for alfredo but he actually liked this one.  Next time I might cut back on the butter just a bit.

Wow!!  This is amazing!  It's not an alfredo as if in, per say the Olive Garden, however, the flavor is wonderful!  I did not change anything other than used the spice parsley because we don't ever have fresh.  This will be made again and again and again!  Thanks for a wonderful easy recipe!

Absolutely wonderful recipe. Only thing I changed was that I used fresh garlic and dried parsley. (It's what I had). I am not sure how this would have come out if I had not used freshly grated parmesan as opposed to that fake stuff in a can but it probably still would have been good. I have been looking for that perfect alfredo sauce and have finally found it. It did seen a little salty when I sampled it befor I put it on the pasta, but, when I added it to the pasta it was perfect. It it so rare that I find a recipe that all 6 of my kids and my husband likes. Thanks for sharing!!!

I really LOVE this recipe! I made it just like it's listed and the only adjustment I will make the next time I make this is cutting back on the parsley. I will probably go more with 2/3 cup.

While a little salty, this was very good.  My boyfriend actually requested I make this sauce again.  Next time I'm going to try substituting low-fat evaporated milk like some reviewers did.

I thought this was a good recipe but I would make changes for the next time. I used the triangle parmesan cheese and grated used my food processor. This made the cheese heavier, more condensed for the 1/2 cup the recipe called for. I would use hand grater the next time for the cheese to keep it on the lighter, fluffier side. Also I used less salt 1/2 tsp and unsalted butter and it was still a tad on the salty side. I am going to use a lighter cream next time as well and 1/2 the butter to see how it works out.

I absolutely loved this recipe. My grandmother is from Northern Italy and as I child I was always disappointed by her Alfredo sauce, albeit I would never tell her that. In her recipe she used nutmeg and omitted the parsley. This difference is what really did it for me. I've made this twice now; with the only change being linguine instead of mostaccioli. I defiantly recommend this recipe.

EASY AND GOOD!! This was just what I was looking for last night for dinner. I only had 1/3 cup of the parmesan cheese on hand and did not have fresh parsley so used less of the dried flakes. By the time I was ready to pour it on the mostaccioli everything had blended well and it turned out very good. I also tossed chicken breasts, cut into bite sized pieces, in cajun seasoning and cooked until the pink was gone and added just before seving. My husband loved it. It is definitely a recipe that I will use again!

Delicious!! I made 1.5 times the amount of sauce along with the 16 oz. of penne. Perfect! Next time I'll add sundried tomatoes and some blackened chicken...my husband always wants some protein in his meals.

Yum!  I may never buy jarred alfredo again!  Made this with penne and doubled the sauce but kept the parsley at 1c.  Served with a spinach salad and garlic bread.

We loved this!!! Taste just like Olive Garden! A little runny but that's an easy fix. So easy too. My picky hubby and daughter both ate it all up. I think I was the only one who had any leftovers.

Very good and simple. I made a double batch of the sauce as suggested by another reviewer. It was thinner than I prefer. No additional salt (though I did add a little to my serving) since I used salted butter. I used Sargentos shredded parmesan and added in some steamed broccoli. Even my husband who usually doesn't prefer Alfredo said it was good and packed left-overs for lunch. Thanks!

I made this recipe tonight and it was excellent! I did double to sauce and reduced the salt slightly. Also, I added frozen cooked shrimp that I sauteed in minced garlic and olive oil. I highly recommend and it has an authentic alfredo taste.

I loved this!  I had to make a substitute for the heavy cream (1 c. lowfat cottage cheese w/ 3 T powdered milk, blender for 5 min).  Still, LOVE IT!  Would be good with chicken or veggies tossed in, and with a little more sauce.

This recipe is fantastic. I personally use a little more cheese and use half asiago and half parmesan. I have also tried making it and adding a small can of diced or crushed tomatoes at the end. It is great cooked anyway. The only downfall I have found is it does not make good leftovers, but there are almost never any.

I'm a VERY inexperienced cook, and I made this dish for my boyfriend with much success. He loved the taste, but I thought the sauce was missing a little something. (Since I'm new at this, it could've been my error). 
I sauteed some shrimp in olive oil with spices and added to the recipe, which was what made it fantastic. Without the shrimp (or chicken) it would seem a little bland I think. 
I also agree with letting the sauce sit for a few minutes, its too difficult to eat right away.

Careful with the amount of salt used in this recipe, especially if your using salted butter. the cheese has salt too! so one teaspoon (measured) is alot of salt for only one cup of cream. some people might be beginners in cooking and will add all that salt with there measuring spoon and will have a salty disaster! i would start with 1/2 teaspoon and that should be enough.

I liked this recipe but I doubled the sauce, added cooked chicken and cooked, crumbled bacon and it was a full meal. Very good. My kids can't seem to get enough of it.  If I were making it only for my hubby and myself I would also add some sliced mushrooms. Overall, good recipe.

I made this dish twice and i must say that some would probably say the sauce is to little for the recipe but what i have picked up from the two times i made it was that the longer you cook it the less the sauce becomes. So that would probably be the reason for why the sauce seemingly seems to little. But its a great dish, everyone at home loves it. It was exactly the dish i was looking for to begin with and its surely up there with the best of receipts.

This recipe was absolutely excellent! I used a lot more of the shredded parmesean than the recipe called for - do not do this! It made it so sickeningly rich. But I later made it exactly as it was called for and it was delicious!

The flavor of the sauce was good but I thought it was waaayyyy too runny! The sauce also clumped together a little when I added the parm. cheese (and I used fresh as some people recommended). I will try to make again though!

After mixing the sauce with the pasta, let it sit for a bit and it will thicken.  The dish was easy to make and came together quickly, but just really didn't have much taste.  It needs a lot more of the spices added to it, such as garlic, pepper, red pepper flakes and parmesan, as well as a protein such as shrimp or diced chicken and mushrooms.

Made this for hubby's friend who was helping us move some things into the house.  I decided to add some chicken to make this a little more hearty (these boys would have laughed at me if I just gave them pasta to eat).  I did add more cheese than the recipe called for, but it turned out delicious.  Will definately make again.  Thanks for the post.

My husband raved about this pasta, it has great flavor. I took some others advice and used 1/2 cup of parsley and just a pinch of salt. I also added 2 cooked and chopped chicken breasts. I used heavy cream rather than fat free evaporated milk and I will be making this again as soon as I work off all the calories.

I would give this ten stars if I could.  This was just fabulous.  I substituted Tony C's cajun seasoning in place of the salt, and I used about half the parsley the recipe called for.  My husband could not stop complimenting the dish; I think he thought it was a lot more complicated than it actually was!! :-)

As it stands we find this recipe too bland, but if you cut back on the salt and add smoked salmon (to taste) plus some fresh dill it makes an exceptional entree.   Hope this suggestion is of help to someone.   Sorry I had to rate it a 3, but as it is now that is all I feel I can give it.    Every recipe we try of course usually has to be adjusted to ones taste buds!!!

Mostaccioli is probably not the cut of pasta to use here, but the sauce is about the best...butter, cream and Parmasiano  with some pepper and the herbs of your choice?  Easy and delish.

The taste was pretty good, but I found that 1 cup of parsley was way too much. It overpowered the whole dish. If I were to make it again I think I would add fresh garlic cloves and maybe half the amount of parsley.

The flavor was good but the sauce was thin like water. I almost doubled the parmesan in order to thicken the sauce. Also used a different pasta shape.

I loved this! I am not usually a fan of Alfredo sauce but my husband and son are so I thought I would give it a try. It was delicious. Very light, not like the Alfredo in the jar. I also liked knowing what was in the sauce instead of all the junk in the jar.

My family loves this recipe. My son never liked alfredo until I made this recipe. I use it with chicken or venison steak. Delicious!

My son loves this!  His favorite is a variation that my daughter did.  After following the directions above, she puts everything in a casserole dish, sprinkles it with parmesan cheese, and then bakes it in a 350 degree oven for fifteen minutes.

This was pretty good. However, 1 cup of fresh parsley is way too much! Plus like other reviews, there was not enough sauce. Overall and with changes, I will make this again.

Was pretty darn good ! I took some chicken and marinated it with a garlic , sun dried pepper, and olive oil marinade. Then sauteed it in some olive oil and added it to the pasta. Will make again.

This is a delicious recipe that I'm now adding into a fairly regular rotation at my house. My three-year old exclaimed, "Mmm...yummy!" when she took her first bite of this.

It is very easy to make too. I used a large rigatoni pasta when I made it. I also doubled the sauce recipe because I added broccoli and some chopped up rotisserie chicken to make a quick and balanced dinner. 

I did not find it too salty, but I always use unsalted butter and fresh-grated parmesan, so that would reduce the salt significantly anyway. I didn't have any fresh parsley, so I eyeballed the use of some dried parsley and it was still very delicious. This one is a keeper!

I'm not too sure why some people think this is so great ... it was overbearingly salty, even though I cut A LOT of the salty things out ... also, it's WAY too peppery. It didn't make 8 servings at all, it was more like 2 and a half. Just being honest.

Very good. I didn't have fresh parsley so i used 1/4 cup of dried, but it was still a bit too much. I'll use less next time. I used fresh garlic and Locatelli cheese. Yummy! My kids loved it and asked for seconds (that rarely happens) Very quick and easy!

Excellent. I used some fresh garlic instead of garlic powder and much less parsley because I used dried. Added some shrimp, yummy. It came out absolutely wonderful - I doubled the recipe for my family and everyone loved it - even my picky 9-year-old nephew. Yum!

This sause was awesome!!! Just as good as you would get in a restaurant.  The only problem I had was the serving size.  I cut it down to 4 servings for my husband and I and that was not enough sause for 2 people.  Not sure what kind of servings they are talking about, but not the kind we use at my house!!  I also added fresh garlic and topped it off with grilled chicken breast!

This is a fairly basic alfredo sauce with a few additions. Having made alfredo many times & reading other reviews I had a couple comments. Many people said this recipe is too salty. I don't recall ever adding salt to alfredo before. There is already salt in the butter, unless you are using unsalted butter, so I would definitely recommend not adding extra salt or cutting it way back. If you subtract that this recipe goes well with grilled chicken, or shrimp as others have said. I like to saute some mushrooms in a little butter, garlic, & pepper and then add grilled chicken and penne pasta with the alfredo sauce. I also don't add parsley, but that's personal taste. Hope this helps!

EXCELLENT!  Our favorite alfredo dish was served at Alfredo's in the Italy Pavilion at Epcot.  This is very comparable to it.  I only cooked 1/2 lb. of pasta, as others suggested there wasn't enough sauce.  I used farfalle pasta as it was all I had on hand.  I took Roxanne J.R.'s idea and added chicken that I precooked.  Very good idea!  Thank you Kimber for sharing!

Great flavor! I followed others suggestions and went light on adding extra salt. Sauce is a little thin even after letting it sit. Next time might try adding a little extra Parmesan to see if it will thicken up a little more. Definitely a keeper though!

Delicious recipe! I used twists for my pasta in this dish and grilled some pre-marinated chicken (herb based marinade) cut it into bite sized cubes and tossed it in with the pasta and sauce. Very delicious! Could use a tad more cheese in the sauce, but that could just be my personal taste) so I just sprinkled extra Parmesan on top. Also, like other reviewers said, the sauce really does thicken up quite a bit as it starts to cool. Definitely a quick and easy dish to throw together and I will be making it again. Thanks for sharing!

I looooved this, but if I remember next time, I will use flat leaf parsley instead of curly because the curly parsley if crispier than the other. I'd also like to try this with fresh Parmesan instead of already grated. Other than that, perfect!

Love! Love! Love this recipe!  The only thing I change is adding more parmesan cheese if I want it thicker but I don't always do that.  Remember the suace will thicken as it sits. I have also used this sauce as a pizza sauce and I have even frozen it.  If you freeze it, DON'T defrost in microwave.  It must be reheated using warm water and then over the stove to prevent seperating.  SO GOOD!!

This was good, the only reason I didn't give it more...I would have used twice the sauce. The noodles recommended were difficult to find.  But this is a very adaptable recipe!!  Many things can be variated.  Thanks.

Taste was pretty good.  Other reviews were right - the sauce was only enough for about 3 servings, not 8.  Next time, I'll reduce the Parmesan cheese a bit too.

This was fantastic!  I did alter the recipe a bit:  used half and half rather than heavy cream and more parmesan cheese than the recipe called for.  It was a little greasy so next time I will try reducing the amount of butter to maybe 1/3 of a cup.  Served it with chicken.  MMMMM...oh so good!

Easy to make, a few ingredients, delicious.  I just wish the sauce was a little thicker.  Even when I let it sit for awhile, it never thickened up a lot.  I used half the amount of pasta and doubled up on the sauce.  Thanks.

This was absolutely delicious!! I read some other reviews and I didn't add any salt. I also added chicken and broccoli which made it super tasty and filling! I saw someone had used non-fat evaporated milk and it was delicious! It thickened up great and we will defiantly make this over and over!

A pretty good sauce, I might lighten up on the garlic powder & salt just a smidgen next time. A nice, thin sauce that I used on penne rigate. Perfect texture that that pasta. Thanks for the recipe!

Yummy! I needed a quick recipe when family decided to stay for dinner one night. I just cooked some seasoned, diced chicken breasts in olive oil and added mushrooms till they were tender. Threw it all together with the sauce and pasta and voila! The kids even asked for seconds!!

Really quite delicious. We added a pound of chicken. I diced it and cooked it in broth with garlic salt, pepper and normal salt. Really fantastic.

Excellent, we love it. We double the parm to make it thicker and add grilled chicken or steamed broccoli.

This is a good basic recipe that can be easily modified to cook's preference. I sautéed fresh garlic and 1/2 lb. fresh spinach in the butter, omitted the parsley, and followed the remainder of the recipe. It makes a nice, light alfredo sauce.

This alfredo sauce is excellent, thank youo for this recipe! Recipe doesn't need any modifications although I feel it's only enough for 2, maybe 3 servings.

I love alfredo sauce and have been looking for a recipe for a long time.  I'm happy to say I have finally found a keeper.  I was a litte skeptical at first because I expected the sauce to be a little bit thicker, but it was delicious!  I sauteed half a pound of shrimp in olive oil, white wine, garlic and pepper and added to the sauce.  It was a delicious meal that I will definitely be making again and again.

This was OK.  The flavor was great but it was way too runny.  I was hoping for a thicker sauce.

I fixed this recipe exactly as listed except I used penne pasta.  My family was VERY happy with it.  The sauce definitely thickens when allowed to rest once it is combined with the pasta.

This was amazing!  I made a few changes.  the first time I rated this I used chicken.  This time I used 1 lb shrimp.  I added 2t cornstarch to thicken.  I saute'd mushrooms and red bell pepper and added it to the sauce.  Every one raves!

I wanted more of a meal than side dish so I added a few items. About a cup of browned italian sausage, half cup diced pepparoni, half cup sliced black olives, and a half cup mushrooms. I didn't have any problem with thickness or too much salt, but the sauce did sit a few minutes at low heat while I was waiting for the pasta to cook. I probably only used half the parsley and it was fine. I used fettuccini noodles and it was fantastic.

this came out way too salty, and i would either cut the salt down to only 1/4tsp., or maybe cut it out all together. other than that, it was delicious -- very light but still filling. i'll definitely make it again.

This recipe was ok. I added more garlic powder and also some fresh garlic to liven up the flavor. Was not a huge fan of the large amount of parsley though--that's all I could taste when eating. Next time will reduce the amound of parsley added.

Pretty tasty. I followed the advice of others and tripled the sauce. I also added onion tops and grilled shrimp. It was good but the sauce did not thicken until the next day. May make again. I will probably add fresh garlic to the sauce.

This is a very good base to start with, then you can add to it to make it to your own liking, I start with shallots in a white wine reduced to 2tbs, then add my butter, cream, parma cheese and some 21/30 count shrimp that I steam in oldbay and I finish by adding some chopped fresh flat leaf or italian parsley. Top my plated dish with more parma. This is good with or without the shrimp. Also follow the recipes directions and DO NOT LET THIS SAUCE BOIL!!!.

AHH! This sounded so French to me, so I sauteed mushrooms in butter and fine white wine, which I added at the very end and mixed together. I followed advice from many posts, ie no salt, a little roasted chicken(leftover) instead of smoked salmon, and nutmeg.  Of course I always use garlic, freshly sauteed as well. It's gone, family loved it, so I get a sandwich for lunch tomorrow. It is not your thick alfredo sauce most of us are acustom to, more of a thin, rich(wine is nice) French sauce.

This was a very good recipe-- one of the best Alfredo recipes on this website! The texture of the pasta paired very well with the sauce and the sauce was creamy and delicious. I did halve the recommended parsley and still found that my dish was fairly inundated with it and I would definitely not add the full cup. I also added a bit extra cheese to aid with texture.

I wish I used a bigger pot or made more sauce, since it didn't look like anything in the photo. But it tasted real good. I prefer my pasta a bit tender than al dente. Wouldn't change a thing.

Loved it! The family loved it too. I doubled the recipe, and I used fresh herbs in the sauce including tulsi, oregano, and basil.  I also pureed about five, small, sweet peppers, and mixed it in the sauce.  Then I added a little sharp cheddar to the sauce as well. As someone else had suggested I was patient with the sauce so it would thicken slightly.

I make this exactly as the recipe instructs except for the mostaccioli noodles.  Very good!  We usually have it 1-2 times a month.  Easy and quick to make.  To add protein, I go through Chick-fil-A's drive thru on the way home and order their grilled chicken nuggets.  Then I add these nuggets on top.  Add a salad and dinner's done!

This Alfredo sauce tastes great. However while i was making the sauce i was super concerned at how runny it was. So I quickly made a slurry out of cornstarch to thicken it up. Some warning about how runny the sauce would be would have been nice.

This was good, but there was a lot of pasta and it was basically raw. Next time I would either add less, or cook it more.

this is an excellent recipe, i made it and it tasted great! However, it didn't make 8 servings for me, it would probably only feed 5, 6. (which is fine cuz i just had to feed 4) though here are some changes that i made 
• add a bunch more cheese. 
• I added dried up onion bits to the sause and let me tell you that was some top quality right there.
Dont be afraid to change up the original recipe however you choose. the fun part about this recipe is that its super flexible, sobdo whatever you need for it to fit your tastes!

This recipe was incredible. It was a bit on the rich side, but that was to be expected with the heavy cream sauce. I would recommend to  start with the sauce about 5-7 minutes before the noodles are done being cooked, as to not ruin the sauce. Besides that, it was excellent.

My only problem with this recipe is the sauce needs to be a little thicker.  It was a little on the thin side for us and I even let the sauce sit on the stove for a while to see if it would thicken up.  Also I didn't use the mostaccioli but used cheese tortellini and added grilled chicken in. The flavor is great and cheesy :)

Best recipe ever.  I use fettuccine/linguine noodles and I double the sauce to make sure there's enough sauce.  I added this in my two week menu rotation.  Totally awesome!!!!!

Nice recipe...although I think you should have added garlic two cloves - grated, which I did to give it just a little bit of umph!  It took the recipe to another level.  Also, I added a little bit more of flour to give it that creamer thicker sauce as a traditional Alfredo should be..Which depends on what region of Italy your from..Some regions make it very thin..other parts of sicily and parma make it much thicker. Overall easy to make and was delicious

Alfredo sauce was amazing, although I did not add any salt to recipe! My kids and husband loved it! My daughter said I should have cooked pasta a little longer but sauce was amazing and easy! Will def use again! Be forewarned, not a good leftover dish though as I went to eat some for lunch next day and had to add a little milk and fresh parmesan, then it was not too bad as leftover.

I did like it, except, if you're using fresh grated parmesan (as I did), you'll find it very salty, I will recomend to not add salt until the very end you may not even need it, and the parsley it proved to be too much, I would just add some on top when is being served, I will try it again, hopefully is better next time.

We did this with Linguini and Broccoli. It was super tasty. I saw from the picture that it may have not been a very thick sauce and that was my only complaint. If it were a little thicker, it would have coated the noodles a bit more and might have been a more present flavor. I will definately make it again with a little less noodles and a little more cheese to see if that helps. Thanks for sharing! My husband kept saying, "no really, it's really good." Makes me wonder what he means when he just says, "yeah, it's great."

Quick and easy to put together. I halved the Alfredo sauce and used it over a leftover serving of spaghetti, but if you can't find mostaccioli, use penne rigate, or any type of pasta. Used half-and-half ("coffee cream" in Canada), added some sliced mushrooms, and used some dried oregano since I didn't have fresh parsley. BTW, there's no way the amounts shown will make enough for 8 servings of sauce.

Yumm! I used dried parsley since I didn't have any fresh on hand. I would recommend penne pasta since the groves on it hold sauce better. This sauce was delicious and so easy to make! I'll definitely make it again! I can't wait to try it with variations of pasta shapes and maybe add some chicken, peas, and mushrooms. There are many possibilities!

I would make this again.  It had wonderful taste.  Although, I thought it needed more sauce, I used whole wheat penne noodles...gave it a different taste also.  I agree with some of the others, you have to cook it a bit longer or it is a runny mixture......although I must say, it was veryyyyy good

Thank you for the recipe. This was my first Alfredo sauce. I used only half of the butter that the recipe called for. I thought it worked out just fine that way.

I thought this was kind of bland. It didn't work out too well with mostaccioli. I had it for lunch the next day, and it was just a buttery mess!! It might work out better with fettucini...

I really liked this recipe.  It is simple and delicious!  The only thing I might change is the amount of butter.  Even a few Tbs less.  It was just a bit too greasy.  Forget trying to reheat this.  It just doesn't work... :(  Too bad, because it was really good and we had leftovers!

This pasta was very good. I added chopped up fresh spinach along with the parsley in an attemp to make it healthier. Next time I will put more parm than what is called for.

This was pretty good.  I do have some issues with it, though.  It doesn't make much sauce, for one.  I think it needs to make about 2/3 cup more alfredo sauce, at least.  Two, the sauce isn't very cheesy.  Instead of 1/2 cup parmesan, next time I will use about 1 cup mixed cheeses (like the Italian Blend that Kraft makes).  Other than than, the flavor is very good.

Great sauce, but I agree, not enough! I added some extra spices on the notes of others, garlic powder, a few red pepper flakes, a dash of chili powder and italian seasoning mix and I substituted half & half for the cream. Also added sauteed mushrooms to the top, yummy.

My 7 year old son gave me a thumbs up and a "D-licious" when he took the first bite of this!  The rest of the fam liked it lots too.  I left off the salt and added minced garlic and about 2T cream cheese, as others suggested, and tossed with steamed broccoli, with grilled chicken on the side (marinaded in italian dressing). ABSOLUTELY will be making this again & again!!!

Used fresh garlic minced instead of garlic powder...didn't use salt and added 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper to give it a little kick. Very easy to make and had a really good taste. Add chicken to make a great meal!!! Second time we made it...added too much parsley and a little more cheese.

Was pretty good! I added bacon like in the tortellini voldostano, and i can't imagine it would have had as much flavor if I hadn't.

This got good reviews from my family.  Everyone loved it.  I added some kielbasa that I had fried up and mixed everything together before serving.

I thought this was a 3 star recipe but my husband thout is deserves a 5. I don't care for a gritty sauce but he does. Other than that it was good.

This was good. My 2 year old loved it. The sauce is very rich - not healthy, but tasty. Very easy to make.

This was wonderful.  I took the advice of another review and used fat free evap milk instead of the heavy cream.  I also used a bit more parmesan. I added a few handfulls of pre-cooked chicken. I thought it did make a bit more pasta then sauce.  Yummy!

It tasted good, but came out a little gritty like some of the other reviews.  It might have been the cheese that i used.

I added more garlic salt to this dish and added some grilled chicken pieces.  I topped it off with some paprika.  My kids loved it!

Made the recipe exactly as written, except used only 1/2 the pasta since we prefer more sauce.  However, it was bland.  Could use something extra for more flavor.

I made this last, although I did add a bunch of stuff. I added one chopped zuchinni, a handful of shredded carrots, about 1/2 a pound of chopped asparagus, and a pound of baked chopped chicken. I also used farafelle pasta. It turned out absolutely wonderful. It is nice enough to serve for guests and easy enough to make on a regular basis. Great sauce recipe!

I used penne, dried parsley and less salt, so I didn't encounter the salt issue othres have mentioned.  This is a slightly thinner Alfredo than a restaurant sauce-l-let it set for a few minutes to thicken.  However, it was really good and my 2 year-old ate 3 bowls of it, which is high praise indeed!

This recipe was very quick and easy.  I used whole wheat penne pasta for a healthier choice, which was so good, nobody even knew that it wasn't regular pasta.  Also I added about two cups crushed fresh tomatoes.  We have too many tomatoes growing in the garden so I peeled them and crushed them with a potato masher in a pyrex measuring cup.  Since there was more content, I did add salt and garlic powder to taste. I definitely will be making this again.  For me it made two dinner servings the first night and I had leftovers for lunch three times also.
