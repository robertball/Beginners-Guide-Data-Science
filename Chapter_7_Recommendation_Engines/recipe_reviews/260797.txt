I thought the cake turned out well; however, I did make adjustments to the recipe. 
I used Espresso powder, about two rounded tablespoons, instead of the pre-made coffee. To compensate for the liquid, I used 1/2 cup of half and half with 1/2 cup of water. 
I used Hershey’s Special Dark Cocoa powder. So, I increased the sugar by 1/2 cup because of the strong cocoa and Espresso powder. 
I also added about 1/2 cup of white chocolate chips to the batter at the end. 
Ovens vary, so I checked the cake at 60 minutes. However, it needed an additional 20 minutes.  
I would say check very closely as the bake time ends. Because the cake is already dark any extra time in the oven can easily turn yummy to a slightly burned taste. 
Mine could have come out about 3-4 minutes sooner. It was still moist, but I always like a pound cake to come out of the oven a little bit early. That keeps the top slightly sticking but ensures a moist result. 
This cake is great alone because of the added white chocolate chips. It would also be good with white or milk or both kinds of chips warmed with cream and drizzled over the top when cooled completely. 
I only gave it four stars because it’s not as moist as a regular Cream cheese pound cake. However, I will definitely make it again. It’s still a very good pound cake.

Wonderful flavor. Nice and Moist. The only thing I did differently was to grease and sugar my pan. That gives the cake a nice sugar crunch crust. My family enjoyed this cake.
