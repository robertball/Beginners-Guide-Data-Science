Thanks Robyn for another winner.  I would follow your recipes anywhere!  One warning to cooks.  I think some folks made this using the smaller box of Sugar free instant pudding.  It will only work and be a wonderful consistancy if you use the large box of instant pudding.  I love pumpkin and thought this was wonderful even thought I usually do not like instant pudding.  I used fat free milk and it turned out great!

It is a great easy, delicious recipe, I added 8ounces of fat free, sugar free cool whip, folded it in at the end, which makes it lighter and a prettier look.

Yes! What a great, guilt-free treat! I used one package (not two...) of the pudding just as the recipe directs.  I used half "Hood Calorie-Countown Milk," which is a reduced fat and low carbohydrate milk, and half full-fat half-and-half.   So we've got sugar-free, a fruit (or vegetable), and dairy. That means you're eating a fabulous dessert that's actually good for you! (Ok, let's not nitpick about the boxed pudding) Dieters, those who need to watch carbs (sugar) or fat intake, or those who just want to eat a little healthier, rejoice! This is excellent! Tastes like a lighter, less sweet, pudding version of pumpkin pie. Hubs even liked it and he doesn't care for anything pumpkin.  This would be a great addition (alongside traditional pumpkin pie) to your Thanksgiving table so no one with the above-mentioned dietary restrictions is left out. And for those who just want a delicious and satisfying dessert.

This is wonderful.  I love pumpkin and am a diabetic, so most pumpkin reipes are loaded with carbs and fat.  I loved it.

This recipe could not have been any easier.  I love pumpkin and am always thinking of new ways to serve it.  I used 2 (3.4 oz) boxes of french vanilla pudding (not sugar-free) and 1/2 of a 29 oz can of pumpkin.  I added close to 1 Tbls of pumpkin pie spice and used 2 cups of 2% milk since I didn't have the evaporated or skim.  This tastes just like a pumpkin pie...of course it's crustless and has a different texture.  Can't wait to try this out on my son.  Thanks for sharing.

Not being able to eat sugar and keeping a low carb diet really gets difficult-especially when you want dessert!  This recipe is absolutely fabulous-it tastes exactly like pumpkin pie-I couldn't believe my taste buds!  Congrats Robyn-I am passing this one on to all my other friends with diabetes...you make it very easy to convince my naughty boyfriend to eat less sugar he he he

This was delicious!  All my relatives and husband loved this wonderful dessert!  We followed the same directions, except using a LARGE box of pudding mix as suggested by another reviewer and using premade pumpkin pie filling.  We topped it with sugar free topping and served it in wine glasses.  Very tasty!

I fed this to my family tonight. It was wonderful! We thoroughly enjoyed it. I did end up using a 5 oz box of sugar-free vanilla pudding and an entire 12 oz can of evaporated milk, along with 4 oz of water. My mother in law is celiac and diabetic so this was fantastic. We will make frequently. Delicious. Thanks so much for the awesome recipe!

This is DELICIOUS!  This recipe is very basic, and although it doesn't need to be, I doctored it up quite a bit. I used a large box of Instant Pudding and used 2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg and 1/8 tsp allspice because I didn't have any pumpkin pie spice. I like to layer my parfait, so I crushed up vanilla wafers and pecans and layered it with Redi Whip in a goblet!  I layered wafers first, then this pumpkin pudding, pecans and then Redi Whip.  I repeated this layering once more and topped with a sprinkling of wafers and pecans. This recipe made 4 large goblets filled 1/3 of the way and 5 cordials which I served to all of the children at our get together.  It was a huge hit, especially with the kids who exclaimed enthusiastically how much they LOVE pumpkin pie, and this was even better!  I will be adding this to my recipe book and sharing it with lots of my friends!

I made this for my hubby who is diabetic. I used 2 packages of Jello Sugar Free Cheesecake Flavored Pudding and used the entire 15 oz can of pumpkin and 12 oz can of evaporated milk instead of one cup of each.  I also added an extra cup of milk. I don't have pumpkin pie spice so I used 2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg and 1/8 tsp allspice.  This set up great and I didn't notice an after taste.  Good stuff!

The best thing about this recipe is that it's low in fat.  I let it chill in the fridge overnight and it was soupy the next morning.  I added some more vanilla pudding mix and it thickened right up and tasted ok. Also, it was a little too spicy for my taste.  I think next time I will add a little less of the pumpkin pie spice.

I love anything pumpkin and am trying to cut back on sugar so I decided to try this. I "believe there is a mis-print on the ingredients given though." It calls for a 1oz package, which doesn't exist.  Pudding comes in 3.8 oz packages as their smallest. To stick with the recipe I tried to only use 1 oz of the package and got pumpkin milk. So, I went by what I thought and used the whole package. Once, I added that and beat it, it tasted and had the consistency of uncooked pumpkin pie filling, ready for a pie. It would probably have been easier to beat the 3.8 oz box of pudding with both the milks and then fold in the pumpkin and pumpkin pie spice. In order for this to taste like a parfait it would need some type of whipped topping folded into it though, as another reviewer suggested.

This dessert is amazing! So simple and delicious! You can make this sugar free and no one will be able to tell the difference. We topped ours with RediWhip...next time might try sprinkling chopped pecans, crushed graham crackers or ginger cookie. Very good recipe for a quick and yummy dessert.

GREAT low fat treat for those who are watching their weight and sugar intake. I made this as the recipe stated but next time, I'd like to try to make this more as a "mousse" and fold in FF whipped topping instead of the skim milk. This would be good made into a frozen ice pop, too, I bet.

I thought this recipe was very good--but then again, I am a huge pumpkin fan.  I did follow the reviews of others and used the LARGE box of Jell-o instant vanilla pudding.  Next time I plan to try the french vanilla pudding---yum!  I topped it off with some whipped cream and crumbled graham crackers--a nice fall treat.  Thank you!

This is so easy and so quick.  My husband licked the bowl and being as he doesn't like pumpkin, that was BIG!  Sets up nicely in the fridge and truly is delicious.  I added 1/2 teaspoon more of the spice and also, used cream in place of the skim milk.  It's a keeper

I love this recipe but instead of vanilla pudding, I use butterscotch pudding and layer it in parfait glasses with cool whip and crumbled ginger snaps for a crust.  My whole family loves it.

I have tried to make this type sugarfree recipe before and it was horrible.  This was a pleasant suprise!  Very good, doesn't taste sugar free.  I didn't use the evaporated skim milk, only one cup of skim milk and it turned out very good, will definately make again.

I almost never give a bad review, but this REALLY was really bad. It was runny. It never did set. It was no where near sweet enough. It also didn't have enough spice. Maybe a second box of pudding would have made the difference in both sweetness and the problem setting.

Guilt free, perhaps, but that is the most positive thing that I can say about this recipe.  I host a dessert buffet at Thanksgiving and served this parfait in mini cups.  Not one person had more than one or two bites.  I did not care for the flavor or the consistency.  I guess I would just prefer an occasional indulgence than a sugar free/low fat creation.

I'll have to agree that there really is an aftertaste and I can't figure out why because I make fat free/sugar free chocolate pudding all the time with no problems. That seems to be the only complaint I have with this recipe, other than the fact that I only used half the amount of liquid and it came out perfectly. I suggest trying this with regular instant pudding. Don't get me wrong, I'm eating it and it's not bad, but I'm getting an almost bitter taste in the end.

Very good!  Definitely use the large size pudding box.  I am not that crazy about the 'after taste' or difficulty in beating the lumps out of sugar-free puddings, so I think I will use regular next time.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very yummy. I only rate it four stars because the spice was a little much. When I make it again I will cut back a wee bit.

This was really tasty but I have to admit that I couldn't just put it in a cup and call it done....I made a cookie crust (no bake) in a 9 inch pie plate and poured the mixture into that. Then chilled overnight. I found that it needed just a bit more pumpkin pie spice for flavor, but hey, if you love pumpkin pie...this is a recipe for you.

Excellent!  I made this recipe with the large size pudding, and followed the rest of the recipe exactly as stated.  I'm a diabetic, and I've been watching my diet closely.  This was an absolute guiltless treat.  It's so easy, and the flavor is amazing. Strongly recommended.

I was expecting this to be taste like pumpkin pie and it just didn't....more like vanilla pudding with pumpkin in it. It probably would have been better if I didn't have expectations.

I made this for guests and everyone loved it.  I did take another reviewer's advice and used the large box of pudding mix.  I also used 1 1/2 teaspons of pumpkin pie spice.  I topped it with a little coolwhip sprinkled lightly with cinnamon,  finely ground ginger snaps and chopped, toasted pecans.  It was a nice presention and so delicious.  This is a keeper!

This one is great.  The only tweak I did was instead of the evaporated milk, I used cool whip.  Don't even attempt to mix this with a mixer; it's too thick.  Just mix with a spoon thoroughly.  My husband LOVED it!

I doubled the recipe and let it cool in a trifle dish, then served it with an ice cream scooper in parfait cups with whipped cream, cinnamon and pumpkin spiced marshmallows on top :-) my boys loved it and me too! I bet adding some crumbs to the bottom would also be good, like pie crumbs or graham cracker ones

This is such an awesome recipe! It tastes just like pumpkin pie in pudding form. I noticed it doesn't even have added sugar, and was surprised at how tasty it was (to be low- calorie). I used canned pumpkin and 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp. nutmeg, 1/4 SCANT tsp. ginger, and 1/8 tsp. cloves for the pumpkin pie spice. If you use the full 1/4 tsp ginger, you will be able to taste the bite. It was great with a raspberry and some whipped cream on top or mixed in. Great for Thanksgiving, company, or just anytime because most everyone likes it!

It was pretty good. I didn't really think it tasted like pumpkin pie without the crust as some have mentioned, but there are many ways to make pumpkin pie and I can imagine there are pies that might taste quite similar.

GREAT no sugar/flour dessert option.  I ended up just using the whole can of pumpkin and evaporated milk, added a little allspice and additional pumpkin pie spice.  I put it in one big casserole dish and serve out 3/4 cup servings with 2 tbsp of sugar free cool whip on top.  Makes a lot! Taste just like pumpkin pie filling minus all the sugar and calories!  Thanks for a great holiday dessert recipe!

OMG This was awesome, I did have to make a change. I used the 5oz. pkg, of Jello sugar free pudding and replaced the evaporated skim milk with an 8oz. container of Cool Whip Fat Free which I folded in after the other ingredients were mixed. I had those things on hand and they worked out GREAT. Served it in a wine glass, with a dallop of FF whipped topping and sprinkled some spiced waffer cookies that I put in a food processor, so it was nice and fine. Finished it off with half a spiced waffer cookie on top of the whipped topping. Everyone loved it and I think this might replace the pumpkin pie at Thanksgiving.

I was looking for a way to use up a big 'ol can of pumpkin that I'd had in my cupboard forever. This stuff was so tasty, that it'll be making a regular appearance in my lunch box. It's nice and spicy, and rich. I'm not diabetic, but I am trying to lose weight and this is a nice way to splurge without goin' overboard. For what it is, I give it 4 stars. Thanks!

it was good. not great. swapped out the milk for soy, perhaps that was its blunder.  also had to add a whoooole bunch more spice for taste.  at least 2-3 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice, as well as 2 teaspoons of cinnamon, and a little bit of nutmeg. overall pretty good, and you can't beat it being so low calorie, which is what i was after. better alternative than chocolate cake! :)

DELICIOUS!  There's just two of us, so I froze the leftovers in silicone cube trays and once they were frozen, popped them into a freezer bag.  They thaw out nicely in the fridge (all day) and you'd never know it had been frozen!

Quick, easy, and delicious.  Taste just like pumpkin pie minus the extra calories the crust has.  This was the first dessert to

This turned out great! Used a large box sugar free vanilla pudding, almond milk instead of skim milk, I added cool whip after mixing the other ingredients and since I don’t have a problem with sugar crumbled ginger snaps in each dish under the mixture. Was light and delicious.

My boyfriend is diabetic and this was our pumpkin pie substitute for Thanksgiving.  Super fast and easy, tastes similar to pumpkin custard without the pie crust.  Pretty good!

These parfaits are AMAZING!! I can't wait to make them again. I didn't use sugar free pudding (I used regular) and I added layers of graham cracker (one box, blended for 30 seconds) so it was like a graham cracker/pumpkin layered parfait. Ever since I had one on Thanksgiving I always crave it.

I added 2 scoops of vanilla bean protein powder and it makes it even more delicious - great snack for after the gym.

Added the cool whip as some suggested and could not be more pleased with such an easy, tasty, and healthy choice.

This is a great dessert for a holiday dinner if you are looking for a way to cut calories here and there. It tastes like pumpkin pie without the carb-heavy crust. Note: serving size is only 4 ounces, looks small in the cup.  Plan for the right serving dishes.

After all the reviews I knew to use the large box of instant pudding (I used sugar free); since I was making this for people who are using limited dairy I mixed with 1 cup of fat free milk and 1 cup Cool Whip (no evaporated milk) and pumpkin purée. I also used the full amount of pumpkin pie spice and it wasn't overwhelming at all. I put in parfait glasses and topped with graham cracker crumbs. Nice dessert that keeps well within diet!

Disappointed with this. Flavor was good, but it never did set up, remained quite runny. I would not make this again.

Made this for Turkey Day 2014 for my dad who is diabetic but still loves his desserts. Super easy! I put everything together for the pumpkin pie pudding when I got there and layered into parfait glasses with graham crackers and Cool Whip. They were ready by the time he was ready for dessert and he LOVED them! Thank you and great recipe!

Good in a pinch!  Ran short on ingredients, but used box of pumpkin pie pudding, cup of pumpkin puree and 2 cups of 2% milk and topped with whipped cream.  Didn't set up but we ate it so quick maybe we just didn't give it time!  Yum!

This is super easy, fast and amazing! I make lots and refrigerate it and take it to work for a sweet snack.  It's also a kick for parties in a pretty wine glass with a dab of whip cream on top.  To die for!

Really more of a 3 star for flavor but I used a large box of pudding (Ithink it was 1.5 oz) and the end result had a really strong sugar substitute flavor.  It did sit up well and it was easy. Not sure that a small box of pudding would make that much of a difference on getting rid of that flavor or not.  Would try it with a regular box pf pudding but then its not so healthy and I feel like I should just have a real piece of pie if I;m going to blow my calories for the day you know?

Very good.  I use 1 cup whipping cream and 1 cup water in place of the milk called for.  I also use sugar-free pudding mix since my husband is a diabetic and does not need the extra carbs.
