This recipe was just ok.  I cooked it for St Patty's day. I think I got too much salt in it.  It had an interesting flavor, but was not a real hit.  I doubt I'll ever fix it again.  The cabbage was too overcooked and absorbed too much of the spices and salt.  We did not have potatoes, so did not make gravy.  Gravy may have enhanced the dish.  The chicken itself had a pretty pleasant taste and I used the leftover chicken the next day for a sandwich, but couldn't face the "mooshy" veggies again.

Very tender chicken. I cooked on low for 10 hrs. Very liquidy! We did not make the gravy. I would recommend making it because it should add some thickness to the meal.

I made it with a sliced onion instead of the cabbage (didn't have any on hand) and served it over rice.

The whole family loved it!  (And we usually don't ever agree on food!)

I was very disappointed in this recipe. The results were very bland. I didn't use all of the water, so it wasn't as soupy as some others found it to be, but no one in my family would eat it. I also have to say that, although we love cabbage, I will never cook it in a slow cooker again- the smell was awful

This recipe should've been listed under "Soups".  There was so much juice in this dish it would've been wasteful to make it all into gravey.  The Cabbage and Carrots came out better than the chicken did.  I'm sad to say that I was a little disappointed, but in the end this recipe really does make a good soup (and I'm not trying to be sarcastic).

Personally I would not have even given this 3 stars had it not been for the fact that my husband sorta liked it.  I did not care for this at all.  It was very bland and not at all what I had been expecting.  I will not be making this one again.

We all thought this was great!  The greek seasoning was wonderful, not at all bland!  I don't know how anyone could call this bland, unless they ommited that!!  I drained of the liquid and made the gravy from it and it was wonderful!  This one is a keeper!

I made this last night for my family, but used chicken thigh's (bone out) and cooked them from frozen.  I was surprised to find that the chicken was done with in three hours, but I just took it out and let the carrots continue to cook.  I also left the cabbage out so that it did not get too soft and soggy (not saying that it would, but I assumed that it would after eight hours off cooking).  After about 7 hours the carrots were a good enough texture to eat, so I then took them out.  I chopped up the chicken and returned it to the crock pot, then added the cabbage and let it all cook another hour.  The cabbage wasn't entirely done, but it was better than pure mush for sure!  I am giving this recipe 5 stars because everyone who ate it (three adults and two small children) said it was really good!  We ate it served over brown rice, and only had to add just a tiny bit of salt.  I would definitely make this again.

I liked this recipe a lot. The fam on the other hand was not so much of a fan. I ended up adding more spices as it needed salt really bad. I made the gravy and it turned out fabulous served over mashed potatoes. I would make this again and change up the spices a little bit.

My husband and I thought this dish had no flavor, my chicken actually came out very dry, whereas usually chicken in the slow cooker is very tender and juicy, and I couldn't get the gravy to cook right, so the whole meal was just a dissapointment.

I had such high hopes, but the chicken was extremely dry, and not a very pleasant taste.

First off, of those complaining this was too bland, just add some more spices, simple. without the noodles, which I loved really cause I'm trying to stay away from carbs and was wondering with cold weather coming how i'd get my chicken soup. Anyways I thought it was really tasty, the chicken was falling apart and cabbage and carrots are two of my favorite vegetables. So think of it maybe like the chicken version of pot roast.

I liked it, the chicken was quite tender. However, it should be listed as a soup and had I known how liquidy it would be, I would have chopped the chicken before cooking. I did not make the gravy, but I did add 2 TBSP corn starch to the crockpot. Still very soupy. Flavor somewhat bland, but that's my fault, I didn't have any poultry or greek seasoning.

Turned out well for me. Used chicken stock in place of water. Added garlic, onion and mushrooms.  And chopped the chicken before putting in crock pot.

I made this but I saw it being bland so I made a sauce with browning bacon the stock from crockpot, lemon, tap salt and tbsp of red pepper flakes, simmered down then added corn starch to thicken.  Made it very good without taking flavor from chicken and veggies!

Very similar to chicken & dumplings, minus the dumplings.  We loved the flavor.  I didn't have 2 of the seasonings that the recipe called for (Poultry seasoning & Greek seasoning) so I googled how to mix my own with some stuff I *DID* have in the house.  Came out great!

My family loves this recipe, in fact it is one of my kids' favorites!  The only change I make is to use less water, approximately half-covered.  I serve this is couscous.
