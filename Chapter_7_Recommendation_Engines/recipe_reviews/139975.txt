This was pretty good. Although I hate to see people say they added stuff to a recipe on here, I did the same. I added one clove of crushed garlic to the butter before I fried the chops, and added julienned red peppers about 2 minutes before I added the mushrooms.  The sauce was perfectly seasoned with just the salt.   Note that, if you're like me and have double servings of pasta, you might want to increase the sauce ingredients by  25 - 50%. It was really good though. Will make it again.

Added garlic and some chopped onions to the mushrooms and used extra virgin olive oil instead of butter.  Nice rich flavor.  My husband and I really enjoyed the sharp cheese flavor, too.

I'm sorry but this was not good.  My family loves blue cheese so we gave this a try, but unfortunately we did not care for it at all.

The flavor and idea of this is really good. I think next time I'll add nutmeg or something... a little "something." I ended up doing this one weird. I used pork loin in strips, followed the rest of the recipe, but just as I was putting the pasta in to boil, we realized we had more kids in the house than we thought. So the pasta to sauce ratio wasn't quite right, I would want to have it saucier next time. I'll make it again, though. Thanks!

We enjoyed this recipe.  The flavor was really good, but I did do as others suggested and added 1 clove of minced garlic as I sauteed the mushrooms.  Our pork was a bit dry, but that was because my husband didn't have the heat up high enough to sear it at the beginning.

I thought this was quite good.  I used really thick-cut boneless chops, and seared them in the butter over med-high heat.  That left some nice browned bits on the bottom of the pan, which I scraped up and incorporated when I added the broth.  I used baby 'bellas instead of plain white mushrooms.  Very tasty, although I would have liked to add a sprinkling of something green (parsley maybe?) to make presentation prettier.  However, for the first time out, I didn't want to alter the original recipe a whole lot.  This one is going in my keepers book....thanks for sharing!

I really liked this recipe, but I think it would be even better with the addition of a splash of wine in the sauce. I also think this would be really good over rice. 
Alas, I won't get to try those suggestions. Even though my hubs likes blue cheese, he hated this recipe, and has threatened to make his beefaroni if I ever make it again. I'm not taking any chances!

This is a great dish.  I didn't find the flavor of the blue cheese to be overpowering and probably would have preferred to use a little more.

It was nice. I used pork cutlets and sweet potato gnocchi. Next time I would add less blue cheese, too strong of a flavor for me.

Sauce was tasty but dish is bland looking and as foodies we do eat with our eyes too. I did add some finely diced onions and flambed the pork loin in a shot of sherry to give it that little bit extra. might try adding some julienne peppers next time. grate way to use up old stilton.

I used a different cut of pork, because that’s what I had. The taste was fine, however, it was bland and the flavors didn’t meld and the sauce stayed thin and cloudy. If I try it again I will definitely change things. I used everything as written other than the cut of pork and the salt as I don’t use salt.

After reading the reviews, I added 1 clove of garlic, more blue cheese and made more sauce.  Instead of using water with the cornstarch, I used chicken broth.  The dish was tasty but my hubs and I agreed there was something missing.  Will try it next time with some wine or madeira or sherry.

Unfortunately my dh  hates blue cheese so I made changes and although we both enjoyed the dinner it is difficult to rate. I  added garlic and spinach as well. Instead of blue cheese I used a good quality Parmesan. It really was very tasty and would make it again. I love blue cheese so may try it as written when cooking for other blue cheese fans
