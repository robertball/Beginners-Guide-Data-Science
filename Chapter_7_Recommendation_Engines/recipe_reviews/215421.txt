These were great and I only changed a few things.  For one, when it comes to the crescents I sprinkled them with sugar before baking.  To make the whipped cream the recipe calls for: with a hand mixer combine 1 c. heavy cream, 1/4 c. powdered sugar, and a splash of vanilla.  Beat until it's as thin/thick as you like.  Then I took about half of it and folded it into the pudding I had already made and had chilling in the fridge.  I then use the rest of the whipped cream for garnish as the recipe states.  These were delicious!

These were pretty good, but I had a hard time with the crescents for some reason, they didn't come out like perfect little triangles like in the photo hehe. They ended up being kind of big so I didn't stack them like in the photo either. I sprinkled the crescents with sugar before cooking and I just sued cool whip, they were a hit! Very easy to assemble because I had a lot of other stuff to make.

This was a relatively easy dessert and it tasted great. Getting the crescent rolls to make perfect triangles was a little work. My kids loved constructing them and enjoyed eating them. :)  Great recipe to make with older children. We will make again.
