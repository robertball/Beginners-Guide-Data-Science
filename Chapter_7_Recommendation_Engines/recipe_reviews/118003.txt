This was delicious! My husband LOVED this! I really liked it too, but my only complaint is that it had too much of an egg flavor to it. Next time I make this, I'll try not to coat the chicken so thick. Other than that, it was very good. I didn't have to change a thing. It was so easy too! I used tablespoons of flour, not teaspoons. I highly recommend this recipe to anyone!

Wow!  This recipe is UNBELIEVABLE!  Keep in mind this recipe only serves 2 so I doubled it up to feed my family.  I was a little skeptical with the measurements and worried that doubling it up may not allow the sauce to thicken right, but it turned out PERFECT!  I did not use apple juice but used chicken broth instead.  I also added 4 cloves of minced garlic and shallots while browning the chicken.  I changed up the breading a bit to suit my families tastes and added italian breadcrumbs, crushed red peppers and Garli Garni (my favorite garlic seasoning!) to the mix.  I added an extra splash or two of lemon at the end.  This was OUTSTANDING!  I contemplated tripling the sauce and serving it over white rice as a side dish, however, I don't think this sauce would be good served over rice or pasta.  It's just perfect over chicken and I also bet it would be great on pork.  Thank you for the fabulous recipe!  This is one of my all time favorites from this site!

Wow! A friend gave me a big bag of lemons and it was chicken night so I looked up Lemon chicken and this popped up. I was hoping it would be good after all the great reviews , but wasn't expecting it to be plate licking good! I made the sauce exactly as written except used garlic butter in place of regular butter , chicken I made the way I always make fried , throw the chicken in seasoned flour, then milk (instead of eggs to save calories) and then into bread crumbs and it makes a nice thick crust on the chicken. Omg the sauce , I could have honestly made chicken any way and the sauce would have still made it delicious. I marinated the chicken in lemon juice and garlic for a few hours and doubled the lemon in the sauce and it was just lemony enough. My husband was making Mmmmm noises all through dinner, and we fought over the last few drops of the sauce. If I wasn't trying to watch my weight this would be a regular in my house, but I'll definitely have to sneak it in once a month! Also the ingredients say 5 teaspoons of flour , but it's very obviously supposed to say 5 tablespoons

Love this recipe! I call it my signature dish :) I started replacing the chicken broth with bouillon cubes which I think adds a little extra flavor.

I made this recipe last weekend and have been telling everyone I know about it.  It was DELICIOUS!  I did follow the advice of other people and substituted the juice for wine and added fresh minced garlic and shallots.  De-li-cious!  I'll be definitely making this again.

I loved this recipe, and so did the rest of my family. I didn't have any apple juice, so I substituted chicken broth mixed with about an 1/8 cup of marsala wine. The wine gave it just the right flavor. My only complaint is I didn't have any leftovers :)

What a great recipe without ANY changes.  I tripled the recipe for our family ... 3 teenagers and my husband and I.  Apparently no one was very hungry and started with small portions.  It didn't take long for the rest to disappear followed by permission to make it again and often.  Next time I'll place it on my best platter and adorn it with parsley sprigs to make it look like it tastes ... very gourmet!  I made a great Quinoa salad with it and roasted asparagus with olive oil, salt, pepper and parmasean cheese.  Nutritious and delicious!

I made this for dinner and my husband loved it. I followed the recipe almost to the t.  I doubled the sauce added more lemon, added lemon pepper and mushrooms to the sauce.  It did take longer then 3-5 minutes to cook the chicken. It was realy good and lemony.

I made this recipe as stated and found the sauce was very good but had only a mild lemon flavor.  I would suggest added more lemon if you prefer a stronger lemon taste.  I put the chicken back into the sauce at the end and simmered for 5 minutes instead of just pouring the sauce over the chicken. A bit of a messy dish to prepare but worth it.

Cooked this for a pretty fussy crowd including tweens and teens and all loved it (including me).  Used white wine instead of apple juice, and didn't add butter into the sauce but all else per recipe. Excellent.

This is a delicious recipe with just a few modifications. I think it is a typo that they list 5 teaspoons of flour in the list of ingredients. You definitely will need 5 tablespoons. Also, do substitute white wine for the apple juice. Juice makes the sauce too sweet, while the wine just enhances the lemon flavor of the sauce. I disagree that this recipe makes only 2 servings. I bought two breast halves totaling one pound. I cut them into a total of five pieces and prepared as instructed. My husband and I each had one piece with two side dishes and there is plenty left over for another night's meal.

YUM !!   Used a little more lemon, but followed the recipe exactly.    When cooking any type of cutlet, I will also brown and sear chicken in pan, but place chicken on a brown paper bag and put in microwave for 1 - 2 minutes.    Juicy beyond belief.....  Thanks for the recipe. I will use this one again and again.

Amazing! The chicken had a nice brown crust that had almost a nutty flavor to it. Make sure you keep the left over crust mixture on hand in case you have a problem with it flaking off like I did. The pan sauce was excellent!

Chicken was excellent but this is the way I make it anyway.  Used wine instead of apple juice didn't think it would make that much of a difference.  Sauce would not thicken and taste horrible.

Fabulous!  I was tempted to add or substitute white wine for the apple juice, but that would have changed the flavor altogether.  The tinge of sweetness from the apple juice is what made it so distinctly unique.

I assume by now someone has noted the typo showing that the ingredients call for 5 teaspoons of flour when it should say 5 TABLESPOONS.

Awesome !  The only changes I did were to use only the egg whites and  "I can't believe it's not butter" instead of real butter.  I was really impressed with this recipe, as was my family !  Very tasty lemon sauce, perfect tang !  Thank you !!

More like 3.5 in my opinion.  Make sure that you know the ingedients for flour is wrong.  It's not 5 teaspoons, but 5 tablespoons.

Very good. My husband and I thought it was wonderful. I listened to the other reviews and did not use apple juice. I used white wine and chicken broth instead. Tasty indeed!

I'm giving 5 stars because I really, really like this recipe - with the following changes.
Made for 6 people, I used 1 1/2 lbs chicken tenderloin, 1/2 c flour, 1/2 c cheese, 3/4 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp pepper, 1 T oil, 1 c broth, 1/2 c white wine, 3 T lemon juice.
I combined the dry ingredients, dredged the chicken (skipped the pounding and the eggs), and browned it in oil.  Then I put chicken in a 9x13" pan; mixed the broth with the leftover flour mixture, added it to the skillet with the wine and juice, and cooked to thicken.  Poured the sauce over the chicken and baked until tender.

To serve, I sauteed chopped spinach with fresh basil and garlic and tossed with cooked noodles, and spooned chicken and sauce over the noodles.  It beats anything I've had at the Olive Garden.

Sorry this review is so long.  We all liked this a LOT.

Pretty good! I didn't pound the chicken, so it took longer to to cook.I will do that next time. Would have been more appetizing with some lemon slices on top.

This was really good.  I only used one egg & was able to bread 4 chicken breast halves.  I served it with rice & green beans & a nice Pinot Grigio.  Would be good with mashed potatoes, too.  I would even make just the chicken without the gravy.

My family loved this!  I've also made if for a party, where I prepared and cooked the chicken ahead of time and later prepared the sauce.  I poured the sauce over the chicken, in a baking dish, and warmed it in the oven prior to serving.  It was easy and my quests loved it!

This dish was delicious!!!! Instead of apple juice i used white wine, I also seasoned my chicken breast with lemon pepper seasoning and omited the salt and pepper in the flour mixture, I also omited the egg altogether. Browned the chicken breast in butter on each side for 5 to 6 mins. Placed the chicken breast in oven on 350 for 40 more mins because they were so thick. My chicken turned out so juicey and tender ( not a dry spot in sight) Yummmy! Thank You I have a keeper.

Thank you!  I have had this at my favorite Italian restaurant and it's easier to make than I ever would have thought.  I followed others suggestions and substituted the egg with milk to save a few calories.  The second time I made it, I used chicken cutlets instead of pounding the chicken.  Th second time I made it, I didn't have parsley on hand so I skipped it and didn't miss it.

Perfect! Usually when asking, "how is it?" I get a shrug of the shoulders and a response of, "it's ok..." Tonight, no left overs in sight. Picky eaters rejoice! 1. EASY 2. FAST 3. TASTES GREAT

The dish was okay.  I felt a little unhealthy eating it and chicken normally seems like a healthy option to me.  The fried part tasted good but made me feel bad and then the inside was bland.  However, the sauce was good and I liked the use of parmesan cheese.

Very good!  I used white wine instead of apple juice, so I could enjoy the rest of the bottle at dinner!  This is a very light sauce, and makes a lot, so I had lots of left over to pour over rice

Excellent! The breading was perfect and crisp and the lemon sauce was pleasingly tart and thick like a gravy. I used more butter than oil for cooking the chicken (meaning I reduced the oil) and only used one egg for breading. I only had beef broth, but that actually turned out very well and gave the sauce a nice color. You can easily use whole wheat flour in this recipe. We will be making this again; thanks for sharing!

This was very good.  My husband said it was perfect, but I thought it could use more lemony flavor.  That may have been because I used bottled lemon juice instead of fresh.  Other than that, I followed the recipe.  Next time I will use fresh lemon.  Since my husband said it was perfect, and since I fudged on the lemon juice, I decided this recipe deserved 5 stars instead of the 4 that I was leaning toward.

OMG!  This was fabulous!  I did what others suggested and substituted marsala wine for the apple juice (didn't have any).  The Parmesan gave the chicken great flavor and made it real crunchy.

This recipe is the best chicken recipe in the whole world!  Okay, at least the best one I've ever tried.  It tasted like it should have been served in a restaurant, not my house.  I did everything like the recipe stated except for using the parsley, since I didn't have any.  It was quick and easy, which made it even that much better.  Thanks for sharing this super-kick-butt-awesome recipe!

This recipe was great.  Took a little longer to prepare than I expected, but was worth every minute.  I added a pinch of tarragon to counter the lemon...delicious.

Outstanding, just the way it is!  The only substitution I make is dry white wine for apple juice.  Every time I make this, people drool.

A great recipe. 1tbsp of lemon juice will be mild, so add a bit more if you want a lemon bite in the sauce. I made one small modification and used 1/3 c of apple juice and then topped it off with some leftover white wine. Also used the juice of a whole lemon and the husband stole all the sauce!

This was an excellent recipe.  I had 3 chicken breasts, so I increased the amount of everything a little but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  I was reallly hesitant about the sauce becuase I wasn't sure about the apple juice, but I actually LOVED the sauce.  You can barely taste the apple  in the sauce, it just adds a nice sweetness. When I make this again (and I will be making this again) I might cook up some bacon to crumble over the top for garnish.  Thanks for sharing! :)

Delicious! My Husband made this last night for dinner. Couldn't find the parsley, so he used dry basil leaves. He served chicken on one side with sauce on it. He had extra sauce so he cooked up some whole grain rice, and added the extra sauce on top. Absolutely delightful. My tongue is still in awe!

This was an excellent recipe.  My family loved it.  I will give it 5 stars but it would be a little easier to follow if the chicken recipe was separate from the sauce recipe.  I kept having to go back and figure how much ingredients went with the chicken and the "remainder' went with the sauce.  I made it through though and it was awesome!!

This was excellent. I love anything lemon and chicken. This was a quick and different thing to do with chicken. We eat a lot of chicken in this house and it's a challenge to make something new and exciting with it. This was a winner. I served it with rice and green beans. I think I may use panko bread crumbs next time for a little crunch. Enjoy

Awesome and very easy recipe to follow. My family loved it! There are four of us so I just doubled the recipe. I served alongside some homemade mashed potatoes and mixed Italian fresh vegetables. Delightful! I had saved this recipe a while ago in my recipe box and thought I would try it today. I'm glad I did! Thanks!

This was excellent! I tripled the recipe and made it for company.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I added a tad more lemon juice at the end.  The sauce was great and was enough to pour over the garlic mashed potatoes I made with it.  Everyone loved it!

Awsome recipe! 

Only changes I've done is white wine instead of apple juice and I add lemon juice to the egg mixture. 

I love this recipe because even frozen chicken comes out tender and juicy! 

My husband really likes it!

This is delicious! I followed the directions exactly, and for lemon juice, I used half a lemon, squeezed. Personally, I like a slightly thicker sauce, so next time I will probably use 2 tbsp of flour in my sauce.

I wouldn't have called this a lemon sauce.  It was mostly made from apple juice with a hint of lemon.  I thought the flavor was off, and the name of the recipe misleading.  I definitely would not make the sauce again.  The chicken itself was tasty though.

I made this tonight and I have to say I was a little worried about how it being too lemony. Dinner was so good my mom and sister were over they loved it, my boyfriend loved it and I loved the fact that everyone loved it. The only variation I made was the apple juice, I took another reviewer's advice and used extra chicken broth I wasn't too sure about the apple juice. Anyway came out great thanx again for the recipe :)

My family really enjoyed this. It was very easy to make.  I increased this to feed 5.  I used half apple juice and half white wine and also didn't measure the lemon juice.  Will make again for sure, the kids are asking for it.

Great recipe.  I omitted the apple juice and used chicken broth instead.  I also increased the garlic.   I made this for about 20 people for a baby shower.  WOW...a total hit.  People asked for a spoon to get the gravy that was at the bottom of the pan.   I made the chicken the day before.  The day of the event I made the sauce, poured it over the chicken and baked it for about 10 minutes in a 350 oven.  Spectacular.

I tripled this recipe for a large group. There was not much of a lemon flavor. I also added capers and cut out the salt.

This was really wonderful.  I had a problem getting the sauce to thicken, but just added some cornstarch to help it along.

Beautiful and delicious!  This recipe is a keeper.   Had the apple juice on hand, but will make probably have just white wine next time.  Also, used tablespoons of flour instead of teaspoons, as others had written.

Loved this! Hubs is having gall bladder problems so we're trying chicken a million ways. I followed the recipe totally except I didn't have parsley so I didn't bother. I did put a couple Tbs of chicken broth in with the egg to thin it because of one comment about it tasting "eggy". The only thing I will do differently next time is use 2 Tbs of lemon juice as the lemon flavor was barely noticeable. Great dish with roasted potatoes & veggies!

This dish goes great with a wild/long white grain rice blend (both rices cooked in chicken broth in seperate pans and then combined). A side dish of plain broccoli also was a nice accompaniment. My children liked to put the sauce on top of their rice and veggies as well as the chicken for a little extra flavor.

I only tried the sauce portion of this recipe because I'm a vegetarian, but it was really good! I substituted veggie broth for the chicken and white wine for the apple juice. 

It was a really delicate sauce that doesn't overpower you with tart and lets the flavor of whatever you're putting it on shine through.

My 13 year old daughter (quite a good cook) made this chicken dish tonight and it was awesome!!  We didn't have any parmesan cheese but she added a bit more salt to the flour mix to compensate.  Also didn't have apple juice, so she used a combination of marsala wine, chicken broth and a touch of brown sugar (for the sweetness) in its place.  Wow!!  What a great flavor and the chicken was cooked perfectly!  My husband actually said he would order this in a restaurant, and that is quite a compliment from hm!  My daughter doubled up on the sauce and made roasted potatoes and glazed carrots to complete the meal.  So good!!

This recipe is absouletly delicious! I cooked in twice in a week, and could make it again this week as I made extra sauce. The only change I made was that I used 1/2 of the grated cheese called for. For some reason the second time the sauce came out thinner, but was just as delicious. Fabulous!!

I made this recipe for my hubby & I and we loved it!!!  I used the chicken broth but 1/4 of it was removed and replaced with white wine (still used the apple juice).  I added julienned zucchini & carrots to it and served it with quinoa.  I did decrease the measurements for the flour mix because it was too much and I used only 1 egg so there was less waist.  Depending on your oven you might also want to boil the broth mixture at the end a little while longer so it thickens nicely into a "gravy" like consistency.  I also marinated the chicken before hand with peppercorns, dried parsley (instead of the fresh parsley in the recipe, more subtle flavour) and lemon juice.

Yum yum yum!  So simple and so delish!  I recommend using white whine instead of apple juice.  A great recipe for quick weeknight meal.  Served over rice.

made this lastnight and doubled the recipe. I did not have lemons in the house but had lemon juice and I used white wine in place of the apple juice. Easy to make, came out wonderful and kids liked it too! Will make this again, it's a keeper.

This was a fairly easy and tasty recipe. I followed the recipe exactly (which is rare for me) and it turned out great. Even my 3-year-old ate it and really enjoyed it. This is a big deal for us! I will definitely be making this again soon. Thanks for the great dinner recipe!

Wow!  Awesome!  I have tried lemon chicken recipies over the years and haven't been pleased with the results...but this recipe~~this is the one!  I love lemon so I juiced and zested one whole lemon for the recipe.  That's it, the only change I made.  I can't rave enough about this, so definitely give it a try.  Thank you so much for sharing this with us!  :)

Great weeknight meal! Ended up doubling flour coating for chicken and all sauce ingredients, but ended up with a delicious meal with a subtle but flavorful sauce. Paired with green beans and walnuts.

This was so easy and tasted absolutely delicious.  I only had apple cider in the house so used that instead of apple juice.  I served it over linguine and steamed spinach.  Will definitely make again - thanks for a great recipe!

Very good.  Substituted 4 boneless, skinless chicken thighs for the breasts and only used one egg, substituted dry parsley for the fresh as I didn't have fresh on hand.  Pleasant lemon flavor, apple juice adds a touch of sweetness.  Thank you for a delicious submission.

I will admit, when I was cooking this I thouht it was going to be the worst meal I'd ever made.  I had pounded the chicken out so much that it was falling apart as I picked it up with the fork.  I increased the servings on here to 4, and I ended up running out of the flour baste, used way too much egg.  My sauce wasn't getting thick.  It did not look good.  But when we finally sat down to eat, oh my was it delicous!  Thank you for sharing!

This was really good.  I just had to give the recipe a shot because I am from Sheridan, Michigan, and was wonderfully surprised to see a recipe pretty much from my hometown.  Montcalm County cooks, ROCK:)

This was excellent.  I did as many others suggested and replaced the apple juice with white cooking wine and added more lemon juice.  The way the recipe is written it sounds like it's more for pork chops.  Pork chops are excellent with an apple juice sauce spiked with a tad of lemon juice.

This is a really good recipe. I used chicken tenderloins because it as what I had on hand. I also used half apple juice and half white wine instead of just apple juice. I used extra lemon juice and extra parm. I doubled the recipe to feed 4 instead of 2 and served this over whole wheat penne pasta. I found it a little bit a difficult to prepare but I'm a new cook and timing is not yet my strong suit. So yeah, harder to prepare but totally worth it. My boyfriend loves this and already requested it again (made it last night). He liked the egg taste but I didnt notice it to much. Its very Olive Garden in taste. I think I might serve it over brown rice next time.

I made this last night for my honeyman, and we both loved it! My only complaint is that the oil / butter starts to burn if you cook more than 2 chicken breasts (unless you have a huge skillet, which I don't yet). But otherwise, it was fabulous! I'll definitely be making it again.

We really enjoyed this recipe - kids and adults alike.  Only change I made was to substitute white wine for the apple juice as I didn't have apple juice hand.  Served the chicken with orzo w/ parm cheese and steamed green beans.  A definite keeper!

This recipe was great!  Easy and very tasty.  I omitted the apple juice for white wine and it was great.  I also used some lemon pepper seasoning.  My husband loved it. I will make again.  Thanks!

I'd make this again but use more lemon and less apple. It was a little sweet for my taste.

This was AWESOME!!  We all loved it to pieces.  Instead of Parmesan I used a blend of Parmesan, Romano and Asiago.  I used Marsala wine instead of apple juice and took the advice of adding more lemon juice (2 tablespoons).  Will definitely make again!

Incredible flavor!  This recipe is delicious. Although not very lemony, it is quick and easy.  I used egg whites to make it a bit healthier and garlic while marinating the chicken for more flavor.  I also served with chicken flavored couscous which went perfectly with it.

I needed a recipe that had the things that I had in the pantry and fridge and this was it.  I am so glad I tried it.  My husband, 5 year old, and 4 year old loved it.  I did double the recipe, but other then that I followed it exactly.

This is a terrific recipe,turned out perfectly, although I made a few adjustments. I omitted the apple juice and added an extra 1/4 cup of chicken broth, along with 2 cloves of minced garlic and replaced the parsley with 1 tablespoon of dried rosemary.

Terrific...I used cranberry juice instead of Apple Juice.  I added the flour to the juice/chicken broth mixture and got clumps so I used a strainer to filter out the clumps.  Then I sauted the chicken in the juice/broth mixture for about 5 minutes and it turned out perfect.

I had unexpected quests for supper so I tried this recipe and it was a hit.  The only thing I did differently was to brown the chicken in the pan, so I would have some some chicken brownings for the sauce, then I cooked the chicken in the oven.  The sauce was a great compliment to the chicken.  I would make this recipe again.

EXCELLENT!!! I followed the recipe exactly as written and it was easy and very tasty!  Just enough lemon flavor. Will keep in my "make often" recipe file.
