I'm rating this based on flavor combination rather than cooking method, because I prepared it differently than directed.  I substituted leftover turkey, so did not need to prepare chicken. Also, I oven roasted my butternut squash and pecans.  I added a chopped sweet onion to the mix when I roasted the squash.   I really enjoyed the flavors together and will use this again after Thanksgiving.

So YUMMY!!  I added avocado and used a citrus basil vinaigrette.   The PERFECT recipe for butternut squash.

I originally gave this recipe a 3 star rating, as right after I made it, I ate some and thought it was "fair" but nothing exciting.  I put the leftovers in the refrigerator.  Two days later I put a bowl of it into the microwave.  Wow!  What a difference it made. Amazingly good once the flavors were allowed to meld together.   I also added a  handful of flax seeds on top, which was a nice crunchy accompaniment to this dish.

Very tasty!  Next time will use roasted chicken for a bit more chicken flavor.

The flavour is super considering the only seasoning is butter, bouillon and then salt and pepper.

This was good, though I substituted chickpea cutlets for chicken and added a lot more seasoning - thyme, sage, garlic powder, etc. Also, the squash took much longer than 5 min. to get tender - more like 20 min.

I  like versatile recipes, and chose this recipe as a way to use up some leftover roast chicken and a different way to prepare Winter squash besides roasting or boiling.  I also wanted a make ahead meal. I modified it by leaving the quinoa and goat cheese separate from the squash/nut/chicken mixture so that we could make up our own bowl to our taste.  I found this warm recipe ticked all the boxes for sweet,savory, crunchy, soft and comfort-food-like all -in -one-one-bowl goodness.  Next time I'll add a green veggie on the side or a salad.  Looking forward to trying it as a cold salad with balsamic as suggested.

This was delicious - thanks for sharing. Out of necessity, I substituted walnuts for pecans and feta for the goat cheese. Really nice interplay of sweet and salty, crunchy and soft textures. Very high protein salad which we, as avid runners, appreciated. Well done!
