Glad I tried this recipe before seeing the one negative review. There was an instructional video accompanying this recipe at one time, but I can't find it anymore to pass it on. The directions as written are little unclear. When you pop open the crescent rolls, there are two halves. Pull the halves carefully apart. Unroll part of one half and pull off two of the triangles (don't separate the 2) and put the rest back in the fridge while working. Seal the perforation between the 2 triangles to make a rectangle. You want to make 6 squares out of this rectangle, so cut it in 1/2 the long way, then in 3's the short way.  Work as quickly as you can and handle as little as possible to prevent the dough from getting too soft. These make tiny bite-sized appetizers. I tested this on my adult kids and spouse before deciding to take to a family party. 4 people, 5 minutes...gone! All said "BRING THIS!" Made exactly as written.

Excellent!  When you remove crescent rolls from tube, notice two halves. Still rolled up see the perforation in the middle.  Pull the halves apart carefully. Work with the first half,placing the other back in the fridge until ready to use. Unroll the first half flat, seal the diagonal perforation between the 2 triangles. To make 6 squares out of this each rectangle, cut in 1/2 long way, then in 3's the short way. Work quickly to avoid softening of the dough. These make bite-sized appetizers.  Alternate method of preparation:  Add one 10 oz. box of frozen spinach; thoroughly thawed & drained.  Add this to a doubled recipe of other ingredients.  Next time I may consider placing in food processor to fully incorporate the ingredients prior to placing on small crescent squares.

This was a very easy recipe that got good reviews.  The dough directions are a bit confusing so I kind of winged it.  I doubled the recipe and found that I stuffed the dough full enough to only use one roll of crescents even though I had twice the stuffing.

I used a garlic/herb feta - these were SO delicious!  Disappeared fast - had to double the filling!

These were good and easy to make.  They were a hit with my family at Christmas.  Next time I'll try adding a little crab meat to them.

I loved this recipe. I did use the garlic crescent rolls instead of plain. Big hit with the kids.

The rolls went a little soggy with not much flavor. No homebake taste.

This was a great appetizer. I had a dinner party for my family and they loved it. The directions on shaping the dough did not work well, so I made squares instead of triangles. Will make again!!!!!!! Thanks for the recipe

I didn't think they were as easy as everyone made them out to seem because they're so tiny.  But they were different and good.

I tried this out for a Christmas party... big hit. Maybe because most of my friends are Greek, everyone thought I made tiropita (Greek cheese-pie).  They all asked for the recipe!

These are great!  I took them to a Christmas Eve party & everyone just LOVED them!  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because they didn't travel well (which goes for most warm pastries) & cutting two triangles/one rectangle into 6 small squares were almost too small.  I may just cut them into 4's next time.

My finace didn't believe me at first that I made them, they were so good and pretty!
He told me to keep this recipe in mind whenever we needed to make an appetizer.  We absolutely love these things!
