This was soo good! Unfortunately I did not have chanterelle mushrooms so I used baby portabellas. I also used the culinary chicken broth with white wine and herbs that I had left over. I omitted the salt because of that but did use the dried tarragonand of course the marsala. The sauce was so tasty I made mashed potatoes so I could have more of it. There was enough sauce for three breasts and potatoes too! A keeper!

This was a pretty good recipe. I found it to be slightly bland but not anything that could not be changed with a bit a seasoning. I think next time I will add more Marsala wine. I love the flavor of Marsala. I served this over angel hair pasta and with some home made garlic bread.

Iâ€™m very sensitive to the taste of tarragon, so I nearly always cut the amount of it in half. I did here and it turned out excellent.  I was worried the wine would overpower the chanterelles, but the compliment each other very well.

I added a bit of onion while sauteeing the mushrooms (didn't have shallots but will use those next time) and used half smoked paprika and half Hungarian paprika for the flour mix. Also substituted half and half mix of sherry and port since I didn't have Marsala. It all worked perfectly complementing but not overwhelming the delicate flavor of the chanterrelles.

A friend of mine had brought up some chanterelles he had found while out in the woods on the coast. Having never cooked with them before, I immediately opened up my All Recipes app to see what I could find and this recipe was first on the list.
I followed to recipe exactly except I used cubed chicken versus chicken breasts. I was concerned the chicken would get too dry, but simmering it in with the mushrooms and chicken broth prevented that. 
The flavor was excellent! Not bland as other reviews had mentioned. I served it with fettuccine noodles and sauteed squash and zucchini, it was so delicious! My husband loved it and I will most definitely be making this again.

Fabulous. I didn't have chicken broth! I had to substitute...used 1 can of mushroom soup and 1/2 cup of water. My hubby even said it;s a winner and he is a steak or fried chicken man, hard to get him to eat chicken! I think I'll try it with some Oregon pheasant....Thanks Kelly for a great way to enjoy Oregon wild chanterelle mushrooms!
