at last i find a recipe for the good stuff. my sister-in-law would make it your way with the exception of beer! can't wait to make it with the beer! she used to make it to take on little road trips. seems like you could feed an army with a cooler full of this stuff. we would save the marinade and boil the next day and pour over rice and eat kimchi or some other side dish.
only other comment i have is the type of soy sause to use. just remember you get what you pay for. cheap is cheap. pay a little more for the good stuff and you'll find out it taste better and goes further than the cheapo generic

Too much soy, too much beer, and no sweetness.

I tried this recipe to surprise my Korean parents.  My mom was shocked at how salty the marinade came out.  She asked, "are you sure it wasn't 2 1/2 TABLESPOONS of soy sauce?"  She also said one whole can of beer was way too much.  I think next time I'll go with my parents' recipe.

I didn't make this recipe, but it I know it would end up tasting too salty.  Sugar is key in this recipe.

I followed this recipe to a T. It was so salty that I couldn't eat it. I had to rinse the meat off before I cooked the second batch. I won't make this again.

It does not taste much like bulgogi, but it is rather tasty! I added 1/4 cup of sugar, as well.  It would be way too salty without it!  It was delicious!

I really thought this was delicious!! After reading all the reviews I decided to add 1/2c sugar to the recipe which may seem a lot but mine didn't turn out salty. I marinated overnight and I also used the remaining of some "cheap" soy sauce (Kikoman) and the rest of San-J. Is this a good brand? I think one poster had a good point and may be the quality of the soy sauce. So I will be making this again, I loved it because it was easy and very delish!!

This was ok. My husband is Korean and he was not pleased withthis one at all. Of course he is a little biased saying his mom's bulgogi couldn't be beat! Don't know if we'll be having this one again.

An easy recipe, but a little too salty for our taste, and my son and husband said not "hot" enough.  Will try to make some adjustments next time

I followed the recipe 100% and the meat turned out so salty. Is there a typo in the amount of soy sauce we are supposed to use?

Always on the lookout for different Korean BBQ variations and this one caught my eye. I read the reviews prior to making it and tried a reduced sodium soy. 

Even with the reduced sodium it is far too salty and there's not much beyond the flavor of soy, beer, and sesame. Bulgogi anywhere has a sweet component but I would not suggest just throwing in sugar. 

Typically the sweet that also tenderizes the meat comes from pureed onion and asian pear ... mostly the asian pear. The beer in this recipe acts as the tenderizer but there's no sweet to tie in three flavors that drown the beef and clash with each other.

I used the other half of the the chuck, cut the soy down to a half cup and added pear juice from a can of pears and let that marinate overnight. Just those two adjustments were a great improvement. Maybe not 5 star, but for 3 minutes worth of work ... a good 4 star.

add 0.5 a cup of sugar and it's a great recipe. it actually did remind me of the bulgogi I ate in korea. I also suggest using nori stripes for several rolls so you'll have some nori and some lettuce rolls.

I'll second the "salty" comment.  It tasted good, but was very salty from the soy sauce.  Using 1/8 th the Soy might help...
