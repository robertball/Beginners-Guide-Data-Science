It turned out very tasty, but I had to make a couple modifications. Try using room temperature pb and add about 3/4 cups of water to the peanut sauce or it will clump and stick to the pan. If possible, prepare the sauce separately and then add it to the chicken.

Boy, this recipe needed a lot of help to be palatable.  First of all, sesame oil is not a good choice for browning anything.  It is strongly flavored and has a very low smoking point.  Most Asian recipes use it as a flavoring ingredient, not a frying medium.  I used peanut oil to brown the chicken tenders after seasoning them with salt, pepper and Asian pepper spice. After browning, I removed them from the pan to prevent over-cooking.  The sauce was way too thick and I thought the flavor rather one dimentional, so I added one tsp sesame oil, ginger, garlic, soy sauce, rice vinegar, 5-spice powder and a little water to thin it.  I heated the sauce in the skillet, and when it was hot, put the chicken tenders back in.  They were okay, but not very Thai,IMO.  There are better recipes on this site.  Sorry.

Awesome!  I did what other reviewers said - I put the peanut butter (chunky), ginger, 3/4 cup water and hoison sauce in a small saucepan and heated it up.  Cooked the chicken in the sesame oil and then added the sauce.  I didn't have cayenne pepper so I used crushed red pepper - made it nice and spicy!  Didn't have any scallions so just skipped them.  Served it with Jasmine rice.

I thought this sauce was great, but then again, I love peanut butter and hoisin. I melted my PB in the microwave first and then proceeded. To the reviewer who said the hoisin made the sauce too fishy; I'm not sure what you used, but there is no fish in hoisin sauce. Just fermented soy beans, sugar, vinegar, garlic etc. Good recipe and thank you!

Maybe it's common sense, but if you don't care for hoisin sauce and/or peanut butter, don't prepare this one. Those flavors are prominent and as such dominate the recipe. Otherwise, 1) As others recommend, use a sauce pan to mix the sauce. That makes certain the ingredients are mixed well and will keep it from clumping, 2) I used peanut butter with nuts, which tasted great and is not unusual for Asian cooking, 3) I used a lot of water in the sauce (didn't measure, but at least a cup) to thicken up the sauce. I thought it was way too thick as written. The water did not dilute the flavor at all, 4) I only had 1 tablespoon of sesame oil left, so I mixed it with peanut oil and it was a good choice.  

This recipe is so easy that I can imagine throwing it together for a snack or "different than the same ol'" quick lunch quite often.  Strong, but good flavor if you like the main ingredients.

I made a few changes, thanks to other reviews, and in the end my whole picky family loved this dish! I made the sauce seperately, with all the listed ingredients, but only a 1/4 cup peanut butter, added some soy sauce, chicken broth, lime juice, garlic and tahini. I also added carrots, cabbage, peas and broccoli. First i browned the chicken, then added the veg and some stock to steam it. this made the chicken come out really tender too. When all was cooked i tossed it in the sauce and served over rice with chili flakes sprinkled on top.

Excellent!  A family fav everytime I make it.  I occasionally sub Goyza sauce for Hoisin if that's what I have on hand and crushed red pepper flakes for the cayenne.  Also, once chicken is browned, I remove from pan, mix the sauce ingredients in the pan then return the chicken to finish cooking in the sauce.  This makes for a smooth sauce.  Try this recipe, you won't be disappointed!

Good stuff! We changed it up a bit. I wanted to stretch the chicken so added a bunch of vegetables: half a large onion, two carrots, a big bell pepper, some cabbage... For the sauce, we added all ingredients to a bowl and mixed them, adding about a quarter cup of leftover coconut milk and some water(per the other reviews), and several shakes of curry powder. I poured the sauce over the chicken and veggies when they were done, cooking only another couple minutes. The juices from the vegetables and chicken thinned the sauce the rest of the way and it was the perfect consistency. Very tasty. We got four substantial meals from one large chicken breast and two cups cooked rice. Probably also reduced the calories a little that way. Thanks for the easy recipe!

2 teaspoons white vinegar
1/8 teaspoon garlic powder
2 teaspoons sesame oil

Way too thick - Following the directions exactly did not make a good sauce.  Like others, I had to add a lot of water to make this work.

I enjoyed the dish. Because the sauce was thick I added chicken broth. I also added onions and carrots.

Now I can make one of my favorite thai takeouts at home. Use crunchy peanut butter and toss with rice noodles to make "peanut noodle".
I too had to add about 1/4 cup of water to the sauce. Also, next time I will probably cut the cayenne pepper to 1/2 teaspoon...a full teaspoon comes out a strong "medium" on the thai restaurant spicy scale.

Everyone loved this.  I did make a few modifications, I mixed the sauces together and found that it was just too thick so I ened up adding  3/4 cup of water to the mixure and cooked probably for 5 min.  I was also added red onions to the mixture since I was out of scallions.

I felt like it was too much peanut butter in the recipe. My kids thought I had another of my inventions for dinner so I was really bummed to has gotten it from an actual recipe in the web. I'll have to really think about making this again.

This chicken was AWESOME! In starting the chicken in the skillet, I seasoned it with white pepper and garlic powder. I cooked it over extremely high heat to get a good sear on the chicken.  I took the advice of other reviewers and removed the chicken from the pan before adding the ingredients to create the sauce. Before I added them, though, I did a quick saute of two sliced carrots and removed them from the pan as well. I added the "sauce" ingredients along with about a cup and a half of water and mixed them well before adding back the carrots, the chicken, and about two cups of green onions cut in large chunks.   I served it over brown rice, which I think really holds up well to the density of the peanut butter. My four year old loved it, as did my husband and myself. This recipe is definitely a keeper--it's simple, easy, and oh-so-tasty!

This was very good, but the sauce was too thick to spread evenly over the chicken. When I reheated the leftovers, I added some chicken broth, which made it much better.

This is a WONDERFUL recipe for  homemade Thai food. I serve mine with Jasmine rice & it makes a whole meal. I don't typically use sesame oil since it is a bit pricey but I have found that vegetable oil works just as well. I also add a little bit more cayenne pepper since I like the added heat. It's pretty quick to make too!

I rather enjoyed the taste of the dish, but I ditto the thickness that others here have mentioned.  Next time I will try to use about half of the peanut butter and hoisin and add some honey to add sweetness.  There was just way to much sauce for the amount of chicken.  I thinned the sauce out a bit with canned chicken broth.  This worked pretty good.  Loved the flavor overall, just a bit to much thick peanut butteryness.  Was great over white rice!

This recipe was awesome.  Even my husband who likes great food - loved the flavors!  The kids also ate it - not too spicy.  I mixed the the sauce with the sliced chicken ahead of time prior to cooking - this allowed more flavor throughout the chicken.  (I had followed the recipe the first time - and felt I needed to mix the peanut butter/ginger/hoisen sauce  together prior to adding to the chicken.)If you like asian food and are looking for a quick easy recipe - which the whole family will enjoy - This recipe is it!  I served it with rice - green beans and a salad with a ginger/vinegarette dressing!

These were really easy to make. We will be making these again before ever ordering Thai take-out.  The cayenne pepper gave it a nice kick and the creamy sauce turned our boring chicken into a real meal. Thanks!

I've made this for dinner twice now and I love the taste of it.  Yes the "sauce" is kinda chunky to work with (even with creamy peanut butter), so I might add the water as other reviewers have suggested.  I didn't have cayenne pepper this time, so I replaced it with crushed red pepper and some black pepper - just as good to us!  Obviously if you aren't a fan of peanut butter this isn't the dish for you, but as I love it, it's a keeper!

The chicken tasted good, but I made a lot of changes to the original recipe. Like others suggested, I added 3/4 cup of water, halved teh peanut butter, and made the suace first.  Then, when I was ready to cook the chicken, the sauce was too thin so I had to thicken it up with corn starch.  I made my own hoison sauce, by the way.  I'd have been happier with a recipe I could follow from start to finish without fewer changes.

I wish I had read some reviews before I made this. I would have thinned down the sauce much more, and made it separately. That being said I did thin mine down some with white wine. I live in Europe and we are limited to just a few peanut butter brands...used Skippy super chunk and it was very good...i liked the bits of peanut in it. I'll make it again but the sauce separately...maybe w/ a bit of lime juice too, and some cilantro sprinkled on top.

My boyfriend absolutely raved about the recipe and I thought it was great.  I chose to use chunky peanut butter and definitely needed add water or chicken broth to too thin. The only reason for the four star rating is that I found that there was a tang missing from it and i couldn't figure out what to add. I think I will take one reviewers suggestion and add lime juice next time to give myself that added a little bit at a of lime juice. We also discuss perhaps adding a bit of steamed broccoli to it not only distracts the meal but to give it a vegetable component. We will definitely be remaking this dish in the future is fast simple filling and delicious.

ive made this first time thinned the sauce and the 2nd time I didn't.

I loved it both ways!

if you are not sure if your family will "go for it", (my husband doesnt like much oriental) but he likes the peanut dressing they use on your salad at the Japanese steak houses, and he liked this

This is a good basis for the recipe. Like other users have said the peanut butter definitely needs to be mixed with water otherwise it's too thick. 

I also fried the chicken in the sesame oil with some red onions and soy sauce for some extra flavour to the chicken. Throwing in some coriander at the end instead of spring onions was also fantastic.

Excellent and very fast recipe. Like another reviewer said, add about 3/4 cup of water to the sauce and make it in a separate bowl before transfering to the chicken pan. I use chunky peanut butter because that's what we usually have on hand. My picky, picky boyfriend asks for this every week.

I try a lot of new things, but unfortunately this turned out to be a pretty bad dinner. The sauce is too much of a paste. Sorry if that is what is intended, but just didn't care for this dish. After reading all of the reviews, I need to add that I did add the water and some soy sauce and mentioned to my wife that minced garlic may help. Just wanted to clarify!

These turned out very well. I mixed the sauce before adding it to the chicken and added a half-cup of water, which kept the sauce from being too clumpy.

I came back to check and see if I missed a step after making this... something's not quite right with this.  The flavors are good... I'd give them a four star rating.  But my "sauce" -- if you can call it that -- never became a sauce; it was a clumpy mess that just hung around the outsides of the chicken.  Then, when I put it in the serving bowl, the oils started to separate out.  If I try it again, I think maybe I'll try to thin it with some coconut milk.

My first attempt at a Thai recipe.  I served over rice and veggies.  I didn't have any cayenne pepper, so I added a dash of tabasco, and found it to be fine and not too spicy.

I followed the directions until it came to the cayenne pepper. I used a 1/4 teaspoon, which was just enough spice for me. I also added about 1/2 cup of water to the mixture because it was way too thick. I served it over rice and added broccoli. If I make it again I will mix the ingredients for the sauce in a bowl and then add it to the chicken.

This recipe did not work out very well.  We tried it and my roommate thought that the sauce was too thick.  It then kinda fried up and didn’t coat the chicken very well at all.  It turned into sauce and cooked chicken.  While the sauce tasted very good, it was super thick and needs work.  If you can thin it out with some work, this may be successful but we’re not going to do this recipe again.

This was pretty good. I made my own hoisin sauce. The only thin I would change would be the amount of peanut butter, add some soy sauce and rice vinegar. I made mine with noodles and veggies. came out great.

I would remove the chicken from the skillet then make the sauce in the skillet, adding water until you get your desired sauciness. Even after modifications to make the sauce milder tasting, I still couldn't eat it.

Very tasty! I added some bell peppers and red onion to make the meal complete. I cooked the chicken and veggies in canola oil and added the sesame oil to the sauce. I found the sauce a bit too thick so I added 2 Tbsp of soy sauce and about 1/2 cup of water. Served with Asian noodles.

I liked this dish.  I served it with coconut lime cilantro rice and it was delish! However, the only change I would make to this recipe when I make it the next time would be to cut down on the peanut butter---probably by about half. It's just too rich and at times overpowering. I like that peanut butter taste, but I don't want to feel like I'm eating chicken coated in just peanut butter, which is how I felt at times. I liked the combination of flavors, but they really competed with the peanut butter. I'm sure it will be very tasty when scaled down a bit.

I will def make again, but with the advised changes.  Per others, I added rice vinegar, some garlic powder and fresh garlic, soy sauce,  white wine and some water ...cooked chicken in garlic olive oil with a little sesame oil and added warmed up sauce to chicken.  I added cooked broc, red pepper, carrots and celery to the chicken and sauce.  I felt the sauce was still thick, I thought it would thin out a little more when cooked but it didn't.  Next time I will add more wine and water.  BTW use low sodium everything, it seemed salty to me, not sure why bc I go no salt on everything i can

Followed recipe witha few suggestions from others.  Made sauce seperatly, adding additional water.  No chayanne so I added dried chilis.   No green onions so added red onion while the sauce heated.  Will make this recipe again and again.  Increased fresh ginger to 1 tablespoon.

I will make this again but use a little less peanut butter and cayenne. This is simple, quick and goes well with Jasmine rice.

If you're looking for low cal, this isn't it.. Other comments call for water etc to thin the recipe, do it...
Not feeling like rice, I ate most of 1lb of chicken for "5 servings" The flavor overwhelms but hunger rages on..

This was one of my first recipes I tried off of allrecipes and I thought it was really good.  I followed other's advice regarding mixing the sauce separately, etc, and it turned out wonderfully.  I will definately be making this one again.

This has become one of my husband's favorite meals.  I've made it with peanut butter and sunbutter (made from sunflower seeds) because out daughter is allergic to peanuts.  It is really good with either one.  The cayenne gives it a nice kick.  The sauce does get a little too thick for us, though.  Adding a little water or chicken broth helps.

Surprisingly good! Next time I'll use extra garlic, some sriracha or hot peppers for a little more fire & coconut milk.  But for future users, definitely follow the advice of other users & microwave the peanut butter first -- it will make all the difference in consistency!

Ok, so before my husband and I made this, I checked all the reviews just in case. I kept seeing how "clumpy" and "sticky" the sauce was turning out for a lot of people. Here's what I did to remedy the clump situation: I lessened the peanut butter from 1/2 cup to a 1/4 cup. I also nuked it for about 15 seconds beforehand to where it was the consistency of a thick caramel. Someone else made that suggestion(THANKS!). I also added a 1/4 coconut milk and a tablespoon of wasabi powder as well to counteract the sweetness factor. It was absolutely great! Quick and easy too. I'm just a beginner cook and a newlywed, so this recipe was right up my alley. If you follow my suggestions I really doubt you'll be disappointed, because we sure weren't. Give it a shot guys!

I made this for supper last night and it was a hit with everyone, even my super picky Dad. It's not good left over as I just found out. I test drove a small amount of the sauce with chicken in teh frying pan and quickly added quite a bit of water until it was just slightly thicker than gravy.  I also added a few dashes of soya sauce to break up the hoison and peanut butter. Very yummy on its own but I think it just added something.  Liking peanut butter is a must here.  Good Luck

This is quick and esay to make. I have made this one twice one by the directions and then with a few changes.  The changes I made was mix the sauce together and heat it up in the microwave before adding to the chicken.  I added about a half to a cup of water to the sauce as it was way to thick before.  Also I added garlic.  I used a non-stick pan with just a dab of oil to cook the chicken and added the sesame oil after the chicken was cooked so the oil would not burn, also cut the oil in half as I have pure sesame oil and it is very strong.  Next time I will cut the hoisin and peanut butter in half as it makes lots of extra sauce.  Will make this again it is very filling.

Most recipes I've made from this website, my husband has rated as a 5 or 6 (on a scale from 1-10) but he gave this recipe an 8! I loved it too. I recommend mixing the peanut butter and hoison sauce in a separate bowl.  It's a little difficult to mix, so I used my Kitchenaid mixer. I added a little sesame oil to make it thinner too. I didn't use scallions. And I served it over rice. I will definitely make it again!

I also did not care for this recipe. I was so looking forward to a good Asian type dish and this just wasn't it. There is way too much peanut butter in it and it is too thick. I will not make this again...sorry.

This recipe just wasn't that good of flavor.  The sauce was just too thick (although I didn't have the clumping problem that some people had).  We didn't even save the leftovers... It tasted like peanut butter so much that you couldn't even taste the hoisin sauce.  Won't make again.

I hate to say it but I made this last night following the recipe to the T. Unfortunately it was absolutely awful. Just thinking about it still makes me feel a little queesy. The smell alone made everyone in the house feel sick I dont know why but it just didnt taste right. While I thank you for taking the time to post this recipe for others I wont be making it again sorry.

Made this for a change. Like other people, the sauce stays clumpy. The flavor is excellent, though! Will have to find a way to have sauce not stay so clumpy.

I should have read the comments first! Oh well, it was good, but the sauce was clumpy-- next time I will definitely cook it separately and add some water to thin it out. I think I will add some garlic as well.

Skipped the cayenne pepper because I didn't have any but this was GREAT!! Everyone loved it.
