This is a delicious recipe.  After reading other reviews I decided against using heavy cream.  Instead, I wisked together one cup of fat free sour cream and 1 cup of skim milk.  It made it very creamy, without the heaviness of the cream.  Plus, the sour cream gave it a really nice flavor.  I also used minced garlic instead of sliced garlice.  It was absolutely delicious!

An amazing recipe.  Have made several times, each with different cheese combos.  You have to use the fresh grated Parmesan on top for the crispy topping effect.  I used my mandolin to slice the potatoes very thin, so the cooking time was precise.  What a wonderful recipe!  *Update*:  I've found that if you cover with foil for the first half hour (spray the underside of the foil with cooking spray and it won't stick to the cheese) the potatoes cook more thoroughly.  Just a little tip.  Still making this awesome recipe!!!

I made these a couple of weeks ago. Very good I only changed this a little I crushed the garlic and added it to the cream (I tripled the recipe and wanted the garlic to be even through the potatoes) I also added finely chopped onion like another reviewer. Go easy with the salt with all this cheese especially with the parmesan. I will be making this for Easter dinner this Sunday to go with the ham. I find that if I par boil the potatoes (cover potatoes with water and bring to a boil for a couple of minutes) then slice they  cook faster and the sauce is creamier I think because the potatoes don't absorb to much of the moisture, maybe that just me.

Once again, so many people changing the original recipe then rating the original! I made this EXACTLY AS IS....what a YUMMY and EXCELLENT DISH!! The second time I made it I did add extra garlic only because I love "extra garlic", it was STILL GREAT! Timing was perfect! It was one of the TASTIEST potato dishes we EVER TASTED. The teenagers loved it too. The first time I made it, I kept having to look at the recipe, but now it's EASY TO MAKE.    IF you have left-overs, they are JUST AS YUMMY! Thanks for the FLAVORFUL "AS IS" RECIPE!

The first time I made these potatoes, the texture was disgusting. The potatoes were underdone and sitting in water.  However, the flavor was so darned good that I thought it worth another try!  Based on the recommendations of other reviewers, I sliced the potatoes thinly using my Kitchen Aid slicer, I used a mixture of 1 c. fat free sour cream and 1 c. skim milk instead of heavy cream, I used pre-minced garlic from a jar to taste, I ommitted the butter, went light on salt, and cooked for over 1 1/2 hours at 325.  They were perfection!  This recipe is especially good for those who loved crusty, baked cheese.  However, lovers of ooey gooey cheese won't be disappointed with what lies underneath.

Does anyone know if this recipe can be made beforehand and then cooked the day of?  I want to use it for Easter Dinner but would like to be well prepared so I can enjoy myself instead of running around like a mad woman....Thanks!  :)

This was "good" but I've had better scalloped potatoes.  I added more salt and garlic than the recipe called for, but there still seemed to be a dearth of flavor, probably because there was too much cream in the recipe.  The cheese layers definitely saved the dish.  Next time I will cut back on the cream by at least half and replace with garlic-infused milk.  

Tips:  
-I increased cooking temp to 400F--but you might want to cover lightly with a piece of aluminum foil so the cheddar doesn't brown too fast.  

-I used a mandolin to cut potatoes very thinly (a food processor would work too) and then I blanched the slices in a pot of boiling water for about 10 mins--don't let them get soft!  I patted them dry, then layered them and had NO problems with cooking time. 

So, all in all: more salt/garlic, less cream, increase oven temp, slice potatoes thinly and blanch before layering.

WoW, I loved these potatoes, they were delicious.  I followed the recipe with respect to the cheeses, using sharp cheddar, parmesan, and provolone, and these were great.  I used Half-and-half instead of cream, as was suggested, so I would recommend this to others.  Also, as others have said the butter could be reduced, mine WOULD have been rather greasy except that in the last half hour (when I removed it from the oven to add Parmesan on top) I drained the excess butter from the pan, because it was looking too greasy.  I will definitely make this again, but probably with only a little bit of butter.

I spread the potatoes in a thin layer so they'll cook faster and i made sure they were sliced very thin. The cheeses on top got kind of crispy and that gave it a nice touch. I also covered the pan with foil for the first 30 minutes. Excellent! Update: Made these in cute individual ramekins, layered as described and they look amazing!!Used half and half instead of heavy cream. Great presentation!

Yum, Yum, Yum!  Delicious homemade scalloped potatoes.  I highly recommend this recipe.  I added 2 extra garlic cloves and immediately before serving I added some shredded parmesan.  These weren't that great for leftovers so prepare it for a meal where it will all get eaten fresh.

A wise sister once told me that whenever you cook a recipe for the first time, follow it exactly.  That way you know who screwed up if it wasn't to your liking.  After that do all the tweaking you like to your personal taste.  Well, after making this recipe as is, we thought it was divine.  Next time I will try to tweak it to make it less caloric!  I'll sprinkle a Tblsp of flour over potatoes with regular milk, less butter and cheese, maybe green onions.  As is, it is excellent but not to be eaten too often if health is a concern.

I tried this recipe for my first Mother's Day with my in-law family. I tried blanching the potatos before baking them as I was short on time and got distracted, cooking them to mush. We tried baking them and mashing but recipe was too runny! I was near tears thinking I'd ruined dinner when, by phone, by Mum suggested serving this as SOUP!! It ended up a HUGE hit with everyone and went faster than anything else - which was good because it started to thicken back into potatoes as it cooled! ;) I doubled the garlic (cause I always do!) and now I still owe my partner's grandmother a vat-sized portion to take home!  I highly recommend this dish even if it ends up being your cooking tragedy!

Excellent recipe! My PROBLEM is the name. For those that don't know, ANY time cheese is used it is a GRATIN. It is only Scalloped when there is no cheese. I see this all the time and for some reason it simply grates on my nerves. Now to the recipe. Make sure your potatoes are sliced thin and season each layer as you go. This way there is no blandness under all the wonderful cheese topping. Other than the name I had no problem at all with this recipe. To answer one question asked this can be made to the point of baking and held up to 24 hours in the fridge just make sure that none of the potatoes are exposed (they turn black when exposed to air) and the dish is well covered. Make and enjoy!

Yeah, I am confused about all the rave reviews.  I followed the recipe and ended up with a curdled mess.  The taste was awesome though, so too bad it turned out the way it did.  To anyone who decides to try it, omit the butter.  With all that cheese you really don't need it and the cheese + butter creates a lot of grease.

The first time I made these the potatoes didn't cook enough, it was greasy, it was not creamy, and the cheese was overcooked(after 1 1/2hrs). UPDATE: I boiled potatoes (skin on) for 15 minutes. Sliced them with skin on (keep some vitamins), omitted butter, mixed one can low sodium cream of mushroom soup with skim milk until smooth (w/some thickness), then followed the recipe layering potatoes, garlic, soup/milk, cheese and so on. I baked it 30 minutes covered, then 30 minutes uncovered - My husband went from not liking it, to saying it was the BEST SCALLOPED POTATOES. It was creamy, not greasy, potatoes were done perfect. Try it this way if you were not pleased the first time.

I have made homemade cheesy scalloped potatoes so many times over the years but was really excited when I found this recipe!  When I make scalloped potatoes, I make a homemade cheese sauce (butter, flour, milk, cheese).  I thought this recipe would cut out that entire process and make for quicker prep time.  I just took my potatoes out of the oven (they have been in there for 2 hours) and I'm disappointed in how clumpy the sauce is.  I am letting it cool but I don't think that will make it much better.  There is no what scalloped potaoes will cook in an hour.  I knew that going into this recipe.  I use a mandoline to slice my potatoes thin, but it still takes a long time to bake.  The next time I make scalloped potatoes, I will go back to making with with my cheese sauce and layering the dish - potatoes, sauce, potatoes, sauce, etc.  It's much better that way.

I sliced the potatoes on a mandoline, used half and half cream, and didn't have provolone so I left it out but added extra cheddar. I had some leftover cheese sauce from a mac and cheese dish I had prepared earlier so I added it as well. It was baked in a 9x9 pyrex dish. As written the heat and timing is off, the potatoes were still al dente after an hour and a half. The completed dish was swimming in water/separated milk fat, even with the addition of my leftover mornay. The flavour was good, the potatoes were a messy, liquidy glopfest.

I read most of the reviews and decided to give this a try, knowing some of the negative possibilities. I think I figrued out that this recipe needs to be made in a large baking dish with lots of surface area and the potatoes need to be sliced *very* thin. I made mine in a 1-1/2 aqt. casserole and experienced some of the problems others have -- greasy top and underdone potatoes. The flavors were wonderful, though and we all loved the richness and cheesiness...and the garlic! But next time I will use a 13x9 pan, slice the potatoes paper thin, and blot the top of the casserole before putting on the Parmesan cheese.

Wow! Definitely a crowd pleaser. I would take the advice of others and cook for much longer at 300-325. Any higher temp and the milk curdles.

I prepared a day ahead by covering with foil & baking for the 1st 30mins, then cooking uncovered the other 30mins the next day. I thinly sliced 5 medium potatoes on a mandoline in a 9x13 pan & added some finely minced sweet onion & between the layers.

this recipe is so easy, and so good it should be outlawed! I've made it several times since I found it, and every time it has been a total success. If you are a scalloped potato fan, then this is the recipe for you! Quick and easy tip...the last few times I made it, I used a mixed blend of shredded cheese (the pre-bagged mixes from the grocery store), and it worked out great.

This recipe is AMAZING! I wouldn't change a thing. The first time I made this it turned out perfectly and my whole family loved it. It's become a holiday tradion to make these. The garlic and cream and cheeses blend perfectly and these are the best potates I've ever eaten.

Loved it so cheesy and creamy. Forgot to read reviews and I had mine in corning ware 1 1/2 qt and needed to cook longer. I did cover the first 1/2 hour, then uncovered...should follow what others say and maybe extra 30 minutes.

THE TIME TO COOK IS TERRIBLY WRONG AND AFFECTED THE HOLIDAY MEAL - WE ALL FINISHED EATING AND THE POTATOES STILL WERE NOT DONE COOKING!

Very eagerly tried this recipe and followed it to a 't', even using the suggested cheeses. It was very tasty, as reviewed. However, my family and a guest agreed that the flavor did not merit the cost and fat of the ingredients. I will adapt this next time by using everything except will use 1 3/4 c milk mixed with 2 T flour instead of the cream.

Very good & very easy! And very RICH! I like that you don't have to make a white sauce for this recipe, it makes it much easier. I omitted the butter (not that that saved many calories in the scheme of things)and added an extra clove of garlic. Thank you, Karla!

I had to do some tweaking on this recipe. By the time I went to prepare it on Christmas day I realized we didn't have Heavy Cream. I substituted a can of Cream of Brocoli & milk to equal what I needed. -(doubled the recipe).

My only complaint is that the recipe only calls for an hour cook time & so that's all I planned for. My family was kind to eat some, but it was crunchy instead of creamy. I'd recommend having at least 1 hour 45 minutes to cook these potatoes.

After I re-cooked this recipe it was AWESOME with left over ham. *** (just cook it longer than recommended!)

as written....yikes!688calories and 56g fat per serving!!!!
With these changes a little less unhealthy and 4-5star.Spray dish with cookking spray.I used skim milk. I kept the butter because 2T isnt that much...Only 1 1/2c reduced fat cheddar, really thin sliced provolone, and about 1/3cparm.I baked mine covered at 350 for an hour, in a 9x13.

Very tasty, but my very thinly sliced potatoes took almost two hours to be cooked fully (at 350).  Also, the sauce was quite greasy. Everyone loved the flavor, though.

My husband loved this so much he asked me to marry him again!  The kids and I thought the taste was perfect, but very heavy so next time I'll be using milk in place of the heavy cream.

I followed this recipe as stated and it turned out wonderfully!!  If you add ham, take away the heavy cream, add sour cream and milk, etc. etc. etc....you're not really rating THIS recipe!!  This recipe is wonderful as is - I took it to some friend's house and they had seconds and thirds!!  I'll definitely make it again.....only thing is it did take longer than 1 hour for cooking time.  I had to eventually crank the oven up to 400 to get them finished in time.  I used Yukon gold potatoes, and sliced them super thin with a mandolin too.  At any rate, the taste was BETTER than expected.  I'll make these over & over.  Thanks so much!!!

I loved these!  The only changes we did were to use minced garlic, half heavy cream/half milk/sour cream mixture.  We also cooked for 15 minutes longer, just to make sure they were done, and covered them for the first half hour.  Will make again!!!

This was good, but a little overly cheesy for my taste. Like other reviewers, I wisked together one cup of fat free sour cream and 1 cup of skim milk instead of using heavy cream, which worked out great.  Next time I'll use a little less cheese and add some onions.

I really like the addition of extra cheeses and garlic, however the Creamy Au Gratin Potatoes recipe (from this site) is much better and you can make those same additions to it and not worry about your potatoes not being fully cooked.

This was okay.  We liked it, but I don't think it was good enough to justify how fattening it is.

It would be difficult for me to not rate a potato dish with 5-stars because I LOVE potatoes!  This one was so good.  That semi-hard crusty slightly-browned cheese top was the best.  I used fresh garlic, but also added a sprinkling of onion & garlic powders.  Ended up only using cheddar and parmesan cheeses because my provolone was frozen solid.  Used 2 russets and 1 red potato, and mostly cream, but had to top it off with a bit of sour cream to make a full pint because that is what I had on hand.  Baked it foil-covered for the first 1/2-hour, then uncovered the 2nd, but even though I sliced the potatoes really thin, some still weren't done; I think ideally it could have used another 20-30 minutes in the oven at the 325F temp. Thanks for the great recipe, KarlaLV, and for your assistance, Reviewers!

Made this with ham steak and baked asparagus with balsamic butter sauce (from this site), and they disappeared like magic.  I used gruyere instead of provolone, 6 cloves of garlic, half and half and some cayenne to spice it up a bit.

Superb (and very rich) scalloped potatoes. As suggested I also used part milk instead of all cream, omitted butter, used grated gruyere instead of provolone, sliced potatoes using processor and came out great and plenty rich.  Feeds alot & and great for dinner parties. Can hang out in oven a while and not dry out. Will definitely make again. Thanks for sharing this one.

I really like these potatoes.  This recipe is versatile, too.  I've changed the cheeses to suit what I've had on hand--like cream cheese, Swiss, or low-fat cheddar--and the result is always excellent.  Also, I use inexpensive (white) potatoes, not Yukon golds; and I always cook with skim milk, yet the dish is still very rich.  The only reason I don't make these regularly is the calories involved.

Loved the provolone topping.  The potatoes were uncooked though, so will take another reviewers suggestion of boiling the sliced potatoes briefly first. Very high fat meal, will lower the butter content next time too.  Won't make often just because of the calories/fat.

The taste is great, but this is the 2nd attempt I've made with this recipe - both times the consistency was very watery.  I give up on this one.  I'll  be looking for a new scalloped potatoes recipe.

Wowwa! These potatoes were  AMAZING! I made them yesterday to have with our Easter Dinner. I did not have any heavy cream, so I used 2% milk and it still came out really good and creamy!  The garlic really adds a lot of flavor and surprisingly is not overbearing.  I am making a second batch tonight for dinner and adding chunks of our leftover Easter Ham. Thank you for sharing!

This is my family's favorite scalloped potato recipe. However, as with other reviewers, the heat and/or timing is way off. Maybe I used too many potatoes and too many layers? I didn't like the two layer method so mine had 4 or 5 of very thinly sliced potatoes and added the Romano to the layers rather than on top. After three tries, I finally got it right with a temp of 375 covered for one hour, then uncovered for an additional 30-45 minutes. A little on the greasy side but that's ok with a nice beef dinner.

Wonderful flavor, especially with the smoked cheese blend I put on top. I am only giving four stars because I cooked over double the time to achieve tender potatoes. The recipe should say to slice VERY thinly, and I think 3 or four layers were preferable to the two layers as written. Great taste though, it just needs tweaking for the procedure. ~~~NOTE: I raised the heat, varying from 350-425 (depending on what else was cooking in the oven), and I covered the pan, and the cream boiled and clumped. This must explain why the recipe calls for low 325, to avoid cream separation. Heavy cream is finicky :)

Cooking time too short as posted and/or temp not high enough.  Next time I will increase oven temp to 375 and also try convection setting.  I should probably have had the liquid at room temp when I started; maybe that would have helped them cook faster.  Lots of grease even though I used half 'n half not heavy cream.  Don't need the butter on each layer.  Did sprinkle both layers with a TBSP of flour. Not sure if it helped or not.  Next time I will make more, thinner layers and will saute lots of onion and add to the layers.  Garlic was a big positive - I added extra.  I used cheddar for the layers, asiago on top, and the person who said putting parmesan on top would brown and crisp top was correct. Not a difficult recipe and end result tasted really good, just needed to tweak the temp, time and fat.

These potatoes came out excellent after a few revisions. Melt 1Tbsp of butter in a saucepan then add the heavy cream, garlic, cheddar cheese, 1 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp pepper, and 1 small onion finely chopped. Whisk til cheese is melted then add potatoes. Boil for 5-10 mins. Pour the mixture into buttered baking dish, dot with remaining 1Tbsp butter and cover with foil that has been sprayed with cooking spray. Bake at 375 for half hour covered and then uncovered for another 30 mins or til potatoes are tender. Dont forget to add the parmesan cheese when uncovering the potatoes. This dish came out very delicious. The sauce thickened right up  and i had no trouble with the cooking time. Enjoy!

I have made this recipe twice with great success.  I read the reviews and so was forewarned to be cautious and leave plenty of time for cooking -- it took mine almost an extra hour.  I doubled the recipe and baked the potatoes in a 9x13 inch pan for 45 minutes covered with foil.  I removed the foil and baked another 30 minutes and then tested the potatoes.  They needed another 30 minutes baked covered with foil.  I finished by removing the foil, covering with Parmesan and baking a final 20 minutes.  They were awesome.  The cheese on the edge of the pan was crispy and delicious.  All but one spoonful was eaten and guests raved.  This will be a staple in my house.

I tried this twice.  First without changing anything at all in the recipe and then again changing the cream to sour cream and milk as others have.  Both times it tasted great, but the texture was not creamy.  It looked curdled.

Surprisingly I didn't really like these scalloped potatoes. I didn't think there was much flavor. I think they need something else to add a kick.

These tasted pretty good, but I much prefer potatoes where you make a creamy white sauce first.  This didn't really have a creamy sauce at all, just cheese.  Plus, I had to cook it almost double the time listed before the potatoes were tender.  I used a full paper towel to soak up the grease floating on top before serving, and it was still pretty greasy.  It was a lot of work for a so-so result.  I did enjoy all the cheeses, and used Tillamook Garlic White Cheddar for the cheese for some extra garlic flavor.  So the flavor was great, but I wouldn't make these again.

I found this recipe on your website last year because I was tired of the same old scalloped potatoes.  My family is still talking about them, and they are a special request by everyone that tried them.  I had lost the recipe, and I am so happy to have found it again, so as not to disappoint my family.

Yum, yum, yum!  I used sharp cheddar, parm, and aged gouda (very tasty addition).  I also ended up cooking for a little longer...about 25 minutes more than directed.  As a hint for those who encountered the "curdle" thing, here's something I found useful from the Iowa State University Extension: "The protein in milk is likely to clump together when it is exposed to acid or salt, causing curdling... When making scalloped potatoes, if you avoid too high an oven temperature and too long a cooking time, the milk is less likely to curdle. Parboiling the potatoes and using evaporated milk further aids the product."

Everyone liked these.  I used half & half (10% MF) rather than heavy cream.  Had no parmasan on hand but it still cooked nicely and browned beautifully.  Great recipe (I put onions on half of it as the kids aren't so fond of them, so we were all happy.)

Yum, Very good recipe.  I did make one change and used 5 green onions instead of garlic.  It added color and a flavor that I'm more partial to.  I like garlic to be subtle and not particularly with my potatoes. But followed everything else to a tee.  Devine!  (Oh, almost to a tee; did boil my potatoes to pre-cook a bit for 15 minutes and then only baked for 40 minutes.)

My husband and I would rate this 4 1/2 stars.  Easy to make and not at all time consuming---(1) didn't peel the potatoes (honestly, no need to!) (2)used a mandolin to slice very thinly (3)used a garlic press (used 5 cloves)instead of slicing (4) used shredded mexican cheese mix (great flavor!), and lastly, salted generously as per previous reviewers' suggestion.  Otherwise, followed the recipe as written and it turned out great.  Next time, I won't add the butter---didn't feel this added anything to the recipe other than more fat.  This one's a keeper and worth making for company and the holidays.

Definitely delicious! If you double the recipe as I did, you do not need to double the butter, but you will need to double the cooking time! If you up the heat, the bottom will burn, so just give yourself 2 1/2 hrs of cooking time to be sure the potatoes are done. Everyone loved them!

These are so sinfully good, I felt guilty eating them. I question if the person who wrote this recipe really means a "pint" of heavy cream. That's 2 cartons since they are half pint, but anyway I used 2. I think half and half would work just as well in this. Changes I made were: I used red potatoes since that's what I had on hand. I used garlic powder instead of fresh garlic, which worked well. Next time, I will used something other than provolone for the 3rd cheese, it was stringy like pizza cheese and I prefer a cheese that melts down more. Also, I boiled my potatoes the day before, I think the water in raw potatoes changes the flavor and consistency of a recipe. This is wonderful with ham and I highly recommend it. I know I will make it many times again.

We really liked this recipe.  I made it for Easter this year and it was well received.  I made this almost exactly as written except I left out the butter after reading reviews that suggested leaving it out because they said it was rather oily.  I think that helped.  It did take a long time to cook - about 2 hours.  Maybe I'll par-cook the potatoes next time - I also forgot the parmesan cheese but it was still really good.  Will definitely make this again.

This recipe was disappointing.  It took an extra long time to cook and I still didn't feel like the potatoes were cooked well.  In addition, the cream and cheese stayed separate with a layer of grease floating through everything. The flavor would have been okay if only the consistency wasn't so gross.

I'm just not sure what went wrong on this. I made the recipe according to instruction and rated it accordingly...without all the suggested modifications. 

The good news is that in the end, I wound up with an edible dish, but it was nothing more special than potatoes covered in melted cheese. Even when it's bad, that's bound to be good on some level? 

On the negative side, the potatoes were still too hard to eat at the end of the prescribed cook time. Also, I panicked toward the end because they were swimming in liquid. I must have poured 2 c. of butter/cream/cheese off of this dish. After sitting for quite a while, they did congeal enough to look okay on the Easter table. I really wanted to love this dish, but I will have to keep looking.

Made this for my fiance's family for Easter dinner.  I didn't know this ahead of time, but apparently half the family loves scalloped potatoes.  I'd never attempted making them before, so I was terrified!  Long story short, they absolutely loved them and commented on them all night!  I did substitute half fat free milk and half low fat sour cream instead of the heavy cream.  It was still fantastic! Baked for 1 hour with foil on and 45 minutes with it off since I doubled the recipe.  Yukon golds came out perfect: firm, but teeth sinkable.

I made these for Easter and what a disappointment. I followed directions but used sour cream and 1/2 and 1/2 in place of the heavy cream. I used my mandolyn to assure thin slices. 
We tested them after an hour and the potatoes were still undercooked and hard. I ended up microwaving the dish and they still never cooked through. I have never had this happen. They were very watery and awful. It was a joke at the table after while just trying to get these to cook. Any thoughts on this disaster?

I made this the other night for my family...all men. They couldn't get enough of It! I was wife mother and daughter supreme that night. I did exctly as the recipe called for but, added real bacon bits and topped with chives..My husband said they we're almost a meal alone. The butter was a little greasy but, I used a blended butter/ veg oil. Next time(tomorrow) going with real butter. Seriously try this one...so worth the time Thank you so much

Made as recipe directs.  Had to allow a longer cook time for the potatoes to be desired consistancy.  Overall not bad will make next time with a few adjustments.

Cook time is way off on these. I cut the recipe in half and used my food processor to slice the potatoes very thin and after 1 hour they were still very hard. Cooked additional 1/2 hour and increased the temperature to 400 and they still were too firm in spots. Definitely blanch first if you are making this! I also found the garlic a little strong but I swapped the parmesan with asiago that I had on hand so maybe the combination of the two was a little overwhelming. I feel the butter isn't necessary in this recipe either, there is plenty of fat from the cheese and cream, the butter just leaves greasy spots in the dish where the oil rises to the top. Not a keeper for me.

Followed the recipe exactly, this turned out rather greasy and the texture was unappetizing. I think this recipe goes overboard with the cheese. I wouldn't recommend it and wouldn't make it again (at least not with the suggested combination of cheeses), and this is coming from people who are huge cheese lovers.

This came out so pretty, i used cheddar, mozzarella, and Parmesan and made more layers and a bit more butter, but it came out so well. using a mandolin really helped on making nice even slices and I'm definitely going to use this recipe again.

Wow - easy to make and completely delicious!  Doubled the recipe for a 10 person potluck and slightly changed to make it lower in fat.  Subbed half and half for heavy cream, used low fat provolone, low fat cheddar and halved the butter. Due to a late start with the potluck, the dish heated at 200 degrees for an extra 45 minutes or so in the oven...no problem at all.   Yuh-hum  is all I have to add.  Superb!!

WOWSERS! This is DELICIOUS!  If you're counting calories pass on this one...but if you want some REAL comfort food-GO FOR IT!  We just added some onions for extra flavor and baked an extra 45 minutes to make it super gooey! It's AWESOME leftovers too!

I respect that we all have different tastes and I love cheese, potatoes, and garlic but did not care for this recipe. It does seem that it would be good for families with picky children that like simple tastes.  I prever a more flavorful recipe and this was too basic for me. The heavy whipping cream and butter make the dish extremely heavy, as well as drown out all other flavors.  The cheddar adds a little something but is too bland a cheese - even sharp cheddar which is what I used along with provolone and parmesan(fresh).  The end product is very basic/greasy/heavy tasting and lacks flavor.  I would instead use a more flavorful cheese combo like provolone, parmesan, asiago, and maybe fontina or even gorgonzola throughout all the layers, add some spices to give it a good flavor.  I would also suggest NOT using heavy cream as others have, but rather milk and perhaps omit the butter.

I made this yesterday for New Year's Day dinner and got rave reviews from all.  I sprinkled a little flour between each layer and also added thinly sliced onion with the sliced garlic, which perhaps was the reason the potatoes did not turn out greasy.  I used provolone, emmenthal and parmesan for the cheeses, but I did find the stated cooking time was too short, I cooked it for a whole extra hour and had the over up to 400 for the last 30 minutes.  Definitely let the potatoes sit covered with foil for at least 15 minutes before serving, and they will come out of the pan beautifully.

EXTEREMLY tasty! I made this for a potluck thanksgiving dinner and everyone loved it! A few ideas I took from other members: 1) Raised the temp in the oven to 380 2) covered the potatoes for the first half hour and sprayed the foil with Pam 2) Added sour cream and reduced the amount of cream 3) Didnt add butter - and was glad I did! Would have been WAYyyy too greesy.
Definately will make again!

Maybe I was just expecting to much because of all of the great reviews but I was extremely disappointed in this recipe.  I did not care for the taste and all of the cheese made it quite greasy.  As other reviews mentioned, it took much longer than the recommended cooking time.

I've been searching for a good scalloped potato recipe that my family would enjoy, and this is it! 

Next time I'll slice my potatoes a little thinner, as they were very slightly undercooked, but the flavor of the cheeses and garlic made up for that. I also took the advice of another reviewer and pressed my garlic cloves and whisked them into the cream before pouring over the potatoes. 

The cream is quite rich, so the only thing I might do different next time would be to cut down on the cream (and butter) a little and maybe use some half and half instead. But all in all, a wonderful recipe. Thanks for sharing!

I don't like to change recipes when I make them for the first time, but I didn't have provolone so I used swiss (and garlic salt instead of garlic).  It came out fantastic.  I will be making it with the Provolone this weekend. Can't go wrong with this one.

Loved this recipe.... I added bacon bits and breadcrumbs on top for the last 1/2 hr.... i found one hour was not nearly enough cooking time and i even par boiled the potatoes first.  I needed an extra 1/2 hour so 1.5 hours total.  I would definitely make this again.

These potatoes were great! My husband made them last night with roasted chicken. He did change a couple things, used milk instead of heavy cream and added chunks of blue cheese which were a welcome flavour surprise. As others suggested, he cooked them for longer, about 70 minutes in total. We had the leftovers for breakfast and served them with eggs and bacon...decadent!

Note for beginners - These did not turn out well for me. I am a novice at cooking, so perhaps with more experience it would of been okay. The taste itself was very good, a little rich, but very yummy. It was more the texture I have problems with. The butter separated from the rest of the cheese, and it turned out a gooey mess. It's not a dish that saves well, the separation of the oils only gets worse if you try to re-heat it. I liked the different cheeses, but I think when using a cheese like Cheddar you don't need so much of the butter with it, the cheddar is oily enough without all the extra. I also had to cook it for a lot longer than the recipe called for, and I sliced the potatoes pretty thin per the suggestions.

I made this recipe only adding an extra clove of garlic since we are garlic lovers. It was one of the tastiest potato dishes I ever tasted. The teenagers loved it too. I thought it sounded complicated, but it really wasn't and next time will be even easier now since I've made it.  The timing was perfect. I used the mandolin slicer and did cut the potatoes about 1/8th thickness. It was perfect! Thanks for the flavorful recipe!

The smell in the oven is so deceiving!  Everyone was so excited to taste this recipe and it fell flat on its face.  The potatoes clearly required some cooking beforehand (which I did, but not enough).  The cheddar cheese was greasy and didn't coat the potatoes very well.  It was basically bland potatoes layered with clumps of separated cheese.  I would suggest scrapping this recipe and trying another one.

These are cheesy, creamy and good.  Baked them in a 9" X 13" pan.  My food processor didn't slice very thin, so they had to bake about 1 hr. 50 minutes.  Next time I would salt and pepper the potaotes directly, rather than salting the cheese.

I decided to make these because of the mouth-watering photo by LatinaCook. I cubed 3 large russet potatoes and in place of cheddar, used shredded velveeta. I replaced 1/2 the cream with light sour cream so I wouldn't feel quite so guilty! Following LatinaCook's suggestions, I baked with foil the first 1/2 hour, then removed it & sprinkled on the parmesan. To save time I used garlic powder & onion powder, and I will use more next time. I ended up baking a total of one hour & 15 minutes, and I baked at 350 degrees. The potatoes were flavorful and tender with a nicely browned, cheesy-crisp top. Thank you Karla!

This didn't work for me.  Maybe it was because I tried making it lower in fat.  Someone suggested using 1 cup sour cream and 1 cup milk instead of the heavy cream.  I also used low fat marg.

I made this for Easter dinner, and was disappointed--but it was my fault!  I read the reviews, and many reviewers (and Martha Stewart) recommended substituting Gruyere cheese for some of the cheddar.  Ick!  Although I did have to cook these for longer than the recipe called for, I expected it and planned it.  I used milk instead of cream, and used the Martha Stewart method of placing the thinly sliced potatoes into a skillet with the milk to soften the potatoes-- this also allows the starchiness of the potatoes to thicken the milk.   I will make these again without the Gruyere, and I'm positive they'll be great.

These were good with a few changes.  The cooking time needs to be doubled.  Also, I used half & half instead of cream and topped it with gruyere cheese instead of provolone.

Great recipe and thanks to the reviewer who recommended parboiling the potatoes. Boiled mine for 30 minutes (til tender) and then let cool on the counter. Peeled and cut the potatoes in half and used an egg slicer (so easy) PERFECT slices. Used havarti cheese and some onion slices that I microwaved for a minute to soften. Also just used garlic powder instead of fresh garlic. Baked covered for an hour and then topped with just a little fresh grated reggiano/parmesian. Baked another 20 minutes. Company was late so it sat on the counter for 30 minutes. These were so tender and good. Very forgiving for all the baking and waiting. Used some cheddar and jack cheese too. Everbody liked these. TRY THEM.

I came across this recipe almost 2 years ago, and have always had rave reviews when I make it.  However, plan on at least 1 1/2 to 2 hours baking time - NOT the 1 hour they suggest.  Also, as mentioned by other reviewers, half & half works great & even regular milk works in a pinch.  I also tend to add a bit more garlic as my family loves it, but that's just a personal preference.  This is an outstanding recipe - you'll love it.

I LOVE this recipe. I have made it multiple times over the years. The only difference is that I don't like food too garlicky so I just sprinkle a little garlic powder in place of the garlic slices. I have always found that the cooking temp and time do not jive however. To be done in an hour, I've always had to bake it at 400/425.

Oh my! Such a disappointment! I made it for Easter this year. I tripled it, put it in 2 larger Pyrex than it called for. I sliced the potatoes THIN, and switched sour cream as recommended. I baked them for 2 hours (longer as recommended). They came out of the oven looking spotty brown and beautiful. We served them to everyone and then I reached over to my 5 and 6 year old's plates to break them in bite sized pieces with my fork. That is when we realized, that after 2 hours in the oven, the potatoes were completely raw! And there was too much water in the pan too. Such a disappointment!

My first shot at scalloped potatoes...YUMMY!!
A few small changes, closer to two lbs baking potatoes, 1/2 cream 1/2 sour cream, 4 crushed garlic cloves, minced onions. Didn't have provolone, used muenster. Oven a bit hotter, about 375, same time. I don't know if made a difference in texture, but, the sliced potatoes soaked in water for about 2 hours. We loved it! The next day, heated up with ham for breakfast.

SO GOOD!!! my changes are not majorly altering the recipe. I added SHARP cheddar instead and one medium sliced onion. Oh, and russet potatoes (I usually only buy these). I LOVE THIS RECIPE so good and fantastic leftovers (if you have any).

I did this recipe EXACTLY as stated.  Not only was the dish not done in 1 hour, but it was not done in 1.5 hours.  It took 1-3/4 hours to cook the potatoes to al dente at 325 degrees.  That said, OH MY GOD they are so luscious, deliciously decadant, and I could not stop eating them.  Two comments on the cooking process - the provolone slices get totally brown, so I turned them back into the potatoes and let them "stew" in there under the cream.  Otherwise they would have been black after 1-3/4 hours.  When you add the parmesan at the end, we grated fresh and used 1/2 cup and ended up with a lovely, browned top and some chewy pieces of provolone in with the gooey potatoes.  I would DEFINITELY make this again, but indeed allow the extra time.  Stupendous!

This is a great recipe!  I've made it many times.  Only thing that I have done differently is added a little bit of thinly sliced onions, but I've gone without adding onions too and it's still a great dish! One of my favorites.

Very disappointing.  The potatoes were not cooked through, even at 350 for one and one half hours.  I covered the dish with foil for the first 30 minutes and even that didn't help.  I used half and half and it curdled.  Maybe boiling potatoes first would help, but I think there are better recipes out there.  Won't be making again...

Awesome the first time around!  It is really helpful when other people share their comments.  If you have a food processor, it is so easy to slice the potatoes as they are consistent in size and it only took about 1 hour to cook.  I used the light sour cream/1 cup of low fat milk and blended it together to make it creamy.  I then used about 8 garlic cloves (for garlic lovers), chopped them up and spread them around.  There is absolutely no need to use salt and as for the cheese topping, I only had jack cheese and it turned out awesome!  So any cheese you like will do!!!!  Outstanding recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious!!  I gave it only 4 stars because it was super greasy.  Maybe next time I'll omit the butter.

I made this last night when my husband invited some coworkers for dinner. I was hesitant about trying out a new recipe on company, but it sounded sooo good. I made it just as written, but I had to bake it about 20-30 minutes longer than directed. It turned out great! Everybody raved over it, and the dish was almost empty! I was worried about it being too rich because you could see little greasy pools at the top, but nobody seemed to mind. Next time I think I'll leave the butter out to see what happens. Overall...YUMMY!!! Wish I had more leftovers to eat!

OMG BOMB-DIGGITY! My husband said it's the best potato dish he has EVER had. He said it's better than any restaurant, I have to agree! I substituted half pint milk with half pint cream, I also substituted 2 teaspoons minced garlic from a jar instead of fresh garlic, I also substituted peeled red potatoes instead of Yukon Gold, the recipe still tasted AMAZING! If I could give 10 stars I would! This recipe is definitely a keeper, I'll probably laminate it.

This was great.  Used half and half instead of cream per other's reviews and the advice of my mom.  :)  The provolone and garlic are definetly the keys.  Next time I would add a little more cheddar, and my housemate said we should try it with green onions next time.  I think both could make it taste even better.

Made the first time as recipe is written.  It was great but on the "rich" side. Second time, I went to make the recipe & discovered I didn't have enough potatoes. So, Plan B: used 1 1/2 lbs frozen southern style hashbrowns. I defrosted in the microwave so I could assemble the recipe. Ended up folding in some onion, garlic, dried chives, 1 cup fat free 1/2 & 1/2, 1 cup low fat sour cream and the 2 cups shredded cheese. Combined & poured into greased casserole. Covered with foil, baked 1/2 hour, removed foil and added the provolone & parmesan on the top. Finished baking. Very creamy even though I didn't add butter.  Served with baked lemon pepper fish fillets and coleslaw. Will make this again with our "fish meals".

Very good scalloped potato recipe.  I made as written but will eliminate the butter the next time as it rose to the top and looked greasy and I will salt & pepper the potatoes instead of on top of the cheese. I also used scissor cut garlic chives to sprinkle over the top. Excellent garlic taste!

This is just not a good recipe. The taste is terrific, but there is too much cream and nothing to bind it, so the butter and all the grease that melts out of the cheese rise to the top and just sit there in a pool when you serve it and break through the Parmesan crust. You can't even tell anything is wrong til you try and serve it. I was very sad at the amount of grease and fairly bland cream (that much cream needs quite a bit more seasoning, but IMO it's just plain too much cream period). Also, the cook time is off even for Yukons - 1 hour 15 minutes and my potatoes were still crunchy all except the top layer which was closest to the broiler (I browned the cheese under the broiler). After re-cooking the flavor was nice, but the plating still wasn't pretty -- reinforcing for me that I always prefer when au gratin potatoes or macaroni start with a bechamel. Still, thanks for the recipe, because in the end the flavor was nice!

This recipe was amazing! Being the blonde that I am, I managed to forget to buy fresh garlic, so sprinkled garlic powder between layers. Aside from the garlic, I followed the recipe exactly as displayed and it came out perfect. I made these for a party and got a lot of compliments! A+ recipe!

Awesome!  I didn't have any heavy cream, so I mixed up regular sour cream and 2% milk and used that.  I am not a fan of provolone so I left that off.  Very good stuff!  I'll be modifying this a little bit more and making it for Thanksgiving.  Thank you!

I wasn't looking for a low-fat dish, I was looking for a dish to impress and filled with flavor and so I followed the recipe all the way -- heavy cream included! -- and it was delicious! I did sneak in about 1/2 an onion, but not because the recipe needed an onion, just because I LOVE onion with my potatoes. :>) This was SOOO good. I used 2 cups cheddar, sliced provolone & topped it off with the grated parm. You really don't need to change a thing, it tastes GREAT as is. Thank you for a YUMMY dish, it's a keeper!

Yum yum! This was SO good! I ran out of provolone, so used a little mozzarella to make up for it. I also used a combination of half and half with heavy cream. Perfect! I covered with foil for the first half of baking as suggested by one reviewer, and the potatoes cooked perfectly! My husband loved this as well, so I will definitely make this again. Thanks so much for the wonderful recipe!

Don't cook it this way.  Heat the potatoes with the cream on the stove first.  Otherwise it won't cook through.  Flavor was good, just wasnt cooked through all the way which was a big dissapointment.

These had a wonderful taste. Everyone LOVED them..I used what I had at home so I didn't get to go Exactly by the recipe this time. I used sour cream instead of heavy cream and I used roasted garlic instead of the minced garlic (which I know would have been so very good)..Im sure the original recipe was just as good.. Thank you for submitting it.

Not for the squeemish.  These were extremely greasy, potatoes severely undercooked, and I followed the recipe to the letter.  It was also VERY expensive to make and a waste of money.  Sorry!

A definite crowd pleaser. Made as written, but added very finely diced onion between the layers. Will certainly be making again trying some different variations with the cheeses.  Thanks for the awesome recipe!

Did not change a thing.  I did parboil the potatoes for a couple of minutes and was worth the extra effort.  Will make these again.

After reading through the reviews I decided to use a different potato. I used white to get a softer potato. I also Made a sauce by using 4 TBS butter melted in a pan then whisking in 4 TBS flour. When blended I added 3 cups of milk, a TBS of minced garlic and cooked until slightly thickened. To that I added 1 c fresh grated Parmesan cheese and 4 slices of provolone. I also cubed the ham and added that to the sauce after cheese was melted. I then poured this over the potatoes, covered and baked 1 hour. At which time I took off the foil and added a layer of smoked mozzarella cheese and baked uncovered about 20 min more. It wasn't crunchy on top but it was wonderful and not greasy or any other problem others had.

These were incredible.  It is definitely only a special occasion side dish because of all the fat and calories but well worth it.  I used the the slicer on the food processor to slice the potatoes very thin and ended up using 2 pints of the heavy cream  to cover the potatoes.  I didn't have any provolone  so I omitted that.  The topping was so crunchy and delicious, I'll be skipping the provolone next time I make it too.

Cheese and potatoes - how can one go wrong?  Made this recipe exactly as written and turned out fantastic.  Less liquid than regular scalloped potatoes, but delicious nonetheless.

Great, easy recipe! I did make some adjustments and tweaked it to add my own personal touches. I used the 1 c sour cream and 1 c nonfat milk in place of cream. I also found that parboiling the potatoes whole for 5-7 minutes (depending on their size) really helped in slicing them. I used cheddar, muenster, and grated romano cheeses, and since cheddar and muenster are usually pretty greasy, I opted to not use the butter. I mixed in some chives with the sliced garlic and topped the casserole with paprika. I also covered the dish with foil for the first half hour only, which helps seal in moisture and juices and keeps it from getting too crispy. Wonderful, easy, and easy to tweak! Using it for an Easter Feaster today :)   As for not using a recipe "AS IS:" being that there are billions of taste buds on every individual's tongue, everyone's tastes and preferences are different. I say tweak away! Have fun with it. That's what cooking's about!!!

For some reason, my potatoes would not get soft, even though I baked them for even an hour longer than the recipe called for. I don't know what happened, but I was very disappointed because I had to throw the entire dish away with all those wonderful cheeses. I am sure it is a good recipe and I just did something wrong, but I am scared to try again.

Delicious!  I used cheddar, mozzarella, and parmesan as my three cheeses.  I do think that next time, I will cut back on the amount of butter, but other than that I have zero complaints.  My husband loved this so much he told me to use it as my scalloped potato recipe from now on!

I made this just as written, except I upped the garlic to 4 cloves and minced it instead of sliced it, and it was delicious! Next time, I may try to get rid of some fat in this recipe and try 1/2 and 1/2 or some skim milk in place of some of the heavy cream. The crusty parmesan on top really makes this dish!!

Mmmmm...yummy!  Based on other reviews I boiled the (whole) potatoes for about 1/2 hour earlier in the day.  Then before supper I sliced them thin with the mandoline.  I skipped the butter and subbed the garlic slices for a few shakes of adobo seasoning (I use that on EVERYTHING).  I love garlic but was just feeling a bit lazy!  Since I had the mandoline out I also sliced up some vidalia onions and layered them with the potatoes.  Otherwise I followed the directions and baked for an hour uncovered.  Served it with baked tilapia so it didn't feel quite as fattening.  LOL.  Thanks!  :)

I was so excited to make this recipe since I just bought a new mandolin.  That gadget made slicing the potatoes a SNAP!!! This is a very good scalloped potato recipe, with a few minor tweaks.  I added sliced Vidalia onions to the recipe and minced the garlic.  (Potatoes and onions just belong together.)  The cooking time needs to be longer - - our potatoes were still a bit hard after 1 hour.  I'd up the oven temperature to 350 for 1-1/2 hours.  (First 45 minutes covered, the last uncovered.)  There was a small amount of grease on top of the casserole from the provolone cheese, but I just blotted it with a paper towel before bringing the casserole dish to the table.  Not a big deal.  Delish!

The verdict is in! This was an easy dish to prepare. I had no problem with the dish being greasy as others have said. My husband absolutely loved it. It came out perfect. If I were to make it again, I would probably cut back a tad on the added salt, and maybe use half milk and half heavy cream to suit our taste a bit better. But it is wonderful as is! Thanks for sharing your recipe.

Don't understand why all the great reviews on this one.  Followed the recipe exactly and came out with a dish of greasy potatoes that needed AT LEAST another 30 minutes to cook-they were still crunchy. I would rather eat scalloped potatoes from a box mix than go through all this work...not to mention there is no way to make this even semi-nutritious.

I made this for my MIL's birthday.  After keeping it warm in the oven for a while I found the provolone cheese to be a rubbery crust on top.  This is best eaten the first day.  My leftovers were too oily to enjoy.

3.5. Replaced the cream with 1 cup milk and 1 cup sour cream as suggested by a reviewer. Cooked over two hours and probably could've cooked longer, but didn't want cheese to burn.  Put parm on before starting to cook, baked covered for 40 minutes and put foil on again when the top got dark.  Lightly sprinkled paprika after done cooking.  Used extra sharp cheddar and parm, no provolone. Wasn't heavy, also wasn't creamy.  May make again and steam potato slices a little before cooking.

Tried this recipe for Easter - it was a big hit.  I found that the butter was way too much and I actually blotted the grease off the top of the potatoes before serving.  I also used some chicken stock in place of some of the heavy cream, and it still came out very good.  I used frozen crushed garlic and mixed it with the cream instead of placing it directly on potatoes.  Labor intensive and certainly not a healthy dish, but good for a special occasion.

I was so embarassed! This recipe is all I had to bring to easter dinner and I followed it to a "T". It was a soupy mess with a butter slick along the top. THe cheese all curdled and was grainy. I Finally got a ladle and spooned out about 2 cups of liquid, returned it to the oven for yet another 30min. and it was still a goopy mess. This was not worth it, I am going back to the box!

My husband and I like a lot of garlic, so I used 3 cloves instead of 2 as called for in the recipe.  I think it was still rather mild, so maybe next time I'll try 4 cloves.  This came out creamy and cheesy, and my guests loved it, too.  Definitely a keeper.

The recipe for 6 servings calls for 1 1/2 lbs of potatoes.  This is about 3-5 potatoes - hardly enough for this recipe.  Also, the 325 cooking temperature is too low if you expect it to be done in one hour.  While the taste is OK, I agree with many other reviewers that the price in terms of fat and calories is not worth it.  There are much better recipes than this one.  I am really surprised to find this a recommended recipe for Easter dinner!

This was really good. This will definately be made again. I did make a few changes. I chopped up the garlic and added an onion. I didn't have enough Heavy cream so I used sour cream and milk also. Someone else had suggested it. I also added Ham between the layers. I forgot the butter while I was putting it together, but didn't seem to make a difference.

Tasty but, extremely liquid, too much fluid in the recipe!!!
Even with flour added it was wet. Not what I would be prepared to serve to company.

I made this for Christmas dinner.  I followed the recipe to the letter and it came out absolutely perfect.  We had seconds the next day and it didnt seperate like someone else nor did it get oily.  Yes its rich but its not meant to be eaten often.  Everyone LOVED it.

These are terrific! I made these for christmas dinner and nobody could believe I made them!! Wonderful flavor, I did exactly as the recipe stated. I did slice the potatoes too thick and they took forever to cook. So next time I will make sure they are thinner. Live and learn

We really loved this dish! I also used one cup of light sour cream and one cup of skim milk in place of heavy cream as was suggested.

These were very tasty indeed, the only change I made was to use half one percent milk and half sour cream to cut back a bit on fat.  Made them for Thanksgiving and everyone enjoyed them.

This recipe has wonderful flavors! The first time I made it I found it to be a bit runny, so now I make it with half the cream it calls for. I have also substituted minced garlic for the sliced & it comes out just as good. Every time I have made it for guests they ask for the recipe. Thanks for sharing!

..Was in a hurry with this one and didn't have time to read the reviews.  Was fairly good but definitely needs some onion more cheddar and about 25 more minutes in the oven.  I served with Mini Meatloaves and Cheddar Broccoli salad.

I made this for Easter and it was a hit!  I made a few changes though.  I put a layer of provolone and romano in the middle along with the cheddar.  I also used a garlic press and pressed teh garlic into the milk so the press and the liquid would flavor the milk.  This way I did not have to worry about someone biting down on a piece of garlic.  Other than those slight modifications, I baked everything for about 1/2 hour longer than recomended and it was wonderful.  Easy and delicious.  Will make for many years.

Excellent! Rave reviews from everyone in family.  The only thing I did different was place the potatoe slices in the microwave for 5 minutes before layering them in the baking dish.  Super Easy!  Will make again :)

A wonderful dish!  I did make a mistake with the cream that turned out to be a delicious mistake.  I ended up using half whole cream and half bakers cream.  The bakers cream gave it a little "sweatness" to the dish.  All in all, it turned out great.  I strongly suggest this dish to anyone.  And it's easy too!

Good recipe but I changed it up a little. I didn't use heavy cream but milk. I only had to use 5 potatoes. And I used Mozzarella instead of chedder cheese. I think it came out great and slicing the potatoes thin makes it tender.

I followed the recipe exactly- except that I cooked them at 375 for 1 hour and 15 minutes AND the potatoes were still too hard!  I won't make these again because I'm so bummed that the dish was inedible at Easter dinner!

I make these potatoes for big family dinners and everyone just loves them!  Very yummy and easy to make if you have an apple peeler-corer-slicer to cut and peel the potatoes for you.

These were delicious!!!  They cooked about 2 hrs.  I used cubed fresh hashbrowns with onions instead of sliced potatoes.  I used swiss cheese instead of provolone cheese. They were not greasy at all.  I kept cooking them until the cream and cheese were creamy and bubbly and the potatoes were tender. My dinner guests said YUMMY!

My family loves these, but not really scalloped potatoes.  Needs to cook atleast one hour.  I use cheddar, mozzarella and parmesan.  Can use milk instead of heavy cream, it is just as good and less calories.

Loved this recipe! The best scalloped
potatoes I've ever tasted!  Easy to make also. Did have to bake longer than
stated but well worth the wait!

The only problem I had was the amount of time it took to cook (Extra 40 min at 350?). I am sure that the thinner you can make the potatoes in the first place, the better, but I didn't have a slicer, and I did the best I could (I am getting a slicer for Xmas, so maybe it will work better). I added more garlic (garlic lover) and it tasted great!

These really did taste like they could have come out of a restaurant!  I made them a couple of weeks ago and used a mixture of half gruyere and half cheddar, along with the provolone and parmigiano reggiano.  They were absolutely delectable!!!  Probably would be great also with Fontina or Asiago.  I did bake them about 20 minutes longer, no big deal, they were absolutely worth it!  Can't wait to make them again!  Thanks!

This recipe was good, but also a heart attack on a plate! The leftovers were VERY greasy - it actually made me sick! I will definately omit the butter and cut down on the cheese next time. I will also try milk instead of heavy cream.

Wow...fantastic recipe.  I used shredded Gruyere instead of provolone and added a little cayenne pepper, and everyone insisted these are the best potatoes they've ever had!  They were SO tasty.  I even forgot the butter--something I'd usually consider a crisis--and didn't miss it.  

It helps a lot to have a mandolin, though.  I wouldn't fix this dish very often if I had to slice by hand.  And if you're in the habit of peeling the potatoes, save yourself some time.  The skin of Yukon Golds practically melts anyway.

This recipe is time consuming.  It took a while to slice potatoes and garlic, and the cook time as well.  BUT it was well worth the wait!  Very good.  I added extra garlic and salt.  It was a bit greasy, but very very good.

I would have given this recipe 5 stars, but the oven temp and cook time were WAY off.  You cannot cook potaotes at 325 degrees and expect them to be done the same day.  I would suggest baking at 425 degrees for an hour.  Mine turned out to be a soupy mess.  I would cut down on the butter and cream next time. I did save the dish by putting it in the microwave for 15 minutes to get the potatoes softened.  All in all it turned out to be a tastey dish, thanks!

This potato dish is very good!!  I did omit the butter, used half and half instead of cream, and added a 1/4 cup of finely chopped onions.  KarlaLV says to use provolone in her recipe and I agree.  The smokey flavor adds a taste that cannot be had with mozzerella.  Thanks Karla!!

Ok so the flavour of this was really good..but I had to cook it for an additional hour..and even turn up the heat..I would cook it at 375 next time for the hour..but like I said as soon as I got it all together and not so soupy the flavour was fantastic.  We will make again.

Make this for Easter dinner. Substituted regular milk for the cream to make it less fatty. Also added very thin onion slices and sprinkled each layer with a bit of gravy flour and the parmesan cheese. Was gone very quickly!

I substituted colby and monterey jack for the provolone and parmesan.  Leftovers are a little unappetizing to look at since the oils separate but equally as rich and creamy.  Simple to make.  A real comfort food!

I have made this dish numerous times, the first strictly to the recipe and it was awesome! The rest I've shredded several different kinds of cheeses and lots of smoked cheeses! I've also added about triple the garlic! I've also replaced the provolone with haviarti and it worked veery well!

This really was VERY tasty for how simple it was! I froze it after preparing it in anticipation for Christmas Dinner. Turned out delicious! One of the best dishes on the table.

I have tried this recipe and it's true if you love cheese. You will love this !!! I didn't have all the cheeses but I improvise on a couple items: I use sour cream , onions, sharp cheese , pepper, and garlic powder. All in all it all gone!!

Made this dish today as a side dish for my husband's take to work dinner. Followed the directions exactly, which I feel as many others-that's how a published recipe should be rated - no changes. All we can say is WOW!!! It does have high caloric, fat & cholesterol content & the potatoes were a little al dente as per the cooking time directions. Potatoes were sliced 1/16" thick & layered in a 9"x13" casserole dish. I cooked it at 325 in a convection oven for the 30+30 minutes. I look forward to trying the suggestions from other reviewers to lighten this dish. But it was excellent & easy without all the extra steps suggested(which = extra labor, time & cleanup).

I carmelized the onions first and loved this-- Only change I would make is to boil the potatoes a bit first next time to help with cooking time and final texture.

Great recipe! Everyone loved it!  Garlic needs to be finely chopped.  I used no salt garlic powder with parsley also.I substituted a bag of 6 cheese Italian for the parmesan & provolone. This saved some $ and it tasted great! Sprinkled the last layer with parsley.

This recipe is awesome! I sliced my potatoes VERY thin with a mandolin which worked well for the texture. I crushed the garlic and minced. I just dotted the garlic throughout each layer. It was a HUGE hit! I am making this as a side for Thanksgiving dinner.... per requests!!

I followed the recipe exactly and these potatoes came out soupy, greasy and the sauce looked 'curdled'.  The flavor and smell was great, but the appearance and presentation was disappointing.  Not sure where this went wrong, because I was really excited about this recipe and the wonderful reviews it received previously.

Just made this recipe for Easter Dinner.  The potatoes were undercooked and there was too much liquid!  I put them back in the oven for an additional 30 mins and they turned out great!  My family liked then so much, they ate what they took the first time around and waited for the potatoes to finish to get seconds.

Family favorite but I made  a few changes.  Used 2.5 lbs of potatoes (approx. 5 large), substitute heavy cream with 1 c. sour cream mixed with 1 c. milk, I think this makes it less greasy.  I also pre-cook the potatoes in the microwave.  Cook with a small amount of water on high for 6 min at a time testing for tenderness, may need a total of 18 min.

These are fantastic!  The flavor was SO good, and I didn't add or change a single thing about the recipe.  This was just as good as the potatoes I love at our favorite fancy steakhouse... maybe even better.

Used half and half instead of the cream.  I had to double the recipe, took much longer to cook and I par boiled the potatoes first.  But very good.  Reheated well, too.

For a healthier version, I skipped the butter, and used half milk/half plain yogurt instead of the cream.  Turned out great!  Could have used more garlic.

This is a great recipe as is however I never have cream in the house and prefer skin milk, I make this recipe with skin milk as a sub for the cream and it still tastes fantastic I also cut back on the chedder for a lighter meal. Slice your potatos as thin as possible and it should help with cooking them through out

I am only giving this recipe a 2 because the flavor was great...if it wasn't for that it would be a 1 star. The time and heat is WAY off. Most scalloped potato recipes have the temp at 400 or 425 so I should have known that something wasn't right with a temp of 325. After almost 2 hours they were STILL not cooked all the way through and I followed this recipe to the letter. The only thing I can think of is that maybe it would cook all the way through at that temp in a convection oven?? I don't know. I will definitely have to adjust the temp next time.

I'm also not sure what the other people were eating.  They sure didn't make the recipe as posted, because it's far from a 5 as-is.  Agree with the comments on the greasy, curdled mess that many other reviewers ended up with.  I even omitted the butter entirely.

I am giving this a 2 star rating because it didn't work out, but the flavor wasn't bad. I sliced the potatoes paper thing with a mandolin, and they were still not cooked after the hour of cooking. I increased the heat to 400 and baked for an extra half hour & they came out soft, yet al dente. My rooommate makes scalloped potatoes and it said to cook at 400 for 1 1/2 hours. That is a big difference from what the instructions say here! The heavy cream was waaaaaay too much! It made a layer on top of cream and oil from the cheese & butter. The whole dish was swimming in liquid. After I placed the leftovers in the fridge, I scraped off the 1/2 inch layer of hardened cream on top! The flavors are not bad. I sliced the garlic thin, and I added thin slices of white onion. I even added more cheese than called for & it was just an average amount of cheese. I might try making this again with 1/2 the amount of cream, more cheese, and higher/longer cooking time.

The whole family loved it!  I make this every year for Xmas and Easter.  I usually cook it longer than time specified in recipe, and potatoes are still always raw.  This year, I made it the day before (1.5-2hrs) and reheated it the day of the meal.  It was fully cooked and saved me a lot of work on Easter.

I made these for Easter dinner last night and they turned out perfectly!!!  The only change I made was to turn the oven up to 350 to make sure it cooked all the way through.  Delicious will make again and again.

Oh WOW!!!  And nice that it had no flour since I eat gluten-free!  All the adults loved it.  With the garlic, it was a bit "mature" for children. I did the skim milk, fat free sour cream version.  YUMMmmmmm!

Unfortunately, I have to say that this is the worst recipe I've ever used.  I followed the instructions exactly, and ended up with something that was neither edible nor appetizing.  I think more testing needs to be done with some recipes before they're listed on the internet.    Sorely disappointed

These three cheese garlic scalloped potatoes were so good.  However you have to cook for longer than stated or use a very shallow dish.

This was decadent and delicious. You can substitute whatever cheese you want and if it's too heavy on the fat, use low fat cheese and fat free half and half. I did and it was still terrific.

Excellent recipe. I did make a few changes: I used half the cream and used garlic powder instead of cloves; turned out great! This is now a family favorite :)

The "sauce" was terrible. It curdled instead of combining with the cheese (sharp cheddar as suggested).

This was a huge hit at our family Christmas! Changes I made: -Did not use garlic, I used 1tsp of garlic salt -Did not use cream, mixed 1 cup milk with 1/2 cup of sour cream -Did not use provolone, I used sharp cheddar slices on top  I covered the dish for the first half hour to help the potatoes cook.

Mmmmmmmmm this was good!  I made the recipe pretty much as stated (I didn't measure anything because I wasn't sure how many potatoes to use) and I didn't have the right cheeses.  But, this turned out great!  I think it could have cooked just a tad longer, but I was too hungry to let it!  Anyway, I recommend making this recipe exactly as stated, it's delicious!

I cooked this dish for 1 hr. & 40 minutes and it was still undercooked, so I returned it to the oven.  Allow at least 2 hrs. to bake (I had sliced the potatoes thinly so that wasn't the problem.)  Omitted the butter due to others' complaints of greasiness and I'm glad I did.  Doubled the garlic and minced it (per suggestions) - mincing was a good idea but doubling the garlic wasn't (unless you really love garlic).

This was very good.  I added left over ham and green chopped onions to make this a meal in itself.  I used half and half instead of heavy cream but left everything else the same.

I made the receipe as given, with one minor exception, I melted the cheeses and cream in a saucepan hoping to avoid the separation mentioned in other posts. however it did still seperate. I think that medium cheddar is too sharp for the recipe as that was all I could taste and my potatoes were just slightly undercooked. Not sure if I would re-try, it was edible but not something I would serve to friends and not a recipe I would pass on or recommend.

I made this last night, and it turned out perfect!!  I used the specific ingredients that the recipe called for, and it cooked in the correct time, and nothing separated, or was uncooked.   My husband didn't like the crusty top, but I don't pay attention to that since he is just picky.  The only issue I had is not seasoning the dish properly.  Because of some of the reviews I had read here, I went easy on the salt, and I wish I had used a little more, but other than that, they were delish!!

I followed the recipe EXACTLY. I've never been so disappointed in such a highly rated recipe! Like the other one-star-raters experience, my dish was greasy, watery, curdled & separated. It was also completely raw at one hour. At 2 hours the potatoes were about 80% cooked, but the whole dish was still a greasy separated mess.  I chose this recipe because it was one step shorter than my usual recipe, which has a milk & cornstarch sauce that cooks on the stove, into which the cheese is melted. I think this step might be required to avoid the yucky cheese separation. The smell and flavor of this recipe was good, so I plan to make it again with some prep changes and less cheddar.

Great recipe!! Used freshed minced garlic and mixed it with the cream instead of slices. Added a little seasoned salt with the pepper. I used a good block of mild cheddar and grated it fresh. (always makes it better then packaged grated cheese) only used a couple TB of parmesan cheese. Bubbley and golden...it was rich but so yummy...

This recipe was awesome! I made some minor changes, I crushed the garlic instead of sliced it. I used marble, asiago, parmesean, and smoked gouda cheeses. I also added some italian bread crumbs to the top. It was just fabulous! Note: I just tried it with garlic powder instead of fresh and it was gross!

A-MA-ZING!  I made this recipe without any changes for Easter dinner and all of my guests said these were the best scalloped potatoes they have ever eaten- hands down!  Very cheesy and filling.  Extremely fatty and a little pricey...but PERFECT for a holiday/special occasion.

This dish received rave reviews at our Easter dinner.  I doubled the recipe and baked it in a 14 x 10 roaster pan. My only changes were to use half and half instead of heavy cream and melting the butter because I was using frozen garlic.  It was really delicious.  I used a mandolin to cut the potatoes uniformly to about an eighth of an inch, so I had no problem with the dish cooking properly.

Great recipe! I sliced the potatoes and boiled them in water, garlic clove, and a cup of heavy milk for about 7 minutes to start the cooking process. It cooked very well. Next time, I'll use white cheddar for a better look and experiment with different toppings. Thanks!

excellent!! I made this, instead of mashed potatoes, for our easter dinner and everyone thought it was a great addition to the dinner table.  I didn't have provolone cheese, so i just left it out and also did not have enought heavy cream and used milk, but it still turned out wonderful.

Made these for Easter dinner and they are delicious!  The parmesan layer on top gets crusty and was the best part.  I might turn on the broiler for just a few minutes to brown it up even more next time.  There's way too much butter...will use much less next time.  At the half way mark of cooking, I drained some butter with a spoon.  Did make a small change: I used a mixture of heavy cream, sour cream and 2% milk.

Talk about frustrating! I read many of the reviews and was pumped to make this recipe for my family for Easter. I timed it for 2 hrs to make sure it was done at the same time everything else was that I served. After 1 1/2 hr. I kicked up the temp.because the potatoes were still raw! Yes, I followed the recipe to a T. I always do when I try a new one. After 2 hr. and 45 min. AND after we were all done eating, they were finally cooked. Don't think I'll try this one again!

These were a huge disappointment - sorry!  I doubled the recipe and when I removed them from the oven they were basically partly-cooked potatoes in milky, greasy butter.  I tried to get them then to cook in the microwave since the rest of my dinner was ready, but no matter how long I cooked them, I couldn't get them to cook through and the sauce never thickened.  I had high hopes for these, too.  I had to throw them out :(

This recipe is very tasty, but a bit watery.  I'm not sure if it's me, but I've made it twice now and it was a bit watery both times.

This recipe was a HIT for my Christmas Eve Feast! I followed every step of the directions and it came out so rich and delicious! My family ate it all up. I will make these potatoes from now on and the ONLY thing I will change is making a double batch so we can have left-overs.

Very rich, but very good recipe.  I probably liked it more than the rest of my family. Next time I will still butter dish, but leave out additional butter.  Enough fat in the cheese and cream.  Fat was starting to rise on the casserole dish while baking. I took a paper towel and tried to soak up as much as I could.  Needed to cook longer than specified to finish cooking potatoes. Very good with ham.

Very cheesy!  I used skim milk and fat free sour cream.  Also added garlic to creamy mixture.  Boiled potatoes about 15 minutes before slicing.  Baked 45 min. covered, then uncovered for another 25-30.

I cooked the potatoes first, added onion and now would make a white sauce add the cheeses and heat.  Tasted wonderful.

Not sure if I didn't cut them thin enough, but I let them sit in a pan with water for about 10 mins, baked covered with foil 30 mins and then uncovered for 40 mins and they were still crunchy. I did sub the milk and sour cream for the cream, which I thought was a great idea.

This is the stuff!! You've gotta try it! I added onion, sour cream and extra cheese. Also, I used shredded pizza cheese, which has all the best cheeses mixed together! I made a large dish of this recipe and the guys I had over freaked out! They chomped up the entire dish in one sitting! It was the Best scalloped potatoes I've ever had!!! 5 Stars all the way!! Also, if u want to switch it up a bit from time to time u could put some meat in it. But it doesn't need anything at all. Oh! And you can't forget to precook the potatoes, or you'll have your dish in the oven forever!! So, don't cook them all the way through, just about half way cooked through. You'll be Super glad ya did! ;)

Only made one change to half and half instead of heavy cream, and no cheese on top- it was watery and not a hit.

Very good. I'm not a fan of potatoes (hubby loves them) but even I thought these were good.  Didnt have any provalone, but used mixed cheese and the parm. Also added onion and bacon.  Will make again!

I followed the recipe exactly and the dish was way too soupy! I also cooked at a higher temp (330) for at least an additional 10 minutes. The potatoes were still not quite done. The flavors in the recipe were very good, so I am willing to try it again. I wanted to try the original recipe before altering it with the other suggested reviews.

This is a great recipe!! I tried it tonight and it was a hit with everyone. I had picked up a cooked chicken at the grocery store and made this dish to go along with it. Very easy to make, the only thing I changed was I used a pint of half & half cream instead of the heavy cream; the only reason for that was the price for the heavy cream was $3.00 a pint (I really think they had it priced incorrectly). Also I diced the garlic instead of slicing. The next time I make this, most likely next week, I am going to put a layer or two of sweet onions in it. Really this is a super great recipe. Thanks to the person that submitted and shared it; it is appreciated!!!

I made these potatoes tonight to serve alongside some BBQ'd porkchops and they were really good.  I minced the garlic instead of slicing it (and mixed it in with the cream) and I didn't use provolone cheese (just cheddar and parm, and about half the amount of cheddar called for).  The only complaint(s) I had were that I had to cook my potatoes about an hour and fifteen minutes (could have used an hour and a half) and the end result was way too greasy.  I'm actually surprised nobody has really mentioned this.  There is no need for the butter in this dish, there is enough richness with the cheese and the heavy cream, the butter just makes it greasy.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I used the FF sour cream/skim milk mix substitution for heavy cream.  Next time I'll add an extra clove of garlic for more flavor...  Thanks!

Very good recipes but a bit heavy and greasy for my taste-next time I will use half and half and cut back on the butter dollops in between layering.  Otherwise this was a very decadent Easter side dish and was enjoyed by all

Very good flavor.  I wound up having to bake this an additional 10 minutes because the potatoes were still a bit crunchy after 1 hour.  I will definitely make this again.

The potatoes did not cook thoroughly after one hour of baking, but I doubled the recipe.  Also, because of all the cheese, there was a gross layer of grease on top of the potatoes.  That being said, the potatoes had a wonderful flavor.  I'd be interested in substituting the cream for something less fattening.  I substituted garlic powder for the garlic slices, just because it was easier for me.

Mostly followed the recipe faithfully except for a few points.  We used regular old russet potatoes out of the bag we keep in the closet and since you can never have enough garlic, imho, we added much more than was called for.  It turned out great.  At Easter, people were serving themselves heaping spoonfuls of seconds.  Unfortunately, I'm in the middle of a workplace "biggest loser" contest so I was only able to taste a modest portion but it made it all the better. :)

Excellent flavors!  Like other reviewers, it took about 2 hours to bake.  I will be making this recipe again, but next time I will definitely boil the potatoes for a little bit before baking!!  Other than the substantial time difference, great recipe!

I made these yesterday for easter dinner.  I didn't want to work at slicing potatoes so I bought hash browns instead and it turned out delicious.  I also used half and half so it wasn't so "heavy".  My family loved the subtle garlic flavor.  Will definetly save this recipe and use it again.

This recipe is very good and very versatile. I made a few changes that my entire family and boyfriend went nuts over! I didn’t have any garlic on hand so on each layer instead of layering the garlic slices I sprinkled garlic powder. And I used a combination of sharp cheddar cheese and 2% Velveta Cheese on each layer. I had to put aluminum foil on top for the last hour of baking since it took about 2 hours to cook and I didn’t want the cheeses to burn. It was well worth the two hours because it just melts in your mouth! I think the next time I make this I will use pepper jack cheese and add some bacon to it!

These potatoes were excellent.  I thought I sliced the potatoes pretty thin, but even after cooking for 2 hours, they were still a little crunchy. That won't stop me from making them again, though.  Maybe boil them a bit before cooking them.  I also added onions and doubled the garlic...yummy!

This was my first time making scalloped potatoes and it came out great! The changes I made was I parboiled the potatoes first before putting them in the oven. They only took about an hour and tasted great. I used mozzarella instead of provalone and it was still good. I will make this again.

I covered the dish with foil for the first 30 minutes, as suggested by other reviewers; however, the potatoes still did not cook thoroughly (and I used a food processor to slice them so they should have been thin enough).  Also, the cream curdled into chunks so instead of creamy potatoes we had regular potatoes with cheese chunks.  I think I'll go back to scalloped potatoes from the box.

Nice side dish, but I was looking for a vegetarian entree.  The cheese combo was bland compared to my mom's cheddar scalloped potatos.  I used half and half and was careful to use the exact amounts that were called for, but it was greasy and heavy. Not worth the fat for the bland taste.

This was great!!  Only thing I did was to be overzealous with the cheddar and onions, it came out toooo rich, next time, not sooo much cheddar and onions, perhaps just follow the recipe as is...except I always use more garlic.

Very good. I didn't have heavy cream so I used buttermilk with 1 tbsp of flour mixed in. Didn't use provolone. 2 cups of cheddar was cheesy enough! added ham so family ate it for breakfast with ketchup on it....loved it!

tried this recipe twice...just didn't work for me...potatoes just never cooked evenly and cheese got hard...maybe if it was cooked, covered, for a while it would be more creamy and tender?

THIS WAS A GOOD RECIPE.  THE ONLY THING DIFFERENT THAT I DID WAS BOILED THE POTATOES FOR 30 MINS TO SOFTEN THEM JUST ENOUGH TO CUT IN THE CASSEROLE DISH. CRUSHED THE GARLIC INSTEAD OF SLICING. GOOD FOR HOLIDAYS

I tried these last night, and I must tell you they are the greasiest mess of scalloped potatoes that I have ever made.  There is no flour to bind the cream, and with the added cheese and butter, everything separated and while it tasted ok, I would never serve it to company.  It would have required a water bath at a low temperature for an extraordinary long time to cook the potates and they were sliced thin.   I will never make this recipe again.

Made this as a side dish for Christmas dinner. Very easy to make and very tasty, but a little too salty for me. I don't think I needed to add salt to it at all because of the cheese. Family raved and took home leftovers, but if I make it again I will omit the salt and mince the garlic instead of slicing.

So disappointed...sounded awesome but I obviously did something wrong.  Not nearly saucy enough...almost dry...I did put them in a 9x13 pan and did the tin foil thing - and cooked about 75mins so maybe next time I would use the same pan, do tin foil but only cook for about 50-60mins??  Taste was good.

If it wasn't for 3+ hour cooking time, I would've given this recipe five stars.  By the time it got done cooking, the cheese was burnt on top.  I will definitely try some of the suggestions about par boiling or microwaving the potatoes prior to baking.  I used the wide slot grater on my 4-sided grater, so the potatoes were very thin.  I'm not sure why they took so long to cook.  Besides the cooking problem, this dish tasted great and I look forward to perfecting and making many more times.

This tasted great but it took way longer than the recipe said.  I read the reviews and planned on a longer cooking time, but this was in the oven for 90+ minutes and still wasn't done!  I finally put it in the microwave so we could eat.

These turned out wonderful, my only change being to double the sliced garlic.  They were creamy, cheesy and delicious.  I didn't have a problem with the potatoes not cooking - they just need to be sliced very thin! I loved the Parmesean "crust" on the top.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

I thought this was a great dish, much less sodium than anything in a box. I wanted to cut back on the fat so I used  fat free evaporated milk instead of cream in the same measurements and it worked very well. I sliced the potato's thin with a mandolin and it cooked in the right amount of time and the texture was good. I chopped the garlic instead of slicing and it was good but not overpowering. I did not find the milk separation or the grease on the top  that others reported ( perhaps because of the cream substitution? ) I thought it was quick and easy and very tasty.I will make it again.

I was not too impressed with this recipe. The flavor was good and the garlic was great but the curdling of the cream and cheese was very unappetizing. I also par boiled the potatos to cut down on baking time. I won't be making this again.

This recipe rocks! I made these potatoes as a side dish for my Christmas prime rib roast. They were awesome! I will definitely use this recipe again and again. My whole family raved and the left overs were even better the next day! Thanks for sharing. YUMMY!!

These were very good. I made these for a girls night and everyone loved them. I used half and half over the cream and they were still very rich. Next time I'm going to add some more seasoning because they needed just a little something more.

Since we're garlic fans, I doubled the garlic cloves. I didn't have any Provelone cheese so I used smoked gruyere. I'm not a scallopped potatoes fan but these were delicious. This recipe's definitely a keeper.

Looks delicious, and was pretty good.. just so much flavour, though - so unbelievably rich that you really couldn't (at least I couldn't) have this recipe too often... boyfriend also gave it a 4 because he didn't love the grease/milk curdling effect... overall, not bad! Thanks!

Loved this recipe.  I'm not big on scalloped potatoes.  The garlic made all the difference.  I used Asiago cheese on top just to give it a little something different.

The taste was good, but I used milk instead of cream because that's what I had, and my milk separated(?) There was like water in the pan as well as this white goo....didn't look terribly appetizing, but as I said, tasted ok. Will try again to see if it comes out better.

Well the taste was pretty good, however they looked bad.  There was a lot of grease and the cream curdled.  If you don't mind looking at them, the taste was good.  I would make in a bigger longer dish to spread things out.

I rarely rate so low on recipes but this just didnt seem right. I followed the recipe exactly and my milk still curdled...it was super greasy EVEN after I cut down on the cheese, used lowfat milk and cut down on the butter! There seemed to be too much milk too as I had to pour some out after 1/2 hour of cooking. Then I baked for another 1/2 hour. Tasted Ok but looked really bad

We thought this was ok. My boyfriend liked it more than I did, thus three stars vs. two. It was greasy. I never thought there was such a thing as too much cheese, but this had too much cheese which made it greasy, I believe. I solved the cooking time problem by microwaving the potatoes for five minutes after I sliced them. This cut the oven cooking time considerably. I cooked it for about 1 hour and 15 min.

I made this recipe without provolone...worried a little about the time because of reviews so I cooked it about 15 minutes more. This was awesome and my whole family loved it. I didn't get the "greasy" other reviewers talked about.  My daughter called me the next day and leftovers were even better. Cooking again tonight. My family thinks I am an awesome cook.. thanks to this site..they don't have a clue about my little secret..lol

These were not edible. These potatoes were greasy and expensive. Such a waste of time.

Very good and easy to make.  I used half and half instead of cream. My family raved about it and everyone had seconds.  Next time I will add a fresh spice like rosemary to give it a little more taste.

I omitted the butter completely after reading other reviews, and used half and half.  It turned out good!  Even though I used the special grater/slicer to make the potatoes super thin, I still had to bake for an extra half hour, and it's still not QUITE done....I'd cook at 375 next time.  Overall, they taste quite good though, and are good leftovers as well.  :)

I didn't care for this recipe at all.  There were several things that didn't appeal to me.  The cheeses and garlic caused it to be very pungent smelling and tasting.  It was also greasier than I expected.  My family are garlic lovers but this called for tooooo much.  But, to each their own.

These are really good.The only changes I made was I used dried potatoes from a box because that was what I had.I also crushed sour cream and onion chips on top before baking them.Thanks for the great recipe!

These are great!  I need to cook them longer, though.  I have pre-cooked the potatoes with good results.  I also like to use chopped garlic and warm it in the cream while slicing the potatoes.  My son is a firefighter and when its his turn to cook, he always makes a baked ham and these potatoes.  He has to at least double the recipe.  There are never any leftovers. Has anyone tried cooking these in a slow cooker?

Wonderful!  The provolone did not melt so great on top but still a new delicious potato dish with the ham I cooked.  Only added a little Cajun seasoning to spice it up.  Will make again!

Very good! The best I have tasted. I added more garlic and used mozzarella instead of provolone cheese. I also baked it at 350 for 90 minutes. Even though these were so very good I will use milk instead of the cream and I will cut the butter because this is defiantly heart attack food... Thanks for the great recipe!!!!!

We were very disappointed in these potatoes. First off, Yukon's take a long time to cook, so I'd recommend you pre-cook the potatoes unless you have a mandoline and can slice them paper thin. (I didn't know this at the time.) I used my Cuisinart and they were sliced very thinly, but even with that, I cooked them for an extra 30 min. and still they weren't done. I had company, and needed to serve dinner, so zapped them in the microwave for awhile and STILL they were "al dente". (Which is not how you want your potatoes!) They just tasted garlicy to me, I didn't pick up on anything special or yummy. Maybe with addt'l cooking the flavors would've melded, but I'd keep looking for a different and better recipe.

I loved this, I tweaked it a bit, I love to cook, I had to.  I increased the cooking time, decreased the cream (added a little 2% milk though) and added VE's 3 onion and VE's roasted garlic.  My family loved it !!!! So did I. Thanks for sharing KarlaLV!!!!

Absolutely wonderful.  I omitted the provolone cheese (I couldn't find it at the grocery store) and just added extra shredded cheddar cheese.  A big hit with the family.

This recipe was wonderful. I made it for Easter dinner and got rave reviews. I will definately be making this again. After reading the reviews though, I did change a few things. First, I raised the oven temp to 375 degrees and cooked for 1 hour; this allowed for thorough doneness.  Second, instead of garlic slices, I used garlic powder.

Made this for Eater Sunday and it was fantastic.  Used chopped garlic in each layer.  Used grated cheddar cheese between layers and sliced manchego on top.  Partially cooked at 325 degrees and partially cooked at 350 degress.  Topped with grated parmesan.  It was excellent!!!

AMAZING potatoes (but definitely not the healthiest.) I will definitely be making these again though :)I minced my garlic (instead of slicing) and sprinkled it over the potatoes when called for. Thanks Karla!

These were so great I can't wait to take the recipe "on the road". My deli guy had a great suggestion with a sharp provolone from Boar's Head that I hadn't tried before and he sliced it very thin- it melted BEAUTIFULLY and tasted divine with fresh grated parmesan on top for the golden crust. I always add extra fresh garlic but other than that did not tinker except to raise the temp of the oven for the last half to accomodate another dish, causing the cream to bubble up a bit through the top crust of cheese. This recipe was a smashing success! Thanks!

This was great! I did change it a little, based on the ingredients I had on hand. I layered grated cheddar cheese and swiss between the layers. Instead of garlic slices, I just sprinkled a little garlic powder between the layers. I also chopped up a couple of tablespoons of onion and layered them in. Instead of cream I used milk with about 3 heaping tablespoons of flour mixed into it, then poured it over the top of the potatoes. I also added grated cheddar cheese to the top the last 30 minutes of cooking. Great recipe and will definitely be a keeper in my house! Thanks!

These potatoes are so good. Don't skimp on the garlic, it adds such a great flavor. I only made one change,I didnt have any provolone cheese so I used hot pepper cheese, it worked great. These are worth the extra time, no way do the box potatoes compare!!

Delish!  Note:  When cooking big portions, it is best to separate the two layers.  Otherwise the potatoes will not cook well and the heavy cream will stay runny.  Also, you do not need that much butter for large portions.  I recently made this dish for Thanksgiving dinner.  It was such a hit, that I cooked it again for Thanksgiving lunch at work!

This recipe was awesome. I just got done making it. I don't usually add extra things, but I had ham left over from the other night so I added it. Also I asked the male of the house to go get me a package of cheddar cheese that would be enough for two cups. He came home with an 8oz package. :p Anyways I used that and a cup of mozzarella to make up for it. And I did add a little bit of minced onion too..DELICIOUS! I am serious..This was the best!

Excellent!  I made without provolone cheese since I didn't have any and I cooked a little longer than recipe stated, top and edges were nice and crispy.  Soooo good.

I HAVE made this the original way AND now have made NEEDED modifications. 
1. Eliminate butter altogether. 
2. Double the garlic
3. 6-8 slices Provolone 
4.  PEEL potatoes and slice SUPER THIN
5. 9 x 13 GLASS pan
6. Round 1 - 400 degrees COVERED with no Parmesan for 45 minutes. 
7. Round 2 - Add Parmesan and cook uncovered 350 degrees for 30. 
*may need up to 15 min more covered after round 2. Depending on how thick the potatoes were sliced. 
BEST POTATOES EVER!

Made this recipe for Christmas dinner and it was a hit! The most difficult part of this recipe is cutting the potatoes, which would be significantly with a mandolin. I only made two minor modifications to the recipe. I used a bit more potatoes than called for. and instead of heavy cream, I used half & half (because it was cheaper to buy a larger container of half & half than to buy pints of each). I'll try again with heavy cream, but don't expect much difference.

These are sooo good! Making them a second time tonight adding  scallions and chives - my boys ate all of them last time! I didn’t add as much cheese as recipe and didn’t use provolone last time and it was still delish - this time I’m putting 2 slices on top because I have it to use

I made some changes to the original recipe.  I added some queso cheese and it gave it a little kick.  And I added onion. Everyone enjoyed it.

I have made these potatoes 3 times following the recipe exactly.  Every time it has taken about 90 minutes for them to be done.  I do 45 minutes with a foil cover, then add Parmesan and bake another 45 minutes uncovered.  They are good and they obtain a nice crust.

I do wonder what else could be added to give them just a tad more flavor.  Bacon bits?  Scallions?  Onions or some dried onion soup?  More garlic?

DO NOT MAKE THIS!
The recipe is horrible.
I wish I had read the negative reviews, as they are SPOT ON!

This recipe uses way too much cream (which WILL break) not enough salt, no flour (?wtf?) and the cooking time should be 2- 2.5 hours. 

Do yourself a favor,  find another recipe. 
This one should be deleted from the database,  or at least the rating made HONEST!

I preboiled my potatoes about 5 minutes adding then drained them. I prepared my roux and added white pepper and nutmeg.  After roux was made completely I added fresh nutmeg to it.  

I will definitely make this again.  Thanks for s great recipe.

The flavor of this is delicious, and like other reviewers, it's wise to let bake for at least 1.5 hours or the potatoes will be hard. I also added some sour cream and mixed it with some (I did not use the entire recommended amount) cream and then added the minced garlic. Next time I make this, it'll be even better.

This recipe has not turned out right 75% of the time. Either the temperature is too low, or the blanching is absolutely necessary. Potatoes are always too hard.

I can't say if these are good or not as it didn't work out. The bake time in the recipe is way off and completely ruined our holiday meal. At 325F the potatoes were still just luke warm after 45 min so I upped the temp to 375. Within 10 minutes the cream was curdled and the whole thing went into the garbage. What a waste :(

Easy and delicious!  I didn't have fresh garlic, so I mixed jarred minced garlic with the cream before pouring the cream over, and it turned out very well.  Also, I may reduce the cream to about 1.5 cups the next time I make it... which will be soon.

Followed the suggestions and used 1 cup sour cream with 1 cup milk instead of the heavy cream.  I would recommend cooking for 1.5 hours  instead of 1 hour. Also cut the potatoes really thin. I used a sudoku knife.  Also added some minced onion.

This is very good. I left the skin on the potatoes and they were cooked fine. I did boil them a few minutes before slicing. I also used half cream/half sour cream with the sliced garlic and a little bit of diced onion mixed in. I sprinkled a little bit of chives on also. Will definitely be making this again!

Everyone loved it!  I was a little concerned as I had never made scalloped potatoes without flour or onions but the garlic and cheese made it delicious!  I made it as directed but cooked it at 350 instead of 325 as the roast I was cooking needed to be cooked at 350.  I'm looking forward to having the (hardly any) leftovers for lunch!

I'll definitely make this again as it was great.  I had a few small changes:

1.  Because of other people's feedback I didn't use the butter and certainly didn't miss it so that was good advice.  
2.  I put 3 layers but the potatoes were more evenly spaced than the video showed and only one wedge thick per layer.  
3.  I loved the Ramano cheese on the top but it was a little difficult to cut through so next time I may grate some or possibly use thinner slices.  
4.  I also minced the garlic as I don't like biting into a large chunk of garlic in one bite and nothing in another.

Made this to go with our Easter dinner.  Rave reviews.  I decided to blanch the potatoes first and was SO glad I did.  Potatoes came out perfectly soft, but not mushy.  Took the advice of some others and substituted 1 cup of sour cream and 1 cup of skim milk for the heavy cream.  The sour cream gave it just the right amount of zip. Used sharp cheddar, too.  I've never found a scalloped potato recipe that we liked - until now.  Thanks for a delicious recipe!

My family lovedddd this recipe!!! Now I make it for every family dinner! A mandalin comes in handy for the potatoes. And I have had a great experience with cooking it the night before and heating/serving the next day. My grandma said she would choose to eat this over desserts, if that gives you any idea :) I made the recipe exactly as it is and it turns out perfect every time. ALSO, I use the jar of already chopped garlic and use a spoon to spread over the potatoes. Little things like that make it much easier to prepare this while you are cooking ham/turkey and other sides.

This was HANDS DOWN, the best scalloped potato recipe in recent times.  I added diced onion to the layers and also added the minced garlic, salt and pepper with my cream.  The scents from my kitchen were mesmerizing.  I used a mandolin to slice the potatoes super thin.  Thanks for sharing this AWESOME RECIPE.

This is a fantastic recipe! First time I ever made scalloped potatoes and they turned out wonderful. The only changes I made was to mix the cream with the seasonings and garlic so it was easier to layer with.

Made this last night. I used a bit more potatoes and provolone cheese and added a bit of sliced onion and about 2 cups of cubed ham.

When testing the "doneness" of the potatoes, I apparently didn't test in enough places. About 1/2 of the potatoes were cooked appropriately, the rest were a bit under-cooked. Total cooking time was 70 minutes.

I was surprised at how much liquid there was especially considering that I used a fair amount of additional potatoes than what the recipe called for. In the future I would cut back on the cream to about 1/2 of what is called for.

Made this today for Easter Brunch. I did make these changes to minimize the fat content. Doubling the recipe, I used about 10 potatoes, 4 cloves of garlic, used 3 cups of 2% milk instead of the heavy cream, used half the amount of each of the three cheeses called for (cheddar, provolone, and parmesan) and no butter. They turned out great! (And will be replacing the old traditional recipe I've been using for ages!!) (5 stars from me, with these changes)

The flavour is really good, however, the cheese texture turned out lumpy and the potatoes were not done and sitting in a lot of liquid. I made them again but had to add a flour slurry to thicken it up. The cheese was still separated and the potatoes although sliced thin did the not cook. Wouldn't serve this for guests.

I made these potatoes last night with baked fish.  It came out very good, only because I read quite a few of the reviews and made the adjustments .
  I baked the whole thing at at 400 degrees, for 1 hour total.  The first 1/2 hour was covered with sprayed foil (underside only), the foil removed for the last 1/2 hour, and let to bake till crust formed on top. 
 I didn't use cream, but I used a reduced amount (1/1/2 cups) of Kefir, which is like a liquid yoghurt, also I used 4 cloves of garlic. 
 All in all the dish came out very good, cheesy, with a bit of tang, and brilliant crusty topping. 
 Next time I will add onion and a bit of cayenne to perk it up a  little.  Relatively easy to put together, worth a try. 
 A menu suggestion would be to make this with something that doesn't compete with the richness of this dish.

These were pretty tasty, and much easier than my mom's way of making scalloped potatoes, but not quite as satisfying as hers. I'll probably stick with the family recipe from now on.

This recipe was easy and fantastic! I used the comments to make some changes, and I think they were the right ones! 1 cup sour cream and 1 cup milk instead of the heavy cream - also I didn't have any provolone so I just left it out and it was still plenty cheezy!

Ok, just put it in the oven, update to come!
So far, will need double the cheese & garlic. Used a 9x13 dish, and 6 slices of provolone (not 4). Milk seemed fine, covered as well with foil. Update once done!


Ok, after 30 minutes, potatoes are hard; cut them on a mandolin-type thingy; are they not thin enough? Going another 20 minutes, but seems soupy....update to come!


I got impatient after 17 minutes; potatoes more done, but still need more. Nice browning cheese on top! Seems greasy though....concerned about this.

I used one cup of half and half instead of heavy cream- sprinkled parmesan on each layer to thicken the sauce  because I was afraid the dish would be watery- also substituted garlic powder for the cloves -don't really think the butter is necessary- took way too long to cook at 325 so bumped temp up to 375  and covered with foil- even my husband liked it!

So...This is great. I love cheese. I love potatoes. I love garlic. I omitted the provolone because i didnt have it. I used chopped garlic from the store. I melted the butter just because i didnt want to get my fingers greasy. A mandolin slicer is necessary! i almost dropped the whole thing in the floor trying to sneak a bite before I got caught. The dog is enjoying what did drip out of the casserole dish...

This is really a 5 star after making modifications.  But I wanted to rate the recipe base as a 4.  

We loved this.  I used suggestions of others and did 1 c. skim and 1c sour cream (I did not use fat free).  I also used minced garlic and i mixed it in with the milk/sour cream mixture, along with salt and pepper.  The only thing I only cooked it for 1 hr 15 min.  Next time we'll do a full hour and a half.  

We are eating the leftovers tonight with meatloaf.

Delicious! Each time my husband eats the leftovers he raves about them just like he was eating them for the first time. Guess these will have to be my go-to potato recipe. His son made them so it can't be that hard. It's a keeper.

Thiswas awesome. Made for Easter dinner at in laws. I was nervous that the potatoes would not be done enough but they turned out great. I really think cooking in the stoneware helped because I had to take it out a lil early as to not be late. Stoneware takes a bit to cool so it cooked on the way over. I did add crumbled bacon and onions to the layers along with the garlic. There was barely any left and my family asked me to leave that for them to eat later. Thanks.

The flavor was absolutely wonderful but I did have a couple issues. It was a bit greasy and too liquidy, I had to drain out some of the grease before serving. So next time I will probably not use butter, if I do I would use very little. I'll probably use half and half like some of the other reviews suggested and you must slice the potatoes REALLY REALLY thin. Mine were thin and it still took more like 1:15 to cook

This potato recipe was very disappointing.  I followed the directions exactly.  You would think with all of the cheese and cream and butter it would be a sure thing, but it was much too creamy (and not in a good, yummy way).  It needed some herbs and some more flavor.  Don't waste your time AND calories!

I had the same experience with having a lot of oil floating around the dish. I tipped the casserole dish to the side in my sink and let most of the oil drain out.  It was very tasty- but I think I am going to look for an alternative to the cheddar cheese- maybe Kraft American cheese? Something that melts smoothly without producing all the oil.  I also substituted minced garlic for fresh garlic - just based on what was available in my pantry.  Overall it was very filling and very delicious.

Super easy and so delicious! I followed advice to cook covered for the first 30 min until adding the parm. Then uncovered the second 30. To allow it to thicken up some more, I turned off the heat after an hour, but left it in the oven until it was the consistency we prefer (about 30-45 min). We shared with company...everyone asked for the recipe. 5 Stars

Due to the many reviews saying that this dish was so greasy I decided to make it using 1 cup table cream (18%) and 1 cup 1% milk. What a disaster!!! The sauce separated into curds and whey instead of the desired creamy sauce. It still tasted pretty good and thank god wasn't made for company, but lesson learned. If I try this again I'll definitely use all heavy cream. Don't make my mistake! Had to cook covered for 2.5 hours at 325* to make potatoes tender.

These turned out great I added bacon because I just wanted to get rid of it! I usually use another recipe that takes so long to cook. I did cover with tinfoil for 1/2 the cooking time and used milk/sour cream.

While it tasted good - I was so grossed out at the amount of grease and fat in this dish.  I spooned off a bowl full of grease and wish I had read the reviews before I made it exactly according to the directions.  With 187 mg of cholesterol and 747 mg of Sodium I will not be making this recipe again.  Very disappointed.  Heart attack on a plate!

Excellent and cheesy!  Definitely a holiday dish. We get raves on it. The best way to get the potatoes nice and thin is to use an apple-peeler-corer machine (its a hand crank that does all of that for you in seconds).

Excellent!  I did change the recipe slightly after reading reviews:  I cut the cream in half and in its place whisked together one cup of sour cream and one cup of milk.  I also covered the dish while baking with foil and sprayed the underside so that the cheese wouldn't stick.  We had not problems with underdone potatoes.  Everyone came back for seconds!!

These potatoes were a greasy, bland mess.  I actually poured grease off before serving them and they were still greasy.  I couldn't even taste the potatoes in all the grease and cheese.  I might consider making them again but with significantly less cheese, more spice and sour cream instead of the heavy cream.

Made this today for a family Christmas gathering and I was very disappointed.  I followed the directions as listed and ended up with a soupy undercooked bland concoction.  Based on the ratings, I was expecting a lot more from this recipe!

I made this dish last night for a family party. Everyone loved it! So much so that they asked me to make it for Christmas. The only change was to use 1/2n1/2 based other reviews. Also, since I doubled the batch I had to cook it about 1/2 hour longer (the last 1/2 hour I turned the temp up to 400 to get the top slightly browned and bubbly..turned out perfect, not too liquidy.

These were sooo delicious! I did not read any of the reviews before I made them and I'm glad I didn't. Followed the recipe exactly except that I only had 1 c. of heavy cream on hand, so just put 1/2 c. on each layer, otherwise changed nothing. Baked for an hour and they were done fine, except for a few potatoes that I didn't cut very thin, but that was my fault. I was really surprised to read some of the bad reviews for this. I would definitely reccommend trying these and I know I will be making them again and again.

I followed this recipe exactly, and there was far too much liquid, and the potatoes remained undercooked, even though I left it in for much longer than called for. Not sure what went wrong, but the flavor was delicious.

I'm a garlic fiend, a cheese fiend, and a potato fiend...this certainly sated my hunger for all three! Only problems: the cheeses had a strange consistency and the Romano cheese on top didn't give me the crust I was hoping for.

Totally incredible.  I used different cheeses, because that's what I had.  It came out so creamy and delicious - the sauce was almost like Alfredo sauce.  Fantastic.  Thank you!

I did not follow the exact recipe. Simply used the potatoes, seasoning, garlic, cheese and cream and layered in a baking dish and cooked for 1.5 hours. DEELISH!

I love these potatoes. I substituted half of the heavy cream with milk. I also covered it with foil while baking. They definitly took longer than an hour to cook fully. I would say about an hour and a half. Leave yourself plenty of time for them to cook. I've made them twice and the second time I didn't leave enough time and they didn't cook all the way. :( Other than that I followed the recipe.

I didn't alter this recipe much except by maybe hand cutting potatoes into what I thought were VERY thin slices, and as others have said, took well over 2 hours to cook even with upping the temp and still firm potatoes, I will stick to the boxed scalloped potatoes after this disaster. Maybe I did something wrong but not sure what? We are at 9,000 feet, maybe that had something to do with it.

Slice the potatoes thin for more even baking.  You will need to bake them for at least as long as it says, and even more doesn't hurt.  I wasn't ready with the rest of the meal when the timer beeped, so I just left them in (another 1/2 hour) and they were just right.  A few of the thicker ones could have been cooked longer.  The provolone on top is absolutely fantastic.  I don't know what they mean by 4 slices.  I bought a brick of provolone and sliced it up and just covered the top.

Super recipe - SO YUMMY! I had everything set and ready to make and then realized I only had a handful of cheddar!  I sub'd some Italian blend shredded cheese, some extra parm and even a dash of quesadilla cheese (lol) along with the provolone.  Other than that twist, made as directed and they were a smashing success.

I followed this recipe exactly, and I did find that it was very tasty--especially the top crust from the parmesan cheese. I am rating it 5 stars because it was creamy, comforting, and delicious--but, next time I am going to follow other users' recommendations and use half-and-half (maybe fat free?) and/or sour cream. My husband and his friends loved it, but it was way too heavy for me.

Best scalloped potatoes I've ever had! Delish!! Like others, I boiled the potatoes for a few minutes before slicing them. Also, used 1 cup of sour cream and 1 cup of milk instead of using the heavy cream and added more garlic (minced)

Wonderful potatoes! Only change was I doubled the garlic (as we love it).  Be sure to slice all potatoes very thin so they cook through evenly.  The browned, cheesy topping is marvelous!  I did use the suggested sharp cheddar, fresh grated parmesan & provolone.  Went great served with the Roast Sticky Chicken-Rotisserie Style (from this site), nice green salad, sliced tomatoes, and fresh french bread with butter.

I've used less butter and a little more butter different times.  I had it turn out a little watery both times.  It also took a little long the first couple times I made it.  However, I used the parboiling idea and it worked like a charm.  Definitely recommend that.

I had high hopes with the recipe. I did make a few substitutions based on reviews (no cream- skim milk/sour cream combo instead) and I also used a garlic press for the garlic vs. slicing it. It smelled great and the flavors were nice but my big issue was how long it took to cook- over 90 minutes (and we had sliced the potatoes really thin) with some crunchiness still. If I had had to bring this to a party, or had used it as part of a holiday meal, for example, I would have been in huge trouble. So while I thought it was fairly good, there's room for improvement.

I'm on the fence about this recipe.  It was pretty tasty but it took much longer than stated to cook (2 hours) and the cream and cheese were very separated.  I'd get a bite of creamy potato, then a bite of cheesy potato.  Not bad, just not what I wanted.  Next time I make this I will try to make a sauce with the cream and cheese to evenly cover all the potatoes.  Over all flavor was great so I'm giving it a four because my problems are fixable with some trial and error, and are not necessarily issues with the recipe itself.

Very good! I also substituted f/f sour cream mixed with skim milk for the heavy cream to cut fat/calories.  I mixed it until it was the right consistency, about 3/4 cup sour cream to 1/4 cup skim.  It came out a wee bit too runny, but scalloped potatoes usually are more thickened the next day anyway.  They were delicious! I will definitely make it again....the same way, the runny-ness didnt bother us because the flavour was so good!

I loved the recipe and my family thought it was great. My only change would be to decrease the cheese a bit or the butter. It ended up being very greasy from all the melted cheese. Tasted great, but not very good for the waist line! All in all excellent recipe. thanks!

I tried this as written: it was soupy but tasty enough to try again with the sour cream variation.  It was soupier, and underdone.

Fantastic! Everyone at the table loved it. I didn't exactly follow all the measurements, especially when it came to how much cheese to use (I used more). I would recommend a good sharp cheddar (aged 6 or more years if you can find it) too. Definately will make again.

Great recipe! I was a bit scared due to some of the other reviews but I made a few changes based on what I thought my family would like and it turned out great! I think the best tip was the "par boil" which I have never done before. Thanks

I really wasn't impressed with this one. I mixed the garlic with the cream like another review suggested and I added about 1 cup mozzarella. I baked this at 350, covering for the first half an hour, but it turned out more like soup and some of the potatoes still were not cooked enough. I will not make again, but thanks for the recipe anyway.

My biggest complaint about this recipe is that it turned out very greasy.  If I make it again, I'll leave out the butter.  Also, after cooking for 1.5 hours, the potatoes were still crunchy (despite being thin cut).

This was good, but after one serving, I couldn't eat it on consecutive days because it made me feel a little queasy.  I think it was too rich / heavy because of all the cheese and the heavy cream.

This recipe was okay.  I followed the recipe exactly -- the only change I made was that I doubled the quantity.  I was expecting the results to be much tastier -- my kitchen smelled great while the dish was baking, but the taste was disappointingly bland.

The flavor was really good, but it had a weird texture.  The butter seperated from the cream which curdled slightly.  So instead of a creamy cheesy sauce it was kind of a greasy chunky sauce.  I followed the recipe as originally submitted and will keep a hold of it but follow some of the other reviewers suggestions next time.

I made this recipe on Christmas Eve, since I was in a real hurry, I didn't follow the recipe exactly.  I used the exact ingredients the recipe called for, but I really just through it all together kind of haphazardly.  And I minced the garlic instead of slicing.  Everyone loved the potatoes, especially my mom and I.  They were so creamy and smooth, YUM!!!  I ran across some scalloped potatoes at another get together the next day, and they didn't come even slightly close to being as tasty as these!  Thanks for sharing.

This was a great dish!  The cons to this recipe were quickly forgotten when you tasted it.  In fact, it was even better leftover the next day.  Here were my "cons" - It was very greasy and it took much longer for the potatoes to bake than the recipe said.  I ended up pouring and then soaking up as much grease from the dish as I could before serving.  Also, I did half heavy cream and half 2% milk to cut down on the richness, as others suggested.  Now my hubby and kids didn't seem to like it all that well, but that just meant more for me!  Very good dish and I will be making it again!

I made this to the recipe the first time and it was great. I did add ham to it. Next time I will add a smidge of flour to thicken the sauce and leave the rest as is. It is wonderful!

Great!  I couldn't get the potatoes to cook through for the life of me though.  Next time I'll give them a quick boil first.  Also, to make it lighter I mixed together fat free sour cream with some milk until it was the consistency of cream.

Excellent, was the best cheesy scalloped potatoes I've had in a long, long time! Will definitely make these again. They took a little longer to cook, and we doubled the recipe, so we had a nice crusty cheese topping with 1 cup of parmesan on top.

this recipe was very good.  I did change some of the ingredients like the heavy cream.  I used 1 cup of light sour cream and 1 cup of skim milk instead and it came out just fine.   I also added onions to give it more of a taste.  I did use less butter as someone else mentioned.  I will probably make this again.

This recipe was very simple to put together.  Used 1% fat milk and heavy cream evenly.  Used 1 cup sharp yellow and 1 cup wicked sharp white cheddar, otherwise followed recipe as written.  Also, shaved my garlic with a potato peeler - easy enough.  Would definitely do again and by the way covering with foil - spraying it with cooking spray first - was a nice tip, thanks!

I made the recipe as written and wasn't very impressed.  The flavors were okay, but the dish was very oily and liquidy.  We were hoping for something creamier with flavors that blend a little better.  The cheeses were good, but it felt like we were just eating melted cheese and potatoes.  It wasn't bad, but I'm going to try a different recipe.

After reading all of the reviews I decided to omit the butter and rather than using cream, I used skim milk and sour cream.  The potatoes were alright at best. It was still a bit greasy even without the butter and the entire recipe was just heavy. I wouldn't bother with this recipe again. I think I'd be better off just finding a different recipe to try.

Awesome Recipe! My husband is a grew up on scalloped potatoes. His mom and all his aunts make them and he said these were by far the best he ever had! Only change I would make is to cut back on the butter as others have said to make it not so greasy. The blend of cheese is wonderful and the crusty top is the best part! This is a keeper!

I felt this didn't have that much taste, even after adding extra garlic.  I also sliced the potatoes thin with my food processor and they still needed extra cooking time.

The best scalloped potatoes I've ever had.  I minced the garlic as I wasn't sure about getting a whole garlic slice in a bite!  And I used some muenster cheese in place of the provolone because it's what I had on hand.

Wonderful recipe, I omitted the butter, and used only 1 cup of italian blend shredded cheese, had left over parmesan from some frozen ravioli. Added fresh thyme from my garden,and  herbs de provance. Used 9x13 pan,  Baked for 1 hour at 350,covered with foil, 
then another 30 minutes or so at 325 uncovered. My husband just loved it. Had with bbq brisket first night, then with sauteed chicken and broccoli the next.

OMG! I love this recipe!  I do not necessarily make the best scalloped potatoes but these were the bomb!  I used red potatoes because that's what I had. I used the mandolin slicer as suggested and used sour cream, half & half and some milk and covered it with foil.  It was delish!  You should definitely make this recipe!

These were an absolute hit!  I admit, I did not follow the recipe exactly.  I happened to have 4 oz. of cream cheese that I needed to use.  So I added that to the cheese layer between the potatoes.  I also added onions.  Everything else was as written.  Great!  It is a keeper and we will make it again.  Thanks.

This dish had a wonderful rich flavor, however it is too rich to have on a regular basis.  I did cut the heavy cream, and used half heavy and half milk.  I also added more garlic.  Joe and I ended up just eating this dish for dinner, it is that filling!

I hate to not give this a good rating.  It was probably something I did but I tried this twice and it was not good both times.  The first time it was not cooked through.  The second time I boiled the potatoes a little bit to help the process along, and it was still not very good.  My husband said out of everything I have ever made there have only been 2 things he has not liked and this was one.  He would not even eat another bite and this man eats everything.  Dont know what I did wrong.

Great.  The few things I would change is do 2 1/2 slices of provolone,   1 1/2 c. milk instead of cream, garlic powder instead of garlic, and 3/4 to 1 c. of shredded cheddar cheese.  So besides scaling down on cheese and using milk as a low fat alternative to cream I thought it was delicious.  I also sprinkled some fresh rosemary on the top.  Dried herbs might be a good addition such as thyme, rosemary, oregano, or basil. I would also bake at about 400 for 40 minutes uncovered.  They turned out perfect that way.

This was wonderful! I was forced to alter - I had to pick my son up at soccer. I cooked 1 hour at 350 and had to put parm on the top for 40 minutes. Everything turned out perfect! Thanks for the great recipe!

The grease factor is a real problem with this dish but the flavor is wonderful.

I made this for Easter and everyone raved! They are very rich and so tasty. I doubled the recipe (for 9 people) and cooked in a 9x13 baking dish. I did make a substitution- I used half milk, half sour cream in place of the cream. I did not have provolone cheese on hand, so I just used an extra cup of the shredded cheddar. I cut the potatoes as thinly as I could and since I double the recipe, it was a long procedure. Putting the whole thing together was quick and I think they baked for about an hour and a half...it could have been more. I thought the garlic slices would be to potent, but it was flavorful and just right. They were so yummy and just about gone when the dinner was over. Everyone wanted me to send them the recipe.

My kids and I all loved the potatoes.  My husband thought they were good, but he wasn't fond of the Yukon potato texture, which is different.  I may try regular Idaho next time.

They were to greasy for my taste.  My family gobbled them up quite quickly.  I will try not to make these again, but I have a feeling I will be getting a request for them.

I was a little scared to make this after reading that some people had a very greasy outcome.  I'm so glad I did make it though.  It was awesome.  The only changes I made were to boil the potatoes whole for about 30 minutes.  I also used 1 1/2 cups of light cream instead of heavy because that is all I had on hand.  I also forgot the garlic so at the last minute I sprinkled garlic powder over the top layer of potatoes.  It was delicious and got rave reviews from my Easter crowd.

I added onions and mushrooms and probably should've left out the mushrooms as they dominated the taste quite a bit.  I used 10% cream.  I also found that an extra 25 minutes of cooking time was needed to fully cook the potatoes.  Also, the cream separated and curdled.  Anyone know how to prevent this?

First time I made this, it was not good. I can not understand how a recipe can work in someones oven so radically different then mine? (I'm using a Bosch convection oven that is only 1-year old... that oven can't be the problem!). I parboiled the potatoes like other comments suggested, and cooked 20 minutes longer, and they still did not cook enough. Since I could tell it had potential, I tried again by doubling the cooking time. That worked, but if I were you, I would check them every 20 minutes, and when you think they are 5-10 minutes before done, add the Parmesan, and cook for 30 more minutes. I also cut the garlic back "a little" the second time, it seemed to over-power the other flavors too much. Next time, I will boil my sliced potatoes a little longer to speed baking time, and make sure you use heavy cream so it thickens properly. Good luck.

I upped the cooking time to 1.5 hours and covered it with foil after reading other reviews, but the potatoes didn't soften as much as I was hoping. Also, I used half and half instead of heavy cream, and I was wondering if that is why it curdled?  The cream just seemed clumpy around the edges...not sure what I did wrong.

This was wonderfully rich! I made this for Easter and it was a hit.  I did not hand slice the potatoes, I used the smiply sliced potatoes (green package)....anything to save time when you are cooking a big meal.  The only thing I would change is the amount of butter, if even adding butter at all. It just was a little on the greasey side.

Flavor was good, but this recipe is just not right.  After cooking for 2 hours, it was still a soupy mess. Potatoes were cut less than 1/4 inch thick using a mandolin slicer.  They took the full 2 hours to cook, but having a thicker potato (maybe precooked bit) would have added to the eating experience.  Recipe needs some flour or something to thicken up that sauce.  I would like to duplicate the flavor using a different recipe with a thicker sauce and thicker potato slices.

I've been craving this dish for atleast a few months (and I'm pregnant on top of that).  I live in Italy, but raised in the deep south of u.s.a.  You can't get cheddar over here, so I thought making this was impossible b/c it would never be as good as my grandma's.  But thanks to you, and your suggestion of the other 2 cheeses, I can enjoy it here in Italy this easter!  It really cues the homesick blues.

These were good, but I didn't think they were good enough to be worth the time and effort as opposed to just getting the boxed kind.  I made the mistake of not thoroughly reading the reviews beforehand, for me, these took a LONG time to cook, a complete 2 hours (is is why I mostly felt they weren't worth the effort).  If do make them again, I will precook the potatoes beforehand.

A bit too garlicy for me, but hence the name "Garlic Scalloped Potatoes"!  Otherwise they turned out beautiful.  The potatoes were tender and they browned with a perfect crispy crust in the oven.  Will try again with less garlic.

This was  delicious. I am giving it the whole five stars even though mine came out a little watery after you broke thru the top layer of potatoes. I don't know what that was from. But next time I will try to correct it. Incredible flavor.

Very good.  Had a great taste, but the potatoes were still too hard after cooking for the hour.  I adjusted the recipe for 12, but left the cook time the same.  I probably should have cooked longer.  Next time I will make according to recipe and see how that goes.

These were too heavy for my preference.  Taste was very good but I didn't care for all the fat.  Would definitely adjust the recipe in the future to use low-fat or non-fat ingredients.

This recipe disappointed me. These were more of an au gratin potato and not scalloped potatos. I love cheese and garlic, and the flavors were good, but just not what I expected. Also, the potatos were not nearly done after 1 hour. I should have baked an additional 30 minutes to see how that did. Oh well. It was worth a try.

The flavors were wonderful for this recipe. After baking well over the time the potatoes still were not cooked all the way. I even parboiled the potatoes. I might try a different potatoe next time.

The potatoes were delicious.  They had excellent flavor (I added grated onion for more flavor.) I had doubled the recipe and used a 9.5 X 11 baking dish, but it turned out too creamy, meaning the cream didn't thicken the way I expected.  Next  time I make the recipe I will not use all the cream.  But I will definaly make again.

I used buttermilk instead of cream, and - as it said you could put in the cheeses you chose - I had sharp provolone and gorgonzola. It was good, only I had to leave it in the oven more than stated to have the potatoes really cooked through. All in all, I'm sure I'll do it again, still if you change cheese I don't know how much it relates to the original recipe.

VERY tasty but i swear i cooked them 3 hrs. and they still were not as soft as i like them. i keep forgetting when baking with raw potatoes to perboil first. there was no "sauce" just the curdling. probably will not make again. the container was too small and the grease leaked all over the oven.

I was very disappointed with this recipe.  It came out very greasy and the cream didn't thicken like I expected it to.  It almost kind of curdled. The flavor was really good, but this needs some major tweaking. Par-boiling the potatoes and doing something different with the cream.  Maybe making a cheese sauce with the cheese and cream and layering that?  Made this twice and didn't work either time.  Plan on cooking this forever if you don't par-boil also.

I used cubed frozen potatoes, had to cook it about 20 min. longer, but was still very good. Admitted provolone and was still plenty cheesy. Probably could hire the heat if going to use the frozen cubed potatoes, and use same time frame. Very good.
Update- tried to follow the recipe exactly this time, did not work out!! The potatoes took triple the time to cook and even then did not taste great. I'll definetly use my frozen cubed potatoes next time.

I don't know what happened but mine turned out GROSS & I am not a novice in the kitchen! I used whole milk instead of cream, so this may be the reason. I found the 1.5 Q casserole to be way too small.  I cooked this for over 2 hrs to get the potatoes to cook thru. It looked good on top until I went to scoop it and there was liquid and milk curds - no creamy scalloped potatoes here. I am very disappointed but will have to try it with the cream and in a larger casserole dish to give an accurate rating.

These were delicious, but I changed a little bit.  I added an extra clove of garlic per layer of potatoes.  I used sharp cheddar cheese and romano instead of parmesan.  The cheeses made the flavor very rich, if you would prefer a little less rich, use the cheeses it calls for.  Also, I would probably cook the potatoes at approximately 400 degrees because after 1 hour of cooking, the potatoes were still not cooked.  Otherwise, the recipe was great.

This is a great recipe!! I read the other hints, and followed some and added my own. I used 2 x-large Irish baking potatoes, and put them in a 7.5 X 9" pyrex dish. I think this helped them to cook a little bit faster, and more evenly. I also minced the fresh garlic into my cream mixture as suggested, layering with the 3 cheeses that she suggested.I baked it for 1 hour lightly covered(325 degrees), with "tented" foil. Added the ramono cheese and baked another hour, removing the foil the last 15-20 min. This recipe rivals any of the potato side dishes I've been served in several 4-5 star places!! Thanks for another keeper!!

I should have sliced the potaotes thinner or boiled them before assembling. I will next time, as it had to cook much longer than stated.

I made these for Easter go to with Glazed Ham from this site.  I have one 9 year old son and two grandkids, 10 and 8, and the adults were lucky to get any of this dish because the kids snarfed it up!  There were NO leftovers and they asked me to make them again the next day!  That's the ultimate compliment in my house - I'll keep this one handy for sure.

Needed to cook for 2 hours, which was fine.  I knew that going in after reading reviews.  I added one onion sliced and placed the rings in with the potato layers.  It was good but nothing to rave about.  Probably will do again with additional spices.  Even with the three cheeses, kind of bland.

Super easy and super delicious! I didn't have any garlic lying around the house, so I ommited it, and it still came out very flavorful and tasty.

The first time I made this I left out the garlic and the second time I made it I used garlic salt and it definitely made a big difference. I guess I should have followed the recipe as is. I did find that like others stated, you do need more cook time.

For this recipe I used Jalapeno Havarti, Mozarella and Mild Cheddar it was great. Next time I will use the three cheeses that the recipe called for to compare. Everyone at the table loved this one, thank you.

The flavor was good but it took sooo long to cook for some reason. I sliced the potatoes thin etc but they still werent ready by the time the ham and peas were.

I hated how sometimes i'd take a bite and it was great and other times it was like, surprise, a lot of garlic.  Next time, i'm going to either omit the fresh garlic, or just use a slight sprinkle of garlic powder.  I don't like garlic when i can taste it.

Excellent recipe!!  They were super rich & delicious.  We had to bake about 15 minutes longer than the recipe called for.
We made this with meatloaf (no crumble meatloaf -also delicious)& it was a fantastic dinner for a cold night in the snow.
Thank you so much for the recipe!

Very good, however had to cook 15 minutes longer.  Used light cream instead of heavy cream.  Would have added more garlic.

Really yummy, rich recipe. I felt a little guilty using all that cream, so I cut the amount in half, and thined it out with a little milk. I used a Tex Mex cheese mixture, just for convience, and in turned out great. Really flavorful!

I followed the recipe exactly (didn't omit the butter or cream) and it was WAY too rich and greasy.. I doubt I'll ever try it again, even to try it with the adjustments other reviewers recommended.

Mine took forever to cook.  I had them at 325 degrees for one hour, then cranked the oven to 425 degrees for another 20 minutes, then finally had to finish them in the microwave for 10 minutes so we could eat!

I was sooo frustrated, I needed a potato recipe and did not read reviews on this one, ended up cooking it 1 hour and 45 minutes, not happy.  I tend to agree needed more salt. If I make it again I am going to pre-cook the tators and add some different spices to add to the flavor a bit, cayanne sounds like a good one. Overall my moms are way better...

I'm being generous when I give this recipe 2 stars. I didn't like the texture of the sauce, almost a curdled effect. Maybe it was the type of cheese I used-not sure. Took forever to cook even though the potatoes were paper thin. I guess I was looking for a thicker, cheesier dish. I'll keep looking for a good Au Gratin recipe instead.

This was a great recipe and easy.  I used a potato slicer instead of doing it by hand which sped up the process.  However, I did improvise as I didn't want to go to the grocery store.  Instead of the heavy cream I used 1/2 cup milk and 1/2 c sour cream, whisked.  For the garlic I used minced garlic.  And the cheeses I used Velveeta instead of Cheddar and swiss instead of the provolone.  I cooked it at 300 for about 1 1/2 hours and it thickened up just fine.  My family ate the whole dish even my picky 5 year old.  Thanks!

The general consensus at my house was good, but nothing amazing. I loved the way the cheese got sort of crispy and smoky. It was just sort of bland and I even took the advice from other cooks and added more garlic and salt. I'll try it again but I think I need to mess with the recipe a bit.

Very tasty. I sliced the potatoes paper-thin, and they were cooked perfectly in 30 mins at 425. I used half-and-half instead of heavy cream, and also a few blobs of low-fat sour cream. Thanks, KarlaLV!

Very good recipe! But i probably would omit some of the butter because they were a little greasy. I will certainly make them again!

What a wonderful comfort food.  These were really good, but they needed salt once they hit the plate.  Other than that, I had rave reviews and it went great with my Easter ham.

My husband must have said "Oh, these are so GOOD!" about ten times in a row as he stuffed his face.  These were awesome, but took FOREVER to cook and prepare.  I don't  own a mandoline, so the slicing and shredding took a while and it took 1.5 hours to bake...otherwise, a very good special occasion recipe!  Thanks.

My husband and I enjoyed the potatoes and felt they were a great variation to the typical scalloped potato recipe with milk and flour.  However, they did need to be baked longer than the recipe stated or next time I will use a larger pan to have a thinner layer of potatoes to bake through better.  Overall great side dish!

I found it to be very bland...maybe a softer cheese and more garlic would have improved it.  I have removed this recipe from my recipe box.

These potatoes are so good. I had an orgasma in my mouth...so good. I used half and half cream instead of whipping cream. Less fat, but still very tasty.

These potatoes were excellent. However when I made them I didn't have everything (Shame on me) I used milk instead of cream and used garlic powder. I used Mozzerella cheese and cheder and everything still turned out great! I'm sure its better when you use the right stuff! HAHA

Due to all the great ratings, I will assume that my dish came out disappointingly because of my own doings.  I used a 2 qt casserole dish, but it was a ROUND one, and the two layers of cheese just couldnt manage the thick layers of potato.  the cheese layer was mighty good, but the rest of the potatoes were quite bland.  This recipe must mean to use a rectangular baker that spreads the potato layers out more, that's the only thing I can figure.  I'll try this again...but not for company just yet!

mmmmmmmm, this is classic comfort food! i only made 2 minor changes, first to substitute half & half for the light cream then second was increasing the oven's temperature to 350 degrees (guaranteeing the potatoes doneness). the subtle flavor of the fresh garlic plus the crusty cheese layer on top definitely makes this dish a winner. thank you karla!

The flavour is fine but that is no where near enough cooking time nor is that a high enough temperature.  I would say maybe 375 for an hour might make more sense. 
Anyway, it is a good recipe.  I did use milk instead of cream though.  Next time I will try cream.

Very easy and tasty!!  I did make some changes. Instead of using fresh garlic, I used a garlic/pepper seasoning.  Per suggestions from other reviewers, I omitted the additional 2 tablespoons of butter. I used a buttered 9" square pan. I would suggest raising oven temperature to 350 degrees. Thanks for sharing Karla!!

I made this recipe for Easter Dinner 2004, have had request for "double the recipe" for x-mas this year.  Reheated left-overs are excellent. I also made it with half-and-half, and fat-free sour cream, and alpine lace low-fat cheese as a part of the cheese.  still got excellent comments form friends and family.(made a mistake when I served it)

I made this for a family christmas party, this past weekend, and being a novice cook, I needed to make easy, yet delicious dishes.
I altered the recipe slightly, using half & half and a bit more garlic. It was a good choice making it a bit lighter. Not only did I get requests for the recipe, but my husband & I were asked to make the whole thing an annual event!
Thanks so much for sharing the recipe &  reviews!

This recipe was YUM!! My family and friends all loved this recipe and were asking for thirds...get ready for EXTREME CHEESE when tasting this....the shell that develops from the provolone cheese is a nice touch...It was so easy to make...would make again.

Excellent recipe.  Hubby could not say enough about this recipe.  I used ham leftover from Thanksgiving.  It certainly didn't hurt this at all.  I agree with others about the butter.  Use little or none at all.  The oil from the cheddar cheese is all that is needed.  It had wonderful flavor and the smell in the kitchen was heavenly.  Thank you Karla.

This is THE YUM!  I had to make do w/ the cheeses, since I did not have provolone, and instead of the cream I had to use evaporated milk, but all in all it was quite delicious and complemented the pork chops I served with it quite nicely.  The only thing I did not care for is how the cheese got all curdly between the layers and how the top got a little greasy.  Maybe something I did wrong, or the make-shift ingredients I used?

I had to improvise the recipe a bit (didn't use Provolone Cheese, and used minced garlic instead of fresh), but all in all, this dish was a great hit. I would recommend cooking for just a little bit longer as the potatoes didn't get as soft as I like, but they were still delicious.

Simply the best scalloped potatoes..  My family loves them!   I tend to add a little more cheese and my own set of spices; but the family loves them...

I've found that the cooking time can vary dependant on the size of your slices of potatoes...  My family and I enjoy thick (setting 4-5 on a potato cutter) slices, it's like a cheesy mashed potatoes...

You can definately play around with amount of cheeses to taste; this recipe is one that you'll definately have fun playing with :).

I used pepper jack cheese and chedder. It was very runny and took about twice as long to cook than suggested. I also put in much more garlic and slices of Italian bacon. It was very delicious and made great leftovers. Five stars for flavor!

Wow. This recipe went over so well. I used Monterey Jack instead of Provolone. I used a Parmesan, Romano combo and it was great.  The only thing I changed and would cut back even more is you do not need much butter. I used about 2/3 what was called for and next time I'll only use 1/2. I doubled the recipe and used an 11x15 inch pan so it still only had to cook for 1 hour. Using the food processor this recipe was thrown together in 10 minutes.

WOW!!!  These were a huge hit with my husband.  He is not fond of potato dishes (unless it is potatoe salad or mashed potatoes) nor is he fond of leftovers.  Not only did he say that he liked it, he said put the rest away so that we can eat them tomorrow night!!!

These were great-they take a little longer in the oven, so I would suggest making these on a day when you have extra time, but they are well worth it!
