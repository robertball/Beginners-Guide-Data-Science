I love asparagus, I love grilled asparagus, I love sesame oil!  Winner! Excellent flavor.  My only comment would be you don't need 1/4 cup of sesame oil.  A Tablespoon will do, also there is both regular sesame oil which although flavorful is not as potent as Toasted Sesame Oil.  Either way, this is good.  Make it!
