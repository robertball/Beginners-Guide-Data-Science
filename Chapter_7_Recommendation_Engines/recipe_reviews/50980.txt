This is very good, and it makes a lot.  Great for some, not so great for me seeing as I live alone!  Easy to make.  I found it tasted much better the next day.

This recipe is a good start.  Very easy and okay in flavor - but a little sweet for us.  I didn't have cider vinegar - so used white vinegar. Added a little more vinegar, a splash of worchestershire, some garlic and onion powder.  Also, a bit less red pepper flakes just because we don't care of a LOT of heat.  After the changes, I'll be making this often.

A bit spicy. I recommend half the amount of chilli flakes as it really does keep getting hotter the longer it sits in your fridge.
But overall an excellent recipe.

Added a little cayenne and extra vinegar for a hotter, zestier style.

It isn't bad. It tastes like very spicy ketchup. I had to thicken it up with cornstarch and add some liquid smoke to it. Just wasn't really a BBQ sauce to me.

Very easy and quick to prepare.  I replaced Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning for the red pepper.

great base for a BBQ sauce. I do not use the viniger, but add liquid smoke, whorchester sauce, fresh crushed garlic and depending on my mood, Dark brown sugar, or honey, or molasas. We like it hot, so I have also been known to add chipolote chili powder, or I dry my own jalanenos. Add a little Wishey or Rum, and weeehoooo, you gots yer self some Kicked Up Qing sauce

Love this recipe! Use it all of the time and sometimes even add cayenne pepper and paprika!
