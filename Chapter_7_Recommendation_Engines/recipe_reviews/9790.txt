Not bad, but I was not impressed. I probably will not make these again.

These were a huge hit! I made the recipe for 60 for a coffee tasting that paired well with citrus and nuts and it made close to 200, but I may have made them smaller than suggested. Everyone who tried them loved them and all 200 were consumed within 2 days.
