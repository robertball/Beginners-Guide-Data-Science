I travel frequently and often have Cobb Salads when I do - on planes, in restaurants, hotels and even from grocery stores.  I love a good Cobb Salad, but I never much paid attention to what I know is a classic list of ingredients.  So glad to find this recipe here, and this is quite easily the best Cobb Salad I've ever had anywhere, probably because I controlled the ingredients, their quality and their freshness.  I stuck to the ingredients as written as, again, I recognize them to be critical to an authentic Cobb Salad.  I did, however, make my own Buttermilk Ranch Dressing.   This was an ideal dinner to make for myself since Hubs is out of town and he would have never eaten this in a million years - well, not with the Blue cheese anyway.  My tummy is happy.  (Tip: Penzey's Spices makes a seasoning blend called "Buttermilk Dressing and Dip" which makes a quick but awesome ranch dressing!  I don't even use buttermilk - just sour cream, mayo and half and half to desired thickness)

Hmmm....Ranch dressing and iceberg? Now that's a first for me, including the reviewer who said that thousand island was the only way to go. However, who cares if it's not the "original" recipe; if it tastes good, eat it! I prefer a mixture of romaine and butter lettuce with a dressing consisting of red wine vinegar, olive oil (which I drizzle in slowly to emulsify) dijon mustard, chopped fresh chives and crumbled blue cheese. Any way you decide to make this salad with whatever dressing, it will always be a hit. Thanks so much Mr. Bill!

Delicious salad!!  I usually don't like vegetables or salad, but I ate this salad every day for lunch until it was gone.  Will def. make again.  UPDATE: I always buy rotisserie chicken and crumbled gorgonzola cheese from the grocery store so that I can put this salad together quickly.  I also use home-made ranch dressing II (from this site) and it makes this salad even better.

Delicious!! Delicious!! Delicious!! I omitted the green onions (just don't like them) and added some canned peas and black olives.  Used the Ranch (despite the controversy going on about what dressing to use) and wouldn't have it any other way.  I think it's all about the Ranch you choose to use.  I used Marie's Creamy Ranch (found in the produce isle) and experienced heaven for a short while!!  Try this!!

Since it was way too hot to cook tonight this salad was perfect! Plus I was able to use up some left over grilled chicken. Talk about a win - win situation! Not to mention it has three of my husband's favorite things - hard boiled eggs, bacon, and ranch dressing.  This salad was cool, crisp, and full of great tasting ingredients.  I've always ordered Cobb Salad's out, but it's nice to make this at home. Thanks for a great recipe!

I love ordering Cobb Salad at restaurants but the fresh salad at home was even more fabulous.  I put some boneless chicken breast in a garlic flavored italian dressing in the morning and threw them on the grill while chopping up all the other ingredients.  This one is a bit time-consuming in the prep department but the finished product is well worth it.  Tasty and a beautiful presentation with all the colors and textures!

We really enjoyed this salad!  The kids are off of school today, & wanted to go to one of those buffet places (in which all they eat is a salad anyway & why pay $20 when I had all the ingredients on hand..even the blue cheese).  I did use 1/2 iceberg & 1/2 spinich (uncooked), & used left over turkey, it's delicious!  OOPS, I forgot to mention to the kids that there is blue cheese in it & they never even noticed ;)  Thanks Bill!

I think everyone should use whatever dressing they like! The salad is GREAT!!! For reference this is the Original Cobb Salad Dressing from the Brown Derby
Makes 1 1/2 cups 

1/4 cup water 

1/4 cup red wine vinegar 

1/4 teaspoon sugar 

1 teaspoon freshly squeezed lemon juice 

2 teaspoons salt 

3/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 
3/4 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce 

1/4 teaspoon dry English mustard 

1 small clove garlic, finely minced 

1/4 cup full-flavored olive oil 

3/4 cup salad oil 


Blend all ingredients together, except oils. Add olive and salad oils. Mix well.

Blend well again before mixing with salad.

A note from the Brown Derby: "The water is optional, depending upon the degree of oiliness desired in the dressing."

This recipe is fabulous.  I have been to famous resturantes and always have the Cobb salad.  But I wanted to offer a suggestion, my very favorite salad was in Hawaii where they also added shredded summer squash, both yellow and green.  It really added a great flavor to the classic list of ingredients.

hit all the elements of a cobb salad.  The only things I did differently were: I used cheddar cheese instead of blue, and Romaine lettuce instead of iceberg.  Hit the spot, thank you!

Awesome salad. We always ordered this at a local restaurant but it has closed now. This is right-on. It was served with the lettuce on the bottom and then rows of the other ingredients and the dressing they recommended was a poppy seed dressing. You have to try it. They also served all-bran muffins with this. It is one of our favorite meals and now we enjoy it at home and follow this recipe but use our favorite poppy seed dressing.

This is a fabulous salad.  I must correct Bonnie who reviewed this recipe previously.  The original recipe from The Brown Derby does not contain olives nor does it use Thousand Island dressing.  The chef who's brilliant idea this recipe is used raw egg with lemon juice and mustard, among other things, for the dressing.

I had such high expectations for this!  I didn't like it at all.  There was too much lettuce, not enough "stuff," and the flavor of it was just very bland.  It had a lot of prep-work to it and the result wasn't worth it.  Thanks for the recipe anyway though!

I am thrilled that this cobb salad turned out great! I added shredded carrots and cold peas to this as well and used a light ranch. It was so good that I will never go to a restaurant to buy Cobb salad again knowing that I've got an excellent one that I can make at home!

Had company over and everyone enjoyed this meal the salad itself was more than enough to eat. But I also made barbequed ribs with Big Al's barbeque sause. To much food but no one complained.

This recipe is definitely a keeper!  I made it last night for dinner ~ with 3 smallish changes~ and my family LOVED it!  To make it a bit more healthful, I shredded Romaine hearts instead of Iceberg, which still gave us the crunch but with more vitamins, etc. I used turkey bacon  and I also made up my own salad dressing, using EVO and balsamic vinegar. The sweetness of it was a wonderful foil for the  Blue Cheese, although I'm sure the original recipe is fantastic, as well.

Excellent.  I seasoned the meat with poultry seasoning before grilling.  I did not have an avocado so I used croutons.  My husband used ranch dressing and I used Italian.  Very filling and can be used as the main dish.

Best salad ever!  The only change I made was to  use leaf lettuce because of a personal preference.  I love the avocado in this salad it adds so much texture and flavor.  This is a keeper!  Thanks for sharing Bill.

I have never had a Cobb salad before and this is by far the BEST salad I have ever eaten. I will make it again and again. All of the ingredients work so well together. Thanks for the deliciously easy recipe.

I loved this recipe for the Cobb Salad.  The only is that I did not use chicken for the center.  I decided to use the freshly cooked and diced bacon in the center.  My family loved it!

add vegies to your liking; green pepper, red onion, celery. Keep bacon in larger pieces.  Grill chicken breasts after marinade in Weber peppercorn grill mix.sooo good. Salad dressing to your taste- roasted red pepper vinegrette is amazing

Has all the right stuff--although I've had it several times I have never heard of it with thousand island dressing before--as one reader mentioned--always had either a creamy white dressing or a vingarette--thumbs up from my family

Quick, fresh, healthy (except for the bacon), and fulfilling! This is exactly what I needed for a quick-fix dinner tonight. It was also a perfect way for me to use up all that leftover Costco rotisserie chicken and get the family to eat some greens. Besides who doesn’t like boiled eggs, bacon, chicken, avocado and ranch dressing? I had everything except for the crumbled bleu cheese so I the used a little bleu cheese dressing I had instead. I also used bacon flavored Ranch dressing. I halved the cherry tomatoes, boiled eggs, cut up leftover rotisserie chicken, diced up two whole ripe avocados, chopped up some fresh green onions and placed everything on a bed of fresh torn Iceberg and Manoa lettuce. This is one of the best Cobb Salad I've in a while, probably because I used local ingredients and its’ quality was freshest this morning. Makes me feel good knowing I am eating healthy (with the exception of bacon).  This salad leaves ample room to add and adjust the ingredients as needed without compromising its’ great taste. This was an ideal dinner to make for the family since I am sick right now and don’t have the patience or strength to broil, boil, sear, fry or slow-cook anything today. I loaded this one up since this was a meal. In the end it was well worth the effort; a flavorful, fresh tasting salad. Once put together this made a pretty presentation.

Scrumptious! We used black olives instead of green onion. Also, used real bacon pieces from a jar instead of the frying method. Added cheddar cheese on the side. Very good salad.... boyfriend is just starting to eat salad, and says this is a new favorite salad.

This salad was wonderful even without the chicken.  I did change the chopped tomatoes to grape tomatoes sliced in half, and I used cucumber dressing instead of ranch, but this was possibly the most delicious salad I've eaten in a long time.  Well done!

This is an outstanding salad. The dressing type can be selected according to personal preference. We prefer a romaine/spring green selection with bleu cheese dressing. I can't imagine this salad being anything but delicious no matter what your choice of dressing.
The presentation is outstanding with all the beautiful colors and textures.
Thanks for sharing, Mr. Bill!

This is a favorite recipe.  Try browning the chicken, I use boned breast meat, in the drippings from the bacon (delish).  My favorite dressing is a restaurant French Blue.  So, since the blue cheese is already in the recipe, I just add the French dressing.  Thanks Bill for a great recipe.

A hit with adults and kids! I added 1 extra avocado because its everybody's favorite and just a little parsley for freshness. I used turkey bacon (only because it was all I had in the house). I served the salad in those individual edible salad shell bowls that you bake in the oven, like the kind you get in the restaurants. It was awesome!

I made this salad for my family and they loved.  I think they enjoyed it even more when I served it again as left overs.  The only change I made was that I added home made croutons.  Something tells me I will be makeing this salad often by request.

My all time favorite salad! Nice recipe, but where's the olives? Just kidding, we all have slightly different versions, depending on the restaurants we have experienced. My latest effort used feta cheese, skipped the onions, added olives, and was smothered in blue cheese dressing. I also like to cut most ingredients into wedges and arrange them into radial pattern of triangular areas. But that's just me.  I'm drooling on the keyboard thinking about this salad.

I have wanted to make this for some time and finally did. We really loaded up with a variety of market fresh produce. We used the Key West grilled chicken recipe here on AR for our chicken. Such a pretty looking plate you almost don't want to mess it up by eating it...NOT... What a great summer meal.

This is a good recipe, but don't forget to salt and pepper for flavor. I also add cucumbers. YOu can tweak the entire salad and the dressing to your taste. The only downside to making this salad is that there is alot of prep time involved.

I love Cobb Salad and while it was a bit time consuming for a salad, glad I took a shot at making it at home! I kind of halved the recipe, but not precisely. I just realized I totally forgot the green onions, but I'm not sure they're usually included in the salads I get in restaurants. I liked the iceberg lettuce with it, but I think a mixed of lettuce and greens would be good too. Perhaps ranch isn't the dressing that's "supposed" to go on Cobb salad but I always ask for ranch when I order one so I was happy with it!

I could seriously live off of this salad every day. So good!! I have had this salad numerous times at different restaurants, but had never actually made it myself. I am so glad I found this recipe though because now I can have my favorite salad that makes a ton for about half the price. I used turkey bacon since that is what we had here at the house, and the temperature was almost 100 degress (and it's only May!) so I didn't feel like cooking a hot chicken so we left that out. Delicious! Will make again when I get those Cobb salad cravings. Thanks for the recipe, Bill.

Can't go wrong with a cobb salad!  Made this for a summer evening dinner and it hit the spot perfectly!  We used homemade ranch dressing but I think next time I will make a blue cheese vinegrette.

Love this stuff!! It is practically a staple at my house!! My husbands favorite Cobb Salad is the " Shrimp Cobb Salad" he orders at a private club in downtown Fort Smith. Every time I make this he feels like he is eating in a Restaurant!! I typically use shrimp, but have used chicken and ham. After I buy groceries ( using the shopping list ,of course) I shred my lettuce, cut tomatoes, boil and chop eggs and avocados and place in airtight containers in the fridge. I also keep shrimp and cooked chicken in the freezer, so that all I have to do is build this lovely salad!! I am addicted to the Authentic Thousand Island, so I use it instead of ranch dressing. Yum, Yum!!

Very good salad.  I add chopped celery hearts.  I also sprinkle seasoning salt and pepper on the tomatoes before adding to salad.  This seems to really bring out the flavor of the tomatoes.  Try with whatever you have on hand.

This was so good, and very beautiful.  I just made it for my husband and I, so I used a little less of everything.  I used organic baby romaine lettuce and omitted the green onion.  I used part of a rotisserie chicken, and put cheddar cheese on my husband's salad instead of blue.  Very, very filling, this is a meal in itself!

This was great! I've eaten these out a million times, and never thought to make it @ home, but so glad I did! I made a few minor changes due to what I had on hand... I used some really good deli turkey in place of the chicken, some cucumber that needed to be used and red onion instead of the green onions. We really, REALLY enjoyed dinner tonight! I made 'Ranch Dressing II' from here and that went very well. I will def make these again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Awesome recipe for a classic salad! I followed the recipe exactly, except for the green onions - I dislike them and I've never seen them used in a cobb salad. I also sauteed the cubed chicken in the leftover grease from the bacon just for kicks, but it tasted good! After the chicken was cooked, I drained it and tossed with a dash each of black pepper, poultry seasoning, and salt. My family loved it! 

Also, I probably should have paid more attention to serving size, but I made it in the original size (6 servings), which turned out to be 3 large salads for three adults. Enough to be a meal on its own, really! If serving as a side dish, one serving per person is perfect.

Yum!  I lightened a little by chosing a no-fat raspberry vinegarette as the dressing.  Was fabulous!

I always order this salad in restaurants so when I saw this recipe, I thought it would be a great Sunday dinner.  It was really really good.  Everyone loved it.  We added orange pepper, cucumbers and celery. We also substituted cheddar cheese for the blue cheese.

OMG!  I have a newfound LOVE for blue cheese!!!  I LOVED this salad.  Joe liked it (not big on blue cheese).  Next time try gorgonzola - it's milder. Dressing: homemade ranch, bit of worcheshire, blue cheese.  SO GOOD!

very good, there are so many variables to the name Cobb Salad.  I had a good one once from Applebees, on a promotional menu item, not back since tho', but they used grilled sliced steak instead of chicken,  I have made it both ways several times.  always a very good meal in a platter type bowl. lol.

This has always been a great salad to use up the stuff in the fridge before you head to the store again.  We use a vinegar/oil dressing or lemon juice instead of Ranch.  We also use Romaine, not iceberg.

Delicious and quick to prepare.  Added mushrooms for extra texture.  My hubby loves the blue cheese, but it's a bit too strong for me - mine was just as good without it.

Very nice salad. My husband feels that chicken AND bacon is a bit too much meat though. I might cut down on chicken. avocado is great for this dish. I didn't put blue cheese because we can't get them, but it's still good

This is an awesome salad as is, but I had to mess with it....lol.  I used Bacon and Blue Cheese dressing found in the produce isle.  WOW.  My husband loved it, I loved it and our guests did too. My husbanc hates blue cheese.....I haven't made him love it, but he loved this salad.

This salad has a great blend of all different types. I leave out the blue cheese crumbles and add ranch as a dressing. This has been perfect for road trips in which my family tries to avoid the fast food temptations. Great healthy alternative!

I Love A Salad!! This salad is great. You can also add your favorites if you like. Not sure if that will not make it a Cobb Salad or not, olives, peppers, mushrooms and on and on. I choose Romain lettuce with a vinegarette dressing,my lettuce and dressing  of choice. Good to eat and good for you. Eat up!

i love cobb salad. you can substitute fresh spinach for the iceberg lettuce if you're looking for more nutritional value (since iceberg is mostly water). the spinach has more vitamins and tastes better. bleu cheese dressing is my favorite, but you can cut tons of calories if you use a little balsamic vinegar instead of creamy dressings.

Awesome salad!. I've had cobb salad at restaurants and from my local deli and always love it. Decided to try to make it today for lunch because I didn't want to have the expense of buying it already madeand I had most of the ingredients at home. This was soooo good! WE loved it and ate it for lunch and dinner. I did make some adjustments to fit my taste and budget. I added shredded carrots that I had on hand and used some cucumbers I had on hand. I omitted the green onions.  I only used 4 slices of bacon and since I didn't have blue cheese crumbles I mixed half blue cheese dressing and Marie's ranch dressing together and drizzled over the top.  We added italian breaded chicken strips on the top. This salad gets 5+++++ stars!!!!!

This salad was wonderful!  But 3 cups of green onions... really?  I thought that was a bit much, so I reduced it to 1 cup.  I also added romaine to the iceburg.  Will definitely make again and again.

What a great salad, I used low fat ranch style dressing, with French bread it's a real good meal.

I love Cobb Salad, but HATE blue cheese. I use shredded mozzarella instead, and it is perfect.

Add some warm smoked ham stripes and the Cobb is now complete. Substitute some chunky blue cheese dressing in lieu of ranch and this jumps to 5 stars.

Tried this version and it is slightly easier to make than the original and this is not bad.  Was always taught, while in training, never change a good thing because then it becomes something different.  Now at 72, nearly retired, I always pass that on to others under my tutelage.

It is okay and easy to make and all, but it seems to make an excessive amount. My daughter combined all of the ingredients out of it, and then put it between two slices of bread as a sandwich.

Great salad!  My husband loved it and he's not a salad guy.  I did add some shredded cheddar, and used red onion instead of green onion.  I love it with the Ranch dressing, my husband used blue cheese dressing. Thanks for a great, refreshing meal!

This salad can be made anyway you want!  I was feeding 5 people, they all had different dressings (blue cheese, ranch, Catalina, Thousand Island...) it went with everything.  One person had steak on theirs, another had chicken...  All in all an excellent basic salad!  Thank you!

What is this thing about ranch and iceburg? Who cares? It's salad. And this one is fabulous. I actually used spinach and green leaf lettuce bc my hubby is allergic to iceburg. It was great. Thanks!

This is a perfect classic recipe.  So many people are changing it, that it could no longer be called a Cobb Salad.  Of course the best and freshest ingredients make for the best cooking.

This was so fresh wonderful and full of flavor.  I think bottled ranch would ruin the pure flavors here so I made the Ranch Dressing II from this site they were made for each other.  I will make this many more times.

Good salad - I rarely follow the recipe exactly, just start chopping things up! I like to make it like they do at Cheesecake Factory; basically chop everything into little pieces and then toss it all together with the dressing. (I use ranch because my BF prefers it). The salad doesn't look as pretty this way but you get more flavors with each bite.

I am giving this recipe 5 stars because my husband absolutely loved it as is.  I also didn't have to put everything in it that the kids didn't like.  It is very versatile and tasty.  I used buffalo chicken tenders for the chicken.

This one was hard to rate. I loved everything about the salad, but the blue cheese. It dominated the flavors in the salad and just gave it a really tart taste. I would like to try this again, but use maybe a cotijo cheese. I had a similar salad with that cheese while in Washington DC. I made individual salads each with about 2 cups romaine, 1 egg, 3/4 piece grilled chicken, 1 tblsp real bacon bits, 1 Tblsp cheese, 1 small roma tomato, 1/4 large avocado, 1/2 green onion, and 2 tblsp. light ranch. The calorie total refigured to 355 per salad.

I've made this using the Ranch dressing, but today I felt like something lighter, so I just dressed the lettuce with olive oil, red wine vinegar, salt and pepper. An easy and healthy main dish salad to which you can change out the ingredients to suit yourself. Thanks Bill!

This salad was delicious! Very filling too!  I used turkey bacon and also substituted shredded cheddar cheese in place of blue cheese.

I. Cut the recipe in half and added some sausage. I really enjoyed it. While it’s not quite an omelette it’s much better than scrambled eggs. The next time I make this recipe I’ll spay the pan with Pam instead of using butter to eliminate the eggs sticking

Followed this recipe exactly as is and my family gobbled it up! Great summer salad. Perfect with the iceberg and ranch dressing too! Thanks Bill. I've had Cobb Salads at restaurants and never thought to make them at home. This was just great!

Like another writer, I have loved a good Cobb salad for many years.  Thank you for providing one that is true to the original!  It just doesn't get much better than this (unless someone else is kind enough to fix it for you)!

This is a great base for a cobb salad.
-I use different lettuce than iceburg, usually green leaf or a mixture of a few.
-I also use WAY more veggies: carrots, broccoli, frozen peas thawed, cauliflower, red bell pepper, mushroom, red onion, zuchini, cucumber...etc. 
- I either use ranch or homemade thousand island dressing. 
- I also use homemade croutons (baking cut up & seasoned bread with olive oil for about 10 minutes)
-I sometimes add sunflower seeds and some chunks of good cheese.

No bacon when I went to make so used stir fried peperoni instead. I think bacon would have made this a 5 so that is what I gave it. with the other meat rated a 4, but still good.

You can't go wrong with a cobb salad.  I like mine fully loaded. In addition to the recipe ingredients, I add black olives, cheddar cheese, and red onions.

This was delicious!  The heat index was 111 degrees last night, so I wanted to make something light and not something in the oven. DH grilled 2 chicken breasts, which were wonderful. I used romaine lettuce instead of the iceberg, didn't add the green onion but added matchstick carrots. Very filling and so easy to make!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Made a few changes but it's a great "through anything in" kind of salad.  Omitted the bacon for health reasons and added big chunks of ham, used feta cheese as i don't like blue cheese and no avocado....Still a keeper!!!

I love this salad, but I prefered using Balsamic Vinaigrette Dressing to get the Full Flavor; (and I'm eating healthier-although you could use a lite dressing).  Thank You for a beautiful full-flavored meal.

Love Cobb Salad.  I'm not an avacaso fan so skip this.  Can't stand iceberg so will use romaine or mixtures of lettuce.  I will add shredded carrots, zucchini or yellow squash if I have them on hand.  I've used bleu and feta cheese.  And I vary the dressings.  Make my own so it depends o what I have at the time.

This salad is fantastic, easy to make and very satisfying and filling! I found that the amount given was perfect for two people. One egg for each person is good. I used turkey bacon instead and it was a hit! Will definitely make again! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This is a great flavor combination.  I did try to lighten it up by going easy on the bacon & cheese.  I omitted the hard-boiled eggs but will definitely add that next time and make it with Romaine for even more flavor.

This was GOOD, so good I took leftovers for lunch the next day. (The avocado browns overnight, naturally, but it doesn't squick me out, although it bothers my husband. MORE LEFTOVERS FOR ME.)  I think this recipe would be heavenly as-is, but even with the substitutes I had to use it was five-star worthy. I used cheddar instead of bleu cheese, a romaine lettuce mix instead of iceberg, and I left out the green onions because we didn't have any.

Yum!  I served it salad bar style so everyone added what they liked and used whatever dressing.  Even the picky one who ate the eggs, bacon and chicken loved it!

This was a very good basic recipe. My husband requested Cobb Salad, even though he can't stand hard-boiled eggs or tomatoes. (So it was basically a chicken and bacon salad.) But, we both enjoyed it.

This is great! I left out the avacado as we aren't fans. I also used a mixture of rommaine lettuce and spinach.  Kids and husband loved it.  It was a great salad that I will definately make again.

Great recipe!  I made this salad for a ladies' game night, and let me tell you, all the ladies raved over it!  There was nothing left!  I used spring mix/romaine for the lettuce and it was so crisp and fresh.  I also added some sliced olives and mushrooms for more texture and color.  This was a great "company" salad.

I love Cobb salad as traditionally prepared here. I also love it with seafood-Crab/lobster,scallops, tuna fish/salmon (all previously cooked). The best thing is you can make this salad with any ingredients you want, with any dressing you want. As for the lady that didn't like so much lettuce, cut back on the amount!

I don't understand the poor ratings on this recipe. Its a Cobb Salad for Petes sake! Either you like this type of salad or you don't. The intention behind posting is to show the ingredients & how they're presented on the plate. People should already know if they like ANY of the ingredients & omit if needed. Some people are just born negative I guess...

This is a really good salad. The only thing I changed was using thinly sliced yellow onions instead of green, and I sliced the tomatoes instead of dicing them. I also used rotisserie chicken for easier prep.

We loved this. We have salads quite a bit this just gave me an idea of a different way to put it all together.  My daughter loved it and asked for it again. We'll be having this about once a week I will just switch out the ingredients.

This was delicious. I used a spring mix instead of iceberg (just don't like it) and a dressing of EVOO, white wine vinegar and Dijon mustard. Marinated chicken breasts in Italian dressing over night and grilled it on my Big Green Egg. Even hubby liked it and that's a big deal. Thanks for the recipe. Will do it again.

Excellent and satisfying dish.  My husband loved it.  I used grass fed bacon without additives so I could say it was a healthy dish.  I've been reading lately that fat is actually good for us, in moderation of course.  Unfortunately, I didn't have an avocado on hand.  Used olives instead.  This recipe would work for a "salad in a jar".  Put the dressing of your choice in the bottom of a quart jar, then the tomatoes, then onion, then avocado.  Sprinkle a little lemon juice over avocado to prevent browning.  Add egg, then bacon and top it off with your choice of lettuce.  Beautiful!  And delicious & healthy too!

I altered the recipe slightly and made it without onions and with a light honey mustard dressing. Will continue experimenting with tomato types for this salad to find the perfect one.

I was so eager to eat this salad that I forgot the avocado. IT was still a 5/5 though! I cant wait to NOT forget the avocado next time!

Cobb salad is my favorite! Instead of tomatoes,I like to use pico de gallo. It give a little kick. Also, I prefer to use Marie's blue cheese dressing.  Yummm

leave out what you dont like, and add what you do. i usually add deli turkey breast and shredded carrots. i leave out bleu cheese and tomatoes. thats the beauty of making this salad at home. i am a texas girl, so ranch dressing on salads is the only way to go for me :-). your favorite dressing would be your best bet obviously.

Loved this one!  Served it for my Mother-in-law's Scrabble luncheon and it was a huge hit.  I substituted BBQ Chicken deli meat, cutting it into strips for the chicken and it gave a nice flavor which complemented the blue cheese.

This is a hearty salad.  I added a few cashews to it and used the ranch dressing you make (adding buttermilk and mayo to it).  My husband gobbled it up.

This was GREAT.  We enjoyed it for dinner (family of 6!) and my meat-loving husband was fed, full, and happy!
Serving suggestion: I made a yummy whole-wheat blueberry oat bread to accompany - like a side and dessert at once!

This is a great recipe. I made it with 6 slices of bacon, 6 cups of lettuce (3 cups head lettuce and 3 cups baby romaine mix) and added a can of garbanzo beans. I prefer it with French dressing, but put out several choices.  It was a big hit.

I used blue cheese dressing instead of ranch as a personal preference. I also used Bibb lettuce as it's what I had on hand. It makes a pretty salad that is nutritious and delicious. I think I would prefer it with something crunchy like a crouton that's been broken up a bit finer.

So good! I made this as a side dish to go with some tilapia (so I skipped the chicken). I may add some diced chicken to the left overs for my lunch tomorrow. Great recipe, and one that I'd make again! Thanks for sharing.

Will definitely make again!  Easy, healthy, delicious.  I used romaine, personal preference.  Next time I make it I will layer the ingredients instead of putting them in rows on top of the romaine.  And I will add peas.

I LOVE this salad! Cobb salad is one of my favorites. I'm trying to eat more vegetarian meals, but I can still enjoy this salad by using fake bacon and chicken. It's so versatile! I can't get enough!

Great as written.  To make it more like the cobb salad I had in Key West - add black beans and corn and shrimp, fish, steak or chicken.  Also, use a variety of greens.  Omit onion.

I love a good Cobb salad. I used bacon bits (real bacon) because that's what I had around. I forgot to add the blue cheese, but it turned out great anyway.  Instead of bottled dressing, I served it with the Ranch Dressing II that I found on this site.

Set it up like a salad bar and let everyone use just the ingredients they like = happy family. We were out of chicken so I used some leftover turkey and ham, but next time I would like to try it with the chicken. With so many goodies on top, what's not to love?

Followed exactly. Wasn't impressed. It was good enough but didn't need a recipe for putting together a salad. I even made mine to look fancy like the pic, but was disappointed.

I love cobb and chopped salads, but haven't had one in a long time! I didn't bother measuring the lettuce and just placed the amount I wanted on the bottom of the bowl. We placed the other ingredients in separate bowls and added however much we wanted on top of the lettuce. Subbed the blue cheese for feta (we both dislike blue). If you think about your favorite salad, the components (ingredients) are simple to come up with. This recipe provides the perfect fix for a cobb salad and is easily modified as is any other salad. Thanks for providing a good recipe for a cobb salad!

I love a good Cobb. This recipe is pretty standard, though I find Ranch dressing a little boring (I use either Blue Cheese or a red wine vinaigrette. One time in Hollywood I ordered the salad and it turns out my elderly waiter was the son of one of long-time waiter at the Brown Derby, where it was invented. My waiter had also worked at the Brown Derby as a busboy. He said it was a different style salad back then, the same ingredients, but all chopped up and tossed.

These are the kinds of salads I dearly love.  Lots of veggies and just about anything that is left over in the refrig.  I live alone and do not eat out very often.  I often buy the chicken 
pre- cooked from the store.  Easier for me.  My daughter and I had a huge salad for lunch today, cooked chicken, apples, beets, romaine lettuce, chopped celery, petite tomatoes, (homegrown),  and a creamy yogurt dressing.  Yum

The Brown Derby-Beverly Hills was my first client.  Sally Cobb, Bob Cobb’s widow, was trying to keep the Derby afloat at a time when the entire restaurant scene in Los Angeles was changing.  I used to love the Brown Derby Cobb Salad and it's best to start with the classics, so here's the recipe along with the folklore of how it was invented. 
"One night in 1925, Herbert K. Somborn was chatting with Abe Frank, the manager of the Los Angeles Ambassador Hotel, and Sid Grauman of Chinese Theater fame; and as idle chatter goes remarked, "You could open a restaurant in an alley and call it anything or you could even build it in the shape of a hat and if the food and service are good the patrons will come flocking.  "To achieve the standards set for this little Derby, Somborn, the husband of the celebrated cinema star, Gloria Swanson, selected a young friend who had been raised in the restaurant business.  This was Robert H. Cobb the combination food checker, steward, buyer, cashier and occasional cook when the first Derby opened. 

During its first four years the original Little Hat Derby added only two items to its menu—a salad and a cake.  The salad was almost an accident. Bob Cobb, growing weary of the steady hot-dog-hamburger diet, found an avocado in the icebox. He chopped it up, along with some lettuce, celery and tomatoes, plus a strip of bacon and some salad dressing, and had that for his dinner.  Several days later he tried it again, adding other ingredients which he h

.......Tis the time of year for this great Cobb Salad!!!! This morning... I made it spot on according to the recipe!! I even served it up looking like the picture. My palate tells me that my fresh Jersey garden grown tomatoes and shredded lettuce are the bomb for this dish. All the ingredients work very well together. I did individual limited experiments using Feta Crumbles, Sweet Goat Cheese Crumbles, Farmer's Cheese Crumbles and came back to the Blue Cheese Crumbles as per instructions. The Avocado I used was ripe, soft and cold. The Apple/Cherry smoked bacon I sliced was on the thick side..... and open charcoal grilled up to make crumbles. I tried a variety of dressings, Blue Cheese, Italian, EVO Oil/Vin, Lemon Juice/Oil, Lime Juice/Oil, ........  with this Cob Salad stay with the recipe....... less is more!! Kudos to you for submitting this great salad!! Thanks for the inspiration too!
Semper Fi! Godspeed!        OCFISHGUY

I love Cobb Salad...I normally do not add dressing to my salad...I just add more avocado and crumbled blue cheese for flavor...dice up the avocado into the salad really well so every bite has some avo and blue cheese.

If you are a bit lazy, you can add in Costco chicken (it's pretty good with a cobb salad) or even BBQ chicken !

Throw some sweet corn or baby corn...maybe even some flash boiled asparagus...I sometimes throw in carrot peels too

My favorite salad ever! I don't use blue cheese - instead, I substitute ranch dressing for Bolthouse Farms Chunky Blue Cheese Yogurt Dressing. You save a bunch of calories by using no cheese and using the yogurt dressing, but the flavor is still spot-on and delicious!

I used Feta cheese instead of Bleu Cheese, and served it with a nice Ceasar dressing. At Thanksgiving, I substituted left-over turkey for the chicken, for a great way to use leftovers. Loved the recipe.

Awesome. Was looking for a dinner for the hot weather and this arrived in my mailbox. I made it exactly to the recipe except we have some blue cheese non-lovers here so I used  chunks of jalapeno monterey jack cheese instead. Saw the recipe for the Brown Derby dressing but went with Bacon Ranch in the end. This is a keeper.

My FAVORITE salad to order in a restaurant.  This one did not disappoint.  I added a row of diced cucumber as I wanted to use it up.  I had the bleu cheese crumbles on mine and added feta to DH in place of the bleu.  We each used our favorite dressing as we're not huge fans of ranch.  Great, filling salad that presents itself very well.

Cobb salad is one of my favorites when eating out and I can get a little fussy about what makes a good cobb salad.  This one is very good.  Don't  hesitate to use the blue cheese veey sparingly (or not at all) if you don't like blue cheese.

Great basic recipe, I forgot the green onions but it was fine without them.  I used the dressing from the BLT Salad recipe on this site.

We really enjoy a good Cobb salad.  This is a good start to one.  Use whatever cheese, dressing and veggies you like.  I use a dark lettuce as it has more nutritional value than Iceberg could ever have.

Perfect and delicious. Hard to beat a Cobb salad. I put cheddar on my husband's as he is not a blue cheese fan. Very yummy and filling!

We loved it.  I made it exactly as written except that I didn't have green onions, and  I used a deli roasted chicken.  I might try different dressings eventually, just to change things up, but Ranch dressing is good on it for sure.

I haven't had a cob salad since I was living at home with my parents!  My mom made them often.  Pretty much anything goes with a cobb salad...made a couple changes to this one, just did red onion instead of the green, feta instead of the blue cheese, and added some sliced pepperoncini's.  Everybody used their favorite salad dressings and dinner was enjoyed very much!  Easy and quick, especially when you have leftover chicken!

Great recipe. However I replaced the ranch dressing with yogurt, salt and garlic powder. Tastes great and reduces the calories.

I used turkey bacon and left out the blue cheese and avocado since I did not have any. Even without them, the salad turned out pretty good. Next time I'll make sure to add those two. I did not need much dressing either.

exactly as it should be. my only regret was that the ranch we had was a little too sweet for this dish, go with something along the lines of a thick buttermilk ranch.

What a nice salad. The addition of blue cheese really adds a nice flavor, too. Recommend making this one. It's such a nice change and it doesn't take too long to make... well worth it.

I can't believe that a salad can be so good!  I didn't change a thing.  I hardly ever use avocado (and my boyfriend chose not to have it on his salad), but I put it on mine and I think it was fantastic.  So buttery and good.  Great recipe!

I made this last night, and it was perfect!  or so I want to think since I was so eader to eat that I forgot to add the sliced eggs I had ready for the salad! only at the end of the dinner my husband asked "and what are you going to do with those sliced eggs?  I thought they were for the salad" Oops! they ended up in an egg salad for work sandwiches, and the Cobb salad did not suffer from the missing 1/2 egg per serving! I served the salad with teh Ranch Dressing II in this Web and it was truly a success!  Great and simple recipe - a complete meal for a pretty day!
