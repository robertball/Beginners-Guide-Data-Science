This was an easy pie to make - especially as it is done in a blender.  I didn't have arrowroot so used tapioca starch and quite a bit more cinnamon.  I was concerned as they only filled my pie crusts about 1/2 full but towards the end of the baking the didn't rise. They are just out of the oven - took about an hour (not 40 minutes) and we haven't tasted them yet.  I'll update on that later.  They didn't "smooth out" on top like the traditional (egg & milk) version, but I think with some coconut cream on top they will be beautiful.

It's hard to do pumpkin pie without milk or eggs. So kudos to this recipe for attempting it. The pie definitely didn't cook in the time frame suggested; I kept watching it and protected my crust with aluminum foil to keep it from burning while I waited/watched for the center to "set," like a pudding, which is a big difference from "firm." In the end, mine didn't really have a custard-like, firm texture like regular pumpkin pie. It was slightly thicker/firmer than pudding. I did not have arrowroot so I used corn starch (a substitute) and the pie had a starchy aftertaste. 

Our pie was edible, and my allergy-ridden hubby enjoyed it. Poor thing, he hardly can have any dessert, not able to have dairy, soy, wheat, or eggs. My guests (family) ate it graciously, but none of them wanted seconds. My pie turned out ARMY GREEN, too.
