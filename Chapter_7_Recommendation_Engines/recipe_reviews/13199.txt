I am of chinese descent and these are great!  I grew up going to authentic wonton noodle houses and also helped my parents make them at home too.  The wontons must be cooked in boiling water separately and then served with chicken stock.  I have made these many times and different variations.  Usually, I will substitute diced shitake mushrooms (soaked for several hours) in place of the shrimp and serve them with campbells chicken broth.  This time, I followed the recipe but also added a bit of wood fungus too (soaked a few hours & sliced finely -- it's also put in hot and sour soup).  I make a big batch and freeze for later.  Frozen wontons make a quick and wonderful meal for those nights you feel like you can only boil water!

it's a good starting point. but there were important things i felt you left out. you shouldn't moisten the edges with water.. instead, mix in one egg per pound of meat you use in your stuffing prior to stuffing the wontons. it helps to keep everything together

I added 1 Tbsp soy sauce, 1/2 tsp. sesame oil and 1/2 tsp fresh grated ginger to the plain chicken stock and YUM! It adds so much depth to the flavour of this soup. Also, I boiled the wontons in water for approx. 5 min before adding them to the soup; it helps to ensure your filling is cooked thoroughly and keeps your broth clear when you add them to the soup later.

Especially after a recently awful attempt at a similar wonton recipe, I was wary to try another, but was pleasantly surprised.  Omitted the shrimp, don't care for it much.  I love that the pork loin is finely chopped instead of using ground pork, it gives it a great texture that isn't pastey or chewy like some recipes.  Used rice vinegar instead of wine because I had it on hand, not sure how much this effected the flavor.  Also, I would recommend to anyone who wants to try this to either chop the ginger VERY finely, or simply grate it.  I got the occasional bite of a small chunk of ginger, not so good =).  Anyway, a fantastic wonton recipe that I will use all the time.
Btw, I accidentally chopped a little more than 1 tsp ginger, so I added the remainder to the stock.  Wouldn't recommend doing something like that unless you REALLY love ginger.  It ended up being a little overpowering, and I think I only probably added about 1/4 tsp to it.

Edit: if you have complaints about the broth, that is not the recipe's flaw: it's mediocre broth. Consider adding some kick with a splash of rice vinegar and a little grated ginger (have invested in a grater since my earlier post, what a fantastic tool!)

Absolutely delicious! I made this soup for Chinese New Year this year and it was fantastic! My family couldn't get enough of it, there was even "words" over who would get the leftovers. I used ground chicken breasts instead of pork and no shrimp (personal preference) but followed the rest to a "T". I found that if you cooked the wontons in boiling water first, then put them in the soup 10 minutes before serving, the resulting soup was flavourful but not murky or cloudy.

Excellent recipe.  A quick hint for saving wontons for the freezer.  Freeze individually on a cookie sheet, toss in a freezer bag and you can retrieve as many as you want.  Good sauted for unexpected guests when you need something to munch on.

This was very good!  I went to two different grocery stores and neither had wonton wrappers.  Therefore, I bought a package of egg roll wrappers and cut them in half.  The noodles were thicker than I like, but the filling was still yummy.  The trick to preventing the wontons from becoming a gloppy mess is to cook them in boiling water first, then putting them in the broth.  I also had some left over bok choy from the stir fry that I was also making so threw that in the soup during the last 2 minutes of cooking.  Wonderful!

I'm not particularly savvy when it comes to soups or Asian food, but I pulled this one off with ease.  The filling was so good I considered ditching the wontons and grabbing a spoon!  I didn't have rice wine so I used a bit of rice wine vinegar instead, and it turned out fine.  Like others, I recommend boiling the wontons separately and then adding them to the broth before serving.  I also added another can of broth; there didn't seem to be enough to accommodate two dozen wontons without having a really crowded bowl of soup.

*GREAT* recipe! Tastes just like at the restaurant, my husband asks me to make this on a regular basis now & since I keep the filling pre-made & frozen it's easy to throw together for a quick meal on nights when I don't really feel like cooking. Thanks!

The perfect soup on a cold night. My boyfriend made this recipe for our Chinese dinner, and it was so easy.  Instead of using the shrimp, we used lobster pieces. It was very good.  He also precooked the wontons so they did not get gooey, which helped a great deal from advice from others. Thanks for a great recipe!!

Okay I eat/make A LOT of wonton soup and this is a very, very good base recipe.  Let me make some suggestions that will hopefully help someone: 1. add some breadcrumbs (not too many) to mixture and an egg; this will cause the filling to stay together and gives it sealed in flavor.  2. do not use just water to seal the wonton wrapper.  Use 1tbs flour and 1tbs water (mix together to form paste) to close wonton wrapper and fold into dumpling shape.  Also I suggest definitely boiling the dumplings in water for 4-6 minutes before putting them into boiling broth.  I add 1-2 tsp of soy sauce into my broth (this depends on taste).  Hope this helps!  Love this recipe!!

Awesome! It was a bit time consuming, however, it was well worth the effort. I used ground veal instead of pork loin, it was what I had. I didn't have rice wine, but I think it turned out alright. In my soup stock, I used almost 5 cups of broth, 3 was simply not enough. I skipped the sugar, I am not big into sweet wontons. I ended up with way more than 24, I made 56. Next time I make it, and I will, I think I will use twice as much shrimp and half the pork (veal) as the flavour was more meaty than shrimpy, which I think I might prefer. I cooked them in boiling water first, which I would recommend. None of my wontons opened during cooking, but I watched a video on youtube to make sure I folded them well, and my wontons were floured, which helped when sealing them. I simmered a whole green onion, some whole cloves of garlic, and some coins of ginger in the broth and removed them prior to adding my wontons. As well, I added shitake mushrooms, which I soaked first, and added the strained water to the broth for flavor. I also threw in some bamboo shoots, which I sliced thinly, some soy sauce, and some bok choy.  My boyfriend loved it, and we both had several servings. Even better, I have 4 freezer bags of 10 wontons each waiting for the next time we're in the mood and want something tasty and quick. (I really appreciated the advice of freezing them on a baking sheet, now they're not clumped together!)

A very tasty and comforting soup! I grew up eating wonton soup and I love chinese dumplings. I use fresh ingredients and lots of freshly grated ginger. I love the ginger-y and garlic taste in my wontons. I omitted the brown sugar in my wonton mixture.  Did not have chinese rice wine but added light soy sauce, sesame oil, Hawaiian sea salt and black pepper for taste. Once I place the meat filling onto the center of the wonton wrapper, I moistened the edges of wonton wrap with water and seal the edges. I boiled them in a pot of water until they floated to the top then set them aside while I heated up my 3 cups of chicken broth. I added sliced char siu to my soup along with some mustard green cabbage. Lastly I garnished my soup with sprinkles of chopped green onions. A nice balance of flavors of the wonton and veggies with the hot chicken soup. This is also a wonderful meal especially for those cold rainy nights!

This recipe is only a starter recipe.  Make warwonton soup! Cook the wonton as noted in the recipe but instead of plain chicken broth add little bite size pieces of broccoli, lots of pea pods, any kind of mushroom, little bigger pieces of pork (cooked), a little red pepper, sliced water chestnuts,or any other veggie that you desire.  Add these veggies or others about 3-5 mins before you put in the wontons.  Cook till crisp/tender then add the wonton.  Makes a much better soup!

We used this for our Chinese New Year's feast, and all agreed this was pretty close! Remember to pre-boil the wontons until nearly cooked (when they float basically) and finish cooking them in the heated broth. This keeps your soup from looking cloudy! Thanks for a great wonton formula!

This was a fantastic recipe BUT I had changed a number of things. First of all, instead of the pork/shrimp, I used lean ground turkey for the wontons. I also tripled the ginger (grated!), green onion, and added grated carrot, grated garlic, and low sodium soy sauce to the wontons. I also changed the broth - I used two cans of chicken broth and one cup of water, thickened with corn starch. I doubled the green onion that the recipe called for. I also added minced garlic, chopped carrots, broccoli, whole snow peas, and pepper to the broth. I allowed the broth to simmer for about forty minutes. After about thirty minutes of simmering the broth, I added two one-inch pieces of ginger to the broth, and continued to simmer. I separately boiled the wontons in a pot of water, and after they cooked, added them to the broth. Friends and family loved it! It was flavourful, healthy, and delicious.

I thought this recipe was delicious.  I did add some sesame oil with the broth as others suggested.  I also boiled the won tons separately in water first as others suggested.  I did cook my ground pork and shrimp to almost done prior to putting into the wrappers.  Very good.

This was very yummy.  Made a few changes, first, grated the ginger, and a clove of garlic, and used ground pork.  Also threw in a dash of sesame oil, left out the shrimp and brown sugar altogether, and put a little more green onion, cause we LOVE green onions in this house!!  To the broth, I added some chopped baby bok choy and sliced mushrooms, MORE green onions =) and threw it all in the pot at the same time as the wontons.... so so so so GOOD!!  Been wanting to make a wonton soup for awhile, thanks for the sharing!!

I absolutely love wonton soup and eat it by the bucket at any chinese food restaurant... and now this recipe ensures I can make my own delicious soup at home! With the amount of filling this recipe calls for, I make about 25-30 wontons which I find needs about 8-10 cups of chicken broth - because I love broth (half from a box and half from boullion cubes). I've used both chopped up cooked pork, and raw ground turkey and they were both good. To the broth, I add half a box of sliced mushrooms, a thinly sliced carrot, a bit of chopped cabbage and a couple chunks of ginger. I boil the wontons separately in water, then I boil the broth with all of the veggies and ginger in it, then remove the ginger chunks and add the wontons. Even my husband loves this, and he's usually not a big fan of wonton soup.

This soup is easy and tastes so good you might think it came from a restaurant. We didn't have shrimp, but it tasted great with just the minced pork.

I'm Chinese and this is a good traditional recipe.  I skipped the brown sugar and added more shrimp. I also cooked the won tons in a separate pot of boiling water before putting them in the stock.  These are also great deep fried with a sweet and sour sauce.

Just finished making this soup. Had to make it TWICE because my kids devoured it. I had bought a bag of Jimmy Dean sausage crumbles in a bag for my Thanksgiving stuffing but use it for this recipe instead.   
WOW. the flavor was fantastic. I also added minced ginger from a jar (Christopher Ranch) and quite a bit of sesame oil to broth. I also added sliced water chesnuts to broth to make it a little tiny bit more substantial.  YUM

I love these! I make a huge batch of these wontons all the time and freeze them. Then when I want wonton soup I boil the chicken broth and drop the frozen wontons in. They cook in about 5 minutes. I followed some others advice and add some sesame oil, soy sauce, and minced ginger to the chicken broth along with the green onions. If I am making wonton soup for dinner I'll add some chopped raw brocoli, sliced raw carrots and raw ramen noodles to the boiling broth for the last 2 minutes. These wontons are the best I've had including ones from restaurants and if you freeze them you can have dinner ready in under 10 min. Awesome!

Made this with the listed ingredients except I used tofu and chicken instead of pork and shrimp. My stock was homemade stock. As recommended, I boiled them in a big pot of rolling water before adding them to the broth. I did this a couple hours ahead of time, put them on wax paper single layer on a cookie sheet in the fridge, and then added them to the warm stock right before dinner. It was so much like the restaurant consistency. I only gave this 4 stars because after how murky my boiling water pot was, I can imagine how unappetizing that would look if I had boiled them straight in the broth. Boil first till completely cooked through!

A fantastic wonton recipe that is easy to prepare and cook. You may omit the shrimp and brown sugar, and substitute white vinegar for the rice wine, and the wontons will still turn out yummy. Add about 2 teaspoon of sesame oil to the raw meat mixture to enhance its flavor. Uncooked dumplings freeze well. I always make 2 to 4 batches ahead of time.***FREEZE: each dumpling individually. Once frozen, they can be stored together, each layer separated by a thin plastic film, paper towel, or foil. The broth is mediocre, but perfect for those days you don't want to spend time cooking in the kitchen. Just throw in a few frozen dumplings and cook till well done; a tasty meal in under 10 minutes!

Yummy!!  My whole family loved this soup.  I omitted the shrimp because I didn't have any.  I also followed another reviewers tip and precooked the wontons.  Don't do that.  The pork was a bit dry and the wontons too mushy.  It would have been perfect had I not done that.  I did add extra soy sauce and some sesame oil to the soup.  It was great.  TFS!!

Amazing. This is exactly what Wonton Soup at high quality restaurants tastes like. My husband doesn't eat pork so I used ground veal instead. The veal is closer in texture to pork than ground beef and it was the perfect substitute. I also garnished the soup with some bok choi, napa cabbage, sliced fresh mushrooms and left over shrimp bits. This made it really pretty and added some nice texture. You only need a leaf or two of the bok choi and cabbage, so just pull a couple off the heads at the grocery store instead of buying the whole head. This saves a lot of money.

Thanks for the delicious recipe. In place of the pork I used freshly ground chicken that I ground with the grinder attachment on the kitchenaid.  I added finely minced onion and garlic, and an extra tablespoon of soy sauce in with the meat mixture.  It was outstanding.  I doubled the recipe and fried some wontons and they were amazing too.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was wonderful!  I used rice vinegar instead of rice wine because that is what I had.  I also added a little bit of garlic to the wontons.  I took others advice and cooked the wontons in water before adding them to the stock. My husband and I ate almost the whole pot!

The wontons were great. I used round wonton wrappers so they actually looked like Chinese PotStickers. 
I also modified the wonton filling:
Mix togetther in a large bowl ground turkey (much healthier), 1 tsp sesame oil, chopped scallions, 1/4 onion, 1 tsp garlic salt, grated 1 tsp ginger, and 1/2 cup ground shrimp. 

I definately will be cooking this again!

I just can't thank you enough!  As someone who does not eat pork and who has moved way too far from THE ONE Chinese restaurant that offers chicken wonton soup (did I mention that I'm addicted to the stuff?!), I am beyond thrilled that you posted this recipe.  Truth be told, I was very hesitant and prepared myself to be disappointed.  I replaced the pork with ground chicken and just threw some beautiful, large cooked shrimp into the broth along with some bok choy and it was FABULOUS!  Better than the restaurant version.  If I could give it 10 stars, I would.  No doubt, this recipe will be in my family for years and years.  Again, many thanks!

We had fun with this recipe this on New Year's Day. Making the filling was pretty straightforward except I couldn't find Chinese rice wine, so I used the rice wine vinegar and I substituted chicken for pork as that was what I had on hand.  I hadn't made much Asian food before except for stir fry, so finding the wrappers was a challenge until someone told me they were in the refrigerated produce section of the grocery store.  Instead of chopping the fresh ginger root, I peeled back the skin and used a fine grater.  The fun part was that the kids and I filled and folded the wrappers together, which reduced the prep time by quite a bit.  The best part is they want to do it every year now.  I would make sure the meat used is precooked, as it doesn't take long for the wrappers to cook and I boiled it in the chicken broth and didn't have any trouble with cloudiness.  I also doubled this to feed our family of four.  Glad I did, as it made just barely enough for us.  Very delicious!

This is even better than take out.  I used canned shrimp and that is the only change I made.  Awesome recipe! Also, these freeze great. All of the extras I put straight into the freezer and when I'm ready to use I simmer in the broth for only 1 minute more. They actually hold together better that way.

Made a few modifications.  Used leftover pork, chicken breast, mushrooms and onion finely chopped.  Added balsamic vinegar instead of rice wine and also added about a teaspoon of fish sauce.  Crushed one half of a dried red chili into broth for a little kick.  Hubby said it was the best soup I ever made plus it was very lo cal.  Will definately make again.  The wontons will overcook and fall apart if you cook it ahead of time.  Can fix everything else and add them at the last minue.

Very simple to make and very good taste.  I used Maggie Boullion cubes for the stock, so the soup was terrible.  If you want a more authentic taste, it's best to make your own stock using chicken/bones.  I used the recipe on allrecipes.com for wonton wrappers, and they turned out ok.  I prefer my wonton wrappers ultra thin.

This was amazing!  I don't eat pork, so I used turkey instead, and did this little wrappy thing that I saw on Emeril's website where he takes the wonton mixture and wraps it in napa cabbage leaves, then ties them with a green onion.  Mix a few of those in with the wontons, and it makes the soup so much prettier.  I followed the suggestion of another contributer and boiled the wontons in water before putting them in the broth, and they didn't make the soup thicken (I think because it gets rid of the cornstarch on the wonton wrappers) and the flavor was awesome.  Will make again on a cold day.  Yum!

The hardes part of this recipe is actually putting together the won-tons.  Once this is done, the soup is a piece of cake.  Taste was good and I have 3 dozen won-tons in the freezer for future 10 minute soups!

Absolutely delicious... making the wontons are rather time-consuming, but well worth it.  I used ground pork, skipped the shrimp and just used a little extra pork and it came out great.  I also added extra chopped ginger (cut into matchsticks) to the broth for some additional flavor - was a huge hit with the entire family.

This was a wonderful recipe.  I followed it exactly except that I added some chopped carrots to the chicken stock.  I did boil the wontons in water before adding them to the stock.  My husband who seldom eats leftovers took the leftover soup to work the following day and said it was just as good as it was the night before.

This was so delicious! It was exactly the flavors I was looking for. The only change I made was out of convenience, I didn't add shrimp and I used fresh ground pork. I wonder how amazing it would have been if I had followed that part of the recipe. I also cooked my wontons seperately in water and then added them to the broth at serving time. For my broth I added some sesame oil and soy sauce and it was superb. Definately going to be making this over and over again.

I wasn't happy with how mine turned out!  They looked great, but I found them very bland and dry.  The only explanation for dry pork, is because I used rice vinegar (as per suggestions) instead of oil.  They next batch I may use oil and vinegar, double the spices, and add salt, garlic, and paprika.

I love Chinese food. Unfortunately, this did not have the authentic Wonton Soup flavor I was looking for. I think this recipe has potential, but it needs a lot of tweaking. As suggested by other reviewers, I cooked the wontons in a pot of boiling water before adding them to the broth. I'm very glad I did too. The residue left in the pot of water is not anything I would have wanted in my soup. The broth is a little bland and lacking a lot of the extra veggies that restaurants through in. Next time I'll definitely add cabbage and bamboo shoots. My biggest gripe about this recipe was the thinness of store bought wonton wrappers. About half of them fell apart and all of them were soggy. I will try this again with the alternations mentioned above and use homemade wonton wrappers next time.

very simple and delicious! i definitely recommend using ground pork because it is more authentic and easier to work w/. i saw that a few people omitted shrimp but i thought it added a great flavor and consistency. i also substituted rice vinegar for rice wine because i bought the wrong thing but it still came out great! my boyfriend and i both love ginger so i added just an extra bit. i didn't have any problems w/ the wontons becoming gooey as i read in some reviews, and i had boiled it directly in the stock because that seemed to be easiest. i garnished the wonton soup w/ green onions but also added cilantro and just a dash of sesame oil. yummy! some tips i would give would be to not overstuff and when you are making the wontons, lightly flour a baking sheet to line them up as you go. i doubled the batch and left the rest in the fridge and found the bottoms to be just a bit sticky.

I challenge anyone eating this to guess that it wasn't bought in a Chinese restaurant!  I used ground chicken instead of the pork and the shrimp, and I also added some sesame oil.  I substituted cilantro for the green onion in the dumplings, but did add the green onion to the overall soup.  Wrapping the won tons was a little time consuming (I doubled the recipe), but not difficult and well worth the effort.

I give this recipe 4 stars as it is written; however, after following some of the suggestions of the reviewers, I would give this recipe more than 5 stars if I could!  As per the reviews, we added soy sauce, grated fresh ginger, and just a drop of sesame oil to further flavor the broth.  Per the reviews, we also boiled the wontons first and then added them to the broth to avoid murkiness.  Now that we have made this often, we have tried other ground meats - such as ground turkey or ground chicken and have often omitted the shrimp if we do not have any on hand.  We cannot honestly state that we notice a large taste difference without the shrimp.  

This recipe is amazing and just so versatile!  We freeze a big bag of  these and either use them in broth, sear them in a pan and then finish off steaming them in the same pan to enjoy the wontons as pot stickers (sear on high for one minute - flipping wontons over to brown each side and then add enough water to just cover the bottom of the pan, cover, and reduce heat for 6-7 minutes), or we encourage our teenager to just make her own broth (usually hot water and a Ramen seasoning packet) and just drop a few frozen wontons in as her own meal.  Don't let making homemade wontons intimidate you; we conquered this recipe the first time and just watched a simple video on YouTube for folding techniques.  Love love love that my family can now make and customize these and freeze them to use them so many different ways.  Yum!!

I made this tonight and it turned out great!  I followed others and put a piece of ginger in with the broth.  I did get a few wontons that opened up.  Maybe I put too much filling.

Tried this one again, did some tweaking .. made it with chicken because the pork and shrimp didn't work for me.  Also skipped the ginger and added sesame oil and vinegar instead of the wine.  Wasn't bad.  Still needs something.

I don't know what happened. My wontons fell apart and were very mushy. And, I did not care for the pork/shrimp mixture..if I ever tried again I would use one or the other. Also, I did not like just chicken broth...I like more taste to my soup. =/

I'm so excited! Mine came out tasting EXACTLY like my local Chinese restaurant!! I tried everything to keep these from falling apart, (used egg wash, boiled separately), they still end up leaking the stuffing a bit. I think its unavoidable, but it doesnt take anything away from the flavor of the soup!

This soup was very good.  I added vegetables like mushrooms, carrots, peas and broccoli.  Just the way that I buy it at my local Chinese restaurant.  Will make again.

This is a great recipe and much easier to prepare than I originally anticipated!  I did add a large clove of garlic and more green onion than called for (about one full onion) and I liked this change.  Next time I make these wonton's I think I will try adding more shrimp, some water chestnuts and maybe some bok choy.

This was pretty good. I used beef instead of chicken broth.  It was not too far off from the soup I buy at the local Chinese place.  The wrappers were thinner though than those from the restaurant....making the wontons less substantial (no reflection on the recipe).  A good soup to accompany a homemade Chinese meal.

My husband doesn't like soup, so I pan fried half the wontons in oil for him and used the other half to make soup for myself.  Well, my wontons fell apart while cooking the soup.  But that was probably my fault and it actually turned out delicious anyway!!  Next time I will skip the hassle of making wontons for soup and instead make a Chinese Chicken Noodle soup using egg noodles instead of wontons and chicken instead of pork and shrimp.  The brown sugar, ginger, rice wine, soy sauce, and chicken stock made a WONDERFUL tasting broth.  As for the pan fried wontons I made for the hubby, they turned out awesome as well!  I will definitely make them again using this recipe.

This was delicious!  We used some leftover pork loin we had, we skipped the shrimp.  I will definitely make this again.  Glad to have a fun recipe to use leftover pork.  Thanks!

I'm giving this four instead of 5 because it did take a while to construct..With that being said, I was proud that I was able to make the wontons from scratch! I highly recommend going on YouTube and searching for a video on how to wrap/fold a wonton. The visual was VERY helpful. I made the recipe near exact, except I substituted turkey for the pork. The flavor of the wontons was DELICIOUS, and the simple broth complimented them well. I followed everyone's recommendation to cook the wontons in boiling water prior to the broth. The recipe does yield a high amount of wontons (24) so I did have plenty leftover to freeze for quick meals in the future.

My family loved this recipe! I had never made wonton soup before so it was a new experience. My stepson doesn't like seafood so I left out the shrimp and added more chicken broth for my husband who loves a lot of soup. It was fantastic! I will definitely make this again.

No need to order take-out when you can make a dish as good as this one!  It is perfect, served with a side of egg rolls.

This would have been 5 stars without the shrimp. I thought the shrimp gave it a weird taste.  With just pork or even beef would have been great.  I also added some seseme oil to the broth and cooked meat before filling wontons.  This was a great recipe thank you.  I will make it again for sure but next time NO shrimp.

Fantastic!  I could eat every night of the week.   I did add an egg into the meat mixture to help keep together.  I also cooked  the wontons in a sepperet pot of salted boiling water.  I do suggest if you cook wontons sepperatly to make sure you drain the cooking liquid completly before adding to the stock or the broth will turn out bland.

this is a good basic recipe to make wontons.  We added shredded carrots and mushrooms and it turned out great.  Definitely make these if you're looking to make wonton soup w/out going to the Chinese restaurant.

I thought this soup tasted absolutely wonderful!  There were a few changes that I would make myself, based off of what I've had most of my life.  I noticed other people added vegetables.  I would highly recommend that.  Perhaps some celery or mushrooms.  I also thought that the pork would be better if it were grounded or something, rather than having it chopped coarsely.  And I also thought that the soup could use more than 3 cups of chicken stock.  My husband loved this soup, but felt like there was not enough "broth" part for how many wontons were in the soup.  I doubled the amount of chicken stock which I thought would be perfect.  The next time I make this I'm going to add other vegetables, shrimp, and more chicken stock than the recipe called for.  The general flavor overall was really good though!

I`m of Chinese descent and have never tried to make these on my own. I was a bit baffled when my friend asked me to cook this, but this recipe was fantastic. I didn`t have rice wine on hand, but I read another reviewer used rice vinegar instead. I didn`t have that either - but I did have some powdered rice vingegar seasoning that is used to prepare sushi rice so I substituted that instead and the taste was still great.

Also, I use only egg whites for sealing up the wonton wrappers, so I put the single egg yolk into the filling.

Awesome!!!!
I played around a bit with my filling. I added some chives some garlic and ginger. 
DO NOT PRECOOK YOUR WONTONS THEN ADD TO SOUP!!
I made a lot so I froze some for later use(Uncooked).
I loved this recipe. 
Thanks so much for sharing.

I've making this now for a few years. It's so delicious. I don't change anything. I do freeze the wontons in freezer bags with about 8 to 10 in each bag for future use.

The only things I changed was that I used chicken instead of pork because that's what I had in my freezer. This was so good and my husband and I had so much fun making them!! I had a feeling I would love it, so I made double the filling so I could feeze it and make them again another time (I didn't really want to sit around for hours making 200 wontons). I'm excited to thaw the filling out and make some more another time.

I was a bit intimidated at the thought of making this, but it was a huge hit.  I've made it several times since and I freeze the wontons on a cookie sheet and transfer them to a zip-lock bag.  When making the broth, I cook the wontons first, otherwise the soup thickens.  Also, use cubed or canned broth.  The powdered broth is a bit slimey.

I used pork hamburger instead of pork loin.
I mixed the pork hamburger with the chopped shrimp,I added 1/2 tsp soy sauce, 1/2 tsp sesame oil, 1/2 can chopped water chesnuts,1 sliver fresh ginger, 1 tsp sugar, 3 green onion, salt and white pepper 1 tsp.
mixed this all up made the wontons I boiled them separately and set aside.
I added to the chicken broth 
BBQ pork chopped, green onion, carrot
that i cut into florets, baby bok choy 
and bean sprouts.
Boiled this until the veggies were almost done. add salt and pepper to taste.
When I serve the soup I serve the broth
and then each person can add their own wontons to as many as they would like.
I found if i boiled the wontons in the 
soup broth it made the broth too thick this way if there are any left over wontons they can just be reheated separately again as the broth.
I find the wontons also fall apart if cooked in the broth.
I hope this helps my 6 and 7 year old
love to help make the wontons.

Very good, and rather easy to make. I nixed the shrimp (it's a texture thing) and used ground ginger (I don't like a lot of ginger taste). I tried them fried and in soup.  The only drawbacks were that they were too sweet, like the wontons from places other than my regular one, and the wrappers were too thin for my taste.  I think next time I will get rid of the sugar, and use eggroll wrappers instead.  I would definately make these again though.

The filling is fabulous! Great flavour, great texture. Don't change a thing. (Although note to self: Don't use spring roll wrappers instead of wonton or egg roll wrappers -- you'll never get the wontons to seal, and the filling falls out when they're being cooked).

Just like my boyfriend's mother makes! The only thing that I suggest when combining your pork and other ingredients (i used ground pork) is to mix it in one direction to keep the pork moist. I also serve the soup with chinese egg noodles and spinach, yummy!

We both fried and made soup.  The soup was restaurant perfect and the fried wontons went well with orange marmalade preserves as a dip.

Very tasty!  Omitted shrimp, and added more pork, but vey nice.  Time consuming, and would make a bigger batch next time, as the recipe didn't make very many.

These freeze well - just place them on a cookie sheet in the freezer until completely frozen, then put them in freezer bags.

Very Good wonton soup.  Just like my mom's restuarants version.  Save some of the shimp and add it with brocoli and carrots to the soup for a nice hearty soup.

This was really good. I doubled the recipe, so it was very time consuming, but worth it if you have the time to kill. I added soy, sauce, ginger and sesame oil as suggested by another reviewer. Thanks! Better than my local chinese restaurants!

Loved it!!  I stink at making the wontons though.  They were ugly and most of them fell apart.  Anyone who has a trick for this, please let me know.  Next time, I think I may try to use whole shrimp and leave out the pork in order to save time.  I changed the following....
1.  I made more broth because we loved it!
2.  I added a little soy sauce to the broth.
3.  I added a little ground ginger to the broth.
So yummy!!!!!!

This was very yummy. I added some more vegetables to the soup and even some noodles to make it more filling. I doubled it since the wontons are the most time consuming part and I saved the rest in the freezer for an easy meal.

This is such an easy recipe to pull together! My husband and I loved it. I did make some adjustments, I typically don't measure while cooking; I ended up adding more ginger which I love anyways and used a whole green onion. I didn't have rice wine so I used rice vinegar instead and it came out fine. I also added roasted pork from the Asian market..YUM!

I used double the amount of shrimp to the same amount of pork.They came out a little to sweet so I backed off on the brown sugar a little. I used chicken base to make a light broth and simmered it with whole garlic cloves and a few coins of ginger.  I removed these before cooking the wontons in that liquid.  I did the same thing when making the frozen ones.  They did not get gummy at all.  I now make this recipe in double and triple quantities to freeze and cook whenever the mood strikes. Absolutely the best I've ever had!

These are so good! I've never attempted to make wonton soup before and I was suprised at how good they were! Like another reviewer said though, only add the ginger if you REALLY love it. I too felt it was too over-powering...other than that delicious!

This worked out great. I used ground veal instead of pork and I also added a little chopped spinach and grated carrot to the mixtire. I enhanced the taste of the chicken broth by adding a few drops of soya sauce and a few drops of sesame oil. Everyone in my family loved it!

Great recipe.  I took the advise of other reviewers and added an egg to my filling mixture and I boiled the wonton in water, adding them to the broth upon serving.  My family loved it!  This recipe is a keeper for my family.

Used ground pork and 2oz shitake. Added 1/2c bamboo shoots and sliced shitake mushrooms to the broth.  Kept the seasoning the same.  Something different!

I really loved these wontons.  I used my homemade chicken stock and simmered it with a slice of fresh ginger and a whole green onion to give it some freshness.  i served the soup with seschuan pepper and sea salt (1 part pepper to 3 parts sea salt, dry roasted til pepper starts to "pop", grind til fine) which gave some depth to the flavour of the soup.  YUM

Loved this soup -- and I can have as many wontons as I want. :-)  It does make a lot more than 24 wontons -- I used up a whole 12 oz package of wrappers.

I used my Kitchenaid mixer's  meat grinding attachment to grind up the pork and shrimp (and the onion, but that kind of liquified).  I also simmered white pepper, a couple tablespoons of dry sherry and sliced fresh ginger (removed later) in the chicken broth to give it more of an Asian flavor.

Unfortunately we are one of the minority on this one...I don't know what went wrong, but we really just didn't like this that much.  I couldn't finish this...and hubby said that it was "ok".  I don't think that we will use this again.  Thanks for the post, anyway.

This recipe was absolutely fantasic. I recently moved to a new town and could not find a Chinese Resturant with Wonton Soup that I liked so I decided to try making my own! I made the Wonton Wrappers (listed on this site) and I substituted the Chinese rice wine with vinegar, and I used chicken broth and ground pork. There was a lot of meat left over so I will put it in the freezer for my next soup!

Adored this recipe.  I used chicken instead of pork because of personal preference.  Next time I think I will use ground chicken.  It was fun to make the wontons too.  Not as hard or time consuming as I thought it would be.  I froze them and used them to make single servings of soup whenever I craved it.

I doubled the recipe when i made these. It worked out really well because you can freeze them. On nights that I didn't have time to cook i just boiled them in water until cooked and served them in warm ckn. broth. If you freeze them extend the cooking time or cut one in half to make sure you don't bite into some raw meat. I didn't have enough pork so I added chicken too. Delicious

this soup was super yummy. it tasted just like the one from pf changs. i used extra broth so it was more soupy and i only added the green onions and the chili paste was a good recommendation. make sure nt to over cook the noodles or they'll come out mushy

The wontons were really good.  Nice subtle ginger flavor.  I used a soy ginger flavored chicken broth for extra flavor and added shrimp, snow peas, sui choy and extra scallions.  The wontons would be really good on their own with a dipping sauce.

Great recipe! It would have been great the way it was, but I made it into "War Wonton Soup" for a main course. I tossed in some bok choy, thinly sliced chicken, shrimp, pea pods and mushrooms. I'll definitely make this again. In fact I think I will use this recipe to make dumplings and serve with a dipping sauce.

I added 1 Tbsp of soy sauce and  a 
1/2 tsp sesame oil to the chicken broth.

I pre cooked the wontons in boiling water for 5 minuets, then added the wontons to the chicken broth.

I will definitely be making this again.

This is a very good recipe.  I made it the first time as directed but the pre-made broth was a big turnoff.  The 2nd time I made it with homemade chicken stock and to that I added 1 cube of low-sodium chicken base,  this is something they always use in chinese restaurants, so if you want that little chinese restaurant flavor, add the chicken base or bouillon cube.  I also put in a few slivers of sliced chinese bbq pork  sooooo good!

Yes. I agree w/some of the comments that you should boil the wantons in WATER or  the soup will be cloudy and  kill the flavor. I also added garlic powder.

This was such a great recipe.  I used ground turkey instead of pork and also added some fish sauce to add a little more flavor. The won tons turned out perfectly and this was a huge hit. I will definitely be making this again.

A  comment about the broth.  Sorry I did not make the wontons although I do plan to sometime but the broth used was terrific.  I have previously just used chicken broth but the user suggestion to add soy sauce, sesame oil and fresh grated ginger did enhance the flavor immensely.  I also boiled my wontons in water first as suggested then simmered in the broth before serving. (frozen mini wontons from Costco are a decent option to fresh)

I made this recipe as directed and was very happy with the results! I've never attempted wontons before, but this soup tasted like the soup we order at our local Chinese restaurant. I couldn't find wonton wrappers, so I cut eggroll wraps in quarters and that worked perfectly. The recipe yielded way more than 24 wontons so I froze the rest to use later.

Update- I put the frozen wontons in boiling water for a few minutes before adding them to chicken broth flavored with sesame seed oil, soy sauce, and fresh ginger. They turned out perfect!

I love Won Ton soup - this was my first attempt to make it, and boy, was I pleased with the results! I used water to seal the wrappers, and it worked fine. I did have to make some adjustments because my market didn't have everything: used Rice vinegar, not wine; regular soy sauce, not light;  canned tiny already cooked shrimp, not raw; and for the soup I threw in Thai vegetables and what was left from the Wonton mixture. Cooking the wonton in the soup gave the liquid good, subtle flavor, and there were so many vegies in there, it didn't matter if it got cloudy. I froze wonton on a cookie sheet and now have plenty for the next few time - I can only hope it turns out exactly like this first batch did! Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Super easy to follow recipe.  I had misread the first time I read the recipe and thought it said Rice Wine Vinegar... it worked either way!

I like to buy the Chinese chicken broth from our local asian market - just tasted that much more authentic.

I got lazy and didn't want to chop pork, so I bought ground pork - works great!   

Easily add veggies, extra shrimp and meat to the broth to create a simple wor wonton

Amazing! I convinced my mom to let me make it for my her and the rest of my family one night and all of us love it! My family and I have not had Won Ton Soup for years, and it wasn't even homemade, it was the Costco brand that we used to eat. This has definitely proven to be an amazing, refreshing, Won Ton Soup. It is simple and easy to make, and a lot of fun to wrap! ;)

This recipe is delicious!  Make sure you use excellent quality chicken stock for the broth.  I use Minors brand chicken base and it is way better than some of the cheaper grocery store brands. Also, don't overboil the wontons or they get too soggy.

This was great. I substituted the pork and shrimp with ground turkey. But the broth needs work to really make this special. I doctored it up quite a bit.

Added soy sauce and sesame oil to the broth, but didn't change the wontons one bit. Delicious!

Good flavor, easy enough to make but the stuffing came out dry regardless of cooking time and the wonton ended up tearing quite a bit.

This just didn't suit for me. Hubby said "It's good" and had seconds, but we both added soy sauce to the broth. Perhaps I did something wrong, but my wrappers got VERY mushy.  Perhaps I should have let them dry after filling & before boiling, but the recipe doesn't indicate that.

It was pretty good. I didn't have chinese rice wine, so I used dry sherry instead. I also added sesame oil in the soup mixture & egg noodles to make it the authentic Hong Kong staple..Wonton with noodles. I think the filling would have tasted better if it has been marinating for a little while in the fridge before wrapping them in wonton wrappers.

This recipe just doesn't cut it at all.  The filling was truly inedible, I'm guessing because of the sugar.

What a great recipe. I used Isernio's Hot Italian Chicken sausage instead of the pork. I didn't have any Rice wine so I used Rice Vinegar. I also added some shreaded carrots. Super yummy!  Youtube has videos on how to fold the wontons.  Thanks for sharing.

Sorry but this did not work out for us.  I reduced the amount of ginger and still it overpowered the dish.  The tiny eggroll wrappers are tricky to work with but the spring roll wrappers would be too bulky.  I will let the pros at the chinese restaurant make this for me the next time I get hungry for it.

I have made this several times for my family and his friend.  They request it for a special dinner.  They are 10 and love it ginger/onion and everything.  Very filling and delicious.  I use rice vinegar in place of the white wine vinegar.  A little time consuming but the positive remarks are well worth it.

I made this tonight as part of our New Year's dinner and it was great!  I followed as written, and added a couple tbsp grated carrot (to the meat mixture and the broth) and a tbsp oyster sauce to the meat.  I did substitute ground pork and ground ginger bc that is what I had.  I found that there was not enough of the broth so I doubled it and that worked for us.  Thanks for sharing!

Changed nothing - certainly the best wonton I've EVER tasted. This can only be attributed to the recipe and has nothing to do with skill.

This soup was great after I took the advice of a few other reviewers. I added freshly chopped ginger (I got it in a package of storebought sushi), rice vinegar, and soy sauce to kick up the flavor of the broth. My 10yo, who loves wonton soup, said the broth tasted just like her favorite restaurant's soup. I also stirred in some fresh spinach leaves and cooked, thinly-sliced carrots when the broth was hot. I increased the chicken stock from 3 cups to about 10 cups, because I have a family of 8. Since the younger kids did not love this soup, next time I'll use about 6 cups of broth. I couldn't find any wonton wrappers so I used frozen potstickers, and boiled them in a separate pot before putting them in the soup. I'm sure it would taste even better with homemade wontons, and will look harder to find the wrappers next time I make this soup. There will be a next time, since it was delicious and so easy to make!

This may have been operator error, but I really found this tedious and rather pointless in the end. The recipe resulted in rather bland soup that I was disappointed in.

Not sure about this one. We liked the wontons but they were quite time consuming to make. I added some garlic, chilli & sesame oil to the filling & cooked the filling before assembling the wontons. We didn't really like the broth they were cooked in. It was kind of boring. Would prefer these deep fried or steamed with a dipping sauce as an appetizer rather than a soup.

This is a great low fat recipe. I used ground turkey instead of the pork and shrimp. I did not have green onions so I used finely chopped 1/2 yellow onion and dried chives. I used ground ginger instead of fresh. Threw in 1/4 cup of shredded cabbage cole slaw mix) I had on hand. The wontons are a lot of work, the flavor is worth the it.

Good recipe. Would suggest adding an extra 6-12 oz. of broth to recpie (especially if you plan on storing leftovers in the fridge). Also used ground pork for the filling in place of chopped loin. Not sure if that was a good move or not. But good recipe.

This was a delicious recipe and very easy - just a little time consuming with all the wonton wrapping.  The only problem I came across was not having enough liquid while cooking the wontons.  It came out alright although I was worried there wasn't enough liquid to cook them properly at first.  Next time I will add more liquid.  But I was still very pleased with this recipe.  Thanks!

This was excellent!  I took some reviewers' advice and omitted the sugar and shrimp, used ground pork and doubled the ginger.  Also added a can of sliced water chestnuts and some baby bok choy to the chicken stock.  Can't wait to have it again soon!

I used chicken and I roasted the chicken in the oven. Then, I put it in the food processor which gave it a nice texture. Then, I added the spices and they came out great. I really enjoyed this authentic tasting recipe for wonton soup.

Overall, this soup was very flavorless.  The broth in particular, needed something extra.  There are some good thoughts in other posts to add some additional flavor.

Wanting to use up a 1/2lb of ground turkey, I came across this recipe.  Talk about easy and versatile!  Almost anything can be added to the filling -- I minced some water chestnuts and added a dash of sesame oil.  Froze the wontons in individual servings for whenever the soup craving hits.  Would also be good steamed then fried as potstickers.  Thanks!

This recipe was great! I substituted white vinegar for the rice wine and didn't have any shrimp, but it still came out excellent. I had never eaten wonton soup before I made this recipe, but my husband and sister are fans and said this recipe was one of the best they've tasted!

Excellent recipe!  I added minced water chestnuts to give it that sweet crunchy taste.

I omitted the pork and used 1/2lb. minced salad shrimp, reserving some to float with the green onions and instead of all chicken stock, I used 1 can of chicken broth and 1 can of veggie broth. Wonderful Recipe!! So simple and tasty, my family raved about it.

The wotons were AMAZING - but the broth was bland, so I had to give it only 4.5 stars - I had a lot of left over meat so I will try frying the wontons tonight.  Thanks!

This recipe seemed a little plain at first, but I was wrong. The wontons are tastier than any other I've tried before! The broth could use a little something, though... I'm not quite sure what.

This soup was excellent! I added some extra chicken broth to make it more "soupy". I would recommend this to anyone who wants to make homemade wontons!!

Tastes just like my mom's! My mother used ground pork instead of pork loin, and also added a tiny bit of oyster sauce to the pork mix. I followed some other reviews as well and placed the finished wontons in chicken stock. This recipe is spot on!

The filling was not very good. I followed the recipe but the pork and shrimp mixture was coarse and overpowered the delicate wonton wrappers. The base of the soup was delicious, I need to find a better meat filling.

What a great recipe, and it was so easy to do I was surprised. I ended up making two batches andit tasted as good as anything I've ever gotten it any restaurant, I can't wait to try something else to go with it.

Very good. I cooked the wontons in water for about 4 minutes before transferring to the broth as other recommended. I also added 1 tbsp soy sauce and 1/2 tsp toasted sesame oil to the broth.

yum   needed more soy.  I went for a vegetable soup  rather than just wontons.  Sugar snaps,  green onions, mushrooms, chopped red and yellow bell pepper and sliced nappa cabbage.  Added the wontons after vegetables were tender and cooked for an additional 10 minutes over medium/low heat.  Delicious!

Not a shrimp fan but a huge fan of  of mushrooms, so omitted the former, and added the latter. Added Bok Choy to Soup. Fried strips of extra egg roll wrappers for crispy restaraunt-style noodles to eat in soup with green onions. Big hit with my family.

This was excellent. I might go just a bit easier on the ginger next time. I made a quadruple batch of noodles and a double of the stock base. My son loves the noodles. This is a bit labor intensive but worth it and not difficult at all! Thank you

Easy to make recipe and it is fantastic. I changed the chicken broth for vegetable broth and only used shrimp for the wontons. I added mushrooms to the soup and voila DELICIOUS!!! And now I value more the time of the people who make the wontons. It is a truly manual labor made with love.

It was amazing! I suggest going light on the ginger if you don’t like a kick, otherwise fantastic as is. And if you like the kick, you can add chili sauce which really enhances it

I made it exactly to the recipe, with only one minor change, I made the wonton wrappers  because you can't buy such things here. I used them as an entree in a 5 course fixed menu that sold for 8000 Rouble, I estimated the 6 wontons per meal were about 500 Rouble, everybody that had them (37 people) loved them and want them put on the standard menu, which I have now done. A great recipe sells itself   ...   ChefRod

Not anywhere near as good as restaurant wonton soup, this recipe seems to be missing something, maybe some salt or fish sauce. I would give it 3 stars but that wouldn't be fair since I made the changes others suggested, adding soy sauce, sesame oil, grated ginger, and baby bok choy to the broth. I also cooked the wontons in boiling water instead of in the broth. I think that was the mistake, since the pork grease and wonton starch ending up going to waste instead of flavoring the broth. Next time I would also use ground pork instead of chopped pork loin.

I made this with dinner last night.  The wontons were wonderful.  I thought I had made too many, so fried some of them.  It was a mistake.  The ones in the soup were much better.  Now I wish I had more!

I am so sad!  Saw this recipe in the list and was so excited!  Wonton fillings vary and this one looks good as well..... but it's just another wonton recipe that sits in chicken broth.  Wonton soup broth is so much more developed than that and I'm tired of seeing this cop out.  If not posting the recipe for wonton SOUP, then list it as soup wontons.  At least state to serve it in a consomme  mixed with a little chicken broth..... then you're at least getting closer to the real flavour.  Cheers

The Author of the recipe absolutely nailed it! I've always been a fan of Hot & Sour soup not caring much for wonton, that's not the case anymore as this soup was not bland like the wonton soups that you find in most restaurants, the soup was full of flavor! Thanks for yet another great recipe Allrecipes!

We made these twice - absolutely delicious! The filling was very tasty and we didn't make any changes. The broth is a bit plain so we added a touch of soy sauce, extra green onion, extra ginger and a spot of veggie broth. Highly recommend!

This was my first attempt at wonton making, so I really didn’t know what to expect, but the recipe seemed straight forward and simple. I opted to use ground pork instead of chopped, along with the shrimp and other ingredients listed, (only had rice wine vinegar on hand—worked fine), and added some chopped water chestnuts for texture. Don’t be afraid to add the brown sugar—it didn’t make the wontons sweet, but rather complemented the other ingredients. I added one egg to bind everything together as suggested by another commenter, as well as using one tablespoon of flour and water to create a paste to seal the wontons. It worked wonderfully and not a single wonton opened. I would highly recommend boiling the wontons in water for 5 minutes rather than in the broth to prevent the broth from becoming cloudy. Also, I used 5 cups of broth for the soup and simmered one tablespoon of finely chopped scallions in it for about ten minuets which added great flavor to the broth. Portion the broth into bowls, add three or four cooked wontons, and serve!  My wife loved it. I will make this again!

Followed the recipe exactly, but my family just wanted the wontons and not the soup. So, I dropped about 12 dumplings into boiling water and let them simmer for 5 minutes. Drained and added the next batch. I made a dipping sauce of soy sauce, white vinegar and minced garlic. It was delicious.

I made this following the recipe. The filling is tasty but I did not like the texture. Next time, I will grind it all with my meat grinder. I think it will punch it up.

Thank you for your recipe! Although I didn’t add rice wine (I didn’t have any) & I added a few extras to the broth (chicken & some veggies), I was very impressed. Really I can’t believe I made it ;) it was amazing!

Great base soup recipe - my family loves it.  It's easy to make and the wontons can be made in large batches to freeze for later.  It's also very low fat.  I did make some modifications.  I did not use any sugar in the meat mixture and  I added an egg and 2 tbsp bread crumbs to keep it together.  I used 5 cups broth and added carrots, 1 tsp of minced ginger, chopped water chestnuts, bok choy, 2 tbsp of miso paste, soy sauce and sesame oil for a richer taste. Additionally, I added small chucks of meat to the broth which we love to eat particularly in the winter.  As has been mentioned before, cook the wontons in boiling water until they float before adding to the soup.  Whatever your personal taste, this recipe is easy to modify to suit what you have on hand.

I love Wonton soup but never made it. This recipe was easy to make and it tasted great. I made it according to the recipe.  When I make it again, I am going to double the broth. We like it with a little more broth. Very tasty!

I used julienned carrots and snow peas in the broth, and my whole family loved it!  Easy to jazz up with spice or keep mild.  Only draw back was that won tons were pretty time consuming.  I'll give myself much more time for prep next time.

Great soup.  I made some modifications. Long story, but I had an issue with wonton wrappers.  I decided to ditch the wrappers and make wonton meatballs. I added toasted sesame oil to the filling. I also added egg to the filling/meatballs in hopes of having them hold together better, but they seemed more likely to fall apart.  I slid them into the simmering broth.  My six year old said the meatballs/wontons were her favorite part.  To the broth, I also added baby bok choy, shiitakes, and more shrimp.  My husband said it was one of his favorite all time soups.  Delicious and no leftovers.

I really liked this recipe! I made the wontons by boiling them, and it worked really well. However, make sure to seal the wonton wrappers well before you boil them, because they will come apart in the pot. Overall a great meal!

I followed the recipe to the letter and was quite amazed at the amount that the recipe produces, if you follow the recipe to the T you should yield around 100 plus wontons. I suggest for the average appetite that you and additional seasoning to the recipe as the mixture will come out bland, mostly saltiness to the mix. Other than that the recipe is spot on with that of a traditional wonton soup, and you will be most pleased with the results!!

Surprisingly easy.  I was always afraid to attempt this because I thought it would be hard.  It wasn't!  And better yet, it makes a lot which can be frozen and cooked later.  I did add a dash of soy and some sesame oil to the stock to help with the flavor.

I made this recipe, and added about a half a cup of chopped cilantro once it was cooked.  Very good recipe to play around with and enhance!

Made this last night and it was a huge  hit with the family.   My children helped make the wontons which was so much fun.  There is nothing like having children help make dinner - then talk about how much fun it was and that it tastes just as good as the restaurant.   We did take the advice of several others and cook the wontons in water prior to adding to the soup mixture.      We also made homemade egg rolls - Jimmy Dean recipe!

This is the second time I made this soup. This time was a rushed dinner, so I used some frozen potstickers instead of wontons. delicious. My husband had two big helpings!

I added sesame oil and soya sauce to the broth and it turned out great. Had no shrimp so just did pork but still turned out great. I added extra ginger, green onions, and brown sugar. I had lots of bok choy left over from a previous dish so added it to the bowls when serving. Great recipe.

I have made wonton soup for years, after taking a Chinese cooking course.  As far as I'm concerned, my home made soup has  been much better than the ones in restaurants.  The only thing I did differently is add finely chopped water chestnuts which gave a little crunchy bite!  I also use ground extra lean pork rather than chunks, which makes it easier to close the wonton squares.  I sliver some carrots and celery to give the soup colour and add before I bring the broth to a boil.  At the very end, I add a sprinkle of green onions.  My only downfall is that I eat the whole pot full when I'm finished since family are all grown and away!  Yes, it's a good idea to freeze the wontons and dump them in boiled broth, as you go along, for a quick meal.

Great tasting and reminds me of home. I cheated and used 1 lb of ground pork instead and kept the seasonings as written. Perfect! Only problem I had is the amount of soup I had to make in order to cook the wonton in is about 7 1/2 cups instead of just 3.

This recipe was good but I didn't really like the chopped pork loin.  I'm not sure but I believe at restaurants, they use maybe ground chicken or pork and I like that consistency much better.  Overall, the flavor was good however.  Just didn't care for the texture.

I made this recipe a few weeks ago when it was really cold in Texas (really cold = 50 degrees). My husband and I devoured every single wonton! I ended up overeating and made myself sick but it was worth every bite.

I was stoked to try this recipe based on the reviews, but it's very bland in taste, texture and appearance.  Its pretty much all the color of stock and does not look appetizing and needs more vegetables to give it some textural contrast and more flavor.  Overall I guess this was an easy beginner wonton, but I wouldn't make it again.

My husband and I loved them! I can't give it 5 stars because I used ground chicken instead of pork and shrimp and cinnamon instead of ginger so I don't know what the true recipe tastes like but my version was delicious.

This recipe was amazing. I added rice vinegar, cabbage, ginger and cours pepper to stock and it turned out great. Also used ground pork, turkey and shrimp in the wontons.

Very nice, though the broth was a bit bland.  I had to doctor it with soy, rice vinegar, ginger, etc...  As per other reviewers, I added egg and extra soy sauce to the wonton filling mixture.  Also, I only had egg roll wrappers, but they worked well (cut them in half).

I really enjoyed this recipe, however, I added a lot more than 3 cups chicken stock.  I think I had a total of 8 cups of stock.  I loved the filling for the wontons.  Very tasty!  I ended up adding a little sesame oil to the soup for added flavor.

All I can say is YUM! Fun and easy, just time consuming. I will definitely make more of these wontons and freeze them. I cooked them for 5 minutes in seperate water before adding them to the broth, through I don't think it was completely necessary.

This was a really tasty and easy recipe. I just felt the the broth could use a little spicing up so i added some hot sauce lime juice and rice vinegar to it before boiling the dumplings.

Good recipe--Had no wrappers and too cold go get some so I made homemade ones--took some time but the end result was fantastic. I never liked the slippery/rippy wrappers. I didnt have green onions so I used chives-worked good--also added a spoon of orange marmelade to give it an interesting kick. I didnt have any rice wine either. I made this today because it looked so good and I had most of the ingredients without going to the store. Really hit the spot! I used pork sausage that I had as well. I kept the broth basic-would have liked to add mushrooms next time.  I also added some sesame oil to the filling mix.

This is a good base recipe for when I'm craving wonton soup & its pretty darn good! But its still not quite as good as the resturants. Still, I'd make it again when I'm in the mood for some & don't wanna go out!

This was really delicious! I made it according to the recipe with the exception of the brown sugar. I used sweet rice wine, so I skipped the sugar just in case it would be too sweet, and it was perfect. Next time I make it, I'll try the modifications suggested by other reviewers ;)

I thought these were spot on. Very close to what I might order at a good chinese joint. I used regular versus light soy because I had none at hand.

I made the wontons from scratch. It was so easy and everyone was really impressed! My whole family (including the kids) loved this soup. Thank you for the great recipe! (I did use extra stock for extra broth, and added some finely diced carrot and red bell pepper for color and a vegetable boost.)

I made this just as the recipe for a gourmet dinner club. It turned out wonderfully! Time consuming but really pretty easy and very delicious! Thanks for the recipe!

This was really fun to make...once, it is a little bit of work(just time consuming) filling and folding all of the wontons but very yummy! It does turn out just like the restaurants, excellent.

Very delicious, I used a recipe I found on here to make the wrappers because I searched high and low and couldn't find them or egg roll ones

So Yummy! I actually didn't make the soup, I only made the wontons. They are very tasty and delicious. I don't think that they need a thing. Thank you so much for the recipe!

Changed a few things around as I was limited to me ingredients on hand but was still great. I love using a thick sweet soya sauce with Chinese cooking, so yum. Kids also had fun wrapping and rolling.

My family loved this soup but i wasn't crazy about the filling in the wontons. Was way too many wontons for just 2 cans of broth. Need much more broth. I also cooked the wontons in boiling water then added to broth. Will make this again for family but will try to fing a different filling for wontons.

Not real impressive, but okay. My husband said he would eat it again. I stuck to the recipe but we thought it was missing a little something. I didnot have any trouble with the wontons staying together. Will try again though.

Very tasty!  I tried making Wonton Soup this way, but they ended up being so mushy.  Perhaps I cooked them too long so the meat would be done.  I then tried frying the Wontons and they were GREAT!!  Yum-O!!

This was really good, but not as good as in a restaurant. I was'nt able to get the Wontons perfectly shaped like the professionals, but practice makes perfect, right? I'll make it again. Thanx for sharing!
