They're adorable, but there is a typo!  "Discard cut-out portions"??! Are you crazy? Lol.  It SHOULD read: Cook enjoys the spoils. :-)

Super cute! I used strawberry jam instead of frosting because I filled the cupcakes with strawberry jam and the frosting just seemed like too much. The toasted coconut is a wonderful idea!

A Big Hit!  I made this pretty much exactly by the recipe and found it easy to follow.  The only exception is that I made both chocolate and vanilla cupcakes according to directions on the boxes.  I used a grapefruit spoon to scoop out the centers of the cupcakes when cool.  At my house there was no need to discard the cut-out portions since I have a hungry teen.  Caution, keep a close watch on the coconut when toasting as it will burn quickly.  I placed the toasted coconut in a bowl and after frosting the cupcakes just inverted them in the coconut, gently rolling the edges around a bit.  I found it is better not to press down the center, since less coconut is needed in the center depression.  The candy eggs need to touch some frosting to stick well.  I used chocolate frosting for both the chocolate and vanilla cupcakes.  Both turned out wonderful and looked exactly like the picture.  I used Whoppers mini eggs.  These cupcakes were a delightful and tasty novelty for Easter, and everyone complimented them and even took pictures.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  I will make these every year from now on!

I made these for an Easter Bake Sale fundraiser for our ladies' auxiliary to the local fire dept. They were the first items sold! Easy to put together, inexpensive, and so cute. I made extras for my family and got the 5-star!
