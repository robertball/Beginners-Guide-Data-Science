Awesome and easy! I sauteed onions and added broiled, chopped asparagus to the sausage. It's important to let that mixture cool to room temp before layering over the cheese. And the mushroom soup gives it a wonderful flavor. All in all, this is a KEEPER recipe and one I'll make over and over with different variations, such as fresh mushrooms, green peppers, garden tomatoes, etc. I love recipes that can be tweaked and this is a perfect example!

This recipe is fantastic, and I took the easy way out! I used just plain ol' frozen sausage and I did the whole thing all at once rather than starting the night before. Also, just regular cream of mushroom cond soup and a little dijon mustard instead of dry mustard.

I made this recipe for a church breakfast. I did not care for the croutons on the bottom. It reminded me of gravy over bread. It did not have much flavor to me. The women at the church thought it was good. When I take something for others to eat, if there's nothing left but the pan? then it was good. I took more home than the empty pan.

Eggcellent recipe!  The overnight 'resting' is critical to the recipe because it really enhances the flavor and helps create the fluffy texture which really makes the dish.  I used fresh ground sausage fron our loal supermarket and added a teaspoon of sage.  If you don't care for sage, leave it out.  The sage did kick it up a notch though.
