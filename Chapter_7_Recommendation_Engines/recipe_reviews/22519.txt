I have made these for Christmas gifts two years in a row, and they turn out very well! It's worth the effort if you are a chocolate cherry lover, and it can be a fun assembly line candy to make with a friend. They really do need to sit for a couple weeks, though, to get that nice liquidy inside-- otherwise it's just a cherry wrapped in sugar paste.

These are better than store bought.  My grocery store only had 10oz jars of cherries, so I bought two.  The cherries were pretty small, so I was able to yield about 35 to 40 cherries out of the recipe.  Also, I didn't have any almond extract, so I used vanilla.  I made these on a Wednesday for Mother's Day that Sunday so they could sit for a few days and almost ate all of them.  I will definately pass on this recipe.  ***Warning*** I can't remember which brand of margarine I used the first time I made these, but the dough comes out different depending on the brand of margarine.  Land of Lakes comes out pretty sticky.

I had a lot of trouble working with these.  STICKY!  Everyone loved them...but I found them to be way too sweet!! A different recipe for the chocolate coating would help also, because the chocolate on it melted when left out for more than 5 minutes.  Not pretty:(

I have made these covered cherries for years now.  If they are "gooey" drop some powdered sugar on them, or coat your fingers.  Flower turns to a paste, so the cherries center won't melt down as they should.  As for the coating, regular candy melts are the most sturdy. Tips on chocolate, 1. rapidly chill it, it stays shiny. It will look dull if hardened at room temerature (but DON'T over chill it, it will crack!). 2. NEVER melt directly on the stove! use a double broiler or in 30 second increments in a microwave, stirring in between segments (don't use glass bowls, plastic only) 3. Avoid moisture, water or condensation at all costs! It will make your chocolate thick and clumpy, not good to use or look at! 4.  Whitish or "dusty" looking chocolate is not spoiled! It simply melted and reset too slowly.  

Thanks for sharing a splendid recipe!

I taught a class for children's cooking and we 
did this recipe with 15 children. It was quick and
so easy, all the kids loved it. Lots of smiles and sticky fingers... Thank you so much.

These are great, though I spiced mine up with ginger, cinnamon, and chili powder (I know that last ingredient sounds bizarre, but it adds a nice punch) and they were phenomenal!
Thanks Arlene!

This recipe will do 2 (10 oz.) jars of cherries and it isn't necessary to knead it on the countertop, just knead it in the bowl. Lastly, it needs one more tablespoon of margerine. Remember to place them on waxed paper to cool once their dipped in chocolate.

I made these last year for the holiday and everyone loved them.  but today I made a few changes and they are even better.  I used butter and let it get real soft overnight and I used heavy cream instead of milk.  When I melted the chocolate I only used one tablespoon shortening to make the consistancy perfect for dipping. (maybe a smig more)  A little trick so not to have such a mess is, use a teaspoon to scoop filling and drop onto wax paper.  place in fridge for 10 minutes and then flatten and return to fridge for another 10 minutes.  Now its easy to just wrap and slight mold the filling around the cherry.  Return to tray and refridgerate for several hours before melting the chocolate for dipping.  Fantastic recipe Auntylene, THANKS AGAIN.

I didn't have any corn syrup which is what my usual recipe calls for, so I was looking for one without it and I found this one, it tasted soo good! I especially liked the almond extract it called for, it gave it a nice flavor. I will store some away for a week or two so that I can enjoy them when the cherries have ripened and the white coating is nice and runny, thanks!

I made to try at home before I made them as a gift for my mother inlaw. They turned out great. So next I doubled the recipe and decided to soak half the cherries in spiced rum and the other half I made without. I soaked the rum ones for 4 days to make sure they had a punch than made as written.
 I love both ways.
My mother in law loved them too
Thanks for such a fantastic recipe

The better qulaity chocolate you use the better results you will have. Ghiradelli is the only brand I use and never have trouble with it I also hardly ever add any thing to the chcoclate. If I want to thin it as bit I may add butter  but never oil.

This recipe is good but very sweet. Everyone that came over didn't wait for them to liquify inside. It is best to make sure these are well chilled so they don't melt when dipping them in the chocolate. I used almond bark since I think its easier to use than chocolate chips.

Fun to make.  Just make sure you let them set for two weeks before eating.  durning Halloween I add a little more of the sugar dough,  squish is around and make it look like a mouse.  add slivered almonds for ears.   The kids just love them. can make them with the regular chocolate or the white chocolate.

The base for this recipe is good. The icing sugar fondant that is used to roll around the cherries is very good, but the chocolate chips around the outside make it overly sweet. I would say that using a dark chocolate would be much better than using a milk chocolate. A correctly tempered high quality chocolate makes these candies divine, and they wont melt on you like chocolate chips will. It gives them a hard shell - these are especially good when rolled in some crushed hazlenuts when the chocolate is still wet.

My fondant wasn't sticky, it was simply gooey. I had to add a ton of flour and put it in the fridge to be able to work with it. Then, I found out that heating chocolate on "medium heat" is a bad idea. I ended up melting chocolate disks because I didn't want to waste my time trying again. Personally, I thought they were too sweet. However, both of my parents insist they taste like store-bought chocolate covered cherries, so I suppose that's a good thing.

I don't know why I made these.  I don't even like choco covered cherries.  But a lot of people do, so I made them to give as gifts at Christmas.  I followed the recipe exactly, and I still have a bunch of it sitting in my cupboard four months later.  Oh well.  They looked really nice.

These cherries were just too sweet for me, and my friends, with whom I made the recipe, felt the same way.  If I made them again, I would either use a darker chocolate and/or a different kind of cherry.

What am I doing wrong. My cherries wrapped in the nuget look great, but I can't seem to get them dipped. I can do a few, then the chocolate gets thick. I have my cherries frozen...should I let them thaw first?

I've been using this recipe for a few years now and it is always a hit. One easy step to help your fondant be a little less sticky is to chill it before you use it. I also find that just pinching off a bit and molding it around the cherry is easier than trying to roll it out on a counter. Another reviewer also mentioned using powdered sugar to prevent sticking on the counter. Good idea, flour is not good for these delicious candies! 
  Lastly, I use candy coating and chocolate chips together. A ratio of 2-1 works (candy coating -choc chips) quite well. A quick chill to set the chocolate and then one or two weeks at room temp is perfect. I hide mine in a cake pan with a lid so no one is tempted to snitch before they're ready! Thanks for a great recipe!

I would give this way more stars than five if I could.  I tried one batch with the cherries soaked in rum.  They were a little messier to put together but they got big smiles from the grandpas.

Let them sit for a week or two...yum!  But be sure to do it in the fridge, not the freezer.  The yummy liquid won't happen if you have them in the freezer.

Definitely a crowd pleaser and fun to make.  All of my coworkers beg me to make them for birthdays and celebrations. I made them for my father in law for Christmas one year and now I can't get away with not making them.  The longer you let them sit in the fridge the better the flavor.

I made these several weeks ago and they were just fantastic. I am going to make them again in the next week and give them away as part of the cookie trays that I am making. Alot of work but so, so well worth it! Thank you for another winner!

I have made these for years and have tried many different tips listed below. I even do these with friends every year we do about 350 cherries in one night. The recipe is a guide of course but haven't used it in many years First if you are doing alot get a large jar from Sams.The jar is around 10.00 and there are 150 or so cherries in the jar. I do use some cherries juice in my fondante sometimes and nead my powdered sugar in and then chill.When rolling my cherries I use powdered sugar on my hands and wax paper.I make a small ball and flaten it out in my hand and wrap my cherry.You will have to just wing that one it took me awhile to learn how to do that a few failed attempts is expected.After so many years of doing this I have gotten quite fast at doing it.Chill your cherries after they are rolled. Oh yes only drain a few cherries at a time or you will not get a juicy cherry and the center will not disolve as well. Chill the rolled cherries or put them in the freezer for a few minutes. I don't chill them as long as directed but my cholocate isn't as hot and I do it very quickly and dip them twice at one time if that makes since and put them on wax paper lined cookie sheets to dry.I will say if you can leave them in the fridge for a month they will almost be liquid in the center. These are wonderful gifts if they like chocolate covered cherries they will expect them each year.I use Dark Chocolate chips only Semi is too sweet.Hope this helps

This is the first time I have made chocolates and found the recipe was a bit confusing with the margarine.  Is is melted, room temp, frozen?  The fondant was tasty and easy to work with.  The chocolate did not harden as much as I would have liked due to the shortening.  Next time I will use butter instead of margarine and no shortening with the chocolate.  The product was tasty and is currently in the fridge for aging.

These are sooooo good! I just finished them up about half an hour ago and couldn't resit trying them. Yum! I made half of them with milk chocolate and half with white chocolate for a bit of variety. One thing I learned, when you heat up the chocolate, take it off of the heat or else it'll burn. Haha. I can't wait to give them to my mom who absolutely loves chocolate covered cherries. I'm sure they'll be even better in a week and a half. Thank you so much for this great recipe!

5 Star Flavor!  My chocolate coating process lacked severly last night -not sure if it was the chocolate coating or the fact that I was a little timid about rolling the sugar centers out on flour.  Will definitely make again and use more flour because mine melted away too quick by the chocolate when i was coating them.  Some came out ok, but not what I call presentation getters!  But the flavor is the bomb!  Even with the melted blob appearance, they are still all gone!  A definite FAV worthy recipe in my box!

These are wonderful and very easy to make.  I made one small change.  I used the liquid from the cherries instead of the milk.  My husband loved them. I will never buy the boxed ones again.

These are a little time-consuming to make, but they are very tasty! I made them for a Christmas party and everyone raved about them! They can be made ahead of time, too, which is a big help around holiday time.

I've made these twice with great results both times.  I found that refrigerating the white mixture for a few hours makes it easier to work with,  then freezing the coated cherries before dipping in the chocolate keeps the white mixture from getting gooey in the warm chocolate. Then pop them back in the fridge for awhile and they'll be beautiful!

I have made these for the last few years for my family at Thanksgiving and Christmas. While they can take a bit of work, they are absolutely fantastic and well worth the effort. Last Thanksgiving my uncle even had me put several aside just for him, and he hid them in his bedroom! Getting ready right now to make the batch for Thanksgiving, as the OP is right. It is better to wait a few weeks and let them sit to get the perfect taste and consistency. Awesome recipe!

I found this very easy to deal with and my cherries were quite pretty.  Learned that when using the microwave for heating bakers coating in the 8 oz tubs, start at 10 second intervals or the product will seize and be useless.Cutting down on the wrap is also tricky but gets easier.  Must seal all the way or the "sauce" leaks out.

Need to refrigerate dough.  Too runny to roll.  Or maybe, do not sift the powdered sugar, so it measures heavier. Taste is delicious!

I made these tonight.   Love chocolate covered cherries and they are expensive in candy stores so thought I’d try it.    The fondant was sticky and hard to work with.   Worked better when I chilled it addd a bit more powder sugar and dusted my hands with powdered sugar.   I preferred the cherries without stems.    Easier to roll around in my hand.   Used giardelli choc

These were a hit! Easy to make especially if you can get cherries with the stem on. I will make these again through the year.
