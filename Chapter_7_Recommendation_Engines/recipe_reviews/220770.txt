For us, this is a 5 star recipe, only if the chipotle peppers are reduced.  For us, a whole can would be way too much heat.  I added them to taste until the right flavor was achieved (for us it was about 2-1/2 peppers).  The end result was fabulous!  This was very well received at Easter dinner!  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

This is not your typical topical pineapple sauce, but rather a spicy, sweet, smokey treat.  I didn't seed the chipolte peppers because we like really spicy and I reduced the suger by 1/4, threw it all in the blender, thickened it on the stove, then poured over chicken breasts and baked at 375 for 30 min.  Instant success! YUMMY!

Fabulous recipe! I made this for some guests who are not too adventurous when it comes to heat... so I cut down the amount of chipotle I used and I did de seed the peppers. They LOVED it and even commented that this was the best ham they had ever had!! I will make this again for sure!

Gotta de-seed those peppers! Leave the seeds of 1 or 2 peppers if you like some heat

In fact, we loved this recipe, but it was only because I doctored to heck out of it!  A whole can of chipotle in adobo is TOO HOT!  I only blended in 1 chipotle, and then I only used half the mixture.  I added a substantial amount of ingredients to calm down the half I used. Probably will not make again.
