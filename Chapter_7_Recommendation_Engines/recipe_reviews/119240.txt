I enjoyed this recipe. Quick, easy, flavorful and appealing to the eye. I did substitute Italian flavored bread crumbs instead of the saltines and I doubled the amount of wine. I served it with brown rice and we all enjoyed it very much.

I used a combination of store-bought Italian breadcrumbs and crushed saltines as that's what I had on hand. I also just eyeballed the seasonings. This was quick, easy, and the fish turned out really good. Thanks, Susan!

Made this tonight for supper and my dad said that it tasted very good.  I am sick right now and my taste buds don't work but I trust him!  Thanks for sharing:)

Made exactly as written.  It was good but not great.  It was kind of bland.  I will make this again and experiment with different seasonings to bring this dish up to a five.

Other than using another type of fish I followed the recipe exactly. This dish turns out very flaky, moist and delicious. I served with a side salad and I loved the fact I had a filling meal in 20 minutes time.

This recipe is amazing!!! It's so quick and easy and so tasty and really easy to substitute ingredients for what you have lying around. Great for a last minute, too-tired-to-cook-but-really-want-a-home-cooked-meal kind of day. 

I'd have given it a 5 but I didn't follow the recipe exactly. I didn't have saltine crackers, so I used Japanese bread crumbs, and I added about 1/2 tbs of Italian dressing mix.

I will certainly be using this recipe again and again! Thanks!

Maybe I overcooked this, but hubby and I agreed that it seemed dry and "needed something".  Not bad, I think you just have to experiment with it...

The taste was good but the crackers got soggy not crispy. Might try to use a thinner layer of crackers.

Whole family disliked this dish.  It just wasn't great on the taste buds.  Maybe I did something wrong but I did follow the recipe exactly as printed.Sorry we didn't like it.

I'd give this 3.5 stars. It was good, but a little bland.
