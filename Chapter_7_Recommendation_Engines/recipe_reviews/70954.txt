Marinated shark steaks with olive oil and Emeril's season rub overnight. Difficult to cut into chunks, maybe my knife. Shark took 2 minutes longer to cook but was then tender as prime rib and not fishy. Very flavorful. However the "already cooked" frozen shrimp were a little tough. Served over rice pilaf instead of noodles and didn't use mozzarella. Delicious! Thanks.

We thought this dish was okay, but we felt rice would have been a better choice than the egg noodles. The cheese added no flavor whatsoever, and the recipe could have used some more spices. We also think that you could use almost any type of fish for this dish. We'll spruce it up some the next time and decide whether or not it's a keeper.

I never know what to do with shark since I don't have a grill .  The last time I made it with a lemon pepper marinade in a pan, it was rubbery and fishy, so I was nervous about making shark again.  I thought this recipe was very good, even though I didn't stick to it completely.  I didn't have any shrimp, and I served it over white rice instead of pasta, with sliced avocado on the side.  We loved it!

The noodles and cheese are not a good match with shrimp and shark. I think if you skip the cheese, maybe serve with some rice and add some extra seasonings it MAY be OK, but I'm not willing to put forth the effort in trying this one again.

Surprisingly good!  Goes well with brown rice. I've made this dish several times when shark is on sale.  It is very hard to find simple but tasty shark recipes.

We didn't care for this recipe at all. I felt it had little flavor and might be better if some spices were added to it.

This was wonderful! I had a bunch of friends come over for dinner and they all ate it up wanting more. The only thing I added was some cheddar cheese with the mozzarella and put some garlic powder and seasoning salt in it. I will be making this again. Thanks!

Ugh, maybe there was something wrong with the shark  I bought, but I'm inclined to think it was the recipe.  Reading the recipe I thought that it was just a little too simple, and the combination with egg noodles was just odd to say the least.  Sorry for the person that submitted this recipe, but I would stay far away from this one!

WOW we loved this recipe.  I got some shark on sale at the store and didn't know what to do with it, so I tried this recipe.  It was very very good!  I also used whole wheat pasta for the first time and we liked that.  Our kids heard the word SHARK and decided to go next door for our neighbor's jambalaya...but that was okay with us, we didn't have to share!

I used linguine noodles instead and also cooked the fish in butter instead of oil and added garlic and onions,and added a can of Rotell instead of chopped tomatoes, once its was cooked i mixed it all in with the noodles and added the cheese so it was nice and cheesey. I loved it and so did the kids, mind you my son does not eat fish and loved this dish! will def. make it again!!
