I made one of these today, as it's been a rough morning. This is quite the potent drink, but it's really nummy.

I used Oregon Chai and Absolut Vanilla.

EDITED TO ADD: This is now one of my favorite drinks. It's even better with a little half-n-half to make it creamier.

What a great drink.I used celestial seasonings Indian spiced chai and stuck in fridge to cool. I added skim milk instead of the the other review's suggested heavy cream since i am on a diet. I also wanted it a bit sweeter so I added splenda.  I  sprinkled a dash of nutmeg and cinnamon. I prefer this over the typical chocolate martini. Try it!

I made this following the recipe and wasn't very impressed. Then I added a splash of cream and a little sugar, it was slightly better but not a lot.  There was something I didn't like about the chai flavor and a cold drink. Just couldn't get past it...

It's a nice recipe, you can make it even better by infusing the vodka with chai leaves
