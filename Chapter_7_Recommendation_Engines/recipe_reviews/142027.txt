More like 4 and a half stars.  A tad on the sweet side (should have listened to reviews and cut back on sugar some), but still so so yummy.  Seemed dry when first put together, but it really creams up quickly in the frig - 2 hours is plenty of time for it to set up.  I added two diced radishes, I think next time I will add four, to help the sweet factor and to add some more crunch.  Aftter reading reviews, I added more onion, ground mustard and a tad more salt.  Yummers!  Served with ribs and baked beans.  My boyfriend's take:  "better than Southern cooking and I never had to leave my porch in Arizona."  And he is picky about his slaw.  POSTSCRIPT:  I cut back on the sugar the next time, and it just didn't taste as good.  I tried adding the sugar back in after I had already added the slaw -- didn't really work.

This was great!  I used mayo instead of miracle whip and rice wine vinegar instead of white vinegar, but just barely cut back on the sugar because rice vinegar is slightly sweet. My friends agreed that it was even better than the slaw at the great BBQ place in town. Will definitely make again!

The BEST slaw recipe ever!!  I just finished making it and YUM-O!!!  Can't wait to try it in a few hours.  It taste's just like the coleslaw at the fast food chicken place.  The only change that I made was I substituted celery seed for the poppy seed. I didn't have bagged slaw mix, shredded a head of cabbage and a carrot.  I just wanted to add that I have use allrecipes for a few years and this is the first time I have taken the time to rate a recipe, it's that good!!!

Delicious cole slaw! Creamy and sweet, just the way I like it. I use real mayo, celery seed instead of poppy, a dollop of sour cream instead of the oil, and a little extra salt and pepper. Thanks.

This is very good- almost the my family's long time recipe. One thing I do to make it creamier and less watery- I only put half the dressing on it  to begin with. After an hour, I drain some of the dressing off, and then put the rest on- make a little extra dressing if needed. After you put any vinegar based dressing on cabbage, some of it's water will leach out, making it soupy- this makes it creamier.

This is very much like the slaw we make in our deli and people come from other counties just to get this slaw.  I tried cutting down the ingredients from the huge amount we make at the store and it comes out to very much like this recipe.  Except we don't use any oil in our dressing.  You don't need it.  Just added calories.  We use a good mayonaisse instead of salad dressing and our slaw dressing would come out to 1 cup of mayo, 2/3 cup sugar and 2.5 tablespoons white vinegar.  About 1.5 pounds of shredded cabbage and one shredded carrot.  We don't use onions in our slaw although some probably would like that.  I would probably use a good sweet onion like a Vadalia maybe.  I'm thinking I'd also use celery seed instead of poppy seeds.  We use celery seed in our pickled slaw and it's good!  Letting it sit a while is the key.  That loosens up the dressing.  Just remember to stir it good before serving.

I just made this coleslaw for a big cookout that I am hosting tomorrow and I had to rate this right away! It is delicious! I haven't even chilled it for the 2 hours and it is so good! I can't wait to share it with my friends and family. I followed the recipe exact with the exception of using mayo and no poppy seeds. This is my slaw recipe for now on, thank you!

Being a midwesterner, I've had a lot of different kinds of restaurant and tavern coleslaws with my Friday night perch dinners, but this is the best by far!

This was absolutely delicious, and I'm not even a huge slaw fan!  I used two bags of prepared slaw, and made the dressing as directed.  Plenty of dressing.  Refrigerated overnight, and plenty of sweet, creamy slaw.  Nice recipe, I'll do this one many times.

Great cole slaw dressing. I did use mayo and just a wee bit more vinegar, a little less sugar because we like the tangy taste. It was so easy to do and everyone loved it. This is my go-to slaw dressing.

I'm giving it 5-stars even though I didn't follow the recipe exactly but close enough....In the morning I shredded & chopped 1/2 cabbage (=1 pound) & 1 carrot, upped the onion closer to 3 Tablespoons, very finely diced & let that sit together in the fridge for a coupla hours. Just before noon I followed the dressing recipe (btw, the directions do not specifically say to use Miracle Whip, it's merely a suggestion & I suspect the ones who complain about this being too sweet probably did use Miracle Whip), using mayo, left out the poppy seeds (I never have them in my cupboard nor did we like it when we sub'd celery seed) & added a dash of fresh ground black pepper. After 4 hours in the fridge this was great on it's own but BOMB over slow smoked pulled pork!!! I can't stop thinking about it & I don't even like cole slaw! Can't wait to see how much better it probably tastes today!!!

I found this to be too sweet and too heavy on the dressing- if I make it again I will reduce the sugar by about half and add the liquid to the slaw mix bit by bit until I get the desired amount of wetness- with the full amount of dressing it was just too goopy.

This is the recipe that made me a fan of coleslaw. I had been making coleslaw for my husband for years but never cared for it. From the first time I used this recipe I have nibbled from each and every batch :)

I make the recipe almost as written except that for personal preference I use mayo instead of creamy salad dressing and a packet of Splenda instead of white sugar. 

A couple of tips: combine everything except the coleslaw mix in a large bowl until smooth and blended. Taste and adjust until you like the taste of the dressing. Stir in the coleslaw mix a bit at a time. It will seem dry at first but don't worry - after a couple hours in the fridge (covered) it will be deliciously creamy and you can move it to a smaller container.

Finally, and I can't stress this enough, use the nicest vinegar and oil in your pantry. You will really taste the difference. If it doesn't taste nice on your finger, it will not improve once you've added it to the bowl. I use white balsamic vinegar and a light salad oil or almond oil - the type you would use to make a salad dressing.

This coleslaw is excellent on hamburgers, with BBQ'd anything, on pizza (yes, pizza!) and just by itself. Thanks for posting it, Sandi.

Just finished making a double recipe of slaw for 2 parties today. (gota love being retired in Hawaii!!) Tasted it before the rest in the fridge and I'm here to say this is one "broke da mout" "Ono" slaw! The onions do add a wonderful layer of flavor to this recipe that I wouldn't have thought to try. If you make this for a party, you may as well double it, because it won't last long. What I did for a double recipe: 1) 3# Head of cabbage, 4+TBS) onions, 1 1/3cups) Mayo, 5 TBS) vegetable oil, 2/3cups) sugar, 4TBS) white vinegar, 1/2 tsp) Salt, and 1 tsp) poppy seeds.  I tasted my store bought (Kraft) stand by to compare, and found that this recipe wasn't quite as sweet as what I've been using. I always like the KFC slaw but now, It's this or nothing for this guy! ****UPDATE**** Next time I make this I'm not going to add the wet ingredients to the slaw until just before I leave for a function. As I mentioned above, the flavor was very good when I first added the dressing. After two hours the dressing broke the cabbage down to the point that it was swimming in juice. Didn't look real appetizing at all but still tasted good. I noticed a couple people poke at the juice in the bowl and walk away. Still keeping it at 5 stars though!*****UPDATE 9/12) Made this salad again today. I used less of the sauce on this salad and still there was more than enough to make a great slaw. Next time I'm going to cut the dressing in half. I'm sure it will still be a 5 star recipe with less waste!

Giving this five stars because it is exactly what it says it is... My husband loved this cole slaw and even said "it tastes like the kind from KFC!" I wouldn't eat it (not a big coleslaw person), but it was exactly what I was going for. Thanks!

Excellent coleslaw didn't change a thing except to use light miracle whip!  It went great with beer battered fish and french fries.

Great slaw recipe! The only thing is I use a tad less sugar, but other than that everything stays the same. Goes great with my pulled pork sandwiches. I know coleslaw is pretty simple, but this one definitely does not disappoint.

This is a delicious slaw recipe and one I've been using since 2007.  It gets rave reviews anytime I make it for family or friends.  I have made it both as the original recipe and also with my changes.

  I've found that my family prefers it when I use onion powder instead of the fresh onion added in - but if using fresh onion, the sweet onion that is finely chopped works best for flavor.  

Also I prefer apple cider vinegar instead of white vinegar in the recipe.  For the vegetable oil I use extra virgin olive oil.  Only thing I add that isn't in the recipe is some black pepper. 

This is a great slaw recipe and one that is better than any of the slaw dressings that are available at the store.

This did taste good!  I cut back on the sugar by 1/2, instead of using bagged slaw I used my food processor for the cabbage and carrots.

This was a nice coleslaw with plenty of sweetness.  

I used hellmans instead of miracle whip.  I also used celery seeds instead of poppy seeds and added a sprinkle of seasoning salt and ground mustard.  The variety of flavors is wonderful.

Make sure to let it sit at least two hours.  Overnight is even better!

With the exception of the sweetness, this is very close to the coleslaw I make to duplicate the way my mom made coleslaw when I was a kid.  Her method was to put your sugar in a measuring cup, then pour apple cider vinegar over the sugar until it is saturated.  This, in my opinion, creates the best balance of sweet & sour.  One additional thing I do to get better crunch is to soak your grated cabbage in ice water for about 30-60 minutes, then drain well before mixing in your dressing. I also add grated carrot (as the picture shows) for color.  The creaminess increases as the mixture sits.  A tad of sour cream can be added to adjust the sweetness if needed.

This is my go-to coleslaw recipe. I make it several times a year. It is perfect AS IS. The only time I change the ingredients is when I double the recipe; I only use 3/4 cup sugar, but double the rest of the ingredients. Further, it's simple to make and uses ingredients I always have on hand.

This is similar to our traditional family coleslaw recipe.  We grind our cabbage by using an old fashioned hand grinder (use the fine blade).  With the ground cabbage in a large bowl, we sprinkle about 2 Tablespoons of sugar and 1 Tablespoon of black pepper on top, mix, cover, and let stand for 2 or 3 hours.  WHY?  To draw the water out of the cabbage.  Then we drain the liquid, add a generous amount of regular mayonnaise and blend all ingredients together.  It is a German recipe, with logical processes and simple ingredients.

Really was delicious. It's important to know that when you first mix the ingriedients that it is not very juicy but once you let it sit for the 2 hours you have perfect cole slaw. Give yourself the time needed to let this recipe sit in the fridge. I didn't change a thing about the recipe and wasn't too sweet to me.

absolutely delicious. I use non-fat mayo for the 'creamy salad dressing', and splenda in place of the white sugar for a slightly healthier version. It still comes out amazing!

Best slaw recipe.  I used the amount of sugar in the recipe (other reviews said less sugar made the recipe not as good.)  Another reviewer was correct that it seems quite dry but, after setting for 2+ hours in the refrigerator, it was perfectly creamy.  I used minced onion and left out the poppy seeds.  It was fantastic and was a hit at our party.  They said it was better than any restaurant slaw they had had!  I will keep this recipe.

This was very tasty and easy to prepare.  I cut it down to 2 servings and was just the right amount for my husband & I.  The kids don't care for slaw (their loss!).

I mixed everything together in a bowl at the same time and that worked fine.  I didn't have any poppy seed so used celery seed and that worked well.

I served it with tuna patties and macaroni and cheese.

This is a keeper!

I've made this several times exactly as directed.  Every time I take it to a gathering, someone wants the recipe and I direct them here. Easy to make and delicious. A great recipe for someone who doesn't cook but needs to take a covered dish somewhere.

I omitted the poppy seeds and used pickle juice instead of the vinegar, like my grandmother used to do with her cole slaw.  I also cut the sugar in half and therefore only used 2 TB of vegetable oil.  Yummy!

Wonderful, wonderful!! I think changes are only necessary to each persons different tastes. I didn't want to add oil so I added a bit of sour cream instead. Next time I'll try it without that. I used the olive oil mayo and rice vinegar (it's what I had on hand). I also did 1/3 cup sugar only because I prefer it less sweet. You can't go wrong with with recipe...changes or not. Yum!

This is a fantastic basic recipe.  I am a KFC cole slaw junkie, but even as much as I love the KFC (price notwithstanding), I always felt it was WAY too sweet.  Based on the other reviews, I did the following: used the bagged slaw mix, used mayo rather than Miracle Whip, 2T EVOO, 1/4 cup sugar, upped the vinegar to 2T and replaced the poppy seeds with an equal amount of celery seeds (1/2 t).  OMG... this has only been in the fridge for 2 hours and I just tasted it... INCREDIBLE.  SO much better than the KFC.  This is the recipe I've been looking for.  My German auntie Em was known for her cole slaw, and it's an exact duplicate of hers.  This will go into my regular rotation, and I can't WAIT to put this on my newfound pulled pork recipe. I am SO in awe of having found this recipe.  Next time I will double the recipe... the cabbage shrinks a bunch as it marinates. Thankyou Sandi! P.S.  Make sure you really well whisk the dressing... that sugar can lurk into the corners of your container.  Final thought...

This is very good. I can see why it got so many 5-star reviews. I didn't think it was too sweet, but then I love sweet dishes. It was the perfect way to use up some cabbage from the garden. The only change I made was to use green onion instead of regular onion.

Perfect dish for this hot weather! I followed the recipe with a couple exceptions. I used less sugar, about 1/3 of a cup or less. It was plenty sweet for us. I also used celery salt in place of the poppy seeds (I never have poppy seeds). Thanks for the recipe.

I'll never buy cole slaw again - AWESOME!!  Slight changes based on others' suggestions: used light mayo in place of "Miracle Whip," and celery seeds in place of poppy seeds.  Sets up very nicely when chilling and the taste and consistency are even better the next day!

Loved it - wasn't too sweet after it chilled.  I originally didn't think it was dressed enough - but it was completely creamy once it chilled (almost too much dressing).  May cut the portions back next time - but the flavor profile was just right!

Tastes exactly like the title! We loved this. I substitued celery seeds for the poppy seeds, and instead of Miracle Whip, used the mayo that I had on hand (Duke's, the only mayo to eat, IMHO! ;), and it was simply yummy. We used it to smother some chili dogs, and man oh man, I'm getting hungry just thinking about it! Nice job, Sandi! A classic recipe to keep around.

U-N-B-E-L-I-E-V-A-B-L-E! With a passion for cooking and the nickname "country chef" by friends, there aren't many recipes or dishes that I can't perfect. Cole slaw is one of the few I struggle with. I've watched my mother-in-law and grandmother make delicious coleslaw countless times and tried so many different recipes. I'm not the measuring type and I have been stumped many times. I could never get it just right. 
Now this is my recipe of choice and everone loves it and many ask for the recipe. It is so delicious and easy.
So good I would give it more stars if I could. The only changes I made were: 1)use celery seed instead of poppy seeds and 2)cut the sugar in half.

I just mixed this up and I can hardly wait until it has time to sit and get better. When I tasted it I wanted to just keep eating! I added some pepper just because but otherwise followed the recipe. I know I will be making this again and again this summer. Thanks for a great recipe, Sandi.

I didn't have coleslaw mix, so I initially passed this recipe and looked for others, but of all the ones I looked through this one had the best reviews and best looking ingredient list. I was worried about the amount of cabbage for the ratio of dressing but a medium sized cabbage and a few grated carrots worked out perfectly. I didn't change anything and the flavor was great. It's not often that you read so many reviews that say the recipe is perfect "as-is". 

It was also helpful to hear from another reviewer that the dressing builds up after it sits for a few hours, that was something that was an initial concern, but everything worked out perfectly. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

I love this dressing! I used one pre-packaged bag of coleslaw mix. I did make minor adjustments to the ingredients. I used sour cream instead of veg oil, 2 T rice wine vinegar ( it's all I had on hand) and also I cut back on the white suagr to 1/4 cup. I like sweet but not too sweet.  I marinated for about 4 hours. The results were amazing. I used celery seeds instead of poppy seeds and found that this added nice texture to the coleslaw. The marinade was sweet but too sweet and with nice flavor. With adjustments that I made, this turned out to be a tasty coleslaw!

This is the best coleslaw recipe I've ever tried. It definitely tastes just like restaurant coleslaw. It creams together really nicely when refrigerated over night. Will definitely make again. Thanks!

Made this for a card night with the cousins followed some of the other suggestions of using celery seed instead of poppy and it was really good. Instead of diced onion I grated mine which made the onion disappear into the salad perfectly. They have already asked for a repeat!

Great cole slaw base!  Quick, easy, yummy, and adaptable:  What's not to like?  I heeded advice from other reviewers and cut the sugar in half (actually, I used Splenda -- can't tell the diff).  I also replaced the oil with water to thin it out without adding more fat.  The flavors are great; I'd never put onion in slaw before, but it's quite nice.  In my opinion, white vinegar, apple cider vinegar, and rice wine vinegar are all lovely with this recipe.  Give them a try.

Excellent!  I used 1 1/2 bags of slaw mix.  Made it the day of the party.  The next day the left overs were watery.  Would not make the night before.

YUM YUM YUMMY!!! The best coleslaw recipe I have found :-) I made the following changes as suggested by other users: 1. Add 2 tbsp. apple cider vinegar instead of the 1 tbsp. of white vinegar 2. Only used 1/4 of a cup of sugar and it was plenty sweet 3. Subtract the vegetable oil (delicious without it it would be real oily if you add it) 4. Instead of the bagged stuff I used 1 small head of green cabbage and a little less than 1/2 of red cabbage with 1 large shredded carrot still cheaper than the pre-cut stuff 5. Subtract the poppy seeds - I don't have them on hand - Add heaping 1/4 tsp. of celery seeds. 6. Add a dash of pepper 7. Instead of letting it all marinate I found it to be fresher and more delicious by waiting to add the dressing until right before serving. It's just a really great fresh taste and this is a great base recipe to get ideas then to make your own changes for your own prefrence. But I will SOOOOOOOOO make this recipe again and can't wait for an excuse to make it again. 5 big delicious stars!

Great recipe! I did do 1/3C sugar, and 2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar and don't add the oil - LOVED it!!! 
It may seem dry to start, but if you let it rest in the fridge for a bit, it becomes very saucy.

Really the best cole slaw recipe I've found. I cut the sugar back to 1/3 c, increase the vinegar to 3 tbsp, use mayo instead of miracle whip, and use garlic salt instead of salt. This really is as close as I've been able to come to restaurant slaw.

I really wanted to make this a little healthier, if I could. I used broccoli slaw and added about 3/4 c. of shredded carrots. I used half mayo, half fat free PLAIN yogurt and cut the sugar to two tablespoons. The recipe didn't specify what kind of onion, so I used green onions. We all enjoyed this. I think I might add more green onion next time. The longer this sets, the better it is. I plan on serving the leftovers on ham sandwiches for the fam tomorrow, mine will be in a bowl with chopped ham, sans bread.

This is my new go-to coleslaw recipe.  
My husband LOVES it with the Amazing Ribs recipe from this site.  If you like super-sweet slaw, this is the recipe! (I also found reducing sugar to 1/3 cup is plenty sweet!)

I have tried many cole slaw recipes at allrecipes.com.  Most are good, but this is one of the better ones.  If more restaurants served cole slaw this good, they may be able to market it as a main dish.  It's quite sweet, but very delicious.

This was great.  Really enjoyed the flavors and it is now my standard slaw recipe, make sure you wait the two hours.  The sugar needs time to disolve in the liquid.  Great taste just need to prepare ahead.

Great recipe! I have used with the full amount of sugar and it was good, can cut back a little and it still turns out great. I do not care for onions so I leave those out and I usually do not have poppy seeds on hand... Friends Love it!!
Thank you for a tasty recipe!

Easy to make with convenient, packaged coleslaw, in this version the creamy dressing with vinegar, sugar and vegetable oil is close to what's served at popular fried chicken, burger and fish restaurants.

Finally found a coleslaw recipe that I like!  I cut the sugar back just a little to 1/3 cup, used real mayonnaise because that's all I buy, and subbed celery seed because I didn't have poppy seeds.  Excellent!

Great coleslaw recipe. Reminiscent of St-Hubert's creamy coleslaw, but a little sweeter.

Keep in mind that the coleslaw will appear alarmingly dry when mixing in the sauce with the slaw.  But after sitting in the fridge for a few hours, the sauce thickened up quite nicely.  

Only alterations I made were to add some pepper to taste and a tsp of mustard.

GREAT.....  I must say that I substituted 1/2 C. sugar for 1/3 Blue Agave, poppy seed for celery seed(a personal fav.) and sprinkled curry powder lightly over the top....  This is over the top.... oh yes, I used green onions sliced for the diced onion.  I kept with the spirit of recipe and added my personal style to it.  Thanks for the recipe.

Loved this! I cut down on the sugar by almost half because I was serving it to a diabetic. I elimated the poppy seeds because another of my guests has diverticulitis. I used Helman's mayo because that is what i had on hand. I used onion powder instead of raw onion. The only white vinegar I had on hand was rice wine vinegar and it worked great. I let it marinate overnight. It tasts like the KFC slaw we like only better and fresher!

It was very good but too sweet, so next time I made it I used the base idea and got a little creative.  I added a bag of shredded red cabbage along with the bag of cole slaw, 2 heaping TBS dried minced onion, mayo, 1/4 cup Splenda, 2 TBS cider vinegar, 1/4 tsp celery seed and a sprinkling of caraway seed.  This was more to our taste. Loved it and will make it again "my way".  Thanks Sandi for a nice base recipe

I made this slaw for Memorial Day, which accompanied pulled pork! Absolutely delicious! I waited to hear my family's comments...everyone love it! I used celery seed instead of poppy, less sugar, and half the amount of oil. I let is sit for about 4-5 hours. This is a keeper!

The best coleslaw I've had.  I made it for the second time last night to go with some meats that I was smoking.  We had family over, and one of my guests thought I had driven to the town over to buy coleslaw from the broasted chicken place there, but then he took a bite and realized that this was SOOO much better!
My only changes were that I used mayo, rice wine vinegar, and cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup.
This is going to be a staple at my house, I'm sure of it.

This tasted very similar to restaurant coleslaw and is very good! I used real mayo and I didn't add nearly as much sugar as called for and it came out plenty sweet. Also, there is no need for the vegetable oil, I didn't use it and it came out perfect! Although I didn't use any seeds this time, I recommend celery seeds instead of poppy seeds.

Very good! I omitted oil, added about 2 Tbsp sour cream, used rice vinegar and added a little bit of lemon juice and a little ground mustard, reduced sugar to 1/3 cup and added some sunflower seeds - it was a hit!

This is so good!  I used light mayonaise, Splenda, and apple vinegar. I omitted the salt and poppy seeds (didn't have poppy seeds). It worked well with fish. This is the first time I've made coleslaw "from scratch," and I will definitely make it again.

This is great as is, but sweet. I use 1/3 cup Miracle whip + 1/3 cup Mayo, only 2 T. vegetable oil and only 1/3 c. sugar. We serve it on buttered grilled buns with the Slow Cooker Texas Pulled Pork recipe from this site. DIVINE COMBO!!! Sometimes I'll add an additional 1/2 bag (6 oz.) of Broccoli Slaw, and there's plenty of dressing to coat.

yum! my friend made this (with regular mayo) and it was sooo good. She doesn't like slaw but was making bbq so decided to try it. She still didn't like it but everyone else did!  So tasty - my 2 yo daughter loved it too. Can't wait to make it for my family.

I like to follow the recipe exactly the first time I make a dish.  This was just too sweet for us.  We like to put coleslaw on our fried fish sandwiches and the sweet overpowered the fish a bit.  Think I will stick with my Creamy Spiced Coleslaw on this site.

This is my third or fourth time using this recipe and I love it! However this is my very 1st time making this slaw since going egg free and it was still delicious even with substitutions. Instead of salad dressing or mayo I used Veganaise (basically vegan mayo), 1/4 cup  fine granulated organic sugar instead of white, and last but not least I didn't have any vegetable oil so I used olive oil instead. I know, I know you can't switch up ingredients and leave a review but I've made this recipe following it to a T as well and was actually compelled to join allrecipes just to comment because it still tasted delicious EVEN with my substitutions. Lol. Yeah, I know most people would think you can't mess up coleslaw but I've been to enough cookouts to know that you CAN. Lol. Make this recipe with or without minor substitutions it will most likely still be delish! Thanks for the recipe Sandy!

This slaw is fantastic! The only thing that I changed was using apple cider vinegar instead of white...thats all tat I had! Others said that it is a tad bit on the sweet side...well it is at first, but if you let it sit for a good 3 hours in the fridge, the flavors come together and it is FABULOUS!  Crunchy, sweet, just great paired with a slow cooker pulled pork sandwich and beans:) Thank you for the great recipe!

First time EVER, making Cole Slaw.  I LOVE this recipe.  I used Miracle Whip, and didn't have any white vinegar on hand, used apple cider vinegar.   Didn't add poppy seeds.  Thank you, will add this to my cookbook.

My family loved this!  I didn't have poppy or celery seeds so I omitted that completely.  I added about 1 1/2 teaspoons dijion mustard to it, & reduced the sugar to slightly less than 1/3 cup of sugar.  Great flavor - will make again.

If you like KFC or Long John Silver's cole slaw - then make this recipe!  I followed the it as written except I used Hellmann's Mayo and I didn't have poppyseed so I sprinkled some fresh ground pepper and mixed it in.  My guests asked for seconds!  Will definately make again!!

Super good slaw recipe. If you read the recipe carefully, you can see that by adding Miracle Whip AND sugar that this will be super sweet. I like a sweet coleslaw but opted to use Best Foods mayo rather than Miracle Whip. It was still very sweet. Also left out the poppy seeds. I doubled the recipe and shredded a whole head of cabbage plus carrots. My entire family (including kids) loved this. I like to leave mine in the refrigerator over night rather than just a couple of hours. It absolutely needs to sit for AT LEAST a couple of hours. It really does taste just like KFC's coleslaw and it's quite tasty. This is my new recipe for coleslaw - goes great on top of pulled pork or corned beef sandwiches!

What a find! My tried and true coleslaw recipe to this point was one I got years ago from a friend, and it has a vinaigrette dressing. This was easy to make, tasty and a great change. I reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup and used celery seed for the poppy seed as was suggested by other reviewers. Thanks for the recipe, Sandi.

I made this recipe because of the rave reviews. I've just eaten it and it's overpoweringly sweet. I can only think that maybe restaurant coleslaws over here are not as sweet as in American restaurants. I did expect a sweet coleslaw, but just not one as sweet as this. I tried the dressing before I mixed it in with the salad and it was so sweet it I would almost have been able to use it as a dessert sauce. I decided to add half the quantity of all the other ingredients again to try and temper the sugar and used that, but it was still too sweet for both my partner and me. I will try the recipe again and use much less sugar as so many other reviewers have done, then I am sure, it will be a five star for me as I did like the consistency of the dressing very much. I am so very sorry though, because as the recipe stands, it was not for us at all.

This was SOOOO DELICIOUS! I was making it for a large gathering so I used 3 bags of coleslaw and only doubled the sauce....there was plenty. Also after making it a few times, I highly recommend using mayo over miracle whip (way too sweet w whip), and celery seeds over the poppy. Everything else is just to your taste. I used half the oil called for and used olive oil, an extra splash of vinegar, and fresh cracked pepper. Absolutley amazing...my mother-in-law said it was the best she had ever had!

I've been making this recipe for a couple of years. It is perfect as is, but as a diabetic I have often substitute about a 1/4 cup Splenda for the 1/2 cup sugar. This is often requested at family gatherings. 

Also, since cabbage tends to wilt over night, I've used the pre-shredded broccoli slaw and it's wonderful!!

I had half a head of cabbage in the fridge that I wanted to use up, so I decided to make this slaw. To the shredded cabbage, I added 2 big handfuls of shredded carrot (I had a bag of pre-shredded in the fridge). I also upped the onion to 4 tablespoons. I made the dressing exactly as directed, except I subbed celery seeds for the poppy seeds, and added plenty of freshly cracked black pepper. It is absolutely delicious, and definitely as good, if not better, than what you would get in a restaurant! Sweet, crunchy, and creamy....YUM!! :)

The "Colonel" always used Heinz Tarragon vinegar for his coleslaw.  Celery seed should be used in coleslaw, although he never used any type of seeds in his recipe. He did use Miracle Whip, though.

Made this for a group potluck as it had such favorable reviews, but doubt I'd make it again without adjusting the sugar amount. The main feedback we recieved from friends, was the slaw tasted too sweet.

The onion definitely stood out in this slaw but it was good. I made it early in the day & it was plenty juicy by dinner. In fact, I think you could cut down on the dressing a bit, save a few calories & it would be just as good.

Great recipe! Reliable good taste.  As other reviewers suggested, I reduced the sugar to just under 1/3 cup, which is still slightly too sweet. This might have something to do with using Miracle Whip instead of mayo. Miracle Whip is definitely sweeter than mayonnaise. I also substituted celery seeds for poppy seeds due to allergies and because I like the taste of the celery seeds.  As a twist, I have also added about a tablespoon of horseradish for some zing. I have also used white wine vinegar instead of plain white vinegar for a slightly different taste. For another different taste,  I added shredded lettuce and blue cheese crumbles just before serving. Yummy if you like blue cheese. Great slaw.

I made this cole slaw for my fiance who is very picky about his "slaw".  I've watched him try many different types of cole slaw in varying restaurants, etc. only to see his disappointment.  He loved this cole slaw and now I'll be making this over and over!  No restaurant recipe will ever match this one in his opinion...I liked it too!  The only changes I made (per other reviewers), I used 1/2 rice wine vinegar and 1/2 white vinegar,  reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup, and added 1/4 tsp. of celery seed for additional flavor.

Delicious!  Can't say much more than has already been said.  Fabulous by itself or piled onto a sandwich or hot dog.  This is a definite keeper for us.  Easy, inexpensive, and just plain good stuff.

Great coleslaw in a hurry! I made it per the recipe the first time, found it a little sweet but otherwise very good. Next time I reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup, used white wine vinegar and low fat mayo. This is a good recipe that is quick and tasty. It appears dry when mixed but after a couple of hours in the fridge is just right. Thanks for posting it Sandi.

Most excellent; love this coleslaw! I added half an 8 oz bag of red cabbage, chopped a bit, plus four radishes, diced.  I've made this twice and find that it only needs 1/2 cup of mayo and 1/3 cup sugar for my tastes. I subbed 2 tbsp of rice vinegar for white.  Plenty of dressing for me. No onions or poppy seeds; might try that some day, but for now I am very happy with this method.  I did add fresh ground black pepper pepper at all stages, including the dressing. Will certainly make this again!  Thank you!

I went with this because with all of the great reviews, how could it NOT be a crowd-pleaser? I know I'm the odd-ball, but this had a disgusting amount of mayo and sugar. How about a little less of both, and a bit more vinegar to suit middle-of-the-road taste buds? I had to start over from scratch with a new recipe, though.

I made this recipe this past weekend.  I followed another suggestion and used Hellman's May instead of Miracle Whip and I omitted the poppy seeds,  I also cut the amount of sugar down by half.  We had very little left!  It was a hit!

Five stars because it is so simple to make!  I made a few modifications.  I cut the sugar to 1/3 cup, 1/2 is too sweet if you plan to use miracle whip.  I cut the salt to 1/8 tsp due to my sodium intake restrictions.  I did not add the poppy seed because I didn't have any.  Next time, I will try using mayo instead of miracle whip.  I also thought about adding crushed pineapple!  Yum!

I agree with the other reviewers, cut back some sugar. I used equal parts of cracked pepper mayo and miracle whip and wow it's amazing. I have made it with regular mayo before but for some reason the cracked pepper mayo makes it so much better!

Awesome cole slaw! I used mayo, I cut the sugar down to 1/3 cup, the oil down to 1T, added a little extra vinegar (I like a little more balance between sweet & tangy) and some black pepper.  Perfection!  I will never look for another slaw recipe.  Thanx!!!

Made this with the recipe called "Slow Cooker Pulled Pork" and put it on top of the pulled pork sandwiches. PERFECTO! The only thing was that I had a lot of extra sauce, so maybe I'll use more cabbage next time.

This has been the best coleslaw and a favorite at our house. I made this last summer when I was feeding 100 people. I even had people who don't like coleslaw say they liked it. I like it with Best Foods Mayonnaise. I used an off brand once and bad mistake. I don't think I would like it with Miricle Whip. Even my family who are Miracle Whip fans say it's best with Mayo. I don't use the bag of coleslaw mix. I use a small or half a large head of cabbage shredded very fine and chopped and 1 carrot grated. Make sure you give it time to blend flavors. People say they like it because it's not too heavy with sauce. It's a nice mix.

Great salad!  This is my first time making coleslaw and it was a hit!  I decreased the amount of sugar (I added a few Tbsp).  There was a little left over and someone wanted to take it home!!  I served this with slow cooker pulled pork.

Made with fresh red cabbage which dyed the sauce pink, half a green apple and a carrot...  But I made it with a bit less sugar and a bit less mayonnaise and it was plenty moist!  There's so much water that's released from the fresh cabbage(not packaged) that it adds to the sauce and the extra calories weren't needed!  Kids had 2 helpings too!!

Super tasty! Next time I might throw a little horseradish into the mix and see what that might add.

Fantastic!  And I don't even like coleslaw!  I used real mayo and used onion powder.  It's even better with a clove or two of fresh minced garlic!  Yum!

I've made my own version of slaw that I thought was good.  This hands down has it beat.  I'm taking to a pot luck at work.  Did change the poppy seeds to celery seed as that is what I had on hand.  Bought diced slaw mix just like the restaurant chain has.  Will be my new slaw dressing, and am going to try on potato salad this summer.

Awesome! The best coleslaw Ive ever tasted. I did change it a little to my own taste. I added some fresh radishes, used red wine vinegar instead of white, half real mayo and half sour cream, half of the recommended sugar, and added some mustard. Will use again. Thank you......

This is so good, does taste like the take out chicken place slaw.  Only suggestion is to chop the cabbage et al more finely in the food processor. Will make again and again.

I would have given 5 stars as well, based on other submitters recommendations. I used 1/3 cup of sugar. I thought I flubbed the recipe but give it time to relax in the refrigerator. Folks that tasted it said it was superior to KFC. This was my first attempt at making slaw and I will use this from now on.

You need not look any further for the perfect cole-slaw recipe.  This has the perfect tangy/sweet balance.  I have made this sooo many times and have found it to best the BEST with ANGEL HAIR slaw (extremely thin sliced).
Thanks!

We did not use the bag salad but shreded our own cabbage and carrots and left out the onions.  Added 1 tbsp of vinegar to make this mare tart.

This was very tasty!  So much better than all the bottled dressings I've tried and very easy to mix up!  I did have to cut back on the sugar, though.  A half cup seemed like too much so I only used 1/4 cup and it was plenty sweet.  Also this makes a lot of dressing!  For our family's taste it was too much dressing for just one bag of coleslaw so next time I will either half the dressing recipe or use two bags of coleslaw.

STOP! YOU HAVE FINALLY FOUND THE PERFECT SLAW. SEARCH NO MORE PEOPLE!

I have tried every recipe I could find, in search of the perfect slaw. Once I tried this one, with little hope while making it, I couldn't stop eating it at dinner! I will never EVER use another recipe. This beats every store made and homemade recipe I've ever tasted. Do not change a thing! Do not fall short with the sugar because it sounds like a lot... you will regret it!

My family and friends can't thank you enough for sharing this recipe. It will be passed down for generations.

leave out the oil -- just don't need it.  Can use (reduced fat) regular mayo, instead of the Miracle Whip. (NOTE to SELF:  dice the onion REALLY fine!)

I just made this to go with tonight's dinner of Irish Tacos off this site. For some reason I was thinking this recipe called for 1 pound (wowie!) of coleslaw, and we had a 14 ounce bag, so I pretty much halved everything except the mayo and added WAY more onion (A whole medium one) I'm glad I thought that, because with the 1/4 cup sugar, it was pretty sweet. I couldn't imagine it with 1/2 cup! I used rice wine vinegar instead, and olive oil. Tastes pretty good, and I can't wait to have it on my corned beef tavos tonight!

My husband went on and on and on about this coleslaw. I've NEVER made a good coleslaw. I too used celery seed just because I had it on hand.  This was a great topping for my pulled pork sandwiches!

My family loved this!  I used 1/3 cup white sugar because I use Miracle Whip and it has a sweeter taste (to me, at least) than mayonnaise.  It was perfect.  I mixed the dressing ingredients up the day before and put the onion in with the dressing.  The next morning I poured the dressing on the cabbage, covered the bowl, and put it in the refrigerator.  I stirred once or twice before dinner.  Couldn't be easier or more tasty!

I take replace the oil with milk or 1/2 & 1/2 adding more than the 3 Tbl. & add just a teensy bit of yellow mustard. Dressing is lighter & tastes better, I think.

A little too sweet. (I guess hence the name 'sweet restaurant slaw'!)  May try cutting the sugar in half next time.

I love this recipe, I have been looking for something that taste like KFC. I used mayo the first  time but will use Miracle Whip next time.  i also used white wine vinegar and the suggested amount of sugar. I put the slaw mix in my blender to make it smaller.
Very good.  This recipe is now in my cook book.  thanks.

After all the great reviews on this coleslaw I decided to give it a try tonight.  Needless to say, I wasn't disappointed.  I made it exactly as written with the exception of using mayonaise instead of Miracle Whip (didn't have any) and celery and poppy seeds.   It was spectacular!   I will definitely be making this again.

As written, it's just a tiny bit too sweet for my family, but with the addition of another 1/4 tsp. salt it was perfect; DH raved about it. So, b/c salt is a personal preference, this gets 5 stars, because this is SO easy and VERY VERY close to KFC, his favorite slaw.

The flavor is way too sweet for me.  Since I am diabebic I have to cut back on sugar.  Use Splenda instead of regular sugar.  I also use light Miracle Whip, use celery seed instead of poppy seed.  Did not put vegetable oil in it, if it wasn't for it to be sweet it would be very good cole slaw.

I was really excited with this recipe as I grew up using Miracle Whip, however, I was quite disappointed. I would suggest cutting down the sugar by at least half, an be mindful of how much of the dressing to add to the coleslaw veggies. I only needed about half of the dressing mixture to fully saturate the vegetables from a 13oz pkg.

This is delicious!  We used it with shredded buffalo chicken sandwiches and it was perfect!  I used only 1/3c sugar and will use 1/4c next time - it was slightly too sweet, but overall, wonderful!

This was perfect! My husband originally wanted to buy coleslaw at the Safeway deli because I had never made coleslaw before and we were having guests over.  After I made it, he told me it was the best coleslaw he had ever had!

Added 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and used fresh cabbage only! I followed everything the same, except I added celery seed instead of poppy seed, no carrots, etc and some fresh ground pepper. So delicious and sweet.

Overall, this slaw is good. It is sweet, even after following the advice of the other reviewers, and reducing the sugar (I doubled the recipe, and used 2/3 of a cup of sugar, instead of the 1 1/3 cups the recipe called for).I doctored the recipe with extra vinegar, to counter the sweetness. I also reduced the oil by 1 tablespoon, eliminated the dill seed and used regular mayo. I added some black pepper as well. So far, it tastes pretty good. The onion definitely gives it a nice flavor, Next time, I'll try adding the dill seed.

Definitely WAY better than the recipe on the bag of coleslaw mix.  I made a few changes: used mayo instead of Miracle Whip, subbed olive oil for vegetable oil and apple cider vinegar for the white vinegar.  I also increased the vinegar to 3 Tbsp and used a scant 1/2 cup of white sugar.

Outstanding recipe. Everyone loved it at our bbq. Used 2 bags of shredded slaw and kept the original measurements for the dressing (made this the day before serving it). I can't imagine if I had doubled the dressing! Yikes! That would have been way too much. I think I could have used 3 bags of cabbage shreds and it still would have melded greatly overnight.

Great slaw, I ended up with a really saucy slaw; next time I'll probably half the sauce or use more slaw/shredded carrots.

Perfect cole slaw!  It was sweet, just like I like it.  Also, people I had over for dinner loved it- one even said that he had originally only taken some to be polite (he doesn't like coleslaw), but he ended up really liking it. The only change I made was to omit poppy seeds since I didn't have any on hand.

Excellent slaw.  I've made it twice so far.  I reduced the sugar the first time and left out the sugar the second time.  Also, I used a packaged broccoli slaw both times. I will be making this again and again.  Thank you for sharing.

I took other individuals' suggestions and cut down on the sugar just a little bit and am glad I did. The only misleading part of this recipe is that the ratio of dressing to salad is out of control. I ended up using almost an entire head of cabbage to make up for how much dressing there was. That being said, the flavors are awesome! I'm excited to let it sit in the fridge overnight and get even more delicious.

This is a great basic slaw recipe!  I didn't have Miracle Whip, so I used mayo.  I had to add a little more vinegar to suit my tastes.

I never ever liked coleslaw before. Then one day I got brave and tried KFC's slaw and I wondered why I never ate it when I was a child when Mom would do our KFC nights. We just had a recent BBQ and I found this recipe to make. It tastes EXACTLY like the good ol' Colonel Sander's recipe :) It was a HUGE SUCCESS at the get together. I made it again just a few moments ago and I used light mayo and only 1/4 cup of sugar so I don't feel so guilty. Gotta watch the girly figure ya know! It tastes just as good! Next time I am going to try it with 1/2 light mayo and 1/2 fat free sour cream. Needless to say, this recipe ROCKS!

This is the BEST coleslaw recipe that I have ever come across!  It tastes just like that famous chicken places coleslaw.  I made it with less sugar and used celery seed instead of poppy seeds.  I ate the whole bowl in one sitting!  I plan on making more today.  Thank you Sandi for this recipe!

I thought this was the best slaw ever. I used my own cabbage I picked, and then shredded carrot for the coleslaw mix. I didn't put as much sugar in it as the recipe called for, because of the recommendations listed, and it was creamy but not sugary. Great stuff!

Simply delish! I have to omit the poppy seeds for health reasons and I use mayo in place of the salad dressing.  I will be making this again for sure!

Awesome 'slaw!
This was my first time attempting to make coleslaw and it came out great.  It was good the night I made it and even better the next day.
I ran out of onions so I used onion powder instead, mayo instead of miracle whip, olive oil instead of vegetable oil, triple the vinegar, 1/3 c sugar and omitted poppy seeds.
My ten year old who hates coleslaw ate two helpings - definitely a keeper!  Thank you!

Love this recipe, but I did make some changes: used Miracle Whip Light, used only 1 Tablespoon of olive oil, reduced sugar to 1/4 C, used apple cider vinegar vs plain white, and used 1/4 tsp EACH of poppy & celery seeds.  This recipe tastes very much like the expensive Marie's Cole Slaw dressing that I buy.  Thank you Sandi!

This was outstanding. I cut way back on the sugar (about 1/4 cup), used regular mayo, celery seed in place of the poppy seeds, rice wine vinegar instead of the regular white vinegar, and added grated carrot (personal preferences). This is definitely a keeper -- very good!

This is pretty good and the best I've ever had and I don't care for cole slaw. I used part sour cream along with the miracle whip, extra virgin olive oil, rice wine vinegar and omitted the poppy seeds. The only thing I hate is how runny cole slaw gets and I guess thats normal? I would sit if you want this, but serve it after preparing if you don't want it runny for more of a crunch. I made it for BBQ chicken sandwiches which is why I think it'd be better this way for a less soggy sandwich.

This was amazing! Used info from other reviews. I used mayo, and cut the sugar back to about 1/4 cup. I used to stop at that "chicken place" to pick up some cole slaw for dinner, now I make this and it is actually better than theirs!! Leftovers on day 2 were still good.  Great recipe I have shared w/ others.

I only gave this 3 stars because of all the changes I made to the original recipe. I definitely suggest using this recipe as a base, and making changes to your own taste. The first time I made it I followed the recipe exactly, but it's way too sweet if you use the amount of sugar as written.  So...using other reviewer suggestions...here's how I made it the second time and it came out really good!  I cut the sugar in half, doubled the amount of vinegar (because it tasted too much like Miracle Whip the first time) and substituted celery seed for the poppy seed.  I also chopped a head of cabbage and bought matchstick carrots and chopped those too (if you have the time it's better than bagged).  I also added salt and pepper to taste at the end.  Very tasty!

Very good recipe.  I did decrease the sugar to about 1/4 cup, and it was sweet enough for me.  Letting it sit for a few hours does result in a creamier consistency.  It will seem a bit dry when you first combine the ingredients, but it will turn out just fine in the end.

Made this last night to serve today, July 4th, and it was a big hit.  I followed the recipe to a T, but did add about a teaspoon of celery seed.  This is my go-to recipe for slaw.  One interesting note....did anyone realize bags of shredded cabbage is 14oz, not 16oz?  Like so many other things, pay more for less!  :-)

Great slaw! After I added 1/4 cup of sugar, I tasted it, and didn't add any more. I thought that was plenty sweet. I thought the Miracle Whip taste was too strong, so I cut it with some mayonnaise and buttermilk.  Substituted the white vinegar for red wine vinegar.  Substituted the poppy seeds for celery seed. Used olive oil. Awesome, awesome!

This slaw was very good!!  It reminds me of the coleslaw from popular restaurants.  This is the first slaw recipe I've tried and I'm very impressed.  I read the other reviews and cut the amount of sugar in half and it was just the right amount of sweetness (for my liking). I also added more onion (used a large onion) because my family and I love them.  I think it tasted even better as leftovers the next day!  I will use this recipe again!

I've been making this recipe for over a year.  It always gets rave reviews, expecially from people who think they don't like coleslaw.  We call it "coleslaw for people who don't like coleslaw".  I make it exactly as the recipe states, although sometimes I use the Splenda Sugar Blend in place of the sugar.  It tastes the same either way.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This is an easy and excellent recipe - it tastes exactly like the sweet kind you get at the chicken place. I think I will cut back on the vegetable oil though as I found it made the consistency a little too oily for my liking. I think i'll half the amount of oil and try it this way.

This was pretty darn good.  Close to KFC's, but I think I like theirs a little better.  This was VERY sweet.  When I make it again I will cut the sugar down to a 1/4 cup and up the vinegar to 2 Tablespoons.  I also would leave the poppy seeds out next time.  They don't add a thing to the recipe. **Update.  I remade this last night cutting the sugar and adding an extra T of vinegar and omitting the poppy seads and it was great.**

According to my hubby, this was "da bomb"!  Said it was the best slaw he's ever ate.  Almost identical to mine, but the addition of the vinegar really changes it so everything melds together perfectly.

Wow...says it all. Amazing. Used it with North Carolina-Style Pulled Pork recipe found on this site. Wow..amazing. I tripled the recipe and the slight bit left over was a bit watery the next day so I just added another half bag of slaw mix. A superbowl hit!

This slaw was absolutely wonderful. I made it exactly how it was written except I had to shred a head of cabbage and some fresh carrot for the slaw mix so I wasn't sure when I had 16 ounces. It turned out really good. Thanks for sharing, will make again. Gail

Fabulous this will be my go to recipe for slaw as I have tried many the one thing I would change is halve the sugar please and sub celery seeds for poppy seeds, my hubby said it's even better than store bought the first time I made it I used recipe as is, he said cut down the sugar and I agreed, now the sugar is at half it's perfect.

We really liked this recipe. Made it with the pre-made cole slaw mix from Walmart. Made it as directed. A little sweet in our option( we haven't been eating much sweet stuff lately). We will reduce the amount of sugar next time!

I really liked this recipe.  One thing that I would change is the amount of sugar.  I like EVERYTHING sweet, but this was way too much sugar even for me.  I started with a 1/3 cup and didn't even add all of it.  I probably ended up adding about a 1/4 cup.  Definitely add gradually and taste test as you go to fit your personal taste!  Otherwise, I really liked this recipe.  Like I said, I like everything sweet so this was a hit for me with the sugar adjustment.

I Used 2 tablespoon of  wine vinegar instead, and redced oil to 2 tablespoon. This was great accompaniment to the texas slow cooker pork. Also used a small head of  cabbbage(shredded) and a large shredded carrot instead of the bagged coleslaw mix.

This is a relatively familiar recipe for me but still remains a favourite for everyone I prepare it for. I also scale back the sugar a tad,  sub the oil for a couple dollops of sour cream, white vinegar for white wine vinegar, add a Tbsp of Dijon mustard and the juice from 1/2 lemon and a few shakes of Franks (I did say relatively familiar...lol). I think the moral of the story is that using the staple ingredients is key, but mess with 'em as you like. Thanks for the recipe Sandi!

This is the best coleslaw recipe!  I use regular mayo instead of miracle whip, apple cider vinegar instead of white vinegar and celery seeds instead of poppy seeds.  Those are just minor changes and are just to our tastes but I know it would be 5 stars the way it is written too!

This is one of my favorite recipes on this site.    My favorite cole slaw was Kentucky fried chicken but this is by far better than any i have ever tasted.    The only change i make is i buy the broccoli slaw.

This was very good! I made this for a fundraiser and it was so good.  I did decrease the sugar by 1/2 cup as other reviews stated it was a little on sweet side.  I substituted Apple Cider Vinegar which I like better in cole slaw.

I have made this recipe over and over. I've served it to sooo many people and everyone loves it!  I did change a couple things just to cut down a bit on the sweetness and fat. Instead of Miracle Whip I use regular mayo but not 2/3 of a cup. I cut it down to 1/2    of a cup and add low fat plain yogurt for the rest. I also cut the oil to 2 tbsps. and the sugar to 1/3 cup. It is a fabulous slaw!

Eagerly, I sat down at my computer to pull this recipe up. I had made it a week or so ago and after serving it at dinner to my Mom and Dad, Mom brought me a head of cabbage so I would make some up for them. With horror, I realized I had not saved it to my recipe box! Nearly had a heart attack trying to find it! When I did find it the first thing I did was click the "add to recipe box" tab and only THEN could I breathe with relief! Whew! It is wonderful! The only changes I made personally was to use a whole onion per bag of slaw mix rather than the 2 tablespoons called for...(in this family you can't get enough onion) and I used celery seed instead of poppy seed. 
My nephew declared it wasn't "LIKE" KFC, it WAS KFC slaw! My only slaw recipe from now on...making it for a friends b-day party where I will no doubt have a few recipe cards with this recipe on it to hand out to everyone that wants it....this is your recipe folks!

Yep, this one's a keeper. I made lots of changes for our own health needs. Instead of sugar, used the equivalent of granular Stevia, mayo (as I didn't have Miracle whip), olive oil (instead of veggie oil), and celery seed (instead of poppy). Also shredded my own cabbage :-)

I've been using a recipe from my husband's family that was passed down for over a century.  This was a lot easier with less ingredients, and no one seemed to notice the change.  Great taste!  If you have a food processor, make your own coleslaw by cutting up the cabbage, shredding carrots, and by chopping up a small green pepper, celery, and onion.  You'll get a lot more coleslaw for a lower price.  I also made a homemade version of Miracle Whip for this.

We loved it!  I give it a 5 for taste, but a 4.5 for execution.   Proportionately, it's really got lots of sauce, sort of soup-y.   I also agree w/other reviewers who suggest it has too much sugar.  But it is light and refreshing and invites you to take another scoop!  Really a good basic to have in my book, thank you!

I found this coleslaw to be good, but not as good as Restaurant Style Coleslaw 11, from this site, which is tangier and tastes more like the KFC slaw (but I did omit the buttermilk which was too much liquid)  Try it.  Everyone raves about it and wants the recipe.

This is by far the best coleslaw ever.  I usually omit the vegetable oil, salt and poppy seeds, and substitute Apple cider vinegar for the white vinegar.  My kids (9,7 & 5) regularly request this for dinner/lunch.

This was my first venture with making cole slaw.  I would have to say that it was even better than restaurant slaw.  DEFINITELY better than deli counter slaw!!!! Yum yum!!  Made it just as written except for using mayo in place of Miracle Whip (personal preference). As posted, it does get more watery as it sits (no fault of the recipe, just the nature of cabbage). The taste just gets better and better as it sits and its super simple to drain off excess fluids if desired.  Unquestionably a keeper!!  ***** UPDATE: Just made it again but this time, used Broccoli Slaw (found same place as shredded cole slaw in store). did taste different than original but still very, very good. And healthier!!  Either version is a winner!!!!

I hate to be the "odd man out" but I did not like this recipe.  I followed the recipe almost exactly and I found it to be lacking in flavor (except sweet, it had plenty of that) and I could feel the oil in my mouth.  I can't imagine why I thought it was a good idea to add 3 tablespoons of oil.  I added a sprinkle of onion powder and the same of garlic powder.  A lot of people like this one so it must be good but I'll make sure I have all the ingredients for my favorite recipe, next time, or I just won't make it.

We use this regularly for our coleslaw at home.  It tastes wonerful.  More sweet than tart.  When you mix, it may look a little dry.  With an hour or two in the fridge, it's perfect.

This was good and easy!  Trying to reduce carbs, I made it with the Splenda that measures like sugar.  The packaged slaw was 3 net carbs per 1 cup serving, 5 carbs minus 2 g fiber. I used real mayo, 1 Tbsp onion (because the onion was strong) and less oil because I prefer slaw that is not too liquidy.  Vinegar varies, using white vinegar adds the perfect tartness.  Looking forward to using this on turkey or corned beef low carb wraps! Thanks for posting!

Definitely a really good recipe - but: Cut down the sugar! I use light miracle whip and mix it with 1/3 fat free yoghurt. Reduced the sugar 50% and squeeze in a little bit orange-juice. Makes it lighter with less calories but still delicious i think!

very good for pulled pork sandwiches. I cut up my own mix instead of using bagged. Cabbage cut into small strips and carrots, onion, and apples grated thinly. During the summer, I often add a few fresh, garden radishes. The apple helps to sweeten it so I cut the sugar down to about 1/3 cup, add a little mustard, fresh cracked pepper, garlic salt, mayo instead of miracle whip and I never have poppy seeds, so I just omit them. Thanks for the great recipe!

I wanted to use the remaining cabbage left over from another recipe and came across this cole slaw recipe.
I substituted Splenda for sugar so that there would be less calories per serving. It works and is absolutely delicious. I will definitely make this again.

SO DELICIOUS!
Im making this for a family potluck and i cant wait for everyone to try it, if i don't eat it before it gets ther! Haha.

I did have to make a few substitutions based on stuff i didn't have, like instead of vegetable oil i used canola, then celery seeds instead of poppy, and i didn't have white vinegar so i used my apple cider vinegar which goes REALLY well. I did cut down on the sugar based on the reviews and added a bit more vinegar after i tasted it, and i think its perfection. Really great recipe!!!
Im going to use it over, and over for sure.

Delicious!!  Next time I will reduce the sugar to 1/3 cup, because it was just a tiny bit too sweet, but this is really what I've been looking for.  I will probably tadd a little more shredded red cabbage next time, too.

I don't eat cole slaw, but my husband and mother does, and they said that this was as close as you can get to what you can order from any restaurant. I have made it twice within a week. The first time, I made it with everything but the poppy seeds because I didn't have any. The second time I made it, I included the poppy seeds, used finely diced celery in place of onions, and added 2 tsp of half and half, since my husband likes it more wet. He said that it was exactly like he remembered the way his grandfather made it who was a cook in the navy. 
Thank you for a recipe that I will be making for years to come.

I always get compliments when I serve this.  The only change I make to the recipe is to use 1/4 cup of sugar instead of 1/2 cup.

Love cole slaw - just about any way you can fix it.  This is a very good one, with just the right hint of sweetness.  Using the coleslaw mix this can be put together in about 5 minutes.  Thanks Sandi Johnson for sharing your version.

Used real mayo, red onion, and no poppy seed cause I didn't have any. Oh and I omitted the oil cause I didn't think it was necessary. And add a dash of pepper! Tasted great!

KFC where we live is nothing like this.  We do, however, like KFC a lot.  But, WE LOVE THIS ONE!!  I have always been partial to a sweet slaw.  Only thing I do differently is use celery seed instead of poppy and add a few raisens and nuts occasionally.  
Good stuff, although it makes a fair size bowl, it does not last long enough to get that soggy old slaw consistency because my family just snacks on it right along with the other TV snacks.

First time making slaw and this turned out great! I used mayonnaise instead of salad dressing, about 1/2 onion, about 5 tablespoons vinegar, no poppy seeds, a little dash of pepper and instead of carrots I cut up one medium tomato to give it some color. My husband is very picky and he loved it!

I think that I have found my favorite slaw recipe. Didn't have any poppy seeds on hand, so I just omitted that step. Made this for "hillbillie hot dogs", and something came up that we didn't eat this till 3 days later. I figured that it would be watery, and it wasn't. Next time I will have the poppy seeds. Thanks for sharing.

excellent slaw! The only downfall is the "dressing" becomes pretty runny after it sits much longer than a couple of hours. Fortunately the taste is not affected... I've made this 3 times and have not been disappointed :)

Absolutely delicious! I only used 1/3 c sugar and left out the oil altogether.  It was still great and even my picky 9 year old ate it!

I make a similar slaw dressing except I use less sugar and add some celery salt instead of using
poppy seeds (many people cannot have the seeds).
I also like to add some finely chopped sweet green
pepper.

I've never made Cole before this. But this recipe is outstanding. I do recommend cutting the sugar back to 1/4 cup, but apart from that it is outstanding! I would have rated a 5 star, but the salad tends to collect moisture in the bottom of the storage bowl. I hope I can find a remedy, but if not it's still GREAT.

It makes pulled pork twice as good.

Great salad, I added a few caraway seeds and used organic blue agave (1 Tbs.) in exchange for sugar to reduce the sugar amount. It was creamy and delicious. And not too sweet.
Next time I might add a few sprinkles of crumbled bacon to alter it a little bit. (I like to give recipes a little extra, once tried)
Its saved on my favorite list. Thanks!

This is a WONDERFUL recipe. I am a HUGE cole slaw lover and usually only eat it in restaurants as even the stuff sold in the grocery stores do not taste good. I am so in love with this recipe, that I had to go and buy a bag three times the size to make a new batch, I am wrapping every meal around cole slaw for the whole weekend. :) Love it!

Wonderful! Added light mayo instead of Miracle Whip.  Also added 1/2 poppy seeds and 1/2 celery seeds.  Used carrots also.  Having it for dinner tonight on hotdogs... can't wait! Yum!

As is, this recipe gets a generous three stars.  Waaaaay too much sugar.  I wish I'd read reviews before making this for a huge fish fry, now I don't even want to serve it.  Definitely would be good with maybe a tablespoon or two of sugar.

I gave this 4 stars because there was a little to much sugar. I ended up only adding a table spoon of sugar, reduced the salt and used celery salt. Then i added a heaping table spoon of low fat sour cream, mmmmm. delish.

I had never made slaw before and used this recipe and it was good at first attempt. Thinking it was slightly off for my taste buds but spot on for the title thus 5 stars. I then ditched the poppy seeds, added fresh cracked pepper, USED 1/2 SUGAR (why so much?), used seasme oil for 2 tablespoons and 1 of olive, red wine vinegar, garlic salt and about 1/8 cup onions (almost paper thin sliced and diced)

No surprise, everyone at the event loved this slaw, even a few "i love the slaw...and i don't usually like cole slaw!"  Of course it was meant to accompany my pulled pork sliders, which this slaw is seriously the PERFECT accompaniment to pulled pork.  My variation: 2T diced onion (from the spices aisle, i didn't bother dicing an onion!,) 1/2 c. LIGHT mayo,  2T vinegar, and 1/4 c. + 2 T sugar...plus i used celery seeds instead of poppy seeds, and I doubled what the recipe called for.  Plus some fresh cracked black pepper... the recipe sounded too sweet for my liking and i wanted something a little tangier, thus cutting out some sugar and adding in more vinegar (if you want just add to taste.)  turned out great...now i have a keeper for cole slaw!

I also used mayo (Hellman's light was on hand).  Sweet, but yummy.  I used just under 1/2 a cup, might try to take it down to 1/3 next time.  Almost omitted the poppy seeds, but glad I didn't - the flavor is delicious!

Pretty darn good!  I used canaola mayo and substituted good local honey for the sugar (1-3/4 tbl but I would put about 2 to 2-1/4 tbs next time), I added a little over 1/4 tsp dry mustard, few shakes of pepper a little more salt.  I used olive oil instead of canola.  I will probably add some radishes as others have done.  Very good slaw.  I will use it again.

If you like sweet slaw this is the recipe for you! Absolutely wonderful flavor and extremely simple to make. I couldn't recommend a better recipe for cole slaw than this one here. Friends & family think I'm a genius! I just smile graciously and say "thank you".

Every good thing they say about this slaw is TRUE!  It is, in my opinion, actually BETTER than KFC coleslaw, especially after it's chilled for a day.   I added about a teaspoon of horseradish, for that hint of hot. YUM!

I love this coleslaw. It is the best I've had in a long time. The only thing I omit is the onion and I use celery seed instead of poppy. Still 5 star worthy. It works great in big batches. Everyone who has it loves it.

This was the best recipe yet.  I did substitute 1/3 cup splenda for the sugar and added celery seed for the poppy seed.  Will definitely keep this one!

Holy Yumness!! I am usually not a fan of coleslaw, but this is delicious! (I used locally grown cabbage and carrots instead of bagged)

I made this a few nights ago with a few changes. I used light Mircle Whip, Splenda packets (1/4 cup) instead of sugar, and 1-2-3 Canola oil instead of vegetable oil. YUMMY!!! This is the only cole slaw recipe I will be using from now own.

This was a little too sweet for me, but that's no reflection on this easy recipe!  I made it the night before and was a little worried.  But it was the perfect consistency.  Thanks Sandi

Just tried this recipe.  Loved it! Used angel hair coleslaw (something new to me), didn't have poppy or celery seeds, but I will next time. And there WILL be a next time. And may add some apples, which I love in coleslaw.  Thanks for this great and easy recipe!

My husband, who doesn't like cabbage or cole slaw, tasted it and said "that's pretty good, even if it is cole slaw."  I'm a believer.  I only put 1 Tbsp olive oil and didn't put the onions in.  Loved the taste of the dressing!

This is my favorite also.  I've been making this sweet dressing for years....but I use about 1/4 cup of sweet pickle juice instead of vinegar, no oil or salt, and celery seed instead of poppy seeds.  My extended family love it.

This is a definite keeper.  I shredded my own cabbage/carrot slaw mix, so am not sure how much it weighed. I made the dressing exactly as in the recipe, and then added a bit more cabbage/carrot slaw to make the dressing lighter overall, the way my boyfriend likes it. I was really amazed how great it is!

My Mom made this all time when I was growing up.  She always used Mir Whip, and added a chopped, unpeeled apple and a few coarsely chopped walnuts.  She called it Waldorf Salad.  Not sure it is the "real" Waldorf, tho.  I will probably cut the sugar slightly as we don't like things too sweet, but otherwise this will be a favorite.  Thanks for reminding me of  it!!

This slaw was so good, my family scarfed it right up and my mother has asked me to make it again 2 days later. I think she's addicted :P

With diabetics in my home, I replaced the sugar with Splenda. I also replaced vegetable oil with olive oil.

This is  afantastic recipe.  Like suggested, I cut back on the sugar and only added 1/4 cup.  I can't imagine what it would taste like with 1/2 cup.  I also addeed about 1 tsp extra vinegar and left out the onion.  Best slaw we've ever had!

This is an excellent coleslaw recipe which went well with pulled pork.  I changed the following:
1 large head of cabbaged sliced thinley
1 large onion diced fine
1 cup of real mayonaise
3 tablesppon of olive oil
1/c sugar

I ommited the salt and seeds and came up with very tangy slaw which soon vanished!
1 tablespoon of balsamic vinegar

I read some of the comments about it being too sweet and since I try to steer clear of pesticide ridden food, I used organic broccoli shred mix from Trader Joes.  The broccoli really balanced out some of the excess sweetness previously referred to.  Since the bag of broccoli shreds is smaller than 16 ounces, I supplemented it with additional shredded carrots.  This is by far the best coleslaw dressing recipe I have made - sorry Grandma but this recipe has topped our secret family recipe!

wonderful...everyone loved it. I made it at noon and let it sit in the fridge until supper. The only change I made was adding a tad more vinegar, 1/3 cup sugar and celery seed instead of poppy seeds.

Yay! So good. I haven't found a coleslaw recipe I liked until this one. It was pretty sweet so next time I think I will reduce the sugar a little and add a little more vinegar but really, so good.

My family and I absolutely love this recipe! It's delicious! The only thing I do differently is I don't use the poppy seeds, and I increase the dressing by almost half simply because my bags of coleslaw are only 12 oz, so I use 2 bags. Thank you so much for this recipe!

This is awesome! LOVE LOVE LOVE it! It did seem a little sweet after following the directions exactly so I just added about a tsp more of vinegar and it was perfect! Also also used celery salt instead of poppy seed and then added a little pepper to give a little more flavor. It is awesome! Go try it!

Delicious...sweet, but very good. My kids could not get enough of it. If you like sweet, I do not recommend changing the recipe. If you do not like sweet, you may want to consider a different recipe.

Really great.  I have made this a few times and it is very good albeit very sweet as written.  I followed a few other suggestions and use mayo instead of miracle whip and cut the sugar just by a bit.

I made this with mayonnaise, celery seeds, and apple cider vinegar, and it came out great. Initially, I wanted to reduce the amount of sugar, since there were several comments that suggested doing so. However, I ended up using almost the full amount anyway. Great dressing! Even my husband, who is not a fan of "chewy" salads liked this.

I made this with a 12 oz. bag of broccoli slaw, used mayo instead of Miracle Whip (because I don't have any), omitted the onion because I was lazy, and omitted the poppy seeds because I don't have any.  I also only used 1/3 C sugar.  This is a REALLY good cole slaw recipe!

This is the best coleslaw ever!!!!!  I've made it several times now and it's always a huge hit whether I follow the recipe as listed or my personal preference is to use Hellmann's mayo and omit the onion and poppy seeds.  Great recipe Sandi, thanks for sharing it.

I love this coleslaw.  I make it a lot.  I use fresh carrots and cabbage in the summer.  The dressing is very good and it does taste like restaurant quality.

HOLY MOLY! Awesome slaw! This coming from a country raised Georgia girl who only eats my memaw's slaw! Everyone who eats it has rave reviews! The only things I do different are, instead of raw onions, I just throw in minced onion because it's on hand and I do not add the poppy seeds. Best slaw ever! So glad I found this recipe!

Delicious, with the amount of sugar cut in half, as other reviewers suggested. Also, I use real mayonnaise (Dukes) instead of Miracle Whip, and cider vinegar (doubled to 2 tablespoons). Everyone I've served slaw to, dressed using this recipe, loves it. Most say it's the best slaw they've ever had. Also, the dressing keeps really well, so I make up double batches and store it in the fridge for whenever we need it. Another thing that's good is to sub celery seed for the poppy seeds, or use a mix of both. I found this recipe a few years ago, and haven't bought slaw dressing since.

I did tweek this recipe a bit. I chopped cabbage, carrots and purple cabbage instead of bag coleslaw mix. I used Cains mayo instead of Miracle Whip I added a lot more vinegar less vegetable oil and I didn't add any poppy seeds. It was WONDERFUL.  I am very critical of cole slaw and this was the best every.

Delicious! I only used 1/2 the recipe for a bag of coleslaw mix (Dole). I used apple cider vinegar and doubled the amount since I prefer more of a tangy dressing. I also used 1/2 poppy seed and 1/2 celery seed. Served this with pulled pork sandwiches.

Rave reviews from family.  Tastes like the sweet coleslaw we had at a popular chain restaurant in Barbados.  I added raisins to the salad.

I don't really like slaw, so it's hard for me to rate this. But, everyone enjoyed it. Next time I'll use mayo since the sugar makes this sweet already, instead of miracle whip.

Excellent recipe - Thank you, Sandi! I made a few changes to my taste: Used 1/2 cup mayonnaise, instead of salad dressing; cut white sugar to 1/4 cup; and used cider vinegar instead of white vinegar

Made it, loved it.   It whips up in a flash.  Used real mayo and little less sugar to begin with and it was so good, didn't add the rest.   My husband says it's his all time favorite now and I agree.  We like the crunch so we toss some of the dressing in the coleslaw mix right before eating.  Hmmm.   Thanks for the great recipe.

I didn't have a bag of coleslaw so I just shredded a small head of cabbage and about 8 baby carrots. I didn't have miracle whip so I just used regular mayo, and I didn't have poppy seeds so I subbed celery seed. I would cut down the sugar to a little more than 1/4 cup next time because it was a little too sweet. Other than that this was excellent!

Definitely let this marinate longer than a couple hours.  I was shocked by how much juicier it got.  I used regular mayo and cut the sugar to 1/3 cup and it was delicious!

Word is in!  According to my family, this is THE best coleslaw ever!  After reading reviews, I knew I wanted to stick to the basic recipe and give it a shot.  In the end, I only made a couple minor changes so it would be more like KFC's (which my family loves).  I chopped my bag of 16oz. coleslaw mix into smaller chunks like KFC.  I added one shredded carrot because my mix was a little lite on the carrots.  Inadvertantely used only 2T of vegetable oil - and it was fine - and used celery seed instead of poppy because that's what I had and it seems to fit better.  I also used a tablespoon of Apple Cider Vinegar in addition to the regular.  According to my family, this coleslaw is "the bomb dot com" so I had to taste it - and it's the first time I ever really liked Coleslaw.  It's a bit sweet for my taste, but the family says it's supposed to be.  Thank you so much for posting this family favorite recipe!!!

I agree that it is a bit too sweet.  Also, if you really want to get the Chicken Store experience, you have to cut the cabbage and carrots into little tiny pieces the way they do.   It's not just a texture or visual thing, you'll find that the tiny pieces really allow the flavors to mingle.

I made the dressing exactly as directed in the recipe,  I did use cabbage and carrots I grew in my garden instead of using the mix from the store.  I'm not a miracle whip kinda girl, always prefer mayo, but a personal rule is to always make a new recipe the way the author directs before making any changes.  I'm glad I used the miracle whip, it added a nice mellow tang.  This was the sweetest, freshest tasting coleslaw I have ever tasted.  Everyone absolutely loved it.  The dressing was great, not too sweet for me.  It was a little runny, but I think that is from the natural juices of the cabbage - the juices did not deter from the yummy-ness, just needed a slotted spoon.  I'm thinking of doubling my cabbage crop next year just so I can enjoy more of this wonderful coleslaw.  I'm sure it will be hit with the store bought coleslaw mix, too.  I will definately make this recipe again.  Thanks Sandi!

Really good. Doubled the coleslaw mix to feed a group of 14, but only used 1 1/2 times the amount of dressing. Everyone liked this, even people who normally don't care for coleslaw (me included). I used organic mayo, instead of MW, cut the sugar in half, used poppy seeds and celery seeds, apple cider vinegar, only 1 1/2 TBS of olive oil instead of vegetable, and didn't use onion.

This recipe is really sweet! I guess I should have believed the title when I read it. It has to be modified to reduce the sugar to appeal to more people. I have made it 3 times to try to get the sugar balance right. On my last try I think I may have come really close. I used regular mayo instead of salad dressing, because it has no added sugar to it. I added about 1/4 tsp more vinegar and cut the sugar in half to 1/4 cup. I may even cut the sugar back a tad more next time. As is I can't say I have ever had coleslaw this sweet anywhere? And, I really like coleslaw. When the ingredients are mixed the dressing will settle to the bottom some, but the coleslaw actually tastes pretty good then.

This is by far the BEST cole slaw you will EVER make!!  First of all, no changes need to be made to this recipe!! Make it as it states and it will be perfect everytime.  Trust me, I found this recipe almost a year ago and have made it SEVERAL times.  My husband, 16 month old, and the rest of my family (even my mother-in-law) ask me to make "My" cole slaw every chance it can be made with a meal.  Great side dish for BBQ, Fish, Crab legs, and amazing on top of hot dogs.  I just can't say enough good things about this slaw!!  I LOVE IT  :)  lol

Very tasty and easy to make.  I made a few adjustments which I would highly recommend: used good mayo instead of Miracle Whip, and added a bit of extra vinegar so the mix was not as thick.  I also cut real cabbage after eyeing the wilty looking pre-cut coleslaw mixes at the grocery store.  As a result, our coleslaw was really crunchy and lasted a few days for leftovers.  I'd also recommend letting it marinate longer than the recommended two hours - ours marinated for four and I think it could have used another two hours (next time I'll try six hours). We served this with brisket and cornbread - delish!

Delicious!  This is great even eliminating the oil and substituting a non-caloric sweetener (like splenda) for the sugar!  I always get asked for the recipe.

very good slaw, I used 1/2 cup sugar and it was plenty sweet for us, I probably would not like this with the full amount of sugar.  thanks for the recipe.

Excellent reviews everytime.  Instead of 2/3 c. salad dressing, I use 1/4 c. light mayo and 1/4 c. light miracle whip.  I also reduce sugar to 1/3 c.

My husband loved this recipe. It was a little too sweet, but maybe it's because I used rice vinegar because I had it on hand. I didn't have poppy seeds, but overall, it turned out really well. Served it with BBQ pork sandwiches made using the Slow Cooker Pulled Pork recipe on the site and baked beans.

Very very yummy! After reading other reviews decided only on 1/4 c sugar(want to try Splenda maybe next time)and used miracle whip lite.. and olive oil only 2T. Turned out great. Seemed dry when first made but then turned out perfect for dinner couple hours later.

Yes, it said "sweet," and yes I reduced the sugar as others have suggested, but this was still way too sweet.

Holy toledo!  This was great!  Made a few modifications based on what I had on hand - used mayo, olive oil, tarragon vinegar, and sesame seeds, and doubled the onion.  Not to 'improve' but because it was all I had.  I think it illustrates that this is a hardy recipe and the key ingredient is the sugar.  I did not find it too sweet - perfect!

Made it exactly as written the first time.  YUM!!!  the second time, the store didn't have the packaged coleslaw, so chopped up my own--it was very disappointing, very watery.  Third time, back to the package-success!  Thanks for a winning recipe

This is some really good slaw.  Like most of the others, I halved the sugar and used Best Foods Canola Mayo instead of Miracle Whip (not one of my favorite products).  I cut the veg. oil to 2 T and added an extra T of vinegar.  It was great!  It makes me remember a restaurant on the East Coast that was called Marblehead Munchies that used to have this great sandwich with tons of stuff in it including slaw like this.   I served it with pulled pork bbq sandwiches and corn on the cob.

I just made this coleslaw for the first time and without even letting it chill first I can tell you that this one is a keeper! I'm diabetic so I used Splenda (1/2 cup) instead of the sugar. Absolutely delicious!

I have made this several times and always get compliments. It is super easy to make and cheaper than buying a creamy coleslaw at a deli counter. I substitute rice wine vinegar and use celery seed. I also add the sugar to taste as I find using the full amount is a bit too sweet.

Whoever had to torture the Colonel to get this recipe gets my vote for president!  We've quit buying our coleslaw as carryout from the chicken place!  In a pinch, I've used green onions instead of white.  I've also had to improvise and use red wine vinegar instead of white.  It turns out great following the tradional or the makeshift recipes.  Thanks!

This is truly one of the best cole slaw recipes EVER! I used 1/2 the oil and a 1/3 c. Splenda in place of the sugar the second time I made it. I found it to be great either way.

The dressing just tasted like sweet Miracle Whip as written. I love Miracle Whip, but I want my cole slaw to taste like cole slaw, not MW! I added about 3T more white vinegar, plus 2-3T red wine vinegar, and only used about 2/3 the sugar and it turned out quite tasty. The red wine vinegar added a nice flavor along with a touch of color.

I made this tonight and it was ok - but it's super sweet. I used 1/3 cup sugar and it was still very sweet.  It's not likely that we will make it again just considering how sweet it is.

I also added some finely chopped celery and did cut down some on the sugar.  I used real mayo and canola oil but otherwise the same.  It is a great base to work from.

I substituted the sugar with a few packets of splenda (for the diabetics).  I also left out the salt (for the renal diet folks).  I used sliced red cabbage and julienned carrots because the supermarket was out of the slaw mix.  I also substituted the miracle whip with mayonnaise.  The recipe was a hit!  I will make this again.

Easy & delicious.  It stays crisp even after several days.  The first time I made it as directed.  I cut the sugar back to 3 oz. instead of 4 the last time & it was just as good.

This was a good recipe, and my first time making cole slaw.  I followed recipe exactly except that I cut sugar down because it seemed like it would be too sweet.  I could not find bagged cole slaw mix, so I bought a head of cabbage and shredded it myself, along with carrots.  I used celery seed instead of poppy seeds because of others suggestions.  Mixed it all together and let it sit overnight.  Tasted it in the morning and it was still pretty bitter, the fresh cabbage had a distinctive taste!  So I added the rest of the sugar that I left out previously and it was great.  Next time I will shred my cabbage a little finer because my only complaint was that the pieces were too big.  Word to other chefs:  Make recipe as called for and it will be wonderful!

Amazing recipe.  Is great, but even better the next day.  Bowl starts out almost overflowing, but after it sits for a couple of hours it is a much smaller volume than you started with.  This is the best cole slaw recipe I've tried and my company agrees

Wow!!!  The best cole slaw recipe I have ever made!  The dressing is just perfect with using only 2 tbls. of oil.  My husband recently arrived to the USA from Morocco and he never had cole slaw before he arrived here.  Tried some at a local restaurant and said not bad.  Tried this one - and he was raving about it to family and friends here and in Morocco.  Thanks for a quick and easy receipe that is a real keeper!!

I reduced the sugar to 1/3 C, you can always add, you can never take away.  I thought 1/3 C was plenty.  Could've used a bit more salt.  I substituted the Poppy Seeds for Celery Seed as others suggested.

Made this for our Memorial Day picnic and it was TOPS!  My family and friends told me to never buy dressing in a jar again.  An easy recipe that pulls together in no time with ingredients already in the pantry.

SO Good!!!  I tried this recipe for the first time this past weekend.  This was a huge hit and everyone raved about it and asked for the recipe.  I made this exactly as written, no changes, absolutely perfect as written.  Thank you for sharing this great recipe...which will now be the standard one I'll be going to over and over.

This was pretty good.  I've never had a sweet coleslaw before, and I thought adding poppy seeds was interesting.  I'll probably make it again, but I do prefer the KFC Copycat recipe.

Very delicious. I don't like coleslaw but everyone else in the family does, so I tried it.  It is great!  Don't add too much of the wet ingrediants, you will think it will not cover all the slaw, just keep stirring and over time, it does tend to get a little watery but you can drain a little out or add more coleslaw mix.  I just left it as it was, stirred a little before serving to refresh it and Voila!  A definite keeper!

Best cole slaw recipe I have found with a few changes.  I used mayonaise instead of salad dressing and still cut the sugar to about 1/3 cup.  I also left out the poppy seeds and substituted green onions for the onion. It was excellent this way.  This will forever be my cole slaw recipe!

This is a fantastic coleslaw recipe.  It's so very easy compared to other recipes I've tried in the past.  I have always dreaded making my tried and true coleslaw recipe because it's so time consuming but this recipe will be replacing my old one.  At first I thought the dressing had the consistency of frosting, because of the amount of sugar, but I forged ahead and it came out great.  Thank you!

Made 70 servings of this slaw for a New Orleans night at church.  I used the celery seed option and everyone loved it.  Will be making 100 servings in May for another meal, what a wonderful recipe.  Thank you!

I initially rated this a 5, after eating a bowl after only 30 mins.  But I have to say, I liked it less once it had refridgerated for 1 1/2 hours.  It got really soggy and soupy and became way too sweet and syrupy.  My hubby hated it and told me not to make it again, and my kids weren't all that thrilled with it either (and my daughter LOVES coleslaw).  I have no idea what went wrong, since all the other reviews are so positive, but I am not eager to make it again unless I plan to eat it immediately.  I was bummed it didn't turn out better.

I gave this recipe a 5 star because I halved the sugar to make it a 5 star.  Yummy!

I don't even like cole slaw (just made it for my boyfriend) and I thought it was delicious.  I left out the poppy seeds though.

FABULOUS! So easy and everyone loved it!  I used splenda versus sugar and celery seeds versus poppy seeds.  I also used reduced fat mayo and a broccoli coleslaw mix. Tasted just like KFCs!  Will make again!

Six thumbs up from my husband, a friend and myself. Might go with a bit more onion next time...only used 1/4 c sugar with Miracle Whip and switched 1/4 tsp celery salt for salt & poppy seeds. Will definitely make this again because I know I'll be begged to do it...but making it the night before makes it SO good and it's quite easy.

Not bad! I cut back on the sugar and added more vinegar. Used apple cider vinegar and also added onion powder. Did not use poppy seeds. Good slaw!

I have never been a fan of Coleslaw, but my other half loves it, so after 34 years of marriage, I decided to try making it for him on his birthday. I bought the BIG bag of mix, and calculated I'd need to quadruple the recipe! The amount of Miracle Whip and sugar was a little shocking, but hubby LOVED the slaw; best he'd ever had, apparently! Served it with Shepherd's pie. Everyone enjoyed, and had seconds- even me! he was finishing it off two days later. A little soupy by then, but still delicious! No point messing with the recipe. It might not be the Weight watchers choice, but it's a tasty option. I imagine it would be fantastic with pulled pork!

I make a lot of different slaws, blue cheese, barbecue,  vinegar, greek, etc., but this recipe is the one I go to most often.  I do cut back on the the sugar by half and it is still plenty sweet. I also use regular mayo and not miracle whip.

This recipe is so easy to make and tastes just like the names says, "Sweet Restaurant Slaw".  I was pleasantly surprised at how the ingredients blended together to make an impeccable slaw flavor.  My whole family loved it!  This recipe has made its way into my "Favorite Recipe" collection.

This is the best cole slaw that I have ever made!  It's so simple but yet so tasty and I think the reason is because of the little diced onion....I would never think of adding diced onion to cole slaw but it blended with everything beautifully!!!I did substitute celery seed for the poppy seed and it was great!  I fixed it last night and got lots of compliments on it!  This is my recipe from now on!!!!

This is a great recipe!  BUT....i do agree with the other reviews that the sugar should be cut in half and the dressing is too soupy for the recommended amount of slaw mix. SOOO....i shred up a small cabbage head and grate up a few carrots myself.  This makes a lot more mix and I keep the recommended dressing mix the same except for cutting the sugar in half.  IT'S SOOO GOOD!

I've made this many times at BBQs to go along with pulled pork, etc. It is delicious and always GONE very quickly. It is heavy on the dressing - so I either add more cabbage or don't add as much dressing, etc. Whatever the case may be, I marinate it in the dressing at least 12 hours before serving so the flavors have time to really combine. AMAZING!

I had to tweak this recipe a bit, but only because I do not like a lot of the miracle whip on my coleslaw.  I do not like to cover the flavor of the cabbage.  I also added a 1/2 a teaspoon of pepper, and 1/2 a tablespoon of minced garlic, and 1/4 teaspoon mustard with horseradish.  This recipe is great how it is, but for my family this is how we prefer it.  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe, I have never been able to eat and like coleslaw until this, original, recipe.

I did like this recipe and I would have given it 5 stars if I hadn't read the other reviews and reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup instead of the 1/2 cup the original calls for. I didn't think it was sweet enough with only half the amount of sugar. It was a little on the tangy side, which was good, but I think it would have been better with a half cup of sugar to offset the tangy-ness. And I didn't think it was goopy at all. Next time I make it, I will use the recipe as is and it should be a 5-star rating. :)

It was too sweet for my taste. I used almost a whole head of cabbage and didn't quite use 1/2 cup of sugar and 1 cup of mayo instead of miracle whip but it was still too sweet. Next time, I think I will cut down on the sugar even more.

We have used this recipe for the past several years and love it.  Over time, I have adjusted to our family taste/make it a bit healthier - leave out oil, decrease sugar to 1/3 cup, increase vinegar to 2Tbsp.  Wonderful taste, never lasts more than one meal here!

Tastes like the best creamy cole slaw recipe served in restaurants, authentic.  I will definitely cut back on the sugar substitute the next time.  Yes, I used substitute instead of sugar; it didn't compromise the taste.  Highly recommend.  Dressing stays on the slaw, unlike most recipes I've tried.

I shredded a whole large head of cabbage so I increased the mayo to 1 cup and doubled the vinegar. Didn't have poppy seeds either. Still turned out rave reviews at our Labor Day BBQ!! :)

Great as written but I tweaked it a little bit to fit my taste. I left out the oil...didn't miss it. Cut sugar amount in half, and it was still sweet enough  and delicious. Then I used celery seed instead of poppy seeds, and celery salt instead of regular salt. I love how this recipe simplified and guided me to make the perfect coleslaw.....thanks Sandi for sharing.

This is hands down the BEST slaw recipe I have ever used.  It is the ONLY one I make and one that I often bring to parties.  Even picky slaw eaters love it!  Perfect flavor, perfect consistency... just all around perfect!  Thank you for sharing a superb recipe!

This is great with the rootbeer pulled pork that is on this site that is cooked in the slow cooker!!!

I cut back on the sugar, used 1/4 cup.  I added a few extra splashes of vinegar until I liked the taste ( I prefer a more vinegar taste than sweet)

My grocery store only had a bag of shredded green cabbage so I shredded my own carrots and then used shredded radishes.  Great summer time, BBQ dish to bring to a pot luck too!!

It doesn't get any easier than this!  Simple to put together.  This is a good, basic recipe.  I didn't have poppy seeds on hand, which in my opinion had no effect on the flavor.  Next time I'll add some diced pineapple to make it a little more interesting.  Definitely a keeper.

I have been looking for the perfect cole slaw recipe and this is it!  Easy to make and taste even better a few days after.  I made the dressing the day before I was ready to use it and I only took out  the amount of salad I need it and put it together 20 minutes before use. It was nice and crisp. I think that if everything is mixed for a long period of time it will get soggy. Like other reviews I used mayo since I don't buy miracle whip.  Anyone that wants to try it, should.  Not sure if next time I will reduce the sugar to one third. The half cup did not bother me since me and my husband like sweet things. I also added a purple onion at the end before serving it. I did not used poppy seeds because I did not had them on hand. The best review on my side, my husband thought I bought it!!

I made this recipe but only used a 1/4 cup of sugar instead of 1/2 cup.  It was still far too sweet!  I was glad I tasted it before I mixed it into the coleslaw. I obviously will not use this recipe again.

I used half calorie wise Miracle Whip and half fat free sour cream, 1 tbsp oil, 1 tbsp sugar, 2 tbsps vinegar and omitted poppy seeds as I don't like them. I added a squirt of horseradish because I felt it needed something, that is why I added more vinegar as well, this was very sweet, I could not imagine using the 1/2 cup of sugar.

Whenever I make this, everybody comments on how much it tastes like (dare I say it) Kentucky Fried Chicken coleslaw.  I do reduce the sugar just a little bit, even though I like sweet things, this didn't need that much sugar.  It's surprising how when you initially mix the dressing with the cabbage, it looks like there is NO WHERE NEAR enough dressing...but don't let that fool you.  You must let it chill in the refrigerator for a few hours, and the cabbage softens up, resulting in a nice, crunchy and juicy salad.

I have never made slaw myself as I am pretty particular and like only one commercial slaw and that is KFC's. This comes very close and I will probably make it again. The two changes I made was I used 1/3 cup Miracle Whip and 1/3 cup mayo - my sister likes one and I prefer the other so we compromised; and I cut the sugar by half. Because of these changes I can't rate the original recipe but with my changes I liked this a lot and will add it to my recipe box.

This deserves 10 stars !!!!!!!!!!  It is out of this world good !!!!  I did cut back just a little on the sugar as one reviewer suggested.  I made this to go along with pulled pork for our annual Christmas Party so I made it a day ahead.  The longer it sits in this wonderful sauce the better it is!!!!!!!  Everyone who tried it absolutely loved it.  I have requests for the recipe in my e mail.  Thank You so very much for sharing !!!!!!!!!!!!

Leave out the poppy seeds - they aren't that pretty, and no one cares what this cole slaw looks like, because it's devoured so quickly!  This slaw is sweet, yet tangy (add extra vinegar or onion to up the "tang" factor).  I've yet to find anyone that doesn't like this recipe. It tastes like a better version of KFC.  This has quickly become my go-to  recipe for an easy, crowd-pleasing potluck/picnic/etc. dish.

Very good recipe!  I used what I had on hand...EVOO in place of vegetable oil.  When the sauce was mixed together, it was a nice, creamy texture and had a good zing to it (I added a tad bit more than 1TBSP of vinegar).  Will be my go-to recipe for coleslaw!  I used red onion, and added in some finely diced carrots as well, both for color :)

This was delicious! I used ranch and a little bit of french dressing and mixed them instead of miracle whip. I was out of mayo. I didn't have onions but that was fine. It was DELICIOUS!!! Whole family loved it.

I have made this cole slaw 3 times in the last couple of weeks.  I was going to order some from our local rib place, but thought I would give it a try. Everyone raves about it. Even my kids are eating it! I don't like to buy bag salads and mixes so I bought a white cabage and a purple one along with some carrots and shredded myself (very fast and easy). You can't get much fresher than that! Today I added some raisins and  chopped pecans for an added touch.

great recipe! it got devoured at our housewarming pot-luck i made this for. i followed instructions and chilled it for at least two hours before serving, which did make a big difference. but i was a little unimpressed with how runny it became after a bit. i ended up having to drain it some so it still looked appealing and had to stir it often. one suggestion i will make is to omit using miracle whip (being as how that has a more "sweet" taste) and use regular mayo- with the amount of sugar the recipe calls for, miracle whip would have been too much on the "sweet" side. i think the sugar could still be cut down just a bit. and i also did not use poppy seeds. i have never had a slaw with poppy seeds and saw no use or appeal for them. maybe i did something wrong with mine being runny, but otherwise, this is an excellent recipe and i will make it again.

This recipe is excellent. I like that you can use the pre-packaged shredded cabbage. I have used regular and purple cabbage and it was tasty both ways.

this is absolutely delicious!!! i didnt have the ready coleslaw mix so i used half a baby cabbage and one carrot which i washed and since i dont have a salad spinner, i put it in a clean pillow case, spun it outside until all the water was out and hung it on the washing line to dry for a few minutes. i did not want any water water messing up the end result! i did use slighlty less sugar than the recipe called for and a little more salt.i also added a pinch of white pepper. it was a huge hit!

Our daughter just married to the States and for her farewell-party I tried this as my second typical American recipe to serve with Pulled Pork - very good! Thank you very much for this recipe; I'll love to discover more and more at this site! Tomorrow morning I'm going to do the "best big, fat, chewy Chocolate Chip Cookies"...

Greetings from Germany and 

Sabine

I am only a fan of those fast food chickens coleslaws, I am very picky about it!  So I was a little weary of trying this, but I did love it.  I think it gives them a run for their money.  The only problem I had was I put too much onion in it, next time I will only put what the recipe calls for!

WOW! I used a half a head of cabbage and about 8 baby carrots... threw into food proccessor until minced.. ( I promise, this makes THE BEST coleslaw consistency EVER, Lee's Famous Recipe was always the only kind I have ever eaten!) ... I just eyeballed the mayo (used Hellmans), and used some sour cream (no oil), celery salt, salt, pepper, 3 capfuls of apple cider vinegar, and 1/3 cup sugar. This is the best coleslaw EVER! I will usually only eat it from Lee's Famous Recipe! From now on, I will be making my own!!! YUM! 4 stars for adjustments, but they were according to my preferences. If you are partial to Lee's, try my suggestions! You will be over the moon! ; D

This was a huge hit at the party.  I used mayo instead of miracle whip and celery seed rather than Poppy seeds.  It is the best coleslaw I've ever made.

I was a bit skeptical but based on all the positive reviews I decided to try the dressing and I'm glad I did! I cut back on the sugar a bit as suggested by others and only used 2 tbsp. of oil. I used it on a broccoli slaw. I added scallion, celery and fresh peas  and it was absolutely delicious!  Thanks for sharing the recipe - I will definitely use it again!

This is simply the best slaw I have ever eaten, much less made!  I served this with pulled pork BBQ  for an informal extended family dinner and all thought it was excellent.  Most highly recommended.

My 1st time making cole slaw. 1) I shredded my own veggies. 1 head cabbage, about 1/3 head red cabbage, 2 carrots. Cut cabbage with a knife. Shredded carrots w/a Benriner. Ended up with a lot of veggies (overflowing my large mixing bowl), so I doubled the sauce recipe. 2) It was honestly pretty gross seeing all the gloppy fatty goop that goes into the mixture. Next time I will try not doubling the sauce, and/or may try cutting out the oil, as one reviewer suggested. 3) Just after mixing it together, it tasted extremely sugary sweet. So I added another Tbsp of vinegar, another Tbsp of diced onion (leftover from my cutting board), and several dashes of salt. 4) After sitting for 2hrs in the fridge, liquid mixture/sauce had formed, so before serving, I drained that excess liquid and somewhat squeezed the slaw before putting into a serving bowl. About 1 hr later, the slaw was pooling again, so I think draining is a good thing. 5) The cole slaw was actually delicious. I mean, really really good! 6) Had the leftover slaw today. More liquid mixture formed so put the slaw in a colander and let it drain into a large bowl before eating. I figured it helped cut down on the fat and calories. Loved it.

This is hands down the best coleslaw recipe ever.  Tastes exactly like what you get at the restaurants.  Use Hellman's in place of Miracle Whip and you will have a keeper.  Don't change anything else.  If I could give it more stars I would.

I thought this was delicious, and I am from the Deep South.  Not too sweet and did not taste like pure mayo with a little cabbage in it.  I liked the slight vinegary taste as well.

Sweet, crunchy, not overpowering and no heavy salad dressing taste. This is my go to slaw recipe and I use it all the time. Fantastic on hot dogs or BBQ sandwiches, great with chicken or burgers. Even people that don't like coleslaw have told me they love this stuff. This is a keeper and I wouldn't add or change a thing.

yummy!  thank you for sharing.  i read a lot of the reviews and because i'm trying to follow a points diet, i omitted the oil completely and used splenda in place of white sugar - and used less splenda.  i used less splenda after reading other reviews.  so good, i'm making it again today.

I cut this recipe in half for just the two of us.  I wish I didn't.  It was so good, I don't have any leftovers :(
I really cut back on the sugar and used fat free Miracle Whip. (I personally can't taste any difference). It was delicious!!!

I decided to give 4 stars instead of lower stars only because I had changed up the recipe, so I thought it would be fair to give a couple extra stars. I agree, it's very very sweet, and I used regular Mayo. So next time, I will follow the recipe even though I dislike Miracle Whip, lol.

Very good, I did use a little less sugar and it came out just right (I used a 1/2 cup but filled it up until maybe a quarter inch below the top).

Love, love, love this!  Of all of the coleslaw recipes I’ve tried, this one is my absolute favorite.  If you like a creamy coleslaw, this recipe is for you.  I actually prefer a slaw that is less creamy and more crispy, so I doubled the amount of coleslaw.

I made this slaw for Memorial Day and it was a hit at our house.  I doubled the recipe as I had a crowd to feed.  I like slaw a little tangy so I added a little more vinegar to mine and kept tasting along the way to make sure I didn't overdo it.  Will definitely make this one again.

My husband went NUTS over this. He prefers mayo based slaws, but certainly didn't complain that I'd balanced out the sweetness with vinegar. Instead of coleslaw mix, I sliced up a fresh head of Savoy cabbage (if you've never tried Savoy, treat yourself). I also chose to add 1/2 cup each blueberries and golden raisins to add color and texture. After reading reviews, sauce consisted of 1 cup mayo, 2/3 cup sugar, 2 1/2 tablespoons rice wine vinegar, 1 teaspoon kosher salt and 3 tablespoons vegetable oil. Sliced onions on mandoline using thinnest setting, also sliced cabbage on mandoline. Never have poppy seeds, but always have celery seed. This was amazing. Lovely creamy sauce, ate slaw right after preparation and it was fantastic. We're looking forward to leftovers tonight.

Delicious! I made this twice and would definitely make again. I had to make a little more dressing tough, it wasn't enough to cover. I also used less sugar than called for.

I gave it 3 stars because I didn't try the actual recipe due to how many complaints there where of how sweet it the recipe is. So I used 1/4 of a cup of white sugar. Then I used an Italian dressing instead of white vinegar. I also used a Vegan Mayonnaise instead of regular and instead of poppy seeds I just salt and pepper. I'm kind of amazed at how good it turned out not using the vegan Mayonnaise.

I am not a coleslaw eater but I made this for a family cookout. I followed the recipe other than cutting the sugar back to 1/3 cup and substituting the poppy seeds for celery seed as others suggested. Everyone loved and raved over it. Certainly a keeper!

I made this recipe with a few changes. According to other reviewers, it was too sweet so I used 1/3 cup of sugar. I also cut the vegetable oil to 2-1/2 tablespoons instead of 3. I didn't add the poppy seeds and the only vinegar I had was white wine vinegar, so I used that. I didn't have much time to let it settle in the fridge for 2 hours so I put it in the freezer for about 30 minutes or so.. it seems to speed that process up a bit and it tasted pretty good. I'm not normally a fan of coleslaw but I think I'm starting to like it!

I generally prefer to make my own cole slaw from scratch including shredding the carrots, and cabbage myself. I like it to be cut fine. However, this recipe is a huge timesaver when you buy the bag of coleslaw mix at the store. I agree that the dressing is a little too sweet but I enjoyed it anyway. I used Miracle Whip and had just enough in my refrigerator for this recipe.  I think this recipe is excellent, especially if you're in a hurry. And I love that it does not require any unusual ingredients. Thank you, Sandi! (I did not add the poppy seeds because mine had been in the cupboard forever and I was afraid they would taste bad).

So yummy! I followed this recipe as directed except used real mayo instead of Miracle Whip, and omitted the poppy seeds. Wow! It was absolutely delicious and so easy! After reading other reviews I had concerns it may be too sweet, but it wasn't at all. I suspect switching to regular mayo made it slightly more tart than Miracle Whip would have, and that is exactly what I was going for. I'm not sure from where, but it tasted 'familiar' to me. I let it sit in the fridge for a couple of hours before serving. While it did have a lot of watery dressing underneath it, it remained crisp, light, and crunchy. I simply used a slotted spoon while serving to release excess dressing. I will be making this again, and I will not change a thing!

I used fresh red & green cabbage, carrots and green onions..  My dressing is with lite mayonnaise and I used celery salt instead of the poppy seeds ..  This is the second time in a week I have made this coleslaw, it is so delicious !!  I prefer fresh vegetables over the bag of mix, the first batch got eaten so quickly, I just had to make more !

I made this with 1/2 head of small cabbage (20 oz.) and 3 carrots, which I shredded in the food processor. I then used the food processor to make the dressing.  There was more than enough, despite initially looking a bit dry.

     I used mayo instead of Miracle Whip and celery seed instead of poppy seed, because I didn't have either.  I also reduced the sugar to 1/3 c. which was plenty of sweetness.  With these minor changes, only because I had to, this was excellent.  I will make this again!

I made this for a cookout and everybody LOVED it! I didn't change a thing. At first when I put it in the fridge I was hoping it would set up properly (it seemed dry) but sure enough, when I uncovered it the next day, it settle and there was more liquid in the bowl and it was perfect.

My husband LOVES coleslaw and he said this was awesome! I agree! It was very good and very easy.  I used mayonaise instead of miracle whip and reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup.  Any more sugar would have been way too sweet, but this recipe is a KEEPER!

This was a great stating slaw! I used celery seed instead of poppy and I used a little less than 1/2 cup Stevia instead of sugar. I made it up in the morning and put it in the refrigerator. Definitely a keeper! Thanks!

I used half the sugar called for in the recipe and it was still quite sweet. I think if I had used the full amount of sugar the coleslaw would have been thrown out. I used an extra Tbsp of vinegar and that was good. I will definately make again with these changes.

DH made this today following the recipe almost exactly (minus the poppyseeds).  It tasted fresh and delicious.  I thought it might be bland but the simple sauce really brings out the flavor of the fresh cabbage.  We wouldn't change anything next time except maybe add carrots for color.

The first time I followed the recipe exactly and it was too sweet for my taste. So the second time I cut sugar in half and it was much better. It's great to put this slaw in pulled pork sandwiches!

This coleslaw is delicious! It didn't convert my non-slaw kid, but when I asked my son if he liked it he replied, "I'm too busy eating to answer!" Tastes very much like KFC's coleslaw.

Made recipe exactly as written. The longer the mix sits, the juicier it gets and there appears to be less cabbage - it shrinks!

Not bad!  Not a huge cole slaw person, but it seemed to go well with NC BBQ.  This was the best recipe I'd tried, my guests all complimented it!  Would make again...I DID CUT SUGAR tho. I think that much sugar would ruin things.

Amazing!! I used rice wine vinegar as suggested by another used and cut the sugar down to 1/3 cup. It is key to let it sit for 2 hours or so, it creams right up. Better than restaurant slaw!!

Very good!  Only change I made was I halfed the amount of sugar and it was still plenty sweet and no onion.  It gets VERY "wet" after sitting in the frig for a little while, so don't think it's not enough dressing when you first make it.

Truely Awsome cole slaw. I added rainbow carrots for the color effect and the purple carrots dont change the entire salad purple like purple cabbage would. I also added about 1/2 tsp mustard powder and used scallions in place of onions because I had them on hand. You dont even have to wait the two hours to enjoy. LOVE IT.

Really good slaw, just a little too sweet.  I used Truvia sugar substitute and only used 1/2 of what was called for, but will cut down on the sugar next time.  I also used mayo made with olive oil and used olive oil in place of the vegetable oil, which was fine.  Great flavor overall!

Exceptional recipe. Made a few changes that really went over well. Used a Vidalia Onion Dressing/Poppy Seed Dressing and Wasabi Mayonnaise mixture to replace the Creamy Salad dressing. Did not use onions (because my wife hates 'em), used less sugar and omitted the poppy seeds because they were in the dressing I used. Was an absolute hit at the Superbowl party! Try it, you'll love it!

I love sweet coleslaw and this turned out great.  Tastes pretty close to KFC coleslaw (and thats what I compare any coleslaw to).  It does look dry at the beginning, but as it sits in fridge it gets better.

Very easy and delicious.  I went a little lighter on the sugar as others suggested and only used 2 Tbls of canola oil.

good base recipe. I made it very low fat by using 0% Greek yogurt instead of Miracle whip/mayo and only  1 TBSP of oil. Also, I am not a fan of super sweet coleslaw, so I only used 1/4 cup of sugar and that was plenty for our tastes.

Awesome slaw recipe!  I am very picky with my slaw, and I only like KFC's and Red Lobster's.  This is very good, it is a tad sweeter than either of those but is superb :)

As someone who isn't a great fan of cabbage or colslaw, I've become a convert with this recipe.  I've made it twice since coming across it, and it's been a hit both times.  It's definitely a keeper.  I didn't have Miracle Whip, so I used mayonnaise instead.  It's a great recipe for those nights when a grilled chicken breast and a side of slaw is perfect; quick yet delicious.

This is the best cole slaw that I have ever made!  I chopped my onion very small and what I like best about this recipe is that it is not "oniony tasting" slaw.  I used mayonnaise instead of Miracle Whip and white wine vinegar.  This is a keeper!

Soooo good!  I used a little more cabbage so I had to tweak it a bit.  Also, it was a bit too sweet for me so I used a little more vinegar to lessen that.  Will use less sugar next time.  Def a good recipe that can easily be tweaked to accommodate all cooks.

Very good as is. I too use celery seed instead of poppy seed but sparingly as it can overpower the slaw. Mayo is my choice as it gives a more of an egg flavor over salad dressing. Another slight change I make occasionally is to use a diced firm apple in place of some of the sugar. Glad to see that you didn't kill it with horseradish. Too many recipes wreck the slaw with too much of it.

I stopped eating at that chicken place with 3 letters in the name, after seeing how they mishandle their poultry, and getting sick atleast twice from it. But, I grew up on the stuff and I judge all coleslaw on the way they make it. I really miss the stuff!
Two things that I have to mention, the white onion definately adds that flavor that other slaws don't seem to have. I never would have put my finger on it, but it really makes the flavor what it is. 2nd, I have made this several times and chop the cabbage fine (only fresh, never bagged) and I can't stop the cabbage from releasing liquid and making this slaw really wet. Drain and repeat, and still wet. I may try keeping the cabbage shaved instead of fine. I have yet to find the perfect sweetness but overall the recipe is there. Goodjob on this one, it'll just take a few attempts to perfect.

Awesome cole slaw recipe!  I was so proud of myself after having made it.  Who knew that cole slaw was so easy to make?! I did cut back a bit on the sugar as other reviewers suggested - I used 1/3c. and I also added just a couple drops more of the vinegar for extra tanginess and omitted the poppy seeds.  I also used light Miracle Whip.  I was concerned if the light would make a big difference, and it didn't.  Will definitely be making this recipe again!

Best cole slaw I have ever made! I made it as written.  (The only thing I didn't have was the poppy seeds.)   I made it for our 4th of July party today, and everyone liked it.  I was a little curious to see if it was going to be too sweet reading some of the other reviews, but no one thought so.  I sent some of my friends home w/the recipe!

Excellent slaw!  I improvised slightly - since I didn't have Miracle Whip, I had to use mayonnaise.  Also, I added some golden raisins (about 2/3 cup) for added sweetness.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

If you like sweet slaws, this is delish!  The only change I made was to use reduced-fat mayo instead of Miracle Whip.

Incredible! My kids love slaw. No matter where it comes from, they will eat it. I was a cashier at the chicken place when I was in high school and the cashiers were responsible for making the slaw, among other things. 50 pounds of cabbage plus a ratio of onions and carrots that I have since forgotten.  Just a few of the outside leaves. Not too many though because that would make it more bitter.  But the dark green leaves was to make it look pretty. LOL  After the cabbage, slaw and onions went through the machine with the huge rotating blade.  After all had gone through, we poured in a gallon (or two) of the dressing that was purchased already premade.

I did like I knew and chopped the cabbage and onions by hand and sent the carrot through my salad shooter (cabbage is too wet to survive in the size that I want) and it took me back many years.  And then . . . THIS dressing looked exactly like the dressing I remember.  And after I poured it into the cabbage mixture, I KNEW I had that slaw from long ago.  Now theirs is dry and this is the moist slaw that I remember.  INCREDIBLE!!

My 6yo told me that if it tasted like the Captain fish's place, he was going to eat it all up and ask for more and more and more.  When he tasted it, he told me that it WAS better than that.  He got seconds and thirds.  My 11yo daughter kept getting spoonfuls. And the 4yo gobbled his up. They couldn't get enough.

I made this out at the lake for a fish fry pot luck. I couldn't keep my extremely picky son (12 years old) out of it. He asked me, "How can anything taste that good?" This simple recipe DEFINITELY deserves 5 stars. P.S. made it without the poppy seeds since I didn't have any, and used plain old mayo, and no diced onions so I put some minced dried onions we had in the cupboard -- definitely will do it the same way again!

Love, love, love this slaw recipe. I did take the advise of others and decreased the sugar to 1/3 cup. I didn't have poppy seeds, so I used celery seed. I was a tad leery at first because it looked dry. After being refrigerated for a couple of hours (as the recipe recommends), it was perfect. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

This is probably the best cream style slaw I have eaten.  I don't usually like the cream style but this one I have made over and over again. It is GREAT!!!

I thought this was a really good recipe and easy to make! It is a bit on the sweet side so next time I make it I will follow the other reviews and use a little less sugar.

My absolute favorite coleslaw recipe! I always get a ton of complements every time I make it. My boyfriends mother requests it for every family BBQ and keeps whatever's leftover for herself! Some suggestions I have after playing around with the recipe a bit: Only use 1/4 a cup of sugar, use real mayo instead of Miracle Whip (not a mayo vs Miracle Whip preference thing, I actually HATE mayo on my sandwiches, etc. but it just works better with coleslaw IMO!) add a little red wine vinegar (or just some red wine if you don't have red wine vinegar on hand) in addition to the white vinegar (no specific measurement, I usually just wing it. ) and chop up some green onion for extra flavor. Chill in the fridge for at least an hour and wella! Best recipe ever!

This is excellent. 
I shredded my own cabbage & carrots, I used mayo instead of salad dressing and reduced the sugar to 1/8 cup and it was sweet enough.

This was fantastic!!!!  It was definitely sweet, which I love.  I used low fat Miracle Whip and Xylitol instead of sugar to lighten it up.  I also used just 1 tablespoon of sesame oil instead of 3 tablespoons of vegetable oil.  The sesame oil tasted great!  I've never made cole slaw before, but I will now!

I joined just so I could save THIS recipe. SO good! I used real mayo instead of the miracle whip and added a splash of rice vinegar (in addition to the white vinegar the recipe calls for). 

I agree w/ the other comments - it appears dry when the veggies and wet ingredients are mixed together. But as it chills for 2 hours, it almost looks like there's a bit too much dressing.  No worries, I just use a slotted spoon and all is well.

I'm going back for another helping of this coleslaw! Enjoy...

I have spent the last three years trying different
cole slaw recipes looking for that "go to" recipe.
I finally found it!  This is it.  I did cut the sugar
down to 1/3 cup, used celery seed versus
poppy seed, added dill weed and a tad more
onion.

Great recipe.  Thank you!

OMG!!! This is sooooooo good. I didn't add the onion, salt and poppy seeds and it was still delicious.  The vinegar, mayo and sugar together are an excellent combination. It took less then five minutes to put together. I'm very happy with this recipe.

Delicious!  A tad sweet for me, but my husband loves it, so it's a keeper.  Used Helman's light mayo and Splenda to keep it low cal.  This was the best coleslaw recipe I've ever tried.  Thanks Sandi!

We liked this, but will definitely cut back on the dressing a bit next time (or use more coleslaw mix). We reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup (it was still plenty sweet) and used celery seed instead of poppy seeds.

I think if you use Miracle Whip, which already is a sweet mayonnaise, the recipe will definitely come out too sweet. I like my Cole Slaw a little sweet but this was too sweet. I had to add another  teaspoon of salt and about 1 tablespoon of lemon juice to make it enjoyable. Next time I make this recipe I will probably cut the sugar in half and use regular mayonnaise.

I am very picky when it comes to cole slaw.  This recipe is wonderful.  My husband always requests it.  The only thing I suggest is to uses real mayonnaise.  I am not a fan of miracle whip.   There were a lot of people who cut back on the sugar.  I did slightly as well.  The mixture seems dry at first mix, but it'll soften up quickly. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

I've been told by several people that this is the best coleslaw they've ever had!  I will continue to make it for family gatherings because everyone continues to ask for it!  IT's great!

WAY TOO SWEET! I even made it with mayo instead of meracle whip and did not use quite a 1/2 cup of sugar. There is no way this tastes even similar to KFC.

Love this slaw!!! The whole family loves it, even the kids.  I tweak mine a little bit- use 1/4-1/3 cup sugar, and black pepper instead of poppy seeds.  Delicious!!

I'll never buy coleslaw dressing again.  This was perfect. The only thing I did differently is substitute celery seeds for the poppy seeds (because I like it that way best).

Absolutely the best ever coleslaw recipe.  I've been looking for a good slaw recipe for years.  I took the advice of another reviewer and used apple cider vinegar instead of distilled, used mayo instead of Miracle Whip and by mistake added 1 T poppy seeds instead of 1/2 tsp.  Loved it!

other than providing a basic outline I don't think this is particularly special. I just used it as a guide to make something I had in mind. Next time I'll be sure to cut waaaay back on the sugar... ruined the whole thing. Oh well. I added salmon, replaced the vegetable oil with toasted sesame oil mmmmm and added sunflower seeds Worcestershire, dill seasoning, cayenne, salt and spike. Other than it being too sweet it was delicious.

Excellent coleslaw. Rates up there with the best I've had at any restaurant. I never have Miracle Whip in the house, so used real mayo. Used celery seed instead of poppy seeds as others suggested, as it seemed more traditional. Cut the oil to just about 1 tsp. - I couldn't see adding much, since mayo is oil based anyway. I didn't have a lot of time, so served after only an hour with fried chicken bought from the market:) Very delicious and easy dinner!

No bag coleslaw on hand, so I chopped up fresh green and red cabbage. Added carrots to teh mix. Then made the recipe exactly as it reads. It was sweet, but it was goooooood. My wife loves KFC coleslaw and really loved this dish. So much more economical!! Will make again.  NOTE: It tastes best the next day, so if you're doing this for a party, make it the day before!!

This was very delicious.  Made it for 4th of July BBQ and everyone loved it.  I used Lite Miracle Whip, doubled the onions, omitted the poppy seeds (didn't have any on hand), and added 2 ribs of diced celery.  Made it the day before and it was very flavorful by the next day.  Will make again and again.

I usually make slaw a little different every time, never measuring anything.  This simple recipe was one I followed, using my own shredded cabbage and carrot rather than the packaged mix.  It has a great balance of sweet and sour, and we all loved it.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Delish!  I was a bit worried that it would  be dry when I was mixing it; however it was just perfect after a few hours in the fridge.  I did add a little celery seed at the end, but it did not really need it.  Thanks

This is a really good recipe.  I changed the poppy seeds to celery seeds, and only used 3 tbsp of sugar.  My hubby only likes the sweet slaw, and he really loved this.  I also used rice wine vinegar.

This ia an excellent recipe! I will make this many times in the future; the only thing I will change is to cut the sugar in half; this for my own taste. The recipe, as written, is very good, I just would like a little less sweetness (imagine that)! Thank you to the "submitter" for sharing this excellent recipe, it is appreciated by me!

Good basic slaw recipe. I add a bit more vinegar than called for and a little water - otherwise it turns out too "mayonnaisey" for my tastes.  I usually use 1/2 a head of cabbage instead of the slaw mix, and this recipe makes way too much dressing for that, so I need to remember to only make half next time.

This is a family favorite. It rarely lasts longer than a day in our house. Even my 3 year old picky eater devours this slaw. I can't eat onion and didn't have poppy seeds so I omitted both. I also substitute mayo for the salad dressing and scale back the sugar by 2 Tbsp.

I tried this the way it was written and was 3 star - but when I use Hellmann's mayo instead of salad dressing - cut the sugar in half and omit the poppy seeds it becomes 5 star (IMO).  I'm not someone who cares for salad dressing and that with all the sugar made it too sweet for me.

I didn't realize I was out of onion until it was too late so I used onion powder and subbed celery seed for poppy seed--this came out really good!! I lived in the south so I'm used to the sweet slaw and it definitely rivals the slaw at some of the bbq joints I used to frequent in the past...

This was nice and easy. I used leftover broccoli stalks and a carrot shredded in the food processor for the slaw part. I also used about 2 TB sugar and that was plenty sweet for us. Loved the poppy seeds. I added celery seed at the end and I liked it better with it after.

Really good! Definitely need to let it chill for two hours to let the flavors meld and might of been a little too sweet for my own personal taste but deserves all five stars!  You can make as is or shred your own cabbage and carrots instead of using coleslaw mix.

Wow !!  Big hit !!  My mother-in-law asked for the recipe... !!!  My father-in-law said it was better than the one at his favorite restaurant.  As per reviews I cut sugar in half and replaced poppy seeds by celery seeds.  A keeper.

OMG. So delicious. I used to say that the KFC coleslaw is the best and my favorite but this beats that 10 times over. I didn't have poppy seeds so didn't use them. I substituted 3 tbs of Splenda ( = 3 tbs of sugar). SO GOOD!

Very tasty and easy. Added a little chopped garlic, two dashes of Hot Sauce, and two table spoons of sour cream to make it a little creamier. I used half the sugar called for and still tasted great. I won't buy the store bought coleslaw again!

This was pretty good, but a little too heavy for me.  I cut down on the sugar, added lots of pepper, about a teaspoon of grainy mustard and omitted the onion and poppy seeds because I didn't have either of them.  Over all this has a really good flavor and I will make again.  Next time I'll use more vinegar and cut down on the Miracle Whip.  Thank you!!

Very very good! Used half mayo and half miracle whip.  Used less than half cup of sugar and it was  perfect.  Used a little celery seed instead of poppy seed.  It was Very dry looking when I mixed it up but after about 15 min in fridge it was like magic as it got more creamy as it sat!

WOW!  So easy and so good!  I doubled the recipe, used regular mayo, and added an additional Tbsp of vinegar and it was GREAT.  I'd recommend chilling this for at least 4 hours, so the cabbage gets soft enough and the flavors blend.  I tried another "restaurant style" coleslaw recipe from this site, and this one far exceeded it.  YUM!

Fantastic Recipe! You can adjust it to your taste. I used powdered onion, sour cream instead of oil, less sugar and more vinegar.  I prefer the KFC version and this one is very close! My husband makes the best brisket and this goes great with it!

I made a double batch of this to serve to a group of men at my husbands work.  Everyone raved about how good it was.  Just like the other viewers commented; it tastes like the slaw at a certain fast food chicken place - but better!  I'll be making this again!  Thank you for the excellent recipe!

Wonderful! Yes, a bit sweet, but I'm not a vinegar fan, so it's a great recipe. I think I will put in a bit less Miracle Whip next time, as my coleslaw bag was only 14 oz instead of 16oz and it made it soupy. I did use celery seed, which I love, to substitute poppy seed, which I hate.

I dont like to rate a recipe when I didnt follow it exactly but I cant not rate this! Just because I hope someone with my taste takes the time to read the reviews and stumbles upon mine. And I know people with a taste opposite of mine love this recipe as it is written. All I did was substitute mayonaise for the miracle whip. And it was really sweet but a tad not tangy enough for my taste. Also I didnt have bagged coleslaw mix so I used half a cabbage and shredded a big carrot, and used a bit more onion because hubby loves it. This was just delicious the way I made it! Actually reminds me more of the salad dressing they use at teriyaki joints. I always have loved that dressing but couldn't find it anywhere for a long time.  This wasn't tangy enough to taste to me like coleslaw usually does. None the less, I love this so much! And I made this last minute while waiting for ribs to be done and refrigirated the coleslaw for about 5 minutes and it was great! The sugar melted and some liquid came out. Amazing! And I dont say that unless it is absolutely great. Try it! If you like sweet, sub mayo for the miracle whip, if you like it super super sweet, follow the recipe to the T.

This was very good.  I cut the sugar in half as suggested by other posters (used Splenda) and cut the oil to 1 T.  Excellent taste and still on the sweet side.  Will probably cut the sugar down a little more next time.  Will definitely make again.

Cole Slaw usually improves as it sits and marinates.  This one did not.  It got VERY watery.  It was also way too sweet for my taste. I will not make this one again.  I will keep looking for a better recipe.

I made this an hour before I served it, and thought it actually might need more dressing. When I took it out to serve it, there was too much dressing, so that people trying to eat the last of it were literally "fishing" the cabbage out of it. Next time I'll add another 4 to 8 ounces of cabbage. But, the flavor was perfect and everyone loved it!

I read the comments about this recipe being a bit too sweet. However, I like to make the original recipe first. It was so sweet I chucked it and started over using a quarter of the sugar. Half the sugar that this recipe calls for does the trick; that is if you like it a bit sweet. If not, use even less sugar and add to taste. After remaking it using only a quarter of the sugar and a fresh coleslaw mix instead of store bought, it was excellent. However, if you like nearly half a spoon full of sugar in every bite stick to the original recipe.

Oh my God AMAZING!  I made this coleslaw the night before and let it sit in the refrigerator and it tastes soo much better the next day!  The only change I made was cutting down on the amount of sugar, I used 1/3 cup and that was plenty.  I will continue making this recipe again and again.

This slaw was excellent. I agree with most of the other reviews, cut the sugar in 1/2. Mine was plenty sweet using only 1/2 the sugar. I used celery seed because thats what i had. I will use poppy seeds next time. I saw in the reviews that many people were using mayo instead of the Miracle Whip. I think that would take away from this slaw. GOOD STUFF

Fantastic recipe; better the next day after things have marinated. Feel free to add a bit more cabbage since there's an abundance of sauce. We made using fresh red & green cabbage and carrots. Definite make again!

This is the best coleslaw!!!!! I did make a small change however. I use apple cider vinegar instead of the white. It adds a bit more twang. I make this once a week! We love this slaw. I always get requests for the recipe. Thanks for sharing this! I have looked and looked and looked, then I came across this one, look no further!! This is a keeper!

This was easy to make and everyone loved it!  I think next time I will make the dressing the night before and toss it all a couple of hours beforehand.  When I was looking for the bag of packaged coleslaw I found a bag of shredded brocolli and I added a little of that and it gave it a really good crunch.

We love this slaw!  Every time I have made it, I've tried a different vinegar--this time with rice vinegar.  I always go short on the mayo and way short on the sugar.  Very tasty dish!  Thanks, Sandi Johnson!

this is REALLY good.  i used half low-fat miracle whip/half real mayo.  i cut the oil in half (it is a bit soupy) and would recommend less sugar, if you want to go healthier.    i also replaced the poppy seeds with celery seeds, b/c that's what i had.

This is a great slaw recipe.  Both my hubby and my dad loved it!  I used a bag of shredded cabbage and a bag of broccoli slaw from Trader Joe's and gave it a couple of pulses in my food processor because we like the "chopped" slaw.  I had to make a double batch of the sauce but didn't use all of it.  It was fabulous!  My dad even asked for the recipe.  Definitely will be making this any time we have a BBQ!

I really love coleslaws at restaurants and I made this for a regular day and it was good..but thought I could've used a little less sugar because it ended up being a bit too sweet. It did taste better though after it got creamier. I added about a tbsp more of vinegar and more mayo. This lasted a few days until we had a mini bbq and it tasted better with the meat! I will be making this again but with a little less sugar!

Great cole slaw!  I had a very firm cabbage that I shredded then added a large shredded carrot instead of the bagged stuff.  I think I had more cabbage than is in the bag, but that was OK because we don't like goopy slaw.  I used light Miracle Whip and Splenda.  I also increased the vinegar to 3 T.  It was a little bit sweet for me but my husband said it was the best he's ever eaten.  This is my new cole slaw recipe!

I'd never made coleslaw before making this, but have had enough at restaurants to know if this was good or not.  It isn't good.  It's freaking AWESOME!  My picky family hesitantly tried it and raved about it, and my British mum said it was even better than from any fish & chip shop.  Only modification I made was omission of poppy seeds (had none) and used mayo.  THIS COLESLAW IS EVEN BETTER IF IT CHILLS OVERNIGHT!!  Enjoy!  I will be making this many, many more times!  Thanks for such a great recipe!

OMG - YUM!  This is JUST like Kentucky Fried Chicken coleslaw.  I will never buy coleslaw from our grocery store deli again - because this recipe is SIMPLE to make and phenomenal in taste!  The ONLY modifications I made is to the split the 2/3 C. of creamy salad dressing with half Mayo and half Salad Dressing (Miracle Whip), and added 1/2 tsp. of celery seed, in addition to the poppy seed it called for.  Oh, also I only used 1/4 C. of sugar - figured I could add more later - but I didn't need too - 1/4 C. was MORE than enough. Just right!!!  Unless you like super sweet cole slaw, I recommend cutting down the sugar!  Well worth time/effort and great for any occassion!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Delicious!! Even my picky 5yo loved it! I chop the onions up very finely so nobody knows they're in there :-)

My family really liked this, and they are not big coleslaw fans.  I substituted 1/2 the sugar with Splenda, and it was fine.  Also, I added a lot of celery seed (1 T) instead of poppy.

I used a whole cabbage, which is cheaper, and I was tempted to just slice it thinly, but I grated it instead, and it went over better.  I don't know why - it's the same thing.  Go figure.

This is the best!  I have now made it twice.  I must say that I don't change anything.  But, keep in mind to read the directions...I didn't the 2nd time and didn't mix the sugar, vinegar & oil seperately.  It still turned out well!  Also, you don't have to refigerate for the amount of time listed.  The first time it only "marinated" about an hour and still delicious!

I used someone else's suggestion and used rice vinegar and low fat mayo.  I mixed the full about of dressing, but only added about 1/3 of it.  We don't like our slaw drenched.  It was very good.  Needed some salt and pepper, but that was easy enough to add at the end.  I let it sit about 2 hours.  Maybe it will be even better tomorrow.  Update:  Only made 1/2 of the dressing this time.  More than enough.  Everyone raved about this recipe.  I did cut the sugar in half and didn't use poppy seeds.  I added some pepper.

This is just "perfect" slaw -- sweet and creamy with a little tang.  I wilted the slaw mix first so I didn't have a puddle in the bottom of the bowl.  To wilt, place slaw in colander, and mix with 2 tsp salt.  Let stand 2-4 hours until it releases most of its water.  It will look horrible -- almost like cooked cabbage.  Rinse well, spin, and pat dry.  Continue with recipe as written.

This is the best coleslaw I've ever had!  Really delicious!  I only used 1/3 cup sugar, and you could probably use even less, depending on how sweet you like it.  I will never buy coleslaw from the deli again!

We LOVED this slaw!  I had tried the recipe off the Secret Recipes site and this one is much better, although I'll add just a tad bit more onion.  Extremely easy to throw together and had everything on hand, except the poppy seed (used celery seed instead).  Thanks!

I didn't buy coleslaw mix, I just used shredded cabbage and carrots.  My husband normally DETESTS coleslaw so I only make it once a year.  He added a bit of hot sauce to his portion and I couldn't believe that he had 2 portions and said "your coleslaw is actually pretty good"!  That makes it a winner for me.

This slaw was so easy and so good.  I made it the night before so it could marinate a bit.  I didn't have poppy seeds, but I think those are just for looks anyway.  Next time I might add a bit of sweet pickle just because I like it in my slaw.

I made this over the 4th of July.  The grocery store was out of bagged coleslaw mix, so I substituted shredded lettuce and red cabbage in the amounts called for.  One  thing I should have added and forgot would have been some shredded carrots.  Overall this recipe was great - the only thing I would change next time would be to halve the amount of suger - it was just a little too sweet for me.  Otherwise delicious!  Much better than the decorative diner slaw. :)

Huge hit at a July 4th BBQ.  Next time I will double the recipe as it settles quite a bit after mixing and chilling.  Seemd to appeal to everyone.  People kept asking, "Who made the cole slaw?  It's delicious!"  I told them to check out All Recipes!  This will be my cole slaw recipe from now on.

I cringed when our guests said, "OH, cole slaw....we usually don't like that." Being the polite guests they were, however, they both took small portions and resigned themselves to trying it. It wasn't long before they were up to get more. This was an INCREDIBLY easy recipe that made me wonder if it could really be THAT easy and THAT good. This side will become a staple in my household. My husband ate some leftover slaw for dessert tonight....need I say more?

This is fantastic! My family and friends, like me, enjoyed the just sweet enough creamy slaw at a large cookout that we had at our home. I used mayo instead and left out the poppy seeds. It was good before chilling but I made the night before and it was even creamier! So good, I can't wait to make more. This is definitely the slaw recipe for me! Thanks and Happy Cooking. :)

This looks very good; however I'm looking for a recipe that is like the KFC cole slaw -- I love KFC's slaw and would love to make it.  Tastes like it has some horseradish in it, but I'm not sure.  Any one know of a slaw recipe similar to KFC's?

I thought this turned out great!  I did cut the sugar to 1/3c and it seemed like a perfect balance.  I did make a mistake and initially forgot the oil,and i thought it seemed a little dry so I added a little more mayo.  When I got back to my computer and saw the recipe, I realized I had forgot the oil and ran and added it.  So it did turn out a little mushy but I obviously didn't take away points for my silly mistake! Flavour was really great : )

I guess I expected it to taste somewhat like KFC or T. Marzetti's and it didn't.  It was OK, probably won't make it again.

I prefer a creamy cole slaw, so this was perfect. It had a nice sweetness. The only change I made to the recipe was leaving out the onions because my husband doesn't like raw onions.

This was really easy to make but a little too sweet.  Go easy on the sugar.

I'm not much of a slaw fan but this was pretty good.  Had it with some grilled/roast chicken and it was a tasty combo. Can't wait to make it again.

Made the dressing as listed minus the poppy seeds. Excellent! Made the dressing the night before and mixed with the slaw the morning of the party which worked great. But leftovers were even better, I should have mixed it all the night before!

I doubled this recipe to bring to a cookout for Father's Day and I added more poppy seeds for flavor and color in addition to a little cayenne pepper for the slightest kick but without making it spicy.  This was an absolute hit!  There was nothing left in the bowl and I received mutiple compliments on it.  I kept overhearing people ask who made the coleslaw!!  Very delicious, I will use this recipe from now on- Thank you!!

Good. I added some purple cabbage to this and used poppy seed dressing instead of the mayo/dressing and poppy seeds. I also used balsamic vinegar. Most of family are not fans of coleslaw and this was a big hit for our family.

Yay, Sandy!  Thanks so much!  I only used 1 T oil and left out the onion and & used mayo instead of salad dressing and this slaw was perfection .  I also happened to use rice vinegar, but that's just because I like it so much.  I let it sit in the fridge for about 3 hours and it was great, no gritty sugar or watery sauce.  I served this with Mushroom Blue Cheese Turkey Burgers and Tea Biscuits (both from this site) and sliced tomatoes.  Perfect meal!

FANTASTIC!  I'm usually not a coleslaw fan, but my husband and toddler love it; so I thought I'd give this a try.  I chopped my own head of cabbage, with 3 carrots, in the food processor.  I opted for onion powder, rather than fresh, and it all came together so nicely!  I also used celery seed, instead of poppy, because I didn't have the poppy.  The dressing is so good, I even loved this, and I normally don't touch the stuff.  Of course, my husband and toddler gobbled it up as well.  Thanks so much... I will make again and again.

Delicious, easy, loved it.  Served with rolls and the "BBQ Pork for Sandwiches" recipe from this site and had a great make-ahead meal for company trickling into town one evening.  Everyone could just serve themselves as they pleased.

Yummy!!!  I just made this to go with our  BBQ pulled pork sandwiches tonight, I can't wait to taste it but after trying the dressing I can tell it will be even better after a few hours.  Hopefully hubby likes it as well.  Thanks for sharing!!!

This slaw is awesome!  I was skeptical the first day I made it because it tasted a lot like miracle whip, but the following day it was awesome!  We ate it with the Slow Cooker Barbecue(which is also on this site) and it was like we went to a restaurant!  Thanks for the great recipe, I'll be making this again!

I am giving this 5 stars, even though I used reviewers' suggestion to add only 1/3 c. sugar.  I have been making slaw for 34 years and have never been quite satisfied with it, even after trying other recipes and suggestions.  This is very good and very simple, and this is the recipe I will use from now on!  Thanks for sharing your recipe, Sandi!

I used 1 head of cabbage abd 1 carrot, heeded the advice of other users and decreased sugar by half.  I also added a bit more vinegar and used half olive oil.  Family devoured, I will definitely make again.  Thanks!

This was really good (even when I doubled the recipe).  I followed a few recommendations from some reviewers before me by adding more onions and using celery seeds.  I'd definitely make this again with barbeque!!

When I first made this I thought it was not going to work out well, then I let it sit in the fridge overnight. The next day at dinner this was fantastic. The only thing I did different was I had no onion. My husband loved this.

This is the coleslaw I will be making from now on!  I didn't have time to let chill the 2 hrs., but it was still fantastic!  I cut back on the oil 1 Tbsp., and used canola oil instead of veg. oil. I will cut it out all together next time, just to see if it really changes the taste or texture.

YUM YUM!! This was so good. A little on the sweet side but that's the way I like it! I used green onion and left out the poppy seeds. I might need to plan a cookout just so I can make this again!

I am super picky when it comes to cole slaw, but this recipe seemed to be what I was looking for.  I was soooo right!!  This recipe is awesome and I will be using it often.  The only minor change I made was to use Light Kraft Mayo.

I give this four stars, because it's too sweet for my taste.  I will cut the sugar next time.  However, it's one of the best cole slaw recipes I've used.  I added some Texas Pete's sauce, black pepper, and a little Old Bay seasoning.

I made this for our Family Day and it was a hit!  I substituted celery seed for poppy seed, but I made the dressing (including the onions) several hours prior and refrigerated it for the flavors to blend.  Then right before serving I mixed the dressing in with the slaw vegetables and it was creamy for serving.

Substituted real mayo for the dressing and celery salt for the poppy seeds.  Left out the oil too.  Tasted great!

I have to agree with the majority of folks who advocate for less sugar. Other than that this was a fantastic easy tasty recipe. Looking forward to this one years from now. Hope you enjoy!

This is easily my favorite coleslaw recipe. I use real mayonnaise, but a bit less than what the recipe calls for. I also use about 1/2 the amount of sugar.

I like this recipe, but it is a bit too sweet.  I will cut the sugar in half next time.  I ended adding more vinegar.  I love the fact that there is onion in it.

This was excellent!  I used Stevia in the Raw to sweeten just to save some calories.  Next time I'll try fat free miracle whip too.

This is my first Time making coleslaw. I had a bag of cabbage left over from another recipe so I thought I'd try it. It is really good. It's better than most of the course as you get in a restaurant. I didn't have poppyseeds so I used celery seed. Also, are used Hellmann's instead of miracle whip.

This is delicious. I like to sprinkle the sugar and vinegar over the cabbage and veg and let it sit for an hour before adding the mayo etc  The salad will stay creamy longer before it separates.

This is the most delicious cole slaw ever !!!  The only change I make in it is that I put the cole slaw cabbage mix in my food processor and pulse it a couple of times before mixing in the dressing as I like cole slaw chopped a little finer.  This recipe is AAAAA plus !!!!  I challenge anyone to come up with a better one  !!

Yes it is a sweet slaw unlike the one made with vinegar and oil. Easy as  can be. I used miracle whip and that is also sweet, perhaps just mayo and sugar would have done the trick. My old recipe is made with mayo, milk and sugar. Instead of poppy seeds I used celery seed with my own recipe. This was worth the try because it sure is an easy recipe.

I make this all the time and have been for years. It's the only slaw recipe I need. It's awesome for pulled pork sandwiches and goes great with any BBQ.

Having made this dozens of times I can safely say a few things: 

The sugar should be adjusted for your own tastes and I feel like it makes way too much dressing for 1 bag of coleslaw so I always cut back the ingredients or add more slaw. 

Also after sitting in the fridge for a few hours it will accumulate a fair amount of water at the bottom of the container. This isn't a problem with the dressing being runny, but the salt in the ingredients pulling the water out of the cabbage. I always mix it up with the liquid and discreetly pour out the excess before serving or it's just going to be super runny when someone puts it on their plate.

Everyone loved this recipe the first and second time. I made the recipe as is the first time and it was a little too sweet. The second time I cut back on the sugar and it was perfect. I couldn't find the regular coleslaw mix and used broccoli slaw and it was still delicious! Will be making this again for a party coming up soon.

I am a little bit of a coleslaw snob but I am always looking for something different or new. This is by far my favorite slaw recipe. I used apple cider vinegar instead of white and added 2 extra tablespoons. I also used extra virgin olive oil instead of regular vegetable oil. I like onion so I doubled the onion. Instead poppy seeds I used dill. I also added 2 tablespoons of lemon juice which I always do to my slaw recipes. It cuts the sweetness a little and made it just perfect for us. This is a recipe I will use from now on.

Even though the recipe states 'sweet' slaw, this had far too much sugar and I did my own altering after tasting to fix it. However, what I absolutely loved in it was the onion and poppy seeds. I used red onion and was just right. Those two ingredients were a very nice touch and worthy of a repeat performance.

I have NEVER made or tasted Cole slaw. It never looked like something I wanted to eat. Yesterday I decided I would like to give it a try. So today I made it. Well am I glad I choose this delicious recipe. I can't stop giving it a taste. Hope I don't eat it all before dinner. I followed the recipe exactly to the "T". I will be making this wonderful recipe often now. Just delicious! Thank you for sharing you recipe.

This is a very good recipe, no need for all that sugar. Two tablespoons sugar is more than enough. I did skip the poppy seeds. Everyone thought it was excellent.

I've now made this over and over ... it's a requested staple for every holiday or occassion. (My dad had me add small chopped marshmellows and crushed pineapple for a variation he had when he was a kid -- that version is much loved too.) THANK you for this great recipe. That's why I use allrecipes.com and have for many years .... (PS--the liquid can get runny after the slaw sits on the table a bit; recommend slightly reducing to avoid this.)

I love cole slaw, but have never made it. My issue with store bought is that, while I love the taste of several, I usually avoid the sugar that they add. So I made this recipe with Splenda instead of white sugar. Also I don't have any poppy seeds. Tried it right after I made it and thought "good". Then left it in fridge for a couple hours. It softened and dropped about 50 percent of it's volume. Tasted it and proceeded to eat the whole batch. Easy and super good, Splenda worked great.

I've been using this recipe since it was originally posted. My family loves it. I exclude the onion because of allergies. It is supposed to be a sweet slaw, but I add an extra tsp of mayo, an extra 1/2 tsp of vinegar,  and leave out about 2 Tbsp of sugar. I love it.

I am not a fan of slaw, but my husband is. He said it was as good if not better than the slaw at his favorite BBQ place. Based on the reviews, I did cut back on the sugar and I used mayo.

Great recipe but much too sweet. tried 1/4  cup at first and my daughter commented on it being too sweet. Next time I tried 3 Tablespoons and still a bit sweet. 2 tablespoons would probably be best.

This recipe is very good, but needs a bit of tweaking.  1/2 cup of sugar is a LOT!  I used maybe 1/5 cup and it was plenty, enough to add sweetness but not to overwhelm other flavors.  also recommend maybe 1/2 - 1 tspn of ground black pepper and 1 tspn of garlic powder.  Balances off the sugar nicely.

Great basic, but try adding a carrot or two for color and substitute the poppy seeds for celery seeds to add extra flavor (but if you do use only a quarter of the amount).

Instead of Miracle Whip, I used real mayo and added dashes of cayenne pepper and black pepper, and I omitted the oil.

Also, making it with half sugar, half granular Splenda doesn't hurt the flavor a bit.

I haven't taken the time rate or review a recipe in a long time; however, this recipe is worth reviewing.  It is seriously amazing!  Earlier this summer, I had to prepare a few meals for a group of 300+.  This was by far one of the items everyone ranted and raved about.  I didn't change a thing, (although the dressing goes a long way.  So if you are making a large amount of coleslaw, I recommend only adding some of it, mixing it with the cabbage, and then adding more as needed.)  I also suggest adding more actually coleslaw mix to the dressing.  Once the dressing is poured on, the coleslaw mix shrinks down quite a bit.  The dressing itself is perfect!  The only thing I have ever left out is the poppy seeds, simply because I forgot to buy them.  It was delicious just the same.  I have used the slaw on barbecue pulled pork sandwiches (like at Cafe Zupa's.)  I have also used it just as a side.  The only tip I would give is that when I serve it just as a side, I love to have bacon cooked and chopped, as well as peanuts chopped (if no one is allergic), and set on the side for people to top their slaw with if they want.  Divine!  Thank you so much for this recipe!!!!

I must agree with others that the dressing was a bit too sweet. I used an olive oil based mayonnaise with black pepper in place of the "creamy salad dressing." I think next time I will reduce the sugar and half the dressing or double the cabbage.

I hate coleslaw. Bleh! Nasty! I love this?! What?! MY family loves this. I tweak nothing. I first made it as an extra side at a gathering. Cheap and easily acceptable side dish to any pot luck. I tasted it due to morbid curiosity. So Good! I will be happy to serve this to anyone at a party without Irritable bowel syndrome.

I would have to say this is the best coleslaw I have ever had. Instead of chopping up an onion, I just put onion flakes in the sauce and it was great!

This is fantastic and oh so easy.  Will make this all the time.  OMG, it is sooo good.  Would give it 10 stars if I could.  I made it the way it says to except the poppy seds since I didn't have any.

I thought the dressing was way too sweet! Sugar probably could have been cut back by half! I added lemon juice, more vinegar and salt to try to tone down the sweetness.

I used mostly mayo instead of miracle whip and only put half on and then after a couple hours drained it and added the rest of the sauce. Pretty tasty!

I make mine with about 1 1/2 T sugar. I add celery seeds - makes all the difference! I don't use oil, I add about a T of milk to thin the mayo, and red onion. Very quick and simple.

It is very sweet, but very good.  Not sure if I would make it less sweet because it would defeat the recipe.

Excellent slaw recipe.  Quick, easy and delicious. The only change I made was to replace the poppy seed. I didn't have the poppy seed & am not a fan of celery seed but wanted the crunch, so I threw a handful of roasted sunflower kernels in with the slaw/onion mix. Restaurant quality slaw. It will be my go-to recipe from now on.  Thank you for this gem.

I used the 16 oz bag but used celery seed instead of poppy seeds.
Basically when I put this together it tasted just like miracle whip. It did not taste like slaw. That was yucky. I had to add  bunch more vinegar and oil and then a little more sugar. Then it tasted like slaw should. It got juicier over night. The miracle whip is way too much for this recipe. As for sugar how much you want will vary per person and needs to be adjusted when cooking or preparing. I like mine sweet. Ill rate it as OK because it seemed to work for so many people and it was great after I diluted the salad dressing with vinegar and oil.

My husband loves this!!!  He says it tastes just like the KFC coleslaw.  I don't like coleslaw normally, but even I can eat it.  It's a very easy recipe to make.  I used celery seed instead of poppy seed, since that is what I had on hand.

Really like this recipe. Super easy and was exactly what I was looking for. I agree w lessening the amt of sugar-you can add more later if you want. Give it a little time and it will be much creamier.

Very close to KFC coleslaw. will cut back a little on the Miracle Whip next time as it was a little much once it sat for awhile. Very good recipe though.

I just made this for the third time in the past few weeks. My family loves it, and they are picky! Two of us are diabetics, so I substituted Splenda for the sugar. I also used rice vinegar and red onion. I used mayo for the dressing and did not add oil. This coleslaw recipe is a keeper! Thanks.

This recipe is okay. It's definitely not the best I've eaten but not the worst either. I bought a bag of ready cole slaw mix, maybe that was the problem. I will be making this again with a homemade cabbage mix instead of store bought.

I am on a diet and can't eat store bought coleslaw anymore.  So I started looking for one I could easily convert to a lower calorie version and found this one.  I simply substituted Miracle Whip lite for regular, granulated Splenda for sugar, and 2 Tbs of sour cream and 2 Tbs of vinegar for the oil and vinegar combination above.  By my rough calculations it cut calories from 1250 calories for the entire batch down to about 380 calories for my light version!  It still tasted great, better than 50-75% of restaurant store bought full calorie kind.  The only change is I may try to knock out a little of the Miracle Whip as there is a lot of coating on mine because I didn't check until later but my cole slaw mix was only 14 ounces.

This is a wonderful recipe for coleslaw. It's easy to make and was a great compliment to bbq pulled pork. I did make one adjustment to cut down on the sweetness. Used only a 1/4 of sugar and it was still fabulous.

The taste of this was exceptional.  I did find that for my BBQ sandwich I needed to add a little more cabbage and a little less of the dressing.  I did not want my sandwich to get that wet.  As a side dish it is perfect.  This will be my recipe for coleslaw from this point forward.

Excellent recipe with some modifications. Use celery seed instead of poppy seed, cut the oil by half and the sugar by a quarter, and use a flavored vinegar like pomegranate to add extra depth of flavor. I've brought this to many cookouts and there is NEVER any left!

I make this recipe all the time. The only thing I do differently is use Mayonnaise instead of Miracle Whip and add Nature Seasoning and Pepper to taste. Every time I make it a least someone asks me for the recipe and can't believe how easy it is to make!

Oh my goodness...this is so much better than any store bought slaw. I made it with cabbage I bought at the farmer market and sour cream in place of the oil. It held up well in the refig for a few days.

This is a great recipe that was easily made vegan by using vegan mayonnaise. When I make it, I use about half the sugar and leave out the onions. Highly recommended!

Great recipe.  This is the coleslaw that I grew up eating every summer in northern Wisconsin.  I substituted 1/4 cup sugar, 1tbsp of olive oil, and 1/4tsp of celery salt.  It was perfect.  Thanks for listing this great recipe.

Oh my dear God!  This is to die for!  I made it yesterday for a 4th of July party today, but I keep eating it and am not going to have enough for the party today..it's THAT good!  I used Hellmann's mayo, reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup, didn't use poppy seeds because i don't have them, and i put some black pepper on.  I could see how 1/2 cup sugar would be waaayyy too sweet.  I will make this over and over.  I can't wait to try it on pulled pork....will be amazing!  Thanks for sharing :)

Okay...yum.  I rarely rate recipes, and to do so now for, of all things, cole slaw?  Mostly, cole slaw is just there, like a dish of white rice, or a bowl of oatmeal.  But THIS cole slaw was really, really good.  I sliced my own cabbage, and found that doubling the dressing recipe was the perfect amount for one entire head of cabbage.   Do yourself a favor: halve the sugar then taste it.  You can always add the other half of the sugar if it's not sweet enough for you, but I found that is was perfect with half the sugar, couldn't imagine it any sweeter, and I like it sweet.

I modified the recipe as to some of the review suggestions. I used good mayo and omitted the oil, and cut back on the sugar by about 1/4 less of what was called out.I also used the celery seed, as advised in other reviews. I was taking mine to a picnic where there was going to be pulled pork sandwiches, so I added 1 teaspoon of cayenne pepper to kick it up a notch. I assume people will put the slaw on their sandwich. I also should have taken the advice in one of the reviews stating to only add half the sauce at first, then drain off water after about an hour in fridge. I will use a slotted spoon to serve because of the water build up. I also added more shredded carrot and red cabbage to the pre-mix I bought at supermarket. It looked a bit too dry when I first added the ingredients, but I guess the vinegar did it's magic. It cured very nicely. I gave it four stars because of the over sugared original recipe. I think my tweaks came out better.

I decided to try this for a cookout a few days ago, and it was a big hit. However I made a few modifications to the recipe. Instead of using 1/2 cup of sugar, I cut it down to 1/3 of a cup which was definitely sweet enough. I also omitted the onions (just used a pinch of onion powder), and added a little pepper. It was really easy to make.

Excellent - very easy to make!  I was really stunned.  We thought it was good enough to eat right after it was made.  We refrigerated it overnight and the next day it seemed a little soupy but it still tasted great - even better.  The amount of sauce is easy to adjust to your own liking.

Omitted poppy seeds and used light mayo instead of miracle whip. Turned out awesome! Seemed like it might be too dry at first but I had made it a day ahead of time and it was perfect and creamy in a few hours.

I would also give 4 1/2 stars...really good, but I just need find a little something to make it a 5.  It is sweet, but we like sweet!  I used mayo instead of mw per other reviews and added some broc slaw to the cole slaw which gave it a slightly heartier texture.  I did everything else as directed. Served with Slow Cooker Baby Back Ribs. Will keep in the books!!!  Thinking about throwing in some cilantro next time.  Call me crazy.

Let me just say...I don't even like slaw. BUT...so many people do and this was the perfect and easy side for a small gathering I was having. I tasted it and loved it! I prepared the slaw the evening before, so it chilled for a good 17 hours before serving. I found fresh slaw mix at Central Market (not bagged). I used Mayo instead of Miracle Whip since so many reviewers said it was "too sweet". Other than omitting the onions (not a fan of uncooked onions), I followed the recipe as written.  I was shocked when I peeled off the foil to discover the slaw had reduced down to about a third of it's original height! That's probably normal, but having never prepared it, I was not expecting that at all. There were 9 of us (all female), and other than a taste, I didn't serve myself any because I was worried there wouldn't be enough. For that reason, I would say this recipe serves 6 and not 8.  Anyway...I and my non-slaw loving partner REALLY liked this slaw! Not too mayo-y...fresh tasting and perfect flavor for our tastes.  My guests loved it and there was nothing left. I'll be making this easy and tasty recipe again.

I believe this is the best cole slaw recipe I have ever had.  Everytime I make it for guests they all rave about it.  I usually use fresh cabbage or the cabbage from my husband's garden. If you make the amount of dressing in the recipe, you normally do not need to use it all for the 16 oz. of cabbage.

I've used this recipe several times. After the first recipe, I lost the link, so when I found this one, which was close to the original I had used at first, I improvised somewhat by adding 1/8 teaspoon each of garlic powder, and onion salt. Also I doubled the vinegar (2 tablespoons) to balance out the sweetness of the sugar. Onions are another personal choice on measurements. Normally I grate my own cabbage. Not having a scale (next purchase), I put approx., 8 cups of grated cabbage, add the grated carrot, and then add dressing to taste (normally the full recipe). If you want to grate the entire cabbage but not make it all at once, the cabbage will store in a baggie for a few days. Then you can start all over with the dressing.

Miracle Whip is not for the faint of heart. Ergh. I made it with mayo, and what's with the poppy seeds?  Those are celery seed you find in restaurant coleslaw. So that went in instead of the poppy.

Good, very sweet basic recipe.  Tweak it as you like.  Besides the above two changes, I also added yellow mustard [for tang] and brought the sugar down.
 
4 stars for taking the time to share and for the basics. I star off for the use of poppy seed.

This is the best coleslaw! I agree to use a little less sugar. I made this for a group of 150 and it was a huge hit!

So good on roast beef sandwiches! Makes a lot of dressing, so next time I will either cut it down or use more cabbage. My husband went crazy over this!

Amazing!!  I hate cole slaw but this recipe makes me want to eat it everyday!  I used regular mayo, less sugar and celery seeds instead of poppy.  I will be making this again and again.

I made this to pair with bbq pork sandwiches for a camping-style family reunion and it was AMAZING! I was taking a huge chance with a group-level experiment, but those who don't normally like slaw said it was really good. And my mother-in-law said it was the best slaw she'd had. Which is pretty much the only nice thing she said to anyone all week... ;)

Yum!  This recipe is SO GOOD!  I've done it with & without the onion, with white onion as well as red, with a bit less sugar and it's good every time.  It does indeed taste like sweet restaurant coleslaw and is my new go-to recipe for coleslaw.

I really like this cole slaw recipe.  For me, it's perfect when I double the amount of slaw mix. I don't like it heavy with dressing, and there is stil a lot of flavor.  I always use mayo, either olive oil or light. Its awesome with some baked beans and barbecue!

Quick, easy and so delicious. Didn't change a single thing. Been meaning to make my own coleslaw for years and wishing I had my moms recipe. Definitely make it ahead and stated so that everything can blend and soak in. I think my son and I could eat this in one sitting.

I've been making this recipe for awhile now, but I had guests today  that hate sugary salads. I served with pulled pork from this site with some changes:
For one bag of coleslaw I used 1/2 C mayo, 1 tb sour cream, 2 tb sugar, 1 tb rice vinegar, 1/4 ts salt, 1/2 ts poppy seeds and 1/8 ts black pepper.
WONDERFUL!

AWESOME, made this for a family picnic for labor day. everyone raved about it. If I could give this 10 stars I would, it has the best blend of sweet and sour taste to it and a very creamy texture. 
Great slaw. Thanks for sharing.

I think this is the best slaw I have ever had. Everyone always loves it. I use light miracle whip and cut down on the oil some. I also omit the poppy seeds since I don't have them. Also good with splenda. Definitely let it sit a few hours.

This is the best slaw I have ever made, which means it's probably the best slaw I've ever eaten.  I did make a few changes, however.  I used rice vinegar in place of the white vinegar, I reduced the sugar just a bit, though next time I will use the full 1/2 cup.  I also used fresh cabbage, and next time I will add shredded carrots.  Oh, and I used mayo instead of miracle whip, because I am in the camp that believes miracle whip is from the devil.  

Thank you so much for a delicious recipe!  This one will go into my real recipe box.

With over a thousand reviews, this recipe doesn't really need mine, but I can't help myself. It's just that good. This IS my new slaw dressing. This is the first dressing I've ever made or had in a restaurant that held up beyond a day. As a matter of fact, it might have been even better the second day and was still quite edible the third. I suppose it comes from having so little vinegar. Only adjustment I'll make in the future is to add more cabbage. Perhaps my 16 ounces wasn't actually 16 ounces, but it was swimming in a sea of dressing, and I prefer my cabbage to be lightly covered.

I've made this recipe several times and each time it comes out great. My husband swears he doesn't like slaw, but he always enjoys this one! Make sure to not over-dress your slaw because it will
Become too soggy/watery and isn't as enjoyable that way!

Excellent!  I usually use store bought coleslaw dressing but it was expired, so I looked this up and used what I had on hand (miracle whip, apple cider vinegar instead of white, red pepper dipping oil instead of vegetable oil, equal instead of sugar, no poppy seeds, no onions) and it was superb!

This one's a winner - everyone loved it. I doubled the recipe for a cookout and it was a hit. It was on the sweet side but I think that makes it extra tasty. I'm making this again over the weekend, for sure.

Great, classic recipe.  I am vegan, so used non-egg mayo.  Cut sugar to 1/3 cup, added 1 cup raisins, and 1/2 cup almonds.  Perfect!

This recipe would be 5 stars if the amount of sugar were reduced to 1/3 cup, and real mayo used instead of salad dressing.  It would not be runny if prepared this way.  A little more salt and the addition of pepper would also help the flavor.  I do not care for poppy seeds, so do not include them.

This was very good! Only negative was that the dressing seemed sparse when first mixed into the shredded cabbage & carrots but after chilling a few hours became very soupy/runny. It ran all over the plate when dished up, which some people may not like the dressing to mingle with the other food on their plate. I followed to the "T", so don't know if it is suppose to be this way, but too runny for me. That is why I only gave 4 stars. Flavor was great! It is a sweet slaw, so no one should be surprised or rate it low because they think it is too sweet. Personally I loved the flavor! I will make again, I just need to figure out a way to keep the dressing from becoming so runny.

I made this as written (except I didn't have poppy seeds) and found it to be quite yummy, I personally like sweet cole slaw but I found the proportions to be slightly off, as I had to end up straining it since there seemed to be way too much dressing for the amount of cole slaw mix

Had been looking for a good slaw that was not too creamy and this one hit the bulls eye.  Love it Love it.  I did however replace the Miracle Whip with a dressing called Grapeseed Vegenaise ( I am not a vegan but am trying to cut out fat) This adds a nice taste and and makes it gluten free and egg free. We will never buy store bought again when we can make this in no time

This my first time making coleslaw and found this to be an easy recipe to make.  Changes I made were to reduce sugar to 1/3 cup, used Evoo for the vegetable oil and from another reviewer's suggestion I added about 3 chopped radishes and sliced another radish for a garnish.

This is the best cole law !! of all the variations I've tried - with or without buttermilk (slightly thicker and stands up long haul),  oil and vinegar based (tart but good with pulled pork ) this one is the best hands down, all purpose slaw.  Yum. Easy and after the bag of slaw,  everything is in the pantry.
Ten minutes to make. Love it!

OMG! This is the ONLY kind of coleslaw that I care for.
It has the same yummy flavor as one in a popular chicken food chain and now I can make it right here at home. I've made it 3 times now and once a double batch to take to my daughter & her family. Everyone loved it. 
The second time I made it, I used real mayo, Rice   vinegar, a tad less sugar (because Rice viegar is a tiny bit sweeter) and celery seeds in place of the poppy seeds. 
That threw it over the top! Perfect for us!

Wonderful...been looking for a KFC type slaw.  I did make the cabbage finer by whirring it in a food processor w/a splash of water to move it along. I drained it well & proceeded with the perfect dressing.  THANKS, MUAH &   GRACIAS!

I was trying to duplicate the cole slaw from a popular restaurant and I came across this recipe sounding the most like the flavors I was aiming for...
This turned out really good and tangy.
I diced the cabbage and carrots ( that was how the restaurant did it) 
Like the other review I also used rice wine vinegar cuz I had a lot on hand. I used chopped scallions not onions, added garlic powder, and lots black pepper. I used Hellman's lite mayo...I forgot the oil but it really doesn't need  it, so save the extra fat and calories.... It was delicious.

I AM TYPICALLY NOT A HUGE COLESLAW FAN, HOWEVER THIS SLAW RECIPE IS SOOOO GOOD. I AM MAKING IT FOR THE SECOND TIME IN TWO WEEKS. I DID USE A BIT LESS SUGAR AND IT WAS PLENTY SWEET.  MY HUSBAND THOUGHT IT WAS THE BEST SLAW EVER.  THANKS FOR THE RECIPE.

This was a good, basic coleslaw recipe.  For half of this recipe I used 8 ounces of cabbage and added one small carrot, shredded.   I cut the sugar in half and thought it was plenty sweet enough for us and I skipped the poppy seeds.  This was great and we’re having the leftovers tonight!

This recipe is great!! I have to admit I used less sugar, about a 1/3 less. It was still pretty sweet. Was just as good the next day too. I didn't love the onion part but that can be adjusted too.

This is the best.  Much better than any restaurant slaw.  Due to personal preference I reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup and replaced the poppy seeds with celery seeds.  It's a keeper!  Thanks for this recipe Sandi!

Great dressing! And, for those of us without access to packaged chopped mixes, you can just hack up a cabbage...

This is the perfectly sweet, non-vinegar-y, southern style coleslaw I was looking for.  My family loves it!

I will never buy slaw again. Because I have several family members that are diabetic, I substituted with Splenda, using 1/4 cup less than what is called for with sugar. Rave reviews from multiple generations!  Thank for posting.

Almost identical to my mother-in-law's down-home southern slaw recipe.  We do use only 1/4 cup sugar and up the vinegar to 2 tbl.  I used Chia seeds instead of poppy seeds; and it was wonderful!

This is the first time I've ever made homemade coleslaw. It was perfect! Shredded my own cabbage and carrots for 1/2 the price of what the bagged stuff costs. I didn't have poppy seeds but I will try to have them next time! Used light mayo instead of miracle whip and the sugar sweetened it! Love love it!!!

A 5 with my changes and a 4 as is. I omit the white sugar and use honey or agave nectar. I use mayo with no extra oil and I also use red onion for color. I have used the same dressing with shredded broccoli salad and the family loves that too.

Being a southerner this is exactly what I was looking for.  If you are familiar with and love sweet slaw look no further.  This is the recipe you want.  The only thing I did differently was reduce the sugar just a tad and used onion powder (didn't have an onion on hand).  Thank you, Sandi!

This is by far the best cole slaw recipe ever.  I've tried so many and this my family's favorite.  I substitute the sugar with Splenda to keep it on my low carb diet and it was great.  I use mayo and either poppy seeds or celery seeds...both work equally well.

Left out the sugar completely (diabetics in the family) and used lower fat mayo & celery seed instead of poppy seed. Rave reviews to go with bbq pork. Definite Winner!

i just made this and it is super simple and super good!!!! haven't even put it the fridge yet. my 4 year old daughter help me make. i followed the recipe completely except i used EVOO instead of vegetable oil and pepper instead of poppy seeds, but only because i didn't have those two ingredients. oh, and i did cut back on the sugar but only by a couple tablespoons.perfect recipe!!! next time i will make sure i have ALL of the ingredients.  Oh, and this is my first time making coleslaw, but it sure won't be the last.

I was looking for a coleslaw recipe to go with my pulled chicken.  This was pretty good, I cut the recipe down tho...even with a 1/4c of sugar I found it way sweet and added a dash of dijon mustard and a bit more vingar and more of the coleslaw from the bag.  I also cut on the mayo to 2tbs since hubby doesn't like that stuff.  It tastes pretty good actually, I'm impressed think it will be great on our shredded chicken sandwiches.  Thanks for sharing :)

Wonderful!!  Made it exactly as stated and everyone loves it.  There is only one problem....you can't eat any other coleslaw after having this HA!!!  It is that good!!!  Thanks so much for sharing!
UPDATE:  I made this again with the slow cooker barbecue ribs from this site, and this sweet slaw recipe is still the best we've ever had!  Thanks again!!

I've made this 3-4 times now, just popped it in the fridge to cream up and decided to finally write a review. This is complementing slow cooker pulled pork tonight. This is a great recipe to fix up the night before or before you go to work in the morning while a croc pot meal cooks all day as well. Let's face it, none of us really want to cook a gourmet meal when we get home. I added SLIGHTLY less than 1/2 cup sugar and omitted the onions (weren't feeling them today but they taste good in it otherwise).

5 stars with changes. I skipped the oil. Cut the sugar to 1/3 cup. Used  1 Tbl. apple cider vinegar and left out the poppy seeds. Definitely a keeper!

Warning:  Reduce the sugar, otherwise awesome recipe.  I made this recipe for the first time for a Pig Pickin this weekend.  I have never made slaw in my life.  It got rave reviews from the 30+ people in attendance.  I did grate my own cabbage and carrots for the slaw instead of bag slaw.  I quadrupled the recipe (3/4 of a very large head of cabbage and ½ of red cabbage, carrots as preferred) but only used ½ cup of sugar and ¼ cup of oil rather than what was called for in a quadrupled recipe and it was perfect.  I can’t imagine using ½ c sugar in the original recipe when it was plenty in a quadrupled recipe.  I also added a bit of white pepper and fresh ground pepper.  It was DELICIOUS!

I did a vegan version by substituting Veganese for the salad dressing, and I cut back on the sugar, and everyone (my carnivorous family) raved about it.

I made this as directed except I used mayo.  It was for a family dinner and everyone absolutely loved it!  This is going to be my go-to slaw recipe.

perfect slaw. i made the following changes, but it was based on preference: used mayo, omitted the oil and poppy seeds, and used sweet onion instead of white. I grated the onion into it right before stirring the sauce with the coleslaw. everyone raved about this slaw, even those who don't typically like slaw!

I really liked it, I tried to make it healthier by using splenda instead of normal sugar and I could taste the splenda. Thats my own fault though, I love a good slaw so I will be remaking this and using normal sugar. I will rerate when I do!

This is every bit as good as the slaw from KFC.  I do think it's a bit heavy on dressing and I either double the coleslaw (for a big group) or cut the other ingredients in half.  Excellent on pulled pork sandwiches...or hotdogs!

Yum! This was so easy to make. Nice to be able to make something that can normally cost so much premaid. I did use only 1/3 cup of sugar and it was still maybe a little sugary. Probably will cut down to 1/4 cup next time - and I did use mayo, not miracle whip. I also did half and half poppy seeds and celery seed since celery seed is originally in cole slaw. Thanks!

I loved it!  I did cut down on the sugar and used malt vinegar instead of white (I don't know why!). I used the salt to dry out the slaw mix a bit since I won't be serving this until tomorrow.  Instead of poppy seeds I added a little celery salt and fresh ground pepper.  I know this sounds strange but hubby and I both love sliced green olives in our slaw!  It adds a little bit of zip and most people like it after they try it.  I would imagine that this would be great on a bbq pork sandwich like they make in the south. I think I'm going to be making more slaw in the future.  Thanks for the recipe Sandi!!!

Awesome, simple recipe!! The only things I changed the second time I made it were that I removed the oil from the recipe, used veganaise, and reduced the sugar. I made it the first time to go over pulled pork sandwiches and it was delicious!

Yummy!  I didnt give 5 stars because I made a couple of changes. We don't use miracle whip, but I substituted Mayo.  Used all the other ingredients as is except poppy seeds - I didn't have any so I used celery seed. I think if I used miracle whip it would have definitely been too sweet.  Even my hubby who hates coleslaw liked it.

I'm pretty picky when it comes to coleslaw... and I have to say that this is some of the best I've had and definitely THE best I've made.  I did cut the sugar in half and use 1/4c.  I also threw in a couple of handfuls of shredded carrot, as the mix I bought didn't have it.

I didn't have poppy seeds so I subbed celery seeds and used mayo instead of miracle whip as that's what we buy.  Kept everything else the same and the whole family loved it.  Will be making this for years to come...

This lived up to its name.  I doubled the onion to 1/4 c. and finely diced it.  To lower the fat I used only 2 T. of oil and substituted Splenda for the sugar.  I also added a dash of dry mustard.  It was creamy, rich and better than from the deli.

I accidentally got a 2.5 oz package of coleslaw mix at the store, so I just used less of everything (like 1/4 cup of sugar instead of a 1/2 cup) I used 1/3 cup of Miracle Whip, 1 tbz of veggie oil, the original 1 tbs of vinegar, but all I had was white wine vinegar, and the 1/4 tbs of salt, ommitting the poppy seeds since my bf works for the government and poppy seeds would show up on a drug test. I added a green bell pepper finely diced. The flavor of the dressing is awesome, and I know that next time I will remember to get a 16 oz bag of slaw mix and I will follow the recipe exactly except for adding some green bell pepper...

I JUST MADE THIS COLESLAW FOR THE FIRST TIME AND IT WAS DELICIOUS. I DID CHANGE A FEW THINGS...ISUBSTITUTED CELERY SEED, LITE MAYO, OMITTED THE SUGAR AND ADDED 3 SHREDDED CARROTS FOR SWEETNESS,AND ADDED 3 STALKS OF CELERY ALSO. I DID ALSO ADD ABOUT 1 CUP OF VENEGAR. GREAT !!!! I ALSO USED A WHOLE HEAD OF CABBAGE. OH, I ALSO DIDNT USE ANY OIL.

I thought this was FANTASTIC! I left out the onion (we don't like raw) and I used Splenda instead of sugar, and followed everything else as stated (I used light mayo instead of miracle whip). I was so suprised at how yummy this came out! It really did remind me of something I would get at various restaurants, better than I've had at many! It is sweet, but I liked it that way a lot. I might add a little pepper next time for personal preference, but it doesn't need to be changed.

I made this for a BBQ and had absolutely no leftovers.  Everyone loved it.  I did add more vinegar and less sugar.  And I used celery seasoning instead of poppy seeds.

A 4.5 would better describe my rating.  I'm not a big fan of cole slaw in general but this is pretty good.  Everyone else at the party really enjoyed it.  It is a little on the sweet side as far as coleslaw goes. I really like the poppy seeds and the 2nd time I made the recipe I added celery seeds too. I thought there was a bit too much dressing and in the future I will add half the dressing (all the poppy seeds), let it sit for 2 hours and adjust the dressing from there. I had a big problem w/extra dressing the 1st time I had this because my bag of cole slaw mix was only 14 oz so check and make sure what size bag you have. Just made again (8/2011) and I still like and had none to put away when the party was over.  This time I did swap out some cabbage for broccoli slaw mix and nobody was the wiser!  I make the dressing and add sparingly, you always add more just before serving but you don't want it too drippy.

Great coleslaw and I don't usually even like the stuff!  To lower the calories, I used low fat mayo and it still tasted great.  I took the advice of other reviewers and used celery seed instead of poppy seeds and added a pinch more of salt.  I didn't add radishes but I'm sure it would have been tasty as well.  Bon appetite!

This is my kind of slaw!  When I was a child I ate a bunch of sugar and mayo as my mother was preparing slaw and got really sick.  Never ate slaw again for probably 25 years.  Now I'm very picky about my slaw and this recipe is my favorite.  I buy the shredded slaw packages and then even cut it down more finely to get just the right texture.  Also, I often cut the recipe back to better serve two people and it works great.  It does taste like what you get out.

Good basic recipe but I reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup and it was plenty sweet.  I also love cole slaw with a tablespoon or two of minced sushi ginger added.

The only cole slaw that I will eat comes from KFC.  This tastes EXACTLY like that.  I wasn't sure about the Miracle Whip, as I don't like it in general, but was de-lish!  Thanks for the recipe!

I received good comments on this.  I don't eat coleslaw but the hubby and kids loved it (as did other family members).  I did cut back on the sugar as suggested (used 3/4 cup) and I also used 1/3 heavy mayo and 1/3 cup miracle whip light instead of 2/3 salad dressing.

This coleslaw recipe was fast and fabulous. It's been difficult to find a recipe that is just the right sweetness. I followed the recipe perfectly just cut the sugar to 1/3 c and all was fabulous. It was even better the 2nd day. Its a keeper!

This is awesome!! I have never liked coleslaw before but my husband insisted I try it! Delicious! I omitted the onions just because my husband doesnt care for them! Other than that followed it to a T. Oh yeah..its WAY better after it sits overnight!!!

I am a cole slaw snob!  I love this recipe.  It's quick and easy.  I omit the onions and seeds, but that is just due to preference.  It's still good without it.  I always make this with a bbq pork for sandwiches recipe from this site.  Great dinner and good left over, too.

Wow! Hold on! I mean it was good but seriously cut back on the sugar by at least 1/4. Only reason I didn't do 5 stars was because it was to sweet.

I adjusted the serving size to 24 and used 3 lbs of coleslaw mix. The coleslaw was delicious!!  This will remain in my recipe box!!  (BTW, I followed the recipe with no changes.)

Absolutely wonderful!  Made one batch of this for a party I was hosting and when my b/f tasted he said I needed to make more because it wouldn't last.  It tastes just like that chicken fast food place's slaw, only better.  Crunchy and fresh! LOVE IT!

Excellent!  I did cut the sugar almost in half ( I used about 5 T instead of 8) because I don't like it real sweet.  I love the poppy seeds in it.  It made me realize that every coleslaw that I really liked has poppy seeds!  I'm not sure if it's for flavor or looks. LOL!  Thank you!!!! Oh, I also shredded my own cabbage and carrots.

I made a lot of modifications, but it was great!  (1) Mayo instead of Miracle Whip (2) Dollop of Sour Cream instead of Vegetable Oil (3) Less sugar (~1/3 cup) (4) More vinegar (~2 Tbsp) (5) Celery Seed instead of Poppy Seed  It's not science, I just threw things together until it looked right and this was about what I used.  Turned out great, I think this is a very flexible recipe!

Great recipe! Made cole slaw for the first time with this recipe, and was really glad that it came out tasting just how I liked it.

This was a good base.  I used fat-free mayo, 1/4 c. sugar, and rice wine vinegar instead of white.  I also left out the poppy seeds, added pepper, and chopped apples.  With these changes, it was the best I've ever made.

This tastes just like KFC's coleslaw.  I have never been able to find a good coleslaew recipe but this is a keeper.  Only thing I changed was using just 1 tbsp vegetable oil.

This was so good. Absolutely the best slaw recipe I have tried. Definitely let it chill for a couple of hours before serving, it just gets better. On day two, I did drain off a bit of the excess juice, but other than that, it was still perfect.

This recipe is AMAZING!  I followed it to the tee and it turned out perfect!  I thought it was going to be too dry but after setting up for a little bit it was perfectly runny and I was glad I didn't double the dressing.  We are big cole slaw fans and I always just buy it from KFC b/c I thought it was too hard to make.  Bye bye KFC - we have found our new fave slaw!

This coleslaw is easy to prepare and is delicous!  The only change I made, based on the recommendations of other feedback, was I substituted mayonaisse instead of miracle whip and I cut back on the sugar by about half.  After tasting it, it definitely would have been WAY too sweet with all of that sugar.  Half is about all you need and it is still sweet :-)  Enjoy, this recipe is a keeper!

Loved it!  I left out the onion just because I don't really like raw onion.  It's much less "harsh" than any of the bottle sauces I've tried.  I'll make it again!

I just made this with a few little tweaks, as all good cooks do, and I found this to be fabulous.  I don't care for mayo so I wanted to find a recipe that called for miracle whip.  Thanks so much.  This is now the only recipe I will use.

the only cole slaw recipe you'll need.  I used apple cider vinegar and cut down the sugar a bit and used mayonnaise since I didn't have any Miracle Whip. Every time I serve this to company, I am asked for the recipe.

I recently became a fan of slaw mainly because I live in the south now, and we do a lot of BBQ's. I decided to look here for a recipe since the store bought garbage is way to sweet most of the time, or too soggy. This is easily a 5 star recipe! I've made it 3 times in 3 weeks. I took the advise of many and reduced the sugar amount slightly. Do yourself a favor and make sure you use the poppy seeds! I've made it both ways, and prefer to have them in it. Simple, inexpensive, and delicious!

Exactly what I was looking for!  I did add just a little less sugar than called for (it just seemed like alot while I was pouring it in), switched out the poppy seeds for celery seeds and also used onion powder instead of chopped onion (I have picky eaters who would not have eaten it if they knew there were onions, lol).  Loved how easy & inexpensive this was - thank you for sharing!!  :)

I made this exactly as written.  Came out tasting a little sweet to me, but my husband ate it with pulled BBQ beef and he thought the sweetness balanced with the BBQ sauce perfectly.  I plan to make this again, but may try a sugar substitute next time to make it a bit healthier.  Great recipe!

This slaw was good, but not quite 5 stars.  For me, it was a little too sweet even though I reduced the sugar from 1/2 cup to 1/4 cup.  Miracle Whip is pretty sweet on its own.  If I make it again I will reduce the sugar even a little more.  But other than that, the flavor was very good.

I use allrecipes, all the time. And this is the first time I've ever rated a 5-star recipe lower than that. Have to admit I was somewhat disappointed in this recipe.  To be fair - I used Mayo instead of Miracle Whip because that's what my family prefers, but I think it would have tasted MUCH better with Miracle Whip. I also reduced the sugar to a 1/4 cup because 1/2 seemed like way too much. What I got was a very plain tasting, somewhat dry pile of cabbage. =(  I suppose I'll probably try it again - w/out variation to the recipe - but at this point I'm just not thrilled with it. UPDATE 45/1/10 - I tried this recipe again - making it exactly as noted and it was FANTASTIC!! Best cole slaw I've ever had. Use Miracle Whip (even if you don't like it) and the full amount of sugar - you WON'T be disappointed!

Outstanding recipe!! My kids gobbled it up and they don't even like cabbage. I added more onions but kept everything else the same. Didn't last two nights here. Thank you for a fabulous recipe...I also made this for a pig roast, everyone asked for the recipe..

I love this recipe! I HATE cole slaw, but I made this for my fiance and he made me try it...and I LOVED it!!! It's the only cole slaw I will eat now!! I use low fat or fat free may instead of Miracle Whip, 1/3 cup Splenda sugar substitute instead of 1/2 cup sugar, and I add about 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Sometimes I leave out the onions (a lot of people in my family don't like onions, but if I do add the onions, I use Sweet Vidalia onions). I usually just shred my own cabbage and carrots - saves me money!! ALDI stores usually sell a head of cabbage for around 99 cents and a bag of baby carrots for 99 cents also. I shred up about 2 cups cabbage and then I use my cheese grater to shred up 6 baby carrots, YUMMMMY!! I try to plan Chinese food for later in the week when I make this recipe - that way I can use the remainder of the head of cabbage shredded up in egg rolls and stir fry!

Great taste! Very similar to the slaw you get at  KFC. I added 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar and used 1/3 cup mayonnaise and 1/3 cup miracle whip. Let it chill for about 5 hours...my family loved it topped on pulled pork sandwiches! Will be making this again for sure :)

Oh man, oh man, oh man!! This slaw is delicious!!! I wanted to try it first, and if it's this good now, I can't wait to eat it again later!! I used fat free mayo instead of Miracle Whip because that's what I had. I also used olive oil instead of vegetable and omitted the poppy seeds because I didn't have any. I only used 3/8 cup of sugar because I like my slaw more on the tangy side. Even at that, I thought it was a tad too sweet for my taste. I added some more vinegar and a bit more mayo to mellow it out. Next time, I will try 1/4 cup sugar and see where that takes me. Even still, I gotta give this recipe 5 stars because it's THAT good! Thanks!

Excellent recepie! My husband was exstatic when I made this. His mom had always made the sour dill version but this was just the sweetness we have been looking for. Will be using this one for years to come.

Few changes: 1/4 cup sugar, 1/3 cup mayo, 1/3 cup Miracle whip.  The dressing seems a bit thick once you add the coleslaw, but an hour in the fridge thins it out perfectly!

The absolute best slaw!  I get compliments every time I make this!!  I use bagged cole slaw and then follow the recipe to a "T".  Absolutely must sit in refrigerator for a while before serving- don't forget that part!

As Rachel Ray would say, YUM-O.  I made a few additions after reading the reviews.  I made a smaller amount of slaw and used 1 head of green cabbage instead of the bagged.  I added cut up broccoli florets, and only used 1/3 cup of mayo, since I saw reviews that said it was a bit soggy, and I don't like my coleslaw very wet.  I used mayo instead of miracle whip (because I saw that the MW added sweetness), 1/4 c. of sugar, rice wine vinegar instead of white, and about a teaspoon of deli mustard for some uumph.  Delish, and the perfect amount of sweetness for me.  Obviously I made changes, but outside of the sweetness, the recipe itself is great.  I think it just depends on how sweet/wet you like your coleslaw.  Will make, again and again!

This is my go-to slaw recipe, though I cut down on the sugar by about half. It's too sweet with all the sugar. I sometimes use dried onion instead of fresh, and red wine vinegar instead of white. Really good on pulled pork sandwiches.

I don't like cole slaw.  Not even KFC's famous recipe, nor any I've ever tried at a restaurant.  I LOVED this and it is now one of my favorite summer salads.  I did decrease the sugar a little, and that was a good thing.

BEST slaw I have ever had and so easy! I used both celery and poppy seed (1/2 tablespoon of each). My husband likes foods that have a "kick" so I have also made this and added a about half of a jalapeno pepper (finely diced). Either way...this was by far the best coleslaw I have ever made!

Very good coleslaw! It was too sweet for me also as it was, so I cut the sugar back to 1/4c and added 2 Tablespoons rice wine vinegar. I didn't have poppy seed or celery seed, so I used a pinch of celery salt, in addition to the regular salt (cut back a bit on the regular) and then a good dose of fresh ground black pepper. Let sit in the fridge fot 2 1/2 hours, and then ate with dinner. YUM!!! Added another 1/2 bag of slaw to the left overs and it was perfect again the next day. Thanks for a great recipe.

This was my first time making coleslaw and it turned out delicious!! My daughter who hates coleslaw even ate it and loved it! She said mainly because its creamier than what she's had before, rather than watery kind. I am much more into healthy eating these days and made 3 changes. I used Cholestrol free Canola Mayo, used 1 spoon of canola oil replacing spoond of veg oil and instead of sugar I used 3-4 individual packs of Splenda. Yummmmmmmy!!!! Thanks!!

I followed the instruction, but like others I cut back on the sugar.  The flavor was OK, nothing special, but after sitting overnight, it was a runny mess.  Very unappealing to look at and eat.  Guess I'll keep looking for the ultimate recipe.

I used reduced-fat mayo, cut the sugar by half, used less oil, and it was still delicious.  The next time I make it I will probably omit the oil altogether and perhaps use a tad more chopped onion....maybe.  All in all a great recipe.

This is the best coleslaw recipe I have ever tried!  I used two packets of Splenda instead of the sugar and the sweetness is perfect. Tip: This is best when made one day ahead of serving.

I was a little worried that it wouldn't get creamy enough but after an hour in the fridge it was fine.  I like sweet slaw so the sugar was perfect for me.  I did leave out the poppy seeds because I didn't have any on hand.  I used mayo instead of Miracle Whip for the same reason.  My folks, who are picky about their cole slaw, loved it.

I truly enjoyed this recipe. I too cut back on the sugar a bit, but not by much because I prefer a sweeter coleslaw. It is very similar to a well known chicken place only better because you are controlling the ingredients. I omitted the poppy seeds because I do not like them but left everything else the same. It will be my go to recipe whenever I need standard cole slaw! Absolutely delicious!

I didn't have poppy seeds and used Light Kraft Mayo.  I also added a shredded carrot.  You'd think I gave the kids pizza candy or something.  They've been raving about it all evening.  My daughter saw me bookmarking the recipe just now as got all excited.  I'll use less sugar next time.  It did get watery, so I added some extra cabbage once dinner was over.

This recipe is so good, that from now on, this is my go to slaw.  I served this every time we have bbq and everyone loves it.  The only changed I made was use 1/2 cup sugar because it was too sweet for my taste if I use the measurement on the recipe.

For starters, I used the full 1/2c sugar and Mayonaise, not Miracle Whip - Turned out Excellent, with the exception of being a bit too sweet, but still very edible.  Bringing it with me to a BBQ Tomorrow.  Next time, Probably reduce it down to about 1/3c

Love this recipe! I use it all the time. It's the best coleslaw recipe I've ever made. I use celery seed instead of poppy seeds, and I use salad vinegar or apple cider vinegar instead of plain white vinegar. Make sure you let it sit in the fridge for a couple hours before you serve it, then the taste is fabulous!

This really is just like you get at a rotisserie or fried chicken restaurant.  This is a really sweet slaw, and while it is really good, I enjoy the more vinegary ones as well.  I used reduced fat mayo and there were no problems whatsoever, but I happily cut down on the fat content!

This was DELICIOUS!...and I'm not a fan of most cole slaws. I'm not sure why some reviewers are saying it's too sweet...after all, it's called SWEET slaw! Just the way I like it!! I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't have store-bought slaw mix...I had a small head of cabbage I wanted to use up and grated some carrots in too...now I had slaw mix. I also used Miracle Whip...not sure why you wouldn't...mayo has a completely different flavor (not as good in my opinion). So, GREAT recipe just as written! I will make this again and again :-)

Everyone loved this!  Even the ones who said they didn't like coleslaw.  I also omitted the poppy seeds and used regular mayo...not Miracle Whip (bleh!)  I used a head of green and red cabbage with about 2 carrots and doubled the sauce amount.  Great recipe!!

WOW! This was good! I substituted the salad dressing and the oil for 1 cup of Mayo. I also didn't have any onions on hand, so I left that out and I didn't have any poppy seeds but used black pepper instead. My hubby couldn't stop eating it and my 11 year old said it was much better than any coleslaw she had ever eaten at any restaurant.

It was my first time making Cole Slaw and this recipe turned out amazing! So easy to make! It turned even better the longer I let it stand. I brought it to a potluck and people loved it! One of my friends said he was amazed - the best cole slaw he ever ate in the South comes from a German!  I made some minor changes for the sauce. I used 2 1/2 tbsp vinegar, 1 1/2 cups mayonaise and halfed the sugar. After mixing everything I decided to give another half a bag of slaw to it and it turned out great! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I'm picky when it comes to coleslaw, but this one made the cut.  I didn't use poppy seeds since I didn't have any. And instead of miracle whip, I used Hellman's Light Mayo.  I do wish I had chopped the coleslaw up more, but that isn't a big deal.

This was great! I'm usually not a fan of coleslaw, but I couldn't keep my fork out of this.  I didn't have Miracle Whip on hand, so I used a 1/2 c of regular mayo and omitted the oil.  I also added 1 tsp of ground mustard.  Even better on day two.  Thanks for this great recipe!

This was wonderful, just what I was looking for.  I even cut the sugar in half, and substituted plain yogurt for 1/2 the mayo...still just PERFECT.  For anyone who knows Chinooks in Seattle, this tasted just like their slaw.

I made a double batch of this for my husband to take to work for a fish fry.  It was very, very good and he said the guys loved it.  The bowl DID come back empty.  The only two things I did different was to use Creole seasoning in lieu of salt and omitted the poppy seeds.  I think next time I will try using a little celery seed.  Thanks for sharing.

I have always purchased the bottled cole slaw dressing and was always left underwhelmed, so I thought I'd try to make it from scratch. I can't believe that I have been paying $4 a bottle  when I could have been making this recipe for a fraction of the price and be thrilled with the taste. I made it exactly as the recipe dictates and it was perfect! Just like what you would get in a restaurant.

Great recipe.  I used a shredded broccoli slaw and added cabbage.  That worked out well.  It was wonderful.  It got very creamy by the next day so I am adding more cabbage and I will get even more from it.

Wow!  This slaw was delicious and is perfect when it chills for 2 hours or more. As others recommended, I used celery seeds in place of poppy seeds.  I served this with grilled chicken and steak and it disappeared quickly.

This recipe will be my new "go-to" recipe for cole slaw.  Its every bit as good as the reviews say.  I used Hellmans because that is what I had on hand, and used a couple tablespoons less sugar than what the recipe suggests.  I felt the amount of dressing made suits the 16 oz package of cole slaw, so I had no leftover dressing.

This is hands down the best coleslaw recipe. I used hellman's and just shy of the sugar amount.  Absolutely fantastic. The best things about it is that it takes two minutes to put together (literally), it's cheap, and the result is, you've brought the best dish to the party! Thank you Sandi!

Wow! This is the best cole slaw that I have ever had. When I started making the dressing, I couldn't help but lick the spoon, as this tangy slaw is just that irresistable. I added just a splash of lemon juice to brighten the flavor just a bit. Great on top on pulled pork sandwich. So easy and popular with guests that you'll never buy store bought again.

This was amazing. I made my own version of "KFC-at-home dinner", with the fried chicken, french fries and coleslaw and used this recipe. I did not buy the packaged coleslaw but made my own combination of cabbage, carrot and lettuce. I used mayo instead of miracle whip. I followed some of the reviews that adviced to cut a tad on the sugar. It turned out delicious! Follow the recommendation of leaving it in the fridge at least 2 hours before serving. Thank you for the wonderful recipe! 5 stars!

This was the best creamy slaw!  I'm usually not a fan of coleslaw but I made it to go along with Elaine's Sweet & Tangy Loose Beef BBQ from this site and it was GREAT! Everyone loved it- I just wish I would have made more.  The only thing I would do different is add another 1/2 bag of cabbage because I had pleanty of extra dressing.  Thanks for the yummy recipe.

Yummy!!  I halved the sauce recipe because I don't like too much in my coleslaw.  I also used sour cream instead of oil, and celery seed instead of poppy seed.  Other than that I made it as written and it is absolutely delicious!!

Made this the other night and hubby just loved it.  I like my slaw a little more sour, but that's just personal taste.  Beats the heck out of buying expensive coleslaw dressing.  Will definately be using this recipe again.

On its own, this slaw is a little too sweet for my tastes, but on a pulled pork sandwich with chipolte bbq sauce,watch out taste buds!!! Excellent. I did not have salad dressing or poppy seeds, so I used mayo and celery seed. Next time with fish, I will cut the sugar back by 1/3, but with bbq will make again as written.

I made this recipe to go along with the Slow Cooked Corned Beef for Sandwiches recipe on this site, for St. Patrick’s Day. I normally do not like coleslaw but I was pleasantly surprised with this recipe.  Another plus was that it literally took minutes to put together. Just a note-there was alot of dressing at the bottom of the bowl-will add less next time.  I will definitely make again this summer at my next bbq.

Oh My God. Seriously, this is awesome. I've never made coleslaw before, and this is amazing. I added the sugar to taste, and used slightly less than a half cup. This is the best. Thank you!

Excellent coleslaw...much better than most restaurants! The only changes I made were to cut the sugar in half, use mayo instead and omit the poppy seeds. Didn't even need to use all the dressing.  Served it with pulled pork sandwiches...a very tasty, inexpensive and nutritious meal! Everyone raved and none was leftover. Thanks!

This is just my favorite slaw recipe ever! I love coleslaw and I even at restaurants I have been dissappointed by the different version which never compares with this recipe. I remember the first time I had a similar slaw, I fell in love with it and very seldom I have found one as good as this one! a keeper. Thank you so much for the recipe, it will be my standard side for my BB'Q pork ribs from now on!

I used mayo for mine and splenda in place of the sugar.  I felt like it could have used maybe a little more vinegar and maybe a different kind of vinegar (rice wine or white balsamic even) for a little more kick. (Update) - Made again after making my own slaw mix (1 cabbage, about 1 cup red cabbage and some carrots) and used regular sugar, apple cider vinegar (used probably 1/2 cup) and added some horseradish.  It tasted okay but still not quite where I'd want it to be ideally.

I like my slaw with a little bit more sauce and bite, so I used 1/2 cup of vinegar and about 1/2 cup of mayonaise.  I thought it was just too dry with what the recipe suggested.

I loved this!  It was a really delicious slaw!  It is a little "wet" and sweet, but that's how it's supposed to be.  I cut the sugar to just under 1/2 cup, used onion powder instead of diced onion (I was out!), and celery seeds instead of poppy seeds.  I definitely see this in our future!  Thanks!

This was one of the best recipes I have made. I used 2 tablespoons of vinegar and used celery seed instead of poppy seed as suggested by another. Use the ingredients and alter to your taste. I won't use another coleslaw recipe again!

I made this recipe for a New Year's Dinner and it was the first thing to go on the buffet table. Another guest brought coleslaw as well and only a few people touched it. My Mom loved this recipe and she is the pickiest person in the world. She has already asked me to make it again this weekend. It was easy and super simple to make. This is definitely a keeper.

I made this for our third Thanksgiving in 3 days when we were now eating turkey sandwiches and everyone loved it.  I doubled the entire recipe except for the sugar.  I only used 1/2 cup of sugar for the double batch and it was just the right sweetness.  Keeper!!

This is a very good recipe! The only change I made was adding celery seed instead of the poppy seeds. My picky husband even remarked as to how good this was. Thanks for submitting this one!!

Very good slaw, but two little problems: a little too sweet and really watery. So use a touch less sugar, a bit more vinegar, and WAY less oil. Delicious stuff!

This is awesome cole slaw.  I made it the first time exact and it was too sweet as others have said.  I usually see recipes that others think are too sweet and I think they are fine but this was just a little too much.  I used the 1/2 meas. cup and just didn't fill it all the way, just guessed how much to leave out on the sugar.  Other than that perfect.  I also added small pieces of pineapple, grapes and golden raisins, if you like fruity slaw this one is good to make additions.

I'll have to go with 3 stars on this one.  The flavor was pretty good, but this a VERY sweet slaw, which I thought I liked, but it was way too much for me!  I do like the "bones" of the recipe though.  Next time I'll use hellman's instead of miracle whip, double the onion, and no more than 1/4 cup sugar.  I do agree that this gets very "wet" as it sits, but that is just the nature of cabbage and salt.

Everyone at the BBQ loved this slaw.  They swore I must have bought it from KFC.  It was a bit sweet for me, but the all thought it was perfect.  Why buy premade dressing, this was so super simple.

I made this with the 1/3 cup sugar (instead of 1/2) and without any poppy seeds and was told this was the best ever.  It was terrific.  Thank you.  A definite keeper.

I thought this was a great slaw.  I grew up in the deep south, and southern-style food is a big deal there.  If you do it wrong, especially a staple like cole slaw, they'll let you know by not eating it off their plate!  I made this and thought it was perfect...didn't use poppy seeds (didn't have any).  But the onion gives it a nice added flavor to it, and I added about 1/2 tsp more vinegar for more tart, used olive oil instead of veg oil, and I love the end result.  Made this to put on top of homemade bbq pulled pork I'm making in my crockpot today.  I can't wait to top my bbq pork sandwich with this.  TRUE southerners add cole slaw to the top of their bbq pork, in a sandwich. The combination of the creamy/tart flavor with your bbq pork sandwich is simply delicious!  Thanks for the recipe, I'll be holding onto this one.  A True Southerner's Stamp of Approval!

This was great.  I used less sugar, as others suggested, and am definitely glad I did because I think it would have been too sweet if I had used as much as was called for.

*** I just made this again and swapped out a little more than half of the mayo with fat free greek yogurt.  You can't taste the difference and it really lightens it up.  Give it a try!

I have tried the Restaurant Style Coleslaw 1 on this website and prefer this recipe much more. It tasted excellent made exactly as is. Not too much dressing and not too little, and it was just the combination of sweetness and tanginess I was looking for.

YUMMY! I just made this to have with our dinner tonight and we can't keep our hands out of it. We keeping going for "just one more bite." Hopefully, their will be some left at dinner. The only thing different I did was to take the advice of others and use 1/2 the amount of sugar (I used Splenda). This really is wonderful.

Really good, but I definitely cut the sugar in half.    I also only used a 14oz bag because that was all our store had, but we liked the amount of "sauce" with the amount of coleslaw mix...nice and wet.  EDIT: Also delish with some cashews and mandarin oranges tossed in as a side to a tenderloin, etc.

I have found several recipes on this website that I consider "lifetime" recipes, or "keepers."  This is one of them.  I didn't personally eat it b/c I am a picky eater, but my family loved it.  My husband said it tasted like at the chicken place, that it was definitely a "keeper."  I followed the recipe exactly with no changes.  Thanks for the easy and well received recipe!

This was very good. The only thing I did differently was use Miracle Whip LIGHT. Next time I will try to use Splenda. I did not have any today but I have a feeling it will work just as well! If someone tries the Splenda, let me know!

Excellent recipe.  Yes, this is on the sweet side, but that's the way we like it.  The only change I made was instead of 1/2 tsp poppy seeds, I used 1/4 tsp poppy seeds and 1/4 tsp. celery seeds.   Just a personal preference.

I loved this so much!  Unfortunately I couldn't follow the recipe exactly because I didn't have onions or miracle whip.  I used regular mayo and no onions.  Also I went by other suggestions and put in a little less sugar.  But let me tell you, this was amazing!!  So good with our sweet and spicy bbq ribs!  This recipe is a keeper for sure

I have made this coleslaw many times, and it never disappoints. Guests compliment me whenever I serve it. It is now my go-to for coleslaw. Thanks for sharing it.

Way too Sweet!  I wish I had read reviews before making it, but I was in a hurry.  I would cut sugar by half to start.  I had to keep adding more AC Vinegar to cut the sweetness, even after using regular mayo , not Miracle whip.

First review ever. This is an awesome cole slaw. Just what I was looking for and DELICIOUS!  I will admit I altered it a bit based on other comments but the base is perfect.  Cut the sugar in half, used a bit of sour cream instead of oil and reserved some of the dressing to add once some of the water from the cabbage is drained off.  Thanks, keeping this one.

Absloultely fantastic. 
Changes I made: Except for the slaw and onion, I cut the recipe in half as the original was a bit too saucy for us.

Love this recipe! I've made it a lot. My husband likes it, and he's picky with the coleslaw. The only things I do different: celery seed instead of poppy seed, add pepper, and only use half the dressing. It turns out perfectly for us. Thanks for the recipe!

Very best slaw and not too sweet. I soaked onion in ice water for 20 minutes and used apple cider vinegar instead of white vinegar. Really enjoyed it.

I didn't have poppy seeds so i used celery seed. Second time I made it I used cider vinegar and increased by a Tablespoon to give it more kick.

I've made this recipe with only change being celery seeds instead of poppy seeds.  Can't keep it around very long - my family loves it.  Guess we like our coleslaw on the sweeter side, so this is perfect.

Delish!  I’ll definitely make this recipe again!  In fact it will probably be my go-to recipe for Coleslaw!  I started out with 1/2 of the sugar and that seemed like enough for me.  Also, my poppy seeds expired in 2012 (time clean out the spices!) so I used celery seed instead.  Everything else was the same.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

update to my first review: I too decreased the sugar in subsequent making. I've spent many years living in the southern United States and know how Southerners like certain things sweet (food things) in particular ;)

Great recipe!  I always double it because it looks like so much less once the cabbage soaks up the dressing.  I think it needs more cabbage as there is a LOT of dressing.

After seeing a few other reviews, I added my sugar gradually to taste. I ended up using only 1/4 cup sugar. I still give five stars because I know other people prefer their Cole slaw sweeter and would have still been edible if I had added the amount called for.

I've been making this for about 15 years. I originally found it as a copycat for KFC Coleslaw. It is, by far, the best slaw recipe I have ever found.

I got this recipe in order to save on the costly store-bought slaw dressing brand that I use.  It was finding it hard to continue to pay that price to have a good slaw dressing.  I tried it the first time and found that it works with modifications.  My husband likes a little tartness to his dressing so I reduced the sugar content and increased the vinegar.  After the modifications, I now make this in batches so that I can store the dressing in the fridge so I don't have to always make up a single batch.  Do yourself a favor, and try the recipe and adjust to your liking but, you can save money by using this recipe if you buy the store-bought brands.

We have a local fish restaurant that is amazing, and many people that ate my slaw compared it to this restaurants!  The key is making it the night before or as early in the day as you can because the longer it sits, the thicker and creamier it gets. I add a few mustard seeds; I think they give it a little deeper flavor. It easily doubles for a crowd

This was really good.  I'll probably cut back the sugar a bit -- maybe just a little over a 1/4 cup and I have a major sweet tooth so let that be your guide.  I did not have poppy seeds but didn't miss them.  I did add two tablespoons of milk to this to thin out the dressing and coat everything nicely.  It gets better the longer it sits in the fridge.  My husband is a coleslaw connoisseur and this passed his test with flying colors.

OMG!! This is the exact and wonderful slaw accompanying chicken and fish!  It is a SWEET like the name of the slaw, not sweet and sour or vinegar dressing slaw.  This definitely is the best slaw recipe I have ever tasted and I have tasted plenty people at 69 years old.  Thank you so much for this recipe I have longed looked for.

I have made this recipe as written and with a change. As written, I found the dressing too sweet. I only added 2 tbsp of sugar the second time I made it. My family preferred that version much better. As far as coleslaw dressing goes, this is  THE recipe. Lowering the sugar was a preference, not a necessity.

I have made this recipe MANY times.  The only changes I make are that I use real mayo instead of miracle whip, and I replace the poppy seeds with celery seed.  
When I first mix it, I always think that there is too much dressing.  However, after a few hours in the fridge or before serving, I drain the excess liquid and dressing and it turns out perfect.  So good!

Great taste. My only modification was to place finished slaw in a strainer over a bowl while refrigerating. This avoids the pooling of dressing on the slaw..

I used corn syrup in place of white sugar. My secret for cold sauces and dressings that use white sugar is corn syrup. Lastly, I added a very light touch of cayenne & garlic powder.

This is a good base for the creamy coleslaw the we like. I substituted 2 T stevia blend for the sugar, and added 1 1/2 tsp yellow mustard. Yum!

I made this again, forgetting I made it the first time. This time I made it according to the recipe, but only added 1 Tablespoon of unrefined sugar instead of 1/2 cup. Yum again!

I doubled the recipe for a pot luck, I left out the onion, I used 15 packets of stevia instead of sugar and used avocado oil instead of "vegetable oil" and also added some ground black pepper --- I heard last night "This is the BEST cole slaw I have ever had!"  I brought the one scoop of leftovers to work for taste tests -- "OMG this is to DIE FOR!"  This gets 5 thumbs up and is so very easy to make!  Making it again shortly for my employees to enjoy.

I always get requests for this slaw! It is a bit on the sweet side, so I cut the sugar to 1/4 cup. I don’t use all the dressing mix either, because my fiance doesn’t like it too creamy. The flavor is spot on though, so I have to give it a full 5 stars!

It is the perfect restaurant style cole slaw recipe. It's still a bit too sweet for my taste. Next time I'll substitute regular mayo for Miracle whip. Try this, you'll like it.

My family doesn't like coleslaw as creamy so I cut the dressing to 1/2 cup-ish and the rest of the liquids to half. We are focused on eating healthier so I cut the sugar to half; left the salt at recommended as we dont put salt on our food at the table. 
My picky as heck toddler scarfs it down with these changes.

Great base recipe.  Really good as is, but depending on who I’m making it for, I may change or add a few things.   Mostly, I add about 1/2 Tbl spoon of horseradish.   My family loves the “kick” it gives after a moment in your mouth.  I don’t always have poppyseeds.

Really good, other reviewers were right to cut down the sugar. I used half miracle whip and half regular mayo. Didn’t have poppy seeds or dried onion and it was still super good.

I switched out the oil for low-fat milk and traded the poppy seeds for celery seeds.  I cut the sugar from 1/2 cup to 1/3 and the mayo from 2/3 cup to 1/2 cup.  It was good.

The 2nd time I made this, I went light on the sugar (about half of what the recipe calls for) and heavy on the vinegar. I used apple cider vinegar and doubled the amount. I added some pepper and garlic powder as well.

I have prepared this a few times now. I use Miracle Whip. It is my go-to now rather than the commercial bottles of coleslaw dressing.

I used mayo instead of  salad dressing and left off the poppy seeds and used splenda rather than sugar. It got many compliments from friends and family. I'll always use this recipe.

I really need to read the reviews before I make stuff lol. Well if you make this as is everyone was right way to much sugar! So what I did was add more white wine vinegar, a bunch of celery salt and onion powder because I don't eat raw onion. Much better!

I made this without the sugar or oil, and added about a teaspoon of hot sauce, and it was great. Not sure what the “chicken chain” slaw is supposed to taste like, but miracle whip Ian plenty sweet, so I can’t imagine how sweet this would be like with sugar. As far as oil, it just seems excessive. The dressing was a little thick, but once the veggies gave off some water (I tossed them in salt first), it was a great texture. PLEASE try it without all the sugar and oil! It’s  good coleslaw, and better for you!!

I reduced the sugar by 1/2 & used only 1 TBSP of oil. Next time I'll probably cut out the oil altogether. Overall it was good!

It was a bit sweet for me so I added some ground mustard additional vinegar and some lemon juice and it made it tangier. The base was fantastic and everyone loved this recipe. Whether they liked wet or drier slaw.

My only sub was celery seed for poppy seeds. It was good right away, and just as good the next day (although it got watery at the bottom, just use a slotted spoon) but OMG it is SO incredibly good!! This is the only recipe I'm ever going to make!

I made this with a couple of changes. 16oz cabbage, I large carrot shred squeezed juice out, 1/4 t pepper and because I didn't have poppy seeds, I used celery seed. This was delicious as it was, just used what I had on hand.

I made this as-is the first time but it was way too sweet, and the oil was unnecessary. I cut out the oil completely and cut the sugar in half. My family loves it now.

This coleslaw was a smidge sweeter than I’m used to, even with cutting the sugar in half. I did however also add some dried cranberries. It was absolutely delicious. Just the right amount of tang from the vinegar!

My first attempt at homemade coleslaw, and I'm 74 3/4 years old! I know, I know. I've been spoiled to Wal-Mart's deli slaw for years, and didn't think I could top it. Boy was I wrong! Followed the recipe exactly, and it's scrumptious! Will definitely make again.

The only coleslaw I feed my family! It’s the classic recipe. I don’t ever add poppy seeds, you’ll be good with half (or less) the amount of sugar, especially if using Miracle Whip, but I usually just use Hellman’s and still half the sugar! I eyeball the oil and vinegar but be careful doing that, it could definitely throw off the recipe! I make it hours before I plan to serve it and the flavors meld into some creamy and delicious coleslaw!

I suppose you can do this bought from the grocery store or use a food processor but I did the chopping by hand and it does take some extra time.  I substituted Splendid for the sugar as part of a low carb diet.  My wife put jambalaya on of it thinking that there was no rice in own diet (my son is NOT on the low carb diet) and she said it was delicious.  Go figure.  Stays fresh for a day but not much more.  Really like it when the time permits!

Have been making the recipe for years.  We went on vacation and I was making slaw and could not find this recipe nor could I remember online where I found it.  Made another slaw recipe and there was no comparison.  So glad I found this recipe again.  Every time I make it for get togethers everyone raves about how great it is and it's never any left overs!

I looked over a few reviews before making this and cut back on the sugar a tad and used celery seed because I didn't have poppy seeds.  It's an amazing coleslaw.

I know people don't like for you to change the recipe and rate it, but the website isn't allowing me to make a note of what I did so I'll have to do it here.  Sorry!
Instead of salad dressing, I used about 1/2 c of mayo and about 1/4 c of sour cream, 1/3 c sugar (instead of 1/2c), I skipped the veg. oil, and the onions and the poppy seeds and just used onion powder and black pepper.  It is AMAZING!!!  I'm just eating it alone for my lunch.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Used 2 - 14oz bags coleslaw - only 1/2 c mayo - only 1/4c sugar and used ACV. Very delicious (and not as sweet or soupy. for my taste) Everyone loved it!

I made this for the first time to take to a football tailgate. I was very pleased with the way it turned out. It was creamy and the cabbage held up well without getting soggy. Guests complimented it. I will definitely keep this recipe in my collection.

Been making this for over five years. The only thing I do differently is I shred my own red and green cabbage and carrot and I use mayo instead of miracle whip and celery seed instead of poppy and no onion. I also stopped measuring and do it by eye. I don't like cole slaw but everyone who has tried this has raved about it.

I have made this a few times.  It is really restaurant quality.  I hardly ever have buttermilk on hand because I can only get in quarts then the rest spoils in the fridg.  I use a little light cream with  the mayo and it is just as creamy as with buttermilk.  I just up the vinegar a bit and the lemon and it is delicious.  You can also use cider vinegar in place of the white wine vinegar and it won’t make much difference.

Yes it's sweet, deliciously so.  I didn't have poppy seeds so used celery seeds, and used a tbsp or so of dried onion; otherwise made it according to the recipe.  Will definitely make again.

The best cole slaw recipe I have found and have made it several times.  I suggest you follow the recipe as written even though the dressing may not seem to be "enough" and let the slaw soak/marinate overnight.  The cabbage and the dressing mixture will become more liquid and leave you with the amount  you expect.

I have been making this for years, with a couple changes for my preference. I used miracle whip, a little less sugar, an extra tbsp vinegar (I actually used raspberry blush vinegar and let me tell you, OMG... NEVER GOING BACK TO REGULAR)

I do add Craisens to everything. Best slaw I've ever had, and I hate slaw!!!

I used 1/4 cup sugar and a dollop of sour cream instead of the oil.  Excellent coleslaw!

I really enjoy this recipe, I have made it enough times to enjoy it more. 
Yes, I know we all hate hearing about the changed recipe but making it once as written and then taking advice from others really makes the recipe! So thank you others that have added your changes. 
As some others have done, I have used regular mayo and also used rice wine vinegar. I did cut the sugar down as the rice wine vinegar is a little sweet. I also added pineapple tidbits and dried cranberries and raisins.  I did not use poppy seeds, I don’t care for those in my slaw or oil.
 I definitely do not find this dry or too wet. You need to let it sit for a couple hours for it to blend all together.

I made this the other night when I BBQ some chicken leg quarters on the grill. It was fabulous! I am making it again tonight to go with some chicken salad in pocket bread. I think this is one of the best recipes for coleslaw, considering I have never personally liked it. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe! Wonderful side dish for hot summer days. I just make it now, regardless if it goes with the meal, lol. I just want it now and that is saying a lot for me.

This is my go to for bbq's everyone raves about it.  I use scallion instead of onion or sometimes leave it out all together.  I do a splash more vinegar and a couple tablespoons less sugar.

This is my favorite slaw recipe.  I send 4 lbs of it to work with my husband for there bbq days all summer per request. I usually use cider vinegar because I usually have it. Lately I have reduced the sugar a bit because we are trying to cut carbs.  I have substituted Splenda and that works too but have decided that sugar substitutes are worse than conscious use of sugar.

This is my go to recipe with minor changes. I add a little extra vinegar and omit the poppy seeds. I also substitute mayo for salad dressing because frankly I hate salad dressing! I also use Apple cider vinegar versus white. Overall a great recipe that I will continue to make!

I am very particular about my coleslaw and this was spot on! I did cut the sugar in half after reading other reviews and only used one tablespoon of oil.  Everything else as listed. Highly recommend this. A definite keeper! Thanks!

4.5 stars, in all honesty. I’ve been using this recipe as a base for near a decade now, but I actually like, and find my friends and family prefer, a little more sugar and A LOT more vinegar, salt and poppy seeds, I usually add in about 1/4 c extra sugar and 5 extra tbsp white vinegar then salt and poppy seed to taste. It’s ALWAYS a hit at family reunions and BBQs with friends!

I prefer Hellman’s light and used that. I added 1tsp of celery salt and omitted the other salt -for personal preference/taste. Great recipe! Easy and tastey.

I have made this recipe for a 100 people for each of my kids college grad parties. I make it the day ahead and It is a hit every time. It is super easy to make. I always get 1 extra bag of slaw to add in just before I serve it to soak up some of the extra juice and to give it a little crunch. I get tons of compliments on it. Thanks for the great recipe.

Gave this recipe 5-stars even though I didn’t make it as written.
That said, using it as a guide, I made the best slaw I’ve ever tasted!

I didn’t measure anything, but tasted and adjusted.
 1st I omitted oil. (Didn’t see the point)
2nd I reduced sugar by 1/2. (Salad dressing is already sweet)
Then I replaced salt and poppy with celery salt.
(If you want more tang add more vinegar, more depth of flavor add more celery salt. A good bit of fresh ground pepper helps as well.)

Put in a container that you can drain off excess liquid because slaw mix will sweat out water after 4+ hours dressed.

Now I just make it an evening before I plan to eat some and drain it the next day.

Very good recipe but a tad sweet if made as written. I added a 1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon of sugar and that was perfect for my Family’s taste. I also used celery seed instead of poppy seeds and sliced my own cabbage, radishes and carrots to make slaw mix. Great recipe for BBQ, fast, easy and make ahead.

Everybody liked it. I'll cut the salad dressing in half next time. I used half as many poppy seeds and it was perfect.  It was delicious and actually did remind me of KFC. I will make this again.

This is SOOOOO good! But from the first time I made it ( I have made it 100 times!) I added a little green pepper and celery seeds instead of poppy seeds. Just a preference. I love poppy seeds too, so I think it is the perfect blend of mayo, oil, vinegar, sugar, that makes it so good. Thank you Sandi! Delish!!!

I love this slaw recipe- turns out delicious each time. Make sure you have small diced onions and plenty of time to chill, and toss again right before serving. I serve this slaw on top of Slow Cooker Pulled Pork (allrecipe by Livie’s Mommy) and the combination is a hit in my family. Both recipes taste like they take much more time than they truly do- about 20 minutes total for me earlier in the day, and dinner is ready as soon as we get home that night.

This is a great basic coleslaw recipe. You may want to cut the sugar or oil to taste. I prefer my slaw light on dressing, so I typically add twice the shredded cabbage and use one grated small sweet onion (about 1/2 a cup), and I drain the excess water after it’s chilled at least 2 hours. This slaw is a great side or topping to just about anything. Crunchy deliciousness worth keeping on hand all the time!

amazing flavor.  Just the recipe I have been looking for and I have been making cole slaw for many years.  Best recipe! I made it as a side for  cheesy tuna and noodles!  Awesome together, however, I did cut down my own recipe and added sugar to taste and came up with less than the recipe called for!  Perfect as a side dish!

Everyone raves about this recipe!
A few modifications I've developed.
Double the onion
Cut the sugar to 1/4 c 
Double the poppy seeds.
Add a pinch or marjoram to give it a bit more flavour.

If you want to make a spicier version add some Montreal Steak Seasoning.  Particularly good when served with the sweeter BBQ items like pulled pork, etc.

My family raved about this!  I left the oil out completely and cut the sugar back a little and it was still plenty sweet.  Next time I won't put all of the dressing on, maybe 3/4 and then see if it needs more when I serve it as it had too much liquid.  Nobody seemed to mind though and everyone wanted the leftovers to take home.  Two weeks later, my boyfriend is still talking about it.

This is a delicious cole slaw. Like other reviewers I cut down the sugar. If you use what the recipe calls for I think it would be much too sweet. Another tip, if you wash your bagged cole slaw make sure it's completely dry or your cole slaw will be watery.

Awesome taste!  I was making this for a football banquet so I omitted the onion and poppy seeds.  I did not have vegetable oil,  so I used a liquid coconut cooking oil, unflavored/odorless and it came out magnificent!    This could very easily be converted to a keto friendly recipe using erytheritol instead of sugar!  I am hooked!

This is absolutely amazing! I am so picky about coleslaw but this literally tastes like KFC! It is so good, I always get compliments from everyone who eats it and they always ask me for the recipe.

I have made this many times although I sometimes try different variations I think that it's best to review the recipe as it's listed. It's a definite crowd pleaser and is great with BBQ and fried fish.

Delicious! I always try these recipes “as written” and then tweak them to our family’s tastes. Didn’t have to change a thing. This was yummy and very easy to make. I even shredded my own cabbage and carrots and it took no time at all.

We really liked this coleslaw. Didn't have any white vinegar so used cider vinegar. Also used celery seeds instead of poppy.  I thought it would benefit from  more seasoning, salt and pepper.  Cut down the sugar measurement it still was plenty sweet.

I brought this slaw to a friends for  a barbecue. It was a hit!!  I did listen to previous reviews and cut back a little on the sugar. Other than that I  made it as directed. For me it's a keeper.

Too sweet. Definitely cut back on the sugar, since Miracle Whip is already sweetened mayonnaise.  Side note, this should absolutely NOT be included in a search for no mayo slaws, since it contains a mayonnaise.

However, if you're searching for a traditional slaw, here you go.  Cut back on the sugar and you're golden.  Also a bit more pepper is tasty.

Very good with a couple substitutes. I made this with real mayo, celery salt & fennel seeds instead of salt and celeery seeds, rice wine and sesame oil instead of vegetable oil, and to cut down on sugar and sweetness i replaced 1/2 the sugar with 1/8 tsp Sweet Leaf Stevia Extract.

This was a big hit at a family luncheon.  However I made just a couple of changes.  I added a yellow bell pepper, some radishes for color and instead of poppy seeds I added sesame seeds because I had them on hand.  The dressing was really good. I will probably make this again for a gathering.

I was looking to make a new slaw and decided this sounded too good to pass up. Other than using celery seed instead of poppy seed I made this exactly as written and it was amazing. Definitely the best slaw I've ever had! Can't wait to make it again. Thanks for sharing.

Everybody loved the recipe! 
I doubled the recipe (16) servings.   I recipe called for 1 cup of sugar.  I used a a little more than 1/2 cup, as per recommendation of other reviews.     I am happy that I did, in fact next time I will only use 1/4 cup of sugar.

I did make a couple of changes.  I reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup.  I added celery seed and mustard seed along with a TBSP of Dijon mustard.  I didn't have bagged slaw so I shredded a small head of cabbage I had on hand.  I also shredded a jalapeno, carrots with the slaw.  I used half/half mayo and miracle whip and used a glob of sour cream instead of the oil as suggested.  Delish!!!

I cut the sugar in half. I  used Braag's apple cider vinegar because it's what I had on hand, and followed the instructions exactly. It is just the best.  I read other reviews on the high sugar content and they were right.  Other than that its a flawless and delicious.

Buying coleslaw at the deli gets expensive, so I was determined to try and make my own. I tried this recipe after reading the great reviews and my family loved it! I took others advice and cut the sugar back to just a 1/4 cup and it turned sweet and tangy, just how we like it! Will definitely make this again!

Flavor is great but there is way too much dressing though. I cut my dressing in half and prepared it the day before. By the next morning, the cabbage was liquidy enough that I didn't need any more sauce.

Pretty good- I didn't use any oil, or poppy seeds, used real mayo, reduced sugar by almost half- (still used a half cup, but my cabbage was very large), used 1 large head of cabbage, 4 large carrots, 1 green pepper, and 1 onion all shredded in the food processer,  and added 1/2 small jar of horseradish. I also used twice the amount of apple cider vinegar, and added some black pepper. I will use this recipe as my base recipe from now on...:)

This is really good coleslaw, but too sweet as is. I'd recommend reducing the sugar to 1/8th a cup and increasing as needed per individual taste. I also left out the oil...I don't know why you would need that.

I've made this on numerous occasions. I always get compliments and requests  for the recipe.  It is a simple and easy recipe to make.  Tonight I used a broccoli slaw instead of cole slaw it was a hit at the cookout.  I find it's lots tastier if you let it sit overnight in the refrigerator.

I like sweet slaw but this was REALLY sweet!  If you like that, then you'll like this dish.  It was just too much for me personally.  If you don't love sweet slaw, then this probably isn't the dish for you.  I followed the recipe exactly.

I have made this several times.  I use a little less mayo,  a little less sugar and a little more vinegar, omit the oil,  and use celery seed.    I know it's not fair  to change up a recipe and then review it.  I love the combination of all of the ingredients, I just adjust slightly.    I have made this as is and it was really tasty, as well.

I loved this slaw, and so did my family.  However, I think it calls for too much sauce.  I used half the sauce with the 16 oz. bag of coleslaw mix and it was perfect!

The first time I made this I followed the recipe. We liked it a lot!  The second time I made it I added 5oz shredded carrots, 4oz broccoli slaw, 1/2 finely chopped sweet onion,and 1/2 cup chopped craisins. To the dressing I substituted champagne vinegar. It was delicious. I have made it many more times this way for family and company. Everyone loves it and asks for the recipe!!!

I love this recipe! I never buy premade salad dressings anymore! Instead of salt, I use celery salt and add celery seed as well. I use Veganaise instead of regular mayo and cut the sugar in half. I also add shredded carrots to the mix as well, for extra crunch.

I've been looking for this recipe for all of my cooing life.  It's just perfect.  Followed the recipe exactly...well used white wine vinegar because that's what I had, but that wasn't niecessary.  The slaw kept in fridge for several days and it will now be a stable addition to our salad menu.

This is a great recipe. The base recipe is just a little sweet, so I added extra vinegar to balance sweet with tangy. I would also recommend being generous with salt.

This is the coleslaw recipe I've been looking for forever.  It takes just like the coleslaw from the small town chicken restaurant where I grew up.  Definitely comfort food, and a family favourite.

I used half  Mayonais and half Miracle whip and half the sugar.  It is very tasty!  I will definitely make it often.

This was amazing, only 4 stars because I tweaked it. I used Miracle Whip, which is plenty sweet, so I omitted the sugar. Also added a thinly sliced pepper, a pinch of salt, and a half teaspoon of celery salt. So good!! The only thing is that next time, I will pulse the cabbage mix  in the food processor to get it smaller, and the texture a little more "mushy."

I used only 1/3 cup of sugar and let it sit in a covered bowl overnight. It was fabulous. I served it on top of pulled BBQ chicken for a marvelous sandwich. Thanks for the easy and delicious recipe!

I must admit that I HATE cole slaw..  but I made it for a party. And this was my first attempt at making cole slaw, ever. I didn't have poppy seeds and used Duke's Mayo instead of Miracle  whip, and threw in more onions that it called for; otherwise, I followed the directions.  I made it the night before and was worried it wouldn't turn out.  The next day, it looks liked cole slaw was supposed to look. I tasted it and it was really good.  It was a huge hit and went perfectly with pulled BBQ chicken.   I will make this again!

Dec. 25 2016 Other than cutting the sugar back to 1/3 cup I made this as written and I'm so glad that I did. We absolutely loved this and it got five stars from everyone. There was a ton of food and this was the only dish that was cleaned.  My guests kept saying "just one more spoonful." I don't make cole slaw very often but when I do this will be my go to recipe.

I followed this recipe exactly as is. There is no "improving" needed !! THE BEST coleslaw I've ever tasted !! Too bad that I only got 2 bites of it before it was completely devoured by a large and appreciative crew of guests !!!!

Made it  as written the first time except used celery seed instead of the poppy seeds because that's what I had on hand. It's delicious. The only change I have made since making the original was to add about a Tsp of mustard. I make this at least twice a month year round.

I've made this cole slaw for almost every occasion, family dinners, family gatherings, work pot lucks, BBQs, graduation parties, etc., and EVERY time it's been a HUGE hit. It's always the first thing gone. I've had people say to me, "I don't eat cole slaw, but I love your cole slaw." Thanks for this fantastic recipe!

We really liked this recipe. But I only gave it 4 stars because I had to make some alterations. I used half the sugar it called for...and we still felt it was too sweet. For some extra pizzazz I added a few squirts of sriracha sauce which gave a nice balance to the sweet! Overall this is a great base recipe to use when your creative and want to customize your slaw.

I doubled the recipe using 2 bags of slaw mix. Next time I would use 2 bags of slaw and not double the dressing. It was very runny but great flavor. Using a slotted spoon worked great. 
Thank you for sharing and saved for future use.

Very good and versatile I subbed raspberry vinegar for white and reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup. I have a broccoli/cauliflower salad with a similar dressing and I think I will use this dressing going forward it is a little lighter and better tasting.

Made it again and used light miracle whip and Splenda sugar blend in place of regular sugar.  Was delicious again!

My husband and I both liked it.  He usually only likes slaw floating in mayo or salad dressing.  I will make it again.

I would actually give it 4 1/2, because the sugar needs to be cut in half. I had to add a few dribbles of vinegar to cut back on the sweetness.
 That being said, it's awesome cole slaw!

Wow...cut the sugar in half and used celery seed instead of the poppy seed, used Hellman's Original mayo, and this is the best coleslaw ever!  So good...just like restaurant, only better!!!

I shredded raw cabbage, I think it was half a head, used Hellmans mayonnaise, and omitted the poppy seeds.Otherwise, I followed the instructions. My dad who rarely comments on food said something like "this is really good". I will definitely be making this again.

I  have made this cole slaw 3 times now and have enjoyed it each time. The only adjustment I have made was using basic mayonnaise instead of a sweet salad dressing or Miracle Whip. I found the sugar content to be enough and it kept the recipe more basic and not overpowering with flavor. Personal preference:  I use a little less of its ingredients as well because I prefer my cole slaws less creamy. Wonderful recipe...especially with poppy's!

My husband does not like coleslaw but he likes this one and brags on it. I did reduce the sugar and increased the onions. I also used mayo and red wine vinegar instead of what it called for. I also left out the oil and poppy seeds. Just didn't think the oil was needed.

I made this coleslaw recipe tonight. Even before it had gone to the fridge I tried it and it was the best ever.  Even my husband who is picky about coleslaw loved it.  I had to make two substitutions one was Mayo for the Miracle Whip and the other was Celery Seed for the Poppy Seed.  Just a note, I am not a Miracle Whip fan so I put the Mayo in.  My husband hates Mayo but never even noticed....it's that good a recipe.  Thanks for posting it!

Will definitely make again! Used 1 and a half small fresh cabbages from the farmers market, mixing red and green. Farm fresh carrots are key as well! Found it made a huge amount of sauce after sitting in the fridge, so I added more cabbage to balance it out.

Delicious and creamy. I made this exactly as the recipe stated. Held up nicely without wilting for a few days. I grated the cabbage and carrots as well because it grates finer and tastes better than bagged. Will keep this on file.

LOVE this!!! Took some suggestions from reviewers to make it work with what we had around. Added a little extra rice vinegar, cut down just a little on sugar, subbed celery seed for poppy seed, and used some mustard powder. Used mayo instead of miracle whip. This recipe is a great place to start then customize to your likes / cupboard!

This is really delicious. I made a few small changes based on what I had, but I pretty much made it as written. I used rice vinegar and regular mayo. I also cut down on the sugar--used less than 1/3 cup but more than 1/4. It is chilling right now...can't wait to have it with the ribs my husband is grilling.  Thanks for the recipe. I love good cole slaw!

Nearly perfect recipe, almost exactly how my mom makes it! My only changes were to cut the sugar by half, add a teaspoon of fresh ground pepper, and a little over 1/2 cup of shredded apple.

Sweet restaurant coleslaw was the very best. I have not been a big fan of slaw but I loved this and my family did also.  Usually I bought store bought. I only made one change and that was to use 1/4 cup of sugar and it was perfect with fish. I will definitely make this again. Thanks Sandi.           Trixy

This is my go to Cole slaw recipe. The only changes are  using 1\4 cup of sugar instead of 1\2 and you have to let is sit after mixing for a minimum of 3 hrs (in the fridge)...love it!

Made this as directed the first time and it was wonderful and liked by all.  The second time I cut the sugar in half - it was not missed and will definitely make this way in the future.  Had to substitute red wine vinegar for white this time which worked equally well.  Seems dry at first but is plenty wet with a little time and tossing.  Great with mayo instead of miracle whip.

Finally a recipe that tastes like the real thing.  Suggest adding the sugar gradually to taste.  Greek yogurt is an alternative to oil - adds some fat content as well as tang.

Very good! I used half the sugar called for, and will probably use even less next time. I didn't use poppy seeds, meant to use celery seed as advised by other reviews but found I was out, and used a bit of celery salt instead of plain salt. I might use a bit more celery salt next time. It was very good after a couple hours in the fridge, but even better the next day.

This is as good as advertised.  I added a bit of fresh basil and some finely chopped kale to the coleslaw mix to give it better color.  I also added 1/2 tsp. some fresh ground black pepper to the dressing to give it a little kick.

I've made this several times.  I cut back on the sugar because it was too sweet the first time I made it.  The rest of the ingredients I kept the same.  This is really, really good.

Good recipe but a bit too sweet for my taste. Thus the 4-star rating. The second time around I cut the sugar in half, used a little less mayo because I didn't like it so creamy, and used a tad more vinegar. You can modify the ingredients to your own liking, but this was perfect for me.

I make this for every BBQ we do ( smoked brisket, Pulled pork, Ribs, etc..) , and I always get complimented on my slaw.  I use splenda instead of sugar, and cut way back on that.  It doesn't need much.  I also add a 1/2 teaspoon of Celery Seed to the dressing WITH the poppy seed.   And a little course ground black pepper.  Always a hit.

Excellent.  I left out onions & poppy seeds, because I didn't have either! I used mayo (not a big fan of Miracle Whip it is a bit sweet) and cut the sugar in half. I also used coarse ground pepper. Tasted great. We ate it all.

Five stars, with alterations suggested by other reviewers. I used Rice Wine Vinegar, real Mayo, and cut back on the sugar slightly.  I also added a cup of diced onion instead of 2 tablespoons and I really adore how it blends with the other ingredients.

I followed the recipe as written but omitted the onions. My husband loved it, because it reminded him of KFC's coleslaw.  The coleslaw was sweet and creamy. Be sure to refrigerate a few hours before serving.

I've been searching for a sweet version of cole slaw and this one is perfect! Will be using it many times! I took another reviewer's suggestion and used a dallop of sour cream instead of the vegetable oil and it was oh so good.

Very good! At first I thought there wouldn't be enough dressing but it was perfect.  I added some minced garlic to the dressing and some pepper. I also used Truvia for the sugar. Next time I will omit the salt since it was a bit too salty for me. Thanks!

I will make it again. I may try adding pineapple, next time. My Dad was famous in the neighborhood for his recipe and if anyone had to have a dish to pass, the neighbors would ask him to make this for them.  However, he passed away before I was bright enough to ask for  the recipe. His "secret  ingredient", was pineapple.

We have been using this recipe for years now. Best slaw dressing I have ever had. I do not use any kinds of Veg oil so we sub with pure olive oil and I use JFG mayo (BEST mayo ever!!) I also use apple cider vinegar and never use the poppy seeds, just never have them on hand. I just add a bit of fresh ground black pepper.

This is a fantastic coleslaw! I made it exactly as it is in the recipe and it turned out great. Next time I will chop up the cabbage mixture though because I like them to be smaller.

This was yummy.  However, the quantity of sugar makes this practically as sweet as a dessert. I would make it again but with 1/4 or 1/3 cup sugar. Also I like cole slaw a bit more tangy so I would add a little more vinegar and cut down a tad on the Mayo. Overall, a really simple and tasty recipe.

I can finally make cole slaw!!  I used  a little almond milk to thin it out and a couple of packets of Stevia instead of the sugar.  Thank you for the great recipe!

I made it almost exactly as the recipe states. I cut down slightly on the mayo. Just because I simply don't like mayo. And I used real mayonnaise not miracle whip. I cut back slightly on the sugar. Added an extra tablespoon of white vinegar & a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar. We like it tangier than we do creamier. And I accidentally added more poopy seeds...the holes on the poppy seed shaker were bigger than I imagined! We used this to top a pulled pork bbq sandwich and it was fantastic. I will use this recipe every time I make coleslaw. Yummy!

I prefer other slaw recipes over this one. Not really sure why, but I think if I had left out the oil, I would have liked it better.

I am not a lover of Cole slaw because I cannot find one that I like.  But finally I found it.  Made one change, used Seasoned rice vinegar instead of white vinegar.  It was GREAT!

I made this just as the recipe says.  It was great.  The first time I served it my guests wanted to know where I bought it.  The poppy seeds add the finishing touch on this great coleslaw.  One key is to NOT add too much carrot.  I think the carrot just adds a little color to the cabbage.  This makes it eye appealing.  I'm recommending this recipe and give it 5 stars.

The best dressing I've ever had! Or use the celery seed instead of poppyseed and added an extra bit of flavor. This is definitely a keeper and on top of my list for the summer.

It's a good base.  I started with homemade mayo-  the flavor is so much better and no mystery ingredients.  I'm glad I listened to other reviewers and cut back the sugar.  Used only 1/4 cup and it was still way too sweet.   I kept increasing the vinegar until the balance was the way I like it-  probably 1/4 cup total.  I also increased the onion to about 1/4 cup as well and used 1 teaspoon celery seed instead of poppy.  It's already fantastic!  I can't wait to try it out on my family tomorrow!

Easy and yummy.  Not exactly the same taste as KFC but better. Didn't have onions on hand so I used a little onion powder and celery powder.  Still yummy.

As written, 3 stars. Don't add so much sugar and it's five stars.
The flavor was good but it was WAY too sweet.

Made this today.  Very good.  I needed to mix the sauce together a little longer than I did, to melt the sugar better...but it's just about the same as my mother in law's....and the onion amount is just right.  It can overpower sometimes, but this is just right.  I used olive oil, and Hellman's mayonnaise, and didn't put poppy seeds in it - because my kids freak at stuff like that.  I'll use this always now.  Thanks!

I made it  exactly as the recipe the first time except celery seed instead of poppy, made it with the onion but some people didn't like onion taste so i've made it multiple times now without the onion, with mayo and poppy seed .. i've used the serving adjustment on the page to make 3 times the amount for parties with a 3 pound bag of slaw from Sams club..its sweet but thats what i wanted, i don't like more vinegary coleslaw...tastes especially great on top of pulled pork BBQ...

It was very good but way to sweet. I used regular mayo in stead. It was super good the second go around with mayo. This is my go to recipe for coleslaw now.

You can cut sugar by 1/3 or even in half, I bet. I think it will still be delicious! Omitted the poppy seeds.

As is this is only 3 stars and I made it exactly as written. If I make again I willhalve the sugar. I ended up adding extra vinegar and real mayo to make it more palatable. It made way too much sauce. Edit - I made this a few more times because my bf really enjoys it. I do tweak it to my tastes but it is a good recipe.

My hubby is VERY fussy about Coleslaw. He doesn't like onion in it but I do! Don't let the 2T diced onion bother you. Even my husband thought this slaw was delicious. Tx for a great recipe that I will use over & over & over. SO GOOD. Made with exact ingredients called for.  After saying that, my hubby & I  decided we want a little less sugar in next one (maybe 1/3C).  Also, I  did put only half of dressing on initially  (as suggested by one reviewer), refrigerated about 1 hr, then drained some of the juice. I then added the rest of dressing. EXCELLENT. After 28 yrs of marriage, I found a Coleslaw we both love. Tx so much. A keeper.

Excellent recipe! I do cut back on the sugar (1/4c), use 1/2c Hellmans instead of 2/3c and cut out 1 T oil to make it a LITTLE more healthy.

I used chopped chives instead of onion since raw onion is harsh for my stomach. I also liked the way it made the slaw more colorful. I used red wine vinegar and cut the sugar in half. Will make it again very soon.

Great sauce on this one! Its important to add a little of the sauce at a time, stir to incorporate and then just add little by little until you get the ratio of sauce you desire. This did have a strong Miracle Whip flavor to me, but no one else that ate it noticed - everyone loved it and said it was very yummy! So id consider it a hit!

I have grown up on and mastered many southern delicacies and this recipe is on point! I used mayo ( its a southern thing) and a bit more vinegar added a half teaspoon of black pepper and its was ready for any BBQ picnic or Sunday dinner. TIP: Top you pulled pork sandwiches with the slaw!

I will definitely make again. I used fresh cabbage and carrots and I did add to the recipe. I added fresh cracked pepper and 1/4 of a lemon's squeezed juice. Best slaw I have ever had, and my family agreed.

This was very good if you like really sweet coleslaw (I do!). When I first mixed everything, there was hardly enough mayo-mixture to coat it. I was concerned, but left it as-is and put it in the fridge. When I took it out a couple of hours later, everything was positively dripping with the mixture! Not sure what happens in the fridge, but it definitely works out. This could likely be made with less sugar if you wanted to be healthier.

Good slaw if you like it sweet.  I cut the sugar in half and it was just right.  I will make this again, but will also continue looking for an alternate recipe that is more tangy than sweet.

Delicious!  I did what others suggested.  I cut the sugar to 1/3 cup, used celery seed instead of poppy seed, and didn't add oil.  Plenty sweet and moist.  This is the only recipe I'll follow now!

I made this exactly as stated,except used Duke's mayo.  I tasted after making and was sweet, but i did not need till  next day. the "sweetness" settled and this slaw was EXCELLENT..!!!! This North Carolina gal will only use this recipe from now on. As I stated it is sweet when first made, but i made this the day before i needed it and stirred maybe twice in 24 hours and the all the ingredients came together..

Very good, but must be eaten by the next day - it gets too liquidy as it sits. I used a little less than 2/3 cup Miracle Whip and reduced the oil to 2 TBSP.  I took the suggestion of others and cut the sugar in half, and it was just sweet enough. I used celery seed instead of poppy (personal preference), and added about 1/8 tsp black pepper. Next time I will add a little more vinegar (and maybe try using apple cider vinegar), as I like my slaw a little more tangy.

Made it exact except I had to sub Hellman's for the Miracle Whip. Like others said, next time I will cut the sugar a bit as it is slightly on the sweet side. Very good flavor and will definitely make again.

This is a delicious cole slaw recipe! Better than any fast food slaw. I did make a few changes after reading other reviews , just to suit my personal taste. I decreased the sugar to 1/3 cup, oil decreased to just 1 tbsp. and vinegar increased to 3 tbsp. I finely grated sweet onion. Mixed all ingredients and refrigerated over night. Gave everything a stir this morning and did a taste test...Yummy! Next time I make this, I will substitute celery seeds for the poppy seeds.

This is the best slaw and it tastes great one pulled pork. Every time I make it people ask for the recipe. The only change I make is reducing the sugar.  Thanks for sharing!

I did make a little less dressing and used more cole slaw.  I also added the cole slaw just before serving.  Slaw was crunch and dressing was just enough to cover well.  Definitely will make this again.

FABULOUS!! This is THE BEST creamy cole slaw recipe I have ever made.  My family claims this recipe as a "keeper!". I followed the recipe except used mayo instead of miracle whip, and used about 2T less sugar.  Definitely not too sweet.

Great slaw! I use splenda vs sugar, celery seed vs poppy, and 1/3 of the Miracle whip i substitute nonfat plain greek yogurt to keep down the calories. I make this at least a few times a month. It's great for lunches that don't have to be heated.

Great Coleslaw - I, too, prefer my coleslaw a little less sweet, however, I followed the recipe exactly and it was a big hit at our 4th of July BBQ. Will make again. Thank you.

This recipe is delicious! The only thing I changed was added celery seed instead of poppy seed, that's what I had on hand.  It was delicious and I make this several times a month to keep on hand for an easy side dish when making burgers, hot dogs, grilled chicken, etc. Thanks for sharing!

Made this for July 4, everyone loved it! I used chopped salad instead of the traditional coleslaw mix. It does get really soupy after it sits , I added another bag of chopped salad. I also decreased the sugar a bit.

This is now my go to recipe for cole slaw. Yes, it is sweet, but isn't it supposed to be sweet? However, after it sits and draws the liquid out of the cabbage, it is very soupy.  To solve that, I increase the cabbage (or shredded cole slaw mix). Today I used two 16 ounce bags. It tastes fine and isn't runny.  It's perfect to take to a Father's Day picnic!

EXCELLENT!  The only changes I made were to trade the Miracle Whip with Duke's mayo, the 2 TBSP diced onion with 2 tsp minced/dehydrated onion, increased vinegar to 1-1/2 TBSP and traded the poppy seed with celery seed.  It was absolutely delicious alone and on top of my pulled pork sandwich.  Will DEFINITELY make this again.

Best cole slaw I ever made - really does taste like my favorite from KFC!  
I've made it since the first time, when I followed the recipe exactly as written.  These are the changes I now make to tweak it to my liking..... I think it only needs 1/4 c of sugar, and it's still plenty sweet, and I add a few more ounces of cabbage because I think it's just a bit much dressing for the amount of cabbage.  I absolutely love it!  Give it a try because it's so easy!   I use my Ninja food chopper to chop the cabbage with a  bit of carrot, and then empty it into a bowl.  Then I mix up the dressing in the chopper to mix everything easily and throughly before pouring it over the cabbage mix.

My favorite slaw is a national chain's slaw which is outrageously expensive considering cabbage is relatively cheap.  I made this recipe today I did add celery seed instead of poppy seeds because I like the flavor other than that I made is written and it was absolutely delicious and an exact copy of my favorite.  Thank you for this recipe it will be my go to for a creamy cole slaw recipe.  It did make lots of dressing so I could have used two bags of slaw mix as Saveur did and it would be perfect.

Great recipe! After reading other reviews, I used mayo and celery seed in place of Miracle Whip and poppy seeds. I also added finely diced red and yellow peppers alone with the onions. This is my first time making coleslaw, so no more deli/fast food chains, I can make it myself!

This is now my go-to recipe for coleslaw.  So yummy.  As is its a 4.5 star, with my changes its a 5. My changes include using mayo instead of miracle whip and used 1/3 cup of sugar instead of 1/2 cup.  I made it both ways and the miracle whip way was too sweet.  I love this recipe and will make this anytime I'm making bbq! Thanks for the recipe.

So good!  I love coleslaw but never found a recipe I liked.  Did not have sour cream, did not add onion and only added 1/3 cup of sugar as do not like too sweet.  Used apple cider vinegar, Hellman's mayo and celery seed instead of poppy.   This is a keeper!

Decided to give this high rated slaw a try.  I used real mayo instead of the suggested creamy salad dressing. I also cut the sugar to 1/3 cup. I didn't have poppy seeds so I added a dash of black coarse pepper. It turned out AMAZING!! My husband and I  LOVED it. I served it along side BBQ pulled pork sandwiches. It is definitely a keeper!!

I read the reviews, but forgot to cut the sugar by about 1/2 as advised by many reviewers. My husband said it was too sweet, but I liked it.  I agree with my husband that the dressing was too sweet, but it was still very, very good, for my taste--not my hubby's.

I knew 1/2 cup of sugar would be too sweet for me so I cut it back to 1/4 cup and it was just right for me and family.  I also used only 1 T. of oil and 1/2 t. each of celery seed and poppy seed.  My whole family loved the healthier changes to the recipe. This is now my go to recipe for coleslaw.

I've been looking for a sweet slaw recipe for a long time.  I finally found it. It is delicious.  My family loved it.  You definitely need to let it rest for a few hours before serving to let the sugar fully dissolve.

I HAVE to review this recipe.  I have never reviewed a recipe before, yet have used this site for years.  I had to chuckle that almost 1800 people had taken the time to review COLE SLAW!  However, make it I did for a family function.  I received compliment after compliment on it.  This amazed me.... I mean, Cole Slaw is Cole Slaw! I made it exactly as written.  I read multiple reviews, some suggested making it the night before, others cautioned against this. I chose to do both.  I mixed the dressing (and added the onions directly to the dressing) the night before.  I was a bit apprehensive as I poured it over the slaw a mere 3 hours before it was ready to be served, but it was perfect by serving time. I did change one thing.  I made it with half celery seed and half poppy seed.  I will be making this VERY easy dish many times in the future!

Made this to go with some BBQ chicken and worked with whole veggies rather than the cole slaw mix. Used some finely sliced cabbage and shredded carrot and it turned out like a dream. I used mayonnaise rather than Miracle Whip as well and it wasn't excessively sweet. Used a bit more than the recipe calls for, but I wasn't strict on the quantity of veggies. In any case, it turned out great. Added to my recipe box and this will be one I return to when I need some slaw.

My husband loves it. 
I now make it different from the recipe that is here, but only altering it to a more paleo mayo and a palm sugar for a healthier approach- and it is still fantastic

I shredded my own cabbage, radishes, carrots, etc, and used a lot more than 16 ounces, but then again, we don't like it too juicy.  Very yummy. Used mayo and celery seed instead of Miracle Whip and poppy seeds. Added radishes and extra onion.

My family loves this cole slaw...  It's so easy to make - there is really no reason to buy it packaged with all of those awful preservatives.  I do make a couple of changes for my preference...  I cut the sugar in half and only add 1/4 cup (still very sweet)...  And I only use 2 tbs of oil....  I will keep making this one!

Best cole slaw ever. I used generic miracle whip and a small bit of fat free mayo when I ran out of miracle whip. The only other change was no poppy seeds. Excellent recipe!

I was looking for something more like KFC slaw, so I put in more Miracle whip than stated, maybe 1/4 cup more, and a few more tablespoons of Splenda. Tasted much more like KFC slaw!

I'm not a coleslaw fan, but I thought I would try this with some pulled pork sandwiches we were having. The only difference is I used mayonnaise because I didn't have any Miracle Whip, and I omitted the poppy seeds. Yum!

This was too sweet for me, surprisingly. I'll cut the sugar next time. I used celery seed in place of poppy seeds.

I made this coleslaw and it was delicious. Actually didn't have enough to go around! I omitted the onion just because my friend doesn't care for them, but I added raisins and a pinch of celery seed instead of poppyseed. Next time I'll make more! Thanks

Made this last night with dinner. Not sure if it is because I don't usually use Miracle Whip but I have another recipe that I like better. My husband is a coleslaw critic and he did like it. So I probably will make again since he liked it.

Not bad, especially for someone like me who doesn't really care for slaw.  A little on the sweet side, but not so sweet that I wouldn't eat it.

I always throw the onion and coleslaw together in one bowl and the dressing in another and throw both the bowls in the fridge until my fish and fries are done cooking and then mix the dressing into the coleslaw right when everything is ready and its always fresh and taste great! I love the sweetness and the poppy seeds!

I have searched many recipes for slaw, and this one is by far the best I have found so far!!! I am not a fan of Miracle Whip, so i used Hellmans instead, and also added a bit of celery seed...it was delicious!!!!

Best cole slaw I have ever made.  Such a great base recipe.  I tend to try to make things a little more on the healthy side so I made a few changes.  I used light Miracle Whip, I also replaced the oil with light sour cream.  I didn't have poppy seeds so I used celery seed and I cut the sugar to 1/3 cup and found that was plenty sweet enough.  I also used white rice wine vinegar as another reviewer suggested (I didn't have white vinegar on hand).  My boyfriend LOVED this recipe so much I made it twice in 2 days.  Definitely a keeper!!

Maybe this has been said but the bags of coleslaw cabbage I buy are 14 oz. Not 16. 

Otherwise love this recipe. I do cut back on all ingredients or add more cabbage.

Very good! (With a few adjustments) I shredded a head of lettuce and added some shredded carrot instead of using the bagged mix. I used real mayo, rice vinegar, and 1/3 cup sugar. Finally I substituted celery seed for poppy seed. The recipe turned out great! My husband - who is very picky when it comes to coleslaw loved this version.

This is really yummy, but I only gave it 3 stars since it was only good with some changes made. First I grated fresh green cabbage, red cabbage, and carrots.  I grated around 1lb 6 oz , so a little over the recommended amount.  I  used mayonnaise rather than miracle whip & only used 1/4 cup of sugar.  The mixture was sweet enough with half the amount of sugar.  Once these changes were made it was very good!

I LOVE this slaw recipe.  Every time I make it we get great reviews.  I think the single batch is perfect but cut back on the sugar if I double it for larger events & no one notices a difference in flavor.  My husband smokes a lot of meat and this (along with Grandma's Buttermilk Cornbread recipe also from this site) make the perfect dinner.

Made this for dinner tonight. Its now chilling in the fridge. I used mayo instead of Miracle Whip. Cut the sugar in 1/2 as recommended in other reviews. Didn't add the poppy seeds because we had a dish with them last night. After tasting, I added a splash more vinegar and pepper. I recommend tasting the dressing before adding to the slaw. You want to have the chance to adjust the flavor to your liking. Pretty sure its going to be a hit at dinner.

I have made this recipe many times in the past 3 or so months since I discovered it. I love it. I've made it exactly as written, and it's a delicious, 5-star recipe. However, I have developed my own twist. I always use a whole red onion because it's so pretty, olive oil, raw sugar and apple cider vinegar. To my family, these changes really make this recipe come alive. I also prefer to make it the day before and let it sit overnight, as the flavours are so much better the next day.

Not a fan of coleslaw in general, but this was so good!  I took it to a 4th of July party and the guests were raving about it.  Only change was adding a little more onion and dry mustard.

Note:  Decrease sugar to 1/4 cup and increase vinegar to 2 Tbs and increase poppy seed to 2 Tsp.

Excellent flavor.  Not to creamy.

I have made this many time....it is my go to recipe.  Easy and delicious.  My husband and sons love it-even the picky son.  I usually make it exactly as written and it is perfect.  You can add raisins, dried cranberries or diced pineaplle if you want to change it up.  Thanks for the recipe!

I've been using this recipe for the last 3-4 years, and I love it!  I never have poppy seeds on hand, so I substitute celery seeds, and I double the amount of coleslaw.  Comes out perfect every time!  :)

Amazing!  It was delicious even before chilling.  I added a small amount of grated carrot i had left in the fridge to amp up the colour factor a bit. Everyone raved about it!

I don't care for poppy seeds, so I also used celery and did cut the amount of sugar (Splenda) in half. Any time a recipe calls for either mayo or Miracle Whip, I use half of each to cut down on an overwhelming taste. Both were "light" but the finished product tastes great. Making the dressing early and letting it marry before mixing in the slaw kept it from getting runny. Thanks so much for the recipe!

I'll tell you what...I run a BBQ Catering business & I had about given up on serving slaw. I refuse to buy ready made and I just could not find a recipe that I liked. This slaw has been a bit of a lesson for me...as for myself, I can hardly eat it...it is waaay too sweet.

The customers on the other hand, have attacked it. I have served it 4 times now and always get lots of positive comments...and none left. I actually watched one guy come back for thirds.  'Nuff said:-)

The last batch I did cut back the sugar by about a third. Still sweet but nobody complained.

This slaw comes out perfect every time I make it! But I have found that the longer you can leave it in the fridge the better it tastes. Also, I found that using angle hair slaw (Finely shredded cabbage) tastes the best!

Terrific!  I did adjust a bit because of my family's taste. I greatly reduced the sugar (to 1 Tablespoon) used only half of the oil, and I added an additional tablespoon of vinegar. I loved it! I think using the Miracle Whip instead of regular Mayo did the trick as well as the poppy seeds. I've made this many times now. My family loved it like this.

This recipe is perfect! You MUST use miracle whip (or store equivalent) as the recipe calls for in order for this to turn out perfect, mayo will not cut it! I have made it dozens of times and it is always a hit! I have also used a broccoli slaw instead of cabbage for this recipe with wonderful results. I rarely add the poppy seeds to keep this recipe more "budget-friendly", and I dont really miss them. I have also omitted the onion before for an anti-onion dinner guest, or when I didnt have it on hand, and though it still turns out well you can tell its missing that little something. We cannot have pulled pork or fried chicken at my house without this slaw! I also LOVE it on a turkey sandwich! YUM!

Great slaw recipe!  I threw everything in my blender/ chopper it was so easy!  This is better than many or most restaurants because I have had some pretty sour/ boring/ runny slaw (Texas Roadhouse, take note!) at "good" restaurants.  I made it with apple cider vinegar because of preference and light mayo because I was out of miracle whip.  Tastes amazing!

This is excellent and easy!! I made pulled pork BBQ and wanted a quick slaw to serve with it. I saw the stars and gave it a go. I eyed everything and it is still flawless- even right after making! I did use Duke' Mayo instead of Miracle Whip (which countered the sweetness of the sugar, making a more balanced slaw) This is THE keeper!

I truly tried and liked this recipe as well as this being my first time ever making Cole slaw it's a keeper and just the right taste I like and have been accustomed to eating, being it was prepared by a few of the restaurants that I do occasionally go to. It's one that I will make from now on unless of course I find one better....which somehow I highly doubt it, but just in case it will still be at the top of my Cole slaw list (I also like how I can add or alter other ingredients) without changing the great flavor and taste...thanks for sharing your recipe with me/us Thank You Sandi Johnson

First time making this I followed the recipe and found it wasn't that good. It tasted too strongly of Miracle Whip. The second time making it I use mayo and apple cider vinegar and it turned out great!

With a few tweaks this recipe has been a huge hit in my family. Some do not like the onion but like the onion flavor. So, I thoroughly mix in plenty of onion powder with the slaw to start and let it sit for awhile. I double the recipe accept that I put in under a half a cup of sugar. A half cup was still to sweet for us even after doubling everything else.

Fixed this yesterday for a small family get together and it was a HUGE hit!!
My husband, who despises coleslaw usually actually said to me that this was something he would actually eat on a regular basis! O_O
Everyone gave it rave reviews and said how good it was. One person even scraped the bowl to get every last piece of it that was left. 
I did make a couple of minor changes that I don't think made too much of a difference in the end result. I used celery seed since I couldn't find poppy. I also used about 2-3 tbs less sugar, apple cider vinegar instead of white, and light flavor olive oil instead of veg.
This was great. Wish I had made 2 batches instead of just the one. I will def make this again!

My family loves this recipe- even my daughter who is not a coleslaw fan. I did make a few minor alterations. I replaced the dressing with Duke's low fat mayonnaise. I cut the sugar in half, added an additional 1/4 teaspoon salt and 3 additional Tablespoons vinegar. I also added about 1/2 teaspoon fresh cracked pepper. The result was delicious and not too sweet with the perfect vinegar bite. Would highly recommend!

I'll join the chorus and say that I really like this recipe with some modifications. Like many suggested, I halved the sugar and doubled the amount of vinegar to increase the level of acidity. I used Trader Joe's mayo, and a bit of garlic salt instead of table salt. It was great, thanks for this recipe!

This slaw is very good.  The only thing I used different was Hellman's mayo instead of salad dressing.  Already had that in the fridge.

Followed directions exactly as posted....AMAZING!! I worked in a deli in college and we made our own coleslaw and I couldn't remember how it was made....this recipe is so close it's perfect! My husband and family loved it and agreed it was better than any local deli slaw we have tried. I've made with pulled pork and pulled buffalo chicken sandwiches... Perfect addition to both meals!

I used homemade lacto-fermented mayo and doubled the vinegar because I like a little tart.  Next time I'll use just a tad less sugar and I'm good to go!  Thanks for this great recipe.  I love it! :)  Bonus points for being saucy ;)

Loved this recipe. Because of family members not liking raw onion, I used 1 Tablespoon onion powder. Used mayonnaise instead of salad dressing. Used heaping Tablespoon of sour cream instead of oil. Used celery seed instead of poppy seed. I made this at the last minute so just used what I had available and it turned out great! Thanks.

Reminds me a little of KFC coleslaw. I would cut the sugar down just a little. It was a little sweet. The key is make sure you let it sit in the fridge for at least a couple of hours. It looks dry before you put it in the fridge, but it does get creamy the longer it sits.

So delicious, perfect. just used 2 tbsps. of white wine vinegar instead of 1 tbsp. white vinegar and it came out perfect. Must refrigerate for a couple of hours so the flavor will be delicious. My husband loved it, he says it is the best coleslaw he has ever had, I agree.

I've tried this twice now, the first time I made as directed, too sweet for my liking (I know the reviews stated this, but I like to try recipes how they are written before changing things.)  The second time I used 1/3 cup sugar and it still plenty sweet.  Next time I'm going to add some mustard to cut the sweetness.  I used regular mayonnaise and also added shredded carrots.  A definite keeper, I'd give it 5 stars except for the sweetness.

This was an absolutely perfect for Sunday night football! We served it along pulled pork sliders, but the coleslaw was the surprise hit of the night. We had a large group, so I double the recipe. Like others suggested, I cut back the sugar some (used apx 3/4 cup) and for my crew, I added a pack of diced bacon to the dressing before mixing with the cabbage. It was delicious, and even with doubling the recipe there were hardly any leftovers. I got several requests to pass along the recipe to other families, and will be making again for sure! :)

I do not like most cole slaws.  However, this recipe is fantastic!  I could eat it all day long!  I would recommend that you reduce the sugar in half if you don't want it too sweet.  I also took out one tablespoon of oil.  It will seem as if you don't have enough dressing for all that cole slaw but while it sits, it pulls some fluid out of the cabbage and turns out creamy and perfect.  Please try this recipe as it is a winner for me!

Everyone loves this recipe!
I make a few changes
#1 - i always double it
#2 - i do not add the onion
#3 - i add apple cider vinegar and rice wine vinegar in place of white vinegar
#4 - i add 1/2 teaspoon celery seed
Most importantly i use regular mayo, not miracle whip.
It is a hit every time i make it!!

Perfect summer slaw.  I made this every week to go along with something that was being grilled.  Easy favorite of my family.  Tastes even better if you let it sit for a day.

Very good and easy to make! We eat it within 30 min of preparing and it's still good! I don't use as much sugar, I use mayo, and I use pepper instead of the poppyseed. So it's easy to make variations and still have delicious slaw for a last minute side! Thanks for the great recipe =)

This is the best cole slaw I've ever made.  For now on, it will be my go to slaw recipe.  So simple to make.  No more of that twangy cole slaw dressing in the bottle! Thanks for the recipe.  

I made this again for Memorial Day cookout and got rave reviews.  So delicious.  It is better than any restaurant slaw I have eaten.  Should rename it Better Than Restaurant Slaw.

Coleslaw is different from coleslaw... I found myself loving the coleslaw in few restaurants and hating it in most.  This recipe is what I've been searching for. It tastes just like the coleslaw in the barbecue places I love!!!  Definitely a keeper :)

Will never make another slaw again.  I'm not a fan of the heavy mayo or the all vinegar based, this is a perfect middle.  Didn't have poppy seeds, sub black pepper.  SO GOOD!! YUM!!

Great coleslaw.   I cut way down on the sugar.   I also used celery seed.  I added a little dressing at a time, and it turned out wonderful.   Best I have tasted

I made this for my husband this evening and he really liked it. I omitted the onion, used celery seed instead of poppy seed and used red wine vinegar instead of white. I personally do not like coleslaw so I am going on his reaction and he pretty much ate the whole bowl for dinner. He suggested adding 1/8 to 1/4 more miracle whip to thicken it up a little. I will definitely make this again for him :-D
*addendum: I make the slaw sauce early and let it set in the refrigerator for several hours, about an 1/2 hour before serving I add the slaw mix well (I use a covered bowl and shake) put back in the refrigerator until ready to serve. It stays crispier and doesn't get limp and yucky

This is the best coleslaw recipe I've ever tried.  The sugar was perfect in it to me.  Maybe it's my southern taste buds. Colonel Sanders has nothing on me now.

Probably about a 4.5, a tad sweet even with changes. I used 1/4 c. Splenda, but could probably cut that back to about 1/3 cup. Because it was so sweet initially, I added about 1/4 cup more mayo. I probably wouldn't have added it if I had cut back on the Splenda. Added 2 tsp minced onions (would have used fresh if I had any) and added an additional 1/4 tsp vinegar. Also liberally sprinkled on some ground black pepper. My husband doesn't like coleslaw, but had seconds of this one. He thought it was really good. I didn't have poppy seeds, so didn't use any.

Loved this recipe.  Family couldn't believe I made it.  I did use celery seed and 2 bags (10 ounce) coleslaw mix.  I tossed it about every half-hour.  Had a little left over the next day and it was even better.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe.  I know it will be asked for again and again.

I made this coleslaw last night and tweaked a little.  I used a bit of lemon juice instead of vinegar and for sweetness I added salad cubes rather than sugar.  I coaxed my husband, who doesn't eat coleslaw, into eating some.  He actually ate two servings of it, so it was definitely a hit!  Will make again and again.

I've made cabbage slaw once in my life and that was from a kit. I test tried this for a upcoming party. I took some advice from other people on tweeking this recipe. I'm not a fan of Miracle Whip so I used 1/3 cup of regular mayo and 1/3 cup of sour cream. Omitted the oil, used 1/3 cup of sugar, Walla Walla sweet onion, and rice wine vinegar. The sauce was really good. After tossing the sauce with the slaw, I tasted it and I almost couldn't stop eating it. But I did. I refrigerated it for just over an hour and had it as a side dish with sloppy Joes. My husband dislikes cabbage slaw but he enjoyed this one. It tastes better the long it sits in the fridge. It was a but soupy. I'll take someone's suggestion where you put half the sauce, toss, refrigerate for over an hour to sweat the cabbage, drain then add the rest of the sauce before serving.

Very good as is...but after reading other reviews and a simple taste, I made the following adjustments: Changed to 2T oil, 1/4c sugar, added: 1tsp vinegar, 1/4 pepper, dash of garlic powder.

An all-around good slaw recipe. I substituted celery seed for the poppy seed and used powdered-sugar blended with mayo to my taste, thus eliminating the need for vinegar, not sure why there's oil required, I opted not to use it. Other than that followed the recipe. Is it the same recipe? IDK but what I made tasted good ;)

A true crowd pleaser as is.  I was surprised that is was actually creamy and not watery, as can happen as slaw sits.  Guess it's the oil that does it.  Now my go to slaw recipe!

We've made this twice.  The first time we followed the recipe exactly and it is very tasty, like what you get at restaurants.  The second time, we substituted 2 Tablespoons of apple juice and 1 Tablespoon of oil instead of 3 Tablespoons of oil (I thought that would be too much oil).  We also substituted apple cider vinegar for white vinegar and that resulted in a stronger vinegar taste.  Next time, I will split the vinegar amount between the white / apple cider vinegar.  The apple flavor is surprisingly tasty in this slaw.  Overall, the family loves this recipe and we'll make it often.

I had half a bag of brocolli slaw left over from a stir fry and wanted a sauce to go on it.  This was exactly as described.  It has the sweetness you expect when you eat KFC' slaw, it was easy to make and I had the ingredients on hand (except for the poppy seeds, but I dont think that entirely changed the recipe).  I'd make this sauce again.

This was very good.  I took some readers advice and reduced the sugar by 1/8c.  My guests and I liked it, but my husband thought it was still a little on the sweet side.  I will probably reduce the sugar by 1/4c next time.  Thanks for the recipe!

I did make a couple of changes to this recipe.  Here they are  – the first changes I made were celery seed instead of poppy seed.  I used white wine vinegar as opposed to white, because I only use white vinegar to clean with, I never cook with it.  I used half mayo/half miracle whip, because I like the flavor of each, and think it adds body when making dressings to use both.  I also used a chopped green onion, because I had some for a different recipe, and I prefer the milder flavor.  Then  I reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup.   I also used olive oil instead of vegetable oil, and only used about a tablespoon of it instead of 3. Finally, I took gatorgirl’s suggestion to only use half of the dressing, let the slaw rest for an hour, drain the slaw, and top with the remaining dressing.  I thought it was a brilliant way to reduce the watery quality of the slaw.  I made a little extra dressing to make up for what would drain out.  The problem, and perhaps this has something to do with the dry climate here in New Mexico, was that after only an hour, almost none of the moisture had been removed from the slaw.  I went ahead and added the remaining dressing and the following day, the slaw was runnier than I liked.  I think the solution to this would have been to let the slaw rest overnight with only ½ the dressing, drain, and to add the final dressing just before serving.  At any rate, the slaw was very delicious.  I have found a recipe I will use from now on.

Best coleslaw recipe I've ever tried! My family loves this and asks for it often! The only thing I do different is omit the onions since my husband hates them. If you're looking for a coleslaw recipe this is the one to try!!!!

I used only about half the dressing.  I would also cut back on the amount of sugar.  It was a little too sweet for my taste, but overall an excellent recipe!

This is the best slaw recipe I've ever made! I didn't have onion so I used 1/2 tsp of onion powder instead. I also used apple cider vinegar and regular mayo because that's all I had on hand. I'll definitely be making this again.

This is an excellent coleslaw recipe. I made it tonight and loved it. I've never liked sweet coleslaw but this was perfect! I just cut back on the oil and sugar and added one tablespoon of sesame oil/dressing. This will now be one of my favorite go-to recipes! Thank you!

This coleslaw recipe was awesome, it does taste just like a chain fried chicken restaurants, I did try to triple the recipe for the amount of coleslaw bagged mix that I had and that was too much so I think starting out with doubling the recipe first.

This is an excellent sweet slaw recipe. After looking at reviews, I made a few subs; half Splenda and half sugar; half real mayo and half lite mayo; celery seeds instead of poppy, sour cream in place of oil, and rice wine vinegar in place of white vinegar. Three of us polished this off with the slow cooker pulled pork sandwich recipe from this site!

This is soooo good. The only difference in mine is I substitute black pepper for the poppy seeds and I add just a little extra miracle whip to make a tad creamier. Soooo good!

I  increased MW, removed onions and swapped out both the white vinegar and veggie oil for a pineapple white balsamic and blood orange infused olive  oil. OMG!!! This was delicious! Yummy over fish tacos:-)

Made this to use up some of a cabbage I had sitting around.  It sat in the fridge for a couple days before we got around to testing it, but now that we tasted it it won't last long!  my husband and I both loved it.

Very yummy and I am not a coleslaw fan!. I used broccoli slaw, Hellman's,toasted seasame seeds and ground black pepper. I did end up cutting the sugar to 1/3 cup. I will make this again.

I love this. Got rave reviews from all that tried it too! I used regular mayo, a dash extra salt, and celery seed. Definitely let it sit for at least a couple hours to let the flavors marry.
 YUMMMM!

My family does not like slaw so I rarely ever make it but I was asked to make it for a funeral so I was thankful for this recipe.  I used my Kitchen-aide to shred the carrots and cabbage since I needed a lot and didn't want to pay more for the slaw mix.  This made for smaller shreds which made a runnier sauce but it taste really good.  I skipped using the poppy seeds too and if I were making it for myself I would want pepper in it too.

Great recipe exactly as written (except I use mayo instead of miracle whip just as a personal preference) and it is delicious.  I will definitely make this again. I was a little hesitant to use all the sugar as written in the recipe because 1/2 cup seemed like too much, but it is just perfect.

To be honest I don't care for cole slaw but I was making pulled pork and knowing that others like it to go along with that I made this recipe. I got rave reviews from my guests.  I did follow some other recommendations here and cut the sugar by one half.

*****

The reviews are extremely helpful in this recipe.  Less sugar, but too little and the onion becomes overpowering.  I'd suggest a half to 2/3rds of a cup when using Miricle Whip. I added in a few turns of ground pepper and used half a sweet onion. I like it creamy but if you like a bit more crunch, add the radishes and slowly add in the Miricle Whip until you get the desired 'crunch factor' happening.  Great Slaw!

Yes, I would have to agree...this is the most delicious coleslaw I've ever made!  My guy asks for it all the time.  If you are a fan of the slaw at that chicken place, be sure to try this. BTW, I sometimes use Splenda to sweeten and it works just fine.

A serious pregnancy craving for coleslaw lead me to this recipe. I've consumed coleslaw maybe a handful of times in my life and have never made it. SUPER RECIPE! I could have eaten half of this when it was freshly made (I liked the crisper cabbage and more vinegary flavor) but my husband who is a bit of a coleslaw critic thought it was perfect once chilled. I did not use poppy seeds, 1/3rd cup sugar, and used canola instead of vegetable oil.

This was so yummy. I did use extra virgin olive oil instead and apple cider vinegar. I didn't use the poppy seeds only because I did not have any. I am letting it marinate overnight. Should be perfect consistency in the morning. This is the best coleslaw I have ever made.

Quadrupled this for a crowd of 30 and there was none left! For my tastes, this is absolutely perfect when cutting the onions and sugar by half. I also subbed Hellmann's Light Mayo because it's what I had on hand. Mixed up the wet ingredients the night before to let the flavors meld and tossed with the coleslaw mix about 3 hours before serving. Thanks for a crowd pleaser!

Well, the three men in my house LOVED this recipe.  The only changes I made were Hellman's mayo for Miracle Whip and 1/2 tsp. Nunaturals stevia for sugar.  It's a keeper!

Yummy!  I used this recipe to get some HEALTHY FAT into our diet...I used grapeseed oil which is supposed to be good for heart and cholesterol...it tasted great. I served it immediately instead of letting it sit and it was fine.  I would maybe reduce the sugar in the future...but we all liked it. Well I did leave out the poppy seeds too.

I really enjoyed this cole slaw. I noted other reviews and based on my taste, cut the sugar by about a quarter and used mayo instead of dressing.  Served it with the perfect pulled pork recipe from this site and everyone enjoyed it noting that it wasn't too sweet or too tangy.

I made this to accompany the wonderful "Slow Cooker Ham" recipe from this website for Christmas Day. We loved it! I made it the previous day and it was just perfect. The flavor is excellent! It is superior to deli slaw, tastes fresher and has a smoother dressing, less watery. I used prepackaged cole slaw mix and light mayonnaise; I also substituted celery seed for the poppyseed. I will make this recipe again and again!

I loved it. Tasted just like at the restaurants.  If you want a low-carb version, try substituting Splenda instead of the sugar. Then you can have it if your on Atkins like me.

This is a great recipe, with some changes: Use only 1/4 cup of sugar if you want a salad not a dessert. 1/2 cup sugar is way too much. I used my own homemade mayonnaise instead of dressing. I increased the salt to 1/2 teaspoon. I added 3 tablespoons of yogurt and omit the oil! If you follow the way I modified this recipe then you will have a bowl of cloeslaw much much better tasting than those fried chicken restaurants. Enjoy!

I used a large head of cabbage instead of the stale bagged stuff.  I added three carots but suggest rinsing them in cold water before adding to the slaw or could turn orange. I also used 3/4 of an onion and omitted the poppy seeds.

Very easy and made with ingredients I always have on hand.  It tastes exactly like restaurant coleslaw and that's exactly what I wanted.  I've made this recipe a few times and it will be my go-to recipe for slaw now.

I used mayo (we don't like Miracle Whip) and that's about all I could taste. I didn't find it too sweet at all. I did like the light onion flavor. It was just ok. I'd try it again, but maybe substitute something for part of the mayo.

This recipe was amazing. I have a very hard time getting my kids to eat veggies, period. This was the first thing to disappear off their plates at dinner. Although it was a (very) little bit sweet, I am not complaining if they will eat it. I didn't have poppy seeds, so I substituted them and the plain salt for a generous 1/4 tsp of celery salt, and a pinch of black pepper. I also omitted the onion, and used half grated carrot, and half shredded cabbage. Yummy !!!

Thanks

This is a fantastic recipe as is or as a starting point to try lots of variation. I use broccoli and carrot shred coleslaw for my family and they love it. In the summer with fried chicken or pulled pork sandwhiches and fresh lemonade or peach iced tea, this slaw is perfect!

My husband and son said that this is the best cole slaw they have ever had. I made it just as stated only subbed celery seed for poppy seeds as another reviewer did because I don't keep poppy seeds on hand. I am reticent about the high fructose corn syrup in the Miracle Whip AND a half cup of sugar (although another reviewer reduced the sugar and said it just wasn't the same so I kept it)...seems a lot, so I may keep looking or tweaking...because well, coating veggies in tons of sugar seems silly, but if I can't find another way to do it maybe I'll just have to take the good with the not so good.  Thanks for the recipe!

My husband liked this recipe, but I thought it was just okay. Even though I cut back on the sugar to 1/4 cup, it was still too sweet for my taste. There was also too much dressing-would add about half the amount and play with it if making again.

I'm giving this 5 stars because I usually don't even like soleslaw and this is super yummy! I followed other reviews and cut down slightly on the sugar, added mayo instead of miracle whip and used sour cream instead of oil. It came out fantastic! I'll be using this recipe again.

Sooooo good.  Like the other reviews, I only used 1/4 cup of sugar and it was plenty sweet.  I've made it twice already and everyone loves it.  A must have for summer BBQ's!

I'm not a big coleslaw fan, but this was excellent.  I took it to a family reunion and was asked for the recipe.  Reminded me of KFC slaw which is the only one I have ever really cared for.  Seems dry at first but it gets juicier as it settles.

THIS IS the BEST coleslaw recipe I've found.  I am VERY VERY picky with recipes.  I look until I find the best before I save them.  THIS is it!  If you like a coleslaw with Mayo based dressing-this is the one to keep!  I don't use Miracle Whip so it's not something I generally keep for recipes so I naturally used Real Mayo and it was just perfect, a little sweet but not overly.  I get compliments on this Coleslaw always!

Tasted great with 1 whole fresh cabbage and 4 carrots from bunch. Made the night before as reviews stated it was better marinated. No onions used, used celery seed vs. poppy seed, used 1/3 cup white sugar and used bertolli extra virgin olive oil Gentile vs. veg. oil.

Love this recipe! Great the way it is but I like it even better with these substitutions plus it's lighter but you wouldn't know it. Light mayo with olive oil for the miracle whip, 2-3 T f/f milk for the oil,  celery seed for the poppy seed and if you love onion like me add 1/4-1/3 c onion. :)

This is terrific.  I love coleslaw and always made it with store-bought dressing to which I added sugar. This recipe is simply the best!  Hubby even eats it which he didn't the one with store-bought.  I agree substituting rice vinegar is a great idea.  Eat it up.

This is really good! I grew up in a "Friday night fish fry" community so I have tried my fair share of cole slaws. I have tried lots of "copycat recipes" but none hold a candle to this. I read reviews and took some of the suggestions and added some of my own. I only make up a 1/2 batch at a time so it doesn't get runny with just three of us eating it.
My changes were using mayo, 1/3 cup sugar (still plenty sweet), celery seed, olive oil instead of just vegetable oil and the oddest thing was to add cauliflower pieces. I did this on a whim because the first time I made it I had too much dressing on it. My teenager liked that addition. I feel that it ads even another healthy element to the cabbage, plus I don't load on the dressing. This is a keeper!

I forgot the onion and even without it was great.  It doesn't need anymore sugar and there is no need to double the liquid ingredients.  Keep the recipe as it is.  I will make this recipe again.

In my opinion it is a decent starting point.  But I actually found it a little bland.  I added pepper and a tad more vinegar and that seemed to help.

Everyone loved this recipe when I made it for a family party. I halfed the sugar like everyone else, and I also put 1 tablespoon GRATED onion instead of 2 T diced onion. I liked it as more a part of the sauce instead of having bigger pieces of onion in the slaw mix. I will never make another recipe for coleslaw. :)

Very Good.  As a personal preference, I only used 1/4 cup of sugar and it was great!

Good starting ground for slaw, I added raisins and didn't put as much sugar. Also I did fresh cabbage and carrots which makes it a lot fresher and isn't that much more work!

Finally found my staple slaw recipe. Watch out though it is too easy to eat the whole bowl at once. I don't like buying the bagged coleslaw mix because it goes bad too quickly. So I chop up a small head of cabbage with a few carrots for color.

Way too sweet if you use miracle whip and the full 1/2 cup of sugar. I cut it down to 1/4 cup sugar and used regular mayo and it was still a little too sweet. Also, the coleslaw seemed too dry when I first mixed the ingredients, but it was perfect after sitting in the fridge for a few hours.

This recipe is a good starting point, but I have NEVER made it as written. I follow Atkins (low-carb) so I use real mayonnaise instead of carbier Miracle Whip and granular Splenda in place of sugar. The first time I made it, I used poppy seeds as written and halved the amount of sweetener. I didn't like the poppy seeds and the coleslaw was too sweet. This time, I used 1/4 teaspoon celery seeds instead of poppy, added several grinds of fresh black pepper, and only used 2 tablespoon of sweetener. Next time I'll try 1/2 teaspoon celery seeds and maybe a touch more sweetener.

This was really good..Only added celery seed instead of the poppy seed. Update: I make this now about once a week. I've gotten to the point where I can just "wing it" I've used less sugar & it was just as good or use the recipe amount depending on what we're having it with. I've also added extra vinegar at times too. It always turns out great! Our favorite thing to do with this is use it on the pittsburgh sandwich from this site. Too good!

This is a good creamy cole slaw recipe! It was quick and easy. I used a little less mayo and a little more vinegar. There was plenty of dressing for one bag of cole slaw mix.

This is the tastiest coleslaw I have ever made, and I got many compliments on it!  My only word of advice is that the recipe makes a lot more dressing than is needed for the one bag of coleslaw.  Make sure you add it slowly so it is not drenched.

This was very good, but seemed very basic like any other cole slaw I've had.  So far it's the best recipe I've tried though, so it's going to be my main slaw recipe unless another one comes along.

Good but a bit too sweet for my taste buds. Next time I will cut the sugar in half. The addition of celery seed (as others have suggested) sounds like a great addition to this slaw.

My God, this is insanely good.  I chopped my own cabbage and carrots, and used apple cider vinegar the second time I made this and I prefer it with the apple cider.  I also added 1 Tsp. of celery seeds.  Unbelievable.  Everyone in my family said this was hands down the best slaw they've ever had.

A little onion-y for my taste.  Next time I'll use less mayo and onion. Great picnic slaw, though!

I used poppy seed salad dressing along with the mayo, and vinegar. I did not measure the amount, sorry.(rather than just plain poppy seeds) WOW, there was not much left and I made cole slaw for 30 folks! Thanks!!

If your looking for slaw that tastes like what you get in a restaurant this is the recipe. I prefer my grandmothers recipe but this was a nice change of pace and paired wonderfully with blue cheese potatoes, pats baked beans and scott hibb's prize winning ribs (all from this site). Thanks!

Very sweet -- next time I will cut down on the sugar.  It was a little too saucy after a couple of hours.  Next time, I will either add more shredded cabbage or cut the dressing in half.  But it definitely is a keeper.  Thanks for the recipe.

My, (very picky), Grandmother LOVES this cole slaw.  For every get together I am called upon to make "Sara's coleslaw"  I only made 2 modifications,  I use canola mayo and apple cider vinegar.  It is perfect!

I'm a vegan so I had to make a few changes but it was STILL AMAZING! In stead of regular Mayo I used Veganaise (with the blue cap) it's 1 million times better for you and tastes exactly the same. I was out of White vinegar so I used balsamic instead which made the dressing brown but it was amazing (for someone like me who's favorite snack is bread dipped in olive oil and balsamic)

FABULOUS! I know you are to wait at least two hours before serving, but I loved it right after mixing the dressing in. Crunchy and so yummy!! I, too, only used 1/4 cup of sugar and used mayo for the dressing, otherwise I followed the recipe as written.

A delicious sweet coleslaw, pretty close to the typical KFC and deli style slaw.  I made this recipe for the kids and 2 out of the 3 ate it.  My oldest is a picky eater but loves coleslaw.  This passed his taste test!

I have never made coleslaw before so I was pretty happy with how this turned out. It is sweet, but I like it that way- if you don't like sweet slaw stay away from this recipe! I used Light Miracle Whip, 1/3 cup sugar, and Red Wine Vingar because I didn't have White Wine Vingar, I also used Celery Seed instead of Poppy Seed, and added Pepper and Raddish.

Substituted olive oil for vegetable oil & reduced from 3 to 2 T, used mayo instead of miracle whip, reduced sugar by 2 T, used rice wine vinegar.  Added 1/4 tsp creamy horseradish & 1 small can of crushed pineapple. Very good coleslaw-thanks for sharing.

My husband said it was the best coleslaw he'd ever had and he never lies about the food I make! It was great! I despise onions, so I used onion powder instead of actual onion and it was still delicious! This is the only cole slaw recipe I'll use from now on!

I really thought this was excellent, chopped a medium head of cabbage, doubled the onion added grated carrot - doubled the dressing recipe, but used Hellman's mayo instead of Miracle Whip, it was terrific, lots of complements  !!!

!!! Loved it but made my little changes according to my taste: no sugar to make it heathier (and I personally find it tastier like that), used apple cider vinegar, red ognion and no poppy seeds (had none). Used Mayo instead of Miracle Whip and sour cream instead of oil. I grated my own cabbage and added carrots and celery. Will do again!

This was just like what you would get at a restaurant. I could only give this 4 stars however because had I followed the recipe I couldn't have eaten it. I reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup and next time will use even a little less. The poppy seeds are a must and I might use a little more due to personal preference. I also used apple cider vinegar instead of white and it was just fine. This is very easy and was just what I was looking for to go with BBQ pork sandwiches.

This was an awesome recipe except i made some changes the second time i made. I used 1/2 head of cabbage, 2 carrots. I reduced the mayo to 1/2 cup, veg oil to 2 tbs. sugar to 1/4 cup and added pepper to taste..It came out SOOO good not to sweet or runny. Thanks so much for the recipe.

I absolutely love this recipe. After having to change my diet for health reasons I make this with Fat-Free Miracle Whip only 1/2 of the oil and use canola oil and it still gets a 5 star. I typically add an extra splash of vinigar. I have taken this to multiple barbeques in the reduced fat version and I still get amazing reviews. The guests are all shocked with I tell them that it is low fat.

This is as simple and tasty as it gets.  Outstanding as written, I might play with using a little less oil and I used light miracle whip...but only to try to skim some fat.  The taste is right on.

My husband doesn't even like coleslaw but he adored this.  I've always loved coleslaw, and this is the best I've ever had.  I added a lot more onion (maybe used half a red onion) but that was the only change.

Excellent coleslaw! I grated fresh white cabbage (1/2 a head for 8 servings) and decreased the sugar (1/3 cup) and added a bit more vinegar, as suggested by others here. Also added 1/2 a carrot, grated, for a bit of color. Will definitely be a regular in our from now on!

This was a great recipe. I used double the amount of vinegar and I added about 1/8 teaspoon of pepper. But this turned out just how I wanted to.

Made it twice in one week. Yes it was that good. I didn't have any Miracle whip so I just combined mayonnaise and ranch, a combination I would highly recommend. Also, I cut down a bit on the sugar the second time (just my preference) and accidently poured a little more vinegar than I was supposed to which I think made it all the more better. Amazing recipe, Sandi Johnson is a genius ;)

I cut the sugar to 1/3 cup and used  1/3c reg Hellmans,and 1/3 Lite Hellmans mayo.  I shredded in 2 carrots b/c i like carrots and makes it prettier.  Also added a dash of celery seeds.  Gotta love it when people who normally do not like cole slaw go for 2nds!

The best slaw recipe ever.  It leaves me craving slaw!  I didn't add onion because we don't add onion to slaw around here, and I didn't have poppy seeds, but man it was good!  I'm going to make it again today!

Best cole slaw ever!  I make it exactly as the recipe states, except for adding a little extra onion.  It tastes so good - you won't be disappointed!  You can even use light Miracle Whip and a little less sugar and it's still amazing.

This coleslaw was amazing! It was very sweet, but my husband doesn't really care for coleslaw and he LOVED this one. I didn't use the bag of coleslaw I just used up a half of a cabbage I had and 2 carrots, but it tasted very good.

The best way to get your kids to eat cabbage! The  prefect amount of sweetness...my daughter's fav "salad"! We have never made it with poppy seeds and just as good! Also...we hardly ever wait 2 hours....let alone 20 minutes to eat. We toss the slaw with the dressing and it usually goes straight to the table. Just as good as the leftovers the next day. Thanks for the recipe! this is the only one I use now!

Wonderful recipe!  I doubled it and added a bit of apple cider vinegar.  The sauce goes WAY farther than you would think so BE CAREFUL!  I also increased the amount of poppy seeds because I like the look.

For a person making cole slaw for the first time, this is a pretty safe recipe. I made it last night with success just using 1 large carrot, 1 daikon, and 1 celery root. It's pretty tasty. I would definitely add some broccoli and raisins next time I make it. I think by itself, it's a little on the sweet side and I wouldn't eat very much of it.

We really liked this slaw, I used fresh chopped cabbage and carrots and added 2 green onions (a lot more than called for), used Splenda in place of white sugar and it was sweet and oniony good!

I only used half the sugar and it tasted wonderful. I didn't have a package of coleslaw so I shredded a small garden cabbage. Served with curly fries, mixed veggies, and "Beer Batter Fish Made Great."

Maybe the chain restaurants use different recipes in different regions, because this was far sweeter than anything I've tasted at those places.  It wasn't bad, just a little too sweet, and maybe a little too wet.  I like to use leftover coleslaw on sandwiches, and this completely overpowered and "mushed up" the bread in a way most recipes (and the stuff from the restaurants) doesn't.

This tasted fantastic! I made it two different ways: one with salad dressing (Miracle Whip) and real mayo. I read all the reviews and was worried it may come out too sweet. I mixed the dressing mixture first then adding sugar just a little bit at a time to taste. I ended up using 1/3 c and it was perfect for our tastes. I will say though the Miracle Whip one is sweeter than the real mayo one so that could be the key. I also used celery seed instead of poppy seeds mainly because that's what I had on hand. My mom who thought it was a silly idea for me to make this and said wouldn't eat it absolutely loved it and told me I had to make it more often. This will become a bbq staple!

Perfect Taste! I used hellmann's mayo and rice vinegar. Excellent. The rice vinegar is a milder vinegar that gives the slaw a perfect kick without overpowering. Oh, and when I measured out the sugar, I stopped just below the 1/2c. line

I mostly neede this recipe for the dressing ingredients.  I cut back the sugar a tad, and it was DELICIOUS!  Kids and husband liked a lot!  I used fresh cabbage and green onions, plus added some imitation crab meat.  Very nice.

Excellent coleslaw... Better dressing than the stuff that comes in a jar!  I did cut back slightly on the sugar, but that was just a matter of preference.

I am so glad I skipped the deli coleslaw for dinner. This recipe was so delicious! I did cut back on the sugar and skipped the vegetable oil. I am going to get some poppy seeds for the next batch! Thanks for the post.

I really wanted to love this, like everyone else.  It was a 'nice' slaw.  However, mine got really runny in just a few hours - I followed the recipe, except I cut my own slaw mix.  Maybe that was it.  I happen to love the slaw at the chicken chain, and I don't think this has the same zip as theirs.

This was the best slaw I've ever made.  I did use mayo and celery seed (didn't have poppy).  I let it marinade for about 4 hours.  I will never make another slaw, we loved this!

I prefer an vinegar based slaw, but this was pretty good.  My husband loved it.  I thought it was missing a little something.   Like other reviewers, I substituted celery seed for the poppy seeds.  Easy to make and tasted good; will make again.

This recipe is absolutely perfect, took it to a Family Reunion and everyone raved over it.  Because my family doesn't like Miracle Whip,I used plain Mayonnaise, and that was the only thing I changed...it was the bomb!

This slaw was good. Love that you can use the bag slaw mix thats already chopped. Did not use poppy seeds, didn't have them but did have celery seeds and they worked out just fine.

I tweaked this recipe a bit. Used 1/2 head of cabbage and 3 carrots instead of mix. Used mayo, celery seed, a touch of lemon juice, one tblsp more of vinegar and horseradish. This recipe was a bit too sweet. I know it sounds like I changed a lot, but the taste isn't much different. It tastes awesome like all the other reviews say!

Fabulous! I left out the onion and used 1/2 a cabbage and a large carrot instead of the bagged veggies. I think it tastes even better the second day. I will make this over and over. We all loved it, including my 4 year old.

Great Slaw!  I made as directed except using celery seed instead of poppy seed, as I didn't have poppy seed and read other reviewers substitution.  Have made this a couple of times and it is excellent.

I'm not really a slaw person but my boyfriend is. It is his favorite side dish so I decided to surprise him. I've never made slaw before. He was still talking about the slaw this morning!! The only thing I changed is I used mayo instead of miracle whip and green onions because I that is the only kind I like. It was delicious! We ate the whole thing ourselves .. I am definitely spreading this recipe around...thanks!!

Just cut the sugar to 1/3 cup - do not add extra onions, as this will overpower everything else.  Outside of that, this slaw is awesome!!

The first time was exactly as called for. Far, far and away too sweet, for me anyway. I now make this using mayo and 1/4 cup of Splenda.  And, as others suggested, gotta have the celery seed.  Would gladly have rated this 5 stars had the base recipe  not been sooooo sweet.  If you are using Miracle Whip, I would suggest you start with 1/8 cup sugar, taste and add more if desired.  But this a great beginning and  I hope all will try it.  Thank you, very  much, Sandi Johnson.

Mmmmm...delish!  Like others, I used celery seed and it was the best cole slaw we've ever had.  One note: use Kraft mayo instead of Miracle Whip and it won't be quite as sweet.  ;)

This was my first attempt at making cole slaw. It was really easy to make, but too sweet...I would recommend using half the amount of sugar...I just added a little extra mayo and vinegar to make up for the sweetness. Very good recipe though! Just cut back on the sugar!!

Easy and delicious - I served it on a bun with Kahula pork (another recipe here) and it was fantastic.  A little on the sweet side for those who don't like their slaw sweet.

Absolute best coleslaw and so easy.  Make sure to let it set for a few hours.  It's not tasty right after you mix it up but after it sits it's amaaaazing.

Very good! I used light mayo, no oil, 1/3 c sugar and celery seed with delicious results and less calories. I bet it's even better with all the calories!

great tasting and actually lasts for a few days.  the coleslaw bag i buy is 14 oz., so just a little shy of what the recipe called for so i didnt add all the dressing mixture.  i added enough to coat it with a tiny bit extra and that was too much.  hard to explain, but next time i am going to coat it just until it's almost all covered and seems like theres not enough dressing on it - cos after it sits in the fridge for a while it becomes creamier.  so less is more here.  thanks for the great recipe!

Excellent! I am not a big fan of coleslaw but this was delicious. I used mayo, left out the seeds and added black pepper.

This IS the best slaw recipe.  I used celery seed since I did not have poppy seeds (as suggested in another comment) and also added a finely-chopped, small red onion.  Got rave reviews from our guests.

This is just delicious and it is wonderful as written.  However, we like it with these few additions:  added 1 bag broccoli slaw to the coleslaw mix (makes it more crisp), added 2-3 T balsamic vinegar, and added 2 T of plain or vanilla yogurt.  I really like the coleslaw both the original way and with the additions--either way, it is sure to please.

Very good slaw. I used a 14 oz. bag of cole slaw ... that's what my grocery carries.  Still it turn out great.  The only thing I might do next time is use just a little less sugar ... other than that a very good recipe.

I've made this cole slaw several times and my family loves it!  I just made a few changes/additions and am always asked to bring it to family gatherings, potlucks, etc.  I used 1/2 c. chopped sweet onion(vadalia, if in season) and added 1/2 c. chopped fresh green peppers.  I also add a cup of already packaged shreaded carrots.  As far as the mayo, I used 1/2 Lite Miracle Whip and 1/2 Lite Hellman's totalling 2/3 cup.  I also cut back on the sugar to 1/4 c. and cut back on the canola oil using only 1 TBSP instead of 3 TBSP. Ground pepper to taste.  End result is an awesome and tangy coleslaw for a year-round side dish to any event or holiday!!

Great starter recipe and you can tweak it with 1/2 cup raisins and a sweet diced apple.  I used mayo instead of miracle whip, sushi vinegar instead of regular vinegar and less sugar as others have suggested.

This did taste like the restaurant slaw, but I have to say, with the addition of the vegetable oil, it had a 'slimy' texture.  Next time I will use a very small amount of oil and put some extra miracle whip and vinegar in.  I would suggest upping the vinegar anyway, it was all sweet and no tang.

Awesome!  I am not a mayo fan but have been trying to get over that and I'm glad I didn't let that get in the way of making this coleslaw. It was great! WAY better than any store bought and I liked it more than KFC which has always been my favorite.  Used a tiny bit less mayo and a little less sugar.

I have been looking for a cole slaw recipe that was just like my grandmothers from when I was little.  This brought back so many memories.  It was delicious.  I did not use the onions and the poppy seeds because to me they do not belong.  This will be used many times.

this is really good but I switched it up a bit. I left out the vinegar and put kraft cucumber ranch in just a drop or two for a interesting kick.

There are many recipes on this site for Cole Slaw that do indeed look great on paper but produce anything from mediocre to down right awful results. This one on the other hand mops the floor with all of them. This one looks like Cole Slaw, smells like Cole Slaw, and tastes like Cole Slaw, and is indeed Cole Slaw. This is now my official "go to" recipe for Cole Slaw. Sandi, thanks a million for this recipe submission. You really hit this out of the park!

This is the best coleslaw recipe I have found.  I made it yesterday for a barbecue and my guests just loved it. It was gone by the end of the dinner.  I did use low fat mayo and cut the sugar to 1/3 cup. It was excellent, a definite keeper.

Have gotten recipes off this website for years now.  This is my first time writing a review.  I loved this coleslaw!  It was so good with the pulled pork bbq that my husband made.  Yum!  This is a keeper!

Good taste, but next time I think I'd add a little bit of horseradish for a bit of a kick.  Tasted great - like my KFC favorite.

This was so delicious! My husband does not like cole slaw, but I made him try it and he loved it. I will make this again and again. It was very easy and quick to make. Thank you!

This is an absolutely delicious and easy slaw recipe to make! I am making this recipe again for tomorrow's Easter dinner. I did make a couple revisions to suit our family's taste. I used the recommended amounts of bagged cole slaw (we enjoy the the tri color mix with green and red cabbage and carrots) and replaced the onion with three green onions (scallions) and finely diced the white part and cut about three inches of each green top in 1/8 inches pieces with a kitchen scissors. It adds even more color and a milder onion flavor than some regular onions. The "dressing/sauce" ingredients I halved since we don't care for extremely juicy slaw, and it saves some calories for those health conscientious guests. If you make it the night before you plan to serve it, there seems to be plenty of moisture to give it great flavor. It is a bit sweet, but another option would be to cut down the amount of sugar by 1-2 tablespoons or increase the vinegar by 1-2 teaspoons.

The taste was perfect!  The only thing I will change next time is to add a little less mayo, as we like our slaw a little less creamy.  It gets creamier as it sits in the fridge.

This had to be the best cole slaw I have ever eaten. The only change I made was I used mayo and added a little cream to the mayo and whipped it.

I've been using the jarred slaw dressing for years, but wanted a more homemade taste yesterday, so tried this recipe. I used 1/4 cup sugar and no poppy seeds - my boyfriend no longer wants me to buy the jarred stuff again - he and I both loved it!

This coleslaw was very tasty with our BBQ last night. I used all the dressing ingredients as written (except subbed veganaise for the mayo) and rather than buying a bag of wilted shredded cabbage for $1.79 (!) I bought a small head of cabbage for .66 and shredded it myself, adding 3 grated carrots. This may have cut down on the sweetness a little because I'm pretty sure I ended up with more slaw than I would have if I had used the pre-sliced veggies. Either way, very tasty. The boyfriend loved it too.

This one won, hands down! My sworn coleslaw-hating children even gave it a thumbs up, and my barely-8-yr-old made it all by herself! It did get a little runny after 2 hours, but that's probably because the sugar that made it so good brought out all of the water. How does that chicken place get around that? (Maybe it was b/c of using light mayo.) GREAT recipe!

Awesome recipe! My husband who is a big coleslaw fan but is very particular about it loved it! I did do 1/3 mayo an 1/3 miracle whip and added a dash more vinegar to give it a little more tang. Tasted awesome!

Very good recipe, but next time I would add less sugar and, to keep it healthier, perhaps low fat or fat free salad dressing. Very nice as is though.

This recipe is phenomenal!  I was so sad when it was gone, I could've eaten the whole recipe myself! I followed the recipe as is, except that I used natural sugar and made my own mayo. I am going to make it again in a few days, and I absolutely cannot wait!

Total keeper.  At first I was hesitant to put in all the sugar, but I followed the recipe (except I used 1/2 mayo & 1/2 sour cream instead of miracle whip), and it came out really well.  In fact the longer it sat, the better it got.

This exceeded my expectations! I substituted with mayo, rice wine vinegar and celery seeds instead of poppy seeds. You could probably add a little more cabbage, as this recipe was a little wetter than I wanted it. None the less, still delicious!

I had some huge bags of garden slaw given to me so I tried this recipe. Used real mayo instead of Miracle Whip because no one here likes it. This was really, really good. And it does taste just like KFC coleslaw.

Sooo close to being the perfect coleslaw for us. The flavors are so close, it's just too sweet for our taste. I only used 1/3 cup sugar and it was still too much. I think that using regular mayo instead of Miracle Whip would make this perfect for us, as Miracle Whip is pretty sweet on it's own. I will definitely try that next time. I did add lots of black pepper and a dash of celery seed. Still, very good. Thank you :)

Hubby said it was the BEST!  Note: I used same amount of dressing the second time I made it even though I doubled the amount of slaw and it was perfect.  I served it with a deli roll and I think it was the most successful/raved over first course I have ever made!

This is great.  I've tried it out on a few of my friends and family and everyone loves it.  I used a grocery store brand creole seasoning to season the pork.  5 stars!!!!!

Good coleslaw recipe. My favorite is the restaurant cole slaw from this site, but I needed a version that used only ingredients that I had on hand (ie no buttermilk). This worked just fine.

I've made this at least 10 times since October and it is great.  It's easy and the only thing unusual that I need is the bag of slaw!!!

This is a definite keeper.

Try making a Turkey Rueban with it.  Grill on rye bread:  turkey, slaw & swiss cheese.  Dip into thousand island dressing - a favorite in my home!

Excellent! I have made it a few times and everyone always loves it. I also cut the sugar in half and replace the poppy seeds for celery seeds. Great recipe considering I would never eat coleslaw before, and I eat this stuff up!

This was very good. My picky hubby liked it a lot.  However I used half mayo and used less sugar as well. It was plenty sweet with less sugar and mayo added. I don't find that it really needs the oil if you are going for less fat.  I forgot the oil the first time and liked it just as well as with it the second.

I just made this coleslaw for a work potluck party.  It was a huge hit!! Although others have said it was too sweet, I didn't change anything about the recipe other than the fact I used Hellman's instead of Miracle Whip. Thank you for a great recipe!

Awesome. I used shredded red cabbage because my coleslaw mix had gone bad, and it tasted just as good, with the added benefit that it was so much prettier! I cut the sugar in half, but I stuck with the Miracle Whip because I think t is so much more flavorful than mayo. Also wanted to add that I usually make the KFC knockoff coleslaw using buttermilk, but this is much better because it diesn't get all watery in the fridge.

Thank you for this recipe!  I served this at my daughter's birthday party to go along with some bbq beef sandwiches.  The kids and the adults loved it.  Several people asked me for the recipe at the party as well.  The only thing that I did not add was the poppy seeds because I forgot to pick them up when I was grocery shopping for the party.  Thanks again!

Very good!  I shredded cabbage, onion and carrots in my food processor.  Doubled recipe.  Used 1/2 mayo and 1/2 m. whip and 1 cup sugar.  I made way too much but will enjoy eating all the leftovers! :)

Awesome! I followed some of the other reviewer's advice: I used Hellman's light and substituted light sour cream for the vegetable oil.  I wanted to send some home with my husband's family and he "No, they don't need any!"  Update 06-2009: Using fresh not packaged slaw mix is MUCH BETTER. I use purple and green cabbage along with one grated large carrot--it's beautiful!

As one other reviewer put it, this is The Best! I got raves for this recipe, just wish I could have claimed it as my own. We like celery seed instead of poppy, otherwise don't change a thing.

I personally don't eat cole slaw, but my family does.  My husband thought it was a little too sweet and a little to dry.  I added a little more mayo and some lemon juice.  Perfect.  Oh, and a spoonful of sweet relish.

The first and only slaw recipe I will ever use!  Plus it's so easy, I will never gamble on buying premade slaw again.  Thanks!

YUM!  This is quite possibly the best slaw I've ever eaten....and it is so much easier to make than many out there.  I just made this today for a neighborhood block party and it is DELICIOUS!  Definitely don't forget to allow 2+ hours for it to set.  It is a completely different dish once it does. I also decreased the sugar slightly according to other reviews, and used half white vinegar and half cidar vinegar for an extra kick.

Wonderful coleslaw recipe! Don't tweak it or change it, don't add more sugar or mayo, etc. Leave the recipe as is. The trick is to make it well in advance and let the coleslaw chill in the fridge. A couple hours is fine, but ideally you want it to sit in the fridge overnight to let the flavors meld together. It will all come together once chilled and allowed to sit for some time. I made it as a sidedish with pork ribs, and the men couldn't get over that it was homemade coleslaw. It tasted like, but just as good as KFC, if not better. I had mine chilled in the fridge all day, and at the end of the meal there were no leftovers.

This is a nice sweet slaw... I made it with chopped cabbage and carrots instead of the prepackaged... next time I'll add a little less sugar, but we really liked it.

Everyone raved about this coleslaw!  I used  reduced-fat mayo instead of Miracle Whip (MW is just too tangy for me).  I also used half rice vinegar and half apple cider vinegar to add more flavor.  I reduced the sugar to 1/3 C and added 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper.  Fabulous - tasted just like the coleslaw you get at fast food fried chicken places.  I will definitely be making this again.

My mom made this when I came to visit last week.  She had made this for their friends who came to visit & told me how they raved and raved about how good it was, and they were right!!  It tastes very similar to KFC or Lee's.  She said it was so easy to make and not to be alarmed when you're done mixing it up and it seems too dry.  Apparently cabbage releases water and that's why you must let it chill for 2 hours, or overnight as she does.  Very good recipe.  I look forward to making it myself to take to the next function I'm invited to!

I made this yesterday for a bbq.It was great! The only changes I made were,cider vinegar instead of white, Helmans mayo, and I used less sugar as recomended by other reviewers, maybe a little more than 1/4 cup. I reccomend adding the sugar a little at a time to taste. I made this to go along with bbq pulled pork, it was a big hit!

Everyone loved this slaw! It was a little on the sweet side but not too noticeable. The celery seed is a must! Whole family with 13 people enjoyed this slaw with ribs. Yum!

I enjoyed this recipe but would only use a mounded 1/2C Miracle Whip dressing (The 2/3C it calls for was a little much for my taste) and only a 1/4C sugar. I had originally tried it with 1/3C and I think I could cut it back even more.

I followed this recipe exactly except for the poppy seed as I didn't have any. It was pretty good immediately, but after a few hours it was even better. It seemed like the longer I left it in the fridge, the better it got. Didn't last too long around here though. Will definately be making again.

I am southern so I love sweet slaw.  This was almost too sweet and definately too soupy.  It was still good, don't get me wrong, but I wouldn't follow this recipe again.

This is quite good.  I however found it to be a little on the sweet side and a little more runny than I would have liked it to be.  I think i will try it again, and just tweak the recipe to how i like it. A little more veggies and a little less sugar

As usual, Allrecipes saved me again. I used this recipe to make slaw for 80 people at work.  I have been asked for the recipe by 22 of those people.  I did reduce the amount of sugar by about a 3rd because of other reviews. It turned out fantastic!
