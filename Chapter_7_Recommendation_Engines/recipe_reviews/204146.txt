The Casserole That Ate Manhatten! Just made this, and felt the need to warn others - this makes a TON, and will not fit into a 9 X 13 pan without very careful heaping. I think the problem is that there's way too much pasta. Next time, I would half the amount of pasta, and keep the seasonings the same; the overabundance of pasta weakens  the flavor when made as directed, resulting in a casserole that is surprisingly bland, considering the ingredients. I couldn't taste the adobo at all, and grabbed the salt shaker after my first bite, which I never do. All that pasta made it the broccoli, tater, bacon bites hard to find, too. May try this again with suggested changes, but not sure. If I do, I'll post again.

This turned out amazing! I did change it up a little bit and mixed all of the ingredients together in a big bowl before putting it in the casserole dish, and then topped it with more cheese and the rest of the tater tots.  And I think next time I might thaw out the tater tots all the way because some of them weren't completely done, but it has SO much flavor both my husband and I loved it!

I used rotelle pasta, way more than 6 strips of bacon and no adobo seasoning. I added a few of my favorite spices and continued with the recipe as stated. It turned out really tasty! I did let the tater tots thaw a bit while i was making the pasta and bacon and still they were a bit cold after 35 minutes in the oven.  I'd suggest mixing everything in a bowl before adding it to the pan and then topping with tots and cheese again. I added some fresh cut scallions to the top for a bit of texture and taste. This recipe made plenty of food for 6 people and there are still left overs!!

Used rotini pasta. Added a lot more cheese and went for a more cheese/butter/roux.  Melting the cheese with the butter and adding fat free half and half, adding the cheese and then working the veggies into it.
Roasted my veggies with garlic, just a preference, but very good.  We went for fat free cheese also.  It's fun to make good food and morph it into something we like.  Recipe as it stands is great, we just made it work for our new diet! thanks so much, this is awesome!

This is the best mac n cheese recipe ever.  I used a whole package of bacon, eliminated the butter altogether (except to butter the pan) and sauteed the broccoli and onion in the bacon grease after it was cooked.  mixed in half the bacon with the pasta and used the rest to top it off before baking.  also used galric powder instead of adobo (didn't have any).  AMAZING.

This recipe is a fine basic but be warned it is NOT at all flavourful the way it is written. Use your own spices and herbs and don't bother with the adobo. 

As other reviews say, mix everything in a bowl before you put it in the dish BUT (a big but) wait until everything has cooled to room temp. There is nothing worse than scrambled eggs and curdled milk. 

Forget about the butter, reserve a tablespoon of the bacon grease the way nature intended. To send this recipe to the next level double the bacon and arrange a layer of fresh whole spinach leaves on top of the macaroni, then add the final cheese layer. I grated a little fresh parmesan on top after it came out of the oven. Fabulous!

We weren't a fan of this recipe, it was just OK. The flavor was ok but it was far from cheesy enough for us. Alsom if you are going to try it, I wouldn't suggest making it with fat free milk like I did, I had cooked chunks of milk in it, and I did mix it well before putting it all in the dish! The only thing I did different from the recipe was leave out the potatoes/taters.

This was wonderful.  I made a couple of minor additions / changes but I don't think it really altered the recipe much.  I forgot to buy the Adobo Seasoning so used Garlic / Herb etc, I added a layer of fresh spinach before the adding the last layer of cheese etc, and then because we're not huge Tater Tot fans, we used diced seasoned hashbrowns instead.  My husband loved it and we decided we're going to try using Pepper Jack cheese the next time to give it a little more kick.

Having a bad day? Needing some ultimate comfort food? This is the recipe for you. Such an amazing dish. I made it exactly as directed and broiled it for 5 minutes past the baking time to crisp up the tater tots. It turned out amazing.the only change I will make in the future is to make sure all the tater toys sit on top, otherwise they don't reach their full, crispy potential.

My husband and daughter loved this.  My husband said it was one of the best things I ever made and my daughter asked if I could make it everyday. I doubled the bacon because of a review I read but even then my husband said I should double that.  He also said if I left out the brocoli it would be way better...I told him tough.  I gave it 4 stars because it definately needed salt but besides that it was great.  I also suggest using more tater tots.

Not great.  Couldn't taste adobo at all, even with half the amount of pasta.  I substituted BBQ chicken because I didn't have bacon.  Pre-cooked potatoes for about 10 minutes to make sure they were done and a little crispy.  It was OK, but nothing to write home about, and it was definitely a lot of mess to clean up with preparation.  Fortunately, I could clean while the meal was cooking, which was a bonus.  Would work best for a side dish at a potluck instead of a main dish at home, especially with the fat content.

Good recipe!  I cut the recipe in half and it filled a 9 x 13 pan.  I didn't have tater tots so I just cut up some potatoes.  I cooked the potatoes in the left over bacon grease, and then added the onions and broccoli.  I mixed everything in the drained pasta pot and poured it in the casserole dish.  I saved some cheese, and topped it off with some Italian bread crumbs to add a bit of a crust/crunch.  Delish!

I was surprised by how much I really liked this, since I originally decided to make it just to use up some ingredients I had on hand.  I used a lot of extra broccoli, a few extra tater tots, and used onion powder in place of onion.  I had made some extra bacon the previous day, so that saved me from having to cook it for this meal, I just took it out of the fridge and diced it up. To make less dirty dishes I did not cook my broccoli in the skillet, but added it to the pasta while it was boiling.

pretty good... I'll try it again and doctor it up some.
I'll add more Adobo, and thaw the tots first.
I'd also recommend increasing the oven temp to 375 for the full 45mins! *Enjoy*

I used Kraft mac and cheese from a box. I did not have Broccoli so I used some leftover spinach. I used vegetarian Tots. My wife loved it.

This is very tasty, well worth the effort. As per others, you may wish to cut down the macaroni to 10 to 12 oz., and increase the bacon and broccoli. There's a recipe for Adobo seasoning here, but I just take all the spices and sprinkle them lightly on top before mixing. I've also made this with California style frozen veggies, about 3 cups or so, and use the bacon grease instead of butter.

This is delicious but really rich.  Since trying this recipe, I made my usual Mac n cheese recipe with cheese sauce and just added the bacon and caramelized onions.  Delicious and easy. Just add the bacon and caramelized onions to your favorite Mac n cheese recipe.
