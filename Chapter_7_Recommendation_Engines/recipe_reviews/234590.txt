I've made this for our tailgates for the last 2 years and EVERYONE loves it. I've given the recipe out more times then I can count. So simple but crazy flavorful. It's also great with Ritz crackers.

This is a great go-to in a hurry dip recipe that tastes great and allows you to change up according to your liking. I didn't layer I mixed it all up and baked. I also put it under the broiler for a minute to finish up browning.
