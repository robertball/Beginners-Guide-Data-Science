the cookies were so thin that they crumbled. put 1/2 the dough in a baking dish to try to  bake it into bars. perhaps I overbeat the shortening & butter?  too bad because they had a nice flavor. perhaps I can eat it as granola...

These were wonderful.  As you can see by my picture I made these into bars. I was working and didnt have time to make multiple sheets of cookies... and baking and working sometimes isnt a good fit and I burn things so one time in the oven was all I could handle  :D My only  change was the nutmeg.. 1/2t is a lot.. most recipes call for a pinch or maybe 1/8t   .. I used 1/4t and it was plenty. I topped the bars with a light sprinkle of cinnamon sugar
