After reading all the prior reviews I made a few adjustments. This is a fantastic recipe, I just adjusted it to fit our taste. I upped the oven temperature to 300. I doubeled the coating. I baked them for the maxium time noted. I then took them out and stirred them up. I used cinn/sugae and sprinkeled it generousally all ove the nuts and stirred again. I then put them back in the oven until the were no longer shiny. They came out just like the nuts in the mall. Crunchy, slightly sweet and impossible to keep you hands off of!

I was impressed at how easy these were to make.  I wish I had read all the reviews first, so I would have added some cinnamon, but they were still good.  The only difference is that I used parchment paper instead of wax paper and I did not spray it.  They did not stick at all.  Thanks for a very easy and tasty treat.

This is a good recipe (I added about 1/2 tsp cinammon to it - yummy!) but you really have to do what it says.  The eggwhite must really be STIFF.  If it isn't the nuts will be soggy and stick together.  In order not to add anymore moisture, I used Reynolds Release foil and ditched the PAM spray.  Even still, I found they needed to be baked longer (maybe 1/2 hour total)and that as they were cooling, I had to turn them to get them dry all around.  They stored nicely for almost a month in a ziplock bag.  They were the perfect addition to my Citrus Splash Salad!  These will be trotted out in my house again at Christmas time for sure!

I made these last year after reading everyone's comments.  What a hit!  I adapted the recipe by
doubling all the coating ingredients for the 4 cups of pecans; I also added 1 tsp honey and about 1 TBSP cinnamon to mixture.  Then after laying out on baking sheet, I heavily sprinkley
mixed cinnamon sugar over them.  I did bake about 40 minutes and cooled on racks.  They were such a hit last year, I'm making 24 cups of nuts, pecans and almonds this year.

This recipe was excellent.  I made them to give as Christmas gifts for extras at our usual family gathering.  My husband almost wouldn't let me give them away.  I altered the recipe slightly...I doubled the ingredients except for the egg white, added 1 Tbsp. of cinnamon, 1 tsp. honey, and sprinkled them with cinnamon sugar before baking.  I also baked mine for about 25-30 minutes.  *NOTE* It doesn't matter if you spray the wax paper with cooking spray...they still stick.  As soon as they are done remove them from the wax paper, or you will be picking it off the back of the hard candy.

These are just like store bought candied pecans!  I had to cook mine much longer (I eventually turned up the oven to 350), but they came out perfectly.  Thank you for the recipe!

With the following changes, I found these to be addicting: Doubled the coating (or half the amt. of nuts),add cinnamon and xtra vanilla. I also found this took longer to cook-ALSO don't forget to greese the wax paper, that makes a huge difference!

I've been making these for years.  I do it a little differently.  I use 2 egg whites and I only use a whisk and beat them until they're really frothy but not stiff.  I use part white sugar and part brown sugar and definitely add cinnamon.  After beating the egg whites I just add 1 pound of pecan halves and pour them onto a large baking sheet that's been sprayed with cooking spray.  Make sure have a sheet big enough so that you don't have to pile them on top of each other or they stick together and don't toast up as well.  I bake them at 250 for 1 hour and stir them every 15 minutes.  You get beautifully toasted and crunchy pecans every time.  The longer roasting time really brings out the flavor of the pecans and you never get soggy ones.  This is a family favorite year round.

These taste pretty good, but look terrible.  
Did I do something wrong?  The coating is a funny tan color, and the pecans are all puffy and oddly shaped.  They don't really have a pecan shape anymore.  I'd hoped to use these as a garnish on a cheesecake, but they just don't look very appetizing.  I would make these again if they were just for me to snack on, but I wouldn't serve them to anyone else.

I literally made these on my lunch break.  So quick and easy and they were delicious.  I made them for salad, but everyone ended up eating them like candy, so I'm gonna have to make another batch. TFS

I also added cinnamon and honey to the mixture, but I'm not sure if I added to much or if I did not bake them long enough, but they turned out a little on the tacky side, to combat that problem, I just coated them with a cinnamon/sugar(just regular granulated) mixture and that seemed to solve the problem.  I also made this recipe with almonds and walnuts...boy did they disappear fast!!

This recipe was fantastic!! It took no time at all and was really good. I put the cooked pecans into a Ziploc bag and shook some confectioner's sugar over them as a coating. It adds a wintery effect to this treat!

Perfect.  Exactly what I wanted.  I did find they do better if you let them dry on the pan for at least an hour after baking...

This recipes is fun, quick and easy  to make. I added cinnamon and HONEY. It was really tasty! Several friends call about this snack. The honey does add a little more sweetness if you would like it sweeter. I love to give these as gifts during Christmas in cute little clear containers. I would highly recommend the recipe. ENJOY!!!

I have a similar recipe that I have been making for a few years, but can't find anymore.  This one is pretty close, and plenty good. I doubled the coating, adding a bit of cinnamon and a bit more vanilla. Because I doubled the coating, I added about half a cup extra pecans. I like my pecans coated very well, but I hate wasting good coating that ends up as crumbs after being cooked since it is not covering anything.  I got extra candy coated pecans out of it, so it was a win for everyone in my family.  Also, I usually cook for longer than 10 - 15 minutes and at a temp of 300 - I just keep stirring every 5-7 minutes to make sure all the pecans are being cooked evenly and the coating is evenly distributed. I probably do this 4 times so I cook my pecans about 20-25 minutes.  You can tell when they are done. They lose the wet shiny look.

Oh my goodness!!  Wow these were great.  They turned out perfectly - my husband couldn't keep his hands off of them.  I followed the directions pretty closely, except I added about a T of cinnamon and put them in a 300 degree oven for 15 minutes, then took them out and stirred them a bit and returned them to the oven for about another seven minutes.  Sooooo good.  I think I will try the recipe with almonds next.

Wonderful!  Used some of the tips from other reviewers - 1/4 c white, 1/4 c brown sugar, 1/2 vanilla, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, baked at 300 a longer time.  I stirred the mixture after 15 minutes, then returned to the oven for another 15, stirred again, and then gave it about 10 more minutes and cooled on the pan.  Crispy, sweet and delish!!!!

Great tasting snack.  My grandson can't get enough of these.  I even made a big batch with chopped pecans and use them on some of my cakes and on the topping for my Sweet Potato Casserole.  These have a really great flavor and are super easy to make.

OH MY GOSH!!!!  THESE ARE SOOOOO GOOD!  When they come out of the oven I can't stop eating them!  The only thing I found is that the recipe says it only takes 15 minutes, but mine took almost 45 min. with me stirring every 5-10 before they were no longer sticky.

I've made these a number of times according to the directions and they were wonderful. The last time I made them I followed the advice of others and removed them from the oven after about 15 minutes, coated with additional sugar and cinnamon, stirred and baked for a total of about half an hour. They were even better.

These were fine, how can you go wrong with pecans and sugar? I think it is crucial to get your egg white to a "stiff" state, otherwise the pecans just absorb the liquid, resulting in the puffy, mushy ones others have complained of. I like to put my pecans in a separate bowl, and then add the sugar/white mixture to them, spoonful by spoonful. This way you can control how heavily you coat your pecans.

This is a good recipe....but I admit I did make some changes based on what other reviewers said they did.  I followed the directions exactly up until I put them into the oven.  I baked them for about 5 minutes, then I removed them and coated them again.  Then I sprinkled cinnamon and brown sugar on them and baked them until done.  My husband and my sister loved these...I made 3 batches and they were gone in a day!  I plan to make these for Christmas gifts.

Oh My! These are an instant winner with my Hubby and my 3 yr. old! I did follow other user suggestions and: doubled the coating mixture, add 1 tsp. cinnamon and 1/2 tsp. vanilla. YOU HAVE TO BEAT THE EGG WHITE UNTIL STIFF! They look all foamy when you put them down on the parchment paper (use it it's great) but once you stir them a couple of times they are picture perfect. I baked them at 300 degrees for 30 minutes, stirring twice. EXCELLENT and ADDICTIVE, as good as the nuts at the mall vendors! My family said this is something I have to make on a regular basis now! They would go great on a Christmas cookie tray!

This is a very good, easy, and quick recipe to make.  My daughter and I like nuts so we had to hide these from OURSELVES because we were so tempted. Thanks Jan for a great recipe.  This is a keeper in my house.

Sorry, but we didn't care for these. Could just be a matter of taste but we prefer nuts that are crisp. Better to eat pecans roasted as everyone at the party did not care for the grainy seasoning either.

Three words can describe this...YUM! YUM! YUM!  They REALLY good.  I doubled the recipe and added about 1 tsp. of honey in the batter and added some cinnamon.  When they were done I put them in a bag with powdered sugar and coated them really well then shook off the excess with a sifter so they wouldn't be TOO sweet.  Over all...really really good.

I used a variety of nuts, but, I have to say that I don't think cashew do well.  I would suggest either walnuts or pecans.  I also added a tiny amount of ground ginger, cloves and cinnamon.  I liked this recipe, but, it isn't my favorite.  It's not very sweet.  Make sure you use a big cookie sheet because they will cook in clumps if they aren't spread out enough.

This was a hit at my office and at home with the kids.  Really need to make sure you bake in single layer.  I did pecans and almonds, and sprinkled all with a ton of cinnamon sugar.  They turned out well, and I will make them again next year.  I put them in cute little glass dishes and gave them as gifts to my coworkers.

I used one pound of pecans rather than four cups.  Because we have a number of diabetics in our family, I used Splenda's Brown Sugar Blend instead of regular brown sugar.  You use 1/2 of what a recipe calls for, so it was 2T of the blend.  I think if I would have used all four cups there may not have been enough coating for my taste.  All in all, they're definitely something I would make again!

Not as good as the ratings made me think, however the kids did like them. I'm looking for something a bit more sugary, so not that the recipe was bad, just not what I was thinking.

I used about 10 oz. of pecans. It was almost like a merangue coating. I used parchment paper and ther was no sticking. I tried to spread them out on the cookie sheet so they were seperate. Cooked them al little longer after flipping them. Addictive!!!

I rated the recipe as written, but I have since made several changes which in my opinion has improved the flavor/texture. Double the topping and use half white/half brown sugar and add a generous teaspoon of cinnamon.  Bake at 300 degrees for 30 minutes.  When it gets out of the oven I did sprinkle with a little bit more cinnamon sugar, but it probably doesn't need it.  Super crunchy and impossible to resist!  I have to hide these from the kids and my husband so we don't eat them all the first day!

I found this recipe in USA Weekend. I wish I'd read some reviews before I prepared my first batch of nuts. I used pecans and almonds. The first batch came out VERY bland following the recipe. I ended up adding cinammon to the next batch and was a little more generous with the vanilla. They tasted 100% better. It also took closer to 25 minutes for the nuts to brown.

This is an awesome recipe.  I did alter it a little.  I used 1 cup brown sugar, 1 tbsp. Honey and 1 tsp. Vanilla. I sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top before I baked it. I cooked it for 30 minutes. I used my Pampered Chef stone and they did not stick at all!! Thanks

I love these.  They were not what I expected when I made them the first time (expected the really sugary sweet ones you get at Christmastime), but still delicious.  I make them for every party.  Very easy...and SO addictive.

I just made these for a Holiday Party and everyone loved them.  I did let them bake a little longer so that the coating on the pecans that were stuck together would cook through.  I also made sure thatthey air dryed so that they wouldn't be tacky.  Couldn't have been easier!!  Maybe a dash of cinnamon next time!  Thanks for the recipe.

I was a little surprised that a recipe called "candy-coated" pecans was not any sweeter, but all in all it tasted good. Next time I make these I think I would cut the amount of nuts down so they might get more of an even coating. Thanks for sharing.

This was so easy to put together!  My kids don't like nuts but that just leaves more for me!  
I think next time I will add a tsp of cinnamon to the coating.  But this is definitely a keeper!

I've made these twice now, and they are soooo yummy. Instead of 4 cups of pecans, I used a mix of pecans, almonds, and cashews, they all turned out great. If you like them sweeter, try doing the recipe as called, then making another batch of the coating, and put in the already cooked (and cooled) nuts for a double candy coating. Yum.

This is a delicious and easy recipe!  Like the other reviewers suggested, I increased the amount of brown sugar and added cinnamon.  I also didn't have any sticking problems with the parchment paper.  I tried them right out of the oven and the nut seemed to have gotten too soft, but they crisped up quickly.  They're light and airy and soo delicious!  I'm making more tonight!

These are good I doupled the egg. brown sugar, and vanilla which I will not do again.  I think it made to much coating.  Adding cinnamon was a nice extra.  And I was parchment paper and had NO problem with them sticking.

Got candied pecans in Gatlinburg and thought I'de try to make them.  This pecan treat was every bit as good as the one we paid $5.00 for a small sleeve of!!  They are quick and delish!!  I did follow the suggestions and put some cinnamon and a sprinkling of white sugar in the mix and cooked at 300 for 28 min.  This is a keeper!

great easy recipe. i made 2 batches. the 2nd batch i added 1/4 cup brown and 1/4 white sugar instead. i found adding white sugar gives it a crispier candy like coating. i also added lots of cinnamon as suggested by others. Overall, very yummy

This is a great recipe. I used the wax paper and sprayed lightly with cooking spray.  I had no problems at all with sticking.  I add 1/4 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the egg white mixing thoroughly before adding the brown sugar.  My oven is a convection oven; I found the pecans came out best when cooked for 25 mins at 275.  When I took the pecans out of the oven I took them off the cookie sheet, still on the waxed paper and put them on my counter top to cool.  About 5 mins into the cooling process I broke the pecans apart to avoid clumping and turned them over so they would dry and not be soft or sticky.  Works perfect every time. These pecans make an excellent gift and are a huge hit with family and friends.

I made these but with white sugar while I was living in bulgaria. I always roast the pecans for 15-20 before coating them, and this eliminates the possible sogginess of the pecans.  Tried to make them again tonight with brown sugar and found them a bit sweet. I'll make them again, but stick with my white sugar. :)

I've been making these nuts for years. I've never beaten the egg white until stiff just until foamy. I bake at 350 for one hour stirring every 15 minutes. They come out perfect every time.

These are fantastic!  I used 2 cups pecans and added 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper (next time I'll use 1/2 tsp for more heat). I cooked at 300 for 20 min. and they are perfect.  Thanks for the easy recipe. I'm going to make these for holiday gifts.

We've used this recipe a lot, with pecans, almonds, or walnuts.  We all prefer the pecans, but the other nuts are a nice change sometimes. I usually add some cinnamon and nutmeg. I also usually toast the nuts slightly and let cool before coating and baking.  After baking I also let them "dry out" in the oven a while with the oven turned off. Thanks for the recipe.

WOW are these delicious.  No, they may not look as appealing as some things, but boy do they make up for it in taste!!  They tasted similar to New York City Pecans, but not quite the same.  I added about a teaspoon of cinnamon and a teaspoon of honey.  I made sure that the egg white was very stiff, I beat it for probally 7 minutes.  This also made more than 4 c. of pecans for us.  It made more like 6c.  If I used 4c. they were saturated in the candy mixture, so I added more nuts.  Baked them for about 20 - 25 minutes, because I forgot to set the timer, but they came out yummy all the same.  I actually don't think they would have been done at 15 minutes.

I made these for my dad on Fathers Day and he couldn't put then down. I added about a teaspoon of cinnamon to the mix. Very good!

Really good, but even better sprinkled with cinnamon sugar before baking.  Took longer than the recipe stated to bake, but I made a large batch.  Ended up leaving them in for 40 min., but they are great.  My 2 year old loves them!

I thought I followed the recipe exactly, but I must have made a mistake somewhere. These tasted good, but didn't turn crispy, even after baking longer and letting them dry completely. I'll probably try a different recipe next time.

I made these last night. I did not use vanilla; I only used the brown sugar. I altered the amounts a little, I used 1/3 cup of brown sugar, 1 egg white, and about 1 1/2 cups of pecans. I baked for 15 minutes at 300, then stirred and baked for 5 more. I let them cool, and they were awesome. Thanks :)

I took advice of others - doubled coating ingredients, added 1 Tbsp of cinnamon, baked at 300 degrees for 15 minutes then stirred and sprinkled generously with cinnamon sugar, stirred again, baked for another 5 to 10 minutes- until they weren't shiny anymore.  Lined the pan with parchment paper and didn't have any sticking problems.  Using them with the "Eat Michigan" salad on this site.

I use two egg whites beat until just frothy, half brown and half white sugar.  Add cinnamon.  Bake 1 hr @250, stirring every 10-15 minutes.  YUM!

I love this recipe.  I baked them for 1 hour and they got really crunchy.  They are so addictive.  They remind me of my mother's boiled icing recipe.  I omit the vanilla because I think it overpowers the recipe, but I add a bit of cayenne pepper.  Yummy.  They are in the oven right now!!!

So easy and delicious!  I made these with the addition of 1/4 tsp cardamom for Christmas gifts.  I did not double the coating as in some reviews as I found the coating to be just fine, though they did take a bit longer to cook.  Love them!  Thanks, Jan!

I followed others advise and doubled the recipe. I used 1Kg of pecans about 9cups. I used 4 eggs 2 cups sugar (again following other advice to use some white sugar), vanilla and lots of cinnamon. I ran out of white sugar so I couldn't make it half and half. I used about 2/3 cup white the rest brown. The egg formed stiff peaks. Used parchment paper, no sticking problems. baked at 300 for 30 mins stirring every 10mins as others suggested. Out of the oven I left them on the paper and stirred them every so often. They harddened nicely. As they cool they get harder.

Awesome recipe! Taste EXACTLY like the candied pecans you get from the mall. My husband and I started eating them before they even cooled down! The only suggestion I have is to add in some cinnamon.

Excellent recipe. I read a lot of reviews of this recipe and I did modify some by baking at 300 degrees, adding 1/2 tsp. of cinammon, and baking 30 min. The pecans came out dry, cruncy and delicious!

Wow! I adjusted per others comments. Cooked at 325 for 15 mins, added sugar and cinnamon, and then cooked an additional 10 mins.  I did not have enough pecans so I added 2 cups of corn Chex to supplement. The nuts are great but the Chex turned out awesome too....crunchy, sweet, and good flavor.

These came out okay - I might have whipped the egg too much becuase they came out with a coating that was the texture of meringue.

I made these for a fried chicken salad. I wanted something sweet, but not overpowering, and these were it. Hubby (who hates nuts) said they made the salad restaurant quality. And they were good to eat by themselves too! Other than halving the amount of pecans used I followed the recipe exactly. It was SO easy! Thank you!!

Addictive!  Doubled first 3 ingredients and added cinnamon.  Very yummy in a salad with mixed greens, red onion, avocado, craisins, havarti and a sweet brown sugar/balsamic vinaigrette.

SUPERB!!  I added probably 1tsp cinnamon; doubled the recipe.  Cooked at 300 for 15 min, stirred, 15 more minutes, stirred more and then cooked another 8 minutes.  I was disappointed when I first tried them a little bit warm and they were a little mushy.  I let them cool completely and they were PERFECT!!  Don't be fooled by them until they are totally cooled.  THESE ARE AWESOME!!  THANKS for the recipe!!

Very easy and good.  They are great for a party, just set out bowls of them and they will disappear.  Don't forget the cooking spray though, I did and some of them ended up in the garbage because of stuck on wax paper.

I wasn't super impressed with these.  We used less pecans hoping for more coating, but it still wasn't sweet like the store bought kind.  Oh well... thanks anyways.

I made 2 pounds of these on Thursday, they were gone on Sunday with only 2 people eating them.  Very good, but I am not going to make them again until Xmas because they are so addictive.  I added the vanilla paste from Trader Joes and we could really taste the vanilla flavor.  Thank you for this one.

OK folks, we, in my house like sweets a lot. So, I doubled the amount of coating for the 4 cups of pecans added about 1 1/2 tsp of vanilla and gave them a cinnamon and sugar coating while still hot and I couldn't get them to stop eating them. My husband said they reminded him of the hot pecans we got when we went to disney world.

I made this recipe to have people to try in hope of giving it out for christmas presents.  Now people can't wait until christmas to get more!  I did mess up the recipe and added a whole egg instead of just an egg white, but it turn out fine.  Since reading the reviews I think next time I will try add a bit of honey.  Thank for the recipe!  They sell this at the mall for an extreme amount of money and only on the holidays, now i can make this anytime i want!

Used these at Christmas time to compliment my boxed cookie gifts. I got rave reviews on it. Very easy to make.

I made these nuts for some Christmas goody baskets.  They were a definite hit! Don't be shy on the cooking spray, however. I had to peel them all off the wax paper and some were too stuck to be saved. My parents loved them and it's an easy recipe!

I had to add a little honey, as I was afraid of it not being sweet enough - I did have to bake it a little longer though.  I used aluminum foil sprayed with cooking spray.  I agree with the other reviewer who said that the pecans need to be separate to look nice.  Ditto on this being addictive - I separated the pecans after baking and it was 'one for me, one for them.....'  Really good, thanks!

Easy!  I read previous reviews and sprinkled with cinnamon & sugar but think they still needed to be sweeter.  Next time I will also add honey to egg white & brown sugar and sprinkle more cinnamon & sugar on them once on baking sheet.  Mine baked for about double the cooking time.

I have always used another recipe for candy pecans, but after whipping this up on Saturday, I'll never go back.  It's so simple and I took them to my office.  They were gone instantly.  Everyone asked for the recipe.  A real winner!!!
Thanks.

This recipe is wonderful AND easy!  The prep time was less than 10 minutes; the cleanup was very easy also!  I think I may try sprinkling some cinnamon on them the next time. I would suggest this recipe to anyone looking for a quick and easy way to make something sweet to have at home or give as gifts!  EXCELLENT!

I made these per the recipe except I added vanilla.  I did not add cinnamon as others suggested because I was making them for a salad that I did not want to add that flavor to.  I baked at 300 for 15 minutes, stirred, and baked another 15 minutes.  Yummy in a salad or as a snack.  Thank you for this recipe.

Very good basic recipe. I also tried it with mixed nuts, but the pecans were the best. I added a little spice to give them little more flavor.

Doubled the coating and baked till crispy, stirring every 10 minutes and tossed with extra sugar and cinnamon, as others suggested.  I also did a batch with almonds.  I believe it was a 16 oz bag that worked well with a double coating.

Easy to make and delicious!   I used the amount of coating in the recipe for 2 cups pecans and it was just right.  I stayed with the 275 F that the recipe asked for but needed to bake for almost 25 min (stirring every 10 min or so).  The pecans came out with just the right amount of sweetness and very crispy.

I wanted to use these in a salad and was wanting more of a glazed pecan. These came out pretty ugly. The taste was ok. The egg white makes them very light and crisp. I stirred every ten minutes and it took about 1/2 hour.

I was at my cottage with limited supplies and wanted some candied nuts for a salad.Tried this recipe and they turned out exactly as I'd hoped!The only change I made was a generous shake with the salt shaker after they were on the parchment paper lined sheet and I roasted them for 30 minutes at 290 degrees.Thanks for the great recipe!!!

I had to add a lot of sugar and cinnamon to get the coating sweet enough.  The egg did give a nice crunch to the pecans.

Wonderful and easy--I've never whipped an egg white in my life, but I did it perfectly--twice, because I had to make 2 batches! I followed Carolynanne's suggestions, except I used 3 cups of pecans per batch. These will be gifts I am proud to give!

Easy and delicious!  Nice balance between nutty and sweet.  Used parchment paper without cooking spray and it was fine.  Next time I'll add cinnamon to the mix.

My family LOVES these. I am giving them 4 stars because as written they are very good, but if you add the extra cinnamon and sugar toward the end like a previous reviewer suggested, then they are worth 5 stars. I use them in cream cheese frosting on carrot cake and it's to die for!

I love making these myself to put on salads because they are cheaper than buying candied ones at the store.  I just add a little cinnamon and salt to the recipe and my husband & I love them.

They sell something similar to these at in the bulk foods section of the grocery store. I added 1/2 tsp orange extract, along with a dash of vanilla extract. They were perfect (and much more affordable than the ones at the store).

I added some cinnamon as well and upped the temp to 300 deg.  I tripled the recipe and doubled the pecans.  We had to make a  large batch as I also had trouble getting them away from the family.  My 15 yr. old son made them and enjoyed it.  I served them at a wedding accompanied by fresh fruit.  Big hit!

These are very good.  They made an ordinary spinach salad to die for.  I brought the extra to my parents' house for New Years, and everyone loved them.  My only cautionary note: make sure you remove them from the pan if you are using wax paper and let them cool on something else.  Otherwise, there will be small, hard to remove wax paper pieces stuck to the pecans.  Next time, I'll try my Silpat.

These pecans are delicious. Per another reviewer's suggestion, I added cinnamon/sugar and honey to the mix -- nice addition. I didn't beat my egg white long enough though, so it took longer for these to bake.

Amazing!  I followed the advice of others and added the cinnamon into th mix. Also, I used both white and brown sugar (kept at 1/2 cup total, more brown than white).  I'm serving the pecans as a generous garnish on my artisan cheese plate!

I found this recipe easy to follow and liked how simple the ingredients were. However, I came across similar problems as others had, with having to increase the temperature to 300 degrees, increasing the amount of time baking and adding cinnamon to give them a bit more flavor. I also like them to be a bit more sugary - this may be due to the fact that I added a bit more pecans to finish the rest of the bag. All in all, after some trial and error and practice, it will be a wonderful, tasty snack!

We make these every year for my b.f.'s "what do you get the people who have everything" grandparents during the holidays. They're always a BIG hit. I use parchment paper on a cookie sheet, to minimize sticking/cleanup time. I generally cook the pecans longer than the recipe states to get them nice and crisp - probably about 20 minutes or so.

These didn't look pretty at all when they came out.  My brother thought they were dog biscuits! I wasn't expecting them to be so addictive!  I used half the pecans but kept the coating the same (so essentially I doubled the coating) as suggested.  Worked very well. We ate the whole batch in one afternoon.

The recipe was good. I followed the advice of another reviewer and coated the nuts in brown sugar and cinnamon after baking them, then put them back into the oven.

They weren't as sweet as expected. My family said they were "Ok" and then proceeded to do so much taste testing I had to make them stop! I'll make them again, maybe adding some other flavors.

I made this recipe for a bake sale.  Everyone was going crazy over them.  We sold a little over half of them and someone bought all that we had left.  This is an item that they said I have to bring from now on.  Thank you so much for the recipe!! :)

These pecans are very easy to make and also very tasty. If you like your pecans sweet, I do recommend to double the sugar coating. I made it exactly like the recipe, had a taste, then made some more of the coating and redipped the pecans and baked for an additional 8-10 minutes. I think this helped a lot. They were perfect for me! But most definately a GREAT recipe!!!

I increased the oven temp to 325 and really made sure to beat the egg white to a stiff consistancy.  I, too, added a bit of honey and have decided that next time I will increase the brown sugar by about 1/4 cup.  This was a nice recipe, not a sweet as I would have liked, but will definately make again with more sugar!

These weren't quite what I was looking for, but they weren't bad either.  I think I was expecting a sugary-looking coating, instead of the complete covering I ended up with.  Guests over the holidays really enjoyed them.

These were great!  I did have to cook them longer than stated but it wasn't a problem.  They are best when fresh but I used them to sprinkle over my cookie tray gifts for people and the family liked them just as well at our Christmas eve dinner as the people did who got their trays the week before.  Thank you for sharing your recipe.

not as sweet as I thought they would be. I thought it would be more like praline coated pecans. I sprinkled granulated sugar after 15 min and baked them a lil more. They really taste better the next day after they are totally dry. Not what I expected but pretty good!

These are very tasty- but make sure you bake them in a single layer- otherwise they clump together & don't brown well.

We have a sweet tooth in my family, so next time I make this I'm going to use only 3 1/2 cups of nuts so ther is more coating.  I also tried a batch with almonds, which was also good.

Great recipe, I made these for Christmas. Based on advice from the other reviews I added some cinnamon to it. Next time I'll add more because I like the spicier flavor. It took a little longer to cook than instructed. Just keep checking the nuts every 15 minutes or so, stirring them on your baking sheet until dry. Great!

So delicious! I can't stop eating them!  I made the original amount of coating, but did add a sugar and cinnamon sprinkle 15 minutes after cooking them at 300 F.  Then I stirred them and put them back in for another 15 min after which I still felt they weren't crunchy enough.  So I turned the oven off and left them in for about 30 more minutes - perfect crunchy and dry pecans!

I sprayed the wax paper with Pam but once they dried on the wax paper after cooking they completely stuck to the wax paper.  Also, they're not all that tasty.

So, I over did it...doubled the recipe w/ 4c pecanz.  Grabbed a couple healthy pinches of cinnamon.  Beat the eggs w/ the kitchenaid fast for like 5+ minutes (lost track of time).  Boom - it's pecan brittle.

We loved this, and I would give it five stars if the baking time weren't so far off. I adjusted the recipe and bake time after reading reviews. Used one whipped stiff egg white, 1 cup brown sugar packed, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1 & 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1/4 tsp butter extract and 4 cups pecan halves. Spread it out onto non stick foil, baked 10 minutes. As it is extremely gooey at first, I stirred and dumped it all onto a new sheet of non stick foil before returning to oven. Baked 20 more minutes stirring after the first 10. They came out perfect after a full 30 minutes at 275 degrees. Cooled slightly, dumped onto wax paper to finish cooling and broke apart clumps before they hardened. Then I jarred them and fancied up the jars with ribbon and gift tags for delicious Christmas gifts. May be our new holiday gift tradition! Irresistible!!

These pecans tasted outrageously sweet.  And as another reviewer said.....they have an unappealing tan color due to the coating.  I added 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon.  But I don't think that added to the sweetness.  I followed the 15 minutes in the oven as directed. But they turned out gummy and all stuck together.

I added 1 tbsp cinnamon, 1 tsp salt, and used 1/2c white and 1/2c brown sugar, and half the pecans, laid on wax paper with cooking spray, cooked 45 min at 300 degrees, stirring every 15 min. Turned out crispy and wonderful.

Love this recipe. I started making these after visiting Cajun country and coming home to Wisconsin with a LOT of pecans. I use half cup of white and brown sugar, 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, the vanilla, a good drizzle of Steen's pure cane syrup( also a gift from cajun country). After I get them all spread out on the greased parchment, I sprinkle very coarse sea salt sparingly over them all. That little salty bite is a nice addition to the sweet tasty pecans.

I should have read the reviews before making this recipe. I needed to double the coating and add cinnamon since I mainly just taste the pecans. I'll try it that way next time.

These were okay.  I followed the directions, only cooked an extra 5 minutes.  The texture is a little odd because of the egg whites I guess...almost fluffy like meringue. :)  And they are a little bland.  I will try again with the recommended changes from the other reviews, such as adding cinnamon. :)  Thanks for sharing!

UPDATED: I realize now I only used half the amount of called for pecans, and not double...that would account for my "meringue-ness" lol!

I also had to up the oven temp a bit, up to 300, and sprinkled cinnamon sugar over them in the middle of cooking. Mine needed turning after 10 minutes, and needed more like 20 minutes in the oven.

What a great recipe.   After reading the other reviews I doubled the coating ingredients and added cinnamon.   I baked at 250 for about 15 mins & then stirred them up and baked for another 15 mins.   Next time I'll make sure to flip each pecan over so they get a nicely browned.

Great for gifts! I upped the temp to 300 degrees and cooked for 30 minutes. I added 1 T cinnamon -because I put it in everything- and a dash of vanilla. I also added a dusting of cinn/sugar. Thanks!

I was looking for something similar to the pecans found in a pricey candy shop.  These are fantastic!  I sent them to my son, who was serving a mission in Australia.  Of all the things in his package, these were all he mentioned!  I make them all the time!  So easy AND yummy!

Simple and delicious!  I added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and 1/2 tsp. vanilla.  I ended up baking them for about 25 minutes until they were brown.  Be sure to immediately remove them from the paper when they come out of the oven.  These are so addictive!

Use white sugar instead of brown sugar and they get more crunchy. I also don't do the wax paper or greased pan. Just turn the pecans about half way through baking and they won't stick to the pan. Easy clean up if pan soaks in hot water.

Fantastic recipe!!! I made these for a holiday party and I had to refill the bowl at least five times. I took the advice of some of the reviewers by increasing the coating and adding cinnamon and honey. I used 8 cups of pecans and made 3x's the original recipe and added 3 tbls of cinnimon and 1 tbls of honey. PERFECT!!!!

Um, the only bad thing about this recipe is that once you eat one, you can't stop. These things are totally addictive! Yum!

These are pretty good.  I do agree with the previous reviews.  Definitely double the coating.  I sprinkled mine with cin/sugar also and they still turned out a little plain.

Flavor seems to be lacking.  Bake for 35 minutes at 300 degrees, stirring every 10-15 minutes.  If you have a teflon baking sheet, that eliminates the need for Pam and the nuts don't get soggy.

After reading many of the reviews and alterations, I came up with some of my own.
2 egg whites, 1 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup white sugar, 1 teaspoon vanilla, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and 6 cups pecans halves.  300 degrees for 20 minutes, stirred, 15 minutes, stirred, 5 minutes, stirred.  I think the white sugar made them a little too sweet, but still delicious.

These are really really good! They came out great! I added 1/2 tsp. of Cinnamon, and 1 tsp. of vanilla, 2 egg whites, and 1 C. of brown sugar. Kept the amt. of pecans the same. Thanks to CSG, I too am going to make the Pear and Blue Cheese Salad Recipe on this site and these are a part of it. Looking forward to it.
Oh so very tasty!

Excellent ~ I used these on the Pear and Blue cheese salad on this website - it calls for candied pecans and I had never made them before - these worked great (if you can stop eating them and save some for the salad!)

These turned out fantastic. The only thing that I did was add 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and I tossed the nuts 10 minutes into baking. The pecans were very light in texture and are great on their own or tossed into a salad. Yummy!

Not satisified with this either.  Tried both of them.  Seems as something is missing.  Needed to bake these longer to help 'dry' up the nuts/mixture.

Although a few of these are ok, I was not impressed with this recipe.  I expected more of a "glazed" nut and these were not.  Also, this makes a very large volume.

Not my choice of Sweetened pecans.  I did not like the looks of the pecans when they were finished.  I got the recipe from the USA WEEKEND magazine and showeed a picture of what they should look like.  Not mine! They were an unappetizing color and turned out mushy. They mentioned spices....What spices?

I have now made this recipe several times, and love it!  I have also substituted the pecans with almonds and they were also very delicious.  My children love to eat them as a snack but I also use them in my strawberry spinach salad recipe that I also got from allrecipes.  Thanks for sharing!!!

Tasty! Would be great on Ice Cream with carmel syrup! I also doubled the sugar, vanilla, about a cup more pecans and added honey and topped with cinnamon sugar before and after baking! My kids as well as the neighbor kids loved them!

Very easy. I instead roasted them for an hour on 250 degrees. Added a nice amount of cinnamon. Used Parchment paper instead of wax (always). A nice versatile recipe and it's great on its own or as an additive to other recipes. Can use on Salads, basically any dessert, and more if you're creative. Thanks.

I make these several times a year and these are my comments/changes. I double the coating. Make sure the egg white peaks are stiff ( I use a countertop mixer). I add a dash of cinnamon. Bake for 13 minutes at 300. Take out and use a spatula to turn over, put back in oven for about 10 more minutes. I baked on parchment paper sprayed with cooking spray - little/no sticking.

It was super easy, and super tasty! I doubled the coating recipe, then baked them at 300 degrees for 15 minutes. Took them out of the oven and stirred them around, sprinkled cinnamon and sugar on them and put them back in the oven and baked them until they absorbed the brown sugar. About 15 to 20 minutes.

After reading the reviews, I doubled the the coating, added a bunch of cinnamon, upped the temperature to 300, and kept the nuts in the oven for 15 minutes each batch. It worked perfectly! Wound up eating an entire batch (with help from those surrounding me) while waiting for the next batch to finish!

Great recipes. I used almonds instead of pecans and it turned out great. I also was in a hurry so turned up the temp in the oven to 275 and was able to decrease cooking time to 40 minutes. Easy recipe and it went over well for New Years. Everyone raved about them and they were almost gone by the end of the night. Thank you!

Ok these were very good but to make them great double all ingredients except egg whites. Beat the eggs until stiff peaks. Use Reynolds release foil and nothing will stick. I added some cinnamon and a drizzle of honey.

This is an excellent  and quick recipe.  As several other reviewers suggested, I used half brown and half white sugar.  I alsoI used parchment paper and eliminated any mess.  Mine only took 45 minutes - you really have to watch and taste!!  The pecans  were delicious.  Thanks for the recipe.  Will definitely make again.

I make them every year for Christmas, give some as part of gift baskets, and have had them in a Christmas sale for charity. Everyone loves them, and they are simple to make. Update: I should have included a couple of comments. First, I always add about 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon, and up the vanilla to at least 1/2 teaspoon, sometimes a full teaspoon. Depending on the size of the egg, I use three to four cups of pecans, bake in a 325 oven, usually about 15 minutes. I do stir the pecans during the baking time. They are wonderful, are always gobbled up quickly.

Delish!!! Followed suggestions in the reviews- made sure the whites were really stiff and I baked them about 30 minutes. I tried adding cocoa powder to the mix, and wow!! I also found stirring them right out of the  oven and sprinkling more sugar/cocoa while there was still a tiny bit of moisture gave them a tasty powdery coating. For future baking I want to try cinnamon and also a second coating and round of baking for a candy coating. Will probably rotate through the options just for tasty variety as the powdery finish was fabulous too :)

Delicious and deadly! Couldn't stop eating them.  So much better than the ones I buy at the store! I used vanillas extract instead of the water and used 8oz. pecans instead of 16 oz. and they were extra brown sugary coated!!

When I was a child, we had a neighborhood Pecan Orchard. They would make these every Christmas and let us have as many as we could put in a small bag for free. I have always wondered if I would someday find the recipe so I could make them myself, now that I am an adult. 

These turned out wonderful. What a taste treat, and what a wonderful memory they recalled in me.

Thank you.

These are AWESOME! I made 3 recipes off this site. 1-with sugar, 1- with sugar and vanilla, and these.. these were by far the best. so soft on the inside and ooooeeeyyy gooey on the outside with a nice crisp. and they weren't salty, crunchy like the others came out. I did cook them at a lower temp for longer though. I will definatly be making these again!

These are sooo addictive. My fav. guilty pleasure. They are extra great warm right out of the oven. I never use exact amounts of nuts or sugar but they always turn out. I omit the wax paper and just put them on a cookie sheet.    A friend of mine makes them with chilli flakes so they are sweet and spicey. That is a good version, but I prefer the original myself.

These nuts are just TOO good!  Follow the advice of others and add cinnamon.  Also, doubling the coating recipe just makes them that much more delish!

this quick and super easy recipe is a big hit! try a little cinnamon and ground cayenne pepper in the batter. what a kick! cook for 30 minutes or they will be too soft. remove from the wax paper when you remove the pecans from the oven or you will be eating it.

Delicious and simple. I used walnuts and couldn't stop nibbling.

Great recipe!

I'm not sure what went wrong, but I had too much coating for the pecans and they looked like misshapen lumps when I was done baking, however the flavor was very good so I put them in my processor, ground them up and used them for a nut crust for a cheesecake.  It was very good, but a lot of work for a crust.

I used frozen pecan halves in this.  I had to increase the cooking time, but otherwise I followed the directions exactly, and it turned out wonderful!  I couldn't stay out of them, in fact!  I made these to add to a Gorgonzola and Pear salad.  Perfect!

My family loved these, and it was so easy! It took more than 15 minutes to cook, about 30 minutes. And the suggestion of cinnamon to the recipe, made it extra special.

These taste just like the ones I get out of the health food section at the grocery store.  Those are $7/lb, I will continue to make these instead.

These are really good and I had no problem with sogginess - stored them in a ziploc baggie. Not the prettiest thing I've ever seen, but I will definately make them again. VERY easy to make.

I'm not a fan of nuts, but I made these for my husband to take to work. He and all the guys loved them. I thought they tasted ok. I prefer my mom's recipe that you make on the stovetop in a cast iron skillet.

Very good.  I recommend following the recipe to the letter.  I used 6 cups of pecans, 2 egg whites and 3/4 cup of brown sugar in my first batch and baked them on a larger sheet pan.  They did not come out nearly as good as the second batch using 4 cups of pecans and the recommended ingredients. I presented these pecans with Melt In Your Mouth Toffee (recipe on this site)in holiday tins for my neighbors.  Everyone asked for the recipes.

These are absolutely fabulous! My 6 yr old and I made them together and we'll never buy these from the mall vendors again! I might even experiment and add some extra spices next time. 

NOTE: We made 6 cups with this recipe.

Tasted very similar to the ones at the mall at Christmastime!  I used 2 cups of almonds and 2 cups of pecans, and added 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon to the mix!  Family can't keep their hands out of them!

We made these for a pre-thanksgiving dinner snack. They were awesome.  Everyone was afraid that people would fill up on them and then not be hungry, but when you're cooking all day and have 8 people in the house, these were a huge hit!

These were really yummy when eaten the same day as prepared.  The pieces that survived the first day of gobbling turned a little tough and chewy the next day.  Perhaps there was to much humidity in the air and they should be stored in an airtight container.  I definitely will make this recipe for my family again.

Good.  But I'm still looking for a recipe like the nuts they make at Six Flags theme parks and Times Square in NYC.  This recipe was a little less intensely flavored.
