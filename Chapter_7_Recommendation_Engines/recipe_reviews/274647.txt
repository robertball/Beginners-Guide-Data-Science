Very tasty side dish and a nice way to change things up. This makes quite a bit. I had to add a little bit of oil to the pan since I used lean center-cut bacon. I like my veggies al dente so I cooked mine less than the 10 minutes called for. Next time I might cook the bacon first then remove from the pan and add back in at the end. I found the moisture from the veggies made it a little soggy.
