This recipe has terrific flavor, but was a NIGHTMARE in my cookie press..... it wouldn't stick to the tray (I tried a baking stone, an airbake pan and a pan lined with silpat) and wouldn't come off the press without making them huge (like 3 pumps each).  I tried it chilled & fresh.  But, like I said, the flavor is awesome so I may try again but alter some of the ingredients

Very good.  The only thing wrong with this recipe - If you are wanting 96 cookies you'd better double the recipe - I have made this several times with the Pampered Chef cookie press and the most I've been able to make is about 45.

I really liked this recipe!  I thought the sweetness was just right and the flavors of the cinnamon and vanilla came together really well.  I also added a little bit of dried orange zest to the dough.  The only thing that I had a negative comment on was that the cookies came out slightly dry.  The texture was great, but my husband commented that he needed milk after eating a couple of them.  I used my new battery operated cookie press that the dough was sooooo easy to work with!  I was so excited, after many failed attempts with a cookie press.  Definitely a keeper and I'd appreciate if any other reviewer would comment on what I can do to help with the dryness.  Thanks!

This is the best spritz cookie I have ever tasted. It just melts in your mouth great flavor. I got more complements on these than any other cookies. I took half the batch and dipped it halfway in white chocolate coating and sprinkled colored sugar on them. Thank you Diana for a great cookie.

This one got lots of rave reviews, so I tried it.  My family hated them.  I can't eat wheat, so I didn't try them.  However, they said that they were bland and flavorless.  They also said they need more sugar.  I left them at church during a potluck, hoping someone would eat them.

These cookies are so good! I've made several batches of them in the past 2 weeks. Some for home, some for my husband to take to work and some for friends.  Everyone LOVES these cookies!  I will be including these in my cookie baskets this Christmas!  YUMMY! 

My only thought ~I think they NEED to have sugar sprinkled on top or they aren't quite sweet enough.  We made pumpkin and leaf shapes with orange sugar.  They disappeared FAST!

These were really good. My oven must vary so we chose 6 minutes as the best time for our cookies. They were just perfect!

i just took the last batch out of the oven and can't believe how great they turned out! I've been using this recipe for the last two years and finally decided to experiment.  I added nuts, vanilla beans, cocoa, a cinnamon/nutmeg mix, and unsweetened strawberry drink mix  each into a separate portion of the batter without cinnamon and with less sugar. Each turned out amazing.  I've used this recipe with three different cookie presses and my only complaint is that the presses don't last long :D

Great recipe. The dough handles perfectly. I did double the cinnamon and added a touch of fresh ground nutmeg. I sprinkled with colored sugar and baked for 11 minutes on an insulated cookie sheet. Perfect taste and texture. I have found your ingredients need to be very fresh, you cannot use parchment paper and you need a good cookie press. Thanks for the recipe.

I thought these were really gross. You couldnt taste anything but the flour. I kept adding more and more cinnamon and still there was nothing. It seemed like it took a long time to make as well.

These cookies are lacking.  Like others reviewers have said, they are very dry.  I even added an additional 2 TBSP of sour cream.  I made these for a baby shower.  So I added 3 drops of red food coloring to make the dough pink.  Once the cookies were baked and cooled I dipped them into melted white chocolate w/ a bit of shortening.  Then sprinkled right away with red and pink sugar.  They came out too cute!  Perfect for the baby shower I took them to.  And the chocolate made a HUGE difference to the dryness.  I will bake again!

Excellent flavor. The dough was a bit soft so I had to chill it before pressing it. I tinted it red so I could tell them apart from the plain spritz on my cookie platters. They were a big hit with everyone. I will be adding these to my yearly list of favorite Christmas cookies.

Great taste!  Watch out if you use a whole medium egg, and use less sour cream to get the same amount of liquid--they spread out!  These are worth making!

These cookies didn't work for me at all.  The dough was way too thick to go through the cookie press.  And the cookies burned in the oven after about 7 minutes.  I'm sure I got all the ingredients right, I just don't know how these can work.  I'm giving them two stars because I think if I can get them to not burn, then they will taste pretty good.

BLAH. Couldn't taste the cinnamon or the sour cream. In fact, I don't know why there is sour cream in this recipe. 1/3 cup didn't change the flavor or the texture. I *wont* make these again.

Perfect!  I just finished making a batch of these with my 6 year old.  He will not stop eating them!  He keeps telling me "oh this one is messed up" because I told him he could eat the mess ups!  The only thing was that we did not add cinnamon.  I already have a cinnamon cookie in the line up and wanted something without spice.  We did sprinkle colored sugar on these before baking, which adhered nicely.  I used the dough with the Wilton cookie press Pro.  This recipe was easy to mix, easy to use and fast.  Watch the baking time though, just one minute too much can really be too much.  These are best underdone than overdone, but either way, a great recipe.  I used unsalted butter and added the half tsp of salt, and it was perfect. A keeper for every year!

This spritz cookie is delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly, and they came out perfect.  My family loves them!  

I baked the whole batch without having to refrigerate the dough, and they held their shape, even until the last tray.  I brushed on egg white and added sprinkles.  I usually make a recipe with cream cheese, but this is going to be my new recipe from now on.

I made these for my cookie press, they turned out GREAT! I don't like sweets and these were perfect for me, not to sweet, but a good flavor with the seasonings added.
It wasn't quite sweet enough for the sweet lovers, but they still really enjoyed them...

They were very soft, and easy to make. I will make them again!!

These were very good, but they are super-easy to overcook. Be very aggressive with taking them out of the oven. I never had a batch that lasted the recommended time. They all needed to come out a couple of minutes early. These are great with the "Sugar Cookie Frosting" recipe on this site. It softens them up a little and gives an extra sweetness for those who like frosted cookies.

This was my second time using my cookie press and it was a MUCH easier task than the first time I tried! The dough was good to work with and probably should not be chilled (If the dough is too hard, it'd be more difficult to push out with the press or something like that). I added 1/2 tsp ground ginger, dash of nutmeg, and a dash of allspice to make it more flavorful, but the final cookie itself actually just needed more sweetness. It tasted a bit salty, but the texture was very good. Melts in your mouth. Next time, I would use more sugar or less salt. I had to frost some of them or added a chocolate chip in the center of the ones with the flower design. I kept switching the plate to experiment! I was very happy that the dough was so compliant -- I had almost cried the first time I used the press cuz I had been so excited to use it but was so frustrated that it wasn't working! I should've tried this recipe first.

Nice, simple recipe and the cookies are great.  I would suggest putting the dough in the refrigerator for about an hour before using the cookie press. This is a good recipe for children to practice making holiday cookies.

I thought I would make these since they got such great reviews.  They certainly were not a hit with my family.  They seemed bland and a little dry.  I won't be making these again.

Excellent dough for coloring and pressing; bakes into a light but flavorful cookie! I look forward to making these again next holiday season! (I have tried at least 5 spritz cookie recipies this winter... This one tops them all!)

I like these cookies. I did chill the dough first, but will not the next time.  The bottoms browned a little fast so I changed to an "air bake" sheet, then on my regular cookie sheets I used a "silpat" both worked well. Next time I may try a small amount of raspberry jam in the centers for a different taste.

I tweaked it  as well by using vegan margarine, Splenda, Greek yogurt for the sour cream and omitting salt for health reasons and increasing the spices with a touch of nutmeg.  FANTASTIC  and definitely a keeper.

Just made the cookies. They are okay but not great. I am used to spritz cookies made with crisco. I didn't like the sour cream addition at all. They did press well though.
