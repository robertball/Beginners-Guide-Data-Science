I made this recipe because I wanted to use up some macaroons that didn't turn out (spread out on the baking sheet).  The pie had a good texture and was quite rich (I'd probably cut the sugar by half if I make it again).

I made this with half the sugar, no pecans or coconut extract and this turned out great. My family said it
was "bakery good." I'll make it again.
