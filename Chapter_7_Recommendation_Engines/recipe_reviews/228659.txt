This was quite tasty - With some adjustments - I think very few could really enjoy it as written. I used 16oz of Medium salsa (that brand that's NOT made in New York City), which is pretty hot in its own right, only 3 of the chipotle peppers in adobo, the can of chilis & the lime. Once cooked, all we could really taste was HOT. I drained most of the juice (as that's where most of the heat was), then added a little mild salsa, adobo seasoning and a dash of worcestershire and let it go for another hour or so. The result was quite tasty, I have to admit, and I think we'd do it again, maybe use just the adobo sauce & pull out the peppers?

This is not for the faint of heart! My husband and I loved it, but our tongues were on fire long after we ate. I don't usually care for pork, but this was great.

Thanks for sharing this recipe. We loved this recipe and I will make this again! Though I have to admit I only used about 4 of the peppers in the can and 1/2 of the adobo sauce. I did add some bell peppers and a jalapeno since I had them. My husband Loved it!

Definitely use a pork loin roast!   The tenderloin is delicate and costs four times as much per pound.    Cut the roast into large (1.5-2") cubes to maintain texture during the cooking process.  Instead of hot picante, I use a jar of fire roasted tomato salsa...resulting in a nice rich sauce that supports the adobo without gratuitous heat.  AND ALWAYs garlic...LOTs of roughly chopped garlic!

For some reason, I ended up using pork loins instead... But it all turned out well. I was expecting this dish to be blazing hot as I used the entire can of chipotle peppers and a hot picante sauce. But surprisingly, it was delightfully hot without being over the top spicy. Next time I might try to use a pork roast instead for pulled pork.

Love this recipe! I make this frequently on the weekends then freeze it for easy meals during the week. I usually make 2 separate freezer meals from this. So delicious and easy!

My husband loves spicy food, but this recipe was too spicy even for him. I will definitely not make it again ay his request.

This recipe is ridiculously yummy!  I absolutely recommend it.  It is so flavorful - and great cold on sandwiches the next day.  I only used about 3/4 of the can of chipotle peppers with adobo sauce.  I was worried it would be way too hot.  It was fine and I will probably continue to use the same amount when I make it again. And I will definitely be making this again and again.

Everyone loved this!
We served it as tacos with soft corn tortillas.  We learned after the fact that we used medium instead of hot picante sauce - not sure which to recommend - it was great.  Thank You!

I'm gonna save you guys a load of time. Shred the meat with a hand mixer. Works like a charm, though you may want to remove the chipotles first if you don't want them shredded. I just finished shredding mine and I tried a couple of bites--it was delicious! I know our family will enjoy.

Easy and very tasty. I put all ingredients in an instant pot for 35 minutes. Only adjustment was adding 2tablespoons of chicken base. Served as a pork carnitas

Very hot. I followed the recipe to the tee, but after having tasted it at the seven hour I added a 14 oz can of diced tomatoes to cool the heat a little and to make it a little more moist.
