Made as written and this was the perfect blend of tart and sweet. The tart overpowered the sweet a tad but in a very good way. I threw everything into a ziplock bag a couple of days prior to serving with my pulled pork and chicken and it doesn't get any easier than this. I even forgot to massage it for a day but it was still perfect. It isn't much to look at because well it is just purple but the flavor combo is spot on.  The next time I make this I plan on using white cabbage (red cabbage stains everything purple) so that I can add carrots to incorporate more color.  Perfect to top pulled pork and chicken sandwiches and a keeper!

This was a nice variation to mayonnaise-based slaw.  I followed the instructions except that I did not have time to let it set for days.  Instead, I added all ingredients (including the oil) and let it set for about 30 min prior to serving.  I used a higher quality balsamic vinegar that (I think) made it taste smoother instead of overly tangy.  

I agree with the other reviewer that this slaw would benefit aesthetically from  added color - - perhaps some green onion and shredded carrot.  I will also consider adding a little crumbled gorgonzola and/or toasted sesame seeds the next time I make it. It is good "as is," though.

Tastes great with fresh cabbage from the farm stand in Hastings, Florida.

Seems like it was missing something for my family's taste. We tried to eat it as a salad. I think the other reviewer had the right idea pairing it with pulled pork.
