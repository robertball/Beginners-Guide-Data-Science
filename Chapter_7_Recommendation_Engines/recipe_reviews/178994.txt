I used a cheap cut of meat (beef stew meat) so I knew I had to simmer it a little longer than usual. For browning, I added a little butter in with the EVOO. I used a full small onion and I used baby bella mushrooms. After I'd added all the veggies and the liquids, I brought it up to a boil, covered it, and cooked it on low for a little over an hour. Before serving, I sprinkled more parsley over the top. We had this over hot buttered egg noodles with garlic lemon butter green beans on the side. This is a lot like a stroganoff without the sour cream. The kids didn't care for it but I thought it was very good. Using the stew meat didn't affect the flavor or compromise the dish at all. NOTE: I used Campbell's beef broth because that was all I had on hand.

I made Julia Child's recipe a few months ago which was excellent.  It took all afternoon.  I made this in an hour and it was really really good. I cooked it longer than the 30 minutes - maybe 45 minutes - because the sauce had not thickened in the 30 minutes called for.  I didn't serve it with orzo and instead served it with fettucini alfredo.

I have to say, I was impressed with this recipe. I was a bit sceptical after reading some of the reviews, but the dish really turned out well. This is basically a 30-minute beef stew, so you get a nice hearty meal without the slow-cooker. I followed the recipe exactly, using fat-free, low-sodium broth and portabella mushrooms. After reading some of the reviews saying that this recipe was bland and after tasting the sauce, I added a little salt and pepper to wake things up a bit. Other than that, I added some cornstarch to thicken the sauce to my liking and served over Orzo pasta. Don't let the bland reviews scare you away from this one, as it really doesn't need much to make it great.

Great recipe!  I made this with garlic mashed potatoes and green beans and crusty Italian bread.   I also used frozen sliced mushrooms since I didn't have any fresh and it was really good.

this was yummy! I used a whole onion instead of just two tablespoons, and added two chopped stalks of celery. Also used sliced big carrots instead of baby carrots, and served with boiled new potatoes.

I don't think this cut of meat can get tender enough to suit me within this cooking time.  That is my reason for 4 starts.  I also added some 7 pepper blend to spice it up to suit my husband's taste.  Originally, I thought the sauce was a tad bland.  It is a good recipe and a great starting point to play with different seasonings and flavors.  I served it over orzo pasta.  Thanks for the recipe and I would make this again, but with definite changes to the seasoning blend.

It took quite a long time to cook down, and still tasted a bit "eh." Overall not bad, but not amazing either.

My husband and I loved this.  I just added a little cornstarch to the sauce to thicken it a bit.  Make sure you don't overcook the orzo though, the thicker sauce  will make the orzo seem a little slimey!

I thought this recipe was very good.  I followed the recipe except I put the ingredients in the crock pot after cooking (at the point the recipe said to turn the heat to low).  I cooked in the crock pot for the afternoon (3 hours).  Family loved it ... definitely will add to my collection.

I had about 2 lbs of steak, so I doubled the recipe on everything, including the broth.  Probably shouldn't have done so because the dish is extremely watery... I think about half the recommended amount would have worked better.  Taste is just okay, I wouldn't make this again.

We had it over the orzo and I like that alot better than egg noodles.  I used del monte canned carrots too, that way we didn't have to wait for the carrots to be cooked enough for me.  I think it's a keeper.  My kids loved it too.

Very good. My wife and I both enjoyed this. I used Shiraz wine, a different brand of beef broth, and Herbes de Provence instead of the parsley and thyme, and the end result was very tasty over orzo. Would make this again.

This was a good and simple recipe.  I served mine over penne pasta but I can see this working great on its own for a dinner for two.  I made mine in a large skillet and it was really flavorful and the meat very tender.

I thought it was good but it needed more salt.  I also thought it wasn't as flavorful as I would have hoped so I added some things to pep it up a bit.  Might make it again but I don't think this will be a go to recipe for me.

The wife and family went nuts for it. Added some hot sauce and cayenne pepper  to taste just because we like things a little spicy.

Really wonderful flavor! I used herbs de provence and lots of minced garlic.  We really enjoyed the crimini mushrooms in the sauce.  The beef sirloin strips came out so tender.

Delicious. I used port wine instead of red wine and added paprika to counter the sweetness of the port. But nevertheless, the dish was absolutely divine.

Simple. Easy. Delicious. And made the entire house smell SO GOOD! We too had it on Penne... only because that is what we had in the house. I anticipate the leftovers will be delicious as well. I'm sure everyone at work tomorrow will be jealous. I served this with a tossed salad and garlic cheese toast. Oh, and the rest of the bottle of wine. :)

This recipe was flavorless.  After all the work and the wonderful smells it did create, the end result was disappointing.  My family was surprised that it lacked taste since it smelled aromatic.  Unsure I would make again.

This is a very tasty and easy recipe. I doubled it to make a little more sauce and served it with garlic mashed potatoes.  The kids and hubby all eat it all up!  Thanks for sharing!

I followed this recipe closely.  I skipped the mushrooms, didn't have, and used four raw carrots sliced.  I did have to add corn starch to thicken the sauce.  We thought this was very tasty and will make again.

The recipe was very tasty.  Even with covering the lid, I found the carrots weren't tender enough and would probably recommend cooking it a bit longer next time.

The key to this recipe is the type of meat you use.  I used regular "stew beef"  the ones that are already cut up...should have used something more tender such as rib eye or flap steak.  As for the sauce I added a few things of my own....it was kind of bland so i added about half a packet of liptons Onion Soup mix, a few dashes of Worcestershire, kosher salt and believe it or not about 2 tsp of brown sugar.  It gave the sauce a bit more flavor.  I love onions and mushrooms so I put lots of those.

The beef did cook up tender, however, I thought this was lacking in flavor.  I served it over couscous just because we are cutting back on carbs, and it worked.  It needed something that I cannot put my finger on.
