I made the crust from scratch and followed the rest of the recipe as. It was so delicious. Everyone loved it, even our 3 year old guest eating pie for her first time.

Great recipe.  I did find that I like making two smaller pies with this recipe instead of one big one.  Definitely a keeper!

I will add cornstarch or tapioca to the filling to make it firmer.  Otherwise a very good tasting pie.  I used the butter pie crust, which always turns fantastic.

I like a stiff pie filling so I added 7 tablespoons of flour instead of 6 I also cut the sugar to 1/2 cup.  I also added 1/4 tsp almond extract just enough to be a mysterious ingredient that keep some people wondering what is that last flavor?  Works for me.  I made it with fresh, hand picked, ripe Puget Sound Black Berries.  My wife and our son love it. Craig
