Absolutely delish! Followed recipe as listed, used graham cracker crumbs inside.....only difference is I used salted butter VS unsalted and I brushed tops of them with egg and sprinkled with cinnamon & sugar mixture VS using the Carmel drizzle topping....turned out absolutely amazing! Also I used homemade dough (used Butter Flakey Pie Crust recipe from this site) which I think made them even better!!

I used homemade caramel sauce since I didn't have any but they were excellent. I think it would be better to say how many cups of diced apples rather than number of Apple's since they can vary greatly in size.
