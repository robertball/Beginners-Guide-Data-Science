I have made this before, but just yesterday figured out how to make it perfect. I halved the recipe and and altered it as follows: (1) I used an entire packet of rapid rise yeast instead of 1 1/2 tsp [this means you have to reduce proof time by about a half], (2) I used 1/2 cup of honey instead of 1/4 cup [Mmm!], (3) I used one whole egg plus three yokes [this gives it a much more challah-like taste], (4) I added about a tablespoon of honey to the eggwash, and (5) I reduced baking time by about 6 or 7 minutes, making sure to cover the challah with foil after about the first 20 minutes, to prevent too much browning. This came out magnificently and I suggest these alterations to anyone who likes a slightly sweeter and eggier challah!

When I started making challah on Friday nights, I searched for over a year for a good recipe. I actually bought cookbooks with one challah recipe in hopes that it would be "the one". Then I found this recipe. It is without a doubt, the best challah I've ever made (and much better than most of the store-bought ones in the Boston area). It is especially wonderful with raisins, topped with cinnamon sugar. One caveat though: be careful about the baking time. Mine never takes more than 25 minutes in the oven.

We live in Israel and this receipe's taste is as authentic as the loaves we buy in the shop for Shabbat!!! Great taste and simple to do ( first time I have ever made bread). One loaf I flavored with onion and the other with herbs. Superb.

Very, very good bread.  I have made this twice, once with rapid rise yeast and one with traditional active dry yeast.  Active dry yeast works 100% better.  Make sure to let the yeast/warm water sit for ten minutes with a tsp of sugar before adding other ingredients.    Using bread flour also produced a better product than using all purpose flour.   Used one egg, three egg yokes for the dough per another reviewer's suggestion, and added a Tablespoon of honey to the egg bath at the end. Definitely take the suggestion of baking for 30 minutes only, and cover with foil after 20.

REALLY GREAT!!!
When i found that my local bakery was out of the round challot for Rosh Hashana, i made this recipe simply by searching for "honey challah" in a search engine. After years of fruitless attempts at making challah that were either too yeasty or just tasteless and hard, this is a REAL WINNER, and my kids think so too!!!  Thanks a bunch! ...i just would have liked it to come out fluffier..

I love making bread and often trying new recipes has given me a good point of reference. This bread was easy to make and turned out really nice, with abeautiful crunch and great flavor. I added a bit more honey than called for, for a great sweet bread. The dough was great to deal with and easy to shape.

My grandmother made Challah for Sabbath, so I was hoping to get the same type she made from this recipe.
The bread looked fantastic and was a perfect piture of Challah, but as soon as I tasted it, I knew it wasn't the same. I'm not sure how to fix it, but it sure needs more egg yolks and honey, it lacked the honey eggy flavor Bubbe's did!
Also, the dough was far too sticky with the 8 cups of flour, and found I had to add quite a bit more in order to work with it. I am thinking of using egg yolks only, more honey and cutting down on the water.
The good news is that it did make excellent french toast and croutons, so not a total loss!

I had never made challah before, but I think this is a really good recipe. Next time I think I'll add a pinch more salt, or maybe more honey--just to give it some added flavor. I also thought it was a good basic recipe to add herbs and spices to, I think I'll add dill next time to see what happens. I didn't know if I was supposed to separate the third egg for the egg wash, so I kept it whole; as a result, I ended up with a few bits of scrambled egg on the top! I think I'll just do the yolk next time? Any ideas?

I needed a pretty loaf of bread that didn't take a long time to make and this was it.  My family loved it and I got lots of compliments from friends who thought it looked beautiful.  I have never braided bread before so I didn't know what to expect but it was so easy.  Thanks for this recipe!

Definitly a keeper! After reading 7 pages of reviews, I used milk instead of water, 1 pack active dry yeast, 1 egg and 3 yolks, ( saved the egg whites for the wash), cut salt to 3/4 teaspoon, added 1 cup plumped raisins, and added 6 drops of yellow food coloring. I realize I made a few changes, but it was awesome! Made into 2 loaves. Thanks Joan!

This bread is spectacular.  It tastes wonderful and looks stunning.  I addad kosher salt to the top after the egg glaze and that turned out well.

It was amazing; I used 4 eggs instead of 3 and 1 cup of honey instead of 1/2. I also substituted 2 1/2 water with 1 milk+1 1/2 water.

This was my first time making challah and it came out just the way I remember it from my childhood in NY, where we purchased it from neighborhood German Jewish bakeries.  I made 4 changes to the recipe, which worked out beautifully: 1) I used 3/4 cup honey because I like a sweeter dough, 2) I let the dough rise three times because I live in Salt Lake City, which is a mile above sea level.  The first time was 1 1/2 hrs., the second 30 min., and the third time an hour.  I kneaded the dough for about 5 minutes after each rising.  3) I braided the loaves with 6 instead of 3 strands of dough for a gorgeous appearance, after studying YouTube videos.  4) The final change was to use 2 sets of egg wash - one after the final kneading after the dough was braided and set to rest for an hour, and the second was immediately before baking.  The 2 egg washes provided a beautiful lacquer that made the bread look irresistable!  My husband and I consumed half a loaf in a single sitting, agreeing that it was the best challah we've tasted since leaving NY in 1978.  Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe!

I made this wonderful bread for a potluck Christmas party. I followed the directions exactly, except that it only took about thirty minutes to bake. It turned out beautifully--gorgeous to look at and delicious. Everyone remarked on it, and it just disappeared. I served it with freshly made sweet butter. A wonderful recipe--makes stupendous french toast the next day, too.

As a Japanese recently moved to US, I know little about Jewish culture. But if this beautiful and delicious bread is their traditional food, I am so jealous.

This was my first time making and tasting challah and it is delicious! It reminds me of a rich brioche. I was able to make 4 large 6 braided loaves with this recipe. I took other reviewers' advice and added 2 extra egg yolks. I also used whole milk instead of water and butter instead of the vegetable oil. All 4 loaves took 25 mintues to bake. I rotated the pans halfway through baking for even browning. A really great tasting bread!

I don't make bread often so I was a little scared to make this but it turned out great and I can't wait for it to cool down! I'm going to eat it right now!
Although I don't know if anybody made this mistake but I put a little of the egg mixture on the bottom of the dough as well as the top, it was a bad idea... the bread ended up sticking to the pan! It did eventually get scraped off, but was annoying to do so don't make my mistake!

This was so fabulous! I made 2 loaves. It came out fluffy and so sweet. I forgot to add the eggs until I had already formed the dough so I added anyway and it still came out great! I took the advice of other reviewers and added 2 extra egg yolks and also mixed honey into the egg to brush on top of the loaves. It was so good it reminded me of my favorite Jewish bakery where there is a ridiculous line on Fridays to get challah. Anywho I was so excited to get this out the oven and try it that I burned my arm:( Yes I should add that I am extremely impatient! Thanks for the recipe!

Very good!  I omitted the poppy seeds and added plumped yellow raisins (see below).  I also brushed the bread with an egg wash (see below) prior to baking.

How to plump raisins:
Place raisins in a small saucepan, cover with water and bring to a boil. Remove the saucepan from the heat.  Cover & let the raisins stand for about 5 minutes. Drain & use the raisins as directed in the recipe. 

Egg Wash:
Stir egg yolk with 1 tsp. sugar and 1 tbsp. water.  Brush over loaf PRIOR to baking.

These little tricks will make the bread as beautiful as it is delicious.

Love this recipe! I made 6 loaves for a 50-person dorm and they were gone within five hours. I proof the yeast in the honey and water for 10 minutes before adding everything else. I use a stand mixer and knead with a dough hook for 10 minutes. Use the recipe as a guideline for flour amounts. I start with 8 cups as recommended, but it varies every time I make it with humidity, temperature, etc. I simply add more flour until the dough reaches a workable consistency -- it should pull away from and "clean" the inside of the bowl as the dough hook kneads it. I generally only have to bake for 25-30 minutes at most. The bread is incredibly moist, sweet and eggy, and folks are always impressed by the beautiful braid. Try rolling cinnamon, sugar and raisins into the dough as well. This makes the best French toast!

I halved the recipe and put the ingredients in a bread machine on the dough cycle. When the cycle finished, I simply made the braid and impressed the guests. Very easy.

I have made this recipe several times and it's always delicious. I always sprinkle a little cornmeal on the pan before baking.  Don't skip the egg wash before baking, it makes the loaves look and taste better.  Take note, this makes a lot of dough, enough for two large loaves. Depending on how fast your family gobbles it up, you can always bake one loaf and freeze the other.If freezing the dough, let it rise one time, punch it down, knead it, and shape your loaf before freezing. I've tried it both ways.  I have to admit I liked it better when the dough hadn't been frozen.  You can always share the extra loaf with a friend, or it makes great french toast a day or two after baking. If you want to make a beautiful braided challah there are a lot of "how to" videos online you can refer to. Takes a bit of practice but the results are impressive. I'll make it again and again - it's a family favorite. This was the first "from scratch" bread I ever made; mixed up the dough in my kitchenaid, and it wasn't hard at all - don't be afraid, try it!

I didn't read this all the way thru and didn't realize it makes two VERY large loaves.  As they are very GOOD loaves, I think it'll be ok.  The dough did climb my KitchenAid while kneading, so I had to finish it by hand.  Dough was easy to work with and baked up beautifully.  I checked this at 27 minutes and it was done perfectly.  It would have burnt at 40 minutes, but otherwise I followed the recipe.  Will make again.

We (embarrasingly) ate two loaves of this in one night! Beware: It's completely addicting.

Fantastic recipe! Of course I made a few changes. I added 3/4 cup of honey along with 3 eggs. I also let the bread rise three times. The first time and hour, the second time 1/2 hour, braid and brush with egg wash then rise a third time for one hour. This is a large recipe so I make 4 smaller loaves and freeze 3 of them after they are braided. Allow 5 hours to thaw and rise then bake. I also reduced the baking temperature to 350 and reduced the baking time to 15-18 minutes for the smaller breads. Thanks for this recipe. It's wonderful.

Great recipe!  After I had already mixed my dough, I read many reviews that suggested increasing the amount of honey; next time, I may opt to do that, but it really is great as is.  The loaves are absolutely HUGE!  I was too intimidated to try the 6 braid method, and instead chose to braid with 3 and it looked wonderful.  So glad I only baked for 30 minutes as 40 would have been too long.  I tented the bread with foil after 20 minutes so as not to have a really dark crust.  Thank you for posting this recipe!

FANTASTIC!!!! Sooo good! I doubled the recipe - and use a 6 lb bag of high glutten flour. I also sometimes use 1/1/2 cups of honey and sometimes use 1 1/2 cups of sugar instead of the honey...depending on what I have available. We like our challah sweet. I make the double batch the night before I want to bake the challah, I spray a garbage bag with PAM and put the dough in the bag. I pour about 2 tbsp. of oil into the bag and then place the bag into the fridge to rise overnight. In the morning - I don't have to wait for the dough to rise! It rises and is ready to be breaded and is a wonderful consistency to work with!!! I love this recipe and make it all the time! I braid the challah and let it rise for about 20 minutes, and bake it in a 350 degree oven for about 30-40 minutes, depending ton the size of the challah. i have also used some of this dough to make "Cinnamon Rolls I" from this website! Amazing recipe as well!!!!

This was my first attempt at making bread from scratch.  It was quite easy, and very tasty when complete.  I generously sprinkled cinnamon/sugar over the egg wash before baking--utterly spectacular!!!!!

I made this Challah for 800 people (that's right, 800!!) and it was a HIT.  It was loved by all.  I added 3 eggs instead of 2, 1 cup of honey instead of 1/2 (which makes the dough super sticky and harder to work with but well worth it in the end) and lots of golden raisins that I allowed to plump in hot water before adding to the dough.  I added a little honey to the egg wash and then sprinkled with poppy seeds.  (I used a bread machine to do all of the kneading and raising for me since I had so many loaves to do.) Thanks for the recipe!!

It's been about 25 years since I last baked homemade bread.  I chose this recipe because I wanted an eggy bread similar to an egg bagel.  I got 2 HUGE loaves of bread out of this recipe. I did read the review of FeedingFrenzy below, and followed her tips except I did  not half the recipe and I did not add extra honey. Next time, however, I will half this recipe and follow her tips because I would have liked this a tad sweeter.  Even as is, this bread is delicious! I would definitely make this bread again.  I did not have a bread machine or the mixmaster with the hook, I did it all by hand, and still it came out so good I could not ask for a better loaf of bread for my holiday table! I would recommend strongly the use of parchment paper to line your baking sheet rather than greasing one up. It will eliminate the bottom of the bread burning.  I gave it five stars because it yielded such generous loaves and it tasted really good.  I am storing it in the freezer wrapped in foil for the upcoming holiday.  It freezes well.  5 Stars.  Well done!

It may have been because I had just enough flour for 8 cups, and any remainder I had to add for stickyness, I used whole wheat (that's all I had). But it just tasted like really bad bread. It was nothing like challah, and the flavor was awful.

Recommendations- For those who commented it wasn't quite sweet enough, I agree.  Added an additional 1/4 C honey, baked it for 32-35 minutes.  Noticed the first bread I baked was a bit overdone at 40 minutes.  The second time baking it for less time and with a splash more of honey was what took the cake!!!

First of all, as a rule, I can NOT bake bread.  This recipe has cured me of that!  YUM! Easy, and beautiful.  I rolled my dough out, buttered it lightly, grated cinnamon over it, sprinkled it with light brown sugar, rolled it up, let it rise, and baked it.  I hope to make french toast from it tonight for dinner, if I can keep my family out of it long enough.  :)  THANKS!

Awesome recipe. It kills everytime! My whole family looks forward to when I cook this. My one tip though: bake at 350 degrees instead of 375. At 375 the bottom gets too hard to even bite! At 350 it's and pliable.

The recipe will need more flour and less baking time. About 25min at 375°F

This is a really great Challah recipe! The only thing is that the baking time too long. It usually only takes between 20 and 30 minutes (about 25 when the dough is divided into 3 loaves). You can tell when they are done when the braid starts to stretch in the middle and you can see white. Then it will be nice and moist!

This tasted amazing! My only complaint is that it came out waaaay too sticky, and I had to add a whole lot of flour, but it tasted great anyway! For the egg wash I use the yolk from the egg, add some water and sugar, beat it all together, and wallah! It comes out just like at the bakeries!

these were so yummy. i did make a couple of changes, though. i halved the recipe, but i still used about 1/3c honey. i also used an additional egg yolk. and i proofed the yeast in the warm water with a little sugar before mixing everything together. i didnt make loaves, i made them into little rolls instead (got 13 GIANT rolls with halved recipe). i brushed them with a little melted butter before letting them rise a second time, then brushed them again with an egg/honey wash before baking them. i didn't have any issues with them rising either time, and they turned out delicious and flaky. thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

I've made this twice now, the first time it came out crumbly and not light and fluffy like I prefer, though the taste was pretty good. This time around I added 1 whole tablespoon of dry yeast (I halved the recipe so as to only have one loaf) and used half a cup of honey. I added the honey to the warm water to let the yeast go nuts on it, and once I got a nice thick foam then I added the rest of the ingredients. This time I was also much more careful about my mixer overworking the dough, and my oven runs hot so I baked the loaf at 325 for maybe 25 minutes, then checked it, and had to put it back in for another ten. It turned out just as beautiful and fluffy as I like it to be, and I'll definitely be making this very often from now on.

My second attempt (first successful attempt) at ever making bread- this recipe was so easy, calls for easily accessible ingredients, and tastes delicious.  I turned down the heat halfway through baking, transfered to a lower shelf in the oven, and put foil over the top to keep it from browning too much.  Besides that, I can't wait to try this again with cinnamon, raisins or poppyseed!  One note: the dough rises a LOT, i got two HUGE loaves out of this recipe.  I'd suggest making three loaves with the dough, or two loaves and some smaller rolls.  Delicious.

Wow! This is the best Challah! I halved the recipe and added an extra egg to the dough per reviews and knowing I love the rich egg flavor of challah.  I also added about an extra 1/2 to 3/4 cup of flour because of the extra egg.  I made the dough in my bread machine and then braided it, let it rise for 1 hour, and baked according to directions.  Everyone loved it!  I've tried a lot of recipes for Challah and this is the best.  Thanks so much, it makes a beautiful, giant loaf that I can't wait to give as gifts (or eat!)

I made this for a school class on breads around the world.  It is SO good!  Try it sliced and toasted with honey.  My 7 year old helped, and though she didn't knead anywhere near 5 minutes, it still turned out fine!

Now THIS is traditional Challah! Delicious and so easy to make that even a 12 year old child can do it (my little one often makes it, and without my help). We make it every week for Shabbat. It's so good that our non-Jewish friends rave about it and several have standing orders.  And left-over Challah (if you are lucky enough to have any) makes for the most divine French toast!

This may be the best challah bread recipe I have tried to date.  The flavor was good and the texture perfect, especially for bread puddings and French toast which is one of the reasons I make it.  I only made half the recipe and used two whole eggs.  Four cups of flour makes a big enough loaf of bread for us.  Because Thanksgiving is coming, just for a chuckle, I thought I’d attempt to make a turkey shaped loaf of bread getting in the “Respect the Bird” spirit of AR.   Thank you for sharing not only a delicious recipe, but a great adult version of Playdough. :-)

I have prepared this recipe so many times, I am back to print a new one! It is very good just as written. I have halved it, doubled it , frozen the dough, frozen the baked loaf and it is always delicious! It does bake quicker in my oven too, usually about 30 minutes. Thank you for sharing!

I made 1/4 of the recipe, ending up with 8 buns. I used half a packet of quick rise yeast, doubled the honey, used 1 whole egg, & used 1.5 cups white bread flour + 1 cup all purpose flour. The texture of the buns was beautiful, but it was too dry. Next time I will definitely double the amount of oil. Maybe I will cut back on some water too, using only 1/2 cup for 1/4 of the recipe, since the dough was ridiculously sticky (hence the additional amount of flour used).

Every time I make this recipe it is a big hit.I follow the recipe exactly except that I use either all whole wheat or mostly whole wheat flour and I leave off the poppy-seeds. It also seems to bake MUCH faster then the recipe suggest that it will.  I usually take it out at 25 minutes and it's perfectly done.  I don't know if this is because I bake it on a pizza stone.   I like peoples ideas with adding honey to the glaze.  Maybe I'll try that next time.

I'm not a baker, but this recipe made me look like a pro.  I unashamedly admit that I nearly ate the whole loaf.  I was initially worried that the flour started clumping when adding to liquid, but it was fine.  I used my Kitchen Aid, but put it away prematurely - after initial rise, will knead one by hand and one with Kitchen Aid next time.  I baked my first loaf for 28 min and it was almost burnt; the second for just under 20 min.  The second loaf TRUMPED the first.  DO NOT BAKE FOR RECOMMENDED TIME!!

First time making Challah. Oh my GOODNESS! This bread was FANTASTIC! Even though I halved the recipe, it made a HUGE loaf...and we managed to eat half of it this evening! Wonderful! Will absolutely make again! I can't wait! 5 Stars! My husband is quite fond of it, and I wanted to surprise him by making it for him.  I found a video online to show how to braid a 6-strand Challah loaf. I also used the advice of one of the other reviewers, and halved the recipe, but used 1/2 cup of honey, 1 egg, and 3 egg yolks in the dough.

This bread is phenomenal. It was my first time ever making bread and I chose to try this recipe out. I was a little intimidated knowing I'd have to "braid" dough but it really wasn't hard at all. I added a little more honey (3/4 cup) than was called for and for my egg wash I added a little milk (1/2 tsp) and honey (1/2 tsp) to it. It gave it this nice golden brown glow. I made one with golden raisins and one without and they both tasted great. My whole family loved it!

This bread was AMAZING! I cut down the servings from 30 to 20 and kept the eggs the same. I put all the ingredients in my bread machine and turned on the dough cycle. When that was done I punched it down, kneaded it for a while, and then braided it into one large loaf. I only baked it for 25 mins, the full 40 would have definitely burnt it.  It was picture perfect! I cannot wait to make french toast in the morning!

I followed as directed but my bread was very dense and dry. I don't know what I did wrong. First time making it and probably the last. After all that hard work, I was disappointed. Will not complain next time I splurge $6 for a 2lb challah loaf from the local jewish bakery!

I used 1 egg plus 2 egg yolks in the dough, and I also took the advice of adding some honey in with the egg wash. Delicious!! I let it rise for a bit too long and they were probably twice the size they should've been, but the baking instructions were perfect. Very tasty! :)

Wonderful recipe and wonderful Bread!  I have only failed at all the bread/dough recipes I've had prior to this one!  This dough was silky and smooth, rose well and was easy to prepare and knead.    I used my kitchenaid to mix the dough then turned it out and kneaded by hand.  I let it rise in the over with a pan of just boiled water on the bottom rack, easily doubled in size.  The baking time was exactly right and the loaves were golden brown and lovely!  The only change I made to to recipe was to use half honey and half brown sugar (but only because I ran out of honey).  I will definitely be making this again!

After reading some of the other reviews and practicing a couple of times I made this recipe just the way I like it. I really like a sweet and fluffy challah, so I also halved the recipe and used a whole packet of rapid rise yeast. Instead of 4 cups of all-purpose flour I use 3 and 1 cup of self-rising flour. I also use 1/2 cup of honey. I allow the dough to rise 1.5 hrs the first rise and 1 hours the second, but I find that it doesnt actually look a whole lot bigger, so dont be scared if this happens. Make sure to cover the challah half way through baking as the top tends to burn.

WOW!  So easy!  So delicious!  Only adjustment was the baking time (30 minutes, not 40).  Consider baking on paper - easier to transport off pan.  Good crust, soft center.  PERFECT!

this is so, so delicious! that said, i did (groan) modify it a bit. ;-)
to begin, i halved the recipe (not to worry, a half-recipe loaf could feed an army), and then, having re-calculated the proportions, switched out just over half the amount of water for 2% milk, used 1.5x the amount of honey called for, and used one full egg and two egg yolks. i also used white bread flour instead of all-purpose, and for me, it's perfect! actually, for any torontonians out there, it reminds me of yitz's (which is the highest compliment possible in the world of challah!). to really, really get that perfect sweet, richness, the dough could stand to have one or two egg yolks more still, and a bit more honey, but as it is now, it's pretty darn good. i will definitely make this again!

I've made this twice now.  Came out dry the first time.  This may have been my error since this time it came out perfect!  Just as good as my favorite bakery and better than the local grocery store.  Make sure to knead it as long as you can possibly handle.  The head baker at the bakery said it needs 45 minutes if doing it by hand.  I didn't quite do that long but I did it about 30 minutes.  Will be making tghis every Friday night!

Excellent recipe!  Did follow the advice of others and added 1/2 cup more honey and 2 extra egg yolks.  Cooking time was only 30 min. and I had to cover with foil to prevent to dark a crust.  We used the second loaf as french toast the next morning and it was DIVINE!  Thanks!

Great challah bread recipe.  I made dinner rolls out of the dough by making small "snakes" and tying them in knots.  I placed them on a greased cookie sheet, brushed with beaten egg, and sprinkled with poppy seeds.  They came out really pretty, and were more gourmet than regular dinner rolls.

It was good not great.  For me it seems like it is missing something (my memory of good challa was at my grandma's house), I am not sure what!  Cook time was only 20 minutes. When I make it again I think I will add a bit more honey and an extra egg.  But, it is very easy to make.  Me and my twin 3 year olds were able to make it with no problems....I made it again with an extra egg in the dough and it was wonderful....

I made this recipe exactly as directed. It was my first time making challah and I was making it for Rosh Hashanah at my hubby's cousin's place. I'm not Jewish and was not sure if it would be authentic but everyone there thought it was perfect! Someone had brought a store-made challah but no one ate it - mine was ripped to shreds and devoured very quickly. I was praised up and down for this challah and told that it had a very authentic taste and texture. Definitely recommend this recipe - especially for first-timers and gentiles wanting to impress the in-laws. :)

I loved this bread! It made a couple loves, and I tried two different braids on them, and they both worked really well.

Excellent and easy to make!  When I added the yeast to the water I also added the honey and let the mixture sit for about 20 minutes.  The yeast was activated and ready to go.

I really like this Challah recipe. I added a little OJ instead of warm water to give the bread some extra flavor. It turned out amazing!

This bread is awesome. I think it will be our new family staple. Nice rich flavor. i followed some other reviewers and used milk instead of water, 2 1/4 t. yeast or one pack, 3 whole eggs in the dough one for wash and 4 T. butter instead of vegetable oil. It is easy to make and came out great the first time. It got scarfed down by anyone and everyone. It makes 2 huge loaves which is a plus in my book. Also, it kept well in the fridge for at least one week. I am going to try making cinnamon braids next time. It makes incredible french toast and bread crumbs too. Like I said I think it will be my new go to all purpose bread for the family. MMMMMMMMM!!!!!

I made two loaves, 1 with raisins and 1 plain with sea salt on the top.  My family RAVED about this bread!!!  We all had sandwiches on it for dinner and devoured the whole loaf in one sitting.  The raisin challah got a little extra treatment as a dessert with amaretto butter sauce drizzled on each slice.  I will definitely be making this again!

Holy cow.  A while back, I decided I was going to learn how to bake bread, and this was the first recipe I used.  I had four roommates and a number of friends over at any given time, so every time I made this, it was gone well before anybody went home or to bed.  I was thrilled at how easy it was to make!
One time, I was out of honey, so I tried molasses instead.  It gave it a unique, but no less delicious, flavor.

Very delicious!  This was so soft.  Cover the bread after baking it for 15 minutes as it was quite dark after 20 minutes.  Would definitely make again and maybe into bread for sandwiches.  If so, cut down the honey.

I followed the first review that so many found helpful and my bread was very flavorful- but very dense and the texture was all wrong. I'm sure the original is much better and I will be trying that next time

Fantastic! I have been making bread for years and was looking for some different ideas. I grew the yeast in warm milk and honey before adding it to the mix. I also put foil over for the last 20 minutes but followed the rest of the recipe. Everyone loved it.

This recipe make A TON of bread! It's great, I halved the recipe, and may quarter it next time. Also, it only needed to bake for about 35 minutes, so keep an eye on it! Another tip, grease the pan really well, mine stuck some.

my family loved this bread and i enjoyed making it.  it definitely did not need 40 minutes in the oven though.  mine was done at 30 and the loaf that was on the top was a little overdone.

So good! I used a mix of all purpose flour, oat flour, whole wheat flour and unbleached bread flour. Used canola oil and almond oil and topped with flax seed. Only needed about 20 minutes in the oven. I also did a 6 strand braid. Fantastic bread!!!

This was great! I was afraid I had bungled it, but I ended up with a big, beautiful loaf that tasted just like the challah I remember from my youth. I like it sweeter than this, so next time I'll be adding extra honey, but if you don't have a sweet tooth, there's no need to change the recipe.

Pretty good! I had to scale down the recipe to 1/4 because my mini Zo bread machine only takes up to 1lb loaves.  For making it in the bread machine, All i did was add the ingredients(do not wet the yeast) and set the machine on "Dough".  Let it rise once in the machine, then braid & let it rise again OUT of the machine for 1 hour. Baked in the oven for 20mins.  I've made so many changes to the recipe it made my head hurt lol! I would recommend more eggs(or egg yokes), and much more honey(i added 1/4cp of honey to mine). I also washed the dough twice, once w/ butter & again before baking w/ 1 egg & honey.

DELICIOUS! My kids are asking me to switch from my normal everyday bread recipe to this one. The only thing that I found that needed to be changed was the baking time. I will reduce it by 5 minutes next time. My loaves were almost black on the bottom.

A good, standard challah. For a richer taste, I used two additional egg yolks, and a bit of extra honey doesn't hurt.  I tried another variant for this week's shabbat, and added 1/4 cup of half & half, which produced an excellent texture. (A kosher note--only include the dairy if you're house doesn't serve meat on shabbat!)

It was wonderful. 25 minutes of cook time was plenty, not 40. I halved the recipe (of the 3 eggs, only 2 are used in baking and 1 in decorating, so just use 1 egg for baking when you halve it), and the one loaf was HUGE. I made it last night, and it's still moist and delicious. I don't really know what challah should take like, and I wouldn't mind an eggier bread (1 egg does't make too eggy a bread, as you might expect), but, really, it is light and fluffly and flavorful. If this were eBay, I would rate this "A+++ will do business with again"

This was the first loaf of bread I ever made, and I'm going to have to make more because it's so delicious! I only made one loaf. It came out with a beautiful golden brown crust, the slightest hint of sweetness from the honey, and a nice soft interior. I think I added about an extra 1 1/2 cups of flour but it was fun to knead it and braid the dough. Thank you for a great recipe!

This bread came out wonderfully! I mixed mine in my mixer with the dough hook on speed 2 and had to add 2 more cups of flour, but it came out perfectly! It's a lot of bread, so maybe next time I will half it

I decided to make challah bread after my husband and I picked up a loaf of it at the bakery.  It was the best bread we have ever tasted!  I chose this recipe after reading the reviews and went with it.  I added an extra egg to the mix and used a 1/2 cup honey, which resulted in needing to add about 10 cups of flour instead of 8.  I mixed everything by hand because I was worried about overworking the dough.  I watched a video on youtube on how to braid the loaves after the dough had risen.  I used one egg white mixed with a tablespoon of honey as an egg wash. I baked one loaf on a cookie sheet lined with parchment and the other on a baking stone.  The loaf on the baking stone got dark right away so I had to put foil on top of it to keep it from burning.   The baking stone loaf only took 25 minutes while the cookie sheet loaf needed 30.  The bread itself is fantastic, a little bit dense but soft and lightly sweet.  It is so delicious. The recipe is easy even with a few slight modifications.  My husband and guests raved about how tasty it was.  I can't wait to make this again!

This bread turned out absolutely divine, however, it's because I followed Feeding Frenzy's review (search by most helpful). I used 1/4 c. honey and 1/4 c. corn syrup b/c I ran out of honey. I added flour until it was the "right" consistency.. about 5.5 cups. Also, I baked mine at 350 (my oven's a little hot) for 40-45 min. The extra egg yolks really made the difference.. dense and slightly sweet. I will definitely make this again and again. Thanks!

Really good taste and texture. It didn't look very braided after it rose, though. Next time I'm going to roll the dough into shorter, thicker "snakes" to braid.

EDIT: A good way to get beautiful, tall loaves is to do a 6-strand braid. There are some great videos on youtube to show you how.

Also, if you're halving the recipe to make one loaf, 40 minutes is far too long. Our single loaf was perfect after 25 minutes.

Ive never made bred without my Grandma before, however decided to make this recipe one day. It turned out fantastic! I used molasses instead of honey because i ran out, but it worked out just fine.

Perfect bread! Came out excellent, will be making this again soon. I braided and used the egg wash, the oven time was a little shorter then 40 mins--more like 30 for me.

This challah is very good.  Much better than another egg bread recipe I tried from this site.  I am trying all challah recipes to recreate one that a coworker used to make that was eggier and sweeter.  But this will be a great substituion till I get my hands on her recipe.

I have been using recipes from this site for a long time and this is the first time I have felt compelled to write a review. My mom-in-law said this bread was exactly like the ones she used to buy at Jewish bakeries in Miami Beach. A few modifications though: add an extra egg. It will give it the taste and color of authentic challah. Also, I cooked at 350 degrees so it wouldn't brown so fast on the bottom and for under 30 minutes only. Finally, for the eggwash, I used just a yolk mixed with a little water. This bread is amazing!

pretty good, but i made some alterations so that it was really good. i half the recipe, because it makes A LOT of challah if made as written. also, i use a lot more eggs (4 i htink) and i only use yolks. and i use melted butter or margarine instead of the oil, for the fat. i think it adds more flavor, and it raises the temperature to help activate the yeast.

Very good, and easy to make, EXCEPT there is something seriously wrong with the amount of flour in the recipe.  I had to add so much more to make the dough into solid.  And I also only baked it for 30 min, which was just right.

This was delicious bread.  I made the loaves last night and froze them for next week's Rosh Hashanah meals.  This isn't as eggy as I would have liked (I wanted to reproduce the challah from Zomick's bakery in NY and this really wasn't it).  I baked the loaves one at a time on a pizza stone covered with greased tin foil.  Every 10 minutes or so I threw 5-6 ice cubes into the bottom of the oven to keep it steamy and get a crispy crust.  Took about 40 minutes to bake.  
Next time I'll add chocolate chips to the batter and top with cinnamon-sugar. Thanks for a great basic recipe.

Ugh!  I attempted to make this recipe into a round challah for Rosh Hashanah and I am glad I decided to do this a day early so I can still go buy one!  I couldn't get the dough to be the right consistency and it didn't rise.... it just spread out and came out bland and dry.

I make it all the time! A perfect replacement for the $6 challah bread I used to buy from WholeFoods. My daughter begs me to use it for French toast. Also  it is very easy to add stuff like raisins, garlic, rosemary, chippers....and make smaller loaves. Just make sure to decrease the temperature and timing when they are smaller.

Luv this recipe..was easy to assemble and taste delicious, still I had to add a little anise and some golden raisins, not to mention a little egg wash, just to give it that beautiful shiny crust. just perfection!  Some fresh churned  butter and I was in heaven...

Incredibly easy, and a nice light flavor that makes everyone happy.  I must make smaller loaves, though, bc I ended up with 3:  1 regular loaf, a round braid, and a huge braid.  I could've divided this into 4 pieces and gotten regular sized loaves out of each piece.  We had the regular loaf tonight for sandwiches and it worked perfectly.  This bread rises extremely well and has a nice flavor, mild enough for sandwiches yet good enough to eat by itself.  thanks for the recipe!

I don't usually write reviews but I had to write a review for this bread. It was so amazing and so easy to make! It took several attempts to get the dough braided just right but it turned out pretty! The kitchen smelled wonderful as the bread was baking. My husband and I both snacked on the bread and just couldn't get enough of it! This recipe is a keeper!

I just feel in love with this recipe. Even after halving the recipe, I still had enough dough to make 2 footlong loaves. Don't pull your dough strings tight when you braid the dough. A tight braid will result in a cracked brad later on. I learned first hand :(, but still perfectly edible. I also didn't have problems with my bread bottom burning.

I just made this and it is phenomenal!  Mine was out of the oven 7  minutes earlier though, so my only suggestion is to watch it towards the end, and when it's nice and dark gold, take it out.  My baking sheets are apparently no longer non-stick, so next time i will be using some parchment too.  Great recipe!  Won't be buying bread from the store half as much now!!!!

Yum!
This bread was delicious, like eating a fluffy pillow made of bread.
I followed the recipe proportions exactly. I made the following adjustments:
-Water temperature was about 95 degrees F.
-Used bread flour instead of all purpose flour.
-Added salt during the flour mixing portion of the recipe, just to ensure it wouldn't counteract the yeast too quickly.
-Used regular eggs for the dough, but for the egg wash on top of the bread, I used yoke only plus a spoonful of water (no egg whites).
-Baked on parchment paper on top of preheated baking stones. I put a little vegetable oil on the parchment paper to ensure the dough would not stick. 
-At 375 degrees, it only took 22 minutes to bake properly. Allowed bread to cool for an hour before I sliced it.

This made two very large loaves. I had to preheat two baking stones in the oven, otherwise there would not have been enough space.

I watched a couple of videos on YouTube to see how people braided the loaves and decided to do a 3-strand braid.  Perfect!

incredibly good! tip: 
activate the yeast in the warm water with 1 tsp of sugar while you blend with wire attachment for kitchen aid the eggs, honey, oil and salt. then blend the yeast and water (and sugar) mix in. switch to dough hook and add 1 c of flour at a time. I got to the perfect consistency at 5 and 1/2 c of flour and the loaves were better than any homemade bread I've ever had.

This was my first time making bread EVER, and it turned out perfect! =D  It even looks like it was made in a bakery.  I'd recommend it to anyone.  It is a little flavorless (b/c its bread not cake), so if you want you can add salt, sugar, raisins, etc.

When I was making the bread I thought it odd that there were only 3 eggs in the recipe when I've seen others call for 5-7 eggs, but I brushed off my concerne because of all the positive reviews.  I wish I had listened to my instincts.  Although my challah came out looking beautiful, once I let it rest and sliced into it I knew right away it wasn't quite right.  The bread was far too dry, and dense even though I used less flour than the recipe called for.  I also couldn't taste sweetness/egg in the bread at all.  Not a total loss because I will use it for a bread pudding.

Wow. Basically "no fail"... I bought local grocery challah & didn't deem any of it worthy of the huge dinner I needed to prepare.  So on a wing & a prayer, I whipped up 6 batches back to back of this recipe.  I think I might've goofed sometimes, and the church ovens vary in temp consistency. Of the 12 loaves, two were smooth despite braiding, some rose more than others, some got a bit dark on the bottom.  But I didn't get a single complaint.  Very pleased the loaves "reunited as one" beneath the braid bumps.  (vs. breaking apart when sliced)  Baked on Thursday, cooled then chilled in foil & plastic wrap, warmed in foil on Saturday -- came out like fresh baked.  Perfect slightly sweet compliment to kugel by Ann, roasted vegetables by Saundra, and an offsite brisket.

This recipe is easy and perfect as is.  The only problem (which is kind of a big one...) is that after only 25 minutes in the oven at 375, the bottom of the loaves were burnt.  The rest of the loaf is prefect though, so oh well! Definitely make it, just keep an eye on the oven.

I have never made bread from scratch before, so I was preparing for a failure of a challah.  I followed this recipe to the T and it came out amazing! I ended up with two beautiful and delicious round challahs – on for Rosh Hashanah, the other for the freezer.

I would highly recommend this recipe for beginners and experts alike.  I was astounded when my final product looked like a challah from the inside and outside and tasted like a challah.  It was perfectly sweet in a subtle way and airy as a challah should be.

This is the best Challah recipe I have come across! I TRIPLE the honey as my family has a sweet tooth AND it makes the bread super-delicious! Additionally, I always make two loaves from this one recipe. I braid each loaf seperately and cook each individually. I have found that cooking each smaller loaf seperately AND AT A LOWER TEMP (335 for 30 minutes) makes the bread perfect!

I am just beginning to venture into the art of bread-making and this was my first try at challah bread. It came out beautifully and tastes just as good as any bakery bought challah I've had. I added just a tablespoon of sugar to give it some more flavor and I'm delighted with the results, though my father feels that the recipe is a bit bland. I will definitely make this again, though I think the recipe can be tweaked here and there for some sensational results.

I used molasses instead of honey for this. It wasn't very sweet or eggy, but I did add extra flour, so that might've been the cause. My result tasted like a regular white bread, with a crunchy crust and soft interior. I'm gonna use it for my sandwiches. Though I expected something more dessert like, this is pretty good already.

This recipe was simple and delicious!  Will try with raisins and a sweet spread next time.  Made for excellent french toast the next day, as well.  There is a great video on youtube  on how to make a 6 strand braided loaf.

I will start off by saying I am not an expert bread baker by any stretch of the imagination. I made this bread last night and I was a little disappointed. It had a strange flavor to me ( maybe it's the honey? an ingredient I don't really love) and was very dense. This is not light and fluffy at all but heavy and a little on the dry side ( I only let mine go for 23 minutes and they were still dry). I used this for french toast so it wasn't a total loss. However after spending all of that time on something I am not 100% thrilled with, I would choose a different recipe in the future. Thanks!!

I'll give this a 4 star only because the bread itself was pretty good.  I halved the recipe, the dough was extremely sticky, I probably added in an extra 1/2+cup of flour, still a bit sticky but was afraid to put in more.  My bread didn't come out braided.  As it was doing the 2nd rise, it pretty much melded back together and I basically ended up with what looked like a loaf of french bread.  I might try again.

Just a note. I have been baking Challah Bread for years, however, I always make the dough in my bread machine. I take it out, braid it, let it rise for 30 minutes and then bake it. So yummy! I will have to try this recipe as it is slightly different than mine.

Is there anything better then fresh hot bread?  This recipe was simple and looked and tasted great!  My first successful attempt at making homemade bread, and I have made it a few times since.  I followed the recipe exactly.

For those of you who use your Kitchen Aids for kneading your bread: you will NOT be able to use it for kneading for this recipe unless you halve it (only getting one loaf). If you don't halve it, you can use it to mix all the ingredients together with your paddle attachment, but the dough will climb up and over your dough hook so you'll need to knead it by hand, adding flour as needed. With that said, this is a FANTASTIC and easy recipe. I was a little intimidated at first by the braiding part, but it was easy and both loaves (one with sesame seeds, one without) turned out beautifully and tasted delicious. Try this, you'll love it. Happy baking! :)

When I was a kid, baking Challah was part of our Friday ritual.  It's been years since I've made it, and I've long since lost the recipe.  This came out perfectly and will be my go-to Challah recipe from now on.  The only changes I made were to use white spelt flour (can't eat wheat) and melted Smart Balance Light in place of the oil to bring the calories down a bit.  Otherwise, I made it precisely as directed.  It baked up perfectly soft and golden, and my husband and I both loved it.  Thank you so much for the wonderful recipe!

This is a great, simple recipe. I love to bake bread and yet for some reason, I always assumed that challah would be over my head. Silly girl. It was so easy and it produced wonderful results. I made it once as a large, circular loaf (after halfing the recipe), and a second time as smaller, braid loaves. I liked it better as individual portions; I was able to bake the rolls and then freeze them - taking them out as needed. This bread makes delicious sandwiches and wonderful toast. I highly recommend this recipe.

This recipe is easy and very tasty.  Rather than putting foil over the bread as it bakes, I turned the temperature down to 350 degrees (or even less, if you've a hot oven). Haven't burnt a bread yet.

This was a great Challah! Although it made 2 huge loafs.   Next time I will cut the recipe in half so we don't end up wasting any.

I followed this recipe with no additions or deletions and it was really good.  I wasn't so sure it would turn out that way, though.  Eight cups of flour was not enough for me - I must've added two additional cups to the dough to get it to the right consistency.  It also took a long time to rise - 2 1/2 hours instead of 1 1/2.

This was good.  Not our favorite (I always make challah with 1/3 white, 1/3 wheat and 1/3 barley flours, which I did here, but otherwise followed recipe.) We really enjoyed it, just not a fav.  (We have 2 other recipes that are debating their superiority over each other...)

I have made challah before and I had success with the previous recipe and goodness I wish I had stuck with that one! This makes for a delicious bread but it calls for the preparer to let it rise AFTER you braid it. When I did that (I admit I was perplexed at the instruction) the challah rose and no longer looked like it was braided. I am disappointed that this had to happen. Next time I know to stick to my other cookbook.

This bread is very good, but I did make a few amendments.  First I put 1 tbsp of sugar in the warm water with the yeast and let the yeast bloom for 10 minutes.  I added an extra egg and sprinkled with sesame seeds before baking.  I do find that it doesn't come out as light textured as I would like, so next time I will add a touch more yeast.  Overall, it's a very good bread.

I have made many challahs before this one and none of them came out the way i wanted. I highly recommend basting the challah with a honey and egg mixture. and next time i make the challah I am going to add more honey for flavor. It is delicious! very light and fluffy. The recipe makes a lot of dough!! ENJOY!

My sister and I both love this recipe.  Up the honey if you want a sweeter bread.  I like to make 6 strand braids for my loaves which we sometimes take to our home fellowship as part of the communion.  My sister also made a braided wreath for Rosh Hashana.  Simple and beautiful.  Makes everyone think that you're an expert baker!

Yum. I used 2 eggs in the dough for one loaf. My husband and son devoured the bread. Wish I had added some raisins. My loaf baked for about 25 mins.

I halved this recipe, so I used only one egg, one egg yolk and used the remaining white for the eggwash. I also used sesame seeds instead of poppy. I didn't let it rise as much as called for, because I was in a hurry, but it still turned out great. Lightly sweet and perfect texture! Easy enough for this little goyeh!

I followed this recipe exactly, but when I rolled out the three braids for one loaf, I rolled them in cinnamon and sugar.  It came out great!  I usually kill bread, but this recipe was so easy and good even I managed to make 2 delicious loaves.

This was my first attempt with this complicated bread and it came out great! Everyone loved it and it has the right hint of honey and it's not dry at all. I even did the 6 strand braid- if you've never done it, go to YouTube and find a video of how it's done. BEAUTIFUL!

I love you, Joan Callaway!!  This is the first bread that I have ever made by hand that has turned out well.  Spending about an hour adding flour to the initial dough and kneading it is all worth it because the finished product is gorgeous, light, and airy.  I  substituted 1/2 corn syrup for the honey when I ran out and it didn't hurt anything.  I also used bread flour instead of all-purpose.  The recipe makes a lot, but think of the lifelong friends you'll make when you give some of it away!  :)

Although I didn't follow instructions to a "t", this came out wonderfully!  The recipe calls for three eggs in the ingrediants list, so i decided to put two egg yolks and two full egss...if I had read the instructions right the first time I would have noticed that the third egg was for the egg wash...not to be incorporated in the dough. Oops! Despite the mistake, the bread came out wonderful...a little more flour than called for (probably due to my extra egg) but still very, very good.  The whole house smelled amazing while baking.  I also brushed on some melted butter onto the loaves right out of the oven...yum-o!  This one is a keeper!

Ok… so I tried this recipe twice. The first time I followed it exactly and I came out with two huge, fluffy, bread loaves that I burned on the bottom (I think it was my dark non stick cookie sheet). It tasted good, but it wasn't the eggy, dense challah I love. So... 
The second time I took the advice of some of the other readers and halved the recipe, doubled the honey, and added one whole egg and three egg yolks. This turned out much better (and I used a different cookie sheet). This time it was still fluffy inside but sweeter. This is a winner for me.

This is a beautiful bread.  It has a great taste, texture and crust.  It takes a long time from start to finish, but the actual time working with it is not that long.  I never made a braided bread before and was pleased that it's not that hard to do.  I halved the recipe but still got an enormous loaf.  This is a winner.
July, 2019--This won third  place in the Miscellaneous Yeast Bread category in the Salem VA fair.  I though it deserved first!  :-)

This was my first attempt at challah, and it got great reviews from the whole family.  Maybe my oven is unique, but it only took about 15 minutes to bake.  At 25 minutes my first loaf burnt, so be careful with your bake times.

This was excellent! I halved the recipe to make one loaf, it was huge! I used 1 packet of instant yeast.  I will definitely make this again, but add another egg and some  more honey.

This bread looked very pretty when it was done. i followed the recipie except i  halved it and used 1 cup milk instead of water. I didn't add much additional flour over the amount called for and the dough was very easy to work with. I must say, it doesn't taste as good as it looks. This is only my second time making bread, but my expectations for this was high. My parents loved it because they like the not sweet, not salty types of bread. But i thought it could use more honey and egg flavor...it was just lacking something since it tasted like ordinary white bread to me. Another change, i baked it in a loaf pan so it did take 40 minutes. I covered it after 20 minutes to prevent burning. Also, this bread tasted a lot more moist and much yummier the second day. Overall, it's a great basic recipie.

This is a wonderful recipe!  Amazingly light and fluffy bread with a mild honey taste!  I've forwarded it to at least two friends who had never had success with Challah and this truly restored their confidence!   Possible additions: 2 extra egg yolks and maybe 1/2 cup more honey if you like a yellower, sweeter bread -- but this one is fantastic as is! (I grew up Jewish and have had authentic Challah!)

Two changes would make this a four or five: needs substantially more flour to prevent sticking than is stated and should be cooked for ten fewer minutes. Otherwise, it's a good, albeit basic, recipe for challah. As a disclaimer, I have never had "authentic" challah.

My official bread recipe now!  I'm like others - a complete disaster any time I try making bread. But no longer!  This one turned out nice and fluffy, and a great flavor.  Better than the bakery bread!  I was absolutely amazed with myself.  You have restored my hope in making home made bread.  Thank you so much!

This was soo delicious!  Very soft and sweet (I added a little extra honey, but probably didn't need to!)  I put poppy seeds on one 'braid' and cinnamon/sugar on the other.  I think we liked just the plain poppy seeds best.  Next time I might put some water in the bottom of the oven for steam and a crunchier crust.  Also, I probably should make my dough more stiff (add more flour) so it doesn't 'spread' so much and so that the 'braids' will be more defined when done.  Oh, and I just brushed with egg white, not the whole egg mixture.  It seems that this dough could easily be used for sweet dinner rolls, buns, a variety of different sweet breads for different occasions....  Thanks so much for the great recipe!!

My friend and I made this challah (in a college kitchen!) and it was absolutely amazing!  We thought it was wonderful, and I'll definitely be making it again.

Fantastic challah recipe!   Usually I use a bread machine recipe, but this year, I wanted to do it all by hand.  I made one loaf with raisins, which I added in during the second knead, and the first one I left plain, but sprinkled with sesame seeds rather than the poppy seeds. The bread turned out soft and very tasty.  I did only need to bake them for 25 minutes, so keep an eye on them depending on how hot your oven gets.  They made for a wonderful addition to our Rosh Hashanah dinner.

I have never made bread from scratch before and this is so easy!  I did find it to be a little dry though.  Next time I will add more honey and maybe some raisins to moisten it a bit.  Good flavor and beautiful presentation.

I was disappointed. I followed the directions, and also some good ones in the reviews. Although certainly edible it did not have the fluffy, eggy taste and texture that I look for in a challah. I cooked less time than suggested, but still it came out hard on the outside, and stiff on the inside. I am still in search of the perfect challah recipe, and this isn't it.

Sooooo good, and always a crowd pleaser.  We follow "Feeding Frenzy"s advice and do 1 egg plus 3 yolks, half cup of honey,  and reducing the cooking time and this is an absolutely wonderful challah... we make this once a week now,  saving one loaf for ourselves and giving the other to friends and neighbors.

Challah bread is always good, but this was amazing! It sounded so simple so I didn't expect much, but it was so tasty. However, this recipe is rather large, so cut it in half if you're planning to use it just for family. I gave away most of it.

I made some changes according to the comments I read.  I used 1 egg+3 yolks and saved the whites for the wash + some honey.  I used coconut oil instead of veg oil.  I put in a little more honey.  I subbed 2C whole milk for the water, only using 1/2C to bloom the yeast.  I used 2 packs of instant yeast.  As this was not for Shabbat, I did not separate the loaves, I baked it all in a 5QT cast iron dutch oven.  It took about 40 min. but I DID put the lid to the DO on after about 25 or 30 minutes.

Nevertheless, this is a great recipe to start.  I have the original AND the changes all stashed away so I can make this again.  It was absolutely heavenly bread and even more heavenly toast!  Thank you so much for this recipe!!

I also made the following alterations as per user Feeding Frenzy. I halved the recipe, used 1 cup milk and 1/4 cup water, 1/2 cup of honey, 2 tablespoons of butter, 3/4 teaspoon of kosher salt. I used one whole egg and 3 yolks. I added a tablespoon of honey to the egg wash, added poppy seeds after the second wash, baked at 350 to what ultimately came to about 20+ minutes turning once after 10. I have a Waring Pro countertop oven that seems quite efficient. I didn't have time for the foil tent although I wish I caught it earlier as the crust came out rather dark. No doubt due to the honey egg wash. I washed twice by the way. But the inside is amazing. It only looks dark but the flavor is absolutely amazing! I am imagining that next time I'll skip the honey in the wash as I think it likely does little to affect the flavor overall. The inside is so sweet and eggy. Oh, I also added 4 drops of yellow food coloring. (we eat with your eyes sooo...)  I woulda gave it a 5-star but for the dark egg wash. This will no doubt be my one and only Challah recipe. HOLLLAHH! Sorry if that's a bit cheesy... OOOOHHH! Cheesy Challah? Happy Easter!!

Amazing!! I use this recipe time and time again and it has never failed me. The only thing is that instead of baking it for 40 minutes, my huge loafs only need 15 minutes in the oven until they are a perfect golden brown.  Maybe my oven is different, but I would suggest keeping an eye on the loafs while their cooking, as you don't want to ruin hours of work!!

I'm making it for the second time right now, and one tip is to measure the oil in a quarter cup (4 tablesppoons=1/4 cup) and then measure the honey. And not only did I glaze it with egg was before baking, but before the second rise I heated some honey up in the microwave until thin, and brushed that on top of the bread. And right before baking, I brushed on the egg wash with a little bit of the same honey/water mixture on the breads. Also, use one whole egg and two or three egg yolks in the dough to make it more rich. And watch the baking time, because sometimes it doesn't need more than 25 minutes. Cover with aluminum foil if it's getting too brown too fast, or, if you have made it before and know it's going to get too brown, save the egg wash until almost right before it is done. It helps a little, but the foil works better. And don't be afraid to add in more honey (It tastes like heaven) and add just 1/4 tsp more of yeast.

I've never eaten challah before, so I wasn't sure what to expect. It was so good that my kids and I almost ate an entire loaf in one evening. I followed the suggestions provided by Feeding Frenzy and the bread was beautiful. In fact, I have made this twice in one week.

This is by far my favorite Challah recipe. I use this recipe every week to make Challah. I have altered it a bit over the last few months. I use 1 package of active dry yeast, olive oil, 1/2 cup of honey, organic unbleached wheat and unbleached all purpose flour. Thank you for sharing your recipe with us.

This will easily make 4 regular size Challah loaves in an 11x15" pan.  I proofed the yeast in warm water and honey, and in the measuring cup honey was in added eggs and oil, mixed then set aside enough for brushing on top before adding rest to yeast mixture.  Worked beautifully.  I've never made such fluffy bread before. Was my first time making challah...and yes, it's just like what we bought in Israel.

It was a little denser than I expected, but I suppose if I let it rise a little longer that *might* solve the problem?  Flavor was really good, looked just beautiful!  Used it the next morning for French toast - again, a little dense for that, but the flavor was still good.

Great Challah recipe! I altered it by adding one more egg, reduced the baking time by 7 minutes and added some honey to the eggwash :) I also covered it with foil after 20 minutes to reduce the amount of browning.

Love this recipe! First time making any bread so I halved the recipe in case it didn't turn out, I was really amazed and proud of the result though. So yummy too! Next time I make it I will use more honey.

Just made this. Only waited 30mins to let cool ( couldn't wait) and it's nice fluffy and a tad sweetness from the honey on the inside. And a nice crust on the outside. Mine don't look as pretty( not good at the braid on bread thing) but still delicious. And once I get the braid down. Be perfect. Thank you for a fabulous recipe!

I halved the recipe and added step 1 ingredients
to my Sunbeam Bread Machine and set it on "dough" setting.  When cycle was complete I continued with steps 2-5.  The texture was fantastic.  I would have given this five stars, but the recipe is time consuming (but worth it).

Very nice recipe.  Love it.  Unfortunately, where I live (Køge, Denmark) one cannot purchase active dry yeast at a grocery store (one is stuck with purchasing fresh yeast, which is a lot trickier).  I did manage to tweak the fresh yeast, and it worked.  Also, I brushed the egg on *before* letting it rise that second time, and I substituted sesame seeds for poppy seeds.

I made this recipe twice- the first time i followed it exactly and it came out nicely- a little too much flour. The second time i decided to let it rise overnight, kneading it twice. Big mistake!! It never rerose to it's original rising peak and it cane out much smaller than last time!! Once again, tastes floury. 

Some positive suggestions would be to add an apple in 1/2 inch cubes and raisons- both of which i rolled around in cinnamon sugar!! Also, top the challah with a bit of cinnamon sugar after you glaze it with egg! Gave it a nice sweet taste.

This is a amazing recipe but I recommend to ignore the bake time the proper way to check if it is done is knock on it if it sounds hollow it is done.

Recipe was exact. Only had a problem with the braiding. But watched the video a couple of times and that worked great. Will most certainly make this again.

Wonderful recipe as is. Have made it a few times off off the instruction. Recently, I started adding herbs to the bread to change the flavor with the meals. Still az among and I don't need to add anything other the how I want it to taste. Everyone loves it ad it makes enough to do a six bread and even the circle challah styles.

I've been baking bread for almost 30 years.  This recipe was one of the most exact I have ever followed and the bread, if not the best certainly one of the best I have ever made.  Sweet, perfect crumb and crust, I added nothing, changed nothing and will be making this over and over again!

This made a really yummy challah with a little sweetness. It was light and soft with a slightly crunchy crust. I really loved it! It also was not much work considering the outcome. I would recommend this simple and good recipe!

After first rise, you can refrigerate overnight which makes braiding much easier but allow for extra rise time using the finger indent test. I glaze with 1 egg, 1T olive oil and 1T white sugar

This recipe is perfect. It makes two delicious loaves of challah. I don't add or change anything about it and it comes out perfect every time. Every one who has tried it asks me to make it again and my kids have some much fun with braiding it. Thanks for the delicious recipe :)

This is the BEST! I'm no longer allowed to come to Shabbat dinner without bringing this Challah.  What I've tweaked: the honey--I normally count to four while pouring it out. And I disregard the flour amount. I use as much as the weather requires. DO NOT change the amount of oil, I tried and it came out with disastrous results! Thank you thank you, I'm now the favorite guest and no Friday night dinner party starts without it!!

Excellent and delicious. I made 5 smaller challahs and baked them for less time until they looked ready. I used a percentage of wholemeal flour, which is what I had in the house. This recipe is a keeper!!!

I've never made Challah before, or any breads that require yeast at all for that matter. Even a rookie like me can pull this off and have a very beautiful and tasty couple of loaves to show for it! I had many many compliments on both taste and appearance!

Easy to make and delicious! As good or better than store-bought Challah, at least what I've had in Boston and New York. I halved the recipe and used one egg and one egg yolk in the dough, saved the white from the second egg and used it as the dough wash. I also used 20g of cake (fresh/wet) yeast instead of dry. In addition I made a four-piece braid, which makes a better-shaped loaf than a three-piece braid does (to do this, just google or youtube four-piece braid). Some of the comments were wishing their loaves were fluffier, if you're getting super dense bread with this recipe make sure your yeast isn't old (use cake yeast if you can find it), try not to add too much extra flour beyond what the recipe calls for while kneading, and if you want you can even try letting the bread rise longer than an hour after you form the loaves. They should double in size, if they're not, let them rise longer.

Yum, this was so good! I made it for the office to celebrate Rosh Hashanah (even though none of us are Jewish, but we sell Jewish products) We all loved it and I will probably make it again or other occasions. We ate it with honey butter and it was so sweet and so tasty!

My husband and I have just one word for this Challah recipe--AWESOME!!  Since I am no longer able to find Challah in any of my local stores, I decided to try this.  I halved the recipe, and altered it pretty much as Feeding Frenzy did, using 1/2 c honey and one egg plus 3 yolks.  Turned out beautifully.  Can't wait to use this for French toast.

Boyfriend requested french toast for his birthday breakfast so I searched for a good bread recipe to use for it. Very glad I stumbled upon this recipe. I have never eaten challah bread before so I dont have a frame of reference but this bread is so good. I followed the recipe exactly except that I used bread flour instead of all purpose. I found that I did not need all 8 cups. I got through about 6.5 cups before the dough reached the desired consistency. This recipe makes ALOT of dough... I wasn't prepared for having so much bread at one time so instead of two large loaves I made one large loaf and three smaller loaves. I preheated my baking stone at 550 for one hour and then decreased the temp to 375. I placed the loaves directly on the baking stone and baked for 25 minutes. Turned out perfect. My family and I devoured two of the smaller loaves right out of the oven. We used the third smaller loaf for french toast this morning and now we have the huge loaf left over. I will probably half this recipe next time unless I'm feeding more then 4 people.

A PERFECT Challah!  Everyone RAVES about it every Friday night.
I make a strudel topping (instead of poppy seeds) by mixing one teaspoon of melted margarine with 2 tsp of flour and 3 tsp of white sugar.  Mix it until it is a crumble consistency and sprinkle it on just before popping into the oven.
YUM!

Great recipe.  My breads were way too dense before this one.  I make one giant Challah.  I pair it with honey butter by softening the butter and it mixing it with honey.  I then let the butter harden in the fridge.  I top off the bread with a wash of two eggs yolks and a tablespoon of water, poppy seeds, and a sprinkling of kosher salt.

This bread is great for bread pudding and sandwiches! It is not too sweet or too eggy. The honey gives it a wonderful scent that is not overpowering. The bread came out beautifully the first time I tried it and even my very picky sister liked it better than my mother's egg bread.

I love this recipe!  I made 1 change though.  Instead of using the whole egg, I only used the yolk.  I think next time, I would skip the egg wash and use oil or butter. Overall, this is about as authentic as it gets.

I have made challah bread with my dad a couple times from recipe books but they were always too dry or not flavorful enough. I just made this bread 2 days ago and after figuring out how to activate the yeast without killing them, the bread came out wonderfully! Rose beautifully, added about 3/4 cup honey which was perfect and next time I may add an extra egg yolk or 2 like the latest review did to make it more yellow and eggier in the middle. I introduced my 10 housemates to challah bread and made french toast with it tonight and everyone has gobbled it up and I also loved it and I am super picky when it comes to challah. It'd be great with raisins or cinnamon and sugar too! I'm definitely experimenting next time with one of the loaves!

Love this recipe. lovely flavor with a bit of sweetness to it. i definitely added extra flour to get the right consistency and the ability to divide and roll into strands that could be braided. this was perfect for Rosh Hashanah with raisins added in on roll out. i sprinkled with poppy seeds after i brushed on the egg at the end. really dense, moist and super flavorful. loved it! and so did the family.

This is a wonderful bread... sometimes I add golden raisins, cinnamon, or nuts.  IF you have any leftover a few days after baking - it makes a delicious french toast.

I halved the recipe and then made a few alterations along the way. Instead of putting a 1/4 cup of honey in it (remember, I halved mine, so it would've been 1/4 instead of a 1/2 cup), I used a 1/4 cup of brown sugar and 2 tablespoons of honey. I still used 1 tablespoon of yeast, however. The bread is delicious. I didn't bother with using any poppy seeds and I brushed the top of mine with butter so it would soften nicely instead of egg. It's been about 3 days later now and there's only a bit left, just as good as the store brands and isn't as crumbly as other bread recipes I've tried.

Simply amazing! I opted for a sweeter version and reduced the recipe by half and used 1/2 cup of brown sugar in place of the honey (could have been even sweeter so next time I'll use a full cup of brown sugar). I also added 1/2 teaspoon of Cinnamon. One egg and one egg yolk resulted in a perfect texture! The left over egg white is perfect to brush on top for a superb shine. So gorgeous and delish!

Excellent bread. I'm not jewish so I can't say if it's comparable to traditional challah but strictly from a bread point of view it is excellent. I made it in my kitchen aid. Once the flour was mixed in I split the dough in half so the mixer could handle it. Next time I will 1/2 the recipe- this made 2 HUGE loaves. I did add 1/4 cup extra of honey and also added a tbsp or so of honey to the egg wash but otherwise I stuck to the original recipe. I did a six strand braid (I looked it up on you tube). Absolutely gorgeous. (I baked it for 30 minutes at 350 degrees)

My first time baking bread, doing challah/ha-motzi and a success. Moist inside but light, flavourful but not overpowering, everyone loved it.

I made this bread yesterday! I used wheat flour instead of white. It was light and fluffy and turned out perfect! Everyone LOVED IT! I did not seperate the yokes from the white when sperading it on the bread before baking and had no problems as another reviewer mentioned.

Really, good, but I see the recipe has changed slightly since I printed it out originally.  I multiple the recipe to use 4 eggs, and make 4 small loaves.
We also add chocolate chips to the batter, and use 1/3 whole wheat flour.

LOVE this recipe!  Last year during Rosh Hashanah, I saw this bread on t.v.  It was a beautiful looking bread.  I'm not Jewish but had to know how to fix it.  I will be making it for the holidays.

I've tried this recipe twice and it's been amazing both times. For those halving the recipe, like I did, put 2 eggs in. Also - I experimented both times with different amounts of raisins - 1/2c the first time and 1c the second time. 1c was definitely better, but remember to leave the dough a little bit sticky before the first rising if you use raisins - they soak up the moisture from the bread. You could also plump the raisins with water before adding them.

I ran out of AP flour while baking this, so I substituted about 1/2 c freshly ground flax meal and 1-1/2 c king arthur's bread flour. I prefer my challah bread to be sweeter, but other than that (and presumably due to my lack of AP), it was a great and EASY recipe.

I've never written a review on this site before, but this recipe is FANTASTIC! I have always had trouble getting challah "just right" but this recipe made me look like a pro. Reduced the flour to 7 cups (plus a couple tablespoons for flouring the countertop) and I agree with previous reviewers that the challah should be covered after the first 20 minutes to prevent browning. But this recipe gave me just the dense, pull-apart-able consistency that I was dying for!

mmm good. Not quite as light as I wanted.  Took advice from other users: 1. after 20 min in oven, I covered with foil so it would not over brown. 2. used honey- egg wash rather than plain egg wash  This was an easy recipe to follow. I'm not a baker so all the tips and thorough directions came in handy. The most difficult piece was rolling out the 3 strands for braiding. I literally swung the strands like a jump rope until they were long enough! Rolling didn't work for me!

I used the altered recipe as stated by feeding frenzy and it came out FANTASTIC! my family were ecstatic, and the only alteration i used was a omission of the honey in the egg wash. The foil tent is CRUCIAL as otherwise the challah will burn to a crisp.

Love Challah bread and wanted to try to make it for the first time. It turned out perfectly! My family couldn't get enough. My mom even brought some to work to show how tasty it was! It's only been one day and half of the gigantic loaf is almost gone because my father won't stop eating it! It takes some time to make but it's worth it in the end. The smell is so wonderful I wish my home always smelled like fresh baked Challah!

Followed suggestions from the top reviewer for this recipe who said he figured out how to "make it perfect."  And, it came out perfect!  This is the first time I've ever had bread rise correctly, look great, and taste great!  Thank you!

I've been making challah for years and am always looking for the "best" recipe. I was spurred on in my quest by all the positive reviews for the recipe...I made it exactly as written w/o any changes/additions. The consistency was perfect but the taste -- it had none! I don't like my challah particularly sweet but this bread was bland...tasted like flour and water...next time I may do as others have suggested and increase # of egg yolks and honey.

This is the best bread I've made. Followed another reviewer's advice of only baking for 25 min. I'm not sure if I'd classify it in the same category as the Challah I had growing up, but it's absolutely delicious. I think if I wanted to make it more Challah-y next time, I'd add more eggs? The bread itself is light and fluffy, I got 3 decent sized loaves out of this recipe. I will say I attempted to make the dough in my bread machine (2 lb loaf max) and it couldn't handle the large quantity or possibly the stickyness- the mixing paddle somehow came off. Still, made it by hand and it turned out amazingly. Dusted sugar, cinnamon and cocoa powder on the top of one loaf, delicious.

SO good! I halved the recipe, but kept the original amount of honey, so it would be a little sweeter.  Result was probably the most delicious challah I have ever tried. Fantastic

I had never had challah before trying this recipe so I don't know how this recipes compares to others but I would say it is mediocre as bread goes.  It does have a nice appearance & it was easy to make but the flavor is nothing special.  I find fresh baked white bread to be better.

I LOVED making this bread, and as I have Jewish roots, it really felt special to make this bread.  When you coat with egg, just coat the very raised parts of the braid - it makes for a neat "contrast."  AND, it bakes wonderfully on an oiled stone - it'll get done quicker so watch for an earlier finish.

A little more difficult than I was expecting, and takes some significant experience with bread doughs. My friend and I made it together and hers was much better, though.

This turned out tasty , smells wonderful and looks great. I used half whole wheat flour, added 1/2 a cup of brown sugar, and two extra egg yolks. Then I used an egg wash and baked for 20 minutes uncovered then another 10 minutes loosely covered in foil. It's a little dry, next time I am going to add a bit more salt and oil, 1 cup of honey (no brown sugar), and bake it for 25 minutes uncovered to tweak it, but it's really good now anyway:)

My 13 year old daughter and I made this for the first time ever making a bread.  We both had a blast and we thought it came out great!  We gave our neighbor the other loaf.  All of us agreed, it's a definite keeper! I thought it was too dense but was told we over-kneeded ithe dough.  We'll cut back next time and add golden raisins.

This recipe makes a wonderful challah but I do adapt it a little.   1. I use maple syrup instead of honey. 2. Maybe it's because the maple syrup is so runny but I always need an extra 300g of flour. 3. I make one loaf with poppy seeds and the other I cover with cinnamon sugar (This one is also incredible for French toast). 4. I bake both loaves together for 30 minutes exactly.   This recipe along with my own adaptations always creates the best bread I've ever made and is quite simple.

I make this every week. I have the recipe b/c of small family size. I sometimes use half whole wheat flour and half regular AP, but it is best made with bread flour, also called high gluten flour if you can find it. Love it!

This recipe was a big hit with the family for Shabbat tonight.  I did agree with the person who said it was really crumbly but I think that was just because it was still really hot when we first cut into it.  Over all im giving this recipe a 4 because it was good but not great.  Im going to try other recipes to compare.

I have made this recipe four times now, and everytime it turns out great. I always put 3/4 cup of honey instead of 1/2, and I add raisins. After the bread is done, and baste it in butter and then sprinkle cinnamon sugar on the top. I like to either do a 5 or 6 strand braid, and then swirl the loaf into a circle. I have been using all purpose flour, but today I'm trying bread flour. We'll see how it turns out.

Thanks for the recipe!

This bread is fantastic!!  I used an extra 1/4 cup honey, an extra 3/4 cup flour, an extra egg yolk, and only 1 teaspoon salt in the dough.  I only kneaded the dough for a minute after it rose.  I let the braided loaves rise before I baked them and I brushed them with 2 egg yolks beaten with 1 tbls. milk.  I baked both braided loaves on silicone mats at the same time for 35 minutes.  The bread tastes kind of like a dense, really, really good sweet Hawaiian bread.  Beautiful and delicious!!

Fabulous recipe as is! We have made several times and get 2 loaves that we braid into 6 strand Challahs. Gorgeous presentation! Large loaves too.

If do as 3 strand braid can get 4 loaves.

This Challah isn't very Challah-like. It is nice braided white bread. Pretty, but not at all eggy and not sweet enough. Will try again with recommendations from other reviewers, but I don't hold out much hope.

This bread requires more baking time than other breads, which I foolishly did not pay attention to the instructions. The challah was underdone in the middle (it was basically dough). Because it is braided the middle does require more baking time and might not be done int he center. Follow the instructions completely. The challah that was salvageable was yummy, though I do agree with other reviewers and think that next time I'll maybe add two more eggs or egg yolks to the dough to make it eggier. Still, it was tasty. Will try it again but with the corrections.

I altered this recipe slightly, and it is absolutely perfect!  I used an entire pkg of yeast, doubled the honey, and used 1 egg plus 3 yolks--all at the suggestion of another review.  This bread is soft, slightly sweet, perfectly tender and chewy, just wonderful!  I can't say enough good things!

Just made this today and LOVE IT. I only made a few small changes. I halved the recipe since its just my husband and me. I used one whole package of yeast. In the bread I used 1 whole egg and 1 egg yolk. I used the remaining egg white for the egg wash. I added a little extra honey in the bread and in the egg wash. Other than that I followed the recipe and it came out super great. My husband and I have already eaten about half the loaf and I can't wait to eat the rest. Thanks for the recipe.

This is one of my favorite recipes, I have made it multiple times, however, I add cinnamon and raisins, the smell is amazing when it comes out of the oven!  This does take time and a little concentration (for the kneading).  Not toddler friendly however, unless grandma is nearby.

GREAT recipe. Followed it to the letter the first time - except followed the advice about 25 minutes rather than 40. It was done in 25. In the future, I probably wouldn't let it rise so long - I like dense challah. I would probably also add more honey. We dipped it in honey this time to fix that problem. Great bread!

It is a very good recipe. I only add a bit sugar in. I like it when the challa is a bit sweet.

I think I need to keep making. I made 2 loaves on sunday and they came out hard as rocks. Last night I made them again, looked better yet still a little hard. What can I be doing wrong?

I have never made bread before, but this was a hit at Easter dinner--my sister-in-law even wanted the recipe!  It did take longer to rise each time (about 20-30 minutes extra) but our house is rather cool.  I am planning to make it again!

The bread tasted wonderful.  It was easy to make.  I forgot the oil, and it did'nt matter.  It still was good; especially on a winter sunday afternoon.

I am amazed at how easy it is to make my own bread! I am a novice at this and I made the foray into baking my own bread only because Challah is not easily available in India and I needed it to makeFigs White Chocolate Challah Pudding 
The bread smelled and tasted marvelous and the pudding was even better! I mostly am fascinated at how easily bread can be braided! I always thought it took some insider baking secret to get the loaves to look so pretty :)

I've never made a loaf of bread before in my life, and when I served this with dinner, I looked like some sort of ridiculous expert breadmaker! I didn't have any honey on hand, so I used 1/2 cup of sugar with a little extra water so as to not throw off the consistency of the mixture.

After only having made bread once in my life, I decided to give this recipe a go.  As other posters suggested, I used an extra egg in the batter, and used 3/4 cup honey instead of 1/2 cup.  The loaf on the top rack was done in 25 minutes; the loaf on the lower rack took a couple more minutes.  The final product tastes a bit like King's Hawaiian Bread, which is a good thing.  It's great just pulled from the loaf, or toasted & topped with margarine.  I'm going to try using it to make French Toast over the weekend.

I wound up using almost 10 cups of flour in order to make the dough "not sticky."  I'm not sure if that was just because of the extra egg + extra honey or not.  I'd say just make sure you have a little more than 8 cups of flour on hand before you start, just in case.

This was really easy. I halved the recipe, used one egg for the batter and one egg for the wash, and it turned out great. One of my friends who is Jewish said that it was very authentic! I think it's a great tasting bread, and I'll definitely be making it again.

Tried this last week using my bread machine on dough setting.  Best bread I have ever made in my bread machine.  Brushed tops of loaves with butter before baking.  Delicious, 

Made this last week.  Best bread I have ever made in my bread machine.  Husband has already requested that I make again.  Delicious"".

This was fun to make & even though I'm still a novice at bread-making, the dough was great to work with; it seemed almost ... silky.  I got to use my new mixer to mix/knead the dough and it was a snap!  I did replace 4T of flour with 4T of vital wheat gluten which always seems to help my bread doughs rise in my coolish climate.  In fact, I sort of got overly-involved in catching up with Grey's Anatomy on the 2nd rising and let it rise too long; so the size of the loaf is gargantuan! :-) I cut this recipe in half for one loaf since there are only 3 of us home right now.  Had some for toast this morning, but my main plan is to use it with the "Oprah's Favorite Sandwich in America" (FABulous curried chicken sammies!) for dinner tonight.  While I am, by no means, a challah expert, I was expecting this to taste a little more eggy, but it is still a very nice bread.  Thank you so much, Joan!

This is very good.  Having never made nor eaten Challah, I can't give it a 'best' rating.  But it was easy to make in the stand mixer and looks really nice.  It's sweeter than I'm used to, but I'm sure it will make good toast.  I wouldn't want it for a savoury sandwich at all.

I wasn't sure what to expect as this was my first time making bread from scratch.  I will be making this for a dinner party in a few weeks and I am glad that I gave it a test run first, as there are a few changes I would make when baking this again.  First, as other reviewers have said, it could stand to be egg-ier.  Also, I like my challah a bit sweeter than this was so I would increase the honey by about 1/2 a cup.  The bread turned out great as written, but I think it could be fantastic with these amendments.

This bread was fairly hassle-free to make, and it tasted delicious.  I followed other reviewers' suggestions and added a couple of extra egg yolks and an extra 1/4 cup honey.  My only complaints would be that the colour was not that of challah - still very white even though there were the extra egg yolks, and it wasn't as fluffy as I would have liked.  Next time, I'll add more yeast.  I'll definitely be trying this recipe again, though!

WOW!!  This challah is the best I've ever had and I didn't even have to go out to get it.  It is a LOT of dough to work with so be ready to knead but you will not regret the results.  I've made rounds for the high holidays and braids for the Sabbath and sometimes just because it's soooo good.

This was my first attempt at making Challah bread and with the addition of one more egg, it was awesome! For those fellow Ellen D. fans out there, you'll know what I mean when I give my personal "shout out" to Joan. So Joan, I give you a "HOLLA" for your wonderful Challah!!!! Thanks!

I've always thought that Challah was really complicated to make. Another recipe even suggests leaving the bread to rise overnight... But I made it for the first time following this recipe and it was wonderful. Definitely a recipe I'll be using again. thank you

Another challah recipe that I love.  Such an easy recipe. I love that it is so light.  I made the recipe into 4 smaller loaves for the holidays for my co-workers.  The loaves were still the size of most loaves of plain bread in the grocery store.    I also made a batch for one of my co-workers to take home for her big family gathering.  I ran out of white flour and used 2 cups of wheat.  Not trational, but really good.

True, it's not eggy, but it's yummy. I braided mine and added cinnamon and sugar on top. My loaves turned out fantastic! I will definitely make this again.

I searched for a recipe similar to a friend's that wouldn't give her's up.  Now I've found one even better!  I enjoyed making this recipe because it was easy - no fuss.  It baked well, although I only put it in for 25 minutes.  My family LOVES it and I think it is just the right amount of sweet to be delightful.  It is moist and very hard to stop eating - beware!  Challah has a beautiful presentation being that it is braided and this recipe is a sure way to impress anyone.

This came out beautifully and I had never made challah before. I incorporated a few tips from another baker to make it a bit sweeter and eggier.

First bread I have made that pretty much came out much better than expected!  Took the advice from a few of the other reviews and used what I thought was the best of them.   Activated the yeast with some sugar and water first then added the egg, salt, oil, honey and then added the flour cup by cup.  Baked a total of 40 minutes at 375.

I found this recipe easy to follow and the bread was delicious! Dough was nice to work with. I did make some of the changes as suggested by other reviewers (used milk, one egg and 3 egg yolks) I have plans to make this a regular bake in our house.

This is delicious! Love the texture, and the dough was beautiful to work with. I made a half batch then slip that into two to make two mini loaves. Made one with cinnamon swirl and one chai spiced with a orange glaze. Awaiting the final verdict from the family ( I made these at around 2 am) but I'm sure they'll love it!

Amazing!  Star dish of my dinner!  I followed other suggestions of other and halved the recipe (made one loaf) and used 1 egg plus three yolks and a half a cup of honey. I kept the yeast at 1 and a half teaspoons. Finished with an egg wash and large flakes of salt. When it was done baking a drizzled honey on top of the challah. As traditional challahs are served I left it whole for everyone to pull off their own pieces at the table. THANK YOU FOR THE RECIPE!  I should also note that I used my regular kitchen aid which really helped. Whisk for wet ingredients and switched to the hook once I started adding the flour - life saver.

Followed directions perfectly. Looked great after about 25 min in oven - nice and brown. Actually, it looked done! Recipe said 40 min so I lowered temp to 325 and covered with foil. After about 6 min. I started to smell it burning. Black on bottom. Only in for 31 min! I used two non-stick pans. Oven is only a little over a year old and has never had an issue.

I found this to be a great recipe! Just a couple tweaks.  I used 1 and a half packets of active dry yeast, 1 and a half cups of whole milk with 1 cup of water, used a full cup of honey, one egg and 2 yolks. I also ended up using close to 2 extra cups of flour to get the right consistency. I mixed a bit of honey with the egg wash and basted it again 20mins into baking, and finished it off with the last 10mins. It was absolutely perfect this way!

Okay, I love this recipe.  I had never made challah bread before, and it was a good project.  Easy,  fun, and really beautiful.  Because it made two loaves, we can make ( and freeze). French toast.

Here is something about which I feel inclined to warn you.   DO NOT ADD ANY  WHEAT FLOUR.   I ran out of white flour,  so ended up mixing a cup or two.  The wheat taste took over the lovely challah flavor.   Be careful about that.

This took awhile to make because there was sooo much dough to work with. I could have easily made three or four loaves with how large these two loaves were. I've never made this bread before and my family loved it! Thank you!

I will definitely make again! May add a bit more honey to make it a bit more sweeter however we dipped it in some honey Friday dinner and that solved it. Super easy and I definitely encourage you to watch the video I probably went by the video more than the instructions and it turned out beautiful!

This was my first ever attempt at bread, and baking in general, and it came out great! Fantastic, and simple! I’ve made it three times now, so here are my obligatory tips and substitutions: 1/2 cup of honey, a whole pack of yeast, 1 whole egg and two yolks without whites for the dough. The whites get used for the wash. Happy baking!

I made this bead and it is outstanding!  The crust is crunchy and the center is moist. It did brown quickly in my oven , so I placed a piece of aluminum foil over the top. Perfect!  Better than I expected!

It came out a little hard and dense, and tasted like normal white bread. I was disappointed. Maybe I did something wrong.

This wasn't just my first time making Challah, it was my first attempt at any bread. It didn't come out perfectly, but as a self proclaimed horrible cook, I was proud as was my boyfriend. I think I just overdid the flour. Great recipe and I'll try less flour next week. Thanks for sharing!

I like my challah sweeter and would add more honey (though I don't know if the salt needs to be increased as well, for contrast..?). 

It turns out that "about 40 minutes" in my oven means "Check loaves at 30 minutes--at 40 minutes, the bottom of the loaves will be burnt."

This was so hard to rate! I used the changes suggested by Feeding Frenzy and it came out PERFECT! And this was the first time I’ve ever made Challah! I would’ve given the original recipe a 3, but with the changes, it was a 5. So, I split the difference. Cutting the recipe in half and using regular, all purpose flour, (because I didn’t have the unbleached) resulted in utter perfection! So, I used the packet (or 2-1/4 tsp) of yeast, 1/2 cup honey, 1 egg and 3 yolks and the the 1 tbsp of honey with 1 egg for the wash. Make sure to halve the remainder of the recipe and follow the same times for rising as you would with the original recipe here and I think you’ll love it! Mine disappeared within 2 days. It’s phenomenal!

I have made this 4 times now in the past month. Love this recipe! I was so intimidated by yeast breads, I had never made Challah before. This recipe comes out perfectly every time! I made it over Christmas week, and then later for another family gathering on New Years because my family begged me to make it again (including my siblings, mom, nieces and nephews). I am making it again tonight and told my sister. She invited me over to watch the game, actually, she said "The bread is invited, you can come too".

I don't know how this recipe gets 5 stars from so many people-- apparently you guys don't know what challah is-- it's EGG bread!  This bread isn't the least bit the taste or texture of challah.  It doesn't hold it's shape on the second rise-- it flattens out to about 1 inch.  Baking time is too hot for too long.  The texture of the bread is dense, dry, and more like Italian bread.  I've made it twice-- same result.  I am an experienced baker.  Don't waste your flour.

I halved the recipe and ended up with such lovely dough I immediately made a 2nd batch.  1st batch I did in convection oven and found the crust just a bit too hard. Next time in standard oven was perfect but made the half recipe into 2 loaves and the bake time was 25-30 mins and absolutly perfect. This is such a lovely soft and a easy bread. Glad I found this recipe! 
Last batch I just dumped the flour in all at once, I won't do that again, I ended up having to add a load more flour but when I added a cup at a time the measurements were spot on. 
Finally a bread that doesn't come out as hard and dense as a brick when I make it at home. :)

We've only made this twice and it turned out wonderfully.  We did make some adjustments.  One was based on other reviews, we only baked it 30 minutes, and it was done to an internal temperature of 205 the first time, 210 the second time.  We substituted olive oil for the vegetable oil.  We produce EVOO, so it goes in everything.  Also, to split the recipe in half, we used 1 egg and 2 yolks.  

My advice is to watch the video.  I skipped it the first time and the braiding wasn't great, but watched it the second time and it helped greatly.  I hope to continue to improve on the braiding.  This is delicious.

This bread is good and should not turn out bad.  I've been making this since I was like 13 and have never had any problems. If you think it's crumbly you probably didn't knead it long enough. You need to knead it until it springs back when you press your finger into it. I'm almost positive any mistakes are solely user error. Shabbat shalom

I didn't make any  changes, except to use sesame seeds in place of poppy seeds.  I made a braided loaf and a braided ring, and they looked - and tasted - delicious! I took the loaf to my son's house on Thanksgiving, and it was a big hit. The video was really helpful for shaping the dough; starting the braid from the middle makes such a nice, even braid!  I will definitely make it again!

Tried so many different challah recipes over the years, and none could compare to this one.   Delicious and so easy to make!  My family asks for it every year at the holidays now.  The only change I make to the recipe is the addition of more flour - I usually hit about 12 cups total (with kneading flour included) with all other ingredients remaining the same.  And it comes out perfectly every time.  :)

I made it just as the recipe described and it was delicious. We had it fresh out of the oven and it was heaven. It makes two big loaves so I gave some away and we also had it with a stormy chowder that my mom made. We enjoyed it immensely. Also, my daughter really had fun helping me with it. We will definitely make this again!

This is a great recipe! I have never made or had challah before but it is very delicious. The dough worked great for my braids (there is a learning curve for sure). It browned nicely in the oven without me having to put foil on it. Instead of 2 eggs in the batter I used 1 egg and 2 yolks for a richer flavor. Besides that no other subs.

Mouth watering and delicious. I made honey butter to accompany it, and it was divine. Will definitely be using this recipe again.

Amazing and so easy.  I added extra honey.  I made a huge round challah.  It was my first time and it turned out beautiful.  YouTube helped with the presentation part.  It was undercooked in the center so I should have cooked it a bit longer.

Delicious! Moist and tasty. I added an extra whole egg to the mix and increased the honey to almost a full cup. The dough is very sticky and needs to be worked with flour, I found, even after the first rise, but it is well worth it!

I have made this MANY times.  Here are my modifications.

- 1200-1250g BREAD flour
- cook 25 minutes
- I like to proof the yeast
- I kneed by hand
This can make 2 large or 4 smaller Challah.

Love how this turned out. This was my second attempt at ever making bread and it is amazing! I accidentally added the third egg into the mix at the beginning but it did not make a difference in the end product. Perfect texture.  Simply delicious. I baked my loaves for 35 mins.

I will admit, I have never had challah before so I don't know how it is -supposed- to taste, but I really enjoyed this recipe. I watched it being made once on a tv show and was in love with the look of the braid, so that brought me in. It did need quite a bit more than 8 cups of flour I will say, but otherwise good!

The consistency is like challah, but it is much to bland. I would add more eggs and honey. Probably 2x as much.

I did a double egg wash. once during the plaited proof and also just before popping it in to the oven.  The tablespoon of salt was more than I liked, so next batch I'll knock off a third of the salt.

I used 3 egg yolks and 1 egg white like other users suggested. Turned out wonderfully! I used my kitchen aid mixer then switched to the dough hook, and it worked okay. Didn't turn out too tough. Great recipe!

Very tasty challah. It came out well in a braided roll except for the fact that it was slightly burnt on the bottom. I halved the recipe even thought it still made a big challah. I recommend about 30 minutes on 375 if halved. Either way, it turned out great.

I made the recipe exactly how it said, except the bread was done in 30 minutes. The bread was tasty and looked beautiful, but it definitely does not have enough eggs to taste like challah bread. I will look for a challah recipe that uses more eggs and butter.

Great recipe. I only made two small adjustments. First, I let the yeast sit in warm water for about 5 minutes along with a tiny dash of sugar before mixing in the other ingredients. Also I made the egg wash with one yolk and a little water. Really nice loaves.

This bread had great flavor!  I did as a few others recommended and added an extra egg and was heavy handed with the honey as my personal preference is a sweeter bread. The only problem I had was that my bread burned, and wasn’t cooked all the way through.  The outside was much too dark and the ends even tasted slightly burned while the inside was slightly undercooked.  I will definitely make this again but turn the oven down maybe 25-30 degrees.   All I’m all, a keeper for sure!

I would add a little more sugar and a little more salt next time.  I used egg whites that I had from other baking rather than a whole egg and that was perfect.

It was a great recipe, but don't  be shy to sprinkle on a little sugar with your egg wash to add a nice little glazey crust! Also I might bake at 350 rather than 375 because my crusts got extra browned at just 8 minutes left. Other than that, great recipe!

My first time making bread of any kind and it turned out wonderful! I watch the video and it was very helpful. The only thing is I only had to bake mine for 28 minutes, good thing I checked the oven early or it would of burnt (must be the high altitude of where I live). Thanks so much Joan!!!! UPDATE! I decided to lower the baking temp to 350 as I found the bottom of my loaves always got to browned. Now I bake it for 30 minutes and it turns out perfect!

This recipe is delicious and simple to make.  I made it in a mixer, and basically dumped everything into the mixer, mixed it, pulled the bowl off to let it rise.  Then i punched it down and shaped it into two braided loaves and let it rise again.  We only baked it about 15-17 minutes, though, because 25 minutes into the first try it was almost burnt.  We prefer our challah on the slightly baked side.  This amount of time got the job done, it was cooked all the way through, but it was perfectly baked for our preference.  My family LOVED it and everyone begged for the recipe.  We also froze a loaf and it froze very well.

I'll rate it as a 4 star right now but I haven't tasted it, I may come back and re-review.
I halved the recipe since I only wanted one loaf and it still made a HUGE loaf! I doubled the honey and added 3 egg yolks as other people have done. I ended up using about 1 1/2 cup more flour just to get it to not stick like crazy and it was still a little to sticky for my taste as I was braiding it...

This was absolutely delicious! I had to add more flour than recommended, but I've made bread before so I kind of knew what consistency I was looking for.  It rose beautifully.  Making the braid was easier than I expected and impressed everyone!  I will certainly be making this bread again!

This bread is very light and fluffy. I enjoyed it very much, and my family did too. The recipe was easy to follow and the result was delicious. The bread could have done with more salt and honey, in my opinion. Excellent recipe, I'll definitely be bookmarking it.

This was awesome! Took about 5-6 hours start to finish though. I made two six-braided loaves and it took some time to youtube and wrap my mind around it! ha! Honestly I did make quite a few changes. I used 3/4 c honey, added honey to the egg wash, used 1 egg and 3 egg yolks, so it was very dense, eggy, rich. Oh, I used milk instead of water and butter instead of oil, so technically I guess I can't call it a real challah. ;) The outside browned a little too fast despite my attempts to cover with foil, so I think next time I'll lower the baking temp to 350, cook longer than 30 minutes and cover earlier with foil (if not from the very beginning). Oh, and I think checking the inside with a thermometer would be wise, if I can remember to do that. I topped with poppy seeds. I froze one of the loaves after baking and cooling. This is great, will definitely make again!

Thanks to the feedback before mine, I baked this for only 25 minutes in my gas oven.  A minute more would have ruined the loaves! This was the first time I made challah, and all other recipes seem to have more eggs.  Hence,  I added an egg to the dough portion.  I also used less than a tablespoon of kosher salt. This  dough was so great to work with.  Such an easy recipe for two beautiful loaves.  They were huge!  I can imagine it as a lovely centerpiece.  Thank you, Joan Callaway, for sharing this recipe, and thanks to those who warned about baking time!

I use 4 cups all purpose flour and 4 cups bread flour. Otherwise this is a wonderful recipe. I take one to our synagogue every few weeks and it's gone in minutes! B'H for a great Challah! L'Chaim

So delicious!  I have tried many recipes for challah and none was worth keeping until I made this one.  Everyone absolutely loved it and I got many requests for the recipe.

This is a fantastic recipe! I had made Challah before and my husband thought it too sweet. This one was a hit.

I DID switch some of the ingredients:

-used bread flour, used butter instead of oil and used  1/2cup of milk instead of all water. 

I know, it completely made it not Kosher but because we do not observe the Jewish religion, we were good.

This recipe went into our family cookbook. 

We live in a bit of a remote area and this made two 15" braids, one of which I gave away to a friend with kids... THEY LOVED IT!

Thank you for sharing this wonderful bread.

I made this for a school project and it was really good! I was lucky and read the reviews first and saw one that said "It burnt, it only needed 30 minutes" so I put it in for 30 minutes and it came out perfect.

Not as sweet as traditional challah.  But it made two nice 8x5 bread loafs.

I made 1/2 of the recipe because I only wanted 1 loaf. The dough mixed up good in my stand up mixer using the dough hook. I did have to add quite a bit more flour while kneading to keep it from being overly sticky. I found my bread to be done cooking at 35 minutes (maybe because I only had 1 loaf in oven). Crust is crispy & inside is dense with a nice flavor.  Would make again.

One of the eggs is for  the egg wash! We were doubling the recipe and therefore put in 6 eggs into the dough... Be cautious! Wonderful and delicious recipe otherwise :)

Easy recipe, dough came together nicely and result was a Very airy, light bread. It was relatively tasteless, however, so next time, I'll use more honey and more sugar. Took over 9 cups of flour to get the right consistency.

I made it exactly as written with one exception. I added 1/2 cup of homemade sour dough starter. It was excellent! Next time I will cut the recipe in half to make a much smaller loaf.

My husband is Jewish & the cook in our family...I am neither! This was also my first time baking any kind of bread ever. It turned out so good! The kids said it was perfect (they are also Jewish) and my doubtful husband said it was a  perfect Challah!!! Success!!

This is a very good challah recipe, but I did have to use way more flour than 8 cups (another 1-1/2 c). I made it again and because I like  a rich sweet challah, I reduced the water to 2c, used 4 Tbsp. butter instead of oil, used 3 eggs and 3 egg yolks, and used 2/3c honey and about 2 Tbsp. sugar.

I made this before and I can't wait to make it again.  It was amazing and my mother and mother-in-law couldn't believe I made it.  So many bread recipes we've tried come out like biscuit/bread, but this came out light, bouncy, and fluffy.  The only problem was the loaves were too big from this recipe.  This time I intend to make 3 or 4 challahs out of this.

I made it and it was fantastic! This is fairly simple compared to a lot of other recipes out there and my family loved it. I have a tricky oven, so it wasn't perfect, but if you have similar issues, I would recommend making this a few times to get it to your standards.

I love this challah! I've been trying recipes for almost 2 years and finally have found "the one". It's a little sticky so I usually use a little less water, more oil and more flour. Otherwise it's perfection!

Everyone in my family, even the picky eaters, love this bread! Usually, I add some whole grains to it, I don't change anything re; wetness or flour, I just add the whole grains with the flour, adds some depth and character to this traditional and basic recipe.

To make it more healthier I used 7 cups of whole wheat flour and one cup of all purpose flour. I also used 2 tbs of yeast, 1/4 cup of brown sugar and 1/4 of honey 4 tbs of coconut oil to substitute the vegetal oil. 
Excellent recipe. Thank you so much for the tips.

I reduced the cooking time to 20 minutes and then covered it with aluminum foil for 5 - 10 minutes.  I also topped it with course salt and brown sugar.  I also used egg whites mixed with honey to top brush on the top.  I wish I had added a little more honey and replaced the egg with 3 egg whites to make it a little lighter.  

The family really enjoyed this recipe.

I live in Panama City in Central America so we live in a very VERY humid climate. This makes it perfect for dough rising but terrible for mixing. You will need at least 2 additional cups of flour from the recipe for the dough to not stick and few powdered here and there to finish kneading it for the first rise. Add them with no fear unless you can knead it in an A/c conditioned kitchen. Other than that and adding few more flour to the second knead that´s it. It is perfect every time!!!

Ok, the one missing star is totally my fault. This bread is amazing! Love the eggy, sweet taste and it's moist and appropriately dense yet fluffy? Well, make it and you'll see what I mean. I didn't have honey and was snowed in, so I used pure maple syrup, and doubled it to 1 cup. Also, I followed suggestions and used 1 egg and 3 egg yolks, but accidentally added another egg. Not sure if that's why I had to use several more cups of flour to make it not sticky. One of the cups was whole wheat because I ran out of white. Everything seemed fine, rose well first time, braided easily, but during the second rising the bread lost all braided shape and spread out a lot. Maybe I let it rise for too long? I baked it anyway and it tastes amazing but I wish it had maintained the beautiful braided shape.

Yummy!  We wanted one big, impressive loaf, so we divided the full recipe in to quarters to make one four strand braid loaf.  It came out well!  To bake, we lowered the temperature a little, and cooked it for one hour.  We think we should have let it rise a little longer once the loaf was shaped, since it was a larger loaf, but other than that we were very pleased.

I have NEVER been successful with a bread recipe.  Meaning, i can't get my bread to taste addictive and yummy like store/bakery bought ones. But somehow,  i was able to pull this off and holy crud was it delicious! The first time,  i halved the recipe, used only whole wheat white because i was completely out of white flour, and also added another egg yolk and another 1/4 cup of honey per other reviewers' suggestion.  Yowza! Best whole wheat bread ever! This time,  I've got the white flour and using maple syrup since I'm out of honey.  It's in the second rising stage and already it looks like a winner.  Can't wait!

F.Y.I.  Halving the recipe made us 2 big store sized loaves.

I used this recipe to make mini challah rolls and portion them out to smaller sizes. I managed to get 21 total rolls from the listed recipe where each roll is about 250 calories.

Delicious bread with a few changes.  I made the full recipe and used a cup of honey, 1 egg and 3 egg yolks, and I ended up needing about an extra cup of flour.  One of the better Challah's.

This recipe is definitely worth the effort. I've made this twice now, and both times have been successful. The dough is very airy and smooth, and the crust is just delightful. I highly recommend this recipe.

While making the dough, the dough was so thick that the food processor couldnt even move. Adter about 30 minutes or right when it got out of the oven, it was as hard as a rock. I dont reccomend makin this recipe.

simple and very tasty with a lovely texture.  Made one loaf for the first attempt and the bottom crust was a little burnt.  Second attempt I made two loaves, used melted butter in place of the cooking oil, and baked at 350 instead of 375. Yum!
update: this time I divided the batch into 3 loaves - put egg wash and sesame seeds on one, cinnamon sugar and egg wash on another, and raisins and egg wash on the other.  all 3 turned out great - *love* this recipe!

I usually double this recipe and make 5 loaves. When I braid it, I do 7 oz of dough per rope (21 oz per braided loaf), and make 2 braided loaves. I then take the remaining dough, third it, and make traditional sandwich loaves. I bake the braided loaves either on a flat stoneware bar pan, or on a metal double-loaf French pan. I'm at high altitude (4800 ft above sea level), and bake at 350* for 22 minutes (metal) to 24 minutes (stone). My traditional loaves are baked in stoneware loaf pans, and I bake those for 30 min. This yields perfectly baked soft bread -- cooked throughout without a tough or burnt crust. My neighbor lived in New York for decades and swears this bread is as good as, if not better, than what she got in New York Jewish bakeries.

I agree with other reviewers that the dough was too sticky so I had to add more flour. I made this recipe for the first time last year for a Christmas party and it was a huge hit! it was nice and soft in the middle and a little more firm on the crust....... tastes great by itself or with butter!

My kids love this bread! I throw all the ingredients in my bread machine on the dough cycle, take it out and braid it as instructed. I don't even let it rise after I braid it, I just throw it in the oven and it rises beautifully!

I loved this challah and so did my family! It was sweet, and had a great texture.  I halved the recipe and changed a couple of things: 1.  I added more honey and used 1 egg and 2 yolks as another person suggested.  I also used olive oil instead of vegetable and it turned out amazing!  Really beautiful to look at and even more wonderful taste.  Thank you SO much for sharing!

My first attempt at challah was an epic failure, so I tried this recipe.  Was so excited that it worked! Thanks for the helpful video.  The flavor was nice, but I may try some of the variations people have posted in their reviews because I love experimenting with food and making it my own.

I started the mixing process with my mixer then went to my hands to incorporate more than eight cups of flour.  This gave me a good feel for the dough because I didn't want to add too much flour, but it probably took an additional cup.  I tented my bread after twenty minutes and shortened the cook time by five minutes.  Next time I may tent at fifteen minutes.

Great recipe, this bread tastes wonderful and is simple to make.  I always just make a half batch so I end up with one large loaf.  It seems I end up adding about an extra half cup-three quarters cup of flour (beyond the amount the recipe calls for) while kneading to make this dough not too sticky.  I highly recommend this recipe, it makes for great sandwich bread and french toast!

I made this recipe with only one package of activedry yeast (1/4 tsp) and it rose perfectly and looked beautiful.  This makes me think that one tablespoon (equivalent of 12 packages of yeast) would be far too much.  Perhaps the recipe calls for one teaspoon instead? 

Either way it is completely delicious!

I've never tried Challah before, so I have nothing to compare it to.  That being said, this is a really good bread and very simple recipe.  It turned out perfect!  Thanks!

I've made this twice now and both times have been delicious! I haven't braided it like traditional Challah bread so it came out super-fluffy since it didn't have a whole lot of extra handling.  The last time I made it, I ran out of white flour and finished with whole wheat flour (still turned out great).  I have also added chives to give it an eggy-herby taste.  A+!

This recipe is amazing. The bread turns out light and airy. The only thing is it could use more salt, or as I did, put salted butter on it. But over all it was DELICIOUS!! Great job.

I will definitely make this again! and a friend asked for the recipe. I am new to baking bread, and this turned out wonderful! I didn't have as much honey as the recipe called for, but will only use half next time because I think all that honey makes it a bit to sweet. We'll see, either way very yummy!

I've made this two times for my family now, and both times got rave reviews! I stuck pretty close to the recipe. One time I substituted sugar for honey, as I didn't have any on hand, and it turned out just fine. I plan to experiment with adding herbs in the future. I also had fun experimenting with different ways to braid it...the easiest way to make the braid look more intricate was to cut about 1/3 the dough of the loaf. Divide the larger part into three strands and braid, then divide the smaller part and braid as well. Then lay the smaller braid on top of the larger braid and tuck the ends under the larger braid. Came out beautifully! Will definitely be a standard for me!

Since me and at least half of me is Jewish me and my mom made this on the 5th night of Hanukkah. It was not very sweet so we added a sugar-honey glaze which consist of 1 & 1/2 cup of baking sugar and 6 Tbsp. of honey.

This bread is very delicious and easy to make.  This is my first time making bread and the directions were easy to follow even though I'm sure I didn't do everything exactly.  I gave it a four because of the directions for the bread:  I would suggest covering the challah for the last 20 minutes to minimize browning, and to take the challah out about 5 minutes early.  I also let the unmolded dough rise for an extra hour (2.5 hours total).  Also, grease the baking sheet very generously - I couldn't get it off even though I had greased it.  Wonderful tasty bread!

A beautiful bread!  I used a bread machine to make the dough, but otherwise followed the recipe.  I was very pleased with the results, and so were the people I served it to.

I had never had Challah before and so had no idea what to expect. But it was delicious! I served it to my guests and my one friend and her little boy devoured piece after piece. I mixed a teaspoon of garlic powder and onion powder each into soft butter for a spread. This recipe I will keep!

This is the best I have tried so far. It is very delicious. I followed the directions exactly and it turned out great! Make sure you watch the baking time and check it 5 minutes before to make sure it doesn't brown too much.

I've now made this twice, and both times it was delicious! Instead of oil I use applesauce, add two extra eggs to the mix and throw in 3/4ths of a cup of golden raisins. It's a good way for me to get extra protein in a delicious snack!

I added one more egg, and upped the yeast to 1 1/2 tbs and added a 1/4 cup granulated sugar.  Excellent, will definately us this as my go-to recipe for challa.

Wow! I just made this recipe, the bread is still warm. We loved it. I only made one loaf so I halved the ingredients and it's delicious. The only thing I think I will change next time is adding more honey, we like it sweeter. Thank you so much!

Great recipe indeed! However, for today's hurried lifestyle that we're leading we can't always prepare everything at home. I live in Atlanta and have found a little artisan bakery that supplies the freshest commercially available challot in the city! I go at least twice a month...Check them out http://gochallah.com

My very first try at making challah and it turned out great! I added two extra yolks and about 1/4 a cup more honey as one commenter suggested and it tasted delicious, just like the store bought loaves! My only complaint is that it did not rise very much and was a bit denser than I expected, but no one seemed to mind since I made it yesterday and they are already eaten up!

I used a KitchenAid 6qt mixer and used 10+ cups of flour to get the proper consistency.

During my initial try, I set the convection oven to 370 degrees and baked for 35 minutes.  As you can see I should have removed the Challah sooner.

the texture of this bread is awesome.  So silky when you are kneading it.  I didn't find it really eggy although I added an extra egg to the recipe.  But, it really didn't matter because it tastes great!  Won't last long!!

My family loves this bread and it was fairly easy to make.  I just followed the recipe.  However, I have no prior experience with Challah bread so I don't know how it's "supposed to taste"....  But we enjoyed this.

As a homeschooling family, we made this recipe when we were studying the Jewish holidays. Everyone loved it. Smelled so good. Makes 2 huge loaves. The kids keep asking for it. I will make it again.

This recipe was easy and made two beautiful loaves (and when I say beautiful, I mean it!) of light, moist, and slightly sweet white bread.  Yes, white bread.  Although it was delicious, it tasted nothing like challah, and the inside wasn't yellow - at all.  Next time I'll follow some reviews and add extra egg yolks to make it yellowish, and perhaps a bit of sugar to make it more like the bakery challah I usually get.  Thanks anyway for a great recipe, I'll try it again and experiment for sure!  OH yes and people, definitely put sesame seeds on top, it adds a great tastes and definitely looks heavenly!

Great recipe. I doubled the honey for Rosh Hashanah.  My husband usually hates Challah and he ate almost a whole loaf of this one his own.

Very good, for my first time making challah on my own I was surprised, will use the advise of friend and use oil and cornmeal on the pan. Loved the flavor though, eggy and sweet!

This Challah tasted great. I used poppy and sesame seeds though and it turned out perfectly. However, after twenty minutes of being in the oven it was finished so watch your Challah carefully!

This bread smelled delicious, looked delicious, and tasted delicious! I used 4 cups of whole wheat flour, as well as 4 cups of cake flour, as a variation. It turned out beautifully and just the right consistency for sandwiches and as a "dipping" bread with spaghetti. Hint: add more honey or sugar if you're looking for a sweeter bread.

Great recipe. It did take longer to rise for me. However, whenever I make bread, I find it usually takes much longer for my dough to rise than the instructions state. Although the braided loaf came out beautiful, I will make it in a regular loaf pan next time. I found that it didn't cook evenly within some of the braids. The texture was heavy in spots. Near the ends where it seemed to come together in one piece, the bread was evenly cooked. The taste of this bread is excellent. Loved it!!!

Had anticipated a sweeter taste.  Will make again and definitely incorporate some of the suggestions of other members, ie, more honey and egg yolks.  Was baked ahead of the 40mins and had to cover with foil to prevent too dark a colour.

I knocked off one star, only because I do think it will need some of the adjustments that others suggested...such as more honey and egg and only 30 minutes of cook time, instead of 40.

Still, for my first from scratch bread making experience, it was WONDERFUL! Will use this recipe, altered, from now on! Thanks for the recipe!!!

I wasn't sure what to expect from this recipe because I have never tried Challah bread before.  It was easy to make.  The braids made a beautiful presentation.  The taste was bland at the very first bite but then as I chewed it the flavor developed and I before I knew it I had eaten half a braid.  It made excellent french toast the next morning.  Good recipe, but not the grand slam I was looking for.

This bread is yummy.  I made the whole recipe, and it is a lot of dough, and makes 2 huge loaves!!  The dough is a little hard to handle when you first start kneading it- very sticky and it's a huge ball of dough.  But then it comes together.  I used half King Arthur White Whole Wheat Flour.  it turned out very well- still light and it rose very well- a little too well, but that was my fault because I put it on top of a hot oven.  It got really fat and puffy, lol.  I've never made of eaten Challah before.  It's so good with butter and honey or cinnamon/sugar.  I enjoyed this recipe.

My roommate was terrified that I was going to try baking the challah for our Shabbat dinner considering that I had only tried to bake Challah once before and we hadn't purchased a back-up.  But, it turned out great! I did add a little more honey and egg after reading the other reviews, but I'm not sure if it was necessary or not.  Either way, she's passing on the recipe to her mother and now that we have this recipe, we've sworn off purchasing challah!

this bread recipe is excellent:pretty easy to follow instructions and results that are exactly what you expect them to be -- a tender and flavorful bread, great with a good cup of tea or made into french toast.  I made this bread with raisins and it was wonderful! -- my in-laws could hardly believe i made it myself. :-)  I did follow the advice of one member to up the amount of yolks and honey in the dough.  Yummmm! definetly a keeper.

I love this bread - it is so good. I kept all the portions the same as the recipe indicated except I added some extra honey. I only had about 8 and a half cups of flour in my kitchen - so I could only add 8 because I needed the rest to keep from sticking - and I believe that's where my problem was. Don't get me wrong, the bread was great but not as light and fluffy as real challah. It still tasted great - and I will make it again but with more flour. I covered after 20 minutes so that it wouldn't get too brown.

This Challah was exactly what i had hoped for! It really tasted like the challah i was used to, and the way i braided it was beautiful! Everyone loved it, and it made excellent french toast and good bread pudding. Thank you soooo much!!! One more note: i can't eat store bought challah now without saying, "the one i made was SOOOO much better." =D

This challah did not taste like a lot of the challah I've had before, but it is still one of the best breads I've ever had.  It made two enormous loaves and everyone I gave it to loved it.

First of all WOW did this thing rise!!! I made 1/2 the recipe(one braid) and the way this thing rose, I could have made 2 braids!  But I had tried one Challah bread recipie before this, Bread machine Challah Bread, which was much better than this.  So if you can figure out how to convert a bread machine recipie to doing it by hand, I'd recommend that recipie over this one.  All in all, this is quite good and makes excellent French toast.

I've made this recipe twice, once with an extra egg, once without, and i have to say that i prefer it without. Also, it doesn't take nearly 40 min to bake. I'd say 25-30. I love love love this challah though, either way.  I dont think I'm going to be eating store bought for a long time.

Everyone else is raving about this bread so maybe I did something wrong but for some reason it didn't come out to expectations.  It seemed a little dense and didn't have much flavor.  I'll try again though considering the positive reviews by other people.

This is a nice bread but doesn't quite have the texture of the challah that I am used to, perhaps because it has fewer eggs than most recipes?

Delicious, although a little heavier then I expected. I may have over worked it, and I seemed to have too much flour, so I will take those into account next time. And this recipe makes HUGE loaves (that's a good thing). They didn't last long.
