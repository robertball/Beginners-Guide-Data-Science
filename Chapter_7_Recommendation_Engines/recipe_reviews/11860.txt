I made this with half the oysters and added a half pound of shrimp. It took a little longer than I expected, but after you prep the ingredients, you just keep adding things to your pan. Not too hard. Although I wished that I had added a little bit more salt. Still, everyone in my family enjoyed it and we ate the whole pan!

I made it more like a stew or soup, served it over the pasta. And I didn't have fresh pasta but used whole grain linguine. I added some cod I had and I'm sure I tweaked it in other ways because I can't follow a recipe to save my life. It was really good, good the next day reheated too, and I do wish I'd bought the large vat of oysters Costco had.

My husband absolutely loved this recipe!  And he's picky about oysters.  I added fresh oregano and fresh parsley from my garden. I didn't have crab meat so I had to skip it, and I skipped the corn too, but it was delicious anyway.   I added a little salt and pepper to taste.  Stick to your ribs comfort food!

Excellent! Didn't have scallions grated a red onion and
Saut√©ed with mushrooms. Used jarred oysters and used the liqueur as the stock. Used canned white corn rinsed and canned green beans rinsed. Also, didn't have fresh linguine, used boxed and cooked aldente before folding it in. This is delicious but keep a little chicken stock or pasta water aside to add if your family is eating at different times of the night. It tends to dry out but no problem. This pasta will absorb all the great flavors.......
 Yummy
