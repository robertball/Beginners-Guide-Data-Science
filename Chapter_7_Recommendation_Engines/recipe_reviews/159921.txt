This meringue came out fabulous, and was so easy.  After having the pie in the fridge overnight there was no weeping  either.  The taste was spot on!  Thank you!

I just moved to high altitude and the first time I made meringue it was flat.  I tried this recipe and it was fluffy and tasted very good.  It held up beautifully when it was cut.  I printed it and added it to my recipes.

Wow! I have never been successful with meringues before this recipe. The meringue had a perfect consistency. Thanks!

Works excellent, good flavor, and had everyone asking about the recipe!  Not sure about the non-weeping part tho as they didn't make it past supper :) - Calgary AB

My sister in CA sent me some lemons off the tree our Dad planted.  They make the most fabulous lemon pie.  But I never could manage meringue.  I live in WY at 7200 ft.  This recipe provided the crowning glory to a pie full of flavor and memories.  The meringue was huge, fluffy, flavorful with no cracking or weeping.  Thanks!

I live at 9,000 ft. and have always had an issue with meringue, but this recipe worked great!  I did microwave for 2:30, then let the cornstarch mixture cool for about 10 minutes, and then added.  Perfect!

This is the cat's meow!!! Sensational. I tried the Cook's Illustrated version and this one is better. You can't mess this one up. The meringue whips into a nice tall meringue. The meringue on my left-over chocolate cream pie still looked picture-pretty the next day. 
The only change I made was to add 1/2 teaspoon Cream of Tarter. Not sure if it really made any difference.

This was my first time making meringue.  People tell me how difficult it is to make, but for me it was pretty easy.  Made it for my pastor, for a pastor appreciation dinner because lemon meringue pie is his favorite dessert.  His only complaint was that it had to much meringue.  Very good easy recipe.

I am not a good meringue maker!!  I live at 2200 feet and this worked great.  This is the first time that it did not shrink and weep.  Excellent density and flavor.  Thank for a keeper!!

Thank you, thank you, thank you! I have never had any luck with meringue whether we lived in high altitudes or not. I do live in a fairly hi altitude now so after reading a number of comments and the article in Allrecipes on meringue, I decided on this one, It turned our perfect. It has not shrunk, wept or turned to candy. I am a happy meringuer!!

I live near Denver, CO, so a mile high.  This recipe came out great - nice and fluffy and tall, and holding it's shape well after a couple of days in the fridge.  I highly recommend this for high altitude!

oh my gosh,I just tried your recipe and it worked magnificently. The pie meringue I have been trying to make  for years never turns out. You stated it correctly , weepy and flat. My husbands homemade coconut cream pie looks fantastic for his birthday today. Thank you so much for submitting your technique for bakers like me who never give up on perfecting  merinque.

Excellent recipe. Used it up on the top of a mountain and at sea level. Works great both places. No more weepy meringue.

I just made this to go on top of a banana pudding, it is great. I followed it exactly except that I made a double batch. I found out after doubling it I did not need to this makes enough for a 9x13 pan. The recipe is easy and for the first time I made great Meringue, I had peaks and all. Thank you so much for sharing.

My family loves a lemon meringue pie but the next day most of the meringue has fallen or turned weepy. I decided to try this and it was fabulous! 5 star fabulous. Easy to make and firm fluffy peaks of meringue sat on top of my pie. The next night the meringue tasted just as good and still looked fabulous! I'm going to make all my meringues this way from now on!
