GREAT flavors.  I didn't have a chili pepper, so I used some hot chili powder instead.  I used 1 T oil instead of 1/3 cup since I wasn't putting it on the grill, and I'm working off those Christmas pounds.  I cubed the chicken and seared it in a nonstick pan with Pam.  I served it on top of grilled sweet onions, red and yellow peppers and fresh tomatoes.  With some brown rice on the side, it was pretty ANd tasty AND healthy.  My husband, who prefers not to experiment, even liked it.  I only have one regret:  that I didn't take a picture to post because it was so pretty.

Delicious.  But I made a mistake.  I shut the lid to my charcoal grill.  I didn't grill the chicken, but I smoked it.  The smoke overwhelmed all of the other flavors imparted by the marinade.  But the instructions were impeccable, and the chicken was moist.  For lunch, I reheated it in the microwave in the defrost setting, turning over a few times through.  It maintained the moisture and the flavor of the chicken.

Had to impress the in laws- some pretty picky eaters- and this recipe did the trick! Very flavorful, not too spicy and a crowd pleaser. Even my kids liked it. Worked well in the oven. 350 degrees for 1 hour. Thanks for a great recipe Beth!

I made this for company and everyone loved it; 2 asked for the recipe.  I adjusted the servings for 12 and baked it in the oven for an hour plus as the pieces were rather big.

Faux Jerk Chicken Haiku: "Love this marinade! Chicken bathed in it one day. Spicy jerk, yah mon!" This was great chicken; however, "Jay's Jerk Chicken" from AR is far superior in quality, but this recipe made up for that with its ease of preparation. Followed the recipe exactly, subbing jalapenos for the scotch bonnet and going a teensy bit heavier on the allspice. Leaving my chicken tenderloins marinating in it for a little over 24 hrs. resulted in a moist, flavorful hunk o' jerky poultry goodness.

Delicious, especially as a marinade for tofu (I don't eat meat). Why is is "faux" jerk though? Tastes exactly like the ones I had in Jamaica (except maybe missing ginger).

I love this recipe! It is one of my absolute favorites and I make it whenever I get a chance. Always juicy, tender and delicious.  I mix up all the ingredients and let the chicken marinate for about 24 hours. I substitute chili powder for the bonnet chili peppers because I can't get those at any of my local grocery stores; other than that, I make everything as directed.  As sides, I serve long grain wild rice and fried plantains (Alton Brown's "Good Eats" recipe).   I love love LOVE this meal!

This is an easy recipe to make and it was tasty. But it will not be added to my regular rotation. Only when I am looking for something different.

This is absolutely awesome!  The first time I made it for my daughter's birthday party, we used the oven.  It has an intense flavor and there were NO leftovers.  My friend made it on the grill.  It still had a good flavor but not as intense.

Marinated chicken strips for 2 days, and the flavor was great.  I had to sub 2 jalapenos for the scotch bonnet because I had them in the garden.

This recipe is wonderful!  Perfect flavoring and looks great too.  I have little kids and a husband who does like peppers so I tried the recipe without the Scotch Bonnent chile peppers, and didn't substitute anything in its place.  Still turned out super.  My kids gobbled this up and my husband told me to add it to my "make again" collection.

Interesting flavor! Brought it to a neighbor's cookout and everyone loved it, even the teenagers. I left out the chili pepper and I think next time I will be sure to include it - it wasn't spicy at all.

This chicken is incredible!!!  Loved it!  It was really, really good! I did not have a chile pepper, so added a little extra red pepper & some chile powder to give it a little kick.  Also did not have green onions, so minced up a little bit of a yellow onion.  This is my new favorite marinade!!!

I have picky eaters that are always worried about whether something is hot-spicy so I toned this down a bit by using 2 jalapeno peppers and added 2 Tbs of soy. They absolutely loved it.
Thanks again to allrecipes.com for another great recipe!

Made this delicious marinade and let stand overnight.   The next afternoon we ate the chicken on ciabatta bread as a Jerk Sandwich.  I even cooked it indoors on an electric grill due to rain.... Fantastic!

Wonderful, juicy, delicious, fabulous, sweet/spicy perfection!  Now that I'm out of adjectives LOL..... I use jalapenos instead of scotch bonnet/habanero.  I dice one, then remove seeds from a 2nd & put it in the marinade whole.  Freezes well, I make up a big batch of marinade & divide breasts in Ziploc freezer bags to marinate in the freezer for easy weeknight meals.  Just thaw in a sink of cold water when you get home from work (usually thaws in about an hour – just enough time to get the charcoal going & have an adult beverage)  Fabulous on pork tenderloin as well…we serve w/saffron rice & black beans. Thank you

This was very good! The only problem or suggesion I had with this one, was not enough sauce. I understand it was just marinated, and I marinated it over night, and opoked it with a fork, but still didn't really taste the marinate through the chicken, when cut. Here's my suggestion, take twio pieces of wax paper, put on bottom and top of raw chicken. Take a hammer or mallet, and hammer on top of waxed paper, between chicken to make skinner, so marinate can go through easier. Then cobtinue with poking your fork with chicken, after taking waxed paper off. Your chicken will be well marinated over night and ready to be fried and guests to eat. Otherwise I'd susgest some kind of sause with it. My brother and gf used hot sause. I prefer enchilda sauce with it. It had a good favor!I used ginger instead of the allspice, (since I had none), pepper for cajun poweder(also had none), and extra chili poweder. It still turned out good, with the few ingredient changes, but next time I think I'd like to try it with the original ingredients.But none the lest, this recipe is a keeper! Thanks!

Yum! I too had to substitute a different pepper for the scotch bonnet, but it was still really good. I thought the cinnamon flavor was maybe a little strong, I'll probably cut back on that if I make it again. Still, this was a hit with my boyfriend, and suited my tastes just fine--spicy, but not TOO spicy. Definitely a keeper!

This was very tasty. I too was not able to find scotch bonnet peppers, so I sued jalepenos. I think the chicken was lacking a little zip. perhaps the scotch Bonnet peppers would have helped there.  It was good but I think next time I'll add a dash of cayenne or tabasco to the marinade.

Fab! Great taste! I did not have the pepper it called for in this recipe so I used finely chopped jalepenos and it worked great. My husband is a beef guy and hates when I make chicken, but he loved this one and this is the first time I have ever seen him eat all of it! Thanks for the great recipe!

If you let this marinate too long it will start to look weird.  It will, however, taste FABULOOOUS.

really good, I didn't have the scotch bonnet peppers so I just added more cayenne which seemed to work.  I kept the marinade for dipping, I boiled it very well to be sure it was safe though.

This chicken was very moist and easy.  It wasn't quite as spicy as I would have liked, but a great, family friendly weeknight meal.

I made this last night and it surprised me how good it was, and so simple. I didn't have cayanne pepper or chilies so it wasn't spicy at all. But the flavor was still great. Also I added a capful of whisky which gave it a great hint of flavor. I used evaporated cane juice instead of white sugar, which made it less sweet. I wouldn't want it any sweeter than it already was. All in all a pretty great recipe.

I'm so glad I found this recipe.  It was very tasty.  I had a rotisserie chicken that I used (tasted great and saved time) and I couldn't find the scotch bonnet pepper so I used a jalapeno instead.  It was fabulous.  I served it over a hot baked sweet potato and the combination of flavors was incredible! Try it!

Yum! This was fabulous. I used my oven broiler rather than a grill but other than that, I didn't change a thing. I'm sure it would be even better grilled, though. Thanks Beth!

:  I’ve wanted to make this for a long time, but never had any luck finding scotch bonnet peppers.  This year, I decided to raise them in my garden.  I had my doubts about this after mixing up the marinade, but once I smelled the aroma coming from the grill, I knew it was going to be fabulous.  The chicken was juicy, not too spicy, and subtly sweet.

I love jerk chicken and have tried quite a few in my travels around the US. This jerk marinade didn't remind me of any of those jerk chicken I've eaten, but that was initially. After a day, the flavours intensified and the lime really came through. It was really nice. Still doesn't remind of the wonderful jerk chicken and ribs we had in Caribbean restaurants.

Good stuff!  I couldn't find a scotch bonnet pepper, so I just used a chili pepper. It was good! Came out pretty spicy...I'm not big on spicy, but my husband loved it.

Wow, that was really good.  Very easy to make.  Wasn't sure how I'd like it when I made the marinade, but the end product was very tasty.  Marinaded for about 5 hours.  Mine did end up pretty spicy, which we like.

Wonderful recipe. I didn't have the pepper, so I used chili powder instead. Also, no time to marinade. I used a pan with a lid and let the chicken cook in the marinade for about an hour. Removed the lid and let the juices evaporate so the chicken could brown just a bit. It was a hit! Can't wait to try this on pork and fish too.

This smelled great--even attracted four of my neighbors over for dinner! Good thing I had made extra! I think the cinnamon and allspice added a different twist and it sure smelled good cooking it! I didn't have time to track down a scotch bonnet pepper, so I used a jalepeno. This wasn't spicy at all, no leftovers here!

Came out wonderful. SO pleased. Some of my friends though it was a little spicy, but I thought it was great. Can't wait to make it again. And I baked it instead of grilled, it was still juicy.

WOW!! This was fantastic.  I searched for a chicken marinade at the last minute, so I did not have scotch bonnet peppers on hand.  I added a little extra cayenne, a dash of coarse ground black pepper and a dash of crushed red pepper to kick up the heat a little.  I can not wait to try this recipe exactly as written, I know it will be excellant.  We truly enjoyed this and will make it often.  I've already saved this to my recipe box!  I would have to say this recipe is in my top 5 from this website!  Thanks!!!

I guess this just wasn't to my tastes.  It was ok, but we ended up cutting up the chicken and using it in other things because we weren't crazy about the flavor.

I made this in the oven and cooked it in the marinade, so it didnt come out as good.  The nutmeg was too strong. I think on the grill is the best bet.

This is awesome!  I cooked it in the oven (bad weather) for about 40 min and it came out great.  I think the chicken should be pounded just a little and would make it more tender and juicy. I also kicked it up with a little red pepper and it worked nice with the sweetness of the marinade. Served scallop potatoes and steamed cauliflower with melted cheese!

Great, easy, delicious meal. A "different" chicken dish. the chicken had a little kick to it which we like. I let the chicken get a little chsrred on the grill. It added another dimension. A keeper

Very good.  I substituted jalepeno peppers because I had them on hand.  Still tasted great - I cooked the chicken on skewers with pineapple. Very tasty.
