I made some changes to this recipe and found a new way of making liver.  All of our boys went back for seconds.  Even the 2 that hate liver.  Here are the changes I made:  Put olive oil in large stew pot, chopped up 1 large sweet onion and sauteed till golden.  Added in 3 lbs of liver, paprika, salt and pepper.  When doing this to season to taste you must season to your taste.  I used quite a bit of paprika and pepper.  I also added in garlic powder since I make Beef Stroganoff quite often and I like the flavor it gives.  After I cooked it down I added 1 can of cream of chicken soup mix per pound of livers.  This thickened it up quite a bit too.  Just before serving I added 1 16oz container of fat free sour cream.  We had ours over rice.  I don't like cooking too much with wine or alcohol that is why I used the cream of chicken soup.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Once in awhile I make something I've never tried before.  I've never even had chicken livers, but this recipe was really great.  Will definitely try again.

This was a great recipe.  I made this for my boyfriend and his father and they both went back for seconds and thirds!  The sauce was excellent, worthy of a restaurant menu!

Fantastic!!!!!  I thought 1 tablespoon of paprika sounded like a lot but it wasn't.  My husband says this recipe is a keeper!  Works well with the turbo cooker, just use less oil.

I thought this was great.  I used seasoned salt with the black pepper and paprika and thought the seasoning was fine for our tastes.  The consistency was fine for me too (a concern in earlier reviews), but if you like a thicker "stick-together" sauce, you could easily thicken it a bit by sprinkling a little flour before adding the wine & sour cream.  I love chicken livers but I think this would be equally good with other meats of your choice.  Something different and a keeper.  Thanks!

Very definitely a keeper!! My family have hearty appetites and chicken livers are a favorite dish, so I doubled the liver, onions, noodles and mushrooms. Increased the wine to 1/2 C & sour cream to 16 oz. Doubled the sweet paprika, added 2 tsp garlic powder as another person suggested and 1/2 tsp sharp paprika. I will increase the sweet paprika by another 1/2 - 1 T next time. We all loved it and I would rate it 4.5 if that were possible. The dog would rate it zero; he usually has plates to lick - not tonight, nothing left!

Wow! My husband  and I occasionally eat chicken livers, and this recipe is restursnt quality. It is very rich, and with the wine and sour crean,the flavor is wonderful. I made it tonight and served it over noodles, as directed in the recipe,but maybe next time will serve it over rice to mop up all that good gravy.Husband really enjoyed it.

Husband and I thought this dish was OK (we're big fans of chicken livers).  Need to perk it up with a few more spices...I used a couple of pinches of oregano but will try something different next time.  It was quick, easy and the sherry made it have a unique taste.

This is delicious!  The only changes I made was after adding the liver I turned the heat to low and covered the pan to cook the liver slowly.  Then I added a little flour mixed with water to slightly thicken it before adding the sherry & sour cream.  I will be making this again!

My mom made this when my sister and I were growing up, only she used chicken hearts. Sounds wrong, but it's extremely filling and incredibly comforting. I like it best over mashed potatoes. TIP: If you don't have sherry, use beef or chicken broth/stock. Whichever you have on hand.

My husband had never had ckn livers before.  He thought it was really good. My son and I also thought it was "tasty", but we all just have a hard time getting past the texture of liver. Probably won't make this again.

I love chicken livers, but didn't like this recipe.  It had too much sherry (too sweet) and the sauce was too watery with all those onions.  I was very disappointed.  I think it needed double the paprika, also, as I could not even taste it.

Not only is this a delicious recipe as is, but the leftovers make a wonderful breakfast.  I sauteed some additional onion and mushrooms in  a little butter.  Cut up the leftover livers and added all to a scrambled egg. Yummy high protein way to start the day!

great dish!  really enjoyed this 'twist' on chicken livers - the sherry and sour cream give it a really tangy flavour.  tastes even better next day.  will definitely be making this again. :)

Had left over livers from a terrine and wanted to use them so I found this recipe. Bland flavour and awful texture.

I made this recipe  as written and we loved it. My only change was using dry vermouth instead of dry sherry.  And adding two cloves of Grated garlic. Delish!

This was a nice change from the way I normally cook chicken livers.  I used a sweet onion and quartered about 8 oz. of crimini mushrooms.  I was very liberal in my use of black pepper and replaced the regular sour cream with the light version.  This one I will make again.

My wife, who did not like chicken livers till she had my rendition of my mother's recipe as "comfort food" the first time I fixed dinner for her, declared this recipe " that's good."  The next time I do it, I will use criminis rather than white button mushrooms.  That is the only thing I will change.  I'll let you know how that turns out.

I did not care for this.  The sherry and sour cream together did not taste good.  If I could give it less than 1 star I would have.
