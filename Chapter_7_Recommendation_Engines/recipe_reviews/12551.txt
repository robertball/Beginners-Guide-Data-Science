I am a very good pie baker and I rate this recipe very highly.  I bake pies at Christmas for other people and this is the coconut pie recipe I use every time.  The only thing I change is I make all cream pie recipes in the microwave ( cooking the pudding part) - so much easier and they turn out perfect every time!

This is absolutely the BEST coconut pie I have ever had... I don't do meringue pies because I can't do the meringue, but this one is easy and great!  Takes a little time, but it is well worth it!!!

Very easy. One modification instead of just 5 cups of half and half, I used 15oz, of coconut milk and then rest half and half. Everyone loved the creaminess of it. Have given the reciepe out to all my friends.

I made this for Thanksgiving and both the pies were gone before I even got a slice! I had to make it again for my kids and so I could try it a few days later and this has to be the best pie I have ever had! My family asked me to make it again for Christmas!

Fantastic and easy to make!  Will definitely make again.  Did put 1 C of coconut in the pie, recipe only calls for 1/4 C but the ingredients would only add up to 1/2 C instead of the 1 1/4 C on the ingredients list.

Fabulous pie!  I also used coconut milk (about 15oz) in place of some of the cream.  It turned out great.  Will definitely make this one again.

To make this lowfat, I substitued NONFAT condensed milk for the cream, 2 mashed bananas (blended)for the butter, and used 1/2 splenda & 1/2 regular sugar. It's very sweet; next time I'll cut the sugar back; also used fresh coconut instead of packaged (no sugar)! and added peach brandy instead of vanilla (a little more generous than 1 tsp.)...very good! I rated this 4 stars because it's a lot of work!!

I did not like this recipe at all. I made it for Easter and it didn't have enough flavor. I probably will never make it again.

I rated this pie full marks for all catagories.  I have just finished making this pie and have chosen this particular recipe for my dear son.  He is a two year cancer survivor and is visiting me for Thanksgiving which is Canada is celebrated this week-end.  He will be delighted with this choice!  Thank you Holly!

I made only one pie. It was so good. This is my husbands favorite pie. Halved everything, except I used 2 eggs and 5 egg whites. Will certainly make again.

Excellent Coconut Pie! We loved it. Creamy and lighter in texture than most that we have tried. I only needed one pie. I adjusted the servings to 8 and it worked out great. I decided to add half of the coconut to the pie and half on top. This recipe is a little time consuming but worth it. Thanks for sharing!

I wasn't happy with this recipe at all, and my husband who is NOT ONE BIT PICKY, did NOT LIKE IT!!  Perhaps I did a few things wrong.  For instance, I used a condensed can of "Cream of Coconut" so it wasn't exactly the coconut MILK.  I also didn't like how the recipe was for a double pie and not as easy to cut into one pie.  But, my hats off to all who have made this a tried and true recipe!

Not the best pie. I make coconut pies all the time and stick with the  original Betty Crocker . Makes to much filling and it has a weak flavor to the pie. Sorry not good

Made this for Thanksgiving & it was a hit! The custard is not overly sweet but is creamy and delicious, plus it looks very nice! I added extra coconut and still feel like it needed more but everyone else thought it was perfect as is. My bf is eating leftovers now and said I need to start making it once a month...even if I just made the custard part and store in ramekins. It is really THAT good.

Bit tricky to get this to set up properly. It was very good but I thought the filling needed a bit of sugar so only 4 stars.

Most delicious pie ever! I don't usually like coconut, but this pie was out of this world..
