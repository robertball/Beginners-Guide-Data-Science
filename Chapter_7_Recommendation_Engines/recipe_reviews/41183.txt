Well, I hate being the first to review a recipe, especially when it's going to be a bad one. Sorry, but this was a complete waste of my beloved tomatillos. The seasoning in the cornmeal dominated the tom's, and clashed with them. I'm going to try again but just dredge them in flour and s&p. Thanks anyway.

I used flour, just like fried green tomatoes. They were GREAT!!  I made them for our super bowel party & everyone LOVED them!  They went fast!

I made these as my green tomatoes were not ready yet to harvest... I soaked them in buttermilk and dipped in Kentucky Kernal seasoned flour ( by Hodgens Mills) they turned out great...A great substitute in winter when green tomatoes are not available

I followed other reviewer's suggestions and used flour. They were actually pretty good. Made a pepper jelly-lime sauce for dipping, which really, REALLY helped them out.

Pretty good for our first tomatillo experiment. We used flour as we were out of cornmeal. Will make again!

I recently discovered these little jewels in the grocery store so decided to buy a few. Had no clue what to make with them so turned to AR. I found this recipe and read the reviews. I followed the reviews advice using egg, flour and lots of fresh ground pepper. Fried them until golden and served with scrambled eggs and toast for breakfast! Delicious!! Added more to grocery list!!

I tried the recipe as written and agree with other reviewers.  The cornmeal is overpowering.  I did the second batch with buttermilk in lieu of the egg whites and mixed the seasoning with flour.  Was very good!

Very tasty with a change or two.  Used the whole egg and flour instead of cornmeal.  Used butter (why not??) and topped with jalapeno jelly.  The trick is to fry them crispy not mushy.

I made mine just like I would fried green tomatoes. Tasted great, especially in the winter time.
