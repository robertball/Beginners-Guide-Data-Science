I read EVERY single review of this recipe before I made it b/c I was skeptical of using ketchup with apples.  I should have followed my instinct.  No one would even touch the apples and we had to use bbq sauce to cover the pork chops.  Save your ingredients for something else b/c if you think it looks bad, it tastes worse.

Extremely flavorful and juicy.  Added sauted onion, deleted ketchup, and sprinkled cinnamon and brown sugar over apples. Will make again.

I liked this recipe.  I didn't find it too sweet but that might be becuase I served it over rice with steamed vegetables so there was a good balance.  My one gripe would be that I followed the advice of others and seared the meat first which I found, after baking for 45 minutes left my chops a little on the dry side.  Next time, I'll probably just stick to recipe directions and not fry ahead of time.  Also the suggestion to bake the chops and apples over a bed of onions was a good idea and really added to the flavor of the dish!

the ketchup will ruin this recipe! so we didn't use it. add sliced onions to this recipe. (the bed of onions was a good tip!) I layered all in a pan starting with onions in the bottom of the pan spread evenly, pork chops next with salt and pepper sprinkle, then the apples, a little cinnamon and the brown sugar. they were moist and delicious. i would make this again for company.

Ohmygoodness.. GOOD!  I read the suggestions from the others.  I decided on this:  I peppered chops and layed them on a bed of onions.  Cut up some apples and put them on.  Sprinkled w brown sugar and drizzled with reg bbq sauce.  350 in oven until done.  It was pretty, chops were tender, my apples were perfect, taste was wonderful.  This, indeed, will be a regular in my house.  Many thanks.  (even better the next day!)

I made tis for my family last night.Everyone loved it. I found that the apples released a great deal of juice. After the chops were done I removed them fom the pan and kept them warm while I reduced the pan juices and added a bit of butter, maybe 2 tablespoon, to add richness.  Made a great sauce.  Thank you.  I will use often.

The pork chops turned out tough and dry and the ketchup dried on the apples and it didn't look very appetizing. I won't be making this again.

i'm not a huge pork fan because I always find it too dry or tough. This one was delicious!  Super moist and tender.  I did change one thing though, I put mine in the slow cooker and added a little bit of apple juice and water for liquid.  Turned out great!  I don't care for the apples myself but the meat was wonderful.

Absolutely the best pork chops I have ever eaten.

I cooked this yesterday for myself and my mom. I followed the instructions as written and even took the advice from another review about using red onion to line the bottom of the pan.

Let me tell you, it was absolutely delish with the red onion and using a Red Delicious Apple.

For others, I would recommend using a sweet red apple like Red Delicious and not a tart green. Gives the food sweet, but not too sweet flavor. And do use the ketchup. I did and think that if the ketchup wasn't there it would take away from the flavor.

Good, my husband liked it.  I used the suggestion of layering onions at the bottom of the pan. I did not pour the ketchup over the pork chops. Instead, I mixed ketchup, brown sugar and some apple cider, and a little browning sauce over the pork chops to cook.  Once the chops were done, I took the juices, added a little butter in a pan to make a sauce.

If you are expecting your traditional baked apples and pork chops this isn't it. It is sweet but the ketchup also gives it a tangy twist. I had prepared it for the oven in a casserole dish but had to transfer the meal to a dutch oven for the stove top when my oven quit on me. I added a few onion slices and sliced up a carrot for color. Also, I put a little water in the pan to keep the pork chops moist. The end result was delicious. I will make this again in the oven when I get the chance.

Well, it doesn't look pretty, but it tastes great.  I cut a pork loin up into pieces, then put it on a bed of apples.  ( I didn't have onions) I also used a little less brown sugar than it called for.  The pork was unbelievably juicy and delicious.  Would definitely make again!

Great recipe.  And very easy.  I added a bit more ketchup and brown sugar, only because my fiance and I both like sauces.  The tangy ketchup and sweet apple made a perfect combination for the sauce.  This recipe is a keeper!

It was ok. We weren't a big fan of the apples with ketchup, but the chops were pretty good.

I found this recipe on this site a few years ago and it is a staple in our house now. SO EASY! And the pork turns out so moist! I use boneless chops though and it never takes more than 30 minutes.

we tweaked it a bit.
I emailed this recipe to my husband to get started before I left work.
He took the recipe, eyeballed all the ingredients instead of measuring and used Jack Daniels BBQ sauce instead of ketchup.  He reduced the amt of sauce to just a simple glaze, and cut apples in 1/8th's instead of thin slices.  He servied it and it was AMAZING.  Flavors were great, the bbq roasted apples were VERY flavorful and fun. the boneless thick pork chops were SUPER juicy and perfectly done.  cooked for about 40 min I think - our oven isn't the greatest - might take less time for you.  Served w/ brown rice and green beans.  Will be a staple in our home for making pork chops.

I loved this I took some of the reviews and added a bed of onions. I also put the ketchup mix under the apples so it wasn't ugly looking. This would be great with some mashed potatoes I loved it so did my husband we will have this again.

This was a pretty good recipe and the pork chops came out very juicy.  I will make this again, and test it out on the hubby, who is a huge pork fan, but probably wont like the apples.  We shall see.  I did not change anything and I won't change anything when I make it again.

This has become my signature dish...served with baked sweet potatoes and cooked kale!  The pork chops bake up moist; the brown sugar and apples complement the pork as well as the potatoes and kale.  Add a touch of apple cider vinegar to the kale as it cooks down.  Smother it with the pork chop/apple juice.  Delicious!!

VERY YUMMY! Just don't look at it before you put it in the oven! I put a little butter under the porkchop and a little on top. Very juicy and tasty. My husband said it didn't taste like ketchup, more like barbecue sauce. Definitely a keeper.

I put thinly sliced onions on the bottom like some recommended.  I also reduced everything on the stove for about 5 minutes after the chops were done. I picked out most of the onions after reducing and it was a huge hit.  My neighbor kid enjoyed it immensely.

Great pork recipe for non-pork lovers!  The apples actually provided a side dish, as I chopped a Red Delicious and an Empire into larger pieces...that let them retain their density and the sauce provided great flavoring.  I used boneless pork chops and laid them on the chopped onion bed; they were the juiciest chops I've ever had!  As for the apples, I combined a little more ketchup (maybe 1/2 -3/4 cup), added the brown sugar, and about a tablespoon of mustard for bite (any extra can be used for dipping, as my 3 year old loves dipping everything in something!)  I tossed the apples in, coated them, then put them on top of the chops, covered the dish in foil and baked for 45 minutes.  
The non-pork person in my family is now requesting I add this to the rotation!

The pork chops turned out very tender and the apples were really good...I could only give it 4 stars because, like some of the others said, it just doesn't look very good.

Overall, this was a nice change.  The next time though, I will brown the chops first and saute a few onions.  I added a small amount of ground cloves on the apples before adding the ketchup. The chops were juicy and tender, but a little "pale" for our likings.  Will do again with minor changes.

this recipe was very good, I did take the advice from another review and reduce the sauce on the stove top a little after cooking. I also added just a little extra brown sugar at this time. This is definetly a recipe that I will make again!!! :)

This was pretty good and it was very juicy. I would have liked it to have a little more flavor. I will make it again but will follow some of the other reviewers suggestions (like adding onion).

Very yummy and very easy to make.  It is also likely that most people will already have the ingredients on hand.

This was a good recipe.  My family really enjoyed it...the kids especially liked getting apple in every bite of chop.  I served it with rice and mixed veggies.  About half way through baking I brushed the chops with the juice in the pan.  Will definately make this one again.  Thanks!

This would be a 5 star, but I have to say, it was SO ugly!  It tasted great, though.  My 13 yr old daughter actually stole 1/2 of my husband's dinner that I left for him because he worked late.  I'd make them again, but maybe I'll put the ketchup UNDER the apples instead of on top.  I also added some butter to mine because there was very little fat on my chops.

Soooo GOOOD!! i made it with everything in the recipe and just eyeballed all the ingredients. Prefect, so good my boyfriend got seconds(which is very rare). I served it with mashed potatoes and a asparagus medley. Next time I would just cook it for 5 mins less, i always tend to buy smaller pork chops. It wasn't dry but it could've went a few mins less than 35 in my case.

turned out very dry and bland. if i did it again i would probably add more garlic powder, maybe onion powder and cinnamon. i avoided the ketchup because it sounded downright scary. i don't think i will be doing this one again

also read reviews before I tried this dish. I deleted ketchup-added sauted onions, brown sugar and cinnamon. Very good this way and very moist.

For ease of preparation, 5; for flavor, 4; for presentation, 3, but since I subbed a partial can of diced tomatoes for the ketchup, I'll round up, as it were, to 4 stars. Like another cook, I used a slow cooker for this one. Served with broccoli, rice, and green salad. It was a quick and easy meal to do ahead for Sunday dinner. I submitted a photo of what our (thick cut) chops looked like once plated.

Yummy recipe.  I followed some reviewers suggestions and made a couple of changes.  I  browned the pork chops and put them on a bed of thinly sliced onions but otherwise followed the directions. When it was done, I put the juices, apples & onion in a sauce pan and recuced for a few minutes.  I will definitly make this again

This was a nice change from regular pork chops, but I found that it was a bit too sweet with all the apples and the brown sugar.  A nice diversion though, and one that I might try again.

These were pretty good - my husband gives them three stars for taste, but since they were so easy to prepare I'm giving them a four.  I'd probably put a little more brown sugar than it calls for.

My husband, who loves pork chops, agreed this was a "keeper".  Easy to put together, and the chops had a delightful flavor, and were very juicy and flavorful.  We had it for New Year's dinner and it was a great way to start 2001!  Thank you.  Muffinlady
