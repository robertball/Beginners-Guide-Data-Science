These are really cool looking and pretty good tasting. My suggestions are to add more water to the Strawberry Jello. So, they will have the texture of a frozen pop instead of frozen Gel and also add the choc. chips to Strawberry Jello BEFORE you put it in the freezer and to make sure you FREEZE the cool whip/cream chz mixture BEFORE you add the Lime Jello. Because, if you dont you will have floaties at the base of the popcicle.

Wow, these are delicious and easy to make. The creamy middle filling is really good and makes these extra special! The only slight change I made was instead of cool whip, I made homemade whip cream because I was out of cool whip and I didn't want to run to the store.

I've now had to make these almost EVERY WEEKEND since Memorial Day when I first tried this recipe!  Arrrgg!  Now my 78 year father-in-law bugs my hubby when there are no watermelon pops in the freezer! Go figure!  To those that had difficulty with "floating", try again.  Making anything with Jello is not art, it is SCIENCE!  A few tips to make it a QUICK and EASY dessert.  Put three bowls out with 1/3 cup sugar in each.  Have 2 measuring cups with 1/2 c. each cold water ready.  To Bowl A: add strawberry jello.  To Bowl B: add lime jello.  To Bowl C: add cream cheese.  Bowl A & B - add boiling water and stir until dissolved. Put three ice cubes into each measuring cup of cold water. Add ice water to Bowl A & B. Stir until ice is melted.  Stick Bowl B in FREEZER.  Have eight, 6 oz Dora the Explorer paper cups ready! (Hubby thinks they're too cute). Now, add 1/8 cup red jello (Bowl A) to each cup.  You might have to level a little between the cups.  Stick in freezer for at least 20 minutes. Pull cups out.  Pull green jello out, stir and put in FRIDGE.  Mix choco chips into red jello with plastic spoon. Mix up the sugar and cheese in Bowl C. and fold in whipped topping.  Add couple of tablespoons of cheese mixture to each cup.  Turn the cup as you push down the cheese with a small plastic spoon. This will make a tight and even layer.  Put spoons in each. Grab green jello and finish off the pops.  With 6 oz. cups, this will take a minimum of 5 hours to freeze.  15 min to assmbl.

These were so easy to make and very refreshing.  I made them for Memorial Day and they were enjoyed by adults as well as kids.  I used plastic cups because I did not have paper cups and it worked fine.  When taking out of the freezer to serve, roll these between your hands and push up on the bottom of the cup and they slide right out.  I wish these recipes would tell you how much of everything to put in the cups so here is what I did.  I used approximately 2 and a half Tbsp. of red jello mix in the bottom of the cups.  I put them in the freezer for 10 minutes and then stirred in the chocolate chips.  I then used approximately 2 Tbsp. of the cream cheese cool whip mix and used a teaspoon to spread it in the cups.  I then used 2 and a half Tbsp. of the green jello and they turned out great.

These were a huge hit with my family!  I read the reviews before making them, so I tried both ways with the choc. chips.  I did some putting the chips in the strawberry jello before freezing (all the chips sink to the bottom of the cup, so they will be in the top of the pop.)  The rest I made according to the recipe - putting the choc. chips in after freezing the strawberry layer.  I prefer this method - but I did stir the chips in and then used a bamboo skewer to move them around and push them toward the outside of the cup.  If you put them in during this step, they will be in different levels of the strawberry jello.  To avoid "floaties", be sure to make the lime jello first, and make sure it has slightly congealed (not pourable, but has to be spooned on top) before putting it on top of the cream cheese layer.  This way, the cream cheese cannot "float" into that layer.  The kids and adults alike loved the taste, and I'm making them again for our cookout tomorrow!

These were great - sugar free jello will also work and is great for kids.  I thought the chocolate chips were really good in them.  For 4th of July, we plan on making these again with Berry Blue Jello and White Chocolate Chips as the stars! Great recipe!

Just made these tonight for a party tomorrow.  Really wish I had read the other reviews.  The recipe is poorly written.  I had to guess how much of each layer ingredient to add to the cups.  My suggestions:  Mix up the strawberry layer first.  Freeze the pops after adding the whipped cream, before adding lime layer.  I will update tomorrow on taste.   Update: These are really refreshing on a hot afternoon.  I'm going to make these again soon!

Those are very easy and fast to make.I've made them both as pops and as a cake.You must be very carefull one layer has set before pouring the other on top of it.I didn't quite like the taste of frozed jell-o but loved the middle cream cheese layer.Friends and family loved the whole thing.And the look of it is really great!

Didn't love this but kids and Hubby thought they were great.  Fiddly to make with having to freeze each layer and pipe the cream cheese layer into the pop. I didn't add the sugar to the jelly and used whipped cream instead of whipped topping (added the sugar to that instead).

I made these for my son's birthday party. I followed the directions to a "T".  They turned out okay, but the biggest problem that I had was getting them out of the cups for the kids.  It became way too messy.  Probably won't be making these again.

I guess I didn't take enough time to let every layer set.  But, I followed the directions to a T and they didn't turn out at all.  I'm not sure why it says to make the lime jello first when it's the last one you add.  I did use a ziploc baggie like a icing bag, so it made putting the cream cheese layer in easier.  But, all of my cream cheese mixture floated to the top when I added the lime jello.  I'm not sure I would try to make these again.

These were a big hit with the kids at our last bar b que.  This was a cute dessert and definitely different.  Kept them cool and coming back for more.  A bit of an odd consistency, not sure the adults liked it much, but the kids were happy!

These are delicious! The Jello makes them no-drip, an added bonus. The creamy white layer is similar to cheesecake and the flavors really go well together. They are somewhat complicated to make, but used another reviewer's idea to simplify. Will be making these again and again!

Cute idea, but not as easy as they sound.  The chocolate chips simply dropped to the bottom (I don't have time and/or desire to babysit the pops to add the chips at "just the right time!")  I think I used too large of paper cups, since I didn't get the thicker looking layers as in the photo, or as many pops as the recipe states.  However, the kids did like them and they were all eaten up!

This is a fun summer desset.  My kids enjoyed making it.  It looks great.  The gelatin makes it melt slower than a regular popsicle.  Just make sure you have the time to allow everything to set before rushing on to the next step.

These were really cute!  I froze inbetween layers which caused problems when removing the popsicles from the molds.  The red layer did not touch the stick so it almost always broke off in the mold, that is when I managed to get them off on the stick and it didn't just rip out!.  I think I will try adding more water next time though...too JELLO-y for us.

I was disappointed by this recipe. I used a plastic bag with the corner cut off to add the cream layer which made it very easy and I thought the cream layer was yummy but I really disliked the texture of the jello layers. The flavor was fine (it tasted like jello) but it was rubbery and chewy. If I tried it again I would definitely use more water or maybe just use similarly colored koolaid or fruit juice. I also think that it would have been better off without the chocolate chips. It was hard to get them where you want them without them sinking to the bottom or getting stuck at the top and they didn't affect the taste or appearance of the final product enough to make it worth the effort. That being said my son loved them and I made them for him so that's what was important

This recipe was such an annoyance! By the time I was done with it I was sick of it! The freeze times that the recipe states are much too short. Add 1 hour to each stage of pouring, I'd say. I give it 2 stars and not 1 because it actually tastes really good though!

I wish I would have realized or read the feedback that stated the coolwhip should be frozen before adding the lime layer. Mine floated to the top, and of course they're for an event tomorrow. booo.

Tastes great, don't get me wrong. Of course Jell-O and cream cheese tastes good. But I'm not reviewing this based on the flavor. It's been 5.5 hours and maybe 20% of the entire popsicle is frozen. The rest is stiff Jell-O. Not even the cream cheese is freezing right. I let one popsicle sit in hot water for 5 minutes and the red jell-o still fell off in the cup. I used plastic cups too, thinking the Jell-o should slide right out. Nope. Too much work for something so hit-and-miss. Now I'm eating half-frozen Jell-O in a cup with a spoon.

I didn't think the taste and texture were that great, but the children loved them, so I may make them again.  The pops are SO cute.  They'd be great to make for a children's party.  One thing I found was that they look better if you press the chocolate chip "seeds" far to the bottom and outer edges of the pop.  You will want those to show in the finished product.

Disappointing. I followed the directions exactly. The first thing I don't understand is that the recipe tells you to make the lime first even though it is added last. Secondly, even though I decided to freeze the cream cheese mixture before adding the lime on top, I still got floaties. Thirdly, after I served it, my husband said the jello portion was pretty bad. The cream cheese part was alright. I will not make this again.

I don't think I'll make this again.  I followed the directions and even took some advice from others to freeze each layer before adding the next.  After 6 hours in the freezer, they were still soft.  The kids had to eat them in a bowl. The flavor was yummy though.

Cute idea but not worth it. First, you need to make sure your strawberry jello is set enough to add the chips so they don't all sink but more importantly, so your whipped cream mixture will not sink. Make sure the whipped cream is spread even across the red before adding the green. If any of the whipped cream mixture is exposed when you freeze it, it will have that yucky rubbery texture. You also need to make sure that you wipe the cup clean after the cream mixture or else it'll look sloppy. Perhaps it was me but only a few of the cups came out right. I won't make it again but kudos to those of you who made it work!

I don’t know how anyone was able to get these to stay together and come out in one piece. I had to serve them on a plate with a spoon.  Be sure to add your popsicle stick in the first strawberry layer, not the white Cool Whip layer or lime layer.  They were unattractive and the texture was very strange-like hard slime. The kids didn’t seem to mind though, but I will not be making these again. I waited a full day before adding each layer to make sure that the layers were completely frozen, and I still got white floaties at the base of my pops. The Cool Whip/cream cheese mixture was very good though, and I will use it in the future with fresh berries or something.

I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese and fat free Cool Whip. Still tastes great. Do need to freeze cream middle in cup before adding green mixture. Good recipe for the kiddies to have fun with.

I just put these in a muffin tin instead of cups. To make it healthier, I cut out the sugar, and used vanilla yogurt instead of the cream cheese mixture. We still thought they were great!

Made these over the Memorial Day weekend, big hit, more with the adults than the kids.  I made some with choc chips and some without. I think it was better off without them.  I followed the advice of previous reviewers and froze the whip cream layer for a few minutes before adding the lime layer and did use a ziploc baggie to squeeze it in there even though I still had to use a spoon to push it down to layer it evenly.  Overall, everyone was very impressed. Would defly do again, prob red, white and blue for the 4th!

My kids absolutely love these!  I took the time to let each layer thicken up before adding the next one and they turned out great.  It takes longer than I thought it would to spread the cream layer (especially when doubling the recipe) but it is worth it.

Awesome!

Followed the suggestions of the other people, and added more water for a more popsicle frozen texture for the jello bits.

The taste is great, they look cute, my only complaint is that the chocochips fall to the bottom, so I would recommend letting it freeze a bit in hopes of thickening some before dropping the chocolate chips in.

I also froze the strawberry jello for an hour before adding the whipped topping mixture which i also froze to solidify it some.

I was able to add the lime jello at room temperature after on top, and froze it overnight.

I used plastic cups and just cut through them to release the popsicle at the end, which made for easy clean up.

I've made these twice now and they were a big hit with everyone who tried them! I left out the mini chocolate chips (my BF won't eat chocolate). And for the 4th of July I made them using cherry jello for the first layer, kept the middle layer as directed, and topped them off with berry blue jello. We got 18 3oz pops, and had almost twice what we needed for the middle layer, so we just made more pops using other flavors of jello I had on hand (and only using 2 layers instead of three on the "extra" ones.. Some of the key points for us was to make the first layer of jello and place the pops in the freezer for about 45 minutes before making the middle layer, adding it right away & immediately adding the stick handles at the same time as the second layer. BTW, a ziplock bag with the corner cut off as a makeshift pastry bag was a marvelous way to add the second layer neatly and evenly to each pop! Thanks to the reviewers who suggested that! Place the pops back in the freezer, prepare the third & final layer of jello, but put it in the FRIDGE to gel for about 30 minutes before spooning it onto the pops. We had no problems with "floaties" as other reviewers mentioned. I know all this sounds complicated, but it really isn't... And the pops are well worth the effort it takes time-wise. The easiest way to get the pops out of the cups is first, make sure they are fully frozen, then warm them in your hand for a couple of minutes & push up from the bottom of the cup. Wonderful!

Flavor was good but I made the mistake of not making these in Dixie cups lined with wax- I used regular Popsicle molds and I had to use a fork to get it out. The middle was a bit too rich. Pretty good though, I'll try again.

This was definitely a hit with the kids!   It is time consuming but worth it when you see the look on the little faces.  Next time I make I will make only about 1/3 of the cream cheese/whipped cream layer. It's just not necessary.  Thinking I will try red white blue for Fourth of July. An

Everyone loved the watermelon pops. I had a PTO party at my house and even the adults loved how they looked and tasted. I follow the directions but my first layer was frozen to quick for my chips to sink. I had to push them down into the jello before I added the next layer. I think I will check them at about 10 or 15 minutes.I used a medium size scoop for the white layer and that worked perfect! I didn't have any of the mixture where I didn't want it. I taped the cups to make sure that there weren't any gaps between the two layers. By the time I finished my white layer my green was starting to set, but it still worked out fine. My daughter said she would like it better without the chocolate chips but my son loved the chocolate.

the first thing i noticed is that when i went to stir in the chocolate chips the red jello was too firm. also it took a lot longer han 3 hours for the pops to set up enough to take the paper cups off. otherwise, the poops turned out great they ent over extremely well at my church memorial day party!
