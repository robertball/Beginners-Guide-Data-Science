was really good. I used chicken thighs and cooked them for about 1 and 1/2 hours. I did add a 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger. My 9 year old came in the kitchen about once every 20 minutes to tell me how good it smelled and to ask if it was ready. And, my 7 year old said he had gone to chicken heaven.

Was Delicious. Couldn't find the chili paste, so I used a little red curry paste and it was still awesome. I cooked chicken thighs also. Everyone wanted seconds! Thank you.

Have made this several times, always using duck and of course saving the fat for other delicious recipes (Brussels sprouts) by Chef John. This is so yummy it defies description. And as the chef said in his video, the just sauce alone over rice is gorgeous.

ok, so this was absolutely fantastic adobo.  as good as anything i have had at my phillipino  friends.  i used chicken legs, and whole black peppercorns as opposed to ground, per my friends instructions.  be sure to be generous with the vinegar, bay leaf, and fish sauce.  i know that the fish sauce may be somewhat of an acquired taste for many americans, but trust me, it adds a funky goodness that cannot be replicated with anything else.  be sure to remove bay leaf before serving, you don't want any lawsuits from your guests, hahaha!  i serve my adobo with pancit (a phillipino rice noodle dish) white rice, and babinka (A jelled coconut rice dish) for dessert.  YUMMY!!

Substituted Specklebelly Goose thighs/legs with skin on. Only 3/4 cup seasoned rice vinegar and a little more garlic. Added a can of sliced water chestnuts and a small bag of stemmed pea pods about the last 15 minutes. This was AWSOME!!!

I loved this!  I was worried about the vinegar and some of the comments about being too sour and so I decided to only use half the recommended amount and was satisfied with the results.  I didn't have duck and it was a different way to use up the remaining chicken thighs I had.  

If you decide to use the parchment paper idea, which I did, watch carefully as I nearly evaporated all the liquid.  And remember as a sauce reduces it will get more salty.  Easy on the salt in the beginning.

Excellent interpretation of this dish.  Keeping in mind , different parts of the Phillipines do this a bit differently.  It is meant to be a simple country dish.  You share this with family and friends, adjust to your liking.  Add a bit of this or that.  This is what Mom or Grandma  makes.   Very nice, Chef.    Keep up the good work.

Made this with chicken thighs, instead of duck. Very tasty! Actual cooking time with chicken was 1.5 hours, compared with  duck, 2 hours. Grownups, teenagers, and littles all enjoyed.

I had to cook for the crew on a tall ship when I tried making this dish for the first time. It was a big hit. I still take it out when I want to impress, or just whenever I'm craving it.

Used wild mallard sides (deboned except wing and leg bones). I didn't have garlic, so used garlic powder, would be even better with garlic. I didn't simmer it very long and was good. If I had time to let it simmer for the recommended length it would have been even more tender.

I added oyster sauce and cloves to the recipe. Everyone like it a lot even though it was saltier than expected. Guess I'll add less oyster sauce  next time.

the only change I made was that I used skin bone in thighs. I followed the sauce recipe exact. It was ok, I would recommend using a low sodium soy sauce, the sauce was pretty salty and the only salt I added was on the chicken prior to cooking.  I served this with white rice, collards, sweet yams and homemade sweet potato biscuits. Honestly the flavors blended nicely together, and I was a delicious dinner. Don't know that I would ever make this again, but it wasn't bad.

Very good! We did put a little less vinegar in as we didn't have a whole cup on hand. 

I'll try it with chicken next time, a little less chilli paste and substitute the soy with some ketjap manis. It is sure to become a staple!

I found it a bit  too sour and my wife found it a bit too sweet.  Still excellent over-all.  I think my only real problem was starting with a pan that was too small.  I wish they would list skillet size like they do pot size for recipes. (that's why I left off a star)  Thanks for the trip Chef John!
