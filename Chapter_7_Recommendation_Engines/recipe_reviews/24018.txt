This was really a good recipe.  Probably the best basic sourdough recipe I have tried.  And I have tried quite a few.  At first I hesitated on the amount of yeast, but I have made this twice now and it has turned out great both times.  First time I did use the baking stone and the second time I just used a regular baking sheet.  I think I liked the shiny baking sheet better.  Also, I reduced the temp to 400 degrees the second time and liked the results better.

I did not use a bread machine (don't have one) and  I only used 1 c. of starter.  I thought it might be too sour.  But now I wish I would've used the whole amount! I think it depends on how sour your starter really is.  The starter I used was the "No Commercial Yeast" starter.  Next time I'll try making this bread with my wild grape starter since it is more sour.

I've just found my signature sourdough recipe! I can see why it won an award 3 years in a row. The best response came from my husband who said "Now this looks & tastes like professional bread"!

I can't believe *I* made this! This recipe gives you one amazing loaf - w/ a thick, flavorful crust outside and a light, fluffy bread tucked away inside. Although I used a young starter (only 5 days old), I got a distinct sourdough flavor for my effort. My only deviations from the recipe as written were to (1) break the dough up into 2 loaves & bake in loaf pans for 30 minutes each @ 375 and (2) I brushed olive oil over the tops & sprinkled w/ diced onion. This recipe will be around for a long time - can't wait to try it once my starter is even further established.

This produced a fragrant, tangy, loaf of bread that is soft inside with a nice crust. My Mom & I just sampled a piece, and it is wonderful. Very simple recipe; I like the addition of milk, butter, and the wheat germ. I cut back by 1 teaspoon on the salt, otherwise ingredients were perfect. I will make this again; Warren, thanks for sharing!

Great recipe. We've learned to make the slashes in the top very deep as the crust tends to split.

This recipe is just great.  I do use an egg wash for a nice brown crust, and I didn't have wheat germ, so I use 3T of vital wheat gluten instead. I've been baking this bread once a week for over six months now, and every time it comes out wonderful. I do split the dough, however, and freeze half, and bake half.  The frozen dough we use during the week to make sourdough pizza, which is also a great hit. :) The dough freezes very well, and just needs to defrost at room temp for 2 to 3 hours, and then raise in a warmed oven with a bowl of water for at least 30-40 mins.

I found this to be too unstable, it does not use enough flour.  My dough wanted to puff too much while rising & it deflated no matter how careful I was while handling, even though I was careful not to over-rise & the temps while rising were not excessive (maybe 70*, light on, oven off, no drafts)  Also, the oven temp is too high to cook the inside until hollow.  The crust was way beyond brown, not appealing & I had two loaves.  I researched technique & tried another recipe, which turned out amazing....Tips that helped the other recipe were that.... too little flour & not enough kneading made unstable, deflatable dough. (10 min. in my kitchenaide with the dough hook was perfect) & then to def. use an eggwash, (I used melted butter first, then eggwash & the crust was chewy & crispy, and PRETTY), not dry, crumbly & burnt.  Preheat your oven for 50 min at 400* with a stone on the lowest rack.  Let your bread do it's final rise on a greased/cornmealed metal pan & then set the pan right onto the hot stone in the preheated oven.  The hot stone helped cook the inside perfectly.  Put a ramekin of hot water on the floor of your oven for steam. Spritz the walls with water often for 5-10 min.  Bake for 10 min. then turn heat to 370* for 20-30 min.  I think technique is what bread is all about, & this recipe lacks technique. I'm sorry for the review, I DID like the flavor.  I'll try the ingred. again sometime, but with these changes.

This bread is wonderful!  Nice texture and good zing from my starter.  I made the dough in my bread machine and then divided it into rolls, cooked some and froze the rest.  I could have eaten every roll I baked.  Now I can't wait to bake the frozen ones.  I didn't have wheat germ, so I substituted ground flaxseed, which gave it a nice multi-grain look.

This bread has an excellent flavor.  My first time it didn't turn out quite right so I made some adjustments.  I used olive oil instead of butter and decreased the sugar by 1 tablespoon as it was too sweet the first time I made it.  I also substituted wheat flour for the wheat germ as I didn't have any wheat germ available.  I used 'fed' sourdough that sat after feeding for a few hours and was bubbling nicely.  I did make 2 instead of one loaf as it was too large the first time.  While baking, I cooked at 400 degrees for 20 minutes then shut off the oven and let it cool naturally and removed the bread.  It turned out great with these adjustments.  A lot like store bought, only better!

Very good recipe.  Should be made into two loaves though and not one.  I did the just one and I had an enormous loaf of bread!!  :)

Exactly the sourdough recipe that I was looking for!  I've made it twice now with great results.  For the second time, I applied an egg wash to make the crust crispier and it turned out great.  Highly recommended!

This bread was pretty good.  I didn't have a great starter to work with, so I think that's why my bread tasted like an average white bread, however that is not this recipe's fault.  My problem as some of the others have said, was also the fairly mushiness.  SO, I think the for best results, and the next time I make this recipe, I will lower the temperature to 350 degrees--that way the inside will cook more thoroughly. All in all, I think it's a good recipe after these changes.

Athough not a true sourdough in that it uses yeast in addition to the starter, this bread came out beautiful. Perfect crumb and crust. Light flavor (even though I had a mature starter.) Per the  advice from a Bakers Guild baker, I baked at 375 for 30 minutes, rotating halfway. Did not spritz the oven as the temp lowers every time the door opens. Instead, use a small dish filled with water or open the door slightly just to toss in a few ice cubes now and then. It made a great loaf but not sour enough because of the quick rise and use of added yeast and milk. Still, nice. Thanks!

This was a very good recipe.  My starter was fairly young and I was a little nervous.  My in-laws were coming for dinner and I wanted to impress them.  My father in-law loved the rolls I made from this.  He is a sourdough junkie and said these were the best!  Thanks!

This is a very tasty recipe. Easy, not a heavy bread, makes great toast, wonderful sandwich bread and fantastic French Toast. I made this in my breadmaker and then baked it in the oven. Try it, you'll like it.

Warren, THANK YOU so much for this wonderful recipe.  The loaf was quite sour and so tender.  The only change I made was subbing olive oil for the margarine (as I didn't have any).  Beautiful rise, great crust.  Will be making often!

I have made this twice. The second time I added a tbsp. minced onion, dried rosemary, and italian herbs. All the same measurements. I put cuts into the bread and it deflated on me. It was still excellent. Next I will try herb rolls.

Delicious with great texture. One caveat; watch the time it's in the oven! I also make heavy slices across the dough ball before it rises the second time. Thanks for the recipe!

My family loves this bread - I make it in two versions: one with a white flour sourdough starter and one with a whole wheat sourdough starter. The bread turns out quite differently using the different starters. I also substitute olive oil for the margarine and bake it shaped like a huge long loaf on a parchment coated baking sheet at 375 deg. F for 37 minutes. Thanks for sharing this recipe Warren.

This bread is out of this world.  Fluffy and tender.  The rise was beautiful and I followed the instructions exactly.  Mine didn't have much of the sourdough taste but I think it had to do with my starter being so young.  I did not need extra flour like other reviewers but I did split it into 2 loaves and they turned out to be two beautiful big loaves so I am happy I decided to do that.  Thanks Warren!!!!

This is some great Bread! I substituted one cup whole wheat flour for one cup white flour. I added about 1/8 cup more Starter and kneaded the Dough on a lightly floured Bread board. I kneaded the dough, let it rest for one hour, then kneaded again lightly, let is rest for another hour, then split the Dough into two round loafs. I also added an egg wash w/ sesame seeds to the dough top and a small metal bowl of water to the oven before baking. I had forgot to slash the bread dough before putting in the oven and it turned out great. Mine was much darker than the Image portrays. I froze one loaf for later use. The flavor was great, mild and very tasty.

This sourdough will quickly shoot to the top of most highly rated on this site. It was my first attempt at sourdough and even the youngest member of our house liked it! Crispy on the outside, soft and tender inside. A two pound loaf is a little much for us so I halved the recipe (one half of a tablespoon = 1 and 1/2 teaspoons). It still tasted great. Other than cutting this in half, I followed the recipe to a 'T'. I used the "No Commercial Yeast Starter" from this site. This is the best sourdough...thank you for sharing your award winning recipe Warren!

This is my first sourdough! It was amazing. My starter was only 6 days old but smelled and tasted greatl I made a couple adjustments and did not use the bread machine. I proofed my yeast in the warmed milk first. mixed all the other dry ingredients in the mixer then poured in all the liquids. I rise all my bread in the oven with an iron skillet filled with boiling water. the warmth and humidity rises the bread lovely. I do the same for the second rise. Will definitely make this again and experiment with other flours and grains.

I have made this several times now. Because I have a very small bread machine, I did half quantities and still got a pretty big loaf. Once, I forgot to add the dry yeast and remembered too late, so I left the bread to rise on a cool kitchen counter about 24 hours and it still rose well enough and had a good strong taste. By the way, I used all wholemeal flour and no added wheat germ. Thank you for this good recipe, Warren.

This bread was great - soft and chewy with a great crust that was almost flaky in a way. We really liked it. We were out of wheat germ (omitted) and sugar (exchanged with honey), but it was still wonderful. Thanks for the great recipe!

VERY good.  Not sour enough for me, but next time I'll let my starter sit longer.  I used my bread machine to mix the dough.  EASILY enough for 2 loaves.

Following the instructions, my dough was a little slack. I rounded it and set it on a pizza stone to rise and then bake. It baked quickly with a good crust and had lots of small holes. A yummy flavor, but next time I'll cut back on the sugar as it interfered with the sourdough flavor. But overall, very good and quick to make.

? I just attempted Emeril's simple sourdough recipe, 2c. flour, 1.5c starter, and salt. THATS IT! it was sooo dry and crumply it wouldn't come together until I added almost 1/2 c water. I still don't know if consistency is right or not. I just threw in fridge to proof overnite. If your a Michigander, like myself, would you ever consider a few basic baking classes? I cannot tell afterwards when the loaf sucks, whether I overkneaded, underkneaded, or didn't add enough fat, or too much fat, or not enough flour....I am not improving and getting frustrated with the waste. I do not have a stand mixer at this time, but am keeping my eyes peeled for a used one. I am hoping this will improve my end results.  So, any ideas for a baking class, and I am IN!  thanks, christy

The first loaf I made was great. I followed the recipe exactly. The second loaf is in the bread machine now. This time I believe I will do like a couple of commenters did and make two loafs. Cook one and freeze one for later.

I made this bread the other night with my newly started sourdough starter... About a week old. I've always wanted to have a sourdough starter but after a couple failed attempts I had given up. However, my starter with this recipe was great! I give the recipe the credit..and I was short on bread flour so I substituted 1/2 c wheat flour for my missing bread flour and since I don't have a bread machine I did this the old fashioned way and stirred until stiff then added cornmeal to keep from sticking to counter. I put a damp towel on top and placed in a preheated but turned off first oven which was set to 175 degrees. I did that because it was very cold out and my house needs insulation bad(drafty and cold!)  so my rise time was probably 1.5 hours... Punched it down and  rolled on flour surface(used cornmeal) made it into a round shape then placed on baking stone back in my oven I heated then turned off. After about 45 mins I took it out heated oven to 400degrees then baked for 20 minutes!! Headed to get more bread flour now! My whole family loves this bread and want more for the soup I'm making!

I've made this bread 3 times already and each time the bread turned out beautiful!  I do use my bread machine for the mixing and turn the dough out on the bread board for the forming and last rise.  I have made this bread into one large loaf or two smaller loaves (which I prefer).

It is simple to make and one of my family favorites.

What an amazing recipe! Such a lovely taste, and especially with the method of using the bread maker to do all the hard work for you, you can have home-made artisan bread in a jiffy with no real fuss! I can't wait to make this again!!!!

I hate to give critical reviews to any recipe. However, I did not care for this recipe because it did not taste like authentic sourdough bread. This type of bread does not need "fancy" additions like milk or margarine. Sometimes simple is better, i.e. sourdough starter, flour, water, salt, a bit of sugar and yeast.

This recipe is very easy and turns out wonderful. The crust is very flavorful and the inside texture is perfect. I have made this recipe about 4 times now and it turns out the way sourdough bread is famous for. Thanks for the recipe. Douglas

I've made this bread three times in the last 2 days...awesome.So easy to come together,I used all purpose flour and after the punch down and shape I baked it in 2 loaf pans 8x4 baked 350*in preheated oven for 30 minutes.Came out perfect,it rose up way over the top of pan before I baked,the texture was so good,and great flavor.This will be my recipe from now on,I buttered the top right out of the oven because I like it soft.Thanks Warren for a great recipe.Happy Georgia girl here.

very good, i make this one into 2 recipes . one with whole wheat and the other one is with bread flour. both using different starter that why the whole wheat is more sour than the normal one. both i use diifrent topping. the white one i use course salt my fav and the other one is sugar and sesame , because of the sugar the crust it make became more crispy and sweet ( love this topping too ) i don't know why but the whole wheat need more baking than the white one.

I adapted for the mixer (liquid, fat, salt then dry ingredients).  The appearance, taste, crumb and crust are all excellent - however, not sour flavored, but more like a delicious whole wheat bread.

This sourdough recipe is the first I've tried, and I'm happy with the results. The bread has a good crisp crust and a delicious inside. Great recipe. I used this for buns the second time. Note: I would cut down the salt and minimize the rising time next time, as it is VERY salty

At the end of the dough cycle my dough was very, very runny. I ended up tossing it in the mixer with the dough hook and adding in a lot more flour-2-3 cups I believe. I've noticed our machine often needs more flour than the recipe so it could be just a quirk. 

Other than that I followed the recipe as listed. The bread turned out delicious and made a huge loaf-our whole family loved it. It could easily make two smaller loaves or really yummy rolls.

When I read the ingredients and saw 1 tablespoon of salt, I was sure that was too much, but made the bread anyway as instructed.  Well, I was right.  The bread is entire too salty and 1 1/2 teaspoons (which I normally add) to two teaspoons of salt would have been enough.  The salt overpowers the actual flavor of the bread.  I will make it again with 1 1/2 tsp of salt.

This made a beautiful and tasty bread, but it was way too brown even though I took the advice of other reviewers and lowered the temperature to 400.  I guess next time, I'll turn the oven off after 20 minutes or so and let the bread continue to cook in the cooling oven.  I definitely think this is enough for 2 loaves.  I made one round loaf and put the rest of the dough in the freezer.

Great recipe! All the flavor was there! I had a great starter fermented (Sourdough Starter II from this website) so I omitted the extra yeast and wheat germ in this recipe. Really didn't need it .

This would be MUCH better if you left out the yeast and let it rise in an UNHEATED oven for 6-12 hours. That is, after all, how real sourdough bread is made.

The only thing I didnt have was wheatgerm and I let it cook in the breadmaker to see how it turned out. Next time I want to have the wheatgerm and want to bake it in the oven..........

update got wheatgerm and i dont t hink it made a difference, i have baked this 2 times and I just really really think that 1 tablespoon of salt is too much, i think 2 teaspoons should be enough............

It rises well and other than the saltiness we all liked the flavor..............will try with less salt and let you know..........

I loved this bread. I made it into two loafs that came out beautiful. The taste is fabulous. I did cut down the commercial yeast to one scant teaspoon because I am on a quest to make bread with just my starter, but I'm still learning about how to do that.

This was my first effort at sough dough and it was awesome!! I didn't have cornmeal but that didn't seem to have a negative effect. I used a stone and spritzed it with cooking spray before putting the dough on it to rise. I used an egg wash at the start and half way through made of one egg white and 3 tbs water. I will definitely use this recipe over and over!!

This recipe is certainly easy and the flavor and texture of the bread are excellent.  It makes a HUGE loaf, though (12 inch diameter), and the next time I make it I'll make 2 smaller loaves.  I mixed and kneaded it in my bread machine on the dough cycle and that worked very well.  Next time, I'll use a little more starter and a little less milk to heighten the sourdough flavor.  Overall, very, very good.

This recipe is wonderful! Let me tell you it does not work in a bread machine though. I tried it in my bread machine the first time and it makes too much of a crust and also is just a little more than two pounds I am guessing because it got a little too big. LOL. But the second time i made it in the oven and it was a hit. Everyone loved it and the loaf was perfect. Looked great and taseted great. Now i am making my third loaf and am so excited to see how much better the starter keeps getting. We like extra sourdough bread. I also decided after that second time that one loaf is way too big, so i cut the dough into two loafs and bake it in the oven that way. The bread machine works to make the dough, just do not bake it in there.

OMG talk about easy and wonderful.  I put it in my bread machine and let it rise and had the perfect loaf of sourdough.  I am going to make a loaf for my in-laws who love breads.
