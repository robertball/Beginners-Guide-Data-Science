Since in her description the submitter indicates she "likes to use fresh dill when available," I can only assume that in the recipe where she calls for dill SEED she really meant dill WEED.  Dill seed would give this an altogether different flavor, similar to caraway seed - so that's what I used, fresh dill WEED.  Baking this for an hour wasn't necessary and perhaps not even advised. Once the onion and rice were browned I added the water and cooked it on the stovetop in the conventional manner, covered and simmered for about 20 minutes.  Hubs and I enjoyed this.  It had a fresh, delicate flavor of lemon and dill which was the ideal complement to the fish I served with it.

This was really good. I did decrease the salt to 1 teaspoon and it turned out fine.  I also just let it cook on the stovetop instead of baking.  It was done much quicker and still had a great taste.

Excellent!  I took away a start for needlessly complicating the recipe, simple keep it in the pot and cook like regular rice, takes about 15 minutes.  No need to take up time and space in your oven.

I really liked this recipe. I did not use all the dill I only used 4 teaspoons of dill in stead of the 2 tablespoons it called for. I also reduced the salt to one teaspoon.

I just spent a half hour searching for my printed copy of this recipe and couldn't find it which is why I researched for this dish and decided to rate it. This dish is so incredibly different from traditional rice dishes, so if your tired of the same ol, same old rice dish, you gotta try this. The moisture content is incredible and it goes amazingly well with lemon chicken. The flavors of the onion and lemon make the dish pop and will definitely have people asking how u made it!!!

after reading the reviews I was on this I was a little skeptical in making it as is so I modified it. This is what I did. I used basmati rice, sauted 2 whole cloves of garlic with the onion, added 2 cups of chicken broth and then 2 cups of water I did not add the salt  and only added 1 tsp of dill it turned out perfect, what I did not ,modify I keep the same. this was good served with the lemon garlic chicken on this site. it's 5 stars with modifications. I know I don't like either when people modify things, but I felt I had too with all the bad reviews

Baking it was a bad idea. I had to continue adding liquids and the rice still came out crunchy. Otherwise the flavors were good. Next time I'll just make it stovetop.  I served it w/ poached salmon with lemon juice and capers. Overall it was pretty tasty and different.

The dill overpowers every other flavor as is.  Use only 1 tsp instead of two tablespoons unless you like rice textured pickles.  Had to toss it out.

Good! The lemon flavor is pretty subtle, so don't skip the lemon zest if you want the flavor to really be there. I used a little olive oil instead of the butter. Very tasty; a great side dish for a fish dinner. Thanks :)

It was really yum but then again its not quite the same recipe. I didn't put the onion and replaced dill seed with 1 1/2 cup dill herbs. 3 cups water to 2 cups rice on the stovetop, and it was to die for. Sigh!

I've made this recipe many times now.  It always turns out delicious and is a wonderful side dish to serve with seafood because of the lemon and dill.

This was actually very good but based on other's reviews, I didn't bake it. I sauteed the onion, added the rice to toast, used chicken broth and cooked the rice as usual. Served with broiled Tilapia.

We love this and I gave it 5 stars because I did not follow directions exactly. I love salt, so much so I salt pepperoni pizza so you can see tiny drifts of salt. lol The salt was good for me but I noticed it. And if I notice it, most others find it too overwhelming. I also did not have fresh dill and used dried dill weed, agreeing with another poster who suspected "dill SEED" was a typo. I also finished it conventionally on the stove as did another. It's was lovely, different and delicious glouise. Thank you!

Love the flavor! I can't have enough of it. My 2 yrs old loved it, too. Only MISTAKE I had was using Sushi/Short grain rice. You need to use LONG-GRAIN RICE for this recipe!!!!

I made this with brown rice, it was great!  Lemon turns out mild, and I could have added more dill weed.

The flavours are really good, but the cooking time is too long, resulting in mushy rice. I will try this again, because it's great to have the rice in the oven while you attend to the rest of the meal, but bake it less time. Thanks!

Pretty good.  I did change the recipe.  I can't imagine how salty this would be with 2 Tbsp. salt, so I used only 2 tsp.  It was still a litte too salty in my opinion, so I would recommend only 1 tsp salt.  The ingredients called for dill seed, but I used dill weed (2 tsp.).  I also didn't bother baking it in the oven, I just covered it and finished cooking on the stove, took about 20 minutes.  This is a great side dish for fish.  I cooked it to accompany Garlic Salmon from this side and it went great!

I thought this would be very good with a fish dish.  Reading other reviews, I reduced the amount of dried dill weed to 1 teaspoon and it still overpowered the dish.  My husband couldn't even eat it.  Also, I took other's advice and cooked on the stove-top due to time. While the reduced dill was still very strong for me (a dill lover), I think the dish has potential. The lemon zest topping was great and I liked the idea of cooking it in lemon juice.  If you are unsure of the dill flavor, start with a small amount, you can always increase it but you can't remove it.  I served this with Broiled Tilapia Parmesan (Yummy!) from this site and Roasted Asparagus.  I even took some leftover lemon zest and topped the asparagus and fish, which was a very good addition.

I took the advice of other reviewers and reduced salt but substituted Herbamare aromatic sea salt (with orgganic herbs) and instead of dill seed I used 1/4 dried dill weed and it doesn't overpower the flavour. The dried dill weed can be increased to one's taste. A little garlic powder also helped.

The quantities of rice to water works fine but, even for me a dill lover, it is too strong.   Also I use dill weed (n ot seed which could be an error in tying) and reduced it to half.    Otherwise it works out nice and fluffy and moist.

Very good, the lemon flavor really came through with the zest. I added fresh dill and cut down the salt by about 3/4. I threw all of the ingredients in my rice cooker and it turned out great!

After making this recipe, I realized I don't like dill.  I tried the recipe because I was looking for rice with lemon flavor.  This was not it.  My husband ate it and didn't complain, but I won't make it again.  I used less dill than the recipe called for, but it was still overwhelming.

Reading other reviews, I was worried that the dill might end up being too strong, but my boyfriend and I both thought it was perfect.  I changed the recipe slightly by cooking it in a rice cooker instead of baking and adding a little extra lemon juice (as I didn't have a fresh lemon for the zest) as well as a few dashes of garlic powder.  I'll definitely be making this again!

This was a really good rice dish. It had a pleasant taste and we all enjoyed it. Was really easy to fix and inexpensive. I will serve this again. I made this a second time just tonight and it paired really well with a lemon chicken and mushroom sauce. I only used half the onion called for, cut the salt down to a little over half tsp., used dill weed instead of seed and I didn't have as much as called for. I made this on the stovetop this time and only had to cook it the regular 15 minutes for a perfect rice. Thanks, this was very good.

The flavors would be really good, but 2 tablespoons of dill and 2 tablespoons of salt are WAY too much, unless you want your rice to taste like dill pickle water! I suspect that this is a typo for 1-2 TEAspoons of dill and 1-2 TEAspoons of salt

Our family really liked this rice.  It's a nice change from regular rice pilaf with the added zip of lemon and dill. The recipe called for dill seed bit I used dill weed.

This was way too salty. Next time I would only use 1 teaspoon of salt and add pepper.

Excellent side dish with fish. This recipe calls for too much salt. Use half as much or even less. I used dill weed instead of seed, which was fine. The dill weed floats to the top so the dish looks greenish!

I read the reviews, and added 1/3rd the amount of dill required.  I also cooked it on the stovetop in the interests of time.  It turned out well, and I'd make it again.

This is great! I love the burst of lemon flavor! I did cut down on the dill. Also, since i didn't want to wait for rice to cook I made couscous instead. I added the lemon to the water before adding the couscous and added the dill as the couscous steamed. I paired it with Lemon Garlic tilapia that I found on this site. Great combo. Will definitely make it again!

I really like the taste and texture of this dish. It was everything that I thought it would be. I cut the recipe in half for us. I didn't have any lemon zest or parsley, and it was still great.

It was ok, nothing more than that simply because the suggested amount of dill weed and lemon zest was overboard.  Too tangy for my taste.

Not too shabby.  The dill flavor was a bit strong for me, but my guests liked it.  It was a pretty good accompaniment for grilled salmon.
