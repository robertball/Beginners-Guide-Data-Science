8.15.16  Found the grated parmesan in the kitchen after I took the photo (it looks a lot better with the cheese on it).  The only recommendation I would suggest is making more of the butter-balsamic sauce.   I used cheese ravioli which  is mild flavored, so you really do need enough of that sauce to coat every piece of ravioli.  Nice change of pace for ravioli, and we enjoyed it.

Loved it!  I followed some of the modifications suggested.  I did half cheese/half sausage ravioli, doubled the amount of butter/balsamic topping, and used pecans sauteed in butter.  Delicious!!  Will definitely be making this one again!

Only change I made was to use pecans instead of walnuts, since they were the only nuts we had. Glad I did, since nuts really added to the flavor. Turned out good, but really didnâ€™t get much vinegar taste. Next time will use more.

I used butternut squash ravioli and added some fresh herbs and locatelli on top - delicious! For tips I would say 1) do not substitute the butter if you don't have to. (If you're vegan, don't ruin this with vegan margarine, use something like hazelnut oil or black walnut oil, maybe a couple of drops of truffle oil mixed in - we're not talking about  high heat or long cook time so you don't have to worry about smoke point, just flavor), and 2) use good (pronounced "not cheap") balsamic. This recipe was right on time - fall's almost here and I was all pestoed out.

We  really like this.  Very nice alternative to having ravioli with a tomato based sauce.  I used pine nuts, since that's what I had.  Will do this one again
