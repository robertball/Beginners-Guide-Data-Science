Very good! I didn't have Greek seasoning, so I made up my own from a combination of oregano, dill, garlic salt, rosemary and thyme... all to equal around 1 tbsp. I added some fresh lemon and didn't flour the chicken, but it still turned out great! My roommates loved it.

Have made this many times and will continue to. A great company dish!
One change I have made (saves time and mess) is that I don't bother to coat the chicken with flour.

Got great compliments on this one!

Tripled the seasoning, and marinated the chicken ahead of cooking for about an hour with fat-free greek dressing -- was great, and not a bit left in the dish when dinner was through!

Served with orzo with some garlic, parsley and lemon juice - combination worked quite well.

Even my kids liked this one.  I agree that the amount of spice should be doubled (at least), but I would not skip the flour as it really helps make the chicken a nice brown color.  Also, I substituted broccoli for the zuke (all I had) and it was fine.

This is absolutely wonderful! I have made it quite a few times now, and I have only changed a couple of things. I don't think the flour is necessary. I have also added artichoke hearts, because a greek dish like this without artichoke hearts doesn't make sense. I serve this with pasta tossed with olive oil and (more) greek seasoning. It is really delicious.

WOW!!! This recipe is fantastic! I did what some others suggested and used extra zucchini and squash instead of pasta, three tablespoons of seasoning, and alot of feta cheese. Usually I can't stand feta but the combination of these ingredients is delicious. Thanks for the recipe!

OMGoodness, Phenominal is the word I would use because this was so good. I was worried about the greek seasoning tasting too minty, but it was perfect. I made mine with bone-in, skin-on chicken; which made the cooking time increase, but i was worth it. My husband said he would spend $25 a plate for this meal at an expensive restaurant. Oh yeah, I made it with Orzo and Rice from this site.

This recipe is one of my husband's favorites. Rather than cook it in a skillet, I layer everything but the feta cheese in my slow cooker. I cook it on low while we are at work. Before serving, I add the feta cheese and close the lid for about 10 minutes. I have the best luck with bone-in skinless chicken breasts. By the end of the day the bones  practically fall out of the chicken and we end up with a stew.

This was really good!! I could not find the Greek seasoning so I mixed the seasonings that were described to make about 2 tablespoons. I served it with brown rice. Definitely a keeper!!

This was nice and simple and quite tasty.  I don't like olives, but my boyfriend does so I used sliced olives (i.e. slightly larger pieces) rather than chopped, which made it easy to get most of them on his plate and avoid the few that wound up on mine.  He loves feta so he dumped the remaining half package of feta on his serving, while I thought the recipe amount was just right.

Delicious. I added an extra can of tomatoes, 4 tbls of seasoning and 6oz of artichoke hearts and this was flavorful and fantastic. The only thing I would do differently is pound the chicken a little thinner and marinate in Greek dressing--the chicken was a little dry but I think that was my fault and not the recipe. Outstanding!! Will be making again and again!

This recipes was both easy and very good.  I took a suggestion from an ealier review to marinate the chicken first and it seemed to bring out the greek flavor.  This recipe was so good in fact that my younger sister, who when younger often growled while eating something "very yummy", growled quite a bit while consuming this dish!

I didn't bother with the flour either and this still turned out awesome!  But used the seasoning probably triple...we love that blend.  Basically pretty easy, mostly healthy, quick dinner idea.  The second time I made it, I used zucchini and yellow squash and it still all got eaten!  Looked pretty too!

Quick and nutritious.  I took someone else's advice and added 2 TBSP of Greek seasoning and that was perfect for us. Next time I will marinate the chicken breasts in a few spoonfuls of greek salad dressing for a couple of hours ahead of time because although the sauce was flavourful the chicken breasts still were a bit bland for us.  Great recipe, thanks for sharing.

This is a good weeknight meal that my husband and I enjoyed.  I added about 2 tblsp of the Greek seasoning, though.  I found it a little bland with just 1 tblsp.
