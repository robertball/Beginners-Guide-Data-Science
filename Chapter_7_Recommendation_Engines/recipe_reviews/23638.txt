Didn't use bread machine, baked for about 40 min at 350F.  The brown rice gives it texture and a slightly sweet taste.

This was a really great tasting loaf of bread.  It was so moist and smooth.  I've never made bread in my bread machine, except from a mix before, and it was so delicious!  The whole family loved it!  However, I did cook the rice for 40 minutes until it was fully cooked.

We have tried it with different rices and all turn out wonderful. It is perfect for toast and it also makes the BEST grilled cheese sandwiches ever.

This is a good loaf of bread but the brown rice does need to be fully cooked for our tastes. I served this with curried carrot soup also from this site and it was a good pairing. Thanks Dan.

I set my machine to the dough cycle, and then kneeded the dough in some extra flour until it was smooth. I formed a loaf and set it to rise in a bread pan, then baked at 350 degrees for 30-35 mintutes. This turned out beautifully, and I'll definately keep the recipe. Great way to use up leftover rice!

I made some alterations in this recipe to make the bread less glycemic. I used 1/4 c. all-purpose flour with the water and yeast to make a sponge. I then used 3/4 c. gluten, 1 c. cooked brown rice, and 1 c. whole wheat flour (plus a little more to knead). The bread didn't rise as high as I would have liked, but it tasted great--just a little bit sweet, chewy, and soft. Next time I will use less rice and more whole wheat flour. I think it would have been perfect if I had done that this time. I'm also going to try it with wild rice. Thanks Dan!

I would actually give this recipe four and a half stars. It's very tasty however I think that the rice needs to be cooked for the full 40 minutes that it takes to cook brown rice. I will definitely make this recipe again!

Excellent bread. I didn't have bread flour, all I had was whole white wheat flour(which is a little more heavier than reg flour but lighter than whole wheat) and all purpose flour. Baked it in the oven, and came out great.  The boys loved it.  We will keep this one and make regularly.

A great recipe!
Instead of the rice you can use Bulgur (or Burgul-which is Toasted cracked soft white wheat) that was immersed in boiling water for 30 minutes or so (until softened).

We liked this bread although we didn't notice too much difference from our regular oat/white bread.  I would definately make it again as I like the idea of having the healthy brown rice in it.  I will try it with wheat flour and oats added.  Thank you for the recipe.

Turned out lovely!!Too good. I just used 1/3 whole wheat flour. Thanks for a great recipe. I don't have a bread machine. I let it rise twice, then shaped , raised again and baked at 350 F for 40 mins. Perfect!!!!

I tweaked this recipe a bit, cutting back on the flour and substituting milled flaxseed, wheat germ, and oatmeal for the missing flour.  It was still perfect, crispy crust and light and moist on the inside.  I highly recommend this recipe, which allows plenty of room for experimentation!

Wonderful bread!  I love the texture. The only thing I did different than the original recipe is I used half bread flour and half wheat flour.  I was trying to find a healthier version of fresh bread that I could make, and I found it.  This bread is highly recommended!

Used my bread machine and the bread baked out of the pan - big mess on my hands there!  But the bread was awesome!  It was light and yummy!  I nearly ate the whole loaf myself - while it was warm.
This is definitely a keeper for my family.  Thanks for sharing Dan!

This made a lovely loaf! I added a bit of rye flour (~1/4 c) mostly for visual appeal ;) The dough was really sticky (it's July by the coast so the flour has a lot of humidity) - not sure if that was just me or if the recipe tends to be wet - remember to touch the dough during mixing & add a bit of flour at a time if needed. A keeper!

I was quite impressed - you'd never know there was rice is this recipe ... which is a good thing as my huband can't stand brown rice.  I, too, used 2 cups bread flour, 1 cup wheat, and added a dash of gluten stuff (can't remember name if it and too lazy to get up and look) to ensure a nice rise.  Used brown Jasmine rice which gave it a lovely scent (cooked rice for 35" to ensure it was done) Baked @ 350 for 35" - lovely.

This is the best bread ever. I used white rice instead of brown rice. I also added 1/4 cup powdered milk. Honestly, it has the best flavor of any bread Ive ever tasted. I will definitely make this again.

This was a great easy recipe. However as the recipe didn't specify white or wholewheat bread flour I used wholewheat as that was all I had. Any how I doubled the recipe to make a bigger loaf and it turned out great. As I eat a lot of rice this will probably be my staple loaf in the week! Excellent Recipe!

This is pretty good and a great way to disguise healthy food for my kids.  The rise is a lot less detectable than I expected.  The flavor is nice.

The bread taste is really good. I found when the rice was in the crust it was really crunchy. I didn't like that part so didn't eat the crust. The rest of it was good though

I certainly would make it again. The only thing I was puzzled about was the 1/3 cup of brown rice (cooked or uncooked?)
Eventually figured it out, but think it could have been explained better

Really good.  I didn't use a bread machine but it doesn't matter it made a great tasting loaf of bread.  I did use 2 C White flour and 1 C whole wheat flour.

I ended up using white rice since that is what we had on hand.  This had a very nice texture, but a similar taste to a normal white bread.  I plan to try this with the brown rice to see if it is better.
