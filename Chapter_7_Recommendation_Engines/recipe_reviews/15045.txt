I put these cookies in a rubbermaid container and they got very sticky within an hour or so. Also if the cookies come out out rounded on top so when you go to flip and frost the cookies like the recipe says they teeter-tooter back and forth, which is a real pain.

These were a lot like those store bought cookies you can get at any grocery store with the thick frosting on top. The flavor of the cookie was pretty plain so I added vanilla and almond extracts to the dough, as well as to the frosting and it gave it a nicer flavor. It actually made exactly 60 cookies, and I halved the icing and had the perfect amount to frost all 60 with none to spare. Not a half bad cookie if sugar cookies are your thing.

I really like these cookies.  I followed the recipe except used 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract and about 3/4 teaspoon almond extract.  The flavor was very good, but they do need frosting to seem "complete"- I just used a can of frosting.  These cookies are reminiscent of dense cupcakes.  They're quite soft, but not chewy like a chocolate chip cookie.  Mine turned out very tall and rounded, I may try to bake them without refrigerating the dough next time because my fiance thought they were too thick.  I really like this recipe though and I can see myself making it many, many times.

I love this recipe! The cookies turned out great. The only thing that I did different was to flatten the cookies slightly before baking them. It is my new favorite cookie recipe and I will be making them over and over!

I was a little disappointed in the amount of time and energy that went into these cookies, yet I give them a 4 for taste.

I am hoping to give these a new identity as a cobbler crust. I baked about 18 of them and they are a disappointment. They're little sweet buttermilk biscuit-like things. Don't go there. It's a waste of time and ingredients!

I made these cookies yesterday and they are ALL GONE today. Very good. I would just suggest to grease the cookie sheet because these cookies stick.

Yumm! I was pleasantly surprised at how light weight these were! I'm not a big icing fan, so I added about 3/4 cup of MINI chocolate chips and they were WONDERFUL. I got lots of compliments! Thanks for sharing!

Delicious cookie. I love that they are puffy and not flat. I used a mix of vanilla and almond extracts because i like almond in my sugar cookies, and don't worry about flipping the cookie over- frost the rounded side, it's cute! I was also wary of the raw eggs in the frosting, but it was nice and fluffy and i'm glad i used it!

Cookies are soft and yummy.....I messed up the frosting and put 4 egg whites instead of 2 but just added more powdered sugar to hide the mistake.  The frosting was really airy.

This cookie was a hit. It was good because it was easy to decorate with a little food coloring and some sprinkles. The actual cookie was just a little bit bland so I put some almond extract in it as well. Good Cookie.

I made two batches of these for my coworkers. The first batch, the cookies were really flat and bland. The second time, I added about a half cup more flour and 1/4 cup pecans, which made the cookies a little more shaped, more firm, and a lot tastier. I also used whipped betty crocker frosting instead of homemade. 

I'd recommend putting topping on the frosting to brighten up the flavor of the cookies. I varied my toppings, using chocolate chips, cinnamon-sugar, ground cinnamon, crushed pecans, and multi-colored jimmies.

These cookies went over really well at the kids Christmas party. I used creamy deluxe Betty Crocker icing and added green and red sprinkles for an added Christmas touch. For the cookies I used margarine instead of butter and taken from one of the reviews I used 1/2 tsp vanilla and 3/4 tsp almond extract. To bake them, I placed them on parchment paper,which I find works well with all my baking.

made the recipe as written and took to work for "halloween cookies" - even dyed the frosting orange and added chocolate sprinkles.  they were a hit!  very light cookie but with such a wonderful taste.  agree with the reader who halved the icing recipe - had way too much left over for 60 cookies.

WOW!!! These cookies looked wonderful when they came out.Nice and fluffy .I baked mine for 9 minutes.You do need to spray your cookie sheet.I always do,no matter what.BUT, there was no flavor as I tried one.I guess I should of listen to others and add almond extract.I gave this recipe 5 stars because over all they are good.Next time I will add a little almond extract.I am sure that will do the trick.

Good cookies. Tinted the frosting pink and added sprinkles, which was loved by a 3-year-old.

* I did not make the frosting, opting for a can of buttercream instead *
My hubby loved these cookies.  I thought it needed a touch more cooking time but were an interesting cookie to say the least.  Almost cake like.  Needed to add 1/4 cup extra flour and the dough was still hard to work with.  Sprayed my hands with Pam before rolling into balls.

Very soft sugar cookie, however I had to cook mine longer that 12 minutes, I also used parchement paper. I would add less sour cream next time and still cook it a little longer. The Frost recipe is GREAT however I had to look how much 1 pound of sugar was, by the way its 2 cups.

I have actually never made the cookies, but the frosting is the best.  I have made it for years and I love it.  I make it for almost every cake I make.  I only now need to find the perfect cake recipe to go with this perfect frosting recipe.  Also, there is always extra icing to eat after I have frosted and decorated layer cakes.  Yum ;).
