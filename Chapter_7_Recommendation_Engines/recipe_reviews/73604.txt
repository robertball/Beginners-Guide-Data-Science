I omited the pea's, they do not have the correct texture. Instead of kidney beans,  I used a can of black beans.  Kidney beans are to big and overpowering, black beans are just right.

This is a very good, quick recipe. I even messed up and used tomato sauce instead of paste, but it still came out tasting very good. My husband didn't care for the kidney beans in it, but he doesn't like any type of bean. We really enjoyed the "mexican" taste and I will be making it many times in the future. Thanks for sharing!

This was great!  I changed it a bit.  I cooked the ground beef and onion together, added the seasonings, then a can of "diced tomatoes with green peppers" and a 5 oz can tomato paste.  Then I added the corn and a rinsed/drained can of black beans.  (I skipped the peas and kidney beans).  Followed the rest of the recipe as is.  We topped our servings with "Deans Guacamole Dip" and it was wonderful  Served with a salad and Corn Casserole (also from allrecipes).  Thanks!

Very good - a quick dinner option for busy days - I put corn chips on the top instead of the tortillas and I cooked the onion and the green pepper with the ground beef to save time.

I was not overly thrilled with this recipe.  It just didn't have enough flavor and I thought that the peas were kind of weird in it.  I know that it is chili but it seemed like it was kind of mexican so the peas threw it off.  I do think that it has good potential.  Next time I will try with taco seasoning and eliminate the peas.  Maybe add some salt & garlic.

I used left over chili as I made so much and it turned out just fine. One reviewer said her husband didn't like kidney beans and I had the same problem before my husband decided to cut the kidney beans in half. It wasn't the taste so much I didn't like but the feel of the whole bean and by cutting them in half they got more soft and the taste was still there. It takes alittle time to put on a cutting board and move around to cut but it's well worth it.

Here are the changes I made.  I omitted the olive oil and cooked the onions with the ground beef.  I omitted the peas and green peppers.  I raised the amount of chili powder to 1 tsp.  I used flour tortillas instead of corn.  I also used 2 c. of mexican shredded cheese.  
When I put it all together, I put about 1/2 c. on bottom of pan.  Then layered the tortillas, beef mixture and cheese.  I repeated the layers and then sprinkled a little more cheese on top.  It turned out pretty good, but could use some spicing up.

I tried this with some of the alterations from the other reviews, and it was amazing! I also like things spicy so I substituted Rotel tomatoes (mild but will try original next time) and black beans, used taco seasoning on the beef, left out the peas, and used wheat tortillas instead of corn cuz I didn't have any. My husband and I loved it and will definitely make again!

Gosh, I am on another page with this one, I felt I wasted so much making it.  I wanted to use the whole can of tomato paste, not just the 1/4 cup.   I found the whole dish not worth my 1/4 of my panty.

VERY good!  Followed the recipe to a *T* and it was a surprise hit.  When I do it again I will add a touch more tomatoes, but that is a personal preference.  This dish is just great as listed.

We all liked it, but next time I would use a little less of the red pepper flakes because the kids thought it was a little to hot.

This was a pretty good dish.  Good for cleaning out the pantry!  If you are feeding a large crowd I recommend it.  We had leftovers and it wasn't as good the second time around.

This  is a nice quick chili that's a bit spicy with lots of flavor.  I left out the onion (hate them) and used frozen corn and peas.  We're looking forward to eating the leftovers this weekend.

This didn't do it for us. I used an extremely high-quality chili powder and followed the instructions exactly,but this was a pretty "blah" dish. It was so flavorless that we had to sprinkle taco seasoning on it at the table to make it taste like anything. I took the leftovers to work the next day, but I couldn't bring myself to eat them.

Skipped the peas (that's just wrong) and used salsa for the tomato paste, substituted black beans (very nice) and doubled the spices adding garlic & cumin to the beef mixture. Also cut the onion in half, didn't miss the other one. Have to add more cheese too! Really good, my two college boys finished it off.

I didn't care for this casserole, nor did my family.  It was very bland (I did add garlic and salt to the ground beef). It almost needed something to hold it all together.  Perhaps a can of rotel tomatoes instead of the diced tomatoes would have helped with the seasoning.  And more cheese would have made it more like a casserole and not a bunch of ingredients just thrown together.

Not bad, but really bland. I even added extra chili powder and red pepper. It's a very attractive dish, but it needs lots more spice to make my family want to eat it. All we could taste was bell peppers and tomatoes. Might have been better if it was simmered longer.

I used every ingredient mentioned and added some more. I added some crushed garlic, salt and pepper. I even added more chili powder and red pepper flakes b/c I like my food spicy. I bought a small jar of sour cream to top it off.   It's an easy recipe to follow. I used a rod iron steel skillet instead of a casserole dish and changed the servings from 4 to 6. A serving is huge!   Next time I'd add some chopped jalapenos, less corn and add more beef. i also added cheese on both layers and I used sharp chedder.

I used wheat tortillias instead of corn, which were wonderful.  However, it does need a pinch of salt.  Great dish. Will make again!!

My family really liked this dish.  We like our food spicy so I used more chili powder and red pepper flakes.  I also love peas, so I would add more next time -- I will definitely make this again.

Excellent recipe, just as is. Not a lot of chili powder, just enough to enhance, not overwhelm the flavor of the  vegetables. Also, not a lot of liquid, so the beans, corn and peas maintain their texture.

Definite recommendation for this one.

This recipe tasted pretty good. My husband & I love sour cream, so we topped the dish off with some. It helped out a lot. I also used some salt to season the beef mixture.  We enjoyed it, and had it for left overs for the next couple of days.

This is really great!  I just added the chips separately, since I don't like soggy chips.

My 9yr old was adamant she didn't want to try this but once I made her, she loved it. Asked for two helpings. Second night, two helpings of leftovers. I left out the red pepper flakes.

Simple, tasty, and fairly healthy.  Used fresh flour tortillas (didn't have any corn ones) and everyone had seconds.  Peas and kidney beans are good fiber.  Used Monterey Jack  and Cheddar mixed and a whole can (small one) of tomato paste.

This was a hit for my husband and me. I did make a couple changes: I mixed the cheese in with the chili mixture before putting it in the casserole dish. Then I mixed up a package of Jiffy corn bread mix and put it on top instead of using tortillas. This turned out really well. I did put 1 1/2 times the seasoning in and next time would probably double it. As for the peas? meh -- it would be fine with or without them.
