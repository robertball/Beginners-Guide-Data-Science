This is one of our favorite summer treats to make. And I mean OUR because it's great for little hands that want to help out in the kitchen. We make ice pops out of them, using dixie cups and popsicle sticks. All I do is just pour the mixture into the dixie cups about 1/2-3/4 cups full, place the filled cups onto a flat baking sheet and freeze until just solid, then stick the popsicle sticks in. For me, Yoplait yogurt is near free seeing as I coupon and berries are cheap this time of year so it's not only economical but it's healthier than the Go-gurt pops that my kids love and it tastes better, too! This works with just about any low-calorie/low-sugar yogurt or fruit you'd want to use AND it doubles/triples/quadruples really well. NOTE: I did NOT review this because it was similar to another recipe I have made before. I HAVE made this recipe many times and even though it's not technically "frozen yogurt", it makes great yogurt pops in the summer for the kiddos.

Callie, please explain how you get frozen yogurt from this recipe? Is there a typo? I was so excited to try this recipe. I paid $4 for the vanilla yogurt, just to make it, which I don't normally buy. I really dislike when other people rate the recipe, because they have made something they believe is similar. I only had the one review to go on. Either way, I got a regular consistency blueberry smoothie from the recipe. It is typically how I would make many smoothies anyway. The smoothie isn't bad, but I am rating a recipe for frozen yogurt. I did not deviate from this one, so I don't know what happened.

This is a great substitute for frozen yogurt! I found it to be so thick that my blender had a hard time chopping everything up, so I added just a little skim milk to help it out. I'll probably use my food processor next time since it does a better job with this kind of thing. I could have eaten it straight from the blender and had "frozen yogurt," but I decided to put it in popsicle molds to share with my granddaughter. She loved it! (I used fat-free vanilla yogurt like what you buy in the dairy section, NOT a frozen vanilla yogurt like ice cream)
