I did this a little differently. I combined the soups and sour cream together, browned the chops in a skillet and the put them in a bakin dish with the soup mixture and a bag of thawed frozen green beans. I added some shredded cheddar and baked @ 350 covered with foil for about 40 minutes. I took the foil off, sprinkled with fried onions and baked for apx 10 minutes longer until the onions crisped up and browned. Seasonings I added included red pepper flakes, garlic powder, a dash of clove, salt, and pepper. Everyone loved this dish and it even made the green beans (which I hate) taste edible!

Good basic recipe.  I browned my chops on the stove first.  Also, because I only needed 2 pork chops I only used one can of cream of mushroom and left the cream of celery out.  Also halved the sour cream.  The sour cream makes the mushroom soup taste a lot like hamburger stroganoff, not that I don't like that.  I added a little parsley and paprika for color.  I will probably make again simply because it is so simple.  My chops came out cooked perfectly, I know others complained of theirs being dry, but I used thick cut boneless pork chops, that may have been why.

This recipe was delicious!  I've made pork chops with just mushroom soup in the past. The sour cream made the gravy very creamy and added so much more flavor.  I also seasoned the chops with garlic powder, onion powder and seasoned salt and browned them on the stove before baking.  I will pass this recipe on to family and friends!

An easy and mouth watering way to make this soooo good recipe is to put all ingredients except for the french fried onions in a slow cooker all day on medium. 

It falls off the bone and is so easy you hardly have to think abou it! Remeber to brown them on a skillet first.

GREAT recipe for freezer burnt pork chops!!!  They came out very good, you'd never guess how much ice was on them.  I'd make again in a pinch.

This was VERY bland and the chops were overcooked.  I removed the chops to a plate, poured the sauce in a saucepan, added an envelope of dry onion soup mix and let simmer for about 10 minutes, added the sour cream, and just skipped the French onions.  If I make this again I will add the dry onion soup in the beginning and use thick chops.

Wow, this was so delicious and so easy to prepare.  The gravy is second to none. We served it over rice and the pork chops, which were so tender. I prepared this recipe exactly as written with one exception; I used Golden Mushroom soup instead of the Mushroom soup.  I did sprinkle the chops with galic salt and pepper before coating in the soup mixture.  These pork chops will have a permanent home in my regular rotation cookbook.

I will not be making this recipe again. I followed several suggestions and thought that this dish would be delish.  Instead I thought it was tasteless.  Don't know what I could of done wrong but I will not be making this again.

This recipe was fairly underwhelming.  When I rely too much on canned cream soups as the major ingredient in a recipe, I find the recipe to come out a bit bland.  I did season my pork with Jane's crazy mixed up salt, worcestershire sauce, and onion powder.  Overall, just sort of a blah recipe.

Looking at the ingredients, I was a bit skeptical. But, I was in the mood to try something new. I'm glad I did! This was surprisingly really good! I will make this again.

i really enjoy this recipe, i tried pan searing the chops first with a small amount of minced garlic and it gave it an extra kick. and a little onion mixed in with the caned soup helps the flavor along to.

My husband said it was definitely one to use again!! I browned the pork chops first, used one of the other tips to add green beans and added a can of green chilis and crushed red pepper to the gravy for a south western kick. Served it over rice -- it was great!!

I tend to brown my pork chops with a little garlic powder, pepper and salt, and use a little EVO to the pan while also adding a big vidalia onion and chop bok choy to it.  I just use mushroom soup and layer the ingredients into my casserole dish but putting the onions and bok choy, pork chops and mushroom soup on top.  Delicious!!

I really enjoyed this dish! I did follow the recipe minus the onions and loved it! The cream soups make a nice gravy thats delicious with nice or potatoes! I think i also just slightly seasoned the pork chops with salt and pepper to give it a little more flavor! I'll be making this again!

I think that my finished product would have been more attractive had I browned the meant in the pan first.The pork chop itself was very bland.  However, the gravy went really well with the rice and my husband mostly ate the rice and gravy. I may attempt this at another date in the future, browning the pork chops first. Oh, and I baked them for right about 26 minutes, and internal temp had been reached.

The sour cream was overpowering in this quantity. My husband definitely did not like it. If I try it again, I'll cut back on the sour cream.

I used cajun seasoning on my chops and then browned them before putting them in the dish.  I mixed the soups and then sour cream together with the fried onions and added a little cheddar cheese.  It was delicious!!  The next time I may add more fried onions.

My husband and I enjoyed this recipe.  I can't say the same for my 2 year old nor my 7 year old who won't eat meat, but I did get the 7 year old to try the sauce over the rice and she liked it.  I did what a lot of other people said to do and that was to mix the soups and sour cream together before and also put green beans in the mix.  I also seasoned the pork beforehand with salt and pepper and I don't like mushrooms so I just did 2 cans of celery soup.  The pork chops were very moist.  I would make this recipe again.

I'm not much of an experimental cook at all, so I followed the recipe exactly.  It was decent and edible, but it was pretty bland.  It was salty, but didn't have much taste other than salt.

I fell asleep and cooked those suckers for an extra half hour, and they were STILL moist!  (There wasn't much left of the soup, though... so I only used half the sour cream.  Wish there had been more.)
I'll definitely be making this one again (and again)!

I made these for my family probably 2 years ago and am just now getting around to rating it.  Everyone loved it.  I just found all my recipes, because my comuter crashed, and I made this last night it is still a big hit...

This was GREAT!! My husband and I both loved it and so did our two year old. I served it with White Rice and Broccoli. I feared the sauce might be a tad to thick for our liking so I added about a cup of milk. and it turned out perfect! We will make this again! Thanks for the awesome recipe!

I made this a while ago. It literally has taken me a while to write this review. This had to have been the worse pork chop dinner I have ever made. My husband who eats about anything could not eat this. It was bland and just not very good. I wouldnt recommend this to anyone- then again everyones taste buds are different. Use caution with this one. I too followed the directions to a T and it still was bad. sorry but i will not be making this again.

This appealled to me for ease.  I used a crock pot.  Worked great. taste delicious.  do not like the color of the sauce.  I would like the sauce to be darker.  May try adding a little gravy master.

I used boneless pork chops that were rather thick and in retrospect I should have pounded them out thinner (they were slightly dry on the inside), but the gravy was excellent and my husband loved them.  Thanks so much!

This one was a big hit! I happened to have cream of chicken soup on hand, so that is what I used. The gravy is fantastic. I'll absolutely be making this one again.

I made it with mashed potatoes and used real fried onions instead of the canned ones...I didn't really like it either...WAY too creamy for my taste. My hubby didn't complain.

We liked these a lot.  Like others, I made some changes.  Browned the chops.  Did them in the crock pot on low for eight hours  with cream of chicken soup, sour cream, and chicken broth.  I put them on egg noodles.  Yummy.

I loved the sauce!  I was a bit dissapointed because everyone else raved about how tender the chops were....mine came out a little tough and I bought quality pork chops. I will try this again and not cook it as long.  My husband loved it!

I thought it was very good, I substituded the cream of celery soup for the cheddar soup, it was very tastey!!
