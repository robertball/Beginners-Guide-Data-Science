This salad was okay. Not the greatest, but I may make it again some time.

What I DID love was the first half of the recipe (ginger, garlic, peanuts and tofu) served hot over rice. I enjoyed that more than finishing the recipe and turning it into a cold salad. Try it! I give the "unfinished" recipe 5 stars!

This is a great recipe. I used extra firm tofu and felt it held up well. I pressed it before cooking to eliminate the extra water. The salad went together quickly, the most time consuming part is getting the tofu ready. The taste is great - fresh, spicy, and sweet. I did add the peanuts last so that they would retain some crunch. Thanks!!

This will be a 5 star recipe if you do the following... Add broccoli, radishes, and a sweet red pepper, and about 1/2 cup more sweet chili sauce to the cold salad mix. I also added about 1/4 cup the sweet chili sauce to the Tofu mixture. I made coconut rice with red curry paste and served the Tofu mixture warm on top of the rice and then finished with the cold salad. Yum! And my husband thought this was restaurant worthy!

This is awesome.  I wish the tofu were a bit crunchier, but I do like the taste.  I found a tip somewhere (I think from the Year of Crockpotting website actually) that recommends coating tofu in cornstarch, then frying and it makes it crispier.  I'll try that next time.  I really love sweet and spicy chile sauce, and it shines in this dish.  I made one serving bc I only had one brick of tofu left (and bf won't eat it anyway) and made the tofu last night.  I mixed everything together today for my lunch and I love it.  I halved the dressing amounts and ended up adding a bit more chile sauce and lime juice in, but not the full amounts.  I used dried cilantro (I don't do well with fresh herbs in the fridge and don't have an herb garden) so I used about 1/3 less than what the fresh would be.  Thanks for the recipe!

I'm giving this 4 stars as an average score for the whole family. My husband and one son absolutely loved this one and proclaimed it a 5 star recipe. My other son and I would probably give it 3 stars, mainly because we felt the cilantro really overpowered the entire salad. I really liked the tofu cooked this way and would probably double that the next time around. Also I'd add the peanuts at the last minute so that they would still be crunchy. If you love the flavor of cilantro you would definitely love this salad!

This dish is delicious! I made some changes, though: I added green peppers and onions and instead of veggie oil (or EVOO) I used sesame oil. Literally, this has been my dinner the past three days, and I'm not tired of it.  I'm only sad that I've finished it. Oh, and no peanuts, I'm not a fan of their taste!

I love this recipe (and so do a lot of my friends)!  It's good the first day, but even better left over after everythings "marinated" for a day.  I really like the tofu cooked like this.  I am going to cook the tofu like this, add some veggies and turn it into a stir fry.

Absolutely awesome! I don't usually cook with tofu but this is excellent. All the flavors go well together. I've made this a few times now and one time I made this mixture for lettuce wraps with some sweet chili pepper sauce. The peanuts give it a great flavor!! Thanks!

I'm not a huge fan of tofu, but this was pretty good... I really liked the taste that the cilantro added.  It was pretty spicy (to me).

My main problem was consistency - but I'm afraid it may be my fault for not allowing enough draining time for the tofu and for using "soft" instead of "firm" (it was all the store had). My other issue was I only had a Heinz chili sauce... My guests seemed to enjoy it so I'll try my hand at it again.

I know the recipe doesn't specify but I recommend not using extra firm tofu, it's too bulky.  Maybe I'll try firm next time, but great flavor and easy to make, five stars!

I liked it better warm and eaten right away. To me, it didn't taste as good the second day, and the peanuts weren't crunchy anymore.

When I first tried this recipe I found the cilantro to be overpowering. Consequently, I've made the recipe a couple of times since without the cilantro, and I absolutely love this salad. The Chilli sauce makes it sweet, the tofu brings a savoury flavour, and yet it is wonderfully light and well balanced.

very very yummy.  I love cilantro, so this was a big hit with me.  I actually ate it all by myself over the course of a few days.

I'm revising my review (original review below)--I've bumped up the star factor by one because when I tried the recipe before I ate it hot over rice and it was pretty bad.  However, the next day I pulled the leftovers out of the fridge where it should have been all along and it was MUCH better than eating the recipe warm/hot.  I still probably wouldn't make it again, but I could definitely see someone with a really love of sweet chili sauce really enjoying this.

Original review 2 stars:  I was so bummed at how this turned out.  I loved it (tofu/peanut/soy sauce/garlic mixture) until I added the final sauce.  I knew when I was making it that 1/2 a cup of the sweet chili sauce sounded like way too much.  I don't know if a 1/4 cup would have worked better.  It really just was too sweet for me.  I also followed the advice of another reviewer and served it over rice.  I liked it that way too.

It's very easy to throw together, but I would suggest halving the sauce for the cucumbers. Too much at the bottom of your bowl. 
The tofu/peanut mix would be great on anything--5 stars to that!

We chopped the peanuts and didn't use cucumbers (since my husband doesn't like them). We mixed it all together and put it over lettuce. My 16 month old liked it too. It was even good the day after (but it got too spicy for my son that day). Yum.

This was a very refreshing salad.  I used lemon juice instead of lime since it was all I had on hand.  I also added 1 diced tomato for some color.
