Really good!  I added a little extra black pepper and seasonings.  Didn't have time to let it sit but good none the less.

Loved how simple this recipe is to put together.  The dried basil in the dressing was new to me.  I had a small portion of cauliflower and broccoli left, so I adjusted the other ingredients.  Because I knew we would have leftovers, I added the croutons to the individual salads before serving.  By doing so, the salad was still fresh the next day and additional croutons were added.  I love how much this taste like 24-hr layered lettuce salad, but made and eaten the same day.  I will definitely be using this recipe again. We had this salad with 'Buffalo Chicken Calzone' another AR recipe. Thanks for sharing, SFORD1024
