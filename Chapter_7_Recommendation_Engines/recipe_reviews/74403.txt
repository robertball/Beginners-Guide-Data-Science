My whole family ate every bit of this steak!  And, my husband is not a big fan of flank steak.  Even my EXTREMELY picky 3 year old asked for seconds!

I modified the recipe a bit.  

I pounded the steak, seasoned it w/ s&p and tenderized it with a light layer of fat free Italian dressing.

While the steak was marinating (1 hr), I fried small pieces of deli ham (instead of bacon) in Olive Oil spray.  With the ham, I cooked the mushrooms, onion and basil (I didn't have the chives).  I also added one clove of garlic.

I spread it on top of the steak, then layered 3 small slices of baby swiss on top, then rolled it up.

It was one of the best recipes I've made from this webstie!  We'll definitely make it again.

this is a good recipe for pinwheels.I could never find one.To the filling,I added a layer of fresh spinach leaves & sprinkled with parmesan cheese before I rolled it up. I also put the toothpicks in it to hold together BEFORE I cut it into serving pieces. Brush it with olive oil add S&P then put on a screaming hot grill

I really enjoyed these. I don't eat beef very often but I liked this a lot. The pounding of the steak was a bit of a pain and I wish I could have gotten it thinner. The filling was delicious. I uses garlic instead of chives and used peppered turkey bacon. I have leftovers.. yum!

Very yummy.  I used ideas I read in the other comments and added some chopped garlic and cooked the filling in a little bit if the bacon grease before adding it to the flank, I also added a few slices of swiss.  My grill wasn't working so I stuck the slices in a roasting pan on a flat rack and baked for 30 minutes at 350.  The steak was cooked medium rare.

This was a pain in the  to make.  However, it IS different from your ordinary flank steak.  My husband liked it so I guess that's all that matters.  I enjoyed it but I think if I ever make this again, I'll quickly saute the mushrooms in the bacon grease before combining with remaining ingredients.

Turned out just as I was hoping it would!  A bit put-zy to assemble, but a wonderful success, both in flavor and presentation, for a special dinner with friends.  We secured each with a toothpick soaked in water and grilled  them on foil in case they fell apart, but they held together well.

Awesome, the only thing that I changed was that I did not slice the steak until it was done grilling.  Very easy to make also, but looks like it took a long time!!

In all fairness to the recipe, I used some flank steak which had been in the freezer for a while.  I had a sore arm from trying to pound it out thinly, and it turned out very tough, even though it was cooked medium rare...but the filling was tasty.

I have made this for multiple parties and it has been a hit every time. Even my friend who hates mushrooms was asking for the recipe.

Really liked this recipe. Thanks for sharing! The only thing I added was garlic. I put the mushrooms, green onions, basil, chives and garlic in the blender to chop it up finely. Spread that over the pounded meat and topped with the bacon. Then rolled it up and sliced. I brushed with Olive Oil and seasoned with salt and pepper and then placed in a very hot pan under the broiler for 2.5  mins each side. Gave it a nice sear on the meat and cooked to a mid rare.  It was perfect!  I served with Parmesan & Spinach Orzo.

was good - marinated in Italian dressing prior to stuffing. Did not cut up until served.

My entire family loved this meal. I took some of the ideas from others posts and added 3 cloves of garlic and some spinach. My children did not even realize they were eating a vegetable! I also cooked the entire roll and cut it into pinwheels after cooking. Worked much better for me.

This tasted good, but it was tricky to keep it together, and quite a bit of the filling dripped out into the grill and created a smokey mess. I probably won't make these again.
