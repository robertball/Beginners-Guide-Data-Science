It was excellent but I altered the recipe. I eliminated the curry and added 1 tsp of cumin 1 tbsp of chili powder and 1 tsp of crushed red pepper. Instead of breasts I used thighs and drumsticks. My sons and college buddies ate it all and wanted more.

As written it was three stars.  I made the sauce as written first, except using only a 1/2 teaspoon salt, so I could taste it and for us it tasted very bland.  1 tablespoon of salt would have made it waaay too salty.  We like dishes with lots of flavor and I knew for this group I would have to spice it up more.   So I increased the mustard, added some chili powder, worcestershire, and cider vinegar.  These tweaks probably brought it to four stars.  It would still require more tweaking.  I'm not sure I try this one again.

Ended up with some nice chicken but not very barbecue like. We reduced a few of the quantities of the ingredients including the salt and the chili sauce. The end result looked quite a bit different from the photo but it was tasty and we enjoyed it.

SUPER tangy. I m not sure if it s because I used fresh lemon instead of the store bought or if it s just supposed to taste that way.
