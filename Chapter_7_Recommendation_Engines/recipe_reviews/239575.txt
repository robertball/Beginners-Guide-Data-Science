I was looking for an easy way to use nori and this is it. Quick, easy, fast, and nori is full of health benefits. I used a pastry brush to add the oil, and cooked them about 7 minutes because I wanted them a bit crunchier. Thanks for the recipe!

I tried this recipe almost exactly. I had to use canola oil instead of olive oil, but it was perfect! Just the taste my hubby and I were craving (and I'm 8 months pregnant!) I am definitely keeping this recipe for a later date, maybe even tonight!
