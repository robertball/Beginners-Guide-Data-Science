This was just great!! Although I did change it a bit. I put in 1/2 c. Apple cider vinegar instead of the red wine. I didn't have celery, so I used 1/2 tsp. celery seed, instead.  I didn't brown the meat but put everything into the slow cooker. Turned it on high in the morning and it was ready by supper time! Very good! My parents, 9 siblings, a friend and I all enjoyed it very much! Thanks!

Delicious! My husband often had oxtail stew growing up in South Africa, and wanted me to find a great recipe to make some. We bought just over 2 lbs of oxtail, and followed the recipe with just a few minor changes. We kept the same amounts of all of the ingredients, except I used 2 cans of stewed tomatoes instead of 1, and I added a few cloves of diced garlic, and one parsnip and one turnip, also diced. I didn't have 12 hours to wait for it, so I put it on high for the first 2 hours, then turned it to low, until the vegetables were added, and turned it on high for about 2 hours again, and the last hour or so was on low. It was perfectly finished in 9 hours instead. Husband and (somewhat picky) son loved it.
