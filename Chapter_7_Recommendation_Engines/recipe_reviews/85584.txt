Great new way to prepare Pork Ribs. After reading other reviews, I browned the ribs in the oven at 400 degrees for 10 minutes on each side to help reduce the fat content.  This worked great as I had no fat anywhere left in the sauce at the end. I then replaced the ketchup with bbq sauce (don't like ketchup), reduced the water to 2 tablespoons. I didn't have any celery seed so elimated that along with the sliced onions and red bell pepper.  I also rotated the ribs halfway through the cooking to make sure all were evening covered. My husband absolutely loved them (we had no leftovers!!) Thanks MITCH103 for a new and easy way to prepare bar-b-que pork ribs!!

Wow!!  This is great.  I made it last Sunday and my husband requested it again this weekend.  He is telling everyone about it.  What is great about the sauce is that it is slightly sweet and tangy and has the perfect spice to it as well.  I use Frank's hot sauce which is tangy as well and quadruple the amount.  I also substituted teriaki sauce instead of worcesthire (as my husband hates it).  I didn't have celery seed and eliminated it.  I do think it's better the same day.  I pre-boiled my ribs to get rid of the fat and boy do you!  It also cuts down on the cook time.  I leave it on high for about 15-20 min and then turn to low for the remainder of 6 hours.  Yummy!  I did not feel that the onion and pepper overpowered the dish.  One warning!!  Make a double batch.  It's so good that you will be disappointed if you don't.  Also - You can use half the water.  Thanks for a great recipe.

After reading the other reviews, I added a simple first step ... I boiled the ribs for 30 minutes ... that fat made its way to the top of the water and not into my slow cooker ... lots of ingredients here, but absolutely great flavor ... too easy not to do again ...

This is the best tasting bbq sauce ever.  I have done it with pork chops in a slow cooker, shredded pork, chicken.  I can now just put the ingredience in without measuring and you can't mess it up.  It seems like a lot of stuff but it takes no time to whip it up and pour it in.  If your out of one of the spices it still comes out great!!!!

I too noticed that this produced a lot of fat... It's pork afterall.  After 8 hours, I took out the meat and shredded it.  Removed the sauce and separated the fat.  I threw all but the fat back in the cooker and let it marinate for 30 more minutes.  Perfection!

Absolutely AMAZING! This was my first time eating ribs, let alone making them and I think I'm hooked! This recipe must be great because my ribs had been shoved to the back on my freezer and were horrifically freezer burnt. They came out of the slow cooker falling apart, moist, and tasting amazing. I skipped the peppers/onions and had to use regular mustard when I realized I was out of dijon. I boiled the ribs for 30 minutes and didn't see an ounce of fat in my sauce when these were done. I cooked the ribs on high for 1 hour and on low for 5. Perfection! This is such a great recipe; I'll be recommending it to everyone! Thank you!

This recipe was fantastic. The meat was so tender it melted in your mouth. My husband and I really liked the sweet & tangy flavor. It was a nice change from the  traditional barbecue sauce. This recipe is defintely a keeper. Thanks for sharing your recipe. Didn't change a thing it was perfect as is. Thanks again.

i used bbq instead of ketchup because i can not even stand the smell of ketchup. this was very good! did not have to cook 8 hours tho, i only cooked 6 and it was perfect! (i did brown them on each side for 10 mins in the oven on 400 first, like an other reviewer recommended, and cut back on water).

I've made this a couple of times and it's really tasty and easy. (I add a little cornstarch near the end to help thicken the sauce.) I leave out the bell pepper too.

There are lots of such slow cooker bbq ribs recipes around but the sauce is one of the best I've ever tasted. It's sweet, tangy and spicy. I read some reviewers steamed or boiled the the ribs to get rid of some of the fats. Well my advice is grill away the fats and it's tastes fantastic! I got the idea from another recipe. I put the ribs under the broiler for 6 mins each side. Watch the fats melt out and the meat gets charred slightly. Looks n tastes great!

Excellent. I only made one small change and that was using half barbeque sauce (to use the last of a bottle I had in the fridge) in place of some of the ketchup. Because I did not have pork RIBS, I used pork CHOPS. My husband, two kids and I inhaled this. We all were "mmmmming" all through dinner. GREAT paired with potato salad and green beans. Very, very tasty. This is going in my "make again" pile. NOTE: Oh! Because I did not have celery seed, I did use Beau Monde seasoning which technically is a mixture of celery salt and onion powder.

There aren't enough nice things to say about this recipe.   The sauce on this is better than ANY barbecue sauce.  I need a bigger slow cooker!!

I love this recipe!  Easy for weeknight suppers.  I like to put my own spin on things so here are the changes I made to the sauce:

-replaced the red wine vinegar with apple cider vinegar (I prefer it)

-replaced both the chili sauce and hot sauce with two tablespoons of Siracha (added a hint of heat which was nice)

-upped the amount of Worcestershire sauce slightly

-replaced the garlic powder with one whole garlic clove, finely chopped

-blended the sauce together with my stick blender to get a nice consistency

Even my 15 month old loves this pork dish and he detests most meat at the moment!

Wow, what can I say but this is amazing.  I used an Asian chili garlic sauce but left out the 1/4 tsp of hot sauce and it was delicious.  I also steamed the ribs in the oven for about 45 minutes to help reduce the amount of fat and it worked great!  The steaming also helped reduce the slow cooker time about 5 hours.  This is definitely a keeper!!!  Thank you for posting!

I hate to be the one giving a bad review here, but.... I didn't care for this at all. My fiance ate what was on his plate, but I think he did so because he didn't care for any of the sides I served with with dinner (it was BBQ night at our house - BBQ pork, Spicy Southwestern Slaw, Mom's Mustard Potato Salad & garlic bread). :( It was the sauce that snubbed me. It wasn't bad, but I've had better (sorry!). For one, I found it to be way too sweet. Since Western-style ribs were on sale this week ($.99 lb.), I chose to use them instead of boneless country ribs (but mine were bonless also...). I cut each rib in half and then boiled for 20-30 minutes as others suggested. My sauce was not greasy at all (a plus), and actually thickened somewhat! My only other change was omitting the red pepper (I didn't have one, it seemed out of place and I don't like the taste/texture of cooked peppers anyways). All in all, this was OK, but nothing to write home about. When I want ribs, I'll just grill 'em. Thanks for sharing anyways, What a Dish! :-)

This is a wonderful, flavorful recipe !  I made it first with the country style ribs and it was so good I decided to try chicken.  WOW !  It was awesome with boneless, skinless chicken breasts. I left out the water and was glad I did.  The pork had just enough fat that if I would have added the water the sauce would been too thin.  I made up the sauce the night before added my meat, sliced a vidalia onion and red pepper into rings and put on top.  Marinated it over night in a sealed tupperware bowl.  In the morning put it in the crock pot so the peppers and onions were on the bottom and put it on low.  When we got home from work 10 hours later the house smelled so good !  You can adjust the seasonings to make it more or less spicy which is great because we love spice so I upped the tabasco and garlic powder.  This would also be great for grilled chicken on the grill.  I am going to try beef roast next for bar b que beef sandwiches !!  Thanks so much for this recipe !!

This was super simple and delicious.  One kid always has to be difficult, but he ate it and the rest of us LOVED it.  I made it per the directions except that I used a Splenda blend of brown sugar.

WOW!!! These were fantastic! We were working cattle and I needed something that I could throw in the crockpot and have ready when we were done. I made enough for all the workers which was about 20 and boy did I get rae reviews. This recipe is definately a keeper!! I was worried when I started making them that they were going to be spicy but I was presently surprised. They were great!  Thanks for a great recipe!!!

Yummy! I went a little light on the spicy stuff, and skipped the red pepper. I also added a bit more water, because it was going to be in the pot for a little more than 8 hours; this turned out to be unecessary, as the sauce was a little thin. Excellent flavor though, thanks for the recipe!

AWESOME! I read the reviews and boiled my ribs before putting them into the crock pot to reduce the fat...it practically eliminated it! I also added a little cornstarch at the end because my sauce ended up pretty thin, but otherwise this recipe is a total keeper!

This was amazing!!!  I used 1/4 cup of apple cider vinegar instead of water, used Sriracha chili sauce and more hot sauce and it was sooo good!!  My whole family loved it!  The pork was very tender.

Both sweet and tangy as promised.  This is really good. I thought some of the pieces of meat could have been cooked for longer as it was still a little tough, and we were sorry to not have trimmed the fat off the meat before it went in the cooker, but the tender pieces were sooooo good.  Loved it served on white rice as the sauce heats up watery and delicious.

Had my doubts that this would be enough sauce for the pork chops, but in the end it all worked out well.  It was a very good dish which I will make again.

Loved the sauce.  Did not add water as we like it thick and know the crockpot adds water to itself as cooks. Did add a few red pepper flakes. Son wants the recipe.  Thanks.

Quick, easy recipe that my husband and I loved. We used a pork loin roast instead and omitted the celery seed (simply because I didn't have it) and it turned out great! A definite keeper.

After reading other reviews I reduced the amount of sauce by 1/3 and boiled the pork for 30 min to reduce the fat content. I didn't have the celery seed, or the green peppers (I substituted green pepper sauce). It turned out great-everybody raving about my first attempt at bar-b-q. Thanks for a winning recipe-I'll be using it again.

This was excellent, I left the water out, and I added some tomato sauce instead  the sauce was a very runny, but that's the way all crockpot stuff comes out for me so it's likely not the recipe's fault  I served this with corn on the cob, my kids and husband loved it

This was a winner at my dinner table!  Instead of using ribs, I used boneless pork chops.Couldn't find any ribs that weren't real fatty, so I opted for a healthier choice. I cut the chops into strips and passed them off as boneless ribs.  Also, I omitted the water as other commented it was a little to runny.  Even without the water, the sauce was a little thin, so I took the cover off the crock pot for the last 45 minutes and it did thicken up on it's own.

Very good. To reduce the fat I boiled the ribs for 30 minutes in water and trimmed them of excess fat (much easier after they firm up a bit from the par cooking) before I put them in the crock with the sauce. I used bone-in country style ribs but by the time they were done, they were falling off the bone tender and delicious. I will definitely make these again.

Very good.:) For our tastes and a suggestion: Up the brown sugar just a bit, and add a few teaspoons of liquid smoke. Also, if you haven't tried jack daniels brand dijon mustard, I think it is wonderful, and was very good in this recipe.

Not quite barbecue, not quite swiss steak style meat either. This turned out tasty though and we would eat this again. I used beef country style boneless ribs. This was so simple to fix and then just let the slow cooker do all the work without heating up the kitchen. Thanks for a nice meal.

I boiled the pork for 30 minutes, scraped off the fat, and saved the water I boiled it in as broth for future soups/recipes. Also, I used half ketchup, half BBQ sauce and substituted half of the chili sauce with fresh jalopeno. Yum yum!

I made per the recipe except I omitted the bell pepper and I browned the ribs for 10 minutes per side at 400. I used a vidalia sweet onion. The sauce was really tasty, but the ribs were pretty dry. I guess my ribs were leaner than most or I browned them too long.  Next time I will reduce the browning time. Served with baked potato and green beans. I will definetly try this one again.

Great recipe. I used a pork tenderloin roast, shredded the roast, boiled the juice until it thickened and added it to the meat. Served it on hard rolls. It was a hit! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

5 stars for simple prep. Only takes a few minutes to dump all of the ingredients into the slow cooker and you can improvise with an ingredient or two depending on what's in your pantry. 4 1/2 stars for the meal. The only thing I might do different with it is to take all the juice after it's cooked and thicken it with cornstarch to make it thicker. That would make the tasty sauce stick better to the meat and rice. Great flavor. Slightly sweet (but not too sweet), slightly tangy (but not too vinegary), and slightly spicy (depending on the chili powder and I added a few red pepper flakes).

The taste was great but it was too saucy.  It was more like a stew.  I would definitely use the sauce again, just not in this way.  Or maybe cut the sauce in half.

I too boiled the meat for 30 minutes as other reviewers suggest. The sauce is quite tasty and the meat just falls of the bone. If you are looking for a thicker "stew or chili" like sauce this isn't it - it is more like soup but very good. I wouldn't call it all that sweet though which is fine with me but hubby wanted a sweeter taste. But that all can be adjusted the next time around. He can also just add more sugar to his.

I used boneless pork chops to lower the fat content from using ribs.  The only change I made was using whole-grain Dijon mustard instead of smooth, since I think the flavor is superior.  The chops came out great, and the sauce was very good.  Thanks for sharing this one!

It fell off the bone but that wasn't a good thing. I used county style ribs and I washed the meat before cooking but as we ate we had small pieces of bone in the meat.  It was as bad as eating fish having to pick bones out of my mouth. Not sure if it was due to the cooking so long or what. I wont be making it again.

This dish was O.K. but it has alot of ingredients to it and I think it is much easier just adding a bottle of your favorite B-Q Sauce.  I did not think it was that awesome to have to go through the trouble of mixing all the ingredients.  Will probably not make again.  Sorry

I'm afraid we didn't like this at all. The fat from the ribs had slow-cooked out into the sauce. Maybe if you didn't eat it and somehow took out the meat, strained out the onions and peppers and put the sauce into the fridge so that you could remove the fat and then reheat the whole thing the next day, then maybe it would be ok.  But far too much work - wasn't crazy about the taste either.  Sorry.

What a super easy and delicious recipe!  I used this for bone-in pork chops, amazing sauce.  I did follow previous reviewer suggestions and used 1/2 BBQ sauce and 1/2 ketchup, perfect.  Otherwise followed to a "T".  Definite do-over for easy-peasy weeknight dinner.  Thanks for sharing with AR!

I'm not sure what I did wrong, but the ribs were very dry!  The saving grace was the sauce which was flavorful.  I forked the meat like pulled pork and threw it back in the sauce to absorb more moisture.  Then, I poured it over rice and it was ok.

Sooo good! I omitted the hot sauce, used celery salt instead of seed, used 3 1/2 pounds of boneless country style ribs and used a green pepper  instead of  red. I cooked on low for four hours, then turned the ribs to make sure all were coated. At that point I added the onion and green pepper. Then I cooked on low for another two hours. Perfect, fall apart, flavorful ribs! Next time I will boil the fat off as suggested by others.

This was a great recipe and I did boil my ribs first for about 20 minutes. It definitely helped with the fat. However I had cooked them for 8 hours and they turned out a bit dry. I think next time i will bring it down to 6 or 61/2 hours. Overall my 6 year old ate up her plate and asked for seconds! So in my book still a winner . Thanks again

Fantastic! The ribs turned out so tender, moist and flavorful. I preboiled the ribs for 30 mins. as others suggested. I also doubled the sauce because the recipe called for 2 pounds of ribs and I had over 31/2 pounds, and I did not put in the green peppers, because I didn't have any. I made the recipe exactly as stated otherwise. Will definately be making this again. Thanks for posting!

Awesome!  I used a pork roast and made some minimal changes (omitted the red pepper- just didn't have one on hand- subbed maple syrup for the sugar, used regular white vinegar, and used fresh crushed garlic rather than dried).  It was awesome.  We had boiled red potatoes with butter as a side dish.  We will definitely make this again!

My family loved this recipe.  When I made this I didn't make it with ribs, I took a 4lb pork loin and doubled the recipe for the sauce, but followed it exactly otherwise.  Just before serving, I took out the loin (it was falling apart but not too bad to remove anyway) and then strained the sauce into a saucepan, added a little extra hot sauce, brown sugar and cornstarch to thicken the sauce up.  I shredded the pork and then served the thickened sauce on the side.  Super easy, very yummy and much better than any bottle sauce we've used to make crock pot pulled pork.  Served the pulled pork on buns with a side dish and it was great!  We have enough to feed our family of 6 for two meals and will be making this probably at least a couple times a month.

This recipe is a regular in our dinner rotation.  I'm not a big fan of pork but really like it in this recipe.  I usually leave out the onions and peppers and love the way the flavors of the sauce get infused into the ribs.

This sauce is unbelievably good.  I did as another reviewer suggested and preboiled the ribs to cut down on the fat.  Now I want to try this using pork chops.  Thanks for posting a terrific recipe!!!

So sorry, but we didn't much care for this recipe.  The taste of the sauce wasn't bad, but the onions and peppers were just too intense and not very appealing once it was served.  I think the sauce would have tasted better had it not been overpowered by the peppers.  I will not make this again.  Sorry 'bout that! :(

Good flavor-tender ribs. After the 8 hours the sauce was watery ( I think I should have trimed more fat from the ribs)so I removed the ribs from the crockpot and cooked the sauce down to half in a saucepan on the stove and put all back in crockpot. Family really enjoyed this one.

This recipe was very good, I enjoyed it immensely very very good barbeque. I did based on others comments trim a bit of the fat off the ribs to cut down on extra fat in the sauce. Turned out great with that as my only added step. Thanks for a great recipe!

The only  thing I changed was that I used ground red chile paste instead of chili sauce because that's what I had. It gave it a nice, spicy heat. These were done in 7 hours. Delish! Definitely adding this recipe to my keepers!

My hubby loved it, I however found the pork way to dry. I used boneless country ribs, cooked it as described in my crock pot for the designated hours and it was very soupy from the veggies so I took it out of the crock pot for the last hour to cook off some of the liquid and to caramelize the onions and peppers the sauce was amazing but the meat was very dry. Would have worked better with a fatter cut of pork.

My husband raved about these ribs and what I good cook I was (thanks to this recipe).  I followed the recipe except I only had about a half coup of ketchups left so I used spaghetti sauce for the other 1/2 cup.  Followed the recipe as written otherwise.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  We will be making it again.  UPDATE:  After pulling leftovers out of the freezer and reheating, they still taste great.  The sauce is really good.

The guys kept giving me thumbs up throughout the meal because they were so busy chowing down, they couldn't speak. This is our new favorite slow cooked pork recipe. (Thanks for the tips about rendering the fat by parboiling for 30-min. Worked a charm.)

my husband loved these, I did not. He said 5 stars, I said 1, that's why I rated them 3 stars.  He says he would order them in a restaurant, I said if I got them I'd send my meal back :-)  I cut off all the fat and parboiled them 20 minutes so they weren't greasy but they were still just plain weird.  I used 3/4 c. BBQ sauce and 1/4 c ketchup to cut down on the ketchup flavor and they were still very tomato'y and oddly spicy.  My opinion - you'll either love 'em or hate 'em.

WOW! Had to modify recipe to my pantry and PHENOMENAL DISH! I only had 1/4 cup ketchup, so i substituted the rest with the chili sauce, and had to top THAT off w/ some hunts bbq sauce, maybe 3 Tbsp.  Also just had brown spicy mustard, and no celery seed but cel salt...and fresh garlic.  1/2 an onion and no bell pepper later, and voila!  It was still super delicious!! Thanks

The flavor of these ribs was good, but I am not a big fan of the country style ribs I guess, I was trying to give them another chance, but it was not for me. Although I do believe I will be keeping the recipe just for the bar-b-q recipe to use on other choices of meats. Thank you.

This was the best Bar-B-Q sauce I ever made!  I didn't use the chili powder, was afraid it would make it too spicy.  My family absolutely loved it!  I am going to try it on chicken also.

Really Good. I substituted celery salt for celery seed and no chili sauce. The sauce was really thin and I only cooked it for 6 hours and they were great. I should have added more peppers and onions.

This was not one of my favorites. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of not having celery seeds so I used celery salt. The ribs were moist for sure but the sauce was runny and I didn't really care for the flavor all so much.  It had a lot of ingredients for the sauce too.

I was looking for a good bar-b-q sauce. And this was it. We are not pork eaters, so instead of the ribs, I used a 2 lb london broil roast. After 10 hours in the crock pot, I shredded the beef and put it back in the pot with the sauce for another half hour. This was delicious as pulled beef. I will definitely make this again.

This was amazing! I used red, orange, and yellow peppers, increased the chili powder by half, and omitted the chili sauce because I didn't have any. What a great meal to come home to! Served with Crock Pot garlic mashed potatoes from this site.

Bodacious! Used regular vinegar, mustard, & green pepper. Cooked sauce separately. Increased chili sauce to 1/2 c. & brown sugar to 1/4 c. Dash hot sauce. Did I say I followed a recipe? Best sauce ever. Great on pork, chicken, etc.

Great recipe.  Everyone enjoyed.  I added a bit more hot sauce as we like things spicy.  The sauce was runny as stated in prev. reviews.  Just took some sauce out of the crock, mixed it with the chili sauce I had, added brown sugar and hot sauce.  Made a great side sauce.  My family insisted I make more for later.

Cooked this on Sunday and loved it.  Lots of ingredients, but very easy to throw together and the flavor and tenderness of the meat was well worth it.  I didn't have red bell pepper unfortunately, but used one red onion and one sweet onion (I doubled the recipe) and it was plenty good.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I used apple cider vinegar instead. Also used 1/4 tsp. Of cayenne pepper instead of celery seed. Also, I didnt have chili sauce so I left it out and used a little extra ketchup. Still tasted wonderful!

We used a pork loin and we did not add the chili sauce but we added about 1/2 cup of bar b q sauce since it was a bit too tomatoy. With the pork loin, low for 4 hours is perfect.

Made the sauce exactly as listed - delicious. Had to add a little water towards the end as it got a little thick. My only change was that I used a  pork tenderloin to reduce the fat. I cut it into chunks and browned it before putting it in crock pot with sauce. Great reviews from family!

So good!!! I had to make a few changes due to what I had available in my pantry. I didn’t have a bell pepper so wasn’t added. I used hoisin sauce and some hot sauce and added everything else the recipe called for. It was delicious

I made this for the first time today and my husband LOVED it, his new favorite! The sauce is delicious! The only changes I made was that I left out the Dijon mustard (because I don't like it) and I was almost out of ketchup so I ended up with about 1/2 cup and just used what BBQ sauce I had on hand to make up the other 1/2 cup. I served this with coleslaw and baked potatoes. Yum!

Tasted very good but the sauce was quite greasy. I skimmed the fat and thickened the sauce with cornstarch.  Next time, I will brown the ribs before putting them in my slow cooker and reduce the cooking time.

great flavor !  I've had a hard time finding a crock pot recipe that wasnt full of sugar or barbecue sauce.  This was a  nice list of ingredients where i easily swapped out the ketchup with low sugar Heinz Ketchup.  I used a little molasses in place of the brown sugar and other than that, i followed the recipe as written.  My whole family enjoyed it.   The sauce did end  up thin but i used a slotted spoon and served them open faced on bread.  I will definitely make this again.

This is the best BBQ sauce I've ever made.  I've always just made my own sauce and I thought it was pretty good though a little on the sweet side.  My son asked me to make some that wasn't so sweet so I tried this one. I didn't think I was going to like it but I will use this recipe from now on. Rave reviews from my family!

Good but better recipes out there.  Needs smoky flavor and needs to be thicker.  Wouldn't make again.
