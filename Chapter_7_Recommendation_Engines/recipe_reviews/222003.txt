My daughters made these with friends, and they were SO good. The girls made a second batch leaving out the currants and zest and adding chocolate chips. I hear they were delicious. I said HEAR because they didn't last long enough for me to try one. Highly recommended.

These were delicious scones, moist and perfectly flakey.  We made these scones for a tea party shower.  Instead of currants we used craisins in one batch and chocolate chips in another.  One batch we just left plain.  Since we were having a mixture of various types I didn't want them too big so I cut each rectangle in half before I cut the triangles giving us 24 scones in each batch. The scones were plenty large enough after that cut.  We also made them the weekend before, cooked them almost done (about 15 minutes for us) and then froze them.  On the day of the shower we took them out of the freezer to defrost.  We then cooked them for another 5-7 minutes to finish cooking and heat them up nicely.

I have a different recipe that uses cream that my family loves...but we forgot to buy some and I looked for a recipe that used something else. I chose this one. It is different than scones with cream. These ones were less dense and more of a cakey center. The outside was crisp. They were delicious. My family thought they could be a little sweeter, but that is a personal preference. Soaking the currants made them pop a bit. My other recipe didn't call for that step, but I will be doing that from now on. We will definitely be making this recipe again.

Wonderful recipe.  I did not have currants.  I used blueberries and lemon rind.  To the other half of the dough, I added mini chocolate chips. Bottom line, the recipe of the dough is perfect.  You can add other fruits or choc chips in place of the currants.

Perfect, moist scones. I did not have currants so I used dried blueberries with pleasing results. I love lemon so I will double the lemon zest next time, but these are wonderful as written. Thanks for sharing!

Love this recipe.   I roll 1/2 of recipe into flat rectangle, spread with soft butter then sugar or cinn. sugar.  Cover with raisins or choc. chips.  Fold 1/3 over then the other 1/3.  Slice. Tuck in sides before baking.  If you want to use orange marmalade tuck in 1 side & place open side up & top with tsp. orange marm. Really with mini choc chips & org marm.  Don't use strawberry as it burns.

I've made these a couple times with different ingredients. This recipe makes a GOOD amount of scones. I like mine a little bit sweeter so I added a 1/4 cup more sugar. Because this recipe calls for almost 5 cups of flour, I think it really needs it. Also, I have an aversion to buttermilk. Don't know why, just always have so I used a light cream. Also I did a small drizzle of lemon juice mixed into powdered sugar for a really light glaze . Kicked this recipe up another 10 points.

These were so awesome. I subbed an peeled, chopped apple for the currants and threw in a handful of chopped pecans. Yum! Update: I've made this three times since my first time. Awesome every time. I personally think that they need to be cooked for 21 minutes in the oven, but that may just be me. I've just about got the recipe memorized now!

Excellent! My family and friends love these scones. I add about two tsp of pure vanilla extract with the buttermilk. Also I just use plain coarse brown sugar to sprinkle on top, though I may omit next time because lately I've been finding them too sweet. I also cut them a bit smaller because they increase in size a lot while baking (and they back for the same time in my oven, 18-20 minutes), so in the end I usually get about 20-25 scones, perfectly sized scones for snacks with tea. My mum spreads everything from cream cheese to honey to peanut butter on them, I just take them plain. I store them in the fridge and for anyone else who does and has had a problem with moisture, putting a paper towel on the bottom and between any layers really helped. I've made these every two weeks since finding this recipe seven months ago.

Great scones-I veganized it by using Earth Balance Butter and soy milk with a tablespoon of vinegar for the buttermilk.

So wonderful!!  I made them with homemade butter and homemade buttermilk and used cranberries as I was out of currants.  They come out so moist and soft; these are insanely awesome!

I just made these for a Christmas Tea I am hosting. I only made one change and that was to use heavy cream instead of buttermilk. Being from England I just am more familiar with using cream in scone recipes. Other than that, they were amazing! and I will keep this recipe for future use.

Made 1/2 the batch with raisins soaked like the currants, and 1/2 with chocolate chops.  Delicious,  Although next time I would use two cookie sheets, as these kind of merged during cooking into one giant scone.

For those who have never use this recipe before... There is a technical typo in amount of butter to add. Somehow, I get 2 lines of 1 Tbs butter. I know it wasn't and notified the company, but this seems to exist...

Excellent!  I cut the recipe in half, left out the currants (I didn't have any), added about 3 Tbls. of poppy seeds (I have to use them up) and about a tsp. of lemon extract and about a 1/2 tsp. orange peel powder.  Best scones I ever had.  Great recipe!

Used the basic recipe to make date and chocolate chip scones. Substituted the currants for half a cup each of chocolate chips and half a cup of cut-up dates. Cut the sugar to a third of a cup and omitted the sugar on top. Thought that they would be good with buttermilk in the ingredients - and they are!

Made again - this time as per the recipe except, not having buttermilk at hand, I used Greek Yogurt.  Just as delicious.

I've made this recipe many times and they are a hit with family and friends. I use blueberries instead of the currants and increase the zest (but I love lemon desserts). The recipe is versatile and can be altered for  many different flavors (try maple walnut- just add some syrup to the buttermilk, use walnuts instead of currants, omit the lemon and glaze with a powdered sugar and maple syrup icing). Thanks for one of my go-to recipes!

Easy-to-make and delicious scones! I used all of the zest from a small lemon (a little more than called for in the recipe) and I enjoyed the rich lemony flavour it gave the scones. This recipe makes a lot of scones (I got about 20 round scones), so I will halve the ingredients next time I make these.

Excellent recipe! I've been looking for this kind of scone recipe--moist, buttery and not too sweet. It came together nicely after I stopped the mixer twice and used my spatula to bring all the dry stuff up from the bottom. I didn't have much luck with the long rectangular shape though; the scones came out too long and skinny.  I like a shorter, wider scone better, so I will go back to a squarer shape to start with, or circles.

Increased dried currants to 1 cup and added fresh blackberries on top. It is delicious.

These are delicious.  Just made a couple of small changes.  I made cranberry/currant scones but followed all other directions.  I omitted the sugar on top just because I prefer them plain.  Baked at 400 for 12 minutes only as my oven cooks quickly.  I did a double batch and yielded 28 of them.  So easy to make.

I was very happy with how these turned out.  Don't be tempted to skip soaking the currants.  I thought that mine were fresh from the store and moist enough, but soaked them anyway, and glad I did.  Makes them better in the scone, fresher and moister.  Note, the recipe has 1 cup of butter, then 1 Tbsp butter, and more butter for topping.  I presume the 1 cup and 1 Tbsp go together, but I missed that extra 1 Tbsp when making the recipe.  I might use a little more lemon zest next time, just my personal taste.  I used a 12 inch square scone pan.  The recipe made these 16 scones plus another 4 more. Next time I will just do it like the recipe says on a baking sheet.  Easier than my way.

I made these with white chocolate chips and craisins and substituted sour cream and 2tablespoons of cream for the buttermilk.  I didn’t sprinkle sugar on top as we don’t like them overly sweet.  Turned out great gone before supper!

I used fresh currants instead of dried and they were very sweet and moist and lemony.

Just a very light brushing of butter on top will suffice, if required at all.  Use currants, altho dried cranberries are fine. Lime  juice mixed with powdered sugar makes a nice light glaze. Eat cold. There is no sheet quite the right size for fitting two circles onto, so have fun with that.
