Tasted amazing! I used a little less spinach, and it was a bit peppery. But I was still able to enjoy it very much.

I used fresh basil, oregano and a Roma tomato. I added some chili paste and used onions and minced garlic to saut√©. I added dry white wine to deglaze the pan and added William Sonoma chicken stock at the end then wilted the spinach.

We tried it and it was just eh. Right before tossing in the spinach I tasted the sauce with a tiny bit of chicken and it was super bland. I added a dash more salt and garlic powder, but it was still just eh. The chicken was tender and juicy, but there was no WOW in the overall flavors.

Made this for my son and he ate it, but he was not enthralled. Not sure I would make it again. To be fair, though, he cannot eat onion or garlic, so I left those out. Perhaps someone who tries it with these ingredients will disagree.

I added extra garlic powder and a bit more of each of the seasonings, as other reviewers found it bland. I wish I hadn't added the water, as the dish needed a thicker sauce. Perhaps tomato paste would have helped. I would possibly make this again using fresh garlic and the tomato paste.

The chicken was ok.  I didn't really care for the herb blend.  I think I would have been better off just using a premixed Italian seasoning blend.  The spinach however was fabulous.  I would give it 5 stars and will be making it again as a side dish.
