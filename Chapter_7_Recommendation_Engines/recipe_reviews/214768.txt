They were very good, and different!  Here’s a tip I came across recently:  to finely chop your ground beef after cooking, use a pastry blender.  It’s perfect for this!

I had guests for dinner and needed to come up with something tasty for dinner with ingredients on hand. I was unsure if they would actually hold together without something to bind them other than melted cheese. To my surprise they held together nicely. I did add a bit more in the way of seasonings (Italian) and I made my own marinara sauce rather than using something already prepared. I used 2 lbs of ground beef and 2cups of cooked rice to yield 21 approx 3" diameter meat balls. My friend said she thought it tasted like lasagna in a meatball.  I served seasoned green beans, a green salad, and hot dinner rolls as an accompaniment and it was plenty. Thanks for a nice easy meal.

DELICIOUS! I did saute some onion and garlic in a little olive oil before adding the rice and water to cook, which added another dimension of flavor. Also, I actually had some pizza sauce that needed used up, so I went with that. I do know that pizza sauce is usually more heavily seasoned than regular sauce, so maybe that's why I didn't feel any other seasonings were needed, as others have mentioned. I was glad to see that these were baked instead of fried, because my usual recipe calls for frying and this was a nice change. Anyway, the flavors of these were great, they remined me of a cross between pizza (I guess from the pizza sauce) and lasagna. Wonderful recipe that I will be making again, for sure~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

These were pretty good. They reminded me of little lasagna balls, even though it was made with rice. It would have taken quite some time, but I made a pot of rice in a rice cooker the night before. I used 2 cups cooked for the recipe, as 1 cup uncooked=2 cups cooked, according to on-line. I always keep 'best marinara sauce yet' from on here in the freezer and used that. It is the perfect sauce. I put them on a large foil lined sheet and got 12 balls. I used a 1 Tablespoon cookie scoop and did 4 level scoops per ball. And, they were a generous size! I had to bake about 5 extra minutes to get slightly crispy. The only change I would make is using 1/2 of the bread crumbs, as about that much did not get used. Thanks for the delicious meal change this week.

I've never had a rice ball and was very curious to try this especially since they're baked and not fried! This went over really well with my family. My toddler even dug right into it and cleaned his plate!!! I followed the recipe exact, except I used Italian bread crumbs because thats all I use. I used my cookie scoop and it made 25 balls! Way more than we needed but we'll eat the leftovers for lunch this week :-) I baked for 30 minutes than put the broiler on high for a few minutes and they were nice and crispy!! We didn't find these bland at all! I used Prego traditional sauce since we had some leftover that needed to be used! Served with texas cheese toast. Thanks Queenbee28, I'll def make these again!

Really interesting twist on something that looks like full blown meatball. My husband down them like crazy. He said they were pretty good. I took a nibble in the beginning stage after I had mixed the cooked rice, ground beef, seasonings, sauce and cheeses....I did feel it needed more of a zest flavor. My sauce was just a traditional jar of pasta sauce, so I know I could have used something that was more vibrant in flavor. I think that really is the key too this recipe. All in all, it was really good. I used a cookie scooper to make perfect balls and the batch made exactly 30. And I double dipped or double coated the balls in egg and (seasoned)bread crumbs. This was a total delight. Will make this again...that can also be a great football party appy as well as a main dish. Nicely done. I'm impressed.

We really liked these. The only thing I changed is that I added a generous pinch of dry Italian seasoning to the cooked beef mixture before forming the balls. I used Panko bread crumbs because that is all I had. Mine did not brown up too good (could have been the Panko) so I just stuck them under the broiler for a few minutes. This is one I will make again. Thanks for sharing!

I thought these were so good.  I tried them after reading the "to the point"reviews.  I never rely on the "makeover" recipes because the whole point of following a recipe is to try it out, not remake it.

These are really good!  Per other reviews, I added additional spices (oregano, basil, garlic powder) after I browned and drained the meat.  To break up the meat into even, small pieces, I always use a wire potato masher as it browns.  After the 25 minutes of baking they weren't quite brown enough for my taste so I put the broiler on and watched them closely.  Pulled them out of the oven and let them set up for about 15 minutes before putting the sauce over them.  A nice change from an all-meat meatball!

WOW! I've finally found a recipe that contains rice that my husband actually likes (he really doesn't care for it). The only things that I changed was to cook the garlic after draining the meat so that I didn't lose any, add a bit of cayenne pepper and a bit of Italian Seasoning. This one's a keeper for sure.  Thanks so much for sharing!!!!

When I read this recipe I just had to try it.  I did use one pound of ground round.  The prep time for me was longer than 15 minutes but well worth the effort.  These are unique and different!

Fun and super easy recipe with good results. Kids loved them, Hubby and I thought they were just a tad bland. I tasted the mixture before rolling and decided to add dry Italian Seasoning and use Italian Seasoned Bread Crumbs. Son said they reminded him a little of the filling for stuffed bell peppers. All agreed that with a little more seasonings, this will be requested often. Thanks for sharing!

Loved them!!! After reading all the reviews, I did add a little Italian Seasoning and Garlic Powder to the rice/beef mixture. I used Panko Bread crumbs, because that is what I had on hand. Served with a wonderful Tomato Basil sauce. Hubby and I both loved them! Re-heated in the oven the next day and the outside got even crispier. I think I would actually make them a day ahead next time because the flavor got even better!

These were surprisingly good!! I added a little extra seasoning, per the other reviews, and a little hot sauce cuz that's how I roll. When I went to roll the mixture into balls, I tasted it (I actually had a bowl full of the mixture for lunch) and added what seasoning I thought it needed. It was way too hot for me to roll, and very squishy, so I stuck it in the fridge for an hour. After that, rolling it was a BREEZE. I put the rolled balls in the fridge till closer to supper, then rolled in and egg wash (egg and water) and then plain breadcrumbs I seasoned up and mixed w/ a little oil. I baked them and then sauced them as I served them. (2 balls on the plate, then a spoonful of sauce) That way the leftovers weren't all saucy. To reheat, I nuked a couple balls for 3 minutes, then put in the toaster oven on the LIGHT cycle. Nuked a little sauce and drizzled over. Perfectly crispy! That was my breakfast this morning. These would be a GREAT place to hide veggies for picky kids. Next time I might do half beef and half italian sausage and call them pizza balls.

Delicious. Made a few changes. i doubled the recipe. Added a tsp of chicken boullian to the rice water to give it some flavor. Microwaved a box of frzn spinach and drained. Added some onion, italian seasoing, and lemon pepper/salt seasoning to the ground beef. Drained the excess oil and added the spinach. I didn't have any mozzarella cheese...used what I had...some parmesan, romano, and queso fresco. Made 14, 3"-4" sz balls.  From another reviewer, I dusted flour on the rice ball before dipping into my eggwash. Baked for 25 min and broiled for about 7 min, came out perfect. Since I flavored the rice, I enjoyed it without the sauce, but it was still delicous with it.  Husband loved it, so did my 7 yr old who hates eating veggies. Will definately make again.

I have not even tasted these yet - but a few of my co-workers have and everyone loved them. I made some changes . . . I used 3 c cooked rice, 1 lb ground  turkey, because that's what I had on hand. And I added 2 ribs celery, 6 baby carrots, and 1/2 a vidalia onion to the turkey, as it cooked (just to sneak in some veggies). Because of the extra volume of the meat and rice, I doubled the cheeses. After reading other reviews, I added 2 tsp Italian seasoning to the meat mixture, also. I used the full cup of bread crumbs (whole wheat bread that I had on hand - that I ran through my food processor and let sit out to dry overnight) and also added ~ 1/2 c parmesan cheese (from the green can - all I had left), 1 T granulated garlic, 1 T onion powder, and 2 tsp Italian seasoning. I am not big on pasta sauces, and so did not bring any to work with me - the only halfway negative comment I received was that they needed more sauce - but I would have brought sauce, if I had realized I was going to be sharing my dinner instead of eating it! Can't wait to hear what the kids have to say!

I made some modifications and doubled the recipe thinking I'd freeze half for the future (more on that later).  I used 2 c. of a leftover brown rice blend, one lb. of 85/15 ground beef, reduced the cheese to about 1 1/4 c. TOTAL of mozz & manchego (no parm on hand), added an egg to the mixture to help bind it (I'm glad I did; decreasing the cheese meant it wasn't holding together particularly well), browned the beef w/o oil, drained it, THEN added the 4 cloves of garlic & sauteed for a few seconds.  Thanks to other reviewers, I added about 3/4 tsp. each of oregano and basil.   I only used 2 eggs for the egg wash and used seasoned bread crumbs.  I used an ice cream scoop and made 18 meatballs total.  So much for freezing some for the future!  My husband ate 8 (!!!) and we had a total of 3 left over -- which mysteriously disappeared before dinner the next night.  My sister made it, using 1.5 lbs. of beef and her family nearly ate every meatball, too (she stopped counting how many her 3 yr. old ate).  I don't know how this could feed a family of four using the standard recipe.  I'll make it again, and soon.  It's time consuming, but if you split up the work it's easily done in advance.

I used half ground chuck/half Italian sausage, and seasoned with lots of garlic, onion, and Italian seasoning. I even cooked the rice with seasoning, so it would be flavored all the way through. I assembled this early in the day, and had to stop myself from "tasting for seasoning", lest I wouldn't have enough left for dinner! I left the mixture refrigerated for a couple of hours, then made the meatballs. I then left them in the fridge and just had to bread and bake them. These could easily be made a day ahead of time-- & with a few modifications to the master recipe--5-star delicious!

This recipe is a little vague and contradictory on how much it actually makes so I'll offer this up first: I doubled the recipe and got 40 approximately two inch meatballs. I found them a bit on the bland side overall, so I would advise seasoning as you see fit. I really liked the crisp bread crumb coating. They reheat well and make good leftovers, but you do lose the crispness of the bread crumb coating. Thanks for sharing this unique recipe.

Hubby and son gave them a big thumbs up! I thought they were a little bland and they kept trying to fall apart on me. Maybe a little too much sauce on my part. After refrig they held together enough to cook and they do have a good flavor. Maybe a seasoned bread crumb would help. I got 8 balls out of this in the 2" range. Good recipe all in all! Thanks.

My kids and I loved this!  I made slight changes to make it healthier and more flavorful...added chopped onion to the garlic; used brown rice; used Jennie-O brand Italian Seasoned ground turkey; added a bunch of chopped spinich to the ground turkey mixture; added ground flax seed to the mix; used Trader Joe's fat free Organic Spaghetti sauce; used Panko bread crumbs. 
The result was a fun, crispy, tasty meal, served with a tossed green salad!  My two boys (6 and 8 yrs) asked for seconds, and I had to actually cut off my older son from eating more!  The next day I asked them what they would like for lunch and they both quickly responded, "last night's leftovers"!  I doubled the recipe and froze the extra rice balls for a future quick and easy meal.

My whole family loved this recipe!  I made it exactly as it states with the exception of using quinoa instead of rice b/c it's healthier and I had it on hand. Delicious!!  I am adding this to our staple dinner list!

I think these were pretty good.  I think it just reminds me of the insides of a stuffed pepper. It's important to add enough salt and pepper, otherwise they are quite bland.  I'm undecided if I will make these again or no.

Very good recipe.  I used the meat mixture and layered it between no cook lasagna strips and added my favorite veggie.   Oh, so good. I also used a thin layer of ricotta cheese. I baked this in a casserole dish 350 degrees until bubbly.   Thanks for the recipe, Queenbee.

Made these yesterday for my mil! They came out very good. I used a blend of Italian Cheese and a sausage and peppers sauce. I also used a whole pound of ground beef. I enjoyed them. They were definitely something different!

These were delicious! I used closer to a pound of ground beef and kept everything else the same. I rolled them in 3 inch balls and they were perfect. The whole family enjoyed them, even my little one. Thank you for a great recipe!

My hubby is a rather picky eater. At first he backed off when I told him there was mozzarella cheese in them (it bothers his stomach)...but upon being told there was only 1/2 cup in all of the Rice Balls, he dug in!!! He liked them a lot! There are only two of us, so I froze them (w/o the egg & bread crumbs). This will make a future quick meal. The only "trouble" I had was that they didn't brown so I had to turn on the broiler. The next time I make them I'll form them into patties rather than balls...becase it will be easier to "flip" them so they brown on all sides.

VERY simple, VERY good. VERY inexpensive!  Before reading reviews, I had upped the hamburger to 2# and added Italian seasoning to garlic saute.  The only other thing I did was to put them in a cupcake pan to bake (the size I made was perfect for it, and I got 15 balls out of a doubled recipe), and lightly sprayed the pan and tops of balls with a cooking spray to help along the crisping.  I will definitely make these again.  I used a slightly cheaper cut of meat and the rice really stretches the dollar.  All in all, about $7.00 fed a family of 4 adults and 2 children, and I have leftovers!  Thank You!

These were great! We had company and they loved them as well. I used brown rice, ground turkey, oregano, basil, panko for bread crumbs and added spinach to make them a bit healthier for my kiddos. These are great to add all sorts of veggies in like grated carrots, pureed cauliflower or broccoli ect...Will make again!

This is a very delicious and creative recipe, but it did need to be spiced up just a bit for my tastes. I added onion salt, season all, and then added seasonal and dry italian seasoning to the bred crumbs I dipped the balls into. I also had to cook the meatballs for longer to get them as crispy as I liked. Yet, what a fun and delicious recipe Queenbee28! Thanks for sharing!

My family LOVED this recipe!  Add some veggies like bell peppers and mushrooms and you can't even tell.  Great way to hide the veggies (whichis how we roll in this house...lol)  Anyway, highly recommended.

We had these last night and my wife loved them.  I thought that they needed a touch more seasoning...maybe a little soy sauce in the rice water before making everything.

Yummy, decided to try these for dinner tonight and they were a hit with everyone from my 12 month old to my sometimes picky parents!  I added a package of frozen chopped spinach (thawed and the water squeezed out) and sauteed some onion with the meat. Otherwise kept the recipe as written and it was great.

Excellent dish.  It was fairly crispy - I would have liked it more crispy but couldn't leave it in the oven any longer without it burning. I think next time I'll mix a little oil with the bread crumbs and use that for a crispier coating. I would also recommend that a good quality pasta sauce be used.  I didn't and the dish suffered for it. I halved the recipe but could easily have fed three people with the results.  I'll make this dish again with the adjustments mentioned.

These were rated 4 stars by the family.  A little bland, next time I will add spices to mixture as others have suggested. Being the first time I made the recipe, I felt I should follow it exactly. I believe these would be well received at a church or school luncheon were you were cooking for a large group.

These were very good! I used the 1 pound package of ground beef and left everything else the same except for adding a little more mozzarella cheese to compensate for the extra beef, and a pinch of Italian seasoning. I also used the Italian seasoned bread crumbs. Thanks for a great recipe!

My husband and I liked this dish very much.  It is a nice change of pace from our usual fare. I prepared the recipe exactly as written which made 10 balls for us.  This dish is more filling than I expected.  I served it with a simple tossed salad and red pepper soup which was an excellent combination.  My husband rated the dish between a 4 and 5, and I concur.  The next time I prepare this dish I would add Italian seasoning for a little more flavor.  Thank you for sharing.

These are good, and were easier/quicker to prepare than I thought they'd be. They were a bit on the bland side though. I'll make them again, but will add additional seasoning to the browning beef, and I like the idea another reviewer had of making the balls around a cheese centre; the cheese already in the recipe got kind of lost in the balls, didn't taste it. They did hold together very well though and were tasty, so thanks for the recipe!

This is a delicious, easy recipe.  I did not change any of the actual ingredients - only the amount of rice.  I cooked the entire cup of rice but only used about half of it in the mixture.  I used my COOKIE SCOOP to make the meatbballs - easier not as messy with a  much better end result.  Will make again.! Thanks Queenbee28 for sharing.

This is an intersting recipe..as i was preparing it I thought...this will never stick together to form 2 inch balls, let alone a SOFTBALL SIZE??? (the creator noted she makes em that big??  yikes!) I added my own garden fresh herbs to the meat and everything looked and smelled wonderful ...until I started rolling..no way! they barely held on!  Then after i carefully set them on the pan and chilled them... they were a bit better...until I began to dip and roll in the crumbs! no way Jose!  I was thinking, it might be the basmati rice I use which is not a very sticky rice. so I took all the glop and formed the balls with the egg mixture and crumbs mixed in then coated them with more crums.....also next time I make them, I am going to do it that way,...because I really like this recipe, I like rice and ground beef together like this.  I just cannot figure out how all y'all didnt have trouble making the balls stick!  AH! Thanks for the idea, though ..The balls are in the oven and I think they will be wonderful!

This is a fun way to eat on a tight budget!  I used 1 lb. (we like ours more meaty) ground turkey instead of beef, 1 c. of Target's Italian blend cheeses instead of parmesan AND mozzarella (pricey), and then I added a 1 oz. packet of ranch dry dressing mix to add a little flavor...I also used Progresso Italian Bread Crumbs... - my family loves it and it's become an almost weekly meal...with garlic bread and salad as sides, it can even be served to guests!

These are just alright. Very time consuming and not even worth it. The balls were hard to form and kept falling apart. I even started over making them by adding more cheese to make them stick and they still fell apart. My fiance enjoyed them, but the next time I make them it will be a Sunday night dinner. Much too time consuming for a weeknight meal.

These were very  good. I made 20 kiwi sized rice balls. I think you get way more than 4 servings from this, probably closer to double that.

I had to make somwhat major substitutions for our diet, but was able to maintain the same idea. Ground turkey in place of beef; stove top stuffing in place of bread crumbs; tofutti cream cheese in place of mozzarella and Parmesan. Lovely recipe. My husband gave it a thumbs up.

Yum!!!  These were so good.  I have never cooked the beef before making meatballs but I love the fact you don't have to worry if these are done on the inside.  I used Emeril's jarred marinara sauce with them and it was delicious.  Also, if using the large pampered chef scoop, you get 13 balls.  Definitely a keeper!

These were pretty good. I thought they needed more flavor so I added garlic powder, oregano, and basil. These made 10 large balls for us, and it was more like 6-8 servings. I ate one and was full.

I think these would benefit from less rice and more ground beef.

Having the 17yearoldboy sense of humor I do, how could you not love a recipe w/Balls in the title?  These have been on my to try list since the first time I saw them mentioned on the Buzz, but have just now gotten around to giving them a whirl.  I made them in 3 steps, browning the meat/garlic/onions one evening, boiling the rice & combining the ingredients & forming the balls the next, and rolling in egg/crumbs and baking the third.  The only changes I made were to use 2 lbs of ground beef with all other ingredients remaining the same, brown rice for white because it's what I had on hand, and Italian panko fore bread crumbs.  I also added some Italian seasoning and crushed red pepper to the mix.  We really enjoyed the crisp on the balls (baking time was pretty spot on, for me, though I'd imagine the panko helped).  The dipping sauce really makes this, so use a good sauce.   I'm looking forward to reinventing this for a take on stuffed peppers!  THANKS for sharing your dad's (rice) balls w/us, QUEENBEE!

Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Combined Turkey and Ground beef and seasoned with salt and pepper while the meats were cooking instead of later. Otherwise, we followed the plan exactly as recommended. Next time we plan to make personal size zucchini crust, put the balls on top and then cover with sauce.

This is very similar to a recipe that my Sicilian family has been making for years.  We add peas to the meat mixture and deep fry them.  I know it is more calories but that's the way grandma made them.

I really wanted to like these, but they were just entirely too bland. I felt like there was too much rice and not enough seasoning. We ate them with extra sauce and hot sauce, but I would suggest to others to add plenty of italian seasonings and red pepper flakes.

I'm a big fan. They taste so similair to regular meatballs but are much more economic and lower in fat. I'm disappointed that my husband wasn't more impressed with them, he just thought they were ok.

This recipe is amazing, and one of thee best I have ever made !!! I even took them to work to let some real Italian co-workers try them and they were a hit and all asked for the recipe. Making them again for when the in-laws come in town and very excited for them to try it. You will love this recipe....very tasty. Served it with salad and garlic bread and it was a meal !!! :)

Awesome!  I made a couple of changes based on nutrition/what I had in my cupboards, but nothing that comprimised the integrity of the recipe.  I used brown rice, whole wheat bread crumbs mixed with a little bit of toasted wheat germ, egg whites, and reduced fat/fat free cheeses.  Very impressive meal that got good reviews from the whole family.  Even my two-year-old rice-hating ds was shoveling it in.  Thank you so much for sharing a recipe that will be made often in my house!

This recipe is pretty good. I accidentally misread the recipe and added 1 pound of beef and they still turned out great. I added some italian seasoning to the pasta sauce and ground beef.

I loved this. The only reason I am giving 4 is because I did jazz it up and I think it made it so good. I added Italian seasoning to both the ground beef and tomato sauce. I also used tomato paste in both...which creates this tangy touch that is soooo good. The bf agreed the sauce was so good. I love the idea though and all though these are time consuming...they are worth it!

Great recipe. I used minute rice for a quicker prep time. Next time I will double the recipe for left overs the next day when I am working. I'll eat these 2 days in a row anyday! I did use tin foil on the pan for easy clean up, but do spray the foil as mine did stick a little. Thanks!

We had these for dinner tonight and they were yummy.  Followed suggestions of one reviewer and made them with quinoa and I was really pleased with the results.  Also added celery, onion, basil and oregano.  Froze the once they were formed into balls.  I rolled them in panko which I had on hand while they were still frozen and baked them for about 30 minutes.  They will definitely go into our list of favorites.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe.

Concept is quite good but definitely needs more flavour. For a second batch I mixed ground veal and ground pork and an Arbori rice and oregano. Tip; after forming balls roll them in kitchen towel to dry them ad then roll in plain or seasoned flour before dipping in egg wash. Egg wash provides better base for breadcumbs than plain egg.

Loved it! I used to work at an Italian Restaurant and the owner made these for his family. That was years ago and I forgot all about them. I'm so happy to be reminede, my family loved them and they were easy as well as economical to make!

Recipe Group selection of 1/8/11.  We enjoyed these as a change of pace.  I thought more flavor was needed in the actual ball so I added basil and oregano as I cooked the meat.  I had homemade pasta sauce in the freezer and used that.  I got 6 good sized balls from the recipe which was more than enough to feed 3 of us with a green salad and freshly made Italian bread on the side.  Thanks for an interesting recipe.

I thought I needed to double the recipe to feed 5 of us but it made over 30 big meatballs! Yikes:) No worries, I just froze 20 of them for a couple more meals. Anyway, doubling 2c of UNCOOKED rice makes A LOT of cooked rice. I should've just used 2c of COOKED rice, I think, but they were very good! Thanks!!

OMG!!! These were soooooo yummy!!! Admittedly, my Italian fried maks THE best arancini (period), but these give hers a SERIOUS run for the money! :) My only (minor) complaint is that I miss the texture of traditionally prepared, pan fried arancini. While slightly crispy, I had to spray with EVOO and bake an extra 10 minutes to achieve the texture / golden color I was looking for (FYI, it helps to bake these on the upper rack of your oven, close to the heating element). I usually tweak new recipes, but didn't feel the need to this time. Other than subbing pizza sauce for the pasta sauce called for (i.e. the 1/2 c. sauce that went INSIDE my rice balls), I made no changes. I needed to use up some leftovers in my fridge, hence the substitution. NOTE #1: To finely crumble your meat as directed, use either a pastry blender (per one reviewer's suggestion) or a potato masher. Since my pans are non-stick, I used my silicone masher. NOTE #2: Use an ENTIRE (26 oz.) jar of pasta sauce to ensure your arancini are completely covered. A cup and a half of sauce didn't cut it for me. A sprinkling of Parm and chopped basil (parsley would work too) are perfect garnishes. Garlic bread completed our meal. Thanks SO much for sharing your recipe, QUEENBEE! I'm definitely adding this gem to my keeper file. :-)

The rice balls are delicious and super easy to make. I used ground chicken instead of the beef just because that is what I had on hand.  I also added a tsp of italian seasoning as some of the reviewers suggested.  I doubled the recipe but I didn't have double sauce. I put half of the balls in sauce and had planned on freezing the rest.  I didn't really care for them in the sauce so I ate mine plain. My husband didn't care for this but he is rather picky. I will make the balls again by themselves.

"Definite keeper" was my hubby's response.  Followed recipe except used instant rice (couldn't tell) and made it vegetarian using Morning Star crumblers.  Also added 1/2 minced onion.  Next time I will add bell pepper and maybe shredded zucchini to give it a healthy element.  I love what another reviewer did by putting them in zucchini boats.  Sounds so good!  But was really good as written, not bland if you add salt and pepper or Italian seasoning with the meat and had no problem with them holding together.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good and versitile. Made a few changes such as sauteeing onions with the meat and using panko instead of breadcrumbs. You gotta taste before rolling into a ball. Mine lacked a little flavor. Now the versitile part: my husband requested
to do taco ball. I used mccormicks cheesy taco mix (yes follow the packet instructions) and follow the rest with mixing the rice then the cheese, etc.....seriously so yummy!

I made these for my husband, who is often disappointed with rice balls from local eateries. He loved them as did my kids! We added a 1/2 c. more mozzarella cheese and used whole milk cheese.

Fabulous, easy recipe for rice balls.  I have made these with hamburger & once I even added some milk italian sausage to the mix & they tasted so good! I make my own bread & make the breadcrumbs from that....They are so yummy, everyone in my family LOVES these, even my pickiest eaters....Thank you for a GREAT recipe.

They were pretty yummy as is, but I think a homemade sauce of some sort would complement the recipe.

These were OK.  Not sure they were worth the effort, my husband suggested just dumping it all in a casserole dish & sprinkling the bread crumbs on top.  I may try that if I make it again.

We loved these, but I made quite a few important changes that I think works better and cuts prep time almost in half:
I kept the pasta sauce out of the rice ball mixture and they were the perfect consistency to stick together in a ball and were very moist.  I also used brown rice and added onion, and skipped the refrigerating step.  Putting them in the refrigerator seemed to me a backwards step.  The balls were holding together fine so I went ahead and dipped them in the beaten egg and bread crumbs. Then I ONLY had to put them in the oven for 15 minutes and they were crispy! Way faster than if I would have followed the recipe.  It seemed to me, too many steps and too long of a prep time...these turned out great...don't forget to add salt to the ball mixture too, another thing I added.

I admit, I was shocked how awesome this turned out! I followed the recipe except I only had brown rice, doubled the mozzarella, and added a little more ground beef. I refrigerated them for about an hour. Cooked 1 hour at 350F and they were crispy and delicious. So flavorful! I didn't even need the extra sauce on top, but my husband liked it. I was a little skeptical at first but this reminded me once again to always try something new. This is also very budget friendly. Will go into my permanent weeknight rotation.

Very good.  I used ground turkey and Italian spices and did not have any mozzarella cheese so I used low fat marble.  I too had a hard time getting them to stick together initially.  However, they did firm up in the fridge and by the time I put them in the egg wash and then the bread crumbs and then baked them.   My 5.5 year old and 3.5 year old loved these as did I and I know my hubby will too.   The sauce made them nice as well.   We also did some steamed green beans with them which were great.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

Great recipe! The leftovers were a little dry so when I reheated them I sliced them in 1/2, turned them face down and covered them in tomato sauce and mozzarella, they were awesome! Thanks for sharing.

These were fun to make! I used ingredients I already had on hand; I used leftover cooked brown and white short grain rice. I doubled the hamburger and browned the garlic in butter. My husband said these reminded him of falafel. My five year did not care for these-I think because she couldn't tell what the ingredients were. I served these with tater tots and carrot sticks. Thank you for sharing this recipe!!

Fantastic.... added one carrot shredded to the rice/beef mixture to add a little crunch and a 'veggie' element to the mix!

I had to add extra seasoning to include italian seasoning to the meat mixture.  The balls kept falling apart and rolling in the egg and bread crumbs was a little difficult - but they were pretty good. Tomorrow for lunch - I am sure my family will gobble the rest of them up.

these were very tasty.  hubby and kids loved them.  will be making them again.   only thing i did different was to add more spices to the meat as it was cooking.   loved the parmesean and mozzorella cheese added to the mix... very nice touch.  thanks for this recipe.

These are really good, although my boyfriend and I felt that there was a flavor missing that we couldn't quite put our fingers on.... the rice/meat mixture needed a little more seasoning.  But even made as is, it was delicious.

Very tasty.  It required a lot of sauce, and made huge meatballs, but they were very good.  Noodles are not necessary with this recipe.

LOVED IT!!  I had my reservations but once we tried it - we ALL loved it!  We served it with MIDS Pasta Sauce (Meatless).  

I had actually had something similar from Carabba's Restaurant.  It was a new appetizer on the menu and there was smaller and made with Hot Italian Sausage instead of ground beef.  

I'm going to make it this way next time.  YUM!!

My husband asked me to review this dish. I prepared this for dinner and he totally loved it! I did not have enough Parmesan cheese, so I used Parmesan cheese plus cheddar cheese. I fried the meatballs in little olive oil instead of baking them, to save time. I also skipped the tomato sauce to serve. They were great! Another plus: you can leave the meatballs in the fridge and finish the recipe when you are going to eat them. I kept them in the fridge for 2 days with no problem.

These were really good! Based on ingredient list and other reviews, I used equal parts ground beef and mild Italian sausage. Perfect! No need for additional spices. Will make these again.

We have been making these for along time. Not softball size though, but golf ball size for spaghetti with sauce. great filler for nights when working late. Also great as a side dish for a quick and easy something to eat meal!

These are exceptionally good!! Also try rolled in breadcrums or Corn Flakesand baked...  called croquets.   Also ingredients used for stuffed bell peppers and steamed in double boiler or baked in covered deep dish, with a little water in bottom.

Super good!! Easy, fun recipe that both the kids and adults enjoyed. Have fun experimenting with them, fresh basil and crushed garlic toast in place of bread crumbs gave them an italian twist.

Loved them with the adjustments I made.....I combined this recipe along with the Italian Rice Croquettes by Chef John also on this site. Everyone complemented on this dish - I made about 30 of them and they were gone within 2 minutes! Served with three-cheese spaghetti sauce.

These were SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO good.  My husband couldn't stop eating them.  The changes I made: used minute rice since it's quicker, made with 93% lean beef, used part-skim mozzarella and added a couple extra cloves of garlic (love garlic!).  Even with the lower fat inqredients, it was delicious.  My only suggestion would be to turn the rice balls over once when baking since the one side got a little hard when cooking.  Although, it could be my crazy oven:)

Big hit at our house! But I'm too impatient to refrigerate them so I just start making them into balls once cool enough to handle...not too difficult! Totally worth the time put in!

Awesome! Varied your quantities to fit my leftover thai glutinous  rice and sub with panko bread crumbs. The glutinous rice is very sticky by nature so it worked perfectly. Hubyy is a happy man! :)

My family loves these.  I made them as is and was surprised at how easy it was to form the balls and how well they stayed together (the key is the melted cheese - it acts as a "glue").

Yum!  I followed the recipe ingredients exactly except I used seasoned bread crumbs this time around (too bland otherwise). These are yummy and filling. I've had trouble with the balls not browning though, so this time, I hiked the oven temperature up to 375. It still didn't brown the outside in 25 minutes, so I then had to broil for about 7 minutes. Perfection.

These were delicious! I forgot to put in the water into the mixture and was afraid they would come out too dense, but they tasted great. Next time I will add the water as I think the rice balls would be fluffier. Overall the recipe was EASY and yummy.

I enjoyed these and so did my kids (12 mo. and 2 1/2 years).  Unfortunately, my husband wasn't a fan of them.  I followed the recipe with the exception of adding some spices to the meat mixture.

OK, I am going to rate this on how I fixed it. I know it would be 5 stars fixed as written, but we are on a diet and I didn't want to use all the cheese. I had sticky sushi rice left over, so used that with a small amount of parmesan cheese. I used Italian seasoned ground turkey(1.25 pounds). The sticky rice held everything together nicely. I also had bread crumbs from a loaf of 3 cheese bread from the deli and I used that to roll on the balls. I also had leftover homemade pasta sauce, altho not enough to use for leftovers. They were very good and very filling. Once we lose this last 5 pounds, I will fix as written with brown rice and the cheese. It will probably send this beyond 5 stars!

These were loved by my hubby & 9-year old son, but not so much by me.  They took me longer than expected to make, too.  I'll do them again for family, friends, events, etc.  Just not for me personally.

Awesome recipe...first thought was making this as an appetizer for some chicken parmesean...but ended up being the main course.  I put garlic and onion powder into my rice cooker to give the rice a little extra something before mixing with the other ingredients.

OMG these things are SOOOOOOO awesome, served them with Newmans Own sockarooni sauce and it was the bomb diggity doo dah :) To add flavor to the rice I dissolved two beef boullion cubes in the 2 cups of water I cooked the rice in. I also added about 1/3 cup each of diced white onions and bell pepper to the ground meat as it was cooking. I dipped the balls in egg and rolled in breadcrumbs two times to give them a nice crusty outside.

Wow!  Something all the kids actually love and cleaned their plates in record time.   The prep-time/delay makes for an easy meal to make on the weekend and freeze the balls before baking.   Thanks for sharing :)

I emailed this recipe to my daughter to make for a small dinner party.  My daughter is still in the process of learning how to cook, however she is a picky eater and fussy over certain foods.  She told me that this was very simple and turned out wonderful, in fact she spent about 30 minutes on the telephone raving over this dish and the compliments she received from her dinner guests!    Well done, Tim, whoever you are, and thank you, Queenbee28 for sharing this recipe!

These were fabulous! VERY cheesy. I prepped these the night before so all I had to do was roll them in the egg and breadcrumb and bake after work. Definitely cut the amount of breadcrumbs in half as suggested by others. I am so glad to find an oven method of arancini instead of deep frying. I used leftover chopped up grilled Italians for the meat. YUM! served with a caesar salad with radishes instead of croutons and garlic bread. These are filling. 1 rice ball per person is plenty

These were really yummy especially with marinara sauce on top. I used ground turkey breast and white rice with a blend of italian cheeses. Just the right amount of cheese. Delish! Thanks for the great recipe!

It was delicious but to us was more like a meatball dish to add to pasta; which is what we did. We used ground chicken, brown rice, one egg to make it stick and extra mozz cheese. It wasn't sticking great so after all ingredients were added, nuked for about 30 seconds and it was perfect. Will definitely make again.

It's not eye appealing BUT it was pretty delish, the picky 16 yr old loved it AND the 6 yr old loved even after looking at it and before tasting it and saying "I don't like that, it looks gross". The sauce I would have a different sauce than I used (Traditional Prego I didnt like). I think actually a sauce that is NOT so thick or add a can of diced tomatoes to a tomato sauce?? I will make it again and I would recommend it to my friends! Also I'm gonna have to change the name of it too, sorry

This was really delicious!  I gave this 4 stars because 4 out of 5 family members liked these.  My husband & I both agreed that these should be one of our regular meals.  The only thing I did differently was use brown rice & added a bit of diced onion to the garlic & hamburger. YUMMY!

This is a favorite we will have again!  Living in Wyoming, I used ground elk.  I was worried about how well it would hold together since the elk meat has very little fat.  But it turned out perfectly!

This is one of the best meals I've ever made!  Made it for my husband and parents and my parents said this was better than any type of meatball my Grandparents made.  Didn't change a thing, but add oregano.  Delicious!  Thank you!

This was a hit on super bowl. I used 93/7 ground beef and right before it was done I added the garlic (xtra) and there was nothing to drain off. I made them the night before so all I had to do was bread them which was 1/2 seasoned 1/2 panko. Extra sauce was on the side for dipping but everyone liked them as is!!! 
Thank you QUEENBEE28!!!

This is an easy, filling, tasty recipe. I added half a finally diced onion and portobello mushroom cap. I will try Italian sausage to perk up the flavor a bit and maybe some hot sauce, I like things a little more spicy. Thanks for the recipe.

This was my first attempt at making rice balls - especially challenging as i had never tasted one! My son loves them so i thought i would give it a try. They were delicious and passed the test of his discerning palate. A keeper for me!

I used ground turkey instead of beef and added fresh parsley, basil and dried oregano.  I also used Italian seasoned bread crumbs.  However, after baking them for 35 minutes, they would not brown.  I ended up browning them in a skillet with oil.

This is a great recipe. I make it exactly as written.  I use fresh Parmesan and serve the sauce on the side which keeps them slightly crispy on the outside.  Sometimes I make sauce & sometimes I use jarred sauce- either way the rice balls are always delicious!  Thanks for the recipe

This was pretty ok. The family liked it. I added extra Italian seasonings in the breading. I also doubled the garlic because....well it's garlic. I used an ice cream scoop as suggested by commenters and that helped keep them uniform size. They were apprx 2+" in diameter.
I'm not sure I'll make this again unless my family requests it. I have a feeling they will. May be a good way to use leftover rice.

As an Italian girl, these are known as "Arancini". This recipe was very good and captured the flavor wonderfully. Made as written, but as usual I add extra oregano to everything lol.

Made these with leftover Spanish style rice, using cheddar cheese, pepper jack and salsa instead of parm & tomato sauce.  Used  the largest Pampered Chef scoop to portion and tucked a little cube of cheese in the middle (like arancini) before rolling into balls and chilling. I had no problem with breading with panko.  Balls kept their shape and crisped/heated easily in oven. I sprayed them with a non-propellant oil spray and turned them 2-3 times during cooking time. Served them with tortillas, avocado, salsa and sour cream.

These were delicious a couple changes I made though. First I added an extra half cup of mozza cheese. I used more water to cook the rice in 2 cups of water is not nearly enough to cook the rice in. I also took the rice balls out of the oven after 20 mins flipped them and cooked for an additional 10 minutes. Lastly I used around 3 or 4 cups of tomato sauce as a cup and a half barely coated half the balls. With just a few minor tweeks this recipe turned out very good. Thanks chef for another tasty recipe.

the ratio of rice to beef was not right for me. 1 cup rice to a half pound of ground beef was too much rice. the beef got lost. next time a half cup of rice to a half pound of ground beef. I also added oregano and basil when I added the cheese to the hot rice and meat.
And I seasoned the breadcrumbs too with oregano and more Parmesan cheese. I will make them again though this was a great starting point for something so yummy!

Yum, I asked on the buzz what to do with leftover black rice and some ground beef and someone pointed out this recipe. I had made a big pot of oven baked black rice and had leftovers. I added an onion to the garlic saute. I had a pound and a half of ground beef so I just eyeballed how much already cooked rice to use. Tomatoes are overflowing in my garden so I added one. I didn't feel like making a marinara type sauce so I just used a can on tomato paste and some water in the beef/rice mixture. Then made up some guacamole (had an avocado to use up) to dip it in. Not really traditional but we still liked it. It was a good tip to flip them halfway, otherwise mine also would have been hard on one side. They are also good cold and I made my husband a meatball sandwich for his work lunch. Thanks for a great new recipe!

I substituted chopped mushrooms for the ground beef to make it vegetarian.  I didn't find it too time consuming to make, I used the 20 mins to make the sauce while the rice balls were chilling.

4/2/18 Made these again, still delicious.  Recommend this recipe!  (Used leftover jasmine rice I had on hand and it turned out very well. )  Yum!

My family and friends love these. I also tried switching it up for a healthier version, I used brown rice and ground chicken. Either way , these are great. Thanks.

These were good & easy to make, but I don't know about for a main dish. Better for party food or something. It was more like a meatball which made you feel you were missing pasta. I'd serve as party food or app next time. Very yummy!

As another reviewer said- these are very time consuming and not worth it at all.  They didn't stay together at all and ended up coming out a bit soggy.

Made them according to the directions.  After 25 minutes of baking,the riceballs were not getting crispy so I sprayed them with some butter flavored cooking spray and left them in the oven for 5 more minutes.  They came out perfect.

This is the first time I've made these and I have to say that I'm really impressed with how they turned out. Reading another reviewer, I was afraid that they would fall apart when forming the balls, but I had no such problem. I used brown rice and added a few more seasonings (onion powder, dried oregano); but other than that, I followed the recipe as is. These were good enough to eat on their own! These would be great in smaller balls and served as an appetizer to guests; and I'm going to try the rice mixture as filling for stuffed peppers! Thanks for the recipe!

This was a yummy surprise for dinner.  I added some sauteed mushrooms and onions to the recipe and a little bit more marinara to the mixture. I did not have any plain mozzarella so I used a white cheese blend such as the pizza blend. Instead of using regular bread crumbs, I used panko seasoned breadcrumbs which gave it a beautiful presentation. Even the toughest critic at the table was pleasantly surprised at how fantastic the rice balls was and gave it a big thumbs up.

These were very good indeed; even my OH devoured his, and he's not very fond of rice-based dishes. I made only some minor changes to the recipe - I fried the beef with three small, crushed garlic cloves and a little diced red onion, and I added some garlic powder and a generous amount of salt and pepper to the bread crumbs. I didn't serve with extra sauce on top, as I felt that would have overwhelmed the flavor of the rice balls themselves. And that would have been a massive shame, because they were delicious!

These were fun to make and we really enjoyed them!!  I think I may have used a little more ground beef than called for but we liked the ratio.  I served Giada's tomato basil pasta sauce over them.  Thanks queenbee!

Even my husband who lived in Italy for 2 years loved these. However, the second time we made them we made little cheese balls in the middle. Certainly added to it, but great without too!

Absolutely delicious. Although, I will say this about them: if you're a texture person, be forewarned. My fiance and I were making these and to be honest, we were totally grossed out by how they looked, felt, etc before they were baked- to the point where we almost didn't eat them. SO glad we did, though- a keeper for sure.

I tried this because of all the rave reviews.  I was expecting something exceptional and it turned out to be just average.  My kids ate it, but they weren't crazy about it.  It was kind of blah.  Maybe if there was a higher meat to rice ratio and a lot more spices were added they would be better.  If you make this recipe make sure to add more flavor than called for.

They were OK. It took quite a bit longer to prepare them than QUEENBEE@* indicated and dirtied up a lot of dishes and pans. My kids and husband liked them. I doubt if I will prepare them again, BUT if I did I would put a tsp or two of italian seasoning in them. They were quite bland.

We had 9 people over for a visit last weekend  and everyone loved them. I followed the recipe but added some Italian seasoning to the beef prior to mixing with the rice and it was excellent as a main course (as soup loving Nicole suggested)  We'll do these again next month too!!!

These were delicious!!  The first time I made them I may have had a little more than 1/2 pound of beef.  The second time, I made them using crumbled turkey sausage and we liked it even better.  I use my home-made marinara sauce, and throw in fresh parsley and basil.  I used a mixture of panko breadcrumbs with seasoned Italian crumbs that were a finer texture.  It was fantastic!

These were a total family hit!  Filling and tasty and easy to tweak should you so choose.  I made them exactly as the recipe called for this first time but my husband and I already plan on trying them with italian sausage instead of beef, romano cheese, things like that.  Thanks QUEENBEE28 for this recipe!

Made these for my boyfriend and parents yesterday and received great feedback. I used ground turkey and mixed in oregano, italian seasoning, basil, thyme, minced jalapenos, chopped garlic, chopped onion, and a pinch of chili seasoning to the cooked meat. Then mixed in a combination of brown and white rice, mozzarella cheese, parmesean cheese, and a garlic herb pasta sauce . I had no problem forming the balls. I let them cool in the fridge for a half an hour before coating in the egg and bread crumbs.  I was able to form around 26 good sized balls out of the 1 1/4 lbs of turkey meat I had. Served with sauce, garlic bread, and a bit of rigatoni pasta. Plenty of left overs. Delish.

My husband probably would have rated at 4 or 4.5. I thought these were pretty good, but not amazing. Although maybe next time I'll add more seasoning, esp salt. I used pizza sauce in the balls and thought that would be seasoned enough. Also, I used a different sauce (one with artichokes--yum) to top them and that did make them taste even better.

Made 7 humongous balls the size of baseballs. Tasty, though. I wonder if you could cut down on the rice.

Not hard to make, must remember to GENTLY form balls, if you squeeze together too hard it will not stick.  My older son does not like rice, but he loved these.  I doubled the hamburger, and added 1/4 more of each cheese (my husband says it still needs more cheese).  My two younger sons didn't care much for them, but they each ate one ball.  I made 18 balls at about 1.5 inches, this was with 1 lb hamburger.

I really liked these but my husband and daughter weren't thrilled...but they did like them.  They were very easy to make and took little time and effort.  I will try this again in the future but may tweak it a bit with suggestions from the hubby.

I have never had to sub as many ingredients and have it turn out fantastic.  Didn't have but 1/2 c. rice, so added orzo to make up the cup.  Always use ground venison instead of beef because of lower cholesterol.  Didn't have any bread crumbs so used crushed saltines.  Didn't have the mozzarella so used a Mexican blend.  Used homemade/home canned spaghetti sauce.  Other than THESE changes, followed the recipe and it was wonderful.  Looks like it's time to go shopping to replenish my pantry!

The balls are very tasty. I added a few extra things to the recipe. I sauteed about 1 cup of mushrooms and mixed them in with the rice and beef. Also I added some spices to the tomato sauce.
Not sure my balls didn't want to get all that golden and crispy in the oven, but they still tasted delicious!!!

I made this last night and my fiance loved it. The only different I did, was to add a pinch of oregano and I used panko bread crumbs and deep fried them and then poured pasta sauce topped with cheddar cheese and parsley

These are so delicious and easy! I just ended up using the idea, and substitiuting a package of pork sausage, with my brown rice, then no cheese (lactose intolerant) and it was a a delicious gluten free, dairy free amazing dish!!

These were a hit and easy to make.  I actually made them in advance, stored them in tupperware, then did the egg/bread crumbs/bake when we were ready to eat them.  Also, I threw some diced onion and green peppers in with the garlic, used italian seasonings blend, and used the pizza sauce for making the balls and pasta sauce for eating. Can also make with Turkey burger.  Just awesome.

Made these for our Valentine's dinner last night and we both LOVED them!  I used ground turkey and brown rice (used the Oven Brown Rice recipe from this site to make it easy).  A bit of extra garlic salt seasoning, my own homemade pasta sauce, yum!  Served with asparagus and garlic bread.  Hubby said it's in his top 10 dinners of all time!

I have been making these for years and have known them as porcupine balls.
