This is one of my most favorite holiday fudge recipes. I do flip flop the oreo amounts and fold one cup of crushed oreos into the fudge and sprinkle the half cup of oreos on top. This is also fabulous with golden oreos. Sometimes, if I think of it, I'll also fold in some crushed candy canes for a peppermint bark oreo fudge.

Finally made this delcious recipe. The white fudge tastes like the middle of an oreo and to have the oreo pieces on the top just adds to the wonderful taste. I used a medium high heat and when it came to boil the candy thermometer was at fudge setting at just over the 3 min. mark. Will def. make again.

This fudge tastes just like an Oreo cookie, only ten times better! It was quite popular with everyone who tried it. I followed the recipe with the exception of not using marshmallow creme. I seem to always have marshmallows kicking around that need to be used up, so rather than buy a jar of creme, I used 12 large marshmallows. You can use mini mallows as well; 1.5 cups of mini's equal a 7 oz jar of creme. Curiously, my result was not bright white, even before mixing in the cookies - it was vanilla colored, maybe because of the marshmallows. Thanks for sharing the recipe, Lightedway! I foresee repeat requests for this next season :-)

Allrecipes video for this fudge says to use sweetened condensed milk instead of evaporated milk. This is an error. I can understand the reviews that said the fudge didn't turn out right and/or stated it was way too sweet. I've requested by email that the video be corrected but????
Pls consider giving the recipe another try using evaporated milk Thanks Lori

Too sweet?! Say what? IT IS FUDGE. :) I reduced the sugar to 2 1/2 cups, and used a healthy 1 cup crushed chocolate cream Oreos IN it and probably 3/4 cup chocolate cream Oreos on top. I find the perfect fudge temperature is 238 degrees F (it boiled about 4 minutes for me). If you don't have a thermometer, it is so worth it. I used to deal with the "soft ball" stage thing, now I just stir and stir until it hits 238 and voila! This is my new favorite fudge!

I have to say I was not sure if I would like it. But it is good. Sweet but good. I cut sugar by a half a cup. And when I make the next time I will use the finely crushed oreos in the mixture,and use the chopped coarse ones for the top of it. To me with just the 1/2 cup chopped in the mixture it doesnt seem like enough to me. or maybe I can just add more chooped and less topping. Either way it is all in how you like it. But I will definately make again

I would give this recipe 5 stars, 'cause it is that good, but, in my opinion after tasting, it is way too sweet.  Thankfully I cut back by 1/2 cup per a previous review, but, next time I will cut it back by a full cup of sugar (maybe more if it still makes a fudge).  The Oreo amounts, in my opinion, are backwards too.  I put the whole cup in to the fudge instead of on top and I think I would add more to suit my own tastes.  Very RICH, yummy fudge, taken in small doses!  lol

This didn't turn out well for me. I haven't made fudge in a long time. I've only made it a few times. But I've never had a marshmallow fudge not turn out. Still, I'm sure my lack of expertise in fudge making is to blame for this recipe's failure. It came out a little soft. My boyfriend and I both thought it had way too much butter. It made it seem a bit imbalanced. Like it was too rich in a bad way. I also made the mistake of using salted butter. The oreo and vanilla flavors worked well though. I would try this again with a recipe using less butter.

Super delicious and tastes just like Cookies 'n' Cream chocolate bars only creamier and with more cookie taste with the hunks of Oreo in there.  Mine turned out great with out a thermometer.

Incredibly sweet (however I like sweet so this was amazing)! I loved this fudge as I love Oreo flavoured anything  and the recipe is pretty simple (though you would have to go out and buy a few ingredients, making the actual fudge takes only 10-15 minutes). Unfortunately however, like other reviewers have said, the fudge is really soft so it would need to be in the fridge constantly. Making a batch and bringing them to a party or whatever would make them really melty.

This was absolutely amazing and fool-proof. Followed exactly. Cut in small squares as it is rich and sweet. I made this for my Christmas cookie tray, but I know my kids will want me to make this year round which isn't a problem, because it's easy:) So good!!

I was making fudge trays for two parties when I came across this recipe, I chose this one because it seemed different enough and people seem to like the Cookies and Cream stuff. So glad I made this. The family loved it. And it flew of the dessert table quickly. Creamy, sweet, and fabulous. I accidentally switched the oreo amounts, put 1 cup of chopped oreo's into the fudge and sprinkled 1/2 cup on top. Didn't harm the recipe at all. Very easy to make and it set up perfectly. I did set it in the fridge as I was running short on time and didn't have time to wait for it to set at room temp. Thank you for this recipe! I'll definitely be making this again.

Wow, this is WAY too sweet--and that was after following other reviewers' suggestion to drop from 3 cups of sugar down to 2.5. If you drop it down to 1 and 3/4c sugar, it becomes much more edible, and if I make it a third time, I will probably take it down farther to 1 cup of sugar. The marshmallow creme, white chocolate chips and crushed cookies all have sugar in them too, so there is NO need for all that much extra.

This was my first time making fudge, and I was happy I read the reviews.  I cut the sugar amount by a whole cup, and I found a site that had the correct temperatures for making fudge.  It was very helpful since fudge is a confection, and it explained all the chemistry of the sugar crystallization and temperatures.  Here is the site: https://www.ricardocuisine.com/en/articles/food-chemistry/400-for-successful-fudge-every-time .  It was very helpful.

Made this last year for holloween.  The only change I made at the time was just adding some orange food coloring.     It not only had holloween color with orange and black but it was amazingly awesome, and went quick.

Easy to make, though the written recipe did not match the video. I used evaporated milk and it set just fine. The fudge did taste like Oreo filling but that's the problem. For the first time in my life, I can say that a dessert is way too sweet. They only way it would be edible is similar to the picture above - buy an oreo crust and put a very thin layer of fudge on it. Me? I'll just buy Oreos.

Not a fan.  It was simple enough to make and recipe is very user friendly, but the fudge itself taste exactly like the filling of an Oreo and it's just too much.  Recipe gets 4 stars, but the fudge was just sickish.

This was a wonderful recipe- the fudge was delicious! The fudge base would be good with many flavors. If you don't like your fudge too sweet, then I recommend you use 2 1/2 cups instead of 3. If I could add anything to this recipe, I would add a crust (Oreo®), and then put a layer of whipped cream or some sort of filling and then the fudge. Overall, I absolutely loved this- definitely 'The World's Best Oreo® Fudge!'

I found this in the  All Recipes magazine and the only difference between this and the magazine was it used 2 cups of sugar.  Mine turned out great! Guess on the donees  with the boiling but it turned out great. I will make again.

I followed the recipe to a tee but this fudge never set for me. I made it last night and after a few hours it was still gooey, so I put one batch on the counter and one in the fridge. It made no difference - this morning it was all still fairly soft. It's super delicious and I'm hoping that it'll eventually harden up, but right now it has almost a thick frosting consistency and I'm not sure how to fix it...

This fudge was absolutely delicious! I made it according to directions, except I substituted vanilla almond bark for white chips because I didn't have them and the consistency and taste was still amazing. It was so soft and creamy; not at all grainy or crumbly like a lot of recipes I've tried. There was also no need for a candy thermometer and it turned out great; I even live in the very humid south and it was the smoothest fudge I've ever made.  There are only two things I would change about the recipe; many people said it was too sweet and though I usually have an insatiable sweet tooth, I wish I'd listened to them! Also, there wasn't enough cookie in the fudge. I'll definitely remake these with maybe a cup or a half less sugar, and maybe twice as many oreos. Everyone I shared these with said they tasted like a hundred scooped-out oreos and the whole batch disappeared in two days!

Easy to make, I have taken this recipe and instead of Oreo, changed up what I add to make different flavors, kids love it! It is my youngest favorite and has been on the holiday baking list for a few years now.

This fudge is really sweet  - like other reviews, I flipped the amount of oreos and put 1 cup of crushed oreos in the fudge and sprinkled the 1/2 cup on top. Will make this again.

Updated Review:
Was a hit at a potluck! Ended up being completely eaten! I highly recommend this recipe! Even though this recipe doesn't mention a candy thermometer, you should still use one if you're new to using fudge! The recipe doesn't seem to specifically mention temperature required...

Really good, but very sweet even after cutting a cup of sugar. Came out a bit soft, but that may have been my fault.

I saw this recipe on another site and the cook was Norwegian so I came here for further clarification of the directions. Anyhoozle the other site said to use 2.75 cups of sugar, so it seems to me you can cut back from 3 cups to even 2.5 cups.

This is sooooo yummy!! Tastes like the inside of an Oreo with yummy little crunches of cookie!! It is very very sweet and rich, but it's fudge... it should be!! One lil bite is all you need so make little giveaway bags for friends and family and they'll be thrilled!!
After reading  reviews and knowing my love for these yummy cookies, I uped my chopped cookie amount...I added approx 1 & 1/4 to the batter then I sprinkled about 3/4 cup over the top and to be honest, next time I'll add more to the inside!! I had a bit less white chocolate then called for and will do a bit less next time as that flavor was a bit strong. But a very yummy dessert!! Oh I also poured it into my quarter size sheet pan which I believe is 9×12 and it filled I nicely for a nice thick piece. :)

Ok, first off if you follow the recipe as written- yes, you WILL FAIL. It will be an unformed gooey mess requiring refrigeration! However, if when you are heating your sugar, butter, and EVAPORATED milk you use a CANDY THERMOMETER and heat until it reaches the “soft ball” stage (or around 237 degrees Fahrenheit) you will find that your fudge will successfully set as expected. As the recipe is written 3-5 minutes means nothing. Some people cook on high, some on low, too many variables to type out.  It is crucial that sugar reaches soft ball temperature in order to make fudge.

Aside from that huge missing piece of the recipe, the result is good. Yes it is sweet, it is fudge. It is supposed to be consumed in very small amounts. If you eat a brownie size square, it will be incredibly sweet. If you like Oreos and you like white chocolate, I’m sure you will enjoy a small bit of this.

My fudge didn't set because I did not cook it for long enough. If you are a novice to candy making like me, I highly suggest a candy thermometer. You don't want to do all this work and end up with a mushy mess just because it needed a few more minutes on the stove.

I'm giving this 3 stars though because it's just too sweet, even when I used 2.5 cups sugar. The oreos, white chocolate chips, and marshmallow fluff all have sugar so it ends up being overly sweet. I don't know if reducing the sugar any further would still result in fudge though.

Just finished making this recipe and as I was cleaning up, I noticed there was a "Cookies and Cream" fudge recipe on the inside of the evaporated milk label. It's the same recipe EXCEPT the crumbled cookies are supposed to be stirred into the white chocolate mixture and the crumbled ones go on top (which makes more sense to me) AND it's supposed to be made in a 9x9 inch pan which would yield a thicker fudge. Note that the photo shown has a bottom layer of what looks like dark chocolate, plus the garnish so that it appears thicker than it is going to turn out if you follow this recipe. I would happily have made it in the smaller pan. Very disappointed.

Fantastic exactly as directed! The only issue I had was with the Oreos not sticking to the top. Really press them in, otherwise they fall off. Looks beautiful, tastes great! My 7 year old son helped me make it.

I made this exactly as written.  It turned out perfect.  It is very sweet, as fudge should be!  I let the mixture boil until 234 degrees.  It set up perfectly and does not need to be kept in the fridge.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I think 4.4 would be more accurate. Sometimes, white chocolate behaves just so differently that I had a few qualms . . . but you know what? This fudge was da bomb. So unique. And, as another reviewed remarked, was a redolent homage to the very lining of an actual Oreo cookie.

While, I love fudge and have a huge sweet tooth, this was too sweet. Next time, I'll make it with milk chocolate chips instead of white chocolate. Between the marshmallow creme and the milk, it was a bit much.

really enjoy this recipe.  the ONLY thing I changes was substituting mint oreos for regular oreos :)

if you have a candy thermometer, it really does take the guess work out of making fudge.  as others recommended, 238 degrees is perfect.

Question - the main picture looks like three layers - recipe doesn’t indicate how that is achieved - anyone made it to look like picture? It sounds wonderful as is - just curious. Thanks

Super easy to make, so it was a good one to do with the kids. And tastes like Oreo creme! I kept the Oreos for the top in big chunks rather than fine crumbles for aesthetics.

I also flip flopped the oreos and it was really good. I refridgerated after it cooled also. Tastes great. Thanks!

I'm not usually a big fudge fan but my wife is so I made this for her birthday. Very good! I did subtract about 3/4 C. of sugar and I used semi-sweet milk chocolate chips instead of white chocolate. I also made an oreo crust for the bottom like in the main photo.

Absolutely simple and delicious. I might try using mini-oreos to top next time, instead of crushed. Just be sure to push them down into the fudge.

I think this has the potential to be good, but just by following directions, it was super sweet.  I would suggesting going down to 2 cups of sugar, depending on your taste. Also, the crumbled cookies need to be increase for full coverage. Otherwise I think this dessert could be very amazing with some tweaks.

I brought this in for work and everyone loved it!  Like another reviewer said, it definitely tastes like the middle of an Oreo cookie.

This fudge is amazing. Everyone loved it. My hubby is a sweet addict, so nothing is really too sweet for him. I made this to put on the goodies trays for Christmas. However, I had to make a second batch. The first one did not last more than two days. I gave out eight trays with this fudge on it. All eight asked for the recipe. Hubby said he hoped that this was going to be made more than once a year. I agree, and it will be. Thanks so much for the recipe Lightedway. Perfect.
