I found that the yolk separated from the whites during cooking, so that they started to cook at the bottom of the pan with the whites remaining raw at the top. Oh well, I turned often so it wasn't omelet looking, more like chunky scrambled eggs. But the flavor was delicious; substituted shrimp for the crab and added avocado.

As a huge fan and very frequent recepient of loads of Dungeness crab. Fresh, i.e., swimming that morning and cooked the same evening. This omelete is probably the best one I have ever had!.
I sometimes sustitute "Rumiono" brand sharp white cheese and/or an English Stilson. This is a local cheese manufacturer and willbe difficult, although not impossible for you  
Easterners" to obtain. Everyone knows that Northern California cheese is second to none and , hence, the difficulty to obtain.
I worse comes to worse and you can not get it, emeil me and I will ask the owner to oblige you.
Regards,
Gamechef

Really nice and simple recipe, although I found I had to half the cheese and added more crab meat and mushrooms. I also added some barbecue seasoning and and all purpose seasoning as I felt it was missing something...I was right!!
Would definitely make it again.

This was pretty good, I skipped the mushroom just because I didn't have any (very unlike me) but the omelet was good, thought it lacked a little seasoning, and this is from someone who doesn't season a whole lot.

Very good! I've made this several times now - I used various different cheeses and generally add green onions.

OMG!!!  This is the BEST EVER Seafood Omelet!!!!!  100% I will make this again and again!  I used crab claw meat and approx 8-10 small to medium cooked, peeled, and deveined shrimp, and Jarlsberg cheese.  I used a Ulu to chop the crab, shrimp and cooked mushrooms together.  The omelet came out super fluffy (like it does in fine restaurants).  Otherwise I followed the recipe to the "T" .  I would rate this a 9.5 out of 10.  Only change I will make next time is to set my electric stove top to a setting of 6 instead of 6.5 as it came out just a bit browned on the top.

The omelete itself was delicious: nice & fluffy, like a souffled omelte should be, but we all found the crab to be too fishy for an omelet filling.  Just the mushroom & Swiss would have been much better.

I made It slightly smaller,  added old bay seasoning.   I put it in a whole wheat wrap with tartar sauce and used a slice of Swiss instead.   Great for brunch

I made this for a late brunch and enjoyed it. I wasn't sure that I would like the combo of mushrooms, cheese and crab but it was quite good. Thanks.

Really good. My husband loved it too. The only thing that I changed was that I added avocado on the top.

The extra treatment of the eggs is worth the effort.  Very fluffy.  I added dill weed to recipe cuz it goes great with seafood.

I used the basis of this recipe to make an omelette - I would have never thought to separate rate the yolk from whites but now my omelette came out fluffy - the outside did brown too much and formed a crust - maybe I had too much heat or butter so watch carefully - I also added some all purpose seasoning- now happy I can make a proper omelette for my seven year old!
