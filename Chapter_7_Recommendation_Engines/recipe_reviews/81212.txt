Delicious! A great source of protein with a flavorful twist. I would recommend that you use much less olive oil, as the beans were somewhat overpowered by the taste.

Yummy and great for a side dish. I would definitely recommend that you use only enough olive oil to coat the beans really well. I thought that 6 T. was way too much.

These beans are SOOOO #$%&@#(#@$^ delicious!!! My photo doesn't do the flavors justice. I only used about 2 Tbsp oil which may be the reason mine didn't come out crunchy. Not sure. But I didn't miss the crunch at all. The seasonings were so great with these beans it didn't matter. This is absolutely going to be on the dinner menu at this house at least once a week from now on. I used Great Northern White Beans, but think it would be good with just about any mild flavored bean. I cannot recommend these enough. Thanks Amanda!

Very tasty!  I halve the oil and sometimes add a sliced red pepper.

Yum! Who knew? I never thought of great northern beans as breakfast, but this is a winner!  I tried a few different canned white beans and discovered that the small great northern beans worked best. I added garlic salt instead of the regular salt and ground rosemary.  This is on my regular rotation. My picky husband likes it too!

I LOVE this recipe. It is now my favorite breakfast.  I did reduce the oil to half, using only 3 TBS of olive oil, and reduced the heat to medium. Crispy and delicious.  I make this often

I thought these were just okay. The sage and thyme were fine, but nothing special. I think I'll stick to my regular recipe of garlic and chickpeas. And instead frying them on the stove, I coat them with a little oil and roast them in the (toaster) oven until crispy.

This was easy to make and tasted okay. Just make sure not to overcook or they end up too dry.

This is one of my favorite dishes because it's delicious and super easy! I, too, halve the oil. Additionally, I like to saute about a clove of minced garlic in the oil prior to adding the beans.

Made this as a side dish and wish it would have been the main dish. Delicious! Eyeballed the oil and added garlic, but pretty much followed the recipe.

Love it! Though just use the oil that you need.
