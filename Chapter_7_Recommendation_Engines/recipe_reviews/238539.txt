I'm rating only the dressing.  Having this on top of a taco salad to get rid of the shells.  Great and spicy!  All I had for chili sauce was sriracha, so mine probably doesn't taste quite right, but I'll take it.  That was my only change.  I used a homemade tofu mayo but that's technically still following the recipe.  Might wait to add the hot sauce until you taste if you're not into spice.

Very good. I would cut the onion salt in the dressing about 1/2.

We really enjoyed this.  Perfect for a summer meal along with taquitos or flautas.
