I am trying this today with homegrown plums a friend gave us. Hope it works! Will try to update later. Update: Very good! I like that this recipe didn't use fruit pectin. I didn't have the cardamon pods so I used lemon rind and dried mint, which turned out to have a very nice flavor. I know, I know, I changed a major ingred. in the recipe...but it turned really nice! Thanks for submitting!

I believe the plums I used were Italian prune plums, which I understand are much sweeter than sour Damsons, but I used all the same proportions of ingredients called for in the recipe.  Still very good jam, especially with the cardamom!  After the plums were cooked I ran them through a food mill.  After I added the butter and sugar to the mixture I only cooked the jam about an hour more (low simmer).  My yield was about 9 half pints.  I also processed them in a boiling water canner for 10 minutes (I live at high altitude-- about 4600 feet)  Thanks for the recipe!

Turned out very well!  I did use sugar free pectin, along w/ 1/2c of sugar (1/4c truvia, 1/4c regular sugar).  The plums I had were only about 3 lbs worth, but yielded 4 nice small jars of jam.  It did set a bit light, but very good.  I also added 2 cinnamon sticks.  Would make again!  Thanks!!

This jam is superb!  I love that the tangy sweet flavor of the plums is enhanced by the long slow cook they get.  I did remove the cardamom pods when I pitted the plums and added a teaspoon of ground cardamom with the sugar.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly, and my jam set up perfectly well without any pectin.  I have a plum tree that is currently loaded with fruit, so I will definitely be making more of this to give to loved ones at the holidays!

Adapted this recipe to a quarter-batch, using dark prune plums. Worked perfectly  except for cooking time. Simmered for two hours after removing pits and began to suspect that was way too long. I was right -- the jam was delicious, but set up like rubber. Second batch, cooking time after pit removal = 45 minutes. Jam turned out perfect.
Suggestion: Add Allspice alongside the Cardemom. Tasted good!

This turned out so nice.  At the farmers market I found some lovely tart plums.  They made a deal with me since I was buying 5 lb.  These plums had a a fairly free stone, so I pitted them before beginning.  Because of the long process time and so many things happening, I pitted the plums the night before and refrigerated them in water with a splash of lemon juice.  I used that as cooking liquid the next day.

I did add a little ground allspice in the second cooking.  It smelled heavenly.  Since this was my first attempt I am not sure if this added a lot, but the flavor is so good.  I will make this again!

Update!  I took this into work today with some English muffins and a few cheeses.  I also took in a jar of my apricot jam.  This was gone in short order.  It is a little tart and a little spicy.  This is going to be a part of my party package gift packages.

The jam tastes great, but it did not set up for me. It's more of a plum sauce than jam. If you are an inexperienced jam maker probably best to use some pectin. Perhaps if I knew more about jam making I would have recognized that it was not going to set up.

Only had 2.14 lbs so the cardamom was dropped to 7 pods and the sugar to 2 cups. Cooked for about an hour  and made 4 half-pints. Never again will I waste my time or ingredients by fishing for plum seeds in the jam. Cut the plums in half before you begin, remove the seeds, and save yourself a lot of mess, time, and most importantly, fruit. The finished jam is tart and delicious. Will make it any time I can get my hands on Damsons.

Plums and cardamom - what a combination! I love making preserves without pectin, because all you taste is summer.

We have 3 plum trees and a huge number of plums this year. I have already used over 30 pounds of plums and have more to go.  This recipe is delicious just the way it is, with no changes. I am sticking to what I know works this year.  Maybe I will try to make some changes another time, but then again.  If it isn't broke, don't fix it.  Thanks so much for this recipe.  Everyone has loved it so far.

We devoured this jam with leftover plums (not damsom perhaps but a sour variety) and enjoyed it most with queso fresco cheese on toast.

Used cardamom seeds and just blended it all. Pods might work better as some seeds didn't get completely blended.

If you delete the water and butter, add 5 pods of 5 star anise, couple of table spoons fresh lemon and cook down the mixture to about one third you will have my Grandmothers plum “butter”! A taste of an Old German memory! Oh and I did cut and pull out the seeds of the Italian prune plums...much easier. I it is thick so you don’t have to do anything to the mixture (you could mash with potato masher ) except pour into your jars! Makes about 5 pints!

Great recipe.  My family really enjoyed the favors and texture.  I did not have cardamom pods, so I substituted 3 teaspoons of pure almond extract. Thanks for sharing.

So far sounds perfect- I hate pitting fruit to can.  I do a lemon jam this way, so I'm pretty sure it'll work.  I did put in 2 cinnamon sticks, about a teaspoon of ground cardamom, and a Tablespoon of lemon juice.  Update:  I learned a cool method of pitting and peeling, but jam is too tart, and didn't firm up, stayed a syrup.  Fruit also had a burnt flavor because it cooked so long.  Will be a perfect cobbler filling.

Made almost 9 (8oz) jars of jam. I followed the recipie exactly except I used Italian prune plums and I took the cardamom seeds out in the last 20-25 minutes of cook time (minus one rogue seed). I like the plum skins in there as well, I wasn't sure how the texture would be but it's fantastic. Thanks for the recipe, it made for a wonderful first go at "canning," super easy and straight forward.

This was a great recipe to use up my tiny little tart plums from my "fruitless" plum tree.  They all ripen at the same time, about the size of a golf ball.  Too tart to enjoy and too many to try to eat anyway.  This was exactly what I needed to try to use up a few bucket full of the little guys.

Easy and delicious jam recipe without canning or pectin! Didn't have Cardamom but used one star anise and orange rind.  Yummy result. Making more as gifts.
