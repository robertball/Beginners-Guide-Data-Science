I have been looking for a prune slice recipe for years, without any luck....I cannot believe how delicious these are, add chopped maraschino cherries, maybe 10-12 and definitely walnuts...I live in RI and Italian cookie trays always have these in them, but no one ever has the recipe....try them, they are soooo good, and they go in my Christmas trays every year now....thanks so sharing...

I made these cookies for our family gathering this weekend and everybody loved them so much that each individual family took some home for later! 
     I only wish a quantity could have been suggested for the chopped walnuts; I used 1/2 cup and we all enjoyed them, but more might have been nice too. Additionally, the recipe could have mentioned whether the dough needed to rest in the fridge a while before rolling out and filling, or whether you were supposed to proceed immediately to rolling out the cookies after initially mixing it; I decided to proceed immediately to kneading and rolling it out, but maybe I'll try resting the dough after mixing next time, to see if it could imrpove the recipe. 
     The bottom line is that the cookies are not too sweet, but perfect for enjoying with coffee, either after dinner, or first thing in the morning! =o)

Delicious! This is very similar to my grandmother's recipe. The only difference for my family is we add a shot of brandy and 10 oz. chopped marachino cherries to the prune mixture. This must be a strictly Rhode Island cookie. I wonder if our families are from the same town in Italy!

Unlike the other reviewers, I had never heard of these cookies before, and did not have a sentimental/nostalgic reason for making them, so I was approaching these without any expectations.    However, after having made these cookies, I fell absolutely in love with them!  The recipe is perfect (the dough is absolutely beautiful, and is easy to work with), the crust is flavorful, crumbly but soft, the filling is just sweet enough, and the nuts add another texture dimension.    The recipe makes a bunch, and after 5 days I only have a couple of cookies left (keep in mind this is just 4 people eating), they are that good!  I would definitely recommend this recipe to everyone, even those who have never heard of these before.    They are absolutely amazing with milk!  ***These keep better out in the air, instead of in an airtight container since in a container they get a little soggy because of the filling.

Here's a good way roll out the dough and form the logs:  Wet your counter top, then put down a large piece of saran wrap. Flour the wrap, and roll out the dough.  After you have spread the filling on the dough, use the saran wrap to fold the dough over.  Just lift by two corners, fold, and then peel off the wrap.  Do the same for the second fold.  To get the log on the cookie sheet, put the cookie sheet on the counter next to the log, bunch the saran wrap under the log on the side next to the cookie sheet, ease the saran wrap and the log over onto the cookie sheet, and roll it off the saran wrap.  This works beautifully.  I got a decent-tasting cookie, but I had never had these before and didn't know what to expect.  The directions bewildered me in a few places.  I may try these again now that I have done a trial run.

I just made thhis recipe.  Been looking for one for a long time.  My husband is from RI and his mother used to make them.  They called them Prune Biscuits.  I made these changes based his input.  2 Tblsp Orange Zest added to prunes, none in dough.  Used all prunes and no raisens. My husband said they are as good as his mother's.  Found them pretty easy to make. Just do the prunes the day before and used a mixer for the dough then hand knead.

Thanks you so much!!! I've been trying to find this recipe that an elderly Italian friend of mine had...it is not in any cookbooks.  Thank you. Similar to the other reviewer, I am from Rhode Island.

I was also looking for a recipe like this for years. My Italian grandmother made them at Easter. After tasting them I think she must have used all prunes, but I  used a mixture of prunes, raisins and dried cherries. I did a white icing and then drizzled Easter pastels and then cut them. This is a good recipe to start with.

I made these cookies today and they came out great!  My mother had requested this recipe but wasn't quite sure how they would come out because the cookie she typically had was filled with prunes and cherries.  She actually likes these cookies better because they are not as sweet!  We are from Rhode Island also, so maybe that is why my mother requested the recipe! (We now live in FL)  Came out great and will definitely be on my cookie trays this holiday!  One thing I would like to add, the dough tends to be very sticky!  It was a lot easier once I dusted my hands with flour!  I was a bit unsure of how it would come out at first, but very pleased!

This review is for the filling only. I was looking for a raisin filling for a bar cookie and stumbled on this. (And I actually had prunes in the house so no trip to the store for those.)  I had a tiny problem with the prep. My prunes didn't plump, just disintegrated so I added the raisins to the prune/water mix and let the raisins plump there. No matter, the end result was wonderful. I had to stop myself from eating the filling out of the pan as it was cooling. My bar cookies were a hit. Maybe next time I'll add a dash of rum or rum extract though. Definitely on my "make again" list.

I had never had this kind of cookie before so I wasn's sure what to expect but they turn out delicious! not too sweet and easy to prepare, perfect with a cup of tea or coffee, made exactly as written except I used half brown sugar half white for the fruit filling (i like to substitute brown sugar for white when possible, more "al natural" :) Thanks Lucy for sumitting your recipe!

This was an odd and very successful recipe. Fun to make and felt like something my grandmother would have made - in a good way! I am looking forward to using other fillings. it made plenty of loaves, great texture, easier than I thought.

My new favorite cookie! I'm not Italian or from RI, but these are great. Amount of filling is good, but I liked it just as well with half. More cookie-like with half the filling, almost a fruit bread as called for.

This was too yummy for words and will be on every cookie platter I ever make.  Will def double or triple the prune/raisin mix next time.  Only lightly brushed the top with the lemon juice/sugar mix.  Found it easy to make and really easy to eat!!  Got thumbs up from everyone.  Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe.  My grandmothers would be so proud!

It was just okay. Not that I didn't like it, but nothing too spectacular. But maybe that's because I put less sugar. I made orange glaze instead of regular icing.

Another RI-er here.  My Italian ex-SIL used to make these at Christmas.  It's been years since I've seen or heard from her, but I haven't forgotten how good her prune cookies were.  I'm happy to have found a recipe for them!  Thanks.

Amazing!!! Everyone loved it, even people who aren't crazy about prunes!
Though I didn't glaze it with lemon because I had a cream left over from muffins I made I wanted to use that up, so I poured it over the dough right before putting it in the oven... the cream had chocolate chips in it as well.

Fabulous!!

These cookies have become a christmas tradition for us, and I suspect the main reason for my weight gain at the end of the year.   The only modification I make is that instead of the glaze, I add a few green sprinkles for the holidays.  Great recipe and favorite cookie.

Loved the filling, but I wasn't a fan of the cookie part. I will have to find another crust that suits me. I also added some lemon zest and a little bit of lemon juice to the filling for some added zing.

I only made half the recipe. I prefer raspberry jam instead of prunes, so I used organic raspberry fruit spread with raisins. I also put 1/2 teaspoon of anise extract into the dough for a more biscotti flavor . I sprinkled sliced almonds on top before baking and sliced them when they were still warm. I returned them to a 350 degree for about 8 minutes to crisp them up a little . Finished them with the lemon confectioner powder glaze, no candy sprinkles. They are very close to an Italian cookie that I love from a local bakery.

This was a great recipe to use up some prunes I've had in the pantry.  I actually swapped the amount of prunes and raisins in the recipe to use up my prunes, but it came out very nice.  I think the directions could have been a little more clear when explaining the dough and how to fill it, some inexperienced cookie makers might get confused.  The lemon glaze was my favorite part.

I thought these could use some more filling -- mine is a little sparse looking compared to the photograph. This was otherwise very straightforward and easy to do. The dough was simple to work with. I made a half-batch but used the entire quantity of icing. Thanks for sharing your recipe!
