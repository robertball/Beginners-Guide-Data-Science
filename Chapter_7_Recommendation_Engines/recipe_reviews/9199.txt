I have made this turkey 4 years in a row.  My husband and I only made a few changes.  First, we cover for 2 hours then cook uncovered the last 2.  We also double the ingredients and place under the skin, on top and in the cavity.  This adds a nice rosemary flavor to the stuffing.

I put the spices and the olive oil together the night before and let the oil soak up all the flavor.  All I did on Thanksgiving Day was rub it all over the turkey - inside and out - and place the turkey in a "turkey" baking bag for 3 hours.  It was great!!

I love this recipe, i have used it for a few years now and still love it. To keep it extra moist and half the cooking time i place the already seasoned turkey in an oven roasting bag and seal it with the twist tie thingy. MMMM

Welcome to my new turkey recipe!  This is it, I think, for the rest of my life.  It's so fresh, and makes GREAT gravy.  One added thing I always do....use carrots and leeks instead of a rack for the turkey - then, when you go to make the gravy, make sure you push the carrots and leeks through a sieve to add all that goodness into the pot.  It's really the best possible gravy you could ever have!

I made this today for thanksgiving and it was a huge hit!!! I may try making it in a bag next time. We had a 16 lb bird and it finished cooking in 4 hours. I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe. The flavor was excellent.

OMG!!! Not my first turkey but absolutely my best, most flavorful, moist turkey ever. Reading the reviews first were great. 1) buy a small bottle of olive oil take off the spout and add springs of fresh herbs. I used rosemary, thyme, sage leaves and one clove of garlic sliced. Return spout to bottle and refrigerate a few days prior to making turkey. Note: use whatever herbs you like. 2) took the advice to use carrots and leeks to roast the turkey on. Great tasting will try in gravy but didn't this time. 3) Roasted breast side down first for an hour, then turned turkey breast side up to complete last two hours. 4) Use a foil tent over turkey. 5) stuff cavity with more fresh herbs, an onion wedge, a sliced clove of garlic and rind of a juiced lemon, and splash in some of your flavored oil. WOW! The compliments kept coming.

This recipe was great. I had never roasted a turkey in my life and everyone raved about it on Christmas Eve. The photograph is mine - so you can see it turned out great. Moist too - yummy!

I've tried several methods for roasting turkey over the years (cooking bags, rubbing with butter or oil, using different herbs and seasonings) but this was by far the best.  My search for the perfect Thanksgiving turkey recipe is over.  Everyone at the table loved it.  Thank you!

This looks great. Can't wait to try it. I have one question though.  In the past I've used rosemary in pork and lamb by inserting it into little holes made with a knife. I wonder if this insertion method would work with turkey. I've never heard mention of it. Any ideas?

This is a fabulous recipe.  I'm a fan of brining the turkey first, but if you do that, eliminate the salt from the recipe.  I also butterflied the turkey, so I could bake it at 425 for only one hour.  It was so moist and flavorful.  My family raved about it and asked if we had leftovers for tomorrow!  Thanks for my new Thanksgiving turkey recipe!

I made this for Thanksgiving-and my first turkey.  It came out great.  I roasted it in an oven bag for 3 hours (16 lb bird) and the meat was just falling off the bone.  Delicious!

I used a turkey breast to make sandwiches for lunches for the week..little did I know it was going to be better than any deli turkey I have ever had. With turkey breast at $7.00 and up at the deli..wow! I bought the 6 lb. turkey breast on sale for 6 bucks and we had gourmet sammies all week. Very delicious recipe!!!!

Flavour was great however next time I certainly will not use the full of amount of olive oil - I'll use 1/4 cup of it and the rest broth.

Made a fantastic turkey for Thanksgiving; very moist and flavourful. Also used this as a marinade for lamb shoulder (let it sit for a few days wrapped up in foil), and it turned out excellent!

The seasoning was perfect, but you don't need anywhere close to 3/4 cup of olive oil.  I baked this in a bag breast down for 3 hours (25 lb turkey) and then turned over breast up for another hour.  It came out very tender and juicy.  The herbs and garlic really made this bird extra special.  I'll be using this recipe again next time.

This was fine if you like turkey that's pretending to be red meat. I will personally go with parsley, sage and thyme next time. My hubby said, "It just doesn't taste very turkey-y."

Wonderful, best turkey I have made (out of the 5 Thanksgivings I have been in charge of)! I made this for a Thanksgiving get together in Switzerland and everyone loved this turkey. I soaked the bird in brine overnight, put and apple, garlic, celery and carrot in the cavity but followed the rest of this recipe exactly. Made for wonderful breast meat and excellent gravy. This is how I will be making turkey dinners from now on. Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!

Not bad. I didn't use a whole bird, just a breast. Didn't have minced garlic, so I used a bit of garlic powder. I couldn't get the lid on my roasting pan, so I used the tented foil & took other reviewers' advice, using stock instead of water. Bird came out extremely moist. Pan drippings made great gravy.

I used this Turkey recipe for Christmas this past year. It turned out to be a huge hit. The herbs give this such a wonderful flavor and it looks great too. I cooked my turkey in an oven bag and it worked fine with this recipe.

This turns out great.  Extra tender if a butter-soaked cheese cloth is draped over the top while baking!

Great flavor, very tender and moist. I also prepared the oil the night before and added a little more water to pan when cooking. My kitchen smelled heavenly. Not ususally a big fan of turkey but this is a keeper. Leftovers were made into delicious turkey dumplings next day.

I tried this recipe last year and it was a hit!  This is the most delicious turkey recipe I've ever tried.  It comes out so moist all through the bird that after baking it, the meat just falls right off the bone.  The flavor is exquisite if you are a rosemary/garlic lover.  This is a winner!

Very tasty and a nice change from the 'traditional' bird.  I wanted a turkey recipe that didn't scream Thanksgiving and this was it.  The skin was quite easy to separate from the breast and the rosemary and garlic made the whole house smell wonderful.  I also put a quartered onion and extra sprigs of rosemary in the cavity.  Covered loosely with foil for the first 2 hours to keep it from getting too brown/burned.

I also thought that the measurements for the herbs need to be more, so i ended up using up 3 packages of mixed fresh herbs, sage, thyme, and rosemary. (didn't used the italian seasoning). Used about 5 cloves of garlic inside the cavity of the turkey. I marinaded the turkey over night and before this put the turkey in a brine solution.  It turned out very moist and flavorful.

I also added some melted butter along with the olive oil and seasoning; it made the most succulent bird and instead of water I added some chicken stock to the bottom of the roasting pan and the Turkey gravy was out of this World.

This is my new favorite turkey recipe! I even used the remaining rosemary olive oil as a dipping sauce for bread for an appetizer.

This made a wonderfully flavored turkey for Christmas.  I used slightly more rosemary than the recipe called.  Very good.

Just made this for Thanksgiving!  It was wonderful!! The whole family loved it. I have started roasting chicken and turkey but placing it breast side down, then finish it the last 45 minutes breast up. It really makes the white meat juicy.

Made this last year for thanksgiving and I didn't even think about looking for a new recipe in the past year. This turned out amazing. It was the juiciest turkey I have ever had, and everyone loved it. The only thing I will say is that if you're looking for a crispy skin, this isn't the recipe for you. If you're okay with a good overall turkey though, I highly suggest this.

This turkey recipe is on point! So are the reviews! I followed the recipe, but doubled the ingredients, and covered it for the first two hours as two others had suggested, and it was beautiful! I also stuffed the inside with  a  lg. red onion and orange (both quartered) and the rest of my fresh rosemary and  basil. Everyone went back for seconds. I will definitely make this again!

A little bland for my taste but, otherwise a very nice turkey.  I think a little lemon next time may raise up the flavor. Thanks for sharing!

I have used this recipe since 2005 and everyone that tries it LOVES it.  I do add a couple of chopped apples and chopped celery and onion to the center of the turkey, which just adds some flavor (I throw them away after).  This is the best recipe.  Thanks for sharing!
