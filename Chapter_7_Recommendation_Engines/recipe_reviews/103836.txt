The taste was great but the cooking time is way off it took almost an hour for it to cook and if your not careful you will have a tooth pick come out clean at one point then when you turn it onto a plate it will still be doughy in the middle I used Fresh pinaapple I brought back from hawaii perhaps that is the catch there. But I gave it a 4 for looks LOL good thing I'm not graded for looks by my family. the taste is great and everyone loved it so that is good!

Flavor is great but, you can't use fresh pineapple.  It's too watery. Same as you don't use fresh pineapple in jello.

I just made this for my husband's birthday dessert. Pineapple Upside Down Cake is one of his favorites. It still is with the Splenda.
