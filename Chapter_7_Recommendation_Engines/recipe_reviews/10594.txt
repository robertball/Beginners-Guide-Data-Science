This is a great, light recipe. I have not used the anise or black walnut extracts in this recipe, instead I used 2 and 1/2 teaspoon almond extract. I also add a splash of milk to all my biscotti recipes to make them softer and easier to bite into. Great with white and semisweet chocolate. Watch them very closely when these are in the oven the second time!! These will cook very quickly the second time around.

Taste good, but was very crumbly.  I thought they tasted better the next day after being in an air tight container.  I halved the recipe and only used almond and pure vanilla extract. Made 1 12" rope (didn't like the mini size). I used a SILPAT to bake on but the bottoms still got to brown for me. Decided to use the rest of dough and formed a larger loaf. Baked 10 minutes longer. I melted white and dark chocolate to garnish/drizzle.

This is so good and won the approval of a child and an 85 year old woman.  Need I say more!  Better than any biscotti I've ever bought.  We used fresh black walnuts in our recipe.

This was the first time I tried making biscotti. Found this recipe to be easy and versatile - used pecans and craisins the first time and golden raisins and walnuts another. Great!

I made a little variation of this one...I used 1.5t vanilla and 2.5t maple flavor to make my own maple walnut biscotti.  Oh soooo good. Made a lot of cookies!!!

This is my all-time favorite cookie! I lost my tattered copy and after an hour of searching found it again here.  These cookies keep forever and are so delicious my boys eat them like potato chips.  Gramma loves it when I send her a tin.

Very good recipe.  I prepared them more like a traditional biscotti, directions for shaping and cutting was a little unclear

This biscotti tastes terrific.  It's not as crunchy and hard as most biscotti though.  Kind of crumbly and soft, even when well-toasted.  I love the flavorings and may use them in another recipe.

Lovely! And very easy to adjust if you like different nuts... I have tried them with hazelnuts as well! And I also replaced part of flour with ground hazelnuts at another occasion :)

These are the best ever.This is my 3rd try making Biscotti and they came out perfect.I used the suggestion using the bread hook on my mixer and it really worked well as the dough was very stiff. I also rolled out the dough the way other Biscotti recipes call for. Can't wait to have one with my coffee.

Very nice flavour. I was skeptical about the anise, but since I had some on hand I decided to use it. Gave the dough a wonderful sweet scent, but was less noticeable in the baked cookie. Only problem I had was the dough was extremely dry and wouldn't come together, so I added a tiny bit of milk just so it'd combine. I live in a very dry climate so that might be why. I shaped into logs and baked as I would usually bake biscotti. Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious and a big hit with family & friends.  Easy recipe, however a bit time consuming since you have to bake, cool, slice, and then bake again on each side for even toast color.  I omited the anise & black walnut extracts since I didn't have any, but added a bit extra almond extract.  I had no complaints.  I added a big of chocolate to the tips for a bit extra sweetnes & decor, but not necessary.

Great recipe first time making biscotti. I would use a 1/3 cup more walnuts though and like someone else did i baked for 10 more minuets because they were softer than regular biscottis.

Easy to make and eat! I couldn't find walnut extract, so I substituted french vanilla extract and only put in half the anise amount & it turned out delish!!

It is a little difficult to cut these cookie without them crumbling but it's worth the effort. I cut way down on the sugar.

Very disappointed with this dry and crumbly recipe. Biscotti should be a sweet yet compact pastry delight, and this was not sweet, doughy, and crumbly. If you make this I suggest adding more white sugar and cutting back on flour.

Followed recipe — I was afraid the anise would be overpowering, but flavors blended perfectly.  Will add the dark chocolate drizzle when they’re all cooled down.

These are a big favorite with my family.   They're super tasty.  They dont last very long only because everyone eats them up right away!!!
