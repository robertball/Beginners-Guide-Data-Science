Very good!  They are definitely meant for a 13x9 pan.  What worked for me is to bake till done, "set" in center, pulls away from edges.  Remove from oven, add chips, let melt a little then spread.  Add nuts.  Press them in if desired.

These took much longer to bake than the recipe indicated, but well worth the wait-these were extremely moist and delicious!

I cooked this for 90 minutes at which point the outer edge was burnt and the middle was still goo.  I think it's too much volume for a 9x9 pan; maybe a 9x13 or two 9x9's would work better.

Works well in a 9x13 pan, using the 3-egg "cake-like brownies" recipe on the back of the brownie box.  They were ready in 30 minutes - moist and delicious.  I sprinkled the chocolate chips on top before baking and skipped the pecans.

I was so excited about this recipe.  I never buy frosting anymore, and I went to the store to buy the frosting.  I prepared the batter this morning and followed the directions.  I used a 9X9 pan and put it in the oven at 6:27am.  At 7:30, it was still a little jiggly, but I didn't want it over done, and I had to leave for work, so took it out of the oven.  At 3:30 this afternoon, it was still WET in the middle.  I have no idea how this could possibly be done baking in 20 minutes.  I gave it over an hour and it still wasn't done.  It's a shame because it tasted really good.  We ate a little around the edges that were done more than the middle, but most of it ended up in the trash.  I might try again because I really liked the flavor, but would definitely put this in a 9X13 pan.

I have made these brownies a dozen or so times. They always want more! I do bake mine in a 9X13 pan instead of a 9X9.  They are just marvelous brownies and soooo easy!!  Just a hint...you can use any brownie mix, cake frosting and the sour cream.  Be creative!  Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

These are fabulous!  Baked in an aluminum 9x13 pan for 40 minutes & immediately loosened bars around edge of pan.  Was out of sour cream, but had plain yogurt, worked fine.  Used leftover Hershey's nuggets intstead of chocolate chips and nuts.  YUMMY!!

I know I'm not the only one that had problems with this recipe - so that's good to know. It was delicious, don't get me wrong - but twenty minutes in a 9x9 pan was nowhere near enough time for these. They were great, we scooped it out of the pan, but as for brownies this recipe was severely lacking. Taste, on the other hand, was wonderful. I'm going to make these again in a 13x9 pan and give them another shot, however. (Edit...I did make them again, in a 9x13 pan and they were perfect! Thanks!)

I got this recipe from iWon.com.  I did not get to see the reviews before making these brownies.  I cooked them as the recipe stated but had to cook them for an additional 25 minutes.  They were too runny in the middle.   I started to think my oven was broken.  My husband increased the temperature and left them in for about 15 minutes.  They were still wet in the middle.  We let the pan sit for 20 minutes before tasting the sides of the pan.  They were awesome but we still had to throw it out.  I wish I would of seen the reviews.  Allrecipes should make the change on the recipe.  They need to be baked in a bigger pan.  I used the recommended 9X9. I will try these again in a bigger pan.  The coconut/pecans add the "Wow" factor in them.

This recipe is great.  Of course, I'm glad that I read the reviews before I made this, so that I knew that it needed to be made in a 9x13 pan.  I used 3 eggs and I baked it for approximately 40 minutes and it came out with a nice texture...firm on top and moist and fudgy on the inside.  I did not add the chocolate on top because I felt that it would make an already sweet recipe (because of the entire can of coconut pecan frosting that goes into it) too sweet.  I'm glad I made that call because the finished product is very sweet.  It's good...but sweet.  I am going to cut small pieces of this and serve it for our game day party tomorrow.  The sour cream helps with the soft but dense texture, and you can definitely taste the coconut pecan frosting in each bite.  Next time I will add the cup of pecans into the batter (didn't have any), as I think that will add a nice crunch to it.  Overall, I thought it was a good recipe.  I was afraid to try after reading many of the reviews but I'm glad I did.  Now the true test will be tomorrow...when the guests eat the brownies!

Is this correct? Should it be 1 box of coconut pecan frosting instead of 1 container? I used the container ready mixed frosting and got an expensive mess of goo.

I really really wanted to like these brownies because I love coconut, pecans, and chocolate, but these were not good.  I like the idea, not the result.  They tasted something like a bad batch of german chocolate cake.

What a hit! I was a bit skeptical about the over cooking, but I have made them twice now with in a week and both times have been wonderful! I just make sure to start watching them around 20-25 minutes. Also, I used a 13x9 pan instead of a 9x9. They seemed to work well. I have already passed this recipe on to 4 different people. Mmmmmm.....

I tried the 9X13 pan.  The center didn't cook after 40 minutes and I didn't want to burn the edges. Had trouble with the pecan/chocolate chip topping.  It wouldn't spread and it made the tops of the brownies lumpy.  Overall, the brownies were very moist and were a big hit at my meeting.

I addded the pecans and chocolate chips in with the mixture and baked in 13x9 pan.  Also makes 24 cupcake size brownies, great for kid's hands.

Mixed emotions on this recipe.......some of the ladies I made this for loved, others thought they were just ok........I thought it was more like cake rather than brownies.  When mixing up the batter I could tell it was going to make way more than a 9x9 pan, so I put mine in a 13x9 pan as other reviewers suggested.  It was done baking in about 30 minutes in the larger pan.  The finished product was very moist and dense, but more like a cake.  They cut nicely with a plastic knife and retained their moist texture for days to follow.  They were good, but I probably won't be making again.

I used the 13x9 pan and followed the cake like brownies instructions on the box. I followed the recipe. Very moist reminded me more of a fudge type cake versus brownie. The topping was messy and lumpy but tasted good.

I was really excited to make these, but they did not trun out as I liked.  I watched them closely as not to overcook them, but they took over an hour and even then I was not impressed. So i am still searching for the best brownie ever.

I did them in the 9x13 pan too and it worked perfectly.  I also added more choc chips and another cup of pecans to the mix before baking in addition to the choc chips and pecans that you add at the end.  They were incredible.

I had problems with this recipe. I did use a 9 X 13 and the extra egg for a "cake" like brownie as many suggested. Nearly an hour into baking the middle was still a bit "wiggly". I added the chips and nuts to the top and put it back in for another 10 but the middle never fully cooked. Had to cut around it and it still seemed like they were uncooked.

Well, this recipe has its problems. It obviously needs to be baked in a 9x13 pan if you're only going to bake it for 20-30 minutes. I used a 9x13 and mine were done in just under 30. These taste *really* good and the texture is super fudgy because of the frosting inside. Mine definitely don't cut very well though, which is annoying, but could have been by some fault of mine. I was out of semisweet chips, so I used carob chips instead, which worked just fine. Thanks :)

Excellent!  Definitely use a 9 x 13 - otherwise perfect.  I did make my own butter pecan frosting from this website and it turned out great.

Very good brownies!  Instead of the canned stuff, I made the frosting from scratch using a recipe (one of the highest-rated ones) form this site.  Uses real butter, etc. and is really not hard to make.  I say go for the good stuff vs. the can!  Also, I used a 9 X 13 and baked for 40 minutes.  Perfectly done.

The brownie mix that I used called for 3 eggs for "cakier" brownies, and only 2 for "fudgier" brownies.  I used 3 because of the posting here debating the cooking...figured that the eggs would bind the brownies together.  Spread the batter into two(2) 7x7 inch pans because that was all that I had.....took only 40 minutes to cook both pans at once.  Consistency was great. They were easy to cut.  Nice flavor, except, I would have preferred a sweeter frosting.

These are fabulous and very moist.  I used a 9"X13" baking pan. I added 3 tablespoons of corn oil to make sure they would be moist and then the baking time was more around 40 minutes instead of 20 to 30.

UPDATE: MY DAD LOVED THESE!! HE HAD TWO BROWNIES IN ONE SITTING (WHICH HE NEVER DOES LOL!)!!! :) Yum! These were REALLY good. If you bake in a 9x13 in. pan for DOUBLE the amount of time instructed (I can't imagine these baking up in 20-30 minutes or in a smaller pan), you'll end up with yummy, lucious brownies! These almost have a maple aftertaste and when baking, smell like maple syrup - but maybe that's just me. :) My neighbor made the most AWESOME German chocolate brownies for our Memorial Day cookout. I was intrigued when I saw the ingredients for this recipe, so I tried this recipe instead of hers. I paired my brownies with a homemade coconut pecan frosting and all I can say is WOW! Although I like the idea of frosting these, I think doing so was a little much for my taste (and I'm a BIG sweet tooth!). On the flipside, I think I would have liked these MUCH less with the chocolate / pecan topping (which is just as sweet, IMHO). Next time I will cut my brownies into small, bite-sized pieces because a little REALLY does go a long way. NOTE: To ensure easy clean-up, line your baking dish with lightly greased aluminum foil. Easy peasy! For a nice presentation, I topped each brownie with a pecan half and then placed into jumbo cupcake liners and displayed on a covered cake stand. Too cute! When my dad comes over to help with my latest house project, he'll be pleasantly surprised (he LOVES German chocolate ANYTHING!!!). Thanks for sharing your recipe Stogner! :-)

These were just OK, nothing special. Could barely taste the coconut pecan frosting in them.  Won't make again.

I made this out of the "TRIED and TRUE COOKIES" cookbook by allrecipes. After the fact, I went online and discovered how everyone else had made them in a 9 x 13 pan.  This would have been helpful information to have included in the editing of the recipe for print.  What a total mess in a 9 x 9 pan.  Took an hour to bake.  Disgustingly sweet.  UGH.

Just what I was looking for, a thick, moist brownie.  Very sweet.  My cooking time did take a little longer. Next time I think I'll leave off the chocolate frosting, doesn't need it.

I made these brownies for a meeting.  I took everyone elses advice and baked in a 9 x 13 pan.  I didn't add the chocolate chips or pecans on top, I added extra pecans in the batter and made my own homemade chocolate butter cream frosting.  They were very moist, heavy and dense.  Almost too much.  Couldn't really taste the coconut pecan flavor in them.  Might make them again.

These tasted good, but I feel like you have to use a 9x13. They take forever  to cook in a 9x9 pan.

These were tasty brownies, although I did end up modifying them a little bit. I ended up just making them per the box's instructions since I didn't have any sour cream, but had to bake them much longer than the suggested 20-30 minutes since they were still quite liquidy after a half hour. I don't think I'll be dying for these any time soon, but they were a good way to use up a can of frosting.

These were alright... they held together well and were very moist. I think I'll probably make them again in the future, with a notation to add more coconut and pecans either to the mix or sprinkled on top. The tub of frosting just didn't have enough "stuff" to go around for the whole pan of brownies. I did take the suggestion of several others and baked it in a 13x9. Even in a larger pan and 40 minutes of baking made for pretty "doughy" brownies- next time I'll cook it at least 5 minutes longer.

I thought this was just OK- it was difficult to bake and I was not a fan of the taste. I was looking for more of a traditional brownie. Others liked it- really a matter of preference.

I love these brownies!  I read most of the reviews and put my brownies in my 9x13 pan, baked them for 33 minutes and they are wonderful. I did not put the chips on top because I am sending these with my husband 4 wheeling and didn't want them to be so messy.  Nothing wrong with this recipe at all.

I made these for our potluck at work yesterday but I didn't have a 9x9 pan so I needed to use a 9x13. They took at least 40-45 min to cook. They were a great hit at the potluck! I also added some butterscotch caramel in with the mix.

This is a "fantastic" recipe! It was a huge hit with my family and friends. Everyone that tasted it asked for the recipe.
I baked the brownies in a 13x9 pan for about 40 minutes. Came out Delicious. 
I will definitely be making it often :)

I followed the comments and used a 9x13 pan and it came out just fine. It just didn't taste good. I would rather have just made the brownies and used the frosting for something else.

Very easy to make- dare I say fool proof ??? These came out great for me, everyone in my house LOVED them. They had to be cut into smaller pieces than we normally cut our brownies into- because they are so rich and decadent. Made em in a 9x13, baked for 35 min, let them sit for some minutes, sprinkled 1 cupish of  chocolate chips on top, let em sit for a few moments then smoothed them over the brownies and sprinkled with chopped pecans- pressed then into the chocolate a bit with my spreading tool. I will add this into my rotation of treats, kicks brownies up a notch.

very sweet/sinful!  my son and husband LOVE these brownies.  i made them exactly as directed but w/o the pecans on top.  also, i dont think i will top them w/chocolate chips again as these are some sweet tasting brownies!  they were done in a 9x13 dish in 31 minutes.  i'm not a big nut or coconut fan, but they taste great!

TALK ABOUT GOOD!  These brownies actually took about one hour to cook instead of 20-30 minutes because they're sooooo moist!  At one hour they WON'T be overcooked.  I'm not a fan of coconut, but I'm sure that any desirable frosting can be substituted instead of the coconut-pecan frosting.  YOU GOTTA COOK THESE!

Very sweet, excellent flavor!  Took 1 hour plus to bake, though.

I used a 9x13 pan. The brownies came out moist and delicious. I definitely recommend this recipe!

This recipe yields to 36 servings hence either a bigger pan or cut the recipe down in size

I used one box brownie mix, two eggs, 1/4 c. almond milk, 1/4 c. oil, the can of frosting and mixed together and put into a greased 9x13, baked at 350 for 30 minutes.  It was the best brownies I've had in a long time.  I will do this again.  They are SOOOOOO moist!  I don't like coconut and pecans, but you can hardly tell it's in there.  I didn't use the chocolate chips on top or the nuts inside.  I only rated it four stars because I changed it up a little.

Made according to the directions without the added chips and pecan topping....fabulous.  Made it in a 9x13 pan with a mocha chocolate brownie mix & baked for 32 minutes...perfect.  Unbelievably moist and delicious. Can't imagine how rich it would be with the topping.  Loved it without it. Such an easy & delicious recipe. Will definitely become a constant favorite in this house.

EXTREMELY rich brownie.  I didn't top it with anything and it was delicious.  I turned the oven off after 20 minutes and just let it sit for another 10 as the heat was dissipating.  Perfectly moist brownies.

Wow!  These are amazing and rich brownies!  I made them for July 4th and my family absolutely loved them.  I took the advise of some others and made them in a 9x13 pan and baked for 35 minutes.  Just perfect!  I highly recommend these brownies - and they are incredibly easy to make.

These brownies are very tasty but it took them about 1 hour to cook and not the 30 minutes.

I thought this recipe was soooooo easy to make. Everyone loved the taste of the brownies. I was a little concerned about over cooking them (as was warned) but they came out great. Yummy!
