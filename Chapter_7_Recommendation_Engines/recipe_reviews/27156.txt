The texture of this recipe was amazing, but the butterscotch to chocolate to peanut butter ratio was really in need of improvment.  First of all, I could barely taste the chocolate or peanut because of all the butterscotch!  The butterscotch chips were so rich that next time I think I'll cut them down to a half cup.
Also, I would suggest doubling the peanut butter.  I couldn't taste the chocolate either so I added a cup of cocoa, which worked well.  I'm not even sure that the chocolate chips are necessary.  I probably would've given this recipe 3 stars because of this, but, as I said, the texture was so good.

this recipe did combine the best of all worlds. i thought it could have used a lot more chocolate, but my husband LOVED it. BEWARE: this is very, very sweet, again my husband liked it that way. also, i don't have a candy thermometer so i have no idea what temperature i boiled it to and it still came out perfect.

This fudge was really tasty and easy to make. The only thing I changed was I lined the pan with foil instead of greasing it and it came out great.

Very good. I did make changes due to my limited ingredients on hand. I only ever have fat free milk and have found that this can be a problem in fudge making. So, I used up some left over heavy cream and half and half that I had. Also, had not semi-sweet or butterscotch chips, only milk chocolate. So, I used 2 cups of milk chocolate and it turned out great, now more of a peanut butter/chocolate fudge. I have a candy thermometer, but if you don't, just use the cold water trick. Check the consistency about 3 minutes into boiling, that is normally when it hits the 'soft ball stage.' One other thing that I changed was instead of spraying the dish, I lined it with wax paper so I could easily pull the fudge out to cut, plus easier clean up!

Followed the recipe as written, except I started with a bigger pan (having had experience cooking this type of sugar, butter, milk combination before). Checked for the soft ball stage after approxiately 2-1/2 to 3 minutes at a full rolling boil...perfect. Got rave reviews from everyone. Great flavor, really nice texture. The butterscotch does slightly overwhelm the chocolate, but we were looking for something different from the usual chocolate fudge. As another member mentioned this is very sweet, but fudge is supposed to be sweet or it wouldn't be fudge. Will definitely make this one again!

Everyone LOVED this! First time fudge making, It was great! Sent it to my husbands company holiday party. The only problem ( I think with all fudge) is that it was hard to get out. My kids even overbuttered the dish. I am going to make it again and use parchment paper. 
Thanks for the great recipe!

Pretty tasty!  The only problem I ran into was that the recommended pot size was not big enough! (I doubled the recipe) In the midst of a saucepan boil over, I switched everything to a stock pot - plenty of room for mixing in and it didn't boil over.  OVerall, this was an easy recipe to follow.

I personaly love butterscotch and had to try this out when I first seen it. I cut the recipie in half, but followed it exactly afterwards. (except I did add a couple extra table spoons PB due to other reviews saying it lacked the PB taste) EXCELENT! It was a hit along friend and family. It set up perfect! Will definaly keep this one around.

i don't have a candy thermometer and didn't quite understand the cold water technique so my fudge turned out a little grainy. Regardless, it had a fairly nice taste. i used an extra third cup of chocolate and that helped tone down the butterscotch. pretty good.

I made this around Christmas time, I followed the recipe exactly and I thought it was wonderful!  It is very sweet so eat in moderation. Everyone at my work and all my family loved it! I will make it again.

I found this to be VERY dry and although it had good flavor would not make it again.  It was TOO sweet and along with the texture, I was not impressed with this one.

YUMMY! This was my first time making fudge AND I made a few modifications to make it non-dairy (used vegan "butter" and chocolate soy milk) and I used natural peanut butter and it still turned out great! Didn't have a thermometer and I never did get the described effect when I dropped a small amount of syrup into cold water (maybe because of the non-dairy ingredients??) so I have no idea what temperature it was when I took it off the stove. I thought the balance of flavours was great, but then again, I was looking for a butterscotch fudge recipe to begin with (the choclate and peanut butter was a bonus). Delicious. Thanks for the recipe!

I have made this twice now, and the first time I made it the flavor was good, but the consistency was really crumbly.  The second time I made it the fudge was so hard I couldn't even cut into it.  Both times I waited until the sugar formed a ball when dropped into hot water.  I think a thermometer is needed for accuracy.

I agree with some other reviews that the butterscotch flavor in this fudge is what you taste more of. However, being a big fan of any butterscotch flavor myself I thought this fudge was excellent! It set up perfect. Very rich and I just cut it into small pieces. Fantastic flavor!

This recipe is awesome. The only change was I did not use lemon juice I added 2 tbsp of water. I also added a bit of red pepped flakes. Love it! It did take about 40 minutes to cook!

I found this recipe back in 2006 and made for my then boyfriend. Fast forward to today and my now husband asks me to make this fudge every single year at Christmas time. It is excellent. Very easy to make and really is the best of all worlds as far as fudge goes. I usually make a couple batches and give in tins as a gift. It always follows with rave reviews.
