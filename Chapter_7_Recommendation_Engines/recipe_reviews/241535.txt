Add salt!!! I made this for my family and everyone liked it, including the small children! Just be sure to salt to taste. Before I added the salt, the flavors weren't coming together well, but salt made all the difference!! I found this recipe an hour before dinner so I made it in a pot on the stove. Worked beautifully. I boiled the chicken to almost done before then added everything else- minus the coconut milk and frozen peas- which were added at the end like the original recipe. Will definitely be making this again!

Way too "soupy".  I cut the amount of chicken broth in half but it was really runny.  I also cut the ginger to a tsp. and it was still really "gingery".  We both agreed it was edible, but not necessary to make again.

I broke my cardinal rule and made a recipe that had no reviews.  It was good, but not great.  I followed the recipe as closely as I could, though I'm sure I used more cauliflower than called for.  I don't actually own a grater at the moment, so I minced the ginger. I used hot madras curry powder, a little more than called for by the recipe (I kind of spilled it) and it was not too spicy.  This needs something, but I really don't know what.  

I will probably make this again because it was okay...just not great...and experiment to see what could be done.

This recipe was edible but itâ€™s lacking spices and was way too watery.

I love curry but somehow this recipe fell short. The recipe is pretty bland unfortunately.
