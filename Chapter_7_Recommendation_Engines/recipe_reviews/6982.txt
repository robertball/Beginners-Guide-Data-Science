This bread was great. My kids loved it with a little bit of jelly. I thought it was good with just butter and warmed up. Great for a snack for those hungry kids. Cetan

I made this bread by hand and it has to be one of the smoothest, easiest to work with doughs I've ever made. It's silky smooth, and makes a delicious soft crusted loaf. I'm a huge fan of all things peanut butter and chocolate, so I rolled the dough out flat and spread a mixture of 2T cocoa and 3T sugar plus about 1/3c of coarsely chopped semisweet chocolate over the top. I rolled it and cut it in half and placed the dough in 2 loaf pans with the seam side down and baked at 350 for 25 minutes. Once it cooled it tasted and looked amazing with an awesome flakey and light texture. The PB wasn't noticeable at first (even though I added a full cup instead of the 2/3) but as it cooled it was more pronounced. Just delicious!

Okay this is the first low rating I've given. I wasn't too impressed with this bread. After it came out of the bread machine it was really really moist not at all normal bread consistency. I waited to see if it would be better the next day and it was it was more firm; however I was still not impressed with the taste. PLEASE!! don't toss this recipe aside until you've tried it yourself though. Just because someone gives a low rating doesn't mean it's a bad recipe and no good. Everyone has their own likes and dislikes. What I like you may not like and what you like I may not like. We all have our different tastes; this bread just didn't tickle my taste buds. Other's really enjoyed it so try it. You have nothing to lose. If you like it then you have a great new recipe. If not then you won't be missing out on anything.

Very good my toddler helped to make it and enjoyed eating it as well. I decreased the salt by half and it still turned out fine.

This one is a good bread with a whole wheat bread consistency and a light peanut butter taste. Even though the amount of yeast seems huge it is necessary and despite of the 3 1/2 tsp the bread is still dense (which does not mean "heavy"!!!). It can be baked in a 1 1/2 lb bread machine for it doesn't rise really high.

At first I thought "ok this will be dull and you won't be able to taste the p.b." But today i decided to give it a try and boy was i wrong--this is great!! So moist and all you need is butter if that. My hubby who isn't into trying new foods very often was outside so i went out and stuck a piece in his mouth while his hands were full and he loved it!! He then came in and asked if he could take some to work for his buddy to try!! Thats all i needed to hear--I'll be making again. Beautiful bread nice texture moist pretty color and lots of p.b.taste and i used generic p.b. i buy for baking. Big kids like this too!

Made today - I really liked it but the boyfriend said it didn't taste peanut-buttery enough for him. Definitely doesn't scream peanuts but still very good. I used crunchy peanut butter and enjoyed the "surprise" each time I got one of the nut pieces in a bite.

I really wanted to like this but it wasn't my favorite. However my eight year old daughter liked it for breakfast with nutella. I am going to keep the recipe just in case she requests it but the rest of my family says that they would not want me to make it again.

Yummy but not as sweet or peanut-buttery as I expected. I made this in my mixer instead of in the bread machine. I agree with the previous review that this dough is excellent to work with - so smooth and not at all sticky! Made a 9x5 loaf as well as a nice sized round loaf. Good toasted with some jelly on it:)

Excellent bread! Was great toasted! The only changes were made for my tastes only used 1 tsp. salt and 3 tsp. yeast. Still a high light loaf. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Good basic recipe. Needs some more salt (if you like savory) or sugar (if you like sweet). To avoid dry texture I used water bath and added 2 cups peanut butter. Before putting it in the oven brush the top with a coat of milk.

This bread recipe made me wish that I had given "Yummy Peanut Butter Bread" five stars instead of four. This peanut butter yeast bread isn't as good as that one is. It's not as peanut buttery. This bread is good for folks who don't want an overpowering peanut butter taste--just a suggestion of one.

Not bad. I often use the bread machine to make the dough only then I will shape it and let it rise then bake in the oven. Bread machines tend to make white bread the best and since this has a heavy ingredient (in the form of peanut butter) it may not always work in the bread machine. regardless I didn't try it there--made the dough shaped into rolls and let rise for 20 mins then baked at 375 for about 15-16 minutes. Oh and I used 1 cup of pb instead of the 2/3 called for. This dough makes lovely soft rolls. If you use crunchy pb like I did you get a mild peanuty taste with a bit of a crunch. I really like how the rolls turned out. for those of you who want to convert to a recipe by hand check out the Allrecipes article Bread Machine Baking: Tips for Experimenting. I'd post the link but I did before and AR deleted it. Thanks for the recipe!

This was good nothing fantastic. I used bread flour and amaranth and it came out in a nice consistency and very moist. I rounded my measure of peanut butter after reading the reviews. This bread sliced very easily. It was firm enough that I could slice thin slices.

?My children LOVED this for PBJ sandwiches. It was very easy to cut the following day. I did use the flour the recipe recommended wondered if it would be less dense with Bread Flour. The loaf did rise to the top on my 2" pan and did burn a little along the top edge but we ate it all. I will use my next loaf for PBJ Bread Pudding.

This was pretty good! I followed the recipe exactly. It smelled great while baking. The peanut butter flavor is mild. I think I would make this again but I would try out other peanut butter breads first.

This was a simple and yummy bread made in my bread machine after adjusting the serving amount for 11 in order to fit my machine. SO GOOD! I used Teddy Chunky Natural peanut butter and it was perfect - it even rose high and the bread itself was not heavy at all. This recipe is a keeper. Thank you Jenny Kernan - we really enjoyed this bread.

I mixed ingredients in a stand mixer. UseD 1 cup of peanut butter. Let rise on yogurt setting in instant pot for  1 hour. Punched dough down after 45 minute rise and transferred to greased Pullman (pain de mei) Pan. Let rise again in oven on warm setting (100°f) for 15 minutes (until dough rises 1 inch from top of pan. Removed from oven and  placed top on pan. Preheated oven to 350°F and returned covered pan to oven for 30 minutes. Opened oven and removed pan top, then baked for 6 more minutes. Removed from oven and cooled for 1 hour. Subtle peanut butter taste. Delicious!

I found this very good but next time I will add more peanut butter as other reviewers suggested. I always make the recipe as submitted the first time in order to give it a fair review. Anyone that changes a recipe then gives a low review is only rating their recipe not the original one.
