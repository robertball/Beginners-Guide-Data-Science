My family definitely enjoyed these and I'll make again for sure. I put the onion and green pepper in when I browned the beef instead of afterwards as I was afraid the beef would get too done otherwise. Then I added the corn and the rest. Only needed 25-30 minutes to cook. We didn't put lettuce and tomato on top; the kids used sour cream and I put on more salsa. yum!

This recipe is definitely a keeper !! Very tasty chimichangas. I also added some cilantro and green chilies to the meat and used spicy taco salsa. A couple of minutes before I took them out of the oven, I put some grated cheddar cheese on top and served it with sour cream.

YUM! I skipped the corn, used garlic and onion powders, cut the cumin by half and brushed the tops with evoo. Much healthier version but just as delicious!

Excellent flavor, and I love that they are baked instead of fried.  Mine got a little too spicy, must've been the salsa I used.  Definitely will make again!  Rave reviews

Worth at least 4 1/2 stars!  Easy and good.  I subbed taco seasoning mix instead of the spices and sharp cheddar for the jack cheese.  And I left out the corn.  Instead of lettuce and tomato, I served with sour cream, guacamole, taco sauce and Red Hot.  The directions for rolling really worked to keep the filling inside the tortilla and the butter did make them slightly crispy. Recipe make a ton...I used a whole can of refried beans and made 7 chimis and still hade enough beef filling to make 1-2 more! Might try subbing  black beans for the refried for a change.  Very good, will make again.

I thought this was a good recipe that I would make again. But DH did not like the corn in the mix. I might would leave that out next time.

Perfect.  I loved them... great presentation as well with the tomatoes and the lettuce on top.  Serve with Sour Cream as well.  I liked to add some spicy salsa on mine but we had sides of different things for the kids to add or not add... it was great.  Thanks.

I tried this thinking it was going to be great, and to my dismay it wasnt!!  It was definetly missing something.  Maybe it was the corn or salsa that didnt seem to fit in?

This was a great recipe!  We used smaller tortillas and used the leftover meat mixture on nachos and cheese.  Yummy!

The first time I made these as written and I didn't really care for the flavor.  I decided to give them another try my way and thought they turned out great.  I used green onion, black olives and corn for the veggies, and mixed the beans right in with the beef saving a step.  I also used 1/2 packet of cheesy taco seasoning instead of the spices. Thanks for the base recipe!

AWESOME!!!  Made a few changes though..used shredded beef, because I'm not a fan of ground beef, and I also subbed green taco sauce for the salsa.  I was a bad girl and fried it in a little oil, then topped with lettuce, tomato, sour cream, and guacamole.  Other than that, fantastic recipe.  Thanks a million Pam.

This recipe tasted very good...I didn't have enough salsa, so I put what I had in (which was about half a cup) and it still turned out well.  I spooned olives over the meat mixture and then topped that with a mixture of Monterey jack and Cheddar cheese.  I may substitute rice for the corn next time or do a mixture of rice with corn.

These were pretty good, but nothing special that me or my family would go crazy if I never made them again. Will keep looking for another filling, but did quite like them baked in the oven with the butter it made them nice and crispy and almost seemed deep fried.

I must be the minority here because I thought these were just okay.  I am giving this recipe a 4 because the rest of my family really liked.  Will make again for them.  Thanks
