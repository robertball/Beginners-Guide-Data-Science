I made these after Easter last year - love 'em!  I did this entirely on the stove-top.  When you add the egg whites - I added a c. of sharp shedded cheddar cheese, and stirred until the cheese melted, and the mixture was nice and thick. (didn't use the bread crumbs)  Serve over toasted english muffins ~ MMMMMMM! Great creative breakfast recipe to use up those hard boiled eggs.

Very good Easter breakfast recipe!  I used fat free half and half instead of the cream, and doubled the butter and flour (trying to save a few calories while maintaining the proper consistency), then served it over fresh biscuits.  It turned out great!

Good. Used no fat half and half instead of cream. Tasted like hot egg salad. A shredded cheese topping difinitely would make this more interesting.

We like these a lot!  Super rich and creamy - perfect comfort food when you could care less how many calories you are going to consume.  I added diced onion and garlic to the white sauce.  Yummers!  We served it over toasted english muffins.  We will eat this again.

This was interesting. My boyfriend loved it and would give it 5 stars but it was a bit too odd for me and my father. For us it was good but not great. I'm glad I tried it though because it was different from what were used to. Thanks!

I was going to make breakfast last night, and wanted to try something new.  This was eggcellent!!  I had to use 1 C of cream & 1 C of half & half (with a little butter) but it still turned out great.  I added a little garlic herb seasoning to the first layer of bread crumbs & sprinkled a little mozzerella & cheddar on the top of the second layer. Yum!

Made this recipe with 1 egg and 1/6 of the other ingredients, just to give it a try.  Baked it in a small baking dish and had it on a toasted English muffin.  Excellent!

The gravy doesn't do much to dull the flavor of the eggs. Great for people that love eggs.

It was a bit bland.  Adding cheese into the mixture as DREGINEK suggested would probably make it better, so I might try that next time.

It's basically Egg Gravy. Kind of odd. I can't decide if I like it or not.

For goodness sakes!  My grandmother taught us how to boil eggs perfectly and it works no matter how many eggs you have to boil.  Always perfectly boiled and NEVER any green, uncooked or overdone yolks.  Put the cold eggs into cold water, bring them to boiling over medium high heat, reduce the heat so that they continue to boil at a medium low boil for eight minutes.  Immediately cool them under cold water until you can comfortably hold them in your hands.  Gently crack the shells and use the edges of your thumbs to separate the eggs from the shells.  They will turn out perfectly EVERY TIME NO MATTER HOW MANY EGGS YOU BOIL!  If you want soft-boiled eggs, reduce the boiling time to six minutes, cool immediately and gently crack and peel the eggs.  It is so easy and you do not have to guess how to adjust the boiling time to compensate for more or less eggs.

I made it because we had so many Easter eggs to use!  Everyone loved it, I omitted the pepper because of kids and some family but otherwise a really easy & delish dish!  I always go a little heavy on cheese too, can never have too much cheese!  LOL
