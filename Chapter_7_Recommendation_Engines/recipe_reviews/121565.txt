I used regular rice instead of the minute rice because I didn't realize that it was all that I had no hand and I wasn't sure that the recipe was going to come out with fully cooked rice but it was done. However with that rice all the liquid was completely gone and it was quite dry but I blame that on myself not the recipe as I used the wrong rice. Otherwise it had good flavor to it and the kids enjoyed it.

This recipe is very odd. When I first looked at it, it sounded good(except for the celery). But, when i went to make it, I started thinking. Why would you use cream o mush soup, and add broccoli and cheese. Why wouldn't you use cream o broccoli soup, or cheddar broccoli? I rated the recipe the way I made it. Feel free to try.   2 cups ham  2 cups rice  2cups milk  2-3 cups broccoli  1 can cream of Broccoli soup  1 can cheddar broccoli soup  1 cup cheese whiz  salt and pepper to taste  Mix it all up in the slow cooker and cook on low for 4-5 hrs.     Mine was good. I think the cream of mush and celery would have killed this recipe so I didn't even try it :)

Great for the kids!  So simple to throw together and my kids gobbled it up.  Yes it was a little mushy but it is a casserole in the slow cooker so what would you expect?

This was an ok recipe. If I ever make this again I will substitute cubed cooked chicken instead of the ham.

Love this casserole! Used the leftover Thanksgiving ham, cream of celery (it was all I had) and 2 cups of shredded sharp cheddar cheese instead of the processed cheese spread. Everyone raved about it and now think I'm the kitchen goddess of leftovers. Thanks, Krista.

This was very good. I doubled the recipe for my family, I only used one 16oz pack of broccoli and only 3 cups of diced ham. Also I don't use instant rice so I used regular so I added an extra 1/2 cup of milk. I actually could have used 3/4. About 30 minutes before serving I mixed up 1 cup of shredded cheddar 1/2 c panko and 2T melted butter, added this to the top of the casserole, wiped the crockpot lid of and put it on with an opening so that the steam would release. This made a nice little crunchy top. Thanks for the recipe!

My family loved this. Used 2 cups shredded cheese instead of processed cheese and cut back to a 1/4 onion. Simply delicious!

I'm in college, so I'm always looking for something that's easy and I can fix in a slow cooker since I don't have a stove or an oven.  This was great and the leftovers are just as good.  I had some chicken so I used that instead of ham and I left out the celery and onion.  Also, mine was done in 3 hours which was great because I got started on it a little late.  I'll definitely be making it again!

This is an excellent recipe! I did use regular rice instead of instant...but adding an extra 3/4 cup of milk worked just perfect. I used reserved sharp cheddar in place of the jar of cheese sauce. My husband raved about this recipe...thanks! I'll be making it again.

This recipe was not to my liking.  The overall taste was too salty, and upon reheating, it turned to mush.
