This was not good- wasted the chocolate chips. It was too thick and did not stick.

I figured it would be even healthier to use dark chocolate and skip the shortening.  I kept the chocolate over the double boiler as I worked to keep the chocolate warm and easy to work with.  These were both lovely to look at and delish to eat!  I washed and blotted my berries dry, then left them to air dry a bit longer so they wouldn't be damp at all and prevent the chocolate from sticking.  I placed them on parchment once dipped.  I had no problems whatsoever and they came out great!

I used 1 tablespoon of smart balance with the dark chocolate.  I added a pinch of cinnamon to the dark chocolate and it was amazing!  Also - depending on the size of the strawberry toothpicks didn't work too well.  I just dipped them and placed them on a large dinner plate that had a layer of parchment paper on it.  Placed the strawberries there and let them cool for 30-45 minutes.  They are great the next day too b/c the sort of ferment and taste great!
