This was quite good, though I had to make a few alterations. I decided to puree it and it turned out nice and smooth but a bit bland; I added quite a bit more salt, some fresh ground pepper and also some Mrs. Dash. A little extra butter adds to the creaminess. Overall, very tasty.

We found this to be a great jumping off point for potato soup (it's our first time making potato soup from scratch).  We used a leek instead of an onion, and we left out some of the paprika because we have a toddler, and I wasn't sure how spicy it would be with a whole tablespoon.  We did end up adding quite a lot of salt to it as the other reviewer suggested as well, and topped it with grated cheddar cheese.  Thank you for the recipe!

I followed this recipe as written. I found it very bland, even with added salt and pepper. I needed to add two more tablespoons of flour before I could get it to thicken. Reviews suggest a good number of tweaks are neccessary. I would not disagree.

I used this recipe as a starting point to try imitating some great potato jalapeno soup I found at a pub in Traverse City, MI.  Here's my altered ingredients list:   1 large onion, chopped  1 stalk celery chopped  4 tablespoons butter or margarine  1 tablespoon all-purpose flour  1 teaspoon salt (salted to taste) 3 cups milk  4 medium potatoes - peeled, cooked and cubed 1 or 2 fresh jalapeno* peppers (two was a little heavy on the jalapeno) - seeds removed and finely chopped *Be careful with the fresh jalapenos, especially if you have excema; wear gloves.

The combination of paprika and sour cream (as many reviewers suggested) is what made this soup stand out for me.  Since no chicken broth was used, I added about a tsp of chicken granules to the milk  Also added hot pepper sauce and ground black pepper.  As with most soups, the flavors were richer and even better when reheated.

This soup was a great way for me to use up the leftover potato pulp from the potato skins that I recently made.  My main problem with this recipe is that it makes no where near 5 servings.  I have 2 adult and 3 kids in my family, and luckily I had leftover lasagna that 2 kids ate, because the other 3 of us ate the soup - and not huge bowls by any means.  The flavor is good, although we did all salt our bowls after tasting.

I made this for a crowd and potatoes were not firm enough and not enough flavor.  I would make again adding more spices or broth and leftover potatoes and easy if you have no bacon on hand.

I thought this was a great recipe!  I liked the fact that there weren't too many ingredients and it didn't take very long to make.    The only revisions I made, this is simply because it's what I had, I used pearl onions that I chopped in half and I use whole wheat flour.    A recipe I used to use for potato soup had bacon.  I think next time, I will add bacon.

This tasted very nice, but at the same time quite bland... So i added about 4 and a half tablespoons of hot sauce, half a role of Bob Evans spicey italian sausage, and a layer of paprika on top... talk about a real POW!

I agree with the extra salt, I also tried the sour cream and chicken broth, that made it very tasty!  A little less paprika if your not in to spicy food also!

This wasn't too bad, however I added dijon mustard and some cheese to this recipe in addition to extra salt.
