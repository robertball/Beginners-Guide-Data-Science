Dip?  I just noticed that in the description as I went to the recipe to review it!  I had no idea. For us this was an incredibly delicious baked-style mashed potato dish that paired well with our grilled steak and vegetables.  Interestingly, I thought the dish I used to bake them in would be too big, yet when they came out of the oven they had puffed beautifully to the top of the dish!  I was low on Cheddar so I made up the difference with pepper-jack cheese and it proved to be an excellent substitution that added an interesting flavor.  I particularly liked the dill and was happy I still had some fresh in my garden. I only made a small portion of this recipe for just the two of us so I was able to trim the baking time in half. All puffed and golden and garnished with fresh chopped green onion, this was just as pretty as it was delicious.

Mashed potatoes are comfort food at it's best, but add cheese and sour cream and you have something rich and delicious!  Not something I'd make everyday mind you, but once in a while you have to splurge.  The addition of the dill weed was interesting and proved to be a nice touch.  Not sure I'd ever use this as a dip for potato chips as in the description, but delicious none the less.

Tonight was my second time trying this recipe, and it's still way too runny. I cut down the milk to 1/2 cup and the butter to 1/4 cup, but it still too runny. I think running the potatoes through the food processor makes them runny, so next time, I'll try mashing them by hand.

These were so good even before I put them in the oven, I couldn't stop eating them! When I took them out of the oven they were too thin, more like mashed potato soup. Next time I will just skip the oven step.

I made this recipe last night.  It was much too 'soupy'.  I may make it again using less milk and less dill weed.  We are not a fan of dill.  I would cut back on the cheese in the main recipe too.  I love mashed potatoes; but this wasn't my favorite.

Totally sinful but good!!!   Those who have had trouble with it thickening up might not have used BAKING POTATOES.  I would think that is the problem.

I didn't make it as a casserole, just as mashed potatoes with the ingredients.  Don't use dill. Husband didn't like it because of the sour cream flavor, so won't be making again.

Delicious! My family said it tasted like twice baked potatoes. Will definitely try this again. It was a little runny and will try less milk next time.

This was a side at thanksgiving and was a huge hit! I substituted Gruyere cheese- highly recommended. Even my mother in law who is "portion control" queen had a second serving. Easy and delicious.

I slightly modified the amount of sour cream and used red potatoes (about 8 large reds)and they were great.  I did not add the dill but instead sprinkled some garlic and onion salt in and they were out of this world.

Totally Yummy!
I was afraid that it was going to be too much dill weed, but it was totally yummy! Me and my husband devoured it! It goes great with Dad's cheesy bacon wrapped meat loaf!!

I can't comment on the amounts of each ingredient for this recipe, because I just kind of eye-balled the milk and sour cream and butter and used what I had left of the cream cheese. I did not add any cheese into the potatoes, only on top. I didn't bake them longer than just melting the cheese on top. Tastey, but I still prefer simple milk and butter mashed potatoes (nothing to do with this recipe though!)
