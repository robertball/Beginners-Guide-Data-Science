I made the recipe with a cup of coconut milk and 1/4 cup milk instead of using only milk. I also fried them in a combo of butter and coconut oil. They were amazing. I highly suggest it.

If I could give it more stars I would.  I've tried lots of pancake recipes and have found some excellent ones.  My husband took two bites, dropped his fork, and said "ok, this one goes at the top of the pancake recipes list."

Great recipe, only thing I changed was the amount of salt, I only put a quarter of what the recipe calls for. The perfect pancakes.

This is the ONLY pancake recipe I like. I actually HATE pancakes. There is no taste of baking soda, they rise perfect and moist but aren't wet in the middle. It is easily pipeable into fun shapes, which my daughter loves. Do not add more milk. My suggestion is use a half cup measure and let what batter comes get cooked and what stays behind go into the next pancake; there is no need for a spatula. Also, these make great waffles. I stick to the recipe except I do use coconut oil for both frying and in the batter and a high quality gluten-free flour.

I had trouble with the pancake batter being too thick.  I had to add more milk and then after it sat for 10 minutes, I had to add more.  The pancakes are good and the syrup is yummy.  They do make a good combination.

Delicious! I didn't make the syrup, but the pancakes were awesome! The only thing I did different was added a dash or two of cinnamon. It was like eating banana bread in pancake form! Yum!

I did make a few additions by using 1 c WW flour, 1/2 c almond flour, 1/2 c chopped pecans, 1/2 c shredded coconut, upped the vanilla to 1 T and added 1 t almond extract.  Added 1/2 t baking soda so that I could use buttermilk instead of regular milk.  Let the mixture rest for about 15-20 mins before cooking.  These came out really light and moist.  A Big Hit!!!

I was only looking for a good recipe for banana pancakes, so I only made the pancakes and not the syrup.  One day I think I'll make the coconut syrup as the recipe sounds tasty.  So my review is for the pancakes alone.

I have made this recipe several times and they are always good.  I noticed that many reviews said that they didn't make the syrup... Please make the syrup!  It's easy and delicious!!!  The syrup is a nice compliment to the subtle banana taste.  Yum!

I have tried several banana pancake recipes, and this one is BY FAR the best! The pancakes came out light and fluffy, with a great banana flavor. I didn't make the coconut syrup and they were still delicious. My husband and I both loved them!

These turned out good!  Although, mine wasn't as fluffy as I would likes them but its probably the better banana pancakes that I have tried on this site.

Yummy after I added buttermilk instead of milk. Also added 1tsp of baking soda. Also had to add more buttermilk because it was so thick. Syrup is a must!

Fantastic pancakes! Very subtle banana flavour and smooooooth texture :)
The only change I made was to cut salt in half, as I use salted butter. And I didn't make the syrup this time, but maybe next time... :)

I try to make these every single Saturday as I am obsessed and my family loves them. I make the recipe just as stated. at first the buttermilk syrup would confuse me because I knew nothing about buttermilk syrup. I had never had buttermilk syrup so the foam on top threw me off I would skim it. Now that I’ve made it several times I will add sprinkles for the kids also Yesterday I had to extremely right bananas and didn’t want to waste one so I used to and went a little bit extra on the flour and baking powder it was everything! It made this five-star recipe even better they even cooked better on the skillet.  The coconut buttermilk syrup is like nothing I’ve ever tasted and I want to make these plus the syrup for my family when they come this month.  Also yesterday I started making everything and realized I had no buttermilk I took a scant cup of milk and added a heaping tablespoon of lemon juice and within five minutes I had buttermilk.

Super good. I loved the syrup, I have tried a couple different recipes and this one is my favorite. Pancakes were super fluffy and had a great texture. If you like a more pronounced banana flavor I would recommend using another half or more of a banana. I just cut some up and used them to garnish to get the flavor I wanted. Overall, I will be Using this recipe any time I’m feeling pancakes!

LOVE this recipe. The syrup is a must as well. I substituted coconut milk for the buttermilk to make a coconut syrup and it is yummy! Love the tip about frying pancake in half butter and half coconut oil.

This is my family's new favorite pancake recipe.  The banana adds great flavor.  I didn't have all of the ingredients to make the syrup, so we just used maple syrup.  Can't wait to make them again and try the coconut syrup.

I made this because I wanted to use an overripe banana. The recipe was wonderful. I made it with maple syrup to sweeten instead of sugar. I also used almond milk. I didn’t make the syrup or use the coconut. I put in 1/2 cup of chopped pecans. These pancakes were delicious.

Wow these are amazing! I didn’t have any coconut extract so I used coconut flakes in the syrup and coconut oil on the griddle. It had just a little hint of coconut and it was sooo good! Next time I’ll buy some coconut extract to do it the original recipe way to see how it compares. I kind of likes having the little flakes of coconut in the texture...

I will make this again for sure!  It was delicious.  Pancakes have a great banana flavor and they are moist.  The coconut syrup is delicious.  Be sure to make the syrup in a larger saucepan than you think you need, because when you add the soda, it increases in size and foams up.  I didn't have buttermilk on hand, so I filled 3/4 measuring cup almost full of milk and added about 1-1 1/2 tsp. apple cider vinegar as a substitute.  Worked just fine.

I did not have coconut extract so I added a cup of shredded coconut to the sugar/buttermilk & simmered it. Turned out pretty good.

These are fantastic!  They are easy to make, are fluffy and the most yummy pancakes.  The syrup is also very easy to make and are the perfect pairing for the incredible pancakes.  The hubby says these are his new favourite.  I followed the recipe exactly, no substitutions are necessary as I can’t see how they could be improved upon

The only change I made was to add some coconut extract along with the vanilla. Delicious and fluffy! I topped mine with strawberry yogurt and a blueberry compote. Very yummy! And these pancakes will be great warmed up in a toaster for a quick breakfast!

Instant family favourite!! Banana pancake + homemade coconut syrup = perfect combination. My family felt like we were eating breakfast in Hawaii. 
I made a triple batch and my family of 6 gobbled them up with enough leftover for breakfast the next morning. I took the advice of another reviewer and substituted 1 (400ml) can of coconut milk for some of the milk in the pancakes. Also reduced the salt to one good sprinkling and added an extra very ripe banana (4 in total). 
DO NOT SKIP THE SYRUP!! It is amazing. 1 batch of the syrup was enough for my triple batch of pancakes, and I made it exactly as directed. I never have buttermilk in the house so I made my own (add 3 tbsp of vinegar to measuring up them fill to 1-1/2 cups with milk, allow 5-min to "curdle"). Word of CAUTION if using homemade buttermilk: when you add the baking soda to the syrup at the end, it causes a chemical reaction with the vinegar and rapidly expands. Syrup MUST be made in an enormous soup pot to avoid spillage/burning. 
Our family doesn't like nuts but you could definitley add some crushed macadamia nuts to the pancakes for extra Hawaii-ness. 
Notes to myself: when using flat grill on 2 side elements with bridge, Bridge: between LO and 2; Back: right below MED. Spray with PAM (not butter) to avoid burning. Flip after 4-min, 4-5-min on other side.

Used Pillsbury gluten free flour, coconut milk and did not refrigerate. Topped with sweet coconut flakes  before turning. Served with blueberries. No syrup. Wonderful. Wonderful.

I have gluten problems, so I made these with organic gluten free brown rice flower. It turned out great for my taste considering I have not had a pancake for several years.  My husband even said they were delicious, and he is not a pancake lover.

I substituted coconut milk for the milk due to milk allergies in the home but we loved them! I also added chocolate chips. My kids devoured them!

My boyfriend hates any type of "bready" food, pancakes included. I on the other hand love pancakes, crepes, french toast, etc. I got him to give these a go one day for dinner, and we both loved them! Now he will actually ASK for banana pancakes when he gets home. This recipe turns out nice and fluffy also. I do use coconut milk instead of regular milk. I will either cook them in butter or coconut oil. Both work well. I'll admit to only making the coconut syrup once, and wasn't crazy about it. It's okay, but it wasn't anything special to me. We prefer making the pancakes and adding strawberries. Strawberry topping and whipped cream would be just like a restaurant. I will add that these are also very filling! They are heavy pancakes.

I made it as described but cut the salt in half. I had no problem with the batter being thick, but I used a really ripe banana, and whipped it until extremely soft before mixing with the batter.

I made the syrup but didn't have buttermilk so used watered down plain yogurt. It turned out great, very similar to buttermilk syrup (my favorite). It is pretty sweet and I feel it needs good bacon to balance some of the sweetness.i

I made them and my husband loved them. They weren't as fluffy because I read the measurements incorrectly. Is it suppose to be 1- 1/4 cup of milk or 1&1/4 cup of milk? Those measurements through me off but they were still delicious. I will definitely make them again along with the syrup. My husband loved the syrup but I thought it was extremely sweet for my taste. Overall great recipe

These pancakes are fantastic! My husband, the pancake eater, loved them. I am not very fond of pancakes, but this time I really enjoyed them. We doubled the recipe but did not make the syrup. Used buttermilk instead of milk; added a dash of cinnamon, and a dash of unsweetened cocoa powder They had a mild banana taste, so  we thought we could add 1 or 2 more bananas next time we make them.

Came out great,  great idea to mix the smashed banana with an electric mixer! We added sugar to the batter. Pancakes cooked up perfectly using vegetable oil and 1/4 cup batter per pancake,  nice crispy edges and thick pancakes. The syrup recipe is not as good as the buttermilk syrup I usually make: 1/2 cup butter,  3/4 cup sugar,  1/2 cup buttermilk- combine over medium heat until sugar dissolves,  remove from heat and add 1 teaspoon baking soda and 1 teaspoon vanilla (can substitute coconut extract). I did like the coconut flavor over the banana pancakes.  We added chocolate chips to the pancakes. The banana flavor was subtle and perfect.

Delicious! Minor changes: replaced milk with light coconut milk and did not use coconut oil extract. The pancakes were light and syrup really took it to another level.

This might be my favorite recipe on this site. Everyone loved these, even the kids who also loved the coconut syrup.  A single recipe for us is ok with nooo leftovers. Made a double and it made 15-16 1/3 c pancakes (3 per griddle).  Do not need to double the syrup, there's plenty even for double. Used 3 small bananas for that batch.
