This is really good. I have tried it with both frozen and fresh spinach and I liked it better with the frozen.

I've made this three times and I think I've finally got it perfected. I used 4 jalapenos chopped coarsely. To cut back on fat, I used 1/2 cup mayo and 1/2 cup light chive/onion cream cheese (instead of 1 full cup mayo.) I used 1/2 bag of fresh spinach leaves. I also used salt, pepper and a sprinkling of crushed red pepper flakes. I then spread it in the baking dish and sprinkled with parmesan that would brown nicely. Spicy, hot and good!

I would recommend not using marinated artichokes for this recipe like I did.. It made the dip quite vinegary in my opinion... otherwise this is delicious!  My friends all liked it.. I double the recipe, and had leftovers for a few days.. great with pita chips.. yum!!!  Also..I think next time, I will use cream cheese instead of mayo to make it a bit cheesier.

The is the BEXT artichoke and Spinach Dip recipe I have ever had and I've been looking for quite a while.  I used frozen chopped spinach (thawed and drained) instead of the fresh and it turned out wonderful.  It makes a big enough pan to bring to a potluck.  Thanks for this one, I'll be making it again and again!

Yum!!  I cut back on the spinach and just chopped half an 8 oz bag of fresh baby spinach and it was perfect.  Will make it again!

I decided to leave off the spinach, (not a family favorite), and mozz cheese. It's important to drain the artichoke hearts very well, otherwise It can result in a very oily dip. I fried the jalepenos, (we used 3-4), sprinkled cajun pepper on them and then put into processor. I also saved time and ran the hearts through the food processor as well. We fry our own tortilla chips w/ corn tortillas, which hands down will beat any store bought anyday. Besides, my husband and I enjoy sharing the kitchen time together. Always a hit in the small crock when I take it places, or at home.

I have chopped up shrimp and crab meat to put into this also.  I also have sprinkled slivered and chopped, toasted almonds on top for a garnish and more texture.  I have also added chopped red bell pepper for extra color.  Always a hit!

Almost perfect as is. I used cream cheese instead of mayo for extra cheesiness. I also omitted the peppers because I don't like spicy and it was GREAT! I added some black pepper. I made it with soy cheeses and soy sour cream. It was great! Will definatly make again

Awesome, just as written.  I used fresh spinach, and placed in 4 small bowls for easier serving, and storing of leftovers.  I just finished up one of them for lunch, and was a good as the day I made it.  Thanks E for the great recipe.

I made this recipe for my Mom who loves artichokes. It turned out really well and she seemed to enjoy it. The only thing I would do different is less mayo and more cream cheese (my preference). I served it with garlic flavored triscuits, very good!!! Thanks for sharing.

Do not judge this recipe from the picture.  It looks much better in person.  I did not like the peppers in this recipe so I exchanged them with  garlic and chilli powder.  That seemed to work MUCH better.

I made this dip at Christmas. Everyone loved it. It's very nice and warm for a cold winter day! You can make it ahead and bake it right before it is served.

I started to make this for a party the other night and found that I had forgotten a couple of things when I went shopping.  I improvised, used regular onion, no jalapeno or artichokes, and frozen spinach.  When I told our friends it wasn't the exact recipe they told me not to do anything different next time.  BTW, with another spinach dip recipe I tried, I discovered that leftover spinach dip with cheese can go in the fridge and heats up great in the microwave the next day.

I made this for a new year's eve party. It was a hit!  I used the idea of lessening the mayo by using 1/2 cup mayo and the other 1/2 onion/chive cream cheese. Everyone loved it!  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this stuff tonight, took it to a party, and watched as the crowd devoured it. Simply amazing stuff. I did make some changes, though. I used cram cheese instead of mayonnaise in accordance with recommendations from other users. I also had to use a serano pepper, because jalepenos are hard to find right now with the salomanella outbreak. Thus, I added some hot sauce to kick things up. This stuff is the heat!

This doesn't taste like dip to me. I think it's the mayo. I prefer cream cheese I guess. But I like the lemon a lot. So why did I give it a ****? Because to "fix" it I added salt/pepper/more jalapeno and maybe another 8 oz of spinach and made maybe the best creamed spinach I've ever had! Won't ever make this as dip again, but will definitely make it as a side dish with lots & lots of spinach!

I needed something to take to a party and had crackers but no cream cheese. This was it! It was very good and made a lot which my family and I gobbled up. I still like the version with the cream cheese better but I guess this one is a little better for your health :)

By far the best dip! I halved it and made the perfect amount for an appetizer before supper.I also cut down on the garlic and I found it to be perfect! Thanks for a great recipe ;)

This is not the best artichoke and spinach dip I have ever made but it was easy and interesting.  I especially liked the lemon juice - gave it a bit of pucker.  I added 2 Thai peppers instead of 1 jalepeno - big mistake - they were way to hot and I discovered that I do not like the heat that the peppers give to this dip.  I'll make this again but nix the peppers altogether.

This was VERY tasty!  I didn't have jalapeno on hand, nor the green onions, I substituted dashes of red pepper and it added just the right amount of kick!  I used frozen spinach, well drained so it would not get "soupey"  Once I took it out of the oven after 20 minutes, I sprinkled a dash of paprika with the lemon juice for presentation.  I will have to keep this recipe on hand, thank you!!

This was tastey, but not my favorite.  My husband thought it had a slightly sweet taste -- and he wished it didn't.  Though honestly it may have just been that I used Miracle Whip instead of plain mayo.

Great recipe, the jalapeno gives it a nice kick, to keep it from being bland. I have made it several times for parties, and everybody loves it, even my anti-vegetable husband.

This was wonderful, everyone enjoyed this at Thanksgiving. It was the first time I have ever cooked anything for my family, since I just started cooking this year. Everyone was pleased.  I did however cut back on the jalepinos, not everyone likes spicy stuff and it still turned out well.

Fabulous recipe! I especially like the addition of the jalapeno peppers to set this apart from the rest. I have made this dip twice, and each time, it was the first item to disappear. There are no leftovers with this dish!

I didn't have green onions, so I omitted them and added a little more jalapeno.  It was absolutely delicious.  Everybody loved it.

First time I ever tried a dish like this was at Applebee's and always wished I could make it at home.  This recipe is just like, but even better than the dish at Applebee's.  It's easy and was a big hit at the party I made it for.  Not an expensive dish to make and there was a mountain of it to go around.  I LOVE this dish.

This dip was excellent - even better the next day! My only complaint is that this dip is NOT spicy at all. Consider using more peppers and/or hot sauce.

We liked it.  It's not the best artichoke and spinach dip we've tried,but it is one of the better ones.  My only complaint is I would've liked more "zing!" to come through from the jalepeno.  The taste isn't worth the lack of heat.

This is a hit! It's a nice change from the "usual" artichoke dip because of the zing. Thanks!

I have been making this for years and it's my two grown kids favorite!  So today Thanksgiving 2018 I made it for my grandkids. My son felt he had to taste it before taking picture.

I made this with fresh bay shrimp instead of artichokes due to my dads request and loved it. I do agree with some of the other comments, I will definitely use cream cheese next time instead of mayo and sour cream but it was still great!

Loved it. Only real changes were to add a little cheddar jack cheese over the top, plus I substituted Veganaise for half the suggested mayo, but added a little nonfat Greek plain yogurt instead. I didn't put as much jalapeno as I would have liked due to serving it at a reception. This was wonderful. I doubled the recipe and came home with about a Tbs. of it left!

Made as written except that I used half the spinach because that is all my dish would hold. EXCELLENT! The fresh spinach made all the different in the world to the other artichoke dips I've had in the past.

My husband has made this dip at least 30 times just as the recipe states with rave reviews every single time.  He is now known for this dip and is asked repeatedly to bring it for potlucks.  Its actually to the point where he is sick of making it!!  But, he sacrifices and brings it because everyone absolutely loves it.  We serve it with tortilla chips.

My friends love it.  I spice it up by adding three Jalapenos instead of one.  I also add 1/4 cup more of each cheese and 5oz more spinach.
