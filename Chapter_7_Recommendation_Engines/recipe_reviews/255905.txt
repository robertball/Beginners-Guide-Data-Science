I loved this idea! The thyme and red onions are great! I am obsessed with marinated artichoke hearts right now so I had those and not the capers. It still added the pickled flavor. Iâ€™ve made a version of this sandwich 4 times in a week. Sharp cheddar on top. Broiled. Yummy.

Yummy!  Loved the addition of capers and thyme.  Perfect with my crab corn soup.
