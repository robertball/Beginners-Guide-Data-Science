This recipe is really fantastic. I didn't use nearly the full amount of sour cream mixture - I would probably only make half the recipe for that next time. I am not a fan of raw onion, so I sauteed the onion and tomato together for about 10 minutes while I prepped everything else, then added in the tomatilla sauce to it a couple minutes before it was done cooking, spread that around the outside of the tortilla and then sprinkled some diced avocado over top. I think just to make it simpler, I might use a Tablespoon or two of salsa sprinkled around the outside edge along with the avocado (in place of the onion / tomato) next time. This was SUPER filling and really, really delicious. I ate it for lunch and really enjoyed it!! (I was out of refried beans, so I smooshed up some cooked pinto beans in place of it).

Super tasty!  The recipe made too much salsa and sour cream sauce, but for us that was okay because I used it for burritos they next night.

This was a nice change of pace breakfast for Mr. LTH (I'm not a fan of eggs, but I did try a bite).  I didn't have any tomatoes, so I elected to use salsa on the edges, mixed w/the Herdez(R) sauce.  Mr. LTH did deem it "spicy" on first bite, but I think that may have been the salsa?  I'm lazy, so I nuked the beans and cheese rather than warming them on the stove top.  This dirties a lot of dishes and the results aren't the most attractive, but they do taste good!  THANKS for the recipe, ItalianSpice.

This was super good!  I made the "refried beans without the refry" recipe from this site to use on this.  I had to cut back on the sauce since my husband is not a big fan of spicy foods. He asked me to make this for him again! :) Very Yummy!
