The Philippine leche flan uses 9-10 egg yolk and 1 tbsp lemon juice added to the melted sugar.  Vanilla extract is sometimes used to flavor, never almond extract.

easy, but way too much almond, and too sweet.  I like a good flan, and almond flavoring, and this was not appealing.

Easy to make. Absolutely delicious and you don't have to wait to eat it.  It just mellows out and tastes better if you do!

I have some suggestions: I think 1 tablespoon almond extract is little bit too much; maybe ?teaspoon will be better. Instead of 6 egg yolks, I put 5 whole eggs.

As it stands there is definitely too much almond flavor even for me.  I have found that, if it is available where you live, substitute almond liqueur for the flavoring - a little more subtle.

I give a four because the recipe needs help, but if you help it, it's delicious! First of all, try 1-2 teaspoons of almond extract instead of a tablespoon. Second, refer to the Perfect Flan article on how to make this dessert just right. Don't forget, if you precook the milk and temper the eggs with it, the oven bake time will be cut down, so keep an eye on it. Third, if you use ramekins, this recipe will probably not fill 8 of them. My ramekins are fairly small, and my flans came out very thin. I garnished my flans with toasted slivered almonds, French Lace Cookies II, and piped sweetened whipped cream.

This did not taste like flan at all.  It was way too sweet and had a strange taste to it. I follwed the recipe exactly so I am not sure what happened.  If you are looking for a recipe for flan, this is not it. I will not try this again.

Good recipe.  I'd recommend using more condensed milk though.

One cup of sugar and 1/4 cup of water never turns brown unless you cook it to a hard crack stage.  NOT what you want in this recipe.  Next time I would decrease the water by half and try that.

Pure vanilla extract works well with leche flan; you may also add a few lime or lemon zest to neautralize the taste of the egg yolks.

This is too dense and sweet. I much prefer using 2 c. regular milk and half a cup of cream for a perfect, satiny, texture.

I made this exactly as the recipe instructed and it was fabulous!  No way did anyone think there was too much almond flavoring.  Everyone went back for seconds and some for third helpings.  Nothing left.  I served it ringed with fresh raspberries.
