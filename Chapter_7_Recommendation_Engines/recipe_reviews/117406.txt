Very good salmon recipe.  I also added a bit of garlic to the marinade and marinated it for about 45 min.  I think next time I will marinate it longer.  Served this over brown rice and sauteed napa cabbage seasoned with a little soy sauce and pepper.  Delicious!

Pretty tasty!  I did add garlic powder, and used Olive oil instead of Sesame.  Instead of grilling, I baked it for 13 minutes at 400.  Next time, I'll cut the soy sauce down some, as it was a bit strong.

I really enjoyed this. It gives a new taste to salmon. I put double the ginger called for. I put the recommended amount of red pepper flakes and it was good but if you like a kick, double the red pepper flakes. I didn't have sesame oil and subsituted olive oil instead. This would be great with some sort of asian noodles. Enjoy!

Very jummy! Added the juice of a lemon to the marinade and as I had the oven on I covered it and baked it at 200C for 1/2 hour.

Wow, this was great.  I didn't have a grill so I pan fried it on med for a few minutes, still turned out wonderful.  I served this with steamed broccoli and rice =) Definite favorite.

Very tasty. We used regular soy sauce (not reduced sodium), half the brown sugar, fresh ginger and also added some fresh garlic. Tasted better than anything we've had in a restaurant. I saved the leftover glaze because I think it will go well on shrimp, too.

This was delicious! Perfect just as is. We cooked it on a cedar plank on the grill and that really complemented it well. Definitely a keeper- we'll be making this again! It reminded me of a dish we had at a local trendy restaurant (they also cooked it on a cedar plank)- $21 a  plate!

Loved it!  Exactly what I was looking for to do Salmon.  I did more ginger as well and I did garlic, but not a ton.  Overall, this recipe is excellent if you are looking for a good glaze.  Not too sweet, not too salty.  I grilled it and I recommend grilling it on the meat side first and then flipping it over to the skin side (assuming you have a skin side) and finishing there.  It falls right off the skin when it is done, which reminds me that I left the skin on the grill, gotta go it.

Delicious and easy.  I broiled it 4 - 5 minutes per side.  My family loved it.  I will definitely make this again.

My wife doesn't care to much for ginger so I subed in garlic. The salmon I used was a little over 1.5lbs, there was one small piece left and we had corn on the cob and salad as well. It's so good you better make extra.

I didn't have reduced sodium soy sauce so I used the regular.  I also substituted ground red pepper, because that's what I had.  No sesame oil so I used EVOO.  The family loved it!  I would definitely make again.

Wow! This was really good. We definitely enjoyed this dish and will be making it again. I followed the recipe exactly and it came out really great. Next time I will try using fresh ginger instead because I prefer it to ground. Also, everything tastes better on the BBQ, I would highly recommend using it!

Followed the recipe to a "T", and it was FANTASTIC and easy.  I just pan fried my filet, as it is the dead of winter in Wisconsin..no outdoor grilling for me for a couple of months.  Thanks!

Great recipe!!! I cut down on the brown sugar and added organic agave (picked up from TJs) to ensure a glazed.  I let it marinade for about 30mins but next time i will do it for at least 1hr.
It was delicious! Baked for 8 mins and broiled for 4 mins.

This was great. I broiled in the oven for 10 mins. I didn't have sesame oil so I used olive oil and sesame seeds. GREAT sauce, just like in the restaurants.

Yummy! I actually made the recipe with tilapia fillets (since they were on sale) and they came out great!  My husband told me that he could eat the fillets alone without any accompaniments, they were so good :).  Even my choosy preschooler ate them happily!  I added 1/4 tsp of garlic salt (per other reviewers) and the results were great!  Tks for a keeper of a recipe!!

Very simple and tasty. Well done. Might also be good with an extra bit of pepper to spice it up.
