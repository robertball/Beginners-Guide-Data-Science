Today's pork chops do not need cooking that long especially on the grill.  A butterfly chop should only take 15-20 minutes and then only to reach 155รป internal temp and juices are clear.
From a pork producer.

I really liked this marinade.  I ended up using a little more honey to give it a slightly sweeter taste. I couldn't believe how well these ingredients went together.  I also marinated the pork all day long and they turned out great.

I didn't really care for these, I thought the worchestershire sauce taste was too strong.  Perhaps I should have added more honey although I had already added more than the recipe called for.  My husband however liked them.

Excellent flavor, and chops were very tender.  Be careful not to over-grill, and set your burners on low...because they cook FAST.  Mine ended up a little "char-broiled", but still tasted wonderful.

This was excellent.  I used about half of the Worcestershire and used an even amount of honey.  Delicious!  Definitely a keeper.

Really, really tasty.  About as easy as it gets.  I just eyeballed it but may use a tad more honey next time.  Get a nice thick cut and cook it slowly.

Be sure not to use too much pepper.  Also, be sure to cook all the way through.  I had to put the meat back on the grill a few times.

Delicious! I also took the suggestions of using 1/2 worchestire and 1/2 soy sauce.  I used thin cut pork chops but next time I will use a thicker cut.  Very very good!

Too much Worcestershire for our taste, perhaps soy sauce would be better with only a couple tablespoons of Worcestershire.  I might try that.

It sounds wonderful. I will try it in a day or two. Just a thought though...the person who listed this recipe may want to describe what "butterfly" means. I know what it mean but many people may not know and the recipe doesn't describe this process.

I couldn't believe how well worcestershire sauce goes with pork.  It is a large amount which was a little surprising but it was AWESOME.  We will definitely make this again and the butterflied chops were so tender after being made on the grill.

Great pork chops! I was looking for a recipe that didn't call for breaded pork chops. This was great and tasty! I do recommend them marinating around 8+ hours. I was so hungry I made them about 2 hours after marinating but left one marinating overnight and of course the overnight marinated was better.

It was a rushed evening so I didn't let the pork chops marinade at all. They still tasted great though! They were really moist and it was an easy recipe so it was wonderful.

I didn't find this recipe had given a lot of flavour to the pork.  I found it a little on the dry side.

We didn't care for this recipe.  Perhaps we should have added more honey to balance out the acidic nature of the worcesteshire sauce?  Any way, it's not something that we'll try again.

My husband and I really didn't find anything special about this recipe. Our 4-year-old didn't care for it at all. It's not the flavor was bad, it just wasn't that good.

This was so quick and easy to fix; just put in the fridge and turn every now and then; then broil 15-20 min on the grill.  I got raves from everyone at the table.

These were good, not great, but a very easy quick meal.  Do NOT cook for time noted.  They should be cooked 20 minutes maximum.

As others have commented, the Worcestershire sauce was kind of strong.  I even added 2 T of honey.  IT was good though.  My husband also liked them.

Very simple.  Very delicious.  I marinated the pork chops for about 5 hours and grilled for about 20 min, turning occasionally.

These were really good.  They definitely did not need to be on the grill as long as stated in the recipe.  I grilled them about 15 minutes, which was plenty.  Husband and son really enjoyed them.  Easy and cheap to make.  Will put this in the rotation.

I made some slight modifications including adding more honey, leaving out the onion (personal preference) and marinating the chops for 6 hours verses the 4 and they turned out very moist and delicious.I only cooked these for about 10 minutes but I was using a george foreman grill (it's winter in IL so outside grilling isn't really and option) which gets very hot but they still turned out great. My bf ate 3 and he's not even a big fan of pork chops!

I liked that this was a quick & simple recipe; just marinade & cook.  I cook just for myself, so I used 2 pork chops that were actually butterfly cut.  Thus, they were little chops.  It only took about 5 minutes to grill on each side in my little cooker that I ordered from an informercial, so I appreciate the quick & easy. This tasted good, nothing really to rave about but I I liked the tangy and sweet mix from the worcestershire sauce and honey.  After making this easy recipe, it just now occurred to me to try different variations on the marinade, so I'm glad to have come across it.

This is so easy to make! I used boneless pork chops instead of butterfly chops and it turned out perfect. Thanks for a delicious new way to enjoy pork chops.

Delicious & so easy, my kind of recipe! My pork chops were really thick but still came out tender & juicy. Delicious with Red Garlic Mashed Potatoes from this site.

Pork turned out okay, but the flavor wasn't anything special.  Kids (6 & 4) didn't like it.

Super quick and easy! I used 1/2 worcestershire sauce and 1/2 soy (based on the previous comment and I didn't want too strong or a worcestershire flavor). The sodium in the sauces kept the meat tender. My husband already requested it again!

Pork was tender but family found that the Worcestershire sauce flavor was a bit overwhelming. I might try it with Soy sauce next time.

We loved this.  I followed the directions exactly and we grilled the marinated pork chops on the grill.  My picky family loved them.  Definitely a do-over for us!

I enjoyed these very much.  Next time I will add a little more honey to the mix.  I let mine marinate all day, and they were quite good!

Very Good!!! Even my picky son loved these, and that's saying alot. Only had thin cut chops, am definitely going to get a thicker cut next time. Had a wonderful color and flavor.

I didn't like this recipe, the pork chops were tough after several hours of marinating and they had a vinegar taste, I will not make this recipe again.

Good grief this is good, and I am not a fan of the pork chop. 
Just ate some and want more!!! I didn't measure, just tried to mix about
half honey and half WS & didn't even remember to add pepper. Sooo good. 
I'll be making this again!

I followed the recipe ingredients exactly and cooked the chops under the broiler....they were so excellent! I will definitely make these again. I used thick chops and did not butterfly them.

I was excited by the simplicity of the recipe and the use of common pantry items, however, this  was missing something.  I followed the suggestion of others and adjusted the honey and worchestershire but it still only tasted ok.

These turned out beautiful. They looked delicious, but did not taste as good as they looked, kind of dry.

This recipe is yummy. I didn't have any Worcestershire sauce left so I used Soy Sauce. Next tine I try with the Worcestershire sauce.
