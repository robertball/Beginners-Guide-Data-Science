It was a little too sweet for my liking, ended up adding water to bring down the sweetness. I also added two star anise to give it some additional flavor (just like my mom made). Overall, good recipe, I would make again.

This recipe is great. Be careful not to overcook the eggs and also understand that 'shallots' is not a unit of measurement. The shallots I bought from the store were much bigger than average, a fact I was not aware of until I finished the recipe and realized I had way too much in the recipe!

This was very good, but you do have to watch the sugar carefully or it will quickly go from cartelized to a hard, burnt lump. Yes, that was my mistake . . . second try was better, but my vietnamese husband still added 2 TB of chicken marinade for coloring. Very easy, and, according to my spouse, very authentic.
