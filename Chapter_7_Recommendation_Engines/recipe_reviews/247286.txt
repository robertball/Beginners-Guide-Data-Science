I don't care for grits but made these for my husband and he gave me the thumbs up. I didn't see the cook's notes until after the fact but I will use milk next time for a creamier consistency. According to the husband, wasabi was a great addition to grits.

This is such a good idea!  I did have to add some salt, but these are really spectacular.  I served them with lamb chops and vegetables.  Marvelous.
