Very good.  The servings shown is certainly right on.  It's too rich to eat any more.  It's quite creamy in the  middle to be like a real quiche but we enjoyed it all the same.  I even tried it cold and enjoyed it, though it wouldn't be my preference. I'd make it again.

There's a whole lotta cheese in these squares! Followed recipe to a tee. Super easy to make and are quite delish right out of the pan. I've had a similar square and these ones stand out because of the CRACKER BARREL Crumbled Feta Cheese with Oregano, Sun Dried Tomatoes and Black Pepper. YUMMO. These are eat the same day squares. The next day, not so good.  Glad we tried them.

I like that this is crustless and that you can add to it. Watching my weight I used fresh mushrooms and spinach and added additional spices like a Tuscan mix and nutmeg. Easy and satisfying!

I love spanakopita and loved this Spinach-and-Feta pie.  This recipe is a keeper.  The CRACKER BARREL Crumbled Feta Cheese with Oregano, Sun Dried Tomatoes and Black Pepper, added great flavour.   #EndWithAmazing #Ad #AllrecipesAllstarsCA

Made this just as in the recipe and these are very tasty! Like another reviewer said, these taste best hot out of the oven.  The cut squares do freeze well on a cookie sheet covered with parchment paper, and don't take a lot of freezer space once in a freezer bag.  20 minutes in a hot oven and these are an impressive and quick snack for unexpected guests.  I will certainly make these again

Excellent!    I loved it.  My husband, however hated it.  I froze it and have been eating it myself and enjoy it every time.  My daughter saw the recipe in my collection and thought her family would like it.

If I could rate this less than 1 star, I would. I prepared per recipe directions and what I ended up with was a blob of spinach. The texture was AWFUL! If you're considering making this recipe, don't do it. It was an abysmally disappointing waste of ingredients.

I loved this recipe! If you like Macedonian/ Mediterranean food. You will love this! Very flavorful!  I followed recipe exactly. I doubled it, as I needed 24 servings, not 12.

I'm giving this 5 stars because I couldn't find the seasoned feta in either of my markets were I shop, so I improvised.  I threw in 2 TBS minced sundried tomatoes, a 1/2 teas oregano, 2 cloves of minced garlic, and fresh grated nutmeg to.  After making it the first time, I thought it was to "floury".  I cut back on the flour by 1/3 cup.   This made the pie taste delicious.  I've also thrown in a cup of chopped ham as well.  Yum.

These were good and tasted even better the next day! This makes a lot, and would be great for a get together.

I really enjoyed these quiche squares.  I did find there was a bit of a flour-y taste, so I might use a bit less flour next time.  These squares pack a LOT of cheese, so if you like cheese and spinach, you can't really go wrong with these babies.  I will make these again for sure!

Very tasty! So easy to make. Makes a delicious snack or appetizer. The texture is unexpected--not bad--just not very 'quichey' to me. Still, a quick and easy recipe that I would definitely make again.
