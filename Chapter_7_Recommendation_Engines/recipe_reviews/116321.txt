Very rich & creamy! Reminds me of risotto. I didn't have whipping cream so I combined a scoop of sour cream with the milk. Will make again! I'm trying to use up 2 bags of fresh spinach and was happy to use up two heaping cups for this recipe!

this was so good. going into the rotation. everyone loved it. only thing I did different was use a pkg of frozen spinach, it's what I had on hand. I bet fresh would be even better. but good to know frozen works well!

OMG!  SO good.  I am not a huge fan of rice, but my husband is, so I figured I would try this recipe to change things up.  We both declared it the BEST.  We can not stop eating it.  I love creamed spinach but my husband could care less, this combines the best of both worlds and we both think it is so delicious.    I used a 10oz bag of fresh spinach, added an onion, used light cream instead of heavy and made one cup uncooked rice.  This gets two thumbs up and will be making a regular appearance in my weekly rotation.  An easy and tasty way to add veggies in our diet

This recipe was so simple and easy to make!  I did make some adjustments to use what I had in my pantry.  I substituted canned spinach for fresh, and melted butter and whole milk for the heavy cream.  I also used a minced garlic/ginger blend instead of the garlic.  Even my picky toddlers loved this!

This was o.k.  My bf said it was a lil' bland so we added extra cheese.  It was very easy.  We also used frozen spinach, almost a whole pack.  We also mixed in some shrimp that we sauteed with butter and garlic.  I highly recommend it with shrimp to use as a main dish.

I was really happy with this recipe. It was a very quick way to use up left over rice. I added some extra parmesan 'cause I don't think you can ever have too much! I think that two cups of spinach leaves is conservative. I probably used three cups of fresh spinach and still feel like it would have been better with more. I served with steamed asparagus spears which went beautifully with the rice. And grilled fillet steak. I also quickly broiled some cherry tomatoes in the oven until till a little caramelized and scattered them over the steak when serving. The flavor combination was great and it was a really fast, easy and delicious dinner. I will make this rice again. Thanks!

Delish!  I used brown rice instead of white, 10 oz. frozen spinach instead of fresh and sour cream instead of whipping cream.  This is not bland, like I had worried - it's got a great taste!  I made this for a couple day's lunches at work.  Mmmm....

Tasted great, but DO NOT substitute low fat milk for the cream (should've known)! My parmesan turned into glops....fine once you stir it in, but kind of chewy in spots. I'll have to try it again and stick to the recipe!!

This was so different than all my other rice recipes.  It was so tasty!  Paired it with steak.  I added extra spinach, and some extra salt at the end.  Next time I might add some peas.

Interesting, pretty, and very easy to make for a side dish that is a little different, a little special.  Creamy, uniquely delicious flavor for a simple rice dish, and very, very satisfying.  A big pay-off for little effort.

So EASY, elegant looking, and rich. Paired well with lemon baked fish and saute'd green beans. Very creamy & rich, but a little "flat" tasting, so I added more  salt, pepper & some nutmeg. Next time I will add cooked mushrooms: I think it would be better with that added flavor. Will only make again for people who like Alfredo, because it's so rich.

So delicious. Will be adding this to our rotation. I doubled the recipe & used half & half (what I had on hand) instead of whipping cream. Brown rice was wonderful in this. 1-10 oz bag of spinach is approximately 4 C. Thanks for the recipe.

This was soo good, I love the addition of spinach.  It was so creamy, the kids really loved it. I added a little bit more salt and pepper because it seemed a little bland.  Definitely will make this again.

This is a very good combo and way to use fresh spinach.  I h!ad some cream and a bag of spinach that were about to expire and stmbled across this little gem of a recipe.  My husband was not too fond, as he is not a spinach lover, but I thought it was great

Nothing to add or take away form this recipe! It was delicious and simple, just as it was written! I was tempted to add more parmesan, but found that the 1/4 cup was perfect... I was tempted to use regular black peppercorns but went with the white, and I found I appreciated what that contributed too! A great side to go with the delicious chicken breasts in caper cream sauce, also on this site.

This recipe looks amazing, but I had to change it a bit based on what I had in my cupboard.  Hubby still raved!  Here's what I changed: cooked the rice in chicken broth with a teeny bit of garlic; less butter in sauce; whole milk in place of whipping cream; 3/4 cup of shredded parmesan; added about 2 tablespoons of cream cheese; nearly an entire bag of frozen spinach, thawed, then drained on paper towels so it wouldn't be soggy.    My husband and 2 yr old wanted to eat all of it before I managed to get it to the table!  Thank you Diana for this fabulous base recipe!

This was pretty good. I was happy with the texture but the kids were not enamored of the spinach flavor. I think more spices would have helped.

The garlic I used was previously roasted, rather than fresh. I also used some monterey jack as well as parmesan cheese, and short grain rice rather than long. It was ooey and creamy, but it needed some other strong flavor to really make it pop. Maybe my parmesan was inferior, dunno.

Wow! This was so easy to make a so so so delicious! I  doubled the recipe for a family dinner and substituted FF half & half for the heavy cream. I also doubled the garlic since this household loves garlic. This came out so creamy, my hubby thought it was risotto. Went perfectly with breaded chicken cutlets and salad. This will now be going into our weekly rotation. Thanks for sharing Diana!

Amazingly easy and delicious recipe! Goes great with salmon. I probably used closer to 3 cups spinach and real cream is a must (use organic cream, then you will feel at least a little better about it!). Some reviewers mentioned it being too bland. I would recommend increasing the salt to taste. I ended up using about 1/2 tsp. salt. You could also try cooking the rice in chicken broth to add more flavor. I will be making this one again!

This was amazing!  I had a ton of cooked white rice and some fresh spinach I needed to use up, as well as an opened carton of whipping cream that was getting old, and this was the perfect solution!  It tasted kinda like a different version of macaroni and cheese.  Quick, easy, and great for reheating at work on my lunch break.  The only thing I did differently is I added 1/4 of a leftover onion and sauteed it with a teaspoon of minced garlic from a jar, and used cracked black pepper.

Yum! I sauted onions in garlic and butter. I didn't have cream so I used Philadelphia extra light with parmesan. Next time I think I'll add a splash of milk but there's definitely going to be a next time!

Everyone really enjoyed this, even the kids that turned their nose up at the spinach when they saw it go in the pan. Hubby tasted it before serving and thought it was a tad bland. I added a little more salt, white pepper and a couple additional tbsp of cheese. That did the trick. Very good and we will make this often. Thanks for sharing!

I found this recipe to be bland even with the cream and cheese. Wasn't horrible but I probably will not make it again.

I had to sub milk for the cream, added some nutmeg (since pairs well with spinach), extra garlic and some onion. I used fresh-cooked rice but I can see how this would ideally use leftover rice just as well. Repeat for sure!

This was delicious!  I substituted quinoa for rice and evaporated milk for cream.  Everything else the same.  Will make over and over.  We loved it.  My 9month old loved it too:)

LOVED IT!!! I only had brown rice on hand, and I used a bit more garlic and parmesan cheese than the recipe called for but everyone liked this dish. I will definitely make again because it's such an easy way to jazz up regular white or brown rice.

I agree the heavy cream can easily be replaced with half 'n half (or even milk) with little sacrifice in flavor.  A good quality Parm (no green can here!) makes all the difference, too.  And as an added bonus, there is really no need to start with hot cooked rice if there is some hanging around in the fridge from a previous night's dinner... I used cold white rice from take-out and the final dish was still proclaimed awesome.

Oh, I am delighted to have found this recipe!!  Finally a different and delicious side dish that will pair well with just about any meat, fish or poultry!  I did try to cut some of the fat in this by halving the butter and using half and half instead of heavy cream.  The taste and richness were still wonderful.  I used about half of a 9 oz. bag of spinach and just tore the larger leaves in half.  I thought the sauce was a little thin, so as other reviewers stated, I added more parmesan cheese, nearly doubling the amount called for.  I also increased the salt.  This appeared to me to be a little “wet,” so next time I may increase the rice by another half cup.  I’m also wondering if this could be totally prepared ahead of time and reheated in the microwave, which would make this an excellent and easy dish for a dinner party.  Five stars all the way on this one!!!

I loved this!  I made it for 8 servings so I could share with my neighbor.  I used black pepper instead of white since I don't like white pepper.  Next time I think I would top it with fresh chopped tomato or shrimp.  What I like about this the most is how easy it is!

My family was mixed on this.  I would have gave it a 3...it was missing something for me...but my family gave it a 5.  So that's where my 4 came from.  They raved and said it was one of the best sides, so it will be a keeper in my house, especially if it gets them to eat spinach!

This was great! I made a few minor modifications. First, I cooked the rice in vegetable stock for more flavor. Then, I sauteed chopped onion and sliced zucchini along with the garlic. I added 2% milk instead of cream, and it was still rich and wonderful. We will make this often!

I thought the flavor was not to bad. In other reveiws they said it was really creamy, mine was really mushy. It may have been something that I did wrong. Thanks anyway.

Made this for my girls they absolutely LOVED it! We are big fans of spinach. This could have been an appetizer but we make it for dinner. I made no changes just added salt to taste.

Neither my hubs or I cared for this. We both felt this was terribly bland and tasted nothing like Alfredo (or at least any Alfredo dishes we've ever had). Maybe with a bit of tweaking this could be improved, but there are just too many other dishes in my recipe box worth trying first. Maybe this will float your boat, but it did nothing for us (sorry!). Thanks anyways, Diana. :)

I saw this mentioned on the recipe buzz more than once and decided to try it. I had to change the recipe up some to make it healthier. I subbed the heavy cream for ff half and half and used whipped dairy butter instead of stick butter. I used the full amount of parmesan cheese, but could have probably cut that in half to. All I had was frozen spinach and read on-line that 3oz frozen equals 2 cups fresh and used that amount. The only thing I did not like is I used jasmine rice as it was all I had in the house. I would use a soft creamier type rice. I added a pinch of garlic powder to add to the garlic taste. It still seemed like it was missing some flavoring. I really liked the concept, but no one else seemed to really like it. It could have been because I had to resort to low fat dairy, I am not sure? But, I do that all the time. It all didn't get eaten and that is rare.

Just made this. Trying to add some good fiber to dinner. This was so easy and very good. I used whole milk and a gourmet blend of whole grain brown rice. Will make this again.

Very easy and tasty.  Like another reviewer we had spinach & whipping cream about to expire, this was a perfect way to use them.

HOWEVER i will probably double up on the ingredients for a 1 cup of dry rice recipe! thanks again!

4.5 to be fair.  My infant and I really enjoyed it, but had a difficult time gettting the rest of the family to appreciate it.  If you like alfredo, spinach and rice . .you have to try this!!!

Very good, I could have eaten a much bigger serving portion!  I did do some things differently - I cooked finely diced red onion with the rice, I used 2% milk so had to simmer longer to get that nice creamy texture, I garnished with more parmesan cheese, and as it still seemed a bit lacking in flavor, I stirred in some torn fresh basil.

This was quick to make and tasted okay. I didn't have heavy cream so added milk and some sour cream as another reviewer stated. I probably won't make again, it wansn't bad just not something I will really miss if I don't eat it again.

This is really good.  The only thing I changed was using milk instead of cream because it's what I had.  I will definitely make this again.

This was good. I might try changing it a bit. Add some more spinach, maybe some onion, cooking sherry or something to add a little zip. Top with some extra cheese. But over all it was good.

Wonderfully tasty and so quick and easy to prepare! I'm always looking for new ways to serve rice and this one is definitely a keeper. As another reviewer suggested, I added a little extra garlic as well as a little more cheese. Yum!

This is the tastiest rice dish I've ever made!!!  We like garlic so I added a couple extra cloves, and a bit more butter.
