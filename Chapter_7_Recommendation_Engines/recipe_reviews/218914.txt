Absolutely DELUXE! Easy, all the ingredients were already in my pantry, and my family loved it! A 5-star rating as-is. Thank you!

Very salty and too much sage.  The smoked oyster flavor is fairly subtle in this.  Easy but I won't be making it again.

This wasn't bad, but you really have to be an oyster lover to enjoy this stuffing.
