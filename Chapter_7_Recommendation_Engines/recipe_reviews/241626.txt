Cha Cha Chicken Haiku: "Baking time WAY off. Mine done twenty-five minutes. It needed... something." I bet this chicken would taste fabulous if used in AR's "Cha Cha's White Chicken Chili" not just b/c of the identical names but b/c this particular chicken recipe isn't much of a stand-out on its own. The flavor is subtle enough (I used a heavy hand both w/ the lime juice and the Herdez salsa) that the chicken would be best suited for use in a soup quesadilla salad or what-not. For ease of prep and overall taste I'd hover around a 4 but where it's flawed is the baking time of 50-60 min. No chicken breast half should be subjected to that long of baking and I'm glad that I checked mine at 20ish minutes and found it ready.
