I should have paid more attention to the "barely set" note. They taste good but I plan to add some homemade lemon glaze to make them more lemony and add a sweeter zip!

These cookies were a huge hit at work.  So yummy, yet lite.

These cookies are just great. I got a bit over 30 middle sized cookies from this recipe. They made the whole house smell like lemon cake. Just what we needed as the days are getting colder. Will definitely make these again. 
Thank you
