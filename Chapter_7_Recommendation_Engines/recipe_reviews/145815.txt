Awesome!!  Super easy - I doubled the recipe and froze half so I would have some on hand for last minute entertaining.  I brought this to a dinner party and everyone raved about it and I had to email out the recipe later that night.  Sooooo yummy.  Didn't change a thing.

Very good.  I will make again. Got lots of complements.  I made it with and without the artichoke... they're both good.

I was specifically looking for a recipe that called for capers and decided on this tapenade.   I noticed when reading the reviews that quite a few people complained that four garlic cloves were too many.  As I'm not a fan of raw garlic, I sauteed mine (all four of them)  for just a few minutes in a small amount of the olive oil before adding it to the rest of the ingredients in the food processor.  I did use Asiago as that is what I had in the fridge at the time and threw in a small handful of cilantro leaves for a dash of flavor - probably not the full 1/2 cup called for in the recipe.  Great recipe. EDIT:  I've made this many times now and everyone loves it, but have since adjusted the seasoning in one other area.  As the artichoke hearts are already nice and tangy from their marinade, I usually cut the lemon juice way back - to maybe a teaspoon.  That's all - just a personal preference.

I just looked at the ingredients in this tapenade and knew I couldn't go wrong with it: roasted red peppers, artichoke hearts, capers, parmesan--YUM!  I do think I'll use one less clove of garlic next time, but that's only because I'm a moderate garlic lover--I definitely like it but I'm not one of those people who thinks you can never use too much of it.  I also think I'll use basil next time in place of cilantro, just because I like basil WAY more and I think it would go with the flavors better.  But cilantro is a good, cheaper option.    I served this at a dinner party and nobody could get enough of it.  They all commented on it being their favorite thing (and, of course, it was also the easiest).

Fantastic! I used a little more artichoke than called for because I have a humongous jar and was eyeballing it. The cilantro in it is wonderful, but basil and/or parsley would be fine if you hate cilantro.  I doubled the recipe - and I'm glad I did. We had it on toasted onion bread the first night. This would be also be great on pasta or to stuff chops or tenderloin. Excellent, thanks!

Loved it!  It definitely needs to chill at least the 2 hours so that the flavors blend.  I let mine set overnight.  Made it for Christmas and everyone demanded the recipe.  Thanks.

Great find for an appetizer for family or a crowd!!  Followed recipe exactly and were very impressed by the flavorful combination!  DH declared "this is a keeper!"  The flavors are enhanced after sitting for a day; course it might not be around that long for most of you!  Highly recommend it.

Love it! Love it! Love it! I will have to say that I did cut the garlic and capers in half. Still very tasty. I have made this with the cilantro and also have substituted Italian parsley. I do prefer the parsley but it is wonderful either way. I have made it about four times now and have gotten rave reviews and requests from many foodies! Nice colors for the holidays, too! Thank you for this great recipe!

I used unmarinated artichokes, because that was what I had.  I also added a small can of chopped black olives.  Yum!!

This is pretty basic, but fast and good.  I'd actually give it a 3.5.  I didn't have any cilantro, but you could probably use flat leaf parsley as well.

There's a couple difference between this recipe and mine ... 1)  I use twice the amount of artichoke hearts, 2)  mine calls for fresh parsley rather than cilantro, which is fine because I love fresh parsley

It's also fabulous on a grilled burger with smoked gouda, then topped with a spoonful of the tapenade.  Delicious!

We loved it!  Since we're garlic lovers, we didn't feel that the garlic was too strong.

Have made this twice now, both times a raving success!  Is a little heavy on the garlic, but we like that. I doubled the recipe and mixed the leftovers with ground beef to make burger patties,  they were delicious!

Oh my goodness, this is wonderful.  It is a bit garlicky but that is my fault as I added an extra clove but it is tasty on pita bread chips.  Thank for the great recipe.

I followed this recipe to the letter (although I made a double batch), and it turned out wonderfully. I believe I may have turned the roasted peppers into a bit of a mush, but that turned out to work really well in my favor. The cappers bring out a tremendous flavor with each bite.  My one failing is that I did not have a brick of parmesan on hand to grate, so I ended up using some shreaded stuff I bought in a store. The taste was still good (and the smell outstanding), but I think it would have had a better effect if it would have been really finely grated.

This was easy and good, I don't care for cilantro so I substituted basil. I served it on toasted baguette with a slather of chevre. Thanks for the advice to freeze it. I had some left over from the Superbowl spread.

This one's a keeper!  What a great tapenade!  I made this to take to a cookout at our friend's house, and everyone loved it (even the kids)! The only change I made was to use my own peppers (red, yellow & orange) that I had roasted on the grill and had in the freezer (so much better than the jarred kind), and one full can of artichokes (NOT the marinated kind). Other than that, I followed the recipe. Excellent recipe, and one that I'll be making again.

Just made this and it's amazing. I added about 1/2 cup of pitted Kalamata olives and eliminated the olive oil. Didn't even notice. I added about 2 tsps of capers and a squirt of the juice from the bottle. Used 2 tsps of minced garlic.  Everything else was as written, except I didn't feel the necessity for salt and pepper. Great recipe, thanks for posting. Yummy

Made this yesterday for the second time.  This time I doubled the recipe, cut the olive oil in half (otherwise there will be oil in the bottom of your serving dish).  Drain peppers and artichokes very well.Served it with carrots and cucumbers cut on diagonal to make large slices, and pita chips.

This recipe is perfect - made exactly as written & ended up an incredibly delicious tapenade!  The flavours really do develop over time, it was even better the next day :)

This was a nice change from my Three Olive Tapenade. As I did not have jarred roasted red peppers, I roasted a red bell with a drizzle of EVOO and it worked great. I cut the EVOO to 1/4 cup, and did not use salt as the Parmesan is salty enough. I also rinsed the artichokes. Served as an appetizer on rice crackers...delish! Thanks for sharing Ashbeth, I will make this again.

An excellent dip but it has way too much garlic in it.  I used 3 and it was still too much.  I'm thinking maybe 1/2 to 1 clove is all it needs.  I will definitely make it again, just will use much less garlic

Made this for a bruschetta platter on Christmas Eve.  Too garlicky for my taste, but it was a success, and since I can alter the quantity of garlic at will, I will give this recipe a 5 star rating.  The capers add a zingy quality, and after the crostini we used to make the bruschetta were gone, my sons used the rest of this tapenade mix as a chip dip, or to fill their omelets.  It awakens the palate!

I increased the servings in the recipe based upon my wine party and ended up with almost equal amounts of roasted red peppers and artichokes. I mixed everything together minus the fresh cilantro and stored it overnight in the refrigerator. Guests really enjoyed the flavors but several commented that the garlic was too strong. Perhaps it was too strong for a wine party but not an Italian party? One family asked for the recipe so I will make this again but with 1/4 of the garlic. So simple and such a great idea. Thanks for sharing.

Love garlic so the flavor is great but it overpowers everything else. Anyone have ideas on what to pair this with to tone down the flavors but also compliment something else?

Just made this tonight to use as a condiment on my Spicy Italian Sandwich. Definitely a keeper. I am wondering how long I can safely store this in the fridge though. It makes a lot!

I'm not familiar with what tapenade should taste like so I have no point of reference for this recipe.  That said, I loved the flavor of this tapenade and so did my family.  We ate it on round crackers.  I didn't measure the ingredients which would explain why mine was a little too "juicy".  I think I'll try draining the peppers and artichokes a little better too.  I'll definitely be making this again as it is great for a quick and easy appetizer thanks to my food processor.

Great dip/spread/side dish with some modifications:
- used 3x the artichokes, can be marinated or not
- lemon juice to taste (amount in recipe was way too much!!) because artichokes, capers, and peppers are already soaked in citrus juice in jars
- halved the amount of garlic
- halved the amount of olive oil to get a thicker spread
- only a handful of parmesean (what I had on hand)
- basil instead of cilantro (what I had on hand)
Blend lightly to keep chunks.

Delicious!  I served this with chicken and pasta.  Capers are not well-liked at our house; so I substituted some green olives instead.  Lovely as a dip or sauce for your veggies/meat.  Devoured the leftovers on some crackers the next day.

I have made this fabulous tapenade many times, and it is always a hit. Since my sweet hubby is lactose intolerant, rather than Parmesan I sub grated Pecorino Romano from sheep's milk, which he can tolerate.  Quick and easy, and not something likely to be duplicated when you are asked to bring a snack or appetizer to a gathering. Thank you ASHBETH!

This tapenade was delicious. I made it for a holiday party (it's red and green) and everyone loved it. I received numerous compliments. It's easy to make and a crowd pleaser.  I also doubled the recipe and will freeze half for a Christmas eve app.  I served with a thinly sliced, long french baguette, cooked on a cookie sheet at 375 for about 12 min until lightly brown. yum! Next time I'll garnish with more cilantro.

Wow!  This is amazing!  The only thing I left out was the cilantro because I didn't have it.  We served it on an antipasto tray with grilled crusty bread and various meats and cheeses.  I will be making this for all my parties.  I can see this being fantastic on fresh cod or tilapia.

I roasted the peppers myself and didn't have any cilantro on hand and forgot to add the lemon juice but other than that, I followed the recipe as directed.  It rocks!  I can still add the lemon juice and will buy some cilantro tomorrow, but I have to say....it's so good already I'm tempted not too.  I will so I can see if it could possibly get any better.

I made 2 1/2 times the recipe so I could freeze some and use up all the peppers I roasted.  I will definitely make another time.  Thanks for the recipe, it's a KEEPER!

Very tasty but go easy on the garlic and use less cheese. I will use more roasted red pepper next time to boost the color.

Excellent but calls for too many capers.  I only used 1 TBSP and it was just right.  Fresh lemon juice works best.  Sometimes I add what ever fresh herbs I have around in it as well.  Always comes out great.

Excellent flavors here and such an easy appetizer to make ahead. I tasted first and only used 1.5 tsp lemon juice--just enough for our taste preference.  I used 1/4-1/2 tsp basil instead of cilantro (that's what I had on hand). I used all 4 cloves of garlic, but since we also do not care for raw garlic, I sauteed the garlic in a very tiny amount of olive oil. I felt the amount of garlic is perfect and wouldn't reduce it. It's chilling in the fridge now and can't wait to taste it tomorrow after the flavors meld even more. Thank you for the recipe suggestion Emma and to ASHBETH for submitting this  recipe!

I just loved how light and bright this tapenade was while still being packed with flavor.  Served on toasted bread it perfectly balanced a very cheese heavy dinner.  I was careful to pat peppers and artichokes dry first and only used 2T of olive oil so I didn't have any issues with too much liquid.

EASY GOOD. This was very flavorful. I used parsley and no capers. Makes  a good bit and freezes well. Good with 
small pretzels or crackers, and I can see it being good in a wrap.

DELICIOUS! I diced the ingredients by hand rather than using a food processor for a bit more texture. Roasted my own peppers so I threw the three garlic cloves in with them which added a nice flavor. Subbed the parmesan for some herb goat cheese I had on hand. I'll definitely make this again!

If you want to be the most popular person at the party -- take this dip!!!  I do not care for olives, so when I found this recipe, I decided to give it a try.  It went over well at a family event, better at Mom's Club & through the roof at a Ladies' event at church!  Everyone was asking for the recipe!  I served it with veggies and pita chips.  It was terrific with both.  While most love all the garlic, I do tone it down a bit when I serve it at home.  Thanks for sharing, Ashbeth  :)

This was my first attempt at a tapenade. I decided on this one since I had all the ingredients on hand, except for cilantro which I substituted with flat leaf parsley. The flavour was very nice, but the texture was watery. I'd try it again but I will make sure all the ingredients are well-drained. Four and a half stars to be fair.

Absolutely delicious!  I used the whole 12 oz. jar of peppers, no capers and cut olive oil to 1/4 cup. Served with sliced, grilled baguette. Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe.

This is great! I made it according to the recipe except I used jared minced garlic and lemon juice from a bottle. I also used my blender as I don't have a food processor. It has a great complex flavor, I love it! Thanks Ashbeth.
