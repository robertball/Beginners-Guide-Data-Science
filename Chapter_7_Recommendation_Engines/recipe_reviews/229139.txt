So I made this recipe almost as is, I didn't measure the sour cream and salsa but I think I was about right. This was the biggest hit at a Halloween Party that I went to, because I was serving the food I did not get to eat right away and by the time I went to make a plate there was none left. My husband graciously let me take a bite of his. Everyone wanted the recipe and I spent a lot of time copying the recipe for everyone who wanted it. Two days after Halloween I had to make this again for my husband because he claimed he couldn't get enough, the only difference I made for our dish is that I added some jalopeno slices to the sour cream salsa mixture.
