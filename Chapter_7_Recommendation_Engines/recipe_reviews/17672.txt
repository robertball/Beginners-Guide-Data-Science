This was my first attempt making chicken marsala.  After viewing a few different recipes, I incorporated a few tips into this one.  I doubled up on the sauce and added a cup of chicken broth, because I used real marsala wine and using that alone gave it a real strong liquor taste.  I also used a combination of fresh mushrooms and baby portabella mushrooms.  Instead of cornstarch, I used Wondra flour for sauces that you can just sprinkle in to thicken it.  I also pounded the chicken to make it real thin.  We have an Italian restaurant near us that we always go to to get this dish and my daughter raved that mine was even better.  I served it with penne pasta with marinara sauce.  Thanks for this excellent recipe, I know I will be making it alot.

This was good, but after this time I will double or even triple the sauce and mushrooms as someone had suggested because there wasn't enough for the chicken.  Great recipe and easy.

I dipped my chicken into egg and then seasoned flour. I browned the chicken very well and placed it in a large casserole dish as I had twelve breasts. I made my sauce separately, which by the way was tripled . I also needed to add additional marsala. I covered the casserole and placed it in the oven for about forty five minutes. Great birthday dinner for my daughter which everyone loved. Thanks a bunch!

This was great! I did make a few changes though. I didn't flour the chicken, I just browned it in butter. And I don't like to cook with wine so I just used chicken stock instead. It turned out excellent! Will definitly add this to my tried and true recipes and make often.

I THOUGHT THIS RECIPE WAS DELICIOUS!! SO DID MY HUSBAND. THE KIDS DID NOT EAT THE MUSHROOMS... BUT LOVED THE CHICKEN. I REALLY DONT KNOW WHAT THE PURPOSE OF THE BACON WAS... THERE WERE NO INSTRUCTIONS EXCEPT TO COOK THE BACON. I ASSUME ITS FOR THE FLAVOR. I ALSO WANT TO ADD THAT AFTER I CREATED THE SAUCE IN THE PAN, I PUT THE CHICKEN IN ALONG WITH THE SAUCE AND MUSHROOMS. IT THICKENED IT UP ALITTLE.

Way to go Courtney! This was great! I used cooking Marsala wine and doubled the sauce and mushrooms and served it for company on top of Mashed potatoes.  BIG BIG HIT!!

You'll be much happier with the flavor of this dish if you use sweet marsala rather than dry.  This recipe is equally good with veal instead of chicken!  I make extra sauce and serve with wide egg noodles.

WOW! Very yummy!  I didn't have any bacon or marsala wine...used sliced ham and merlot instead...it came out great.  My friend's husband is a very picky eater and he loved it.  Next time I'm going to double the sauce recipe, it would have been nice to have more.  Thanks for the recipe!

So, so -- the taste was ok, but I didn't like the flour on the chicken breasts.  Made a soggy coating when the sauce was added.  Next time I'll just brown them without dredging the chicken in  flour.  The flavor was good though, so I'll try this again but tweak it a bit.

I made this recipe exactly as written.  I used a sweet Marsala wine instead of a dry one, at the recommendation of the wine clerk at the store.  He stated that he makes Chicken Marsala all the time and a friend of his is a chef and uses the sweet variety.  My instinct was to go for the dry version but he insisted that it would turn out GREAT with the sweet and he was right!  It turned out FABULOUS!  My only complaint was that the sauce was too thick after adding the cornstarch at the end to the sauce.  The next time I make it I will omit the cornstarch and increase the amount of cream instead.  The flour used to coat the chicken should thicken the sauce adequately.  I served this over cooked pasta noodles and there were no leftovers what-so-ever.  A new family favorite!

I used thinnest chicken pieces from Whole Foods.  Didn't use bacon.  Next time:  try ham bits fried as the Lynnfield Deli.

i use chicken broth along with the marsala wine, and let the flour coating from the browned chicken help thicken the sauce. i'm wary of ever using cornstarch because you can taste it. but otherwise, great recipe! we serve ours with wide egg noodles tossed with butter and fresh italian flat leaf parsley and sauteed fresh spinach on the side.

MAKE AHEAD AND FREEZE:  I made a LARGE batch of this for a buffet dinner party and it was delicious!  I knew the day of the party I'd have no time, so I made it a week in advance and froze it.. here's how:
I cut the boneless chicken breasts into smaller pieces (easier serving for a buffet) and only cooked them partially (about 3/4 of the way done, but sauteed in the bacon/butter to have a nice browning color to them)   The bacon adds great flavor to this dish.. could also use finely chopped porchetta) remove from pan and cool chicken... once it's cooled you can put into zip lock bags and freeze.  Continue making the sauce, adding the mushrooms.  I personally like to saute the mushrooms a little more so they get a little brown on the sides.  I also made extra sauce!  Cool and freeze the sauce separately.  (I used flour instead of cornstarch).  MORNING OF PARTY:  remove from freezer to thaw - ideally completely (you may need to microwave sauce partially, you just don't want to put hot sauce on partially frozen chicken into the oven - it won't cook evenly) . Place chicken and sauce in a large baking dish, cover with foil and pop in oven at 350 for an hour or so. (I eventually moved it to a sterno for the buffet - you could also warm it up (and complete cooking) in a crock pot..., you just want to heat it and finish the cooking of the chicken.  finish with chopped parsley... (I serve this with pasta and a red sauce on side).

I was very pleased with the ease in which this delicious dish was prepared.  I did, however double the amount of ingredients - except for the chicken - the second time I made it.  We loved the rich sauce but found that it did not make much for the amount of chicken used in the recipe.  Doubled it was perfect.  I will make this again and again!  Also, I used a sweet Marsala wine and it was even more delicious with a very unique flavor that my family preferred over the dry!

I've made several versions of Chicken Marsala over the years.  My favorite is Romano's Mac Grill.  This recipe is delicious, however, I prefer it without the bacon.  I always serve Chicken Marsala over Angel Hair or Bow Tie pasta.   Thanks for sharing.

This is either amazing or horrible.  The key to this recipe is to let the marsala sauce simmer for a full 30 minutes, I took the chicken out after the juices ran clear and put it back in after the sauce had simmered for long enough.  Don't be afraid to test the sauce throughout cooking it.  Also, add flour and water to the sauce to thicken it up, it makes it stick so much better to the chicken.

I had high expectations for this and was pretty let down.  I only had sweet Marsala but several reviewers said it would be better with sweet.  I will try it again with the dry to see how well I like it then.  
Also, I don't see a reason to cook the mushrooms in butter and then add bacon which would only render more fat.  I cooked the chopped bacon in the pan first, removed the cooked pieces and used the drippings to saute the mushrooms.  I doubled the Marsala and still there was very little sauce once it deglazed the pan and reduced down a bit.  Although dredging the chicken in flour worked well, I don't think I would miss anything by just using seasoned chicken breasts and that would save on fat calories.  Of course that is just my health-conscious twist. 
Over all I found the sauce bland and there was definitely too little sauce for six servings.  I'm not giving up on this, just need to tweak it to get the flavor I expect.

This was very good but it could be easier & better by combining several steps. Also, the recipe mentions using bacon, but doesn't include what to do with it. I used sweet Sherry (I didn't have Marsala wine on hand) and it added a warm and rich taste.  See my revised recipe @ "Chicken Marsala  III for clarification and tell me how you like it.

This was my first attempt at chicken marsala.  I followed this recipe exactly except doubling the mushrooms and sauce.  I also love garlic and sautéed my mushrooms with about two tablespoons of minced garlic.  All I have to say is this is better than restaurant quality.  Delicious!

I was nervous about making this recipe because, as a novice 'chef', I had never done a reduction before.  This recipe was so easy, that even I could pull it off.  My wife said this was on par with what restaurants serve, and we both loved it.  Definitely a keeper!

Im going to have to give this one 4 stars instead of five simply because I felt that it had to modified quite a bit to be a good recipe. This is what I did: I added a whole small yellow onion to the mushrooms as well as 2 cloves of garlic chopped finely, I added 1 cup of half and half as well as extra cornstarch into the sauce as well as a whole cup of chicken broth because the sauce was way to strong, This was simply my aquired taste... maybe you'll  like it as is. If not you can try it this way. Another thing I didn't quite understand the whole bacon part of the recipe but it did give the chicken a nice flavor. I will definetly make this one again!!!!

The recipe calls for way to much marsala. My entire family did not care for it  :(

I used a frozen skinless, boneless chicken breast (8 oz), substitued ghee for butter, and only used one 6-oz package of sliced mushrooms.  I also used a non-stick pan and slightly less butter.  I served it with white rice and my husband and I loved it (Marsala wine is an incredible flavor)!

For folks who aren't experienced with coatings, no matter how light: you must do the dredging and let the coated meat sit for the coating to set up. If you try to go straight from dredge to pan it will simply fall apart and get gummy.  The first thing I do with any recipe that calls for the meat to be coated is do that and let it sit and rest. I also recommend making this recipe with chicken scallopini, the already thin sliced chicken breast. i doubled the sauce and will triple it next time.

Delicious!!! Added a little chicken broth with the marsala, as my family likes a milder wine flavor and used prosciutto instead of bacon. It's now my families favorite!

This dish tastes like a greatly improved version of Macaroni Grill's chicken marsala, which is a favorite.  I made a few subtle changes:  I doubled the sauce; used chianti, because that's what I had on hand; threw in a chicken bouillon cube with the sauce; added the bacon back into the sauce at the end (I wasn't sure what to do with it); added a minced garlic clove to the sauce.  The whole family loved it - fantastic!!  I should also mention that it makes a beautiful presentation with mashed potatoes and steamed garlic.

It was good, but as others stated...not enough sauce.  I doubled the recipe, but will triple it next time.  I didn't taste the bacon so I may try prosciutto next time.  I added onions, garlic, and cream to the sauce.  The chicken was TENDER!  Good stuff.

This was a great dish! I sauteed some fresh garlic with my chicken. I also used crimini mushrooms and proscuitto instead of the bacon. The only marsala I had on hand was sweet, I added about 1/3 cup of chicken stock and a splash of heavy cream to that and it turned out fantastic! Thanks for the awesome recipe, I will definitely be making this again!

I just wanted to add a new review- I make this so much.  Tastes good with garlic smashed potatoes!  But- I prepared the chicken the same way but grilled it on the BBQ- so tastey.  Just a good summery idea!  Enjoy

My family loved this dish. I will definately make this again.  My husband very rarely raves about food and he had thirds.  The chicken was very tender.  I only used a pound of chicken and little over 1/4 of a cup of Marsala wine and it was great. Very easy to make. Thanks for the recipe.

I had a similar dish at an upscale restaurant and hoped to recreate it. This is it!  I did make extra sauce, using chicken broth instead of water. Just before serving, I added a splash or two of cream, which made a huge difference by taking the "edge" off of the Marsala. I did need to cook the chicken much longer, since the pieces were quite thick, but the extra time crisped the coating nicely. I served this with linguine. By serving everything separately, everyone could decide how much sauce they wanted, and the chicken didn't sit in the sauce, which kept it nicely crisp. I will make this over and over! Thanks for the great recipe!

This was good.  I used a teaspoon or so of fresh minced garlic instead of garlic powder.  People who don't like garlic may want less.

Delicious Marsala recipe! I doubled my sauce as suggested and used prosciutto in place of bacon. The sauce did not thicken as nicely as I wanted so I added more cornstarch and water, got too thick. No worries, still yummy

Really easy and very delicious. I didn;t have any marsala wine though so I just used chardonnay and added a packet of stevia to sweeten it up a little.

I have made this recipe several times. I am giving it 5 stars even though I changed it for what I believe is better. I omitted the bacon (love bacon,  but don't think it is needed) and I doubled the amount of wine to make more sauce. Easy and very good!

This was very easy to make and yet so flavorful! On occasions when I don't have marsala wine, i would substitute white wine and it tastes just as good. I also sometimes use garlic salt instead of garlic powder AND salt. Will be making this again. Thanks for sharing!

This was delicious with some alterations.  I made 4 times the sauce.  Use a little less sweet Marsala wine and about double the chicken broth (instead of water) for a milder flavor.  I used minced garlic instead of garlic powder.  Served with smashed potatoes and broccoli.  Dredged thinly sliced chicken breast (thirds) in flour, salt, pepper, and paprika.  Fried in olive oil.  Sautéed chopped onions, celery, and mushrooms separately, then spooned on top of chicken in a 9x13 pan and baked in 400 degree oven till done.  Boiled sauce separately on stovetop, also using the liquid created when sautéing the mushrooms.  Spoon on top the chicken right before serving.

Oh, wow! This was delicious. I did not have any Marsala wine so I used Sherry. Other than that, followed the recipe exactly and it was a hit with the family.

EXCELLENT took longer than I thought-definitely need triple sauce - did use onions and pepper with mushrooms - try garlic also next time - used 1/4 C. chardonnay with 1 tsp brandy instead of marsala - also used a little brown sugar and 1 cup of boullion.  taste to see how it goes.

This was so good. I didn't have any Marsala on hand so I used Harveys Bristol Cream instead. It was delicious and I had no leftovers. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.

Absolutely delicious. I made this exactly as recipe shown and it was gourmet worthy.  I served it with boiled carrots and wild rice with toasted pine nuts.  Probably the best recipe I have used off this site (and I have over 1000 in my files).  Thanks so much CMITCHEL97 for sharing this winner.

I love Chicken Marsala and this is an easy recipe but tastes like you have spent hours in the kitchen.  I spend hours searching for fast & easy. My friend does not like anything that is white so I added a little Kitchen Bouquet. (He is easily fooled) I only had Chardonnay in the house & for us it was great.  Thanks for another great recipe!

Oh YUM! We made this last night! Followed the advice of one of the other reviewers to double the sauce, but made no other changes to the recipe. My husband said this was the best Marsala he has ever had!! I have to agree! What's more - it is EASY.

Have made this dish before from another recipe but this one was the best.  Although it doesn't tell you what to do with the bacon after you par cook it, I just left it in the skillet while I cooked the chicken to add to the flavour and then threw it out prior to making the sause.  Husband loved it.

WAY TOO MUCH MARSALA!  Oh my goodness, my family couldn't even get through 3 bites of this.  And we love chicken marsala!  I would would definitely cut the marsala down.  Everything else was fine, but I honestly couldn't even taste the chicken or mushrooms (or the pasta) with the in-your-face marsala.

Very tasty. I also put mozzarella cheese on top of chicken at the end on the plate. Definetely not enough sauce for 12 pcs of breast. I've done only 2 pcs for my husband and tha sauce was just enough maybe for 2 more pcs but that's it. Other than that the recipe is very good.

This turned out really good...I was a little tired of chicken so I used turkey cutlets.  I added chopped onions to the mushrooms, and I didn't have any constarch so I just added a little flour to thicken the sauce.  I would definitely make my modified version again...

I found this recipe helpful. I marinated the chicken for a few hours in olive oil. This made the chicken very tender without having to pound it. I also added brown sugar to the sauce. It added a touch of sweetness that the sauce needed. Thanks for the recipe!!

Because of my personal taste, I omitted the bacon. I substituted water with 1 cup chicken broth, and also increased the marsala wine to 3/4 cup or more! I used chicken tenders in place of chicken breasts. Very tender. I receive applause from my husband with this recipe.

This was good, but I was hoping it would  be GREAT.  I should have read the other reviews and perhaps double or even triple the amount of sauce.  There just wasn't enough sauce for me.  I served over capellini & a side of brocolli.

I marinated frozen breasts in the marsala wine overnight.  I took the bacon out of the frying pan before adding the liquid to make the sauce but
served it mixed into the mushrooms and I
too made more sauce and next time I will
make even MORE sauce!  Excellent recipe!

This is absolutely my favorite chicken recipe! I use the mushroom and sauce measurements for 6 servings for 2 servings (we love mushrooms and the sauce is scare otherwise). I also add about 1/2 tsp more corn starch, for a total of 2 tsp, to get the desired thickness. Do not over salt the chicken or use chicken broth as one reviewer suggested:  because when I used broth, it was terribly salty and..i hated it. 
I fully cook my bacon, because it won't finish cooking while it's hanging out with the mushrooms. And finally, I seriously pound out the chicken breast: till it's an even thickness, maybe a 1/2 inch thick.  The chicken's so tender when tenderized, floured and lightly fried!  Perfect every time! It's great with egg noodles and your favorite veggie.

We loved this recipe and it was really quite simple to make.  I really wasn't sure how I would like the bacon in it but it did add a nice bit of flavor.   I only had the "sweet" marsala which I thought was just fine in it.  Not sure what the different would be.  Since I love mushrooms, I put in extra.  I will definitely make this dish again but will pound the chicken breasts much thinner and make a little more sauce.

I made more  sauce and added more mushrooms then the recipe calls for but it came out pretty good. I didn't change the recipe in any other way. I may try to make the chicken a little crispy next time just to add some texture or perhaps make sauteed green beans with sliced almonds for a crunch. Ill make this again for sure.

I love this!  Of course, I did make some changes.  Sautéed 3 sliced of bacon cut into pieces until half cooked.  Removed bits and reserved grease, adding olive oil and butter to make 1/4 cup.  Pounded skinless boneless breasts till of even thickness..  Shook breasts in plastic bag with flour and spices and browned in grease mix, turning and adding grease as needed.  Remove breasts to oven to complete cooking (250 degrees for 15 minutes).  Meanwhile, pour remaining grease into same skillet with chicken fond.  Add butter if needed. Sauté bacon bits, two chopped shallots, and 8 ounces mushrooms in the grease / butter.  Deglaze with wine.  Cook to reduce.  Use chicken broth in place of water with corn starch.  Cook till thick, adding broth if necessary.  Spoon over breasts on a bed of mashed potatoes.  Yum!

This has been my go-to chicken marsala recipe for years. I never add bacon and double up on the shrooms.

I followed the recipe that was featured in the October 2016 edition. It was incredible! The mushroom sauce tasted great with the homemade mashed potatoes I served with it. My husband said he felt like he was eating in a gourmet restaurant. I will definitely be making this again!

I used olive oil instead of butter, no bacon or bacon fat. After dredging the 4 large chicken breasts[half-chicken breasts?] I let them sit for 5 or so minutes.I also had patted them dry with paper towels before dredging in flour. No soggy coating. the chicken was perfectly cooked at 6 minutes per side on medium heat. The only change I will make is to double the sauce, that stuff is GOOD! Oh yes I also added frozen peas to sauce. This is a Great recipe.  BJ Geraghty

I really liked the breading on the chicken, and mine didn't turn soggy like a previous reviewer's did.  Nothing blew me away, but it was still tasty.

I've tried a lot of Chicken Marsala recipes and this is by far the best.

I didn't have bacon, so I used prosciutto instead and it gave the sauce a great taste. 

Like other reviews, I think the next time, I will double or triple the sauce.

At the end, I put the entire dish in the oven to thicken the sauce a bit.

This is fantastic! I did leave the bacon out. I know, I know why would you leave THAT out?! We don't eat very much pork & its difficult to find bacon without preservatives/nitrates where we live soooo I left it out & it was still super tasty. Delicious!

I doubled the chicken.  I used a dry marsala (about a cup)and added about 3 cups bouillon, extra bacon and no mushrooms.   I know, I know, it's supposed to have mushrooms.  We don't do mushrooms.  Everything else in the sauce stayed the same.  We served it over baby red potatoes w/ sliced peppers, onions, rosemary and some of the bacon.

Having never had the dish in a restaurant, I don't know how it's 'supposed' to taste; this is a good but not outstanding dish which would benefit from some sharper combination of spices (or something).

It was soooo good. Thanks so much. Did add some of the bacon and added some chicken stock to dilute taste of alcohol. Amazing and the kids and hubby loved it!!! I will say I was triple the sauce recipe though.

Great recipe, but I must admit I tweaked it a bit...I used chicken tenderloins and they worked out just fine! I did cheat w/the gravy by using the recipe but extending by using more Marsala and a gravy packet(I wanted more sauce)....It was quick and easy to make and I had dinner on the table PDQ!!! The downside was that there was a fight over the leftovers! : )

Outstanding.  I used my filet knife and sliced the chicken very thin.  I suggest a light shake after the flour dredge to avoid problems some other reviewers mention.  A little more pepper and sliced scallions on top for us.  Fantastic.

I made this for 2 people to serve on penne pasta so I used 12 oz chx breast & the same portions on everything else (which essentially is doubling the sauce). The marsale wine taste was terribly strong but added 1/2 cup chicken stock & that righted the taste. I also sauteed 1/2 cup celery & 1/2 cup onion with the mushrooms. I also added 1 chicken bullion with the dredge & omitted salt. Sorry to change & rate but I taste along the way & it was headed down the bland road. It was tasty at these portions with 5 ounces pasta & next time I will toss some cooked broccoli in at the very end. Even doubled, the sauced covered the pasta & not much extra so change up according to taste. As is, it lacked color.

This recipe is great. We loved it. I did add a cup more mushrooms and I might add more Marsala wine if more than 2 people want sauce. My children did not want the sauce so this was only enough for my husband and I but other than that great recipe. I made it with mashed potatoes and put the sauce all over the potatoes to. Mmmmmmm.......... yummy.

This has the most excellent flavor!  I would recommend this plate to anyone who loves chicken.  The next time that I prepare it, I will increase the sauce so that if you would like to serve it with rice or noodles you will have some extra.  There is just enough sauce for the chicken.

My family loves this dish. I always rely on this particular recipe because of the addition of the bacon. I tend to be a little heavier handed with the mushrooms, and garlic, frequently use basil instead of oregano, and I use a dry marasala instead of the sweeter version, but it's a great recipe.

I used a Merlot, and didn't add mushrooms or bacon. I was worried that my children would not like the flavor. But they gobbled it up and had seconds. I would agree that the flour on the chicken and the sauce did end up being a bit mushy but the taste was good. We had with rice and broccoli. And the kids liked it so, great!

Excellent. Doubled the sauce as others recommended. Added shallots to the mushrooms. Used Taylor marsala wine. Better than most restaurants.

This was a very easy basic recipe. I didn't  have the marsala wine so I used a dry white wine mixed with a touch of brandy (about 2 tablespoons with 1 1/3 cup wine). I doubled the sauce and mushrooms and cooked the chicken in half bacon grease and half butter. I also added some chopped green onions to the mushrooms and fresh garlic . We served it over fettuccine noodles with a bit of butter and garlic. Outstanding!

I added chopped garlic and burgundy wine when i sautéed the mushrooms.  Also, two more peices of bacon to get more grease.   Otherwise followed the recipe as written and it was a big hit with my family.  The meat came out the perfect consistency and yes i will cook many times again.
