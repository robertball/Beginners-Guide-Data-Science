This is such an easy recipe! An easier way to measure the ingredients is, a bag of coconut, a can of sweetened condensed milk, and a dash of vanilla

So Easy! Delicious Too!
I should've read the servings because the recipe posted only makes 12 cookies - like they lasted that long in my house!
I ended up using 1 can of condensed milk, 1 bag of coconut(about 5 1/3 cups) and 2 tsp of vanilla. Baked on parchment paper and made 2 inch in length cookies. Had to also add an additional 3 minutes to baking time in all baking for about 15-16 minutes.

Just three ingredients and one bowl!!! These macaroons were super easy. I just made the first batch and they were awesome. The cookies are soft and chewy...not to mention, a bit addictive.Super yummy.

This is a really simple recipe.  I gave it 5 stars because it's easy, only 3 ingredients, and takes about 10 minutes for the first batch to be done (of course then it has to cool or you burn your tongue).  I do however recommend that you place waxed or parchment paper on your cooling racks so they don't fall through.

My friends and family love this recipe, but there are a few tricks. You MUST cook the macaroon on parchment; otherwise, you can't get them off the pan. When cool, I spread melted semisweet chocolate chips on the bottom of the cookies, put them back in the frig on parchment for 15 minutes, and you've got a great macaroon that everyone will want the recipe for! **Another easier way is to fold in ghirardelli 60 %cacao chips into the coconut mix (about 1 cup for a double recipe). They taste amazing and your hands don't get chocolaty when the bottom begins to melt.

I can only give this recipe 2 stars, because although it tasted yummy, it was incredibly hard to remove from the baking sheets. I followed the directions exactly, and ended up with macaroons that were all fallen apart because I tried to take them off the sheets immediately as it says and it was extremely difficult to take them off without them breaking completely apart. I even tried to let them cool just a little bit on the sheets, which was a big mistake because now I have macaroons stuck like super glue to my sheets. I tried baking for a little bit longer and ended up with the same problem, but only with burnt bottoms. Oh well.

Looking for an easy sweet macaroon, but wanted bars, so I used a 9x13 pan lined with parchment, sprayed with butter Pam and left a little edge on the parchment to pull it out.  Baked for 25 minutes, cooled for about 5 and pulled it out to cool on a rack.  Drizzled with some melted dark chocolate, and refrigerated for a while.  Yum.

I tried this recipe and it worked out horribly, but the second time around my boyfriend made them and they were fabulous! I must have added too much milk.

These were incredibly easy to make and absolutely delicious.  Everyone loved them and asked for the recipe.  I will be making these at Passover for sure.  I would love to make them with chocolate but am not sure how much melted chocolate to put into the recipe.

All I can say is so easy and so fabulous!! I use the 1 bag of coconut,1 can of sweetened condensed milk and 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp almond extract method. Parchment paper a must and the dark chocolate on he bottom is the best.

I added 1/3 cup of flour and followed the rest of the recipe exactly and they were delicious. I baked on silpat cookie sheets, so they were easy to remove. After they cooled, I dipped the tops in melted semi sweet chocolate. The whole family loved them.

Did exactly as the recipe suggested but they would not stay together. I added some flour and egg and they worked just fine. People said thay had a good flavor but I just couldn't get it to work without adding things. Sorry

As Geechboys' wife, I am spoiled and inept at cooking. I have a short attention span and this recipe is so easy, so good and looks and tastes like you went to a lot more trouble than you did!
