3.21.20  I used real maple syrup, but its flavor just didn't come through.  The recipe submitter said you can use vanilla extract instead of lemon, and I certainly would do that if I made this again.  I use pure vanilla extract, but the McCormick® lemon extract is artificial, and I think that may have overpowered the maple flavor, but not sure.  This was OK, but I doubt I’ll make it again.
