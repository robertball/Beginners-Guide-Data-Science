A delicious roll that is sticky only before it bakes. To deal with the dough, I rolled it around in some flour (just a tablespoon full). Then I manipulated it with a floured spatula as I went along, rolling it up. When it separated or thinned, I patched it up with my floured fingers.

Next, I used dental floss to cut the jelly roll. It cut easily and I scooped up the slices with the floured spatula. Instead of using a muffin tin, I created about 7 rolls that I laid flat on a buttered cookie sheet. I cooked them at 345 for 24 mintues. 

Next I combined powdered sugar, a bit of orange juice and a tad of corn starch for the icing. The corn starch keeps the icing from being too sticky and it hardens on the rolls like you see in the stores.

All and all, a high-maintenance, good recipe that skips the yeast! Yeah! Yummy stuff.

It took me a lot longer than 30 minutes to prepare this recipe.  I found that all the slices of dough wouldn't fit into two pans and I had to prepare a third one.  I thought the baking time was a bit too long too because the topping got hard instead of sticky.  Nevertheless, the buns were very good.

These turned out great!!  My husband went wild over them!  They were even good reheated in the microwave!  I had to look else where for the frosting recipe, but as far as the buns went, they were great!  Definately 5 stars!!

These buns have changed my life! My brother has always loved cinnamon buns. SO, I made these to bring to a visit to his home. He smelled them before he found them.. the smell alone made him smile at me with that "I love you sister" smile. He loved them. The entire family loved them. I am now crowned the "queen of sticky buns" in this crazy family of mine!

The recipe turned out pretty dry for me. My husband and son loved these but I found them not moist enough for what should be 'sticky'.

This is a fantastic and delicious cinnamon roll!  I didn't find the dough hard to work with at all - it just needs a little extra flour as you lightly knead it.

I put mine in cupcake wrappers to ease the cleaning afterward.  I will definitely make again!

Wonderful for a yeast-free roll -- more like a biscuit, but that's to be expected.

I made these initially as a Christmas gift for my boss and told her I'd never make them again - I'm not one for rolling dough.  But they were far too good, so a couple days later I made another batch.  I would call them more like cinnamon rolls than sticky buns, which doesn't matter to me because they are so good.  The only problems I had with the first batch was I didn't use a muffin tin, but a 9x9 pan and the buns fell apart too easily.  The first batch also seemed to be a little under done at the 25 minute time, so I extended it two minutes for the second batch.  They came out perfect!  I used a muffin tin the second time and they were perfectly shaped, plus it seemed less messy to clean up.  The key thing for this recipe is flour - when kneading add flour, and be sure you have flour on your rolling surface, hands, and rolling pin.  I have never altered the amount of milk added like some other reviewers, I just add enough flour to make the dough more dough-like and less sticky.  These disappear quickly in my house, even with people who traditional "claim" they don't like sticky buns/cinnamon rolls.  I also definitely recommend eating them right after they cool down from baking since they seem to taste the best right then.  I made them once with pecans and a vanilla icing - extremely good and more like a sticky bun.  If I didn't hate all the flour mess I get when making these, I would have some in the house everyday.

The kids and I made these for their music teacher and ended up eating many before they got there.  We are a wheat free family and so I substituted the wheat flour with the same amount of light spelt.  I also put in a dash more baking powder and a little less milk.  The results were amazing!  A bit messy but definitely worth it.  20 minutes was the perfect cooking time - soft and gooey.  Add a bit of icing on top and you have the perfect Christmas morning treat!

Great!! I adore this recipe and will use it again. The only thing I think I'll do different is brush the dough with the butter and sprinkle on the sugar and cinnamon...it just seems easier!

These were quick and easy (maybe 40 minutes total from start to snacktime!), and the taste was fine. They weren't really sticky, even though I added a little corn syrup, but they did taste nice. Some of the topping stuck inside the muffin cups, but not all of it. The dough is really easy to work with if you add your milk slowly. Don't just dump it all in, mix, and find it's way too wet. Add 1/2 or 3/4 of the amount called for, mix it, and if you need more, add more. I made a half-batch (only 6, to test the recipe!) and I only used maybe 1/3 cup of milk. If you do find your dough is too wet to work with, mix in some more flour! Or all you'll have is a gloppy mess that you can't work with. Make sure your board is floured and you flip your dough around so both sides are lightly floured. Thanks for the recipe, I will use it again. :)

I'm eating one of these as I type, mmmmm - yummm.  My 3 kiddies are licking there fingers contentedly!  These are my new go-to cinnamon buns, you can make them the same morning you want to serve them, I find the traditional yeast ones far too long to make for a fresh morning feast.   To make these 5 star I did have to alter slightly :)  :  As many others have said the dough is far too sticky to knead, so I stirred in about 3/4 cup more flour to the bowl until it came together, then I kneaded in another 1/4 - 1/2 cup of flour.  (I should note that I had doubled the recipe).  This made a beautiful fluffy dough that was manageable on a floured surface.  When the dough was rolled out I spread the butter over the dough then sprinkled an abundant amount of brown sugar/ cinnamon mixture over the top and rolled up.  I took another users advice and used dental floss to slice - love this idea!!  I then put them snugly on a cookie sheet sidexside.  My doubled recipe made 13 cinnamon buns.  They baked for around 30 minutes and are deee lish!  I put a cream cheese/icing sugar/milk glaze over the top.    They are more "biscuity" then traditional yeast buns, but this is not a complaint.  Terrific!  Thank-you :)

ok i dont usually give 5 stars but this one deserved it. i wasnt going to make it because i had read so many bad reviews and the people who left good reviews didnt explain why it was good or why it worked out for them. the dough is sticky and can be dificult to work with if you are clumbsy or , but i am neither of these so i floured the bottom of a cookie sheet and rather than rolling the dough i used my floured hands to spread it till it was about an inch thick. also rather than knead the dough i just used the same spoon i had used to mix the ingredients to sort of knead it without using my hands. also i used a floured spatula to scrape the dough off of the cookie sheet when i was rolling it and i floured my knife frequently when slicing the rolls. this recipe took me 20 min to prepare and 20 min to cook plus 10 min to cool. it was delish! and i wont make regular cinnomon rolls ever again because these are easier and waay faster and tase just as good. i didnt even add icing to these. if you just realize this is a very sticky dough and handle accordingly, you will be fine. id give 10 stars if i could.

These were pretty awesome. The dough really wasn't that hard to work with for me (sticky at first, but after I added more flour it was fine). A lot of the brown sugar filling stuck to the pan (it washed off fairly easily, though), but it turned out absolutely delicious anyway.

The first time I made these, I don't think I  used whole wheat; they were definatly better. I like how there is no yeast needed!! It's too bad they ooze out so much!! They taste fantastic. I asked my brother what to rate them and he said, "Five if you make them again". The dough was sticky but not too bad. Thanks a bunch!!

These are really, really good! I halved the recipe to give it a trial run, and I wish I made more! They have a sweet, biscuity taste to them but are excellent. Instead of layering it on the bottom, I spooned the remaining sugar mixture on and around the little dough spirals. That may or may not have been a good idea, because they taste awesome but some of the brown sugar bubbled over! Still delicious and I drizzled a sugar-vanilla glaze over them while they were still warm.

Very easy for the time reqd.  I made them in the muffin tins the first time, but they were really messy to clean so I tried them on cookie sheets.  Problem with that is they come apart :S  They did spread out more like normal cinnamon buns but they didn't look great.

Thanks for the recipe, i've never made these before and it was a great one to start with!

Dough was on the sticky/wet side so I just kept adding flour until it looked like dough you could roll out on the counter. Buns turned out ok. The bun fell apart really easily and the topping was dry and crumbly, not sticky in the least. I would use more butter next time in the filling to help the brown sugar melt better. Tasted good. But still a little disapointed with the end results. I will be looking for another recipe . maybe adding an egg to the bread would help things.

Tried this recipe with good success. It's especially good for fast satisfaction. The texture is more like pastry than bread (not surprised there, though I tend to like the bread form better). I subsituted sliced almonds for raisins, and baked it in a 9x9 cake pan for lack of muffin tins. I made extra filling and did a thin layer on the bottom of the pan, and another thin layer on top of them, and they turned out nice and sticky. They were best hot, with thick vanilla icing.

I would give this recipe a 5 on taste, but I can't rate it at that because the dough was so hard to work with!  It stuck to everything!  I read everyone's reviews, so I knew that the dough would be extremely sticky - it was the worst dough I have ever delt with.  I used "release" reynold's wrap for a kneading surface and lots of flour, and it still stuck!  And cutting the dough is next to impossible.  I just ripped it into sections.  Best of luck!

Fantabulous!!  Now making cinnamon buns isn't a huge issue.  Tried this recipe last minute for breakfast breakfast for my daughter's sleepover --all four eight-year-old girls loved them!! ...and the 5 year old brother, not to mention my husband and myself!!  This will also be our new Christmas and Easter morning treats!

Absolutely melt in your mouth buns. This was the first time I ever made sticky buns and my fiance and I just LOVED them! One thing though...even though I followed the recipe, it only yielded 6 buns rather than 12...Maybe I just made the dough too think. In any event, they were REALLY good!!!

I attempted this recipe and the dough came out more like batter because the measurements are off from dry to wet ratio. The second attempt faired better. I added all the written ingredients and added only 1/2 cup of milk. The dough wasn't too sticky and was able to be rolled out by my pin after lightly dusting my counter top. I made the interior glaze and was very curious about putting brown sugar in the center rather than white sugar in usual recipes. So, in the oven they went, at the alloted baking time and temp. Twenty five minutes later the buns were done. They look right and smelled great. Well, taste testing time. The texture the the dough was good, a little dry like another review stated and the dough had no flavor and was a little doughy tasting. And they weren't sticky. So, there is going to be a third attempt. And I plan to add vanilla flavoring, orange peel grated shavings and more butter to the dough mixture with the same ingredients with the altered milk measurement and the center sugar glaze will consist of white sugar (instead of brown sugar),butter and cinnamon. These buns need icing! I've tried other icing recipes and confectioners sugar and milk taste too much like perfume essence. So for these buns I recommend a cream cheese icing.

I followed the recipe and the dough would not roll at all, even when I added slightly more flour. I had to add 2 more cups of flour to make it roll. This recipe, that looks relatively easy, is hard to get right without tweaking it.

I used 3/4 cup of milk and the dough was easy to work with/not sticky at all. I doubled the recipe and subbed pecans for the raisins and oh my GOSH. Delicious! It made eight HUGE rolls that my children and I gobbled up in about 20 seconds flat. I used a pow sugar/vanilla/milk glaze but it really would have been perfection with cream cheese frosting.

Awful recipe. Sticky dough that did not come together well despite adding more and more flour.  Big waste of time and a huge mess. Would not make again. Making yeast buns is worth the trouble and time.

These turned out better then expected. I did come across the same sticky dough problem but I used a ton of flour to kneed and roll and was able to prepare no problems. I made a icing with powdered sugar, vanilla, cream cheese, margarine and a dab of water. The kids loved them and enjoyed helping on a rainy day. Thanks for the great simple recipe!!!!

Quick, easy, and delicious!!  After reading that some others had problems with the dough, I added slightly less milk and refrigerated the dough for a few minutes before rolling.  It still stuck a little, but not too bad.  I made a glaze with 2 1/2 tbs confectioners sugar, 1 tbs milk and 1/8 tsp of orange extract and drizzled it over the bottoms of the rolls before inverting them.  The only thing I had problems with was they stuck to the tin; I'll wait only 5 minutes before removing next time.  Fantastic recipe!

these were o.k., They didn't really look like sticky buns though. It was quick and easy to make but as others said, the dough was very hard to work with. It was too moist. I might try again and put a little more flour in it to firm it up. Slicing it was also very hard due to it being moist. The kids liked it though!!

We love these!  They are super easy and start with an old-fashioned biscuit recipe.  Be sure to use cold butter for the dough, and you will NOT need a whole cup of milk. . To deal with the sticky dough just add flour until you can work with it. Also, use softened (not melted) butter for the filling.  As soon as they come out of the oven, I top them with icing (1 cup powdered sugar, 2 T melted butter, 1 1/2 T milk, 1/4 tsp vanilla, 1 T cornstarch). Just add a little icing over each roll and save the rest for people who Iike them really sweet.

So quick and delicious, perfect for a late-night baking expedition (I started at 10pm). Next time I will use a regular baking dish instead of muffin tins, my rolls expanded and leaked filling everywhere.

This were so delicious!  And quick and easy to make.  The only change I made was I used coconut oil instead of marg. because I was out of both marg and butter.  I really liked the idea of baking in a muffin tin!

Made this receipt three times already - worked fabulously. Although the couple of hour/yeast recipes have their place, that you can make these in under an hour is wonderful. Keep in mind, it does take more than 30 minutes to prepare (I would say closer to 40-45). I also used two round cake tins to make them - I spaced six per round (one in middle, others spaced around) no worries about space between them, they will expand while baking!

My family loved it!!!  It's a great recipe when you don't have time to play around with yeast. It was quick to prepare, and obviously when you are dealing with dough you do have to adjust the amount of flour. For everyone that complained it was sticky, no dough recipe is ever exact. You always have to make adjustments.  After reading the reviews I added about a 1/4 cup extra sugar and some vanilla to the dough.  I really let my mixer do all the work. After the ingredients were mixed I switched to the kneeding blade and adjusted the flour until it looked like a non-sticky dough. I rolled it out on a floured surface and that was it.  After reading reviews I made a creamcheese icing, it was good but I dont think I'll be using that again, even though I added milk to the "other" icing recipe it was more like frosting. Next time I will use the recipe that is provided here.  This was very very YUMMY and they were gone within just a few hours. Thank you for sharing this great recipe.

I substituted cashew butter for the actual butter and then added vanilla caramel powdered creamer to the powdered sugar and milk (which I used Almond/Coconut Milk).  Fabulous, probably the best tasting sticky buns (without yeast) I have ever made.  Wonderful recipe thanks.

This is really good! I did have to add 3/4 cup more flour to the batter-it was so wet it would never have rolled out. I also used chopped-up dates in stead of raisins, because that was all I had. I really enjoyed the result.

Very good! My favorite part is that they are yeast free. For those that are looking for a typical "doughy" texture, you should look elsewhere--but for those that are content with a great "biscuity brown sugary" goodness, look no further!   The bun mixture is sticky however with perseverance, patience and extra flour at hand to keep the dough and your hands from sticking together it will all work out just fine.   Thank you for this lovely, easy recipe that requires very accessible and common pantry ingredients!

I cannot understand how this recipe gets such great reviews.  The major problem is the dough.  Once I mixed everything together (and I measure everything precisely) the dough wasn't anywhere NEAR stiff enough to knead, let alone roll out.  It didn't even "pull together" like dough does.  I had to add more flour, which I did a little at a time, just to be able to get it out of the bowl in one piece.  All in all, I probably added at least another 1 1/2 cups of flour, which I also added in a smidge of extra baking powder and salt to accomadate for.  There has to be something wrong with the measurments in the ingredient list, a typo maybe?  Secondly, the filling isn't sticky at all.  What didn't spill out onto the top of the muffin pan and burn, was dry and hard.  And I even pulled it out of the oven almost 10 minutes early, because I smelled burnt sugar.  The reason I'm giving this recipe 2 stars is because after everything, the "sticky buns" tasted ok.  They were edible.  Not a recipe I will ever use again though.

My 10 year old daughter and I decided to make these on a Sunday Morning.....I did not care for this recipe. Dough? not from this recipe it was way too wet..we added flour but it was impossible to roll out. We salvaged this "dough" and tried to make muffins but we will definitely not be making this again!

I made these for a family dessert and they were a big flop.
 The filling is too sugary and really not sticky at all.
 The dough is very sticky, almost like bubble gum, and the flour needed for kneeding and rolling flat the dough gives buns a floury taste.

A perfect recipe.  Use 3/4 milk instead of a whole cup.
I also made these VEGAN by using margarine and soymilk. I give this recipe six thumbs up. (Two for each member of my family!)

Yumm! These were great! Because the dough was so wet I did not roll it out but patted it with well floured hands on a floured cutting board to the desired thickness. I then flipped the dough over and patted it again then I spread the bnrown sugar mixture over it and rolled it up . I didn't have any trouble slicing the dough ,however I floured the knife between slices. I also put the rolls in a glass bakeware dish instead of a muffin tin . I then inverted the glass dish onto a large cutting board after cooking the rolls. I will definetly be making these again!

it was pretty good. of course I had to adapt it to meet what I had in the kitchen - so I fault the missing two stars to that. if I only had some items it would've turned out better.
