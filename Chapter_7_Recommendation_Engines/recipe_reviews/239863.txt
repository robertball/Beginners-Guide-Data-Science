I pretty much just used the filling recipe for this after reading the other reviews about the crust being soggy.  I chose instead to use 1 1/2 C graham cracker, 1/2 C Melted Butter, & 1/4 C Sugar and the crust came out crunchy like I prefer.  I also had to bake for much longer than the recipe suggested, but that could just be my oven.  That being said, the filling was awesome and everyone loved them!

I have made these for years. I don't do the graham crackers. I just use a vanilla wafer in each tin. Put the cream cheese mixture in and bake as usual. Too with the cherry pie filling etc. easier than having to mess with the graham cracker crust. Comes out perfect.

11.26.15   The crust seemed very wet, so I did add more graham cracker crumbs to press into the muffin cups.  Be sure to chill thoroughly to maximize the flavor.  Very, very easy to make with nice presentation

Awful recipe. Crust proportions were wrong and the directions were inaccurate. You can't beat the eggs with everything together or your cheesecake comes out eggy. My fault for not noticing their lack of instructions beforehand.

Graham cracker crust is wrong. 1cup crumbs to 3/4c butter; this needs to be fixed. I used 1 box of graham crumbs to the 3/4 c butter to get it to the correct consistency.

I didn't care for this recipe. The original graham cracker crusts were soggy, so I used vanilla wafers for the crust.  Tthis recipe was supposed to make 24 cup cakes, but mine only made 17.  I didn't even fill the cups half full.  Bake time has also been understated instead of 10 minutes they have now been in the oven for 17 minutes and are still not done.  I found this whole process frustrating and not sure I will ever try it again.

Made as written except I used Nabisco wafers instead of the graham cracker crust.  Was perfect that way to avoid sogginess.  Great recipe and will continue to make.

The cheesecake was perfect.  I made these for a mother's day luncheon at church, and they were gone right away.  I did have to bake them longer, probably about 15-18 minutes is more like it.
