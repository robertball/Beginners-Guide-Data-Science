My quest for an excellent Peanut Butter Ice Cream ends here.  This base is fantastic and the Peanut Butter cups are a nice addition.  I substituted skim milk for whole.  I replaced the condensed milk and half-half with 1 1/4 c heavy cream and 3/4 c sugar.  The first batch is almost gone!  Yummy.

This turned out great!  I was a little worried at first because I used 2% milk and the milk/sugar/egg mix never got really thick, but it turned out fine.

This ice cream is superb - thanks Maria for the recipe. My husband is a huge peanut butter cup fan and this recipe did not disappoint. I used 2 per cent milk in place of the whole milk, and whole milk in place of the half-and half. I used light condensed milk, 1 tsp of vanilla and 1/3 cup of peanut butter (as some indicated it was too peanut buttery). I couldn't find miniature peanut butter cups, so used 6 regular sized cups, chopped. To deal with the thickening issue other reviewers identified, I beat the eggs and sugar on high speed (I have a Kitchen Aid electric mixer - so things usually need less time than indicated) for 4 minutes. The cooking time to make the custard is then the 5 minutes, as it's already thick to begin with - and because the recipe makes a custard, the lower fat milks still yield a creamy texture. I'll definitely make again and add some skim milk next time just to see the results.

we changed the settings to 14 servings for a family event. I also used recees peices instead of cups. It was really sweet. Almost too sweet. And a very rich peanut butter flavor.

My husband is a peanut butter freak everything has to be peanut butter.  I messed up by trying this recipe.  Every other week the question is "honey, when are you making the peanut butter ice cream again?"

Oh Man!  This is some seriously good ice cream.  Perfect amount for a two pint maker, too.  I froze the p-nut butter cups after chopping them and before I folded them into the ice cream.

Super creamy!  Yum!

So delicious!  This was my first time ever making ice cream and this was perfect.  My husband and his brother both said it was the best ice cream they have ever had- and they are serious ice cream lovers as well as very honest food critics!  I think I added a little less PB, maybe a 1/2 cup and it was still peanut buttery without being too much. I will most definitely be making this again. . . and again.  Thanks for the great recipe!

It was very good but I think next time I will cut back on the peanut butter and condensed milk as I thought it was a little to sweet and the peanut butter was a little to over powering.  I added some extra milk.  I will continue to make as it was good but for our taste needed some adjustments.

I made this with my husband and we loved it!!!  I was worried because it took ~15mins of slow cooking to thicken the mix sine I used 2% milk instead of whole milk and cream instead of half and half and chocolate chips instead of PB cups (since that's what we had in the house) but it still came out so creamy and peanut buttery!! We plan on making this treat again!!!

This is such a delicious, creamy ice cream! As a peanut butter lover, the pure nutty flavor is perfect (although it might overpower someone wh's not a 100% PB fan). Using 2% milk will also work for this recipe and lightens the ice cream up a bit. A definite repeat in my household!

This came out great the first time I made it, and even better after I adjusted to my own personal taste. The first time I made it, I felt it was a little too sweet so I:
used heavy cream and additional sugar for a total of 2/3 cup of sugar (I never have sweetened condensed milk), added about 2 tablespoons of good cocoa powder, and didn't add as many peanut butter cups. I also added about 1/4 tsp of kosher salt. The salt really enhanced the flavor of the peanut butter. I usually only have extra crunchy peanut butter so I put it in the food processor to make it creamier. This results in tiny bits of peanuts. :)
Everyone loves it, and the texture is divine. Thanks for sharing!

Doubled the recipe for a 2 qrt machine.  Used whipping cream instead of milk, only because it has a longer shelf life than milk, and only 1 teaspoon vanilla.  I froze my peanut butter cups so they were easy to chop before adding the pieces the ice cream the last 5 minutes in the machine.  Highly reccomend this recipe.

Last year I made this for some party. Everyone LOVED it! They keeped asking me the same two questions, "How did you make this?" and "Where in the world did you get this recipe?". So I told them to look up this, Peanut Butter Cup Ice Cream, so they can enjoy it at their house too!

My dad said the only ice cream he has ever had that was creamier is Haagan-Dazs.  My husband said I have achieved what others (including Ben & Jerry's) have not, ice cream that actually tastes like peanut butter!

One factor that I think is important for this recipe is what kind of peanut butter you like.  This recipe does not specify which one to use.  Only a few reviewers really acknowledged in their reviews what kind of peanut butter they used.  I think that this recipe will probably come out very different based just on what kind of peanut butter used.  For example, regular peanut butter already has sugar in it, varying amounts based on the brand too, and different kinds of oils/fats, whereas natural peanut butter is usually just peanuts and salt (sometimes not even salt).  What our culture typically calls peanut butter is really a peanut-flavored spread.  Natural peanut butter tastes like peanuts.  It just comes down to personal preference.

I was shooting for a more natural peanut butter flavor in my ice cream.  Therefore, I followed this recipe with only a few alterations that changed this recipe to fit our tastes. 1)I used 2% milk instead of whole milk. 2)I used natural peanut butter (ingredients were peanuts and salt), the entire 3/4 cup as is stated in the recipe. 3)I only used 1/2 cup sweetened condensed milk because I didn't want the sweet taste to overpower the peanut taste. It was OUT OF THIS WORLD! I can't believe I made ice cream so creamy and tasty!

INCREDIBLE!!!  My whole family loved this ice cream.  The peanut butter flavor was amazing!  I followed the recipe to a T except I stirred in crushed Butterfinger into half instead of PB cups because Butterfinger is our favorite candy bar.  The other half I left plain and served it over sauteed bananas with drizzled honey, crunchy bacon and honey roasted peanuts for an "Elvis" sundae.  You won't be sorry with this recipe.

Rivals Ben & Jerry's!!!

I doubled the recipe, but used 2 full cans of sweetened condensed milk because I was too lazy to measure.  Then I added more milk (not quite to my ice cream freezer's fill line.)  because it already seemed thick and rich before it was frozen, and I wanted enough to go around.  I also used our homemade peanut butter (it's kind of like Smucker's natural pb.) 

Served it right away instead of putting it in the freezer overnight.  

Soooooo good for this 38 1/2-week pregnant mama!

This recipe was awesome. I can only give it four stars though because we altered it slightly. First, my kitcheaid ice cream maker attachment makes 2 quarts so we doubled this recipe - VERY good idea! Second, we used crunchy peanut butter instead of smooth - again, a VERY good idea. Third, we didn't add peanut butter cups. The peanuts from the crunchy pb added enough variety.

This is the BEST icecream I have made yet! I substituted half and half for the cream for a lower fat version. Very rich and creamy. It does take a while for the mixture to thicken, but I just kept stirring and gradually turning up the heat. If you want a less rich version cut down on the peanut butter.

this was pretty darn good....I used it to make a Peanut butter cup ice cream cake. I used a chocolate cake as three layers and the ice cream in between. It turned out to be awesome. THere were about 40 people at the party (I made two cakes) and everyone loved it. Thank you so much for the recipe.

Worked great with all natural kraft pb. Was sweet but not overly sweet but definatly heavy.Froze it over night after processing it in my kitchenaid ice cream attachment to temper the ice cream. Only mod I did was to double th recipe and used heavy cream and skim milk (what I had on hand) I used David Lebovitz's online ice cream making tip so I added 2tsp of vodka to prevent the ice cream to freeze rock hard but might increase to 1Tbsp next time since it was still too hard to scoop for 2Ltr of ice cream.

This ice cream has a wonderful consistency.  I made it following the directions exactly and then again with 1% milk in place of the condensed milk but with an extra 1/3 cup of sugar.  Both ways were great.  I also chopped up reeses cups and added during the last 5 minutes in the ice cream maker.

My husband wants to marry me all over again.  He is a peanut butter & chocolate junkie.  My son and I love PB too, so I knew this would go over pretty well.  I will say, though, that I'm SO glad I read the reviews about lessening the pb.  I only put 1/2 cup and it was still VERY rich, and like I said we love pb in this house, so at least consider reducing it a bit.  I may even put a little less next time, and/or add a little more milk, because it also was extremely thick.  After letting it chill in the freezer for a couple hours it was like a brick, lol.  I used a couple of regular size dark chocolate pb cups instead of the minis (more cost efficient), and I had homemade chocolate syrup on hand for topping just in case it was too rich, and that ended up taking the edge off the "pb straight from the jar" taste.  Tasted like a frozen reese's.  I am SO my family's hero right now!

I made this with my brand new Cuisinart ice cream maker, and I made it the nigh before and it was in the refrigerator for over 15 hours and I had to stir it a bit, but it froze in under 20 minutes and I put it in the freezer from then. It came out perfectly, it's very rich, but very soft and it has a wonderful texture. I definitely will make this again. Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

Wow... this ice cream is GREAT! My husband and father-in-law both love anything peanut butter. We brought this to our family Super Bowl party and it was a great hit! The only substitutions I made was to use 2% milk instead of whole milk and Nutter Butter cookies instead of peanut butter cups. We will definetly make this again...

I got an ice cream maker for Mother's Day, and this was my first homemade ice cream. It is delicious, although VERY sweet. I skipped adding the granulated sugar after reading reviews, and it was still a bit sweet for me. I double the batch on the base and left the peanut butter out of half to make a blackberry-cheesecake ice cream. Both were wonderful, but next time I would double everything except the condensed milk to cut the sweetness more.  Thanks for the recipe!!

We like peanut butter cup ice cream, and this is BY FAR the best we've ever had!  I increased the amount of half and half to  1 c. instead of just 1/2 c. This was due in part to excess half and half that needed to be used up and due in part to the lack of fat content in one cup of (whole) milk and 1/2 cup half and half.  I used Smucker's Natural Peanut Butter for the peanut butter.  Processed in my kitchen aid mixer with the ice cream attachment. It worked out excellent!  Because of the 3/4 cup of sweetened condensed milk, you could leave out the sugar (I didn't, but we tend to like things on the sweet side)...  Love to Bake, thanks SO MUCH for this recipe!  Everyone else, try it, you'll like it!

Too sweet. I ended up putting it back into the ice cream machine and adding an extra cup of whole milk to thin out some of the condensed. 5 stars after adding the milk. Between my husband, son and I, the entire thing was gone in 3 days. I think this will be one of our favorites and will be definitely making this again.

Incredibly creamy and delish. I did the 1-1/2 c. milk and 3/4 c. heavy cream from another reviewer. I think this would be good as Milk Chocolate Hazelnut, subbing Trader Joe's Chocolate Hazelnut spread for the PB (but NOT Nutella as it has too many additives and lacks real chocolate and hazelnut flavor!)

Great recipe! I followed it exactly despite all the claims of it being "too peanut buttery" and "too sweet." I think most of the users probably used a name brand peanut butter like JIFF or SKIPPY, which has TONS of added sugar. I used a natural peanut butter with nothing but peanuts, no sugar. I added a pinch of salt to the mix to help heighten the peanut flavor. It worked great! Marking as a Favorite to make again.

Delicious.  I didn't use the full amount of sugar and didn't even put in the peanut butter cups - I tasted it before I did it and couldn't stop eating!  Fabulous texture and peanut butter taste.

I followed the directions to this recipe exactly as written, but after chilling in the fridge and then put into the ice cream machine, it would not set.  After 25 minutes, it was still soupy.  I decided just to put it into the freezer anyway to see if I could salvage it.  This morning it was definitely hard, but not creamy.  It tastes a lot like frozen peanut butter.  Not that that is a bad thing.  My kids think this stuff is the "bomb".  Since they are the ones that I made it for and who love it, I am giving it 4 stars because of the freezing problem.

This was amazing! I used regular Reese cups rather than the miniature ones though because they have more peanut butter and I just chopped them into small pieces.

Too much peanut butter!  My husband liked it mixed with vanilla ice cream, but not by itself.  Next time I will cut the peanut butter at least in half.

My family loved this ice cream. The only I changed was after reading some reviews that said the peanut butter was too strong, I opted for coarsely chopping a semi sweet chocolate baking square instead of the peanut butter cups and was really glad I did. The extra chocolate gave the peanut butter a bit more balance.

WOW this is the BEST ice-cream I've ever had in my life!!  I didn't watch the egg and cream mixture close enough and it curdled.  To save it, I strained the mixture and continued on with the recipe.

I use my ice cream maker several times a week and this is the best ice cream I have ever made! I cannot keep my spoon out of the machine while it's churning! I am going to weigh 300 lbs.--I cannot stop eating this stuff! I better limit how often I make it! I used natural peanut butter, BTW.

This was awesome! I got a little carried away with the peanut butter. I mistakingly added a little too much peanut butter. I thought that since i love peanut better I should add a little more. Whew, i thought i was eating frozen peanut butter on a spoon! Stick to the recipe guys, maybe a little less peanut butter if anything.

Fabulous!  Like another reviewer, I used only a (heaping) 1/3 c peanut butter, and it is still intense.  I used 2% milk, which worked.  Crunchy pb gives a great texture.  I added choc chips to the Reeses bc chocolate and pb is so good!  Hope I dont eat it all in one sitting.

This ice cream was excellent! It received rave reviews from all of my family! The recipe didn't lie when it says that this ice cream is very rich - a little goes a long way! I refridgerated the peanut butter cups for about a half an hour before cutting them up, so that the chocolate didn't melt as much.

If you like to eat peanut butter out of the jar this is the ice cream for you. But for me it was a bit too much. I will make it again but next time I'll use a little less peanut butter.

First, I make a lot of ice cream and second, we all love peanut butter in my family. That said, this was far too sweet and way to peanutty. I might try again with less peanut butter but I expected better based on other reviews. Maybe it’s just me.....

I think this recipe is  delicious. I mixed up the milk and was left with 1/2 cup of the sweetened condensed milk so increased my half-n-half milk accordingly.  I also used 2% instead of whole milk.   Will be making it again.

Very creamy!  I don't drink whole milk and the grocery store didn't sell any small sizes so used half and half for the whole thing.  Was very custard like.  Delicious and big hit!!

I made this exactly, except - I used homemade nutella in place of the peanut butter and left out the peanut butter cups. This will be my base recipe for a lot of things! The homemade nutella ice cream was Ah...May...zing!!!

Holy smokes - this is good!  If you want a recipe that produces the texture and taste of an upscale creamery, this is the recipe for you.  Followed exactly, only adding a step to strain the custard before whisking in the peanut butter, (just in case) and I froze the chopped peanut butter cups while the mixture was chilling. Perfect amount for my cuisinart - family clamored for more.  Will make again!

Tasty ice cream.  Some of us LOVED it.  I thought the peanut butter was too strong, but like I said, not a bad tasting ice cream.

This was tasty. I subbed in some Nutella for a bit of the peanut butter. it was still very soft after quite a while in the ice cream maker, so I see why the directions tell you to put it in the freezer.

I modified this based on the reviews and substituted ingredients for what I had on hand.  I replaced the whole milk for skim, and as I did not have any condensed milk I used cream/sugar as suggested by another.  I also halved the PB.  So my ingredients were as follows:  3 eggs, 1c skim milk, 1/2c PB, 3/4 sugar, 1.5c half and half cream, 2 tsp vanilla. It was perfect.

Well, the idea of this ice cream is great.  I'm a fan of peanut butter, especially with chocolate, but this ice cream had too much peanut butter for me.  Next time I would probably cut the peanut butter to no more than 1/2 cup, maybe even 1/3 cup.  But then, I usually prefer my chocolate to be the dominant flavor, so maybe next time I'll make a chocolate ice cream, add about 1/4 peanut butter to it plus the peanut butter cups.  However, I'm still giving this 4 stars because it was good and rich, just not quite what I was looking for.

my peanut-butter-loving husband said this was too peanut-buttery.  go figure.  he's a huge fan of Ben&Jerry's Peanut Butter Cup ice cream, so i guess this was a bit overdone on the peanut butter.  he ate a little bit and then left it for dead.  i'm not a pb fan, so i can't give an accurate review myself on the comparison.  back to the drawing board.

I made it for 3 quarts/24 servings last weekend and it was delish! I took it to my boyfriend's family dinner and they devoured it. I used 2% milk because I don't drink whole and used a 15 oz jar of creamy peanut butter. Great recipe!!

Ohhhhh goodness this is tasty!  I'd give it six stars if I could! I used the amount of peanut butter called for in the recipe & I thought it was great.  ...but I'm also a peanut butter junkie.  Can't wait to make again.

I give this recipe a 4 star rating even though it is absolutely delicious because i think if you use the amount of peanut butter called for it would way to much, like eating peanut butter straight out of the container. But of course everyone has different tastes. I used a little less than 1/2 cup p butter and the rest i followed the recipe, and it is super creamy and delicious. I might even add less peanut butter next time, like 1/4 cup.

I probably wont make this again. The icecream its self was overly thick with peanut butter. 2 of my kids like it the rest of us felt we might as well have been eating peanut butter straight from the jar.

Great!! Rich and creamy! The only thing I did different was to add small slivers of chocolate in the last minute instead of peanut butter cups.  Will so be making this again.

The only change I would make to this recipe would be to double the amount of peanut butter cups added to the ice cream mixture.    Otherwise this ice cream was awesome.  Very rich, very creamy, and very dense.  Great recipe.

This ice cream was great. The ice cream itself reminded me of the peanut ice cream I get at the local grocery stores here and the peanut butter cups were a wonderful addition. Would definitely make again.

When we make homemade ice cream, we usually rip into it right after it's done mixing and still in that soft-serve stage (before putting in the freezer).  We tried doing that with this recipe, and I have to admit that I hated it at first.  The flavor was good, but the texture was like eating thick cookie dough.  (I'm a fan of cookies, but not the raw dough.)  We put it in the freezer for a few days and then tried again.  It was wonderful!  My husband loved it too and requested that we make it again.

Awesome! I used 4 regular sized peanut butter cups (frozen) and 1/2 cup of chocolate chips (frozen) and it was soo yummy! My soft serve ice cream maker didn't do the job so I stuck it in the freezer overnight, thanks love to bake for this recipe!

1st recipe using my ice cream maker and it was very good.  I used fat free half and half.  Might use 2% milk and less peanut butter next time.

This was my first time using my ice cream maker, and this recipe was a good one to start off with.  It was very dense and sweet- probably sweeter than I thought it was going to be.  If I make it again next time I will use more peanut butter cups, and maybe some chocolate chips to give it more of a chocolate/peanut butter flavor.

Super peanut-buttery, but still great! This was my first time to make ice cream, and it was amazing. We used the Reese's peanut butter shapes that you can get around the holidays instead of the miniature cups. I thought it could it could use a bit more chocolate, but my peanut butter-loving fiance and best friend both loved it and asked for more.

I added more peanut butter cups...which is my fault and made it too rich.
