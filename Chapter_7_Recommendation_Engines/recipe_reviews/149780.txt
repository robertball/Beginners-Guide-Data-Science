Ok Well this recipe was WAY off, but it's really good when done correctly. If you leave this in for 8-10 hours it's going to be a brick! I had a larger roast and it was over done at like 4 hours when I started to temp it. Start to temp this after two or three hours and it should come out ok. If you do over cook it, just slice it up and put it in a pot with gravy and it will come out more moist, and will be like pot roast. Then Add the original drippings to the gravy depending on how spicy you would like it. The flavor of this was REALLY great though! I highly recomned this, just remember to temp it earlier than the recipe says.

The flavor is awesome tasty!!  I cooked my 3lb roast for 5 hours and it was a little dry, but putting the drippings on it made it wonderful!  Next time I'm going to try doubling the ingredients except the roast and see if that helps.

I gotta tell you that I made this and even without the Horseradish it was very good.  I did add a little beef broth because I was afraid that it would be too dry and I wasn't going to be home to check on it.  We made sandwiches out of it and it was gone fast.  Next time I'm going to try it with the Horse radish and buy a bigger cut of roast.

My whole family loved it.  I added a little extra cajun seasoning per some other comments and it was pretty spicy.  I used a 4 lb top round roast cut in half and doubled the recipe.  Didn't marinate the night before, but it was still great.  We cooked it all day, so it was past med. but it was so tender it just shredded into pieces.  We mixed in the sauce. Some of us made sandwiches and some put it on mashed potatoes.  Definately a keeper!  A refreshing change from italian beef in a crockpot.

I doubled this and used it as a marinade for 5 pounds of moose. The next day we added a bottle of beer to the mixture and let it rest for 30-45 minutes at room temp and then slowly grilled the meat (topped with bacon).  I do not eat moose, but received lots of positive feedback and was asked immediately for the recipe.  We will be using this recipe again soon.  Thanks for sharing!

The marinade sounds great. When I make this, I'll do it the way I've made eye of round before. High temp. to start ( 425-450.) roast 15 min. per pound. Without opening oven, lower heat to 250 and roast another 1 to 1 1/2 hrs. til med. rare.  This keeps the meat tender and juicy and very pink in the center. I did this with a 2# roast.

The flavor was really good.  I did not have the HR sauce at the time when I marinaied my roast.  I did put a couple of Tbs HR sauce on the roast when I put it in the crock pot.  I added some garlic to the marinaide as well and DOUBLED the spices cus we like a lot of flavor. Flavor we got!  This would be really good on some buttered toasted buns for sandwiches.  You could use the spices as a rub for smoking ribs, brisket or an arm roast.  I will make this again...maybe next time putting on a pork roast. Thanks!UPDATE: WITH THE LEFT OVERS WE PUT ON SANDWHICHES AND ALSO IN FLOUR TORT. I ALSO UP ON PITA BREAD THE PUT A LAYER OF MOTZ CHEESE AND BAKED IN THE OVEN FOR 8 MIN. AT 350. YUMMY

I was looking for a new way to roast a venison backstrap and found this recipe.  The spice blend is fabulous!  The flavor really permeates and tenderizes.  Using half a backstrap, I marinated in this and roasted for 25 minutes at 375 (for rare), then allowed to rest for 10 minutes before slicing.  Hubby and I both thought the flavor was perfect!  Many thanks!

The flavor wasn't what I had hoped for. It was too bland for me and to dry. It was a nice base though for a few changes I plan on making.

This was fantastic.  Like a previous reviewer, I used cider vinegar because I didn't have malt.  I put in extra horseradish because we like spice, but it actually wasn't too spicy.  Great taste, though.  I cooked it for 8 hours on low, then sliced it and put it back in the original drippings.  We used it in steak Po'Boy sandwiches (french bread, mayo, lettuce, tomato).  Really, really great recipe.

This is a great recipe!  I htink the only thing wrong is the choice of meat.  Eye of the round is about the worst meat you could chose for the slow cooker.  It has very little fat and collagen which is needed to keep meat moist and tender over long periods of cooking.  A better choice might be chuck roast, rump roast or even brisket.  The marinade is wonderful.

I read through all the reviews before making this, and couldn't decide how long to leave the meat in the crockpot.  We ended being away from home longer than anticipated, so the meat cooked the full 10 hours.  By that time, the meat had cooked for so long that it shredded without any effort.  We'll eat the leftovers on sandwich rolls.  I did leave out the horseradish (didn't have any, and I don't care for it anyway) and used cider vinegar instead of malt.  I would make this again.

I cooked this a little too long and it fell apart. That's not necessarily bad leftovers good on a sandwich with some hot sauce. Yummy!

Awful if you want your roast anything but well done.  Cooked a 4-1/2lb roast for 4 hours and it was tough as shoe leather - well beyond anything resembling rare.  Maybe tender if left in as long as indicated but we wanted a medium rare roast.  Will never make again.

Very good!  Like most other reviews, do not cook that long!  We did a 3lb roast on low for 2.5 hours and my husband would have preferred some pink and there was none.  We also did extra garlic and red pepper flakes-- we love spice!  Great recipe.

I fixed this dinner last night but put it on the grill on low for almost two hours. Sliced the meat thin and served. It was amazing! Thought the crock pot might make the meat tough. Love grilling this!

This turned out so good.  I didn't have malt vinegar so subbed cider vinegar.  Served this with the Brazilian white rice from AR, salad and a crusty bread.  Yummy.  

Left over's were great to if you shredd meat, reheat with some beef broth, add to toasted hoggie rolls, top with mozzerella cheese and broil till cheese is melted. Makes for a great left over meal.

This was good, however I couldn't taste much of the spices.  After 4 and 1/2 hours on LOW, this 2-1/2 pound roast was at 169 degrees F.  Was medium rare as I wanted.

The marinade is great. Being from Louisiana, I just had to double the horseradish and Cajun seasonings. I also used fresh garlic cloves all over the roast making little slits and inserting them.   I have discovered a wonderful method cooking large cuts of meat. My children gave me an electric smoker - so easy to use. And you don't have to worry about the fire going out while you go do other things. I put the marinated roast on the smoker and plug it in. (There is a pan below where you put water to keep moisture in). Cook for 30 min per pound, testing after 2 hours for desired rareness/doneness. I LOVE my smoker - cook with smoke it without.

I thought that this was a great way to change up roast beef!  My girls loved it.  She said it kind of reminded her of corned beef.  I will make again.

Followed directions as outlined. Slow cooked for 7 hours not 8 ! To attempt to achieve medium rare.... This didn 't work, meat was dry and over cooked. You could taste how flavorful the seasoning was, but I suggest cooking for no more then 6 hours...

Great recipe- came out with wonderful flavor! Was slightly dry (but might be due more to cut of meat?) Would highly recommend!

The marinade didn't give my roast much flavour.  It only needed 3 hours on high in the slow cooker.

Followed the directions and after 8 hrs it was beyond well done.  I ended up shredding the roast with 2 forks, and throwing it back in to the crock pot with a can of beef broth to add to the juice already in there for about another 15 minutes.  My husband said it was the best French Dip he ever had, so there's that.

Not a fan of hot stuff so I left out the horseradish and it still had a little kick to it.  I would make it again.

very nice spices combo. I agree that cooking to the time they list is too much, made it a bit dry

Good.  Use half the salt.

I was surprised to find this recipe had very little taste, and I followed the recipe as outlined.  I cooked it for a shorter time as well, and was glad I did as any longer it would have been even more of a bust.  You'll need gravy with this guy.

Great Flavor! Substituted cider vinegar for malt, added 1 cup beef stock and injected roast with some of the marinade. Allowed to marinade overnight. Grilled in a loaf pan, covered with foil for 2 1/2 hours at @ 300 degrees. Probably should have pulled it off after 2. It was a little dry but when drizzled with the gravy I made from the drippings it was absolutely delicious!

Excellent Flavor!  I doubled the ingredients and used a 3lb roast.  The roast was cooked for 6 hours on low and I used a meat thermometer to get it to medium done.  Excellent advice in the comments to use the meat thermometer to gauge things.

This had great taste, but I follwed the time reqd. and had a very dry roast. I am going to only do for about 4-5 hours. It also only fed 4 people.
