The only thing tht I do different is add 7 tbls of conf. sugar and 7 tbls of water, that way the don't fall apart.  I also omit the nuts and cloves.  After they cool good I put conf. sugar in a bag and put cokkies in the bag so tney are covered in the sugar!! Awesome!

I followed the directions only to end up with a rather bland cookie.  They were also quite dry and tended to fall apart when I picked them up. Only a few were eaten and I had to throw the rest away.

my grandmother used to make these.  But it was done with 1 lb butter as base. easier to measure.

This one is the best one that I have found on this site.  I used it in my food processor and it came out well blended; the butter melted well, and baked uniform.    But the form on this site would not let me add the stars to rate it.
