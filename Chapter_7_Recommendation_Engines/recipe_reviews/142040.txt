I submitted this recipe and since then have used another cheese sauce that I like better. Saute in 6 Tbsp butter, 1/4 of a onion chop fine and 1/4 of bell pepper chop fine. I cook it in a double boiler to keep cheese from burning. Add 1 1/2 cups water, pound of velveeta chopped, and to thicken sauce dissolve Tbsp cornstarch in cold water and add to sauce. With this sauce if you have any leftover its good as a dip for chips.

I made this tonight and it was really good.  The cheese sauce was superlative.  I used cayenne instead of hot sauce because I prefer its kind of heat, and I added a splash of worchestershire sauce.  Also, I mixed some garlic powder, Lawry's season salt and pepper in with the meat because I don't like the taste of plain, unseasoned ground beef.  That's just personal preference and no reflection on the recipe.  My husband refused to let me put his french fries on top of his meat, so I served them on the side.  But we did pour the cheese sauce all over everything.  This was very filling and good.  I'll be making this cheese sauce for other things as well.

I'm so happy that someone posted this recipe!! Horseshoe's are the best and this recipe is great. If you like hamburgers and cheese fries you definitely need to try this.

Very good recipe, and pretty close to the classic sauce served here in Springfield, IL. For those who might want a bit of a bite to the sauce, try adding a small amount of worstershire sauce. That's what the locals do and its just enough to take away any blandness of the sauce.

Great recipe.  Had an in-law in Springfield that everyone hated, but the one bright spot to going down there was the Horseshoe.   If you add splashes of Worcestershire and a full bodied beer, you really get an authentic taste just like my favorite joint down there.
I'm sooo not a food snob but agree w/ other comment - cheese wiz, ketchup, mustard, chipotle, mayo....NOT a horseshoe!!

Good recipe! Use a steamburger or loose meat sandwich on a bun instead of a hamburger patty on toast & you have a magic mountain.  Top a magic mountain with chili & you get a volcano.  And heartburn!

Good but not great.  The sauce in the recipe is too bland and too thick.   Try this dish with Texas toast and a Welsh Rarebit sauce made with Irish ale.  Almost as if you had ordered it from D'Arcy's Pint.

Very excited to see this recipe!  I lived in Springfield and this recipe is a family favorite! But, omg!, to hear someone saying they are using "cheese wiz out of a jar" instead of making the cheese sauce! That is NOT a horseshoe!  So please follow the recipe,stir the mixture slowly and give it time and you will be rewarded with a fabulous sauce to pour over your hamburger, shaved turkey or shaved ham with french fries!  Now someone please put the recipe for the spring rolls from the Springfield Thai restaurant!  yummmmm I do miss the great places to eat in Springfield!

We didn't really like this. It was very bland and definitely not worth the calories. In the future when I have a craving for the ingredients in this recipe I will just stick with a regular cheese burger and french fries.

This made a really good dinner tonight. It only took thirty min. and was very filling. I put the meat between two pieces of waxed paper and used a rolling pin to make a rectangle then I simply cut into 4 square patties with my cooking shears. They came perfectly sized for the toasted bread. It was so easy to get the super thin patties into the pan from the paper. I sprinkled the patties with tiny bit of krazy salt and pepper. This did make more cheese sauce than we needed. We had never heard of horseshoe before and we all enjoyed this dish. "Tasty and out of the ordinary" and  "I think I kinda liked it" were my hubby's comments. I will make this again! Thanks Kehn for sharing your local favorite so we could all enjoy!!! This gets a five for ease of prep, ingredients ordinarily avail, fast from start to table, flavor, and just being a comfort food.

I'm from Spfld, IL and have been making horseshoes for years - it's easy! The orig recipe by kehn is good, but I'm listing some additional tips. You can use any type of meat, and season the meat how you always would. Hamburger is most popular, but you can also use ham, grilled or breaded chicken breasts, crispy bacon, shrimp, Italian beef - it's up to you. (This is an excellent recipe for any leftover meat!)  You also choose the bread (white, wheat, etc.), just make sure it's toasted.  Make your favorite type of fries - we prefer the skinny straight ones.  And because these are so filling, you can make a ponyshoe instead of a horse (one piece of bread instead of 2.) As listed in kehn's recipe, you're going to make a basic white sauce - I use 2 cups milk (you choose the type, they all work fine - skim, whole, half n half), 3 tbs flour and 3 tbs. butter. Once the white sauce is made, you're going to add a few things to make it the "horseshoe" sauce.  First stir in 2-3 Tbs Worcestershire sauce, then (and this is a must!) stir in a DROP of real mustard (not dry mustard). Lastly stir in the cheese.  I have friends who add 2-3 Tbs of Velveeta or Cheese Whiz to the sauce, but I use shredded cheddar, stirring until completely melted. (Use S&P to taste.) The original recipe by kehn is close, but you definitely have to add the Worcestershire sauce and the mustard to make it even yummier! I also agree with another reviewer that D'Arcy's Pint makes the best, so visit Spfld! :)

Pretty tasty! I've had horseshoes in Springfield before and these aren't *quite* as good, but close. First of all, I cut the recipe in half and that was plenty for 2 of us. One slice of bread with all the fixings (a ponyshoe) was more than enough for each of us. Secondly, I wish I would have cut the cheese sauce down even further because there was SO much of it! I used a pretty liberal amount and still have tons left over. Instead of half and half, I used 1% milk. Third, I seasoned the patties with onion powder, garlic powder, and black pepper to add some more flavor. Finally, the cheese sauce wasn't really doing it for me as written. I splashed in some worcestershire, which gave it a nice boost. Thanks :)

This was just ok for us.  I deviated from the recipe only to add a dash of garlic and worcestershire sauce to the cheese sauce, and I used sharp cheddar.  I did serve with sauteed mushrooms, onions, and peppers, also.  It just seems to be lacking in something, and it's a lot of effort to put into something that's mediocre for our tastes.  It was fun to try, though.

Try the bitesize shrimp in place of hamburger or turkey and when in a hurry I use Campbell's Cheddar Cheese Soup in place of that in the recipe. If you think it is too bland, you are not using enough hot sauce.  Enjoy!

We live in Springfield, and this recipe seems pretty accurate. I suggest adding 1/4 to 1/3 cup of worcestershire to the cheese sauce to give it a more authentic flavor.

This worked really well with grilled chicken breast tenders in stead of ground beef for a bit lighter option too.

Tried this recipe because I saw an episode of Diners, Dives and Drive-Ins where they made Horseshoes and they looked so good.  Giving this a 4 as the sauce came out very, very thick even with following the directions - but I'm sure I did something wrong and it was my fault?  I cooked our fries a little too crispy so I'll cook them a little less next time.  Any tips on how to make the sauce come out a little thinner? I was out of milk so added 2 Tbsp. sour cream but that didn't help much.  Thanks!

very bland and the cheese got grainy when it cooled a bit on the plate. I have 5 kids and nobody liked it, but it was edible. We did not however add hot sauce. I added it to my personal plate along with a pile of jalapenos.

This was good! I used milk instead of the 1/2 and 1/2 because that is what I had on hand. I also added a slice of sweet onion between the beef patty and bread. Very Savory!

Mixed reviews at our table, but I thought they were pretty good.  Served with broccoli, using the cheese sauce.  We had just been discussing how to make a cheese sauce that was better than Velveeta.  Now I know!

I made this for my husband and I the other night and we thought it was pretty good, but not outstanding.  I also seasoned the beef with some Montreal steak spice to give it a little kick, I made my own (deep fried) french fries and I used milk instead of cream for the cheese sauce.  We found it all a little bit bland, so if I do make it again, I'll likely add some pepper jack cheese and parmesan to jazz up the cheese sauce.

We had these Sunday night and they were great! This was a really fun supper. I bought a jar of Cheese Whiz and melted this for the cheese topping.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was so good!  My husband loved it.

Instead of half-and-half I used Fat Free Skim milk.  Also there was way too much cheese sauce.  Next time I will cut it in half.  Very tasty meal, will make again.

I've never had Horseshoe before, never heard of it actually. But it was the perfect compliment while watching the Bears game. Technically I made the ponyshoe, and it was filling on it's own. I don't think I could eat a whole horseshoe. Always a joy to try something new, thank you for the recipe.

these were pretty good. My hubby made the suggestion when I make them again is to warm some cheese from a jar instead of making the cheese sauce from scratch. and I spread ketchup and mustard on the bread

I made a lot of changes based on the reviews. I added Worcestershire sauce and a small amount of yellow mustard to the sauce, seasoned my burgers with Montreal steak seasoning, and deep fried the fries instead of baking them. Really good, but there was no way we could eat "a serving" of two sandwiches. One each was plenty, and we're big eaters.

Not bad.  Not as good as they make 'em at home, of course, but fair attempt.  Made me a little homesick.  I too would half the sauce next time.

WOW! I LOVED IT! I don't know why this isn't a more popular dish! the whole family loved it. I didn't have 1/2 & 1/2 on hand so I used my 1% milk, I creamed it in the blender then put it back in the pot and added only 1 cup cheese... GREAT sauce, I added a lot of hot sauce so it wasn't bland at all. I also used chicken that I slow boiled with olive oil and lots of spices. then shredded it on the toast.... WOW, so yummy!!! Thanks for sharing!

Not my thing. Definitely not worth the cost of cheese. Or the calories for that matter. Others I served it to, liked it though. I used the rest of the cheese sauce for mac and cheese. Added dry mustard, ground white pepper and fresh parsley. It was delicious!

We tried making the cheese twice, exactly by the recipe. It came out as less of a *sauce*, and more of a rubbery blob. It doesn't taste good. Is there something wrong with our method/execution?

If you want the best Horseshoe, visit D'Arcy's Pint in Springfield, IL!  They may even share their recipe with you.  There is also a cookbook put out by the Springfield, IL Junior League that has an EXCELLENT recipe for horseshoes.  I actually use THAT cheese sauce recipe for my baked Mac n Cheese.

We thought this was great! I can see how some thought it was a bit bland, though...I added some garlic powder to the cheese mixture, and seasoned the burger patties w/ salt, pepper and garlic powder before cooking. I used Ore-Ida Seasoned Crinkles for the fries, and they gave a nice flavor to the dish. served this over buttered/toasted burger buns. This was very tasty, and as we were eating, we were coming up w/ other add-ons like sauteed onios, bacon and tomato slices, all of which I plan to try next time! I will def be making this again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

...for true D'Arcy's Pub, Springfield IL taste, you MUST use Wisconsin White Cheddar for the cheese.....I also season the beef patties with Lawrey's Salt and Mc Cormick's California Garlic Powder with Parsley, but I always put that in my burgers.  My fry of choice is the shoestring, more surface to hold the crispiness under that beautiful cheese sauce...bon appetit!  (i gave 4 stars due to lack of healthiness only, i mean, come on, 1/2lb of burger per person???  Still, 5 star taste!)

Very good, exactly like the horseshoe  we had in Springfield! Except the cheese sauce was way better!  I used Lousianna hot sauce and it was perfect - the whole family loved it but  it is a heart attack on a plate! So can't have it too often! We also added bacon and steamed broccoli.

I am a retired chef from Springfield and now live in Indiana . I make these every once in a while for my husband and son. I use the white american cheese that you get at the deli and always use milk. Also, it is tradition to sprinkle a little paprika on top. I don't think you need to use so much butter and flour. I use about 2 Tbs. butter and 2 Tbs. flour for every 2 C. of liquid. Remember, the cheese is going to make the sauce thicker.  You can use any meat you like or even a grilled portabella mushroom. I agree with a lot of reviews that you need to season your meat but don't add much else to sauce except a dash worcestershire or else it's not a horseshoe!

great cheese sauce!  I love it with my fries extra crispy. There are so many variations on this recipe at local resteraunts here you can find at least 10-20 variations. I love the breakfast type with ham or bacon covered on hashbrowns and cheese sauce on a bed of toast. There is one resteraunt that has a Shrimp variation with what I think is some type of a parmesean cheese sauce, it is amazing! Have fun with this one!

I went to college near Springfield and had completely forgotten about this wonderful (albeit unhealthy) delicacy!  Indeed a splash of worchestershire sauce is necessary, and I prefer mine made with sliced deli turkey.  My kids can't believe I have waited 15 years to share this wonderful dish with them!

This was bland and dry.  It was not so much a cheese sauce but cheese gravy.  Not good....I considered saving the leftover sauce to use as a base for macc and cheese but hubby said no. What a waste of all that cheese.

Not being from the Midwest, I'd never heard of these before,and they turned out to be really good! We made the cheese sauce as written, but we added mayo and onions. I really thought it was WAY too much food for two people---this feeds at least four!!!

Kewl that this originated in Springfield, the city I was born in! I have only seen them in Quincy, Illinois (where I grew up) and figured that was where they originated. Horseshoes and ponyshoes are also made of pulled pork there. My favorite is at O'Griff's Bar & Grill and are made with seasoned curly fries, pulled pork, shredded cheeese(melted over it) and drizzled with yummy barbeque sauce. *****

Each of us having only one 'sandwich' each was totally filling! Two is too much for one person. These were good, though. The sauce, I thought, was very light and fluffy. Was very good.

This cheese sauce is amazing! Cheez Whiz can't even begin to compare, so definitely take the time to make the sauce. The hamburgers were bland, so next time I'll season them up tons. I used extra crispy french fries so they would hold up better under the sauce. I also didn't use cream to make the sauce, plain old milk works fine. These are so good, I'm debating making them again for dinner!

I am not sure if I did something wrong but my cheese sauce turned out very thick and sticky.  I had to add milk to make it "sauce".  Other than that this was very good.  I would make this one again.
