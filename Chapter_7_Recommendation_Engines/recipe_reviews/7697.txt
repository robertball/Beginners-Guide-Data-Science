The main reason I am giving this recipe only four stars is I don't think the rose flavor is strong enough & the almond is a bit overpowering. I did make some changes to the recipe.  First, I baked it in the Pampered Chef silicone flower cupcake pan. Next, I added a half teaspoon more rose water to the batter & frosted the cupcakes with a powdered sugar glaze with rose water & a few drops of red food color to make it pink. They were really pretty I would be great to serve at a bridal or baby shower. I think the main change I would make next time is to use rose extract rather than rose water.

This was very nice!  I made this for Ramadan soohoor (the meal eaten at ramadan just before fasting begins) and was delighted.  Be careful not to overbeat...I made this mistake and it resulted in the bread being a bit tough but it was still delicious.  I omitted the almond extract because extracts contain alcohol.  I used two ounces of ground almonds. ( Just crunched up almond pieces while they were still in the bag)
Thanks for this recipe, a true blue keeper!

Excellent. I loved it. Great new taste. Very nice with tea. I would use a little more rose water because I think the taste was very subtle and I love the flavor combination with almond extract. Also the pink color was very light I may use a few more drops next time to really  bring out the color. It's easy and very delicious and did not last long. I will certainly make this again.

hello from cairo, yes this cake is verry authentic, however, rose water is neither sweet nor coloured, just verry delicatly flavoured,rose syrup is sweet and coloured, and rose essence is a concentrated version of rose water of which only a few drops are required for beautiful results, keep that in mind next time u go to a middle eastern grocery

I don't know how better to put this than to say that this is a sweetheart of a cake.  So pretty and pastel pink!  Very interesting flavors of both almond and rose water in the two batters, and both pleasantly delicate.  A humble but classy cake that would have been very good on its own, but was even better topped with Strawberry Rhubarb Sauce, also from this site.

An excellent recipe when you want something different for your guests or family.  You can also substitute a couple drops of grenadine for the rosewater one, if you want to stay away from artificial coloring... It may add a subtle change to flavoring, but its nice.  Same thing for the orangewater one, substitute orange juice for the coloring...

these were amazing. i used a teacake pan and made pink tinted teacakes which i then iced with a mixture of confectioners sugar, milk, pink food dye, and equal parts rose and almond extracts. my boyfriend, who thinks 'flowers are for smelling, not eating', made a point of telling me they were odd every time he ate one - yet he still ate about 10 and finally admitted they were amazing. i used rose extract instead of rosewater (which has a much stronger flavor) and used a little bit more than the full tsp anyway. i kept the almond extract and almonds the same, but ground the almonds in a food processor to make them really really fine. the results were absolutely delicious. perfect almond to rose ratio.

I really enjoyed this treat! I make them as muffins. My husband likes them because they aren't too sweet and have a hint of rose flavor to them.

I find the almond extract to be too over powering.  I substituted amaretto for the
extract and everyone enjoyed it.

It seems to be something that adults like more than children.  Perfect for a bridal shower.

I made this cake for a bridal shower.  It went over very well.  With the mix of white and pink.  My six year old daughter was in charge of the pink.  So my daughter was thrilled to say to everyone that she helped make it and went in to detail of process.  I would make this again for any get together.

My whole family loved this cake. Both the rosewater and orangewater verions are excellent. My daughter likes it with a bit of fruit cocktail on top of it, but it can easily stand alone. Terrific!

Loved this!  I have made these several times.  I like to make them in a mini muffin tin, they look so pretty on a tray.  Also, I make a simple syrup with a tablespoon of rose water and juice from half a lemon.  I quickly dip the cakes.  They completely melt in your mouth...

I couldn't resist going out to buy the same pan as chikalin and making this recipe into tiny tea cakes.  The batter behaved beautifully (sprayed the pans, floured, baked 350 for 10-12 mins) and everyone oohed and aaahed over the results. The rosewater flavor is fairly light - even thought I doubled the amount  and used closer to 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract based on the other reviewers suggestions.  I think it could benefit with a tiny dallop of rosewater scented whipped cream on top - it felt like it needed a little something, but nothing overpowering.  They were delicious, not overly sweet and a enjoyed by many at a harem themed party I hosted. Thank you!

This is a very unique flavored cake. But that being said it is in all essence a compliment to the dish because the ingredients are amazingly perfect together! Thank you.
