This recipe had my curiosity peaked.  I really liked the coffee flavors with the chocolate.  It was an even balance of the two.  I think 20 minutes total cooking time was way too much.  I took mine out of the oven 3 minutes early since it started to smell like it was burning.  I served it over vanilla Greek yogurt.
