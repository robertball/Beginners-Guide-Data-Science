Made this tonight for our family and guests. It turned out very very good. However upon reading previous review of it being bland before adding cheese sauce I put salt and pepper on the onions and then after I put the cheese sauce and paprika on I sprinkled chives on the top. I will probably make double the cheese sauce next time just to add more substance. Not using as many onions next time (I don't have a food scale so I over guesstimated the 3 lbs of onions) this is a very good side dish!!!

It's hard to make a meal taste well when it's made mostly of onions. Considering that it tastes pretty good. The cheese topping is especially good.

1.2.16   I read the reviews, some people liked it, others not so much.  First tip, you DEFINITELY need some salt and pepper, otherwise, this WILL be bland.  Next, do one of two things:  either make more sauce or slice fewer onions.  I weighed my onions, and I could tell after boiling them that I was not going to have enough sauce.  I made a little more sauce, but not enough.  Instead of arranging the onions in the dish, and topping with the cheese sauce, I mixed the onions into the sauce.  But not all of them, I simply still had too many onions for the amount of sauce.  We love onions, but don’t make this recipe if you’re not a fan, that makes no sense.  IT. IS. ONIONS, and a lot of them. Also, IMO as a side dish, this recipe will make about 8 servings, not 5.  This was a different  twist on a creamy, cheesy side dish, and although it needs a little tweaking,  we enjoyed it.

I love this simple dish. Someone in my family used to make this when I was a child. I never thought I would find the recipe. Perfect and quick side dish. Thank you for sharing
