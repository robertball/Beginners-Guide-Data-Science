My first time making this and I’ll  make it again. I used a mesquite flavour,  I’ll use a hickory flavour next time, not a fan of the mesquite flavour. Plus I added a little salt to the mixture.

Changes I made to the procedure... 
1. Coat  the cutting board with the seasoning/mixture.
2. Soak the paper.
3. Lay the paper on the coated cutting board.
4. Put a coating of seasoning mixture on the paper.
5. Cut the paper in 1 1/2 inch strips.
6. Lay on parchment covered cookie sheet.
7. Crinkle the strip before baking to get a more authentic looking “bacon”. 
8. Bake at 400 for about 6-7 minutes. Keep checking after 6 minutes.

So curiosity got the best of me. We have been looking for alternatives as we cross into pescatarian. This is one I will have to play with to get the seasoning just right. My husband enjoyed it while I think the spices aren't just right. The one thing I will note is I baked it at 400 for 6 mins and it came out burnt. So I lowered the temp to 350 and baked for 10 mins and it came out perfectly baked. All ovens are different, just keep that in mind. Overall this is one I will play with and perfect to my taste. Thanks for sharing!!
