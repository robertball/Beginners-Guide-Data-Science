This was a fun way to kick off the memorial day weekend! I put the ice in dixie cups and poured this overall. Make sure your ice is mashed/crushed well b/c the first couple snow cones we made, it all sunk to the bottom, like a glass of kool-ade BUT the rest turned out fine. Not "exactly" like county fair snow cones b/c those seem more syrupy while this was a little watery but close enough and they're fun to make! Thanks Connie!

Easy and economical to prepare. I like the fact that you have more flavors to choose from rather than purchasing the usual snow cone syrup flavor. Cheaper too. I put the syrups in some cheap mustard and ketchup bottles I found at Walmart (plastic, like at a diner). Works great.

Sorry but this needs some sugar.  It is too watery.  I like the snow cone syrup II from this site alot better.

I am so glad I found this.  I could never find snow cone topping at the store after I bought a snow cone machine, and now I can have one any time I want one....

Our grand daughter wanted to make snow cones this weekend so I thought I would give this a try before she brought over her snow cone making machine. This is not a thick syrup but the flavor is there and no doubt a lot less sugar. Can't wait to try different flavors with her including sugar free and she what she thinks.
