I used a combo of ground beef and hot sausage for the meatballs and tossed them in air fryer at 350 for 10 min. Delicious- my family loved them! The sauce was very bland as written. I tossed in fettuccine noodles into the sauce as opposed to serving with mashed potatoes. Definitely cut the flour to 1/4 cup or double the sauce recipe if you prefer the dish to be more saucy. I will make again but would need to add different seasonings to the sauce.

These are good. The sauce thickens, a lot. Next time, Iâ€™ll cut in half the amount of flour.
