I used the extra sugar instead of the almonds. I also substituted 3 tablespoons of lemon juice for the lemon zest. The cookies turned out great! Not too lemony and very dainty. Cool for at least 2 or 3 minutes before removing.

These were great, I added 3 tablespoons of fresh squeezed lemon juice to the dough and dipped the balls in juice then sugar to enhance the lemon flavor.  I also dusted with powerdered sugar to make it more like a lemon bar cookie.

I gave this 4 stars as is; however, I have made some changes that I think solves the problem many reviewers have mentioned about the cookie not being lemony enough.  Instead of adding lemon juice, I used   2-1/2 tablespoons of frozen lemonade concentrate and I think it is lemony enough.  I also used 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract instead of the vanilla extract and I added a couple more tablespoons of flour.  Then I chilled my dough for about 45 minutes before baking.  If you want the cookies to be fancy looking, you can roll the dough into 1 inch balls;  then flatten the balls to about 1/4 inch thick using the bottom of a glass that has been moistened and dipped in granulated sugar.  Lastly, used almond slices that are not broken and arrange three almond slices like spokes on a wheel and press them in slightly.  This makes them look elegant.  Oh, and I also chilled the cookies for about 10 minutes right before putting them in the oven.  That part may not be necessary, but I thought it would keep them from flattening out too much.  I only baked mine for 8 minutes.

I think I just found my new favorite cookie! I doubled the recipe and used one whole lemon (juice and zest without measuring). It came out tasting deliciously light and fluffy with just enough lemon flavor. I'm definitely making this one again, thanx Jennifer!

This is the perfect lemon cookie - everything the previous reviewers promised:  crunchy and chewy.  The only thing I'll do differently next time is double the recipe.  I didn't notice until after I had mixed the batter that it is on the small side, so I found myself rationing the cookies instead of having plenty.

I've made these cookies exactly as per recipe and they were really nice. Then one day I thought why not, and reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup, added 1/2 cup chopped cranberries, 1 tsp lime juice, upped the baking powder to 1 tsp and baking soda to 1/2 tsp. I baked them in tiny paper cups for 17 mins. They tasted very very good. To pass the acid test, I made these lemony cupcakes for tea with a bunch of discerning ladies but this time I topped them with cream cheese and a frosted cranberry which I also got from AllRecipes. Those baby cupcakes looked so pretty! My goodness, the ladies were fighting over the last few cakes. But they were all my good friends so we had a really good time with me handing out the recipe like favours!

These were alright. They had a wonderful texture. I added extra lemon juice to try to get a much lemon flavor possible. But when they came out, they sorta tasted like air,.... They had no lemon flavor what so ever to me. However my mom said she could taste the lemon. I made a lemon glaze and put over the cookies and they were AMAZING!!! So if they were more lemony, or you already had the glaze with them, they would certainly be 5 stars.

Delightful cookies. Crisp and chewy as promised with wonderful lemon flavor. Best eaten quickly and not stored - I found they lost their crispness quite quickly and went very soft.

Excellent! Hubby and kids loved them, so I am making them again. I do recommend doubling or tripling the recipe as they go fast. Crispy outside and chewy inside, as promised. Thank you Jennifer.

Puffs of lemon-aire! Following the advice of many former reviewers, I too used 3T lemon juice and rolled the balls in confectioner's sugar prior to baking. Yummo! This will definitely be a summertime staple in our cookie jar this year! Thanks Jennifer!

This is  exactly the kind of lemon cookie I love...crisp & chewy!! I made 8 dozen (whew) for Chriastmas giving and I know everyone will love these cookies. And, with so many recipes to choose from, I sure got lucky with this one. Nothing bad to say here.

Wonderful lemon cookie! I used the juice of two lemons to try to achieve a real lemon flavor. It was a sticky dough so I let it set up in the fridge for a bit before I rolled into balls. I gently set the almonds on top of each ball and then sprinkled with a bit of sugar. They turned out beautiful and tasted great!

Very tasty. I followed the recipe, except to double batch. The zest and juice of one lemon per batch worked well. Yummy and great with tea. :)

If you're looking for a really lemony cookie, this isn't it. I don't care for lemon zest, so I added about 1.5 - 2 tsp. lemon extract, and 2 drops of yellow food coloring. The texture was exactly as stated, "a chewy cookie with a nice crisp brown edge". But a good lemony taste just wasn't there. I doubled the batch as others suggested, but my cookie-eating family ignored these.  Sorry.

These cookies were Fabulous!!!  I decided to make them for a Christmas Cookie exchange, since they are different.  I love that they are chewy with a cookie crunch.  I would advise under baking them rather than waiting for the brown edge to show.  They stay chewier that way.  YUMMY!

All you have to do is add a little more lemon (zest AND juice) and these cookies taste awesome!  These are by far the best lemon cookies I've ever had.  Two thumbs up.

I'm rating this as a 4 star. while I love the taste of the cookie I did not like how flat they turned out.  I also doubled the recipe and only ended up with 24 cookies so not sure how I single batch could make 2 dozen.  Nice cookie, but not sure its something I will bake again.

I really liked these cookies and so did everyone that ate them! I made it with the same ingredients except I used lime instead of lemon...I love them both but was in the mood for lime :) Also, I noted that some reviewers said that the lemon flavor was a little weak so I added another 1/2 Tbsp of zest and the flavor was great!
My cookies didn't come out very chewy though, more like chewy fluffy sugar cookies. When I made them I wasn't ready to bake them right away so I put the dough in the fridge. When I took it out, I rolled it into a log and cut off between 1/4 and 1/2 inch thick cookies and baked them like that. So if you like fluffier cookies, bake them like this :)

really really good cookies.  i would recommend making a double batch, since it didnt make very many cookies. also, when you take them out of the oven, dont leave them on the cookie sheet for too long or they will stick.

Cookies were marvelous. I doubled the recipe as many suggested and have plenty left over. I also added an extra 2 tablespoon of lemon juice since I wanted them lemony. Amazing! Was thinking of dipping half in white chocolate. Mmmmmmm :p

A sweet cookie, lemony without being overly so. Best when warm out of the oven, as they are soft and light then. I sprinkled mine with sugar and a little bit of extra lemon juice, instead of using the almonds, and they came out delicious. Just be careful to space the cookies out well, as they do expand quite a bit more than anticipated. Will definitely make again.

These came out really great. My husband is a huge lemon fan and he gave rave reviews. All I did differently was substitute the butter for canola oil as I don't like to bake with butter.

This recipe is AMAZING!!!My whole family loved this recipe and that is amazing on its own. My parents don't like alot of sugar and even they said the cookies were delicious. I definetly would recommend these. I might even make them again.

*** For more lemon flavor, add an extra teaspoon of lemon juice and a little more lemon zest!

Fantastic!  I doubled the recipe and added toasted shredded coconut (just because I had some that I wanted to use, and thought coconut and lemon are a good combination).  I did not use almonds, but topped the cookies with sugar instead.  I got very good results!

this recipe was good.  i added a few white chocolate chips to it.  the cookies didn't taste really lemony when they first came out of the oven, but after a day or so, the lemon flavor came out more.  i followed the other reviews, and added lemon zest and juice from lemons.  The only real problem was that the dough was REALLY sticky, even after i had refrigerated it for a few hours.  So it was really hard to get it off and on to the cookie sheet.  But overall it was a very good cookie, and good to add to the typical cookie rotation of chocolate chip and PB! thanks for the recipe!

following the recipe as is and its kind of a mess - very sticky dough that still behaved poorly after refrigeration.  spreads out a lot during baking.  i just can't justify the the work of this recipe for the results of the cookie.  i was really hopeful as i was looking forward to a lemon-flavored cookie to put out with my others during the holidays, but this doesn't cut it.  the dough is still sitting in my refrigerator a week later - I only bake one dozen and quit.

This recipe is very good.  I made one batch with the almonds and decided I didnt care for them.  I just made these plain.  I added extra lemon zest after the first batch also because the lemon taste was very faint.  The more zest the better in my opinion.

I'm not sure if I did something wrong, because everyone else seemed to enjoy these cookies, but mine stuck to the pan really bad until I greased it. They tasted okay, not the best lemon cookies we've ever had.

Perfect and very tender cookies.  Definitely not overwhelming lemon flavor.  My recipe turned out 18 cookies- I guess I was a little generous with my rounded teaspoons, but they were perfectly done in 10 minutes.  Great recipe!

Super easy and delicious lemon flavor.  I did not add the extra sugar and almonds and they were great.  Simple flavors.  The recipe says it makes 2 dozen but I used a cookie scoop and only got 15 cookies. For my next batch, I doubled the recipe.

These cookies are delicious! I doubled the recipe, and even added an extra tablespoon of lemon juice. I chilled the dough, and rolled it into balls which I then rolled in sugar. My only issue is they stuck to my pans a little bit, so after a couple of rounds in the oven I started using my "Bakers Joy" spray and they came out perfectly!

I really enjoy these cookies!!!  I added extra lemon juice (from one lemon) because of other reviews stating it was not super lemony.  I also added sugar and almonds to the top of the cookies.  My fiance loves them cause they are actually soft on the inside :) and I love them cause they have a crunch on the outside of them!  Baked cookies for about 10 minutes.

A lot more buttery and less lemony than I might prefer but still very, very tasty and with an incredible texture! 8 minutes was the correct amount of time for my oven. Next time I might try using some lemon extract. Will definitely bake again!

Excellent recipe. I like things especially lemony, so I used the zest from one lemon and the juice of one lemon. Very tasty cookies.

These were sooo tasty!  I did opt out of the almonds and used a lemon glaze which made these AMAZING!  Also, I used Fleischmann's Margarine over butter so they were more like the Archway soft lemon cookie. Highly recommend this recipe

These were great! The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is that by the end of the second day they had dried out and were crumbly. They still tasted great though. I doubled the recipe and  couldn't get enough zest, I even zested 2 lemons and only needed the zest of 1/2. So I added a little lemon extract with the vanilla. I like them really lemmony!

These were AMAZING! I was a little more free with my lemon zest and lemon juice to get the most lemony tang possible and they came out GREAT. The cookies had a nice crisp out side and a soft, delicious inside. After cooling for a while, I glazed with the some lemon juice mixed in icing sugar. I didn't add any almonds this time, but I'm sure that would have been lovely too.

These were soo good, I'm actually made another batch as soon as the first came out. I did change the recipe just a little, I used 1 tsp lemon extract instead of zest and 1 TBS of lemon juice. I also used almond extract instead of vanilla. Really came out great! I suggest taking the cookies out before the brown on the outsides, they stay really soft that way!!

Not enough of a lemon kick. If you increase the lemon juice you lose the wonderfully chewy and crunchy texture and get a cakey cookie instead. This is good if you only want a hint of lemon, but it wasn't enough for me. It turned out more like a sugar cookie with a bit of lemon instead.

These are the best and so easy!! I have made them twice now and they have become a family favorite.  Our lemon tree is out of control right now, so I used alot more zest and lemon juice the 2nd time, and it is fantastic.  Just zested the entire lemon and used the entire lemon juice.  Then I made sugar lemon (thinly sliced lemons simmered in 1/4 cup water & 1/4 cup sugar for 15 minutes.  Put 1/2 a lemon on the cookies when they was still hot.  Very lemony and very delicious.

I enjoyed these cookies and added an extra tablespoon of fresh lemon juice and sprinkled sugar over the almonds yum! Keep an eye on them because they will brown fast towards the end of the baking cycle, I pulled them out at 8 min. Enjoy!

my cookies stuck to the teflon cookie sheet and were not that lemony, although for additional taste i added extra lemon and topped the cookies with sugar. I found the cookies dry, you could easily need a glass of milk or water.

These were very good.  I used chopped pine nuts instead of almonds and thought they turned out great!  Next time I will definitely double the batch, though, because this recipe did NOT make very many cookies!  My husband and I loved the thin, chewy-crisp texture.

These are fabulous cookies, and are also great made with either orange or lime in place of the lemon.  They freeze wonderfully - I made60 dozen for a Christmas party last year, and after thawing they were as good as fresh-baked!

These were very good, but not very lemon-y.  I plan to make them again, but add more lemon next time as some of the reviewers suggested.  Also, I'll double the recipe because they disappeared so quickly!  Thanks for sharing!

Absolutely wonderful !  I am not a fan on "lemon anything" really, but my son and daughterinlaw are, so I made these as a treat so to speak and I ended up saying "no, this last one is mine"  !!  I added instead of walnuts, pecan nuts - awesome!

After reading the reviews, I increased the l.j. to l Tbsp. Also used l l/4 c. whole wheat pastry flour for white flour.Rolled each cookie into chopped black walnuts and flattened w/fingers. Spread to 3" cookie when baked that made a crisp cookie! EXCEllENT and will make many times! Love this site!

Excellent! These are by far the best lemon cookies ever. I made a few changes as I didn't have almonds. I put powdered sugar on the first dozen and then chopped pecans on the second dozen. Also, instead of vanilla extract, I used lemon extract. They turned out great. Not puckery, just good lemon flavor. I will absolutly make these again.

These are great! Very light and crispy cookies. However, I didn't think they had enough of a lemon kick (and I used the full tbsp of lemon zest and actually added an extra 1/2 tsp of lemon juice). Next time I'll try adding more lemon.

Also, I glazed these with a mix of confectioners sugar and lemon juice. They gave these cookies a nice extra kick.

I read the reviews and made the recipe as instructed except put in 2 Tablespoons of Lemon Juice and rolled the uncooked dough in powdered sugar. Make sure to mix all dry ingredients separately then add to butter, sugar, egg mixture.  

I used a melon baller to have consist round balls.  Recommend using parchment paper or silicone mat to prevent cookies from browning too much.  I bake a lot and these cookies definitely needed more lemon.  Lack of lemon was disappointing as I could barely tell there was lemon in the cookie.  The texture was nice, soft and chewy.  Had a sugar buttery flavor.  A bit sweet.  The recipe only makes about 18 cookies using a 1" melon baller.

excellent light cookie. I would double the batch for next time. it made about 2 dozen but i know they'll be gone quickly. They do spread a good bit so leave enough space between them when you bake.

I did not have almonds or regular flour, so I added a little bit extra sugar and used whole wheat flour. I also baked them on my stoneware cookie sheet from Pampered Chef and went the full 12 minutes! They are delicious and I will be serving them at an event tonight.

The lemon flavor is perfect. The cookie is light and chewy.  If not lemony enough for your taste, a lemon glaze can be added as well.  
Not only that, the base recipe can be altered to accept other flavor variations. This one has become my go to for experimenting with other flavors.

I didn't have enough zest so I added a tablespoon extra of lemon juice. I made a light lemon drizzle icing. The cookies were a hit! I have given a 5 star but next time I will have enough zest and see if that makes a difference.

Very easy, very flavorful cookie recipe. I used a splash of lemon extract instead of zest, and I baked them in the convection oven at 325 for 14 min. They were not as brown and were perfectly chewy.

The cookie is delicious, just not very lemony, I am a lemon lover.  I used more zest and twice as much lemon juice as recipe states and still not much lemon taste.  I rolled dough in sugar and flattened out second batch to get that thin crispy edge.  I rolled the first batch in sugar as well, I just didn't flatten.  Still delicious, but high snd thick.  I prefer thin and crispy for this cookie.  The cookies were delicious paired with my super tangy lemon lime ice cream.  I am going to think of ways to improve this recipe.

Made some today.  Needed two lemons to get enough zest but only needed one lemon for the juice. I increased the juice to the whole lemon which turned out to be 3 Tbs as suggested by some. Good lemon flavour, it made 23 cookies.

Easy and delicious! I rolled them into the sugar then baked. Definitely double the recipe because it just barely makes 2 dozen. I'd rate the lemon flavor as delicate. If you want an overly lemon cookie, you'll need to add extract or something. 
I will definitely  make these again! Thank you for a great recipe.

I made these and they were super yummy! I thoroughly enjoyed them and so did my family. I did have to add extra lemon zest as the batter did not have enough lemon, but after that it hit the spot.

This recipe was excellent--light and not too sweet. However, after reading the reviews that said the cookies weren't lemony, I made one change. Rather than just add extra lemon juice and possibly mess up the consistency, I added about a teaspoon of lemon extract along with the zest and juice of one lemon. They're just wow, the lemon flavor sparkles and the almonds provide a pleasant contrast. Wonderful.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because I was hoping for a lemon *ka-boom*.  Even after doubling the lemon zest and juice, and adding fresh lemon zest to the sugar on top, there was still no ka-boom; although it was a somewhat lemony cookie with great texture.  Hubby thought they were an exceptionally good lemon flavor.

The dough was terribly sticky but I wouldn't add additional flour because the baked texture of the cookies is perfect as it is.  Cool water on the hands while rolling out the balls takes care of that problem.   

This would probably be a good basic recipe for other citrus-flavored cookies.  I'm going to try lime the next time.

I don't know about these.....I don't know if I did something wrong or what, but these came out flat and really no flavor, no depth. I won't make these again.

This is a lovely light cookie.  Lemon was not a primary taste, but the texture was very nice.  Used a heavy cookie sheet with a silpat  and cooked for 15 minutes to get crisp edges.

I like simple and easy to make cookies.  This recipe fell  into both categories.  I don't like altering recipes when I make something for the first time.  This one turned out great other than making 18 cookies.  As a few reviewers said, I will double the batch  when I make it in the future.

Only three stars because they turned out very flat. I added another 1/4 c if flour which helped hold their shape, but it was only for the remaining dough. Taste is really good, I would make them again and like others omit the zest and add concentrated lemon juice for a bit more lemon taste.  I used turbinado (raw sugar) sugar sprinkled on top.

The texture is perfect...crunchy edges with chewy middle. I like a little more lemon flavor, so will try upping the lemon zest & juice next time {cause there will definitely be a next time :-)} I also appreciate that this is a small batch... being single, it can be dangerous to have a large batch of cookies in the house :-)

I love this recipe but honestly because it is a guide. After an attempt at this recipe, I played around with it. My most successful attempt was when I added a bit more ginger to fit my palate. It was alright without it, but I love the spiciness of ginger and it was drowned out in the original recipe. Also if you do not have fresh lemons, lemon extract is a decent substitute. I used half a teaspoon due to the fact I don't like the taste of extracts. It doesn't taste nearly good, but you get a subtle lemon flavor.

These are like a buttery lemon sugar cookie. They are great made just as recipe states. For my liking I will double the zest next time. I prefer a strong lemony flavor. I used a lemon sugar on top that is for the adult beverage lemon drops.   I would double the recipe as well.

Just made these lemon cookies and they are delightful.  Easy to make and delicious.  They turned out perfectly?  I cut down the vanilla to half a tsp and added two tbls lemon juice.Recipe yields just enough for my husband and me.  It wouldn’t be hard to double or triple recipe.  I too will be making these as a gift or for dinner with friends.  I prefer baking something instead of a bought prepared gift.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I goofed and added the almonds to the batter.  They still came out delicious!  Added a little extra lemon juice and zest, I love lemon flavor.  Since the almonds were in the cookies instead of on top, I dusted them with powdered sugar.  Crispy and chewy deliciousness.

These are lovely cookies, nice and delicate. I doubled the recipe, since I don't think it's worth the trouble to make so few cookies. Double batch makes 4-5 dozen. I made only slight adjustments to the flavorings based on reviews here. I used the zest and juice of one large lemon (about 1T zest and 1/4 cup of juice) and decreased the vanilla to 1/2 teaspoon for a double batch. Very lemony without being overpowering. I did have to bake them 14-16 minutes but that's probably my oven and not the recipe.

It's a great cookie although my first batch tasted nothing like lemons. A friend thought it was a butter cookie but loved that it was crunchy.  In my second batch I replaced the vanilla extract with more lemon juice. They have a very slight taste of lemon.

made exactly to directions, but we did not like these.  First, they are cake like, not "cookie like" and they did not taste of lemon.  Only after I told them lemon, they said, "Oh, yea, I guess".  I tried adding a teaspoon lemon extract to the uncooked dough after the first batch, but there really wasn't any improvement.

Loved this recipe!  I had to use bottled lemon juice and skip the zest.  The lemon taste was perfect.  I also forgot to sprinkle the sugar or almonds on top, but it didn't matter.  The whole family loved them and they weren't overwhelmingly sweet like some cookies.

I was looking for a cookie recipe to use lemons from my Dad's trees.  I've made these three times now for different groups of people.  A hit every time - so light and delicate.  Once I used the sugar the next two times I added the almonds.  Some I frost with a little lemon glaze and some I leave unglazed.  Served alone or with a dish of fresh berries and/or ice cream.  Delicious.

I cut some of the sugar out, and also used brown sugar.  Then I subbed the flour for gluten free flour.  These came out awesomely!  Since the cookies came out dome-shaped, I was able to dip the tops perfectly into the lemon glaze I made(almond milk, confectioners sugar, lemon juice, lemon zest, and vanilla extract) .  Next time I will flatten them out more.

Terrible cookes, not chewy at all.
Dry and chalky. Had to throw them away... Where is the chewy component, they were dry even before baking. Followed the recipe exaclty. They must need more fluid?

I added and extra 1/4 cup of butter in the first step. At the end I added 2 tablespoons of water since I used the whole egg and added and extra 1/2 cup of sugar since I didn't have the almonds. I wanted the cookies to come out really thin and more on the crispy side instead of cake like. They melt like butter in your mouth. I baked them 13-14 minutes at the suggested temp. They came out excellent, because 2/3's of them are gone.

I thought this was an excellent recipe although I did make a few changes…nothing outstanding but I wanted a real punch of lemon so I used the zest of four large lemons and next time I might even use more. Instead of the vanilla I used Pure Lemon Extract. I think I might have mixed them a bit longer than the recipe stated (just until mixed) and so mine were cakey and delicate rather than chewy and crispy and but I liked it. Next time I will definitely mix them less so I can compare the two textures. I tripled the recipe and next time will quadruple it. The dough definitely needs to be well chilled in order to handle easily.
Second time of making them: this recipe, although very good, is labour intensive due to zesting and juicing of the lemons. I really do believe that tripling or even quadrupling the lemon zest is needed for our family’s taste buds. I wonder if the additional zest is what actually makes the cookies cakey instead of crispy, although I don’t mind a cakey texture. Just be aware that additional zest might be what changes the texture. For us, it’s worth it to get the additional lemon flavour.

these cookies had a great flavor but they stuck to the pan. I know it was probably just me and I would love to know what I could do to not let this happen again. Very soft and flavorful

These cookies were very good, pretty much what I was looking for.  I did follow the recipe (went back and checked, lol) but my cookies did not flatten, I have no idea why.  I would make these again.  Thanks

These are very easy and quick to make.  I used lemon extract instead of vanilla, and added about 1 tsp dry lemon zest (I have a lemon tree, and I dry my own).  I did not add the extra sugar or almonds, and they are quite refreshing!

Wonderful recipe.  I substituted orange for the lemon and added extra zest & juice.  Can't wait to try with lemon too.   Amazing!

i really like the chewy, crispy texture of these. i can't imagine not finding them lemony enough -- it's the lemon zest that does it, so if you leave it out, don't be surprised if the flavour is milder. i added cranberries and managed to forget the egg, but they still came out great!

I had no lemons so I used lime, and they tasted amazing.  Good recipe. The only problem I have with them is that they're a little thin. I made 3 different batches on different days with different temperature butter and it seems they all turned out thin.  Nicely Done, though. A+

i asked my 7&9 year old what to rate this cookie and they chimed together give it a 5... we totally enjoyed this cookie. I let my 7 year old do most of the mixing, an i let her  put  them on the cookie sheet... so they had a fluff in the middle like a pillow and a light crisp edge DELICIOUS WITH MY COFFEE... I WANT TO EAT THEM ALL..the only alteration was adding more lemon... just guesstamating.. juice and zest... no measuring

Wow! Best lemon cookie recipe to date! I put in 2 tablespoons of lemon juice by accident, and the lemon flavor came through strong, but not overpowering. Sweet, crispy on outside, chewy inside, and the perfect amount of lemon.

Did not use nuts (bf cannot have them) or top with sugar (save on calories).  Felt something was missing - needs the nuts, sugar or some kind of icing to be 5 star.  Liked size of batter and easy prep.

Trying this recipe again after a year and living in a diff place. Recipe is really tasty, just not lemony enough. I adjusted the recipe by adding juice of 1 1/2 lemons, extra vanilla and sprinkled cinnamon & sugar over the top. Next time I will add 2 whole lemons...tasty

I love this recipe. I'm not the best baker, and even I was able to turn out a great batch of cookies. For those of you who like a more lemony flavor change the amount of lemon juice to 2 tsp.

SO good!  I omitted the almonds and added a tiny bit more sugar (less than 1/4 cup).  My husband ate 6 when he came home and I am the one who loves lemon!  Can't wait to make these again!!!

This cookie wasn't lemony enough for us. It tasted like a sugar cookie with a light hint of lemon. We did like that it was crispy on the edges and chewy in the center.

These are awesome! I added almost 2 tbsp of lemon juice and next time will add more (or more zest) to up the lemon flavor. Mine came out very cake-like but I mixed extra on purpose since I prefer a cake-like cookie. I also substitued butter for margarine because of the saturated fat. Very light. Delicious!

The name says it all. They are good hot out of the oven, or out of the fridge. My DH likes soft cookies, so I tried to bake them less, but it didn't work - they looked done until they cooled, but they were still doughy. I just used the zest and juice of one large lemon, and they were delicious. Not the lemony zip from a lemon bar, but nice subtle, refreshing lemon flavor.

These were absolutely delicious. I doubled the recipe without any hitches and the bf named these as his most favorite cookie of all time. They were light, mouth-watering, with just the perfect amount of crisp. Next time, I may add a little more lemon zest just because I like a little more lemon flavor, but the recipe is excellent as written as well.

Simply put - my new favorite cookie recipe!

I doubled the zest and the lemon juice as other reviewers had suggested and the cookies came out extremely lemony.  I wish I had doubled the recipe though! Using a 1/8th cup measure for the dough, I wound up with 17 cookies.  I wish I hadn't told my boyfriend I was making these.

Thanks so much for this AWESOME recipe!

These are ok.  They are more light and cake like (not necessarily a bad thing), but I doubled the lemon juice and zest and they still aren't very lemony.

Loved 'em. We rolled them in powdered sugar before putting them on the baking sheet after the first batch and it significantly brought out more lemon flavor. Also, as others have pointed out, increase the recipe, you'll need as many as you have patience to bake.

AWESOMELY delicious,  I added a bit more lemon then called for and used sugar instead of almonds.  they came out perfect.  I had wondered what it meant by chewy crisps, but its neat, these really come out chewy and crispy. my very picky husband even loved them.

These turned out really yummy :)
My kids loved them. Instead of lemon juice, I added lemon flavoring, and it really brought out the flavor. I didn't have any almonds, so I also left those out and covered them in powdered sugar. Fantastic!!

These were tasty but mine came out very flat and were better described as just crisps.  Good lemon flavor though and pretty, almost like lace cookies (my dough was very sticky and thing, because I must have added too much extra lemon juice).

I just finished baking these cookies and I am not sure what I did wrong.  They did not come out chewy and crisp.  They were very cake-like, soft and falling apart. :-(  Despite that they were rather tasty so I'll probably try this recipe again using my favourite sugar cookie recipe adding in the lemon zest and juice and sprinkling it with almonds.

I would call this a sugar cookie with a hint of lemon.  It was good, but in the future I will look for ways to boost the lemony goodness (ie extract, glaze, etc).  Mine didn't flatten out to form a crisp edge, but that may be my fault somehow.

I followed suggestions to increase lemon zest and lemon juice and change vanilla extract to lemon.  Used a lemon juice/confec. sugar glaze on mine, topped with an almond slice.  Great cookie.  Will definitely make these again.  Hubby loves them too!

Delicious, light, thin, lemon cookies.  Refreshing!  I reduced the heat a tad, because the edges tended to burn.

The cookies came out pretty good.  All I added was half a teaspoon lemon essence.  I think it gave it more of lemon flavour.  And added about half the amount of the almonds in the batter and sprinkled the rest on top.  Thanks for sharing;-)

YUMMY.  I don't like almonds so I used the extra sugar.  I also didn't have a lemon so I used 4T of lemon juice as another user suggested.  I made larger cookies-got 13 total-baked only for 12 minutes, and they are so soft and chewy.  Perfect lemon flavor.  The only thing I might try is sprinkling sugar over them for some extra sweetness.  This recipe is going to be made many times, probably again tonight!  I might add extra vanilla and omit the lemon juice for those in my family who don't like lemon.  they are missing out.

These cookies were fantastic!  I baked them early this afternoon and I'm having a hard time staying away from the cookie jar until the kids get home.  This one is going at the top of the recipe list.  Thanks Jennifer for submitting the recipe.

I took these cookies to a church youth group and they were gone within 7 minutes! Also, I brought one to my friend and he said "Why'd you only bring one, these rock!". They had great flavor and they were chewey on the inside. I also didn't use the almonds and added the noted amount of sugar instead. RECOMMENDED!!!!!

Just the recipe I was looking for.  Light, "lemony", and not too sweet.  Plus very soft!  Will definitely keep this one and make again!

My only complaint about these cookies is that the lemon flavor is not strong enough.
