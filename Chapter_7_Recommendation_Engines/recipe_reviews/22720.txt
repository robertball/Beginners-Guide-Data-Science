I love this recipe!  It's got a surprising amount of flavor that is quite interesting.  However, I realized last night, that the difference between what I'm eating and what other raters might be eating is that I am using smokey cheddar cheese.  That with a little salt and pepper is just fantastic.  I also am using fresh broccoli.  My fiance likes softer veggies so I steamed his broccoli and onions before baking since I like things a bit crunchier.  Didn't matter, it was all soft last night.  Another difference, though, and the one I attribute the softer broccoli and onions to, is that I doubled the bisquit mix, milk and eggs.  It was a perfect amount of pie.  Next time, I am going to double all but add a tad more baking mix (instead of 1/2 cup I'll use 1 1/2 cups) than I used last night and then I think it will be right where I want it.  This is definitely a good recipe to start with, though, in my opinion.  We both have loved it each time it's been made.

I was really disappointed by this recipe.  It did not have much flavor.  My husband and I just couldn't eat it, and we love broccoli.

This tasted good...but there's too much milk in it. When I took it out of the oven, the pan tilted a little and milk came draining out of the top. I just tipped it over the sink and drained off the excess, but if I make it again, I would use probably half the milk called for. Sharp cheddar cheese was good in it.

Totally awesome side dish.  I used fresh, raw broccoli so it had a nice crunch to it and all of the nutrients. Could even become a main dish by adding chunks of browned, boneless chicken cubes on the bottom of the dish.

This was okay, but a little too soggy.  I probably won't make it again.

This is very good!  I added some parmesian garlic seasoning onto the broccoli and alittle more biscuit mix and it was great!  I'll definately be making this again!  The whole family loved it!

I thought this was good, despite the poor reviews I read.  I used steamed fresh broccoli, and an entire bunch of green onions.  I'm sure I'll make it again.

I've used allrecipes for a while now but this is the first review. My family is extremely difficult to please, but I've made this recipe a few times and it's one of the few recipes accepted (and liked!) by my family. So easy to make, too! : ) there's no way of messing it up

This did not turn out well. I had to bake it will over a hour and it was still soggy and the batter was still raw in the middle. I think if it would have browmed better I would have given this four stars. It tasted okay and my husband and I ate it anyway. However I do not think I will make this again.

love this!!! Had leftovers and reheated. Tasted just as good as the first day. Next time I may use some broccoli florets to give more texture. I also so used a Mexican cheese mix. Did not have the Bisquik so used pancake mix. If you want to add a little spice put in some hot sauce - yummy!

This recipe looked absolutely beautiful when I took it from the oven.  I was disappointed in the sauce.  It was very thin and milky instead of cheesy. It tasted good but was very bland.  I may try this again in a shallower casserole  dish and add a  little dry mustard and more cheese.

My family really liked this one.  I took the advice of some of the past reviews and changed a few things.  I used fresh broccoli and steamed it for 5 minutes first. I put about 1/2 c extra cheese because I love cheese.  I also added garlic powder and I used 1 1/2 cups mix and doubled up on milk and eggs.  it cooked perfectly at the same temp and time as noted. great for when you have extra broccoli laying around!

Made it twice, exactly as is (even used Gluten free Bisquick).  I loved it !  Second time I added some chopped ham, not that it needed something extra, I just wanted to use up what was in the fridge.

With a few modifications, which I will describe below, this was phenomenal! First, I added about a pound of skillet browned skinless chicken breast, which I seasoned with garlic pepper and garlic salt. I also did 1 c. Bisquick, 1 egg and 1 c. of milk, which I also seasoned with garlic salt. Adding the chicken, I considered this to be a full meal. Quick and easy.

I was really diappointed in this recipe because it didn't turn out how I expected.  The flavor wasn't there and I ended up having to throw it all away because no one was willing to eat it.

This was just okay.  Lots of broccoli, but not enough cheese for our taste.  And not very "pie" like.  Just not what I was expecting.
