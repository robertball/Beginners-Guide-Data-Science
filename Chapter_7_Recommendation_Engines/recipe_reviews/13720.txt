I thought this was really good.  It is the same basic recipe I've always used except for the cream of chicken soup.  It definately makes a difference for the better in terms of taste and texture.  I did not include chicken in mine so I used one can of chicken broth in place of the stock and I sauted the onion and celery in a bit of butter before addint to the mixture.  I will definately be using this recipe for dressing from now on.

This dressing recieved rave reviews from my in-laws.  All of them are fantastic Southern cooks and know how to throw a dressing together WITHOUT following a recipe.  My first try at this (Christmas dinner) was a big success! I substituted more cornbread (in total 3 boxes of Jiffy cornbread mix) instead of using biscuits.

Thanks for a great recipe!  This was so easy that even I got it right! Folks who normally won't eat dressing went back for seconds and there no leftovers.   A tip for those like me who need "paint by number" instructions... where the recipe says "soak" and doesn't say how much, I used 2.5 Cups.  And, one recipe (one pie tin) of cornbread was about 5 cups. Also, there are so many different types of "biscuits" from buttered to buttermilk... I used  a store brand (HEB) frozen pack labeled "Biscuits Southern Style" rather than the pack labeled buttery or buttermilk. Not sure how much difference that made. Yummy recipe!

I made this last Thanksgiving, and I must say, this is the best cornbread dressing I have ever had!  The whole family agreed.  There were no leftovers!  I used a good homemade cornbread recipe, and frozen ready-to-bake biscuits.  I think it's the chicken and the cream soup that take this recipe to the next level.  It's almost a meal in itself.  I'll definitely be making it again this year!

Thank you so much for publishing this recipe! I prepared my 1st Thanksgiving meal this year and everyone LOVED this dressing!  I had asked everyone, "How do you make cornbread dressing?"  Everyone's reply was, "I just get the stuff and throw it all together."  WHAT STUFF?..lol  It was pointed out to me, that making dressing isn't really a secret, it's just that only Mom's and Grandma's are up at that hour assembling the goodies!  Now, I HAVE THE "STUFF"...and I can still sleep in...lol

This is the recipe I have used for the past few years. We were given it by a lady called Martha and I wonder if it is the same person that this one is named after. Anyway, it is delicious. I have never had any problems getting the consistency right and the flavor is always perfect. You should find when you are ready to put it in the pan that it has a consistency similar to cake batter. The only change I have ever made is to cook my celery and onions an little before adding so that there is no crunch once it is done. My VERY picky husband gets so excited when I tell him I am making this. I don't think I will have a Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner without it again.

Yep, this is the one.  The one that tastes like the cornbread dressing mama ALWAYS made every Thanksgiving and Christmas.  None of that crazy stuff in my dressing.  Just give me the plain old-fashioned simple Southern goodness like this recipe is.  Thanks so much for posting it!!!!

TIPS: For upping the flavor factor.....  When making this recipe during Thanksgiving and Christmas, we use meat from the turkey rather than from a whole chicken. We also use 1 cup chopped bell pepper. But the SECRET TRICK to making the recipe phenomenal in terms of flavor is to use a chopped yellow onion and add it to the crumbled cornbread immediately after it comes out of the oven. Just add the chopped onion, cover and let it rest for about 5 minutes before adding the remaining ingredients. The steam from the hot cornbread allows the onion flavor (and other ingredients) to soak into the cornbread. Mmmm!!! We also add a cup or two of turkey stock directly from the cooked turkey for added flavor! This is very similar to my grandmother's recipe which has been passed down for years! Soooo good!

This was great! I made it last night to test before Thankgiving. I used ONLY cornbread, no biscuits. This required 3 boxes of Jiffy. I only used five eggs (because that was all I had) and I sauteed the onions and celery before adding them. Also, I used a can of chicken broth (a small can). I baked in one dish for 50 minutes. My daughter has NEVER liked dressing before but she LOVED this!!! This is a definite keeper!!!

This is a solid recipe. Everyone liked it. I used chicken and apple sausage instead of the chicken, and as another reviewer suggested, 2.5 cups of chicken stock to soak the dressing in. I also sauteed the onion and celery with the chicken sausage beforehand. Very easy to put together, as long as you make the biscuits and cornbread a few days in advance and have those in the fridge.

This is the closest thing my family has ever found to my grandmother's dressing. She always made it every Thanksgiving and Christmas, but she passed away suddenly a few years ago, and no one knew the recipe! We have tried to duplicate it several times before, and this is the closest we have tasted! I use the biscuits you buy in the freezer section, and just some dry cornbread dressing mix (not the way grandma made it, I'm sure) and it still reminds me of her every holiday. Thank you for this recipe!

I cute this down to 4-5 servings. I didn't have any biscuits so I used all cornbread (homemade; "Homesteader Cornbread" from AR). I was out of any kind of "cream of" soup so I made my own (plain + seasonings) using "Cream Soup Base" from AR. Skipped the salt since the soup was salty enough on its own. I used more sage than called for and added hot chili powder. I also used some homemade chicken stock and a bit of water to moisten the cornbread. Added some frozen veggie mix too. It still came out dry, and not very flavourful despite using homemade ingredients (that tasted good on their own though).

This is a basic bare bones Southern dressing recipe.  Few things to keep in mind, the cornbread (add extra eggs to the cornbread while making) and biscuits need to be cooked a day or two in advance to allow them to stale.  I also crumble up stale white bread and sub poultry seasoning for the sage.

This recipe was fantastic! Very cheap to make too, since I used up leftover cornbread and biscuits to make it. I scled the recipe to make 5 servings (still put it in a 9x13 pan and it yielded about 8 servings for us) I didn't make a chicken, I just combined the other ingredients, put it in a 9x13 pan and poured 1 can of chicken broth over the top of it. I baked it at 350 for 1 hour - delicious!

Bake real cornbread with celery and onions first.  Crumble and add all these ingredients plus a can of cream of celery soup and lots of poultry seasonings instead of just sage.  Be sure the raw dressing is a liquid consistency before baking.  It will be creamy and great!!  Better double the recipe.

This was amazing. I chose this stuffing recipe simply because I happened to have a whole chicken in the freezer that someone gave us, and I wanted to put it to good use. Instead of just boiling the chicken plain, I used the "Boiled Chicken" recipe from this site. I also used the "Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread" recipe for the cornbread, but I was lazy with the biscuits and just used the kind from the can. The only change I made was adding a bit of chopped fresh sage in addition to the ground sage. Next time I will probably omit the ground sage and just increase the amount of fresh. Yum!

Fabulous recipe. I used Jiffy brand cornbread, made my own bisquits, added minced garlic and jalepenos to jazz it up a little. Don't hold back on the salt and pepper either.

I made this for a work party and it was really good...a little too much cornbread for my taste, so next time I think I will do half biscuits/half cornbread.  I also put it in my crockpot while at work to keep it warm and moist...just added a little chicken stock.  Yummy and really easy to make!

This dressing was a complete success!!  I had never made dressing before and loved to eat it.  Being out of town this year for Thanksgiving, I decided it was time to try it own my own.  This recipe is the same as one I was given from a great cook.  Everything is the same, but I didn't use the chicken.  I used chicken broth.  I also used toasted white bread instead of biscuits.  The dressing was very moist and full of taste.  I was so proud of myself!!

This is a great recipes.  I had to omit the eggs due to allergies, but it still turned to taste great.  I will use this again.

I used this recipe as a guide, like the other reviewer I didn't know what the "stuff" was! The soup is a wonderful addition, so moist!!
My husband tells everyone...It's just like Grandmas!

This was delicious!  Nice change of pace from the usual cornbread dressing.  Try this with a good ol' Southern summer vegetable supper--sliced tomatoes, greens, green beans and new potatoes, corn on the cob and fried okra.  Top it off with banana pudding.

Not one I'll make again.  I made both the cornbread and biscuits from scratch, but did leave out the chicken, since I was serving both turkey and ham for Christmas dinner.  Not knowing how much broth to add was very confusing ... I had puddles in the dish before baking, but it turned out very dry.  Maybe we're all too used to northern style bread dressing to know what cornbread dressing should taste like!

I have FINALLY found my cornbread dressing recipe. I always dreaded making stuffing at Thanksgiving, but not anymore. It's easy to make too. I followed the recipe except I used canned chicken broth. My family really liked it and that makes it a keeper for me.
Anyone looking for a cornbread dressing recipe can stop looking with this one.
Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Thank you for this recipe, it is excellent. I've make it just as written but I've also substituted more cornbread for some/all of the biscuits. Either way, it's wonderful and it freezes perfectly.  Happy Thanksgiving!

This is an excellent dressing recipe. I like the addition of the cream of chicken. I add sausage instead of chicken and you just gotta add more sage! I also like using garlic cheese biscuits instead of plain.

This dressing is sooo good!  It was my 1st time ever to make dressing and it turned out great!  I only had 3 eggs so I add half a can of cream of celery soup... I also just used leftover turkey meat and 3/4 a can of chicken broth!  Even my Grandmother said it was Amazing!!!  Guess I'll be making the family dressing from now on!

A friend of mine is known for her cornbread dressing and every year she makes me a pan of it. This year she was out of town so I had to do the dressing. This recipe is very close to my friend's recipe and it is outstanding! I didn't change a thing except I added a chopped medium bell pepper. When adding the broth to soak the breads, I used plenty so the consistency came out a little runnier than cake batter and it cooked up great! Just like my friend's! I will use this recipe year after year...it was scrumptious and my guests loved it!

This dish was delicious. It was moist, yet crispish around the edges. Buttery tasting. I made two and put smoked oysters in one of them instead of the chicken. Instant Oyster Dressing. Everyone loved it and it wasn't fishy tasting at all. 2 of the small cans of smoked oysters.

It was okay.  Not as good as I expected, based on all the comments.  Being from south Georgia, I have grown up on cornbread dressing and this was not nearly what I was hoping for.

Thank you for this recipe! Everyone raved about it at Thanksgiving.  I added the onions and celery to the cornbread mixture and baked together.  I added two biscuits with five pieces of toasted bread and used some canned chicken broth along with some chicken bouillon mixed with water and seasoned with salt, pepper and poultry seasoning.

I followed the recipe exactly as written and I found it to be quite bland. I was disappointed since the majority of reviews are so positive. I will just stick to my regular cornbread dressing.

In my southern family we call this Chicken Casserole - our cornbread “dressing” doesn’t include chicken pieces or cream of mushroom soup. This recIpe is GREAT as a casserole, served w a side of steamed broccoli, but I would never serve this as a traditional southern dressing at any thanksgiving meal!

Basically this is my grandmother's dressing re pie. I wish that some hints could be given about how much broth to add. For example: For drier dressing add 1 1/2 cups broth, for juicier dressing, add 3 cups, etc.  so hard to get it just right. The flavor is good, though.

Delicious!  I did make a few small changes.  I used a rotisserie chicken rather than starting from scratch.  I found that between the eggs and the soup I didn't need any additional broth but I still wanted the flavor so I used a couple of teaspoons of chicken bouillon- this recipe is probably best with a dry and "unsweet" Sourhern-style cornbread.  I also sautéed the onions and celery and added about 1/2 tsp each of garlic powder, tarragon, and marjoram.  The entire concoction fit in a 13"x9" pan, though I did end up increasing the baking time by about 5 minutes.  Would definitely make again!

I wanted to love this as much as most of the reviewers, but I didn't.  Dressing, cornbread dressing especially, is so "to taste" & a number rather than an amount (six biscuits vs 3c biscuit crumbs).  I doubled the poultry seasoning/sage as most did, homemade chicken stock.I A 3 star from me.  E, 19, liked it better; but still not the "it" cornbread dressing I'm looking for.  Darn!  :D

This is my go-to dressing recipe. In fact I'm making it for a potluck this weekend. The recipe is excellent as is but I usually add a diced green bell pepper and substitute 4 tsps of rubbed sage for the ground sage.
