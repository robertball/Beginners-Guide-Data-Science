Very good!  This makes a fantastic panini if you leave off the lettuce and brush the assembled sandwich very lightly with extra virgin olive oil before grilling to a nice golden brown.  We sometimes add other tasty veggies like thinly sliced red onion, bell pepper and chopped artichoke hearts. It's even good if you only have regular (not smoked) mozzarella on hand.  YUM!

Great idea. I didn't use tomato and lettuce. Instead I added black olives and heated the entire thing to melt the cheese. Next time I'll try adding more pesto sauce or maybe a bit of pizza\marinara. Thanks.

I really thought I would love this bc I often make sandwiches just like this all the time with cheese and tomato.  I don't know if I wasn't as hungry as I thought or what, though, bc I ate only half the sandwich.  I toasted everything except the lettuce and let the cheese melt, then topped with lettuce.  I left out the mayo (can't stand it) and used sun dried tomato pesto.  Something, though, didn't hit it for me.  Maybe the lettuce?  Thanks for the recipe!

I loved it! But I may be partial. I'm a big fan of cheese. I put on everything but the lettice & tomato & brushed it with olive oil & grilled it on my George Forman grill like a panini, then I added the lettice & tomato. Its good!!!

Add a little balsamic vinegar before you close the Sandwich... It adds a lot more flavor!!

Yum, yum and more yum. These were great sandwiches. I had to use gluten free while grain bread but otherwise followed this to the letter. The whole family loved using pesto instead of fattening sauces like mayo etc. thank you veggigoddess for your recipe.

I loved this!  I didn't use a sourdough but used a Paleo homemade sandwich bread, plus homemade mayo, and chose to leave off the provolone, that's a ton of raw cheese together lol!  I really did enjoy it though, 5 stars :)
