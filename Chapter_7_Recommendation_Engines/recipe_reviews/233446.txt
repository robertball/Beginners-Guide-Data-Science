This is a great base recipe, but I felt the need to make some additions:  1/2 green bell pepper (cut into thin strips, added to my wok with the rest of the vegetables); 2 cloves of garlic, minced (added during the last minute of stir-frying the vegetables); about 1 Tbs. toasted sesame oil (tossed with the cooked and drained spaghetti--did not rinse with water); and 1/2 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes (I like it a little spicy).  I did not change the sauce recipe at all, there was no need to do so. I also chopped up some roasted peanuts for sprinkling (my sister's request).  I will make this recipe again and again and sometimes add a protein to the noodles to make it more hearty.  Thank you, SarBetEns, for this very good base recipe for a great lo mein dish.

Next time, I will start stir frying the carrots before adding the other vegetables.  They took longer to cook, and as a result, the other veggies overcooked.  I added grilled shrimp to make this an entree (used the marinade from Surf and Turf for Two from this site) and some red bell pepper slices to give it a little more color.  Was concerned that I may need to thicken the sauce, but that wasn't the case.  Enjoyed and will make again.

Delicious! When I was mixing up the sauce and tasted it, I wasn't sure, but after combining everything together, it was wonderful! I did use 1/2 sesame oil and 1/2 veg oil, b/c I love sesame oil. Oh, and I doubled the recipe, so there would be plenty for leftovers. This a so simple to make...a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

This was quick and easy, not to mention, delicious. I doubled the sauce like others suggested, other than the ginger, because I don't care for a strong ginger taste. I couldn't even taste it, so I could have used the extra ¼ tsp and been fine. My green onions were quite large so I added the whites along with the sauce and noodles, then saved the green parts to sprinkle on top of each serving, along with some slivered onions. Yum! UPDATE: We eat this pretty regularly, but I usually add extra veggies. It just depends what I have on hand; quartered and sliced zucchini, small broccoli florets, red peppers, just use whatever your family enjoys! I don't usually change the sauce because it's delicious as is, but once in awhile I'll add a tablespoon of lime juice. I also use ½ veg (canola) oil and ½ sesame oil when stir-frying, for a little more flavor. It's very versatile, but delicious as written!

These noodles were great! I didn't have any teriyaki so used a bit of balsamic instead. I baked some chicken in a mixture of the honey, balsamic and soy with ginger and then I cut it up and finished  it off in the pan and added to the noodles. I paired this recipe with the awesome egg roll recipe which I love. I agree when stir frying the veggies start with carrots as they take longer. Great recipe!

We all really loved these noodles, a perfect blend of flavors. I liked the subtle sweetness the honey added. I followed the recipe as written with the exception of also adding in a red sweet bell pepper with the other vegetables, and salt and white pepper while stir frying the vegetables. Easy enough and great side dish for any Asian main meal. I think any vegetable you have on hand would work with these noodles.

First, I never try anything on this website that has very few reviews. But, I took a risk, and it worked out. This is a solid recipe, and very simple. The sauce (consisting of teriyaki, soy, honey, & ginger) could probably be used for any stir-fry or marinade. I ended up using it for the Lo Mein noodles. I added a little rice vinegar and sesame oil to taste (once everything was combined), due to personal preference.

Excellent! Quick and easy. I don't like celery and carrots, so instead used broccoli and shrimp along with the sweet onion. I had to make the sauce twice as one serving wasn't enough to cover the spaghetti and I didn't even use a whole pack of spaghetti, but even so, it was delicious. Maybe a tad too salty but that's my fault. I didn't have any low-sodium soy sauce on hand. Next time I make it, I'll also use mushrooms. Oh, and I used olive oil instead of vegetable.

This is the best lo mein I've ever made. Great recipe for tweeking to your taste. I added pork and broccoli. This recipe is a keeper. Some other reviewers said there was not enough sauce. Personally, I feel it was just enough. Any more sauce and it would have been too saucy. Lo mein isn't typically "saucy" like some other Chinese dishes.

I really like this simple recipe for lo mein. Do not feel you need to stick to the veggies listed here - add broccoli, mushrooms, sugar snap peas, sesame oil - anything you like in your Chinese noodles. I like using some red pepper flakes and extra garlic to give these a kick, as well as some shrimp or sliced chicken breast. These keep for leftovers quite well, I double the recipe and save some to take for lunches for work. Enjoy!

I made this recipe as directed with the addition of a shredded rotisserie chicken at the very end to make it more of a meal.  It was average.

I made this recipe and loved it!  I've never made lo mein at home before this.  I mostly followed the recipe other than the ginger, onions & celery.  I didn't have these as I don't like them so I added broccoli & fresh sweet corn and at the last minute some crab meat.  It was delicious!

I've made this twice and it's been a big hit in my young family!  Per a past reviews, I added a tablespoon of sesame oil to the noodles.  I also added a bag of coleslaw, doubled the sauce and added shrimp.  Great meal!

Really enjoyed this!  My only changes were to use brown sugar instead of honey (I was out) and to thrown in extra veggies (cabbage & broccoli as I had some to use up).  I was also out of ground ginger, so I simply sautéed some fresh ginger with veggies.  Can't wait to make it with honey....

These were awesome!  My husband loved them.  You can add veggies as you wish to these noodles.  I didn't have any green onions the night I made these, so I tossed in three cloves of minced garlic to add flavor.  Delicious!

This was so yummy!  I used gluten free tamari sauce (as a soy sauce substitute) and added some fish sauce and hot Asian chili sauce as well, for extra flavor. I also used real grated ginger, rather than powdered. I added a few eggs at the end and sauteed them quickly to cook them (as an alternative to using meat). The resulting sauce was flavorful, as well as creamy and filling, thanks to the eggs.  It's a delicious and flexible recipe; I will definitely will make it again!

This is also fantastic with zucchini noodles for a low carb option. Just don't boil the noodles at all first - the stir frying softens them enough!

I added red bell peppers (they are in the recipe pic!) and mushrooms and chicken. Fantastic.

This lo mein is great!  you can get the actual lo mein noodles which is great or just use the spaghetti noodles, also fry the carrots and celery for a couple minutes before adding the onion, and also add a little extra soy and teriyaki after finished cooking... to taste.

I will never eat lo mein at a restaurant again...this is excellent.     I used sliced red peppers, sliced carrots, chopped celery and shredded cabbage. I sauteed the vegetables in sesame oil, red pepper flakes and garlic pepper.  I doubled the sauce recipe as suggested.I used low sodium teriyaki sauce and low sodium  soy sauce.   I added angel hair pasta and mixed everything together. While the vegetables were cooking I seasoned  3 pork loin chops with garlic pepper and broiled the chops.  I cut the meat and added it after   everything was mixed together.

First time attempting  Chinese cooking....if u don't count Ramen Noodles! This sauce is perfect! I didn't change a thing. It was a last minute idea and I had all of the ingredients on hand. Basic stuff and so delicious. I will add shrimp and whatever veggies I have on hand next time to make it even better. I also made it again with zucchini noodles because I just got a veggetti deluxe. Sooo good & less carbs. Thanks for sharing this crowd pleasing, easy recipe.

I love this recipe, I leave out the celery and add Bell Peppers. Since some reviewers noted a problem with the carrots staying stiff, I add the carrots into the boiling noodles while they were cooking 1-2 minutes before taking it off the stove. I  added crushed pepper and a sesame seed, spice Cook Asia mix to the sauce.

Overall great recipe, will be using it several times.

I thought this recipe was awesome!  My husband was impressed too - using spaghetti made me a little skeptical, but honestly - it was so delicious!  I didn't have low sodium soy sauce, so I used regular, and I didn't have onion and carrot - but I DID have fresh ginger - minced it up - added some fresh garlic - wow - so flavorful!  Loved it!

Very easy to make.  I used shredded carrots from the grocery store and they cooked up nicely with the other veggies.  I thought the sauce was a little watery. Reminiscent of sweet Thai food as opposed to Chinese but very good.  Will make again and will add minced garlic next time.

This was great! First time ever making lo mein. Very easy. I followed the recipe exactly, only I didn't have green onion, but threw in some mushrooms instead. Perfect.

This turned out great! I doubled the recipe because I made a 16 oz. box of noodles. I will make this again for sure!

Really came together very nicely and authentically.  My family loved it.  Added Red peppers and a drop of oyster sauce.  I also mix my oil with wok or thai oil for extra flavors.  I used fresh grated ginger as well.  This was a hit.  This recipe is adaptable to all taste.

I just tried this recipe using shrimp and it is delicious! I only used the veggies that I have red bell peppers, onion, carrots. I did add sweet chili sauce like another reviewer mentioned and 3 tbs more of soy sauce with a tbs of cornstarch to create a little thicker sauce. Everyone loved it! Seemed as easy as making spaghetti.

My family and I loved it.  We will definitely be making again.  Only change we made was adding garlic to the sauce and adding more veggies. We used zucchini, onion, carrots, red and green peppers.  Maybe next time will add in a meat, shrimp or chicken.

My teenager wanted Lo Mein, but she is very picky so I ended up with just the pasta and sauce.  It was a hit. Next time I think I can slip in some slivered carrot and perhaps edamame for color.  I think letting the spaghetti noodles cool before adding them to the sauce kept them firm. 2nd go, I added meat, carrot and edamame.  Delish, and the texture is great.

This was fantastic. I used a whole box of spaghetti so I had to double this recipe. I didn't quite have enough soy sauce, only 2 tablespoon so I added an extra tablespoon of teriyaki, 1 teaspoon of sesame oil and tablepsoon of sweet thai chili....must say pretty good.

Due to personal preference, we omitted the celery and carrots. Also didn't have any honey so we substituted it with corn syrup. Everything else we left the same and LOVED it. Will make this way again in the future!

I made this as written except I used splenda instead of honey.  Great, flavorful, simple recipe.  I think this would be good with shrimp added to it as well.

Accurately named--lo mein noodles.  If you want to make it a main dish, I would suggest adding a lot more vegetables (and meat, if desired).  Also, at least double the sauce.  Excellent flavor--thank you for submitting.

This was great! I didn't have honey on hand so I added two tbsp of brown sugar and at the end added two packets of equal. I used thinly sliced cabbage and white onion because I had it on hand. I love garlic so I tossed in some minced garlic. Paired with chicken marinated in Lawrys sesame ginger marinade this was a delicious meal!

Made this without the teriyaki sauce, used fettuccine and 100% maple syrup instead of honey. It came out really well. Added some zucchini as well to get more veggies in the mix.

I was looking for a recipe for the sauce, so that gets 5 stars, but I cheated and used frozen Asian mix vegetables. Big mistake because it was mostly soy beans and barley. I also used whole wheat spaghetti, which I don't like. But the sauce saved it. I only put half the honey and only had full sodium teriyaki and soy sauces. It's almost too salty for me,  but I LOVE SALT. I will make this again, but either with reduced sodium teriyaki OR soy, but not both.

Made it twice - with spaghetti and ramen noodles.  Family preferred ramen noodles.  Family loved it and made the rotation.  I made with spaghetti but don't care for celery or sprouts so I used shredded carrots and zucchini; for the sauce I had to leave teriyaki out (think it was too old) so sprinkled a little brown sugar.   We all loved it but granddaughter suggested the ramen noodles.  Next time I used ramen noodles with shredded carrots and zucchini and same sauce combo.  Wow!  What a difference!  It's a quick and easy dish to whip up!  Made it third time but threw in chicken - it was delicious!   Will be having to triple this recipe cuz everyone wants leftovers … lots of leftover.  Very versatile recipe!  About the sauce  - when you mix sauce ingredients it doesn't seem like much but don't let that fool you - it's just the right amount.   One more thing - break up ramen noodles into chunks before you throw them in water so they'll be easier to mix with other ingredients.

This recipe is so yummy but I believe it’ll be better by adding lots of garlic since I love it. I added some steak my husband put it in the BBQ and was perfect. This will also be a great vegan recipe but using some agave honey instead (my daughter is vegan not me :) obviously)

I followed the recipe as written,  but doubled the sauce and added more red pepper flakes to it and it was great.  I got a “You nailed it.  Let’s have that again soon”!  I’ll reduce the soy sauce next time...for my tastebuds!

This  recipe is amazing! My husband couldn't stop raving about it, and I made it twice in a week! The only thing I did different was to use red pepper, broccoli and the pre-shredded carrots in a bag. Definitely a great substitute for ordering takeout.

I used what I had on hand. I used thawed frozen veggies and linguine noodles. I made the homemade teriyaki sauce and used that. I put about a tablespoon of honey while cooking everything together. All in all, it was pretty tasty. I will most definitely use this recipe again.

I read the reviews and based my version off of the original and the tips from reviewers. I switched out half the vegetable oil for sesame oil. Regarding the sauce recipe, I doubled everything. I also used fresh ginger and added a clove of garlic and a tablespoon of rice vinegar. The recipe itself was a great start and can easily be customized to suit individual tastes. I’ll definitely make this again.

Made with fresh ginger and coconut aminos (instead of soy sauce), and all the other ingredients listed. I also added red cabbage, purple carrots, sugar snap peas, and other veggies in the fridge. Huge hit!

I have made this twice so far.  The first time with the spaghetti and I wasn't too impressed, so the next time I made it I used lo mein noodles bought from my local store.  The second time it was so much better, loved it and will make it again for sure!

I LOVE this recipe! It is so simple and I always have the ingredients on hand. I also double the recipe for extra sauce and use protein spaghetti noodles. It’s great to change out the veggies for preference.

it tasted awesome however it is not the lo mein I'm used to from the Chinese restaurants. I will make it again for sure. I did however cook the veggies in the broth from the chicken instead of oil. the only reason I'm giving it a four is it wasn't what I was expecting.

Everyone liked the finished product a lot.  When I assembled the sauce (substituting brown sugar for the honey to make it strictly vegan), I found it to be almost inedibly salty and bitter; I had to add much more brown sugar to balance the flavors.  I don’t know if it was my choice of teriyaki sauce, or what, but we couldn’t have eaten it the way it was.  It turned out pretty good, though, after all is said and done. ***Edit: Changing my rating from 4 to 5 stars because the second time I made this I used the honey (with the same brand of Teriyaki sauce) instead of brown sugar, and what a huge difference it made!  It was delicious when staying true to the recipe.  Lesson learned.

This is so good! I did change it a bit but that’s the beauty of it, you can customize to your taste and what you have. I didn’t use celery, but added beef strips (dredged in a little cornstarch and salt and pepper) cooked first on high, removed from pan, then added vegetables to cook in this order so they’d all come out cooked the right amount. Carrots first, push to side, then mushrooms, then onions and red pepper. Add back in beef, thin spaghetti, and sauce (I like to add some rice vinegar to sauce and you can substitute sugar). Absolutely delicious!

I always head to the lo-mein first when at a Chinese buffet so wanted to make it myself.  This recipe was delish with making a double batch of the sauce and adding 2 cups of shredded cabbage.  I think I used more then 8 oz. of spaghetti, too.  i didn't know that this was made with normal old spaghetti...thought it was a different kind of noodle.

Super easy and versatile recipe.  I subbed the vegetables for what I had on hand,and used sesame oil which I think have it more of an authentic flavor.

This is a super easy recipe and easy to put together for a tasty, weeknight dinner.  I added grilled chicken to make it more like an entree, but it does stand alone very nicely.  Next time I plan to add some Korean BBQ beef strips.

I looked at most of the Lo Mein recipes, both here and on tablespoon.com, looking primarily at the sauce ingredients as I already knew the pasta, vegetables, and even meat could be substituted. I knew I was going to use boneless, skinless chicken thighs and different veggies,. It was just the sauce that mattered. I really liked the sound of the sauce for this recipe so I made it last night for my supper. As I said I used the thighs, and since my favorite restaurant Lo Mein had cabbage and carrots I checked out the packaged produce at my store looking for shredded coleslaw mix, and found 1 that had cabbage, carrots, kale and broccoli that sounded better. and thats what I used this time. I also have some broccoli florets, mushrooms, water chestnuts, and sliced bamboo shoots for the next time I make it. It turned out very well, and the sauce is easy to make and very tasty. It's also a quick and easy meal to make, which is a plus as I hate spending a lot of time in the kitchen.

OMG!!!! I made this dish for the first time and It was amazing. 
I really don't like a lot vegetables in my noodles so I made it with carrots and onions and It was amazing. I also didn't add the cumin. I replaced it with pepper. I am VERY proud of the way it turned out. I am also proud of myself for completing it!

Very good, easy dish.  I added some stir fry veggies and broiled chicken breast to make it a heartier dish. Will definitely make again.

I made this and loved it so much I made a second batch so I would have leftovers to take to work. I didn’t have scallions in the house so I skipped them. I had some portobello mushroom caps and added those.  I doubled the sauce recipe.  I will defiantly be making this regularly.

I absolutely love this recipe... So easy and delicious. I've added more veggies and also sometimes I added chicken or shrimp. I have also tweaked the sauce a little by adding more ginger and more honey, I kinda like it a little sweeter. I have made this several times and always love it.

I'm making this a second time tonight. I love it just as is.  Tonight we are going to add some extra veggies and some roasted peanuts.  I found Lo Mein noodles at our grocery store for the first time we made it, but tonight I'm using the left over spaghetti noodles from dinner a couple nights ago.  Great way to use up a left over and dress it differently! Can't wait.  Already made the dressing & cut up my veggies so it's going to be a really quick throw together dinner!

I always find recipes on here to make new dishes, and always end up altering them based off of my own palette. But long story short I finally got around to making this exactly as written and it is still wonderful without my own modifications! Definitely suggest this to someone who might be afraid of trying their hand at asian cuisine. It’s superrr easy and tastes amazing!

The only changes  made was using a 14 oz  bag of chinese fried noodles and doubling up the recipe.  I didn't have low sodium soya sauce so I replaced the 6 Tbs of  low sodium soya sauce with 4 Tbs regular soya s. and 2 Tbs water.  It could have used more whisked sauce but since I didn't have anymore made , I just added a little more teriyaki sauce . It was fantastic!

I was very excited to try this, but unfortunately was not impressed with the result.  I followed the recipe, the only thing I did differently was add some chopped rotisserie chicken.  I thought it lacked flavor.  I probably will not make it again.

Delicious! My favorite take-out dish made with about $2 worth of ingredients. Will double next time for lots of leftovers! I did not have teriyaki sauce on hand, so added sesame sauce for extra flavor. Otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Yum!

Love the recipe! I did double the recipe so I would have left overs. I didn't change the sauce ingredients or added anything to the sauce, I thought it was perfect the way it was.  What I did add was  sliced green bell peppers, minced garlic, and crush red peppers.  I also added teriyaki chicken pieces, since it was the main dish. I think this is a great recipe to play around with by adding different veggies or/and protein, just don't change the sauce since the sauce is already good the way it is. Enjoy and have fun experimenting!

I'm not a fan of celery. I used a bag of broccoli slaw (julienne strips of carrots, broccoli  cabbage) LESS PREP! Yay me!

I also use lo mein noodles . Less ingredients and 4min cook time. I've switched to lo mein noodles as my go to for pasta.

My first time making Lo Mein! ...added broccoli, red bell pepper and cabbage. Substituted vegetable oil for Avacado oil & egg noodles for spaghetti.  Cooked in about a cup & 1/2 chicken broth before adding the sauce. Turned Out Fantastic!

I make it with chopped sirloin for stir fry I get at the store. Added zucchini too it as well. Sometimes to give it a kick we add 2-3 Thai chili’s finely chopped. Great quick meal.

This is a good base recipe, but I tweaked it quite a bit.  I ended up tripling the amount of ginger after tasting the sauce and adding crushed red pepper and sesame oil to suit my taste.  The recipe as written was just ok-  not bad, but a bit bland for our liking.  I used a black bean spaghetti (gluten free), and tossed in more vegetables.  The sauce is a good base, and probably more suited to people who don't like much spice.

This was good, the whole family loved it. We doubled the sauce recipe, cooked up chicken breast and thighs which we seasoned with garlic powder. We also used more veggies, carrots, celery, broccoli & cauliflower. It made a lot, but who doesn't love leftovers. Made the sauce to the recipe but left out onions.

Turned out great! Perfect amount of sauce for the noodles. I kicked it up a notch with Sriracha, but it was great without.

It came out pretty okay! I didn't add the veggies to mine since I didn't have any but I did add in some tofu since I usually ask for tofu in my lo mein at the Chiense restaurant! I doubled the honey and ground ginger and added some red wine vinegar too! Very savory! Will make again!

i  made it for two picky grandsons so i left out
the veges. I added onion powder to the sauce
also. I cooked it in the same dutch oven I cooked the spaghetti in, and still used the 2 tablespoons of oil to keep it moist. I used only half to 2/3 of the sauce and let
them taste it first...they LOVED it! I think if I'd used all the sauce they might have been too strong and salty. This way, they were perfect!

ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!  I love finding a recipe that I know I will use forever.  I added a pound of frozen stir-fry vegetables and 8-10 chopped shrimp, making this a one dish meal.  Thank you SarBetEns for sharing such an ABSOLUTELY  WONDERFUL recipe!

I enjoyed this recipe a lot, but made quite a few additions - red bell pepper, garlic, fresh ginger, red pepper flakes, salt, pepper, sesame oil... I think the sesame oil really made the difference.

It seemed like it was missing something. I couldn't figure it out. I followed the recipe to the letter, but it still didn't taste right. The family ate it and so did I, but something was missing.

I followed LYNNINMA 'S advice, and i thought it came out decent. I only had mushrooms, celery and onion to add. I'd recommend using a chinese noodle, udon or such to get the desired texture. Also needs more flavor, maybe you could achieve that with a higher vegetable : pasta ratio.

I made this as part of the Allrecipes Allstar Canada #HealthyWinterDinner campaign. My husband's family is Dutch, Indonesian cuisine is popular in their cooking, this recipe reminded me of Bahmi Goreng. I used vegetables I had on hand garlic, yellow onion, mushrooms, red pepper, carrots and broccoli, I sauteed in 1 tbsp canola oil and 1 tsp sesame oil. I am also on a low sodium diet, I made homemade Ketjap Manis with 1/2 cup coconut aminos, 1/4 cup molasses and 1/4 cup brown sugar, boiled until thickened, which I substituted for the soya sauce, teriyaki sauce and honey. I used 1 tsp fresh ginger for the powdered and also added 1 tsp Sambal Oelek for a kick. I used whole wheat spaghettini for the pasta and topped with an egg to add some protein.  Drizzled some of the Ketjap Manis over top and sprinkled with sesame seeds. Thanks for a great recipe!

The only changes that I made were that I 1) excluded the ginger, 2) substituted the two types of onion with 1/2 white onion, and 3) used canned carrots instead of fresh carrots. Unfortunately, it didn't really have much flavor, and I don't see how my minor changes would've had such a negative impact on the recipe. To solve this problem, I mixed the noodles with white rice and added hot sauce. I will not be making this recipe again.

Looking for a quick recipe since it's just me and my son living in a condo. I followed everything on the recipe except I replaced ground ginger with dashi and used linguini instead of spaghetti and added chicken strips. My son & I loved it. Quick, easy and tasty

This recipe didn't look all that exciting, but my family loved it! Like others, I nearly doubled the sauce (otherwise, it would be too dry). I added a red bell pepper and a few cloves of garlic, and used a bag of frozen carrots to save time. Towards the end of the cooking, I added shredded leftover chicken. The sauce was super flavorful, and everyone enjoyed this.

I added sesame seed oil and since I didn't have any onions, I just used onion powder and garlic powder when stiring the vegetables. The sauce was wonderful. I'd probably leave out the celery next time because I'm not a big fan of it in the first place.

This is a good basic recipe to use up a variety of ingredients in either the sauce or the stir fry itself. I made a version with soba noodles instead of spaghetti, and added a sprinkling of sesame seeds at the end. I only needed about 3 minutes for the last step.  I also found the sauce too sweet for me so I needed to add some granulated garlic, hot sauce and extra soy sauce to my portion. Next time I make it, I may add a different selection of veggies and maybe some 5 spice powder and/or dried chili flakes.

It was very tasty--after I microwaved some the day later, I added a little hot sauce--next time I'll be certain to use teriyaki sauce.  If you don't like it too spicy, using olive oil instead of teriyaki sauce is good!

It was pretty good, and a good base recipe and easy to make. You'll probably want to add some of your own favorite spices to add, to add some flare.

This was a perfect recipe. So tasty!! I just doubled the sauce because I also added garlic, shrimp, baby corn, and sliced water chestnuts. Perfect take-out made at home.

I made this and just substituted thinly sliced green and red peppers for the celery.  My picky family ate it all!  The sauce combination is great--just right.  I was happy to find this to have as a side when I make thinly-sliced, grilled and marinated London broil.  It is definitely becoming a staple at my house.

Excellent! So easy to make yet so good.  We didn't have any green onion, but it still tasted delicious without.  We had some extra cabbage & lettuce on hand so we grated a little and threw that in, as well.  We will definitely make again & again.

I just made this my husband and I have recently tried to add more vegetarian entrees to our diet. I loved the sauce as many seem to. I also double the recipe for left overs. I added bamboo shoots, broccoli, water chestnuts and snow peas it was very good and full of veggies. I also used brown rice noodles which also worked well. I will make this again and maybe add a different variety of veggies. This recipe is definitely full of possibilities I am going to try the sesame seeds and oil.

Puts delivery to shame.  The kids loved this and so did I!  I doubled the sauce because more is always better, except  perhaps in the case of taxes.  Also, having looked at another recipe that received good reviews, I cooked the noodles in chicken broth, and veggies in sesame oil, which combined with this yummy sauce gave the dish nicely balanced depth and flavor.  Can't wait to make it again.

Use more vegetables.  We used wide, flat noodles instead of spaghetti and they soaked up the sauce beautifully.

I found the soya sauce to be not enough, as well as the vegetables. I would recommend at least doubling the vegetables and soya sauce for 500g of pasta. It has potential but needs a bit tweaking.

This was pretty good.  My daughter made it and added a little garlic powder and more soy sauce, but it was easy and came out great.  We look forward to making it again and adding different veggies and meats to mix it up.

It was decent a little bland to my liking but pretty good. If I made it again I'd do more of the soy sauce, teriyaki mixture and add some more vegetables like green peppers and mushrooms.

Fantastic!! Super easy and tasty!  Although, I didn't do the green onions and instead added broccoli.  I also substituted one of the tablespoons of teriyaki sauce for one tablespoon of this spicy ginger teriyaki sauce that gave it a little kick of heat and it turned out AMAZING!!

A good sign you have a killer recipe is that a college student with limited supplies won't screw it up. This is my new go-to. I'll use the sauce mixture (minus ginger because I lack it), dried chives & onions instead of the onions, and  whatever frozen veggies I happen to have. I can even cook the vegetables with the noodles. Very good, although I like to add a bit more teriyaki.

This recipe is the bomb.com. I read reviews first so I doubled the sauce, added a chopped red pepper and used a whole onion, added chopped chicken marinated in teriyaki sauce, and used sesame oil instead of regular oil. Make sure to cook carrots for a while first as they take forever. 
 I served it with egg drop soup from this site as well. AWESOME. We like food spicy, so I threw in some spiracha too. SOOOO good.

I made a few changes, but overall this was a pretty great recipe. The veggies I used were: peas, broccoli, sweet peppers and carrots. I also used flat noodles I bought from our local asian supermarket instead of regular spaghetti. The sauce I made exactly as noted, but I doubled it since I used a lot of pasta (feeding 6 people here). The sauce had a great flavor and the veggies complimented it. I didn't even miss the fact that there was no meat in it.

The sauce is surprisingly authentic tasting given the small list of everyday ingredients. I had some leftover refrigerated Chinese noodles that I bought from an Asian store, and I decided to make lo mein to use them up. I browsed a number of recipes online but decided to use this one because I had all the ingredients. I eat Chinese food all the time and love lo mein. If someone placed the dish in front of me and told me that they got it from a Chinese takeout, I would believe them. I did not double the sauce because lo mein noodles should be coated, not saucy.

This recipe was SO EASY. We were limited on ingredients in the house and luckily we had these. We tried it and it is now going to be a continuous favorite. Five stars all the way.

my kids were asking for Chinese take out and I didn't feel like driving to pick it up.  I whipped this up real fast.  Kids were loving and ate every bite.  I added some sauteed chicken to make it a complete meal.  Thanks

This recipe is only missing one thing: GARLIC. It screams out for garlic. I skipped the celery because I hate it, but the rest is wonderful;. I also cook he carrots first, because they take longer than onion.

This was a good and easy dish to make. I added different vegetables and use Canton noodles but I followed the sauce recipe exactly as written. I will definitely repeat it :)

To begin, I didn't use carrots or celery.

This recipe was amazing! It slightly tastes like the Lo Mein from chinese restaurants but it has a different taste, to me anyway. My boyfriend liked it too. Can't wait to make this again!

These are the best homemade lo mein noodles I've tried. I left out the carrots and celery because I'm picky, but they we're still great.

We thought these didn't have much flavor & really didn't care for the sweetness. I've never had sweet lo mein so that was a little odd to me. Added a few shakes of soy sauce to the leftovers but they just didn't get eaten(& we LOVE lo mein). Sorry :(

What a great sauce! I would definitely double it next time.  Added black pepper and white pepper at the end and mixed it.  It could use a little heat like chili garlic or chili oil.  For the teriyaki sauce, we always have veri veri teriyaki sauce.
