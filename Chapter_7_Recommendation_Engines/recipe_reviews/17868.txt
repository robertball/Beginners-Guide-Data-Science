This is a good basic recipe. Here is how I tweaked it, and they turned out wonderful!  Mince all ingredients to make the patties form well. I also did not add any salt. Saute 1 large onion, 2 large crushed cloves garlic, 1 large red sweet pepper; in 2 TBL grape seed oil. Cool Mix chicken with the bread crumbs. Add the sauted veggies and include: 1TBL basil, 1Tsp cilantro, 1/3 Cup finely grated parmesean cheese, 1-2 tsp habenaro hot sauce, and 1-2 TBL worchestershire sauce. Add 3 eggs slightly beaten. Form small patties and place on cookie
sheet greased with canola oil spray. Bake 12 minutes at 350 degrees. (30 minutes is way too long, will dry them out) Enjoy!

These were FANTASTIC!  I read through a lot of reviews before making them and combined some of the ideas.  I'll save you the time here... 
     You definitely want to sautee the onions, it makes a big difference.  Combine the sauteed onions and leftover chicken in the food processor, it will improve the texture and help the patties stay together.  I used savory herb stuffing in place of the bread crumbs.  I also added fresh parmesan cheese, oregano, basil, and some garlic powder.  My mix was a little dry at this point so I added some chicken stock. 
     Here is the key...Mix all of the ingredients together EXCEPT FOR THE EGG!!!  TASTE IT!  If it doesn't taste good at this point, it won't taste any better when you cook it:) Season it until it tastes good, then add the eggs. I baked mine on a cookie sheet at 350 until they were golden brown(about 20 minutes).   
     Thanks for a great recipe and thank you to all of the reviewers before me for their tweaks:)

In my opinion, this recipe is a good starter, but it can become fabulous with a bit of tweaking. Hereâ€™s what I did to add a bit more flavor and much more moisture. To enhance the flavor, I added a 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, a pinch of celery seed, and a dash or two of cayenne pepper to the chicken mixture. To add moisture to the croquettes, I decreased the breadcrumbs by a 1/2 cup and made a roux by melting a stick of butter and whisking in a 1/2 cup of flour, a 1/2 cup of milk, and a 1/2 cup of chicken broth. I whisked the mixture over low heat until thick and smooth and allowed it to cool for about 15 minutes. Then I added the cooled roux to the chicken mixture.  I covered the mixture and allowed it to set in the fridge for about two hours. Later I shaped the mixture into patties and browned them on both sides. These croquettes were much better than the first ones I made. Perhaps these suggestions will help

What an easy little recipe - and a great way to use up leftover chicken. I've never had croquettes before and found these a little dry (I ran out of eggs), but my husband liked them enough to take the leftovers to work for lunch. He only does this with leftovers he really, really likes. I added some additional seasonings and parmesan cheese as well. I will definitely try these again, only make sure I have enough eggs on hand first!

Kudos to the reviewer who suggested using the mini chopper to process the chicken and onion. I did the same and it made working with the chicken really easy.

This was a really great way to use up some leftover rotisserie chicken!  It was very tasty!  Instead of frying, I made the croquettes, rolled them in breadcrumbs and baked at 350 for about 30 minutes.  They were SO tasty!

Excellent base for chicken croquettes, but I had to add spices to make it more interesting.  Based on other reviewers, I added a third egg, some parmesan, some basil and oregano.  It was fantastic!  I served it with cranberry sauce.

Next time I think I will add some pistachios, and cardamom to give it a Moroccan feel, or else some curry powder, turmeric, and paprika for an Indian taste.

I thought this was a good recipe, but I would add an extra egg next time I make it.

Also, I made my own seasoned bread crumbs with some French bread, Jane's Crazy Mixed Up Salt, basil, garlic powder and Parmesan cheese.

The next time I make, I'll put the fried patties in a shallow casserole dish, put in some spaghetti sauce and top each patty with a slice of Mozzarella cheese.  I'm sure 30 minutes in a 350 degree oven will heat the sauce and melt the cheese.

So hard to find a "different" recipe for left over chicken (or turkey etc.,) but this one is a keeper!  I did not have to adjust any of the ingredients; these patties were so tasty and just right.  Hats off to you Jeanne!

Awesome idea using left over chicken to make chicken croquettes.  As a big fan of salmon croquettes, I loved the recipe.  I didn't use parsley.  I used flour instead of breadcrumbs.  To moisten patties, I added chicken broth instead of more eggs.  Many thanks for the creative idea.  I will definitely make them again when I have left over chicken.

Excellent.  I added some slivered almonds, onion and mozzerella cheese.  This makes a lot of croquettes.  I would make again.

Really yummy.  I found that if I put the patties in my George Foreman and grill them, they are even better than frying.  The croquettes are not greasy that way, but not dry either. They are totally yummy.

What a great recipe.  I was out of breadcrumbs so I used finely crushed Peppridge Farm stuffing.  I sauteed a little celery and poultry seasoning with the onion. I used the 3rd egg and a splash of 1/2 and 1/2. It really helps to read the reviews before you make the recipe, as other good cooks have already tried and tweaked.

This recipe was a delicious and easy way to use my leftover chicken! I roast a chicken usually once per week and always end up with either chicken salad or chicken and rice the next day. I was so bored with it! These croquettes are fantastic and utilize ingredients that most people will already have on hand. I used three large eggs and a little less than the recommended amount of breadcrumbs. I added a dash of garlic powder as well. Next time I will probably add a little more garlic and maybe toss in other spices too. I can also see several different ways to serve these-- with cranberry sauce or gravy, baked with mozzarella/sauce (as previously mentioned), with ham and melted swiss, or even on a sandwich. I personally ate my share with some homemade honey mustard for dipping. (My husband had them plain) The croquettes also reheat well (I stuck them in the toaster oven for a few minutes wrapped in foil) 5 stars for a great recipe!

Have made these a number of times and they are always good.  Each time, I vary it according to what's on hand and what I feel like adding.  Just tonight, I mashed a cooked potato into it, used panko instead of seasoned bread crumbs, added Parmesan, Sriracha and Worcestershire sauce and left out the salt and pepper.  Delicious!

As others have said, a great basic recipe!  I doctored it a bit, in part because I didn't have seasoned bread crumbs, and also because of previous reviews mentioning these were a bit bland.  Nothing big--threw a generous amount of Italian seasoning in with the bread crumbs, and sauteed some garlic & celery along with the chopped onion.  Definitely needed 3 eggs and I used a bit of milk along with.  Made the patties a bit thin (per review that said they didn't cook all the way thru)--so I ended up with approx 10 patties total.  This turned out well!  My husband loved it, asked me to be sure to keep this recipe!  He ate 4 patties for dinner and took leftovers with him for lunch today!!  Thank you, Jeanne, for a def "keeper"!

This recipe turned out to be like eating raw dough, even though I cooked it as directed.  It was dry, heavy and did not have much taste.  I would not make this again and actually am sorry I wasted three cups of good leftover chicken on it. They ended up in the trash.

This was a very good base recipe. I had some left over rotisserie chicken and was trying to find something to make with it... I altered the recipe to work with items I already had in my kitchen. I didn't have any bread crumbs... but I had some garlic & onion croutons which I ground up in my food processor, and those worked great! I seasoned it with some fresh ground pepper, Italian seasoning, Parmesan cheese,  dried parsley flakes, and a dash of creole seasoning. I also used 3 eggs, since 2 still made it too dry. I baked it at 350 for 12 minutes, then took it out and added some mozzarella on top, put it back in for 5 minutes to melt... then added some spaghetti sauce and a tad more mozzarella and a sprinkle of garlic powder and parmesan then baked it for another 7 minutes. In then end, it turned out wonderfully! My fiance and I loved them!

The first time that I made it I added more spices (according to some of the other reviews) and the taste was over powering. I would recommend sticking to the original recipe, it tastes much better.

These were yummy.  Based on the reviews I made a few minor changes.  I added 2 eggs plus a bit of egg beaters.  I added italian seasoning and sage to my breadcrumbs as I was using plain.  I only added 1 cup of breadcrumbs because I only had 2.5 cups of chicken.  I sauteed my onions with garlic in butter.  I added dried parsley.  I fried these in oil on the stove and they came out delicious with a nice crust, and moist and flavourful on the inside.  I like the idea someone posted about serving this with melted cheese and pasta sauce, but I just served mine on the side of some veggies.

I see from reading the comments I should have noted I use extra-large eggs. Also, a simple sauce to go with it: (1) blanch almonds; (2) in a jar (or other closeable container) place 1 tbs cornstarch and add 2 oz water; shake well; (3) in a saucepan, bring milk to just a warm temperature, add cornstarch/water and stir until desired thickness; (4) remove from heat and add blanched almonds. Salt and pepper to taste.

I added spices. I used 1 cup of chopped rotisserie chicken (I cooked), 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder, 1/4 teaspoon onion powder, 1/2 teaspoon dried parsley, 1/4 cup of breadcrumbs and 1 egg. I also added a dash of salt and pepper. I shaped them into 2 patties and cooked them on medium heat with a lid over them, flipping them once. I skipped the white sauce, and served them with marble cheddar cheese.  I didn't find them bland or dry.

If I hadn't made white (southern) gravy to go with it, the dog would have gotten most of this.  I used italian seasoned bread crumbs, but it was still boring & bland.  Only positive I have to say for it is that it makes a lot - ten patties - fills a twelve inch pan - & is inexpensive.  Re-review:  My teenage boy likes them okay.  :/  I made again subbing half cup minced (yes, really.  It was already cooked & chilled) brown rice & a fourth cup italian bread crumbs.  I added a little parmesan cheese to the mix, too.  Still no "wow's," but he still ate them.  :)

We liked this recipe, and will definitely make it again when I have a quantity of leftover chicken. I read quite a few of the reviews and used some of the suggestions.....such as putting chicken in cuisinart, along with some leftover potatoes and some walnuts (for a needed crunch). I used 3 eggs and glad I did. I also sauteed the onions, green pepper, and garlic and added to chicken mixture. I used 2 cups of chicken and it made 6 good sized patties. Baked them on a sprayed pan for 30 min at 350, turning once. I topped with a homemade white sauce, however next time I'll try some whole cranberry sauce. These are hardy and tasty. They can easily be tweaked to your own taste. Give it a try!

This is a wonderful way to use leftovers! I followed the directions listed by cooking cutie concerning the roux,and also added basil, oregano, garlic, thyme to the dry mix. The roux does keep the patties moist. Also if you have a food processor,definitely use that to chop up the chicken, it really helps. I didn't have onions on hand so I used French's Fried Onions. Honestly this will taste wonderful no matter what spices you decide to use. I read someone's review that mentioned using stuffing instead of breading, I think I will give that a try next time.

These are so good!  My husband made these for us and he added garlic, parmesan and we topped the final product with marinara sauce.  It tasted like chicken parmesan and I can't wait to make these again!

Great base recipe. You can put whatever you like in it. I like more texture so instead of a fine chop I just loosely shredded my leftover rotisserie chicken meat. I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs and 3 eggs. I cut down on the minced onion to 1/4 cup, and added chives, green onion, plus freshly chopped tomato. Definitely add cheese if you can--it makes a difference. I added 1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese and fat chunks of provolone cheese. I made them into little crab cake sized patties and lightly fried them. The boyfriend loves theses, especially the cheesey bites. Maybe I'll try adding ham or bacon too next time.

Love the simplicity of this recipe!  The only changes I made were to substitute crushed seasoned boxed stuffing for the breadcrumbs, and serve with a side of cranberry sauce.  A rotissiere chicken made this the easiest meal yet. Thank you!!

Finally, a successful leftover recipe that didn't require a trip to the store for extra ingredients!  I had to use three eggs, and next time I would probably follow a previous reviewer's suggestion and add some chicken broth, too.  I didn't have seasoned bread crumbs, so I used the regular ones and doubled the parsley.  This was a great recipe for the last of the Thanksgiving turkey (when we were all really quite tired of leftovers)!  I also want to try some of the other recommendations like cheese and marinara sauce.  For the kids, it was good with ketchup, too, so I can see this being a versatile recipe.

GOOD STARTING POINT for your own ideas.  Use the chicken, breadcrumbs and eggs as your base.  Add any veggies, spices or herbs you like.  I have a 2yr old and a 9yr old so for them I drop the onions and parsley and just add fresh chopped cilantro, salt and pepper.  MEAT GRINDER IDEA: If you have a meat grinder put some of the leftover chicken through then add the bread crumbs, eggs and herbs. Leave some chicken to put through at the end to clear out the grinder pipe.  Don't want it dry?  Always add another egg if you think it's too dry.

This is a great idea for leftover chicken. I spiced it up a bit for my tastebuds by adding sundried tomatoes, pepperoni, and oregano.  I added plenty of eggs and let sit overnight.  The patties stayed together nicely when frying.  The trick is to shred the meat, do not chop.

These were pretty good.  This time I added only 2 big cloves of garlic.  Next time I think I would add minced sweet red pepper and jalepeno to give it some zip.  A bit tricky flipping them over in the pan.  I used two spatulas to gently flip and slide them back into the oil.  Otherwise they crack easily.  Not a bad alternative though to chicken salad which is what I usually do with leftover chicken.

This was very good - and mother-in-law and husband approved!  :)  I used leftover turkey and minced it.  I didn't have bread crumbs so I ground up some chicken flavored stuffing until it was like breadcrumbs and used it.  Having done that, I should have used less onion, but they still turned out tasty!  I will definitely make these again.

AWESOME RECIPE!  Simple and tasty.  We added 1/2 cup of shredded cheese before making patties and the texture and taste were incredible. Thanks--- this one will be a repeat at our house.

I made these for dinner tonight.  I tore the meat off of a full leftover breast, half a breast and a thigh and then put in my little electric chopper to grind fine.  I only used 2 eggs and 1 cup of bread crumbs.  I added a little poultry seasoning, garlic salt and Mrs Dash.  I did not sautee the onions.  I put the mixture in the frig to chill and that made it easier to form into patties and they stayed together.  I served mashed potatoes, gravy and peas with them.  My picky son did not try one but my daughter and husband loved them.  I thought they could use a little more flavor so next time I'll experiment.  Definitely an easy meal and good way to use up leftover chicken.

This recipe is great.  I didn't have fresh chicken, so I used canned white meat chicken (make sure to rinse it really well to get rid of some of the salt) and dried minced onions.  I topped it with creamed peas from this site. My family went nuts over it:)

I thought this was very good.  I used my mini chopper to get the onion and chicken chopped fine enough. We served it with sour cream.  My one complaint is it didn't hold it's form once you cut into it as well as I had hoped.  Still great though.

These are so good!  I followed the recipe just as is and it was perfect. While using raw onion as Grrlfriend did is a great timesaver, I found that sauteeing them adds quite a bit of flavor.  We had these with mashed potatoes and chicken gravy - real good comfort food as we are buried with snow up here in the Northeast.

This recipe is very simple. Instead of using leftover chicken, I used Lois Rich's pre-cooked sliced chicken. I popped the onions and chunked chicken into a food processor, ground them up until no more chunks were visible and added the rest of the ingredients. I served this dish with garlic potatoes and steamed asparagus. The family loved it! Thanks for the great recipe.

I wasn't sure what to expect so they were okay but not great like other posters raved about.  I took hints from the other reviewers and added more seasoning.  I

I used 1/2 c chicken boullion along with the 2 eggs and it was plenty moist.  I only used about 1/2 cup onion and found it too much for my liking.  I was short on breadcrumbs and used 1/2 pkg. stovetop ground up but that may have dominated the flavour. 

My teens don't like onion and were picking it out unfortuantely.  (I didn't use a food processor).  I'd hoped my husband would love them.  He said, "It's better than hamburger helper." 

I'm just happy to make something from scratch and use up my rotissery chicken from last night, which was exactly 3 cups.  I don't think I would ruin chicken breasts for this.  It is similar to chicken parmagian so I would have just breaded the breast.

Would I make again?  Perhaps I'd try altering the recipe again on leftover chicken and see what happens next time.  Like another poster said, messes up the kitchen and a bit time consuming.

A great recipe for left over chicken. I used wholemeal breadcrumbs and after forming, rolled them in breadcrumbs to coat, then left them in the fridge for a couple of hours to firm up a little. I did have to use a third egg but once I had done that they didn't turn out dry. I gave the cooked croquettes a spritz of lemon juice which really perked them up. All kinds of things could be added if you wanted to tweak this recipe. A little sage would be great to make them like chicken with stuffing croquettes. Next time I shall try a little red Thai curry paste to make them Thai spicy.

I agree that, as written, this recipe would be pretty bland and dry... Both things, though, are crazy easy to fix. Add spices till they taste good. If you had a spicy roast chicken, youll probably need to add less flavor. then add eggs. Then only add enough breadcrumbs so they stay together! (and ps. Once I made these after a stuffed chicken supper. DO add the stuffing instead of all the breadcrumbs.   My 2and 3yr olds couldn't get enough!

These were so yummy, I did however make a few changes. First I used canned chicken that I had in the pantry. Then made my own seasoned breadcrumbs, to a half cup of breadcrumbs I added two palmfuls of garlic powder, one palmful of cumin, and one palmful of mesquite grill seasoning so actually I had 3/4 cup of breadcrumbs instead of a 1/2 cup of breadcrumbs. Didn't have fresh onions so I used minced. Also as others suggested I added about 1/2 cup of shredded cheese. I needed 3 eggs, but I think that was due to the extra breadcrumbs. Fried these for about 3 minutes on each side and they came out so good. The mesquite seasoning made it so good because you could definetly taste it in the "cakes". Will definetly make this again.

This recipe was very good, and definitely an easy way to use leftover chicken.  They were a bit dry.  The only change I made was to bake them instead of frying them, at 350 degrees for 30 minutes.  I would bake them again instead of frying them, but next time I make them I'll serve with some kind of sauce.  And there will be a next time; these were very good!

I thought this to be awful. It was very dry. I had spiced it up by having some Cheddar cheese on top, too. The only flavor seemed to be whatever you fried it with. In my case, a cheap frying oil. Should have used butter.I'll go back to baking the croquettes and serving a nice gravy. Oh well, live & learn.

I found this by chance just glancing and I had leftover rotiserie chicken in the fridge and all the other ingredients. I made it and my family LOVED it! I added some cajun seasoning because I add it to all food and it was delicious and I did make some cream and chicken soup to dip them in for the kids and it was a hit. I will make this every time I buy a chicken. Thank you!!

After reading others' reviews, we added 2 Tbsp diced green onion, 2 tsp diced green chiles, 1/4 tsp ground red pepper, 1/4 tsp oregano, 1/4 tsp basil, and 1/4 cup  Parmesan/Romano cheese; then sauteed 2 cloves crushed garlic with the red onion & deglazed the pan with white wine; added 1/4 tsp cajun seasoning, 1 Tbsp white wine worchestershire, and 1 tsp habanero sauce; used 1/4 cup egg substitute per egg; and sprinkled sesame seeds on top before frying in 1/2 and 1/2 olive oil and margarine.  The patties were kept warm in a 200 degree oven till all were done.  They were served over pasta with roasted chicken/hunter gravy over the top.  We cut the recipe to 4 servings and it still made 10 patties--Plenty for lunch tomorrow!  Parmesan cheese and sour creme were offered at the table.  Next time we'll add even more habanero or other hot sauce or seasoning.

These are yummy. I didn't use as much chicken because I was just cooking for my boyfriend and I. I used 2 eggs and thought that it could use another one. Next time I will add another to make sure they are nice and moist. I added a bunch of random herbs and I added chopped green onion and chopped fresh chives to the regular onions. I served it with left over pecan and raisin sweet potato bake, spinach salad and cranberry sauce. Cranberry sauce is really good with these!

Great recipie !! I added 2 cloves of garlic minced with the onions, and after cooking them put them in a caserole dish and smothered them in chicken gravy ( made with canned chicken broth and roux) and kept them warm in the oven  ( about 15 minutes ) till the baked potatoes were ready, They were awesome !!!!

This was so good that my VERY PICKY kids actually ate it!  I found that it had even more flavor the next day for lunch.  I used equal amounts of light and dark meat turkey (from thanksgiving) and the thanksgiving gravy.  Great way to use up leftovers.  I will definitely make this again.

My husband liked this better than I did..so gave it a 3-star rating rather than 2-star.  I did substitute chopped cilantro for the parsley, but I were to make this recipe again, I would add some additional zing with spices (Italian, or Mexican, or maybe a tiny amt of Wasabi!).

Nothing to write home about. It's a great way to use up leftover Turkey though. That's what I used and served it with turkey gravy. My kindergartener
thought it was good. I'll probably not make it with chicken but will use this recipe when I have left over turkey again.

This is VERY good stuff. My husband and I both loved them. We don't have a lot of time and this is good to throw together the night before and cook after work. Good with gravy as well as alone!One of my favorite ways to use leftover chicken.

I took this recipe for inspiration as I do most recipes.  I took the leftover to heart and combined some odd flavors.  But I think as I now (after reading) realize many suggestions were made for different combinations.  I thought the chicken might be bland so I added chopped jalapenos, sun dried tomato, black olives.  I did not use as many bread crumbs and I did not puree anything.  I roughly chopped the left over rotisserie chicken I got from Sams Club and for sure saute the onion.  BUT I forgot to add salt or parsley so 1/2 way thru I used celery salt instead cuz I had no parsley and didn't realize I was so low on salt.  Salt is important!! the ones without rely heavily on the jalapeno to flavor it.  Not sure it worked, but its a great little recipe to expand as others have done.  A different way to deal with leftovers for sure!  Next time I think cranberries and walnuts or something crispy.  My mind is running with it.

Made this for dinner tonight.  Used dried parsley because I didn't have fresh, and used Panko bread crumbs.  Hubby and I thought this recipe was worth making again.  I think I will add some chopped bell pepper and a little garlic next time.  Good use of leftover chicken!

After reading some of the reviews I realized that you can make this taste however you want! I love this recipe. I used leftover Huli Huli chicken (Hawiian flavors) so needed to adjust the recipe to match the chickens flavor.

I added carmalized onions, roasted red peppers, chipotle pepper, garlic, cumin, salt, emerils creole seasoning, cilantro, shredded cheddar cheese, the bread crumbs, and 2 eggs. I then formed them into the traditional croquette form, covered with panko, and baked in the oven for 30 min at 350.

They were moist and crunchy on the outside! Yummy!

Great use of chicken meat from a store bought roasted chicken. I cook for 2 and end up with alot of chicken.I reserve most of the remaining meat and can use it in a recipe like this.
I always make broth from the carcass, so I used the meat picked from those bones to make a puree, then added the egg ( 1/4c egg substitute) and pureed some more ...no need for breadcrumbs!  Chopped red pepper with the onions and some cilantro.
It was delicious on top of brown rice with Salsa topping, a little low fat cheddar on top and a dollop of nonfat sour cream.

We liked these! I used rotisserie chicken from the deli, my own homemade bread crumbs mixed with a little parmesean cheese, and added a little garlic powder.  Served with rosemary red potatoes from this site and garlic grean beans.  Will make again!

my whole family really enjoyed these.  i was searching for something different and something that wasn't too terrible nutritionally.  these were easy, delicously different, and quite healthy, which is such a great combo!! :) i used 3 eggs to get them to come together and they formed very easily into the patties. i used the spices as directed in the recipe but think i might alter it a little next time for personal taste.  we served with some chicken gravy and mashed potatoes.  yumm!!

This was great.  I'm no great cook by far and pulled this off.  For anyone with an electric stove and no thermometer I turned mine to high for the right oil temp.  This was the first time I've made bread crumbs and added some parmesan cheese, thyme and garlic salt.

This was pretty good. Added Italian bread crumbs for more flavor and did end up using two eggs. Added a spash of hot sauce and a dash of Worcestershire sauce.

yum yum yum :)
great idea for leftover chicken, usually i add mayonnaise and black olives and make sandwiches :) I did mince the chicken and eggs as 1 member suggested and added onion powder, garlic powder and dried parsley... then i made the pattied quite thin, like a 2 cm thickness and they were delicious :)
thanx!!

I would actually give this 3 1/2 stars.

This is a very basic recipe, something to build upon. I too found it bland but I know my family will love it.

I think to perk it up you could try the following:

Add an envelope of dry ranch dressing mix and omit the salt

Add an envelope of Italian dressing mix and omit salt

Add some salsa and some fresh cilantro

Add a little sour cream and some fresh chopped chives

And I'm an amateur

I used fresh bread crumb and ran everything through the food processor. Very easy that way.

There's a lot you could do with the recipe. Thanks for posting this. It's a keeper.

Easy to make and pretty tasty.  I've made chicken croquettes before and the recipes have all been a lot more involved.  This one was very easy.  I recommend that you shape the patties very small, not too thick.

This is a great base recipe; thanks! I also added spices,(oregano, thyme and cayenne pepper), as well as a T of prepared mustard and two T of mayo. My very picky father and refined husband loved them. Leftovers were great on a bun w/ melted cheese.

I am glad I read the reviews before trying this.  3 eggs are required.  I served the croquettes with hot sauce, green salad for a light meal.  The dish is easy, very tasty and received complements from my family.  I will definitely make this again.

I loved this recipe! My kids who are picky eaters loved it too - even my daughter had three which is nearly a miracle. I did two things differently: used chopped onion that wasn't sauteed but chopped so that it was extremely fine and didn't use as much bread crumbs but only because I ran out. Next time I will need to double the recipe to make sure everyone gets enough and maybe have a couple left for lunch the next day!

This is a nice easy recipe! I used italian bread crumbs, so the flavour was great. I served it over noodles with a mushroom sauce...everyone loved it. What a great way to use up left over chicken.

My husband liked this more than I did, but he covered his with hot sauce so I don't know how he even tasted them. I would make it again when I had leftover chicken, but I would add some hot sauce to the mixture and possibly some garlic because it did seem to lack some flavor. BTW, I used rotisserie chicken and cilantro in place of the parsley.

A nice and easy recipe for leftover chicken, though I did have to add more egg than was called for to get the patties to stick together.  Thanks!

This recipe was so good. My husband and I have chicken at least 2 or 3 times a week and this was a good change. If anyone doesn't like salmon croquettes or even if you do, you will like this recipe.

Thank you for sharing this recipe Jeanne! I had 2 cups of leftover rotisserie chicken and all the ingredients for your recipe. Although I didn't strictly follow your ingredient list and minced everything into more of a smooth paste, this is a great base for croquettes. I added a whole bunch of extra herbs and spices - garlic, tandoori, cilantro, cayenne and a splat of honey. Hubby loved these, so I'll be making again.

Great use for leftovers!  I would suggest adding some chicken broth as they are a bit dry but taste good despite the dryness.

just made these.  solid 4 stars based on the additions from the reviews.  Like many ppl i added Parmesan cheese, italian seasoning & chicken stock. i tasted it before i added the egg.  Flavor wise, i would give this 5 stars.  texture wise it's a 3, which is why i net out at a 4.  I couldn't get a super good crust on it, i guess i would have to deep fry it, which i didn't want to do to keep it healthy.  when i think croquettes, i think crunchy, crispy, which these weren't exactly.  but they taste great and are worth making.

I played with this recipe... swapped out the leftover chicken for cooked Johnsonville Sweet Italian Sausage. I did add the extra egg. Served with a side of mashed potatoes and gravy... it is like thanksgiving!!! My whole family LOVED IT! I would definitely recommend using Johnsonville sausage for this recipe!!

Made these last night and they were very good--- great way to use up leftover rotisserie chicken.  Since reading the other reviews, I added about 1/3 cup Parmesan cheese and I also added celery to the onion mixture.  It was too dry with 2 eggs so I added chicken broth instead of another egg.  Turned out well!

Loved this = used dried parsley and a bit of Italian herbs, chilled after made into patties, then dipped in buttermilk and coated with panko and chilled again until dinner time. Skillet cooked in butter/olive oil 
- hubby said I should be a cooking teacher - he LOVED it and wants the leftovers (leftover leftovers - lol) for lunch tomorrow.  Served with simple spaghetti (w/capers, dried tomatoes, and sauteed garlic) and mixed steamed veggies

My variation on this good recipe.  Sauteed about 2 cups chopped onions.  Toward the end of sauteeing, added some Italian seasoning, some taco seasoning, little garlic powder, about 1/3 can mild green chillies, 2 tbl. pimento.  After that, added one can of chunky canned chicken (Costco), chopping it down a little.  Let everything blend a little.
Removed the whole mixture to a mixing bowl.  Added 1-extra large beaten egg, Italian bread crumbs to help in forming patties.  Used Panko crumbs to coat the patties before frying until golden brown.  Made about 6 patties.  Turned out tasty!

These are a great starter! I did tweek it a tiny, tiny bit by adding a fresh jalapeno diced up. I think next time i might add a dash of red pepper for a bit more spice. Thanks sooo much for an easy recipe to use up leftover rotisserie chicken.

These were good,  i added a little garlic, and some mushrooms to the onions, i also used dried parsley. I just think that something is missing, maybe some kind of sauce, i served eith some mexican crema flavored with pepper garlic salt and lemon. Yep i will make this again, it beat chicken salad sandwiches all the time!

A great way to use up leftover chicken.  2 eggs didn't seem to be enough.  Ended up using 3.  Old Bay adds a little kick.  :-)

What a great basic recipe with hugh potential. You can take this recipe and create anything you want out of it. I used all of the basic ingredients, took advice from others (put the chicken and onions through the food processor), and used whatever I had around the kitchen, and then I baked the patties instead of frying them (350 degree for 24 minutes worked for me). Even the kids loved it!

On the advice of others, I added basil, garlic powder, oregano and another egg.  I also decided to bake them as suggested.  Didn't work.  Mine after baking for 20 minutes were really hard.  I sprayed the pan and the top of them with Pam before putting in the oven - maybe that was my mistake.  I loved the taste however next time I will panfry them.

Really good recipe...read the reviews first! Especially cookingcutie's. I sauteed onions and a stalk of celery in margarine. Added flour then milk and broth to make a roux.  I used delicious smoked/BBQ chicken that my husband made last night. I served them over mashed potatos and chicken gravy. Soooo good!

We loved them!!  I had some leftover chhicken and a can of chicken, I used both to make my 3 cups.  I ended up using 3 eggs with a little milk also.  I didn't have any onion, but I had some french fried onions that I added in.  I made a little gravy to go on them too.  GREAT way to use left over chicken.

We enjoyed this.  I used two leftover baked chicken breasts.  They were already well seasoned so I omitted the salt.  It was a great opportunity for me to use my food processor.  I just put everything in the processor, pulsed a few times and it was well mixed.  Like others have said, it is a great base.  Next time I may add green peppers, celery and raw onions instead of sautÃ©ed.

This recipe also works as a Passover recipe - great usage for that boiled chicken from the soup.  Substitute matza meal for the bread crumbs (I think I used about 1 cup).  I also sauteed garlic and chopped mushrooms with the onions.  Best leftover chicken recipe I know!

I subbed 1/3 cup of matzoh meal for the breadcrumbs.  I added 1 T. of Exotic Mushroom Rub (Rub with Love).  After patties were assembled I let them rest 5 minutes on wax paper, and sprinked them with a scant amount of matzoh meal, and then paprika--on both sides before frying. They were beautiful and tasty.

I made these last night with left over Turducken.  They were really good even my very pickey stepson had seconds.  I used italian seasoned bread crumbs and had marinara sauce on top too. I think that you really need 3 eggs and tase your breadcrumbs before you add the salt.  I did not and they were a bit on the salty side.

I used chicken and vegeables (mushrooms, onion, garlic) leftover from a crockpot dish.  Just added the egg and breadcrumbs.  Rave review..especially with a side of BBQ sauce!  The possibilities are endless.

Used no parsley, I didn't have any. Sauteed diced onion and bell peppers in olive oil before adding to chicken/breadcrumb mixture. Husband made a nice sauce to go along. It was delicious. Kids love them two. They resembled crab cakes, too me. Will make again.

This recipe is wonderful.  Its a family pleaser. I use it often.  The croquettes can be frozen and are a great re-heat in the microwave. Great alternative for a decent fast meal for those nights when the family is on the go.

My family loves this recipe!  I use crushed Stovetop stuffing instead of bread crumbs for more flavor, and add about a 1/3 cup of prepared gravy to eliminate the patty dryness.  Delicious!

I really wanted to like these. The texture was very dry, even after adding two extra eggs and extra onion. They also required a LOT of fat in which to brown them. We served them with chicken gravy otherwise they would have been way too dry.

I was afraid the patties would be dry, so I made a cream sauce to go over it and my husband loved it.  The leftover chicken had been marinated in Dale's sauce (a soy based marinade, yummy) so I added a little ginger to the cream sauce and it was a nice enhancement.  I used heavy cream, chicken broth, salt, pepper, and the ginger and whisked it over medium heat, added a little flour for thickening.  This was a fun, new way to serve leftovers.

I just made this tonight and LOVED it. I thought I had bought parsley, but it ended up that I grabbed the orangno. It was great EVEN with the addition of oragno. Wonderful recipe. My husband and I are snacking on this as I type :) Thank you!!

Pretty good. I have made these a couple of times, and I think they turned out much better this time than they did the first time I made them. My fiance thought they were good but a little bit bland - the next time I make them, I'll probably add some sauteed sweet pepper to dress it up a bit. He dipped his in ranch dressing, I ate mine without. Either way,  this is good eating!

I thought this recipe was easy to make and I would definately make it again.  I scaled the recipe down to 2 servings and that was plenty for me and my boyfriend w/ leftovers for tomorrow.  I used 3/4 cup onion and added salt and pepper while I was beating the eggs...2 are enough.  Thanks for sharing!

This tasted very goodâ€”a little better than expected. I used many of the tweaks others suggested, such as an extra egg, garlic powder, and baking them. I ended up frying then in a skillet for a couple of minutes to get a little more crunch. They tasted great.

Excellent recipe! I didn't change a thing. I have been looking for a way to use up chicken that I've either roasted or Insta pot so I could get the chicken broth. One chicken goes s long way when there's only two of you. This was perfect! Easy to make and can be frozen. Delishous!

I gave this recipe a 5 mainly because it's a recipe that has stood the test of time,  I remember my mother making these when I was a child during WWII,  we always had fresh chickens available, she made them the old fashioned way shaped into cones and her ingredients were very much the same with I believe the addition of sage. She always added a little gravy on top along with homemade cranberry/orange sauce.  We weren't as "health conscience" in those days so she always fried hers, she died at 100 years old two years ago.  I fried mine too, I love the crispiness and I rolled my cakes in a bit of crushed Ritz crackers. Yum.

I was looking for something to do with leftover chicken because our 3 year old doesnâ€™t do well with plain meat. I left out the onion and added a dash of cayenne because I was in a hurry. The teenager and the little one both enjoyed these. Iâ€™ve always made tuna patties this way but never thought of using chicken. I think these will be a staple around here.

Great recipe for leftover chicken! Added a little Cajun spices and I needed an extra egg, but that may have been because I only had Panko breadcrumbs on hand.  Reminded me of the crab/seafood cakes we frequently make.

This would be 5 stars, except it didn't glue together very well (a fairly common issue, I understand).  The combination of ingredients/flavors was excellent, however.  I think next time I'm going to use chickpea flour instead of breadcrumbs.

This was delicious! I used only one cup of breadcrumbs, half an onion sautÃ©ed, three eggs, added dried basil and oregano, added nutritional yeast and baked for 20 mins in the oven. It was a hit!

When we make chicken stock no one wants to eat the chicken afterwards. This is by far the best way to leverage that chicken and not throw it away!

I made this last week for my husband and I.  It was very tasty and a nice change for our usual chicken fare.  My only concern was that the patties didn't hold their shape. I used panko crumbs instead of bread crumbs and added an egg to help with the cohesiveness of the ingredients.  Mistakes on my part.  They were quite tasty and will serve them again.

Quick to make!  I chopped my chicken in the food processor and then added chopped peeled roasted poblano peppers.  I will make again for sure.

We LOVED this recipe.  It was the first time eating chicken croquettes and making them.  I had 3.5 cups of leftover chicken and wanted something quick and easy and NOT a casserole.   My result looked like your picture for the recipe (wow!) and it tasted wonderful.  My husband put horseradish on his croquettes and was making happy sounds.  I didn't deviate much from the recipe, we love coarse black pepper and so I was a little more liberal there.

We didn't like these. I may have processed everything too fine in the food processor, so this may be partly user error. I used a bit less the the 1 1/2 C of seasoned breadcrumbs, but that was mostly what I tasted. I used 3 eggs and some chicken stock and  they were a bit crumbly after baking.

OMGosh! After reading reviews, I agreed with most that adding more herbs and spices would make these even better. And they were right! 

Jeanne Gold, I love that you came up with this! I smoked 2 whole chickens over the weekend and naturally, there was some leftover. This recipe is such a perfectly wonderful base. Thank you for posting this. 

Next time I plan on making a simple creamy tomato sauce with fresh mozzarella melted on top.

I didn't have enough onions but used what was available along with a lot of fresh garlic.  I added some poultry seasoning and some dried thyme. Next time I will boost the herbs have plenty of onion on hand. It's a good recipe, I think it needs more seasonings.

The only change I made was using dried parsley instead of fresh, only because I didn't have it! These are the tastiest things and I appreciate you sharing this great recipe. Nice to have something like this to use up left over chicken. The hubby loved them... definitely going to make them again!

I think this will be a staple in our house. We have grown so burnt out on my go to baked chicken, that this will use up the left overs in a very nice way. Due to the rigors of domestic life that I will spare you, I didn't sautee the onions. I can imagine the taste would be greatly improved by doing so. I bet it would be great with some green or red peppers. The recipe says it was adapted from a version with salmon...which I will have to try! It would be bomb with some salamon and a side of asparagus. 
All it all, highly customizable and tasty.

This was a hit at my house!! I agree w others that it needs to be tweaked, it is a little bland. I paired it w Chef John's Mushroom gravy.  It was almost like a 'Thanksgiving patty". Next time I will use dried stuffing mix for the bread crumbs & poultry seasoning and serve w cranberry sauce.

I disagree with using food processor for chicken. IMHO, it wld have a mussy 'cat food' texture.

Very good. Made changes based on what I had in the house and other reviews. For the onion: I used 1 cup sauteed yellow onion,  2 thinly sliced scallions, and used some carmelized onion I had in my freezer. Processed about 1 cup of the meat along with the carmelized onion in the food processor. Used herb flavored stuffing in place of bread crumbs. Added some fresh basil, dried oregano, garlic powder and Parmesan cheese. I used 3 eggs but added them last, AFTER I had already tasted the mixture and had it to my liking. Baked at 350* for 20 minutes. Served with Garlic Mayonnaise Aioli from this site (to which I did 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 mayo, used 4 roasted garlic cloves and added smoked paprika). Yummy Dish!

Very low sodium with adjustments. Yum! Tweaked as follows: Sauteed 2 lg onions, diced, in 2 TBL butter. Added 1.5 cups Panko crumbs, 3 c finely chopped chicken and seasoned with 2 tsp poultry seasoning, generous shakes of celery seed, dill weed and fresh ground black pepper. Tasted good so added 3 eggs, made 17 patties. I baked them at 350 for 23 minutes on a sheet sprayed with Pam. I calculate sodium per patty as 30 mg. Delish as is, gravy would be a bonus

My first time making this and I loved it. Just heard about chicken croquettes over the weekend and had to make it. I used chicken in can (I drained the water) and I added a little chicken broth. I served the croquettes with vegetables. This will definitely be put in my rotation and will try it with turkey next. Thanks for a great recipe.

Okay a made this tonight with my own tweaks.. I sauted one small onion and one bell pepper than added 2 chopped cloves of garlic. Put about 1/8 cup in mixing bowl, rest in food processer . Diced part of the chicken put the rest in food processer except 1/2 cup in mixing bowl and processed it till fine texture, then added to mixing bowl..  I used Panko bread crumbs and 1 tps Italian seasoning, 3 eggs and mixed by hand ( a must)...they came out real good..

It's very hard to mess up chicken, I just wasn't very satisfied with the lack of crisp from the croquettes. Granted I did put them in the oven (as a healtheir, less messy alternative) I wish there had been a better way to crisp them in there. Will try different techniques on my next venture. So easy to make!

This is a great recipe for leftover chicken! I only had two cups of chicken so I only made 8 croquettes, but they were yummy! I will make this again.

I always add vegetables for a healthier option. Some scallions, shredded zucchini, shredded yams or anything I may have. I sometimes make my own bread crumbs. I have made this many times, always different from the last time. My whole family loves them. A staple for my leftover chicken. They freeze well also.

I hadn't had Chicken Croquettes since I was a kid in my mom's home...and she was an awful cook killing everything in oil in her electric Sunbeam Fryer...BUT I sensed...even then...that croquettes could be good...and your recipe was fantastic...Thanks-Ira.

currently making these and the first Patty's turned out really good and wanted to add my changes in case I make them again. I used stuffing for the bread crumbs and added shredded carrots because I didn't have any onions. Added a teaspoon of garlic and eyeballed the pepper. Used 3 eggs and added oregano and dried kale. I fried them with a bit of chicken fat from the roasted chicken we had the night before.  I'm going to make a gravy from the rest of the chicken fat. Let the egg soak into the bread crumbs. The Patty's stay together much better.

I used this as a "starter" recipe.  My food processor got a work out !  I ground my leftover chicken and ground the onions in the food processor before sauteing them. Ground up a stalk of celery fairly finely and used packaged seasoned stuffing mix and ground it up in the food processor as well.   As others have suggested, doing this makes for a more uniform consistency and makes it easier for the patties to stay together.   I had to use dried parsley as I didn't have any fresh.   I added garlic,  a little oregano and a pinch of cayenne.   I didn't really measure how much chicken, onion and stuffing mix I used, just dumped it all in a bowl once it was all ground up.  2 eggs left it a little dry, so I added a splash of home made chicken stock.  This time, I fried them in a little oil in a non-stick skillet, but next time will try baking them in the oven as others have suggested.  They were quite good fried, but I think baking them might be a nice option.   I had mine plain, but my hubby had his with some leftover white gravy with a hefty dose of coarse ground black pepper.  Both were good!   Thank you for a great "starter" recipe for chicken croquettes!

I too made some changes based on reviews.  I had some shallots on hand, so I sauteed 2 of those plus 2 small yellow onions and about 6 cloves of garlic in butter.  Added that to the chicken and seasoned with lots of salt and jarred pesto.  I appreciate the other review who said taste the mixture before adding the egg and make any necessary adjustments!  I'm glad I did because I needed to keep adding pesto to get the punch of flavor I was looking for.  Probably added about 1/3C total.  Added some shredded parmesan too.  Then added the 3 beaten eggs and bread crumbs, although I cut way back on the bread crumbs...probably only used 1/3C...can't imagine using 1.5C!  Fried them in vegetable oil on the stove, and they are delish!  Made a side of gnocchi tossed lightly in marinara.  Yummo!

I gave this three stars because my husband liked it though I tweaked the recipe as well.  It definitely needs more moisture and less bread crumbs.  As is, the recipe is quite bland.

Delicious! Used plain panko and seasoned it myself with garlic and thyme. I used cilantro instead of parsley. And I had to add an egg to the mixture because it wasn't sticky enough.

I used leftover rotisserie chicken.  I added 2 large cloves of garlic and 1/2 red pepper to the onions minced them well and cooked them gently until onion was translucent. I minced the chicken added the breadcrumbs, fresh parsley, basil, and chives then added oregano, cayenne, pepper, left out the salt. Tossed everything together tasted good, added three medium eggs from our chickens and made two test patties which I fried in a little olive oil.  Tasted good but I will make a hearty mushroom sauce to dress them with for dinner.  The original recipe lacked the savory touch my family loves.

I always follow the recipe the first time, and they were good, but there was something missing.  I added red pepper flakes the next go around, and that fixed the problem.

I had to use three eggs but it came out pretty good. Of corse my picky eating daughter didn't like it but everybody else did. I would recommend sautÃ©ing the ingredients first then mix in the chicken, eggs and bread crumbs last.

Ahh, this saved me from another quick egg dinner after a day at the  beach. I have lots of baked chicken leg quarters as I have an ederly dogs that I cook fresh stews for. So I knew I wanted to use some of that leftover baked chicken and this was perfect. I added basil from the garden, celery salt,Italian season- as my bread crumbs were plain. I served these with loaded mashed potatoes and roasted asparagus. I did change the servings to 3  and it made 5 croquettes which my hubby and I gobbled up! I used chickfilas sauce as a dip for the croquettes as well, it's a honeybbqmustard type sauce. I added a photo but couldn't alter the size on my iPad!

Sorry. I tried this and way too much onion, for one thing, and it needs a sauce of some sort to make it edible at all.  I love salmon patties and expected to love this.

Love this for leftovers! I use them like hamburgers! You can really play around with it too. I add some taco seasoning sometimes to the mixture for fun. A dollop of sour cream and a bun and its a great Saturday lunch!

I've made this twice now, both times in the oven. The first was pretty basic adding a few spices as directed in the comments. It was good but unimpressive. 
The second time I sauted onions, garlic, sweet pepper and celery. Added a splash of chicken broth along with the 2 eggs and a few left over canned mushroom pieces from the fridge. I added some Italian breadcrumbs that were mixed with parma cheese that I had left over for the dry base along with S&P,parsley, oregano, and basil for spice and mixed it all together topping with a thin slice of garden tomato, some mozzarella and a splash of spaghetti sauce on top. I made it in the morning and put the patties in the fridge till dinner time. Then cooked 30 minutes in the oven at 350. Served over a few egg noodles and it was wonderful!

I really liked this recipe...super easy! I had deboned a jumbo rotisserie chicken a few days ago and searched "shredded chicken" under ingredients and found this. I used the whole amount of chicken(I think it was closer to 4 cups) and followed the rest of the recipe's measurements. I got 16 3"(approx) cakes.

Tried this for a last minute meal and wow they are yummy! I took a few suggestions from other reviews. I did blend the chicken but not the onion. Also I added a few spices to my families liking (garlic powder, basil). I did keep the parsley, pepper and salt too. I did find that I needed another egg to keep them together. Didn't take long to whip up and was amazing. I used leftover roasted chicken from another recipe I found on this site (sticky rotisserie chicken).

I used turkey because that is what I had.  It still came out really good.  I added a few shakes of soy sauce, chopped garlic and cayenne pepper.  My family loved it!  I served them with cornbread (grandmother's buttermilk cornbread) and a garden salad.  Yummy!

I use this recipe all the time.  Any leftover chicken, I throw into a freezer bag until I have enough to make.  I use my own seasonings, to our personal tastes.  Sometimes I make a cheese sauce or white sauce to serve on top.  After preparing, these patties freeze well to heat up in a low oven and eat, again.  Thanks for sharing this.

I made these tonight and also ran through the reviews. What is great about this recipe is how versatile they are to do with what you want. I put my onions in processor and then sauteed them with olive oil and parsley paste...processed red bell pepper and I didn't saute these so they would retain a little crunch. I processed the chicken to a fine chop and then mixed it all together adding ginger paste, salt, pepper, dried basil, a dried garlic blend called Garlic Lover's Garlic by Oregon Flavor Rack, egg, and panko crumbs. I let it sit for about 15 minutes and pan fried them. I topped them with a mayo, lemon juice, garlic  blend. It was delicious and my 6 year old loved them. I am premaking uncooked patties to put into the freezer. They were great served with steamed broccoli with lemon juice and a small salad. We will do these again. I was thinking thai spices may be good too. The recipe was very inspirational!

I haven't had croquettes in over 30 years. Decided to try this recipe out and it came out perfectly!!! I added celery, parm cheese and chives to the recipe. I used a food chopper for the onions, chicken and celery. My family loved it. Hopefully it doesn't take another 30 years to eat this again!!!

These are really tasty! Turned out a tad dry for my tastes, but that probably depends on how you cook the chicken you use in the recipe.

Pretty good; nice and chickeny considering all the bread crumbs.  I needed three eggs and added celery, bell pepper and garlic to the saute. Used a generous sprinkling of seasoned salt. Served with barbecue sauce. Dad loved them...ate the whole thing!

I agree with most all of the other reviews. This is a perfect base for a wonderful dish! I personally chose to add onion and garlic powders, Italian seasoning, small hand full of shredded cheddar cheese and a few shakes of parm. Next time I make it I will try a few other ingredients. Either way this is a keeper!

Easy simple and anyone can add their own twist or any meat, fish or poultry. I have made this a few times, however, last time, was unexpected guest. I defrosted a package ground turkey meat  and cooked it like ground hamburger in pan with just a bit of olive oil (2Tablespoons) and what a suprise. Easy with about anything. Have even tried with can salmon... GREAT!!!

this dish was alright.  i found that it was dry and lacking in flavor. doing it again i would recommend a creamy sauce to go with it.  the only good thing about it was that it was simpler than most of the other recipes.

These were pretty good. However, I think they need a little something else. Perhaps a sauce (maybe a russian dressing) or something to give it a little extra BAM!

We thought these patties were wonderful.  We followed the recipe, with the addition of some parmesan cheese, hot sauce and some leftover corn "off" the cob we had from last nite's dinner.  YUMMY!!!

This is a wonderfully easy, fast recipe, but I would have to agree with other reviewers that it definitely needs seasoning up quite a bit.  It's a good base recipe that will be fun to experiment with.  Thank you!

This was ok. The recipe as it stands is a little bland, as the others have said -perhaps if your chicken was marinated or well-seasoned this would be avoided. Personally I might include some corn for a sweeter flavour next time, or capsicum like others have suggested.

These are great! I did add a few spices like garlic and onion powder, but they would have been just great with out it. My 7 year old took a left over patty for lunch and her friends told her it didn't smell good, but she said it tasted good. I think they are even better with a little reduced fat ranch on top. My boyfriend likes them as a sandwich.

One of my new favs! The only alteration I had to make was to leave out the parsely since I used leftover breaded chicken that had already been seasoned and I used fresh green onion which was more readily available to me. I love this dish!

My family loved these.  Even my picky husband.  If you like the consistancy of salmon patties, you will like this.  I used 3 eggs, 1 cup of bread crumbs, and some taco seasoning and it was really good.  The taco seasoning gave it a little extra zing.  Very easy to make and good way to use up leftover chicken.
