These were delicious!  Light, tender, just the right density.  I did adjust the recipe... adjustments as follows:  I doubled the recipe, and used approximately 3 tsp of yeast total.  Then I added a little bit of honey and some cinnamon and nutmeg.  I allowed the batter to proof for an hour, then stirred it and allowed it a second proof. I used a cast-iron skillet on very low gas stovetop heat (slowed the cooking time, but made for fluffier crumpets).  I would say it took 10-15 minutes on the first side and 6 or 7 minutes on the flipside.  I also had 3 1/2 inch diameter crumpet molds and used 1/3 to 1/2 cup of batter in each.  This resulted in a yield of 9 crumpets.   The tricky part was not deflating the batter in moving it from bowl to skillet...but with a slower cooking time, it wasn't a big deal.

I printed out this recipe last night & so far my husband has made me make 3 whole batches!!!  I did use bread flour instead of all-purp & used 1 1/2 cups of it, as an epicurean website suggested... FAB!!!  Fun, too!  Messy & gloopy, I think I'll use 1 1/4 cups instead.  Now, I'm looking at peach cans & cookie cutters with CRUMPETS in mind!  (I used circular cookie cutters, mason jar rings, and pancake pattern shapes.  The kids fight over who gets the heart shaped one!  *Oh, split these, too.  Cut them with a bread knife & toast them, top w/ oodles & oodles of butter & jam!!!  Tea-time in Minnesota will never be the same for this family!!!  Thank you for the recipe, dear lady.

There are not very many recipes for crumpets out there, but this one was GREAT!  I didn't really know what to expect, but I loved them...so light and scrumptious.  I will serve them with a sprinkling of confectioners sugar next time, I think.  Or some honey or jam.  As my husband put it--it's a cross between a really fluffy biscuit and a pancake.  Having never had crumpets before, I don't know if this is what they're supposed to be like, but I did like them.  I will definitely double the recipe, though.  This one doesn't make enough, especially if your dough deflates a bit when transferring to the pan.

First of all, I am psyched someone posted a crumpet recipe - so cheers to that! :)  I had several issues with the recipe however:  First of all, the batter was too thick. Crumpet batter is about the consistency of pancake batter, so more water was a must from the beginning.  Second, the recipe used more batter than necessary. Crumpets are supposed to be taller than pancakes, but not as large as popovers - your picture appears correct though.  Third, the crumpets needed to be cooked for at least 10 minutes on the pan before being flipped.  Crumpets are very simple and it was very easy to adapt the recipe for its downfalls, but overall this recipe was not that successful.

The recipe seems vague when it comes to the butter proportions and what to do with it. I don't quite understand what I'm supposed to be doing with the 3 other tablespoons of butter the recipe told me to cut into individual tablespoons. I couldn't possibly have needed that much butter to grease the pan, nor the rings...     My crumpets turned out merely okay; burnt on the bottom and without the holes on top. When cooking in the crumpet rings, the dough did not rise at all. The dough looked very thick, almost like a paste. The finished crumpet tasted pretty dry and made me wonder if I ought to have put in all 4 tbs of butter in the batter!     Has anyone else had a similar problem?

I neeed to practise these, I think.  They are a bit heavier than shop bought, but they taste really fresh and are quick to make for a yeast rise. I used rings of kitchen foil, which were a bit flimsy.

This is my first time ever rating a recipe but I just could not resist on this one. My whole family of 4 went crazy over these. I too had to add just a bit of water to the recipe and I only used 1 tbs of butter in the batter. Also I used 1 tsp of yeast which was enough in my opinion. I was so curious after the wonderful reviews that I read so I made 4 recipes and spent quite a bit of time cooking them. I have one suggestion after some trial and error. when the crumpets are cooking in a mason jar ring, remove the ring when you start to see the bubbles rise..don't wait till they are also dull in appearance.  Then allow them to cook a while longer till they are dull. This makes it much easier to get the ring off in my opinion. I have plenty to freeze now and I will be making them again real soon I am sure:)

This recipe is like an English muffin. Look on the Australian Woman's Weekly website for a proper image of a crumpet. They are toasted as is, without slicing. I modified the recipe until I got it right. Ingredients should be 1 tblspn yeast, one tspn baking powder, and a little more than half a cup of milk.Put the yeast, sugar, water mixture in a warm place for 10 minutes until it develops a foamy head before mixing with the other ingredients. The batter should be bubbly when poured into the egg rings. If you have a Wolfgang Puck griddle, about 300 degrees is right. I also sifted the dry ingredients into one bowl and whisked the wet in another before mixing.

I'm going to have to practice a bit I think. I didn't realize you aren't supposed to deflate the dough, as that is mostly written in the reviews. I ended up whipping in an additional 1/4 cup of water before I poured them into my metal egg-rings, and I did it by 1/4 cupfuls rather than 3 tbsps. I also used whole wheat white flour and added some vital wheat gluten. They still came out decent enough for a first try where I screwed up a few things. They were crumpet taste and consistency, but I had just a couple bubbles on top, and got an english muffin nooks-and-crannies type inside when I cut one open. 
I also just used 1 tbsp of butter, and sprayed the rings and skillet with PAM. I found I could easily remove the rings after about 3 minutes. 
I think I'll give this another try, but I will make sure not to deflate the dough, and to add extra water in the BEGINNING of the recipe rather than the end! I'll re-rate and review accordingly.

I have only ever had commercially-made crumpets and these don't have much in common with those.  They are very good though and the recipe worked perfectly for me.  They were light as air.  Low heat gave me stark white crumpets, so I made the second four on medium and they looked nicer.  I used wide-mouth mason rings and didn't need all the butter.

These taste amazing.  I had to add more milk (about double) to get a thin enough consistency for my liking.  That was the only change I made.  However, I was frustrated with the fact that the recipe states the crumpets are ready in 25 minutes, when it takes at least 45 minutes for the batter to rise.  Plan on over an hour from start to finish... not 25 minutes, as stated.  Some reviewers didn't know what to do with the extra 3 tablespoons of butter.  That's what I cooked the crumpets in.  Yup, they fried in butter, and they were fantastic.

Texture poor, nothing like store-bought ones sold in refrigerator counters at some stores. I suspect good crumpets have multiple steps to enhance flavor and will try to find a better recipe.

Amazing! We've made this twice, the first time we didn't have a griddle, so we cooked them in a pan on medium heat.  I read the recipe wrong and accidently used all the butter in the batter, and they still came out just fine.  The second time we used a griddle and cooked them at 300 degrees, but I think that was a bit too low, I would do 325 or 350 next time.  These are GREAT with butter and raspberry jam!

I don't give reviews on recipes I have re-written, so I give this recipe 5 stars based on following the recipe as written. I used a freshly laid egg from one of my chickens, and my Grandmother's iron skillet, and am enjoying them hot off the griddle with real butter and honey, and a cup of Harney & Sons Earl Grey Winter White Tea.......looooovely.

I'm rating this a 4 star because I don't want to discourage someone from trying it for themselves.  I made these and they were not at all like the crumpets I remember my Grandpa making.  His were so delish, and these were, well these were really awful. I'm rating them a 3 because it could be because my yeast was bad.  WHO knows!  It could have been user error, not the recipe.

I am throwing my daughter a Tea Party for her Birthday next week.  I thought these would be wonderful appetizers for her friends.  Thank GOODNESS I tried it out before serving them at her party. They were thick and dense.  Not at all bubbly like I thought they were supposed to be.  They didn't even taste good.  I will have to try again with another recipe because these are not even close to being good enough to serve at a party.

This is a great comfort food with a cup of tea. I enjoyed eating it on a stormy day while reading a book. I was able to substitute gluten free flour without a problem. DELICIOUS!!!

Pretty decent, and yes, like everyone else I'm shocked that there is only ONE crumpet recipe on the entire site! I found these a little heavy though... needs just a little tweaking.

Excellent recipe - followed it to the tee.  I always triple or quadruple the recipe and save the rest.  They are good toasted for a quick breakfast.

Tea and crumpets are a favorite childhood pastime for me and this was wonderful, just as i remember. I did not follow the recipe excatly, but im sure it would have been 5 stars still. I just made it healthier with the following modifications : 1/2 whole wheat, sub. water for milk since i was out. used only 1 tsp butter in the crumpet and used two egg whites instead of 1 egg. For the active yeast i used 1 tsp. used cooking spray on the pan and to coat rings. Came out PERFECT. I served them toasted, some with butter and jam and others with melted cheddar cheese. Yumm! Serve with hot tea.

amazing beyond words- so easy, and so, so delicious with lots of butter and a spot of jam.  As I was making these, I remembered the maple syrup jelly I got at the Toronto one of a kind show- it was fabulous.

Made these for friends from England.  They loved them!  She preferred hers with just butter; He and my husband cut them in half and used as buns for Giada's chicken burgers.  Thumbs up from the Brits on taste; mine looked more like the add'l photos without the bubble-holes on the exterior, but many & perfect on the inside.  Thank you for the recipe & instructions!  (I used "english muffin rings"...yield 5 crumpets)

I had only had store bought crumpets before, but those were way much drier than these scrumptious crumpets. Thanks for sharing! I'm very happy with this recipe. I read it at 9 PM and I started making them right away. I will post this recipe on the hippoandfriends website in the kids section, for children with diabetes. Thank you very much :-)

These were terrible.  Too bread-like and doughy.  Not the light, fluffy crumpet I was craving.  They were more like a yeasty pancake than a crumpet. I won't even waste my time trying again.  Which saddens me.

I've made these many times, and they are beyond delicious.  BUT I always have a messy time flipping them out of the rings, onto the other side.  I've tried everything, from slapping copious amounts of butter on the rings, spraying them, to not using them at all (fail).  Oh well - they don't look nice, but they taste so wonderful.

Batter or dough was kind of thick..but worked with it to fill the rings. Maybe should have been a little thinner, may take advice of some to add some water. Other than that, turned out fine and tasty, lot less expensive than buying them.

This recipe was easy and my crumpets came out light and fluffy! My skillet wouldn't work at the last minute so I cooked them in muffin tins. They looked a little different, but everyone loved them.

These tasted so delicious.  I followed the recipe to a "T" with great success (I do think the butter directions are unclear, I put 3 T. in the batter and used 1 T. to butter the rings).  I served them with a variety of toppings; homemade strawberry jam, butter and honey, and powdered sugar.  I personally liked them best with the jam.  So fun!

first time making them...the amount of batter this recipe makes could stand to be doubled or tripled in the very least. i may have let it rise too long because i didn't get enough bubbles in the pan..have to work on that one....but overall i ate them with homemade butter and was very satisfied....i need to tweak my technique though

These are super great. I make them all the time now. Sometimes I use different flavors. I made some cherry flavoried ones and some almont flavored ones and used them for deserts by adding ice cream or jams..
