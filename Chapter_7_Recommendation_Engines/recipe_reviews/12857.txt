This is definitely a old family tradition of mine as well to make Calamari and it is always a winner. It takes very little time to make and it could be used as a meal or an appetizer. WONDERFUL recipe!!!

This was the worst Calamari I've ever had. There was no taste at all and they were loaded with oil and the flour was just oo heavy. I would never make this again

I am from Spain, where you find this dish in every restaurant as "Calamares a la Romana", the most simple yet delicious way to serve calamari. Drizzle with some lemon juice before eating, wonderful!

Not sure I would rate this as a recipe - put the squid in flour and fry.  Guess I was looking for more like different spices, etc.  Thanks anyway for posting this - a good place to start.

After reading others reviews I decided to add more seasoning and it was excellent! I added fresh garlic to the oil for starters. Then I added oregano, crushed red  and black pepper and garlic powder to the flour mixture. My husband and 2 teenage boys LOVED it! Two pounds wasn't enough even for an appetizer!

Kind of bland.  I added a touch of Old Bay seasoning because I thought the salt and pepper would need a little kick. I try not to use too much because it is very salty, but this seemed to lack any punch.  I was careful to not fry too many pieces in my deep fryer because I didn't want them to stick but they didn't really get golden brown.  

They came out crispy but bland and pale.  I will look for another recipe.

Simple and tasted just okay.  The flour barely clinged onto the calamari pieces which resulted in virtually no breading in the final product.  Adjusted the breading process after frying the first few calamari rings.  I mixed egg replacer/water (or you can just use one egg) with the remaining calamari before tossing them in a mix of flour and a bit of panko crumbs.  The result was crispy outside but tender inside calamari.  Try not to over cook them as they will get mire dry and tougher to chew.

This is how I make calamari as well.  I guess it would be bland by itself, but we have it with a parmesan-peppercorn dip like the one Olive Garden serves with their calamari. I mix equal amounts sour cream and mayo together, add a little salt and generous amounts of pepper and grated Parmesan or Romano cheese to make a thick, peppery dip.  Serving with lemon wedges for squeezing the juice over the calamari also adds flavor.
