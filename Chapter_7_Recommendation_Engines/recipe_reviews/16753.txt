I really enjoyed this recipe, but I'll admit I did a little tweaking.

After I made the recipe as written, the beer flavor was a little strong (especially since I was making it for a bunch of non-beer drinkers) and the tomato flavor a little weak, so I added a second small can of tomato paste to balance things out.  I then added some TVP (textured vegetable protien) granules for added texture and energy since we were taking this chili with us on a hiking trip.  As the TVP rehydrated, it left the chili a little too thick so I thinned it out with some tomato soup I had in the pantry (which was at this point starting to run out of tomato-flavored canned goods).  A little more simmering and a dash of salt and it was really really good.  I kept taking one more "taste."  :)

This is a great basic recipe and you can play with the balance of ingredients to get just the flavor you want.

I've been searching high and low for a great veggie chili and THIS is it! Made it for a Sunday get together and had nothing but rave reviews. I did saute a small onion and some green pepper with the garlic (I used 2 TBS). I also used a can of Miller Light since that's what we had. My friends don't like spicy, so I only used 3 TBS of chili powder and no hot sauce. But I'll be sure to spice up the leftovers... it is so delicious mild or hot! Serve it with shredded cheddar and sour cream, just delish! Oh, and I skipped the garbanzos...ick. Instead, I used small white beans and extra kidneys. You can suit it to your taste. Don't skip the beer OR the mustard or cumin...you'll be sorry!  Enjoy!

I was disappointed in this recipe.  Maybe my expectations were too high, after all those rave reviews!!  :-) If I made it again, I would leave out the cumin, which had a much stronger taste than I expected, and make it more spicy.  It was, however, extremely pleasing to the eye, with all those colorful beans. I served it over rice with bread.

This recipe is fantastic.  The first time I made it I couldn't believe how much it made, but it was gone in a blink.  The beer is one of the key ingredients here so don't leave it out.  Definately a keeper.

Good recipe base.  It is very hearty, quick, and  easy to make.  I think that it is a bit too dependent on the chili power and lacking a certain something else.  I will definitely experiment with this further.    I think I will try cutting the chili powder down by a Tbsp and be sure to use a darker beer - a stout or porter - next time.  (I just grabbed some Miller High Life this time while at the grocery store.)  I think that I'd also like to start off by adding and sauteing a med onion.     On the plus side again, it goes a LONG way. A small bowl (or mug) with a touch of cheese, maybe a piece or bread, and a side salad is a great meal.  I really had not thought much of veggie chili before.  Try it and see what you think.

Fantastic chili!  I loved it.  I recently stopped eating ground beef and was worried I would miss it in this recipe, however it is a very hearty meal and can easily be frozen for later.  I will make it again when I have a group of friends over for dinner!

I really enjoyed this chili.  I added some textured vegetable protein and made it a little spicier with extra chili powder, cumin and hot sauce.  I was amazed that you didn't need salt, but you really don't.  This one's going in my recipe box.

This recipe is excellent!  I sauteed half a medium onion with the garlic and omitted the cheese.  I also used spicy pinto beans, extra hot sauce, and crushed red pepper flakes. (Some like it hot!) The beer flavor is not overpowering either.  What an awesome, healthy recipe. My boyfriend loved it.  And it's even better the second day after all the flavors blend. Thanks Rae!

Finally!  A way to fix beans so that my kids will eat them!  The flavor was wonderful.  We ate it with tortilla chips; the kids liked eating it like dip.  I will definitely fix this again!

Great vegetarian chili.  Next time I will probably add 2 cans of kidney beans and leave the garbanzo beans out.  They just seemed out of place in a chili.  I like spice so I used 1/4 tsp. of hot sauce and 1/2 tsp. of red pepper flakes.  I also used Guiness Black Lager.  It just makes sense to use a dark beer in any kind of chili.

This was a good chili and I liked that it was thick, but there was nothing special about it though. Just average chili.

Very, very good recipe.  I used a variation of this recipe and won bragging rights at my company chilli cook off.  I was even asked to make it again at an administrative meeting (I'm not in administration!).

One of my staple recipes.  So easy to make and delicious! My family and friends always give a lot of compliments on this one.  If you want to save your spices, just buy the chili mix packs and then add some extra chili powder, ground mustard, and tumeric to taste.  I usually do two packs of the mild kind.

Very good chili! Definitely one of the better vegetarian chili's I've had in a long while. Certainly better than Hormel.
The whole can of beer might have been a bit much; when I made the chili, it had a very distinct beer aftertaste. Not to be petty, but I would try it with half a can.

Couldn't be happier with this recipe!! I can't get cannellini beans so I substituted extra garbanzos. I like it spicy so I added more cayenne as well. If I'm making it for a group, I will brown a pound of ground turkey to throw in.

This was really delicious. My favorite vegetarian chili, so far, and I've tried a few.  I never make a recipe straight, so I omitted the garbanzo beans and put in half a bag of Quorn ground "beef." I added two cups of shredded mild cheddar to cool it a little because I added red pepper flakes and Tapatio to heat it up. So yummy.

This recipe was greatly improved by some simple toppings.  Avocado, cilantro and lime mixed along side some sour cream and some fresh garden tomatoes.  This makes it a four star dish :)

This is the best tasting vegetarian chili I've ever had.  It is full of flavor and I really enjoyed how the flavors meshed together. The only tweeking I did was to omit the pinto beans and that was only because I forgot to buy them.  Next time, I may half the olive oil as I think I can get away with just 1 Tablespoon.

I didn't have pinto or cannellini beans, but my cans were 19 oz.  I added carrot, celery, and onion, and halved the spices (leaving out the hot sauce.)  I just used water instead of beer.  This is a very tasty, delicious chili.  I didn't miss meat (or meat substitutes like t.v.p) at all.  Next time I might use 3/4 of the called-for spices (there will be a next time!)  It makes a lot but it freezes well.  It is very good served with rice.

This was good. I thought the taste of beer was pretty strong and I like beer but I thought it was a little overpowering. I would make this again but probably use maybe half the amount of beer.

This chili was much better than the previous recipe I tried.  The only thing I did differently was cooking it in a slow cooker.  Delicious, and full of protein and fiber.

This recipe was colorful and fun, but the beer was a bit much.  I scaled back the amount of beer the recipe called for, because it seemed to require a bit too much; the chili still had the overpowering taste of beer.  This recipe is now a favorite of my brother's (he's a beer guy), but unless I'm cooking a meal just for him, I'm going to have to pass on this.  But if you like beer, you'll love this chili!

I love this recipe.  I make it, and freeze it in jars so I have something nutrious and delicious to eat, and it's always handy.  This recipe is so easy because all you have to do is open a bunch of cans, and throw it in a pot.  And can we say fast cooking!  I have made chili recipes that require 2 hours of cooking time, this one I can finish in less than a 1/2 hour.  I love it, and  I will forever treasure this recipe.  I even had the guy that runs the cafeteria at work try it, and he liked it and asked for the recipe.

My husband HATES beans but he loves this recipe. I think the beer really adds a great flavor. I think the chili tastes best over rice and topped with cheese.

This is a FANTASTIC recipe! I just had a dinner party and served it over rice with homemade cornbread; the non-vegetarians of the clan were especially surprised: "I didn't think anything could taste so flavorful without meat!" It also tastes great with some added chopped bell pepper.

This recipe is just wonderful.  My husband just went nuts over it.  It's spicy enough and the different types of beans really make it interesting.

I modified the recipe a little by adding sautéed onions, roasted red pepper, extra sauce and tomatoes, and sometimes we add turkey burger. We like it topped with shredded cheddar cheese and a dollop of sour cream and eat it with tortilla chips.

I'm not crazy about beer so I used water instead, and I added sliced mushrooms. The flavoring and consistency in this chili are perfect. This will be my go-to recipe from now on!

This is good although I found it to be mild so I would recommend adding more spice if you like medium or above. Next time I make this I would add chopped onion and peppers and fry these with the garlic cloves.

This is a really good recipe but I made it AWESOME by adding the following....
1 sweet onion ( caramelized)
pre roasting the garlic 
cutting back on the chilli powered, only adding 1/2 and adding a can of pureed Chiplote chilli.

With so much in it, you'll never miss the meat. My husband made this and doctored it slightly, adding extra chili powder and some cayenne. Then we topped it off with shredded chedder and diced onions. Its thick and hearty. So good!

I liked it a lot, and I made it to the T of this recipe. However, next time I think that I would add more corn and spaghetti sauce because it didn't have enough liquid or crunch to it.

I am broke before payday and this recipe I had everything for. I did make some tweaks. First I used 5 cloves of garlic. The diced tomatoes i used where Italian style so they had some seasoning. I didn't use any beer. Used 3 tablespoons of chili powder because I don't do spice. I used 2 cans of kidney beans, 1 can of chili beans and added spelt pasta because it looked like it was missing something to me. After the tweaks this was well received by my boyfriend :)

It tasted like a vat of chili powder beans to me. I'm not sure what I am going to do with all this chili! Maybe I can add other stuff and fix it up for next time. My husband thought it was fine, but I didn't like it.

LOVED it!!  I ended up just using the beans that I had on hand (2 cans black beans, 2 cans red beans and 1 can pinto beans).  I also used 1 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes and a can of rotel tomatoes.   Gave it a nice flavor and a little bit of a kick.   Instead of the beer I used beef broth.  I also sauted an onion with the garlic.  Came out fantastic!!!  Will be making again!

This chili was edible but very unremarkable.  My husband made it to take to a chili cookoff, and not only did it not win, it was one of only two chilis (out of 27 entries) that were leftover after the event!  The only thing we can think of that would have made it better was to use a different beer.  He used "Sierra Nevada Pale Ale", which in spite of its name is a fairly hearty brew.  Perhaps the chili would be better made with Miller light or similar?  After tasting this, I can't help but wonder if some of the prior reviewers were taken in by the "coolness factor" of serving chili made with beer.  Let me be the first to tell you -- the coolness factor does not make up for the taste of this stuff.  And the nearly 200 people who attended this chili cookoff - and chose not to eat it - are proof of that.

quick, easy & delicious!!  For my tastes the spice measurements were perfect.  I didn't use cannelli beans and used 14 oz more diced tomatos instead of the tomato sauce.  I just noticed there are no onions in this recipe, it tastes great, but next time I think I'll add an onion w/ the garlic at the beginning.  This chili is hearty and I definitely don't even miss the meat (or cheese)!

Yummy!  Even the meat-obsessed males in my household gave this a two-thumbs-up.  The only variations I made were as follows:  Added 1/2 onion to saute mix, omitted garbanzo beans, used frozen instead of canned corn, omitted cheese, and used Boca Burger pieces as suggested.  The only gripe I have is that it isn't as spicy as I like - I'll have to play around with it next time to amp up the fire!  This recipe made plenty... I'll be freezing some for future use.

This is a good recipe, almost as good as my dad' s homemade chili. I changed it a little-- left out the beer, cumin, and mustard, and only used black, garbanzo, and kidney beans. I also was a little more liberal with the herbs and spices. It turned out really well, even though it was the first chili I'd ever made. My roommates loved it too. I think it would appeal to anyone.

HOLY MOLY this was some good chili. I did adjust it somewhat: I used about half the corn and I added a packet of chili seasoning. It didn't really have that "chili" kick until I did so. I also like to add some more red pepper because we like things spicy! Another thing you can do, which I have done with great success, is add a packet or two of boca "hamburger" meat... it gives it more protein and makes it more filling, while still staying vegetarian. I am not a veggie though so I've made it with real meat too. Still good!

The garlic was a bit overpowering for a moderate garlic-user like myself.  Next time I will use garlic salt instead of the full-power stuff.

This chili was delicious. My family loved it. It's excellent to kick out a pot for a weekend, or even to stretch out for a week if you are not sharing with a bigger group. It was truly delicious and a healthy source of legumes. The texture was perfect. Honestly, very easy to make. Just get all the ingredients ready to dump in the pot at that key moment and you're set.

I've been making variations of this recipe for years and it's always delicious. My husband and I like it extra spicy, so we usually add some cayenne pepper and often some spicy chiles as well.  I always also add onions and red/orange/yellow peppers. I've done fresh cherry tomatoes instead of canned diced before, and that is super yummy. In the winter I often add a dash of cinnamon, which makes it feel extra cozy and warming. The recipe is very customizeable to your tastes, and yet always delicious! Very filling, and lasts 2 people 3 or more days.

My family and I were temporarily on a strict vegan-type diet, and I was desperate to find some hearty dishes to add interest.  This recipe saved us from boredom and was so good, that I make it regularly now, even after the diet is over.  If you can use home-canned tomatoes, it's even better.  Thanks for a delicious recipe!

Easy to make & lots of leftovers. I added extra garlic and hot sauce. Could sub a can of black bean soup instead the can of black beans if you want it even thicker. Will make this one again.

This was just delicious!! Just made a few minor changes: I added a whole 14 oz. tin of unsalted tomato sauce, sauted a chopped onion, green pepper, some sliced carrot and one diced celery stalk. I also threw in one finely chopped jalapeno. Next time, I'll put in two. I used not one grain of salt - my canned tomatoes were also salt free and the flavour was so good that it wasn't missed at all. I also let it simmer for 45 minutes. It makes a huge pot and what doesn't get eaten for lunch this week, I will freeze the rest. As I am on a low cholesterol diet, I left out the cheese. Thank you, Rae! This one is definitely a keeper!

Well, it was easy to make.  It's basically a bucket of canned beans; a combo of beer and too much dry mustard.  My husband liked it, though!

Great chili!!  I tweaked it a bit, but that's what makes chili great.  I used dried beans instead of canned, but for the most part followed it all the way to the end.

I actually would have given this 0 stars if possible.  I usually have a good eye for recipes that will taste good.  I tried to save the flavor with a few additions such as onions and peppers(who ever heard of chili without onions and peppers?), but it still wasn't good.

This was very tasty and not very difficult. The beer in the recipe is what makes it different than other veg chili, for me. I thought the beer flavor was pretty strong, but my boyfriend said he couldn't taste it at all. So maybe it was just a mental thing for me. Either way it was very good.

Great recipe for a beginner. Easy to make and tastes great. I ended up tweaking the ingredients a little bit. I couldn't find Garbanzo and Cannellini beans at the local grocery store so I just bought a can of mixed beans and it tasted great. I also added a bit more chili powder. 
Great chili!

This is a good base recipe, but I did change quite a bit. I never have beer in the fridge so used white wine instead which added a nice flavour. I didn't use tomato sauce - just one can of tomatoes and one mini can of tomato juice because it was a bit too thick at the end. I only used three cans of beans as that's all I had and used frozen corn. There was a bit of tofu left in the fridge so I chopped that up and threw it in too! The spices listed make it quite spicy, but very flavourful. As I'd never made chili before, I wouldn't have known where to start, so this was a great recipe to point me in the right direction. Just know that it is flexible and you can change it to suit what you have on hand. Next time I might use dried beans (rehydrated obviously) and see how that turns out to save some money and cans!

This chili is amazing - tastes exactly like my mom's, even though she made hers with meat.  I don't like things spicy, so I left out the hot sauce and it still had a mild kick.  Definitely had to use two pots to fit everything!  A great winter dinner!

I was really happy with this recipe and my family loved it. We put it over baked potatoes. I added half of a medium onion (sauteed with the garlic) and substituted an extra can of kidney beans for the cannellini beans since I had a bunch on hand. The beer is great and the spices had a nice balance.

The mustard and beer we're really overpowering. Luckily, it's chili, so it was easy to doctor up to our liking.

Great recipe! I varied it a bit based on what I had in the pantry. Started by sauteeing garlic, onion, yellow bell pepper, a jalepeno, one small habanero, and some baby carrots until softish. Then I added the spices and let those soak into the veggies for a minute or so. I omitted the tomato sauce, but doubled the diced tomatoes. Used Bass as the beer and it smelled wonderful as the alcohol was cooking off. Chili was wonderfully spicy and I served it with a dollop of fat free plain yogurt. Can't wait to eat more tomorrow!

This is a GREAT recipe. The beans and corn make this a nice thick chili and you don't miss the meat. I sauteed some onion along with the garlic. I tried this with a Yuengling Porter, which gives a interesting bitter (good bitter) flavor, but it needed to be sweetened a little, so I added a few tablespoons of brown sugar.

This is a really simple, yet delicious chili. I changed it slightly by sauteing 1 lg onion and chopped red and green peppers in oil BEFORE adding the garlic. Very good and really fast.

I used one can garbanzos, and the rest pinto beans because it was what I had on hand.  I also omitted the hot sauce cause i did not have it.  Husband loved it - I got only one bite before he had it all gone.  Definitely a hit!

Definitely only if you like beer. I didn't like the addition of chickpeas or tomatoe sauce either.
