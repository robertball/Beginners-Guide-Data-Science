These ribs really did fall off the bone and they were delicious!!  However, I would change a couple things next time I make them.  I followed the recipe as is, except I made my own bbq sauce.  When they were in the oven, the foil pouches started leaking.  I contributed that to the fact that I may have had too much sauce in there and also the ribs secrete their own juices as they cook.  Next time I may cook them in a cooking bag or I might line a 13x9 baking pan with non-stick foil and marinade and bake them in that.  The non-stick foil really works!  I baked the ribs for 2 1/4 hours and then placed them meaty side up on a cookie sheet lined with non-stick foil.  Then I put more homemade sauce on them and broiled them for 15 minutes.  This really makes a difference because then the ribs have sauce really sticking to them, restaurant style.  If you skip this part and just take the ribs out of the foil and serve them, there is no sauce on them and they look pale and unappetizing.  Just be sure to check the ribs frequently as their broiling so that they don't get burned.  I had 3 big, hungry guys for dinner that night and they ate 5 pounds of ribs!  Just a side note, I made yummy potatoes in foil and the whole dinner was EASY cleanup!  Just slice raw potatoes fairly thin and lay them in a mound on a lg. piece of foil.  Put a few pats of butter on them and sprinkle with salt, pepper or any herbs you like.  Seal them up good and let them cook with the ribs for at least an hour and

This basic recipe, or cooking method, when combined with the suggestions of others, allowed me to make the most delicious, and easiest ribs we've ever had! Here are my changes. 
I adapted the "Dry Rub for Ribs" by Denise from this site, and it was the perfect amount for the three racks of ribs I had. This is what I used:
1/4c. brown sugar, 1 1/2 Tbsp. paprika, 1 Tbsp. kosher salt, 1 1/2 Tbsp. black pepper, 1 tsp. garlic powder, 1 tsp. onion powder, 1/4-1/2 tsp. cayenne red pepper. (Definitely remove the back membrane before rubbing spices on!
Several people had mentioned how runny the barbecue sauce got from the meat juices, so I put only the dry rub on for the 8 hour marinating process, as well as the baking. My second concern was about the meat literally falling off the bones. I wanted to finish them on the grill, so meat actually falling off  bones wasn't desirable. I baked the foil packets on cookie sheets at 300 
for 2 hours. I let them cool for about 1/ hour to firm up before I moved them to the grill. Then I brushed them with Jack Daniel's sauce thinned with a little of the cooking juices. Finally, I grilled them on medium heat, brushing with extra sauce for about 5 min. a side, till they were nicely caramelized. YUM! They were "falling off the bone" tender, without actually falling off. 
Try these! You won't be sorry!

First an editorial comment: someone ripped this recipe because all it involved was a method to cook the ribs, while using common bottled dressing. I must disagree. There are a lot of ways to screw up a rack of ribs, especially for the novice. This lets you use your favorite sauce, which in my case was Sweet Baby Ray's, so there's no experimenting with something you ultimately won't like. Just as promised, the ribs cooked to a perfect doneness. I'll echo what others have said: it's best to brown them under the broiler afterwards. I drained them, placed them on a broiler pan, swabbed on more sauce, and broiled them for a few minutes. Absolutely perfect. 

UPDATE: Use the fantastic rub described in Cathy M.'s review before brushing on the sauce.  It makes these ribs even better. Also, before anything, remove the membrane on the back of the ribs by slitting with a knife, grip the membrane with a paper towel, and pull. It will rip right off.

I've gotta start off by saying I was skeptical before I started with all of the claims saying the meat just fell off the bone.

I thought about having ribs for dinner at 3:00 pm. So I defrosted them and knew I had seen a recipe on here for them before. I thought about doing the overnight bit but I would be the only one home tomorrow night so I went ahead with it. 

I dusted the ribs with a rub of sugar, salt, pepper and paprika and then poured some Billy Bones BBQ sauce right on the foil,put the rib meat side down on the foil and then poured more sauce on top and bundled it up. 

These were wonderful. I could just pull the bone right out and was left with a boneless piece of pork if I wanted to. I will definitely make these again and will marinate them overnight as the recipe says. But they're still great if you make them the same afternoon without any time to marinate.

This method was excellent -- and inspired me to come up with something even better.  At the minimum, you can follow this method as is, except lower the oven temperature to 225 degrees and bake for four hours.  For even better results, coat the ribs with prepared mustard (the taste of which will disappear during the long cooking time) and apply a "dry rub" (you can find many recipes for rubs on the Internet or in barbecue cookbooks).  Seal the ribs in a plastic bag and refrigerate for at least one day; I do it for three days.  Put the ribs on a raised rack or on paper towels (to allow fat to drip off or to absorb fat).  Put the ribs and rack (or towels) in an oven bag and bake at 225 degrees for four hours.  (Don't worry, paper towels will not burn at such a low temperature.)  After four hours, the ribs will have a nice crust and flavor from the rub and will be fall-off-the-bone tender.  The last step is to remove the ribs from the bag, brush the upper surface with your favorite barbecue sauce and broil for ten minutes.  This is optional, but after cutting up the ribs, I like to pour on a little more sauce to make the ribs "wet."

I realize that this written description makes the process sound quite involved, but it's really not and the results are well worth the extra trouble.  Oh, and I have really enjoyed experimenting with different rub/sauce combinations.

I'm a last minute recipe finder and didn't have but 30 minutes to prepare for cooking - so I didn't marinate these ribs in the sauce for more than 20 minutes and they were AMAZING - I did omit the spraying of the foil and used the new Reynolds Non-Stick Foil instead no sticking - and no mess!  Grilling for 20 minutes after baking - on indirect medium heat makes them restaurant style.

Yes, these are great IF you add to it.  First, definitely use a dry rub before cooking in the oven.  I also add a slight amount of brown sugar to caramelize and add great color.  Finally after removing from oven, remove foil and grill for about 10 minutes on each side, basting with bbq sauce,until desired color.  The grilling at the end is the key to not having a "McRib" texture.  Try it...YUM!!!

These ribs really got my guests' attention when they literally fell off the bone, as they were served!  I ensured their tenderness by removing the tough, clear membrane from the underside of the ribs.  Then I lightly seasoned the underside with a rub, and used the Blackberry BBQ Sauce recipe (from this site) for the top of the ribs.  As the recipe said, they were marinated overnight, then slow cooked in foil.  Fantastic!  The three elements for tender ribs:  (1)remove the membrane prior to cooking; (2)marinade with a lemon or vinegar acidic base (found in the ketchup in this recipe); (3)slow cook... voila!  perfect ribs every time!  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

If it falls off the bone, you just steamed all the texture and flavor out of them. Try using a dry rub instead of the sauce, cut the oven time back to a couple hours, low temp 250, then slowly grill over charcoal. Add sauce at the end. You'll have a better slab with a little bite to the meat.

Great recipe for 'winter' bbq. Clean-up was so incredibly easy! Before baking I rubbed 'Jim Goode's BBQ Beef Rub' (I find this recipe at Allrecipes too) on the ribs for an extra punch.

As per Todd Wilbur's method (Top Secret Recipes) copy catting Tony Roma's ribs, I've made ribs exactly this way for years--so good I wouldn't do it any other way, let alone the hard way! Once out of the oven, finish them off on a charcoal grill for a few minutes, brushed with a little extra BBQ sauce and you're in hog heaven.

For those of you making ribs for the first time, you do NOT always have to remove the membrane from the ribs before cooking.  If you forgot to do this, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.  My father makes the most tender ribs I have ever tasted, and he never removes the membrane.  The ribs are so tender, you won't even know its there.  What my father does differently is that he marinates this recipe overnight.  He cooks it on 250 degrees F for about 4 and-a-half to 5 hours, and they are KICK BUTT.  Also, if you don't have a broiler, no worries.  When your ribs are done cooking, remove them from the oven and smear them with more BBQ sauce, then put the ribs back into the oven for 5-10 minutes.  They taste just as good.

Fantastic recipe!  I pulled the membrane off the ribs, used the dry rub from Cathy M's review (1/4c. brown sugar, 1 1/2 Tbsp. paprika, 1 Tbsp. kosher salt, 1 1/2 Tbsp. black pepper, 1 tsp. garlic powder, 1 tsp. onion powder, 1/4-1/2 tsp. cayenne red pepper), and put them on a baking sheet covered very tightly with foil for 2 1/2 hours at 300 degrees. They were falling off the bone when I removed them from the oven.  Then, I cut them into serving sized pieces, put them on the BBQ using a mixture of the cooking juices and Famous Dave's BBQ sauce.  I grilled them for about 10 minutes to lightly brown and caramelize the sauce.  Finger licking good!

This recipe never fails! 
I have made these ribs 4 or 5 times now, and they're always fantastic. I messed up last time and cooked at 350 degrees for 2 hours, and they *still* came out great, just a tiny bit drier than usual. 

To help prevent leaks, I use a double layer of foil to wrap the ribs in, and line the cooking sheet with foil to catch any juices that do come out. After the 2 hours in the oven, I take the ribs out of the foil, brush liberally with more sauce, and broil for another 10 minutes or so. This step makes a HUGE difference. The meat is flavourful anyway, but with the added sauce and broiling, you get the sticky, glazed goodness that comes with restaurant-style ribs. Plus, you can reserve the rib juice from the foil packets to use as a gravy or stew flavouring. It's the recipe that keeps on giving! Thanks Ken!!

This is the next best thing to grilled ribs.  The second time I did it, I chopped up onions and fresh garlic and tossed it right along inside with the meat and it was even better!!!  To get rid of the watered down flavor, open the packet, flip your oven to broil and keep basting the last 30 minutes of cooking time.

This recipe was the easiest and best tasting for baby back ribs. I always used to have tough ribs and the old method of boiling them and grilling them always lacked for more. I'm so glad I found this recipe, this will be my go-to method from now on. I cooked 4 racks of ribs, using the Farmer John's brand purchased from Smart & Final. The key to tender juicy ribs, I found, is that you have to remember to remove the membrane on the back of the ribs. If you've ever experienced "tough" ribs, then it's because the membrane wasn't removed. This made a huge difference. I cooked all 4 racks of ribs in my oven on the lower and top racks, alternating racks an hour and a half into the cooking time. I also upped the temperature the last hour and a half to 325, then 350 the last half hour to compensate for the extra meat in the oven. The result? perfect ribs. I also used the dry rub found on this site by Denise. Rub the ribs with the dry rub, and then liberally basted with KC masterpiece bbq sauce before sealing with foil. When the ribs were done cooking, I brushed with more bbq sauce and broiled the racks for 10 minutes to give them that charred, sticky good flavor and look. The ribs received raves from my dinner guests. Absolutely moist, juicy, fall of the bones. Yummy!

I made these on a Friday night and again on Sunday night because they were so good.  We have an inground pool and our house is party central in the summer so I'm always looking for great grilling recipes.  Our guests were freaking out over how great these ribs were.  I had numerous people say they were the best ribs they ever had.  I was previously making my baby back ribs with the Prize winning ribs recipe from this website but there is NO comparison.  These ribs fall right off the bone.  They are tender and absolutely delicious.  I baked them in the oven in the aluminum foil tents (I used Sweet Baby Rays honey bbq sauce) and then grilled them on high for 2-3 minutes a side so they had nice charcoal grill marks on them.  These also taste GREAT with the Blackberry BBQ sauce from this website.  Thank you so much for this recipe.  This is the ONLY way I will ever make ribs on the grill this summer or ever again!!!

Perfection! I too used Cathy M's dry rub first: 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1 1/2 Tbsp Paprika , 1 Tbsp Kosher Salt, 1 1/2 Tbsp Black Pepper, 1 tsp Garlic powder, 1 tsp Onion powder, 1/2 tsp Cayenne Pepper.  Remove the membrane (A MUST). Use a paper towel to grip the membrane.  While marinating in fridge, my foil bags also filled up w/ liquid (small mess), now I place foil bags in a large plastic bag. I drained the bags prior to the oven. I lined my oven w/ foil as the foil bags do get full of liquid but the lipped baking sheet they are on took care of any spills. Baked 2 hours at 300 in foil bags, cool for 20 min, then 15 min on BBQ or broiler. Don't bake any longer or they fall off the bone and you cannot place them on BBQ or broiler. My ribs did not look pale and therefore did not need the BBQ, but I did it anyway. And remember to use non-stick foil or just spray w/ oil like I did.

I made these ribs for dinner tonight and they were wonderful! I have tried several times to make tender ribs, but have failed in past attempts. I decided to try this and am so glad that I did. My search is over! May your search for ribs end here also! I did not marinate them overnight like the recipe, but rubbed them with some seasoned salt and wrapped them in aluminum foil without the BBQ sauce. After the cooking was over, I put them on the grill and brushed them with BBQ sauce and let the sauce set and also let the meat get a little crispier on the outside. They were finger-licking good!

Sooo good...followed Cathy M's suggestion for dry rub - this is what she uses:  1/4c. brown sugar, 1 1/2 Tbsp. paprika, 1 Tbsp. kosher salt, 1 1/2 Tbsp. black pepper, 1 tsp. garlic powder, 1 tsp. onion powder, 1/4-1/2 tsp. cayenne red pepper.  I liberally coated the ribs with the dry rub in the morning and refrigerated them tightly in foil.  It's really hot here in California, so I waited until the weather cooled down at night and baked them (in the foil) on a cooling rack placed on a cookie sheet so the heat could circulate around the ribs.  Baked at 250 degrees for four hours with just the dry rub.  After cooling down, back into the refrigerator.  The following day I took them out of the refrigerator for about an hour to take the chill off, then swabbed on some good BBQ sauce and put them on the barbie for 15 mins total on gas grill - direct heat for 5 minutes and indirect heat for 10 minutes remaining.  Hubby said "you can't get them this good anywhere else".  Thank you for a great recipe.

More of a cooking method than a recipe and what a  great one it is. 
Of course make sure you have a tasty BBQ sauce, one that you would happily drink out of the bottle and you will surely end up with the absolute best results.

EXCELLENT RIBS -- Very easy and delicious.  Even though wrapped in foil, my pan was a mess, so the next time, I lined the pan in foil also, and clean up was a breeze.  Also, after baking, I opened foil, added more sweet bbq sauce and then put them under the broiler for 4 minutes, meaty side up -- SPECTACULAR.  Thanks Ken for a GREAT rib recipe.  Happy Cooking.

I've been making my baby back ribs this way for years with one big exception - I don' marinade them first.  I don't always know at 8am what I'm making for dinner that night but that doesn't stop me from making ribs!  

I cut the ribs into sections, brush them with bbq sauce (Sweet Baby Ray's) wrap them in tin foil and bake low and slow for a couple of hours.  They are every bit as tender and fall off the bone as the best restaurants.  So if you don't have time to marinade, make them anyway!!

I made these ribs following the recipe. I used the Bourbon Whiskey BBQ Sauce recipe found on this site. When the ribs were done I opened the foil wrap and applied more sauce and placed them under the broiler for about 7 minutes. My wife said that the ribs were to die for and I have to agree. The BBQ sauce is the best also. Thanks KHEFFN

These are amazing.  I have never eaten anything like this before.  The meat was very tender and delicious.  Please try this recipe.  Add your own rub to make it suit your tastes for you and your family.  Good stuff, thanks for the post.

This was SOOOO good!  I bought the ribs and BBQ sauce (i like Bulleye's Honey Roast) in the morning, cut the ribs, put them on tin foil, smothered them in sauce, and wrapped them up!  Then threw them in the oven in the afternoon, and by dinner they were perfect!  I also put some potatoes in the oven about 2 hours before dinner, so we had ribs and baked potatoes!  As the ribs marinated all day, I did all my errands, came back, and threw them in the oven, and then did some more work at home.  My friends thought I was in the kitchen all day slaving over dinner.  And the meat fell right off the bone.  This was delicious.  I wish I could give it more than five stars.

Fantastic.  As advertised.!!  I had 8 pounds of ribs and used the rub recipe Cindy advised  (times 3).  My process was as stated earlier, cut into sections, put rub generously on, brush much barbecue sauce on  and wrap in aluminum foil individually.  I had 8 sections.  Be sure to coat the non stick foil with PAM as well, makes it clean.  And yes, place on a cookie sheet well covered with non stick foil and also sprayed with Pam.  After 2 1/2 hours at 300 degrees, I removed and took the sections, removed the foil placed them on the cookie sheet, poured any juice that was in each individual foil onto the ribs and sprinkled the rub lightly on each then smothered the ribs in barbecue sauce again, and baked for another 15 minutes.  After the 2 1/2 hours of baking I sprayed the cookie sheet with another layer of PAM before placing sections for the 15 minutes of baking  SMART FOR REMOVAL AND CLEANUP.  Do not forget to take the membrane off the ribs prior to baking as others mentioned.
They were tender, juicy, and fell off the bone.  Be sure to use Cindy's Rub recipe.   Again, I tripled it because I had 8 pounds which easily fed 6.

Delish!! I've made these 3 times now to rave reviews! I used the dry rub from Cathy M's review (1/4c. brown sugar, 1 1/2 Tbsp. paprika, 1 Tbsp. kosher salt, 1 1/2 Tbsp. black pepper, 1 tsp. garlic powder, 1 tsp. onion powder, 1/4-1/2 tsp. cayenne red pepper), put them on a baking sheet and cover very, very tightly with foil for 1-3/4 hours at 300 degrees. If they're not yet falling off the bone, I pour off the juices, pour some BBQ  sauce over, cover back up and cook a bit more. Then I cut them into serving sized pieces, slather with sauce, and put them on the grill for about 5-10 minutes! To die for!! I have never marinaded them....they are always fall-off-the-bone tender anyway and full of flavor!!

This recipe leaves out critical information. 

1. Before all, remove the membrane from the underside of the ribs. 

2. Ribs cook better in big slabs, not broken up in pouches. To keep them together, make a big foil "boat" by turning up the edges on a big piece of foil and pinching another on top. Put it on a baking pan.

3. After 2.5 hours at 300^F, the ribs will be steamed from being in the boat and most of the sauce will have come off. So you have to rebaste them - GENEROUSLY. Don't be stingy. Finally, cook uncovered for another 45 mins, or whenever that generous layer of sauce starts to caramelize and, you know, look like ribs should look.

I have just recently returned to cooking from scratch and am now cooking for two.  I had no time to marinate as I pulled these ribs straight out of the freezer and thawed at room temp.  I sprayed a sheet of Reynolds Heavy Duty foil with Pam spray and then prepared a rack of pork baby back ribs with McCorkmick Grillmates Pork Rub and covered with KC Materpiece BBQ sauce. I wrapped the rack in the prepared foil and then wrapped this again in another layer of heavy duty foil.  I placed this package in the bottom of a broiler pan and baked for 3.5 hours at 350 degrees. I opened the foil and covered the top with additional BBQ sauce and broiled on low until the top looked the way I expected for BBQ ribs. They were tender, flavorful and delicious. My honey said that there was no way they could have been any better.  I also prepared Grandma's Buttermilk Cornbread cooked in a prepared 8 inch cast iron skillet and Country Style Green Beans with Potatoes.  We had no room for dessert tonight!

Ok, I just made these for the very first time! I did remove the back membrane off like other reviews suggested, however, I did also use a rub that I had made and used the sweet baby rays bbq sauce as well. My Husband loves them, in fact I have made them twice this week! 300 degrees and for 2 hrs. and 40 min. I also wanted to share the most important part that is not part of this recipe....That is to Broil the ribs without the foil,  on a cookie sheet after they have been baked. Broil for exactly 9 min.  My husband has been bragging about them all week long! I am very picky about ribs...I think that is why I never made them (the fear of not liking them and wasting them.)  I think that this is one of my top 10 favorite meals to make!  Easy clean~up and not much work to them!  Thank you for the recipe, but more importantly all of the reviewers that made such wonderful suggestions that takes this original recipe to a whole other level.  I will make this often! Thank you!

I bought 1-1/2 racks of baby backs and decided to try this recipe using Cathy M's (reviewer) rub recipe.  I let the rub sit over night and then the next am decided that I needed another rack of ribs for my crowd, so I got another rack which had rub on only about 6 hrs before putting them all in the over ... point i'm getting to is, there was NO difference between the ribs that sat overnight and the ribs that sat for only the 6 hrs w/the rub.  I cooked them in the foil (no BBQ sauce yet) for 2 hrs and then took them out and SEPARATED the ribs so that when  I sauced them I could put the sauce all over the ribs, not just the top.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's Sweet & Spicy sauce, sauced each rib good, and broiled them for just a few minutes.  These were the BEST ribs ever and I will SO use this recipe again.  One thing is, I tried a rib before I saucued them and the rub is REALLY spicy ... the Sweet Baby Rays added a sweetness which was very welcome.  GREAT!

I made these ribs the other day and they came out absolutely wonderful!! I did as other users suggested and cooked them on 250 for 4 hours. I put them in disposable aluminum baking pans and coverded them with foil. Easy clean up, just toss! I also removed the membrane on back of ribs as suggested. This is so easily done using a butter knife to separate and grabbing with a paper towel and pulling off. I also made the "dry rub for ribs" recipe and put on the night before. Then, I brushed with "Nana's barbeque sauce" before baking and finished off with broiling after the 4 hours, just enough to bring to perfection, probably 10 min or so. Wonderful recipe. I will definitely use again and again!

This is a fantastic recipe! The ribs fell off the bones, tender & full of flavor...and no messy pans to clean up! And to whoever wrote that this "isn't a recipe...," it isn't always the ingredients you put in, but the method by which it's prepared.

This is by far my favorite method for cooking ribs.  Mind you how important it is to keep them TIGHTLY wrapped in the foil to keep them tender.

My first time making ribs & they turned out great.  I used Stubbs BBQ Sauce (Spicy), following the recipe as written, but at the end I did broil the ribs on both sides (best to end with the meaty side up) to obtain the "sticky" quality that other reviewers mentioned they get from their restaurant ribs; did this for about 6 minutes on each side at about 300F-400F (full 500F broil was too hot).  My husband was in hog heaven, so to speak, and it was nice to make something different for a change, rather than chicken!

If I wasn't already married, Ken... I would hunt you down. LOL. The best ribs we have ever eaten at home.   Melt-in- your-mouth-fall-off-the-bone-ribs  is what I ended up with. And at a quarter of the restaurant price. I did sprinkle mine with granulated garlic, and I used Sweet Baby Ray's. And you do need to run them under the broiler, if you want that stickiness that I just long for in my BBQ ribs. Tony Roma's can miss me! Thanks.

Yes they are fall-off the bone tender, but the sauce runs off with the greast. What a terrible thing to do to baby back ribs. I should have just fixed a pork roast.

These were the easiest ribs I have ever made.  Clean-up was a snap.  My husband really loved the taste.  Will keep this as part of my recipe collection.  Just a simple note I used the Dry Rub for Ribs submitted by Denise smith to enhance the flavor.  I also used foil on the bottom of the pan in addition to wrapping each rib.  These were the only enhancements made.  Thanks again for sharing

I FINALLY TRIED THESE RIBS, AND THEY'RE ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS, AND REALLY QUICK AND EASY TO PREPARE. I USED MY OWN LITTLE BBQ SAUCE CONCOCTION, AND AFTER 2 1/2 HRS SLOW COOKING, THE MEAT REALLY DOES FALL OFF THE BONE. KUDOS.

These ribs were so easy to prepare, and fell off the bone. Followed recipe as is, but next time I think I will finish them off on the grill. Thank you for a simple and tasty recipe. Everyone loved them.

This recipe is perfection.  The only thing I'd mention is there is no step making mention of removing the membrane from the back of the ribs.  Take a butter knife to loosen one end, and then you should be able to rip the membrane right off.  I used a homemade seasoning mixture of garlic, onion powder, salt, pepper etc. to sprinkle over the ribs.  I then used a homemade BBQ sauce of Diet Coke and ketchup (12 oz. Diet Coke per 1 cup of ketchup. Let it simmer on the stove top until it reduces to a thicker BBQ like sauce.)  When the ribs were done cooking, I took them out of the oven and threw them in my grill plan to give them that grilled look.  The meat fell right off the bone, everyone raved over them, and there were no leftovers for the next day.  This recipe is simple and impressive.

Excellent recipe and the best, easiest way to cook ribs. I made my own rub to put on ribs (don't cake the ribs with rub though), then brushed well with Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ Sauce. Put in fridge overnight.  Next evening, cooked for 2 1/2 hours at 300. Used baking pans to catch any runoff from wrapped ribs. When you take them out, there will be very little or no sauce on them. Brush with sauce again and broil for 5 mins.  Boom, done, everyone loved them.

Despite what some people are saying this is still a recipe...its all in how you cook and prepare the ribs before cooking, it doesn't matter that you can use pre-made sauce, if you want you can always add your own sauce recipe. That said this was a great recipe, the ribs wouldn't even stay on the bone no matter what I tried to do :-) I didn't have time to marinate for 8 hours but they still turned out great. The only thing I did differently was, in the last 10 min of cooking I removed the ribs from the foil and added another slather of BBQ and put them under the broiler for 10min, when I took them out I added one more coat of BBQ sauce.  Naturally the only thing this recipe is lacking is the smoke flavor from the grill/smoker but you might be able to achieve that by adding a tin filled with wet BBQ wood (haven't tried it so don't know 100% if it would work, maybe next time)

Super easy and delicious!  I added to the basic recipe.  First I brushed on a mixture of lemon juice and olive oil. Then  I used a dry rub on them  (paprika, cumin, salt, pepper, brown sugar), then wrapped them in the foil.  The next day we grilled them on the top shelf for about 1 1/2 hours (at about 350).  I then took them out of the foil, brushed them generously with BBQ sauce, and grilled them over direct heat until crispy.  A very big heat at the party.  Thanks for a convenient, easy way to make delicious ribs.

This was fantastic! I used beef ribs this time. As Cathy recommended, I used the rub first: 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1 1/2 Tbsp. paprika, 1 Tbsp. kosher salt, 1 1/2 Tbsp. black pepper, 1 tsp. garlic powder, 1 tsp. onion powder, 1/4-1/2 tsp. cayenne red pepper. But remove the back membrane before rubbing spices on. Then I used Nana's Barbecue Sauce from this site and marinated them in foil for at least 8 hours. I put the foil bunches in a dish for dripping and cooked for 2 1/4 hours like someone recommended. Then I put fresh sauce on the ribs and broiled for 15 minutes. This was fantastic! I will try with pork ribs next time. P.S. Nana's bbq sauce is amazing!

The key to this recipe is what BBQ sauce you use.  CooksIllustrated.com recently did a taste test of store bought BBQ sauces and we went with their recommendation.  Their two top picks were Texas Best Barbecue Sauce, Original Rib Style and BullsEye Original BBQ Sauce.  We couldn't find Texas Best so we used Bulls Eye.  It kind of had a smokey taste and was a very thick sauce.  The meat turned out tender and perfect.  After cooking we added more sauce because it slightly lacked in flavor.  But in the end we loved these and probably ate far too much for one sitting!  We will make this again for sure.

I thought these were the best BBQ Ribs I have ever made. I did put a rub of chili powder, garlic powder, onion salt, and rosemary herb on them before I put on the Sweet Baby Rays BBQ Sauce. I baked them for 3 hours, added more sauce and then broiled them for about 5 minutes. VERY YUMMY....will make again. Thanks

This was very easy, and the meat was moist and cooked to perfection. I was a little disappointed in how bland the taste was, since the barbeque sauce seemed too watered down by the meat's juices, next time will unwrap the ribs after baking and add additional sauce and broil a few minutes to get a real bbq taste. Altogether, though, a foolproof way to get ribs cooked just right!

I made the Baby Back Ribs this weekend and loved them.  I made several changes suggested by other reviewers:  I put a dry rub on the ribs, wrapped them in foil, and put them in the fridge overnight.  In the morning I put BBQ sauce on the ribs, re-wrapped them in foil, and left them in the fridge for a couple more hours.  I baked them at 300 degrees for 2 1/2 hrs.  After 2 1/2 hrs, I removed the foil, put more BBQ sauce on the ribs and baked them at 350 degrees for 20 more minutes.  The meat fell off the bone!  Next time, I'll take the ribs out of the foil at 2 hrs, put BBQ sauce on and bake them at 350 for the last 20-30 minutes.  It's a recipe worth repeating.

I loved these ribs! I got these ready and set the oven for a delayed start ... they were almost done when I walked in the door from work. Usually I finish off on a charcoal  grill but it was pouring down rain so I finished them off in the broiler. The extra sauce I added before broiling was fantastic! My husband on the other hand said he missed the grill taste ... but that didn't stop him from eating every last morsel! I made some garlic mashed potatoes and baked beans. We were ready for dinner an hour earlier than usual. I had some leaking from the juices and sauce so cleanup wasn't as quick as I would have liked but that's my fault. Next time I'll use aluminum foil on my pan to catch the drippings. I will definately keep this recipe ... finishing off on the grill or broiler ... this was the quickest I have ever made ribs!

I'm sure there is a reason you need to leave them in the fridge for 8+ hours, but I don't see the purpose.  I left them in for about 4 and they turned out perfect.  I can't imagine them tasting any better.  The bones just fall away from the meat because it's so tender.  The foil does leak, so I put a pan underneath them to catch the drippings.  I also took the advice of several and put extra bbq on and broiled them for about 10 minutes.  The barbeque sauce is watery after it cooks, so definitely broil it to get the bbq to stick.  I was completely intimidated by ribs before, but never again!  This was too easy!

I have made these for years and I usually do a rub and just brown them on the grill a little then wrap them in the foil and slow good them in the oven.  If you have someone who doesnt think ribs are right unless cooked on the grill this is one way to do it when I take them out of the oven I put sauce on and put them on the grill again!!!  The are the BEST!!!

Awesome! If you have even less time, more like an hour til your guests arrive, I pressure cook mine in a bottle of wine (just enough to cover) with all the dry rub spices and a dollop of grain mustard. Boil for about 30 mins, then whack them in a hot oven coated in the bbq sauce!! They come out just as good if not even juicier than the slow roasted ones...TRY IT!!! (pressure cookers are the best - like having a slow cooker on speed!) :-)

In my 21 years of marriage, I've never before tried cooking ribs. I've always been unsure of how to get good results and was intimidated by others I know who cook fabulous ribs. I didn't have time to do the overnight marinade since I had picked up the baby back ribs today for dinner tonight, but will definitely do so next time. I did use the dry rub suggested in one of the other reviews and I have to say these were some of the BEST ribs I have ever tried - even in a restaurant. I turned off the oven after the first 2 1/2 hours and left the ribs in for another hour as I needed to run out for a while. Then I did broil them with the BBQ sauce before serving. Nothing left but bones!

I will have to try some of the suggestions that people have next time. I made a bag type thing out of foil and put the ribs in it and pour BBQ sauce all over them, kinda rubbed it in and let it sit in the fridge for 24 hours, then i put them in the oven (still in the tin foil bag) like it says and they came out so tender, they fell off the bone! they where not white at all they had the dark color of the sauce, I pours some more BBQ sauce over the top of them and served them with roasted potatoes and corn on the cob... BIG HIT with the fam! even the kids liked them and my nephew is a VERY picky eater...

I misread the instructions and didn't know I was suppose to marinate the ribs for 8 hours.  Since I planned to cook the ribs that night and didn't have 11 hours to spare, I had to go w/ plan B.  I boiled my ribs for one hour in a pan with seasonings....garlic powder, seasoning salt, adobo etc.  Then I followed the instructions wrapping the ribs in tinfoil but used 2 bottles of sauce instead of one.  I baked the ribs for only one hour at 325 because I wanted my ribs tender but still on the bone (if you're like me, the best part is eating them off the bone).  Let's just say they were soooo tasty that I have no desire to marinate them or cook them any other way.  They were AMAZING!!  If you're short on time, do what I did...even if you aren't, try it this way...boy, were they good.  Don't forget to open the foil and broil them for 15 minutes before you take them out.  IT MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE in terms of making sure the sauce sticks to the rib versus a soupy sauce falling off the ribs.

ok....here's the deal! You must remove the membrane, use a paper towel to get a good grip on it, after you have pried it away from the back of the ribs part way, then pull. It should come off easily then. Next, you must cook at 300 degrees for at least 3 hours and then unwrap the foil, add more barbeque sauce, if you wish, and then broil for 20 or so minutes, not too close to the coils. The end result is that these ribs will be better than the Texas Roadhouse...trust me.

I have been preparing ribs for over 15 years and this recipe has to be the easiest and the best. I made it even easier by using Reynolds foil bags instead of plain aluminum foil. No drips or leaks.  I also took the advice from reviewers and used Sweet Baby Ray's sauce and used the broiler to finish off the ribs.  I did stray somewhat from the original recipe and used a dry rub (from this site).  This rub combined with the sauce made for a delicious and easy dinner my family and friends really enjoyed.

Wonderful!  My wife and daughter continually ask for these ribs.  They are quite easy to prepare the night before…toss in the oven for a couple hours and your set.  A little rice and green beans or potatoes and corn and you have a meal. Don’t forget the paper towels or napkins! Note: Be sure to spray the foil with cooking oil, it makes a difference…I forgot once and they burnt a bit on the ends and stuck to the foil a little.  Still great though.

These were the best baby back ribs we have ever had!  My husband does not like them but he loved these.  They where so tender.  I put Jim Goode's BBQ Beef Rub all over the ribs and left them in the refrig over night. I wrapped them aluminum foil sprayed with non stick cooking spray.  Then I cooked them in the oven at 225 degrees for 4 hours.  After that I spread BBQ sauce all over them and cooked them on the grill for about 10 minutes to give them the saucy restaurant look.  They were so good, they were falling off  the bone good and tender.  We loved them I will deffinately make these again.

2 things I added based on others' reviews and the results were wonderful: (1) Cook at 225 degrees for 4 hours and let sit on paper towels to catch the drippings. (2) After done cooking in oven, cook on grill for about 5 min/per side. 

Definitely AWESOME. I know it's not much of a "recipe", but before I saw this I didn't know what to do with ribs, and now I can probably make the best ones in town! :D So thanks!

Delicious! My amendment to the recipe to make your life easier would be to catch the liquid of the baked ribs in the oven by placing foil under the ribs. Also, one person suggested to put barbecue sauce on the top and broil the ribs. This is the best suggestion!

When I made these ribs I was told they were better than restaurant ribs and everyone keeps requesting them!! One person even told me they dreamed about me making more. They were better than my mom's ribs! I didnt really have time to marinate them for more than 1 hour but they still came out great!! I used sweet ray's gourmet barbecue sauce (one sweet and spicy and one honey barbecue). Awesome recipe!!!

I used a dry rub before adding bbq sauce.  Tasted great.  Meat fell off the bones, but I like tender meat on the bones.

Took advice from other reviewers. Only had around 3-4 hrs to marinate. Covered them with Emeril Lagasse "rib rub" plus Baby Ray's BBQ sauce and marinated them for about 3 hrs. Turned out fantastic!

A four star rating just for ease of preparation.  Definitely need a few minutes under the broiler before serving.  Missing a depth of flavor.  Will play around with some seasonings and rubs next time.  Change up the flavor by trying different sauces or make your own.

Very good. Definitely use a dry rub instead of BBQ for marinating overnight. I didn't need to spray the foil. I used the restaurant method of wrapping tightly in saran wrap, then in foil. It can be baked at this low temperature in the plastic wrap as long as it's in foil. The plastic will not melt or leech. If you've ever eaten ribs at a restaurant, they are steamed in plastic wrap. Let them rest and cool for a good 20-30 minutes, then coat with bbq and either grill or broil it on. Very, very good and foolproof.

Wonderful wonderful fall off the bone meat.  I did do what another reviewer recomended and removed the foil and added more bbq sauce and broiled for the last 10 minutes!! Perfect.

First ribs I've ever made, and I found them perfect. My family absolutely loved them and so did I. I did make a few changes, however. First I used a somewhat improvised dry rub of equal parts (I "eyeballed" it lol) garlic powder,  crushed oregano, brown sugar, cajun seasoning (i had it lying around, figured why not? lol), Goya's adobo and then pepper to taste. I marinated the rack of ribs for about 2hrs in this rub w/ some Worcestershire sauce. When I was ready to bake them I sprinkled a bit of salt over them and added the BBQ sauce (I just used Kraft's Mesquite Smoked BBQ Sauce, nothing fancy), then I rapped the ribs with nonstick foil and baked them like the recipe calls for. 30 mins before they were ready I removed the upper part of the foil, added more BBQ sauce and put them back, uncovered, to finish off. This gave them that lovely dark BBQ color. They were nice and tender, juicy and very tasty. Will definitely be making these again.

For the cooking technique, it was a good recipe.  I used the tips from KERI5678 and it turned out very tender (almost fall of the bone) and still had a bit of that bbq crisp from broiling it.  Good for easy in the house cooking on cold winter days (and it didn't smoke out the place either!)

I thought it was great - I just did what the recipe said, no changes - and it was both delicious and tender.  Next time I might try the broiling just to see how it goes, but for the first time EVER cooking ribs - this turned out GREAT!

Well if you want to be hero, here's your chance.  I made them exactly as written but as suggested also applied the dry rub in "Cathy M"'s review.  They could not be more perfect.  Make sure you do two things to the ribs before the cooking:  take off the membrain on the back (slice and peal off using papertowel) and cut off any excess fat.  Also I had more ribs than I needed so I prepared them and froze them in the foil packet for cooking at a later time.  yum!

I have made these twice now... WOW. So fall off the bone delish!!! My husband won't even order ribs out anymore. He says mine are way better. I read a couple review of people saying this isn't a recipe because it is only Ribs and store baught BBQ sauce. I totally dissagree. This is a recipe for RIBS not the sauce. Before this recipe I used to bake my ribs or slow cook them. This is the easiest by far and the way the meat turns out is amazing! Good job! Thanks for posting this recipe, It is now part of my rotation!

I agree with the reviewer who was upset about the "ripping" of this recipe....we all have a favorite BBQ sauce, whether homemade, bottled or a doctored version combining the two. This is exactly how we made our ribs in 4 different restaurants I worked in. The only exception was that we "par-charred" the ribs...ie we broiled them for about 3-4 minutes under the boiler or on a char grill, to get  the nice smokey taste. Then the exact steps of the recipe, and a quick 1-2 minute "finish" under the broiler, after the cooking in foil process, just open the foil, leave 'em on the foil, broil....quick cleanup !! Kudos, Kheffn, I never thought of publishing this method, I thought everyone just "knew" LOL !!

I used Sweet Baby Ray's barbeque sauce and followed the directions, although I did not marinate the ribs overnight.  I only cooked the ribs for 2 hours and at the end, I added more bbq sauce to the tops of the ribs and broiled them for 10 minutes.  They turned out PERFECT!

Amazing and so tasty.  5+ stars!    I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce after I rubbed on this dry rub (suggested by another user):   1/4 cup brown sugar, 	 1 ½ tbsp paprika, 1 tbsp salt,	 1 ½ tbsp pepper, 1 tsp garlic powder,	 1 tsp onion powder, ½ tsp cayenne red pepper. Also, I cooked the ribs for 2 hours then broiled (unwrapped) for 4 minutes per side. YUM!

These ribs were delicious.  I marinated them in the sauce, salt, pepper, onion slices, garlic and onion powder.  Before baking I crumbled 1/2 a beef bouillon cube and poured over a little more sauce. Then baked for 2 hours in a secure foil "pouch" without opening! After two hours, I opened up pouch and poured a thin layer of sauce on the top and broiled for about 10 mins, to get a nice cooked top.  I used really good hickory sauce for that slow smoked flavor, Delicious! and they fell right off the bone~

These ribs were fantastic! I have never made ribs before and live in an apartment so grilling is out of the question. I made sure to take off the membrane on the back of the ribs, covered them in KC Masterpiece BBQ Sauce and let them marinate for about 20 hours. I followed the recipe for the cooking time. Then I took them out of the foil, basted them with some more sauce and put them under the broiler for about 15mins. They were moist, flavorful, and falling off the bone! I severed them along side macaroni and cheese, corn on the cob and bake beans. Thank you so much for such a great, easy and tasty way to prepare ribs! I plan on making these again next weekend!

This recipe was definitely a hit!  I suggest reading some of the reviews and try some of their ideas.  I brushed a little liquid smoke on first then a rib rub then used KC Masterpiece Hot & Spicy sauce. Marinated for 8 hours. Placed the wrapped foil packets on a tin foil cookie sheet.  Cooked for 2 1/2 hours at 300 degrees.  Then removed ribs from packets - put them back on aluminum foil sheets - added more sauce and broiled for 5 minutes.  Excellent!!!!  I gave this recipe 5 stars because the basic idea is what makes the ribs so tender, juicy and easy.

Wow-wee! Awesome!  Easy!  If you like the meat on your ribs to fall off the bone--this is for you.  One note, however, I cooked them the full amount of time in the oven and then removed them to the bbq to brown up a bit; consequently, many of the ribs fell apart as I was putting them on the grill.  Next time, I'll shave a bit of time off the cooking in the oven--hopefully they'll stay together a little bit better.

I am not much of a cook, so I love easy fool proof recipes.  I made these for myself the other night to see if they would turn out before making these for my boyfriend.  Just like everyone said, they fell off the bone!  Oh my god, they were so good!  I can't wait to make these for him.  I didn't use a rib rub either.  Matter of fact, I have no idea what that even is.  For those who said they didn't turn out, I would be willing to bet they didn't buy baby back ribs, because if I can make these...anyone can!  Try this one you will love it.  A kiss goes out to the man who posted this recipe!  Thank you so much!

It's always been hit or miss with me and ribs.  This recipe is ALWAYS a hit.  I don't know why but, I seem to forget to put the ribs in foil the night before so I do it in the morning of the day that we have them and it works out fine.  I use KC Masterpiece original BBQ Sauce and at the end of the cooking time I lay them out on a baking sheet and broil them with additional sauce.  Perfect!!!

I love this recipe!  Two ingredients. And it works like a charm.  Delicious, delicious, delicious.

This is one of those foundations for a great dish on which you can build.  You don't have to be an experienced cook.  Just cook this once and you'll love it.  Next time, try any of the dozen suggestions you'll find in the reviews.  Or make up your own.  It's fun.  It's easy.  And it tastes great.  

My own favorite tweaks:  Tweak 1)  Instead of sauce, I use the dry rub from Cathy M's review.  1/4c. brown sugar, 1 1/2 Tbsp. paprika, 1 Tbsp. kosher salt, 1 1/2 Tbsp. black pepper, 1 tsp. garlic powder, 1 tsp. onion powder, 1/4-1/2 tsp. cayenne red pepper.  Makes enough for three racks, if you need to stretch that far. 

Favorite Tweak 2) When you have completed the recipe, douse it with sauce and place it under the oven broiler, uncovered for 7-10 minutes.  It's still easy.  And it tastes even better.

Not bad, but not amazing either.  I used good quality bbq sauce and even put a dry rug mixture on ribs and marinated several hours before cooking.  I couldn't imagine them being any better without some sort of seasoning.  They were falling off the bone like everyone else said but there wasn't an amazing flavor.

Best ribs I've ever had...If you like the meat to fall off the bone and not have to "work" for your food!  Also, I don't like to eat fat, so when the meat/fat falls right off the bones like it does, it's very easy to only pick at the meat and not have to chew on fat; I really liked that part of these.  Also just so tasty.  I did do the rub as some previously stated, and I also put on BBQ sauce.  I would say the rub recipe I used off here, was very spicy.  My kids had real hard time eating these due to spice, so I would tweek that next time.  So easy to cook though in foil and clean-up was a breeze.  My foil packets did leak slightly and I was unable to get the baked-on sauce off the pan, but I used an old pan.  So if you use a good baking pan, I would lay down a layer of foil to protect it in case packets leak.

Best ribs EVER! I put Zarda rub on them before the BBQ sauce. I also broil them out of the foil meaty side up on high after I put a little more BBQ sauce on top. My hubby likes it when I burn it a little. I've had dinner guests tell me they're the best ribs they've ever had.

Superb!!! Used Cathy M.'s suggestion of a rub, which I used. Everyone was so impressed, and I was too since this was the first time I had attempted baby back ribs.

I just followed the recipe. I used a store bought BBQ marinade. Seasoned the ribs and let them set, and them poured the marinade and let them sit overnight. Sprayed the foil and cooked for 2 1/2 hours. Ribs fell off the bone like others suggested. I read people removing the membrane. I didn't bother still was good to me. Great recipe will keep on hand always. Definitely spray the foil for non-stick clean up. That helped greatly.

Fall off the bone yummy! I used to work at a chain resteraunt where you boiled the pork first in the morning and then grilled it with sauce to order. What a pain! We live in Indiana so barbequing (sp?) is not always an option.

The cooking method is what is important here - you can use anything on the ribs - sauce, dry rub whatever but they are really moist and tender cooking this way.

Oh my goodness these were amazing. My family loved it. I used the brown sugar spice rub recommended by the other reviewer. These rate as good as your favorite rib place. Served them with sweet potato wedge fries (a recipe from Bobby Flay). Excellent. can't rave enough.

These were excellent. Followed the other recommendations and used a dry rub before the sauce.  Only cooked for 2 hours in the oven and 15 minutes on the grill.  Perfect.

Contrary to a thousand other reviewers, I am only giving this 3 stars.  True, they were super easy to prepare.  Yes, the meat did fall off the bone.  But my rating comes from the fact that 1) they had no taste until we slathered on more sauce after removing them from the foil, which the recipe does say to do, and 2) I guess I like a little crunchiness to my ribs.  These were soft all the way around which made the meat literally fall off and a little mushy.  I like gnawing on bones for my meat if I'm going to indulge on ribs!  ;)  I'll stick with eating ribs when I'm out at a restaurant.

I really don't care if this is a cooking method or a recipe as it has become my favorite way of cooking spareribs! My only addition is to add a lot of Tabasco sauce to add some bite.

I got this recipe through my email and smiled. I've been using this recipe for years. And it is great. I would change one thing however. I would cut the slab in half. that way you dont have to use extra long foil. And I only cook my ribs for 2 hrs. I think 2 1/2 is over kill.

I followed the recipe once and it was indeed good. The second time I changed up a bit and it was cooked to perfection. Here's what I did: I marinated overnight with Cathy M's amazing dry rub (double sized for 4 pounds ribs) and added real garlic (4 cloves sliced lenghthwise), 1 tbsp dried parsley and 1 tsp dried oregano. Marinated the ribs on the rub overnight. The next day I cooked the marinated ribs (no BBQ sauce) for 2 hours covered with a foil. Removed ribs from oven, brushed them generously with BBQ sauce and took back them to the oven for another 30 minutes cooking them covered once again. Took out from the oven and let it rest for 30 minutes. Just before serving I took the ribs back to the oven and broiled on high (bottom shelf) for approx 10 minutes. I did no use the foil pouches, but preferred to cook them on a large rectangle pirex sprayed with vegetable oil and dealt with the mess later. It was not very hard to clean up.

Oh yeah!  I cannot tell you how long I have put off trying to cook ribs because I thought they were so time-consuming.  Not so!  I used store bought sauce and marinated for about 24 hours, cooked for just under 2 1/2 hours and then slapped them on the grill just to get a little bit of the smoky flavor!  Cooked them for the 4th and everyone loved them and wanted more!  Thanks for the great, easy recipe!

A most excellent find!  The tin foil cooking method makes cooking killer ribs super easy and relatively mess free.  I used pork ribs (not baby back) and found that I needed to leave them in for an extra 35 min.  Only gave 4 stars because I wouldn't have known to take the membrane off if it weren't for reading all of the reviews.  Thank You!!

I have never been a rib lover, too much work, too little meat, so as a result my dh would make them on the grill when he wanted them.  This recipe though, so simple, was a big hit.  Little work and big reward.  Thanks so much for this recipe.

Outstanding recipe.  Followed the recipe except added a couple of shakes of hot sauce for a kick.  Next time I will cut down on the cayenne pepper as it was a bit too hot.  I made the dry rub and the ribs were delicious.  So moist and tasty.

five stars because of Cathy M's rub!!  I removed the membrane and sprinkled the rub on the ribs last night, then wrapped in foil.  This morning I let them sit on the counter to warm up for a half hour, then put BBQ sauce on them and rewrapped.  They were fully cooked in 2 hrs, pulled them out brushed with some bbq sauce then broiled til they got carmelized.  They were DIVINE!!  The bone pulled right out!

(Definitely remove the back membrane before rubbing spices on). Then use Sweet Baby Rays's BBQ. Broil with more sauce before serving

super super tender.  Bought the baby back ribs from Costco.  Tried taking the back part of the rib like everyone was writing about, but couldn't seem to do it.  It was so tender anyways.  I did do a dry rub first and then bbq, but I think I would find another rub to make the meat more flavorful next time.  It was still a huge hit and would definitely cook it like this next time.

I cooked these for my son's birthday today and he said they were the best ribs ever and were better than a restaurant.  I have to agree with him.  I used they recipe and the dry rub that "Cathy" used along with Sweet Baby Ray's bbq sauce.

I put the dry rub on and wrapped them in heavy duty aluminum foil and marinated for 6 hours.  Cooked for 2 hours @ 300 degrees.  Let stand for about an hour.  Basted ribs with Sweet Baby Ray's sauce and transferred to a preheated grill.  Cooked bone-side down for 10 minutes, turned over and cooked about 5 extra minutes.  They meat was so tender!!!!!

Thanks to KHEFFN who posted this recipe and to all who contributed their versions!!!

Wow! This is a great recipe! SO easy and really good! I set my grill to 300, walked way for 2 hours and when I came back the meat just fell off the bone. 5 stars for simplicity and deliciousness!

I wasn't impressed w/these at all. I used Sweet Baby Rays original(which is my go-to) but didn't feel the ribs had a whole lot of flavor. I guess I really missed the grilled flavor. I would have to make additions & changes in order to give this a higher rating, but that would make it a whole new recipe, right?!

I adapted this a bit - rubbed ribs with Pappy's seasoning (after removing membrain) then lined a cookie sheet with foil put ribs on then covered tightly with another sheet of heavy duty foil.  Cooked for 2 hours then drained fat off, lathered with BBQ sauce (we like Bullseye) and put under broiler for 20 minutes, and they turned out very tender.  (This summer will try grilling instead of broiler)  Serve with roasted veggies and baked potato VERY EASY meal.

Ribs have always been my Achilles Heel. However, this is the one recipe that redeemed my grilling reputation. I make these according to the recipe with a few changes. Number 1: I cook them on the grill! Number 2: I use a dry rub (because my son doesn't like BBQ sauce) on all 4 ribs (2 ribs cut in half to make 4 pieces). The dry rub I use is Dry BBQ rub, Season All, Ground Black Pepper and onion powder. I usually put the dry rub on 12 hours before cooking and then on 2 of the pieces I put BBQ Sauce (Sweet Baby Rays) on 6 hours before cooking. I then cook them on the grill for about 2 hours and then remove them from the foil (it makes a hell of a mess) and then put them back on the grill with direct heat for about 15 minutes to crispen the outside. I also baste on some more BBQ sauce at this point and let it caramelize.  These always turn out AWESOME and I thank KHEFFN for this recipe!

Delicious.  I didn't have time to  marinate.  So I used the brown sugar rub other people recommended and baked.  Then threw on the grill with barbeque sauce until the sauce caramelized.  Yum!

I made these ribs with the sauce and refrigerated over night. I did broil for 5 minutes and they were perfect. My husband loved them and wants me to make them again.  I used the rub on wings and marinated  in refrigerater 1hour. I put them on foil lined pan and covered with foil for the last hour that the ribs where in the oven.  I removed both from their foil packages and put on foil lined cookie sheet and broiled for 5 minutes. Both came our perfect.

I had never made ribs before.  I followed the recipe, and happy I picked up on removing the underside membrane with a paper towel. Very easy.  They were just as good as Adams Rib Restaurant.  I can't wait for next summer to make it again.  I prepared them at home, then finished them on a grill for a cookout with family and they all made pigs of themselves...as usual.. :)

I made these hoping to get a decent non-smoky end product for family members who don't care for properly smoked dry ribs, but the relatively high temp and quick cook time didn't allow the fat and connective tissue to properly render. After cooking per recipe and getting a big mouthful of squishy fat, I threw the remaining ribs on the gas grill for 20 minutes on high hoping to tighten them up and better carmelize the sauce. The sauce looked beautiful and had a nice taste and texture but the insides were still wrong.

Super easy! I cook these even longer, until they're almost falling off the bone. Then I coat them with extra sauce and put them under the broiler for a few minutes on each side to "dry them out." The broiler time really improves them.

The ribs always come out great!  The one thing that I do that my husband learned years ago when working at a rib restaurant in SC is to peel off the membrane on the back of each rack first.  You can get underneath with a knife and then rip it back.  It is supposed to make the meat more tender.  Also, I put them on the grill (after they are cooked) for a few minutes to brown them.

I like to follow the recipe then remove the ribs and place them on my charcoal grill with a nice piece of water soaked hickory for about 30 - 45 min basting with more sauce finishes them off nice that way

I didnt marinade my ribs, but I followed the cooking technique and they were fantastic.  I coated my ribs with a rub of brown sugar and a cajun spice mix I make, and cooked them for 2 and half hours at 300 degrees. Then I grilled them on the BBQ w/ sauce for about 15-20 minutes. Excellent!  Fall-off-the-bone yummy.  This is the only way I will cook ribs from now on.

This was so easy!  We didn't have time marinade.  Just put on the spices, wrapped it and and baked.  I appreciated that it was not at all complicated and they came out beautifully.  Put them on the grill at the end with bbq sauce.  Eldest daughter said it was like going to our fave rib place.

Finally I found a reciepe that is easy but makes wonderful ribs! I did not use a rub like other reviewers but only bottled BBQ sauce.  We like Bull's Eye Original. I cooked the ribs at 275 for about 3 hours.  When I toook the ribs out of the foil, I was careful not to spill out the watery, greasey liquid. It was thrown out with  the foil. I put the ribs in a baking pan sprayed with Pam. I spread a little more sauce on the ribs and put them under the broiler for 5 minutes or so. They were perfect!

This was my first time cooking ribs and it was quite successful. The meat was perfectly tender. Don't forget to remove the membrane from the back of the ribs...so much better that way.

great method, only thing i suggest is to flip them over and peel the membrane off of them before you cook them, even more "fall off the bone" also in the oven cook them meaty side down, and the last 15 minutes take them out of the foil and put more sauce on them and either, cook them on the grill for 15min or so or on broil for 15 minutes....bomp chicka bow wow!

I have officially been upgraded to possible wife status by my boyfriend.  I used the dry rub recipe from this site and was blown away.  I never knew that ribs were so easy to cook!!!  Update:  I make these all the time, especially for big dinner parties.  The Hefty disposable foil sheets are a lifesaver.  Warning, these babies WILL leak... and they will leak everywhere... be prepared for it.  I do 1/2 w/ dry rub, 1/2 w/ BBQ sauce.  Yummy.  Update 2:  I followed others advice and broiled them for about 15 minutes..  DID NOT LIKE THAT!  The ribs were definitely not as tender and "fall off the bone" as they normally are.

Mmmmm MMMmmm this recipe was great!!  I used Jack Daniels Tennessee Hickory Sauce, which comes with a free basting brush attached, very convenient!  I didn't have time to marinade, so I just cut the ribs into 3-4 rib sections, brushed on the sauce, and wrapped in the foil.  I also didn't have time to slow roast, so I upped the temp to 350 and cooked for 1.5 hrs.  I took others suggestions and brushed on more sauce after they baked, and then broiled uncovered for about 12 min........DEFINITELY DO THIS!!  It gives the ribs that "sticky" feel and appearance like you get in restaurants, and makes them look much more appetizing!  I also lined everything with foil, so cleanup was a breeze!  Served with scallopped potatoes and green beans, and my husband couldnt have been happier with dinner.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

If I'd made this as the recipe states, it would get 3 stars: Not only would there not as much flavor, the 'sauce' would have been extremely thin and watery. However, if you follow the advice of others - 1. Marinade the meat with dry rub (I used garlic powder, s&p, onion powder, paprika, brown sugar) as well as BBQ sauce and 2. Open up the foil, coat the ribs with sauce, then bake/broil so that a nice crust forms - this is definitely 5 stars (It's kind of stupid that so many people give this recipe 5 stars after making these kind of changes). It's a shame the ribs I used were so fatty... Oh well. I will definitely try this again! Thanks, Ken!

The meat just falls off the bone.  I added some onions to the marinade and cooked it for about 3 hours instead of two.  Excellent!

I, too tried this method using a dry rub, and only adding sauce at the very end.  The ribs were tender as could be, and clean-up was a snap!
A great way to do ribs--maybe even better than the grill!

Turns out like a pork pot roast, but nothing like baby backs in a decent rib house.  What do these people mean by "restaurant-quality"?  McRib?  Honestly, that's what the taste and texture bring to mind.  Inoffensive at best, nothing more.

Very easy but not quite as tasty as others.  Need to incorporate the grill to get that real bbq flavor.  How to do that is another question.... :-)

My husband and I both love this recipe. I have also used the same method to cook chicken and a chuck roast.  I used my crock pot instead of baking and it worked great! A little crumpled foil in the bottom of the crock pot and a cup of water then add the foil wrapped meat.  Cook on low for 8-10 hrs.  This is a great recipe and I will be using it again and again!

Delicious and easy. The meat was so tender, it fell off the bones. My family loved it, my kids ate the ribs till they were stuffed. I highly recommend this recipe. Thank you Ken!

O.M.G.  This is the easiest recipe EVER and so Delicious.  I agree it needed some salt but i'm watching the salt so just added a few sprinkles during dinner.  Since the slabs i purchased were so big i lined a big pan with foil, covered with sauce and topped with some more foil as tightly as I could. once the timer went off after 2.5 hours, i added more sauce, turned up the oven to about 400 and baked an additional 15 minutes or so uncovered.  I served with more BBQ sauce.  thank you for such a wonderful recipe, my holiday cooking has never been easier!

This is the only way to do baby back ribs!  And as this recipe is really just directions for a cooking method, you can experiment with different BBQ sauces till your heart is content. 
I make my own sauce.  I have a large, shallow, rectangular roasting pan and use that.  Lay the ribs in, pour the sauce over, cover tightly with foil (do not let any steam escape!).
After 2.5 hours I take them out, pour the sauce into a saucepan and reduce, then glaze the ribs and broil for another 10 min.  These are hit every time I make them.  Way better then on the grill.

Fantastic! Did the dry rub mentioned and used sweet baby rays. Depends on the cut of meat but one half of the ribs were literally fall off the bone.

Super easy. I don't even marinate overnight and they still cook up perfectly. I finish them under the broiler for a couple of minutes to get a nice crackle.

I like it! The "texas crutch" foil wrapping approach works well. My test run was 2.25 hours at 300F with about 10 mins/side under the broiler to finish and get some carmelization. 

I like the texture and done-ness of the ribs. For this test run I more or less followed the simple recipe, favorite sauce, wrap, leave overnight,bake.

I will tweak sauces later, but the foil wrap and bake method is the best non-bbq approach I have found so far.

This recipe was excellent. I made two changes. First,  I generously salted (with saltless salt) and peppered the ribs before baking them. Lastly, after the ribs were done, I put on more BBQ sauce and put the ribs back in the oven on broil for 5-7 minutes. Fantastic!

This was delicious!  This was my first time making ribs.  It was so easy.  I was too impatient to wait a whole day to bake but I read a review from someone who only marinated them for 20 minutes.  I did the same and they came out great.  They were a hit with my family.  I will definitely make again but I'll let them marinate for the 8 hours.

I never take the time to write reviews but must give a big thanks to the poster.  I have always struggled to make a good rib.  The dry rub I use and the sauce were not the issues but simply getting them tender enough.  No longer an issue now.

I drenched the rubs in Red Wine vinegar and a homemade dry rub.  They marinated for 2 hours and then I placed barbecue sauce on them.  Put them in foil to bake at 300 degrees for 2 hours.  I placed them on the grill for 15 minutes and they were done perfectly. No need to go out for good ribs anymore.

Simple, straightforward, AND tasty! Now that's what I call a good recipe! Pick your favorite BBQ sauce and enjoy. It's not that I dislike fancy recipes that require gourmet herbs n' spices and hours of preparation time but this is SO simple and delicious I really can't hold that against it.

Hi everyone! I used spare ribs browned the ribs first in EVOoooh no :) I placed them in foil pans, made one flavor homemade honey garlic ginger teriyaki and one oney mustard BBQ.  I put tons of seasonings on them and tons of garlic then covered with foil and baked as directed. i served them with extra sauce, cut up into individual ribs. Nom nom nom!!!  VERY inexpensive for ribs and simply delicious!

These ribs were great.  I used the dry rub suggested by Cathy M and let that sit on the ribs over night.  I mixed a sweet BBQ sauce with a smokey one and added 1/2 a cup of pineapple jam.  I stirred this together with a small squirt of sriracha sauce and basted the ribs in this before wrapping in foil and baking for 2.5 hrs at 300.  Unwrapped, turned the oven way down and added more sauce.  They were sticky/spicy/sweet and falling apart they were so tender.  I do not have a BBQ...didnt need one!  Will use this method over and over again.  NEVER BOIL RIBS!!!  You boil all the flavor out!!

As easy and simple as stated! It's a "recipe" when it makes something this delicious! I rubbed the ribs with a pepper mix and used Sweet Baby Rays sauce. Definitely broil at the end. 5-Stars!!

Excellent. Did 300 degrees for 2 hours, then 425 for 15 minutes after I opened them and basted with a bit more sauce. Used Central BBQ dry rub from food network first, then sauce, marinated for 3 hours. Used KC masterpiece for sauce, would try again with that or Stubbs depending on if you like sweet or spicy.  Solid.

Super easy.  I've used beef ribs as well, but increased cooking time to almost 3 hours.  I also put a generous sprinkle of Old Bay Seasoning on as a dry rub before the honey and BBQ sauce (Sweet Baby Ray's Original) to give them a bit more kick.

This rating is given for the recipe as originally provided.  If the original recipe had included the dry rub mentioned in the reviews as well as the tip to grill with additional sauce as the finishing touch, the review would absolutely have been 5 stars.  I tried the ribs after baking but before grilling and was much happier with them after being grilled.  However, the cooking method described was very helpful as a key part of the process.

I followed others suggestions and made the rub, marinated them for about 8 hours. Cooked them at 300 for an hour with only the rub, then put sauce (sweet baby rays) on for the remaining time. I broiled them for about 10-15 minutes and they were perfect. The family ate them all up!

I've been doing ribs this way for a few years, but bake them at 350 for 1 1/2 hours. If you can finish them off on the BBQ just a quick browning on each side.

This is similar to the method I always use.  I sprinkle the meat with Nature's Seasons before putting in the foil packets.  Cook in the oven as directed.  Remove from the foil, baste with barbecue sauce (we like Sweet Baby Ray's spicy sauce) and brown on the grill for about 10 minutes.

Fall off the bone tender and moist, too! No knife is needed with these. The meat really does come right off the bone. I did put them under the broiler for a few minutes to darken them up a bit. Be sure to use a sauce that you like!

I must say I was a little skeptical about this recipe, but it turned out amazing.....this was a last minute idea, so I only had time to marinade them for 2.5 hours. I used the grill mates rub and sweet baby rays BBQ sauce and these ribs were finger licking good.  They fell off the bones and my boys who are very picky eaters ate seconds and were licking their fingers.  I have found the way I will make ribs from now on.....DELISH

If you don't have time to marinate overnight or the 8 hours it recommends don't shy away from this recipe.  I made it for a group dinner last night and only had time for two hours.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's sauce and they came out perfect!

AMAZING! I've made these several times and every time they come out mouthwatering good. It's hard to believe that something so good can come from marinating in a bottle of barbeque sauce.

I always use Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce. I also open the foil packets at the end, switch the heat to Broil, then baste with the remaining sauce for 5 minutes to get a nice crispy top. 

Best Ribs EVER.

Turned out perfect everytime. I made them with the original recipe, then tried using Cathy's rub on the comments here and that is how I've cooked the ribs many, many times. I use Cathy's rub for chicken and other pork cuts, it's awesome.
Some say it's not a recipe, too simple, but it's being used quite a bit so I guess that answers that.
Thanks KHEFFN.

This recipe is definitely 5 star with just slight modifications.  Before brushing the ribs with barbecue sauce and refrigerating them overnight, I rubbed them with paprika and McCormick pork rub, which gave them added flavor.  I also baked them for three hours, instead of 2-1/2 hours.  Finishing them off the last 15 minutes on the outdoor grill with soaked hickory chips gave them a great smoked flavor, but I avoided putting them directly over the coals.  They did, indeed, fall off the bone.

This recipe was easy and delicious.  I took the advice of previous reviewers and broiled the ribs the last part of the cooking time.  This was my first time cooking ribs and I am so happy with the outcome.  They were gobbled up fast, and now I can't wait to make them again.

These ribs turned out beautifully and tasted great.  Moist and flavorful.  I used the Memphis Rub recipe from this site on them first, then slathered with sauce and wrapped overnight.  Forgot the Pam spray, luckily no problems with sticking foil.  Baked as directed and they were perfect.  Slathered with more hot sauce before serving.  Loved this recipe, thanks KHEFFN.

My father in law made these over Thanksgiving - following the original recipe to the letter.  I don't generally like ribs and I could NOT get enough of these!  I'm making them for Christmas Eve lunch for my whole family.  Thanks for a fantastic recipe.

I'm not a ribs person, but this was excellent and EASY!!  I ran out of aluminum foil, so I placed the ribs in my Le Creuset dutch oven and it worked out very well. Took the top off for the last 15-20 minutes to allow the sauce to dry up a bit on the ribs.  My husband loved them!!

This was yummy! I skipped the marinade and went straight to the baking and it turned out great. Ribs were soo tender they fell off the bone, I did what another review said and with 15 minutes left broiled with barbeque sauce..sweet baby rays of course! Threw some foiled potatoes in there with them and had an easy cleanup meal..will definately definately cook again. so simple just have to plan ahead.

Perfect.  I can't believe how tender they were!  I did apply more bbq sauce and broiled them for about 7 min just until they had carmelized enough.  When I can't do them on the grill or smoker I will definately be cooking them this way again!!

These ribs are great.  I do not marinate them overnight.  I just put them in the oven with bbq sauce wrapped in foil just like it says for 2 1/2 hours.  They are WONDERFUL!  My husband is a meat and potatoes man and says I can make these every night of the week!

Made just as directed; just used a couple of drops of liquid smoke in each foil packet. WONDERFUL flavor - tender off the bone meat. EASY and so tasty! I used Sweet Baby Ray's sauce.  YUMMMMM. No mess either, - slow cooked outside on the grill, unwrapped foil last few minutes. ;o*

The recipe was a hit! Lots of compliments. Very moist and tender. Great "one-recipe-fits-all" meal. Works well for little kids who like finger-food, right on up to older folks who want soft food that can be eaten with a fork. I brushed on a thin coat of mustard to help the rub stick to the meat (you can't taste the mustard later). Left them in the fridge overnight, then cooked them early in the morning. Reheated them for dinner. I made twice baked potatoes to go along with the ribs and while the ribs reheated, the potatoes baked for the second time. Easy! Yummy!

I followed Cathy M's tips, as I wanted to finish ours off on the grill too and even though the ribs only marinated in the spice rub for a couple of hours and I accidentally had the oven at 325 degrees instead of 300, they turned out...Fantastic!! Even my Father-in-law, who isn't a rib fan, really enjoyed them! :)

Very good.  I don't grill them, but open the foil the last 15 minutes of cooking to get a crust on them.  Made several times - we love them.

These ribs were absolutely amazing. I would suggest a few ideas. Usind the rib rub described in Cathy M.'s review these were by far some of the best ribs me and my father have had. Using only the rub for the marinating proccess bake for 2 hours on 300 degrees farenheit. Let stand for 1 hour to allow the ribs to stiffen. Before grilling mix your favorite bbq sauce with some of the rib juice left over after backing to help thin the sauce out and make it taste much better. After applying sauce put on the grillin medium heat for about 5 minutes a side brushing on extra sauce. When done enjoy! Also grilling helps to make the bbq sauce litteraly stick on the ribs and helps caramilize the sauce. These ribs were absollutely AMAZING!! Cannot wait til the next time i make these! Also this recipe was so simple my 11 yr. old some made them and were still amazing!

If you want awesome ribs, you have to try this. I also used a rub overnight like other viewers did, then put just a little BBQ sauce on them. After I pulled them out of the oven, I slapped them on the grill for 10 mins or so and slathered them in a rib glaze that I got from a local BBQ restaurant. The meat fell off the bones and the flavor was tremendous. Making them again today for 4th of July!

Great Ribs! The key is the slow cooking in the oven.  When I took out of the foil, I added more BBQ sauce, then put the ribs right on the grill for just 5 mins to add a fresh grill taste.  Meat fell off the bone--a family favorite!

Thanks also to Cathy M's review!!!  I have used her recipe/review twice now - both on baby back and on spare ribs and they were both a huge success.  My husband loves this recipe and he is a huge rib fan.  Very easy and foolproof.  Thanks again!

I don't normally write reviews but I had to for these ribs.  I would give them 20 stars id I could.  They are amazing.  I did use a dry rub (from this site) but that was for our own personal taste, they would be great without it.  Wonderful!!!

Holy moly, these were amazing!  One of the reviews criticizes this recipe for being nothing more than a bottle of bbq sauce and a cooking method, but the key here IS the cooking method. I really don't like ribs, but since the rest of my family does, I figured I'd try to find a recipe that I would like.  This one really made a believer out of me!  I made one modification prior to cooking - I used the spice rub given in Cathy M.'s review... DELICIOUS.  After removing the membranes, I just rubbed it into the meat really well, then I coated them liberally (without overkill) with Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ Sauce (YUM) and wrapped them one rack at a time in foil.  I only had an hour to let them marinate, and they were still fabulous! Baked for 2 1/2 hours and then grilled a few minutes on each side at the end while also basting one last time in bbq sauce.  Simply delicious and literally falling off the bone.

OMGoodness!! These ribs were the best we've EVER had! I started with the dry rub suggested by others which included brown sugar, onion powder, garlic powder, salt, pepper and cayenne pepper. Removed the membrane, and rubbed in the dry rub. I then took Sweet Baby Ray's Honey Barbeque Sauce and brushed front and backs of ribs. Wrapped each slab in foil and put in refridgerator to "get happy" for the next 20 hours. Heated the oven to 300 degrees, and put slabs with foil on cookie sheet for 2 1/2 hours. The house smelled DELICIOUS as these were baking! I removed the ribs from foil and put in broiler pan and then turned on broiler and every few seconds kept turning the pans so they could char up a bit. I fed a group of 9, and everyone was licking their fingers!! The rub and sauce actually was absorbed into the meat and was not just a topping of sauce on the ribs. Try this one!!! It is a little work and prep time, but so worth it in the end!!!! Hope you find that it is better than any restaurant ribs you'll ever eat! Enjoy!!

Fabulous!!! I made these the other night for a party and they were a huge hit. I did follow the directions for a rub from Cathy M but I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce. Instead of finishing them on the grill I finished them under the broiler for a few minutes. Thanks for the great recipe.

This cooking method is excellent! I used a homemade BBQ sauce and after I had all my ribs wrapped in foil I realized I forgot to spray the cooking spray on the foil! Didn't matter - with all the juice and fat that came off the ribs, I had no problem with the meat sticking to the foil. Finished it off with a last brush of sauce and a couple of minutes under the broiler. I cut them into individual ribs and put them on a platter. My sister couldn't believe that these were homemade. She accused me of purchasing them. Sooo tender...you don't even need teeth to eat these ribs! Made this again without marinating overnight. Didn't soak the BBQ sauce flavor up as much as overnight marination but still yummy and super tender!!

As the recipe promised, Simple, delicious  and the meat falls off the bone. Next time I'll flip the ribs on the charcoal  grill after baking for some additional  flavor. THIS IS A KEEPER. Thank You for sharing.

5 stars for giving me the best cooking method to make at home the ribs we used to have to go out for. Baking these in foil as directed gives me fall of the bone ribs every time.  I don't marinade in sauce, I rub with KC Rib Doctor and most of the time bake right away. I use Sweet Baby Ray's sauce at the end, unwrap ribs, brush it on and put the ribs under the broiler just long enough to caramelize some of the sugar in the sauce. Like I said Perfection every time.

These were absolutely wonderful and super easy to make.!  I used the Reynolds Wrap non stick foil, McCormicks pork rub and Sweet Baby Ray's sauce and baked them at 275 degrees for 3 hours.  They were tender but did not fall apart as they often do with other cooking methods.  I unwrapped them, topped with some BBQ sauce and broiled for a few minutes.  GREAT, family loved them!  Thanks!

My modifications.  Day before cooking, cut 2 baby back slabs into halfs.  Rubbed them with a dry rub of 1/2 cup Gebhardt's chili powder, 1 tsp cumin, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp onion powder, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1 tsp salt, 1 tsp ground pepper.  Coated the rubbed halfs with yellow prepared mustard.  Wrapped each half in foil and refrigerated for 12 hours.  Heated the oven to 375, put the foil pack ribs on a lined cookie sheet in the oven for 30 min.  Dropped the temp to 255, left the ribs for 3 hours.  They were a bit too loose, would cut back time to 2.5 hours.  Made a hot direct heat grill, removed the ribs from the foil, and placed them curve side down on the grill.  Used one cup of Jack Daniel's BBQ sauce on each slab and cooked 5 min.  Flipped them, used one more cup of JDs BBQ sauce, cooked 5 more minutes.  Took them off the grill, let'em set under foil ten minutes while I plated up the sides.  Very, very good.  I never BBQ in the oven, until now.  Will do it again.

I basically rated this on the "meat fall off the bone" part of the recipe because I thats all I was really looking for and it worked like a charm.  Refrigerating overnight REALLY does make a difference.  When you cook the ribs make sure they are flipped up they way you plan on eating them, if you do it the opposite way with an intent to broil them towards the end you may potentially have a burnt line going down the middle of the ribs.  On my ribs I seasoned with a light coat honey dijon mustard (I hate mustard too but was told this was like essential thing to do for ribs) and sprinkled a good amount of emeralds original seasoning, than I lathered on a small coat of barbecue sauce.  Don't over do the first lather of BBQ because it all ends up falling off the rib anyway, you will def need to rebaste during the last mins.  Broil towards the end to make it stick, DON'T broil for 15 mins, you risk severely burning the ribs, I'd broil for 2-3 mins max on about 450, thats all it takes for the coat to stick.  Definitely don't forget to peel the nasty membrane off the bottom at the beginning of the prep.

Added a dry rub of salt, pepper, paprika, and brown sugar before wrapping in foil.  Did not overnight it and still turned out great!

Great way to cook ribs! I was always so scared to cook ribs..but now, my family thinks I am a pro! Thanks for sharing this!! By the way, I added garlic powder as my dry rub before putting the bar-b-que sauce. Then when cooked, I added brown sugar and some more bar-b-que sauce before I broil it for another 10 mins. Thanks again!!!

Very, very good.  Use your favorite bbq sauce.  We like to throw on the grill for just a quick sear at the end before serving.

I used the Honey Garlic sauce found in this site but baked the ribs according to this recipe because I wanted very tender ribs, and I'm glad I did! These were the most tender ribs I've tasted for a while! I've also marinated the ribs for 4 hours beforehand for extra flavor. The only changes/suggestions I'd make is to open up the wrapped ribs, scoop a bit of sauce onto the ribs and bake for an additional 15min (wrap open) for a better look/texture.

These ribs are awesome!!  I used to cook my ribs for hours and they were never this tender.  They truly fall right off the bone.  After baking these, I add more sauce and cook them under the broiler for about 10-15 minutes.

Also, I always remove the skin on the underside of the ribs.  Take a sharp knife (like a paring knife) and slide it under the skin to get it started.  Then, because it's so slipery, I use a paper towel to pull the skin off.  Once I get it started, it usually comes off in one piece.

VERY IMPORTANT: Use heavy duty aluminum foil doubled over.  The first time I made these I used regular foil and it leaked and I had a mess.

Everyone was right.  These ribs fall off the bone and are just as good, if not better, than if you went to "Tony Romas".   I took other reviewers advice and put a Dry Rub on first (from this site "Dry Rob" by Denise Smith) and also used the Sweet Baby Rays Sauce.  I will never make my Baby Backs any other way but this way.  If you're a Baby Back Rib lover you MUST try this recipe.

These were GREAT!!  They fell right off the bone and were really tasty.  We use Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce.

These were really good.  My wife loved the recipe as is.  I put mine on the grill for the last 45 minutes to make the outside a little crispier.  Also tried broiling mine for a few minutes at the end.  They were good that way also.

The best ever! I have tried so many times to make 
tender ribs, and have failed horribly. When I used this recipe they came out perfect. However, 
I did remove the ribs from the foil, add more bbq 
sauce and broil for about 10 minutes. They came out perfect!  Thank you for a great recipe!

I couldnt believe how simple and easy this was to make good ribs.  I found it works a little better with the larger spare ribs -vs- babyback ribs.  I also broiled it the last 20 minutes to get a nicer flavor

This  is a great recipe and so easy. I get rave reviews every time for the tenderness of the ribs. You can get them all ready the day before and just pop in the oven and forget them.  Perfect for a large crowd!

Yep ~ The meat fell RIGHT off the bone! I went to pick up the rack by a bone and the bone slid right out! I used a dry rub and let marinate overnight then marinated w/bbq sauce the whole day.  The only problem I had is that I wish the ribs I had less fat on them.  I got the leanest ones I could find.  Thumbs up!

I had never made ribs and these were excellent.  The meat did literally fall off the bone.  Following the advice of other reviewers, I made the Dry Rub for Ribs (found on this site), peeled off the bottom "skin", and used the rub prior to brushing with sauce - also found on this site.  I put them on a cookie sheet in the oven and turned them over after the first hour.  There was no problem with burning.  I also grilled them over wood chips (low-indirect) the last twenty minutes and they turned out perfectly. Best I've ever had, and my boyfriend agreed.

Tried many recipes for ribs over the years. This is not only one of the easiest, it is also extremely reliable. One change I recommend - after baking, sauce 'em up and broil for a couple of minutes as others have suggested

I followed the recipe as directed, marinating the ribs overnight.  Cooked about 8 pounds of ribs (3 slabs of baby back ribs from Costco). I cooked @300 degrees for 2-1/2 hours and turned off the oven then let the ribs sit in heat for another 20-30 minutes. I then removed the ribs (which I placed in foil and then inside Pyrex dishes) back in the clean Pyrex,  with fresh BBQ sauce. Broiled for about 10-15 minutes. They fell off the bone while cutting up. This will be my "indoor" rib recipe forever!! =~}

I have to agree that this method of cooking the ribs is excellent! I just put a dry rub on them wrapped in foil (sprayed with oil) and popped them in my oven. I didn't marinate, no time. That is where using a rub comes in handy, big flavors without having to marinate.My husband and son said they were the BEST ribs they had ever had! At the end I coated with Sweet Baby Rays and broiled for a few minutes. Awesome. I also cut the ribs into sections of about 4 bones each and wrapped. I'll never make ribs any other way again. Thanks KHEFFN!!!

Love the ease of this recipe. I'm a rib lover from way back and when I buy my ribs I remove the membrane from the back of the ribs and use a rib rub (KC Masterpiece sweet heat) then I vacuum pack them one rack to a seal a meal bag, for the freezer. So all I had to do was thaw wrap in foil and bake. At about the hour forty five minute mark I unwrap drain fat and pour on the Bourbon Whiskey BBQ Sauce I make from Kevin find it here  http://allrecipes.com/recipe/bourbon-whiskey-bbq-sauce/detail.aspx I love to cook but I love to enjoy my guests more so this recipe lets me do both.

OMG! This recipe is so amazingly simple and sooooo delicious. I have been in the food industry for 18 years, but have stayed clear of cooking ribs for so loong in fear of overcooking them or incorrectly cooking them. I have to say, I read a few reviews and applied some hints to my all-star effort. I bought a 3# rack of ribs and split in into 3 portions. I put the dry rub on from one of the reviews and bbq sauce. I wrapped each portion indvidually in foil and let marinade for 2 hours in the fridge. I cooked the ribs, still wrapped in foil, in a 13x9 pan just in case of drippings or leakage from the foil. I cooked ribs at 275 for 2hrs. I unwrapped ribs, lined pan with foil, applied another coat of bbq sauce, and broiled ribs for about 7min. I let ribs rest for 15min after removing from oven. Was a delicious meal with bbq beans, salad and corn on the cob. Meat really did fall  off bone. This is a definite repeat meal.

These were absolutely amazing. I used the rub that Cathy M added. I used smoked paprika which added a hint of smoke. Grilled them with Sweet Baby Ray's, and they were delightful. Will certainly make them this way again.

I made this 3 times. First time not so good, but only because quality of meat (used country style ribs). Next two times, excellent using baby back ribs. make the foil pockets as directed, but use the dry rub as explained from other reviewer and definitely do the step at the end where you brush on BBQ sauce and broil for about 5 mins uncovered. YUMMMMMM

I wanted to make as is so I followed the directions exactly. The meat did not fall off the bone and the taste was bland. The next day, it did taste better but still not great. I think using the aluminum foil technique, a rub, and homemade bbq would have been better.

Great recipe.  Couple of things you do need to know - gotta be careful unwrapping the ribs when they come out of the oven so the steam doesn't burn your fingers.  Also, they do indeed release a lot of juice when they cook, so it's best to put the wrapped ribs in some sort of pan with sides, so when you unwrap them, the juice doesn't run everywhere.

Love the fact that this was so easy and yet so good.  Like everyone else, my ribs fell right off the bone and were delicious.  Will definitely make again.

Wow!  What a succulent dish.I used a store bought rub and added a little paprika and brown sugar to it and rubbed it on the meat before spreading on the barbeque sauce for the 8 hr. marinating process. I then baked the ribs and then took the ribs out of the aluminum foil, added more barbeque sauce, put it in the oven and broiled for about 5 minutes. Wonderful!

NO NEED TO MARINATE! Take out ribs after 2 1/2 hours, turn on boiler. Add a little more sauce to the top, make sure they are humped up. Stick under broiler for a few minutes, WATCH THE WHOLE TIME SO THEY DON'T BURN. Let them caramelize as much as you want. Wow! This is our new Sunday dinner, would make for company. Amazing!

Wow, this is so so simple and amazing.... I did NOT refrigerate overnight, I simply didn't have time.... All I had was 2 hours... I added adobo seasoning, and pepper, plus barbecue sauce. 2 hours in the fridge, then baked for 2.5 hours at 300 degrees... Removed aluminum foil, added barbecue sauce and broiled for 5 minutes. Just amazing, thanks for the recipe....  Nom nom nom....

These were fantastic and very easy.  I did go with the dry rub that someone posted because I didn't have enough of the other kind.  We also finished them on the grill for about 5-10 min with some Stubb's BBQ.  DELICIOUS

These ribs made me look like a superstar. I did remove the membrane (HUGE difference) and I did dry rub them and I also broiled them on a cookie sheet with my favourite bbq sauce. Thanks to everyones input I looked like a pro!

I studied all day to make these! I used Cathy M.'s dry rub. Placed in cooking sprayed foil. Let sit half hour. I read that you not leave dry rub on too long it turns to ham and I believe to be true.  Cooked at 275 two hours. Turned off oven left ribs in, and started up mesquite (12-15) wood chunks on ol' Smokey Joe! Cooked 1 hour in foil on grill. Removed foil(be careful of juice everywhere!) Brushed on sauce of choice cooked until meat started to pull from bone! Aprox 4 1/2 hr cooking time. Ok maybe not easy but fun!

Love, Love, Love this recipe!  Only used the rub initially.  After taking them out of the over, I let them rest for a few hours.  Put them on the grill and based with BBQ sauce.  They were very very tasty.  A HUGE hit at my BBQ.

Thank goodness I finally know how to make 'fall of the bone BBQ ribs'.  10min on the BBQ at the end gave it that extra flavour.  Kids loved it and it was so easy.

Excellent fall-off-bones! I used beef ribs and a dry rub up to the time I put them the grill. Perfect!

Wonderful ribs!  It was so easy to prepare and the meat just fell off the bone.  I especially liked that I could choose my own type of BQ sauce.  This recipe is definately a keeper.

I used this as a start for the ribs, but I baked them for twice as long at about 230F. At that time I unwrapped them and  then theadded BBQ sauce, tossed them on a hot grill for about 5 minutes per side. They were as good as any restaurant ribs you will find-tender to falling off the bone, as well as having that carmelized grilled taste.  I used whole rack sections, and they looked great as well,

Worked like a charm for someone starting at ground zero with ribs!  I gave the recipe 5 stars but as is is probably a 4.5.  One tip in the reviews was to remove the membrane  and I wouldn't have figured that out on my own.  The other was to broil it (or grill it but I chose to broil it) with extra sauce to get that glazed bbque yumminess - I would have figured that one on my own.

I have never made ribs before so I was worried it would not turn out..but it did! I did, as others suggested, the dry rub and used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce. I was cooking 6 lbs and my oven does not seem to cook as hot as it should. So, at 300 degrees, it took 4 1/2 hours but was worth the wait. I also did broil them with extra BBQ sauce at the end too!..

Oh my! I used the baking method here with my own dry rub I put on them the night before. I wrapped the ribs in nonstick foil and baked per the recipe time and temp. They rested for a little while out of the oven and then went on the grill for a few minutes. These were perfectly done! Better than the ones we have smoked.

What a great way to make ribs!  Made them yesterday for a birthday party.  Only had them wrapped for two hours and then baked them.  Everyone love them.  The meat just fell off the bone.  Next time I am going to try the rub and see what the difference is.  Also next time will put them on the BBQ for a short time as well.  Will definitely recommend and keep this recipe.

My husband and I have tried several times recently to make "fall off the bone" tender ribs & have failed up until now!  These were excellent!  I did not have time to marinate them, but read the reviews & used Cathy M.'s rub, then slathered with Sweet Baby Rays.  I then put them in the oven at 300 for 2.25 hours.  I let them sit out for about 45 min - 1 hour, then put them on the grill, turning & basting with sauce every 10 min or so for 30- 45 minutes. YUM!  They were falling off the bone tender & crunchy on the outside from grilling, best ribs we have had in a looooonnnng time!

Have made this recipe a couple dozen times, love it! Easy and quick. No need to spend multiple hours over a grill or smoker, when these taste as good as any ribs I've had. End result depends more on the sauce, IMO. These will melt in your mouth. Sometimes I toss them on a grill for 15 minutes for a little more chew, but it definitely isn't necessary.

Oh my,  these are good!  Be sure to following the instructions and have them in the refrigerator overnight and until you are ready to bake them.  They really do fall off the bone with tenderness. Big hit with my husband who loves ribs!

These ribs are fantastic.  Before wrapping in foil, we sprinkled both sides of ribs liberally with the Memphis Rub found on this site.  At the end, broil until sauce carmelizes/thickens a bit.  Delish!

I'm rating this on how incrediblly easy it is.  I marinated as instructed, then put the whole thing in a deep baking dish and sealed tightly with foil.  I love that I could freeze this with the bbq sauce and be ready to go.  My husband and both kids ate this...a rare thing in my home.

Super easy, super tender. These ribs are so moist that the meat falls off the bone. You can eat them with a fork. Like many of the other reviewers, I would recommend a dry rub and finish on the grill. OUTSTANDING!!!

When the meat was done cooking, it was kind of gray looking. We had to shorten the cooking time because we needed the oven for something else and because of this, the meat didn't fall off the bone. It was okay in my opinion. I might try it again to see if we did anything wrong.

I followed the directions as written and thought the ribs were incredible! This is honestly the first time I made ribs and the meat literally fell off the bone. I did not remove the membrane beforehand (only because I didn't know how). I used Sweet Baby Rays original bbq sauce and loved the flavor of the ribs. If you prefer a smoky flavor, you may want to use the rub as others suggested; personally, I don't think it's necessary. I cooked the ribs meat side up and did not have left over juice as other reviewers stated. Therefore, I did not feel it was necessary to broil the ribs since the bbq sauce was still on the ribs. They looked and tasted fantastic!

This definitely were fall off the bone.  Definitely the only recipe i will use from now on.  I did put a dry rub on the ribs before the sauce for more flavor and of course used Sweet Baby Rays sauce it's the best.

Yummy! Just made these for our Superbowl dinner & they came out awesome. Cooked for 10 minutes on the grill after they came out of the oven and they were perfect.  Husband liked them better than our favorite restaurant. Thanks for the great recipe.

A hit for all!  I will make this again and try different types of ribs with the same technique.  May try a dry rub too.

So easy to prepare, and I thought very good. My husband prefers Barbecued Spare Ribs (also on allrecipes)over these, but these could not be more simple and I loved them and will make again. Used Sweet Baby Ray's Honey BBQ. Yum!

Just made these and they were great!  The only thing I would add is slap them on the grill for 5 mins a side real low heat to get that grill taste and look!

Awesome recipe- it was just what I was lookin for. My boyfriend's favortie food is Baby Back Ribs, I wanted to make him some when he came back from a week long camping trip- but I had never made ribs before! So I needed to know the oven tip and time. I used a home made BBQ suace and cut up some green pepper an onion and threw them on top of the ribs when they had about an hour to go, then cooked them just as it said- they fell off the bone and were amazing- I thought I didnt like ribs 'till I made this!

Time and temp is exactly how I do my ribs. But I marinate the ribs for two hours minimum using a generous portion of apple cider vinegar and dry rub then wrapping them tightly in foil.

ok i soooooo love this method.. i hardly ever buy the rack of ribs so i have adapted this great method for "riblets" or "boneless country ribs". ok i use my sauce and marinade as stated, i usually let in fridge for one day, then freeze for future use, so i thaw it and the bake in corelle ware type dish with a tight fitting lid, and bake at 300 for like 2 hours maybe, if i have more time i will bake at lower temp for longer, but 300 works just as well. when meat is soft, but still barely holding together, i carefully drain all sauce it was cooked in (pretty watery now) and put on foil lined cookie sheet (cause i hate to do dishes)and slop it up with fresh sauce with sprinkled brown sugar/sugar mix on every piece, that makes it brown very very nice. broil it till nice and "charred" or u can finish on the grill in the summer months. i really hope u try it, it is very very simple to make, but tastes like u slaved over it, really really really good. i can't stress that enough. sorry about typos or miss spellings typing as a the kids crawl on me, and ask 500 questions! u know how it is!

ok so all I can say is YUMMY!!!!!!! These were delicious. The only thing that I changed was I didnt have time to marinate over night, I think I let them marinate for about 2 hours and instead of cutting them I kept them as one rack. I also added a little chicken stock to my foil packet to keep them moist and then put them under the broiler with extra bbq sauce. They definately were fall off the bone and had great flavor! These are a must try!!!!!!

This recipe made delicious ribs! I tried it as written using Sweet Baby Ray's sauce. Then I did it again and finished them on the grill with more sauce. I think they'd be good with a dry rub on while in the oven and then add sauce a little while later too. I love ribs and I can't wait to keep perfecting (and eating!) these.

Made this today and it was a HUGE hit!   I'm sure the recipe is great as written, but I did make a few adjustments-- I rubbed the ribs with Montreal Steak Seasoning prior to oven-roasting-- and for the sauce, as other reviewers have noted, I substituted bottled BBQ sauce for the ketchup, and I increased the brown sugar to 2/3 cup.   My husband asked me to make this our new standard for BBQ ribs.  He's picky, so that's a big endorsement!!!

These ribs are fabulous!  I removed the membrane, per reviews.  These were soooo good.  I cooked 2 full slabs and we ate the ribs before we ate anything else.  This is my go to recipe.

I have never made ribs before, my husband bought a boatload from Sam's Club, I was at a loss. I googled pork ribs recipes and saw this one. I must say, these are the easiest and best ribs ever. Try it. I am making them for my 4th of July party where usually over 100 people attend. Thanks. Juliet

Thank you for this wonderful cooking method.  Ribs are something I have never made well.  But these were so good, we no longer have to go out to eat them.  I did as other reviewers suggested and removed the back membrane.  Then sprinkled a mixture of 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1 tsp of paprika, 1 tsp of kosher salt, 1/2 tsp of black pepper, 1 tsp of garlic powder, 1 tsp of onion powder & 1/2 tsp of red cayenne pepper over top and bottom of ribs.  Spread BBQ sauce on Reynold's new non stick foil, placed ribs on the foil then spread more sauce overtop.  Closed foil tightly & marinated overnight.  Baked at 300 for 2 1/2 hours, then removed from foil and put on a foil lined broiler pan for about 5-7 minutes to bake sauce on.  These were so tender and tasty, and no messy pan to soak.

I used dry rub to marinate overnight and added BBQ sauce and salt just before baking and broiled it in the last 3-5 minutes to give it a nice color.  Very tender and delicious.  Better and cheaper than going to a restaurant!

My guests went on and on about these ribs.  I cooked them for 4 1/2 hours at 225 degrees and allowed them to caramelize, by opening the foil, the last 15-30 minutes to make the BBQ sauce "stick."  Even a vegetarian ate 2!

This recipe is awesome but what I did is half way through cooking I took the ribs out and put them in new foil and brushed them with more BBQ sauce.  I found this gets rid of the fat they are swimming in.  I also unwrapped them and cooked them open for about 1/2 hr at the end.  Thanks for a great recipe

Always been afraid to try making ribs at home for fear of wasting a pricey meat but after trying this recipe I may never eat ribs at a restaurant again! For about $27 my family of 4 had a restaurant quality meal at home, with leftovers! The package of meat from Sam's had 3 full racks which we cut in half. I doubled the dry rub recipe from Cathy M.'s review and didn't even marinate for the 8 hrs, only an hr! Tonight everyone on the street had to smell OUR grill and salivate!

excellent.  I took other readers' suggestions and baked for four hours at 400 degrees.  I did not broil them for the last 10 min and they still turned out crispy on the outside.

My husband will never leave me now that I have this recipe!  So, so good.  I used a rub recommended by one of the users and Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce.  I'm glad this recipe lets you choose your fave sauce - BBQ sauce is very subjective.  This was so easy and really delicious.

I had my own rib cookoff at my house and these were rated #1 out of 3.  I cooked them at 250 for 4 hours.  They were the juciest of the 3 with the best flavor, but they didn't fall off the bone, maybe i will try their cooking recommendations next time.

WOW!!! These were falling off the bone tender.  My boyfriend loves ribs and he just loved these.  Per other reviewers I seasoned the ribs with season salt, pepper and some minced garlic.  At the end I opened the packets and added some more BBQ Sauce (Sweet Baby Rays) and broiled for 5 min.  This is a MUST TRY!!!

Not so much a great recipe, but rather a fantastic cooking method. I've tried just about every way to cook ribs so the meat just falls off the bone and melts in your mouth. This is by far the easiest one I've cross across yet and clean up is a breeze.  Made exactly as written, however next time I'll add some chopped onion and minced garlic. A rub followed with the BBQ sauce would also be nice.  Once cooked, I removed from the foil, basted with additional sauce and placed under the broiler till the sauce a hot and bubbly. Thanks KHEFFN.

This is the first recipe I ever got off of Allrecipes over 5 years ago. I have made it hundreds of times since then and it is always a HUGE hit! My boyfriend won't order ribs at restaurants any more or eat ribs prepared any other way now. My dad requests them every father's day and on his birthday or any other time he's coming over for dinner. I recently made them for my mom's birthday for 22 people. Every one always asks for the recipe, but no one ever believes me at how easy they are to make. The only thing that I do differently is I rub the ribs with a brown sugar, garlic powder, onion powder, pepper, and paprika mix before I put on Sweet Baby Ray's bbq sauce. I've made them without letting them marinate over night as well and they still turned out great.

Baked at 225 for 4 hours - it was the best!  Will use this recipe again.

I have been making ribs with this recipe for years.  It has always turned out wonderful! I have made it without letting the ribs marinate for 8 hours and I have made it after marinating for 2 days, both ways turn out moist and delicious! I always open the top of the foil after cooking and return them to the oven under the broiler for a few minutes to make a crisper crust on the outside of the ribs.  My friends and family request these all the time.

I didn't like this at all. Very watery at the end which took all the flavors out. Very bland. Will NEVER make this again

Excellent method for cooking ribs, 300°F for 2 1/2 to 3 hours worked great for me. Like many reviewers I used Sweet Baby Ray's Hot n Spicy BBQ Sauce. Also used the "Kansas City Rib Rub" I found on about.com (but not as much black pepper as the recipe calls for), and applied that before spreading the ribs with the BBQ sauce. I recommend using heavy duty foil so the bones stand less of a chance of poking a hole in the foil packet. Plus I lined the baking sheet with foil too, just for insurance. Result: perfectly cooked ribs and no clean up (or lingering household odor). Very "more-ish"!!!

After you take them out of the foil, broil or grill them with some more of your favorite sauce until they are sticky and browned.  These ribs are amazing!!

Awesome!  I marinaded this for 36 hours in Open Pit Original and baked it at 225deg for 4 1/2 hours then put under broiler for 7 minutes and it was the best I ever had!

Delicious!  The meat fell off the bones...as good as any restaurant ribs!  I did use the "dry rub for ribs" recipe found on this site rather than the BBQ sauce and let it marinate for 8 hours.  I also took the suggestion to cook it at 250 for 4 hours.  During the last 15 minutes I unwrapped the ribs, basted with Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce and broiled it.  They were perfect!

I've now made these 4 times and they always come out perfectly. These were a huge hit at our Christmas dinner - I ended up emailing the recipe 4 times. I agree with the other reviewers that you need a cookie sheet under the packets - they will leak. I don't however, find them better if broiled after baking. I like them straight out of the foil. My kids love them with the hashbrown casserole (on Allrecipes) and green beans. Hands down the easiest rib recipe ever.

Not really a recipe, more like a cooking method, but a great one at that.  I never knew I could make tender ribs in sucha short time.  Meat truly does fall off the bone.  Be sure to add a dry rub or salt/pepper to the ribs in addition to applying BBQ sauce before baking or else ribs can be a little bland.  Excellent way to make ribs in the winter!

Thank you Ken (from all of us) for this fine recipe.
 After two hours in the oven, I remove the foil, drain the rib, place it on the grill and baste it several times with fresh BBQ sauce.

This was good. Although I hate marinating because I always am a "last minute" cooker. This was easy and effortless A++ in my book.

Ok so I made this again using a different style of ribs (the good kind). I added lots of seasonings (garlic, jonny's, montreal steak, pepper) before putting the barbaque sauce on then I chopped up onions and placed them on top. I foiled it up tightly and presto the best dang ribs ive ever eaten. Even better than the first time!! the only disappointment is that I had to share!

Finger linkin good!!! I used Bulls Eye BBQ sauce, original flavour - after baking I placed the ribs on the grill and slathered more sauce on them for about seven minutes - just enough to get grill marks.  They were similar in taste to the ribs we had at the 'Pork and Loin' in Chattanooga.  Our eyes are still rolling back in our heads! LOL mmm...

This recipe is almost too good to be true.. You can marinade the ribs in the foil and take it from the fridge directly to the oven.  A spicy dry rub in addition to the bbq sauce will work wonders.  I also drain the juices that accumulate in the foil packs 30 minutes prior to removing the ribs from the oven. Great recipe…

I've made these ribs 3 times now, and each time they turned out different, which puzzles me. But they were good each time. One time they did fall off the bone, the other 2 times they didn't and were a little "chewier." I think it's because some racks are meatier than others. You definitely need to finish these on the grill to get the outside crisped up. Use a good, spicy bbq sauce, nothing too generic or plain because with this recipe, it's all about the sauce!

Been making this for years...family devours it!  Lately have added some changes that makes it even better.  Since baby-back ribs are so expensive and not as meaty I started using St. Louis style spare ribs (a rack).  with these it is vital that they be marinated overnight.  Also used a dry rub (onion salt, garlic, pepper, paprika...really anything you like) before marinating.  Cooking time is fine, but was even better for me when I lowered temp to 250 and baked for 5 hours, broiling the uncovered ribs for 5 minutes just before serving.  I don't even like b-q ribs but I gobble these up!  Thanks!

Did not have time to marinate, read over a few of the top reviews then...Set oven 250,cut foil to line and cover pan, sprayed foil.
Next removed the back muscle (part came off easy) then squeezed a little French's yellow mustard on ribs and massaged into ribs, then sprinkled McCormack Molasses Bacon "grill mates" all over ribs. Placed in pan, sealed foil. Baked for 3hours, removed from oven, reset oven to 450, meanwhile removed all pan juices and brushed with Sweet Baby Rays.  Placed back in oven for 30 minutes. Wow! Delicious and easy!

To. Die. For. Period!  I serve these when we have a special occasion, like Valentine's Day.  I use the original Sweet Baby Ray's barbecue sauce on these.  Marinate if you can; it's great without marinating, but way better with it.  Edited to add:  I've made this recipe many times; it's my go-to special occasion recipe, and I've had results of varying awesomeness every time.  Make sure you bake with the side that curves inward facing up; otherwise the barbecue sauce slides off.

Couldn't be any easier!  I like to put them on the grill for a few minutes before serving.  Collect the cooking juices and barbecue sauce from the foil and heat to thicken and serve with the ribs.

I've never made ribs before and these were great! I'm made this recipe about 6 times now and it's a favorite. The recommendation to broil them for 5-10 minutes is spot on.

Excellent! These ribs were so tender and yummy!!  Everyone loved them.  The ribs marinated in the fridge overnight with a dry rub in 2 gallon ziplock bags...the next day, I brushed the ribs with bbq sauce and placed each rack on heavy duty aluminum foil, tightly packaging them separately.  I then placed each "package" on a rack on top of a baking sheet in the oven for 2 1/2 hours @ 350 as indicated in the recipe. After sitting in the oven (with the oven off) for about an hour (because it was still too early to eat them), we grilled them while basting with more bbq sauce. They were so tender after the 2 1/2 hours in the oven so we (my husband!) had to be careful when flipping the ribs so the meat didn't fall off from the bones. Well worth the extra time and pre-planning!!!

I used Sweet Baby Ray's and broiled for the last 15 minutes...they looked great!  I don't eat meat but my boyfriend gave them 5 starts for taste, and I say 5 starts based on the simplicity ;)  Thanks for sharing this recipe!!

Very good and juicy ribs.  I used the rub as posted by Cathy under most helpful reviews.  Wasn't quite excited by the rub, but loved the idea of doing ribs in the oven and having them come out as nicely as they did.  I put the bbq sauce on 30 minutes before being done and then broiled them the last few minutes. I also didn't have baby back but the regular rack of ribs.

I give this recipe 4 stars for its ease of preparation, but 3 stars for flavor. I marinated the ribs overnight in bbq sauce, I didnt use any rub or seasoning, and I broiled them before serving. The ribs do fall off the bone and are very tender, but they are lacking in flavor. They turn out ok, theyre definitley edible, but they lack that great restaurant-style flavor that I love. I will be using this recipe again due to its ease of preparation, but I will be adding seasoning and extending marination to try to enhance the flavor.

Extremely simple to do.  Came out very tender, made my own BBQ sauce for some and then added garlic type rub to another set of ribs.  Would reccomend.

Though I can understand how some people wouldn't consider this a recipe as it involves a bottle of your fave bbq and no other recipes, cooking instructions are still important! As brainless as cooking ribs sounds, I've never had them turn out for me before... these were FANTASTIC! I did as other suggested and for the last 15 minutes, I removed the foil, added more sauce and they turned out ooey gooey good!

The 2-1/2 lbs of pork ribs I had turned out sooo very tender using other reviewers suggestions of cooking for 2-1/2 hours at 300 degrees. Also made up my own rub of paprika, cocoa, garlic powder, salt, pepper and cayenne and applied before marinating for just 2 hrs. Also did the broiling to sear the sauce on the top. Only did it for 3 minutes as I failed to remove the foil and almost burned the house down :).

I have made these many times and this is the simplest recipe with the highest reward!! Maybe add some salt and pepper or other spice mix to the meat before you add the BBQ sauce

I've tried ribs many different ways and this is by far the best recipe out there. The things I do different is add a dry rub before the BBQ sauce, and when the ribs are done cooking I ad some more BBQ sauce and throw them on the Grill for 10 min. to get that nice crisp.

Very easy and very tasty! Make sure to put enough sauce on them to add flavor and keep them a little more moist.

I thought this recipe was delish!!!..I marinated the ribs the night before with the dry rub that Cathy M. mentioned and I cooked the ribs in foil for 2 1/2 hours on 300. After an hour of resting the meat I then put them on the grill on medium for about 5 minute on each side with my BBQ sauce, then at the last minute I turned the grill up and put ther ribs on the meatier side for a quick sear.....Delish and I would definitely do this again.

Sooo Easy! I have made this recipe several times now. I always open up the foil pouches for the last half hour to brown the ribs. Be sure to place a cookie sheet or foil on the rack below as the juices sometimes leak out of the foil. Delicious!

We loved this recipe! It was exactly what I was looking for. I've never made ribs before and this is as simple as it gets. I only used BBQ sauce (KC Masterpiece) and only marinaided it about 4 hours. I put it in the oven for the recomended time and temp, drained the juices and transfered it to the broiler for 7 mins after slathering on some more sauce. It was a nice color and a little crispy on the outside and of course it fell off the bone! My husband loved it and he is really into ribs.

I also made my own BBQ sauce and in addition to KERI's note (which I also agree) regarding her  potatoes I would suggest slicing and topping the potatoes with onion.

Amazing ribs. Fall right of the bone! Used "baby rays sauce" and used alot. Even tightly closed the sauce seems to drip from aluminum foil. Place foil ribs on a cookie sheet.

I used the dry rub as described by Cathy M., but forgot to put the salt in the rub, AND didn't have time to let sit overnight. Results were still fabulous. Also, did not wrap too tightly in foil. It turned out moist regardless. I didn't add any sauce until after the full cook time -- then I slathered it on and broiled each side for 2 minutes.

I used a little less sauce and used a rub on the ribs and cooked them at 250 for over 5 hours. When you open up the foil you could easily pick out all the bones if you so desire, they are that tender. Quick, easy and oh so good!

This was an awesome recipe, the ribs were fall off the bone tender. I followed others and put them under the broiler for a few minutes on high  after slow cooking in the oven and they crisped up very well. Tasty! My family loved them.

I made this exactly as stated and it was awesome!  I was hesitant at first to make ribs because it isn't something you can eat too well with braces.  The meat fell off the bone so I had NO problems and the whole family at it up, even my 8 year old.  Thanks.

If your not sure if this is good even after almost 1000 reviews - TRY IT!!  This is easy and so incredible. I have made them before and it was an absolute hit and now I am on vacation and searching for this recipe to make for 4th of July.  Do the rub first and then add the BBQ sauce to char and they are mouth watering!!  You wont be sorry.  There is a video for an easy way to remove the membrane!!  Super easy!  Delicious!Enjoy!

Super Simple, Super Good!  Before serving them I put the ribs back on a broiler pan and put them back in the oven on the top rack and turn the oven up.  In about 5 min they have a nice crisp, charred crust with a supper tender, juicy meat!

So easy and tastes great.  just be sure to use a barbeque sauce you love.  After ribs are fully cooked i like to brush on more sauce and put in a hot oven for about 15 minutes to carmalize the sauce.

This was the BEST rib recipe I have tried. I followed other folks reviews and did the dry rub then 30 minutes before they were done I applied sweet baby ray's bbq sauce and then brushed on a little more after they were done and they were fabulous! Talk about tender and falling off the bone. Everyone loved them. Next time I make them I will marinate them over night as stated by others and broil them afterwards but even without all that they were wonderful.

The only change I made was to use pork side ribs instead of baby back ribs because they were on special. The meat fell right off the bone and the 3 guests I had loved them. I've made ribs before using several different methods but this is the one I am going to stick with.

I've been wanting ribs for ages now so I finally decided to make them.  This was such a simple recipe and it tasted so good.  I made my own spicy and sweet barbecue sauce instead of buying some.  I also only marinated in the sauce for only about two hours.  When they were finished in the oven I added more sauce and finished them on the grill.  These ribs are amazing!!  I had fight off my husband so he would save some for everyone else.  I will definitely be making these again!!!

I put a rub on these and refrigerated in the foil overnight. Then I opened the foil and added Sweet Baby Rays Original BBQ sauce, wrapped them back up and cooked them as stated in the recipe. Cooled them off so they wouldn't fall apart and put them on the charcoal grill to char them. They were absolutely delicious...BBQ restaurant quality and so easy! My son and daughter in law couldn't stop saying how awsome they were.

I made ribs for the first time ever last night using this cooking technique though I used a dry rub rather than sauce.  The ribs were incredibly tender & perfect, thank you!

I thought these were pretty good. In our condo building we can't grill out, so we were looking for a baked ribs recipe. I think this is as good as any without making your own sauce (convenience can be a huge plus!) The meat didn't fall off the bone and required a knife to remove it, but it was still really good.

This was the hit of my Mother's Day lunch today (among the 3 other new AR recipes:)  I made exactly per the recipe, using Sweet Baby Ray's Hickory Smoke BBQ Sauce.  Too easy to be so good!

The best recipe for pork ribs!!!! The meat literally does fall off the bones. Very moist and juicy. And it tastes just like the ribs you eat at a good restaurant. LITERALLY EVERYTIME I make this for other people, it's always a big hit!

Easy.  I had a sweet and smokey, store bought spice rub that I used to marinate instead of the BBQ sauce and I finished off with BBQ sauce on the grill to create a glaze.  Excellent!

This recipe was quite flavorful and easy to make, especially for a non-griller like me! I took the advice of some of the other reviews, and broiled the ribs for about five minutes to get the glaze to really stick. I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ, and my whole family loved it. Great recipe!

OMG!!! I did these for a total of 5 people not one of them complained! We all loved them! I had 2 racks and 1 was larger than the other. I cut them into 5 servings and sauced and wrapped them per serving. I will use this recipe forever! Next time I will try putting them under the broiler with a little more sauce on top and make it appear more grillish! Thanks for this awesome recipe!

This was delicious!!! I have the worst time with meats but this really did fall off the bone and I only had about an hour to marinate which I used adobo (spanish seasoning) and the Sweet Baby Ray's bbq sauce.  My b/f could not believe how wonderful the ribs came out!! He wants to stock up now, lol.  Thank you for such an easy fool-proof recipe!!!

You really don't need to brown them first when you cook them in aluminum.  (If you cook them in a crock pot or aluminum covered pan.  Then you want to brown them first.)  Cook them for about 2 and a half hours on the back side then  20 minutes on the front side other wise you get a big burn line down the middle.    Roll the aluminum so that it is SEALED not just rolled around.  Other wise the sauce will leak out.  It's better to make them sauce heavy.  Give the ribs a little bit of room inside because the moister will expand and tear the aluminum if you wrap it too tight.    Let the ribs sit for 10 minutes after cooking because as a meat heats it releases moisture.  Reversely when a meat cools it reabsorbs moisture.  Plus they are too hot too hold in your hands and will burn your mouth in the first 10 minutes anyways.

These turned out wonderful, just as everyone has described. I agree with everyone who said to take them out of the foil at the end and put into a pan and add more BBQ and put under broiler for a few minutes. My husband says they are just like going to a fancy restaurant! Just a great easy recipe!

I made these ribs for dinner tonight. I transferred the ribs to a new foil lined baking sheet for the last part of cooking.  I brushed with more sauce and cooked an additional 20 mins at 375.  Fabulous!  I would give it more stars if that was possible!

Just made this, was fantastic, the meat just fell off! My 4 year old daughter loved them, I made hers with plain barbeque sauce and mine with Levi Roots Jerk sauce and both were delicious (even after only 3 hours marinating!)  Really convenient when you have a child to entertain!!  Will definately be doing this again!!!! :D

I didn't actually follow the recipe as written but went by several other reviews so that's why I'm not giving it a full 5 stars. The cooking method however is bang on.  I used the rub recipe suggested by Cathy M. Rubbed the ribs the day before and put in a large covered roaster (I was making a lot) in the fridge overnight. The next morning, I popped the roaster into the oven at 300F for 2.5 hrs while we went to church and when I came back they were perfectly cooked. I took the ribs out and placed on a cookie sheet, brushed with BBQ sauce and baked for a few more minutes to get sticky. Our company couldn't get enough, and I can't wait to make them again. Even better than getting ribs at a restaurant. I served with homemade french fries. I would try making with foil sometime if just for the two of us for easier clean-up but for the amount I was making, a roasting pan worked better and the ribs were very tender.

I made these with the Dry Rub for Ribs recipe from this site.  I did not even marinate overnight-just put the rub on the ribs and baked them in the oven.  Great with Sweet Baby Ray's sauce!

THE MOST AMAZING RIBS I HAVE EVER MADE!!! My husband and I bought some Jerk seasoning while vacationing in Jamaica and have been searching for a recipe to use it with. Instead of using the BBQ sauce we dry rubbed the ribs with the jerk seasoning and let sit for 8 hours in the fridge. We couldn't believe how delicious they were!! We are going to try the same recipe next time we go camping and put the foil wrapped ribs in the coals of our fire.

These ribs were absolutely wonderful! I did take other reviewer's advice and use the BBQ dry rub from this web site, and followed the recipe exactly. I, unfortunately, used another reviewer's advice and put the ribs in the broiler at the end...big mistake. I had them in there for 8 min, and they started to turn black. The original recipe oven times work just fine. They were so awesome, and I raved about them so much, my mom made them the next day, and my parents said they were the best ribs they ever had (she too used the rub). My husband wants me to make them again next week already! Thanks for the keeper!!

Wow! Excellent. I did use the dry rub recipe submitted by another person. Everyone enjoyed them, and so did I. I am not a rib fan, but these were super!

This was the perfect method.  I'd never made baby back ribs before and this is the way I will make them in the future.  I did open up the foil for the last 30 minutes or so to let some of the bbq sauce carmelize.  Yummmmm!  Thanks for this great technique KHEFFN.

This was a nice alternative to the way we usually make our ribs.  Normally we boil them for 45 minutes, then grill with some sauce.  I thought this way would be a little less work with clean-up.  I always hate washing that giant dutch oven.  I followed the recommendation to use the rub by Cathy M., which can be found in the reviews below, and it was very good.  The only issue I had was when I put them on the grill to carmelize the barbeque sauce, the bottoms got burned because of all the grease.  So if you use this method, be sure to watch the ribs closely on the grill. I didn't use the foil like I should have. Next time I make ribs again, I'll more than likely use this method again.

Made these for my son's birthday cookout.  Oh My God!!  These were incredible!!  Better than some restaurants.  I used Kraft original BBQ sauce, cooked in foil packets in a 250 degree oven for 4 hours while we set up for the party.  Hour later threw them on the grill w/a little fresh BBQ sauce to heat back up.  Fell off the bone, finger licking good!!!

Nothing wrong with using bottled BBQ sauce, just use good brand...I used Jack Daniels. I did change the method of cooking the ribs after much researching. No marinating necessary!! I preheated oven to 300, then lined a 9x13" pan with foil (for easy clean up). I coated ribs with BBQ sauce top and bottom and layed in pan. Then I covered the pan tightly with foil (My pan was deep enough that the foil wasn't touching the ribs at all). I baked my ribs for 2 hours and 15 minutes total. After one hour I flipped them. Then after the second hour I flipped them back over and left them uncovered for the last 15 minutes to brown a little. I basted the ribs about 3 times the entire time. They came out super juicy and falling off the bone!!

Unbelievable! So easy. I followed other reviewers' suggetions by putting rub on the day before and wrap in foil. Cook them in foil for 2 hours, then add the BBQ sauce for grilling or broiling the last 30 minutes. They come out perfect every time, falling right off the bones. One note: careful when turning them on the grill, they are so tender they fall apart.

These ribs are soooo easy and soooo good too!  I also drain the excess liquid after baking, reglaze with additional BBQ sauce and broil for a few minutes to carmelize.  Always a hit at my house and especially for football parties.

Oh my these were so yummy!  Like others, I created a dry rub (salt, paprika, sugar, garlic powder). I  stripped the membranes [barf] and rubbed the spices in.  Let them sit out a room temp in their foil for a couple hours before popping them in the oven.  2 hours later they were ready.  I then stuck them under the low broiler for a few minutes with more sauce to make them extra gooey.  We were all sticky and had sauce on our faces, hands, clothes and we couldn't have cared less.  That was a fun supper.  Thanks!

I've made this recipe twice, 1st time with spare ribs and the oven method combined with broiler for few minutes in the end. Today I made it with country style boneless ribs, which had a more tender result. I started by using Cathy's dry rub (see other reviews) but only had it marinade for an hour today. Then I put the ribs under broiler for about 7 min (to get rid of some excess fat) and then into a slow cooker and covered with Sweet Baby Ray's hickory&brown sugar bbq sauce. They were totally ready in 3.5 hours and sooo delicious.
I used the same spices and bbq sauce both times but I definitely prefer eating all the meat rather that having to mess with the bones. Great and simple recipe.

I take the whole slab of ribs and remove the thin membrane of the back. My family loves falling off the bone Ribs. I bake 3 slabs of ribs cut into 4 bone sections and wrap in aluminum foil rubbed with BBQ sauce, put on a large baking sheet(It will be messy) @ 190-200 degrees for about 4 hours then take unwrap them and put on grill for 7-10 min with more BBQ.

First off I used the Dry Rub for Ribs recipe and refrigerated for 24 hours.  Instead of bottled BBQ sauce, I made Al's BBQ sauce recipe and used it.  I followed the recipe as stated but wanted to finish this on the grill.  However, the meat was falling off the bone when I tried to place them on the grill.  Next time I will only cook 2 hours and then place on the grill to finish off  so as to have a nice caramelized, smoky flavor.

OH..MY..GOODNESS...these were amazing.  Very tender, delicious.  I made my own barbeque sauce (Big Al's KC's BBQ sauce recipe on allrecipes.com) and refrigerated the ribs overnight.  I put them in the oven at 300 for about 2 1/2 hours.  I will definitely make these again.  So Good!

I tell you what.  I am so glad I made my ribs this way.  I have never made baby back ribs myself.  I would always just order them at restaraunts.  I decided that it would be so much cheaper to get a rack and try them at home.  I marinated them about 18 hours and added a little liquid smoke to it and used sweet baby rays bbq sauce.  I baked this as it said to, then put them on the grill for about 15 min to get it that nice smokey flavor and a little crispiness on the outside.  Slathered them with more sweet baby rays original sauce.  These were just as good if not better ribs than the expensive restaraunts that Ive had them at.  The meat was so tender and fell off the bone.  Im no longer afraid to make ribs and I will always be using this method to cook them!

I made these for a large group and everyone raved about how tender and flavorful the meat was.  I, however, thought it was a little soggy.  Will probably try again, but will put on the grill for a few minutes to crisp.

I followed this recipe, but added a couple steps to finish the ribs off. 
Steps #2.-5. provide killer results that you would pay $$$ to get if you went to a  restaurants.

1. Bake for 2hours 15 minutes in foil with dry rub and your favorite Rib sauce. 
2. After it has baked, remove from oven and drain all fat. Keep foil open.
3. Set oven to Broil.
4. Baste GENEROUSLY with BBQ Sauce ("Sweet Baby Rays Spicy Hot"). Broil Ribs uncovered for 10 minutes.
5. Lastly, baste with a 10% Water(or fat from the broiled ribs), 50% Honey, 40% "Malibu" Rum mixture.  Broil uncovered for 10 minutes.

You get the moist ribs taste mixed with spicy and a carmelized sweet honey taste. Outstanding!

Great fall off the bone ribs.  Instead of BBQ sauce, I rubbed them with BBQ Dry Rub (from this website)and marinated overnight.  After baking them for 2 1/2 hours, we grilled them wnile mopping on Bar-B-Que Sauce (recipe from this website).  They were as good as the best that we've gotten at any rib joint. We'll be enjoying these again throughout the summer.

I was skeptical since I am a rib lover and I'm very picky, but I have to tell you that I've already thrown away all the other recipes I've ever had for ribs!  I pulled the bones out of them clean before I even started eating them.  I followed the advice of others and used the "dry rub for ribs" and cooked for 4 hours at 250 - my husband and I couldn't get enough!  YUMMY!

Finally a great way to cook ribs at home! I had tried to cook ribs at home several times without any success. They were always tough, even after pare-boiling.
They are my sons favorite so I really needed a good recipe. I tried several different sauces the same night and had them pick. Sweet Baby Ray's was the choice but all were good. My family is so happy that I can at last make ribs at home that are eatable and better yet really, really good.

THE BEST RIBS I'VE EVER MADE!!!  I added more sauce and baked them for 15 more minutes at 430F, with the foil open, meaty side up, at the end just to get that nice browned look.  Also, before I started, I removed that white membrane from the back of the ribs (you can have your butcher do that too).  Made the ribs ridiculously tender.  I have NEVER had such easy clean up after oven baked ribs before.  DEFINITELY A KEEPER!

I made these ribs this weekend and they turned out great!  Even my wife who usually hates anything pork, raved about them.  The only thing I added was I rubbed with garlic powder before marinating with Sweet Baby Ray's (my favorite BBQ sauce now) and I finished them on the charcoal grill for a few minutes on each side.  I had bought 6 lbs. of ribs for 4 people + 2 small children, and there were only 3 SINGLE ribs left!  I was hoping to have some left overs, but it wasn't to be.  It's embarrassing how much we ate.  I will definitely be keeping this recipe for next time.  Thanks Ken!

Absolutely incredible!!  The meat actually did fall right off the bone!  My boys rated it a 5 right off the bat on the first bite....they are 2 tough customers...  I marinated the ribs in Sweet Baby Rays overnight after I put a rub of salt, pepper and garlic powder on them.  I took the advice of others and added extra bbq sauce right before cooking and cooked at 300 degrees for 3 hours.....in which the last 10 minutes I broiled them so they would get crispy.  Delicious!!  My boys want me to make them again tomorrow night but I think I will wait at least a couple of days...:)

Much better and easier than cooking them on the grill.  After marinating in the fridge, I added more barbecue sauce just prior to putting them in the oven.

I have made these a few times, and they are the best ribs ever!  I rub the meat with some spices before adding the BBQ sauce, and I also add some sliced onion before wrapping them up.  Broiling at the end is a must-thanks for a great recipe!

Been making these ribs for years and have not had a bad batch yet! One friend modified the recipe for his son's graduation open house by using a large (several) steaming pan and sealing it tight rather than individually wrapping. He put in the timed oven that night and the house smelled wonderful the next morning. He added a nice touch by throwing them on the grill with a little extra BBQ sauce for a few minutes to crisp the outside. Needless to say, there were none left after a couple of hours of people filing through.

I have been making these for a few years.  Easy and delicious!  I marinade them overnight in the foil using Sweet Baby Ray's regular and honey BBQ Sause.  Towards the end of baking, I open the foil, drain the liquid and then pour more BBQ sause ontop.  I then broil the top for a few minutes.  Yummy!

This is a great method of precooking your ribs to tenderize them.  Once I complete this recipes I always add more sauce and grill them for a few minutes on each side if weather permits or broil in the oven if not.  The additional cooking takes this from a 4 star to 5 star.  The secret is the bbq sauce, if you don't have a sauce that you absolutley love as is I would make alterations to the recipe as other reviewers have done.  I love Bullseye and Cattleman's bbq sauces as is so I make no additions.

My family and friends love it when I make these ribs!

I didn't have time to marinate overnight, so I started with a dry rub (from this site) then covered the ribs in BBQ sauce and marinated for 3 hours.  Also, I used one large piece of heavy duty foil instead of 4 smaller ones.  After 2 1/2 hours I opened the foil, drained off some of the juices (not as much as I expected), basted with more sauce and cranked up the heat to 425F for about 15 minutes.  Best ribs I've ever cooked.   My search for the perfect rib recipe stops here!

I don't have a grill so I never thought I could make good ribs, but this is a great method! They were really tender and flavorful. I used spareribs, so I baked for an extra half hour and then broiled each side for 4 minutes at the end after basting with extra sauce. Next time I will make sure to use baby backs and not turn up the heat so high at the end, since that made them a little too crispy for me :) Definitely line the baking pan with foil and don't forget the cooking spray(like I did). Thanks for this wonderful cooking technique!

A big hit and easy - the only thing I changed was to broil the ribs in the broiler at the end.

Added a thin layer of mustard to the ribs then a layer of dry rub as suggested in the other reviews. It was absolutely delicious. Meat fell right off bones as told. Excellent recipe.

We LOVED this simple and succulent version of baby backs.  I sauced the ribs with a homemade sauce and baked the packets for 2 hours and 15 minutes.  After unwrapping the packets, I re-sauced them, and glazed the ribs under my convection broiler.  Wow is all I can say---they were ummmazingly tender, fat free, and moist.  Hubby claims that these are the best ribs he's had in his life.
Thanks for sharing,
Jeff

I signed up just to rate this recipe!! It was our first time making ribs, and I COULD NOT BELIEVE how awesome this turned out. We brushed the ribs with liquid smoke, then applied some store bought "rib rub", covered in Sweet Baby Rays sauce and voila! After about 2.5 hours in the oven we tossed these on the grill to brown them. So freakin' good. Thank you!!

These ribs were wonderful - I could barely get them out of the oven before they fell apart.  A note on clean-up: Line your pan with foil before baking.  I double wrapped the ribs in foil,but juice still managed to sneak out and burn on my pan.

I had no idea baby back ribs were this easy to make. The meat literally fell off the bone! You just have to make sure to get BABY BACK RIBS at the store (don't settle for spare ribs or regular ribs.) And, if you bake it at 325 degrees, you only have to leave it in for about one and a half hours. Great recipe!!!

I'm not even going to wait until after the game to review this recipe.  Fantastic!  Superb!  I used a rub of brown sugar, garlic powder, a little cayenne, salt and pepper before putting the BBQ sauce on them.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce also.  After cooking in the oven, I brushed with a little more BBQ sauce and then broiled for about 3 minutes.  Everyone here loves them!

This is the easiest recipe in the world! And absolutely delicious.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce and broiled the ribs for 4 min on each side after baking.  I have tried this recipe with baby-back ribs and with country style ribs. Both turned out marvelous - my family thought they were in heaven.  Thanks so much.

Very yummy.  Didn't have time to marinate overnight but they were still very tender, if not a little bland.  Will use this cooking method again and play around with the seasonings.  By the way, broiling the last 5-10 minutes is a must.  Don't forget to add extra sauce.

These were awesome! I've made them 3 times. The first and third time I made them with Sweet Baby Ray's bbq sauce. Just great!!! The second time I added a rub and the same sauce...weren't as good, but they were still pretty good. Seemed drier the second time. Overall, fall off the bone tender...awesome ribs. Give 'em a try!

Delicious, who would have thought it could be so simple?! I did take it out to the BBQ for a quick "grilling" which added a wonderful look to the ribs!  They fell off the bone, and the aroma was quite inticing!
Thanks!

Everybody loves these ribs, they just fall off the bone and are great, if you don't have time no need to marinate.  I haven't and they taste just fine.  My in-laws liked them better than smoked ribs.  Very easy and delicious.

Great way to make ribs! I've been making them this way since early '90. The hardest part was cleaning th pan afterwards. I always used to use a black speckled baking pan and cover. I have been using the Reynolds foil bags. No mess, just throw it away when your done!

Are you kidding me! I have had this recipe in my box for probably 6 months wanting to try it and have never gotten around to it until yesterday. I was having people over to watch the USA play and win the Women's World Cup and decided that this would be a good meal to serve and they were a massive hit! i used Sweet Baby Ray's sauce snd a dry rub i found on here and I couldnt hsve asked for a better end product. Foiled them up eith the dry rub and refrigerated overnight and then opend them up, liberally sauced them up and cooked for 5 hrs. at 225 in the oven. When they were done put on more sauce and hit the broiler for about 15 minutes and they were restaurant quality! Thank you thank you!

I have never made ribs before and usually don't eat them as they are too much work with little reward. Not the case with this recipe! I took advantage of the tips in the other reviews too. I ripped off as much of the membrane as I could, cut the ribs apart, rubbed them with the dry mix from Cathy Ms review, covered with bbq sauce, wrapped each rib in foil and refrigerated overnight. Next morning placed them as is in the oven. Once done turned off heat for about an hour. Unwrapped, added more bbq sauce and broiled for just a few minutes. They were so good we were fighting over the last one. Definitely a recipe I will use over and over.

Very simple method to get juicy fall off the bone ribs. Easy to tailor to personal tastes. I did not marinate, and they were still great. Thank you.

So good and so easy!  I have tried all "secrets" for making great ribs - coke, beer, special rubs, marinates, blanching, boiling, ets... But this is the best ever.  I use a high quality BBQ Sauce and leave it in the fridge for 2 days.  I cook them on a sheet pan covered with foil, open them up at the end, add more sauce and crank the oven to 450 or broil for 10 minutes.  Fall off the bones, full of flavor and NO Mess to clean up.  Sometimes the simplest things are the best....

Super easy and very tender! I did a dry rub and waited to put sauce on until right before I served them. I used to hate making ribs because it was too much work - not anymore!

I cooked 4 pounds of ribs and read a lot of reviews before I tried this recipe.  I removed the membrane, rubbed them down with a mixture of 1 c. brown sugar, 2 tbs. cayenne pepper and 2 tbs. garlic powder then added Baby Ray's sauce.  I actually marinated them for about 30 hours before cooking because something came up and I didn't get to make them when I intended.  I cooked them for 2 hours at 300 and took them out of the foil and cooked them for about 15 min at 350 and broiled them for about 5 min.  The first rib bone was awesome and the meat fell off the bone but every one after that was really chewy and a fight to pull any meat off of it.  I was disappointed and I don't know what I did wrong for them to be so chewy.

I'VE TRIED THIS RECIPE SEVERAL TIMES.IT'S QUICK,EASY, & TASTY. I DON'T USE AS MUCH SAUCE INITIALLY. AFTER BAKING ABOUT 2HOURS @300, I REMOVE FROM THE FOIL,LET THETHE JUICE FROM THE PACKETS FALL ON TO A FOIL LINED SHEET PAN WITH A RACK. I PLACE THE RIBS ON THE RACK AND BASTE WITH MORE SAUCE. TURN THE OVEN TO 400 AND COOK ANOTHER 1/2 HOUR. THIS NOW HAS A GREAT FINISH GLAZE, AND STILL HAS THE JUICY FALL OFF THE BONE TENDER.

Fabulous!  Be sure to do a dry rub and let 'marinate' overnight.  I put the sauce on while I finish them on the grill after they've baked.

Instead of 300 turn oven down to 225 and cook for 4 hours. This helps with the sauce boiling out of the seams of the foil and insures the meat to fall off the bones. Then let the ribs rest in the foil for a 1/2 hour on stove. Then remove ribs to a serving plate, apply your favorite BBQ sauce to both sides. Have your grill on med heat. slightly burn the ribs on both sides. Let the ribs rest for 5 mins before eating. These will be the best and most tender rids you'll have.

This is a great basic recipe.  Those who love to cook will naturally put their own spin on it because that's what we do.  For those who don't cook much or are timid about experimenting go with what you like; pick your favorite barbecue sauce, add some salt & pepper & then follow the recipe.  I like to add some granulated garlic, Morton's Nature's Seasoning Salt, & whatever else sounds good to me depending on my mood.  I usually keep the ribs in the refrigerator overnight or longer then bake them(still wrapped in the aluminum foil)in a shallow oblong metal pan.  Sometimes after the 2 1/2 hrs. I'll unwrap them, turn up the oven to 450 & let them crisp up or I'll put them on the grill for a few minutes.  Whatever one does they'll enjoy these ribs & they do come right off the bone.

So I seasoned the ribs with salt,garlic,chili powder, red pepper flakes, brown sugar then original kraft bbq sauce. I let them sit in fridge 3 hrs. My cooking time was only 2.5 hrs total i did put them under broil the last 10 min. I didnt have any cooking spray so i put them in regular foil they did not stick! This is a keeper super easy tender fall of the bone ribs. Will be making again with a different sauce.

This is the only rib recipe I use. I rub the ribs and wrap them in tin foil overnight. Then I put the sauce on the ribs and wrap them in tin foil overnight. Then I bake them. So it is a 3 day process. Well worth the trouble if you like favorful, fall off the bone ribs!

These ribs were very easy and my family loved them. I did broil them on low for about 10 minutes as recommended by other reviewers. I will definately make them again.

Fantastic ribs! I made 2 slabs of these & there was none. Everybody oohhdd & aahhdd when I pulled them out of the oven. I HIGHLY recommend using Cathy M's rub (I think it's review #3). I will be making these again, & have already been told to let the family know when I'm making them again so they can come over.

Finally! I never knew how to make ribs where they fall off the bone. Very excited about this recipe. Easy and wonderful. I did add more bbq sauce at the very end and broiled the meaty part of the ribs to get them all sticky and a bit crunchy. Also don't forget to pull of the thin layer of "skin" on the underside of the ribs so everything really falls off and you don't have that tough skin while eating.

oh wow! Delicious fall off the bone ribs! I did a dry rub first then I added the bbq sauce on the ribs. I let that marinate for a few hours before baking (as directed) then grilled it for about 20min.! So darn good! Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!

This is the best BBQ recipe I have ever tried. And it works with all kinds of ribs, not just baby backs or pork. I even put these on the barbie to give them better flavor, but I had one hell of a time getting them on there without them falling to pieces. Anybody that rates this any less than a 5.0 is wacked!

Super easy & makes the ribs so tender. I usually use a spice rub as well.
These are the only ribs I make....I only do the spice rub in foil for 8 hrs...cook them for 3hrs then remove foil and brush on bbq sauce and let them go another ten mins or so..I like to throw them under the broiler for a few but watch close! Twice I almost set them on fire :)

First time I made ribs,  These are pretty good and easy.   Unfortunately i didnt have my favorite bbq sauce on hand.   I didnt have a chance to marinate at all and they still came out good.   I am sure marinating will make these ribs even better.

Amazingly delicious!Ive used this recipe many times, and its my new favorite.The meat really does fall off the bone. I spruce up the store bought bbq sauce. I buy Chris n Pitts bbq sauce and mix it with tabasco sauce, garlic powder, black pepper, orange juice(small amount), and parsley. It's so good.

I just made this for Memorial Day 2010.  Like the other reviews, they were absolutely the BEST.  I did take the membrane off with a butter knife and pulled it off with a paper towel. (Thanks to other reviews who recommended this).  It took a few times, but came off nicely.  I cooked them like the recipe called for, marinating overnight then cooking them for 300 degrees for 2.5 hours, only I used KC Masterpiece Original sauce.  Then, I put them on my grill for about 15 minutes.  Flipping one time for each side.  The ribs were literally coming off the bone so I had to be careful putting them on the grill. They were so good and will make them again soon.  There was literally nothing left but bones.  Great recipe and great recommendations.  Thanks to all who comment on here.

Holy cow are these ribs GOOOOOOOD!  Absolutely tear off the membrane, and allow to marinate over night.  I used the rub, Chipotle BBQ sauce, and broiled them for 10 minutes after 2 1/2 hours in the oven.  My son ate so many, he hurt!  My daughter loved hers, and I didn't want to stop eating them!  SUCCESS!

Okay, I agree with some people that this isn't really a recipe, BUT I have never cooked ribs before and this was not intimidating like other recipes I've seen and they turned out wonderful.  The only thing I did differently was grilled them at the end to caramelize the sauce.  I'll probably start to play with this like do a dry rub next time, but it was a great jumping off point.  Thank you!

Though someone mentioned this isn't really a "recipe", the point it makes for cooks, particularly new ones, is that DELICIOUS ribs at home can be really easy! I used two pounds of ribs and a dry rub found on this site. Baked in foil for 2.5 hours, let rest for 45 minutes or so, then lightly brushed with Sweet Baby Ray's and grilled over charcoal for 7 or 8 minutes a side. Absolutely mouth-watering, melt-in-your-mouth awesome ribs!

One thing you might try that I have found to work well is to use a dry rub on the ribs instead of the bbq sauce, there are plenty of recipies out there.  Cover in foil and marinate and cook as the recipie says.   Then I like to finish them on the grill, 10 mins a side med heat basting w/ the bbq sauce.

I would give this six stars if possible.  I have prepared this recipe multiple times and it is always great.  I cut my ribs in poritons and place in a container and cover with BBQ sauce (Sticky Fingers Original is my fave) overnight.  I then place in foil and bake as directed, cutting the time 30 minutes short.  I remove the ribs from the foil and place on the grill to char.  Delicous and so easy!

Great! Just what we wanted. I didn't marinate the ribs at all and they were tender and very tasty. I did remove the membrane from the back of the ribs first. I also seasoned the ribs with season salt, garlic powder, and fresh ground pepper before adding sauce. Making these again soon!

I neglected to plan for marinating overnight, but I marinated for about an hour with the dry rub suggestions given, then baked in the foil with just a little barbeque sauce (300 degrees, 2.25hrs) and then finished by adding sauce and broiling for 10 minutes.  A HUGE hit.    Also - thanks for the membrane removal tip!

I removed the membrane and split the racks in half and wrapped them up. I had a hard time getting them out of the packets without them falling apart! I was ready to broil them for 10min but when I pulled them out they were covered with sauce and looked great. I used sweet baby rays and drenched them in it. I put the rib meat side down so they looked like a upside down rainbow. Sooo good. I have cooked ribs many different ways and this is the best!

Sooo easy! I usually would have done the dry rub rub suggestion as per a lot of readers but I was pressed for time to mix up a rub. I followed the recipe exactly except I opened the foil towards the end of cooking to brown up the ribs. FANTASTIC! EASY! Thank you!

Good easy recipe. One thing I did different was when wrapping the ribs line the inside of the foil with sliced onion and bell pepper. Afterward place the ribs on the grill basting with the sauce for bout 20-30 min. Comes out very delicious!

Wow, these were good.  I liked adding the rub sugested by others as it added a nice zing, plus you must broil for 10 min as well.  Fall off the bone goodness.

Awesome tasting ribs!  I combined some basic ideas of others.  I did an overnite dry rub marinade...wrapped the ribs with sauce in foil but left space..300F for 2.5 hours then either grill or broil with more sauce.  Fantastic!!

Great, easy cooking method.  I followed everyones' advise and the meat was fall-off-the-bone tender but it still stayed on the bone!  Used Julie's rub posted 9/1/09, wrapped the ribs securely in tented foil, marinated for 6 hours & baked for 2 hours.  Then I finished the ribs off with Sweet Baby Ray's sauce when I ran them under the broiled for the last 15 minutes of cooking.  Tah Dah, excellent ribs and no clean up!

I used Korean barbecue sauce. It got good.  When baked, a foil was broken by born, sauce spilled out, sauce burned.

To be completely honest, this is as good, if not better than Alton Brown's rib recipe. It's certainly much, much easier too.

I can't say I made thes as directed because I'm just too picky about my sauces to use anything from a  bottle. But I have definitely adopted the method. Before baking I use my own dry rub. After baking I toast them under the broiler for a few minutes, slather on my own sauce, and toast them a second time. Everyone I've made them for can't believe how simple it is considering the results. Thanks for the inspiration!

Meat does fall right off the bone. I'll probably try Beef ribs next time, the Pork are a little too fatty for my taste. But this was super easy to make!

They were awesome despite that I didn't have time to marinate my ribs.  I shared the recipe with others who asked me to grab ribs for them at the store next time I purchase some.

This is definitely the answer to how ribs should be cooked.  I have tried a multitude of rib recipes and will always use this from now on.  I did remove the membrane and used the rub mix suggested by Kathy M and coated the whole rack of ribs with the rub and my favorite BB sauce, wrapped tightly in foil and put in the fridge overnight.  I placed them on a baking sheet and when the bake time was complete, opened the foil up and spread more BB sauce on the ribs and broiled them for about 5 min. Thank you so much for the secret to making perfect ribs KHEFFN.

These ribs were incredibly easy and taste great!  I didn't remove the back membrane, but it didn't bother anyone :) I only cooked for 2 hours and then put them under the broiler for 5 minutes each side for color, and they turned out amazing!  My husband only eats Chili's Baby Back Ribs, but he said he likes these better!  Thanks for a money saving recipe.

Wow!  I wanted to post a picture, but they disappeared...nothing left but bones.  I marinated the ribs with my favorite bbq sauce for a short time, baked as directed, and finished on the grill.  I did go to YouTube to watch a video demonstrating how to remove the membrane on the back side of the ribs....very easy to do, once you know how.  Maybe there is a demo on this site, I didn't find one.

I am not a cook (we eat out 6 nights a week) but my husband didn't believe that last night when I served these to my family.  I searched for rib recipes yesterday morning after my 6 year old daughter mentioned she wanted some.  I didn't have the 8 hours or a lot of time since I needed to prep these during my lunch break.  I purchased Durkee's Rib Rub, a bottle of local gourmet BBQ sauce and the nonstick foil and set to work at noon.  The ribs marinated in the fridge for about 4 hours then I cooked them in the oven for 2.25 hours and finished with the broiling as recommended in some of the reviews.  WONDERFUL- the meat did fall away from the bone and these were as good as ones we have enjoyed at some of our favorite restaurants.  Clean up was almost none existant (I lined the broiling tray with the foil also).  I couldn't figure out how to remove the back membrane some of the reviews mentioned but no one in my family noticed the difference.

This is the absolute BEST and easiest way to make ribs. I first used a rub of brown sugar, salt, pepper, garlic powder and paprika then I used Sweet Baby Rays Honey Chipotle Barbeque sauce. Awesome. So tender I could not get them out of the pan without losing the bones.If you love ribs you must try this method.

This was SO easy, and it turned out SO well that even my son who doesn't like to eat meat was asking for more!  I followed the recipe exactly, using a gluten-free BBQ sauce (thanks, Wegman's!). I did not have a dry rub to add (as other reviewers suggested), so I hoped for the best and got it!  This recipe was a hit, so it's a keeper! Thanks for this amazing and easy recipe!

This is the best! The ribs came out so good, falling off the bone. This one is a keeper.

These ribs were fantastic! I applied a dry rub and sweet baby rays sauce the night before and refridgerated them and baked them the next day. We then picked up another slab of ribs and marinated only a few hours before. You could totally tell the difference (even though both ribs were tender and fell right off the bone) the ribs that we marinated the night before were ALOT more flavorful. I agree with other reviewers and should have taken this advice- you may want to place a throw away tin pan under the ribs while in the oven. I used heavey duty foil and they still dripped and I was stuck cleaning my oven the next day! But well worth it, they were a hit!

This is really a great recipe! First time I've made baby back ribs and my son, whose opinion I value in the culinary area, said they were the best he'd every eaten! Followed Cathy M.'s recipe for the dry rub and marinated them in her rub and baked them in the rub only for 2 hrs. then finished on grill with juices from meat and one slab was slathered with the blackberry barbeque sauce from this site and the other with John Boy and Billy's Original BBQ sauce - thanks for the recipe - seeing as how I bought 25 lbs. of ribs on sale I'll definitely be making these again!   :)

I have always had trouble with baby back ribs turning out tough.  I made them this way, with my sister's homemade BBQ sauce, and was stunned at how they just fell off the bone!  Thank you so much!

Best fall off the bone ribs i ever had.  Broil them for 10 minutes after cooking for a crispy crust or even better, put them on the grill for 10 minutes.  They are simply the best without having too many ingredients and too much prep time.

This is the second best recipe I've found.  Today was my first time cooking it.  I was surprised how easy and delicious it turned out.  I was kind of scared it might be tough and bland but it was the opposite.  It was flavorful and it really did fall off the bone.  I bought my pork ribs from costco (2 pack of ribs) it was 7 lbs.  I used about 2 bottles of Kraft Original bbq sauce.  I first sprinkled salt, pepper and paprika on the ribs before putting the bbq sauce all over.  I covered it in foil and left it overnight in the fridge.  I baked it for 3 1/2 hrs then I opened and added more bbq sauce and cooked it uncovered for 15 mins.  I wanted to take a picture and post it on but they beat me to the ribs and it was gone. My father in law wants me to make it again for my sister in law's baby shower next week. Thanks!!!

These where fall off the bone good. Very simple recipe with great results. I did take anothers reveiwers idea to broil them for a little color, it works., but I just couldn't flip them to do the other side, because they were going to fall apart.LOL. Great winter ribs!!

These ribs definitely need a rub before the BBQ sauce is added.  They really weren't all that tender, and I cooked them as the recipe stated...except for putting them on the grill for that last few minutes.  The meat was fairly bland, but we were able to drown them in BBQ sauce.  Will try again but with a rub.

I have made this recipe several times.  My husband and son now say they'll never order ribs again in a restaurant since eating these.  I follow the recipe andhowever at the end of cooking I do open the foil and add additional sauce and then broil them so the sauce gets nice and sticky....but even if you don't do this, the ribs still are awesome!  Making ribs used to intimidate me somewhat but now using this method it's super simple and the ribs turn out great every time.

These turned out great. I have never made ribs before. Didn't know how I was suppose to remove the membrane and had a little trouble at first, but then got it! This recipe didn't have a lot of detail, but after reading a lot of the reviews I found the tips needed to complete the recipe! Thanks to everyone for sharing!

Followed the advice of the other reviewers by adding a rub and baking without the bbq sauce.  After 2.5 hours, I basted with Sweet Baby Ray's bbq sauce and broiled the ribs for about 10 minutes.  DELICIOUS!  My family loved them!

Best ribs that I have ever made.  Very easy to make, too.  I took another reviewers suggestion--to marinate overnight with a dry rub, then apply a coat of bbq sauce before going into the oven.  The ribs came out so tender, juicy and flavorful.  It really made me feel like a Kansas City bbq chef.

If you just want quick, easy, delicious ribs, you can follow this recipe without marinating overnight.  I usually just cover with bottled bbq sauce, wrap in the packets, and put right in the oven for 2-1/2 to 3 hours at 300 degrees.  Then I unwrap, add more sauce, and broil, as the others have suggested, and it's super-yummy.  The dry rub and overnight marinating would probably make it even better, but they are certainly not necessary.

It was good/simple recipe for oven cooked ribs. I pulled the membrane off using a knife to make the first cut, then used a paper towel to pull it off. Seasoned & marinated over night.  Make sure to use heavy duty foil, i had no problems w/leaking. I cooked mine for an hour at 350, then another hour at 300. Then i removed from foil and broiled for 10 min w/extra bbq sauce. Make sure not to burn ribs.

Great recipe. This is the only way I will make my ribs for now on.  After I took them out of the oven I put more bbq sauce on and browned them on the grill for the crispy taste.

OMG! These were the best ribs I've EVER had!  They were fall of the bone tender.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's bbq sauce and used the Dry Rub for Ribs recipe to season.  I seasoned the ribs overnight...also removed the membrane.  This is the ONLY way I will ever do ribs again.  You will NOT be disappointed with the recipe!!

I followed suggestions from the reviews of this recipe and those on Dry Rub for Ribs by Denise and used Denises dry rub minus a little bit of the salt, used just under a tablespoon and instead of black pepper I had one of those multi colored peppercorn grinders from mcormick so used that, other then that used her same recipe, rubbed that in, wrapped them in the foil, left them overnight, then baked them at 250 for a couple hours and they tasted great already and were about to start fallingoff the bone but not quite, I brought them out a teeny bit early so they would stay together on the grill and once i grilled them for about 20 mins over some charcoal and a little bit of soaked wood chips then basted them with brown sugar and hickory sweet baby rays, i got to have the best BEST ribs i have ever eaten in my life except for the ribs at Dinosaur BBQ in New York but being a 2nd to those is a humongous compliment. I really think using the foil has alot to do with how they turned out. It makes sense that it would lock in moisture, flavor and tenderness. Great idea, thank you.

This was the first time I tried to cook ribs and it was a hit. If I can do it anyone can! I got comments from guests of being the best ribs they ever ate!!! I followed the recipe submitted by KHEFFN, removed the membrane, but also used the 'Dry Rub For Ribs' by Denise. I used the dry rub,let them set for 4 hours then brushed on Sweet Baby Ray's barbecue sauce and let set another 4 hours wrapped in foil.  After cookin in the oven at 300 deg for 2 1/2 hours, I let them cool for about an hour then removed them from the foil and finished them on a charcoal grill brushing on more Sweet baby Ray's to each side and cooking for 5 minutes per side.. Delicious-very tender and juicy.

This was such an easy way to make ribs.  It was my first time making them at home.  I did bake them for the specified time.  However, after adding the BBQ sauce, I cranked up the heat to 350 and baked for an addional 30 mintues.  The sauce was nice and thick and sticky...just they way we like it!  And the meat did fall right off the bones!

Made with Big Al's K.C. Bar-B-Que Sauce (from this website) and cooked exactly as recipe stated. The ribs turned out wonderful! There weren't any left!

Perfect as recipe states.  No adjustments needed.  Ribs were flavorful and fell of the bones.  Couldn't have been easier in terms of both cooking and cleanup.

This is WONDERFUL!!! I never made ribs until this recipe since I had no idea how to even go about cooking them. They came out delicious, tender and my husband said they were sensational! The only problem I ran into was not knowing to REMOVE THE MEMBRANE. That is a MUST-DO! If the recipe had adviced me on how to prepare the meat, I would have rated this a 5 star. 
 ***side note*** I also used Sweet Baby Ray's original rib sauce, it was great, but I prefer more of a kick to my sauce.

***UPDATE*** I made these again last night. this time I remembered to remove the membrane. :) I also made Grandpa Dave's Texas Chainsaw BBQ Sauce that I found on this site. The sauce was better than any I've ever tried. It had just enough of a kick to it, but was still mellow enough for my husband's weak tummy. This bbq sauce and ribs recipe will now be in regular rotation in my household!

Very good!  Took some other's advice... Baked at 300 for 2 1/2 hours, then broiled for 5-7 minutes.  They were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  I did use dry rub and just a LITTLE BBQ sauce.. still dripped everywhere... thanksfully I put a cookie sheet on the rack below the ribs... PLACE SOMETHING UNDER THEM.. THEY WILL DRIP!!

First time baking ribs!! Since I cook everything at the last minute I did not marinate them overnight, but I smothered them in Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce and followed the recipe.  I cooked them on the grill with extra sauce during the last five minutes.  The meat was so tender it really fell off the bone.  I couldn't believe that it was so easy!  This will be the only way I cook ribs.

I made these ribs for Father's Day to RAVE reviews: my husband and brother-in-law said they were better than any restaurant's! I did do a dry rub first, then slathered them with Sweet Baby Ray's Honey BBQ sauce, and left them in the fridge overnight. Also, once they were done baking, I broiled them for a couple of minutes to caramalize the sauce and make them super sticky. I will definitely be making these again!

I made these over the weekend and every single person there asked me for a copy of the recipe.  They were great!!!
I followed Cathy M.'s review from Jul. 5, 2007, using her dry rub recipe.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce.  BJ's wholesale club has the best price and the ribs from BJ's are great also.

These are so good.  I cooked them at 250 degrees for 4 hours and the meat fell off the bones.  I added a rub to meat before I added the BBQ sauce.  My 4 sons and hubby loved them.  Thanks so much.

This is the rib recipe I have been searching for.  It's unbelieveably easy and tastes fabulous.  The only thing I did not mentioned in the recipe was to remove the membrane so the ribs would marinate better. The ribs fell off the bone.  Yum Yum.

These are the best ribs. I actually bake them at 325 for the 2-1/2 hours and they are perfect. I usually remove them from the foil and either broil or grill them to browm them up. Hard to find better ribs in a restaurant.

I changed the recipe a little, 275* for 3hrs.15 min then broiled the ribs for final 15 min on Hi. I used the "dry rub for ribs" found in all recipes. I also changed the Salt to Season salt and REDUCED it by half (there's salt on the table and salt drys out food when cooking) and marinated the ribs in it overnight, it was excellent. I have never seen my sons lick fingers like that before or since.

This method works very, very well, the ribs come out falling apart- in fact sometimes they're almost TOO tender, if that's possible (it isn't)!  Great recipe.  We always finish them on the grill for that charred crunchy goodness.

Absolutely the best ribs I've ever made.  Easy, Easy, Easy! We ended up marinading our ribs for 3 days because we couldn't get to them any sooner.  Still tasted fantastic.  I was worried about how they would look after reading all the reviews.  They looked just fine to me and oh so very good.  Thanks for this recipe!

This is the first and only rib recipe I have ever used.  The BBQ sauce that you use is very important...  It has to be great.  I always use Sonny's Sweet BBQ sauce.  There are never any leftovers!!!  You will never need another recipe for baby back ribs!

This recipe results in very tender ribs, like everyone says.  I am glad I broiled them with extra BBQ sauce before serving,as some people suggested.  Without the broiling, the sauce didn't really stick.  Will make again...very good!!

DELICIOUS!!!  I didn't think it was as easy to clean up as other people did, though.  Several of my foil packets leaked and left a mess in the oven. I had put a sheet of foil down as protection, but I missed a few spots!  Definitely the best ribs I'VE ever made!!!  I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce, by the way!  Thanks for a keeper!

I'm giving this recipe a 5 star because of several things. One, it was easy. The hardest part was removing the membrane, slathering the meat with BBQ sauce and wrapping it in foil. Two, it was EASY! Other than tossing it in the oven when I came in from work yesterday and waiting for it to cook, I didn't really have to do anything! When it comes to cooking I'm a minimalist. When I come across recipes with a long list of ingredients or instructions, my eyes glaze over. I had never done ribs this way, always making them in the crockpot before, and being unhappy with the results. I did unwrap them at the end, put a little more sauce on, and put them under the broiler til the sauce got all hot and bubbly. My husband and teenage son worship me right now! :-) Thanks for a great recipe!

I served ribs cooked this way in my restaurant and the public LOVED them.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's Honey Bar-B- Que sauce.  THEY WERE WONDERFUL!  It's worth the effort to individually wrap and marinade each searving....soooo good.

Absolutely the best ribs I have ever had!!  I made these for the Eagles Cowboys Tailgate - 3 Racks, about 6 pounds - and they were GONE!!  I made them the night before - stuck them in the fridge and slathered more sauce on before I reheated on the grill!  They were falling off the bone when I pulled them out to grill!  I will never use another recipe again! I did add a dry rub of garlic powder, cracked black pepper, and Janes Krazy Mixed Up Salt.  I also used Jack Daniels Spicy Barbeque Sauce-absolutely DIVINE!!KUDOS!!

Thank you, Ken.  I was looking for a recipe to make tender baby back ribs, this one fit the bill.  The ribs fell off the bone.  I followed some of the other reviewers' advise and rubbed the meat with McCormick's Grill Mate's spicy montreal steak Seasoning and I used Jack Daniel's barbeque grilling sauce number 7.

These ribs were delicious!  I rubed in chilli poweder, fresh garlic and oregano before adding bbq sauce.  These were sooo easy to make and the taste was out of this world, all of this coming from a person who is not big on anything made from pork!  This is definitly an exception.

What an awesome way to cook ribs!  Yes, it's not really a recipe, but why re-invent the wheel?  I used KC Masterpiece Original and wrapped them in half rack portions.  After 5 hrs marinating, I baked them for 2 1/4 hrs, unrapped and added more BBQ sauce, then gave them 5 min on the BBQ...no more or they would have burned.  The family said the best they have EVER eaten at any restaurant anywhere!!!  Thank you, Ken, for another family favorite!

These are fantastic.  I rate only 4 because like many others, I did alter somewhat.  I did add Emerils rib rub before the bbq sauce and finished last 10 min on the grill.  I made 12 1/2 rack servings for Memorial BBQ and everyone loved them.  Beat my mans ribs and WAS the self poclaimed rib king.  Lokks like I'm the new queen with these ribs.  THANK YOU SO MUCH.

Given the simplicity of this recipe, the taste is delicious.  I, too, used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce, and it tasted great.  My husband, who is a bit of a rib snob, was not as impressed as I was with these (he said they were nowhere close to restaurant quality), but if you're looking for a no-fuss rib recipe that still tastes pretty darn good, I'd definitely recommend this one.

Good tasting and simple recipe.  I followed the directions to a T and although the meat separated easily from the bone, it wasn't fall-off tender.  Maybe I should have upped my time in the oven to 3 hours or maybe slow cooked in the crock pot.

The ribs I used had already been seasoned with a rub at the grocery store.  Maybe next time, I'll experiment with something a little more tangy and kicked up a bit.

I only indulge on ribs every now and then, but this is a keeper and worth using the base of the recipe to experiment and try over and over.

Thanks for sharing!

Excellent!!!!  It was so easy and turned out perfect.  I used K C Masterpiece BBQ sauce and it had the perfect flavor.  My family and guests went crazy. I would recommend placing the foil wrapped ribs on a cookie sheet because it did leak through and then had to clean the oven.

I marinated in a dry rub and Montgomery Inn BBQ sauce.  I basted and reapplied the BBQ sauce every hour, and this seemed to tear the foil up a bit so I was glad to be cooking them in a jelly roll pan.  I also broiled them at the end to get them a bit crusty and "sticky".  I cooked them for 2.5hrs including the broil and I'd go longer next time...these were tender but they weren't exactly falling off like some of the other reviews (I could pick these up and the rack didn't fall apart).  I also wasn't using baby back ribs though, so that may have been a factor.  All in all though these were delicious and it was my first time cooking ribs and it left the desire to do it more often!

ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!!!!!  Made these for my family and my husband raved for days about these!  Have since made them three more times and always so tender and the meat literaly falls off the bone.  Did forget to baste them once and it makes a difference, you don't get that nice crust when you don't baste them.  Soooo Yummmy!!! Thanks

This was so easy. No more boiling and then baking or barbecueing. They were so tasty. I couldn't have grilled them as they were so tender,I couldn't move them without the meat falling off. Will make again many times.

This is by far the easiest and tastiest way to cook baby back ribs.  No basting or turning and no clean up afterward.  It's a one step method that hardly takes any time to prepare.

By far, the best oven baked rib recipe I've ever made.  I didn't have time to marinate, so I used a dry rub before putting the barbeque sauce on.  I also cooked at a lower temp (250 deg F) for a bit longer.  After baking, I also put the slabs under the broiler to crisp them up.

What a simple, delicious way to prepare ribs. I used to think it could only be done on a grill, and as a young married couple still living in city apartments, grill usage is a no-no. I am so glad I found this recipe, however, because now my husband can have his absolute favorite food every single week! I did add a dry rub to the ribs and marinated them for several hours beforehand, but then followed the recipe as stated. Due to other reviewers' comments and looking at other recipes, I did add extra sauce and broil the ribs for 5 minutes or so on each side to get that "crust" and more desirable appearance. We've already made them twice now! Mmm.

These ribs were sooo good! We dont have a grill so I wanted a good recipe for baking ribs. This is it! I added sliced onions and garlic powder to the ribs when I marinated and cooked them. They were a huge hit. Thank you so much!

You know, I *just* finished clean up of this mess, and I have to be honest:
I love to learn new things!! I skipped the highlighted recipe, and opted for this one, and my guests are sooo glad I did. For many of you reading, you know I don't rate 5 for many things, but to be honest, this recipe is one of the few! Follow the directions to the letter, don;t muck about with anything, and you have a real richter-scale wrecker on your table.

Bloody brilliant!!

These are the most tender and easy to prepare ribs I've eaten.  I first applied the dry rub for ribs, then the barbeque sauce before marinating overnight.  These ribs were recently served at a small dinner party and they were so well liked, two of my friends asked for the recipe!

Fall off the bone exquisite.  I put them back in the oven to thicken an extra layer of sauce, or they can be thrown on the grill for a couple of minutes to achieve that extra grilled taste.  But they are excellent just as is.  Never a tough bite.  I love to grill, but have never been able to beat these.  This recipe has spread my BBQ-happy family quickly.

Due to a lack of time, I didn't even marinate the ribs overnight and I forgot to spray the foil with non-stick oil. Still, it came out as other reviewers said: so tender the meat just falls off the bone with a simple touch! My wife and two boys wiped out two slabs that I bought from Costco that night, a record that says it all!

oh my god :O  absolutely the best ribs I've ever had!  when I make these all I hear all dinner long from everyone is how good they are.

when I buy the ribs I look for smaller cuts, they seem to turn out better... can't pick them up or they fall apart, leaving a perfectly dry bone.

Perfection in a rib :)

After reading through the reviews we decided to doctor the recipe a bit. 
We marinated the ribs overnight in a combination of a dry rub and the BBQ sauce. We baked them according to the directions, subtracting 20 minutes for grilling/smoking over hickory chips.
The combination of the rub and sauce gave the ribs a great flavor. The slow, sealed baking process made the ribs extra tender and the grilling process added that nice smoky flavor and crisp outer "shell" that we like.

To anyone who says this did not work for them...These are the best and easiest to make ribs I've ever had!!!!!! This will be the only outdoor food served to company in this house from now on! I did follow the advice of most and threw them on the grill to brown them before serving. I also put a pan under them in the oven in case the foil leaked. (Which it didn't) EXCELLENT!!!!

This recipe was fantastic, my husband ate them up, no left overs, even my 18month old was eating eating them like crazy, when she doesn't like to eat meat, these are the best ribs I have ever tasted and so easy to make. i didnt have time to marinate them, but i used Cattlemens smoky barbecue sauce they came out yummy. hopefully next time I will have time to marinate them.

This is the quintessential rib recipe!  Who cares if you use bottled sauce.  If that offends some people, make your own.  This is still the best rib recipe out there.  Those who rated it any less than 5 stars did something wrong.  I can't imagine how---my 11 year old read the recipe to me and she understood it.

Wonderful and easy...the only thing I added after a few times was:  I added a dry rub before putting on the BBQ Sauce (we like a little spicy and light on the sauce in our house) and the last few minutes of cooking I put on the grill to get the "grill taste".  Anyway, YES...they do literally "fall off of the bone", very tender, very good taste.  I recommend to all as was written, then you can play with it as I did and find what suites you best.  Thanks for the recipe!!!

This was the first time I ever made ribs....they were perfect.  Just make sure you have an extra bottle of BBQ sauce just in case!  My boyfriend and toddler LOVED these ribs, we don't have to go out for BBQ anymore! Thanks for posting this recipe, this was really good!

Made for company and they raved.  I did use a dry rub first.  I will always use this cooking method for babyback ribs!!!  Thanks!

Although this is a great recipe, I agree that the oven temperature is too hot.  I have made a similar recipe that called for a 190 F oven for 3 and 1/2 hours.  That way no buring or carmalizing with the same great results.

So OSUFAN, being that you are in the obvious minority here as far as ratings, enlighten the rest of us as far as whatever the problem really is. You alude to consistency. Pot roast??? Wouldn't one *want* tender meat? Granted, if the meat separated from the bone during cooking, that wouldn't be a good thing, but that has not happened here. What is it that differentiates ribs cooked this way from the rib house ribs you're raving about? Seriously, I'm not trying to be smart here. I really do want to know.

Incredibly easy; cooking in foil makes for quick clean-up!  Instead of using store-bought BBQ sauce, we marinated the ribs overnight in "Honey Barbecue Sauce" (by Kimberly D, on this website).  We cooked the ribs in the oven for 2 hours at 300 degrees, opened foil packets, brushed with more Honey Barbecue Sauce, and placed them on BBQ outside to carmelize and crust up top.  You can also broil on high in the oven for same result.  Incredibly tender, meat falls iff the bone!  The best ribs ever!

These were so easy and I couldn't believe how tender and moist they were. When I think about how much I used to fuss with ribs to get them to turn out this way! Never again! Thanks, Ken, for a great RECIPE!

This was my first time making ribs and it was a surprise for my hubby! At 11 am I decide I wanted to make ribs for tonight. When I came across this recipe (which is the first one I found) I realized I only had 8 hours to go to the store and get the ribs, prepare them, and have them on the table when my hubby walked in the door! Well, I did it! And I only made a couple minor changes!

1) Because I only had 8 hrs to complete the recipe, I only marinated the ribs for 4 1/2 hrs. I did it like the original recipe says and I used bbq sauce (even though many people recommended dry rub, I only had bbq). Then I wrapped each chunk in foil and put them in the fridge for 4 1/2 hrs. 

2) When it was time to preheat the oven I took the ribs out of the fridge and unwrapped them. I put the ribs on a drip pan with a grate on it that allowed for all of the drippings to be under the grate so the ribs weren't sitting in the grease! Then I put a little bit of water in the bottom of the drip pan and covered the whole thing with foil. 

3) I baked the ribs for 2 hours 20 min. at 300 deg. After that time, I uncovered the ribs, put a little more bbq on them and broiled them for the remaining 10 min!

They were soooo delicious!! This recipe was so simple and the changes that I made were minor!! The only thing I feel is VERY IMPORTANT to change is broiling them for the last 10 min! Like other reviews have said, this is what makes the bbq sauce thicken and makes the ribs crispy!! My hubby loved them!!

First time every making ribs.  My family loves bbq ribs, so I decided to give a shot.  I make bbq chicken at the same time (also a first) just in case.  I made one rack of baby back ribs according to the directions.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's and then before serving I added more sauce on top of both the chicken and the ribs and broiled them a bit longer to get the sauce to really thicken and stick.  They DID fall off the bone!  My chicken I made the same way except I did not keep them wrapped up when backing.  NOTE:  I did drain both the ribs and the chicken of extra juices that collected in the pan.  THIS IS A KEEPER!

This was the first recipe I tried with my new slow cooker. I needed something easy to impress my mom when she came to visit, and this did the job! Easy prep, easy cook, easy all around! Even my mom's boyfriend who doesn't usually like ribs said it was good! Needless to say, I'll be making this again.

Very good. I think it would be better at a shorter time or a lower temp like 250. I also cooked this two hours and finished them on the grill. Just a good way to make tender ribs.

Here's how to make this recipe great instead of pretty good. Don't put on the sauce till later. First, take the membrane off the ribs. Second, prepare a dry rub (e.g., brown sugar, paprika, mustard powder, some cayenne, garlic salt, pepper,etc.) and rub it on the ribs. Third, Put the ribs in the foil, as per the directions, and cook them the time indicated in the recipe. When done, take them out, place in a tinfoil lined pan, cover in sauce and broil until sauce thickens. Delicious.

Cathy M has got it going on! I did the exact recipe except put the rub on 30 min before oven and only 30 min cool time.  Sweet Baby Rays sauce. So good. Fall off the bone but not until it's on the plate! I also put some Cajun Power sauce in with the Rays sauce. Fantastic!

Great recipe but I just wanted to say that you really don't need to spray the foil with oil. Instead of that just don't wrap the foil as tightly, place the ribs on the pan meat side up, and let it cook. The amount of fat that the ribs already have eliminates the need for cooking spray.

We just had these ribs for dinner. I placed the ribs in a 9x13 pan and lightly seasoned them with no salt spices and poured about 1/2 bottle of BBQ sauce over them. They sat in the refrigerator overnight -- then I followed the rest of the recipe.  We finished them off on the grill for 8-10 minutes and they were perfect. Y-U-M-M-Y!!  Definitely 5 stars!

Awesome recipe! Follow the guidelines in Cindy M's review! I used sweet baby rays sauce as a glaze when I threw them on the grill. Marinated in the dry rub.

This is wonderful! I don't often have time to cook outside so when I found this recipe I thought it was marvelous. The ribs come out tender juicy and so flavorful!  I no longer have to wait till summer to  cook outside and have ribs, I can have them any time of year!!

Easy to make but I to made some technique changes:  I used a dry rub on them and vacuum sealed them for two days in the refrigerator.  Baked them for 2.25 hours at 300 degrees. Placed them on a hot grill to give them that pop   of flavor, brushed on BBQ sauce and caramelized them.  Just remember that the ribs are already cooked your just cooking the sauce.

I tried it based on reviews and it made the best tender ribs. Choose your favourite BBQ sauce and go.

Made these a few weeks ago- my husband is a huge rib fan. He loved them and so did I especially how easy and delicious they were. Will be making them for Super Bowl Sunday! I did broil them for added crispness when they were done. Easy, effortless- my kind of meal!!

If you're just looking for tender ribs, then all you need to follow is the time and temp and how the author says to cover the ribs.  Everything else is preference.  
I used just a dry rub and after they were done baking I slathered them with BBQ sauce and grilled them for 15 minutes or so.  You just can't fake that delicious charred flavor from the grill.

I've tried this with a bunch of the suggestions used above, but I've added a new wrinkle I discovered by accident and it worked like a charm! It's pretty much exactly the same as Kathy's review from above with a couple extra additions to give it kind of a smoky/chocolatey/flavor in the end that was one of those happy kitchen accidents you have when rooting through the pantry. I followed Cathy's ingredients to the letter, but I also added a tsp of raw cocoa powder along with a Tbsp of dark, fresh ground coffee (on a fine espresso grind) to the mix. I used Level Ground Trading Company's brand of Bolivia coffee, which is my go-to morning coffee, so I thought, "Why the heck not? Let's try it on ribs too!" So I added the ground coffee, cocoa and just a tad more sugar to balance out the bitterness of the previous 2 ingredients and it gave it a real smoky, sweet aftertaste even before adding BBQ sauce. It was almost reminiscent of these ribs I had in Cuba once. Not quite exact, but it was a happy accident worth trying. And I would also recommend adding a dash or 2 (or 1/2 tsp or more) of fresh, ground ancho chile powder or guajilo chile powder as this combo of coffee, sugar, cocoa and chilies is big time in the the Caribbean way of doing things. Not that I'm an expert. Far from it! But it made the ribs super smoky, chocolately and with the sweet with the BBQ sauce added in the last 15 minutes out of the foil to finish them under the broiler, it was amazing! I hope you try & like it!

Cooked on 4th of July.. Followed instructions.. They were easy, no mess,I used the Jack Daniel's Hickory Brown Sugar Barbeque Sauce and slapped them in the oven.. They were delicious!!! No extra time to stand in the kitchen.. Didn't have to get all creative.. probably would have if it was for more people to cook for.. but just for two.. They were Awsome!! Didn't know how to cook baby back ribs, especially without my grill.. So this recipe and video was perfect to my accomplishment for the day.. Still have time to relax and enjoy the rest of the 4th of July.. So put this on my Facebook.. Made it to the 7th rib and I was full.. Going to store to buy more ribs and start on marinating them tonight for lunch tomorrow.. So glad to had found this recipe.. Thank you.. 5 stars from me.. Loved it!!! I would definitely  recommend also German Potato Salad.. Didn't have a grill.. Didn't see the way I make German Potato Salad.. the other looked great, I will have to pick up the recipe.. New Potatoes (12) half cup sliced celery.. quarter cup red sweet pepper.. quarter cup green onion.. 1 tbsp. real bacon pieces.. third cup bottle Italian Salad dressing.. 1 tsp dry mustard.. quarter tsp. celery seed..       36x18 inch heavy foil. Fold in half to make square double thickness of foil.. Center potato mixture in foil an seal with double fold. Leave space to steam to build.. Grill on rack of uncovered grill, over medium coals 15 min. Turn packet over halfway through grill time.. Serves 4.Awesome!

A brilliant recipe.  Never have I made such incredible ribs.  My husband and son were quite impressed.  Sure you have to baste them alot but it was so worth it.

These ribs are awesome..I have made them without a rub and with one, and pretty much they are both wonderful.  I marinated them about 4 hours because I really wanted them, and didnt have time to marinate them overnight, and still awesome. I did open them and turn the broiler on for about 10 minutes, sort of seals in the flavor. My husband took the leftovers to work and shared them, and all the guys said they were some of the best they had ever had.  My husband said they were better the next day. thank you so much for the wonderful recipe.

This came out so good.   My broiler was acting up so I cooked it unfoiled for 15 minutes on 450.

Great recipe!  However, because I was short on time, I made some changes and the ribs were still fantastic!  Basically, I coated the ribs with a dry rub and then added BBQ sauce, wrapped the ribs in foil, and then put them in the fridge.  It is worth noting that I did this at just after noon the same day of the meal and served the food at 7 pm.  As others suggested, after the 2:15 in the oven, I removed the foil, coated the ribs with additional BBQ sauce, and broiled the ribs for an additional 15 minutes to give them a darker color and to give the ribs a sticky BBQ sauce coat.  The meat was falling off the bone and delicious!

This is a no brainer plus down right great recipe.  I used my favorite marinade 1/2 of a day, and then made the ribs like suggested.  THEY DO fall off the bones, and my husband said I could fix these every week from now on!  I made pinto beans in the crockpot(standard recipe on pkg. but added dasf of liquid smoke, 1 tsp. steak seasoning, smoked chilies and 1 bay leaf) and corn on the cobb and coleslaw. AWSOME

I thought this was too easyz but on the recommendation of all the reviews I thought I would give these a try. These are excellent and so easy. After they had cooked in the oven I took them out and put more BBQ sauce on them and put them on the BBQ until they were crisped up a bit. Super easy and fall off the bones tender. Thanks for this.

The person responsible for this recipe is an awesome individual! I too used Cathy M's dry rub.  I think the rub is a must. I also grilled 5 minutes a side with some extra bbq sauce to get the outside crispness.

Heavenly perfection.  Like others, I gave these a rub first, then sauced, left overnight in the fridge, wrapped in nonstick foil, cooked on 300 degrees in  the toaster oven,on a lined tray to collect any juices, then added more sauce and broiled both sides to crisp in the oven.  This is the BEST way to cook ribs ever!!!!
Thanks!

I used the rub as some people suggested. It was a little too peppery for my taste. I did not add the sauce until after it was mostly cooked, and I threw it on the grill for a few minutes. I think if I added the sauce sooner my ribs would have been even more tender.

I followed suggestions that I use a dry rub first.  That, coupled with this technique, produced the best, most flavorful, tender ribs EVER!  The first time I made them, I served them to a "King of BBQ."  He couldn't say enough about them---absolutely amazing!

DELICIOUS!  My whole family including my 23 month old son devoured this.  It was so soft and yet so flavorful.  I ended up using Jack Daniel's Hickory Brown Sugar BBQ sauce and it was perfect.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.  Next time I will try either broiling or grilling them at the end, as others have done.

We made these last night for about the 10th time.  They are better every time, or at least it seems they are!  Didn't change anything other than adding a little Memphis style rub along with the sauce before refrigerating over night.  Threw them on the grill after baking-husband said he could not hardly turn them they were so tender and falling off the bone!  Will never have to go to a restaurant for ribs-they can't make them as delicious as these!!  WONDERFUL!!!!

My hubby and I really enjoyed this recipe. I didn't make any changes to it. I think a lot of it depends on what brand of barbecue sauce that you use. I prefer the Kraft Chicken 'n Rib sauce. The ribs were done perfectly and not greasy like other ribs I have done. Very good recipe. Thanks

This was exactly what I was looking for. I really just needed to know how long to cook the ribs & at what temp, since I already knew what sauce I was going to put on them. This may have seemed like a no brainer recipe, but it is exactly what I wanted. Thank you very much for posting it!

This recipe was awesome. I made a few changes. I found you didn't need to marinate it for the full 8 hours I did it for approximately 5 or 6 hrs and it was still good. I also added about a quarter cup of water inside in the foil to help steam the ribs and make them super tender, but they don't get that nice little crust on them so I peeled back the foil and turned the oven up to 350 for about 20 minutes or so. They were awesome (tasted just like tony romas!) and I also continuallly basted the ribs with barbeque sauce during there period of cooking. I will be making it again (with more ribs since I didn't make enough the first time!!!)

As is, the recipe produces ribs that fall off the bone a little too much.  Finishing them off on the grill really helps with this problem.  Also, doing the dry rub marinade instead of the bbq sauce definitely worked wonders.

Loved it!  My husband's favorite restaurant is the Rendezvous in Memphis!  I used the Rendzvous dry rub and then my husband added the finishing touch of grilling them slightly.  We don't eat at the Rendezvous as much as we did before we found this recipe.  Fantastic!!!

This was very easy and good, but I did take the advice of others and grill the ribs after I took them out of the oven.  I used charcoal and soaked Alder chips to give them a real smoky flavor.  I grilled them for about 30 minutes.  Ribs turned out great!

These were absolutely the best ribs I've ever cooked!!  The only thing I did different was add some season salt to the ribs before covering them with the BQ sause - they fell of the bone and were delicious!!!!

I tried this recipe twice and both times the ribs turned out awesome.  I didn't use the baby back ribs but bought a regular slab of pork ribs.  I also used the recipe "Dry Rub for Ribs" by Denise Smith as recommended by someone else.  That was great too.  Try and you won't regret it.  This is a keeper and will always prepare my bbq ribs this way.  Thank you for sharing

This was a good starter recipe for me. I did take a few suggestions to make it more my liking though. I first removed the membrane and rub the ribs down in about 2 tablespoons of vinegar than I rubbed them down with a rub consisting of brown sugar, chili powder, paprika, garlic, cumin, and some salt and pepper. i let them marinate in that for 8 hours. then I brush them with my favorite Sweet Baby Ray's barbecue sauce, wrapped each piece individually in greased aluminum foil. I bake them for 2 hours at the time specified, basting them every once in a while. Then I slathered on some more sauce and put them directly under the broiler, meaty side up, for 10 minutes. they were so tender, fell right off the bone, and delicious. Best RECIPE ever.

So tender, so delicious!  These were the best ribs I've ever made OR eaten.  Made them for company and everyone raved.  I followed the directions exactly, being careful to tightly wrap each portion in foil.  Marinated for a few hours since that was all the time I had, then I baked them for 2.5 hours then finished with about 10 minutes with more sauce on the grill.  Used Sweet Baby Ray's sauce and it was a meal fit for kings.  Beautiful.  Thank you!

My whole family loved the ribs.  I did use a dry rub before putting the BBQ sauce on the night before as suggested by other reviews.  I did put them under the broiler for about 5 minutes, think next time I will do 8 or 9 minutes. Very Good

We LOVED these!  I did a dry rub: paprika, brown sugar, white sugar, chili powder, salt.  I marinated it for 30 minutes while I preheated the oven to 300.  Sprayed the foil, then wrapped them and baked for 2 hours.  Took them out of the foil, then covered with sauce for 20 more minutes.  I then broiled them as others had suggested for 7 minutes.  Yum!  We didn't need any additional dipping sauce, like I usually do at restaurants.  We will be using this again.  Thanks!!

Turned out very good.  Would have liked better flavor (used Sweet Baby Ray's, which we love) and just felt like there was a little something lacking to make these a 5 star recipe.

I used the rub in Cathy M.'s review for 3.5 pounds of extra meaty ribs.  Tasty, tender ribs that were almost falling off the bone!  Perfection!

This recipe is similar to one I just made tonight but in that recipe you boil the ribs for 45 minutes (as others have stated), place the ribs in a glass pan (I used a 9 x 13), pour a jar of bar-b-que sauce on top of the ribs, cover with foil & refrigerate overnight.  The next day, cook the covered ribs in a 250 degree oven for 3 hours; remove the foil and place under broiler for just a few minutes. The ribs are "fall off the bone" tender & no one will believe how easy they were to make.

These were GREAT! I definitely will cover with extra foil in the future to prevent the pan from getting so sticky.

I thought that these ribs were pretty good - I wish I had more of a "fall off the bone" result as some others did. They had a kind of a tougher texture in some parts. Maybe because I didn't have any foil, so I just covered them up with another pan. Also - don't forget to trim the thin membrane on the backside!   I used a rub on these for the marinading and 2 hour baking time. After that, I brushed on Jack Daniel's bbq sauce and broiled for about 6 min on the meaty side and 4 on the other. I took them out of the oven, brushed on more sauce and served.   I would definitely try this again to master the texture.

We have made this twice using both Bull's Eye and Sweet Baby Ray's (my preference).  We slather sauce on a Costco pack of ribs, vac seal them separately and stick them in the freezer. That way all you have to do is pull them out the morning you plan to cook them and remember to put them in the oven three hours before dinner time!  We followed the recipe (we did grill them at the end of 2 1/2 hrs baking) and they were absolutely delicious.  I order ribs whenever we eat out, and these rival restaurant quality.

Turned out great and so easy to make.  Used a dry rub on them and let them marinate overnight and baked them without the sauce.  Added the sauce when I threw them on the grill for a couple of minutes.  A keeper!

This was the first time I ever made ribs.  This recipe was so simple and worth the time to cook them slowly for tenderness. I did not marinade my ribs in barbeque sauce for 8 hours, like suggested due to time.  I simply grilled the ribs first for about 20 minutes total over low heat.  Then I made the foil packs and put a bit of sauce over the ribs before wrapping them up.  Then popped into a 275* oven for 2 hours.  They were falling off the bone tender. Delicious!

Awesome recipe! I removed the membrane from the back of the ribs, then rubbed the ribs front & back with the "Dry Rub for Ribs" recipe from this site and used "Sweet Ray's Bar-b-que Sauce".  These baby back ribs were falling off-the-bone. My fiance' even asked for a to go plate. This recipe is definitely a keeper!  Thanks Kheffn!

Here's my disclaimer: I'm not a great fan of meat in general, and I'm particularly not a fan of greasy meat.  And, for me, this dish turned out to be pretty greasy.  I don't even want to think about the fat grams.  The fat was swimming up to the surface after a day in the fridge.  I scraped it off, but it was still an angioplasty waiting to happen.  The flavor was good, though.  Once in a while this might be a good dish to make.

I added in black pepper with some red wine or sherry.  Then, I marinated it with the BBQ sauce and let it stands in the fridge for more than 16 hours.   The meat turned out to be tender, even, my friends commented that it tastes like chicken.

Holy Cow! These are some wonderful ribs! I used the dry rub suggested by Cathy M. My husband LOVED them. And being from the deep South, we've had a rib or two in our day. Great recipe!

Firstly, as others have stated this is more of a method than recipe. With that said these are by far the best I have ever eaten or cooked. The meat just "fell off the bones" doesn't describe the tenderness of these ribs.The bones just pulled clean of the meat for me. I used some commercial dry rub and commercial store brand sauce to marinade these in overnight. And as others did I broiled mine for a couple of minutes just to get the sauce "sticky". I will be making these again and I won't be making them any other way ever again. Thanks for sharing. I would have taken a picture to upload, but they didn't last long enough to get a shot.

My Hubby has handed me the reigns... His famous rib recipe?  Boiling, marinating, grilling, etc.,  This recipe?  Easy peasy and better than his - hands down.  I used Sweet Baby Rays sauce.  But the ribs I used made a difference too.  I was using the ribs from costco (3 slabs to a vacuum pack) and it was great...until I bought a Farmer John's baby back slab at the market and it was tastier, more juicy and believe it or not MORE Tender (and pricier).    btw, as recommended by others, I did a quick rub before the baking and broiled the sauce at the end.  This is one of those recipes where you gotta have just one more rib.

These were so good. They were as good, if not better than what I get at a restaurant. I only marinated for about 3 hours.  I did put them under the broiler for a few minutes after baking for 3 hours.  Next time I will try a dry rub on them.

Awesome. Super easy to make and sooo tender.  I seasoned the ribs with some salt/perrper/garlic, and basted them with Stubbs BBQ Sauce.  I also threw in a few baked potatoes when I put the ribs in the oven and they cooked perfectly. The timing was perfect for the potatoes and the ribs to be finished at the same time.  Super easy to make, and very tasty.

These were awesome!  My husband cooked them.  He was going to put the bar-b-que sauce at the end, but they were perfect dry.  We bought them alredy seasoned, so he did not have to do anything, except put them in the oven.  I think I will him make them often!

I'm 52 yrs old and had never made ribs before. I followed this recipe and had some of the best-tasting, most tender ribs I've ever eaten. Hubby STILL wants more. (I rubbed a little ground mustard front and back prior to marinating.)

Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

I'm a beginner when it comes to cooking but I love to eat.  These were by far some of the best ribs I've tried.  They were cooked perfectly.  I surprised myself.  It was quick and it was easy, and I would recommend this to bachelors everywhere!

I agree with an earlier reviewer...I'm just as happy to have a recipe tell me the best WAY to cook a recipe and not just great ingredients.  Putting the ribs under a broiler uncovered for the last 10 - 15 minutes after covering with another brushing of sauce gave them the great, sticky tang of restaurant style ribs.  Use heavy duty foil or non-stick foil as a lighter foil will not make it!  I've also had to shorten the time marinating and used a rub and refrigerated for just 4 hours, and still came out great.  Thank you for this recipe!

These are the best ribs I've ever had! I used suggestions of others and made the brown sugar rub, and marinated them in non-stick foil. I also did not marinate them in sauce. My family went crazy over these ribs...Try them, you won't be sorry! Thanks for sharing!

Absolutely fabulous.  Totally easy.  I broiled at the end with a little extra step, and my husband and I both agreed that was absolutely necessary to create the eye-rollingly good, finger-licking experience that we had!

Soft. tender. 
ribs cooked perfectly.
However, I agree that this is not necessarily "recipe".
I used Corky's barbeque sauce and it was awesome!! Even though i wanted to cook my own sauce.
I definitely would use this method to cook again!! Thanks:D

Fall off the bone great! I actually gave it an extra 1/2 hour, however it wasn't needed, I was trying compensate for the extra large loin on the ribs. I would stick with the 2.5 hours of next time.

Fantastic ribs!  I didn't marinate them as suggested and they were still great.  My husband said they were as good as the ones he gets out Outback Steakhouse.  That is a good review!

I had too many ribs to fit in my slow cooker so I made this along with the Slow Cooker Barbecue Ribs recipe from this site. I used rib rub and marinated in Stubb's barbecue sauce the night before, and removed the membrane. I also cooked in 225 degree oven for 4 hours like other reviewers suggested. However, the slow cooker ribs were far superior, and despite my efforts to baste the ribs in sauce every so often, these were still not as tender and moist as I like. I have prepared ribs in the past by boiling and then baking, maybe boiling these in water before putting in the oven would produce better results? Anyway, I will stick with the slow cooker method from now on.

I didn't think a recipe that was so simple could actually be this good, but boy was I wrong.  I did follow the input of some other reviewers and removed the membrane from the ribs.  They turn out beautifully even grilling them for about 20 minutes.  This recipe is a keeper.

Five stars plus! This is excellent! It was my first attempt at ribs, and my resident rib aficionado (aka 15-year-old daughter) declared these the best she's ever had. I used the rub recommended by Cathy M., minus the salt and with a bit more cayenne. They were the best ribs this side of Memphis!

Awesome!  I've made ribs using this cooking method several times now, and they're fantastic every time.  If you can afford the splurge, get butcher quality ribs rather than the plastic wrapped ribs from the grocer's meat case.  The butcher quality ribs are much leaner, meatier, and more flavorful.  Friends love my ribs and always ask for the recipe.  I followed the advice of others and used the dry rub recipe from this site and lowered the over temp and cooked them longer.  I've experimented a bit with the dry rub as well, either adding 1 T. dried ground chipotle pepper to the mixture or entirely substituting the paprika for dried ground chipotle or ancho pepper.  Both impart a bit a smokiness, but the chipotle pepper adds a pretty spicy bite.

Oh.My.God.  These ribs were fantastic!!  I'm not the greatest cook in the world and this was my first time making ribs but my husband loves ribs so I thought I'd take a shot.  I didn't have time to marinate except for an hour but the ribs still turned out nice and tender.  I did use a rub that was suggested here by someone and then coated the ribs in tons of BBQ sauce and then wrapped in foil.  Cooked at 300 degrees for 2.5 hours and then opened the foil up and broiled for about 10 minutes.  I have 4 kids under the age of 3 and they were all begging for seconds!  My husband said these ribs were better than any restaurant he's ever had ribs at.  This will be a regular meal in our home!

Delicious, tender, easy to make and simple clean up! I started making ribs from this recipe a couple years ago and my friends and family always request them. Before adding the BBQ sauce I start with the Simple Pork Rib Dry Rub also from this site (but with 1/2 the cayenne pepper that recipe calls for). I use Sweet Baby Ray's original BBQ sauce (YUM), and at the end I open the foil, add more sauce and broil for a few minutes until the ribs are "sticky". The best ever!!!!

We made pork ribs for dinner tonight and they came out moist and tender and delicious!  We rubbed half with "BBQ Dry Rub" from this site and left it on for a few hours before adding the BBQ sauce which marinated all night.  The other half we did not use the rub, only the BBQ sauce.  Both were great but I think the ones WITH the rub were a little more tender and had a better flavor.  We wrapped them very well in thick foil and placed them on a large sheet pan and still managed to have drippings in the bottom of the oven --they give off A LOT of liquid, which we ended up draining about 30 minutes before we pulled them out of the oven.  Overall great result and super cheap to make!

Thank you so much for sharing your recipe.  I will never make ribs another way!  Gone are the days of scrubbing & scraping off burnt BBQ sauce off the pan.  I have made these several times and got the best results by using a rub prior to applying the BBQ sauce for overnight marinating.

Yippee! As skeptical as I was, these turned out pretty darn good. I, too, can now say I make ribs! Did them as directed, and then basted them with more sauce and broiled as others suggest. This is a must. I think next time I'll venture into the land of the rub.... The best part, no mess. My foil did not leak, went from the oven to the trash, lined a cookie sheet with foil when I broiled, threw that away. For such a messy meal, the cooking clean up was the easiest yet!! Thanks for sharing this!

BIG hit...used a dry rub of cajun seasonings mixed with brown sugar and let them sit in the fridge for 6 hrs, then added 1/2 cup veggie stock in the tinfoil for moisture, and baked at 250 for 2.5 hrs. Pulled them out, covered in BBQ sauce and broiled for 3-4 minutes to carmelize the sugars...

I gave it 4 stars because without following the advice of previous reviews, that's what it WOULD have been. I followed the tips suggested by one user, reducing the baking time by 15 min, re-basting with barbecue sauce, then broiling for 15 min. The flavor was absolutely excellent, but she was right. If you don't broil the ribs, they look incredibly unappetizing. Not to mention, they would lack that sticky, gooey goodness that ribs just have to have!! Follow her advice, and you've got yourself some ribs that will rival any restaurant I know of!

Made 20 lbs. for 12 teenage boys on Superbowl game day. Used the rub (suggested by Cathy M. on 07/05/2007) instead of the sauce, marinated overnight, then slathered in sauce and cooked for 3 hours at 300, let sit for one hour and then grilled for 5 minutes each side.  You know it's a good recipe if 12 teenage boys can't get enough of them.  Thanks for the recipe!

I have never made ribs before and found this recipe and decided to give it a try. I brushed about 8 ounces of bbq sauce on the ribs and wrapped them in foil overnight. After baking them at 225 for 4 hours, I opened the fiol, brushed on more sauce and broiled them for 10 minutes. Clean up was a breeze since I cooked them on a cookie sheet. They turned out absolutely fall off the bone delicious!!! This recipe is fool proof

This recipes was very good, and easy!! I did listen to others who put a dry rub on before the bar-b-que sauce. This is a must! So, I put on a dry rub, lots of sauce, and wrapped each serving in foil and placed on foil lined cookie sheets. I'm glad I lined the cookie sheets because the juice was running out!! I baked meat side down for 2 hours @ 300 deg. As others stated, I also wanted them to be tender, but still be able to eat from the bone! After the 2 hrs. I unwrapped all the packets, placed meat side up on cookie sheets,(discarding juice from packs) brushed on sauce, and broiled for approx 10 mins...This really made them yummy!! Everyone LOVED these ribs! I will make these again!! No Grill Needed!

i live in Kansas city and have tasted the best authentic KC BBQ in the world.  this recipe is good for someone that doesnt have a grill and have never tasted the best but i thought it was very bland and boring.  not to mention just adding sauce to a slab of meat is not really a recipe, its more of a cooking method

What a fabulous, SUPER EASY, meal.  I'd never made them before because I was intimidated by cooking such a dish.  I did go ahead and put them on the grill with more bbq sauce for about 10 minutes to add a little crisp.  Just be careful because it's sometimes hard to get these off the pit without the meat falling off the bone!!

I didnt give this 5 stars because as is... they aren't very good... We lowered the temp and cooked for longer as others have suggested... also we placed them under the broiler for 5 minutes at the end, but it wasnt long enough... We used famous Daves rich and sassy sauce which is our favorite and the ribs were great, but they were missing the true rib flavor that you get from the crispness... so i would definately recommend either leaving them under the broiler for a bit longer or putting on grill at the end. We tried 1/2 a slab with the Sweet Baby Ray's sauce that everyone seems to love on here, and we thought it was awful compared to daves. I personally add the devils spit sauce to mine because I like it hot!!! Oh sorry to make this so long, but we also tested it with a rub and without a rub and we preferred it without the rub!! The sauce does enough!!

Fantastic. Recommend, as others have suggested, to bake at 225F for 4 hours and then broil for 10 minutes. Awesome and easy.

I fixed these ribs today for our Father's Day dinner.  It was perfect for a Sunday meal after church.  I wrapped the ribs overnight and put them in the oven that morning.  Right before I left for church, I turned off the oven, left the ribs inside, and they were ready as soon as we got home.  I'm not a big ribs fan, but my husband, dad and father-in-law all love them.  I received rave reviews on these.  They were so tender and had a great flavor.  I especially loved how easy they were.  I will definitely make these again.  Thanks for the recipe!

Made these with a dry rub.  Marinaded overnight, then baked at 250 for 4 hours.  Grilled about 5 minutes per side.  They totally fell off the bone.  Will never use another recipe!

Delicious.  I season the ribs with Montreal Seasoning before I wrap it tight in foil.  I add the barbeque sauce 20 minutes before I'm done and wrap the foil loosely over it so the sauce sticks a little better.

These are so simple but sooooooo good! I've made them twice. The first time I followed the recipe and WOW, they were so tender. Tonight, I followed the recipe until it came time to cook them. We grilled them rather than baking them tonight and WOW again, LOL! Thanks so much for such a wonderful recipe!

These are wonderful. I made them before and now that I'm making them a second time I had to write.  This method is so easy and it comes out just like everyone says, tender and juicy.  Use the sauce of your choice, marinate or not, you can't mess this up.

We place our ribs on the grill for about 5 minutes after they were done baking.  Very easy, and the meat fell right off the bone.  Thanks for a great recipe.

okay okay... after reading all this it may just be me.. but these didn't at all just fall of the bone as others said.  They do leak something terrible.  I triple layered the foil and it still leaked, they just produce a ton of liquid.  Also, when i opened the foil they were the most unappetizing color you could imagine.  I broiled them but even that didn't give them that nice look you get off the grill.  I'll try them one last time to make sure it was just me since everyone else seemed to have great luck with these.

Boy was this GOOD!!  I was amazed at how good it actually came out!  The meat was tender and literally fell off the bone.  I used Kraft's Brown sugar sauce, which was okay, but I think next time I'm going to try the "Canadian Barn BBQ Sauce" (also found here BTW) because I found the brown sugar sauce to be too overpowering.  The only thing different that I did was after roasting it in the foil for 2 1/2 hours, I put the ribs on a roasting rack, brushed on copious amounts of sauce and baked it for another 1/2 hour or so to caramelize the sauce a little.  I tossed the sauce left in the foil because it was too fatty.  Finger lickin' good!!

Excellent recipe. I have never made ribs in the past, but I made it as the main entree for a party yesterday.  My guests all thought I spent all day cooking the ribs for them. The meat is so tender and just fell off the bones with a fork's touch.  I will definitely use it again.

Very tender, fall-off-the-bone-YUMMY! Next time I will put them on the BBQ for about 5 mins as others have suggested for a little bit of that "grilled" flavor. Family LOVED them! Thanks Ken!!

Works great for beef ribs too!  I left mine in the oven a bit longer since they are bigger/thicker than pork ribs.  Used my favorite (Sweet Baby Ray's) bbq sauce & my husband & toddler loved them!!  I also used garlic powder & seasoning salt before the bbq sauce (read some of the reviews who recommended it) THANK YOU!

This was great... I only had time to marinate the meat for 3 hours and I didn't even put half a bottle on 4 lbs of the ribs.  But the meat was falling off the bone when it was done cooking in 2 1/2 hours.  One of the foil packs started leaking, so I put them on a cookie sheet.  
I put some more BBQ on after the oven and grilled them for less than 5 minutes.  They were nicely browned and crisp.  The sugar in the BBQ sauce means they burn easily.  
This was sooooo good... We'll be making these again and again!!!!  Just how I love my ribs to be... better than a resaturant.

Perfect!  I agree it is necessary to unwrap the ribs, add a little sauce, and put them under the broiler for a few mins to make them sticky and delicious.  No one can believe these are not done on the grill.

This recipe is awesome.  I did not have time to marinate overnight and I was a little worried.  I marinated them in the foil for about 2 hours, then into the oven for about 3 1/2 hours.  As I was unwrapping them from the foil to see if they were done ( with my hubby over my shoulder) and I went to pick the ribs up and off came the meat.  My husband declared them as done and we declare this a great cooking method.  Imagine what would happen if I had marinated them overnight !!!

Giving 5 stars because of the cooking method.  The pork fell right off the bones and was so moist!  But not quite the flavor I was looking for.  I eat the ribs from Applebee's on occasion, and I love their honey BBQ sauce.  Attempted to make some with Gates BBQ sauce as the base (as I am from Kansas City!), but the sauce was too spicy for a sweet taste.  Will keep looking for my perfect sauce, but overall great base recipe.

Easy & delicious.  Rivals any ribs I've cooked on the grill or smoker.   Definitely open up foil and broil for 10 minutes to crisp them.

OH WOW!!  What can I say?  These were the easiest & best recipe I have ever come across for BBR.  I took the advice and placed the tin foil wrapped ribs on a large cookie sheet. I turned them over about 3/4 the way through cooking time and when I opened them up to broil them, they were already browned from turning them over.  I cooked 2 racks of ribs and my son and husband fought over them.  They never did that when I BBQ'd ribs.  Excellent recipe!!!

So glad I found this recipe! We always used to go out to get ribs-not any longer! I never thought I would make ribs at home; I thought they would be too expensive, too hard, too labor intensive. Not so with this recipe! I bought 2 full racks of ribs for $15. You would pay at least that for one rib meal in a restaurant. These are easy to prepare and the meat just falls off the bone they come out so tender. My husband raves about these and asks for them all the time. I LOVE the easy clean up too! Thank you Ken!

This came out great! Like many people suggested, I opened the foil and broiled the top for a bit after cooking to get a nice crispy  top. Otherwise it looks a bit sad. I also used a dry rub before putting on bbq sauce.  The biggest trick is finding the perfect sauce! I gave it 4 stars only because of the modifications.

Let's just say that I've made these ribs 3 times now in the last week!! My husband works in the meat industry and has tasted many many recipes. He tells me these are the best ribs he's ever had. And yes I agree, you do need to have a good sauce to start out with. I have 4 boys and they are all fans of this recipe.  Thank you Ken

These ribs are great!! We used baby back and spare ribs.  I used rub and let them marinate for about 12 hrs.  Used 4 different sauces and they all were wonderful.  I added more sauce and grilled at the end.  Will definitley make again.   Anyone want spicy?  Use Gates hot and spicy sauce.

these are fantastic!  i cooked at 300 for about 3 1/2 hours, and the meat was so tender.  i tried to pull the ribs out & all the meat fell off!  for extra barbeque taste we like to stick them on the grill for a few minutes when they're done.  these are much better than restaurant ribs!!

These are pretty simple, especially if you have a favorite BBQ sauce.
I usually cook them for about two hours, take them out of the wrappings, and repaste with a generous basting of BBQ sauce, then back into the oven on 425 for about 15-20 minutes to finish them off. I have also tried using the broiler for the last 10 minutes, and even the grill. But be careful because they will be falling apart. Super Bowl Favorite.......

Now I can finally make tender ribs ! I would suggest a slight change or two for flavor. Try cooking the ribs in the foil at 275 degrees for only 1 hr. and 45 min. Then transfer these babys to your charcoal grill for 1 hr.of smoking (indirect). Slather on your sause with 15 min. to go and grill them directly for 5 to 7 min. You end up with very tender ribs with the smokey flavor and slight crunch you would expect from the best rib resturants.You'll be proud of these.

Followed the recipe except for rubbing with some jerk seasoning before bbq sauce.  Very tender & tasty, but those who like a little "crust" on their ribs will want to finish them on the grill.

This is an excellent recipe. I am teaching my daughter to cook and this is one of the dish I had her to make. Everyone raved about this dish. The meat was so very tender and mouth watering. This is one recipe that does not have to be altered.

Very tasty here, but I went with some of the other reviewers and used my own dry rub [dry mustard, paprika, pepper, garlic powder, ground cayenne pepper] and let it sit in the sauce overnight...turned out great, almost falling off the bone with tons of flavor..would make again.

Simplicity itself. I used Chinese Char-Siew sauce (which is chinese barbequeue sauce) and it turned out great, even without overnight marinating.

It was good taste but the ribs by themselves were a little bit dry - I think the ribs must be cooked in the water (least 15 min.) before you put them into the marinade.

I've never attempted to cook ribs before, but I saw baby back ribs on sale at the butcher shop today and knew I'd find a good recipe at allrecipes.com.  This one did not let me down.  DELICIOUS, mouthwatering, tender ribs.  I used two bottled sauces, one spicy and one sweet and smoky.  I found the only recipe I'll need for ribs!  Served with some sweet and sour cucumber salad and Amusement Park Cornbread (found on allrecipes, too.)

Excellent Flavor! Very tender!  Just the way ribs should be.  Will be one of our family favorites! I threw mine in under the broiler after baking in oven.

I made these ribs using the barbeque sauce on this website - I added some chopped garlic and I broiled them for the last 20 minutes.  They were excellent!  Thanks for the recipe!

There's nothing I can add that hasn't already been said, but all the reviews are very accurate.  This is a tremendously easy, tremendously tasty way of cooking ribs. I have never done ribs before, and made them this past Saturday for my husband's birthday.  They turned out perfectly.  I definitely recommend this method.

Made this recipe for New Years eve dinner,we invited a dozen friends over for Lobster and ribs.  EVERYBODY loved them and wanted the recipe.(I felt kind of guilty giving it to them since they thought that I had slaved in the kitchen for days!) I would never make ribs any other way. I used Diana BBQ sauce, FANTASTIC!!

Every time we have a family get together, I'm  requested to make these!  They fall off the bone!  I've never used a rub and they still turn out great.  I've experimented with different sauces and my favorite to use for these is Sweet Baby Ray's.  Thanks for the recipe!  And by the way, don't forget to check your local warehouse store for the meat.  They sell the babyback ribs for $3 less per pound than my local grocery store!

Not my type of recipe for ribs.  For some reason I can't seem to perfect a recipe for ribs so I tried this.  It's getting too cold to hang out by the grill all day!  Smelled great, good flavor, but too much like pot roast.  I did rub the ribs with a bbq rub first.  We like ribs that are a litte crisp on the outside and moist inside.  Maybe if we finished cooking them on the grill?

This was very easy and did smell great while cooking. I marinated the ribs for 3 days but was very dissapointed with the results. The ribs came out more like pork roast as a couple of other reviewers have said and were not very flavorful. When I opened the packets, the ribs were covered in juice. Maybe I used too much BBQ sauce.

I was not overly impressed with this.  I grilled them on the barbecue for the last 10 minutes to achieve that grilled flavor.  The meat did NOT fall off the bone, yet these were good tasty ribs.  I think they would have been just as good cooked any old way and the flavor was good, but that's due to the sauce or rub you choose, not the cooking method.

With the awful hot weather we have been having, going outside to use the BBQ grill was unappealing, so I decided to try this method.  The results were great!  Easy to prepare, tender & tasty, and a snap to clean up - what more could you want!  They were actually even better than when I used the outdoor grill. Will definitely make again, and again, and again.

Some of the reviewers complain that this isn't really a "recipe", but I've always wanted to make really good ribs & with these directions, I did.  I served them to some "rib-lovin' friends" of mine and they said that "my recipe" was better than some of the ribs they've had at restaurants.  So even though there are only 2 ingredients in this recipe--it gets the job done & done easy!  Thanks

This is the easiest recipe.  The meat falls off the bone.  They are more tender than most restaurants.  I think the ribs would benefit from a good meat rub.  Even with the barbeque sauce I find them to taste a bit to porky.  Also, I they don't turn out as well if the ribs are fatty.  Definitely try to find lean ribs.  I will always make baby back ribs this way.

These ribs are absolutely incredible!!!
Note to the earlier reviewer who called them TOO tender:  there is no such thing!!!  Also, to the one reviewer who didn't feel that they were cooked all the way through, when you use a red sauce/BBQ sauce with pork or chicken, the meat often looks pink inside, even though they are done.  2 1/2 hours at 300 degrees is ample time to cook!

Really great ribs.  I used a dry rub, in addition to the barbeque sauce.  I would recommend flipping the ribs every hour or so while cooking.  One rack burned on the bottom because the weight of the ribs caused the sugar to carmelize.

yes the meat fell right off the bone, but there  wasn't much flavor. I allowed my ribs to marinade over night and each portion had a different bbq sauce. My family said they were plain. As for easy, it was very easy.

I read the reviews and modified to their suggestions.  I coated the ribs with a dry rub instead of BBQ.  After marinating and baking, we coated the meat in a BBQ sauce  and finished on the grill.

We make these ribs at least once every 6 weeks and have been since we found this recipe several years ago.  I have always wanted to make fall off the bone ribs and this recipe does it every time.  I did read many of the other reviews and agree with a lot of the suggestions.  We do remove the silver skin off of the back of the ribs as some suggest.  It is easy to grab ahold of if you use paper towel.  You definitely have to take these out after the 2.5 hrs, unwrap them, add more BBQ sauce to the top then broil them for 5-10 minutes or until the sauce starts to bubble and carmalize.  Watch this step closely as to not completely burn the sauce.  We also double line the pan with aluminum foil.  As several reviews suggest the juices do tend to run out of the foil at times while cooking.  Once you remove the meat from the foil packets it will also spill juices onto the pan.  If you broil the ribs with the fresh BBQ sauce with the juice on the pan the juice will definitely burn and smoke up your oven.  We unwrap the ribs and set them on a cutting board or platter.  Once they are all unwrapped we peel up the first layer of aluminum foil on the pan and the fresh layer of foil is still sitting below it.  We then put the ribs back on the pan and coat them with the sauce for broiling.  Once they are done broiling you can move them to a platter and remove the dirty foil making cleanup of the pan VERY easy.

It bothers me when someone criticizes or adjust an original recipe.  These ppl go out there way to share, sometimes family recipes and it changed.  SMH!
I have done it both ways.  A dry rub and a bbq sauce, vinegar and sprite marinade.  Over the holiday weekend, I did the wet rub because I was lazy and didn't have to touch the meat with my hands.  Either way is good and tender.  I only get falling off the bones if I cook for 3 hours or if I boil it prior to oven.  I can never get the outside grill to behave for my ribs.

This recipe was good. Definitely do a dry rub and bake for longer and at a lower temp than the recipe calls for.

I liked this recipe because its so quick and easy to make but, cooking it to exact directions, I was unimpressed with the flavor, even after trying the sauce recommended by other reviewers.  The second time I added a good rub recipe I've used before to pre-season and did not add the BBQ sauce until about half way through the cooking time. And yes, definitely throw it under the broiler before serving.  I made a few other tweaks but wont go into details since that would make for a different recipe entirely.  Due to the ease In prep and pretty decent flavor this is a good go-to for oven prepped ribs.

so awesome!! I would definitely use the dry rub during baking and brush on BBQ sauce right before the broil though. the result is just breathtakingly beautiful.

I followed Cathy Ms rub and my own bbq sauce ;)  the recipe & timeing in the oven make these ribs fall apart so much so, that we serve them directly in the cooking tray.  Some people say if u let them sit half an hour they firm up then you can put them on the bbq to crisp up. But I don't know who would want to mess with these! !!

Not happy!! Who wants their ribs '' falling off the bone? '' I like to be able to slice them up in a pile and have people eat them off the bone. They need to be done just right so they are not tough, but are nice to bite off the bone.  otherwise may as well eat pork tenderloin with the sauce on it which is good but not ribs!!

Super simple, but the flavor was lacking in the meat.  It certainly did fall off the bones.

First time making ribs and these came out perfect. Made a few changes from advice on here. Used the dry rub and refidgerated for 8 hrs then baked for 2.5hrs. I then brushed on bbq sauce and broiled uncovered for 5 min. Very tender!!!

I made the ribs just like the recipe said except I put more sauce on the ribs and put them under the broiler for 10 minutes to bake on the sauce.  This was an important step and made the outcome much more attractive and tasty!!!!

delicious, used a rub and sauce and broiled it 15 minutes before serving to give it a nice color. I didn't marinate it for 8 hours and it was a bit lacking in flavor inside. I am making it again and marinating it over night.

My first time making ribs. I made them on request from my team at work. I followed the dry rub that Cathy M posted. I heard many times,"these are the best ribs I've ever had." and,"when are you opening your own restaurant." I had someone from Georgia tell me it was like going home. I would recommend this to anyone wanting great ribs. Super flavorful and fall off the bone good.

Easy and Awesome!!!Used a chipotle rub first to marinate for about 4 hours, then brushed with Sweet Baby Rays and baked.  Took out about 20 minutes early to rebaste and broiled for the last few minutes to add a crispy layer.

Make sure you try to remove as much of the silver membrane from the back of the ribs to make them easier to eat (less tug) I followed RobsRibs review and used a dry rub on the ribs.  They were in the fridge, wrapped in non-stick sprayed foil, for about 5 hours. They went in the oven at 250 degrees for 2 hours (maybe a bit more)then my husband used apple wood chips and grilled at 350 for 30 mins or so...  The ribs were very good - fall off the bone goodness.  We topped with Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce.  Yum!

This recipe is the best I have ever tried. Everytime I invite people and serve those ribs, they love it. I always do the "Dry Rub for ribs" Cathy is giving on this site and also follow her instructions which are excellent.  Andrée

the meat did fall off the bones but it was very greasy, next time i'm going to bake in the oven and then finish them off on the grill for 45 minutes to remove most of the grease and to also give it that barbeque taste.  the meat taste more like a pork roast.

The key to 
cooking ribs whether you're grilling, smoking or using the oven is low and slow. Low temperature and take the time, it will always turn out. and open the foil the last 15 minutes.

Melted right off the bone. My girlfriend was thrilled. We ended up eating half immediately and then the other half I turned into sandwiches. Such a simple recipe but effective.

Excellent recipe. My family loved it. It is now in our family menu recipes. I took the advice to dry rub the racks and brush the sauce before broiling for 8 min.
Thanks for sharing.

I used a rub on the ribs, then put a thick coat of BBQ sauce on top and let the ribs marinate overnight.  The next morning, I put another coat of BBQ sauce on the ribs.  I then cooked them in the over at 325 degrees.  I brushed them with more BBQ sauce about 3 times while cooking.  Once they were just about done, I removed the foil and let them brown a little for about 20 min.  They were delicious!!!

The jury is open on this one... I had only had ribs a handful of times before but I remembered loving them. I didn't really like them from this recipe (I guess I prefer mine BBQ'ed?), **BUT** my boyfriend thought they were great and he said they came out as they were supposed to. So excuse my rating, it might just be personal preference.

These are wonderful, I've made them several times, but used the dry rub as suggested by Cathy M in the reviews.  I don't use barbecue sauce at all, but you could add it after.

These were far and beyond the best ribs I have made to date. I didn't have time to marinate so I rubbed them with a dry rub, tented them and baked as directed. I then set them under the broiler to brown the tops and then lathered them with sauce and set them under the broiler again until sticky and perfect. And they were perfect! A tip to readers: removing the membrane from the under side is a definite MUST. It really makes a difference between good ribs and great ribs. This is a wonderfully simple recipe that leaves lots of room for personalization.

LOVED this recipe! I didn't know i was making ribs until 4 in the afternoon so i couldn't marinate it overnight. I did take the suggestion of other reviewers to rubs some paprika pepper and a smidge of sugar on it. A lot of people mentioned the tinfoil leaked, which mine did, so to fix that problem i just slid a piece of tinfoil on the rack below and it caught all the drippings. My favourite part about this recipe? clean up is a crumbled piece of tinfoil. will be making this again and again!

This was my first time making ribs and they turned out AMAZING!  I tried one rack with the rub suggested by other viewers, and one with just bbq sauce, couldnt have turned out any better.  Thank you for the recipe

I don't really like ribs but I did like these.  Easy and you can put any seasoning or sauce that you like on them. We were going to grill them but at the last minute decided not to, but they were still really good.

I was skeptical of anything this easy, but, as promised, they were delicious. I picked up some ribs from the local grocer that were already dry rubbed (in "butt rub"). I covered them in peach whiskey sauce, wrapped tightly, and put them in the fridge for a few hours. Then I baked in the oven exactly as instructed, and yum! So tender the bones just pulled right out. My only regret was not having more ribs.

Absolutely great recipe for BBQ Ribs, especially for us apartment dwellers.  We do have a little green where we can BBQ, but why bother when you have a recipe like this!

I give this 5 stars because it gave me the directions on how to cook at proper temperature to get the desired results.  In addition to the time/temp, I removed the membrane on the backside and used just a BBQ rub and liquid smoke. when 95% complete, I brushed on the sauce and finished it up. 

If all you need is time/temp to cook your baby back ribs, this is it.

So simple! WE made these for easter and they lived up to all the great reviews.  I rubbed my meat down and let sit overnight, then coated with some bbq sauce when I put them into the oven.  I also broiled mine about 5 minutes per side basting twice per sided.  They were wonderful!

Great recipe, simple and tasty. I didn't marinate overnight, only for an hour or so, still turned out tasty and juicy. Did broil it on high, like other reviewers suggested. Thank you!

This recipe was excellent with the rub suggested by Cathy M. The butcher had fresh beef short ribs but I look forward to the next time with the smaller pork ribs.

PERFECT RIBS!  I was short on time so I didn't marinate.  I also cooked at 325 for 2 hours and finished under the broiler for 15 minutes.  Using Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ Sauce, this was a sticky wonderful dish.  This is a very forgiving recipe.  Thank you KHEFFN for sharing!

I didn't have time to marinate my baby back ribs. I just sprayed the foil, sprinkled McCormicks bbq grill spice on each side, brushed on some bbq sauce and wrapped them up in the foil. I let them sit for about 20 minutes then put them in a 300 degree oven for 2 hours. they came out perfectly! I was going to throw them on the grill but it wasn't necessary. The meat fell off of the bones and tasted delicious.

Please read this...how many times have you had charred, rubbery ribs at a barbecue?  This recipe is spectacular, and absurdly easy, you guys.  Pull 'em out of the oven, slather some BBQ sauce on them, and throw 'em on the grill for 10-15 minutes. My brother-in-law asked what restaurant I got them from.  Just divine and so easy.

It worked great. I thought the recipe was too simple but when I make it, I found that the key was "Bake ribs wrapped tightly in the foil" because it keeps the heat inside and the ribs will be very juicy. However, that method will not let the marinade stick to the ribs enough. What I did was after 2 hours, I unwrapped the ribs, place it on the pan, pour more bbq sauce on top, bake it 30 minutes more. The meat inside was tender with nice dark glaze outside. It was very successful.

I have to give this method five stars because these ribs are great! We will throw the ribs on the grill for a few minutes when it they are done just to get that frilled taste.

These were the best ribs I have ever made.  I put a dry rub on the ribs and then put them in the oven for 2.5 hours.  I then put the bbq sauce on and broiled them for 5 min (bottom up) and then another 10 (meat side up).  They fell off the bone and were very tender.

The best ribs I have ever tasted, very tender !   I put "Adams Rib Rubb" on them the night before and let them marinade for about 15 hours. Right before I put them in the oven I added some Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce.  Broiled for about 7 minutes after baking.  The only rib recipe I will use from now on !!

The idea is great but I the BBQ sauce that I picked didn't work out for my tastebuds.  Will definitely try again.  The meat was juicy and fallen right off the bones as promised.

My fiance was craving Outback Steakhouse Baby backs so instead of eating out I wanted to give it a shot. I didn't have time to marinate overnight but it was still so yummy! I just broiled it for a few mins at the end to get it sticky. Thanks for a simple but great recipe! :)

Great easy recipe for ribs.  I pulled off the clear membrane, used a dry rub, however I didn't have time to marinate but the ribs still turned out great.

WOW!!!!  AWESOME!!  I didn't get a chance to marinade this for 8 hours....only for about 5 hours.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's sauce, baked it for the 2 1/2 hours.....added more sauce to the top and removed it from the foil & juices.  Then I put it on broil for about 10 min!  It was FABULOUS!!!  Will use this recipe over and over for sure!!!

This is the only way I fix my baby back ribs now. After they come out of the oven, I'll broil them for about 5 minutes for the charred flavor/look.Wonderful recipe.Thanks

This is a great way to cook ribs in the oven with a very easy clean up. I like the fact that you can use your favorite sauce whether it is homemade or store bought. I always thought I had to go out to eat to enjoy ribs but not anymore. Thanks for the wonderful recipe

Rib's are my husbands favorite food, My very first time making them was a disaster!!!  All you could do was lick the BBQ sauce off, That was 21yrs ago when we first got married I had never attempted them again until my husband suggested I try again!!!!   I began looking for recipe's I had even watched some video's on youtube. And then I came across your recipe ( I would Say Technique, Not recipe) But anyway It was AMAZING my husband loved them they fell right off the bone and I had plenty left so I reheated them and took my 75yr old father (With denture's) some the next day. He is still raving about them!! I was shocked at how tender they were after reheating. Now my (7) sister's want to know how I made them, But I think I will keep this one to myself. Thank's So Much!!!!!!!

This "recipe" did produce fall off the bone tender ribs. The bones literally fell out of the meat when I took them out of the foil to broil them. I think you should definately finish them under the broiler. Also I did not marinate over night, simply b/c I misread the directions. I did however marinate them in "dry rub for ribs" from this site, over night. Then added sauce. This will be my go to method for ribs.

OMG!!! This was my very first time making ribs and I was skeptical about it at first but the recipe had so many great reviews I just had to try it out.I used a pork rub and added brown sugar to it before putting on Sweet Baby Ray's barbeque sauce and I marinated it overnight in foil. I followed the advice of others and after baking them for 2 1/2 hours I broiled them about six minutes on each side to get the "caramelized" effect .To say that these ribs were just "good" would be an understatement.They were impeccable!!! Thanks Ken!!!

My first experience w/ making ribs & I was very impressed. I followed the directions exactly. I used the rub, as recommended & at the end of cooking put the oven on broil & basted each side w/ bbq sauce. These were definitely restaurant style. Thanks for posting this!

I made this for New Year's Day dinner and what a hit! My father in law couldn't stop talking about them. I used the rub that Cathy M. suggested and was not disappointed. They got a little charred on the grill but turns out everyone liked it that way (they spent 5 minutes per side on a hot grill). Will be making this again and again.

These were the best ribs I have ever made!  I did rub some seasoning and EVOO onto the ribs in addition to the barbecue sauce.  The ribs literally fell of the bone.  My family and I enjoyed these for Christmas.  My husband loved them and he doesn't even like ribs as much as I do.  We are planning on making them next week.  Thanks for this very simple recipe.  This is the third time that I have made these ribs and I did not have time to marinate them so I just rubbed beef seasoning, EVOO, and poured the BBQ sauce on them and place them in the oven.  The ribs still turned out amazing!

Whether you want to call this a recipe or not who cares! You could go the extra mile if you chose and make your own rub and your own bbq sauce. I think that would be fine also. But, I have made this twice using a very good commercial bbq sauce. The first time I used a rub, this last time I didn't it is good both ways. I think the ease of this recipe out weighs squabbling about its difficulty. I think its fabulous that it is so easy. Sometimes you just want to eat something really tasty and really easy and this is that. I threw in baked potatoes in the oven and cooked some veggies. I didn't do anything more than add a bit more sauce on these (sauce was room temp) when they came out. My family really enjoyed this.

Update: I have used this recipe countless times over the years and just before serving I unwrap, slather a little more bbq sauce on and I broil to finish.  I have friends coming for dinner and a lot to do so this is what we will be enjoying with potatoes and fresh corn.  Easy prep, easy serving, better than most rib restaurants.

Holy cow.  I used spareribs instead of baby back, so I cooked them for 3 hours instead of two and a half.  And I rubbed them with brown sugar before marinating.  These were literally falling off the bone.  Mmmmmmmmmm.

This is a great recipe, especially because of the marinating.  I suggest using a rib rub and using two different kinds of BBQ sauce when preparing it.  I used a small (8oz) bottle of a spicier, more vinegar based BBQ sauce to marinate the ribs and then a more sweet BBQ sauce (Masterpiece works well) when baking them.  Also, I suggest cooking them for three full hours on a grill or oven and then for another twenty minutes on the grill on low heat (about 300 degrees) out of the foil.  This extra time (with a lot of sauce on top of it) adds a little bit of sweet "crust" on the outside of the fall off the bone ribs.

After baking time was complete I unwrapped the ribs and put on a fresh coat of BBQ sauce.  I then broiled ribs in oven until sauce started to carmalize (3-5 Minutes watch carefully not to burn them).  These were delicious I will definately be making them regualrly.

Very good....they were very tender and had very good flavor.  I also put them on the grill and added additional BBQ sauce after baking them in the oven.  My children are very picky about their ribs....and they loved these.

Although this recipe tastes fine, we prefer ribs on the grill. The sauce on these ribs melts off and you really need to serve with additional sauce. Ribs are more like BBQ flavored ribs than BBQ Ribs.

This was an excellent recipe that was easy to make.  I did the rub and cooked it at the lower temperature as others suggested. The meat just fell off the bones.

I didn't have time to marinate overnight but it was still delicious after only a couple of hours marinating in Kraft spicy BBQ sauce the fridge. I've made slow cooker BBQ ribs using a similar recipe with only so-so results. With this version, I followed the advice of other reviewers and removed the foil towards the end, basting with more BBQ sauce and broiling on both sides for 7 mins each. The broiling gave it just the right finish. This was enjoyed by my family, including my 2 picky girls who usually have opposite tastes. Try it & enjoy!

the ribs were tender, but it didn't "wow" me. Next time, I will definitely bake them dry with the rub and make sure there are no juices sitting in the foil before baking. After baking, make sure you broil them for at least 20 mins with your favorite bbq sauce, you can add some brown sugar on top of it too for it to caramelize

Perfect!  I followed the other reviews and added a rub.  After adding the rub, I wrapped them in foil and put them in the fridge overnight.  Then I brushed on the BBQ sauce and baked for 1 1/2 hours.  We threw them on the grill for a few minutes after, to keep them from being "over juicy".  The meat was falling off the bones, they were delicious.  I'll never go out for ribs again:)

Really good they fell right off the bone.  After baking them I put them on the outdoor grill just to give them that grill look and make them a little crispy.

This is a great way to do ribs...really simple. Unfortunately, the ribs I used were overly fat, but will definitely try again with better meat.

I used the dry rub recipe by Denise. Rubbed it in, covered with foil,and left in fridge overnight. Next day followed  these  cooking directions. Last 30 mins I brushed on honey bbq sauce. The family raved about these ribs!!!

Amazing! Follow Cathy M's advice 1) remove the membrane, 2) make the "Dry Rub for Ribs" from this site,3) use only the rub to marinade them for 8+ hours, 4) cook 2 hours at 300. I also cut them into two, or three rib sections. That way they are easier to serve to a group. I like to bake several racks at a time. Once they cool slightly, I pop them into food saver bags and freeze them in meal size portions. They are perfect for a quick summer dinner. I finish them off on the grill with Sweet Baby Rays sauce. Delicious! In fact, I am going to go make a batch right now!!!

Absolutely AMAZING!!!!!!!!  Rubbed with the rub recipe mentioned in the ratings then used Bullseye BBQ Sauce and left overnight.  Baked for 2.5 hours at 300 then put in the fridge for several hours.  Grilled with more Bullseye and added some Jack Daniels grilling pellets in foil underneath.  The absolute best ribs we've ever tasted!!!!!

Excellent to way to cook ribs!  They were so tender and flavorful.  I followed another reviewers advice and marinated the ribs overnight in a pork rub, but I used a little too much and it overpowered the taste of the pork.  But that's my fault with fooling around with such a good recipe!

Excellent for such an easy recipe! Per previous reviews, after baking, I took the ribs out of the foil, placed them on a baking rack, brushed one side with more BBQ sauce, broiled it for about 7 minutes, turned it over and brushed the other side with more sauce and broiled it for another 6-7 minutes.

I wasnt even sure if I liked ribs....I do :) I put them on the bbq after baking for approx 2.5hr (I let them cool for a while)...so delicious I guess you need to be sure to pick the best sauce if you dont make it yourself, Cattlemans was super good :)

I added a bit of liquid smoke to the BBQ sauce, just to add a bit more smoke flavor.

Fantabulous!!!  I only  marinated the ribs for about 3 hours and they were still awesome! Easy clean up if you put foil down on the baking sheet (easy clean up is always a plus)

This was wonderful and so incredibly easy! I did open the foil during the last 10 minutes, add a little more sauce and turn the oven to broil. Next time I will remove the membrane on the bottom also. Thanks for the recipe!!

I made this using a rub,suggested in another review, instead of bbq sauce. I really like the marinade and cooking method, however the rub i used was way too spicy for my taste buds. I took it to work like i usually do when the family doesn't like something i cook. Everyone there really loved it! I will definatly use this method again. I did leave the membrane on because I wanted to finish them on the grill and i was afraid they would fall apart, it was still very tender. For winter time when the grill isn't an option though I would remove them membrane.

These were delisious but next time I will add salt or some type of seasoning before adding more bb-que sauce under broiler.  I did add a rub under sauce before refrigerating and that was not enough.  So tender and most of the grease is gone.  Maybe next time just add rub after cooking before broiling.

This was the first time I, too, made ribs b/c I thought they were too time consuming.  I used KC Masterpiece BBQ sauce.  These were excellent.  They are so succulent and melt in your mouth.  Definitely a keeper.  I think next time I will season the ribs with a little salt, pepper, and garlic powder.

With the suggestions of others (broiling, dry rub etc) these came out amazing.  Fall off the bone in the most extreme sense.  They were delicious an I'll be making these again and again.  Couldn't have been easier!!

Excellent! I made a rub and let it sit overnight instead of the BBQ sauce. I added the sauce at the end and stuck it under the broiler for a few minutes. Came out just perfect.

This was GREAT.. I have to admit I am not a good BBQ'er. My Husband has done it on the grill for 32 years of our marriage and then this last year "I" became the one in charge of that part of the cooking also.. 
Back to the Ribs. I've had several BAD tries at cooking Baby Back Ribs. And the price is to much to mess up. This was GREAT. Fall off the bone tender and EASY. Loved it.. And Hubby loved them and has already asked for more..

Just got up from the table after trying these ribs.  Followed the recipe and suggestions from other reviews and they were good, very tender, but not great - a little on the plain side.  If I do them again, I will try a rub/marinade with more intense flavor.  I used a TexJoy rub that we have in Southeast texas and is my seasoning for just about everything, but it did not bring out the flavor I was hoping or looking for.

AWESOME!! And easy... My husband is a BBQ Rib lover, and he said these are the best. I did out some rub on them first, just for extra seasoning. But it didn't even need it.

This recipe is wonderful! Also, no mess and nothing to clean up. I used "Sweet Baby Ray's Hickory & BrownSugar" barbeque sauce and the flavor was spectacular! I will never make ribs any other way. Thank You!!!

I will never make ribs any other way ever again!  I use big Al's BBQ sauce, no sauce is better!  I cook my ribs in a cooking bag!  I also cook the ribs at a lower temperature, 225 degrees for a bit longer than 2.5 hours -- A perfect 10 every time!

Super yummy!!! I usually make my own sauce but this time I opted to use Sweet Baby Ray's which we've had before and really liked on these ribs. For restaurant quality ribs remember to broil them or throw them on the grill for a few minutes after baking with some extra sauce(I cut down the baking time by just a few minutes to allow the extra cooking time under the broiler). Last time I put them on the grill but this time I used cookie sheets covered in foil with cooking spray and broiled them for about 10 minutes or so. Either way is good and it really makes a difference.

I read the other reviews and added thinly sliced onion, garlic and salt and pepper to the ribs before baking.  I also placed them on a cookie sheet to contain the mess.  They were so good! This is the first time I have ever attempted ribs and I will definitely do it again, the exact same way! Yum!

Well I tried making ribs for the first time because my husband is a huge fan of the restaurant Tony Romas. I cant say first hand they were great, because I'm not a rib fan but I will say my husband said they were amazing and easily out do Tony Roma ribs! He loved them and said the recipe is a keeper! I broiled my ribs on low for about 10 minutes after the 2.5 hours. Great recipe! Look beautiful!

Fantastic recipe!!!!  I was always afraid to try this recipe for ribs, but I finally tried them for dinner tonight.  They are so good!  Tender, moist - fall off the bones ribs!!!!  I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce and slow cooked them as directed.... they were great!  Thank you for the recipe

Our ribs quite literally fell off of the bone. We picked them up and the meat stayed were it was. The kids weren't crazy about them but me and the hubby were. Thanks!

I would give this 5 stars because it is so easy, but I think it needs a little more flavor than just the BBQ sauce.  My fiance and I each made a rack (we had a rib cookoff) and baked them according to the instructions on this recipe.  His turned out with a way better flavor because in addition to the BBQ sauce he did a dry rub.  That is the way I will make them in the future, but the oven method is perfect for getting the ribs moist.  Just do a flash grill on the sides for a glaze and chow down!

I have to give this 5 stars because it delivered flavorful, tender meat that feel from the bones as promised, but I don't think I'd make this again.  Since the meat did in fact fall from the bones, we didn't actually get to enjoy a real rib eating experience where you actually hold the ribs in your hands and chow.  The meat fell off as soon as a rib was handled so we ended up eating the meat off the plate either with fingers or a fork. Not munching away on the actual rib took the fun out of it for me.

Best ribs we've ever had! I made them for the fourth of July and everyone loved them. They were literally falling off the bone. I made my own teriyaki BBQ sauce: 1 cup ketchup, 1 cup sugar, 1 cup soy sauce; 1 tbs ginger powder, 1.5 tbs garlic from a jar (or 1 tbs powdered garlic). Fabulous!

These were the best ribs from an oven we have ever had.  I used a dry rub found   on this site, but it had too much black pepper for us.  It overtook the flavor of all else.  But the ribs were done to a turn and falling off the bones.  Great technique.

I just have to say this is the absloute best receipe.  I did not need to broil mine, they looked great without it- my boys who are younger still were all screaming for more...  I did do the rub that was suggested, and put an entire bottle of sauce, I also did wrap it very very well in foil.  I did like another person suggested and made foil potatoes with it... supreme!!!  I think this will be our new Sunday favorite...
Thanks so so much

OMG, these are the best ribs I think I have ever had..!!! They just cook in there own juices in those packets and make them VERY tender..!!!  I have to agree with others that broiling them with extra bbq sauce for about 10min after works great..!!  Thank YOU so much for this great recipe, I will never cook ribs any other way..!!

These were a hit!  The only thing I changed was putting them on the grill for a few minutes before serving which added a nice smoky BBQ flavour.  Be careful though.  The meat really does fall off the bones so they're a bit difficult to turn on the BBQ.

I experimented with these ribs for a barbecue my husband and I had, just because the recipe seemed so easy.  I have a rib recipe that always gets rave reviews, but this one was over the top!!  Not only were they easy to make, EVERYONE absolutely loved them.  My husband said, "I don't know what you did differently, but I LIKE IT!" The only suggestion would be to pick a sauce that is well to your tasting, and I did use a spicy rub when I cooked them just to give them a kick!!  AWESOME!

Very tender ribs, to be honest I doubt we would ever fix them this way again. Its baked meat and tasted like it. When I eat ribs I want that Bar-B-Q pit flavor you can only get from a grill.

These are certainly tender, but it would have been much nicer to have a homemade sauce instead of bottled stuff. I just can't give this one 5 stars using bottled sauce since the ribs will be different according to the sauce used. I used KC Masterpiece sauce for mine and that made it 5 star worthy. I used 2 racks of ribs because my guys can eat nearly a rack by themselves.

WOW! These came out amazing! Extremly tender. I used a dry rub recipe I found on this site. As well as a mixture of hot & spicy bbq sauce and honey bbq sauce. I basted them again at the end of cooking and stuck them in the broiler to cook on the sauce. I can't wait to make these again!

I made these for 4th of july and i think i didnt make enough!  I made probably 10 lbs of baby back ribs but people just couldnt put them down.  i did marinate my ribs over night with a dry rub of cayanne, paprika, cumin, garlic and cracked black pepper.  Cooking them in the oven saved so much room on the grill for other foods.

This was soooo delicious!!!  I normally tend to overcook my meat and it turns out hard and dry but this actually fell off the bone.  I was so surprised!  I'll be making this again for sure.

Wow, the best ribs that I ever tasted and I made them!! I did put them on the grill for a couple of minutes, but the next time I won't because they are great right out of the oven. Okay, I had to take a sample before putting them on the grill! Thanks for sharing this recipe, Ken.

These were great! I will definitely make again. My husband is a big rib fan and he loved these, the meat just fell off the bones, so I wasnt able to throw 'em on the grill last minute like some people suggested. I used KC Masterpiece bbq sauce.

First time using this recipe and ribs were fabulous.  After oven cooking put them on the grill for just a couple minutes. Meat just fell off the bone.  Delicious!

Unbelievably delicious. Yes, the meat just fell of the bone!
Add a little dash of brown sugar as well as other spices (garlic powder, pepper) with the BBQ sauce, and it's perfect.
I made it for my sister's bridal shower and it was a hit.

HUGS AND KISSES TO CHEF KEN FOR POSTING THIS AWESOME RECIPE!!!!

So Simple! Works great foe Sunday dinner after church. Dinners ready when we get home. My oldest son just married and leaves on the opposite coast, he called last night for this recipe. Even new cooks can do this well. We tried it with chicken also and was great!

These are great and so easy.  I also used a dry rub on them.  I made them at Easter and am making them again for tomorrow.  They just fall off the bone.

As promised, the meat does fall off the bone.  I followed other reviewers advice and broiled them for about fifteen minutes when done, after basting again with barbeque sauce.  I wish I had not broiled them quite so long, because it dried them out.

This is great!  We made it for my parents when they were visiting and my dad raved about them!  I used the dry rub and marinated the ribs for about 6 hours.  I used reg. foil but triple wrapped the bottom.  I baked them at 275 for 2.5 hours (because we were going away and I did not want to overcook them), checked them and baked them for .5 hours more at 300.  They still were not quite tender so I kicked it up to 350 for .5 hours more and they were perfect.  We grilled them for a short time with more bbq sauce until they had the crispy glaze.  We used Montgomery Inn sauce -- the best!  We'll use this recipe again for other rib connoisseurs in our family!!

These ribs were wonderful. The whole family really liked them.  I cooked for 3 hours and then brushed with more sauce and put under the broiler for about 15 min.  They fell off the bone.  Will definitely make these again

The meat was tender but this is definately not the ideal way to make ribs.  Best way is on the grill.  This recipe left a watery mess and the flavors were diluted.

This recipe is by far the easiest and best rib recipe!  My family requests it all of the time.  Nothing could be tastier or easier.  Before brushing with barbeque sauce, I apply a rub of salt, pepper, paprika, garlic powder and a little brown sugar. Eight hours is more than enough time to allow the sauce the marinate with the ribs.  Enjoy!

This is terrific.  I have made these several times and they are a favorite of family and friends.  I usually make several packages with different sauces, some bought, some homemade. I place the packages on a cookie sheet in the oven as they do sometimes spill.  Just brown on the grill and they are so tasty and so so tender!

I have never made ribs before, and these were soooo easy and good.  My 7 year old came home from school and asked what smelled so good!  These are great.  I did use the dry rub that was recommended in previous reviews.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This is a great way to cook ribs, especially in the middle of the winter when firing up a grill isn't the "norm".  The meat was very tender.  I used a rib rub overnite, and bbq sauce marinade all day (8 hours). But cooking them this way leaves LOTS of juice in the foil and it 'waters down' the spices/sauce.  It was OK.  Great cooking method, but I think as others suggested it certainly does need to be opened up (messy job) basted and broiled to created a better surface and perhaps thicken the sauce through evaporation.  Tad too runny, but they were good.

GREAT RIBS!! They are so tender they fall off the bone. We use Tony Romas carolina honey sauce. Easy clean up too.

Yum.
I'm not a big rib fan, but they were delicious and my husband must have said "mmmm" about 12 times during dinner. 
Marinated overnight after using dry rub from this site and served with "restaurant style coleslaw" also from this site.

Great and simple recipe. The key to great ribs is two fold-- how to flavor and to cook. This recipe correctly indicates how to cook slowly. I used the suggestion by the reviewer of 8/23 and tried a dry rub (I used Big Bubbas Rubba Memphis Grillin Rub-- they have a website) and then after the oven cooking portion I cooked on the grill for about 20-30 min (both direct and indirect). If you like sweeter ribs add a little brown sugar to the rub.

This recipe made excellent ribs.  My family said they taste like the ones at our favorite restaurant.  The only change/addition I made was to dry rub them with the "Dry Rub For Ribs" (found on this website) and I too agree that you have to put them on the grill for a couple of minutes to get a true barbeque taste.  Delicious!

This is the easiest way to prepare BB Ribs. My family really, really loved these. The best part for me was the easy clean up. Added comment: It had been some time since I made these, so when I saw that ribs were on sale, I immediately remembered this recipe. Forgot how good and easy these are to make. Family ate them up

These were pretty good - I also added the dry rub and marinated overnight.  They reminded me of a local restaurant's ribs that fall off the bone.

So good, so easy! I didn't even have to pick up one bone to take the meat off, it just fell off.   I did not marinate my Ribs and they turned out just as good as the first time that I made them. Other than that I did not change the recipe at all.  Thank you for puting this recipe on All Recipes, it is a big, big winner.

These were amazing- even better than some of the ribs I've had in restaurants! I knew they were going to be a hit when my son came home from school and said "Mmmmm...what smells so good?". I made two full racks and not a single one remained! Even my finicky 2 year old loved them. Only two ingredients - what could be easier? The only thing I did different from the original recipe was add a rub consisting of garlic powder, brown sugar, salt & pepper. This one is a definite keeper!!

These ribs turned out so good! I used spare ribs and used the dry rub from this site and Sweet Baby Rays sauce and let marinate overnight. I baked at 325 degrees for 2 hours then put under the broiler for about 5 minutes. Put more sauce on them before I put under the broiler. Thse were soo tender! This was my first time making ribs and it was so easy...will make again and again...thanks for the recipe!Also it's great because I live in an apartment and cannot grill...this is just as good!!

Very good.  Thanks for posting this recipe.  My husband loved the ribs!  He's actually going to have me make it again so he could take it to work to "show-off" to his friends how his wife (me, of course) can bake home-made baby backs.  Thank you again!  Very easy to make too since we don't own a grill. =)

Worked just great.  I used spare ribs instead of baby backs.  I did go ahead and pour more sauce on at the end and broiled for 4 minutes/side.  Thanks for the cooking technique!

My search is over for my favorite baby back ribs!  This is lip smackin', finger-lickin' good!  Don't forget to broil at least 4 mins. per side for that BBQ look, and choose your favorite BBQ sauce as well.  Thanks for the recipe Ken!

This worked really well on beef short ribs! I agree with everyone else about adding a seasoning to the ribs. Even though they are really good as is, seasoning the ribs would do so much for them. I am going to try to use 2 cloves crushed garlic, 1/2 tsp salt, and cumin and black pepper(to taste). I normally use this combination of seasoning on each piece of steak I cook (pierce meat). Enjoy!

Very easy and delicious! I used a pork roast butt and poured the sauce into a slow cooker. It was very good! I think I'll add some cornstarch though...
thanks!

Yo, this recipe is truly awesome!  Preparation is ridiculously easy. I use Sonny's sweet BBQ sauce. If you have never tried to make ribs before- try this recipe with confidence!  If you live in the southeast, I recommend Sonny's sauce!

the most tender and also the easiest ribs i have ever made at home.  only one suggestion, you may want to broil or put on grill unwrapped to "set" the sauce after cooking.  my favorite sauce is Bubba's sweet and spicey bar-b-que sauce from jackson wyoming

This recipe was fantastic!  We don't have a lot of rib restaurants in Australia (only Tony Romas and Lonestar Steakhouses) and after a trip to the US, we fell in love with ribs.  This is better than any rib restaurant in Oz!  I brushed the ribs with a little more sauce just before serving for that extra flavour.  THANKS KEN!

I took the earlier advice and used the Dry Rub for Ribs.  I also cooked mine in the crock pot.  The meat fell off the bones.  Very tender.  My husband complained that the ribs were bitter.  Next time I will try a different BBQ sauce and/or rub and cook them in the oven to see if the flavor is better.

This was a wonderful receipe! It was so easy and fast. Your right, the meat just feel off the bone.
I only wished I would have seasoned the meat more before I added the sauce. My husband loved it. This is a keeper. 

Thanks

This was the bomb!  Cooked this in the Reynolds bag and it came out more than perfect.  Also took a previous posters tip and rubbed the ribs with seasoning spice (The Keg's) prior to coating with barbeque sauce.  Hubby told me that from now on, I cook the ribs! :)

This was definately a great alternative way to prepare ribs on a cold, windy night when grilling outside isn't really what you want to do.  I also threw on a little liquid smoke and we thought these ribs were delicious.  Thanks! Ken

I couldn't find baby back ribs, so I used country style ribs and used another reviewer's suggestion of wadding up a few pieces of foil and putting them in the bottom of the crock pot, adding a cup of water, then putting the ribs wrapped in foil on top. It was ready when I got home from work and it was tender and delicious!

I am a vegetarian and I had no idea what to make for my carnivorous friends that were coming over for dinner!  This recipe was a hit!  They loved it!  And it was sooo easy for me to make.
I sprinkles a little lemon pepper on before I added the BBQ sause.

While I applaud the tenderness and ease of this recipe, it lacks flavor in the meat itself.  Perhaps using a rub before applying the barbeque sauce would solve the problem.

My husband loved them.  The only thing is that there was so little meat on the ribs, I spent all dinner pulling off meat for my girls.  The kids did like the taste of the meat though.

This was the first time I had ever made ribs.  They were great!  Who cares if you use a bottled sauce or make your own, these are a keeper in my house!

This was a great recipe.  The BBQ sauce makes all the difference.  We used a homemade sauce for the first time and didn't like it.  Next time we'll use a better sauce.  Awesome recipe!!

These were delicious. I did exactly as the recipe called for but I did add more sauce at the end and broil for a few minutes. It made all the difference in how they looked -- great! Compared to how they look when you open up the tin foil after baking. I'm about to make again, this time with a bigger rib.

Fall off the bone perfection — the kids absolutely loved it!! I used SWEET BABY RAYS ORIGINAL and FAMOUS DAVE’S RIB RUB... great flavor!! I did remove from the packets and broil... it held to caramelize the BBQ sauce

tasted great! Put rub on short ribs, smothered it in bbq sauce and wrapped it in tin foil for eight hours. I forgot to prepare the tinfoil beforehand, but nothing stuck to the ribs. they fell off the bone too...perfect. Had ribs for a week to eat and received hand-written compliments

Very yummy and very easy. I used the dry rub as per Cathy M's comment. Slathered the BBQ sauce over the rub and marinated overnight. In the morning, I baked it for 2 hours 15 minutes, then changed the foil, slathered on more sauce, and broiled for 4 minutes. I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce.

OMG I don't even know where to begin.  The most delicious thing I've ever put into my mouth!  Like lots of others, I boiled the ribs (I used baby-backs) for 45 minutes.  Then, as instructed, I placed on a pan, covered with barbeque sauce (I used Sweet Baby Rays), covered with foil and cooked at 325 for an hour.  After that, I removed the foil, turned up the oven to 400, and slathered more barbeque sauce on, then cooked uncovered x 10 minutes.  Removed from oven and let rest around 10 minutes.  Folks, this could win an award :)

Cut into 1/4 sections, used dry rub, cooked in oven for 2-1/2 hours then let rest before putting in fridge. Finished off later in air fryer with BBQ sauce topping (cut into singles before lathering on sauce. About 8 minutes to get the BBQ sauce to caramelize.  Yum.

This was really great! I follow the other reviewer’s and cooked for 2 1/4 hours, broiled and added more sauce the last 15 minutes. The meat fell off the bone and was delicious!

This is an excellent and easy way to have succulent baby back ribs.  I sprayed my foil with cooking spray, poured in some barbecue sauce, put the ribs on top, added more sauce and sealed it up around 9am.  I put it in the oven at 4, along with a potato wrapped in foil, and waited patiently for 2 1/2 hours. The potato was perfect and the ribs were awesome.

Fall off the bone tender. So simple. I put the ribs under the broiler for a bit to crisp up the BBQ sauce. This is a keeper.

Followed the recipe exactly and while they were super easy and tasty, some of the ribs were really dry.  Maybe it’s the ribs or my oven but I think I’ll either try a lower temperature or cook them for a shorter period of time next go round.

I love ribs, I love Baby Ray's BBQ sauce, but I was very disappointed with this recipe. Yes the ribs were tender fall off the bone but all I could taste was the aluminum foil. I think I actually spoiled the ribs for me.

I have always been reluctant to cook ribs because I thought it would take forever and they'd still be tough.  This method produces tender fall-off-the-bone ribs.  You can try the fancy rubs with it, but for most folks that just isn't necessary.  Two tips that have been mentioned seem worth doing:  strip the membrane on the back and, at the end of the oven baking, brush with a little more sauce, then broil the ribs for a few minutes.  Thanks for sharing!

Take heed to wrap the ribs TIGHTLY.  I didn't do so well and had a lot of leaking from the foil.  It also wasn't easy to remove the hot foil from the hot ribs!  Great taste, though.  Would make it again .

I really love  this method.  The day before cooking I do a brown sugar rub and put the ribs in their foil pouches.  The next morning they go right to the oven from the fridge.  At  the two hour mark I open them up and brush them with my sauce and give them thirty minutes.  Then I turn  them and brush another layer of sauce and another thirty minutes.  Done!   Tender, moist, fall off the bone, delicious and easy cleanup.

I followed the many recommendations - Using the rub (¼ cup brown sugar, 1 ½ Tablespoons Paparika, 1 Tablespoon Kosher Salt, 1 ½ Tablespoons Black Pepper, 1 Teaspoon Garlic powder, 1 Teaspoon Onion Powder, ½ Teaspoon Cayenne Pepper). Since I found this recipe the day I wanted to cook them - so, they only sat with the rub for only a few hours! I cooked for 2 hours, then put on the grill for 15 minutes. They were delicious!

I have made this recipe for years.  They are always a hit, and they're so easy to make.  I rate it the best, but sometimes need an extra 30 minutes, so if on a schedule, give 3 hrs to be safe.

BEST DINNER IN A LONG TIME!  OMG THESE RIBS ARE SO GOOD. I put the dry rub for ribs by Denise (found on this website)  on my ribs for approximately 24 hours (I put them into a plastic bag.). Then  I covered them tightly in Tin foil. I put them into the oven at 300 degrees for  2 hours. I  let them cool for approximately 1 hour then put them on my green egg (at 400 degrees) for 3 minutes/side. I served them with warmed Sweet  baby Ray’s barbecue sauce.  I made Chef John’s macaroni salad and fresh kale salad. Not one rib or side dish was left I got “10’s” from all of my guests. So sweet !

2 lbs baby back ribs, cut in 4 pieces, membrane removed. Dry rubbed & added a tad of BBQ sauce. Sealed in foil. Refrigerate then baked at 275 for 2hrs. Cooled for 1hr then grilled, adding BBQ sauce for 5 minutes per side. Excellent!

This is a no fail recipe.  We use Cathy’s method of baking for 2 hours, letting them cool for an hour and finish on the grill!

I normally prefer to do an overnight dry rub, but decided to give this method a chance. The ribs turned out better than I expected. I did not oven bake them however, as I was crunched for time. After marinating in the BBQ sauce I opened up the packets and cooked the ribs in the Instant Pot for 25 minutes. Then brushed with a bit more sauce and finished on the grill. Yum!

So easy, and delicious. Used the rub recommended and they where the bomb. Tender and delicious. I didn't use the sauce until they finished cooking for 2 and 1/4 hours. Then added BBQ sauce and low broiled for a couple minutes. Yummy.

I followed a previous review and did a dry rub instead of the bbq sauce. My dry rub consisted of brown sugar, cayenne pepper, natures seasoning, smoked paprika and chopped garlic. I marinated it overnight wrapped tight in foil then baked at 300 for 2 hrs and 40min. Removed the foil and brushed with bbq, turned the oven on broil and broiled the ribs for about 5min. These ribs were sooooo tender and flavorful! I used to boil ribs before placing them in the oven or grill, never again! This is my go to, so much easier and the ribs taste soooo much better!

These turned out really well. Haven't had a lot of success with ribs until this recipe. Tweaked it a little. Used the dry rub recipe found here. Then was unsure what to do, so I borrowed. Wrapped in foil, put on a rack, and baked at 225 for about 3.5 hrs. Then unwrapped and used convection roast feature in oven. Convection temp was 275 for the final hour. Then put BBQ sauce on and broiled  until sauce carmelized. Monitored so they wouldn't turn to charcoal. Let them sit for about 10 minutes wrapped in foil. Turned out excellent. This is a great recipe

I baked a slab in foil at 250 degrees for 4 hours. Used only dry rub during the bake. Slapped on some bbq sauce and finished them on the grill about 5 minutes per side. Excellent results!

Absolutely  perfect!
I choose to use a dry rub for the baking process. I wrap each rack individually and base the baking time on the total weight, which is usually 2 to 3 hours.

There is no other way to make ribs, this is the best!

Thank you!!!

This Recipie was all that everyone said it would be.   I hadn't made Baby Back Ribs in forever, and this was so very,  very easy!

I took the advice of others and when the ribs were finished,  pulled them out of the foil,  sauced them again and broiled them on high 2-3 minutes..... Yes! Fall off the bone goodness!

5 stars for tender, falling off the bone spare ribs. I baked them in foil, with a dry rub on at 250 for 3 hours and 225 for another hour or 2. I then tried to pick them up w/ tongs to grill them for a bit to get them smoky.....they really were falling off the bone. I will only bake them for 3 hours next time at 250 degrees.....but they were unbelievably tender! And I did not peel the membrane off.....

Aside from adding a little salt and pepper, I followed the recipe and it is fantastic! These were easily the best ribs I've ever made and the recipe is ridiculously easy. I'll never make them another way. My family absolutely loved them. When they were done, I went to flip the ribs over so I could cut them up and I was left holding a bone in each hand. Utterly delicious! I wholeheartedly recommend this recipe. You will not be disappointed.

I used a little apple cider vinegar in the foil packets and followed one reviewer's suggestion to place the ribs under the broiler after putting on BBQ sauce to add flavor.  These ribs were very good and I'd make them again, but nothing beats smoked ribs on a real smoker.

Pretty darn good. Be sure to slather ribs with sauce before wrapping in aluminum foil. I wish I had added salt before cooking

This recipe truly had the meat falling off the bone! Baked at 300F for 2 hours 15 minutes, then opened the foil packets, slathered with more BBQ sauce, and broiled for 10 minutes. I reserved about 1/4 of the bottle for dipping when serving. Also, didn't have time to marinate overnight, so I marinated about 30minutes, and then put the straight into the oven -- still delicious!!

These were fall of the bone tender! Instead of putting the sauce on in the beginning, I just seasoned with a dry rub before sealing up the foil. After the 2.5 hours, I uncovered the ribs and put on the BBQ sauce. I turned up the oven temp to 450 degrees and cooked the ribs with sauce for another 20 minutes.

I love this way of cooking ribs, and I followed the advice of other commentators using a dry rub before cooking and then Adding sauce and broiling for a bit. To die for!

Best ribs ever! Looking for a homemade sauce to go with it, instead of Bull's Eye, which is still very good.

Excellent. I didn't even marinade prior to putting them in the oven! Made enough for 2 meals; first night didn't have time to broil with additional sauce, as some reviewers suggested... second night I did. They were both good but the additional broiling with sauce was definitely better. I will make these again... whole family loved them. YUM!!

Simply delicious!!! Couldn't have been easier. I actually made these while holding my two month old fussy baby. I did adopt a few of the recommended modifications found in other reviews. I removed the membrane and added a rub before the BBQ sauce, then did as the recipe instructed. Definitely making these again. My family loved it and licked their plates clean.

This is a great recipe. I read other reviews and after the ribs are done cooking, I remove them from their foil pouches, brush on more sauce on the meatier side, then broil them for about 5 minutes to make the outside crispy.  these ribs freeze well. I just put them in a freezer bag with some additional sauce so they can just be thawed and reheated.

This was a simple and easy recipe. As previous reviewers mentioned, I did use Cathy's rub beforehand. I let the ribs sit in the refrigerator overnight with the rub and then wrapped them in foil with the barbecue sauce for a few hours the next day. I actually cooked mine in the crockpot on low for 7 hours because I knew we wouldn't be home all day. I finished them off in the oven for about 10 minutes on 350 degrees and then about 4-5 minutes under the broiler.

I'm only giving 4 stars because I used most of the method, not the ingredients as written. I only had about 1 1/4 lbs. of back ribs for just me. Using reviewer Cathy M.'s recipe (wow, 10 years ago!) I made a rub of 2T. brown sugar, 2t. paprika, 1t black pepper, 1t kosher salt, 1/8t each garlic powder and onion powder, and a pinch of cayenne. I cut the rack in half and rubbed each half well, wrapped them in foil, and put them in a bowl and in the refrig. The next day at dinner time, I made up my own bbq sauce with what I had in the house.

I was a bit hesitant to make ribs, my mom is known for her ribs but she usually made country style ribs. She has unfortunately passed & no matter how I try I just can't seem to figure out her process & recipe. I figured I would try a different cut so I wouldn't completely be compared to her masterpiece! I came across this recipe and thought it seems too easy but the reviews were glowing so why not give it a go?!?  FANTASTIC!! Loved it, so easy! I took the other reviewers advice & applied Cathy M's dry rub, baked them at 300 degrees for 2 hours & then finished them in the broiler for 10 min with BBQ sauce slathered on them. Lastly, let them rest for 20 min! Rave reviews, everyone loved the ribs! Yah!!

This is a recipe that is designed to be simple and you have to accept it for what it is - simple. If you want to make a ton of changes to it like some of the reviewers have done then the simplicity is lost. It's an excellent recipe completely dependent upon what BBQ sauce you choose. I've experimented with various ones. The ribs always come out excellent and fall off the bone delicious. My guests always think I toiled away to make them. If you want a delicious rib recipe with little investment of time, this recipe is it. Yummy.

No need to marinade the ribs. Just brush on bbq sauce (I make homemade) cut one full rack of ribs in half and put in 2 separate foil wraps. Cover with sauce, bake at 300 for 2 1/2 hours. Remove from oven and foil. Put ribs on a baking sheet, recover with BBQ sauce and put back in oven for 15 minutes. So easy, delicious, fall of the bone ribs!

Best ribs ever!! Made about 4 lbs. of baby back ribs already cut into individual pieces with membrain removed. Made some changes. Used rub as suggested by Cathy  M. review for this recipe. Rub ribs & wrap tightly in foil. Place  in plastic bag in fridge to prevent leakage   Marinate ribs overnight with rub and baked with rub only. Baked foil packets on cookie sheet in oven  @ 300 for about 2 hours & 15 minutes. Let them sit for about half hour while preparing rest of meal. Lastly placed ribs on Pam sprayed foil lined baking sheet. Brushed them with Baby Rays original BBQ sauce ( our favorite ) and placed under low broiler for about 3 - 4 minutes on each side until carmelized. Tender & Delish!!!  First time ever to review a recipe. Had to because I was thrilled about how great they turned out. Love allrecipes.com.

Hard as I tried, I could not get the membrane off.  I cooked with it on - came out ok to me.  I used dry rub for the overnight marinate.  Cooked per recipe, then added BBQ sauce and broiled for a few minutes.  Very easy.

I've used this recipe a few times and each time the ribs are tender, juicy and fall off the bone. A very easy way to remove the membrane is to take a butter knife,work it under the membrane at one end once you have enough to get a good grip on the membrane use pull it off. This will help to make them a little more tender. Also, if cooking these on your grill, place the foil with the bone on the grates; this will prevent the meat side from getting over cooked. I also move the ribs from the foil and brush fresh bb que sauce and return to the grill for 5 minutes on each side.

This is my new favourite way to make ribs. They become tender without falling to pieces the way they do when you boil them.

It's fine if you just marinate these for about an hour or so.

I made this with the dry rub for ribs placed on the ribs before the sweet baby ray's bbq sauce.  I placed in the fridge over night.  After roasting for 2 1/2 hrs, I drained the fluid, added more bbq sauce and broiled 7 minutes.  Wonderfully flavorful fall-apart ribs!  Couldn't be much easier or tastier!  Will make again for sure.

Really great way to cook ribs!  My husband said that they were the best he's ever had!  I did broil them for like 8 minutes to get that cooked bbq sauce on top.  Thank you for posting!

The family could not get enough of these. I did use a dry rub on two racks and just the sauce on the other two for some variety for the kids.  So juicy and tender and just melted in your mouth. Fell off the bone with every bite.
I cooked 1 hour at 350 and 2 hours at 300. I also cooked on the grill for 15 minutes while adding more BBQ sauce. It was a very easy prep. I will be fixing these again for sure!

Mmm, mmm good. I mean fall off the bone delicious. I did put on rub along with the sauce and let marinate for 1 day. I didn't change anything else about the recipe except for adding the rub. They came out perfect. This is my new way of doing ribs from now on. Thanks

These ribs were so easy to make and SO tasty! We use Sweet Baby Ray's sauce because it is gluten free. I followed the recipe and made sure to put on baking sheet with rim in case of some leakage. I did end with broiling on low for extra 15 minutes. They looked like they were being served in a restaurant. This recipe seems too good to be true, but it's not!

Followed other reveiws after I cooked the ribs in the oven I let them sit about 2 hours in the foil and then put them on the grill with more sauce til they carmelized up a bit.  They where falloff the bone absolutely delicious. My family said they where better then the restaurants. I used famous Daves barbecue sauce.

My family loved these ribs and it couldn't have been easier.  I have tried for years to make ribs that the family would love - tried the slow cooker, the grill, etc.  These were so easy and effortless.  They were a big hit!

My family and I loved the end results!!  I seasoned the ribs with spices and the sauce and let it marinate overnight.  I baked it for 2 hours and added more sauce and baked it for 15 more mins.  I will definitely be using this recipte again.

This is a great recipe. I messed up. I bought regular back ribs instead of baby backs. They have a lot more meat. I baked for 2 hours and they were nowhere near done I baked another 30 minutes but that didn't help much so I just went ahead and threw them on the outdoor grill and finished them off because my son and I were hungry and did not want to wait longer. They weren't falling off the bone but they were very good. I used Emeril's Rib Rub and did not put the sauce on until on the grill. I think next time I will still use back ribs I like the extra meat but will cook for 4 hours and maybe use the tin foil tent method. Also, next time I will set them out for an hour to get room temperature.

I've LOVED bbq baby back ribs all my life.. but these were honestly THE worst ribs I've ever tasted.  Recipe so easy, and many great reviews.  Had to give it a try.  Smelled wonderful while cooking, meat fell off the bone… BUT flavor was hideous, completely bland boiled meat with watered-down bbq sauce.

While I haven't tried THIS recipe yet I think I would put them on the grill for 5 or 10 minutes after they were done. The recipe I find great is put the ribs on a rack in the oven with your favorite BBQ sauce. Place some rub in an inch or so of water and tent them with foil and back at 250 for 2 1/2 hours. Remove from oven, add more BBQ sauce and put them on the grill as above. Fall off the bone, finger lickin good!!!!! Enjoy!!! PS: You can also use a rub on them if you don't like BBQ sauce. YUM!!!

These were the best ribs i ever made. I put a dry rub on them and wrapped them in foil.  I cooked them ahead of time let them cool and then refrigerated.  I put bbq sauce then put them under the broiler for 20 minutes. FALL OFF THE BONE!!!!!!!!!!!!

I modified this recipe quite a bit, since it is a base and I couldn’t find my original recipe. Actually used bits of several recipes from the site.
For marination, I basted the ribs with liquid smoke,  worcestershire and apple sauce. Then used 2 packs of Grill Mates marinade packs (very spicy) for a dry rub and marinated overnight in foil.
I didn’t use any pre-made barbeque sauce. Instead I made my own using the Applesauce Barbeque Sauce recipe from this site and excluded the lemon juice since I didn’t have any.
Took the ribs out of fridge for an hour and then cooked theM in the oven at 225 for 3 hours. Turned up to 250, basted and cooked for 15 minutes on each side. Got internal temp to 140. They did fall off the bone. One piece fell on the floor as I turned it over, so I was required to eat those, per kid demand. The 5 second rule applied here. Took them out and set the broiler (550), basted and put them in for 5 minutes. Basted again and turned over, broiling for another 5 minutes…Broiling makes the sauce stick to the ribs. The spicy dry rub and the sweet sauce gives the ribs a moderately sweet and spicy taste without either overpowering.
Delicioso! I have the pickiest ADHD kids in the world and they devoured a whole slab by themselves, quietly!

The method behind this is excellent. If you are new to making ribs try this first to build your confidence. Then move on to putting a dry rub on your ribs and refrigerating overnight before cooking. There are several great dry rub recipes on this site. Also this recipe doesn't address removing the membrane. If you want your ribs to really absorb a rub or sauce you must do this.

I do my ribs a little different. I never wrap them when cooking. I rub them and refrigerate over night. Line a baking sheet with foil and oil down a little. Bake them a half hour at 300 degrees.lower oven to 250 degrees. load ribs up with sweet baby rays sauce you don't want to see the meat. Bake for about 3 to 3 1/2 hours loading more sauce on every half hour or so. I have been doing them this way for years. I bring these to many functions, they call me the rib man.

Very easy recipe and very tender ribs that easily come off the bone, however the barbecue sauce pretty much boils off as it bakes. Next time I would probably bake for 2 to 2 1/2 hours wrapped as said but the last 15 to 20 min I would uncover cover with barbecue sauce and bake so the sauce can kind of caramelize on the ribs

This is a great method and so simple.  Adding seasoning of choice and broiling for about 5 minutes at the end is a must!!

Used dry run as the marinade for only a couple of hours. Cooked in the oven then put on the grill with bbq sauce to get a nice sticky consistency to the sauce and nice black grill marks. Fall off the bone, tasty!

Very easy recipe. My husband and I added some smoked garlic cloves and 1 teaspoon of "bbq smoke" flavor enhancer and the ribs were a hit! Totally tasted and smelled like we slaved all day on them but really it only took 10 mins to prep. We also let ours rest over night in the sauce. This is a great recipe, also good with chicken.

So tender & yummy! I would never have thought making ribs could be so easy! I was a little skeptical but I decided to try it because of all the positive reviews.  I forgot to marinate so I put a bunch of cuts in the ribs and then lathered on the sauce and they still turned out great.  Next time I'm going to try the dry rub thing.  Everyone loved these. Thanks for sharing!

My husband loved these. I tweaked it because he was running late--after reading some of the reviews here-- I turned the oven down to 220F so they'd cook slower. And. I always brown my meat stovetop for at least 10 minutes.  First time, I've cooked ribs at so low temp-- I'm a believer.

I followed others suggestions and did the dry rub instead of the BBQ sauce before and during the baking.  Finished the ribs off on the grill also, with the BBQ sauce as suggested by other reviewers.  My husband said they were very good!

I use this as my EASY foolproof rib recipe. Wrap in the morning before work, come home and put them in oven. I line my pan with heavy duty tin foil and seal around the ribs. Put in pan in the morning, pop in oven in the afternoon. All in on pan for easy cleanup.  Yum.

I made this recipe in the oven the first time and it was good took a long time to make so really had to plan ahead, and did finish on the grill.  The second time I made it in the pressure cooker.  Put the rack in the PC on high for 17 minutes with 1 cup of water, remove and put on cookie sheet put sauce on and put on grill ... was awesome... fall off the bone.... start to finish 35 minutes.

I made these for my girlfriend and she claims they are the best ribs she's ever had. I did include Cathy M.'s famous rub on the ribs. They turned out quite spicy and the broil with the sauce makes them sticky, neither of which I like, but both of which my girlfriend loves, so that means I'll be making them her way every time. They turn out super tender, in fact her only complaint is that they actually fall off the bone to the point where you grab a rib and pull and all you get is bone. My friend joked about this being how they make the McRibs without any ribs. I've tried without marinating in advance and the flavor just doesn't sink in very well, but delicious nonetheless. On some occasions I've also used the more cost affordable spare ribs instead of baby backs and they still turn out great without any change in the recipe. This has become one of my staple recipes when I'm looking to impress someone.

This recipe is fantastic as well as easy. I've given it to my sister-in-law as well as friends. They love it too! If you don't have time to refirgerate overnight, the recipe still works very well. Brush with sauce, wrap tightly, put in oven. Fall of the bone, finger lickien good!

Delicious! I followed the suggestion by Katy M & just used Emeril's rib rub before wrapping & marinating overnight. Two hours @ 300 degrees, let stand for about 45 minutes, grilled with charcoal & wood chips for 10 minutes, they were fantastic! I'll be these up against my so-called grill master in-law any day. Cole slaw & corn on the cob were my sides for a fabulous Father's Day meal!

Fast, easy, delicious. No need for time consuming marinating or double cooking.  With prep and cooking time, these were on the table in 1.5 hours and so tender they fell off the bone.  If you like spicy ribs, add some of your favorite spices.  Children will love these. Keep a spray bottle on hand for flare-ups.  I will use this recipe ALL the time!

Awesome ribs!!! I would have to agree with the dry rub mix by Cathy... it was delicious. Ribs don't get much easier than this!

Excellent and easy.  Finish on the grill if you want but they were juicy and falling off the bone.

The meat was super juicy and fell off the bone, but not too much to the point where you couldn’t pick it up. I broiled it to create a nice glaze otherwise it doesn’t look too appealing. Next time, I’ll try cooking it with a dry rub only and then putting on the sauce after to give it more flavor.

Definitely use the tips included in the most helpful reviews - I think they really made the difference. These ribs were excellent, comparable to restaurant-style - and I'm not a master chef.

These were amazing. Made my own BBQ sauce from scratch and marinated all night. Put in the oven and finished these on the grill for about 15 minutes. They were gone in a flash!

When you bite into the meat it just falls off the bone. But the barbecue sauce sticks to the foil. So you might as-well make it without the sauce. Then towards the end add the sauce without closing the foil up.

there isnt really a recipe for bbq sauce for these ribs.  but thanks for the instructions on how to cook it.  i did however find a recipie for a jack Daniels bbq sauce from their website and cooked the ribs kinda like this recipe. i didnt wrap it in the foil, that just took way to long and really didnt care for it. i marinaded it over nite with some montreal chicken spice and the JD sauce  baked it in a pan for 2.5 hours made more sauce and brushed it on the ribs while broiling it in the oven for about 15 minutes. watch very carefully when doing this.. i had a couple casualties.  i fed 2 hungry men and myself this way and we had the "econo-sized" pack of ribs. there was no left overs at all.  thanks for the reviews everyone.. it definitely helped.

Excellent!  Made these over the weekend using Cathy M.'s rub and Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce.  I baked them at 250 degrees for 2 hours and finished them off on the grill over low heat for about 10 to 15 minutes.  My brother-in-law, who prides himself on his ribs, loved them, went back for seconds and then asked me for the recipe.  Great recipe and great tips from the reviewers.  Thank you!  :)

I have thought long and hard about how to best described this recipe.  I personnaly used the BBQ Dry Rub found on this site but halve the salt (I truly love salt but found it to be too salty). I removed the membrane on the back of the ribs for extra tenderness.  I used my favourite BBQ sauce which after many different kinds and attempts, found the PC Chipotle and Beer to be the best.  For the rest, I followed the recipe to the T and everyone I have serve it to just goes crazy for it.  My ribs became famous through my circle of friends and even though I was tempted to take the credit, I made sure to give credit to this site.    I considered putting them on the BBQ for a few minutes but didn't see the point.  Why change something that is perfect.  If you find the sauce too runny after cooking, simply take them out of the package and put them into a Pyrex bowl and add a bit of BBQ sauce for extra stickyness...  Lastly, I served the ribs with the recipe Sangria Sangria from this site and Oh Mama Mia!!!  MMMmmmmm

This is the best way to make ribs. I used Sweet Baby Ray's bbq sauce. You can really use anything you want, dry or wet and these will come out great. Someone suggested to me to boil the meat and then put on grill but I did it this way as I didn't want to lose flavor of the meat. Excellent.

I made these last night for the 4th of July~ they were EXCELLENT!!! Literally fall off the bone absolutely yummy!!! The only thing I did different was sprinkle dry rub on before I poured the bbq sauce on. This is the way that I will make ribs from now on. THANK YOU! I honestly thought they were restaurant quality!

I agree with JED901. This is more of a method, than a recipe....but a great method that can be used in many ways. I prepared 3 racks for the 4th of July (yesterday)...my first time using this "method". I first just cut the membrane on the back between each bone (much easier);then wrapped each 1/2 rack in heavy foil with a little beer, some white onion pieces and Old Country Deli "Rib Round UP" (only available on line. Baked in oven at 300 for 3 hours. Brushed on Rays BBQ sauce (lightly) and  put on BBQ for 5 minutes each.  They disappeared upon serving.....the meat fell of of the bone and were the hit of the party.

It's best to use DOUBLE heavy duty foil and put on a cookie sheet or large pan before baking in oven.  Definitely the best way to fix ribs. Very tender!

I think if I make these again I would put them on the grill to finish them off after baking.  Also, sure wish I had read the reviews ahead of time and either used heavy duty foil or put a pan underneath them while in the oven.  I just spent half an hour last night scrubbing my oven.  These WILL leak!!  My husband and mother loved these, but I thought they were just OK.

The meat literally fell right off the bones.  I had no idea how to make ribs before.  People told me you needed to boil them 1st.  What a pain that would be.  This worked out perfectly.  Next time... I will use a pork spice rub & I will wait to put the BBQ sauce on until I open up the foil packets.  Then I will throw them on the grill for 15-20 minutes.  No mess:)  YUM!

The crowd went crazy for these, even the little kids.  We used Sweet Baby Ray's.  Hubby slightly prefers Scott Hibb's Whiskey Ribs from this site but this technique is super-simple and delicious.

Very simple recipe and easy to make.  I did not have time to marinate them as long as it said, but they still turned out good. I did follow other suggestions and broiled them for about 10 minutes to give them the crisper/restaurant texture.

This is very good. I did the dry rub that was posted by others, and it just made it even better.

I've been cooking ribs for like 20 years and I must say this was more then amazing. I mixed up my own dry rub, used Sweet baby ray's BBQ sauce because i was lazy " sorry "  I let the ribs sit in the fridge for 90 min before cooking, took them out of the foil after 2 1/2 hours and cooked with the oven grill for 10 min.  We we're 4 people eating and everyone was LOVING the ribs. My search for the best ribs is over. No wit's just about making different flavors :)  Thanks, Mike

WOW!! Thats all I can say -- These ribs were absoultey delicious. I followed the recipe but added a dry rub to season the ribs a little bit more. I added garlic powder,salt,pepper. I cooked them just as it says but then did take the advice of other reviews to add more BBQ sauce on towards the end and broil for about 15 minutes. They were soooo tasty I was very impressed :) Will def make them again!!

Perfect ribs! I did three racks cut into six portions, wrapping them in foil after rubbing with a brown sugar/cayenne pepper mixture. After letting the ribs refrigerate in the rub for a few hours, I baked them in the foil on a baking pan @ 300 for 2hrs 40mins. I unwrapped the packets, basted with Famous Dave's Sweet and Sassy sauce and broiled for about 6 minutes. Better than any restaurant!

Fantastic restaurant-quality ribs! I didn't have time to marinate them so I just brushed on the sauce and put them in the oven. At the very end I unwrapped them, brushed on more sauce and turned on the broiler for about 3 minutes to carmelize them.  They were amazing, tender, succulent, fall-off-the-bone deliciousness!!!  My whole family gobbled them up.

FABULOUS!!!!  Made these for New Year's Eve dinner and they turned out perfect.  As suggested by others, the only addition I made was to broil the ribs for a few minutes before serving, which made them just like from a resturant.  I will definitely make these again and again.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

Fantastic! I didn't get the chance to marinate these at all, but they were still great and fell right off the bone. I seasoned them to my own taste and used "Famous Dave's Rich & Sassy" BBQ sauce (THE best sauce EVER in my humble opinion) When they were done I placed them on a new sheet of foil, added more sauce and put them under the broiler for just under 10 min. I served them with baked beans, mashed red potatoes and cheddar biscuits... Heaven!

I registered just to say a big thank you to the person who posted this.  Cooking the ribs at 300 degrees in the tin foil is such an easy trick to reproduce that restaurant quality fall-off-the-bone tenderness that even I couldn't screw it up!  I pulled off the membrane on my ribs and basted both sides with bbq sauce.  I completely skipped the marination step so the tenderness of the meat is really due the cooking style.  Like others, I broiled the ribs meat side up with extra sauce on top after the ribs finished baking in the oven.  Thanks a million!

These ribs are excellent and so easy to make. Like previous reviewers, I put a brown sugar rub on the ribs, coat them with Sweet Baby Ray's, and let them sit overnight in foil. Then I bake them as the recipe calls for. I'll let them sit in the foil until I'm ready to grill them. Then I'll put them on the grill to get them hot and a little crispy, and I'll put more Sweet Baby Ray's on them.

Absolutely delicious!  The meat was falling off the bone and was so moist.  Would definetly recommend grilling for a few minutes with extra sauce to form the sticky crust.  Fabulous!

We make these ribs all the time and they are always pretty good.  I usually put rib rub on them first as suggested by others and marinate them at least overnight.  Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce is what I usually use.

My hisband gave this 5 stars! He and my daughter both really enjoyed these ribs (I'm vegetarian). Along with Sesame green beans (from this site) and baked potatoes, with beat and bake orange cake (also from AllRecipes), this was an easy on the cook, but still delicious dinner. Finished off on the BBQ for the ribs, for some crispness. Thanks so much.

We used the input for the rub with br sugar, etc.  We marinated it overnight with the rub.  Cooked 2 hours on 300 & then removed it from the foil & cooked 30 minutes with the bbq sauce, applying a few times.  We only used 1/4 bottle of the bbq sauce.  It was a little spicy at first but the rub added such amazing flavor to these.  I loved them & my daughter ate more than my husband & I. This is a keeper. I am so excited to have such a great recipe! YUM!

I used regular spareribs and made these in the crock pot *no foil*  after marinating overnight w/ reviewer Cathy M's dry rub and the BBQ sauce. I left them on low for about 3.5 hours and did a quick blast under the broiler w/ a fresh coast of BBQ sauce. 

They were awesome. My hubby's friend called me "Tony Romas". LOL

I've never attempted to prepare ribs before so I appreciate this simple yet highly successful recipe!  My husband and our guests loved the ribs.  I used Sweet Baby Rays BBQ Sauce (for the first time) as recommended by prior reviewers and it was an excellent choice.

I liked this, but I found the cooking time was not quite long enough to make the meat as tender as everyone else found it to be. Perhaps it was my oven... My ribs needed an hour more to really fall off the bone. Still, this was a great way to make oven ribs without a huge cleanup afterward!

These were fabulous. I used a rib rub for 2 1/2 hours, then poured on BBQ sauce for a half hour with foil open. My DH loves ribs on the smoker and likes them to be able to chew off the bone, but he enjoyed these, too. Sis loved them, too!

I gave this recipe 4 stars only because the foil pouches leaked in my oven causing a mess.  Otherwise the ribs were wonderful.  They were very tender and falling off the bone.  I put only Sylvia's rib rub on the spare ribs, wrapped them in heavy duty foil & marinaded for 5 hours in the fridge then placed the foil packs on the oven racks and cooked for 2 hours then unwrapped the ribs and placed then in a roasting pan and brushed each of them with KC Masterpiece bbq sauce and let them cook for 30 minutes uncovered.  Great technique. Thanks alot

Great recipe! My husband loved it. So easy. I marinated with the dry rub 3 hours and then added the barbecue sauce letting the ribs marinate another 2 hours. Will definitely use this recipe again.

These were really good!  I ended up doing a rub on the ribs along with the BBQ sauce over night.  We baked them in the oven for 2 hours and then uncovered them, added more sauce and broiled them.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ Sauce, but it was a little too sweet for our taste.  I'm going to have to try and find a BBQ sauce that's spicy.  My husband has requested to have these once a week.

I have been making this recipe for years.  The Tony Roma World Famous ribs from the Top secret restaurant recipes book. And the ribs always come out moist and delicious. I always cook them a short time on the grill after they come out of the oven and baste with more sauce. Yum.

Excellent recipe, it was simple to follow and the ribs turned out perfectly! I am a beginner when it comes to cooking... this was my first time trying to cook ribs so I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great. My husband loved them and I will be making these again for sure!

I tried this tonight because of the rave reviews. I have to say they did turn out well especially since this was my first time cooking ribs. The only thing I would change is maybe trying what someone else did is add more sauce and put them under the broiler. If you just cook in the foil and serve they are kind of bland, you definitely would have to add more sauce. But other than that they were very good. Maybe even take these out 15 min early and put on grill with more sauce, that might be good too!

Gave this 5 stars because it was so easy and good.  I used a gourmet BBQ sauce but I might try a Chicken and Rib sauce - think it could have been sweeter.  Watch carefully when under the broiler so that they don't burn.  Use your favourite BBQ sauce and this can't go wrong!

They were so juicy and tender! I wrapped them tight, cooked them for 4 hours at 225f and used Sweet Baby Ray's hickory and brown sugar bbq sauce. Everyone loved them and they were gone so quickly. No mess and they didn't leak one bit. Will make again and again!

This recipe was so easy, and so delicious. The meat fell right off the bone. I used a dry rub I bought at the grocery store, and applied that to bake only. I did not have time to let meat sit...so just put the rub on and baked as directed. I put on sauce for the last 5 minutes and broiled. You can experiment with different sauces....but this is a great recipe. Will make again and again.

Worked out great! I put salt, pepper and garlic powder on the ribs before I put the BBQ sauce on and it nice and tasty. I attempted to broil the ribs after it was cooked to make the sauce caramelize a bit, but the sauce and juices started to burn on the opened foil. Next time I'll take the ribs off the foil packet before broiling! Overall this is a great recipe for someone, like me, who has never cooked ribs before.

Yay! I TOO can make ribs now! these were great. I snagged a dry rub recipe from elsewhere on the site, and cooked them with just the rub, and broiled for 15 mins. w/ BBQ sauce at the end like another user had previously suggested. I love ribs, but never wanted to make them at home if i had to go through all the effort of par boiling, and waiting around for the grill to come to temperature, etc. But now i will certainly be making them more often because this was intensely easy! thank you!

Tried these last night, and they are the best ribs I have ever made at home.  I did take the suggestion from others and the last 10 min. I took the foil off, added more bbq sauce, and then broiled them for 10 min.  They came out perfect, and fell right off the bones.  I have tried other recipes that used a slow cooker, and they always turn out too greasy.  These turned out perfect!!

These are the best... I don't eat ribs myself, but everytime I make these I get tons of compliments.  People love how tender they are, and I use the whiskey bbq sauce on this site, and everyone loves the sauce too.  Everyone thinks I'm a pro at making ribs!  Thanks for the recipe!!!

I have made this several times and my family loves it. I add bbq rub and then the sweet baby ray's. I have made them with one hour notice and I have also let them sit in the fridge marinating overnight. (like I am tonight!!) Just a note for the skeptics...my 5 year old daughter will not even eat chicken and she runs around telling everyone she ate 5 "bones". That's what she calls each rib! Awesome recipe.

This was my first attempt at making bbq ribs, as I always thought they would be to time consuming to make as many recipes say to boil the ribs. These were so EASY EASY EASY!! The only thing I put on them was a no name barbeque sauce from my local supermarket and marinated the ribs for 3 hours (as it was a last minute idea). I put them right from the fridge into a roasting pan lined with tin foil (just in case they leaked a bit....which they did). Cooked them as suggested for 2 1/2 hours at 300degrees. The meat was so tender that it just fell off the bones!  My son couldn't beleive that Mom made them!! These were so YUMMY !!

This method is the best way to cook homemade ribs. Loved the "no mess- clean up".  The meat was so tender that it fell off the bone.  My husband who is a grill master also prefers this method.  Who'd of thought something this simple could make ribs so great.  Thanks!

Fall off the bone tender. So GOOD!!! Just be careful not to let the juices ooze out of the foil while baking. You will be left with a very dry rib. I also tried Cathy's dry rub...really nice flavors.

absolutely love, love, love this recipe.
Could not be any easier and you have the option of customizing with your own sauce or purchased one. I personally am addicted to sweet baby rays, and have done them three times now in that sauce and it is fabulous! I will try to throw them on the grill next time and try that to see how it goes. Thanks for a great recipe!!!

Others are right -- the meat DOES just fall right off the bone.  I think I'll keep this recipe to try again one night when I can throw the ribs on the grill for a bit.  That might make this recipe 5 stars for my family!  I think we just prefer the smoky flavor and slightly drier texture when they come from the grill or smoker.  However, I made this for my neighbors and they loved them!

Wow!  Surprisingly good.  I used a reviewer's suggestion and marinated with a dry rub for 48 hours.  To cook, I wrapped them in the non-stick aluminum foil and added a little of our favorite BBQ sauce (Head Country original).  My family groaned about cooking the ribs in the oven until I told them I planned to "finish" them on the grill.  That did the trick.  The ribs were already quite tender from slow cooking in the oven, but 10 minutes on the grill while basting with more BBQ sauce made them just slightly crisp on the outside and tangy from the BBQ sauce.  I will make them again!  Oh, and they're great with the Roasted Red New Potatoes...recipe found here on allrecipes.com.

The best!
since trying ribs in the usa for the first time 7 years ago and 2 other times we visited I wanted to cook them my self but could not do it.  Until i found your web page.  There are not many restaurants in england that serve them and when you do find them they cost about 30-35 dollars per rack.  So bravo and many thanks!

I made these the first time by following the recipe exactly, and the ribs were quite good. I did brush  more BBQ sauce on the ribs at serving time. I'll make this recipe again and again, and will try some of the suggestions.

This is very good as is if you like to enjoy the taste of the meat and BBQ sauce.  My husband loves it like this.  I also have enjoyed experimenting with a few different rubs.  As one reviewer suggested, leaving them in the fridge for 2 or 3 days with a rub on them makes them wonderful.  Thanks for the great cooking method!!

This is a great, no hassle way to make fall off the bone ribs. Make sure you use a top quality barbecue sauce.  I tried to use up a bottle of Kraft on one serving and it was amazing how watery it was.

I certainly love a good rack of ribs, and this recipe did not disappoint.

I have a few rubs that I plan on trying out with this recipe.

Will be making again for sure!

Fall off the bone good! This recipe is definitely a keeper! It would be great to throw them on the grill after cooking for that grilled taste in the summer too!

I was very nervous making baby back ribs, but i have made this recipe twice now and it is definitely a winner. I do marinade the ribs with sweet baby rays bbq sauce all night. Follow the cooking recipe and they fall right off the bone.

A++++I put a dry rub on the ribs before coating w/ sauce.  I baked for approx 2 1/2 hrs, uncovered, basted again and broiled for 8-10 min to make them sticky.  Yum, yum, yum!

We all agreed they were the best ribs we ever had. Make sure to put them on the grill for a few minutes per side. The sauce that we used is Stubbs - original. Outstanding!

These were awesome.  Impossible to screw up this recipe.  Easiest recipe ever.  I baked in a large casserole dish b/c we ran out of foil, so I was worried these wouldn't taste as good, but I was so wrong.  Can't wait to try them next time marinated all night and wrapped in foil.  The family loved this.  And, I'm from Kansas City where we know BBQ!

I have never fixed my own ribs before finding this recipe. I have to say this is about as easy as it gets and turned out better than I've had at most restaurants! I used Jack Daniels BBQ sauce and it was delicious. This will be a new regular dish at my house! Thanks!

This was just as good as restaurant-ribs.  I followed the recipe exactly, but then after baking the ribs, I coated them with another layer of BBQ sauce and threw them on the grill for maybe 10 minutes--just enough to get the BBQ  smoky taste.  They were awesome!  I will be making this for friends!

Yep. The meat fell off the bone! To use a regular BBQ sauce was ok. And, the broiling / grilling carmelized the sauce really nicely on the ribs. The slow roast process was the best method I have used. But, when I use the process next time for the ribs, I am using the Korean Chicken BBQ Marinade (allrecipes.com). That should be Killer Ribs!

I'm not a rib fan and this converted me.  Excellent flavor.  Reccomend sautéing over night for enhanced flavor.  Steamed vegetables are a great side.

Perfect!

Marniated in KC masterpiece original BBQ sauce, I too put them on a baking pan tightly covered with heavy foil. Baked at 275 for 4 hours! Then uncover, add a little more sauce, broil for 5 minutes and oh my family thinks I'm a gourmet chef!

Yeah! This is the recipe we have been looking for! The meat really does fall off the bone. I think it is really important to put them on the grill or uncovered in the oven at the end to make them crispy though.

Amazingly good! Used KC Masterpiece Hickory brown sugar bbq to marinate. Then blasted after 2hrs with a copycat jack daniels teriyaki sauce. Once done I blasted again, then broiled for 2-3 minutes for color and smokey flavor. Sooo good and tender, my DH loves it too! Thanks!

Killer Ribs!!  Agree with adding spices or a dry rub in addition to the sauce and crisping on the grill after oven baking.  YUM! Will never use another recipe for ribs!

My husband, a rib lover, didn't think this could be done at home without a pressure cooker.  This is the recipe, the ribs are absolutely awesome.  We do crisp them up on the grill after ovenbaking...soooo good.

Best ribs ever!!! Rubbed garlic powder and salt and pepper on the ribs before marinating in Head Country BBQ sauce over night.  Also put on grill for 5-10 minutes on each side and added BBQ sauce.  These were the best ribs ever!! Thanks for this great recipe!

I made 2 full racks of ribs, cut each rack in half, basted with BBQ sauce, placed them in foil pouches and let them marinate overnight in the fridge.  I then baked them in a 300° oven for 2 hours.  The foil pouches puffed up nicely while they were cooking.  I removed the ribs, basted with more BBQ sauce and then refrigerated overnight.  The next evening my husband grilled them over coals for about 10 minutes to heat them and crisp them up on the outside.  He basted with more sauce too.  Everyone loved them!  My 13 year old son raved that this was his new favorite meal.  The meat in my opinion was a little dry, I would have like them to be a bit juicier, but the flavor was terrific, and pre-cooking them in the oven made them very tender.  The meat came off the bone very easily but didn’t fall off the bones so it was just right.  Next time I make these I think I will bake them for 2 hours at 200° instead of 300°.  Hopefully they will be a bit moister on the inside next time.  Overall they were OUTSTANDING!  Just have to figure out how to keep them a little moister.  I’m open for suggestions.

Excellant!  I have shared this recipe with a number of friends and they love it.  I put the ribs on a cookie sheet in the refrigerator, take them out and put them in the oven on the sheet.  Clean up is a snap.

Came out perfect!  Meat fell off the bone. They should change the servings though because what should have been enough for 4 turned into enough for two because how good they were!

This recipe was wonderful. I used it on fathers day and my husband loved it. It was so easy that I made BBQ boneless chicken breast the same way and it turned perfect also.

These were so easy and so delicious.  I had no idea how to remove the membrane, but there are many helpful websites that show just how to do it. The secret is to use paper towel.  Anyway, I also baked them at 250 for 4 hours and broiled them a few minutes at the end.  They really just fell off the bone.  Absolutely amazing!

Made it twice.  It's almost no work and almost foolproof, but it tastes great!  I will soon try it with home made sauce.

These ribs were better than those we go to a pricy restaurant for. I used a bbq/
chipotle sauce to marinate them in.
Thanks Ken!

My fiancee, whose brother used to cook at a rib place, quickly declared these the best ribs he's ever tasted!  I put a little dry rub on before the BBQ sauce, and popped the ribs under the broiler for a couple minutes at the end for that sticky texture on top.  MMMMMMMMGOOD!  Thanks, Ken, for an awesome recipe that will be used frequently in my house!

Super duper easy...everyone asked me if I boiled prior to baking and I could honestly say this was a 1 step recipe. I did rub a combo of salt/pepper/garlic powder prior to brushing on the sauce. Also, if you plan to broil both sides of the rack, cut the rack into quarters since I left my rack whole and it was difficult to flip the rack over since the meat was cooked to the point of falling off.

MMmmmm mmmmm good.  Fell completely off the bones.  2-1/2 hrs. was perfect. I marinated overnight in Jack Daniels Original BBQ sauce.  Fantastic!  I added more sauce at the end. Meat fell off the bone.

Fantastic recipe!  Easy, simple cleanup, and they really do fall off the bone.  I use Cattlemans Honey barbeque sauce.  I used a lesser quality of ribs on my second attempt.  They didn't turn out as good so splurge and don't buy the mega pack that's on sale!

This is the easiest recipe with no mess.  The key is finding a barbecue sauce you love.  Definitely wrap each section of the ribs rather than trying to do a whole rack together.  I do think that makes a huge difference.

I agree with another reviewer.  I made exactly as stated with just the two ingredients and was not impressed at all.  They were very tender, but when you open the foil up, the sauce becomes quite thin and watery.  Ended up having to add a ton more sauce and then broil the ribs.  I guess we prefer grilling ribs.  Sorry

This is my first time making ribs, I did follow other suggestions and used a dry rub the night before and I put them under the broiler for about 8 minutes to give them a nice crust I also had spare ribs instead of baby-back so I think they could have baked just a little longer.  This was a super easy recipe for some really great ribs...thanks so much

This was delicious~!  I did use meat rub before the bbq sauce.  Be sure to wrap tightly so that juices do not all drip out into the oven.  I made that mistake and ended up with a smoking kitchen, but the taste was great!  I also finished it off with more bbq sauce and broiling both sides to get the nice "crust".

Finishing on the grill is a MUST to get that crust formed from the flames.  Would be mushy without a few minutes on grill.  Ribs were wonderful!

I've probably been responsible for the slaugter of a herd of cattle trying to find a good rib reciepe but this is the one. Talk about tender mmmm, mmmm good. I used Denise Smith's dry rub reciepe for the oven cooking and threw BBQ sauce on them when I put them on the grill for a few minutes. GREAT!

Finally, a recipe for Ribs, thats so easy to prepare that comes out perfect everytime!  Only thing I changed was I used "Reynolds Oven Bags" that made clean up a breeze.  Every time I make these I am aways asked, "what is your secret recipe?"  When I tell everyone they are amazed by saying "is that all you have to do?" :)  Thanks so much Ken for sharing this perfect rib recipe!

These are by far the BEST ribs I've ever made.  I made them for my son's birthday party and they were a hit. I misread the instructions (since I was preparing sooo much food)and I put the BBQ sauce on right before they went in the oven and they still turned out wonderful!  I followed other's suggestions and put on a dry rub on first and used Baby Ray's BBQ sauce.  Thanks Ken for such a great and easy recipe!!

Soooo easy!! I used the Dry Rub for Ribs recipe by Denise Smith, as suggested by a previous reviewer, and the Sweet Baby Rays sauce. My husband gave rave reviews and said the ribs were better than his favorite rib place. Thanks for sharing Ken!

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!!  I made this recipe for the Fourth of July BBQ.  I started the ribs in the oven for a couple hours, then finished them on the BBQ to brown up a little bit.  The meat fell off the bone.  Everyone loved them.  A success!!

THESE WERE AWESOME!!!  The only thing is that the cooking spray should be added to the ingredients list b/c I didn't have any...luckily, I had vegetable oil and used that.  They fell off of the bone before they even hit my plate!

easy to make this way but I only marinated about an hour so the ribs lacked flavor. I had to brush with sauce in the end and broil for about 2 minutes

These were really good. They did everything the recipe and reviews said they would do. I used the Sweet Baby Rays and did a half-assed dry rub.
I had always been scared to make ribs--too complicated. Not these. I broiled them a couple minutes (I left the tin foil on, folded back, but the smoke alarm went off so i had to stop). Next time I will do more of an effort with the rub and maybe add some crushed red pepper for some kick. Thanks a lot.

This was so easy. No basting, just let it bake. The meat came out so tender and had so much flavor. The tricky part was taking off the foil. I will make this again, Yumm!!!

I've never even attempted ribs before and thought I'd give this recipe a try.  My in-laws came over to try it out w/us and the ribs were a resounding success!  I'm still getting compliments on it!  This is the EASIEST way I've ever heard of for making ribs.

What a find--the best ribs around, from your own kitchen!  The only flaw (and it's pretty minor) is that one has to plan these at least a day ahead, to allow for proper marinading.  Otherwise, this is as easy a recipe as they come.  Who knew that ribs these good could be made at home?

Excellent! Five stars all the way. I added a rub before I put the bbq on, but I don't think that's why they were so good. The bones were falling off of the ribs as I moved them from foil to plate. Yummy.

My b/f loved it. I think one can easily adjust the taste by picking one's favorite BBQ sauce. Easy to make, not much preparation. Will definitely make it again.

Thank you Ken!  I was always hesitant about cooking ribs at home.  This recipe definitely changed my mind.  Very convenient, (prepared packages at night) baked after returning home from work.  These ribs were very tender and delicious.

The prep work was a breeze - My only issue is that it really didnt have as much flavor as I would have liked - Next time I will try basting them one more time at the end and then putting them under the broiler for a few minutes.  Very tender worth another try.

This is a great alternative to grilling.  My husband and I loved them.  When they were done baking I put more BBQ sauce on and put them under the broiler until the sauce started to carmelize.  This is one recipe that will be used over and over again.

These ribs were perfect! To lend a bit of a "grilled outside" flavor I sprinkled the meat with a hickory smoke salt before covering with the bbq sauce. The flavor was excellent! My toddler even loved them! The leftovers even withstood being reheated in the microwave the next day without being rubbery! My husband has requested that this become a regular around our household.

Meat turns out a bit too tender. A shortened cooking time combined with five minutes under a broiler before serving makes them more crispy, like restaurant style ribs.

Why work any harder than you have to?  This recipe is as easy as it gets and incredibly tasty...especially if you make your own favorite barbeque sauce and use it liberally.  These ribs are excellent grilled or in the oven!

All I have to say is DELICIOUS!  This is also so simple.  I followed the advice of one reviewer and rubbed the ribs with cajun spices first and put everything in a slow cooker for a few hours.  I had tried bbq ribs before (on the grill), but they have never been as tender as this!  Next time, I will try to find a homemade bbq sauce to see if it makes the recipe even better!

Delicious!  I made the recipe even easier by eliminating the tin foil.  I rubbed the ribs down with my favorite cajun spice mix, salt and pepper.  Then I placed them directly in the slow cooker and coated them with BBQ sauce and cooked on low all day.  They were fabulous!  The cooker pot was no problem to clean either.
