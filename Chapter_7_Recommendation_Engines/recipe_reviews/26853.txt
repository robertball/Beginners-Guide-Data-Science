Hard to find the soup, but well worth it when you do find it!

Made this one night for my bunko group and they loved it.  It's easy and you can add anything you want to it and make it a little different each time.

The only chili beef soup I could find was a store brand and although it tasted okay, it made the dip too thin in my opinion. I think canned chili  with beans would work better for this and it is easier to find. Overall great flavor though and one that wouldn't stick around long at a football party. Next time I will add jalapeno's for some heat.
