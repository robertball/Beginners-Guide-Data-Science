Thanks to previous reviewers, I knew ahead of time that this recipe needed some doctoring.  So I skipped the butter and browned the ground beef with onions, twice the garlic, and some chopped green pepper.  I didn't have mushrooms, so I added corn instead, plus a healthy amount of oregano, salt, and pepper.  I covered the skillet with cheddar right before serving, and it came out great.  Even my three-year-old ate it without any complaints.  We will definitely be doing this again.

Easy and decent leftovers. I added some chopped green pepper into the mix as well and it reminded me of the best part of stuffed green peppers -- the filling! Nice recipe base to tailor to your tastes with spices. Thanks!

This is soooo delicious. Pretty easy to make also. I didn't expect much out of this dish by the name, but it is surprisingly good. I recommend this dish to anyone.

I just don't get it; this was not tasty at all; very lifeless.  I even used half spaghetti sauce, oregeno, doubled the garlic and added corn instead of mushrooms.  There's no way around it... I wouldn't make it again.  

If you want a really good, crowd pleasing "rice mess" (we call it "tex-mex") just throw a can of your favorite chili in per cup of cooked rice.  You can add corn or green chiles or whatever.  Top it with cheddar and you're golden.  Easy.  Yummy. Serve tortilla chips on the side.

I think this recipe provides a good base, but like several of the previous reviews have stated: you have to add to this to really make it a great recipe. I didn't have fresh garlic on hand, so I used garlic powder instead to simmer with the onions in butter.  Next, I added the ground beef, chopped green/red peppers, a can of mushrooms, some peperoni slices, the cooked rice, 2 cans of tomato soup (I didn't have tomato sauce on hand either), and some water.  For seasonings, I added cumin, cajun seasoning, black pepper, salt, oregano, and italian seasoning. After simmering for a while, I added mozerella cheese instead of the cheddar (which was suggested by a previous reviewer). It was really delightful and my family of 6 really enjoyed it--there were no leftovers!!  Thanks to M.Bolt for sending this recipe in!

This is a quick and easy one pot meal.  I had left over rice, so mine was even easier.  I think if I make this again I will add a little italian seasoning to the mix and it was bland.  My 22 month old daughter liked it though.  I think it would also be good with a little chili power and cumin mixed in and substitute corn and black olives for the mushrooms to give it a mexican feel.

I really enjoy this recipe.  It is quick to make and usually I have all the ingredients on hand.  I do add a can of corn to this.  Fresh Italian bread goes great with this.  It is a good recipe to adjust to your families personal tastes.

This came out really good - 5 stars because even my step son who doesn't care for rice ate this without much complaining lol. I followed the recipe closely. I made it go further by making more rice (3c water & 1-1/2c brown basmati) and I had some grape tomatoes to use up so I chopped them up and added them to the ground beef mixture and that's my only changes, they're minor - just modifying the quantities of items in the recipe (chopped tomatoes and tomato sauce similar enough) and that worked well for us. We'll have this again.

My whole family liked it. I followed others suggestions to spice up the meat a bit with more garlic & some herbs.  I switched the mushrooms for corn b/c my kids don't like mushrooms.  I used shredded cheddar cheese instead of sliced.

This is a simple and solid recipe; there is little 'wow' factor but it is tasty and easy to make. I used mozzarella cheese, omitted the mushrooms, and used seasoned spaghetti sauce--the amount prescribed by the recipe was fine-- and everyone in my very picky family ate it (probably because the taste is fairly nondescript). There is no need to remove the onion and garlic once sauted, however, you can just dump the beef in with it. As another reviewer said, cumin and oregano were nice additions.

Already told DH that the next pot luck we have I am making this!

This is a great basic recipe to change up to suit your taste. I used corn instead of mushrooms and added cumin, oregano, twice as much garlic and chili powder. I topped it with cheddar/jack cheese mix and served it in a bowl with a dollop of sour cream. Big hit!

Great recipe that my children loved. I added a little crunch to it by sprinkling crushed fritos on top of their serving. Gives it the salty crunch its looking for.l

This is not a gourmet meal, but it gets five stars for how quick and easy it is to make and for the surprisingly good taste. I made some small changes to this recipe. I used garlic powder and minced onion and I added some chili powder, Cajun seasoning, and just a small bit of brown sugar. Then I sprinkled shredded cheese over the top. It turned out fantastic. My husband loved it.

This was a pretty well-named recipe. It was quick and filling and cheap and well-rounded, I guess, but it was just kind of blah. Nothing especially tasty. I made it exactly as written, using 93% lean ground beef, a small/medium yellow onion, and sliced "medium cheddar". For the mushrooms, I wasn't sure about can weight versus net (drained) weight, but I used 2 cans of 4oz. drained weight, and that didn't seem to be too much mushrooms. This does take a fairly big skillet. My skillet was getting full, so I transferred everything to a slightly larger pot, and continued to cook the "mess" on medium until the cheese melted a bit. It was good enough to gobble down for several dinners, but I probably won't be making this again.

This was pretty good for a meal I could whip up with ingredients on hand.  My hubby liked it more than I did, but I'd make it again.  I added a 1/2 tsp. of oregano & cumin as recommended.  I also used corn instead of mushrooms because we love corn.  Next time, I'll serve with hot, crusty bread to scoop it up.  It's a kid, friendly meal.

This got 3 stars because it was easy.  The taste was very bland, it is a good base meal if you need something fast and easy, but be sure to doctor it up with something that will give a little more flavor.

Vaguely reminds me of sloppy joes but it is a good and quick lunch!! I added a TBLS of brown sugar when adding the tomato sauce and would make this again. Serve with veggies and dip and you have yourself a meal! Thanks M. Bolt for sharing.

Was Really good, but, as others said, needs a little more doctoring. Will be looking forward to trying it again.

This was simplistic and very tasty.  I used brown rice instead of white, and adjusted my cook time for the brown rice accordingly.  I made the rice and the meat in advance the night before so when I got home, all I had to do was heat everything and melt the cheese.  I doubled the garlic and omitted the mushrooms as the kids won't eat them.  Instead of using 
American cheese I covered it with one cup of shredded nacho cheese blend.  Everyone asked for seconds.  This would be a great make freezer make ahead meal or a potluck meal.  You could even use this as a 'stretcher' for taco meat by replacing the tomato sauce with salsa.  The options are endless!

I love this recipe!  Perfect for a busy weeknight when you have no ideas and no time for dinner.  I just added a little basil and oregano and 3 cloves of garlic for more flavor.  I used rice cheese for my daughters and they loved it.

Great recipe, however I ended up making some changes. First of all, using oil instead of butter will reduce the amount of cholesterol and fat, plus in my opinion it tastes better. Also, I added red bell peppers to the recipe. Instead of tomato juice, I used chili ready tomatoes. After adding in the rice and tomatoes, I suggest adding some spices (parsley, thyme, and my personal favorite Mrs. Dash!). After all that, cover, reduce heat, and allow to simmer for about 15 min. This allows the beef and rice to absorb the spices. In the end you can use cheese, but you can also serve with sour cream on the side.

I thought this was really good taking into consiration how easy it was to make and handiness of ingredients.  I used corn because we didn't have mushrooms and added about 1/2 tsp oregano and 1/2 tsp cumin.  Turned out very well and quick and easy to make.

I like ground beef and tomato products but this recipe just does not taste good.  Before I put the rice in, I tasted the sauce and it had no flavor so I wound up trying to doctor it up with whatever spices I had on hand.  No one in my family of 5 was able to get past the second bite.  We had sandwiches for dinner tonight instead.  If you really want to try this, I suggest going with a pre-made spagetti sauce...at least that has some flavor.  Of course, it might be better to just try something else.  There are a lot of good recipes on this web site.

This is a basic recipe.  I added a can of diced Italian tomatoes for more flavor.  Also a cup of shredded mozarella.  Grated cheddar on top.  Might be better with more tomatoes since the rice absorbs all the juice.  Good quick starter recipe that can be modified.

My husband and I had this tonight and we both loved it! I didn't make any radical changes - used shredded cheddar on top instead of slices. I used brown rice as I always do in rice recipes. I used a good couple  shakes of  kosher salt and ground peppercorn. In some reviews - the cooks used spaghetti sauce . I stuck with the tomato sauce and it cake out perfectly. I made Caesar salad and crusty cheese bread for the sides, YUM!

I agree this is the base for something really good but as is it is just beef with spaghetti sauce and rice instead of noodles. I added extra cheese and the 3 year old enjoyed it but I dont think I will make it again.

It was ok.  I did add 2 cloves of garlic instead of 1 and also added some herbs to the meat (some thyme, oregano, etc...).  It just needs something else.  My husband requested that it not be added to the regular line up.

I loved it! It was super easy to make and tasted great. I added cumin and oregano as suggested, plus a little garlic powder in addition to the garlic. I also added 1/2 can of chopped tomatoes and chopped green pepper (omited the mushrooms). I also added a bit of Italian blend shredded cheese in addition to the cheddar. My husband loved it and we had plenty for leftover lunches. Thx!

The taste of this dish was unremarkable.  It was cheap and filling, but it just didn't have much else to offer.  I tried adding chopped bell peppers, 8 more ounces of tomato sauce, and a bunch of extra cheese, but even that couldn't redeem it.  I won't be making this again.

I know this isn't an elegant dish, but my husband and I absolutely love it. I do add a bit more tomato sauce since the rice soaks it up and I make my rice using the rice cooker (I find that it comes out softer this way). I also use mozzarella cheese mixed in the dish and add shredded cheddar cheese on top. Maybe not a "dinner party" recipe, we sure love it!

My whole family of picky eaters liked this recipe, including the older kids (3,5, and 10 yo).  I followed the directions to the letter, except when it came to the garlic.  I was out of fresh, so used powdered.

I found this by doing an ingredient search...my kitchen was basically bare and I had been shut in by an ice storm for 4 days.  We were so suprised that something so seemingly basic would be so good!  
Definitely doing this one over...and not waiting for more ice!

This didn't go over big time.  The comments were it was like a cross between chili and spaghetti, but did not really taste like either one.

This was so easy and sooo delicious!!  I used Mozzerella cheese insead of cheddar, because I couldn't imagine cheddar tasting good in this dish, and the mozzerella was just the perfect blend of flavor.  This tasted even better the next day.  It was a cheap and easy and very filling dinner, I will definatly be making this again!!!

This is the quickest meal I make - and my husband does not get tired of it. The cheese makes it taste special - so even though you're tempted, don't leave it off!

Bit boring but quick, easy and affordable. Everyone ate it without complaints and I think the leftovers(as it does make alot) would make an extrodinary cabbage roll filling!

This was about how it sounds.  I am not real excited about it but will probably make it again.  It makes a lot, it's cheap and easy.  It is edible.
