Spicy Chicken Broccoli Casserole w/ Fresh Arugula Haiku: "This was WAY more prep, and the end result was odd. And not enough sauce." I didn't deviate from the ingredient list or instructions other than using a small can of organic Costco mushrooms rather than the fresh that I didn't (but wish I had) have on-hand. That little swap saved me a bit of time, but wow, the prep, chopping and hands-on time for this recipe was much more than the 20 min. listed. My husband and I agreed that it was a very peculiar "casserole" that needed ... not sure; time in the oven? Mixed w/ rice or quinoa? But no question about it, it needed more sauce. (Very dry!) It was an unusual combination of veggies and the arugula, that we love, seemed like a garnish. Other than the kick from the two types of peppers, there wasn't a whole lot of taste, so coupled w/ the effort, I'd have to change way too much in order to make this again.

This was delicious. I used oil for the roux and cut back on that a bit.. an used a jalapeno pepper because I am a wimp. Tios doesn't make much sauce so if you like it saucy... make more. For me it was fine..a very light coating of sauce that is pretty much absorbed into the broccoli. Next time I will use panko crumbs on top.. was out this time

I created this meal the other day and I really enjoyed the outcome.   The recipe does take about an hour or so all together but the end result was a tasty dish.  The only thing I think I'd do diffent when I make this again is I'm goign to make more sauce.  For some reason, when I followed the recipe I didn't get enought sauce.  I'm sure I did something incorrectly but it was a great meal.

It tasted OK, but this was FAR too much work for something to come out just OK.  I'm sure this was result of my novice cooking skills, but be aware, this one takes a bit of time if you're not a seasoned pro in the kitchen.
