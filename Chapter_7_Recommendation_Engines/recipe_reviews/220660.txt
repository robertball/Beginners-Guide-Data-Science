This was tasty! Made exactly as written...reminded me of 'artichoke chicken', w/o the chicken, of course, lol. This was rich, but not too heavy. I'll make this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Great! Fast, easy and very tasty. I have a dip recipe quite similar that is microwaved and served with Triscuits or other crackers. Love the French Bread addition and baked. Thanks for sharing.

My brunch guests LOVED this recipe.  I made the artichoke spread the night before, so the morning of my company I just had to spread it and bake it.  It's incredibly delicious, versatile, and next time I'm going to make a double recipe!

This is a super recipe.  Every time I make it is never enough.  It is always one of the first appetizer gone, and it is just wonderful.  I was surprised when someone said there was no zing.  The Parmesan should provide that zing. It is best served warm.  That is not a problem since is disappears so fast.  I have made it many times, and I have tried adding chicken, shrimp and many other things and it is still wonderful.  My favorite is the original recipe.  Yummy!

Took this to a party, but didn’t tell anyone what it was. Everyone loved it until they found out it was artichokes!  There were no leftovers though

This is a great way to have the best of both - artichoke dip and garlic bread.

I’d go a little heavier on the garlic next time, but overall it was an easy and good tasting recipe.

I've made this so many times, my family and friends just can't get enough. It's like a veggie pizza and is great with a side dish of pasta or just by itself.... Thanx for the recipe....

This is like the sandwich at Penn Station, only they use provolone rather than Parmesan. I make this out of frozen artichokes to put on my turkey sandwich. Going to try it with Parmesan.
