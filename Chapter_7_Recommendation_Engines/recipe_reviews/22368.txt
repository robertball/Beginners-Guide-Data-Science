If you like a big block of melted semi-sweet chocolate chips mixed with peanut butter chips, then you might like this.  I did not find this creamy or fudge like at all--more like melted chips turned into a big block.  I also added more of the peanut butter chips--but still it was nasty.  I won't be making this again.  May be easy, but not really fudge like!

Couldn't find Peanut Bits in Australia, so stirred in large dollop of unsalted peanut butter after removing from heat. Delicious and extremely more-ish.

Just ok.  Nothing special at all.  I didn't care for it, but my hubby said the people at work munched on it throughout the day.  Probably won't make again.

I just made this fudge and it was wonderful.  I do agree with some of the reviews that more peanut butter chips should be added.  Other then that the fudge taste wonderful and was creamy.

easy and very good. Except for the chilling time, this is a quick dessert. the failproof type that you can throw together quickly when you find that you have to have a dessert at the last moment.

Made this as a birthday gift for a chocolate lover and she absolutely loved it.  Very easy to make.  Will definitely make again, this time more of it to bring to the office.

The fudge came out beautifully.  Some reviewers said theirs came out hard, but when I made this recipe, it came out very soft and yummy.  The only change I made was that I added a spoonful of peanutbutter to the fudge as it was on the stovetop to give it a stronger peanut butter flavor.

Wonderful flavor and very easy to make. I stired the peanutbutter chips a bit too much and they melted a little too much but it was still a hit.

Creamy and dreamy...next time, I might add 2 cups of peanut butter chips but I'm a big peanut butter fan so that may not be for everybody.  YUM!

Very easy and quick to make.  Tastes really good, but it does get sticky rather quickly...must eat directly out of fridge.

Good recipe, quick and easy! I've had no complaints - other than when the last one has been eaten! The fudge is creamy, not dry at all. I also add some extra peanut butter chips to add a little more peanut butter flavour.

Rich and tasty.  On a whim, I coated the bottom of the pan with graham cracker pieces, and it turned out very well- a lot like s'mores.  Maybe I'll try to work marshmallows into the mix next time...
