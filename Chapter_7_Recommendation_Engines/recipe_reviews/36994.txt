My wife cooked this recipe last night for dinner.  She said it was very easy to make and relatively inexpensive.  I enjoyed this Ginger Salmon as a tasty alternative to grilled Salmon.  This recipe gave the Salmon a sweet, tangy flavor.  I also like the idea of incorporating Ginger into the recipe, since I heard Ginger helps in digestion.  I have seen those gnarled Ginger roots in the grocery store for years, wondering what people ever did with them.  This recipe makes excellent use of Ginger.

Excellent flavours.  I used a salmon steak and found I had to cook it 30 minutes.  The sauce got a bit stuck in the pan so I recommend using foil on the bottom to make clean up easier.

My boyfriend and I loved this! It was incredibly easy to make (and I'd never even cooked fish before) and tasted great. Hint: If you don't have a garlic grater, peel the garlic and stick it in the blender on "chop."

Wow! This is so simple to throw together, yet it tastes like something from an expensive restaraunt. We have tried it with fresh ginger, and then with ground ginger, and personally we prefer the ground ginger.

I only had ground ginger on hand and no dijon mustard so I substituted honey mustard instead.  I think it turned out delicious--nearly restaurant quality.  I must have used a different cut of salmon because I had to cook mine much longer and then I broiled it at the end to brown the top a bit.

This was probably the best salmon I've ever made, but it was so easy I couldn't take that much credit for it!  I can't wait to have this again.  I also enjoyed it cold the next day.

This was super quick and flavorful for an easy dinner when I thawed some salmon and didn't know how I wanted to prepare it.  I double the recipe, except for the mustard, which I though might overpower the  fish and sauce.  I microwaved it for 20 seconds to help thin out the honey.   I also cooked this on the stovetop, spooning the sauce on both sides as it cooked.  Excellent!  Thank you for sharing.  We'll be having this again!

This was incredible!  Some of the best fish I've ever had, and I'm not even a fan of honey/mustard combinations.  So good.

I LOVED this recipe, unfortunately hubby said it was only "ok".  I didn't change anything with this recipe (which is completely unusual for me).  Thank you for the post.  I will make this again (when hubby isn't eating dinner.)  Thanks for the post.

So simple but soooo good.  One of the few recipes we have had that rates 10 stars.  Best recipe for salmon we have had.  We do ours on the grill, wrapped in aluminum foil.  Don't substitute anything for the fresh ginger.

Made this for supper and hubby loved it!  Served with lemon rice a vegetable and salad.  Very light and easy to prepare.  Needed to cook it a little longer than the recipe called for, perhaps my salmon was a little thicker than origional recipe.

Great recipe, and soooo easy. I would recommend adding some salt to the olive oil mixture. Also, baste the fillets with the sauce half-way through the cooking. A bit of lime/lemon juice adds just the right amount of tart to finish it off. 
Overall, very tasty. Goes well with the Ginger Cabbage recipe that can be found at this site.

This was good. I added a little viniger as well as the olive oil to give it a little extra zing. I would add that in the future for sure. I also didnt have enough glaze, I added to both sides of fish so I made a little more and really coated the fish. Entire family liked.

We liked this - nice flavor without overpowering the salmon.  I added a bit of salt and squeezed some lemon juice over the filets before brushing on the glaze.

Grating ginger is a bit difficult to do, I just ended up dicing it into itty bitty pieces.  I loved the flavors.

I was making salmon and needed to make a sauce that was quick and easy.  I found this recipe in seconds and made the sauce in minutes and my salmon was baked perfect and it was so yummy!  I did however decrease the amount of ginger from 2 tsp to 1!

I followed the recipe exactly, but once i got the glaze all mixed up, I couldn't bear to put it on the salmon, because the glaze smelled and tasted horrible.  I made salmon with herbs instead.

SO SO good! It didn't taste fishy at all - I messed up proportions a bit (1 teaspoon each of honey and mustard, used extra salmon) but still was amazing. It had to cook an extra 15 minutes or so since it was so thick. Fresh ginger is key!
{EDIT: I've now made this with tilapia and just as satisfying. However, instead of just dumping the stuff on top, I brushed it this time. I liked it better before!}

I made this for my husband, my father-in-law, and myself.  My father-in-law was impressed and my husband said it was good (even though he usually doesn't like salmon). I loved it.  I will definitely make this again.  I, too, doubled the glaze and poured what was left after brushing on top of the salmon.  I also followed the advice of others and cooked it on foil and added 10 minutes to the cooking time (since my salmon was the thickness of salmon steak).  I thought it was grand! Very easy too)  Thanks so much for this recipe.

Really nice recipe; didn't have the fresh ginger, so subbed one tsp (2 people) ground, and served sprinkled with chives, with a baked potato, and Campfire Green Beans - excellent easy menu!  Hubby loved it - fairly low calorie/heart healthy, too.

I've used this recipe several times. I really enjoy it, but my kids dont care for it. Ginger is an acquired taste, and unless you have a sophisticated palate, you might not care for the combination of flavors. This is a very easy recipe and a different way to serve salmon. I buy a big fillet and use half with this recipe and the other half just lemon and butter for the kids, that way everyones happy!

Fantastic....So easy to make, yet tastes gourmet.  I used a horseradish mustard instead of the dijon mustard for some added flavor.  It was a big hit.

Never been much of a fish lover, this was good.
Even my 10 year old daughter liked it.

Fast, delicious!  I used dried ginger and it was awesome.  I very rarely rate, so consider this meal a 10 star.   I threw in cherry tomatoes and fresh spinach (with feta cheese) into the same baking dish as the salmon for the same amount of time.  Easy meal the family!

My husband and I loved this! Super super tasty, so quick, and so easy it was hard to believe we were done preparing the fish before popping it into the oven. The added benefit of ginger helping with digestion just made me love this recipe more.

This recipe was extremely easy, quick and extremely delicious.  The glaze did a wonderful job of holding in the natural jucies of the fish and was not dry at all.  Definitly a keeper.

Delish-no other words for this dish.  I had gastric bypass surgery nearly 3 years ago and salmon is my main meat/fish an this gives it new meaning.  I cannot have honey or sugar, or brown sugar so i substitute sugar free maple syrup when its called for, and with this recipe, it works wonderfully.  Thanks for the great recipe, this gets 5 plus stars from me!

quick, easy, devoured by all ages 1-35, boys and girls, hubby too.  would serve to guests.  used fresh ginger and based on previous reviews upped amount to 1 TBSP.  also doubled sauce to use up remainder of mustard jar.  all sauce got soaked up with whatever people could find to get it off their plates. yum yum.

This is a very quick dish to throw together.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was good, but if I were to make it again, I would increase the amount of fresh ginger to 1 Tbsp.

This was fabulous!!
Everyone in the family loved it and wanted more- I could have made twice the amount and still had no leftovers.
A keeper.
Thanks so much for sharing!

The flavor is great.  I changed the amounts a little though: 1.5 pounds (minimum) to feed four hungry people, and I also doubled the glaze.

I really enjoyed this recipe, but my picky husband wasn't a fan.Again, he's really fussy about food, so that has not affected my rating. I used ground ginger as that's what I had on hand. Went nicely with fried brown rice and sesame soy green beans.

I made this last minute, followed the recipe exactly, but put it on the grill.  As soon as it was close to done, I removed it from the grill to a platter and covered it will foil, and drove a half hour to the party.  In that half hour, the foil covered salmon seemed to poach further and absorb the ginger and mustard flavors.  I thought it was great, and it got raves from all the guests.  Best salmon I ever made, and I will make again!

This was very good, but my sauce went on a little too thick (I used it all, so it was really smeared on good) and that was just a little off-putting for me.  I think I just didn't like the sweetness of the honey, or rather, there was a bit too much of it.  The ginger was fine, and I used a good spicy dijon mustard, but next time I will either cut back on the honey by half or just lightly brush the sauce on.  But that's just my personal preference - the fish itself came out very moist and delicious!  Thanks!

Wonderful!  If you like ginger, you will like this recipe.  I followed the recipe very closely, the only change I made was to salt and pepper the salmon before applying the sauce.  The sauce is great, the ginger is definitely the dominant flavor, but the zip of the mustard and the sweetness of the honey really round it out.  I recommend this recipe because it is so easy, healthy and delicious!

This recipe was pretty good although I still like my lemon pepper a little better.  I also have to admit that I used regular mustard instead of      Dijon.  I think the Dijon would have added a little spice which was just what it was lacking.

We prepare this on the grill & it really brings out the flavor!  Place the salmon fillet on foil & drizzle generously with the marinade.  Form a foil pocket sealing it at the top to lock in the marinade.

Fantastic recipe.  I was cooking for one and didnt want to heat up the oven for one pieces of fish, so I made this on the stovetop.  Came out great.  Next time I will double the sauce, there wasnt quite enough for the entire fish and it was the best part!

Great Recipe!!  Really quick and easier to make and the ginger quick the salmon a nice kick.  My boyfriend doesn't normally like sauces with Honey but he loved it from the first bite.  I will definitely cook this again.

This is a simple and delicious way to do your salmon.  Every time we've made it for company, they ask for the recipe.

i won't say we didn't like this recipe, it was good, we both ate it up, but it's not something i'll add to my list of 'things to make regularly'.  not exactly sure what was missing, it just didn't really grab us.

Great.  I added 3 Tbsp. of grated fresh ginger, say sauce, and 1/2 cup of cranberries and let it marinate for 8 hours.

This didn't look so great coming out of the oven - the sauce turned to a brown and sort of coated the entire fish.  But the taste and smell was great!  I did put a little baslamic vinegar in to my mix and maybe I have too much sauce for my 3 filets.  I will definitely make this again tho maybe with less sauce to see what that gives me.  The picture shows a light yellow sauce and that's definitely not what I got.  Husband and kids all enjoyed this one, tho!

After making this the first time we also found it a little bland so the second time I deglazed the pan with aq little white wine and added a ground black pepper rub with garlic and a little extra dijon mustard.  Turned out great.  Thanks for the post.

We love Salmon and I cook it all the time. I was excited to try a 'simple' new recipe. This one, however was boring. Wasting time on the fresh ginger, only to have bland salmon was disappointing. I started to settle for a 3 star rating, but 2 was the best I could give. Thanks, anyway.

This was great, my husband loved, however I accidentilly picked up the balsamic vinegar bottle instead of the olive (bottled the same at a specialty store), it turned out great.  He wants it again prepared the same way, i did after all of this add the olive oil.

I agree the flavors meld well together and the salmon stays moist, however it is a mild flavor and we prefer something more bold. Perhaps a stronger mustard? I'd try it again but I'd tinker with the ingredients a bit. Thanks for sharing.

I'm giving this 4 stars because it tasted good, but the baking time was way off. The glaze didn't really "glaze" due to the low temperature & I had to bake the fish for closer to 35 min. I'm thinking the flavor would've been better if it had been marinated for a few hours. Not sure if I'll make this again, but it did taste good so thank you!

We didnt' find this to have the flavor I thought it would. I made exactly & even marinated it for a few hours; let sit out of fridge for 30 mins & then baked as directed. Maybe because I used frozen salmon fillets? I did thaw first. I may try again with fresh salmon.

Quick and easy with excellent flavor. I used a zester for the fresh ginger. The salmon steaks were garnished with a bit of the ginger zest and some minced green onions. Yummy!

I had such high hopes for this recipe, but I didn't really enjoy this at all.  I ended up only eating half my serving, and scraping the glaze off most of the portion that I did eat.  But to be fair I think it might have been the Dijon mustard I used (it was a little old).  I'll get some new mustard (maybe the horseradish the some others recommended) and try again.

Easy, great ginger marinade. Salmon was tasty! Added water to the leftover ginger marinade to thin it out and used as salad dressing. This is a versatile keeper.

I would not rate this a 5 star, I'd rate it a 10!!
I made exactly as written......AWESOME! Even my hubby loved it & he doesn't like fish. I served this with bacon wrapped asparagus (found recipe on site) and placed on a bed of long grain & wild rice with a salad on the side. Quick, easy & now a favorite that we have weekly. Thank you so very much for sharing this!

I used the sauce on salmon and cod in the air fryer for 14 minutes.  Both fish came out perfect! Added roasted potatoes and asparagus 8 minutes.  I place foil in the bottom, so no cleanup!  She loved it!

I made this exactly as written. then, after tasting (a good cook always tastes before serving), I decided to add a bit of zip to the dish before serving, so I sprinkled a few pink peppercorns atop the salmon. I got raves. I even liked it. Thanks. Oh, I bought the ginger pureed in the vegetable aisle in the grocery.

Absolutely awesome and easy recipe. Made this for my husband who not only hates honey and mustard and he ended up loving it. I agree with another reviewer that said it needs more like 30 minutes baking time though - 20 minutes definitely wasn't enough.

Very nice salmon.  The sauce is thick so it stays on the fish, which is good.  The mustard adds a nice tang, and it's a plus that you don't need to marinate this.

This is my go-to salmon recipe. It's healthy, only needs a few ingredients (most of which you probably have in your pantry), is quick....and best part is: IT'S DELICIOUS. It's amazing how this simple recipe can pack that much flavor. I follow this recipe to a T (which is unusual for me since I'm always looking for ways to improve it based on reviews) except that a few minutes before it's done cooking I sprinkle some chopped scallions on top for a garnish. I serve this with a slice of lemon and a vegetable side like sautéed/roasted asparagus. Make this!

Made this recipe last night for me and my husband. We were searching for more salmon recipes, were impressed by how few ingredients there were, and decided to add this one to the "to cook list." 

My hubby enjoyed it, as it's much different than other salmon recipes out there. I thought it was pretty okay. I would've added about 2 tbslpoons of brown sugar to the mix, a little salt and garnished it with some lemon. I also would have added less ginger as it was a little too zingy for my taste. The burnt honey bits were divine though.

A couple of variations...used honey mustard instead of mixing up my own and covered with sliced pickled ginger I use on sushi. Wonderful, and cooked in about 15 minutes.

I didn't have fresh ginger and it was still excellent. Easy too. Cooking took longer in my oven. pared with cauliflower, broccoli and zucchini that I cut small and baked at the same time in a different pan and after baking stirred in a little Asian Sesame w/Ginger and Soy dressing. Definitely making it again.

I was so mad at myself when I realized I forgot to purchase a dehydrated packet of McCormick Sloppy Joe mix at the grocery. When I read Chef John's recipe and realized I had all the ingredients, I was so thrilled that I would be making a fresh dish from scratch. Sure, it took more time but it came out  so much better than instant.  I cut the water in half and would definitely do it again. T.

I gave this recipe a try with a few additions & I was really pleased with the end result. I added 1tsp of soy sauce, & 1 tsp angostura bitters. I also baked a large piece of filleted salmon. The used a glass baking dish, which I sprayed with Pam. The fish was tender, moist & flavourful can't wait to make it again..

I really like the ginger sauce, except I would put it on chicken rather than salmon. I thought the salmon-ginger combo wasn't great, but my mom loved this recipe. That's why it gets a four. It was also really easy to prepare. It's a great idea if you have an extra ginger and you don't know what to do with it. 

Also, if you have a bit of ginger, peel it, clean it, throw it in a cup and pour boiling water on it. You'll have a delicious and healthy ginger tea!

I used the foil packet method for cooking, then broiled them for about 5 minutes to set the glaze - perfect!  The only thing that I would do differently next time, would be to double the glaze to have some to add at table.  I'll try the glaze on something else for sure - perhaps pork chops.  Very nice and pretty!

I enjoyed it but only because I love salmon. I could barely taste the sauce, and when I did, it wasn't that great. I might as well have grilled salmon by itself and saved myself some time. 2 stars because it was fairly easy

My favorite way to eat salmon is grilled with some lemon juice and soy sauce, but if I'm in the mood for a sauce of some sort, this is excellent!

Excellent! I tried this recipe for the first time tonight. My husband just loves it! It makes a change from “lemon-pepper” salmon. I added a teaspoon of finely minced shallot to the sauce. This is the first time I've ever use the ugly little root that I have in my freezer.

This is a very good rececipe for any occasion, healthy too! I've tried other recipes similar to this, and ginger and honey are a wonderful combination for salmon.

I used this sauce (made with ground ginger) on salmon steaks and it was delicious.  (Steaks have to be turned once while cooking, so I brushed it on both sides.) It wasn't absorbed into the steak as much as I'm supposing it would into a fillet, but in the course of the meal the guinea pig requested it again three times.  ;-)

This wasn't horrible, but I didn't think it was fabulous.  It kinda tasted like I'd just put a lot of mustard on some salmon.  I'll probably keep looking for a salmon recipe.

I followed this recipe exactly and found it disgusting. Sorry, but it's a no-go, and I love all of the ingredients, even the ginger. The hubby even hated it and he eats everything.

Fantastic glaze for salmon! I added a little white wine vinegar for a little kick. Also, I glazed the salmon and let it marinate for a few hours before putting it in the oven.

I don't even like salmon, and I loved this recipe! I used 1 tbsp of ground ginger instead of fresh grated. I used the thicker steaks so they took longer to cook. I marinated the fish a half hour before putting it in the oven. Also, glaze the fish lightly--I left it a little thick in some parts and it became kind of jelly-like.

i marinated this for 3 hours.  I used spicy brown mustard instead of dijon, because I didn't have it, and ground ginger because I am too lazy to mess with fresh.  The fish was moist, but not flavorful.  I expected something sweeter.  I mentioned it to a friend who really cooks (I don't) and she says she always leaves honey or other sweeteners out of marinade and puts them directly on the fish with the marinade over that.

I needed a quick and flavorful marinade for salmon. This worked perfectly. Sadly, there were no leftovers! I will use this recipe again.
