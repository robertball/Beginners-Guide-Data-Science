This was an ok basic recipe but I did have to do quite a bit of sprucing so that it would suit our taste.  I added about 2 tsp of season salt, used crushed tomatoes instead of stewed and added about 2 tbls of sugar.  After all that.... it tasted much better.

Disappointing. Sauce looked good, but there was no depth of flavor, no punch. Over all, a very boring sauce. Will not make again.

I'm only 15, with only a basic cooking knowledge, and I was able to cook this sauce quickly and with ease. It had a great taste, though I had no pepper flakes =[ Thanks for the recipe, I will continue to use it. 5 stars

This was delicious! It was a little chunkier than I expected, but it almost made it taste fresher that way.

We wanted something quick and easy to go with mozzarella sticks.  This was wonderful.  I needed to use up some tomatoes before they went bad and this was an excellent way.  I am new to making my own sauces, and I am glad to have found a recipe that I liked.  My husband loved it, which is saying alot.

This sauce is plain, simple, no frills and basic just like it claims. It tasted good, but it just didn't wow me.

This is surprisingly tasty for such a simple dish.  I did add about 1 tsp pepper flakes instead of a pinch, I also used spaghetti instead of angel hair, it was just fine.  I would make again perhaps adding chicken or shrimp would also make it extra special.

I have made this with both stewed tomatos and crushed tomatos. It is easier and by far more tasty with crush tomatos. I left out the dried basil and just used all fresh basil and added one small onion. I know some think this is a boring sauce, but it is more authentic than the store bought spaghetti sauce many may be use to eatting. This is an excellent sauce!

This was delicious and very easy. I did not run it through a food processor and I used fresh basil rather than dried. It worked very well in my turkey lasagna.

This has become a household favorite. I used fresh basil from my herb garden and it made all the flavors pop. I added a sprinkle of sugar like someone suggested and it brought it all together! Great with parmesan crusted chicken or bruschetta!

I made this exactly as stated but added green and yellow bell pepper and zucchini. My guest loved it and asked for the recipe. It's a winner.

Very good sauce!  I used a 29 oz can of tomato puree because that was what I had on hand, and threw in a drained 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes as well for a little chunkiness.  I also decreased the olive oil to 3 TBSP to reduce the fat and found that to be a good amount.  Served with Meatball Nirvana meatballs from this site for a very good supper!  I do think if I were serving the sauce plain I would add in some more garden vegetables, but the sauce is very good as written without additions.

I am incredibly picky about red sauce and love a light red sauce with fresh canned or stewed tomatoes. Not only was this easy but the whole table just raved about how good it was and everyone had seconds!  I served over cheese tortellini and made it exactly as the recipe is written.

It was simple to make and very tasty.  I loved the flavor but my family would not touch it because it was too spicy for them.  I liked the heat however.  When I make it in the future, I will make two batches and leave the red pepper flakes out for the family and put them in for me.

I love this recipe!  I used crushed tomatoes and put 3 to 4 cloves of minced garlic in.  This is a great receipt for pizza sauce.  I will make a double batch when I make it for pasta and freeze the rest for pizza night!! My husband and son love this recipe!  Oh, and I add oregano as well.

I wrote this recipe so many years ago and never thought so many people would respond to it!  I love how people have changed it to make it their own and to suit their own tastes!  Now, 10+ years later I look back on this recipe with fond memories of when I was a college student and first learned to cook for myself.  Even though my tastes and kitchen skill level has changed over the years, I still fondly look back at this recipe.  :)

This is a great red base pasta sauce.It can have lots of flavor with endless possibilities.  I added red and yellow bell peppers ,doubled the garlic,used fresh basil and and 2 oz of tomato sauce.  No more store bought sauce for me.

This has become my go to base for pasta sauce.  I use some of the other reviewers suggestions to jazz it up a little bit, like using crushed tomatoes and adding some salt and sugar.
