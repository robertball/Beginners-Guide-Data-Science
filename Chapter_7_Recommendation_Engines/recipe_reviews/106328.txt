Very nice and simple recipe that people can build on or change if individual tastes differ. I enjoyed the sauce quite a bit, and am going to make these without the bun and with a bit of wine in the sauce(heated at a low simmer)and some asparagus on the side, for a 'dinner for two' with the hubby. It made a nice filling sandwich that I will make again as well, for friends and for lunches.

I made a modification to this recipe so I'm mainly rating it based on the sauce because the sauce is genius!  So simple but the result is delicious.  You can sub light sour cream which gives you a far healthier alternative to mayo and mustard on sandwiches and it also makes a great dipping sauce.  You'll have tons left over so you could halve it if you don't want to use it for other purposes.  Many reviewers menntioned the chicken was a bit bland so I chose to bread my chicken breasts in Italian style panko bread crumbs and the result was fantastic.  You can see my changes in my modified version of this recipe on my profile.  I was inspired and now I think this will be a regular on the dinner recipe rotation.

This was very good, but I did make a few changes. I put seasoned salt, pepper, as well as the onion powder. i also marinated the chicken in vegatable broth prior to cooking. Loved it.

These were so yummy! I only made half of the sauce and still didn't use it all. But the burgers were great! The only thing I could think of to make them better would be to put them on a good sourdough bun. I'll definitely make these again.

I loved this recipe!  It was so fast and easy but something really different and tasty.  I was shocked my kids ate it all and my husband said it was better than those fancy Panera sandwiches.  I  sprinkled my chicken with onion salt instead of onion powder and I used dijon mustard instead of yellow.  So delicious!

Quick, easy & good.  We vut back on the amount of sauce made, but it was still alot.  I think it could be cut in half.  We also used Dijon mustard because we like a the kick.

I loved these, DH did too. I did cut back a little on the sour cream from other reviews. We had a side salad with the sandwich and I added the honey mustard to the salad. It's so easy, and I'm sure I'll be making this again.

Nice idea but not the best burger I've had. The honey mustard sauce has way too much sour cream in it. That was all I could taste. Tripled the mustard & honey just for some flavour. The sauce in the AUSSIE CHICKEN recipe is way better. Probably won't make again.

I've made these a few times & it seems to get better every time. I'm a little ify on the honey mustard though. I can't seem to get it how I like it. Other than that, very good & easy to make.

I followed the advice of Valerie's review and used italian panko crumbs on the chicken.  I pounded the chicken to half the thickness and dredged in flour, egg, & panko crumbs.  I then browned in a skillet until golden brown and finished in the oven for 10 minutes, topped with ham & cheese and cooked an additional 5 minutes.  The flavor was really good and the sauce was a nice compliment.  The recipe really did remind me of chicken cordon bleu.

Pretty good. I used half yellow mustard/half Dijon mustard... great flavor. 

The only negative - my kids will eat ANYTHING but my 6 year old son wouldn't eat this.

I did not care for this.  The chicken was tasteless.  It needs to be marinaded in something or coated with crumbs.

Made 4 Bell and Evans Chicken burgers in a pan. Mixed sauce--1/2 container DF sour cream, mustard and honey. Lightly browned burgers in skillet with olive oil. Tablespoon of sauce, slice of ham (chipped worked well), sauce, slice of DF Swiss cheese, sauce, ham and sauce. Put the lid on and burner on low-med--melted everything and it was yummy.
