Mango salsa complements the chicken perfectly adding a lively sweet and spicy flavor that would appeal to many. If you like a little more heat, simply add a jalapeno!  Thumbs up approval by 4 households in our neighborhood whom we rotate weekend barbequing with!  Thanks so much for the submission!

Yum! This was a great combination of sweet and spicy! The mango salsa was absolutely delicious and paired nicely over top grilled chicken. I used lime juice and to season the chicken I opted to use Mrs. Dash Fiesta Lime Seasoning Blend. The chicken came out moist and flavorful! I served this with a side of Spanish rice, sliced avocado and warm tortillas - great recipe!

Why use a marinade packet when you can make this recipe?! It's so vibrant and fresh tasting!!! I've made it twice in a weeks time it is *that* good! No changes made, and I used the Montreal chicken seasoning by McCormick

Oh yes, we liked this...liked it a LOT actually!  The one thing that I did add was some chopped jalapeño to the mango salsa, and I would definitely do that in the future.  The flavor is bright, fresh, and simply awesome, and it has lovely presentation!  Nothing not to like here, I put this one in my Favorites folder.

Sorry to the recipe purists. I don't like raw red pepper or firm Mango. Never bought a Mango before. Plus I had some real Ginger and Garlic in the pantry which seemed perfect. Diced everything up and sauteed it for awhile to meld flavors and soften/caramelize fruit and veggies. I encourage adding extra onion. It worked very, very well. I used my own Poultry Seasoning (w/o salt). Ground mixed peppercorns and Kosher salt finished the chicken thigh seasoning. For those who don't like raw ingredients...this solves it. Kids might even eat it. Without any green onion tops, I used dried chives for garnish (I'll pass on cilantro). This is a really good looking and flexible recipe...substitute some ingredients and seasonings. Only thing that really needs to be cooked is the chicken.

Excellent!  I used Trader Joe's 21 Seasoning Salute for the chicken seasoning.  I added a little Anaheim chile to the salsa because it's a mild chile (had to be careful for another eater in my family), but I like heat in my salsa!  I made the salsa this morning, and I put the chicken in the marinade about 3 hours before grilling it.  I will be making this again because it is a very nice low-cal low-fat meal!  Thank you, Mazola!

This Recipe was easy to follow and turned out absolutely delicious. I added some red quinoa to it and placed the chicken on top of it.

This was awesome! I marinated the chicken for about 2 hours. Used McCormick`s Montreal Chicken seasoning. The chicken was moist and the Mango Salsa was really good! I definitely have a new recipe to serve my family and friends.

This was very good!  The chicken was so moist and flavorful! I  used fajita seasoning but you could use just about any seasoning on this.  The salsa was fantastic, as well! Thanks for sharing your recipe!

A satisfying result which such simplicity. The mango pepper salsa featured unique flavors. I decided to use the lemon juice with the chicken and lime juice in the salsa. Very lovely and healthy lunch meal.

Delicious and refreshing - even without cilandro (I had none at home on that day). 
1/2 red onion + 1/2 mango + 1/2 red bell pepper + 1 lime (NOT juice but flesh in dices too) made a perfect 2 people serving.

It's good but does take alot of time. I prefer to have my chicken topped with a fresh mango salsa at the end but the marinade is good.

Great recipe. Everyone loved the chicken. Seasoning was great. This would make a great chicken sandwich. Everyone enjoyed the salsa as well. I did add a diced jalapeno for some heat. I only let the chicken marinate for 30 minutes and it really was great.

This was a great hit with us! I only used the Mazola Corn Oil with salt and pepper to let the taste of the chicken come through. The Mazola Oil really accentuated the chicken and let it's taste shine. We loved the combo of Mango and red pepper. I used oregano in place of the Cilantro as we do not care for Cilantro. A great combination that will be made again and again at this house!

We enjoyed this a lot!  For the chicken I used Penzey's BBQ 3001 seasoning.  It was perfect.  Used orange bell pepper instead of the red and added some chopped jalapenos just to add some heat for our taste. This a such a great light chicken dinner :)

Have to admit that I cheated. I used the fresh pineapple-mango salsa from Whole Foods instead of making my own. Seasoned the chicken with what I had - garlic powder, onion powder, oregano, basil, sage, marjoram, thyme, rosemary, mustard, and pepper. And let it sit in the lemon juice. Cooked it on my T-fal all-purpose grill. Cut up the chicken for the kids and topped it with the salsa. Served with brown basmati rice & asparagus. Yummy!

Flavor was excellent. Holding back on five stars cuz I think the proportions of the salsa are way off. Putting almost a cup of salsa on four ounces of chicken...prolly three ounces when cooked...is too much, and the salsa didn't keep well. I ended up tossing most of the salsa. Next time I will plan for about one-half cup salsa per serving/per chicken breast. Otherwise, flavor-wise...excellent.

This is unbelievably good and perfectly healthy--IF you use a few tablespoons of olive oil instead of Canola oil.  My husband made it with canola oil and i didn't think it tasted good.  I would also eyeball the ratio of onions to mango. Too many onions overpowers the mango.

Wonderful!!  I used poultry seasoning and lemon juice. My mango was a bit overripe, so it didn't cube but kind of mashed -- it was still amazing. Added a jalapeño. My husband went gags over it. Served with sautéed green beans and some leftover mashed potatoes. Rice would've been better, I think. Can't wait for the leftovers!

This was sooooo good. I marinated the chicken for about 2 hours and made the salsa then as well so the flavors had time to marry. The gas grill wouldn't start so I made the chicken on a grill pan which was easy to keep an eye on. This is definitely one of our favorites and will make often.

The salsa was excellent.  It complemented the smoky grilled flavor of the chicken very well.  I'd be up for doing this again, maybe making a grilled chicken sandwich out of it.

I cooked my chicken on the Foreman, to windy to grill. Marinaded the chicken in balsamic vinager, olive oil, ginger and cilantro. Added jalapeño and garlic to the salsa. Really good!

I made the recipe as directed but used poultry seasoning.   That was simply wrong for this recipe.   I wish I would have read the reviews before I had made it.   I plan to make again using a different seasoning and adding some jalapenos to the salsa, and maybe a bit of lime.

We tried this tonight and loved it!  I used olive oil instead of corn oil and McCormick's Montreal seasoning for the marinade, and added jalapeno and avocado to the salsa.  We are definitely going to make this again soon!

This is delicious as is and works well with fish as well. Use a denser fish or it will fall apart on the grill. Yum! The ingredients can be adjusted to your personal preferences.

The the fresh citrus flavors blend well with the seasoning for a moist flavorful chicken. The mango salsa was awesome. I also grilled some tortillas to serve this soft taco style.
