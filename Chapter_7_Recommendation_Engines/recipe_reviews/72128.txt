This is a very good chicken salad recipe.  Don't hesitate to use it.  Next time I will only put 1 cup of Mayonnaise.  I mixed in about 3/4 cup of the red onion because my children don't like onions and I added a handful (approximately 1/2 cup) of Dry Roasted Pine Nuts.  I'll bet cashews would be good in it if you don't have the pine nuts.  My kids loved it and didn't say anything about the onions.  Wow...what an accomplishment!

I rate recipes based on how they work when done by the book. This one needed substantial tweaking. Halve the mayo and mix. Add more mayo as needed. Hint: More finely-chopped chicken needs more mayo. Reduce the chopped parsley to 1/2 cup. I had to use dried tarragon which I increased to 1 tbsp. Dice the celery so it's less distracting. Consider swapping halved red grapes for the raisins. Not including salt and pepper is a big oversight. Use a pinch of each. Mix well and refrigerate at least several hours or overnight for the flavors to blend.

I really enjoyed this one. Very subtle flavor that would be liked by most. Used canned chicken from Sam's Club.

This is a really great recipe! I used a rotisserie chicken instead per a friend's suggestion. Very GOOD. I did not use the raisens, and I used maybe 3/4 cup mayo- maybe even less. I would start with less and add in to your liking.

I like to rate recipes as published. Otherwise to me it's not really rating the recipe submitted. That being said I found this recipe to be very good as published. The tarragon really makes it. Such a nice favor yet not overbearing. The celery gives it a nice crunch and everything combined makes for a wonderful salad. I have served it many ways but my family likes it best served in a pita bread pocket. Add a nice homemade sangria wine and you have a wonderful light summer day lunch.

This is an EXCELLENT chicken salad.  The tarragon gives it a sophisticated but subtle "something" that everyone seems to love.  I made this for my daughter's baby shower, served on croissants.  Everyone LOVED it!  I'm thinking about growing tarragon in my garden just so I always have it on hand to make this.  Thanks for the great recipe! =)

Pretty good chicken salad. I tried it again and reduced the mayo to 1 cup, added 1 tsp sugar, added a dash of white pepper and salt, reduced onion to 1/3 cup finely minced, and reduce parsley to 1/4 cup chopped. I also added halved red grapes and dried cranberries and dropped the raisins.

It was very good, but I would maybe use less mayo next time or not use the cusinart to chop the chicken so finely.

Very good flavor but way too much mayo.  Next time, use half what it calls for.  If you dont have all that parsley on hand, not crucial to taste.  Only used about half cup and still had great flavor.

This chicken salad was quite good and got rave reviews from my gang. I did add my usual garlic and onion powders plus black pepper. Kids are not fans of the raisin so I left that out. Tarragon came thru just enough without overpowering the salad. Thank you!

I boiled the chicken rather than baked it. I didn't have celery and still wanted that crunch so I added a diced apple. Then I substituted green onion for the red and dried cranberries for the raisins. Just add mayo as your stir until it's moist enough for your tastes. It didn't take 1 1/2 cups for me.

Don't be shy with the tarragon, it has a great flavor.  I used craisins instead of raisins and added lemon juice to taste.  Don't try and subsitute the red onion with yellow or white, red it the best choice!

Loved it very much, but I used bone in skin on chicken for a more roasted and flavorful chicken taste. After cooking I discarded the bones and skin and shredded the chicken. Overall, a great dish! Yumm!

This was awesome!  My wife, three daughters and my neighbor all couldn't get enough of the sandwiches I made!  I made it as is, except I added some dried tarragon to kick up the flavor.  It's my favorite herb.

Great choice adding the tarragon.  I love tarragon and it gives the chicken salad something special.  I can't wait to try this with some fresh tarragon which I grow during the summer.

Very good recipe.  I used Rotisserie chicken, left out the parsley and substitued grapes for raisins.  Quite tasty.  I also reduced mayo amount by approx half, as I prefer a 'drier' salad. Definitely will make again!

I tweaked some but still yummy:
I used dry herbs as I didn't have fresh. I used sliced red grapes instead of raisins. I also used seasoned/smoked chicken we had smoked the day before. Smoky chicken adds a yummy flavor to this recipe.  
I read several other reviews and agree with the overage of mayo....use about a cup first then add a little extra as needed. I ended up having to add extra chicken as it was too wet at first.

I made this for my culinary class at my high school! I used only one cup of mayonnaise and it was plenty. Tarragon is a really good addition to chicken salad. Everyone enjoyed it!

This chicken salad is wonderful. I always increase the amount of tarragon simply because I like the taste and I use dried cranberries instead of raisins  because I like the tart/sweet taste of them in this salad. Try the salad as is first and then try your own twist on it. This is a definitely a keeper that I have made many times and I have never found anyone who didn't like it. I always make the puffs from this site for this salad. Thank you for posting this recipe.

I loved this recipe.  I was in a crunch and used 5 cans well drained chicken breast and shredded the chicken.  I use Light Miracle Whip instead of Mayo.  Served with Frito Scoops.  It was wonderful and the tarragon was subtle yet enhancing and a refreshing taste to an old favorite.  It was made for a crowd and was very well received.  I am looking forward to making this again soon!

Love this recipe! Great as is, but I like it with the following adaptations: Omitted raisins, cut mayo to 1 cup, added red grapes, cranberries, diced apples and chopped walnuts.

We used less mayo for sure and substituted "craisins" for the raisins.  It was great!

I only tried this recipe because I felt bad that I never use the tarragon from my garden.  What a lucky find for me!  I love this chicken salad!  I follow the recipe exactly as written and it always turns out great.

the tarragon adds this distinct sweetness if you will. I never tried tarragon before and i like how this came out even tho i left out the rasins
