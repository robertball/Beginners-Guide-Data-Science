This dessert was very attractive, but I thought the meringue was far too sweet, I've had meringue shells before that would be better and use much less sugar.

This isn't a quick recipe, but for presentation it's absolutely delightful.  I chose to make mini nests for individual servings.  Perfect!  If you have any concerns about the sweetness I suggest adding the sugar 1/4 cup at a time, you don't want the meringue to taste like egg whites.  I found that it was fine as is.

I set the oven to preheat at 450 as per recipe. I made the meringues put them in the oven and immediately turned off the oven. The meringues turned quite brown very quickly. I don't know if the temp is a typo but I think the oven temp as stated is too hot for the  meringues.
