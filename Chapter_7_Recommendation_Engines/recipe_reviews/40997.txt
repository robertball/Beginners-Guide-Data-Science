While the combination of pear and pumpkin sounded appealing I found that this soup missed the mark.  It was too sweet and there was not enough pumpkin flavor.  I think that the soup is improved by using more savory flavors to offset the sweetness from the pear nectar.

Found soup too thin and sweet as well.  May play around with proportions to come up with a thicker, heartier soup.

I made this as a first course for Thanksgiving.  Everyone loved it---this is a VERY simple, elegant soup to make.  Because it is so rich, we think this is definitely a "sipper" soup--couldn't imagine eating a whole bowl!  The pear garnish is a must.

I was afraid of this being too thin so I added on 2 cups 1/2 & 1/2 and My store was out of Pear Nectar so I used 4oz pear juice and 2 containers pear babyfood. And it did not turn out too sweet.  No one in my family liked it except me and I only thi=ought it was ok.  I added cayenne pepper to the first bowl I had and it was still ok.  My second bowl I added a cinnamon/sugar mixture and it was much better.
