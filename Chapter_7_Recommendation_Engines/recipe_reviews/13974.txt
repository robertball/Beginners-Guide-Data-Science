Great base recipe.  As with most people who gave four or five stars, I tinkered with the proportions.  That's not a problem with the recipe, just an issue of personal tastes and preferences.  Here are the quantities I used: 
8 ounces spaghetti
1 bunch green onions, sliced  (white parts only)
(for the onions, I had access to spring bermuda onions which worked very well)
1 tablespoon sesame oil
1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/3 + 2 TBS cup peanut butter	
1/8 cup soy sauce
1/3 cup hot water
1 tablespoon cider or rice) vinegar
1 teaspoon white sugar
1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes (I used a couple pinches of cayenne pepper powder)

I reduced the amount of soy because 1/4 cup seemed like too much sodium for me.  I also tripled the ginger (1 TBS instead of 1 tsp) because I like a good, strong ginger flavor and it really turned out well.  I also increased the water from 1/4 to 1/3 cup since I reduced the amount of liquid when I decreased the soy sauce.  I also added a couple cloves of minced garlic which I added to the oil/onions with the ginger.  

As I alluded  to before, the sign of a truly good recipe is one that can be easily altered to suit individual preferences!  Very happy with this recipe.

Phenomenal recipe! I always get tons of compliments when I bring this to potlucks. Because I like to tweak recipes, I added sliced chicken breast, 1 cup of coarse chopped peanuts, chopped green onions (green and white parts both), snow peas, 2 tbsps of sugar instead of 1 tsp, 2 tbsps of minced ginger, and toasted sesame seeds. The flavor really melds well together, and it's even better the next day!

With some tweakng, this is one of my favorite recipes.  I double the peanut butter and red pepper flakes, and usually add more water to thin the sauce.  Also, I usually saute a bag of frozen vegetables--one with broccoli, peppers, water chesnuts, and sugarsnap peas, and toss that in at the end.  It is delicious, and even better for lunch the next day.

This recipe is -great- as is, but with the following alterations, I think it's perfect. Use light soy sauce instead of regular (much less salty), and scramble 2 eggs along with the scallions. In addition, use rice noodles instead of spaghetti. Also, crunchy peanut butter (instead of smooth) gives it a nice texture. Garnish with either a few tablespoons of crushed peanuts, cilantro or sesame seeds.

This is an extremely easy sauce to make - smells simply wonderful, I've been using it for years.  Go get yourself some ginger-garlic paste from an Indian food store (you'll use it in absolutely everything) and stirfry that with carrots/zucchini/water chestnuts/shrimp etc.  Then add the sauce of peanut butter and soy.  To make the sauce more liquidy, add some chicken broth or my favorite, some coconut milk from a can.

I LOVE this recipe!! I made it with chunky peanut butter, which adds crunch--I think it is important to use sesame oil--it adds such great flavor! Was surprised to read others liked it using other kinds of oil. Sesame oil has to be refrigerated, then it lasts a lONG time!  The author was right--it is equally good hot, warm or cold! It will become a staple at our house, that's for sure!

I made this recipe for 30.  I used, proportionally, four times as much ginger as recommended, and an an almost equal amount of garlic.  Instead if crushed red peppers, I sauteed thai chilis with the garlic and ginger.  I used red wine vinegar instead of cider.  It was a crowd (and I do mean crowd!) pleaser.  I often make this when I have to feed a large group now.  Sesame or peanut oil both work great with this, but olive oil does just fine in a  pinch.

Awesome!! I fried some cubed extra firm tofu (thas was already pressed) before I added the dressing ingredients. I,too, reduced the amount of soy sauce by half. It was delicious and 100% VEGAN!!

I enjoyed this recipe quite a bit.  However, if I do make this again I think I will reduce the amount of peanut oil...it seemed to be too much making things a little on the greasy side. Also, you should note that this dish is quite filling.  We had plenty of left-overs.

I originally made this for kids school lunches.  I doubled the recipe so we could have it for dinner also the day before.  Well, there wasn't any leftover for the lunches the next day.  The kids loved it.  My 6-yr old ate 3 bowls of it.  My husband said it was a keeper.  I didn't have ginger so I substituted powdered ginger.  1 tbs ginger root = 1/8 tsp powdered ginger.  I also chopped 2 leftover chicken thighs in there and my picky eaters didn't notice it bec of the chucky peanut butter.  I left out the red pepper flakes from the sauce so my kids would eat it and my husband and I just sprinkled red pepper flakes on our individual plates.  Works fine that way.  
If you double the recipe, you do not need to double the sesame oil.  I also did not have a problem with stickiness probably bec. I doubled the liquids.

My husband LOVED this, add since he needs to gain a few pounds, I will be making it often.  :-)  Make sure to follow the direction to cook on LOW heat-- I didn't and burned the heck out of the onions and ginger the first time!  Oops!  Very good-- cold too!

My kids (4 and 2.5) LOVED this dish! I have tried several sweeter type dishes to try to win them over on anything other than Mac & Cheese, and it took until this recipe to make it happen. They devoured it. In order to add protein to the dish I added cubed chicken, and for vegetables I added peas (which might sound odd for a Thai Style dish but my kids wouldn't eat snow peas or sugarsnap peas, which might be more suitable). It worked great! I sauteed the chicken prior to making the sauce, and then threw the cooked chicken back into the sauce when it was done prior to tossing with the pasta. Excellent recipe, thank you!

Wow!  HATED these. WAY too salty.  Maybe if I'd taken the advice of other reviewers and only used half the listed amount of soy--but I always try the recipe as written before making changes.  In fact, if I made this again (which I won't) I'd use maybe 5 Tablespoons of soy and instead of cider vinegar, use balsamic vinegar.  But that advice would be for the next reader of these reviews cause I'm continuing my search for good cold noodles.

We love this recipe with a couple of changes.  I slice several green onions (white and green part), use only about 2 teaspoons of peanut butter, otherwise the PB is overwhelming and adds to the saltiness.  I also add a few drops of Chinese fire oil (careful!!) for a bit of a kick and less sesame oil than called for. Love sesame oil but this, too, can be an over-powering taste. It's very strong.  Have often tossed in leftover pork, chicken or beef to stretch a dollar now and then.  We love it without the meat, as a side dish.  Excellent while noodles are still warm or the next day after being chilled. Have also added chopped red, green, yellow bell peppers for eye appeal and super crunch.  Grandkids love it and daughter often takes it to work for her lunch.

I make these all the time for a quick and easy dinner. For us, there is too much peanut butter in the original recipe. I've found that about 3 TBSP with a bit more soy sauce is just about perfect. I also top with cilantro and chopped peanuts. Makes great leftovers served cold for the next days lunch.

This is a truly awesome sauce!  I doubled the recipe to accomodate a 16 ounce box of spaghetti and to make it a full meal I cooked boneless chicken breasts in terriyaki sauce and garlic.  I sliced that and put in on top of the noodles along with julianned green pepper, celery and cucumber.  Everyone loved it!

This is a fantastic recipe! Also very quick! I made it with crunchy peanut butter and olive oil since I forgot to pick up the sesame. It came out great! It was creamy and not salty like some people complained. (Most likely depends on the brand of soy sauce you use.) My boyfriend has already requested that we make this recipe again this week.

I kinda winged this one - I love thai peanut sauce, but I hate pad thai (AKA rice noodles). This recipe popped up today with good ratings, so I went for it! I used roughly 1/3 pkg of whole wheat spaghetti, nearly a lb of chicken breast, which I boiled and lightly shredded with a fork, and broccoli, which I blanched just until tender, drained, then briefly sauteed in a bit of sesame oil in my pan. I removed the broccoli from the pan, and added it to the bowl of shredded chicken to keep for later.
I put three cloves of garlic and about 2 inches of ginger root into my cuisinart to mince. It came to about 2-3 tablespoons total. I sauteed with the green onion in sesame, as directed.
Instead of adding straight up white sugar (sounded gross) We have many thai sauces in our fridge. I used a few tablespoons of sweet chili sauce (which has sugar, as well as other spices) and instead of pepper flakes, I used garlic chili sauce (another handy, but spicier thai sauce, both can be found very inexpensive at your local Asian grocer, great to use for dipping sauces or marinades). Used about 1/8 cup or a couple of tablespoons of the low-sodium soy sauce. I added to taste, so as not to go overboard with the salt.
I also added a light pouring of rice vinegar, a small tablespoon or so. 
I had coconut water, so I added that until the sauce loosened up. Mixed in the noodles, chicken and broccoli and topped with chopped roasted peanuts!

A couple weeks before I made this recipe I tried noodle and peanut sauce from the salad bar at whole foods. Seriously had a craving for weeks.  I thought it was my favorite thing in the world till I tried this!!!! I followed the directions exatly except I used less red pepper flake (kids were going to eat this too), all I had was low sodium Tamari so I used that and after cooking for a while the sauce seemed really thick so I add just a bit more water. To make it a whole meal I cooked tofu and mixed it in and added chopped red pepper for color.  I never cooked anything like this before and it turned out awesome!!!

This was fantastic! Adding one clove of garlic with the ginger was my only change. Other than that, I kept it the same. My picky 7 year old gobbled it right up. I even ate some cold the next day, though it is much better warmed.

This recipe turned out really well for us. I did add closer to 1/4c of peanut butter but still didn't think there was quite enough peanut flavor. I subbed the same amount of rice noodles for a dish more Asian-style and we both really liked the change. I will definitely make again after fiddling with the sauce, thanks so much for sharing.

I liked this, but I feel like it would be better with rice noodles, and next time I am adding more Peppers and some other veggies.

Wonderful! I used SDTERP's recommendations (add a few cloves of minced garlic, triple the ginger and cut the soy sauce roughly in half). I also added chopped red bell pepper, roughly chopped baby bok choy, sliced zucchini, and sliced carrots. Finally, I doubled the recipe. The result was truly wonderful. The explosion of ginger, peanut butter, sesame oil and soy sauce flavors in the mouth is memorably good.

I tweaked the recipe a little, but it still was a huge hit at the party I took it to. I used half as many onions as called for, and made up the other half with fresh cilantro sprinkled on top as a garnish. I only used half as much oil (olive, not sesame) as suggested to saute the onions, and added sliced carrots in about halfway through the process. I used fresh ground ginger paste instead of minced, and added about half as much minced garlic as there was ginger. I also reduced the soy sauce by half and increased the sugar to almost twice as much (my vinegar--rice vinegar, not cider-- was a little strong). The result was quite tasty, almost a pad-thai like sauce, though when the noodles cooled a bit the sauce got sticky (as peanut butter tends to do). I don't know if it would be as good cold-- it was all gone before it had the chance to cool off that much! Good for a buffet party, where people can take as much or as little as they want-- kind of heavy for a stand-alone side dish or entree.

what a great, simple recipe!  the first time i made this, i used spaghetti as called for in the recipe.  this time, i used rice noodles - a big improvement!  i also added some thinly sliced baby carrots, and used chili/garlic paste in place of the red pepper flakes.  makes it a little bit spicier!

My, this was delicious and very easy to put together with staples I already had in my pantry.  Changes made:  I used 1/2 tsp. ground ginger (I had no fresh and was too lazy to make a trip out to get some); tossed the hot drained pasta with a little toasted sesame oil which really added a depth of flavor; added 2 cloves minced garlic (I felt the dish needed it) and 1 carrot, cut into small matchsticks and sautéed them with the onions; finally, garnished the finished dish with chopped roasted peanuts, additional sliced green onions (green part) and toasted sesame seeds.  Next time I make this I may add chicken strips or some shrimp.  Truly a winning dish.

Love this sauce.  The first time I followed the recipe exactly.  So yummy, and no leftovers.  I really liked the sauce, but I'm trying to stay away from pastas so I tried the sauce with stir fry vegetables.  It was super yummy, and again no left overs.  I had some extra sauce so I froze it for future use.  That worked fine to, it freezes well.  Great recipe, thanks for sharing!

I give this a raving 5 stars -- but keep in mind I made some changes as follows. Because of what I had on hand I used ground ginger and balsamic vinegar. I used egg noodles. I didn't "fry" the onions, but rather, used two green onions entirely, and put them in fresh & chopped. I added lots of corriander and orange peppers and cucumber. Like this, this was deeeelicious, both warm and cold. (As a note, this makes A LOT of sauce, but that's fine by me, as there is some left over for tomorrow! Might use it as a tofu marinade.)

One of my favorites so far. Great tasting and nicely authentic. A great recipe to show off. Like other users, I too recommend some twitches: Add a bit more water, peanut butter, red pepper flakes. Also I used apple cider vinegar, added sesame seeds. DELICIOUS!

This is so good!  I used honey in place of the sugar and doubled the crushed red peppers.  I also added chicken breast and broccoli.  My daughter said it tasted just like the Buddha Bowl at North Star Cafe in Columbus, OH.

Yuk!!! My husband and I both hated this dish. The first few bites were not too bad but it seemed to get thicker and pastier quickly.  We had a tomato sandwich instead.

Nice recipe! I used Vidalia onions (all I had), added sautéed chopped garlic, chunky peanut butter, and a chopped orange bell pepper. Also  used hot sesame oil and rice vinegar. Love it. Thanks.

I made a few changes, so am rating 4 stars in relation to this as a base.  I used rice vinegar instead of cider, used low sodium soy sauce (it's what we had in the cupboard), skipped the white sugar, and added a clove of garlic.  Yummy!  I used the sauce with linguine and cooked chicken, broccoli, carrots and sugar snap peas, so I ended up doubling the sauce.

Yum!! Use brewed green tea instead of plain water. I doubled the ginger and halved the soy sauce, based on other reviews. Udon noodles are the best with this! It's especially good chilled, with sliced cucumbers & cilantro added.

Easy and delicious!  It does need less peanut butter (or more of the wet ingredients) as the recipe as written makes the sauce too thick.  I tried to make it like California Pizza Kitchen's Thai Linguine so I added raw bean sprouts, shredded carrots, and green onions on top along with some peanuts.

Good.  I add seasoned chicken breast, cut in bite size, seasoned with ginger, red pepper, garlic, then browned in some oil .  Then I make the sauce in the same pan as chicken.  I also break the noodles in half bfore cooking, seems to mix easier and easier to handle.  Very yummy dinner.

Delish!  My family loves this dish!  Like some of the others I have added a bit more water and sesame oil and doubled the recipe to make a full pound and 1/4 of pasta.   It is great cold as well my family will eat it straight out of the fridge

I'm not sure if I did something wrong, but I believe I followed the recipe to a tee and it was inedibly salty.  Maybe my soy sauce is nuclear or something. Yow.

My boyfriend and I just cooked this as our first full homemade meal. This dish was delicious! I used ground ginger from a bottle instead of fresh minced ginger root (one third the amount of ginger called for in the recipe) and it was perfectly subtle. The sauce itself might be a little too salty for some, but I thought it was just fine, especially when then mixed with the pasta. Garnish with some scallions from the green onions, and it adds a great touch! Five stars! Very filling.

I thought these were very good; my husband thought they needed to be even spicier, even though I had added 2 little chilis.  I made it as stated except substituted rice vinegar for cider vinegar.  The sauce is just enough for 8 ounces or a package of 250 grams of noodles (I used egg noodles), but make extra if you add vegetables or like a lot of sauce.  I served it with zucchini, carrot, fresh broccoli, and raw peanuts!  Will make again and add even more red pepper flakes and chopped-up chili to make it spicier :)

I tripled this recipe and it fed our family of five. Made alterations suggested by milesofsmiles79 (rice noodles, crunchy peanut butter, 2 eggs scrambled in with the green onions, topped with cilantro).  I did not add the red pepper and did double the sugar to make the recipe more kid friendly. I think my family wants me to make it again tomorrow! Thanks.

Loved loved loved them! They were super quick and easy to make...they tasted even better cold! I did think they were a little salty so I think next time I will use light soy sauce instead. Oh and I was out of ginger and they still tasted great! Thanks for a wonderful vegetarian recipe!

This was great! I didn't use the amount of soy sauce it called for because I ran out, but I made up for the liquid difference with more hot water. It was a little thick at the end so I just added some more hot water until it was the consistency I liked..I also added some chopped peanuts and cilantro at the end. It turned out perfect!

I tried this recipe last night. Wow, it was good. As with the others I made a few changes. I added quite a bit more ginger and peanut butter to the recipe. I also used veg broth instead of water, and added a can of coconut milk! To finish it off, I added some fried tofu, and served it over rice! It was wonderful, and my guests loved it. It tasted just like the peanut stew that we get at our local Thai place!

I have been making these noodles for a couple of years now.  I don't change a thing and it is by far the best I've tried.  They're even good cold the next day for lunch!  Thanks Maureen for this great recipe, it has become a favourite at my house!

Great recipe! I loved the taste/smell of the fresh ginger with the peanut butter. I used whole wheat noodles and although I didn't have any green onions on hand the white onions worked just fine. I added some chopped serrano peppers for heat (we like it hot!) and followed the rest of the recipe exactly. The reason it it did not get five stars is that the sauce was thick and hard to work with when adding the noodles. I had to add more water to it so that it could dilute the sauce and cover the noodles. Other than that, the outcome was very impressive.

It was good.  I put in too much peanut butter (whoops).  Save some of the green parts of the scallions to garnish the top with.  Looks pretty and tastes good!

Easy recipe, and really delicious with a few changes!  Crunchy peanut butter is essential to give the noodles some texture.  I tossed the noodles with 2 tbsp. of sesame oil, but used an additional 1 tbsp. to make the sauce.  I also added 3 minced garlic cloves to the sauce, and switched out the hot water for chicken stock.  Lastly, I substituted the crushed red pepper flakes for 1 tbsp. of hot chili oil (avoid this if you don't want your noodles too spicy).  These changes gave the recipe some depth and texture, and it turned out really well!

This was delish! I used freeze dried chives instead of onion and ginger paste. I forgot the water. The sauce turned out very creamy and with a nice blend of all flavors and a warmth from the red pepper. It really needed more kick though and next time I'll increase the ginger and the red pepper in this dish. Very good, Thanks Maureen!

Let's make things clear : I think I was the most prejudiced person against this recipe. I grew up in France, the first taste of peanut butter I had was a year ago when I moved in NY at 24.
Since I am curious, I tried a sauce based on peanut butter strongly inspired by this recipe : It is amazingly simple and good! I still cant believe I have to admit it. I love the chili idea and the soy sauce in it! I will put a lot of onions next time.

This recipe is excellent.
I highly recommend tripling the ginger, and doubling the crushed red pepper (warning: spicy).  Once the sauce is finished cooking, I rinse, cut, and quickly blanche brocolli in another pan.  Once blanched, toss the brocolli in the sauce to coat, then mix with noodles.  Absolutely delicious.

My husband and I liked this recipe after it had been tweaked.  I used many of the previous suggestions...Toasted seaseme seeds, sliced grilled chicken breast, snap peas, and sprouts.  My own tweaks, I used reduced fat peanut butter and low sodium soy sauce, and I let the whole thing sit and chill overnight.  Before serving I let it come to room temperature.

I reduced the soy and peanut butter per others directions figuring I could always add more later.

Gross. Perhaps I've eatten too much Thai and Chinese in my life, but this stuff could not compete. The dish tasted like peanutbutter on speghetti noodles.

This recipe just needs a little tweeking to bring it up to 5 stars. You can address the "too thick" and "too salty" by cutting back to a 1/4 cup of both pb and soy sauce, also use a reduced sodium soy sauce. A TBSPN of red pepper sauce (Frank's Red Hot) adds another level of complexity to the flavor. Finally, to turn this dish into a meal - add a (cooked) diced chicken breast or a handful of diced tofu,  sauteed shredded carrots, peas, and beansprouts.  Sprinkle with sesame seeds and a garnish of cilantro. YUM!

This dish was a disaster!  My husband tried two bites and couldn't eat anymore.  My kids tried to like it but gave up.  It was way too sticky.  I followed the recipe exactly as written but it didn't turn out as expected.  I won't try this one again.

I tried the modifications the reviews suggested (half the soy sauce, double the ginger, extra peanut butter, add garlic).  Beautiful!  I ate it until I thought my stomach would burst.

Wonderful! Used low-sodium soy and added a couple cloves of garlic. Next time I'll probably use hot chili oil instead of red pepper flakes and rice vinegar instead of cider vinegar and chunky peanut butter for texture. It will be a great base to add chicken or vegetables. These are ingredients I always have in the house so it's great for a quick and easy meal!

This is a good starter recipe for Pad Thai type noodles.  I diced 4 chicken thighs and sauteed them in some canola oil, then added the onion, garlic and ginger.  I used a large clove of garlic and about a tablespoon of chopped ginger.  The rest of the ingredients were pretty much as written except I omitted the sugar and used low sodium soy sauce.  I used 8 oz whole whole wheat thin spaghetti and tossed the sauce over it, adding more water as needed.  We like more heat, so I added more red pepper flakes. To add a bit more flavor, I added 1/4 C chopped peanuts and about 1/4 cup chopped cilantro and topped with some of the sliced green onion tops.  I think my peanut butter was a bit old, so next time I'll be sure to use fresh to improve the peanut taste.  Some siracha would also be a plus.

Pretty good! Used a smooth peanut butter, eyeballed most of the ingredients because I was making three things at once and didn't want to take the time, and we were all pretty happy with it! Will use as a side again. I did save about half the green onions to use as a garnish at the end, it looks quite lovely.

I thought the recipe was great, we added chicken and doubled it, even though it was just for my husband and I.  It was a little spicy for my taste, and I'm nursing so I try not to eat anything too spicy.  Next time we will use less red pepper flakes.

For such an easy, uncomplicated recipe this sure packs a tasty punch, No tweaking needed unless you want more ginger, pepper flakes, etc. due to personal taste.  I tried the dish cold and hot and loved it both ways.  Thank you for sharing!

These were very one-dimensional, with the peanut butter being overpowering. The sauce was very thick and coated the noodles to the point of being overpowering in texture. I thinned this with a little pasta water and still found it to be too thick.

We liked this - took it to a potluck and most people liked it a lot.  I thougth the vinegar was a little strong, and would use rice vinegar next time rather than cider vinegar.  All-in-all a good recipe, and I'll make it again, thanks for the posting!

Okay, followed the directions yet mine came out dark brown not the pretty golden colour like the pics!  Regardless, the taste was odd and lacking something so not going to be making this again.

The sauce was pretty good. I wasn't enthusiastic about the noodle consistency. Generally I use a rice noodle or some kind of asian noodle for peanut noodles. I didn't like the texture of the spaghetti for peanut noodles. That is definitely something I would change.

WAY to salty, the flavors just didn't blend well together, and the spaghetti noodles just did not go well, maybe next time i will use rice noodles and a totally differant recipe for the peanut sauce.

Followed the recipe exactly (without reading the reviews - what a mistake!).  The sauce has WAY too much peanut butter in it and the overall flavor was not appetizing.  Very disappointing...

Even my kids love this "peanut butter spaghetti" and ask for more. The only change I make is to use crunchy peanut butter, like some others, because I loke the crunch. This is really good with chicken satay as a side, for people like my husband who have to have meat with every meal. The recipes have a lot of the same ingredients, so it's easy to combine shopping and preparation of the 2 dishes.

This recipe is awesome.  My husband loved the noodles - asked me to make them again less than a week later.  The kids liked them too (yay!).  I fried some tofu cubes in olive oil and added them to the peanut sauce a few minutes before I added the noodles - yum!

A new favorite. This tastes just like my favorite sesame noodles dish from Chinese restaurants. My fiance and I finished the whole thing! I doubled the green onions (and included more than just the white parts). Next time, I'll add shrimp or chicken. This was good with a side of broccoli.

Great recipe!!! I substituted soy butter for the peanut butter due to my father's diet restrictions. I also stir fried vegetables (garlic, pea pods, straw mushrooms and edamame).  Instead of cayenne, I stir fried the vegetables and pasta with srirachi hot chili sauce, then stirred in the peanut sauce. Major kudos from my family.

Really tasty and great "comfort food" (kind of sweet).  I didn't have ginger on hand, but it prob would have been great.  I added a small can of manderin oranges with the juice and served with just a little bit of coconut.  Yummy!

Yum! I'm eating it right now! The changes I made were I ommited the vinegar (I didn't have any apple cider vinegar on hand), I doubled the ginger, and I added frozen veges. It's got a lot of flavor, and I don't think it's too thick. I'll be having this for lunch tomorrow! Thanks for the recipe!

Good flavor.  I didn't find the sauce too thick at all, although I didn't use all of it and I had probably more than 8 oz. of noodles.  Next time I might cut back on the sesame oil just a bit.

This is too heavy.  You can't even suck up the noodles through your lips without having a big blob of goo hanging off you bottom lip.  My peanutbutter lovin' kids were excused from having to even finish it.  Will hunt for a better recipe.

If I could give this recipe a 10 I would. It is perfect. I had tried a sauce similar to this a few years ago and have been craving it ever since and this was very close. I just added a little more red pepper flakes to it. Don't be intimidated by peanut butter and noodles, they are wonderful together in this recipe. Thanx so much Maureen! This is a keeper!

Delicous.. with a few adjustments.. definetly the sauce could be to much if you don't cook enough pasta or add extras like veggies and/or chicken ect. I cooked enough pasta for 3 plus added brocoli and peppers and still only used half the sauce.. I just mixed a bit in at a time while mixing till I had the right consistency.. otherwise it was great!! Would definetly make again.

The recipe alone fairs okay but with some added fresh garlic, julienned carrots and cucumbers and 2 more teaspoons of sugar it really packed a punch! Much more peferable cold.

Very good recipe.  I only gave it 4 stars though because it's more of a base recipe.  In other words, the next time I make it I will add carrots, maybe some chicken etc.  There's a lot of potential here.  Of course, it's good even without the meat and vegetables...but I know it would be even better WITH them.  CHANGES I MADE: I put the ginger in with the soy sauce-peanut butter sauce...and used a blender to mix it up well.  I also added a bit more sugar. I didn't have any problems with the sauce. It was the right amount and the right consistency.

I love this recipe! I've made it three times already. I love the ginger and green onions--they really add something to the dish. I also like to add a little bit of scrambled egg, too (I guess because this is a little like Pad Thai and I've had Pad Thai with egg in it).  I'm waiting to try this dish with crunchy peanut butter sometime!

I've made this too many times to count now. I always double the recipe.  My husband doesn't like ginger, so I leave that out. My son doesn't like hot pepper, so my husband and I sprinkle it on at the table.  I garnish with slice green onions and serve this with steamed brocolli and carrot sticks.  It is a very tasty meal that very quickly and frugally satisfies my craving some something Asian.  Thanks!

Was an awesome recipe, but not NEARLY enough liquids (water nor soy sauce). I ended up with a sticky paste untill I put a significant ammount more water and soy sauce to thin out the paste.  Overall it was very tasty!

I LOVE THESE! I'd been looking for a recipe like this. To avoid stickiness, I tossed the cooked, drained spaghetti with 1 T. of the sesame oil.(I just used the remaining 1 T. to saute' the onions in.) I also used organic peanut butter. Oh, & toasted sesame oil. 1,000 thank yous, Maureen!

One of my favorite make-ahead dishes.  Truly good as a hot or cold dish.  I have added water chestnuts/cucumbers/celery or any seasonal vegetable to give it an added crunch.

Delicious. We loved it. I served it with the Asian broccoli slaw from this site. Fast, yummy and inexpensive. The trifecta!

This was pretty good.  I reduced the serving size to 1 and made it for my lunch.  I used three fairly large green onions, crunchy peanut butter and rice wine vinegar instead of apple cider vinegar.  Overall it was good but not quite sweet enough for me.  I also couldn't taste the onions or ginger.  I did not find it salty at all.

This was terrible.  I followed the recipe and the dish was just way too salty. I should have used less soy sauce or low sodium soy sauce.

I love to make the sauce portion of this recipe and just serve it over steamed greens. It's so flavorful and keeps for a few days in the fridge.

I can only give it 4 instead of 5 because I (like others) tweaked the recipe. Very good base recipe, I doubled the ginger and red pepper flakes to suit our tastes. It's a nice recipe with ingredients that are lying around the house. I used the Thai noodles instead of spaghetti.

I was jonesing for peanut noodles, this was just the RIGHT ONE!  I  I actually made about 4 x's the amount, 2 boxes if linguine since I was taking the bulk of it to potluck @ work. My kids & the Co workers LOVED this! I added shredded chicken and chopped broccoli to make it a main dish. A couple teaspoons of 5 Spice powder was a Fab idea too! Of course I used Xtra chunky peanutbutter;) Maureen, this was a WINNER WINNER peanut butter chicken Dinner!! Thank you

I think I'd need to add a little less soy sauce, it was pretty salty  otherwise. I would fry up some chicken with this.

Was very good. I substituted the cider vinegar with rice vinegar.   My only negative comment is I thought it was dry and thick. Needs either more oil or water. I will make this again and adjust accordingly.

We liked it very much.  Next time I will get sesame oil.  I used 1 T of Olive and 1 T of roasted sesame seeds.

I wanted to keep the czarbs down so instead of Noodles I used Quinoa and mixed it with the sauce.  Used Splenda instead of sugar.

This is a fan-freaking-tastic recipe. Look at the method and know your own tastes before attempting: I cut down on the soy, added tons more ginger and red pepper, switched out brown sugar for the white. What impressed me most is how creamy the sauce was using the method described. I made a full batch just so I'd have cold noodles all weekend for lunches at work.

I made the mistake of using natural peanut butter so it was a bit bland, as I also cut back the soy sauce as some people suggested. I added a bit of teriyaki sauce which brought it some more sweetness and saltiness which improved the tasted greatly. I liked it much better cold than hot. I threw some broccoli and mushrooms into the mix to make it feel more like a meal and it worked very well.

So delicious with some change.  Replace sugar & vinegar w/honey.  Add red peppers, increase peanut butter to 1/2 c. and top with fresh lime juice & plenty of minced ginger! (Make sure to use reduced sodium soy sauce to decrease saltiness.)

I really liked this, but the sesame oil was overpowering.  I will reduce that by half next time, maybe substitute some canola oil.  I ended up adding some brown sugar after it was cooked to make it more palatable to my kids.  They really liked it.

The girls in the house did not like it at all, the teenage boy really liked it, the other boys were indifferent and wanted less peanut butter in it at least.  Since I cooked it and I'm a girl, while it was fun to try, I won't make it again.

This is really good and easy.  The only change I made was using 1 tsp sriracha sauce instead of crushed red pepper flakes. (Sriracha is a Thai hot sauce that can be found in the Asian food isle but if you can't find it, red pepper flakes is a good substitute.)

I have been looking for a similar recipe to Thai style noodles. This was it! I used rice noodles and creamy peanut butter and just a bit more red pepper than the recipe required. We loved it! It turned out delicious! I used more sesame seeds, too, because I loved them. I doubled the recipe so we had a lot of left overs. Rice noodles do not keep their shape when reheated, but certainly hold their taste. Will be a frequent dish in our kitchen.

This is really good, but VERY peanut buttery! I followed the recipe, except that I made an entire 13 ounce (or so) package of whole wheat spaghetti and I used less soy sauce and more vinegar, red pepper flakes,  and sugar to taste. I also added toasted sesame seeds, sliced snow peas, carrots, and cilantro. The sauce was a bit thick, so I also added more water until I got the consistency I liked. It's a great recipe that can be changed according to your preferences.

Only had crunchy peanut butter and I'm so glad...added another little bit of texture!  Added a bit more ginger and a touch more sesame oil at the end to heighten the flavor.  Also - made with gluten free brown rice spaghetti and you'd never know!

Quick and easy, added pan fried tempeh for extra protein and nutrition.  We doubled the recipe so we would have lunch leftovers.  I also used brown rice noodles but might try soba next time.  My husband and daughter both gobbled it up.

I made this for my family and (even as picky as all 8 of them are) it was incredible. The house smelled amazing and this paired perfectly with "Egg Drop Soup I" (http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Egg-Drop-Soup-I/Detail.aspx?event8=1&prop24=SR_Thumb&e11=egg%20drop%20soup&e8=Quick%20Search&event10=1&e7=Recipe) Both are highly recommended and I will certainly be making them again! Thank you so much for posting!

the sauce is quite thick i added less soy sauce. the recipe tastes much better with honey instead of sugar, also rinse your noodles in very cold water until cold, then toss in with sauce( tastes much better when cold) :)

This was a great tasting sauce for the noodles. We did have on regular noodles and half on gluten free (corn) spaghetti. We omitted the ginger. We ate it hot and added eggplant and other vegetables but it would probably be good as a cold dish too.

Used ground ginger for lack of fresh stuff and it turned out tasty. Heed the "too salty" warnings, I only have dark soy sauce which is way saltier, and used less than a 1/4 cup and it was just right!

I mostly followed the recipe, so I can't speak to the exact proportions.  I decreased the soy sauce based on other reviews, and used powdered ginger since I didn't have fresh.  I added tofu since I wanted more than just the noodles.  My sauce ended up being thicker than I had thought it would be, but I thinned it out some with more water.  I liked the taste, and will continue to make it, probably with some small changes like adding vegetables.  A great recipe to work with.

don't put in more than 1/4 tsp chilli unless you want it hot. I added garlic and lightly pan roasted peanuts for extra crunch.

We really liked this a lot.  The first time I made it I followed the recipe exactly.  I ended up needing to add more water to the sauce as others have recommended as it does thicken up quite a bit.  After that start I started improvising every time I made it and have now settled on something we really like.  I double the recipe (because it does make a great packable cold lunch).  I use the whites of the onion, but also chop the green and add them into the sauce right before adding the pasta.  I also add in a can of water chestnuts for crunch and I substitute rice wine vinegar for the cider vinegar.  Instead of water, I use a bottle of ginger beer (the first time because I was trying to get rid of it and thought - what the heck - but we liked the flavor it added so now use it all the time.  Right before serving I squirt some fresh lime over the top.  This is a great recipe from which to improvise to your own tastes!

These noodles are decent and are nice and creamy when hot, but the soy sauce flavor is too strong.  I suggest using just 2 T soy sauce and adding 2 extra T hot water.  You may need to add a little salt if you do this, but hopefully the soy won't cover the other flavors.  Will definitely try this again with a few more tweaks because it has lots of promise.  Oh and whole wheat spaghetti worked with it really well, you couldn't really tell it was whole wheat.

Yummy! I tripled the sauce, lessened the amount of water and added sliced green peppers and a tsp of minced garlic to the sautee. Then I mixed the sauce and 16 oz of noodles. Added 3 baked chicken breasts shredded and steamed brocolli. Oh and I used ginger paste instead of fresh. It was deeelicious!  Thank you for this recipe.

These were peanut "butter" noodles.  Too much peanut butter and all together too much sauce for 8 ozs of noodles. They were so heavy.  I really had to improvise to pull this one off.  To do so, I boiled a 2nd batch of noodles (another 8 ozs) in chicken stock and I added garlic, soy sauce and sherry to the water.  I squeezed part of a lime when I tossed in the additional noodles and spooned some of the seasoned boiling water in.  I also used the whole green onion....would never discard the tops.  Upon looking at other recipes before rating this on other cooking webs, I noticed soy and peanut butter tend to be equal measurements.  I'd agree or even go heavier on soy. On the positive....it was an okay base recipe, but plan on improvising.

Picky family did not care for this. The sauce seemed too thick, after reading other reviewers, I would also use far less peanut butter IF I made this a second time.

Add diced white chicken,garlic, shredded carrots and thai garlic chili paste instead of pepper flakes. I left out the sugar, I didn't think it needed to be sweeter. I also used whole wheat pasta to add fiber. Tasty dish, and it goes along way.

I found this recipe to have too much peanut butter for my taste, next time I'll use a little bit less.  I added cooked veggies as well.  
This is a very quick meal and was easy to make after coming home from work to three hungry children.  My husband and co-worker also had dinner with us and they LOVED it.  They would have loved some chicken or steak in it.

This is a great sauce that is both easy and tasty.  My only (small) complaint is that you do need to add more hot water than what the recipe calls for, or else it will be difficult to get the sauce to cover all of the noodles. Next time I make this I think I'll add some veggies as well.  Thanks :)

I agree with the previous commenter.  This is a great base recipe, but it needs vegetables.  I added onion, broccoli, red peppers, sugar snap peas, and baby corn (frozen "Asian blend").  Delicious!

This dish was great! Really quick and easy to make- delicious hot or cold. I prefer to add fresh green onions rather than frying them in oil first- for a much fresher taste. This recipe makes a lot of sauce so don't skimp on the pasta! I'd like to eat this dish more often, so I'm going to play around with the recipe to make it a bit healthier!

Seemed like this was missing something.  It came out gooey, and stuck together.  Seemed as if it needed more "liquid".  I won't make this again.

This recipe is great, it's quick and the ingredients are usually on hand. As others have noted, you can adjust the recipe to suit your taste, I added garlic and more than tripled the ginger, and increased the red pepper flakes.

I found this was only okay. I did try to cut down the recipe as I was only making it for me. The taste was quite good, but the sauce was very thick. Next time I will water it down more.

Really good. My vegetarian daughter loved this. Will make it again. I added more red pepper flakes since she likes it spicy.

My husband and I loved this dish, but my preschoolers were unimpressed.  I added some frozen stir fry veggies, and it made a delicious vegetarian main dish.  A nice change of pace from other pasta dishes.

This was good, but in my opinion had too much peanut butter.  It was more on the peanut butter and jelly side.  I added more vinegar the 2nd time and it was much better.

This is a really good, if slightly too heavy recipe.  I change it by doubling the sauce and adding stir fried vegetables.  It lightens the dish and makes it more flavorful.

This was yummy. I added a handful of steamed broccoli and some extra-firm tofu to make a meal out of it. Didn't have any fresh ginger so I just used ginger powder, and it still tasted good (next time I'll use the real thing though). Very filling.

I made the recipe as is only cutting back on the red pepper flakes by 1/2. I added chicken and broccoli as one reviewer suggested and it was a big hit with the whole family. The only thing I would do differently is double it for leftovers....YUM

So good, my boyfriend asked for it again less than a week later.  I didn't have any ginger or onions, so i just left them out and it still tasted great.  I also didn't have any red pepper, but i cut up and added in some spicy faux chicken wings for an extra kick.  i used tahini instead of sesame oil because that was all i had, and doubled the peanut butter and water.  also tossed in some broccoli.  The first time i had crunchy peanut butter, YUM! Threw in some extra peanuts the second time.  With the wings in there this made enough that i could only eat half (of my half)...the other half i ate cold later, and boy was it good then too.

Tweaked it a bit. I like hot sauce in mine and I used a little ginger, lemongrass, cilantro, red pepper and garlic that you can get in tubes in the produce section. Just a squeese of each. I also used a heaping 1/2 cup of peanut butter and just a little bit of the sesame oil (a few drops). 
I also did not add the onion. I used raw green onions and cucumber. 
It is all personal taste but this is a great base.

I love peanut-sesame noodles but was really dissapointed with these.  I reduced the soy sauce as others mentioned but still found the sauce way too salty - the soy sauce basically overwhelmed the sesame and peanut flavors.  I'll be looking for a different recipe; if I do try this one again, I'll only add 1 T of soy sauce or perhaps just sprinkle a bit on top of the finished dish.

I did like this but it seemed like something was missing.  I liked the fact there was no coconut milk in this because this dish is already high in calories. I sauted some chicken in garlic and added that to the sauce and then tossed it with the noodles.  I will make this again and play with it a little to get the ratios just right to our taste, but it was a good start! Thanks for the recipe!

This has so many different tastes all at once!  The only changes I made were to add some chicken, hubby likes meat in his meals, and I 1/2 the soy sauce as I am not a fan.  The sesame oil and fresh ginger were a must, wouldn't taste the same without them.  Also, I used Korean red pepper flakes which were very good.

The sauce is delicious if you love peanut sauce.  I like my peanut noodles cold, but this sauce doesn't hold up well cooled.  I would suggest cooking the noodles and refrigerating them overnight and then tossing them with the freshly made sauce.

My husband and I have been trying peanut noodle recipe over the years and never quite gotten it right--until now-- We both loved this recipe. We used whole wheat spaghetti and it tasted great. Quick and easy to make--it will be a standard in our
house. Thanks!!

My fiance loved this dish, but it's a little too peanut-y for me. I used 1 tbs ginger, but next time I'll use more scallions, 1 tbs sesame oil and 1/4 cup peanut butter.

Delicious and easy!  I recommend cutting the amount of soy sauce in half and getting white chocolate peanut butter for reduced sodium and sweeter effect.

Really good!  I followed suggestions from prior reviews and tripled the ginger and doubled the red pepper.  I didn't have cider vinegar so I substituted rice wine vinegar, and I used whole wheat spaghetti and natural peanut butter because that's what I had on hand.  The next time I make this I'll saute some garlic along with the onions and ginger, and reduce the peanut butter just slightly.  I'll also add veggies and/or chicken as other reviewers suggested.

I love nutty asian food, but this came out gummy and heavy.  I ended up adding a lot of extra liquid to thin it down some.  I may experiment with it, because the flavor combination wasn't bad...just the consistency that turned us off.

This recipe makes a quick and easy lunch.  I served it with a salad.  My kids and I liked it, but my husband wasn't too crazy about it.  I think he would have liked it better if I added stir fried chicken.  It was to plain for his taste.  Since he's my number one taste tester I have to give it four stars.

Good, but nothing spectacular.  Found this to be quite salty - if I make it again I would definately add more sugar.  Topped  with beansprouts and shreds of carrot which was a nice addition.  Very filling.

I love this recipe, i've been using it for a few years, just never got around to reviewing it.  I don't like a lot of salt, so I cut down on the soy sauce.

This was a very good recipe !! even my picky husband liked it. Next time I would coat the cooked noodles with a little bit of olive oil to keep the thickness down a bit, also I doubled the  hot water. Also Next time I would make a bunch of steamed veggies (My husband wont eat them ), for the top. Cant wait for the fresh cilantro from the garden !!

I used Lo Mein noodles and I forgot to buy real ginger so I used dried/ground.  Turned out great.  I also added cilantro, bean sprouts, water chesnuts, and baby corn.  My whole family loved it.

This was excellent!  A local chinese place here has a dish called "peanut butter chicken" and is very similar to this--my favorite! (I did add cut, sliced chicken breasts to this recipe and sprinkled a few green onion tops over before serving). my family loved it and it was easy to make.

We liked this. Next time, I would break the spaghetti noodles smaller. Added fresh cilantro and a little more crushed red pepper because we like spicy dishes. Simple to prepare.

This is a decent base recipe but I just couldn't get it the way I wanted.  After making it 4 or 5 times and still not being thrilled with it, I tried the 'peanut butter noodles' on this site which I like much better.  If you do decide to try these, make sure to increase the liquid amount - otherwise these get horribly sticky very quickly.

I've made these noodles a few times now only modifying the onion type and it's come out great every time.  I don't know why some have had so many problems with consistency.  I keep a low heat under it while coating the noodles, it really helps coat them while keeping the peanut butter mixture creamy.  No sticky masses here!  

Will continue to make this recipie and I've given it to many friends to try.  

Great recipie!!!

This turned out really well for me, although I did have to substitute part of a yellow onion for the green, and garlic for the ginger. I also used lime juice instead of the vinegar, and added some sesame seeds to the sauce-- I didn't have any problems with the thickness of the sauce, and I used the proportions of liquids given in the recipe.

I was hoping for something light and tasty, but this recipe was just a giant blob of spicy peanut butter with noodles in it.  As thick and heavy as it was when it was hot, I can only imagine what it would look like cold: a solid, brain-like mass.  It MIGHT be better if you use half the peanut butter and/or twice the noodles, but I'm not willing to make it again to find out.

We were not too crazy about these. I even got some sesame oil and fresh ginger just to try the recipe. They were sticky, and we just didn't care for it enough to make again. Sorry.

This was a good all-around peanut sauce, though I was expecting something a bit thicker.  I used it over rice noodles and it turned out well.

I read some reviews, and here's what I followed: definitely cut the soy sauce in half. I used low sodium based on my personal preferences. I used extra ginger and scallions too...this dish has always been one of my favorites and you can't get it in all Chinese restaurants...but now I can have it whenever I want to!

My Southern fried husband had four helpings! I sauteed chicken and a veggie mix and added them to the finished sauce and served with chopped peanuts on top. I used SDTERP’s quantity modifications for ginger, garlic and sesame oil.  This was great. We will definitely make this again. Thank you for sharing!

Too peanut butter...we used natural peanut butter which may have been the reason.  If we make it again we'll decrease the PB and increase the hot water so the texture is less PB and more sauce..

This is a fantastic recipe - super easy, quick, and can be modified to taste in so many ways. I had low sodium tamari instead of soy, used the entire green onion, and used a ginger paste instead of minced. I will make this again and try adding some chicken, too. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Yum! Good made as directed-even better with more peanut butter and heat! A couple of cloves of minced garlic help it all along, too. Fresh or frozen peas make it taste like something from an Asian restaurant, and add some texture. Thanks-will be making this often.

Used light soy sauce instead but still found it too salty. Added 2 tablespoons of brown sugar at the end  and this mellowed it perfectly. Added my veges at the same time as the ginger and sauted them lightly instead of adding them raw at the end. Would be happy enough to make this dish again with those minor changes.

I made this receipe pretty much as written but did use low sodium soy sauce and a bit less. Flavor wise it was delicious and you do get a big taste of the ginger. It did turn out as a thick sauce but I myself liked it that way. Does need a little something though to cut back on that ginger taste. All in all it is a very good dish and will definitely make it again with maybe chicken added and peanuts as someone said in previous review.

A chef at a camp I worked at made peanut noodles for lunch ONCE, and I haven't seen them anywhere since which was disappointing, to say the least (admittedly, I don't generally like oriental-type foods). This recipe absolutely satisfied that craving, and I'll definitely be adding some veggies next time. I didn't have any ginger on hand, so I used a splash of lemon juice and a 1\4 tsp of minced garlic and it's just what I wanted.

I was a little skeptical of using spaghetti in a Thai dish, but you'd honestly never know the difference. My husband hates peanuts and even he liked it.

Loved it. Used powdered peanut butter and added frozen veggies. Then added Thai Chicken Meatballs to it.

Great basic recipe. I  did add 1 tablespoon minced garlic and 1/2 cup thinly sliced carrots. My hubby's first peanut noodles dish and he ate 3 helpings, so I will be making it again. Next time I'm going to add some grilled teriyaki cooked and sliced chicken breast.

My family loves this vegan recipe. Since my kids and their friends went off to college, I make the sauce and give it to them so they can make noodles or pour it over ramen for a quick meal. I add all sorts of veggies as they are available. Fabulous recipe!

In my opinion, this dish is super rich and salty so i would recommend putting less peanut butter and/or soy sauce. I personally cut up some of the green part of the onion and sprinkled it over the top to add some freshness. I would probably add carrots or tofu to it as well next time. Amazing recipe.

Pretty tasty.  I added some garlic powder and used red onion because that's what I had on hand.  I also added some julienne carrots and bell pepper.  Definitely use chunky peanut butter; it needs the crunch.  I also added a bit more peanut butter than is called for.

Great recipe. I threw in some extra zucchini, carrots, and shrimp to the recipe just because it was lying around. Only change I made was to double the sugar and throw in some fresh basil and cilantro. Quick easy and delicious

7.10.17  OK, I’ll admit this is a nutritional splurge for me in almost every respect, but all things in moderation, right?  I did add some red and yellow sliced bell peppers, sugar snap peas, and a garnish of peanuts, otherwise, followed the recipe.  This was good warm, but we enjoyed it as a cold side dish for dinner.

I used this recipe for the sauce alone, really.  I used rice stick noodle instead of a pasta noodle, and I added chicken, broccoli, and red pepper.  I also didn't have cider vinegar but had rice vinegar so I used that in its place. My family loved this dish with the adjustments I made.  I will definitely be making it again!

Unfortunately this recipe was not a family favorite at our home.  I added 1/2 cup of peanut butter instead of 1/3 and it tasted too strong, also the color was not appetizing as a result.  I should have stuck to the recipe :(

I used reduced sodium soy sauce but otherwise followed the recipe and it was delicious! I could eat these all day. As some of the pictures suggest, the green parts of the green onions make a tasty garnish and provide good contrast.

Quick, easy, and delicious. This recipe is the only thing that makes whole-grain pasta palatable to me! Although I find the flavor of the pasta bland, its texture is perfect for this recipe. Great sauce for leftovers, instead of throwing them out. I serve the noodles cold, with warm sauce.

Pretty good! Though, I did feel a bit ill eating the noodles by themselves, with all that peanut butter. But I would definitely recommend this recipe with some other cooked or sauteed veggies to accompany the noodles!

The dish was only ok for us. We love peanuts and peanut butter so I had high hopes for this as a side dish.  Sauce was too thick and over powered the other ingredients.  I could have thinned it, but I didn't realize the problem until it was already served.

I made this as is and it was very good warm. However, I found it bound up when I chilled it. My kids added some Very Teriyaki sauce to it when it was chilled and that loosened it up, and they loved it. I think this is best when its warm and it is quite tasty.

Weirdly good!  Prepared according to the recipe, but I was out of cider vinegar, so used half rice vinegar and half white wine vinegar.  Also had no sesame oil but toasted some sesame seeds myself.  I'll make this again!

Good.  I will make this again and change the proportions to fit our taste. I thought the peanut butter taste was a tad to strong.  Next time I may use 1/4 cup. I thought a little more kick was needed. More pepper flakes. But that's to fit our personal tastes.  It's a good base recipe

I made this with udon noodles but didn't rinse them well so it was a bit starchy.  The sauce was okay but I will tweak the proportions next time - less cider vinegar and a wee bit less chili and many more scallions.  I also added some coarsely chopped peanuts  which were nice.  This is going to be a good launching point for my future peanut noodles, but quite varied from this one.

I think it worked great. Like the veggie addition mentioned in video. I dropped the carrots and used two colors of bell peppers. I blanched snap peas 3 min and bell peppers 90sec.

Delicious. Followed many of KK's modifications, didn't really measure, but aimed for similar proportions except doubled the sauce for same amount of noodles. Added some steamed broccoli and sauteed some sliced baby bok choi with the green onions; added some scrambled eggs to add a bit of protein.

I doubled the recipe and added one bell pepper and a couple handfuls of frozen green peas for color.  It was fantastic!  Ate it hot and cold and both were equally tasty.  Next time, I'll try sugar snap peas.

A great, quick, nutritious meal.  We like spicier food, so I added a large clove of garlic and a full teaspoon of chili flakes.  Everyone loved it.

I am absolutely obsessed in Chinese cooking and baking. I don't know how, but those people make some of the best stuff on earth!!! I looked at this recipe a few times, but I was looking for a different Asian peanut noodle recipe, and I'm a very determined person. Anyway, today, I finally printed it and started sizzling up the skillet. I didn't have sesame oil, or peanut oil, olive oil, vegetable oil, or even butter for that matter, but, like I said, I am very determined, and I made peanut oil (I drained the top layer of oil from the peanut butter *lol*). Instead of sugar I used maple syrup. A splash of it did the trick. With the noodles, I boiled them until Al dente on high, turned it to low, and just let them simmer for the rest of the time, until combining with the sauce. And when I did, MAN! It was good!!!!! I will definitely be making this again. If I can find more recipes like this, I might seriously consider going vegetarian!!!

Very tasty! I'm not a fan of soy sauce so I halved it. Next time I will do as other people did and add vegetables and tweak to my taste (sesame seeds, more pepper flakes etc.)

Loved this.  I was looking for a peanut noodle sauce and this was perfect.  This will be my go to peanut sauce recipe.  I  added in all my fridge "had to go " stuff, cabbage, cilantro,carrots,multi _colored peppers. The sauce is the bomb ( as my daughter would say )  ,Add in anything that trips your trigger it'll be great.

I increased all of the spices, added some fish sauce, and made sure to add more water if it cooked off so it wasn't too thick. Turned out better than my other attempts at peanut noodles.

Doubled the sauce, used only 1/2 the soy sauce, added cilantro with onions during sauté. Also added in slices of leftover pork chops to the sauce before serving. The family loved it!

Absolutely love this recipe! easy to make! just the matter of putting things together whisk whisk whisk and dinner is served! 

I would recommend to add 1 whole tablespoon of minced ginger instead of 1 teaspoon. Add a tad more sugar if you are using Adam's peanut butter. serve over a bed of baby spinach is the best way to go!

As is there is way too much peanut sauce for 8 oz of pasta.  Definitely spoon a little at a time into your hot noodles to suit your taste.  I used only half the sauce.  I made the recipe  as written except I used 1/2 tsp of powdered ginger.  The peanut flavor was overpowering.  I might make this again but I would increase everything except sesame oil and sugar and decrease the peanut butter.  I sprinkled more vinegar over the noodles and it improved the too strong peanut flavor.

Great starter recipe.  I added a bunch of veggies to make it a more balanced meal instead of a delicious side.  I used low sodium soy, added juice of a lime and one each: red pepper, carrot, zucchini in matchsticks.  A touch of fresh Thai Basil or parsley really makes it pop too!

These noodles are delicious. I like that it's equally good hot, cold or room temperature. I don't care for ginger so I omitted it. I minced 3 cloves of garlic and softened it with the green onions. I have made it with and without the vinegar and have not been able to tell a difference. I use 1/2 cup of chunky peanut butter, and about 1.5 Tablespoons of honey in addition to the sugar because I like my sauce a bit sweeter. The sesame oil is imperative; you miss a huge layer of flavor if it's not included. I use lo mein noodles, about 12 ounces for the amount of sauce in the basic recipe. Thanks for this excellent recipe.

Recipe says to only use the white part of the green onion (unlike the picture used to represent the recipe) which is a silly decision. They're green onions. Use the green too - trust me. A bit salty for my taste but otherwise passable.

I make this all the time and my family loves it. Often leave out the pepper flakes for sensitive kids. Sometimes I cook collard greens with the noodles.

This is an easy recipe that tastes good. I pretty much followed the recipe except for using tamari sauce instead of soy sauce and using a bit less sesame oil than is called for in the recipe. I thought that it was tasty. Some members of the family thought that I should have added a bit more water to the sauce, which I will do next time. All in all, an easy, tasty, "unique" noodle dish.

I love this recipe because it is so easy to make and yet tastes really great. I have made it as is and also once adding more vegetables to it. It was delicious both ways.

OMG this was so easy to make and tastes just heavenly.  I did make some changes such as using low sodium soy sauce.  I also used the whole green onion and added garlic.  I don't measure things I just do it to taste.  Love this and will make again.

I don't mind salty, so I did it exactly as written and liked it a lot! I threw in some tofu too and there was enough sauce to cover everything. It is a thick sauce because of the peanut butter, can't really slurp the noodles up, so twirling it around on a fork and eating the whole spiral at once is the way to go!

This was so delicious! Like many people on here, I modified the spices to suit my tastes, and as long as you aren't afraid of tasting/seasoning as you cook you'll be fine. I doubled this recipe and served mine with lime-marinated chicken and it didn't last two whole days. Some of my choice additions: Lots of garlic, crunchy peanut butter, sesame oil, swapped out the soy sauce for fish sauce and used rice noodles instead of spaghetti. Topped it all off with a heap of fresh sliced cucumber, cilantro, and green onions. I wish I had some peanuts to crush and perfect the dish. Highly recommend this for an easy dinner!

I followed recipe except I used crunchy peanut butter and low sodium soy sauce, eating it warm now and I really like it. There is plenty of sauce to cover 12 oz of noodles in my opinion. I think it has much more flavor than the boxed peanut noodles from the grocery stores. Peanutty and spicy flavors balance well.

really enjoyed this recipe. Next time, I won't use as much soy sauce, my version came out rather salty when I used 1/4 cup soy sauce for what the recipe calls for.

I thought this turned out great. To my surprise, my husband LOVED it too. I added a couple of Tbsp of canola oil and hot water to the recipe based on the "dry" reviews. It was plenty moist for us.

Omg, this was DELISIOUS!  I followed the recipe exactly but added some frozen stir-fry veggies, roasted peanuts for extra crunch and seasame seeds, reason why I have it a 4 is because I found the 1/4 C  of Soy sauce to be a bit too much sodium... May decrease the Soy sauce and add more water next time... Oh and I didn't add any ginger as ginger root is hard to find in my local grocery store

1st off I'm not really a cook but I do like to try. I did tweak it some and added chicken breasts to it cut up. Had a guest over for dinner and he asked for seconds so I definitely did something right. Next time I will cut back on the peanut butter but other than that great recipe. I had it for lunch and dinner for almost a whole week.

Thought after the first bite that is was odd, but the more I ate, the more I liked it. I doubled the red pepper flakes because I like my food spicy. Great dish!

Not one of my favs. It required a lot of tweaking- and had I not had the stuff already in my kitchen, I would have been very upset. I don't regret making it, but it's unlikely I would make this again.

Finally got a chance to try this today.  I wish I had read more closely some of the other reviews because (as others have stated), as written, the soy sauce and saltiness is completely overpowering.  I ended up doubling the sauce ingredients, leaving the soy sauce the same, and it made the recipe go up from two stars to four stars (although, in my opinion, it made a little TOO much sauce-to-noodle ratio, so if I make it again, I would make as written except cut the soy down to two tablespoons).  Also, I tried the dish using stir fry noodles, but I think the larger noodles the recipe calls for (either spaghetti or fettucine) would have been better--I also added a bag of  frozen broccoli stir fry vegetables (sauteed) and thought it was a delicious addition.  Oh!  Annnnd I ended up using dried ginger, as it was all I had; while fresh is obviously much better, I thought it tasted fine with the dried.

I loved this dish.  I tweaked this dish as many have. I added some teriyaki sauce and rice vinegar as well.  Very tasty.

I did not like this at all. I followed the recipe without making any changess. I found it bland and dull. The title fits it 
perfectly, it tastes like noodles with peanut butter

I love this malleable recipe because it's a good start.  Some additions I've made (not always altogether) are cilantro, sesame oil, chicken, chopped peanuts (as a main ingredient and as a garnish, toasted sesame seeds or Gomasio (a mix of toasted sesame seeds & sea salt), and/or a snow pea garnish.  Thin strips of red bell pepper are also a nice garnish to add color to what can be a very monochromatic dish.
I use brown sugar instead of white as it adds more depth of flavor.
In step 2, it's helpful to use hot water.  You can get it from your pasta.  The hot water makes it easier to incorporate everything with the peanut butter. 
Finally, I usually add a little minced garlic to the oil and onions at the start of step 2 because I can't seem to cook without it. 
Enjoy!

These are delicious with no changes to the recipe. I've been making peanut noodles for years, and these were just as good as the ones I usually make.

Great recipe. It reminds me of when I lived in Japan. A dish similar to this was very poplar in the summer. It was made with buckwheat noodles and served cold.

Really good and tasty. Very easy and quick to make. I think I would add chopped nuts as a topping to it next time, but otherwise good enough on its own.

I threw matchstick carrots and mini broccoli florets in with the noodles as they cooked to add some veggies to this.  The sauce tasted fantastic in the pan, though I did add things to taste.  Then when I mixed the noodles in, the flavors disappeared into the noodles :(  Too bad, because it looked great garnished with the green onion tops and black sesame seeds.

This was a good recipe...easy and flavorful. I used rice vinegar instead of cider, and a bit more peanut butter. I used my mini food processor to blend the sauce. I'd top the noodles with julienned cucumbers from the garden in the summer.

I loved this recipe.  I omitted the ginger since mine was moldy and it was just fine without it.  My husband raved about them.  I used rice noodles instead of spaghetti noodles.

These were good. I added about 1 more tablespoon of peanut butter. It came out to salty so add less soy sauce than it says. I added finely shredded carrots and pickled radishes and it turned out great.

Because of food allergies in our family we need to tweek most recipes but even so this we wonderful. I used all of the exact proportions as th recipe required though.  Instead of pasta we used rice noodles, Sunbutter in place of the peanut butter, gluten free soy sauce and hot veggie broth in place of the water.  I also threw in leftover grilled chicken and sauted snowpeas.  With a salad, miso soup and Sake it was Asian night at our house last night!

my kids and i made this together today. i thought it was awesome and so did they. i made it almost exactly as stated with low sodium soy sauce.  i saw a lot of people added garlic, but i figured i would try it w/o and see what i thought. i did use chunky peanut butter and that is a good idea.

Great.  Easy.  I added a little more water to the sauce as it was a little think and a bit salty.  But it's a great combination of flavors.  I garnished it with grated carrots and chopped cilantro.

Easy and tasted very good. My only complaint was that the sauce was a bit too salty and not peanut-y enough. I added a little extra peanut butter.

Terrible. Followed the recipe exactly, tasted like a warm salty peanut butter goo. Horrible. Too bad, I was really looking forward to this one.

This was ok, but we like our regular peanut sauce recipe a little better.  I originally cut down on the soy sauce due to reviews saying it was too much, but it was really bland.  I added all the soy sauce and then it was way too salty!  If I make this again, I will try to find somewhere in the middle.  Other than that, this was good.

I added the recommended amount of peanut butter when making this, and the flavor was way too strong. If we make this again, we will add a lot less.

Very quick and easy to make and tasted pretty good.  I used linguine noodles since that's what I had in the pantry.  Also added some cubed rotisserie chicken breast that we had leftover in the fridge.

I made this recipe for take to work lunches. The noodles really absorbed the sauce after sitting and it was a little dry and sticky. Good flavor though.

When I was making the sauce, I did not have high hopes.  For some reason, it did not smell very good to me - especially when I added the soy sauce.  So I put much less soy sauce than the recipe called for.  But for some reason, the finished product was really good!  Mine ended up being a little too sweet - I think because I was using reduced fat crunchy peanut butter - but overall it was a pleasant surprise!

Great recipe to make after work, nice & easy. I cheated, used powdered ginger, scallions instead of onions, no sesame oil replaced w/ olive, honey flavored peanut butter...still yummy. Added some browned shrimp, can you say heaven! Only criticism, the high calories, you got to work it off, darn!

Ho man is this a simple thing to make!  Something you usually always have the stuff lying around for!  I ended up putting way too much red pepper in it, but the extra spice doesn't hurt!    Love it.  I always wanted to make peanut noodles, but I thought they'd be harder to make. Man was I wrong.

Thought there was too much peanut butter, I would suggest a reduction in this ingredient to make more of a sauce texture, instead of warm peanut butter texture.

Delicious! A refreshing change from the tomato-sauced spaghetti we always have. But I've added 1 teaspoon of chilli flakes to give it more kick instead and will be adding more water the next time. Will definitely be cooking this again! =>

I thought that this dish was wonderful but I made a few changes:  I used thin spaghetti Ronzoni brand Smart Taste pasta (12 oz.), minced ginger from a jar because I didn't have fresh (1 Tbsp), added 2 Tbsp. of red onion because I didn't have enough green onion, and 1/4 c. green pepper, both chopped which I fried with the other onions & sesame oil.  Also, I used low sodium soy sauce (just half), reduced fat peanut butter (1/4 cup), and 1/2 c. frozen stir-fry vegetables with carrots, snow peas, etc. (which I added to the boiling pasta in the last 3 minutes).  Then I turned off the pot and used 1/3 c. of the hot pasta water in the sauce but then I had to reduced the sauce.  My daughter doesn't it like hot, so I omitted the red pepper flakes  and she told me that she could tasted the sesame oil but it didn't have a strong peanut taste like she thought it would.  I liked this recipe with the changes and the sauce tasted even better when it cooled off and had more of a peanut taste when cooled which I ate with wheat crackers.  I might add peanuts or crunchy peanut butter next time and coconut milk with maybe fresh coconut.  This is a good "100% Vegan" meal which is hard to find for my daughter and without beans but I might add extra firm tofu fried with the onions to give it more protein.  Thanks for the recipe idea and I am glad I tried it.

The first time I made this, I found the sauce good but a bit thick. The second time, after some adjustments inspired by the reviews, it's one of my new favorites. I added some garlic and fresh shrimp at the beginning along with the green onions. Subbed brown sugar for white, and omitted the vinegar. I also added a can of coconut milk at the end, simmered the whole shebang for about 15 mins. and served over jasmine rice. Delicious! With the coconut milk, I think the proportions of peanut butter and soy sauce are perfect. I'll be using this sauce as a base for chicken, shrimp, mixed veggies, etc. Great flavor!

Too thick and peanutty.  Read the reviews and cut the peanut butter, added water, but still tasted like peanut butter-coated-noodles.  Nope.  Not again.

This was a very nice basic recipe for peanut noodles. I added red bell peppers and carrots for some crunch, plus tofu and garnished with orange slices. Also, I omitted the red pepper flakes since I was serving to a 2-year-old.

I thought this would have more of a thai flavor.  It was VERY peanut butter flavored.  If I ever make it again, I will cut back the peanut butter and add more ginger.

The cider vinegar does not work in this recipe.  Also, it needs more spice.  Something is just off about it.  I'll eat it because I made it, but I won't make it again.

I followed the recipe but made a couple of changes to suit our tastes which was added the green of the onion as well as the white part, halved the soy sauce and made up the quantity with water, the soy I had was particulrly thick and dark but i'm sure a lighter soy would have been fine with the amount stated. I also added fresh finely chopped raw red chili instead of the flakes. Lovely meal and great lunch the next day. I served it as part of a veg chinese meal w/ tofu etc. I had never used 'italian style' pasta as a part of an asian themed meal but it turned out excellent.

This is by far the best Peanut Noodle recipe I have ever tried. It is absolutely delicious. Just a little kick with the hot pepper. Try it..I am sure you will love it!!

Excellent recipe! Made it yesterday for a SuperBowl party. I tripled it for 10 people and it was demolished. I tried adding egg, and wasn't overly psyched with how that worked out. Because the egg made it kind of odd looking, I used a handmixer to mix everything together, and it really brought the sauce together.

Rather ho-hum, but it did its job. Needs lots more spices to enhance the flavor.

Yummy, yummy, yummy! The only change I made was to use ground ginger in place of the fresh.

Good side dish.  The sauce was easy and had a nice consistency for tossing with pasta.  My family really liked it.

Yummy recipe...  I used homeade fettucine noodles.  As another reviewed noted, very similar to one of my fave dishes at a popular restaurant.  They also serve it with julienned carrots and bean sprouts which I think would be a nice addition for next time.

The sauce is much too salty and runny.  There is not enough ginger flavor either. I will not be making this recipe again.

I make this every week -- my fiance and I CANNOT get enough.  I've even made it without the ginger (I realized too late I was out), and it was still delicious.

Great recipe! I used reduced fat - crunchy peanut butter and it turned out great.  To add some  color and crunch i thinly sliced a few cucumbers.  It tasted even better the next day cold!

I didn't have sesame oil or scallions so I used regular oil and a tsp of finely chopped onion and it tasted great - I loved this recipe!
