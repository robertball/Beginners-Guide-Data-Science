Easy to make - The cheesecake layer and pumpkin layer balance one another out equally and are not competing in taste/flavor. I make this dessert every year for friends and family  it's a holiday staple in our home.

I did not make any changes to the original recipe, but since I cook and bake a lot I was not convinced that the cheesecake layer was adequate, and I was right.  Very, very bland.  It had no traditional cheesecake flavor and I would not make this again unless I added something to alter.  Possibly a little Eagle Brand, lemon juice, etc.  The cream cheese, milk and small amount of sugar as directed was just not adequate.

Made according to the recipe but reserved some cheesecake mixture and put it on the top edge and a dollop in the center. Big hit at my house
