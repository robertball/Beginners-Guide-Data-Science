An absolutely wonderful recipe! I went with the sweetened coconut and salted cashews as did some others. Also, since I noticed that many people seemed to have trouble getting the coating to stick, I added a beaten egg to the melted butter. It worked great! I used diced chicken and served it over a bed of lettuce to make Chicken Cashew Salad. Even my somewhat-hard-to-please husband loved it. It's going to be one of our new staple recipes.

This was great. I just finished eating it with my mother and we both adored it. I know this will fast become a regular meal in our house. It was so easy to prepare and took no time at all. We had it with mashed potatoes - what a great combination. I would recommend this to anyone and I will be sharing it with all my friends. The only (very minor) downside was that the cashews were a bit expensive. We're going to try it with peanuts next time.

This is a yummy recipe.  I used smaller pieces of chicken to get more of the cashew coating per bite :)  Also, I marinaded the chicken in coconut milk for a couple of hours prior to cooking to bring out that coconut flavor a little more.  Thanks so much!

I think the type of cracker matters!  I used champagne cracked pepper - not buttery enough I guess.  Maybe Ritz would have been better.  The coating was too thick and crunchy and a bit dry.

I would give it 5 stars with the changes I made. First off I used sweetened coconut, salted cashews, and breadcrumbs, because that is what I had on hand. Before dipping the chicken, I marinated it for and hour and a half in milk with 1/2 tsp. coconut extract. Then I dipped each chicken breast in the melted butter with a beaten egg, then in the cashew mixture. I omitted the salt and pepper since I was using salted cashews.  It cooked beautifully and tasted great! It is one of my husband's new favorites.

Just finished eating this, and it was great! I was so amazed at myself for actually having the right ingredients on hand that I completely forgot that I don't have a food processor. No worries, though, I smashed up the crackers and cashews by hand and threw the coconut in as it was. Fortunately, it still worked! Like many others, I used salted cashews and sweetened coconut. Can't wait to try this with a food processor. =]

Thank you for this recipe!  I added the egg to the melted butter, as another reviewer recommended, and the coating stuck nicely.    The beauty of this recipe is in it's simplicity and flexibility.  It is delicious "as is" but I intend on playing around with it, possibly adding some Allspice or honey or cocoa.    I haven't given the highest rankings to many of dishes on Allrecipes.com but this is a clear exception.

I ran out of ritz crackers, so I substituted panko crumbs. I also used salted cashews and sweetened coconut because that's what I had. I enjoyed this but didn't love it. I think it would be better on fish than chicken.

Used lightly salted cashews and sweetened coconut because that is what I had on hand. Marinated the chicken breasts in coconut milk for several hours and then dredged them directly into the cashew/cracker mix (no butter). The family loved this and requested that I make it again.

This was seriously delicious.  I soaked the chicken in coconut milk for 2 hours, then quickly pan seared them before putting in oven.  Also poured excess butter/egg mixture and marinade in bottom of pan as it baked.  So GOOD!  Glad I doubled the recipe!

Great recipe, have used it twice now and twice I haven't found unsweetened coconut. It works out to only be mildly sweet though, I love this chicken very moist!

Very good recipe, incredibly easy.  Cooked chicken to about 32 minutes, and it came out incredibly moist and tasty, didn't even need salt or pepper, served it with some seasoned rice.  Yes, the breading didn't completely stick, but once baked it stayed on. Great yummy and easy dish, definitely a keeper!

I used coconut oil instead of butter and added raw honey to the oil and used 1/4 cup oat flour instead of crackers.  I'm in love with this one!  served with cooked spinach sprinkled with lime juice.

Only had sweetened coconut and natural pecans...and it was delicious and easy. Had mashed potatoes and a veggie for a quick easy meal. Husband liked it and we will add it to our easy meals collection of recipe! Did not add salt and pepper...it was flavorful, moist and tender. Our oven runs slow so i baked it an additional 10 minutes and let it rest for 5 minutes covered with foil.

I enjoyed this very much and have never had anything quite like it.  Very easy to make.  No trouble with the coating sticking.  Hubby was looking for some type of sauce to put over but I thought it was terrific as-is.

This recipe is absolutely fabulous. I didn't have unsweetend coconut - so I used sweetened. And I used salted cashews - not raw. The combination of sweetness and saltiness was awesome. I also used Ritz crackers. My 7 and 4 year olds loved it. It is hard to get the "breading" to stick so I always push extra on once I have it on the baking tray. Thanks for the great recipe!

It looked pretty, but the taste combination didn't work and the texture was odd. Both my husband and I ended up scraping the breading mix off of the chicken so we could eat it.

The chicken was delicious and super easy to make, but I'd give this a 4.5 if I could... it just seemed like it needed an extra touch. We have some key lime mustard that I would have tried with it if only I had remembered. Thinking about making a key lime sauce for next time (there will definitely be a next time!).

I left out the crackers because I realized too late that I didn't have any. Just coconut and cashews. Oh, and I used egg cause I was out of butter too!
Fiance said it was good. cooking time was RIGHT ON. would make this again.

I have used this recipe SEVERAL times and each time I get rave reviews!  I also marinate the chicken in coconut milk for a little extra coconut flavor, it also adds to the moistness.  AWESOME!!!

This is a dynamite recipe. I'm not a big coconut fan, and I still loved it. I also did chicken strips instead of whole breasts and I took the review advice of using sweetened coconut and salted cashews. Yum! Be prepared to eat this as soon as it comes out of the oven. If you let it sit, the coating will get soft and a bit soggy. I left them in the oven with the heat off until I was ready to serve up.

Great! I used sweetened coconut and honey-roasted cashews.  My husband loved it.  Very moist and delicious.

Relatively easy to make, although recipe will vary both in taste and nutritional value based on crackers used.  I prefer lower sodium, so I used low salt butter crackers, and the result was perfect for me.
