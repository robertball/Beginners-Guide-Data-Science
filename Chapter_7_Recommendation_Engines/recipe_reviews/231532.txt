I'm not much of a cook and this turned out great.  I used fresh peaches that were going bad, didn't peel them, uneven slices and chunks, old butter and terrible job cutting it into the flour mixture.  And it still turned out really tasty.

Wow...easily the best crisp I've ever tasted!  The recipe has the perfect ingredients for deliciousness; I will not look for another crisp recipe.  However, as someone mentioned before, there is enough topping to cover double the amount of fruit the recipe asks for!  What I did when I noticed there was going to be too much, was to go ahead and use 1/2 on my peaches; then I used the rest on some frozen cherries I had in the freezer to make a cherry crisp!  So, for me, it was a happy accident :)  The great thing is that, even if I hadn't had extra fruit on hand, I could have just stored the extra topping in a tupperware for future use in the fridge, since there was nothing in it that would go bad!  Thanks for the recipe, Stephanie!

I added pecans crushed to the top and cooked this in cupcake tins with silver liners. It took the same amount of time, just made small to prevent *accidently* overeating.

They freeze well.

I will definitely be making this again. I had peaches I worried would go bad before we ate them. I was trying to find a way to use them when I came across this recipe. I followed it as directed (except what others suggested adding a little bit of cinnamon and corn starch to the peaches; mine were very juicy) and it came out perfect. The best thing about it was I had everything in my pantry already. Some say there was too much topping but I guess I'm fat because I loved it. Next time I may just skip the fruit all together! :)

I have made this twice now and it is a good starting point. I have used both fresh and canned peaches, both work well in the recipe. For the peaches we preferred the crisp when I mixed in brown sugar (a couple tablespoons/enough to coat) and cinnamon ( a teaspoon or so) instead of plain peaches. As for the crisp topping it is good. I also baked at 400 for 30 minutes and the oatmeal topping came out perfect.

Great recipe. I put some nutmeg and cinnamon in the peaches for more flavor and some cornstarch to thicken my peaches as they were juicy but other then that it was great and the topping I'll use it on my apple crisp from now on. It stayed crisp even after a few day.

Great recipe. Two things I did different. I sprinkled peaches with 1/4 cup brown sugar 2 hours before starting and added a sprinkle of nutmeg in the mix. Baked extra 10 minutes for extra crunchiness..awesome and now a family favorite!

I gave it a five star for efficiency. I added to the crumble: 1/4 cup of oats, flax meal, and nuts. Of course I used  2 sticks of butter which was yummy. I substituted sugar for stevia and add 1/4 cp to peaches. It came out delicious and not much was left and by that I mean crumbs is what was left! I also used fresh peeled peaches! Thanks for sharing!

Would definitely make again! Someone has probably already suggested this... but here's my TIP: Wash your peaches, boil for 30 seconds, then dunk in ice water. Peel the peaches. The skins will fall right off. This is the method for prepping canned peaches.

I just made this recipe; well I did tweak it to my liking and it was very yummy. I just added a little vanilla and brown sugar to the peaches before following the rest of the recipe. Thank you for this recipe. I had peaches that I didn't know what else to do with and this was perfect. I can't wait to try this topping on apples, plums, berries, etc.

Delicious dessert and even better breakfast. I made this to take to a dinner party where "gluten free" was appreciated. So, I used oat flour instead of AP flour, and I'd do it the same way in the future. Since it was for a larger group I used 6 fresh peaches + 1 pint fresh blueberries, and increased the amount of oats to 1-1/2 cups. Used an ungreased 9x13 glass pan and baked it for a full hour.  I sprinkled vanilla sugar over the top before baking. Super easy to make and RAVE reviews.

The recipe was almost perfect but others suggested making more topping which I did   I also added 3/4 cup chopped pecans for cruncher.  Lastly, after it had baked I added lightly whipped heavy cream with a 1 Tbsp granulated sugar and 2 Tbsp Southern Comfort.    Mmmmmmmmmmmm

I used Kashi Go Lean Crisp! cereal in place of simple rolled oats. So tasty! I would recommend trying it. Also, next time I would likely add more peaches...at least 3. I like more fruit. But, overall, great recipe!

Served last night for a multi-family party.  It was very good, but would be improved by adding a bit of corn starch or flour (1 TBL?) to the peaches next time.  Flavors were good, but the juice was too runny.  Used wheat flour instead of white for the topping to up the nutritional value.

I used canned sliced peaches for this recipe.  Also. . . I melt the butter in the microwave first. . . mix all the flour, oats, etc. in a large bowl and then add the melted butter and combine everything.  Then. . . sprinkle the oat mixture on top of all the peaches with your hands.  This is much easier than cutting in cold butter and it makes the crunch more consistent in texture.  I lost my old recipe (and favorite) and this sounded very much like it.  It's in the oven. . . can't wait to see!  When using canned peaches. . . drain them but leave a little of the juice with them.

I like this recipe..I use it all of the time for peach crisp. I especially like that the sugar content is low...and with oatmeal it is yummy and crisp just as I like it.

This was the perfect recipe and absolutely delicious! I made a few minor changes. I doubled the amount of peaches to put in a 9 x 13 pan but left the topping ingredient amounts as written for the original recipe. There is plenty of topping to cover a 9 x 13 pan. I did sprinkle a little bit of brown sugar cornstarch a squeeze of lemon juice and cinnamon over the peaches before adding the topping. I added about 1/2 cup chopped pecans to the topping mixture and baked it as directed. I will be making this often.

Delicious and very easy to make. I used two reviewer's suggestions - adding brown sugar to the peaches ahead of time and adding nutmeg. Absolutely loved the result.

we made this and its delicious.  used fresh palisade peaches (we live in  sw colorado and i miss the georgia peaches from the south where grew up in the carolinas.)  made it same day as bought the peaches at a fruit stand and they were vv ripe.)  i never peel my peaches..healthier to keep skins on. i also used half the butter only 1/4 cup and still always cut back on the butter. as well as you can actually even use oil.  it still tasted delicious my husband absolutely loved it as well as i also cut out half the sugar and replace with stevia so i used 1/4 c sugar in the raw and 1/4 cup stevia powder.  it tasted fresh and wonderful.  the best peach crisp recipe i have found..(ps americans dont need half the sugar or fat/butter we use  and would  be much better off learning to cook more healthy and adapt our recipes) modern day recipes use way too much sugar and fat as well as the fruit already has sugar...never need to be so sickening sweet as you can always add some whipped cream and or ice cream)i also use nutmeg instead and only a little cinnamon..as tend to love nutmeg and not love cinnamon so much..

Fantastic recipe! I didn't make any changes, followed the recipe as is. Used fresh peaches from the Farmers Market. Served it hot topped with some whipped cream and it turned out phenomenal, got rave reviews. 
Thanks for posting your Mom's great recipe!

This was okay. I liked the topping so next time I may try plums. The peaches were not as juicy as I'd hoped so it was a bit dry.

I used fresh Colorado Palisade peaches and it's hard to not make something yummy with them!  I also added 1/2 cup of rolled oats and it was just like Mom's!  I've tried for years to duplicate her peach crisp and now I have it mastered!

I used 2 large cans of peach pie filling. I also added a pinch of cloves. I didn't have quite 1/2 cup of butter (& it was room temp not cold) so I subbed coconut oil to make up for the missing butter. The texture got sticky/gooey, which wasn't conducive to "sprinkling." I should have used "cold" butter as the recipe stated, but I was able to break the doughy mixture into small lumps and cover the peaches evenly. I had to bake it  10 minutes longer to get the rich golden color I like. I had no ice cream or whipped cream, nor any cream at all, so I poured a little condensed milk over each serving. The flavor was "to die for!" It's a wonderfully easy, very forgiving recipe that I can wholeheartedly recommend to one and all. Go for it and ENJOY!

I think you could use this recipe with almost any fruit. I used it with frozen cherries and it was a big hit with my family.

Didn't make any changes except to extend the topping ingredients a bit, since m husband loves topping with rolled oats, cinnamon, brown sugar and butter.  It's still early for Apple Crisp, so we enjoyed this tasty summer dessert.  I topped it with homemade whipped cream to which I added a few tablespoons of sour cream -- best whipped cream we've ever had!

Not enough crisp for the amount of peach and the peaches lost so much juice- More like peach soup with  granola sprinkles.
I would make it again but decrease it to 2.5 cups of peaches and add something to thicken it.

Made this today with peaches from local farm.  Only change was that I added some cinnamon sugar to the peaches before I put in the pan.  Other than that followed the recipe exactly and it was really good and easy.  Thanks for the recipe.

In her note she said her mom used canned peaches but in directions it says FRESH.  It was runny soggy not crisp... Don't use fresh peaches.  Canned has to be better!

This is an easy crisp recipe. I only had 3 peaches, so I opened a can of peach halves and sliced them, then went and picked two cups of blackberries. The pan was pretty full, so I only used 1/3 of a cup of brown sugar, flour, and butter. The crisp covered the top nicely. I used a convection oven that I'm learning to use. It looks good enough to take to a party (which I'm going to tomorrow.)

This was just what I was looking for.  I had two ripe peaches so I sliced them into individual 2 cup glass dishes.  I halved the topping and baked for about 10 minutes longer than the recommended time.  Once cool, I refrigerated and then served after dinner.  The peaches were cooked perfectly and the topping was crunchy and yummy.  Next time I will peel the peaches as those were kinda stringy in the crisp.  Anyway, this was very good.

It was funny to me that some reviewers thought there was too much topping, others thought there was too little, some people thought it needed additional sugar on the fruit, or nuts on top, or whatever. I actually thought it was just right! I don't like fruit desserts where the fruit is all syrupy and goopy with excess sugar. This recipe is definitely sweet, but you can still taste the flavor of the fruit, which I like. The topping was de-lish!

I followed the recipe as written. My husband and daughter also loved it! Bonus: it made the house smell amazing.

Was our first ever attempt at making peach crisp. Loved this recipe. Baked for a little longer than 30 minutes to get the topping crispy enough for our liking but did everything else as instructed. Will definitely save this recipe and make again.

Fantastic flavor. I found a trick for pealing fresh peaches which helped. Drop in boiling water for a few seconds until flesh cracks.

Our neighbor brought us a grocery bag FULL of fresh picked peaches and I knew there were so many things to make with them! Though I almost made a cobbler, I’m glad I made this instead. Admittedly, I eyeballed the peaches and added an eyeball amount of sugar and cinnamon to the top for an extra pop; but I did follow the rest of the recipe, and then a touch more of each ingredient. After a long day of yard work and peach prep, this was the perfect “come on in and relax” snack. With a scoop of vanilla icecream to top it off, makes me wish everyday was fresh peach crisp day!

We bought more peaches than we could eat and I needed to so something fast. Took the advice of others and sprinkled nutmeg on the peaches. I only had unsalted butter and it needed a smidgen mire. Great recipe! I only wish I had time to stop for whipped cream or ice cream for my work peeps. No leftovers and happy peeps!

Good with ice cream, not sweet enough for me without. My husband liked it more than I did. Next time, I think I'll add fewer oats and increase the cooking temperature, since the crisp wasn't all that crunchy.

But this is quick, which is nice.

A really easy and delicious recipe! 

I used 2 jars of peaches that we got from Costco and made sure to drain the juice first. Technically, this is a bit more peaches than the recipe calls for, but we like peaches a lot.

Once I spread the peaches in my glass baking pan, I added a tablespoon of corn starch and a couple tablespoons of the juice to the peaches and stirred them up until the corn starch was dissolved.

I added a teaspoon of nutmeg to the topping. I used cold butter and a pastry cutter, but next time I think I'll just melt the butter as that is much easier and works just as well.

I thought the amount of topping was just right. With a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream... yum!

This was amazing my and my brother devoured the entire thing in one sitting we didn’t make any changes but next time I would put little less crumble and less sugar and maybe cook it for longer since the peaches were still a bit crunchy

I chose this recipe because it had less butter and sugar than most of the others.  It was delicious.

This is an ok recipe. I enjoyed the simplicity of it. I used frozen peaches and the peaches stayed tangy instead of being too sweet. I will try this one again using some different spices.

Our family enjoys peaches and there is an abundance in the late August living near the Niagara escarpment in Ontario.  Fantastic recipe!  We will try it again soon with preserves.  Very tasty.

really tasty. Had vanilla in my hand, check the recipe...oh, no vanilla, ok, so I left it out. I added cinnamon and brown sugar to the peaches (about 5 peaches). Smelled great, served with vanilla ice cream, and .…..I used old fashioned oats b/c its what I had, turned out just fine.

The recipe is easy to make and cooks in the 30 minutes it reads. The favor was excellent and the peaches were done just right . The only issues I had was the crisp could have been a little crunchier.

I doubled the recipe and put it in a 13x9 and it was perfect.
Wanted to add blueberries so it ended up being 2 cups blueberries and 6 cups peaches. It was perfect. This is by far the best crisp/crumble recipe topping I’ve ever made.

Excellent and easy...great summer dessert for an outdoor party. I have served it several ways, but the favorite seems to be my homemade cinnamon-vanilla ice cream. I did add the cornstarch that a number of people mentioned and I double the fruit, put it in a 9 x 13 dish. It freezes exceptionally well. Love the idea that one person had to bake it in foil cupcake cups...portion control for those of us who endeavor to watch the waistline!

It was delicious, however one really does need to use a pastry cutter. I didn't have one and my creative efforts lead to having to chill the topping and try again.

As suggested by other reviewers, I put half of the toppings.  It would’ve been better with the full amount since it wasn’t too sweet.  Will be making it again!

I added some of the brown sugar and cinnamon to the peaches. The flavor was good, but I didn't care for the crumb texture. It was on the soggy side. I've had better.

Pretty good - I too mixed about 1/4 cup brown sugar , cinnamon, and nutmeg into the sliced peaches for over an hour before baking. In hindsight, that probably contributed to the juiciness, and ultimately the crisp was not crispy. Tasty while warm, served alongside vanilla bean ice cream.

Definitely makes a thick topping/crust, but my family really liked it. i added extra fall spices (nutmeg, cloves) to add a little extra flavor. Very good! a keeper for sure

Spot on, every time. Occasionally,  I mix in 1/3 cup blue berries and have found frozen fruit can work just as well after defrosted. We like a like extra brown sugar and top it with vanilla ice cream.

Awesome basic recipe! I tweaked to use things I had in the house. I used about a third cup if instant Irish oats, increased the flour by half and cut the butter in half! I also borrowed several suggestions to add brown sugar to the peaches, and used about a 1/4 cup and a tablespoon of flour and mixed all together with the peach mixture. I also greased the pie pan I used before baking to decrease sticking. You could play with this recipe a great deal and it would be great.

After reading the reviews I asked hubby what kind of fruit he wanted.  He said blueberries so I used about 3-1/2 cups of frozen berries mixed with some sugar, flour and cinnamon. Followed the rest of the recipe as written. I didn't pack the brown sugar and I'm wondering if I should have. I prefer a little sweeter topping but hubby said it's fine just the way it is so that's probably just me. I would definitely use the recipe again tho and tweak where necessary based on the fruit used.

I did not have any problems with this recipe! The kids loved it too. It was great to not have an excessive amount of sugar for me. I used the rest of some peaches we had and added a can in peach juice to have enough. Delicious!

I followed the directions, but pulsed the ingredients in my food processor to get the pebbly texture. However, next time I’ll add a little vanilla or almond extract to make the flavor really pop.

I used 2 -15 oz cans of peaches (drained) because that's all I had on hand, but will add another can next time. I used regular oats and they weren't as soft as I would have liked when it was done baking, so I'll try quick cook oats next time.

I made pretty much this as stated but with a quart of drained canned peaches. The crisp is flavorful and light. I did butter the baking dish with a good quality butter. I'll use this crisp again for other fruits.

Wasn't a big hit - the topping never really crisped and the flavor was a little bland (despite mixing brown sugar with the peaches). Could be because I chilled them overnight so I could pop it in the oven before taking it to a potluck the next day. Good, but not as good as I was hoping.

Will DEFINITELY make again. My boyfriend and I absolutely loved this. Put it on top of some vanilla bean ice cream while it's still hot, bam, amazing. I tossed the peaches in cinnamon before arranging on the baking pan, other than that I kept the the original recipe. I suggest you try it!

This was really good! I used a quart jar of home canned peaches and drained most of the juice off them. Added a bit of cinnamon and cornstarch (1 tsp) to the peaches. Made the full amount of topping. Finally I sprinkled some chopped pecans over it. Baked at 350 for about 40 minutes. Will make again for sure. Made 5 generous servings for us adults. Topped with whipped cream.

This was just what I was looking for. I didn't have fresh peaches so I used 2 large canned and drained all but 1/2 of a can. I also doubled the topping and baked in a 9x13 pan. Thanks for sharing!

As a VEGAN, I like to substitute dairy/eggs and this recipe was simple to do that with.  I just substituted the flour for whole wheat pastry flour, used only 3 TBSP vegan butter and 3 TBSP of coconut oil (all organic), added pecan pieces on top, and it was great!!  Oh, and I did add an extra two cups of peaches with 1 1/2 TBSP of lemon juice.

I used exactly 4 fresh unpeeled peaches. I also used a combo of butter and non-hydrogenated margarine (and slightly more than called for) and omitted cinnamon. I topped it with Organic Vanilla Sea Salt Caramel Ice Cream. It was amazing.

This was a wonderful recipe for a crisp that is so versatile and can be used on so many fruits.  So far, I've tried apples, peaches and pineapple.  I did bake it for a little longer as the crisp wasn't that crisp and tasted a bit mushy for my liking.  I got my first serving and threw the rest back in the oven (with the oven off) to dry up a bit as the oven cooled.

I've also used this recipe to top an "apple crisp" pie. bottom pie crust, apples tossed in lemon juice and cinnamon and then packed this on top.  It was fabulous!

I didn’t have any oats so I substituted Honey Bunches of Oats cereal. The flakes created the right amount of texture to balance the smoothness of the peaches.

The crunch topping is very good, and could be used on many other fruits, I think.  I followed a couple of reviewers' suggestion to add a little corn starch and nutmeg to the filling, that was a good idea, since the filling otherwise would be rather watery. It's an easy recipe that can be made on the fly, which I liked.

Used 3 cups of peaches screwed with sugar and half cup of fresh rhubarb chopped. Made everything else same except used honey and half amount of sugar in the study and topping. Out some topping on the bottom and sprinkled rest on the top. Came out really good. All were raving. Topped off with fresh made whipped cream.

I added 1/8 tsp of Nutmeg with the cinnamon and made it with Nectarines! I also sprinkled just a pinch of ground cloves on the top just before baking.

This was just what I was looking for!! A simple after dinner dessert with ingredients I had on hand. I used fresh peaches and made it exactly to the recipe. I will definitely keep this recipe and be making this again!

Quick, easy, and absolutely delicious.  Using fresh, sweet peaches is a must.  I followed the recipe exactly except I cut the butter back to 6 Tb.  It turned out perfect.

Less sugar wouldn't hurt this--especially if using particularly ripe/sweet fruit. I used fresh peaches and plums--skins on-- and it was very good. Next time I will use less sugar.

It was a hit! My husband loved it. I used fresh peaches. It turned out great. I added a little butter in my dish before I put my peaches in. But other than that I went by recipe.

It was easy and it was tasty. I had four huge, almost overripe, peaches that I needed to use.  Sadly they were so delicious that I ended up eating quite a bit of them, so I cut the recipe in half. I would make it again, and I would eat it again. My dog enjoyed it too.

Loved this recipe and will definitely make it again.  With fresh ripe local peaches, no need to add anything more for flavour.  Used whole wheat & flax seed flour. Used Becel instead of butter to make Vegan.  Added 1/2 cup chopped walnuts to the topping.  Super easy, multigenerational crowd pleaser.  Was a big hit!

I used fresh peaches and had no issues with it being runny.  I did not peel my peaches.  I wasn't sure if I should pack my brown sugar, but I did and I think it turned out great.

I used fresh peaches.  The crisp tasted great but was so very watery.  I added a cup of chopped pecans to the topping.  Next time I’ll toss the sliced peaches with some cornstarch.

Subbed out the flour with an extra 1/2C of oats, used raw turbinado sugar instead of brown sugar.  Used fresh peaches.  Absolutely delightful!

I used fresh blanched peaches instead of canned, and 1/2 the butter for the crumb topping.  Served over homemade frozen vanilla yogurt. Perfect combo!  Added to my permanent collection.

The only changes I made were that I added a bunch more cinnamon than was called for along with ground ginger and nutmeg. I eyeballed all of these, so all I can say is that there was enough of each for the topping to be about the same shade as milk chocolate. It did not taste like milk chocolate.

The only complaint I got for this was that there wasn't enough ginger, but we all love cinnamon to death and I've been told our tastes can be a little intense for some people, so if you're reading this, proceed with caution and good luck.

I will absolutely be making this again, though, because we loved it, we're up to our necks in fresh peaches, and we ate half the darn thing in one sitting so it's clearly not going to last!

LOVED this! My very first attempt in my life to make something from scratch and not a box. Super easy! I replaced cinnamon with nutmeg and added an entire small bag of halved pecans! I didn’t even have a pastry blender, so I used two knives in a crisscross scissor-like motion and my hands (ran under cold water first) to press the butter into the flour. My husband loved it! (And he’s very picky)

My family is crazy over this recipe! Infact I made double batches both times. I was out of both butter and brown sugar so I substituted: 
-instead of butter I used
cooking oil with just a little pinch of salt .
-instead of brown sugar I used the same amout of granulated (white) sugar and added enough molasses (about 3 tablespoons)to the sugar and mixed them by mashing together with a fork until all the molasses is well blended.
I also cut my peaches into bite size chunks. Which makes it easier to eat for some of the smaller and older family members.

I went overboard since Georgia Peaches arrive where I live once a year. I found this recipe. I've never had peach crisp or cobbler. This was fabulous!!! I had more peaches than the recipe called for so I doubled the recipe. The only thing I changed was I added about 1 1/2 teaspoons of vanilla extract to the topping. I will be making this again for sure! Maybe next time a little less rolled oats.

I loved this and so did my BF, and he doesn't even like peaches! My only add was finely chopped pecans in the topping, bc he does like those. Nice one!

THIS. WAS. SO. GOOD. 

A few changes: 

I have a rosemary bush in my backyard so I picked some, chopped it finely and added it to the oat mixture. It was amazing. 

I didn't have any brown sugar so I used 1/3 of a cut white. I don't like things super sweet. I definitely will make again.

Stephanie, thanks for the recipe! Oh, I can still "taste" my Grandma's home-canned peaches many years later. She'd put them up on the hottest day in summer, typically well over 100 degrees outside, but come winter, we were happy to have them.  Great recipe.

This was my 1st attempt at preparing any type of dessert and I am glad to say that my family and I enjoyed it! I'm definitely trying this recipe again.

Instead of using rolled oats, I substituted it with oats n honey granola. I had to crush the granola a bit but it turned out great!

Quick and easy. Also, great with homemade whipped cream.  Prepared this ahead of time with some frozen peach slices.  Popped it in the oven when company came over and had a homemade warm dessert when dinner was over.

I halved the recipe and used granola instead of the oats.   I used plain granola, but am pretty sure most flavors would work well.  Since the granola is already sweetened, i cut back a bit on the brown sugar.  I also used Red Mill stone ground flour, and baked it in two individual size serving casserole dishes.   Keeping this recipe and will be making it often.

Ran out of peaches, so I supplemented with pears. Awesome combo. Great recipe. Allergic to butter, so used shortening instead. Works as well. Thanks!

Won't  make this again. I followed recipe and added cornstarch as others suggested. It was still runny. Also, the topping tasted great but had all the wrong consistency for a crispy top. Other crisps I've made in the past had a crunchy  crumbly type crust. This crust just disentegrated. It was still a powdery consistency after being baked. We got bites of crumbly oatmeal. The crust never melded together.

My husband and my son really liked this! They said the flavour was really good! The only change I made was to substitute dairy free margarine for the butter because my son can't have dairy. I didn't eat it because I can't have gluten. It was so easy to make, I'm sure we will be having this often!

I am a very seasoned cook- but I followed a couple of reviews and just added a little brown sugar, nutmeg, and cinnamon  to the peaches.  Rave reviews from my guests.  Will make again and again. Thanks for this simple recipe.

My new favorite - I made the recipe according to directions.  The topping was nice and crisp when baked.  This recipe makes more topping than you need so I used half the topping and kept the remaining for a second batch of  crisp.  This is definitely the best peach crisp recipe I've enjoyed, and I've tried my fair share.

This was good, somewhere between 3.5 and 4 stars for me. Next time I make it I will toss the peaches with some sugar and cornstarch. The fresh peaches I used were sweet and juicy, but I think a little more sweetness and the cornstarch to thicken the juice would have been better. I'd also add a bit more to the crumb topping, a dash of nutmeg perhaps and maybe some finely chopped pecans for a little more crunch. This recipe is a good base but I agree with many of the other posters who would make some additions for it to be really fabulous.

Simple to make. Absolutely delicious! Can probably substitute apples instead of peaches. I highly recommend serving this with a scoop of vanille ice cream.

We've made this twice in the last two days.  I think it's a great recipe exactly as is.  Our peaches were a little tart, so that balanced nicely with the topping.  The first time I made it I peeled the peaches, the second time I left them unpeeled.  I prefer without peels for texture, but it was so much faster and easier to leave them unpeeled!  The unpeeled peaches also kept their firmness a little better, which my husband and I like.

Easy and tasty. I would use unsalted butter or leave out the salt as the topping was a little too salty. I added some nutmeg and cinnamon to the peaches as well as a little brown sugar and corn starch.

Great topping.  My peaches were really juicy and tart.  I would add a little sugar and maybe some cornstarch to them next time.  Fall is almost here and I plan to try this with apples.

This is a great recipe!  Everyone loved it!  The peaches were very juicy, so there was water in the bottom of the dish, so maybe I'll try tossing the slices in flour or cornstarch next time. I love the topping and the peaches are sweet enough without added sugar. Thanks for sharing!

I love how straightforward and easy this recipe is! Only 1/2 cup sugar is great. I added some chopped walnuts and almonds to give it more crisp on top. It was a big success at a big family dinner!

Wish I had added a bit of flavoring to the peaches before putting in the pan.  Almond flavoring?  Cinnamon?  Sugar? 
Looks very nice though.  Have not cut into it, yet.

FRESH PEACHES ARE TOO HIGH IN PRICE AND THE WEATHER IS TOO HOT TO MAKE THIS AGAIN UNTIL OUR SUMMER IS OVER.

Made it with no changes. Thought it was a little too sweet.
I let it bake a little longer until the edges were real golden and crispy.

This is a classic.   Made it exactly as written with fresh peaches and served with a scoop of homemade vanilla ice-cream.

Very similar to a crisp I've made for years. This is a very easy recipe and comes together quickly. Made as is except that I added some chopped almonds. Husband only brought me 3 peaches so I put them in 4" ceramic pie pans and used half topping to make 3 crisps. Split them and added ice cream - dessert for two nights. Easy, inexpensive and delicious. Doesn't get much better than that in the summer.

Great crisp recipe!  Loved the topping and as others have suggested, I will probably use it with other fruits.  Nice to have a dessert recipe that goes together quickly and bakes while you have dinner.  Thank you for sharing!

Absolutely Delicious!
  Using fresh peaches,
I added a drop of almond flavoring to the peaches,as we love the extra boost in flavour,otherwise followed the recipe.  
Have made it twice this week and has become a favorite! Will definitely be making again,!
Thank you for sharing this yummy recipe!

Very simple and very tasty.   I used granola instead of rolled oats, but oats would have been just as good.   I will make again.

This recipe is a classic. That being said I don't care for "oats" in these recipes. Almost all "crisps" add oatmeal to the topping. Does anyone know if the oats can be omitted successfully and still work well ? Request comments please. And if you have a different recipe without oats added I'd appreciate a link or posting. Thanks.

Next time I'll cut the butter to 1/4 cup; don't think there's a need for the extra fat and it detracts from the crispness of the topping.  I added cornstarch to the peaches but it was still runny.

This recipe was so quick and easy to make, and my family loved it. I substituted a scant half cup of cane sugar for brown sugar and coconut oil for butter. I also shook cinnamon onto the peaches. It was so crispy and delicious. I did find the topping to be a bit too sweet and the peaches a bit tart for my liking. A good idea might be to share some of the sugar with the peaches. This recipe is a keeper.

Haven't made this one, but my Mother used a recipe when I was a child 60 years ago that was very similar.  Hers was 1/2 cup of butter, sugar, flour and rolled oats, but we usually added a little more flour and oats.  I'm going to try the 1 cup oats and see what it does.  I had to chuckle because I now know old favorites never die.

This turned out amazing!!! I used fresh peaches and added a dash of pumpkin pie spice and it turned out wonderfully. The crumble is rich and buttery and so addictive. I'm going to be making this one a lot.

We planted a peach tree in the backyard, and it's going crazy this year! I tried peeling the peaches by putting them in boiling water for 30 seconds, then putting them in cold water. The skins zip right off. Yummy recipe!

I loved that this recipe had less sugar then many others that add sugar to the fruit as well.  My peaches were fresh picked off the tree and juicy so had plenty of sweetness already.  I did only add just a pinch of salt since I used salted butter and  it may have also benefited from a little cornstarch to the peaches since they were so juicy.  Other than that, this was delicious!

Used fresh peaches. Followed recipe exactly. Very good. Will make again. May toss the peaches with some additional brown sugar next time. Baked for 35 minutes to get a crisper top.

Easy to make.  Most tedious part is paring the peaches. Smooth sailing after that.  Wonderful to serve while still warm with good vanilla ice cream on top.

Super easy! I've used canned peaches, drained, a mix of fresh fruit, and even frozen fruit, thawed. It always turns out and I always hear about how great it is. I make a bit extra of the crumble (use 3/4 cup butter, etc etc) as my family loves that part.

I made this as a request to take to work.  I was such a big hit, I didn't have any left over to bring home. 
My personal thought is the next time, I'm going to increase the cinnamon a bit.

Good all-purpose dessert for when prep time is scarce. I've made it twice in a week with two different fruits.

Quick and easy!  Really delicious.  I used canned peach pie filling to save time and it worked just fine.

I made this as written except for a substitution of about one cup of peeled plums because I didn't have enough peaches. It was a disaster. It was dry and the fruit tasted sour and bitter. The sugar in the topping did not sweeten the fruit and no syrup was produced while baking.  I wish I had read some of the reviews suggesting the addition of sugar to the fruit.

Very good and very easy recipe. My peaches were perfectly ripe so there was a little juice on the bottom of the pan, but I kind of liked it that way. I did add a touch of vanilla extract to the peaches before I put them in the pan.  Mine baked for about 40 minutes. Will definitely make this with other fruit. Thanks for the great (and easy!) recipe.

I had four extra large Jersey Peaches that were perfect. After removing the skin and slicing, I added some vanilla and fresh nutmeg to the Peaches. I also added freshly grated nutmeg to the toppings. Served with vanilla ice cream the flavors merged exactly the way I imagined they would. I didn't use a full cup of oats to the toppings and put it all on the Peaches, because in my opinion, you never have enough. This was perfect. A great way to use a beautiful find of farmstead fresh Jersey Peaches. Very juicy and delicious. My preference, and the only time I make anything like this is to use fresh, seasonal fruit.

Used all oat flour, not wheat and used Brown Rice sugar instead of Brown sugar.  Lower in carbs and on the Glycemic Index for sugar.  Healthier and delish.

I made this but did make a few changes. I added 1tsp almond extract to the peaches, cut the topping in half and added two handfuls of sliced almonds to the topping which added a nice crunch but didn't alter the taste. With my changes the family loved it.

About to make this for the fifth time this summer.  I will be so sad to see peach season go!  This is the tastiest, quickest recipe for peaches I've found anywhere and it is DELICIOUS!  I have made it with quick oats and regular rolled oats and both were great, though regular oats might have been a bit crisper.

Made exactly as the recipe said and it turned out perfect! Well, I did leave it in for an extra mins to make it crispier, but other than that I didn't change a thing.  Very simple and quick. The only thing that may make the difference is in the ripeness of the peaches. Mine were very ripe so maybe that's why I found it perfectly sweet.

Love the recipe, first time added raspberries and peaches and everyone raved about the flavor. Making it a second time today with just peaches, I am sure it will be just as good. I followed the advice of another and gassed the peaches in some brown sugar and cinnamon to enhance the cinnamon flavor, just because I love cinnamon. Thank you for a great recipe.

This is a great, easy crisp. For gluten free I used almond flour and it worked well. Next time, to make it dairy free also I'm going to try substituting coconut oil for the butter. Nice to have an easy crisp recipe in glorious peach season!

My peaches were ripe and left way too much liquid at the bottom of the dish.  Next time I will increase the amount of topping and maybe add a little sugar over the peaches.

Followed the recipe but made two small additions. I followed fellow reviewers suggestions and added 1T brown sugar and 1tsp vanilla to peaches and let them sit for a couple hours before combining ingredients and baking. Very easy and tasty even when using canned peaches!  Thank you for the recipe!

Followed recipe exactly. After 20 minutes of cooking my peaches were drying out.  I added 1/2 cup of half and half with a little sugar. The crisp was not crisp. Everyone loved it though. Next time I will cut my peaches the night before and toss with a little sugar to release the juices and double the crisp topping.

I substituted the Brown sugar for Splenda  Brown sugar blend.  It was delicious.  the recipe says serves 4 but I found that that was too large a portion.  I drizzled a tiny bit of caramel topping on the crisp before I served it topped with vanilla ice cream and another tine drizzle of the caramel topping.

Followed the recipe as written, I think it is always important to follow the recipe to give a fair review.  Second time making the recipe I know how I want to change it or to make it again as written.  This is very good as written, only change would be to add chopped pecans and add a touch more cinnamon mixed in with the peaches.

I only used half the amount of crisp from the original recipe (as recommended by other reviewers), but I think next time I'll use the whole amount of crisp. I made this with nectarines, since I didn't have peaches on hand, but I think next time I'll sugar the nectarines first.

Only okay because the topping  didn't crisp and carmelize. I will try a different recipe next time.

Tasted great, but next time I will definately toss the peaches with some flour or cornstarch first and use quick cooking oats instead of the old fashioned.

Delicious!  The only change I made was to put this in a 9x13 pan.  I considered mixing some cornstarch or flour with my peaches but it worked fine without doing that.

I've been watching what I've been eating lately; so, this was a great treat! My boys loved it! We were able to swing by a local farm a pick fresh peaches; some of our picks were used for this dessert. Followed the recipe, only change was using Apple Pie Spice instead of cinnamon. Hard to stop at one serving.

Crumble
I used 2 -3 TBS less butter and added 1/4 each ground flax, sliced almonds, and 1/3 cup extra flour ( made it with GF) blend.  Very rich anyway. 
Fruit
Added cinnamon, nutmeg, 1/3 cup brown sugar 2 TBS cornstarch2 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp almond extract  and 2 cups frozen cherries to fresh sliced peaches. 

I needed to double that cornstarch as I had a lot of liquid- albeit yummy.  

Very tasty , not for company where the presentation matters. Great with vanilla ice cream.

My neighbor works at a farm and brought us some peaches that were bruised and needed to be used quick.  I cut out the bruises which left me with slices and chunks of all sizes and shapes.  I followed the recipe exactly with the only change being doubling it.  IT WAS FABULOUS!

PS:  I made a 2nd batch and substituted apples & pears that I had on hand.  This batch turned out GREAT as well!

I made it and rated it with no changes to the recipe.  I thought  there was too much of an uncooked oatmeal taste.  The peaches were good and agree that it wasn't an overly sweet dessert, which I did like.

This recipe was outstanding.  Only change I made was that I melted the butter before reading the recipe.  Turns out that was a plus and kept the topping from melting into the peaches, which I like.  I used 4 fresh peaches peeled & sliced.  Everything was spot on!  Thanks for the recipe!

Used gluten free flour and it worked great. Of course, it may be the fresh Georgia peaches, which makes it fabulous.

Not a huge fan of the texture of this crust, but I was pleased with the taste overall.. I doubled most of the crust ingredients except the butter, because I wanted more crust. I also added nutmeg and ground flax seed to the crust.  I used can peaches and added a tiny bit of nutmeg to them.

The I thought it was ok. I made it with peaches from the Georgia Peach Truck.  They were very juicy and I made it just as the recipe is stated. Was not impressed with the recipe or the peaches.

We followed the recipe and made no changes. My peaches were little juicy so the cobbler was a little runny. We will make it again because it was very good.

I goofed up. My butter was all blocky and would break down enough to make a a crumble so I put in the microwave  for 10 seconds and the recipe just went to mush :( Next time I will try cubing it small before. Even with my goof up, the topping I found very bland.

Awesome recipe! Instead of all purpose flour, I used self rising, just a half cup of butter, and left it in for about 40 minutes instead of 30 but it still came out wonderful! My husband doesn't even like sweets and even he was asking me how I made it!

I thought it had a great flavor, but with some adjustments.  From another review, I added corn starch because the peaches had to much natural juice.  I added sugar to the peaches & ~2 Tbs. of corn starch, which wasn't enough corn starch.  I also made 1 1/2 of the topping

I would make this over and over and over again! The only change I made was to add a little vanilla extract and brown sugar the peaches before I put the flour/ oat mixture over the peaches.... yummy!

Quick, tasty, and perfect with a scoop of ice cream.
I added a pinch of nutmeg and allspice.
Perfect for those very ripe peaches!

My daughter and I had a great time making this dish! We had a bunch a fresh peaches to use up so we doubled the batch and used 1/2 butter and 1/2 coconut oil. It turned out perfect! Super easy and quick. Will be using this a lot this fall!

Made this as a quick dessert and stuck it in the oven while we ate dinner.  It smelled fantastic cooking and was perfectly golden when we pulled it out of the oven.  Served warm with a scoop of French vanilla, it was a perfect crowd pleaser!

We loved this, but I used fresh peaches and they tasted like canned when I cooked them.  Next time I'll just use canned and save myself all that effort.

Great recipe.  But, like others I tweaked it a bit. I will try adding a bit of brown sugar and cinnamon to the peaches before baking.  I also thought there was too much crust, but will bake in 9 x 9 next time and add 3-4 more peaches.  I will also try reducing the brown sugar by 1/3 to see if that is acceptable.  Otherwise, loved it and will make again with apples in the fall.

I have made this twice with fresh peaches - it is the best!!!! Everyone LOVED it!! I cut down the butter and the sugar some. Tonight I used a gluten free flour mix for the flour and it was still great - my son was really grateful for it. Thank you Stephanie! So easy and soooo good!

First time in almost 10 years we've had home grown peaches to cook with so I made my favorite fresh fruit dessert.  Followed another reviewer's advice and added corn starch (1 1/2 tablespoons) and extra cinnamon to peaches, also 1/2 tsp almond extract=love that with peaches.  Topping is so crisp and delish!!  Hubby was in heaven on a gloomy, rainy day!

This was good. I used thawed frozen sliced peaches and I added cinnamon and cornstarch to the peaches as suggested by reviewers. I only used about 1/3 c brown sugar and it was still very sweet. Next time try 1/4 c brown sugar.

Yum! I had four big peaches that were not that great for eating but they worked great in this. Did not measure them. Did not peel them either.  Was sooo good.

I used nectarines and also cherries (separate dishes) and they were great. I found the topping to be more than enough to cover the fruit.

Made it with white and yellow peaches. My boyfriend loved it. Going to make it again soon. But take the skins off and maybe add other fruits with it.
