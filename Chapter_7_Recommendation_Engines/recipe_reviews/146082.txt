Very easy to make, used a dairy free butter substitute and it worked just fine.   Made just a small amount to test the recipe..   This will be perfect on French toast for a special brunch I'm planning.  I did add a touch of vanilla before baking.

Excellent flavor, although quite sweet (but that will work for the french toast)

This turned out SO great! I didn't use a whole stick of butter like others suggested and no brandy, but everyone kept asking if I had put some kind of liqueur because of the way the bananas carmelized. My husband doesn't even like banana desserts and said I would have to make this again!

I would give this a 3 but my hubby would give a 5 so compromised with 4. If you are looking for something that is appealing to look at and to eat I wouldn't recommend this. When serving this I recommend serving immediatly. The longer it sits the more unappealing it looks! As far as taste it was a little too sweet for my tastes, but as I said my husband couldn't get enough! (Had 3 servings!) I only had it over icecream and it was still really sweet, couldn't imagine eating it alone.

Oh, I wish I had some 'nilla ice cream when I made this! It's super easy and super good and if you don't make it and put it over vanilla ice cream, you're missing out on a big treat and I don't care for bananas!

I brought this to a Cuban dinner my friends were having.  My Cuban friend was unfamiliar with this desert, but everyone enjoyed it when served with vanilla ice cream

I didn't slice my bananas lengthwise.  Maybe that is where I went wrong.  I could not get any of my family to even try it.  Of course I tried it.  I thought the flavor was ok but too mushy.

I didn’t have brandy on on hand and I added 1 cup of previously frozen blueberries around the edges before baking. And, it turned out fantastic! It was a little runny at first but gelled up a tad while it rested through our picadillo dinner. I will definitely make this again.

4.15.18  We had a total Cuban meal today, and these bananas served over a scoop of vanilla ice cream were a stellar finish!  I really didn’t measure anything, just sort of eyeballed it, used Truvia® Brown Sugar Blend and I Can’t Believe It’s Not Butter® Organic Spread in place of butter to lighten it, and baked for 30 minutes. Also, I drizzled the rum over the bananas before they went into the oven, giving the alcohol a chance to cook off and just leave you with that rich rum flavor.  Thanks for sharing your nice recipe, we all enjoyed it.

Yes, SERVE WARM, over vanilla ice cream, as another viewer suggested.  It does turn brown and ugly the longer it sets.  This dish got complements from guests on our Cuban food night, and I would be happy to make it again.  Its very easy to do and I put in the oven as we sat down to dinner so it would be warm at dessert time.  Changes I made:   I used Cuban rum (didn't have any brandy) and plumped the raisins as suggested by another site, in 2 T melted butter and the rum prior to putting together. I sprayed the pan with butter flavor spray, used splenda blend brown sugar, and reduced butter by 2 T.  It made a single layer in a  9x13 baking dish, and only needed about 20+ min baking. I may possibly increase the pecans and reduce the raisins slightly next time if I remember.  This is a great recipe for an easy dessert that everybody liked.

It was delicious. The only change I made was that I used cooking bananas( which I got at Publix). The recipe is very easy and quick and tastes delicious

Nothing Cuban about this dish! This is not a Cuban recipe; not traditional or inspired. No respectable Cuban would eat this mess.

My grocer had no ripe bananas, so I risked it and tried it with slightly green bananas. Not a good idea. Will try this again after bananas have set a few days.
