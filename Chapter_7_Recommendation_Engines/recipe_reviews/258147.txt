Simple , straight forward, and full of flavor. The one recommendation I have is to chop up the herbs up so that distribute more evenly.  I chopped some up and left others whole but next time I will chop them all. Great recipe and perfect for summer grilling!

Used fresh herbs from the garden.  Got quite a few compliments as a side dish.  Second time I was a bit rushed and melted the butter.  Tasted fine, but I find it easier to coat the corn with coating that is less liquid.

I cut the ingreds. in half.  Just my husband and I.  The most tender, tasty corn on the cob I have had.  I am just learning the joy of grilling and I did a steak with this.  Wonderful and my husband keeps praising it and wants more.

This was delicious and my husband also loved it.  I had all these wonderful herbs in my courtyard garden (only place with enough sun) and what a great way to use them.  Perfect as advertised.  Thank you!   I will try to remember a photo for next time.

Used all herbs from the garden I think that makes all the difference in the world so heavenly. Cooking time was perfect at high altitude.

Made as instructed. Had to increase time for grilling. Takes great.
