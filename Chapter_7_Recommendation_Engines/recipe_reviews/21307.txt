This is a great fondue with 1/3 freshly brewed coffee or cappuchino instead of the instant powder and water. A tip for the leftovers (because everyone else was right, this does make a lot!)... This recipie is essentialy a truffle recipie.  Let the leftovers cool and then refrigerate.  Round out small balls and roll in cocoa powder, powdered sugar or toadsted coconut. All of a sudden you have a new, gormet desert you can serve all over again and impress the crowds! Truffles also make great gifts when wrapped nicely!

I am 12 and I made this fondue by myself. Oranges, strawberries, pound cake, pineapple, apple, bananas, and marshmallows work best for dipping.

The need to entertain spur-of-the moment guests led me to this wonderful dessert recipe. Soooo simple and quick. I don't own a fondue pot, so I made it in a double boiler (without the water) and transferred it to a pretty chafing dish. This was so delicious, Sara. My company thoroughly enjoyed it with a variety of fresh fruit and pound cake. Try the Apricot Brandy Pound Cake (quick version made with Yellow cake mix) from this site. It freezes well and can be cut into cubes easily. I also had some chocolate pound cake from this site in the freezer. I had some 5 inch bamboo skewers left from another recipe that I gave each guest. They were happily threading the skewers with a variety of items, and wondering when I had had the time to prepare such a luscious dessert. They said the fondue was as good if not better than that at a local fondue restaurant. I will use this again and again.

We LOVE this recipe!  I used 2 packages of milk chocolate chips on one bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips.  I also followed the suggestions of ommitting the water.  The results were OUTSTANDING!  I had enough left over from a playdate to take to a bbq the same evening.  I rewarmed the chocolate and added a little more milk to even it out.  EVEN BETTER!  Thank you so much for this recipe!

Great fondue recipe!  Try skewering a combo of raspberries and sponge cake together before dipping.  Bananas, marshmallows, or strawberries were great too.  But, even after a party, I had at least 1 1/2 cups of chocolate left over.  So, here's my idea for WHAT TO DO WITH THE LEFTOVER CHOCOLATE:  reheat in the microwave, until melted; stir in walnuts.  I used about 1 cup, but you can adjust it to your preference.  Spray a rectangular glass pan (mine is a 6x9") with Pam, or line with wax paper, then pour the mix in.  Layer tiny marshmallows, cut-up leftover marshmallows, or mashmallow fluff over the top.  Cool, then refridgerate until relatively solid (overnight).  Cut into squares, wrap individually with clear plastic wrap and VOILA!  Homemade Rocky Road Fudge.  It will be soft at room temp, so you might want to keep the fudge in the fridge or freezer.   Makes a nice treat.

This was great.  I also used the best chocolate that I could find (Ghiradelli) and reduced the coffee a bit...didn't want it to be too strong because the main eaters would be kids.  It was great....Will make this many more times.  Thanks.

Easy and very delicious.  Used milk chocolate chips intead of grating the chocolate.  I made this for a potluck at work and everyone loved it.  (I didn't put the coffee in either) I warmed it up in the microwave and it stayed warm and perfect for an hour and a half!

This was amazing!  It did make a ton and we have lots left over.  We dipped some pound cake and strawberries and also apples and marshmellows.  The marshmellows went really fast and everyone was surprised that they liked that one so much!  I used really good chocolate too so I think that helped.  I used Ghiradelli's milk chocolate and a package of the double chocolate too.  Amazing!!

Fantastic recipe!  Instead of using the coffee, I used a shot of Bailey's.  It was excellent!  I also added crushed Oreo cookies to the chocolate mixture (about 4 cookies crushed).  We dipped pineapple, banana, apple, Oreos and large marshmallows covered in Oreo crumbs.

A great recipe!  We made it for a kid's Valentine's Day party.  It was a big hit with the kids AND adults. Then we watched Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory (the DVD edition is GREAT- lots of extras). One tip- be sure to dissolve the instant coffee in the 1/3 cup of water.  Also, I prepared the mixture in the microwave instead of on the stove.  The consistency was perfect.  The chocolate I used 3 bags (11.5 ounce size) of Hershey's choc. chips- 2 milk & 1 semi-sweet.  For dipping we used: Nilla vanilla wafers, mini pretzels, crispy wafer strips (vanilla, chocolate & strawberry), pound cake cubes, marshmallows (great with just chocolate or dip then roll in a dish of crushed graham crackers to make s'mores- VERY YUMMY!- these were a BIG hit), and finally some frozen banana slices.  We saved leftover fondue (lots leftover) to use as hot fudge sauce or as a base for hot chocolate (about 1 Tablespoon / mug of hot milk).

This was such an easy recipe...I had a lot leftover since we only had a small group. 
The leftovers freeze very well & it's easy to thaw (double boiler). It makes a nice fudge/truffle like consistency...So, I made a basic no-bake cheesecake recipe & rolled the cheesecake into little balls. Then I took the cold chocolate and rolled it over the cheesecake. Truffles with a cheesecake filling! Yummy! :)

So easy but it makes a lot of fondue.  I made homemade candy bars out of our leftovers.  In a greased baking pan I  layered chocolate, rice crispies cereal, melted caramels and more chocolate.  I put this in the refrigerator and served it the next day.

EXCELLENT!!  The thickness is just right!
I used half dark chocolate and half milk chocolate, used kalua liquor instead of coffee, and omitted the sugar.  I don't like it too sweet, and it was perfect!

Great!  I would make sure to dissolve the coffee granules in the hot water first.  That wasn't clear in the recipe.  Coffee added a nice flavor.

I thought this was a good fondu, everyone else at the party absolutely RAVED about it!
As suggested, I omitted the water and used 2 bags milk chocolate chips with one bag semi-sweet chocolate chips. 
You can't taste the coffee (even though I put it in) but when comparing side-by-side to one without coffee, the one without is lacking a certain depth of richness!

YUMMM! You should expect to get a mocha flavor with this recipe. I downscaled the servings to 12, and it served 2 for desert with half leftover. I used a 7 oz. Symphony candy bar and 1/4 c. cream. A perfect end to a nice romantic evening of fondue at home. I didn't have luck with warming it up the next day; at the least, I wouldn't try it in the microwave again. But for flavor, this competes with my favorite at a local, wonderful, fondue restaurant!!!

One suggestion to reduce the lumpiness, heat the cream before adding the chocolate!  I also added more cream and a little less chocolate.  No coffee, no water.  And we mixed milk with semi-sweet.  It was awesome but made a ton!  Could have reduced it to half even for 4 people who are big eaters!

great taste, but there is no need to add the hot water. it is already very creamy, adding water will spoil the taste. Tip: cook on low heat, place the cram in before the chocolate, and keep on stirring to keep the chocolate from burning

Delicious and easy to make.  Was worried about not using a double boiler but as long as you use medium heat and keep and eye on it, a saucepan works fine.  Substituted 1 TBL Kahula for instant coffee powder and used 2 (11.5 oz each) bags of milk chocolate chips and 1 bag (11.5 oz) semi-sweet chocolate chips. Served with apple slices, bananas, strawberries, kiwi and marshmallow.  Friends want to have a 'fondue party' now!  Will make again.

Excellent - I used semi-sweet chocolate chips.  It was an absolute hit at my house warming party.  I served with fresh pineapple, strawberries and bananas.  I even had some pretzels out that some enjoyed dipping.

The best, easiest chocolate fondue!  I have been making fondue for years, using expensive chocolate and spending a lot of time "stirring constantly"!  This is SO much easier.  Instead of grating the chocolate, I used half milk chocolate and half semi-sweet chocolate chips.  Instead of the coffee, I used a few splashes of Kahlua (would've used Bailey's but we were out).  That's it!  Made it in a non-stick fondue pot right on the stove top and then put over the flame on low.  Served with nice cold strawberries and graham crackers.  Also great leftover!

Took this to Super Bowl party yesterday...what a hit! Very popular especially with the young crowd! Used bamboo skewers to dip angel food cake and large marshmallows to roll in crushed graham crackers.  Also served pretzel rods along side to use as dippers.  I used 2-12 oz. bags of milk chocolate chips and about 3/4 bag of semi-sweet chips, along with 1/3 c hot brewed coffee (that I dissolved the sugar in first). Came out smooth and delicious! For all of you concerned about the coffee flavor, it is not predominate and adds a deep richness. It does make a lot, as I had leftovers even after a large party with teenage boys! Will definately make this again. Thanks Sara!

This recipe is definately worth a 5 star.  not only was it easy to mix, ingredients were easy to come by.  I never liked the fondues with wine so this recipe especially suited my taste.  definately worth making and will definately make again.  one advice is just to be patient when melting the chocolate and use low heat as specified.

I didn't add the coffee because I didn't want it affect the flavor.  I also used high end chocolate chips but next time I will use chocolate bars because it tasted a little like melted chocolate chips (not as good).  This is a great basic recipe that even first time fonduers like me can make.

This was Excellent.  Where I work, instead of bringing in treats for your own birthday, we make them for eachother.  The Birthday girl loves chocolate so I made this and kept it warm in a small crockpot.  I used Ghiradelli Chocolate and omitted the coffee.  I brought in Stawberries, Pineapple, Apples, Angel Food & Pound Cake and Shortbread cookies for dippers.  It was a HUGE hit.  Even me, who is not a big chocolate fan, loved it.  This will be a staple for the holidays!

So good and so easy!  I did substitute Kahlua for the coffee and water.  I served it with fresh strawberries, cubed pound cake, cut up slices of frozen cheese cake, and some leftover Christmas sugar cookies that I found in my freezer!  OUr favorites were the strawberries and pound cake.  
For my husband and I for Valentine's day I used only 1/4 of the recipe.  We still had enough leftovers to have dessert again a few nights later.  I just popped it in the microwave for 30 sec.  I have also taken the left over refrigerated fondue and rolled it into little balls and rolled into coconut. They made very good truffles!  I will definitely make again, maybe for my next dinner party!

Excellent! Adjusted the recipe to fit my 16 oz mini crockpot little dipper. Melted the ingredients in a sauce pan first then tranfered >>> 2 cups (11.5 oz) ghirardelli milk chocolate chips, 1/2 cup heavy cream, 1 tablespoon water (optional), no instant coffee (due to having kids around). Since the party ended up being an all day thing, I had to plug and unplug the crockpot a couple of times just enough for the chocolate to be warm and not too hot to burn the kiddies. If a cord is not available, just use a bowl and just reheat in microwave. I had used pretzels, strawberries, cubed rice krispies. We also had a little bit left for the next day use; slighty reheat and drizzle over sliced bananas (all we had) for breakfast. It's also great drizzled over vanilla ice cream.

This is awesome!  I have made it for years and Feel guilty for not rating sooner.  It makes tons of chocolate so it's great for a large party, otherwise I would 1/2 the recipe.  I dip pretzels, cake, fruits, marshmellows (then roll in crushed grahm crackers) and pretty much anything else.  People love when I bring this to their house.  I usually bring it in a glass bowl and microwave it on 50% for 2 minutes then 30 second increments and stir between until smooth.  It stays melted for quite some time without being heated in a fondue pot.

We made this last night and everyone LOVED it! There were a few in our group who don't like coffee, so I substituted 3 Tbsp. Kahlua Mudslide for the instant coffee. It actually sat on the stove for an hour before I transfered it to the fondue pot, and it stayed very smooth, not grainy at all! Needless to say, we were all sick when we were done! Sick, but happy!

Tasted SCRUMPTIOUS! However, not having heavy cream on hand I substituted 1/4 milk and 1 tspn coffeemate for the heavy cream of same quantity (I downscaled the recipe to serve for 20). I'm a big fan of dark chocolate and this tasted similarly despite the fact that we used milk chocolate chips. I agree that it was thin, so just add water lasted to desired consistency.

Excellent! And note, this recipe makes 48 servings! Which came out to just under 2 litres. And you don't really need the sugar if you use semi-sweet or sweet chocolate.

Was a huge hit at my New Year's Eve Party!  Both adults & kids enjoyed it.  I used President's Choice chocolate chips (1 bag semi-sweet & 2 bags milk chocolate) & it turned out great.  Super easy recipe.  Served with strawberries, banana slices, apple chunks, orange pieces, mini pretzels, and cream puffs.  Can't wait to make this one again!  Had lots left over so may 1/2 recipe next time.

Wow!  What an easy and delicious fondue!  I took the advice of other reviewers and eliminated the water.  It was the perfect consistency for dipping marshmallows, graham crackers and pretzels.  I also used two shots of Bailey's Irish Cream in lieu of the coffee and it was fabulous.  I am sure you could add any favorite liquer (Bailey's, Grand Marnier, etc) and customize the flavor.

I did this in a small crock pot which elimimated the need to grate the chocolate - a real time saver.  Turn it on low for about 1 hour with all the ingredients.  I omitted the sugar and didn't miss it.  It was the hit at my New Year's Eve party.  I served it with frozen pound cake (it holds it's shape better when frozen), fresh strawberries, and canned pineapple chunks.  Fortunately, I doubled the receipe! It was that good.

Delicous and easy!  I omitted the water per other reviewers and used decaf coffee because of a kiddo. Also I halved the recipe and still had left overs after serving 3.  Used pound cake, strawberries, and marshmellows.  I would suggest putting cake in the fridge or freezer before serving to keep it from falling apart in the chocolate.

Yeah Baby! I added a bit more heavy cream for good measure then poured it into a chocolate fountain. Even those who don't care much for chocolate (huh?) get into it.

I used 1 bag of Semi sweet and 2 bags of milk choc as suggested, left out coffee and water, and I made a HUGE plate of pineapple, bananas, pound cake, marshmallows,strawberries and my guests ate it ALL! This is delish, but without the water is VERY thick and fudgy. I will try adding the water next time. Left out due to other suggestions, but it was SO good even without it! YUMMY!!!

I made this for a party of 20 people, and was worried I'd have too little dip (I sliced up a bunch of bananas, a poundcake and a large box of strawberries) and even then, at the end, more than half remained.

I agree with the others--the coffee and water weren't needed at all, and the chocolate had a creamy texture. I loved how it stayed smooth and didn't become grainy. I will definitely make this again, but probably halve the recipe.

This was quick and easy. I halved the recipe and there was still lots leftover. All in all, it's a nice basic recipe for chocolate fondue. I'd like to get really creative with this and try addinf cookie crumbs or maybe mint flavorings..

This has been VERY popular at several parties!!! Freezes very well if made ahead or for leftovers. Just thaw and re-melt in the microwave. Great with fresh pineapple or pound cake for dipping too.

i took everyone else's advice and used chocolate chips and skipped the water. i used a bag of milk chocolate and a half a bag of semi-sweet b/c that's what i had laying around; next time, i'd probably just use a bag of milk chocolate as i'm not a fan of darker chocolate and that little bit made a difference. i just used one small container of cream b/c i hate to buy two for just a small amount more. and i skipped the coffee b/c i decided i wanted to put in some kahlua instead. (definitely didn't put enough in.) but overall, consistency  and flavor were great even with all the shortcuts i took and my fiance loved it, chocoholic that he is.

This was ahhhmazing!!!  I couldn't decide between this one or the Flaming Turtle recipe from The Melting Pot so I mixed the recipes together.  I did this one first, except I probably doubled the coffee granuals and skipped the water and sugar, just heated a bit of the cream in the microwave and disolved the coffee in there.  Then I added about a 1/2 a cup of caramel ice cream topping and a cup of toasted pecans.  In fairness to this recipe, I tasted it before I tweaked and it was perfect.  I just wanted caramel and pecans!!  We were fishing and fighting for the pecans and the caramel gives a great texture that coats dippers well.  I'd serve this to guests either way in a heartbeat, I loved the coffee kick!  Thanks!  :)

Awesome!  I used half milk chocolate, half dark chocolate -- otherwise I think this would be sickeningly sweet.  I also used brewed coffee in place of the hot water/instant coffee.  The coffee taste wasn't very noticeable, just enough to make a nice dipping consistency.  Made it in the crock pot, as another reviewer suggested -- melted chocolate and cream together on low for 2 hours, then add the coffee and sugar.  Perfect!  The pot was licked clean.

I made this recipe for a holiday party.  My husband likes dark chocolate, so I used bitter sweet chocolate (rather than milk chocolate).  It was especially good with oranges and strawberries.

This is a nice basic chocolate recipe.  I have used similar over the years and just needed the basic portions of chocolate to cream.  I used semi-sweet chocolate chips (24 oz) and 1 cup heavy whipping cream and a little vanilla.  I did not use the coffee, I am sure it would taste great with it but with company I wasn't sure if everyone liked coffee.  And I didn't add the extra surar.  We dipped pound cake, strawberries, marshmellows, banannas, apples, and pretzels (not a big winner).  If your fondue winds up a little thick add a little heavy whipping cream and thin it to the consistancy you like.  If it is too thin add more chocolate!!!

I used a store brand milk chocolate chunks and it was so good!  It didn't really have a 'coffee' flavor to me - it tasted more like brownie mix!

Easy recipe with great results. I made it in my fondue pot, and used Homestead Buttermilk instead of heavy cream. I also premixed my water and coffee.

Absolutely perfect.  Made for a party and not one drop left!  After reading some other reviews, I used 2 bags (11.5 oz. ea.) milk chocolate chips and 1 12 oz. bag of semi-sweet chips.  Will be my go-to recipe for a chocolate fondue.

This was delicious and so easy.  As suggested in some previous reviews, I used 2 bags of milk chocolate morsels and one bag semi-sweet (Ghiradelli), and I did not add the hot water or sugar.  It tasted delicious, but next time I may add a little water, it was just a little thick.

Easy wonderful dessert.  Easy to make until smooth on the stovetop, then we transferred to our 70's electric fondue pot.  Scewered bananas, pound cake (made with rum), strawberries, Granny Smith apples, marshmallows....so good.  No need to do the instant coffee thing....some minted Baileys (1/2 cup) did the trick for a luscious treat.

After reading most of the reviews I made this recipe and have a helpful idea.  I warmed the cream in the microwave, added the chocolate chips and most of them melted by just stirring into the warm cream.  Only returned to the MW for about 1 minutes longer.  I'm going to put the cold chocolate into my electric fondue pot tomorrow night to melt.  I already tasted it and it really is GOOD!!

Very good.  For dipping, we used green and red apples, orange sections, strawberries and angel food cake.  I used brewed coffee instead of instant coffee.  I should have added more (I used 2 tbsp, next time I'll try 1/4 to 1/3 cup).

This was an incredibly easy fondue to make.  I completely omitted the coffee, and I added a bit more sugar to make it sweeter.  I halved the recipe, but still had a ton left over so I used someone's suggestion and made truffles - a bonus second dessert from the same recipe!  I will definitely use this the next time I need chocolate fondue.

This was the best chocolate fondue I have ever tasted. I halved the recipe, used chocolate chips instead grated chocolate, and substituted Kahlua for the coffee. I also made mine in a double boiler (a glass bowl over a saucepan of water - the best way to melt chocolate) and then transferred it to a small slow cooker on the warm setting. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and it was incredible. This is the recipe I will be using every time I make chocolate fondue from now on.

i have made this many times in order to mimic the melting pot's fondue.  it always turns out fantastic.  i substitute a liquor such as amaretto for the instant coffee.  it goes well with basic fondue recipe room this site (i half the recipe and subtitute beer for the milk).  i also always make the cream cheese pound cake I recipe from the site to dip in the chocolate fondue.  mm, heaven!

I made this for a special evening with friends.  Everyone loved it!  I halved the recipe and substituted Bailey's for the coffee because we like it better.  We didn't actually get to eat it until after we came back from the play.  We reheated it in the microwave but it lost some of its smoothness.  Still, everything we dipped in this chocolate fondue, especially strawberries, was delectable!

Excellent and so simple to make!  I came to the site, picked this recipe, and made it that day for a wedding shower luncheon for my daughter.  Instead of coffe, I added Kalua as someone suggested.  We used strawberries, kiwi fruit, bananas, apples and pretzels.  Everybody loved this dessert and I must thank you for the rave reviews I got!

So simple and came out perfect. Used a combo of milk choc and semi-sweet chips. Very quick, perfect for company. Helpful hint - let the cream come to room temperature, lets the chocolate melt more quickly and is smoother.

The was great--and SO easy.  I used milk chocolate morsels instead of shaved block chocolate.  I will definitely make this again.  It saves nicely too--makes a fabulous hot fudge sauce the next day!

I made a half batch of this recipe and eliminated the water.  I used half a bag of dark chocolate chips and 1/2 bag of semi sweet chips.  Kids and adults enjoyed it and the chocolate coated various fruits, marshmallows and pretzels nicely.  Great flavor!  I put the excess in a glass dish and topped it with nuts and heath brittle and put it in the fridge.  Once it cooled it was like a cross between a chocolate bar and fudge and every bit as delicious.

Very easy and tasty. I made it for Valentine's day and my boyfriend and I loved it. I used chocolate chips like some of the other reviewers (spent a little more for Ghirardelli and used 2 bags of bittersweet, one bag of milk because we prefer dark chocolate). We both preferred fruit and pretzels as dippers to cake and vanilla wafers (too sweet). And yes, it makes A LOT. If I made this again for 2-6 people, I would halve the recipe. One reviewer suggested making truffles out of the leftovers, which sounds like a great idea but I haven't tried it. Bought a tiny crock pot at a thrift store for the occasion, so I'll probably making this again -- it would be great for a party!

I halved the recipe for 4 people and there was plenty leftover.  It was delicious and easy to make but couldn't taste the coffee, which one guest appreciated.  I used chopped milk chocolate bars instead of grated chocolate, melted with cream in glass bowl over boiling water, served in fondue pot.  Froze leftovers to reuse.

Our family loved this!  We used Ghirardelli's milk chocolate chips, left out the coffee and the hot water.  And to really put it over the top, if you put the left overs in a baking dish and let it sit in the fridge overnight, you'll have some wonderful fudge.

Served this at my Christmas party this year.  I did this right in my fondue pot on low.  Substituted 1/4 c fresh espresso for the instant coffee and water.  I wanted a less sweet, more "adult" taste, so used dark chocolate instead of milk chocolate.  It was a huge hit with cubes of pound cake, bananas, strawberries and sugar cookies!

Made this for New Years Eve/our anniversary.  Cut it to 1/4 of recipe for just the two of us, and used milk chocolate chips. It was so easy and excellent! We dipped strawberries, bananas, pound cake, & marshmallows. A great ending to a special meal. Thanks for a keeper of a recipe!

This was a great recipe and by far the best chocolate fondue I have ever made. It was a mild, smooth tasting chocolate and the consistency was good for dipping. I followed the recipe as written except used brewed coffee instead of the water and coffee granules. It did however make a lot. I had 15 people in and I have about 2 cups of the mixture left. This may be because there were other things as well not because we didn't like it. I will try to freeze this and save for another time. Thanks for sharing this great recipe.

This was wonderful..my bf who doesn't love chocolate or sweets in general pretty much inhaled this. I wasn't going to use the water, I intially used some hot milk with the coffee, but it was thick & I figured I'd try it..didn't cause the chocolate to seize up and actually made the consistancy better.
Did this with strawberries, raspberries, pretzels, marshmallows, graham crackers, and pieces of Twinkies (which was pretty sweet) Will definately make again.

Thinned out the next day with heavy cream. A huge hit. The fondue was attacked daily and it still took us a week to finish it off.

This was super easy to make and everyone loved it!  I omitted the coffee and water and used Lindt Milk chocolate.  Prepared it in my fondue pot on the stove - it was ready in 5 minutes.  I made this for a New Years Party with ages ranging from 2 - 45 - everyone raved about it.  We dipped marshmallows, donut holes, bananas, rice krispie treats, strawberries and pound cake.  I will definitely make this again!  The other reviews are correct this does make a lot.  We had 8 adults and 12 kids and we probably ate 1/3 of it.  Next time I will adjust the servings accordingly.

This fondue is fantastic!  I substituted the coffee powder for 1/3 cup of freshly brewed coffee & 2 pkgs. milk chocolate chips for the bar kind, based on other's reviews.  Since I used the brewed coffee, I ommitted the water. Next time I would add more coffee so I could taste more of the flavor. I used my small crock pot on low & this kept the chocolate warm enough without burning it!Thanks Daysee for making my friend's birthday so special!

Scaled this to 16 servings for 4 people.  Used Callebaut Belgian chocolate chippits from the bulk store.  Calls for 11 oz. but I ended up with almost a pound (used 1/2 milk and 1/2 dark).  Added enough cream to make it the right consistency (about 1/2 a cup). Did not add water and I'm not really sure why it needs the sugar. Added the 1 tsp. instant coffee granules but could not taste coffee - I think it just gave it depth.   A beautiful sophisticated taste, and the consistency was perfect.  It adhered nicely to the fruit without alot of dripping.

This was delish...I made it for V-day and my family raved about it.  I scaled it down a bit and used 1/4 lb milk chocolate and 1/4 lb dark chocolate.  I used amaretto in place of the coffee and had to add a little bit more cream to make it creamier but it worked.  I will do this again!

Yummy!  I made this for a SuperBowl Party!  It was quick and easy and delicious.  With it I served, pretzels, marshmallows, bananas, angelfood cake and vanilla wafers.  I didn't use 32 oz of grated chocolate and used 2 bags of Hersheys Milk Chocolate Chips.  I'm also not a fan of coffee and chocolate together so I skipped that.  Per other reviewers I also omitted the sugar and water and ended up with the perfect consistency.  I will definitely make this again, only next time I may try it with the Baileys Irish Cream or almond extract!

As others said, it was a lot like work to grate the chocolate.  So after doing one bar with the grater, I put the rest in the food processor.  Very easy and very yummy!

I used this recipe and it was LOVED by everyone. I omitted the water ( as was suggested) by other users but had it in a chocolate fountain. I will definitely add the water next time. 

If it was in a normal fondue pot-- the consistency would be perfect!

I tried this recipe out the night I got my chocolate fountain... With some of the other raters saying that it was a bit thin, I thought it would be great for the fountain... especially since the person who posted this put up a picture of the chocolate fondue in a fountain. I tried this (left out the coffee), and it was very good. Only problem was that it was too thick and i had to add almost 2 cups of oil for it to properly run through my fountain. (I halved the recipe and needed to add almost 2 cups of oil.) It was good but I was disappointed that I had to add that much oil, which then took away the good chocolate flavor.. If anyone has a good suggestion, please let me know.

I halved the recipe and it was enough for a potluck party of around 15 people. So easy and so tasty. I used semi-sweet chips and used brown sugar, kaluha, and instant coffee powder. Delicious with pound cake, strawberries, apples, marshmallows and bananas. Reheated in microwave and poured into mini-crockpot. Warm up the crockpot to keep the chocolate liquid but unplug it or it will burn (for the pots without dials).

amazing.  1/2 this recipe for sure.  I did and it still fed 5 with leftovers too.  I substituted coffee liquor for the instant coffee.  Served with banana's, pineapple, strawberries, and wafer cookies.

So delicious!  Though be careful of overcooking the chocolate sauce.  I did and the sauce, instead of having a smooth texture, ended up being rather lumpy.

yummmmy and just the way i want my chocolate fondue. i left out the water, halved the sugar and used coffee liqueur instead of instant coffee powder. i also used ghiradelli's milk chocolate and served it with marshmallows, pound cake, bananas and strawberries. i'm not a fan of chocolate but the fondue was excellent.

I splurged and used Guylian Belgian milk chocolate for our New Years eve party.
This was so good !
 For those that do not like coffee, you can't taste much coffe at all, and of course you can use decaf if you worry about caffine.
This recipe made alot so I used the rest the next day for truffles. Just roll into balls in unsweetened chocolate powder and dessert reborn again !
YUM !

I thought this was pretty good.  I'm not sure if I would add the coffee the next time I make it.  This reheated well in the microwave the next day for leftovers.

Excellent recipe!  The coffee gives added flavor, yet no one can tell that there is coffe in it - not like a mocha.  Have made this several times and friends and family all love it.

It was my first time making chocolate fondue and it was a huge hit!  However, I did omit the coffee powder & water-instead, I added a 1/2 cup more of  cream, and it turned out great!  I had 8 guests over and there was enough left over to make a few truffles (for myself) the next day!

Made this for a dinner party tonight. It was easy. I followed tips from other reviewers and left out the coffee and water. Also, as one reviewer said, warm the heavy cream a little before adding, that worked great. Everyone loved it.

Unbelieveably good!!  I did not add the water or coffee.  Other than that, prepared as written.  Served with strawberries, bananas, marshmallows, pound cake, and pretzels. It does make a lot.  We had 11 people and still have quite a bit left over.  What a shame to have yummy leftovers for later!

This was soooooooooooooo good!  I made this for New Year's dinner dessert, and served it with cut up bananas, strawberries, brownie chunks, marshmallows, pretzels, and pineapple.  I omitted the coffee.  If you're looking for a good, simple chocolate fondue recipe, look no further!!

I thought it was just OK, a little bit too strong of flavor for me. I used it in our chocolate fountain and it tended to get a little too thick even after I added some cooking oil as it suggested in the directions on the fountain. Not sure I would use the recipe again.

This was so good.  I had a small piece of bittersweet chocolate so I threw that in with the milk chocolate.  I also halved the recipe and the quantity was perfect for 4 people.

Wow this was great.  It makes alot of dip so I halfed the recipe and still didn't finish it.  I ground up coffee beans fine instead of using instant coffee and it was wonderful.  I also used a double boiler.

This was SOOOO good!  After reading the reviews, I made some modifications.  Used Ghiradelli milk chocolate chips and omitted the water.  Instead of using instant coffee powder, I just added a little bit of strong vanilla coffee from the pot, and it was really good!  It's great without the coffee too.  We dipped strawberries, bananas, graham crackers, marshmallows, pound cake, and cheesecake.  YUMMY!!

Yum! We made this for New Year's Eve, and I followed the recipe to a T.  The chocolate was so creamy and smooth.  We dipped strawberries, bananas, kiwis, marshmallows and pound cake.  The only thing I wish I had done, was cut the recipe in half.  There were only five of us, and I think that we'll be eating fondue for a week (not that that's a bad thing!).

Excellent and easy recipe for fondue.  Had girlfriends over for fondue night and they also loved it.  Used leftover brewed coffee (1/3 C.) instead of the coffee powder and didn't add the water.  Dipped pound cake, strawberries, marshmallows, green apples, pretzels, and Ruffles - success!

I made this for New Year's Eve and it was fantastic!   I made the entire thing in my slow cooker.  Everything melted just fine and had a nice creamy consistency.  I did omit the sugar as it was already  sweet enough.  We used pretzels, pound cake, oreos, strawberries and bananas for dipping.  This recipe does make a huge amount so keep that in mind.  We had a good bit left over but it does make a great ice cream topping.

As a fondue, I'd have to say that I wasn't overly impressed - which is why I rated it a 3.  It was good, but nothing spectacular.  However, I noted that many other reviewers made truffles with the leftovers and I have to say, that as a truffle center - this was absolutely AMAZING! I rolled them into 1-inch balls, froze them for an hour or so then made a coating (16 oz chocolate chips & 3 tbls shortening, melted) to dip them in. Everyone LOVED them - even a co-worker who isn't really into sweets raved about them.

I love this recipe however the proportions are insane. We use less than a quarter of this recipe and we're a large family of 6.

This is a great recipe. You can omit the white sugar and instant coffee, and use warmed milk instead of water with great results as well.

Great recipe!  I used 2 bags milk chocolate chips and 2 bags semi-sweet and omitted the coffee granules.  I did add the water that others omitted because the fondue seemed too thick to me.  I kept it warm in a crock pot and got rave reviews!

This was great!  I did 24 oz of milk chocolate and 12 of semi-sweet, and also omitted the water.  It was perfect in our electric fondue pot.

It was great and easy. I used dark chocolate (cut in pieces, not grated), because that's what I had in hand. I will try it with other chocolate flavors as well (I bet it will be amazing with milk chocolate with hazelnuts).

This recipe is so easy! I left out the coffee as I wasn't sure if others would like the taste. I also left out the water because I've always been taught that water and chocolate do not mix and the chocolate will seize up. It was fine and the right consistency with out it. I cut the recipe in half (for a 8 person dinner party) and still had some left over! Very simple and very good recipe.

This recipe was exactly what I was looking for!  I mistakenly added the cream after melting some of the chocolate and it turned into a big dry glop of chocolate.  I let it melt again and it came out fine.  Next time I would like to try it with white chocolate.

Look no further for your chocolate fondue recipe. SO yummy!  Big hit at holiday fondue party.  I used guittard milk chocolate chips and a tsp of kahlua instead of the coffee/water.  It didn't taste like coffee but it made the chocolate flavor pop.  This recipe makes a lot. I cut the recipe in half and it was still a lot for 4 adults and 3 kids.

This was pretty good. I scaled it down to use 2 oz. of Ghiradelli semi-sweet chocolate; added milk instead of heavy cream because that's what I had and followed the rest of the recipe as stated, except I omitted the sugar. Like lots of reviewers, I made it in a small saucepan first and then transferred it to a fondue bowl. I think it might be too sweet with milk chocolate; the most I would try is half semi-sweet and half milk. Thanks for a quick and easy recipe.

I used Giradelli milk chocolate chips and Grand Marnier in this recipe and it ROCKS!!  We have served this at several events from girls night to friends over for dinner even for desert Easter Sunday lunch.  Always well liked.  Never served with out an recipe request!

I used a tsp of orange extract instead of the coffee powder and it was fabulous.  As some others have mentioned, the leftovers make delicious truffles.

I've made this fondue for Valentine's Day for the past three years and it is wonderful!   This recipe does yield a lot of fondue (even if you cut it in half) so here's an idea for the leftovers:  Warm leftover fondue for about 15 seconds in the microwave and spread on Pillsbury crescent rolls (before rolling them up), bake as directed on crescent roll package and sprinkle with powdered sugar.  Yum!

Great recipe and really easy.  I made it in a double boiler.  While the chocolate and cream melted, I mixed the sugar, vanilla, and instant coffee granules.  Once the chocoalte was melted, I added the hot water to the coffee mixture and then put it in with the chocolate.  I left the chocolate sitting in the double boiler without a heat source and it stayed "dippable" for 3.5 hours.  This does make A LOT!  There were leftovers even with 15 people eating it.
UPDATE:  I’ve made this for a potluck a couple of times. Put all the liquids, coffee, and sugar in a crockpot, then mix in the chocolate. Set it on “warm” and it turns out great!

This recipe is delicious, but it came out very thick when I made it- almost too thick for dipping.  I stirred in milk little by little until it was the consistency I desired, and it was much better.  We made such a large amount for only 6 people, but now we have a LOT left over to reheat for just the two of us! :o)  Will definitely make again.

Fabulous!  I cut the recipe in half, and left out the coffee.  It made more than enough for the six of us, and was perfectly delicious!!  Served with halved large marshmallows, macaroon cookie pieces, strawberries, and bananas.  Thanks for a terrific recipe!

Really yummy.  Left out the espresso and the water (seemed thin enough but should have added it- just a little too thick).  Really good and everyone really seemed to like it which surprised me as it was essentially only bagged chocolate chips!  Yay! :)

I went on a ladies retreat and served this side by side with the Butterscotch fondue (also from Allrecipes).  It was the hit of the weekend!  Even cold the next morning, we were dipping pretzels, stirring it into coffee, putting it on fruit salad, and then rewarming it for dessert that evening.  (Did I mention we were a bunch of gals getting away from it all, and chocolate usually plays a major part? :)  Be forewarned, this makes A LOT, not that that's a bad thing.  In the future, I may try flavoring with orange (Grand Marnier or Cointreau) or Raspberry liquer.  This is a keeper.

Just wonderful!  Made it for a friends' get-together and everyone raved about it.  I didn't add the water, and it didn't seem worse for it.  I used instant espresso powder.

This made a wonderful Valentine's day dessert when paired with fresh strawberries. I used 5 milk chocolate bars and about 1/8 cup half and half and it made enough with a little left over for the two of us. Thank you for sharing your recipe!

Fabulous! I was looking for a relatively easy chocolate fondue that we could use in our new fondue pot.  I made this for my friend's birthday party, and it was the hit!  The chocolate has the perfect consistency - we'll definitely use it again.  We dipped angel food cake, marshmallows, and fruit - yummy!

This is a wonderful fondue. Delicious and EASY.  I used instant cappuccino mix instead of the coffee granules and still used the water.  I kept wisking it in the pot while cooking and it was SMOOTH.  The kids loved it. Will definitely make this again!

This  recipe was so easy and soooo good.  It was my first time making fondue, and it came out great!  I used brewed coffee instead of instant, as one review suggested, and it was great.  My boyfriend, who doesn't care much for dessert, raved about this!  I definitely recommend!

Holey moley, my thumb almost fell off from all that grating! I almost couldn't do it by myself. But the product was nice. We were 11 girls with lots of leftovers. I would say this is perfect for 15-16 people (or more if you've already filled up on a big dinner)

This recipe was excellent!  I made this for the first time for a dinner party of 10 guests and everyone raved!  Only substitution was instant espresso instead of instant coffee.  Served fondue with grahm crackers, marshmellows, angelfood cake, bananas, strawberries and grapes.  So good, thank you!

Very, very good.  I used 1/2 semi sweet and 1/2 bittersweet - more of a sophisticated flavor.  It was yummy.  Stick to the milk chocolate or semi-sweet for the kids though. Besides a variety of fruit, I bought those little creme puffs in the freezer section - they were delicious dipped in the chocolate!

This was fabulous!  Recently had a fondue party with some girlfriends, and they absolutely loved it.  There was around ten of us and there was still plenty of leftover, so I think I will halve the recipe next time.

I used International Coffee's mocha powder in mine and everyone loved it. I served it at a fondue baby shower that I hosted & it was a hit. It made a huge amount so unless you need to feed a few dozen don't double it. We had it with rice crispie treats, pound cake, graham stix & vanilla wafers. It was so much more fun than a traditional cake.

I've made this twice now, and both times everyone has loved it! I followed the recipe exactly, and it made lots. I think in future, I might halve the recipe, as I always have a lot left over. Another reviewer suggested making truffles using the leftovers, and they are great too. I rolled balls of the chilled fondue mixture in oreo or graham crumbs, and keep them refridgerated. Every now and again you can catch a note of strawberry.... enjoy!

I 1/2'd this recipe using 3/4c. heavy cream (which is a little more than half), it was very good, with the coffee giving it a little kick. I would definitely make this again.

I thought the fondue was a little thin-but I only used 3/4 lb of chocolate and no coffee so perhaps added too much cream.  The flavor was wonderful though.

I tried this recipe for my first-ever fondue dinner for family.  I omitted the instant coffee granules, as we had several young children over.  All in all, it was wonderful.  It received rave reviews from everyone in the family.

Huge hit!!! I had a party with my girlfriends today and everyone loved it. I did leave out the coffee and water. I used Ghiradelli milk chocolate baking chips. I did add a little more cream and did add a little water because it was just a little thick. It turned out perfect. I served with strawberries, pound cake, cheese cake, and brownies.

It came out as one  thick mess from the heavy cream.  I tried to thin it out with hot water but it became clumpy and oily. But the kids still ate it because after all, it's chocolate.  Next time I'll take the simple route and just melt the chocolate without adding anything.

Made this on New Year's Eve, and it was awesome, awesome, awesome!  We dipped bananas (yum!), strawberries, cinnamon graham crackers, and pretzels.  It was so delicious.  I also halved the recipe and it was more than enough, so we have extra that the kids put on their ice cream.  Definitely a keeper!

I made this for Christmas Eve, and it was very good. As other reviewers suggested, I halved the recipe, ending up using the equivalent of one bag of chocolate chips (combination of semi-sweet and  milk. I also skipped the water and added a shot of brandy instead of the coffee. My husband and I just finished off what was left, and it reheated well in the microwave. Very smooth and just as good as when it was first made. Thank you for a good recipe!

Great fondue sauce!  I used the symphony bar with the tiny bits of toffee in it and substituted half the listed amount of postum for the coffee (we're not coffee drinkers) and left the rest.  We dipped bananas and ritz crackers , cake, pretzels, coconut macaroons, rice krispie squares.  Possibilities are endless. We do fondue every Christmas Eve and every New Year's eve and I think I'll use this new sauce this year. It's yummy and not excessively rich.  Thanks for submitting.

Big hit at my party of 20.  I'm glad I didn't half the recipe because we used about 5 cups. Don't add the 1/3 water, just add to desired consistency.  It went so well with BEST POUND CAKE also from allrecipes.  Served it with strawberries, marshmallows and pretzels as well.  Guests used leftovers to spread over vanilla ice cream and the birthday cake.  Thanks for this keeper.
One guest asked what chocolate I used, I used one pkg Nestle semi-sweet chocolate morsels and one pkg of store brand choc morsels because that is what I had.  Worked out so well I'll make it that way all the time.  No sense in changing a hit.  Thanks for the recipe.

VERY YUMMY!  Make sure to read how much it makes though because it made too much for us...I also used bags of chocolate chips and ommitted the coffee (only because we didn't have any).  I made it on the stovetop and then transferred it into a fondue pot.  We had strawberries, bananas, twinkies, and oreos that we dipped in the chocolate.  YUM.

This was pretty good. It makes a lot so there is plenty left over. There was five of us and we LOVE chocolate! I was surprised at how much was left. We dipped what others recommended...pretzels, marshmellows, bananas, apples,and rolled them in toasted almonds...that was the best part!

Was a winner!  I used semi sweet chocolate chips and started it over the stove. Everyone dipped the strawberries, bananas, pound cake, mini creampuffs. Next time I would try angel food cake pieces, teddy grahams for the kids and pretzel sticks.

This was very good - I couldn't taste the coffee flavor.  If I make again, I will add more.  I left out the water, not sure why it's called for in the first place.

Made this recipe this weekend.  I used 1/3 cup of espresso instead of the coffee and water.  I also substituted 2/3 of the chocolate for semi-sweet chocolate instead of milk chocolate.  Served with marshmallows, pound cake, raspberries and strawberries.  Next time I'd like to try bacon and donut holes as dippers as well.

I make this every year for Valentines Day. My family loves it! I serve with all the fruit other people listed, but also crushed nuts (the banana in the fondue dipped in the nuts is amazing, as is the marshmallow). But don't forget to have some potato chips on hand! The salty sweet is soooo good!

So good! I halved the recipe. I used 12oz of milk chocolate chips and about 4oz of semi-sweet chips, and omitted the added sugar. it was very easy to make. The whole family loved it and we warmed up the leftovers for dessert the next night!

This was easy and delicious. And like others have mentioned, leftovers (once cooled) can be rolled into bonbons and they are delicious! Some have mentioned leaving out the water. I used the 1/3 cup water because it was much to thick without it.

We dipped marshmallows, strawberries, apples, pineapple, and bananas.  Best chocolate fondue sauce ever!  Thanks so much for the recipe.  Debbie

I only bought one bag of semi sweet chocolate chips, thinking that would be enough. I didn't realize it would take three bags! I added a whole box of Baker's dark chocolate because it was the only other chocolate I had. It turned out perfectly! We barely even ate a quarter of this. I will cut it in half next time.

Made this last night for NYE party. It was a big hit. I added Baileys Irish cream as part of the cream amount. Used real coffee instead if instant. Used milk chocolate and semi sweet chocolate chips. Recommend using a good quality chocolate.  Didn't add the sugar and it was plenty sweet. Will make again.

I prefer less sweet chocolate than milk chocolate so I used Ghirardelli semi-sweet chocolate to give it a darker more intense flavor.  Didn't have any instant coffee on hand so I  omitted that and the 1/3 c of hot water. I added 2 oz of Grand Marnier in its place. This gave it a wonderfully subtle hint of orange to the richer chocolate flavor. Will definitely make another time

This is a quick and easy way to do chocolate fondue.  It is HUGE though.  1/2 of the recipe is more than enough.

This is fabulous, so rich and smooth.  I used 1/4 dark chocolate as I like the intensity of the flavor and health benefits of dark chocolate.  I also used the microwave, 1 minute at 70% power, stirring until melted, adding additional minutes until it was all melted. Be careful to check it every minute so the chocolate isn't scorched.  Thanks so much for this wonderful treat.

This was amazing!  So delicious!  I disagree with the other reviewers who claim the coffee was over powering.  I didn't find that at all and I even used instant expresso in stead of coffee, which has a stronger flavor.  I used milk chocolate chips, so no shredding of chocolate required.  Very easy and amazing taste.  

I served with cheesecake bites, pound cake, strawberries, pears, navel oranges, banana, pineapple, and honeydew melon.  A big hit.  

It did make an awful lot (would halve this recipe next time, 5 of us only ate 1/3 to 1/2).  I attempted the truffle recipe another user suggested, but I found the left overs to be too soft even after being refrigerated overnight.

I omitted coffee, only because I didn't have any on hand. I added 2 T. Kaluha Liqueur mocha flavor in place of coffee. I used  2 milk chocolate (11.5 oz each) and one semi-sweet, bag (11.5 oz) of chocolate chips. I did not add the water, either.  It makes a lot, as other reviewers said, but I won't waste any of it...too yummy!

I used a combination of a ratio of 2/3 milk chocolate chips to 1/3 semi-sweet chocolate chips. I used Ghiradelli brand chocolate chips. I used the suggestion to cut back on the water a bit and I dissolved the coffee ahead of time and heated up the cream a bit before adding the chocolate. Was a big hit!

This was my 1st time making chocolate fondue.  I made it for a Christmas Party.  It was such a big hit!!!  I made it exactly as the recipe states, except at the end I added a little flour to thicken it up a tad.  Wonderful recipe!

Delicious! I halved the recipe and we still have tons leftover. I used fresh brewed coffee as a substitute for the instant coffee  powder and hot water. I used half milk chocolate and half dark chocolate. I would highly recommend this to others and will definitely be making this again.

OMG why didn't I see the suggestion to omit the water. Super watery chocolate. Kept hoping it would congeal after removed from the heat source. The family still ate it with PLENTY left over for another time time week possibly.

Really good. I used half and half in place of heavy cream, semisweet chips, and leftover coffee from that morning's pot. You do not need any extra sugar! Best with strawberries, banana and pretzels.

I made this for my parents new years party and it was amazing! I put out a bowl of pretzels and rice crispies and you dip the pretzels in the chocolate and then role it in the rice crispies and instead of one Tbsp of instant coffee I used one tsp of instant espresso and I used 11.5 oz. of milk chocolate chips and 24 oz. of Semi-sweet chocolate chips and 5.oz of dark chocolate chips it all blended together very well and I'm looking forward to more parties so I can use the same recipe

I altered the recipe a bit, as suggested by another reviewer, using 2 bags of milk chocolate chips to 1 bag of semi-sweet and leaving out the 1/3 cup of water (just used enough water to dissolve the instant coffee).  Not only did this make GREAT fondue, but it sets up just like fudge.  So now this is also my go-to fudge recipe, so easy and delicious!

This was absolutely delicious! I had it while entertaining friends. One of the comments was that they didnt care what there was to dip in it, they just wanted the chocolate;) I mixed half dark chocolate and half milk. Thanks for recipe. I will pass it on.

This is a great recipe! I cut everything in half, and omitted the coffee powder, white sugar, and hot water. We put the chocolate (I used semi-sweet as that is what I had), cream, and vanilla in the fondue pot, and stirred until everything was combined. It was sweet enough, and was a pretty good consistency. Could have been a little thicker, so if you like it thicker than reduce the cream. Made plenty of chocolate for dipping! We enjoyed dipping marshmallows, strawberries, banana slices, and peanut butter balls. My son really enjoyed this!

I don't drink caffeine, so I added Kahlua instead. I also omitted the water. Delicious! There was a lot left over, so I still have to figure out something to do with it (fed 6).

I liked it.  I used expensive milk chocolate bricks bought from Whole Foods.  I didn't "grate" the chocolate, as that was a pain, but I did chop it up into bits.  It melted perfectly fine, and fast.  I, too, used 1/3 a cup of fresh coffee, and it worked quite nicely.  I have one of those single-cup makers for coffee, which are indespensible for things like this!  Anyhow - it tasted and worked fine for my fondue.  Easy to make and definitely a keeper.

Delicious and Easy! I did omit the coffee and the water. I used 2 bags of Nestle Milk Chocolate Chips vs the grated chocolate. Made in my fondue pot....Everybody at our gathering loved it...especially on marshmallows, fruit, and rice krispy treats. I had a bit left over and it reheated fabulously in the fondue pot today. Thank you for a great recipe! Happy New Year!

Easy & delicious! I deviated and cut this recipe in half since we were serving 8. I used half dark chocolate (60% cacao) and 1/2 milk chocolate. I used coffee instead of water and omitted the instant coffee. I also omitted the sugar. The best dippers seemed to be mini pretzels! Other dippers included under ripe bananas, strawberries, marshmallows, biscotti and graham crackers.  I will edit then I try the suggestion to use the leftovers to make truffles :)

Made this for our Christmas eve chocolate fondue.  Fabulous!!  I actually 1/3 the recipe and it was plenty for the 6 of us.  (1 bag of chocolate chips.)  Husband said it was better than the one I made last year.  Will keep using as our traditional recipe for fondue.

I've made this twice now and love it! My husband and I add Bailey's Irish Cream or Carolin's Irish Cream to the mix instead of the coffee

This is such an easy and failproof chocolate fondue recipe.  The coffee really adds something great to it.  As there is only two of use, we cut the recipe down a lot and it works magnificently.  Reheats well too.

Loved it but modified as follows based on the reviews and my preference for dark chocolate: Used bittersweet chocolate (60% cocoa), substituted Kaluha for the water and coffee and skipped the sugar as I was worried it would not disolve fully.  Awesome!

I have never written a review for this website, but this recipe deserves it!  WOW!  We made this for Valentines day and it was a big hit!  We did use brewed coffee instead of the instant (as people suggested) and we did not use the water.  We use pineapple, grapes, apple slices, bananas, pound cake, brownies, rice crispie treats, oreos,  and  marshmallows rolled in oreo and graham crackers.  My kids can't wait to make it again!

This was good, but the texture wasn't as smooth and creamy as I would've liked.  It seemd slighty grainy, but it didn't effect the flavor.

This was a HUGE success at a party that I hosted.  It's the perfect chocolate combonation for me!  Our favorite dipping items were pretzel sticks for salty and sweet and banana slices.  Marshmallows and strawberries also went over really well.  This makes a TON, we had left overs for days, but it reheats well!

Yum & easy!  I threw the chips and cream in the crock pot and when it melted I added the vanilla, coffee and sugar.  I omitted the water - I found the consistency good without the water.  It's a keeper!

Anybody ever tried anything like this in a crock pot??  If so, how would you go about it?  I don't have a fondue pot and would like to be able to make the sauce and use it throughout the night.

Turned out a little thin, but was still tasty.  I refrigerated the leftovers and it turned into a wonderful pudding-like texture which made a really great fruit dip!

This is a FANTASTIC fondue!! I used light cream instead of heavy cream and I just used  milk chocolate chips. It turned out so well and was sooo yummy!!! I halved this recipe because others said it made a huge batch. I was taking it to a party adn I didn't want to have a lot leftover. I knoew if I did, I would be the one eating it!!! I just used strawberries amd bananas with it. I was a hit!

This turned out so yummy.  I loved it and definitely will make it again.  I didn't use the coffee because I don't drink coffee and I was making it for my daughter's 11 year old birthday party.  I was thinking it would be delicious with Almond extract so I will try that next time.

Great recipe.  Very large portion.  We had 7 people and barely ate half.  Could easily cut the recipe in half for a smaller crowd...unless you want a lot of left overs.

We did "DIY Melting Pot" at our house last night with some friends, and this was (literally) the icing on the cake of a wonderful night!!  Absolutely DELICIOUS, and sooooo easy to make!  There is a ton left over, but somehow I doubt it will go to waste . . .

I quartered the recipe for a small fondue pot, using one 7 oz. Hershey's bar and it was wonderful.  I also used a splash of coffee liquor instead of granules. It didn't reheat the next day as nicely (had some separation of oil), but still tasted great.

This was so great!  I used 3 bags of 60% dark chocolate chips, and it was a little too dark for some of the kids, but the grown-ups loved it.  I may add one bag of milk chocolate chips next time.  I didn't do a good job of melting the chocolate.  It got all clumped up, but with a LOT of stirring and adding more whipping cream, it smoothed out, and was delicious.  We dipped fresh fruit, pound cake, and marshmallows.  Will definitely be using this recipe again.

Great flavor. I cut the recipe in half. Omitted the coffee powder and water and just used brewed coffee. The melted chocolate was thin so I'd probably leave out the water/coffee next time.

I halved the recipe and had lots for a smaller crowd (5 adults, 4 kids). I didn't use the coffee and used light cream, 2/3 milk chocolate, 1/3 semi-sweet chocolate (Callebaut chocolate I found in the bulk food aisle). I made it on the stove and then split it into 2 fondue pots and as another reviewer mentioned I added a couple tbsp Bailey's to the grown-up pot.  Dipped pieces of shortbread cookies (huge hit), chunks of marzipan, macadamia nuts and lots of fruit (raspberries, strawberries, dried cherries, mandarin slices). The next day I made pannekoeken (dutch pancakes) and spread the left over fondue (it melted nicely on the hot pancakes) and bananas.  Both uses were delicious and a huge hit.

This deserves one MILLION stars!!  This was my first time making fondue, and it was so easy!!  Simple to prepare and guests were very impressed!  I also used 1/3 c. fresh coffee as I was out of instant, as suggested by others.  Just HEAVENLY!! :-)  Thanks for sharing this- this will be a staple when we entertain!!!!!

Yummy! Used high-end chocolate (French truffles that were melted in the bag :( ).  Didn't have heavy cream so I just used milk (I just put in one cup of milk and about a pound of chocolate).  The coffee (used decaf) definitely added awesome.

Very good.  I used a local chocolatier's milk chocolate bark and it was fantastic.  We made it for valentine's day and it was a huge hit.

I halfed this recipe and used all the ingredients (including the coffee!).  This recipe is so fantastic...I think I am addicted and looking for an excuse to make it again.  I made it for a small baby shower and it was the pefect dessert and activity for the girls to do while sipping wine and catching up. I served pineapples, strawberries, pretzel rods, bananas, chocolate chip and oreo cookies.  So good.

This was incredible!  Used DARK chocolate instead of milk chocolate. OMG Turned out wonderful! Added the coffee but couldn't really taste it. Loved it with bananas.  Was even good left over although it began to get a little grainy.

This fondue was very good.  I initially made it with half milk chocolate and half dark chocolate.  It was really thick, so I added a little extra coffee and creamer.  It came out perfect!  I wish I had leftovers to make the truffles.

I made this chocoate fondue for a group lunch. It was so easy to make and tasted as good as the expensive chocolate fondue I've had at restaurants.  I recommend it with an electric fondue pan so the chocolate doesn't burn. It's much easier to regulate the temperature that way. Excellent for any chocolate lover!!

This was okay, but it's just as good (and uses fewer ingredients) to go with the standard choc chips (or good baking choc) and heavy cream.

YUMMY!! We didn't use the coffee powder and we used milk instead of hot water. I agree with someone else that you should add milk (or water) till you get to desired consistancy. Next time we will probably try just using milk instead of the heavy cream and water suggested, since we usually have those on hand.

Wish I had remembered to read the reviews first.  Made a LOT of fondue and the coffee was too strong for the non-coffee drinkers at the table.  Next time, I'd cut it out entirely and halve the recipe.  Still, a good start!

This was great ... didn't use the coffee (only because I didn't have any).  This makes quite a bit and we had a lot leftover.  We dipped: apples, strawberries, pretzel rods, graham crackers with marshmellow fluff, nilla cookies, chocolate chip cookes ... 

Will definitely make this again - thanks for the recipe!

I'll use this recipe every time I have chocolate fondue for dessert.  We used strawberries, pound cake, bananas, marshmallows, pineapple.  I did not use the coffee nor the water.  To make this very easy:  I used two bags of semi sweet chocolate chips and one container of whipping cream and one tsp. vanilla.  When it got too thick I added milk to thin.  Leftovers harden into a nice fudge.

This was excellent.  We made it for Valentines day, we ate it with strawberries, bananas, angel food cake.  The consistency was really great(omitting the water).  I also didn't use the coffee because I don't like it and we didn't have any on hand.
