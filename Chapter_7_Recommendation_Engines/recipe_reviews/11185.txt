I agree this is a time-consuming recipe, but it is definitely worth it!  I have made these several times and always get many compliments.  I even made them at Easter using an oval cookie cutter and decorated them like Easter eggs.  This year I will make Christmas trees and Snowmen.  Use your imagination!

my all time favorite christmas cookie.  my whole family loves these.  yes, they are time consuming to make, but so worth it.  For a crispier cookie, roll the dough thinner, for a softer cookie, go slightly thicker.  These freeze well.  Enjoy!

very tasty cookies. They are quite time-consuming to decorate, though it is worth it to see a beautiful finished product.

This cookie is really good.  Once completely cool, they are tender and crisp.  I ran out of flour after my first batch, but had some self rising flour.  I used it without adding the baking powder on my second batch and they came out perfectly!  Instead of the decoration described in the recipe, I used linzer cookie cutters to cut a design in the tip cookie.

A great tip I discovered is to warm the jam in the microwave.  Then, I just spooned it onto the bottom cookie and placed the top layer on it.  It oozed up into the cut out perfectly and looks like stained glass, a bit, when it cools.  I ran out of jam (I made so many!) so I had an idea to use white chocolate.  I melted the white chocolate, added a few drops of green food coloring and used it for filling the cookies with Christmas tree cutouts.  I added sprinkles before the chocolate cooled.  Yum!

I used this recipe to make the Jammy Dodger cookies from Doctor Who.  I omitted the cinnamon and didn't use the candies and green food coloring.  It turned out great, but the dough was really hard to roll out since it was so sticky.  I cut them out in circles and then I used a small round cutter in the middle to make the hole for half of them.  Think TARDIS self-destruct button! :D
