YUM! It was my first time cooking rutabaga. So much better than I expected. I used 1/2 cup of the chicken stock and added red bellpepper in with the onions. I used chicken apple sausage from Trader Joes, and chicken Andouile sausage from trader joes. It made the vegetables sweet and spicy. So good!  My husband loved this and is very excited about having rutabaga again.

I used this recipe in a "what's in season" dinner plan, as we had most of the ingredients on hand. Was very surprised how well it turned out. My 15 month old was Shovelling hand & spoon fulls into her mouth! I used a full cup of broth and 2 Tblsp of flour to thicken it like a gravy! Awesome!

Made this supper tonite & we loved it.  Reduced cholesterol by draining most of the grease off & increased the chicken stock to 1/2 cup.  I didn't have any rutabaga so I just added more carrots & potatoes.  Served it with corn bread griddle cakes.  Yum!

Perfect for the  cold weather, easy and fast to make, I substitute the pork for Johnsonville beef hot links which gave it kick of spicy flavor

Very easy and delicious.  I made it with a lot of extra chicken stock and then used a little flour so there was a lot of gravy for dunking bread.  My whole family loved it!
