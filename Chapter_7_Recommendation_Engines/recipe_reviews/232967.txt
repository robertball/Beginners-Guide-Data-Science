I made this recipe as is.  Used about 1.5 bell pepper, 1lg onion, and 1lb of chicken breast.  I sauteed the veggies first, then the chicken, both in a little oil.  When the chicken was nearly done I added the veggies back in and added the seasoning (entire recipe) w/ about 3/4c of water and covered.  I cooked it on medium high for about 7min.  The cornstarch thickened it really well, and the cumin was not overwhelming.  The spice was barely medium - you could omit or cut back the cayenne if you are sensitive to heat.

This was awesome!  I omitted the corn starch because I'm on a low-carb diet and it still was just absolutely phenomenal.  I'll be making this one again and again!

Such a great alternative to the over-salted fluorescent packages you buy at the store! I love that you can cut down the salt or kick up the heat as suits your tastes. I made this exactly as written this first time (just tripled) and loved it. After browning 2 sliced chicken breasts I added two very heaping tablespoons of seasoning with maybe 1/4 cup water and finished cooking the chicken while the sauce reduced, then I added back in previously sauted green pepper, red pepper and onion and finally a tomato at the very end. Delish! This is a keeper, and if you like the idea of making your own mixes, I highly suggest checking out Bill Enchols' Taco Seasoning I from this site. Now I'm all set, no more packets!

I made this exactly as is and have some stored so it's very handy! I also do a lot of freezer cooking so I cut up my chicken and steak strips, put in 2 heaping TBSP of seasoning, juice of 1 lime, and 1/8 cup corn oil and froze it in its own marinade. The results are wonderful and can thaw in the fridge if you take it out the night before, no need to add any kind of oil to sautÃ© the onions and peppers in because there is enough left over from doing the meat!

This was absolutely delicious!! I took 2 VERY large chicken breasts (about 2 lbs total), placed in a plastic bag, added 3T lemon juice and 2T vegetable oil, along with this seasoning exactly as written (I used the entire amount). Marinated the chicken in the refrigerator for an hour, then cooked in a saucepan with chopped red onion and bell pepper. It was absolutely DELICIOUS!! This will be my new go-to seasoning mix for fajitas!!! Perfect mixture of spices - not too spicy, not too mild!

I wasn't sure about the necessity of cornstarch in this spice mix but because other, similar, recipes on the web called for it, and because I marinated the meat (I used strip steak and shrimp) in the seasoning along with a little olive oil and a dribble of water I felt more comfortable.  In deference to Hubs' sensitive innards I omitted the cayenne which was no hardship as far as I'm concerned.  I just substituted some fresh ground pepper. I used this for the seasoning called for in Spicy Beef Fajitas, also from this site.  Having now eaten the dish I used this seasoning for, I have no more doubts about it...and only wish I would not have listened to Hubs and made more than the amount of fajitas he insisted was plenty for us.

This was very  easy to make.  Had the seasonings on hand.  Made two separate batches and added a 1/4 cup water to each and then marinates separately beef and chicken while I cut up onions and various peppers.  Husband liked it and he is very picky.

I added a good pinch (1/4 tsp) of ground cinnamon and ground coriander for an authentic Mexican flavor and aroma. If you want an even bolder flavor, toast cumin and coriander seeds in a skillet until the aromas are released and then grind them up in a spice grinder or a mortar and pestle. That toasted spice really kicks this into another level. All in all, the original recipe is also good on it's own.

This is a good recipe, but it is missing one magic ingredient: cinnamon.  Really.  Add a teaspoon of cinnamon to this recipe and it goes from good to great.  Everything else is spot on.

This is really, really good. I followed this recipe to the "T", didn't change one thing. I made Fajitas with it and it was exactly what I was looking for in flavor. The aroma is so wonderful. I am so happy I decided to use this recipe, and you can bet I'll be using it every time I make Fajitas. I give it 10 stars! >^..^

This was fantastic! Easy to make out of things I already had on hand, and so quick! I made it when I realized my store-bought seasoning was "medium" as opposed to "mild" and I knew my kids wouldn't eat it. Tried this (minus the cayenne), and EVERYBODY loved it! I just sprinkled it right into the frying pan on top of the meat and veggies. I think I will make some to have on hand and try on different meats (tonight was chicken). Loved it!

I used the recipe as written with 4 medium-large chicken breasts. I followed the cooking directions that "Arvan" suggested in his/her review, except I used only the amount made by one recipe with 4 chicken breasts, about 3/4 of a bell pepper I had on hand, and a small onion. It was delicious, but next time I would use a full bell pepper and a larger onion. You could probably use 5 medium sized chicken breasts with this amount. Better than a store-bought packet for sure!

This was okay.  Not the best I've had, but definitely not the worst.  The only thing I changed was the garlic.  I had no powder or salt so I used minced garlic instead.  
I don't know if I didn't care for it because of the lack of 'spice' to it because I like spicy.  My family liked it.  But they weren't raving.  I ended up only having one small fajita versus two which never happens.
It's good when I don't have my normal seasoning but next time I'll adjust the spices so I can have a bigger bite to it.

I used this last night and it was orgasmic! I made a large batch to keep for other times. I used 7tbsp of this mix for 4 chicken breasts worth or fajita mix. It may be too pungent for some people at that ratio but i like a nice heavy spiced taste.

Very good!! I will never again buy fajita seasoning at the market!  I had all the needed spices and the cornstarch in my pantry and it took me all of maybe 3 minutes to mix them together.  I made Spicy Beef Fajitas from this site, using this seasoning and the Fajitas were delicious.

It was good, but I upped the cumin to 1 and 1/2 tsp and it was very good.  Also added about 1/4 tsp turmeric to this recipe - was very good - never buying the packets again.

Great fajita seasoning! I sautÃ©ed chopped peppers and onions in a bit of oil until barely crisp then set aside. In the same pan cooked steak or chicken until cooked then drained off fat, added seasoning mixture, 3/4cup water and veggies back to skillet and allowed to simmer 10-20 minutes. Served with tortillas, rice, cheese, salsa and sour cream. Yum!

Next time I will omit the sugar; my husband didn't like this seasoning blend because it was "too sweet."  Other than that, the flavors were fine.  I added the mix and cold water to cooked chicken, onions and peppers and it thickened up and coated nicely.

We thought this tasted great on our chicken fajitas. I sauteed onions and peppers in some olive oil until they started to soften and then added some already grilled chicken strips and sliced tomatoes. I added all the mix with about 2/3 c water and let simmer. I only used 1/8 t of cayenne because I didn't want it to be too hot for the kiddos. However, DH would have probably liked me to use 1/2 t of cayenne. I already made another batch of this to be ready when we want fajitas again! *Update 2/18/17-I make this and keep it on hand all the time. We love it. I have given it as gifts in a pint mason jar. Everyone I've given it to likes it.

Perfect! After reading reviews that "Tender Pork Spare Ribs by Mike's Girl" were too salty, I decided to make my own batch (tripled) of fajita seasoning to use for the ribs. This was perfect since my hubby doesn't care for salt, and I have all the ingredients on hand. Thanks for the recipe, and for saving me a trip to the store, trmeeds!

I used this seasoning with the Spicy Beef Fajitas on this website.  The only change I made was to increase the cumin to 1 1/2 teaspoons.

Hands down best fajita seasoning ever! Made it 3-4times now and we just love the taste much better than store packages. Haven't added the cornstarch and don't miss it. I make a couple of double batches, mix it well and store it.  Just add 3tbs of the spice mix , one red pepper, one onion,chicken breast or steak. We even add shrimp to the chicken or steak. It's really better than even restaurant fajitas.

Just the right mixture of spices. Not mild but not too spicy either. I made the best pork fajitas that I ever tasted.

My husband was recently put on a low sodium diet and I've been searching for recipes to make my own seasonings for his favorite dishes. Saw this one and made it per the recipe, except I cut the salt to 1/4 tsp. I added 2 TBSP oil and 2 TBSP lime juice to the spice mixture and used it to marinade approx. 1.25 lbs of chicken breast overnight. I cooked it with sliced onion and red and green peppers the next day. Served it on Ortega flour tortillas (40% less sodium than most other tortilla brands.) Topped the fajitas with a dallop of sour cream and hubby was very impressed with the flavor! Thanks for sharing this, it will be a favorite in our lower sodium dinner recipes!

Used this in a pinch tonight since I ran out my go-to packet of fajita seasoning. So glad I did. Made recipe exactly as instructed except I was out of Garlic powder so used 2 cloves fresh crushed garlic instead. After cooking chicken strips in oil over medium high heat for 5 minutes, added the seasoning, garlic, 1/4 cup water, juice of 1/2 fresh squeezed lime, sliced onions and bell pepper. Kids said they liked the taste of these fajitas much better than what we usually have. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

I made this seasoning w/o the cayenne pepper, I don't like things too spicy.  I wasn't sure how to use it, so this what I did.  While cooking the veggies,onions & mushrooms, garlic, I also added some red & yellow peppers I had cooked and were in the freezer.  I added about 2-1/2 Tablespoon of this to the veggies after they had cooked awhile.  I removed the veggies, from the pan,  I added some water- 1/2 cup to the pan then added the rest of the seasoning, while the sauce thickened a bit, I ended up adding a more water (1/2 c), (making sure I smashed all the lumps) I added my thin sliced steak, (my was sirloin) I cooked it until the steak was done,  It was delicious and the everyone in the house keep asking what I was making because it smelled so good.

This is the BOMB! Be sure to add the cornstarch and a teaspoon of cinnamon. The smell of this cooking is out of this world. Hubby âmoppedâ up the extra sauce with an extra tortilla! This blows any package mix out of the water!

I work in a kitchen at a recovery center and (steak/chicken) fajitas is one of our residents favorite dishes.  We had been purchasing and using a premade seasoning mix, which we ran out of.  I am extremely thankful that we did because I would never have found this recipe.  It is so versatile, it tastes good with either kind of meat.  I have noticed that for steak it tastes a little spicier than when it is used for the chicken, but it is definitely great on both!  The only change that  I made was to use granulated onion and granulated garlic instead of the powders.  Great recipe!!

This seasoning mix produced the best-tasting fajitas I have ever made.  The whole family raved about them. There were no leftovers.  I  substituted turbinado sugar for white sugar, simply because I prefer the taste, and I increased the amount of cumin to 1 tsp.  I prepped my steak  and veggies earlier in the day (I used skirt steak) and put the meat, vegetables,  and seasoning into a large ziploc bag. I added a couple of tablespoons of olive oil -to the ziploc and  let them marinate for several hours.  By dinner time, it was a very quick and easy production. The seasoning not only flavored the steak and veggies wonderfully, but it produced a  very delicious sauce. This is a real keeper.

I made this last night for some venison fajitas.  The hubs said "this is good livin!"   I just gradually added water to the desired consistency, and the venison and vegetables already had some olive oil on them from my initial sauteing.   sauteed vegetables separate from the venison and then mixed together, adding tis seasoning and water last.  Perfect seasoning!!

This is fantastic. I find this as written to be the perfect amount of seasoning for two really large breasts cut into strips. I added 1/4 cup water to the seasoning mixing well and tossed it in with the chicken when just done then cooked til most water was evaporated but a nice coating remained. My new go to fajita seasoning!

I mixed the dry ingredients with 1/4 c. olive oil, 1/4 c. lemon juice, 2 T. soy sauce, and 1 T. vinegar like "oregonviolin" suggested, then marinated chicken breast strips in it before sauteeing the onion and peppers with the chicken and all the seasoning/marinade mixture. It was just an explosion of flavor! Will make it again!!!

quite good.  I don't care for super spicy and this had just the right amount of heat.  1 TBS of cornstarch has 7 carbs.  I used this on 4 chicken breasts--adding 1.75 carbs to a piece of meat is not going make it a 'high carb' meal--the cornstarch made a nice 'sauce' for brown rice!

I couldn't have been more pleased at how this seasoning turned out!  I had recently been in New Mexico and one of my best meals was in a small  2 table restaurant/take out where I had an awesome chicken fajita.  I have been wanting to recreate it since!  This recipe was perfect.  I did leave out the cornstarch and sugar and honestly it was still amazing.  I had chicken last night and tonight ...I cooked up some chicken thighs in a bit of oil with the seasoning on both sides...cooked till done and added to some 'Spanish quinoa' I made throwing a few things together AND with a  sprinkle of the same seasoning in the quinoa.  I just had the same exact dinner tonight and may have enough left overs for lunch tomorrow lol.   Needless to say I couldn't be happier!

I added cinnamon and coriander as a few suggested. I also cut back on the corn starch and omitted the sugar. Iâve used it on steak, chicken and ground beef. I use 1 8 ounce can tomato sauce per pound of meat and 1/2 can water.

This tastes as good as another recipe I used, but uses about 1/3 of the ingredients and doesn't require marinating.  My new go-to fajita seasoning!

I love this recipe!  I doubled the recipe, halved the sugar and added 1 tsp black and white pepper and my chef of a husband said that he never wants me to make it any other way!  It makes about 2 lbs cubed chicken.  Try it!

This seasoning is great. I did omit the cayenne pepper, Iâm a wimp when it comes to spicy food. It really has a restaurant taste to it. I added all the seasoning to a pound of chicken, a whole red and green pepper and a sweet vidaliaâs onion. I also added 1/4 cup of water. It was just enough.  Like others suggested, you can mix it up ahead of time so you have it ready to use. Iâll be making this a lot!

I've been making this for years, I make a big batch for multiple uses each time. Although I do use a couple bouillon cubes for a large batch. Makes all fajitas so good, even tilapia.

I drop the sugar, use smoked paprika, and cook the meat and veggies with chili oil.

Reviewed earlier omitting corn starch, heat, and sugar.  Forgot to mention to try adding a dash or oregano.   On a busy night we bought a pre roasted chicken from the grocery store.  I cut up the chicken into small pieces and tossed lightly in seasoning for quesadillas.   We have a nostalgic quesadilla maker.  Just coated the flour tortillas with a bit of butter, tossed on a 4 cheese Mexican blend, a few chopped onions, diced tomatoes, and the chicken.  Done super fast and tastes awesome.  Husband requests them for dinner.

This is a great seasoning blend. I love that I have all of these ingredients on hand so I can whip this up any time I need it. The only thing I did different was add oregano. There's a reason this recipe is so popular!

I made this into a liquid marinade.  I added 1/4 oil, 2 T Soy,  Squeeze lemon and 1 t vinegar.
I did not use the sugar or cornstartch because I am on a no carb, no sugar diet. This was amazing!!

I LOVE THIS SEASONING! So happy we have leftovers for the next dinner. I cooked the chicken in the liquids from "the most positive review" then added in the seasoning.. ITS SO GOOD! Used sweet mini bell peppers, white onion, and chicken with salt and pepper :) Also, instead of lemon juice I sprinkled fresh lime juice in at the end :)

I use this often just as the recipe indicates. It's wonderful and so much healthier than the store bought packets that contain unhealthy artifical perservatives.

I made this recipe exactly as written and decided that the cornstarch could be reduced to two teaspoons of flour or eliminated altogether and other spices, such as dried basil and oregano would add the best flavor. Overall, it's a good base recipe to play with.

At the last minute my husband decided he wanted fajitas for dinner last night.  I found this recipe and decided to give it a try.  However, it was just okay for us. It didn't really have the fajita seasoning taste I was looking for.  Easy to make but still on the hunt for a go to fajita seasoning recipe.

I marinade 2 small steaks cut into strips in one batch of this seasoning, then I sautÃ© some onions, jalapeÃ±o and bell peppers in olive oil and garlic until tender, add salsa, seasoned steak and a touch of water, simmer adding in a little flour to thicken.  I cook until steak is about medium done and serve! Yummy!

I made this today for my chicken quesidillas and it was great!! It's not spicy so if that's what your looking for you could add some red pepper flakes or bump up some of the seasoning. I had Green and Red bell peppers, onions and cooked some baby kale with different cheeses.. Amazing!

Easy and flavourful (even with old spices!) I marinated a bit before with seasoning and olive oil, then cooked it adding more seasoning. Put it on veggies and chicken. Whole family loved it.

Just used it on some leftover steak and vegetables for a quick fajita dinner. I didn't have any cumin on hand, but did add an extra dash of chili powder. I thought the flavor was good. My husband and I liked them and it made enough for our servings, but not a lot extra if you're having larger portions. Will do again.

I make something very similar, almost the same really, but I add powdered chicken broth.
I use this as a base for seasoning almost everything I make:
Add a little herbage, basil, oregano, etc and you can adapt it to chicken fish, almost anything. 
It's very similar to Emeril's "essence" and that gives you a clue as to where he got it.

This had a very nice flavor, but I did omit the sugar (no one missed it). I also used arrowroot powder instead of cornstarch, but I don't think it made a difference. I used this recipe for quesadillas and they turned out really good! Next time I do fajitas, I'll give this a go!

Great flavor, not too spicy. Saute'd peppers and onions, added 3/4 c water and the seasioning as written. Cooked for 5 minutes covered. Then added thinly sliced left over bbq'd steak and cooked until steak was warmed. Served in warmed flour tortillas and rice on the side.

Fantastic flavor!  Even my husband asked what seasoning I used.  I mixed all ingredients together then poured on chicken and skirt steak in zip top bags (separately of course).  I allowed to marinate all day. This is my new go to fajita seasoning.

Very good! Sooo much better than the nasty packets we have purchased at the grocery store (and cheaper too!) Easy to modify to taste. I made as directed except for the cayenne pepper, and I immediately added it to my recipe box!!

I didn't have time to marinade this, so I coated the steak with oil, rubbed on garlic (and no garlic salt added), and then coated the seasoning on, then seared it in the pan.  Delicious!

This is soooo good; much better than the two prepared fajita mixes I tried. I doubled the ingredients (except for the salt), and used 2 pounds of BLSL chicken, 2 red, yellow, and orange peppers (6 total, which I sliced), and 1 large thinly-sliced yellow onion.

eMy family loves this seasoning with steak fajitas. I do omit the cayenne because we have family members that are not heat tolerant. This can be fixed for those who like the spice by adding some hot salsa at serving time.

As written this needs work. Its a good start although you need to use more than the 2tbs recommended to get any decent flavor. I started with 3, added a 4th. I'd probably suggest 6.

This is a great fajita seasoning recipe.  I ran out of store seasoning while making fajitas, so I supplemented with this recipe.  This will be the only seasoning I use from now on.  You can adjust the cayenne for heat preference.

Turned out great!  Just a bit to spicy for me to give it a 5 but next time I'll cut down on the cayenne (and also maybe the chilli powder) for a perfect fajita seasoning.  Thanks for sharing!

I'm not a huge fan of fajitas in general, let alone the seasoning. However, I couldn't find a bag of fajita seasoning and was on a time crunch, so my husband found this recipe for me, and I am still amazed at how well everyone in my family loved it. I did need to make some substitutes (potato flakes instead of cornstarch, crushed red peppers instead of cayenne, and minced garlic instead of garlic powder), but other than that, this was a lifesaver for my family's meal! I would totally reuse this recipe if I ever needed to make fajita seasoning from scratch again!

Like this better than buying spice packets! Triple the recipe to fit in a used spice container.  You may need to tap the bottle to settle it to fit everything.

This is my go to for fajitas. I use as written (sometimes omitting the Cayenne for the little ones). Cook 1 lbs chicken breast cut into thin strips, 1 bell pepper sliced thin, and half an onion sliced thin with a little olive oil. Add in seasoning and a little water. Once finished add a squeeze of half a lime. It is absolutely delicious!

I made this as I was cooking fajitas and realized I didnt have any packaged seasoning. Thankfully I had all these spices on hand bc I will never go back to packaged fajita seasoning again! Absolutely loved it, made as is.

I've used this numerous times for my quesadillas and it tastes absolutely delicious. I don't normally adhere to the amounts listed. If you wanna kick it up a notch I suggest adding oregano. You can even go further by using some smoked paprika (for a smokey flavor) or spraying a few dashes of chipotle hot sauce (for a smokey flavor with some acidity) on the chicken as it cooks. Bon appetit!

This spice blend made delicious fajitas! I made the quick stovetop version rather than marinating and grilling. I followed the recipe exactly, however also included one half teaspoon of oregano as I understand it is a traditional ingredient. After sauteing quarter inch sliced peppers, onions, and (separately) meat in a bit of vegetable oil, I stirred the seasoning together with everything in the pan to let the spices bloom in the residual hot oil. I then added the zest and juice of a lime along with some water and simmered until finished. I served it with warm homemade tortillas and offered toppings of queso fresco, sour cream, salsa, and cilantro, as well as lime wedges for both the fajitas and, of course, margaritas. Yum! The next time I make this I might try cutting back some of the corn starch and sugar, and bump up the oregano plus a little cinnamon as suggested in other reviews.

Very nice. Lots of taste to the chicken with just a little heat. Will be using this instead of packaged fajita seasoning.

I made this recipe just as listed and added it to a mixture of 2 small onions and a green bell pepper.  After simmering the mixtture for about 10 minutes, I tasted it and thought that it needed a little tanginess for my taste, so I added about 2 tsp of lemon juice.  It perked right up and was delicious!  Thank you for posting the recipe.  I will definitely make this again.

No need to buy the over priced packages of seasoning mix. This one hits the mark. I used a 1/2 cup of liquid., which included the juices that came from the veggies and chicken.

I make this all the time. In our house, we boost the garlic powder and cayenne a bit. This quantity is perfect for roughly 16 Oz of protein, to taste.

Great fajita seasoning recipe.  Double it for 5 lbs of meat.  Use 2/3 of it with about 3 Tbsp olive oil as a marinade before grilling.  Reserve 1/3 to season meat after slicing.

I followed the recipe except or doubling the garlic powder and did not add onion powder. I used smoked paprika and chipotle pepper. I doubled the recipe and used 2 T for the marinade for spicy beef fajita from Allrecipes. It was really good. The remaining seasoning fit nicely in an empty spice jar I had saved.

This is my go-to recipe for fajita seasoning. I always make extra just to have on hand in my spice cupboard. I really like that I can ramp up the spice level when I know itâs just for me and make it less spicy for when Iâm cooking for my boyfriend or nephew, both of whom are learning to like spicy food.  I also appreciate that this is made from spices I already have in my cupboard and that thereâs no weird unpronounceable âingredientsâ in it. Thanks for the recipe!

I used this recipe last night and it was almost perfect. After taking another person's suggestion and adding cinnamon to the mix, it had exactly that something that was missing! I added 1/2 teaspoon to the recipe and doing that to be just right. BTW - it is a powerful smelling spice, but surprisingly, I did not detect the cinnamon flavor in the fajitas, it just adds that warm and earthier flavor to the sauce that I associate with fajitas. I made a jar full of this recipe today (with the added cinnamon). Much better than the packaged mixes from the store.

Everyone loved it. Used Costco hand pulled rotisserie chicken (2 lbs). Halved the cornstarch and sugar. Definitely saving to use again. Maybe half the salt next time. Weâll see.

Very, very, good, and so easy! Much less salty than the premixed packages you buy at the store. I usually add about 3/4 cup water to the chicken and veggies with the seasoning and let it simmer until warmed through.

We put our peppers and onions in a foil pouch with a drizzle of oil and a single batch of this seasoning mix and threw it on the grill with some pork loin chops, chicken breasts and steak. Served it up with warm tortillas, shredded lettuce and sriracha aioli. Yum! This is now our go to fajita seasoning. Thank you!

I make 4x the amount and save it for future uses. Add water to the meat and simmer it with seasoning like you would tacos.

This is a great recipe. I make up a big batch and store it in a spice container. I add 50% more salt and double the onion and garlic powder. 
Tastes great with pork and chicken. I will continue to use this recipe for many years!

Easy and delicious. I did half the cayenne pepper (on purpose) and double the cumin (on accident). Delicious! But I'll add the normal amount of cumin next time, and I'm sure that will be perfect.

This is super easy to throw together. I wasnât planning to make fajitas I was going thru my fridge to see what I had and I actually had bell peppers. So I looked up this recipe and had all the spices in my cupboard. Super stoked!! Tried it and love it!!! My family really loved it to. All 4 of my kids under the age 9, approved!! Used four bell pepper one pound of steak and one onion. Used the entire spice mix  for this recipe.

Love this and you need to add the seasoning at each step ex. On onions, on veggies, on meat etc. yes I use a lot and itâs amazing. Add olive oil lemon juice soya vinegar as was suggested.

Perfect for the chicken quesadillas I made today.
I love making my own seasoning mixes because there are no chemicals & I can control the sodium. 
You could add more chili powder or cayenne pepper for more heat but it was perfect for me.

Wow, best dry marinade ever!  Just mix the ingredients and shake in with sliced steak, chicken or vegetables and sautee with oil or butter.  Tastes like my local Mexican restaurant!

Mexican hubby said "estan ricos!" (better than delicious).  At first I omitted the cornstarch, but added it back in at the end. I used 1/2 the recipe for 3 good sized chicken tenders, sliced thinly, sauteed with slivered onion and bell pepper. This equaled 6 well filled tacos with lettuce and tomato. The heat level is mild. I think adding lime juice at the end (in skillet) would put my chicken fajitas over the top. I'll try that next time. Nonetheless, this spice recipe is great WITHOUT any tweaking.

This is a really goo recipe.  I sauteed my onions, and bell peppers, then I grilled my chicken.  I added the fajita mixture to the chicken with a little water and sauteed for 5 minutes.  I then added the peppers and onions and served on warm tortillas.
Oh so good!!!

I made this for the first time on Valentine's day and used it for chicken fajitas. I've made it two more times since then. It is simply the very best fajita seasoning. Restaurant quality. Tastes exactly like Chili's fajitas. I sprinkled two teaspoons over the sliced red and green peppers and onions while they sauteed. I put the rest on approximately two pounds of boneless, skinless chicken breasts and (perfect amount) grilled them on an indoor grill pan. When the chicken was done I sliced it and put it in the cast iron skillet with the peppers and onions. I added about two cups of chicken stock to deglaze the pan, then simmered until sauce was reduced. The best!

Loved it. Made it exactly as written using Ancho Chili pepper powder where the recipe said to use 'chili powder'. Used it all on 1.7lb skirt steak wondering if it might be too much. But it came out perfect. I sautÃ©ed a couple bell peppers and an onion on the side and we had it with some black beans, Spanish rice, sour cream and homemade Guac. Yum!

Yummy! I left out the onion powder and garlic powder but it was still good, but might have been better if it was a little more spicy (it would have been if I had included chili powder). Will use this again :)

Tasted just like fajita seasoning in the pack. I'm on a low sodium diet so I cut the salt in half. I might cut the sugar down a little next time. It was wittle sweet, but in a good way. I might add a little sÃ¡zon hot next t time, but pretty perfect just like it was!

I made this exactly as specified, and it was just ok.

It's possible that I didn't add the right amount to the chicken, since there are no specifications on how much to add.

I wound up adding a touch of cajun seasoning to it to see if it would save the dish and it worked! So, if you've used this recipe and it's not working out for you, you may want to consider adding Cajun seasoning.

While this was good, it didn't say "fajita" to me; more like a very mild chili flavor ... Upping one star since K, 19, said she liked it.

This is a very good recipe for fajita seasoning. When I made it, I adjusted the salt to 1/2 teaspoon because of my reduced sodium diet.

Delicious!  I sprinkled on 3 chicken breasts and veggies.  First I sautÃ©ed the veggies then the chicken.  When chicken was almost done I added the veggies back with a splash of water and covered for 2 more minuets of cooking.  Finished with a splash of red wine vinegar.  Next time I may not put this seasoning on the veggies because the bottom of the pan was black with burned corn starch.  Had to wash pan before cooking chicken.  This was my mistake and doesnât reflect on the delicious seasoning.

I made it without the cornstarch (didn't have any) and I didn't even feel like I missed it! Very flavorful, I made a marinade with 1/4 c olive oil and 1/4 cup lemon juice and the entire batch of the seasoning for 4-5 medium sized chicken breasts.

I reduced the salt a bit and only used 2/3âs of the corn starch & sugar. Next time I will only use 1/3 corn starch or perhaps none at all.

I will make this again, with a few changes. I will use half of the corn starch and half the sugar. For personal reasons, I leave out the salt. 

The chicken fajitas had the right amount of hot spice, with an warm spice flavor that lasted. I mixed  4 times the recipe and srored it in a small canning jar. Used half the jar for my 1st time making. Next time , it will be 10 times and be stored in a pint jar, in the freezer.

This was OK, but my fajitas were bland. Perhaps I did not use enough of the spice for the 1 lb. of steak and 1.3 lb. chicken. I did marinade the meat for 9 hours before cooking. I also added 2 tbl. Olive oil, 3 tbl soy sauce. I will double the spice next time and marinade over nite, reduce the soy to 1 tbl. (Too watery in cook pan). Willing to try it again, hopefully will raise rating then!

Easy to make and I had all the ingredients already in my  pantry. However, the recipe didnât give directions on how to mix it with the chicken. I used two tablespoons of the mix and 3/4 cup of water, since thatâs similar to a package mix. That was not enough seasoning for our taste. Will definitely add more seasoning next time.

Great  recipe. My husband ate all his fajitas, and came back for seconds.   It was a little too sweet for me, so next time I will use 3/4 t sugar.

This is by far the BEST fajita seasoning Iâve ever tried! It gave the chicken a deliciously rich flavor. Itâs much better than any of the store-bought seasoning mixes, and Iâve tried them all. I highly recommend giving this recipe a try!

I love this. I usually use about half per recipe, depending upon how much I'm making. I never use cumin though because I always forget to use it. Husband loves it and it just makes my mouth water as I'm cooking.

This is a go to!  I make a large quantity and vacuum seal individual packages.  It is great for a quick dinner.  We slice chicken - cook in a skillet.  Remove, then saute peppers, onions, garlic and mushrooms.  Put chicken back in, add seasons and about 1/4 of the juices from the chicken.

I really liked the flexibility of making my own fajita seasoning. I was able to reduce the amount of salt and up the garlic and onion powder to my liking. I poured it on the raw meat (~2 lbs.) in a ziplock bag and shook until all was covered. It gave great flavor to our fajitas.

Man this was awesome. I eyeballed the amounts using a tablespoon. I don't think I used less than a tablespoon for anything. I also added about a quarter cup each of olive oil and lemon juice like another reviewer said, with a touch of soy sauce and white vinegar. 

I marinated a flank steak for about 45 minutes and grilled to medium. 

It was phenomenal...

I made this as directed.  Added It to the meat to marinate approx 30-45 min.  VERY little flavor & no heat.  My husband doesn't care for spicy things so I thought maybe he'd like it but he even felt there was no flavor.

Excellent! I thought this had great flavor. I cut the cayenne amount in half since I have small children, but it was sufficiently spiced for my husband and I still. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this exactly to the recipe and it was wonderful.  The best thing about making this yourself is the ability to add or subtract ingredients as needed.  Most of my family loves the recipe as is but one of my kids is sensitive to corn so I can just leave out the cornstarch if I make this when she is home.

Family and I didn't like this. It had a very smoky flavor, which we don't really care for, and was too salty for even the extra amount of beef I used.

I used this recipe to make chicken quesadillas for the first time. My husband absolutely loved it and so did I. Will be using this again. This seasoned about 1 pound of chicken for me.

We have used this on both beef and chicken fajitas and it is so flavorful.  It makes the best fajitas.  It blows away any package mix and is easy to throw together.  We have not modified it at all.  The heat is just right for us, medium.

Great taste and with the corn starch, it thickens just like a package mix.  I doubled the recipe with the exception of the salt, sugar, and cayenne.  I mixed my seasoning with approx 1 cup of cold water, then added it to the cooked chicken (the day before, I simmered chicken breast in water w/lemon and used a fork to pull apart). After the chicken was covered, I added the sautÃ©ed onions, peppers, and zucchini.

This quick seasoning had just the right amount of kick. I sprinkled it on some chicken breasts that I had sliced into strips and pan-fried them. They were great! I did omit the sugar since some people in my home react to sugar. And I omitted the corn starch since I didn't really understand why it's in there! LOL! But the other seasonings were in perfect balance. Thank you so much for the recipe!

What a great alternative to prepackaged  seasonings with ingredients you can barely pronounce! I made this recipe as is and hubby and I both loved it. I also like that you can adjust the âheatâ to your preference. This one is going in the recipe box for sure!

I added 2 Tbl of Soy Sauce and 1 Tbl of vinegar to the recipe, and it was better than any pre-packaged seasoning!  Next time I will use fresh lime juice instead of vinegar.

Excellent! I omitted the sugar because you really do not need it and cut the chili powder in half due to the little ones. The Perfect blend! I really liked how the cornstarch helps the seasoning stick to the protein and coat it like a sauce. Definitely making a large batch for my spice cabinet.

I only had to change a few things I had onion flakes and garlic salt. Next time I will try it with fresh garlic and onion powder. But overall a great recipe! I love that it has lots of flavor without all the extra salt. We were using the store bought packets before.  Now I make a big batch and have it ready in a Mason Jar

The scent and flavor of this went over well with everyone who ate the metal (quesadillas).

This recipe came out tasting quite sweet. I had to add a lot more cayene and chili powder to balance it out.

Great seasoning! I didn't have any chili powder or onion powder, so I left it out. Still turned out great!
*Update: I made as directed with all ingredients and it was equally as good! I also made 20 times the amount so I was able put in cute glass jars to share with friends!

Wonderful mix of seasoning & spices.  Due to my wife's sensitive stomach I omitted the cayenne but instead used Smoked Paprika rather than regular Paprika to add just a hint of heat.

Very good seasoning.

While cooking I marinated the meat I used (which was round beef strips) in the seasoning, little bit of water, olive oil, banana pepper sauce, and soy sauce briefly. Then on medium heat I sauteed one Vidalia onion and green pepper together, set aside and browned the meat and mixed back in after. I then added 3/4 cup of water, covered and let the sauce cook down for about 8 minutes.

I dusted 4 chicken thighs (cut into 5-6 pieces each) with seasoning and cooked it. Then I added sweet peppers and sweet onions, cooked for a minute and then added a couple splashes of water and cooked for 5 min. The water makes is nice and saucy. Sauce will thicken after taken off the heat.

Instead of the salt, garlic, and onion I used Paula Deen's Silly Salt (a mixture of the three).  It was delicious!  I will definitely use this recipe again.  My fajitas were delicious!

The only change I made to this recipe was using Smoked Paprika as that's the only Paprika I have & this was a great tasting seasoning. I will use this instead of the packaged one from now on.

My girlfriend loved it but I thought it was ok.  Probably a good middle of the road seasoning that is adaptable.

A great mix , you just have to adjust the spices according to your  taste and tolerance to spices. Perfect for fajitas or as a rub for any meat.

I was great to be able to prepare a quick fajita seasoning using items I regularly keep in my spice cabinet.  It was a tad salty for me, but, otherwise had good flavor.

I'm so happy to find an alternative to buying the packets at the store.  As per some reviews, I omitted the sugar and cornstarch and also added 1/4 tsp cinnamon.  Although I could taste the cinnamon, I wouldn't say the cinnamon added much to the recipe, but since it's good for you I'll continue to add it.

So much better than the store-bought stuff, and I can pronounce all of the ingredients.  I use this in a similar manner as the type that comes in a yellow packet: stir fry some chicken, spinkle a bit of this over the almost-cooked chicken, squeeze a bit of lime juice over it all, add some onion and peppers and then finish cooking.  My boys love it.

This turned out really great - both my husband and my daughter loved the end result!. The recipe was enough to cover a pound of skirt steak and a pound of  flattened chicken breast. I only used 1/8 tsp of cayenne since my daughter isn't a fan of spicy stuff though. Before I rubbed the meat with the spice, I squeeze fresh lime juice (1/2 lime each) over the meat. I then threw the beef in one bag, chicken in the other, each with half a sliced onion and 1 tbsp of canola oil, mixed them up and let them marinate for about an hour before I put them on the grill. Yum!

I cut the salt amount in half.  My child, who does not generally like spicy food, liked the seasoning.  Added olive oil and coated chicken with the mixture before cooking. Will use again.  Thanks.

Best fajita seasoning mix full of flavor and not too salty. I highly recommend adding a pinch or two of cinnamon for  real authentic flavor. Great as is but a little bit of cinnamon makes it just a little but greater!

A bit spicy for me, I will half the cayenne next time. Otherwise it worked well for the Chicken Fiesta Salad from this site. I would omit the cornstarch if I were using it as a marinade.

Great recipe! Made multiple times. I don't add cornstarch, since it adds a funny taste and texture. If you want to thicken your sauce use flour instead. Add that at the end of the cooking process and do not mix it with the seasoning.

This is the best fajita seasoning recipe I've ever tried! My son said it tastes just like Chipotle chicken! Score! I have three men to feed, so I doubled the recipe, and it came out great!

We love this recipe. Thank you so much. I have not purchased any mix  from the grocery store in years. I did reduce the salt to 1/4 tsp. as a way to reduce salt intake for the day.

OMG! This recipe is far better than any of those packets out there & best thing about it is simple ingredients with no preservatives.  Minus the cornstarch (didn't have any) I followed the directions exactly. I used chicken thighs (I've find dark meat to be juicier &  showcase flavorings better) and it was one of the best  Mexican dishes I've made using chicken. I'll be making these fajitas the next time family comes over they were delicious!!

Used this to make chicken fajitas for the very first time.  Had all the ingredients already on hand.  This was terrific.  Just added some evoo and lime juice to the chicken, with a splash of lemon balsamic vinegar.  It was so easy! Glad this makes plenty of seasoning mix, as these wil be a regular menu item.

It was ok your way, but way too spicy. I seem to recall from packaging that it also included some citrus, which I added dried lime skin shavings(don't recall what it's called at this moment). Gave it more fajita flavor to me. I did it again and  doubled the garlic and onion powder and halved the hot flavors. Fajitas are not meant to be spicy. Mexican restaurants only do that to their non-latino customers because they are expecting spicy foods. I go to mom and papi eateries and ask them to make it the way they would serve it to their familia. And it comes spicy mild. Piping hot from the pan.

Loved it!!!!  Thank you very much!  No more processed envelope junk from the supermarket.  I did not have cornstarch or cayenne pepper, and it was still excellent!!!  I used 1/8 tsp of a cajun seasoning blend since I did not have the cayenne pepper.  God bless you for teaching us this recipe.

I substituted the cayenne pepper with 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper and used smoked paprika instead of regular paprika and I absolutely fell in love with it. For all the people out there that thought it was just OK, try it with the smoked paprika instead, it made all the difference!

I made this tonight for my birthday dinner and WOW! I wasn't sure if I had to add water to the meat (I used top sirloin sliced into thin strips), so I simply added it right before I took the pan off the fire. There was a little bit of juice from the meat in the pan and that was enough to thicken the starch  to give the meat a slightly thick coating. The taste is fantastic. I will definitely use this again.

This is a really great recipe. I had all the ingredients in the cupboard. We made Fajita's and my son used it for his vegan fajita's. Very good. Next time, I will use more spice and let the meat sit in the seasoning a little bit longer for a stronger taste.

It's pretty good, though the directions weren't real clear  how to use it. I used it as a rub to the meat and added water/oil to the pan as needed.

This recipe was a life-saver!  And I don't think I'll buy fajita seasoning at the store anymore, this was better.  

I read other folks suggestions before starting.  I did have to sub chili powder since I was out, so I doubled the Cheyenne and added my favorite sauce, El Pato's Jalapeno Sauce at the end for the extra spice.  And since I had a lemon on hand I threw some lemon juice in, too.

Mix all of the dry ingredients, and don't question the corn starch, it is necessary.  I sliced up a chicken breast and let it marinate in some olive oil, about 1/4 cup water, 1 tablespoon of the dry mixture, and a squeeze of fresh lemon.  Cook fajitas as usual mixing the last of the dry mixture with 1/3 cup water, more jalapeno sauce to taste,  and another lemon wedge squeeze.  Possibly the best fajitas I've ever made!

This is my go to seasoning mix for any Mexican type food I make, ie. tacos, fajitas, nachos, etc. My family loves it. I leave out the corn starch, sugar and salt for health reasons.

Not a cumin fan so I omitted it but love the idea of cornstarch because it clings to the meat and veggies better, and not pasty-tasting like flour.  I made a pint canning jar full for the following weeks. Authentic Mexican taste, love it!

I made this recipe as is, but I doubled it. I used lean ground turkey for tacos and it was outstanding! It has a little kick, but if you like spicier try adding ground Chipotle Pepper or more Cayenne. My husband who usually despsises lean ground meats, actually asked me to make a big batch of it again so he can eat it for lunch all week! I will make the seasoning again, but in a larger batch this time! I can't wait to try it with chicken!

The seasoning was very flavorful but the cornstarch really thickened it up so it was not as juicy as I would have liked. Next time I will decrease the amount of cornstarch.

I did not make any changes, and yes I will make it again ,  my husband and I really did like it, I made it in the crockpot before but the chicken came out over cooked, it is so much better on top of the stove.

Great seasoning.  I went to make fajitas and discovered I didn't have any prepared mix.  Found this and made it right away as I had everything on hand.  I added some dried cilantro and cut the cayenne by half for my sensitive tummy.  For a marinade I made one batch of the recipe and added 1/2 cup of oil, 1/3 cup of orange juice, a 1/4 cup of lime juice (I didn't have fresh limes on hand) and threw in some garlic.  I marinated both the veggies and meat and it was delicious.  We scarfed and stuffed ourselves!

I used smoked paprika as I had some. Love having control of the sodium!
I am so happy that I will never need to buy packaged fajita seasoning ever again!
When cooking for one, this makes a difference.

(made it SW friendly)
I left out the cornstarch, used stevia instead of sugar, used garlic salt instead of powder, left out onion powder ( as I didn't have it in) and only had smoked paprika.  My 12yr old and me thought it was lovely.

I didn't really care for this mix.  It did not have the tang (lime?) and it was too spicy for my kids vs. the store packets. It tasted too much like chili powder to me.  Lacked complexity.

Worked great to season chicken, black beans, and rice on our fajita bowl night. Tasty stuff & it's nice to know exactly what's in my seasoning blend. Plus, I keep all of these seasonings on-hand anyhow, so why not make it. Super easy & super tasty!

I adjust the yield to 12 servings, I leave out the corn starch,  and it fills an empty standard size spice container  perfectly. This way I don't have to remake it every time. This is way better than store bought.

I did not make any changes.  It is the absolute best recipe ever.  It does not disappoint.  I make double dosages so I always have it on hand for left over steak, chicken and/or shrimp for fajitas, tortillas, etc. with onions and peppers , cheeses and sour cream.  Five star rating.  It does not disappoint!  Thank you for sharing.

Fantastic recipe! Just the right amount and combination of spices. I doubled the recipe - some to use now, more saved in a mason jar for later, added 1/4 tsp ground pepper and a pinch or two more of onion powder. I used Domino Superfine sugar for the sugar, and only half the amount of salt - which I used ground Himalayan sea salt. I sauteed half of a Spanish onion and a green pepper (sliced thin) in some EVOO, then added thinly sliced chicken strips from a roasted chicken that I had de-boned for a soup earler. Once the mixture was warmed, I added 1 1/2 T of this fajita mixture sprinkled over the chicken/veggies, then added 1/3 c of water. Simmered until the mixture thickened (a few minutes), and served with all the fajita fixings. INCREDIBLE! Will never purchase pre-packaged fajita mix again. Thanks so much !

This is a great recipe, though like most of these spice mixes they never say how much meat to put in.  I have found that 2 1/2 x's the recipe per is good for about 2#'s of meat, I've used chicken.  Me and the kids like it spicy so I have also kicked it up with pepper flake.

My family had a lot of fun putting this together, the recipe is very simple and I was surprised to find we had all the spices in the pantry. We're going to make it again for sure but will make it a little less "hot". Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

Perfect blend. I used Stevia in place of sugar. So much healthier than store bought packages that are full of corn syrup and sugars.

I've used this seasoning to make baked French fries.  I cut the potatoes and place them in a storage bag with olive oil.  Coat the potatoes, then add the fajita seasoning and shake until all the potatoes are coated.  Bake on a cookie sheet at 400, flip the fries when they are starting to brown and crisp.  Cook until done, serve with malt vinegar or ketchup.

So good! I've also used it to make seasoned rice by cooking rice with some salsa, bouillon, and the fajita seasoning. Top the cooked rice with shredded pepper jack cheese. Easy and delicious!

I've been using this recipe for quite some time. It's good just as it is. It's great that you can make adjustments that will facilitate dietary or family needs/wants. I always make a double batch just so I have some available whenever the need arises. Thanks for sharing this recipe. #cookingwithwingman

Absolutely phenomenal! I tripled the recipe and added it to a spice container so I'd have extra. I used 1/4 C. vegetable oil and 3 Tbsp Lemon juice, then I added one sliced onion and garlic. I slowly cooked it until carmelized. Then I did the same oil and lemon ratio and added chicken tenderloin and sprinkled tons of seasoning on them and let them sit while I cut mushrooms and garlic and sauteed them with some fajita seasoning. Then I fixed up two jalapeÃ±os and added them to they onion mixture to sautÃ© (pretty spicy!) Next I stuffed two huge wax peppers with queso blanco, cheddar cheese and sliced jalapeÃ±o.  I skewered them towards the bottom so they could stand up in the grill and then I grilled the chicken and the peppers on medium-high for 7-8 minutes. I served with hot tortillas, sliced limes, sour cream, cheddar cheese and queso blanco,  cilantro, and fresh avocado, with the sauteed mushrooms and onion/jalapeÃ±o mixture. It was out of this world amazing. Better than a restaurant. Definately make this one!!!

Works great with leftovers too. Had 1 lb. rare cooked London broil and  cut it into strips , sprinkled with mix and thinned out with a few tbsp of vegetable oil, took a only a few minutes to cook. I also sautÃ©ed cut up onion and yellow pepper with more of the mix to go with it. Not too spicy per my husband the chili head, but the kids liked it.

I made this to use in a Mexican themed turkey burger.  I cut the salt in half and left out the cornstarch since it was used to season lean ground turkey (93/7), light Mexican cheese and some cilantro.  I used about 3/4ths of the recipe in 1 lb of ground turkey mixture.  It was a big hit - lots of flavor.   We really enjoyed the flavors and thought it nicely seasoned the turkey meat.  If I had used a stronger tasting meat (like beef or chicken), I would have used the full amount for 1 lb.  We will definitely have again with an increase in the cayenne pepper.

Very simple to make, had great flavor.   I used the entire  recipe with some leftover smoked chicken,  2 green peppers, 1 large sweet onion,  some grape tomatoes, about a 1 1/2 cups water and 1/4 cup soy sauce and a little lemon balm and cooked til it was thickened - I sauteed the peppers and onions in butter first then added the rest of the stuff.  Served over rice.  I didn't care for the tomatoes but DH did.

I made it using less salt, as I'm trying to lower sodium, that's why I'm making my own seasonings. It was delicious! Just the right amount of spicieness. Also used it to make chili ??

Did not change a thing and added 3/4 cup water with sliced chicken, peppers and onions (cooked the veggies first, removed and then cooked the chicken then added the veggies back with the seasoning and water and cooked down for about 10 mins). It was perfect! Loved it and is now my go to seasoning for fajitas.

Made this Paleo friendly by leaving out the cornstarch and sugar and used a bit of water to mix it in with chicken to marinate!  Yummy!!!! This will be our go to seasoning for beef and chicken tacos/fajitas!

My family loved it which means it's a win!! I didn't include the cornstarch because my daughter is allergic to corn, and it is my understanding you don't need it unless you are storing it...and even then it just prevents it from clumping together.  We will definitely be using this recipe again and again.

Made it with a couple of changes.  I used ground chipotle pepper instead of the cayenne cause I like the smoky taste with heat. I also added Â½ teaspoon ground coriander for a citrusy note.  I used it mixed with Â¼ cup lime juice and Â¼ cup olive oil and Â½ cup water as a marinade.  Added marinade to pan when cooking the meat.  Flavor was great but next time I would cut cornstarch by half cause it left too much "gravy" in pan that made the fajita meat too wet and drippy.

better than store bought! !  I leave out the cayenne  because even 1/8 tsp was spicy and masked the taste. Too hot for  my husband.  I  like to add sour  cream in the tortilla and it makes a super creamy  yummy sauce with the fajita spices. Thanks for posting.

I made this according to the recipe.  Next time, I will omit the corn starch.  I only used half as much as called for in the recipe, and it resulted in a pasty finish.  It also tended to "dilute" the spices.  I had to add additional seasonings.  This could be personal taste.  Overall, I will use this recipe as a base, and tweek it to my (and my family and friends) personal taste.

I've made it  several times. Using 2 Tbls lime juice and 1 Tbls olive oil . Omitted the sugar.  rubbed on 2 lbs of chicken, let set for 15 minutes.  Grilled them on high medium for total of 7-10 minutes.  Very good chicken fajitas. I've founsd it easier to use a wet rub for sticking to the meat.

We make fajitas alot and this recipe was fabulous. I'm not sure if I  measured the cayenne right because it had a little more heat than I expected. Not burn your mouth off, just warmth. I will definitely use it again this weekend on chicken to see about the heat.

I made it as it was written. I usually do that and then make changes from there. We loved it! I used bell pepper and onion then added the spice and water. The cornstarch made it thicken up. I then added already cooked grilled chicken strips from Costco so it was an easy work night dinner.

Left out corn starch, unless you want to store this or make it thicker there is no need.  No sugar either- healthier.  I made it the first time as directed than made changes to make it healthier.

No need to purchase pre packaged Fajita mix again.  This made enough to cover three good size chicken breasts.  Added chicken stock, fresh squeezed lime juice and cilantro to the fajitas and they were delicious!  Thanks for sharing...

I've been using this recipe for two years now and will never buy packaged again! The cornstarch adds a nice browning to your veggies and meat. I usually do 1lb of meat,  two, peppers and one or two onions cooked in tablespoon of oil, meat first, water drained off so vegetables don't get soggy then add seasoning at the end. So yummy can't thank you enough for this recipe!

I mixed this exactly as written, placed it in a container with a pound of tri tip beef with half olive oil and water (just enough to make a nice consistency).  I sautÃ©d it two hours later. The only thing I noticed, other than being very good, was the sauce was a touch thick. I may put in less corn starch next time.  My family all loved it with my homemade tortillas.

This was just what I was looking for. All the fajita packet recipes at the store contain gluten. I minimised the heat due to my toddler eating it . Also, I followed Oregon violin's recommendation with the oil, juice, soy and vinegar and it took the seasoning to a whole other level. Thank you for the great recipe!

Great recipe! Can adjust easily to suit your tastes (we love cumin) and your health ( decreased the salt) I have used it as a marinade for chicken and shrimp. Yummy!!

This was a nice spice blend. I kept the herbs the same but adding a few splashes of lime juice when I finished the chicken and peppers in the skillet. I will definitely make this again very soon. Thanks for adding.

Great seasoning! I only did 1 teaspoon of chili powder instead of 2 because I am sensitive to spicy food and it came out awesome! I don't think I will add cornstarch to it next time. I think it stopped it from properly adhering to the chicken .It kind of gooped up with the moisture from the chicken and made more of a sauce.

Made as described. Our go to seasoning now. Make with steak and chicken. Absolutely wonderful. Wasn't sure about the corn starch but I love how it makes the seasoning cling to the meat and veggies.

Excellent Fajita Spice

Add it to your fry-pan or wok just before you complete the Fajitas the sugar and cornstarch become quite sticky quickly and you do not want to loose a great deal of the seasoning to the pan.

This is a perfect fajita spice recipe.  The only change I made was to leave out the corn starch because I didn't want the thickener.

I was looking for an alternative to packaged seasoning. This was really delicious. My family really enjoyed it. I will be using smoked paprika next time, as I like the hint of smoky flavor in the background of my fajitas.

Made it as written and loved it!  I love that I can adjust how spicy I make it by adding more or less cayenne.   Will use this from now on instead of a packet.

This was not only easy but it tasted great! The only thing I did differently was sautÃ©ing my veggies separately. I like crisper veggies and they went perfectly on top of the fajitas. Even my picky 7 year old ate two!

I made this recipe as written. I only used 2 (large) chicken breasts and it was a tiny bit salty...could probably have used 3 breasts. I mixed the spices with the sliced raw chicken breasts in a bowl and cooked them in hot olive oil. It was delicious and I am a little upset that I have used store-bought fajita packets for years! NEVER again!

I made it as is.  My family loved it! I found it not to over power the flavor of the meat and veggies. I put 2 TBS of powder to 1 lb of burger.  Looking forward to making it with chicken next time!  Loved the fact it wasn't salty!   Great balance! Made a triple batch for the spice rack.  Thanks for sharing!!!!

Amazing. I always liked fajitas, but now I love them. I make 12 servings at once and keep it stored in a glass jar in my spice cabinet. When I'm ready for fajitas I use 3 T of the spice mix and follow oregonviolet's  directions of adding  1/4 c. olive oil, 1/4 c. lemon juice, 2 T soy sauce, 1 T vinegar (I use plain rice vinegar), and then I add 1/4 c. water. Marinate for as long as I can wait (usually about  1 hour).  Thank you for the great recipe!

Yum! My roommate and I like a little spice, so I omit the cornstarch and sugar. When I make Mexican Rice-A-Roni, I like to chuck the preservative-packed flavor pouch that comes with it and use this instead!

I made this & was not impressed. There's nothing wrong but there wasn't anything especially right either.   It's very bland & seriously lacking flavor. I used another reviewer's suggestion & marinated sliced chicken breasts in this mixture along with lemon juice & a bit of oil. I added a bit more of the mix while cooking the chicken, peppers & onion. I can honestly say I won't use this recipe again.

I didn't add the cornstarch. Rubbed some of the mix on chicken breasts and marinated for a couple of hours before cooking. Then added more once cooked. Not too spicy, even kids ate it. Plenty of mix left for another use or two. Will definitely make again.

Loved this! I didn't have chili powder so I doubled the cayenne...wow! I also eliminated the corn starch, only because I used left over steak and cooked up some onions and red peppers in olive oil and a tinch of butter...so there wasn't much to thicken up with corn starch. I didn't want to scorch it, and it was fabulous. Thanks so much for sharing!

I didn't have all of the ingredients on hand so I mixed the cornstarch with chili powder, onion powder, cayenne pepper and I added a kick with some freshly ground chili peppers.  It was fantastic!

I really enjoyed this & thought it was a good substitute for packaged fajita seasoning.  I like to know what's in the food I serve my family.  My fiance, however, did not like this and said that the fajitas were very bland.  I even cut up 2 limes and garnished with cilantro, so needless to say I didn't think they were as flavorless as my future hubs. This may have been a fluke so in the future when I make this again.  I will be increasing the seasoning at least 50%. Thanks for submitting trmeeds.

This was my first time making fajitas, and it won't be my last! They were delicious - and I'm sure it's because of this seasoning. I followed the recipe to a "T", using the entire batch to season 3 boneless skinless chicken breasts that I had cut into strips, as well as a bunch of sliced onions and multi-colored peppers. Added a bit of olive oil and let it sit in the fridge for a few hours, then just cooked at all together on medium-high heat in a skillet for about 15 minutes, until the chicken was cooked and the vegetables were tender. Smelled amazing while it was cooking. Thank you trmeeds, for sharing your recipe. Saving this one to my recipe box.

Loved this. I cooked with a pound of boneless skinless chicken breasts and I cup of water. I cut the chicken into 1" cubes then I cooked it until it was white on the outside then I added the cup of water and seasoning for about 15-30 minutes and served with Mexican red rice and refried beans and it came out amazing.

Definitely needs to be lime flavor incorporated. The lime flavor is what MAKES the fajita in my opinion, and it's a very prominent flavor in any premade packet ive ever tried.

Love this combination. My family doesn't like spicy so I leave the cayenne and chili powder out. Still an amazing mixture!

This is a great recipe!  The only thing I would tweak the next time is to cut the salt in half.

My family really enjoyed this recipe.  Easy to make with a well stocked spice rack.  I omitted the cayenne pepper and use a medium to hot salsa as a topping instead, for those family members that don't appreciate the heat.

My go-to seasoning recipe, though I left out the cornstarch (didn't have any) and it still worked fine.

Love this, making it corn free with arrowroot instead!!! I don't like medium, just mild so I just skip the cayenne pepper, like others have done.

left out the corn starch, don't think it needs it.  Flavor was really good!  Think a little more of the garlic, onion, and paprika flavor wouldn't hurt in the long run though.

This recipe is awesome! I wasn't sure how much water to use with this. I ended up using 1 pound of ground beef and 1/2 cup of water with the entire fajita mixture. It turned out perfectly, my family gobbled it up! I don't recommend any changes, this recipe is perfect as is.

Has a very nice flavor. We enjoyed it enough that after making a single batch for immediate use I went out and bought a nice spice shaker so that I could make a large batch and keep it on hand.

Oh, yes! Happy tastebuds tonight! 

Made this almost exactly as directed; the only change I made was to quadruple the cayenne, because I know my household. SautÃ©ed onions, then peppers, then chicken  in a little oil, not changing the oil between. Added the seasoning (entire batch) and a bit of water and key lime juice  to my 1.5# of cut up,  cleaned chicken breasts when the chicken was almost cooked through. Stirred, covered, simmered 7 minutes (thank you, Jennifer from 11/11/13), uncovered, and simmered long enough to drive almost all the water off. Served with pretty dishes holding onions, peppers, avocado, &  fresh cilantro; other things would go nicely, too. I used two small plates and a wet paper towel to improvise a tortilla steamer in the microwave... And absolutely delighted in eating these!  Rave reviews all around, and saved this recipe!

The best thing that ever happened to fajitas at my house was that I did not have a package of seasoning, so I tried this recipe.  Delicious!  Flavors were perfect as written, but next time I will start out with half as much cayenne for my taste.

I tried this tonight and it was delicious - albeit a bit too spicy (for my kids).  I even made this with 1/8t cayenne and it was plenty spicy.  I had to add quite a bit of sour cream to my kids portions to make it edible for them.  For us adults it was great!  I used about 2 1/2t less than the whole recipe amount for 3 peppers, 1 onion, and 2.25 lb bottom round roast cut into strips.  (so it makes a lot)  This is a keeper recipe and will be my go to now (w a little less spice for our kids next time).

This is a great recipe for delicious fajitas!  I made it just as listed and marinated 6 chicken breasts for 4 hrs in this dry mix + 1/4 cup of olive oil, 2 T of lime juice and 1 T of white vinegar.  If you prefer really spicy, add more cayenne, otherwise this is a medium spicy marinade. Grilled them and served them with pico, guacamole and sour cream.  My guests raved about it!

I didn't have the packet mix on hand. But I had all of the ingredients on hand! I will never go back to the packet PERIOD. This is a BASIC mix. You can add whatever amount you want to all the above ingredients and make it your own! Thanks A BUNCH

I made this last night and it was fantastic. Perfect for my palate as it's not very spicy but has a great flavor. My husband liked it but said he would of liked more heat as he likes things unbearably spicy. Haha. But definitely a winner and will be doing this again!!!

Use this all the time for our fajita seasoning.  Make plenty in advance and store for use later.  Nice and easy and even better you control what is in it, unlike the "packets" you get at the store.

Great flavor! Nice that it's all ingredients we normally have on hand. Worked well with venison. Mixed in some lime juice to make it more of a paste to spread on the meat to marinate. Thanks!

Fantastic seasoning! I just use it as my fajita seasoning now with whatever meat & veggie mix I crave.  Especially great on chicken.  Thank-you :)

I don't buy the seasoning packets anymore because this recipe is perfect! My husband even thinks my fajitas taste better than the ones at our local Mexican restaurant, which is a huge compliment because they make excellent food. Although the recipe doesn't say how to use this, I use it as a rub rather than mixing it up into a marinade and it works perfectly.

This seasoning mix is great. I left out the cornstarch. It's not necessary. So simple: SautÃ© the chicken and sprinkle the seasoning on about halfway through cooking time. Simmer approximately 10 more minutes so the flavors will blend.  I serve with black beans and brown rice, mixed salad greens, avocado and salsa.

We like this quite a bit, but after making a couple of times, we remove the sugar completely and add a little more garlic and we love it.

I omitted the cornstarch and used half the sugar. After cooking the steak (cooked veggies first and set aside)in some vegetable oil, there was enough liquid so I did not need to add any water.  Added veggies back to the pan with steak and mixed with all of the seasoning -- then just covered to keep warm - it was perfect!

Just made this to spice up the chicken and the whole family really liked it. I used 1/2 tsp cayenne (double) and then about 1/2 of this total recipe on 2.5lbs chicken and it wasn't too spicy for the kids. Tasty!

Made this a few days ago because my mom didn't have anymore packets of fajita seasoning. We all loved it so much we are having it again tonight! We omitted the cayenne pepper because we don't have any and used onion salt instead of garlic powder.

This was great - I made as is except didn't have onion powder so just upped the garlic powder a tiny bit... will never ever buy packaged fajita mix again, my husband loved this :)  Cooked one pepper, 1/4 red onion, two chicken breasts, and a bunch of sliced mushrooms and added 3/4c water and let thicken, turned out delish!

I really like this seasoning. It's a great alternative to packaged fajita seasonings. I cut the salt to 1/2 teaspoon and omit the cornstarch completely and it tastes wonderful.

I made this with OregonViolin's adjustments, and it was delish.  I also added crushed garlic while the chicken was cooking, and I had to substitute lime juice for lemon because I didn't have it.  I'll make this again.

Tried this with 1/4 c olive oil and 1/4 c lemon juice. Tasted too much like chili powder. It needs less chili powder and more cayenne.

I used this with leftover steak sliced very thinly, cooked with one small onion and a red pepper. It was the most amazing fajita I can remember eating. And not too spicy for my kids to still enjoy.

Perfect just as it is.  I've added Cilantro, lime juice, & pepper to it too.

For cleaner version, I skipped the cornstarch or replaced it with rice flour 1/2 tsp, cut the oil & used water with longer marinade time, and used powdered stevia 1/2 tsp.

This was an excellent seasoning.  Based on someone's recommendations, we added 1/4 C olive oil, 1/4 c lemon juice and 2T soy sauce.  Will definitely make this again.

The first time I made this, I followed the recipe exactly and it was alright. This time I made it without the cornstarch and cooked it on the grill. Even the hubs made a nice compliment about it this time. Will be making this again in the future for sure!

Great flavour. Made half the seasonings and added olive oil and formed a paste which i spread on boneless chicken thighs. Will add more cayenne next time to give it more of a kick.  Will try on beef, pork and shrimp

So good!! Excellent! I made steak with onions and peppers. After it was all done, I put some butter in the pan and scrambled an egg - very delish! I could not find my cayenne and tried to do it with cajun seasoning and white pepper but it was just missing something. I found my cayenne and made it right! :)

Delicious!  I'm trying to cut back on processed foods and artificial flavorings, so I wanted to make my own fajita seasonings instead of buying the packet.  This was exactly what I was hoping for.

Made it as is and thought it was great! Added fresh lime juice during cooking which really polished it off ?? no more store bought packets in this house!

Great.   Added bit of soy sauce and vinegar (I used apple cider bc I had it on hand).  I didn't use sugar.  Awesome start to dinner!

I omitted the cayenne. It smelled awesome anyway! It tasted great...my husband and I love this! Better than a mix you buy at the store, definitely. Smells like something you would order at a (good) restaurant.

Followed the dry instructions to the letter, including using a freshly opened Costco Kirkland's chili powder. I then followed oregon violins review and added a little canola oil (maybe 2 tbsp), fresh lime juice (same), plus about 1 tbsp soy and a splash of vinegar and let some thinly sliced flank steak marinade for almost 2 days.

If you've ever licked the spoon after emptying out the contents of a can of chili bean you will know exactly what it taste like. Next time I'm going back to using nothing but a couple of tbsp of Tajin Classico seasoning plus a few splashes of Valentina salsa picante & fresh squeezed lime at the very end of the cooking process.
