Tasty cookies, however I recommend baking them for several minutes less than the recipe recommends (checking every minute starting at 10 minutes), as the bottoms of my first batch burnt.

Way too much salt.  I wouldn’t add any salt.  Other than that, I think they’d be great.

Tasty! I omitted the salt based on previous reviews and baked for exactly 10 mins. I also used swerve for sweetener.

Soo yummy with a glass of almond milk on the side... I used less than the recommended serving of salt, (only a couple shakes)since people claimed it was too salty. They turned out great!

I would add more sweetener and less liquid.  Also, I would like to know what the nutritional information is.  Thank you.

Way to much baking soda. I did not put any salt and it was still not good. They would not hold together either. Not a good recipe for me.

Definitely bake these for less time than specified. I did around 12 minutes and they were perfect. I used swerve sweetener, an extra 2 tablespoons of coconut flower, doubled the cream & milk,  4x baking powder and no baking soda. I also added a 1/4 tsp of almond extract, but I will Probably add less of it next time I bake them as it overpowers the coconut quickly. No issues with the salt for me. The consistency was good. Soft and chewy. I’ll Make again with my modifications.
