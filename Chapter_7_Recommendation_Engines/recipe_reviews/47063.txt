This was really good i thought.  i changed a couple of things just b/c i didn't have all the ingredients on hand.  i used frosted flakes instead of rice crispies and i also only had 1/2 the amount of caramel needed, so i drizzled the other half w/ melted peanut butter.  it was very delicious, although it was definitely super sweet.  i'm glad i used vanilla ice cream instead of praline, cuz then it really woulda been too much.  good for kids and informal desserts...i don't think i'd serve this after a nice dinner.   great recipe!  thanks for sharing it!

Very sweet and yummy.  I also used vanilla ice cream (it really would've been too sweet otherwise).

WONDERFUL!!!!!! My eleven year old and her friend made it with no problems and it was great we added whip cream to the top and sprinkled crispy mixture for garnish. It was great for church fellowship. Everyone is asking for this one.

I was lookiing for a recipe that my Mom used to make when I was little for ice cream bars.  This looked close so I tried it.  While it isn't exactly like what I was looking for it is really good.  I followed the recipe as written but substituted Dreyer's Grand Light in a flavor called Caramel Delight.  It's an easy way to cut the fat and calories.  I didn't use any caramel topping.  It didn't need it.  After a few hours in the freezer it cut well into squares.  It was even more nicely set up the following day.  My kids gobbled this up.

Great recipe, but I used Vanilla Ice cream, and it was very rich at that.  My family loves this recipe, and its quick and easy to make.  Make sure to soften your icecream first.

THis was very sweet.  A hit for the whole family.  Best part is how easy it is to make.  Does need to spend a good amount of time in the freezer

Good and I would make it again but I would have to cut back on the butter and the sugar. A little too sweet even for my kids. Thanks for a good start!

After leaving this in the freezer for 2 and a half hours this came out runny. Nothing set up. We tried this for a family dinner. The family knows we like to try new things and all have turned out very well except this one. Maybe you should try to pack it in dry ice to get it to set up because it will not set up in a regular freezer.

This has become our families birthday cake, because it is gluten free.  I use home-made caramel sauce and vanilla ice cream instead.  I cover the top with whip cream to give it a birthday cake look.
