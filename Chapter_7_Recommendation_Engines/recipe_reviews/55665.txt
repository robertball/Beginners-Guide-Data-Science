The meatballs are simple and tasty.  I have to admit to not making the whole sauce, but I threw them into one of my own concoctions (which everyone enjoyed).  However, after sitting in the fridge overnight as the few leftover meatballs did, they picked up much more of the sauce's flavour.  Cooking the meatballs for longer in the sauce would be a good plan.

The meatballs in this recipe were fine, nothing too extrodanary though.  The sauce was too tangy for our tastes though.  Maybe because I used a cheap cooking wine.  I won't make this again.

This was okay, but kind of sticky. The sauce wasn't saucy enough -- maybe I just didn't make enough of it? It was just sort of "stick to the roof of your mouth". Now, aside from this, the TASTE was good, and everyone in my family lked it, but I was glad I hadn't served it to company, b/c the texture wasn't quite right.  hmmm....

I made this tonight for supper and really thought it was great, though I used a few substitutions (mostly on the suggestion of one reviewer).  I did not use the beef broth, used Prego Pasta Sauce (32+ oz plus filled it about 1/4 full of water and shook the rest out), and Red Wine Vinegar instead of Red Wine.  It was actually pretty tasty.  I received nothing but compliments on it and even my daughter (Age 5) thought the meatballs were great!  P.S.  I also browned the meatballs in Olive Oil.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Well I thought this was great I don't know how you would find the sauce sticks to the mouth.  Will for sure make this again.  Thank you.
