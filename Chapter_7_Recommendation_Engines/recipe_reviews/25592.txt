Beautiful, light, moist sponge cake with just a hint of almond flavor.  I thought it might be shy on butter by a tablespoon or so, but it was just fine as is.  Easy to make, nearly foolproof.  I can't imagine how you could goof up on a cake like this. The ingredients are conveniently and readily at hand and it mixes up in just a minute or two. Perfect for strawberry shortcake - individual cakelet pans would be so cool (I was too lazy), but this wasn't compromised at all just baked in an 8x8" pan (for a half recipe, baked about 20-25 minutes).

When making this for 6-8 servings, use a 9 inch cake pan. 9X13 is too large and cooks in 15 minutes. Very nice base cake for fruit.

Quite simple to make using mostly staples from your kitchen cupboard. Very light and fluffy and tastes great with Caramel Frosting I.

This cake was so good, and really easy to make. I used a spring form pan, and then when the cake was done, cut in half and put home made whipped cream with strawberries and blueberries in it. It was perfect, and a really great spring time dessert. I made it according to direction, but instead of using a mixer I used my food processor and it was simply amazing.

I just made this. I cut the recipe in half and baked in 6 mini bundt pans for 20 minutes just to see if they would remove easily from the pan. i have a cakelet pan ordered that I want to use for strawberry shortcake. I have already ate 2. This would make great strawberry shortcake and tastes like a cross between the little store bought short cakes and Twinkies. I didn't have any milk, so I used half and half instead, eliminated the butter and used more half and half to replace the butter. They bounced on the cooling rack when they fell out of the pans. One bounced off of the rack onto the floor to a grateful dog.  My family and dog thank you for this easy to make 5 star recipe.

I followed the recipe and the good advise in other reviews, i.e. beat the eggs for 7-8 minutes.  I made a Christmas Trile with the sponge cake. Light &  fluffy and quick & easy to make.

Beautiful, golden light and fluffy.  Perfect for berries and cream.  Make sure to whip this eggs to get plenty of air to ensure a light and fluffy cake.

Really good. I over cooked mine by a few minutes. Make sure to beat the eggs for about 7-8 minutes to get maximum fluffiness. :)

Perfect recipe! Those complaining it's too 'eggy' it might simply be because you are not beating the egg enough. It has to be well-beaten til thick :)

This is a great and easy recipe. I made two of them in 9x13 pans to feed twenty five people strawberry shortcake. Sprinkled cooled cake with icing sugar for a nice appearance. Some simply took the cake and ate it plain. Lovely and moist. It is now definitely my go-to sponge cake recipe.

I have made this several times, sometimes cutting it down to 3 servings, just for a quick dessert.  It's easy and fast....with basic ingredients.   It's mildly sweet and light;  very good with fresh fruit and a dollop of whipped cream.  So much better to make something real than to buy something full of chemicals and preservatives!

I didn't have any almond extract but it turned out delicious anyway.
