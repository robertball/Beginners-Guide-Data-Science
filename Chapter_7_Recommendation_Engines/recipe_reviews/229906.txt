Delicious My husband loved it his co-workers and friend and also my co-workers loved it. It was my first time making it and I thought it would be weird to mix pineapples and caramel with sweet potatoes but it turned out outstanding I will most definitely make this again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I love trying new recipes!  This was wonderful.  I used whole sweet potatoes, peeled, boiled and mashed them, and added all other ingredients.  This was perfect!  I went right by the recipe but made one adjustment that my husband just loves on his sweet potato casseroles.  I added a pecan topping in with the marshmallows.  My husband tells me all the time that I am a wonderful cook.  Last night, he told me that I normally make a delicious sweet potato casserole, but this one topped it all!!!!!!!!  Thanks for sharing your creation.  It was GREAT!!!!!

SOOO good!  Luckily I had extra potatoes in the cabinet because one can did NOT cut it, so I tripled he recipe and everything in it except the pineapple because I only had two cans.  I figured it couldn't hurt to cut back on the pineapple because there's a LOT of sweet  going on in this recipe and I was right.  It turned out PERFECT.  Don't be scared ... for whatever reason this was not too sweet ... it was JUST PERFECT and it will be my go-to recipe for now on!

I decided to look for another candied yam recipe for Thanksgiving just because I was tired of the same old one that I had been using.  I found this one, and it looked easy to do.  So I followed the recipe exactly, and it came out great!  The only problem is that it was a small amount.  I want to double it next time and just use one can of pineapple, and more of the caramel in it.  This is just my preference of course, and has nothing to do with this great recipe.

I was worried that this recipe might be too sweet, but it was perfect! By far my favorite for candied yams.

I made this for Christmas dinner, and there is one TINY helping left.  I added a teaspoon of nutmeg, used molasses instead of corn syrup (I'm not much of a cook - are they the same?), I made my own caramel syrup (thanks to my roommate, who is a great cook), and it was DELICIOUS!  I'll be making this again - but only for the holidays!  Yummy!

Really, really loved this. I had to make a few alterations bc I did not have caramel on hand. I actually just ended up using  some more light brown sugar than the recipe called for. I accidentally forgot to drain the canned yams, so I compensated by draining as much as I could, and adding a bit of flour Even with the mistakes made, and the lack of caramel, this recipe was SCRUMPTIOUS!! I will be making this every year now, but followng the recipe precisely next time.

Not so sure about this one. Maybe the fact that I used fresh yams, cut them into chunks and parboiled rather than mashing them was the deal breaker but there was something missing from the flavor. I did everything else the same except I doubled the the recipe. Just not sure what happened but I'll stick to my original yam casserole. All the posters loved this so maybe it was just us.

Made this last year and it was the first dish to run out.  It was so good we doubled the recipe this year to serve just five people.  We had only a tiny bit left over and my husband's uncle finished it off for lunch today!
