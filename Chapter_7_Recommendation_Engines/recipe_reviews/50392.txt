"Capers and Halibut"--what an ordinary name for such an extraordinary dish! The pan roasted halibut becomes nicely golden brown and caramelized, while the sauce, although it includes no lemon juice, is inspired by that used in the  classic Veal or Chicken Piccata. Simple to prepare, remarkably pretty presentation, with delicious results. I served this with rice, but a side of pasta with garlic and olive oil would also be a perfect complement.

Fantastic!!  This was simple and delicious.  I also made the "cheesy acorn squash" recipe from this site to go along with it and a nice white wine.  My husband was in heaven!  One thing... go easy on the caper juice-very salty.

Prior to making this recipe, I was not a huge fan of fish.  Now, I am!
Everyone LOVED it!
As a side dish, I made all recipe's "Asparagus Cashew Rice Pilaf".  The dishes complimented each other very nicely. Enjoy!

love this.. thanks Barbara!!! I added extra capers since my hubby loves them, and left out salt all together.  After searing I placed in baking dish cover with foil.  Worked on the sauce then pour on top the seared fish re-covered with foil and baked for about 10min-15min at 450F.  It was moist and so so tasty.

Completely delicious. Took other posters' advice and cut down a bit on the butter, but sauce was still indescribably good (we had it tonight and it's already been requested again!). Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This has way too much butter, and it doesn't need the extra salt. The capers have enough salt in them to carry the dish. Cut the butter in half. For two halibut steaks that is more than adequate. With those changes, easily a 5 star.

fantastic..never cooked with capers before. The halibut was cooked in a teflon pan so no real brown bits, I'll try an iron pan next time. As the halibut was already cooked after the first bit I just mixed it in the sauce to warm it up and it came out great. No add ons or substitutes. If your weary about capers, dont add the full 3 tbsp, add only one tbsp, the caper liquid and cooking of them will add the taste that is required.

It was good, but don't add any salt. The capers make it a bit to salty already.

I had 2 lbs of halibut, so I doubled the amount of wine, added a little more garlic, and used 2/3 cup butter and 3 tsp capers w/liquid. I also sprinkled the halibut with a lemon/dill spice blend and added 2 tsp of lemon juice to the sauce. Turned out amazing!

I was able to get away with a little less butter, but other than that, I made this recipe as written.  It is a healthy, delicious dish, good enough to serve to serve as a special occasion meal.

This is so delicious and easy! It has become my go to quick recipe. I double the sauce ingredients and serve the sauce over pasta (which I slightly undercook and add the sauce and contine to cook in the pan). With salad or broccoli, it is a perfect elegant meal.

Loved this recipe!  We, too, reduced the butter to 2 tablespoons.  Though we had never tried it with 1/4 cup, we loved our results.  This recipe is a keeper.

This recipe was on the dinner menu last night.  When my husband returned from the store he announced they didn't have Halibut, so he bought Cod instead.  Since the filets were large, he cut them in half for easy turning in the pan.  We added some lemon zest to the sauce and the final result was was outstanding.  The Cod didn't brown, but it was moist and flaky....perfectly sauteed.  Will try this recipe again with the Halibut, but the Cod is a terrific substitute.  Many thanks for sharing the recipe and for making our Friday night dinner a success.

Norma  Jackson Wi  This is the best.  We love it, if only we could get more fresh Halilbut.  It is such a treat.   Our friends brought us some from Alaska.   Makes me want to go to Alaska just to catch a big one.   We  also love capers.

Divine!  I made this pretty much exactly as listed, plated it over garlicky spinach (saute a few chopped garlic cloves in olive oil, fill the pan with spinach, saute...   I added a seeded roma tomato shortly after the spinach and a but of sea salt and ground pepper) and spooned the sauce over.  My husband, who before he met me at his fish in stick form, swooned.  Then he scraped all sauce from the pan. And ate the extra piece of fish.

My husband thinks capers should go in most dishes, so when I saw this, I thought I'd try it.  I thought it was just okay, as did my husband.  (LOL, although he loved the capers) I just thought it was a bit bland that's all.  If I do this again, maybe I'll add some red pepper flakes to kick it up a notch.

Very good but watch cooking time with halibut, doesn't take long!  Capers also very salty, love them but do add a lot of salt to flavor.

This is an excellent recipe for an excellent fish.   8 ounce halibut fillets are not very desirable.  They're too thin.   Halibut should be cut thick (at least an inch) to cook right.   Therefore, I used this recipe on a single 1.3 pound halibut steak that I cut in 2 for my wife and I.     When I do this the next time I will make a little more sauce.  There was not quite enough sauce for my big halibut steak - - but it was still GREAT.

This recipe is FANTASTIC!  I made this for dinner the other night and everyone loved it, my one-year-old son even liked it.  I have been craving it ever since (I think I might make it again tonight.)  It was very easy to make (under 20 minutes), didn’t mess up the kitchen & didn’t leave a fish odor in the house.  Next time I am going to try using a little less oil by brushing the oil on the fish instead of putting it directly in the pan & I am going to increase the amount of white wine and decrease the butter in the sauce.  I don’t think these changes with effect the taste at all, but it will decrease the fat. 2 thumbs up for this recipe!!

I live in Alaska, and we have a freezer full of halibut at any given time. We started using this recipe a couple of years ago, and haven't even tried anything else--because, why? This one is so good we've never had the desire to try anything else!

Outstanding! My husband can't stop talking about how delicious this recipe is--and he's a tough one to please. He doesn't even like capers but this recipe made them the star. This is definitely a "fine restaurant quality" meal! Didn't change a thing!

Made his after reading ingredients and reviews.  This is a delicious recipe and takes ingredients that I normally have on hand.  We loved it and I would make it again.  We could not have had a better dinner anywhere.  Definitely a keeper.

Beautifully simple, this sauce is the perfect compliment to halibut! I had a bottle of Pinot Grigio on hand, so used that and it was wonderful. I added shallots (because I love onions) , and, just before serving, Italian parsley and scallions. I probably used extra butter and garlic too, but you only live once. ;) Capers and halibut are a great pair. I will definitely be making this again.

Not being a fish lover I was skeptical about a recipe that didn't include lemon.  It was actually quite good and went beautifully with steamed brown rice, as the sauce has so much flavor.  Go easy on the capers - they are delicious but do add a lot of salty flavor to the recipe.

Loved it. I think it's best with a very dry white wine and drain the capers. Restaurant quality.

The sauce was pretty easy to make and it tasted awesome!  I felt a little bad eating all that butter but it just made it taste so good!  This was the first time I had ever cooked with wine and the whole experience was just great.

Tried lots of recipes to try to get some “flavor” from halibut. This is it!  I knew to adjust salt with capers and agree there is too much butter but yummy!  I need to take the initial step of browning further to get some “texture” on the fish but this was very easy and very tasty for what can be a bland fish.

Totally awesome! Moist, tender, flakey...delicious flavors! My husband said it was the best halibut he ever tasted. Plus, this is one of the easiest entrees you could make!

Tasty dish but be aware "medium high heat" is a relative term. On my stove that proved far too hot. I patted the fish dry before cooking but the olive oil still spattered everywhere and the fish cooked too rapidly. Will make it again but at a bit lower temp. This is basically a "piccata" recipe for fish, minus the lemon. If you like chicken or veal piccata, you'll love this.

This recipe was quick and easy to make, and tasted great.  I reduced the butter by 1/2, and will probably reduce it even more next time.  This recipe would work great with any kind of mild flavored fish.  Thanks for the recipe, Barbara!

Excellent recipe.  I added a little more white wine than called for. Just before plating I added the juice of a whole lemon for about 30 seconds .  Halibut, capers and lemon..a winning combination.

We enjoyed this one very much and would make it again.  I scaled it to two servings and Hubs said he would have preferred a little more sauce – once you reduce the wine, and then add the butter and capers, there’s not much there.  My fish (tilapia) was pretty much done after browning, so I returned it to the pan very briefly – just long enough to reheat it.  This goes together quickly, so be sure to have all your ingredients ready to go before you start.

i used halibut chunks and half the butter. my husband liked this even though he isn't a caper fan. i also left out the pepper (by mistake) and salt (on purpose). still good though. i could see lemon pepper working here.

Much better than 99% of restaurants we have enjoyed coast to coast. Tried it because it was simple, quick and we had all the ingredients on hand. We added sliced almonds to the rue which added a finishing touch to an amazing recipe!

This was fantastic! TIP: use STEAKS not fillets! I used fillets as that was what I had, and they fell apart. I ended up mixing it all together, and served it over the brazilian white recipe from this site and it was still AMAZING! Awesome flavor!

this was the first time I cooked fish in a pan and it came out great! My husband and I can't get enough of it! I didn't add any salt though, the capers are salty enough! I also had rice and butternut squash with it and it all tasted wonderful! Will definitly use this recipe again!

I loved this!  It left me wanting more.  I used margarine instead of butter.  I felt it was a bit much; will cut back next time.  I didn't use juice from the capers, simply because I barely have any in the jar anyway.  I didn't have halibut, so I used tilapia.  

Simply excellent!

Used Salmon instead, it was awesome.  I usually don't care for salmon but I couldn't eat it quick enough.  Also added a little cream to thicken the sauce a tiny bit.

This turned out very good.  We really liked it.  I love capers so I had to try this recipe.  The sauce was great, I think I may try the sauce with chicken next time for soemthing different.  You can't go wrong with this recipe.  Simple and easy to prepare.

First, let me say I rarely give 5 stars as that is reserved for the "Praise God for this food" food :).  That said, this was very good, not great (probably due to a semi-quality halibut).  Pretty easy to make and will definately make again.

Very yummy!  My husband and I have not been successful making good fish at home, and this was terrific!  I tried the recipe as it was written, and there wasn't a morsel left!  I would agree with other reviewers that it was a bit too greasy, so I think I would increase the wine and cut the butter in half next time.  At any rate, it was fabulous and so quick and easy.  Definately a weeknight meal.

Fa-bu-lous.  I did salt and pepper the steaks lightly before cooking.  I also added a couple of fresh sprigs of dill for the final presentation and it added great flavor!

This recipe was enjoyed by two halibut lovers.  The favor is fabulous, while preparation is a breeze!  This will be one of our regular recipes when we prepare halifut.

Very good. The only change I made was to leave out the salt since the capers are plenty salty and flavorful. I used very dry sherry for the white wine. I served with steamed broccoli and mashed potatoes.

This was really good.  We make chicken picatta so I am familiar with the flavors, but on halibut it was amazing.  I did cut the butter in half, but otherwise followed the recipe.  Definitely will use this one again.

Simple AND unforgettably delicious.  How can you beat that?  I had only about half amount of capers, so added a tiny bit of fresh tarragon from the garden and topped with fresh Italian parsley.  DEFINITELY into the rotation for all that amazing wild Alaskan halibut in the freezer.  THANKS

This simple, lovely recipe really highlights the delicate flavor of halibut.  No need to dredge in flour, or add bread crumbs or parmesan, this was just a beautiful fish in lovely buttery sauce.  Not only was this recipe good, it was quick and easy, too!  Thanks for sharing!

I made this and I couldn't get enough it was sooo delicious!! I do agree with others about the capers being salty enough. And about using less butter. But the combination of these ingredients where perfect. My five year old and three year old tore it up :)

I didn't have capers and had run out of margarine. To the wine, I added a little tomato basil dressing which added a different flavor, but was still great! Thanks for the recipe!

I'm new to cooking fish so I had to look up a recipe. OH MY GOODNESS!! This is so delicious I can't seem to move on to anything else. I even love the way my house smells when it's cooking. I don't actually follow the recipe to the letter any more, I just use it as a basic guide. I pretty much use more of everything except caper juice and butter. The sauce is to die for.

OMG but this is **GOOD** I've used it with sole, haddock, cod & halibut ... all were divine and unquestionably this the best white fish recipe I've had in my life. I've tweaked it a little bit - upping the garlic to 2 tsp, adding 1-1/2 Tbsp chopped fresh dill to the sauce, using only 'dry' capers and subsidizing dry sherry for the listed white wine. Matter of personal taste more than anything (I'm more partial to stronger flavors than many folks); the original recipe is a solid 5 star on its own.

I was scared...$35 worth of fish that might all be wasted if I screwed up!!  This recipe was easy and delicious!  
I did make a few tweaks:
- I had 1.32 lbs. of fish, cut into two pieces
- had about half the amount of capers requested.  I dumped the bottle (liquid included) into a little bowl with 2 tblsp of water to slightly dilute
- patted down the fish with paper towels
- seasoned fish with salt/pepper
- Cooked skin-side down for four minutes/flipped, 2 1/2 more minutes...then removed, plated, covered with foil
- used dry vermouth in place of wine
- added 1 (or so) tblsp fresh lemon juice after wine reduced
- used 3 tblsp butter
- cooked the fish in sauce (spooning sauce over fish a few times) for a minute or so
Really great!!  I would not have put this together myself, so thanks Barbara for this recipe!!

So ridiculously quick, easy and soo tasty!... like plate licking, must-get-every-last-drop tasty.  Have made this recipe numerous times as is with Halibut or Haddock but this pan sauce also really shines when you swap out the white for red wine and use it for red meat like a nice steak or lamb. So.Freaking.Good!

Holy cow! I was so nervous because I bought some beautiful halibut steaks that were rather expensive. Based on my track record, it was likely that I'd overcook the fish and make a gross sauce. However, I followed this recipe precisely and it was divine. I'm talking nice-restaurant-status. The only thing I changed was minor: I doubled everything because I like bigger portions, but I only put 75% of the butter. The butter wasn't missed. 
Thank you, Barbara, for the delicious recipe. I'm even going to use it for the in-laws!

Wonderful recipe. I've now made it twice. Last night I made it for one, and cutting down the recipe that much wouldn't have left me with enough sauce due to pan evaporation, so I didn't completely cut the liquid in half. I don't find anything bland about this recipe, however, I do make sure to season the fish before panfrying with a little salt and generous amount of fresh cracked pepper. Also, I think this yummy sauce would be good on many kinds of white fish and perhaps even chicken breasts. When I told a friend what I'd made for my supper he went, "That sounds like a meal for lovers." Was that a hint? lol I had it with sauteed zucchini and slices of heirloom tomato ... and a nice inexpensive  sauv blanc. You just can't go wrong with this recipe, I don't think.

It will be 5 stars when I make it next time minus the brine from the capers.  The saltiness was a bit overwhelming with all the brine so I'll add the capers only.  Rather than the liquid from the jar, add a bit more wine to make the sauce.  Otherwise, it was a great dish.

Was not a fan of this recipe.  We did not know if we were supposed to drain the oil after removing the fish and there was way too much butter and couldn't really taste the capers.  Left me feeling heavy and didn't really taste the fish.

This was amazing! My husband and I made this together and had a great time, mostly because it was so quick and easy!  We used tilapia because we had that on hand, cut out some of the butter and added a little bit of lemon juice but otherwise stuck to the recipe.  And what an amazing dinner it turned out to be!

This was pretty good, but I wish I had read other reviews about the butter before preparing this dish.  It was way too much, but I will make this again but with at least half the butter called for.

Absolutely delicious! I tend to broil a lot of seafood, and this was such a delicious change. The fish itself turned out so flaky and moist, and the sauce was heavenly. The butter makes it a total calorie splurge, but well worth !

This was really good, the flavors really come together. I wasn't too sure at first when I put the sauce together since it smelled pretty strong but it was excellent in the end. Definitely a keeper.

Tasty dish. I think I could have reduced the amount of butter, like someone said, but it was fine. I also used a teflon pan so there wasn't much browning, but again, it was fine. Alaskan halibut is quite pricey! I'll try a different white fish next time, but this was yummy and I'd make it again!

I really liked this, made it with tilapia. My hubby said it was to buttery. But, he ate late so it had sat in the pan for extra time.

Very good! I used flounder fillets, cooked them a minute on each side, and removed them from the pan while I made the sauce.  Added about a tablespoon of lemon juice to the sauce, then put the fillets back in to heat up.  My husband, who is not a big fan of fish, actually had seconds, which he never does with fish.

This was pretty good for a quick sauce. It was very salty even for me and I love salt. I would definitely not add as the capers provide more than enough. I was unable to find Halibut so I substituted Cod. Next time I would like to try this using Halibut and I would cut down a little on the butter.

My family loved this recipe!  Even my 3yr old!  We aren't really fish eaters (my husband is the only one in the house that really likes fish) but are trying to eat more because it is so healthy.  We did use 1/2 the butter and it was great.

This recipe was quick, easy and rather tasty.  I merged a few similar recipes -I lightly dredged the filets in egg wash & flour, and also added 2 tbsp fresh parsley to the sauce at the end.  I kept them warm in the oven while I prepared the sauce.  I don't think we had the oil hot enough though because the fish seemed to absorb some of.

I'm not a big fan of halibut,but I am now.  Sometimes I use this recipe for shrimp or scallops over angel hair pasta, never thought of halibut. My husband thought     it was good and he doesn't like fish. I will be making this again and again. Thanks!!

LOVED IT!  I personally didn't add the extra salt and I shouldn't eat pepper so I didn't use that either. I like capers but only used about 1/2 of the recipe.  I was mostly interested in the butter/garlic/wine sauce and it was fabulous.  I can't wait to make it again.

Yum!  I used white snapper and it turned out amazing!  My husband is not fond of capers but loved this!  You really have to reduce the wine and let the sauce cook for a while to bring out the sweetness.  Will definitely make again!

I'm not a huge fish fan, but this recipe was fantastic.  I couldn't get fresh halibut at the fish market this time of year but used flounder and it came out great.  Can't wait to try the receipe with halibut too.  Thanks!

Growing up in a family that goes fishing on every vacation, we've had tons of fish.  When I made this, my brother looked at me like I was Emeril and said it was the best fish he had ever had. I also crumbled some feta on top and sprinkled a bit of fresh lemon juice.

A simple, elegant and divine dish, good for anything from a quick casual meal to very impressive presentation for company. I added some fresh diced tomato from the garden, but the recipe is perfect as originally presented. A definate keeper! Thanks for a great recipe Barbara!

This recipe was very easy to make as well as tasty.  I omitted the butter due to keeping the cholestrol levels down and it was still excellent.  Thank you Barbara!

Don't let those capers scare you. It was a wonderful meal with a delicious taste. Very easy. Try grilling halibut steak while drizzling the sauce.

I needed a fast and easy recipe for halibut, and this one turned out perfect! I doubled the recipe and it worked out great for our family of four. I am going to give this recipe to all my friends, and keep a copy of it in my collection.

I love this! Flavors are delightful! Because of the capers, no additional salt is really needed. Clearly my favorite halibut recipe!!!

OUTSTANDING!  Absolutely beautiful recipe...elegant, yet simple!  I reduced the butter just a bit, which is my only alteration.  This is truly a "must try" for all who may read this!

We really liked this dish. It was easy and we didn't make any changes. I used pinot grigio for the white wine and we served it with some pasta (tortolle). The kids, 3 & 5, liked it too.

Just like all the other reviews, this turned out fabulous.  I used Mrs Dash instead of salt (capers are very salty as is the caper brine).

I've made this many times now and still change nothing (maybe extra wine). Served with rice, any extra sauce makes a lovely topping.

I made it as presented, but I had to substitute minced garlic for fresh.  This is a exceptionally tasty and easy recipe . My husband and I enjoyed the flavor of the sauce.   It is so good and easy I will make it often.

I found this to be an excellent recipe. It is extremely easy and elegant as well as very tasty. This recipe is also a superb baseline to be tweaked and played with by adding additional spices and components such as lump crabmeat, scallops, shrimp or crawfish tails.

This is so easy and it turned out perfect!  I used a filet that was slightly more than 1" at its thickest section and it could not have been better!  p.s., I'm a horrible cook.

The recipe is extremely easy to make and very tasty. I made the whole dish in about 5 minutes! I modified it by reducing the butter to 1 TSP and I did not add any salt. The result was a very tasty sauce that was not too salty. It tastes a bit tangy because of the vinegar from the capers and the brown bits of the fish mixed with the capers were fabulous!

So easy, and soooooooooo delicious! I didn't change a thing and it came out restaurant-perfect! Served with cashew rice pilaf, which worked very well - but will probably serve with plain white rice and a salad next time. Will definitely be making this again and again and again!

I am always looking for recipes that can dress-up frozen fish portions using ingredients I have on hand, and works for just two portions.  This is a winner. I was pleasantly surprised just how tasty this simple recipe is.  A good addition to our regular rotation.

Delicious!  I loved the flavors and capers.   I will certainly make this again!   I wish I knew how much wine to leave in the pan...maybe a tablespoon?  Anyhow it came out great!  I served it with green beans and Risotto.

This tasted as wonderful as it looked!  I adjusted and used 2T butter and 2 T capers for two 5 oz. halibut steaks.  Absolutely the best (first time to eat halibut) meal!

Great recipe, but too salty. Here is a fix that will solve the heavy saltiness and add another level of flavor. 
Do not add any caper juice and rough chop the capers. 
Add about 1-2 tablespoons of chopped kalamata olives.
I made this for some friends and they were in heaven.

I agree that the recipe as is uses too much butter.  I let the wine reduce less than the recipe called for and then used about 1 tsp butter to emulsify a bit.  With that change, I give it five stars.
It was very yummy and much lower in fat.

Easy and very tasty. I served it with a green salad and crusty bread.  A great week night dinner.  Made the recipe exactly as is with the exception that I used white fish.

Used scallops instead. This is a basic recipe for fish. It's good, but in my opinion, not great. Next time I would use less capers, even though we are a fan of capers.

This is by far the best and easiest treatment for any firm white fish I've ever tasted, much less prepared myself at home! I'm from New England and fairly picky about seafood but I wouldn't feel cheated if I was charged handsomely for this dish at a restaurant. The good part is I can make it at home anytime I can get fresh fish at the market!

Fantastic!  My husband is a fisherman and is very perticular about how fish is cooked.  He passed it with a 4 out of 5.  It was so moist and flavorful.

This was soooo yummy and REALLY easy.  Our halibut serving was bit larger than the recipe and I like lots of sauce so I increased the sauce ingredients by 1/3.  I also squeezed the juice from one lemon right before serving.  Everyone loved the dish and they were even using the leftover sauce to dress their rice.

If my husband says five stars, it's a winner! Two changes, I used Tilapia, cause that's what I had, and used coconut oil instead of olive, cause of preference. The wine sauce was wonderful!! Good thing I made lots. Thanks

Very tasty!  I will make this again.  This is a low-carb friendly recipe for those who are in a low-carb diet.  I read some reviews and I did not add any salt since the capers are very salty.  I used chicken broth instead of the white wine, and I added tomatoes at the end.  Very good recipe and so easy to make.

Delicious!  I used rockfish instead of halibut, and added some sliced green onions just before returning the fish to the pan.  Even the kids were requesting seconds!  This will definitely become a frequently used recipe in our house.  :)   Thank you for sharing.

This came out way too salty. I used swai fillets instead of halibut (I think any mild fish fillet will work) and seasoned them first with salt, pepper and garlic powder before putting them in the pan. DO NOT season the butter/wine mixture with salt or add the caper liquid. This put the salty factor way over the top and made it almost inedible. I served over rice so it cut the saltiness. However, I will definitely try to make this again using my less-salty version; I expect it should be wonderful.

Made this using lemon olive oil.  Followed directions exactly other than that.  It was good, but I felt something was missing.  I used a Riesling wine which was all I had.  Next time, would use a Chardonnay or a Pinot Grigio.

I didn't have halibut so I used tilapia. I cooked two cups of noodles and added it to the dish, since the fish fell apart in the pan. One of the best meals I have had in a long time. Thank you!

I thought the capers and the addition of salt was a little too much. But the flavor was good otherwise. Also, they ran out of halibut the day I went to the grocery store, so I used Flounder as suggested and it fell apart a lot, so hoping the next time the halibut holds up together better.

This was a quick easy fix.  I think I'll cut the butter by a couple tablespoons and will increase the wine to 3/4 cup next time so that I have more, less greasy sauce.  Good flavor combination though.  Will use this as a go-to recipe for all kinds of fish.

Followed the suggestions for fewer capers and less caper juice. It was just the perfect amount of flavour for the fish. Thank you!!!

This was fantastic. We used halibut fillets but I can't imagine that affected much. We had just eaten lobster at a fairly high-end restaurant the other night and both instantly commented that we'd rather have been served this. I love capers so the only thing I'd do different is add even more of them.

Great flavor, but the capers were way salty (didn't add liquid). I would probably rinse the capers next time before adding them in.

Made as written with the exception we used cod instead of halibut.  We would have enjoyed it more if we had cut the butter as others suggested.

Absolutely wonderful.  If you love the taste of halibut and don't want to mask it, this is the dish to accentuate with.  I increased the garlic to about 6 cloves and seasoned the halibut before pan-frying with pepper and crushed red pepper.  Will definitely make again.  Heavenly!

We really enjoyed this recipe. It's so easy to  prepare, yet is an elegant presentation. I used orange roughy, cut the capers down to 2 tbsps, and used half the butter (trying to lose the darned holiday weight, lol).  Next time, I'll squeeze some lemon juice into the sauce for some extra tang.  The caper sauce would be great over grilled chicken breast too.  Good stuff!

I wanted to like this more. My husband was more impressed than me. It was a little bland, and the fish had a poached nature. It reminded me a bit of a fish choice from a seafood buffet. Perhaps a squeeze of lemon would have helped. I'll definitely finish the leftovers, but probably won't try it again. In short, it was OK, just not a wow dish for me. Thanks for sharing - it looks like many others have enjoyed the recipe.

The capers coupled with the wine was just too much acidity for us.  Will try again without capers and reduce the wine to about two tablespoons adding some toasted almonds for texture.

I'd give this a 4.5. My husband made it for dinner and it seemed to take hardly no time at all. He said he would add more garlic next time. Used no salt and less butter. I really don't like capers, but I think I do now!

I'm always looking for good fish recipes. I made this right from the recipe. It was great and so easy. My whole family, including teenagers, liked it. The only thing I would do differently is make more of the sauce. Can't wait to make it again.

it didn't seem like it took 25 min to cook... but maybe it's because we were drinking the wine while cooking hahahaha.  it was good.  easy to make.  few ingredients.  simple and cheap, but tasty.  i'm eh about it because i think the sauce taste better with chicken.  but i was in the mood for fish tonight, so it was exactly what i needed.  :)

Very tasty!  Even though I am the only fish-lover in the house, my family loved it.  I didn't have any white wine on-hand, so I used chicken stock.  Since this added additional salt, it was a little salty.  I think I will drain and rinse the capers the next time to reduce the salt as well.

So good and so easy! I really like simple recipes and it doesn't get much easier than this.  My only recommendation is to hold off adding any additional salt.  The capers I used were salting enough to carry the dish!

Every time I make this for guests, the recipe gets rave reviews.  The only change I suggest is to make extra sauce, because people tend to want more.   Also, if you can't find fresh halibut, consider using this sauce with other white fish such as sea bass, flounder, and escolar.  (I don't think it would go well with a meaty, oily fish such as salmon or tuna, though).

Quite good!  I had to substitute haddock for the halibut because of the craptacular local grocery store, but it came out well nonetheless.  The caper-wine combination really comes through.

My husband isn't crazy about fish, and he thought the Halibut was delicious. When the fish was done, I added sour cream to the wine mixture. It gave the sauce extra substance, and it turned out less buttery. To garnish I sprinkled a bit of paprika, the dish looked beautiful. 
Thanks Barbara

This recipe was excellent.  It tasted like a fine Mediterranean dish. Very tasty and extrememly easy to prepare especially for a dinner party. I served quartered lemons and limes alongside the fish.  Terrific!  Thank you.

Made for two. Too salty... Next time I won't use the butter and salt. The capers more than adequately seasoned the halibut and in my case the butter gave the dish a weird taste.

This fabulous!! Used cod instead of halibut. It was amazing. Not a crumb left on any plate. Paired this with steamed broccoli. What a nice light meal. Will make again and again.

As a general rule, my husband thinks *all* fish ought to be fried, HOWEVER, he loves this recipe. "Restaurant quality!" he says.

This is great with halibut but I'll use other white fish too. Last week was striped bass.

And whoever said there's too much butter... nonsense. Go ahead and throw the whole stick in there! Serve the fish with rice and a veggie. The sauce is phenomenal over everything. You might even want some bread to sop it up. (okay... now we're really getting unhealthy, but I'm tellin ya, you'll like it.)

After going to two stores I couldn't find fresh Halibut so I settled for Cod... Tweeked the recipe a bit by adding chicken broth to the sauce as well as fish squeezed lemon. Served it over capellini and it was a HUGE hit!

This recipe was absolutely delicious! This was my first time cooking halibut and we loved this recipe. The ingredient amounts were perfect and easy to follow directions. I did not have any white wine and subbed with unsalted chicken stock and just a pinch of white wine vinegar (if I'm out of wine again, I'd just add a little lemon juice to the stock). The ingredients just meld together so well and reminds me of a piccata. I look forward to making the recipe again with other types of fish if I don't have halibut. Thank you for the recipe!

Firstly, I didn’t have wine so I used chicken broth with a tablespoon of lemon juice. This sauce was wonderful and complimented the salmon I had on hand! The sauce is salty but I took others advice and didn’t use much of the caper juice. FABULOUS!!! I will be using this recipe again and again!

I cooked this tonight, cut back a bit on the butter but otherwise followed recipe and is was absolutely amazing!

Highly recommend it and I will definitely prepare it again.

I will definitely make it again,  I used mountain capers my new favorite.  With the leftovers I made fish cakes and ate them with a salad with a lemon vinaigrette.  Cooking for one always makes leftovers and this was an awesome second meal

I prefer a little more zing, so I cut the amount of wine in half and substituted lemon juice for the other half. 5 stars for my palate after that change! Delicious and pretty easy to make.

This was our dinner last night---very tasty.  I followed the recipe as written using very little salt.   Our rice side dish was made even better by little additions of the butter sauce.  Thanks for a great meal!

Delish. Had a filet not steaks so that is what I used. Made as directed with the exception of adding white pepper and a little dill to one side. Didn’t add any salt. I like salt and it didn’t need any.  After re-adding fish to the sauce cooked for a minute or so, removed from heat and covered with the lid so it could steam. Served with wild rice and it was all done in 15 minutes. Amazing!

This is so delicious yet quick and easy to prepare.  I used one pound of fresh wild caught halibut and made half the sauce which was perfect.  Will definitely make again!

My grocery was out of halibut so I used cod. It tasted great but doesn't not act the same in the pan. It doesn't brown and falls apart.

Delicious recipe.  Be cautious with the salt.  Adding the caper liquid makes for a very salty sauce.

Suggest serving over bed of jasmine rice so to allow the rich buttery wine caper sauce to adsorb into for extra bites of decadence!  Also suggest cutting to 2 tbsp of capers.  I removed about 1/3 after prepared, was a bit caper overload (for me).

I didn't have white wine so I used red, I know that is a bit heavy for white fish but was hoping it would turn out alright. I overcooked the fish because if you brown it...then it's already cooked, no need to put it back on the pan. the flavors were weird!  I was so excited about this recipe, and now I just wasted about $15+ bucks on a nasty experiment. Good luck to you!!!!

I used ahi and double the fish.  It is good to make sure that the wine reduces so that the butter does not seem like too much, also use unsalted butter.

Excellent and very easy. Normally I make first recipe as is, but I didn't have capers. I followed the recipe except used chopped green olives for the capers and added fresh chopped tomatoes.  We used fresh Halibut just caught in Alaska. I would make again, and even use with other white fish v

Oh my!  This is a fabulous fish recipe.  To give you an idea of how good:  my teenage daughter & I were plotting to steal my husband's portion.  We figured we could justify since he really doesn't like fish anyway so he wouldn't mind--right?  The only thing that stopped us was that I didn't feel like maki g another dinner.  My husband did like it (though not as much as us) and said he loved the sauce more than tartar sauce even.  I took another reviewer's suggestion and added dill to the sauce.  I also cooked it in a 375 degree oven for 18 mins then broiled for 2-- perfect!

Such simple quick and delicious dish!! I used Cod bc that is what was affordable in my area at this time. I didn't have white wine so I used chicken stock, still delicious!  I did squeeze a lemon wedge over fish while resting and another in the stock that I reduced in a pan. We served this over wild and brown rice almondine and garlic Kale all recipes inspired by ones found on this site...Scrumptious! Ty for sharing!  OUTSTANDING dish!!

This is easy and simply delicious! My son (who doesn't really like fish) thought is was excellent. Serve the halibut w. some rice, a colorful green salad and a glass of chard.!

Easy and excellent! That about sums it up. Easy recipe to tweak as well, if you wish. I added a squeeze of lemon juice. May add a little more butter next time but we cook with "i cant believe its not butter." Husband and I both loved it! Simple but elegant. Served with Brussel sprouts and a quinoa blend. We will continue to make this...when halibut is on sale. :-)

Excellent recipe!  Easy to make, very few ingredients, and great results.  My husband and I are not usually caper fans, but he raved over this one.  Even my 3 and 5 year old kids liked it.  Highly recommend!

The sauce sounds a lot like one I have made to go over a breaded and pan fried halibut. But I made more of an au poivre sauce. I used green pepper corns (smashed), white pepper/salt, heavy cream, brandy, butter, and capers (some smashed). I put the Halibut over bed of white rice and sauce partially over halibut and rice. Was awesome. I made this dish for a customer that brought me a huge hunk of halibut to cook for him and his wife. They loved it. I might post this  recipe..

Great!  The butter can be cut back to just a tablespoon for the diet conscience and it still turns out great.

This was a way to give halibut a little flavor, but I wasn't overly impressed.  It is okay and looks pretty nice, but there are more flavorful and different ways to use halibut that I would do before repeat this.  It is simple and easy if you are looking for something quick, but if you have the time I would try something else with more flavor or uniqueness.

Great recipe!!!  The only thing I changed was using grapeseed with garlic oil instead of the olive oil. Halibut was good but expensive.  I might try another kind of fish next time.  My hubby really liked it to.

I don't care for halibut, I like fishy fish, but this recipe changed my mind. I cut the butter and capers back by a tbsp, increased the minced garlic to a tbsp and shook a little lemon pepper/salt on the halibut before returning to the pan. I totally forgot to add the caper liquid! Can't wait to make again and share with my husband.

Just like the reviews say, wonderful and easy. I cut the butter amount in half as well. And I would s&p the fish while it is cooking. I also used grape seed oil, per an earlier review. I'm going to try to make it with chicken next time, and maybe add some artichoke hearts!

I love this recipe and my family does too.  I just bought a two pound bottle of capers from Costco so that I will always be ready to make this.  I used halibut the first time, it was wonderful but very expensive, $40 for my family of five.  Another time I used Lake Michigan Salmon. Tonight I am making it with cod, I am sure it will be great.  My only negative comment is, reading the recipe, I do not see how two 8 oz fillets can feed four!  I have 2 1/2 pounds of fish for my family of five and I use the calculator to adjust the other ingredients.

the fish was good i used flounder instead of halibut. the sauce was a little to much butter and there were way to many capers . the next time i make this ( and there will be  a next time ) i will cut those in half and season fish a little more.

This recipe was great!  I used margarine instead of butter.  Next time I would cut down a bit on the margarine.  The capers definitely add a nice spizzaz to the dish.  Thanks for the recipe!

Delish & Quick/Easy to prepare.  I added some grated lemon zest and Italian parsley. A keeper for sure.

I love halibut and capers, but I do not love this recipe!  The flavors did not mix well together and I could not even eat this after a few bites.  I bought a really good fresh piece of fish and an expensive jar of capers and it did not make much of a difference.

Great recipe....I usually don't like fish much.  I overcooked as it said brown, but still tasted GREAT.  Next time I'll watch my cooking time.

Very simple and very tasty!
Used a tablespoon of margerine instead of butter and felt it worked well. Big hit with my boyfriend.
I would definately make this dish again.

This was ok, I doubled because I had more fish and thought there was too much wine flavor for me and then the sauce tasted a little fishy with the tart wine and capers mixed through.  If I make again I'll not add as much wine and maybe tweak some other things, but will most likely try some other posts just to see which we like best.  Thanks

This recipe is quick and simple, and the best part is that it has an amazing taste.  Powerful and enjoyable flavors all around and healthy too if you cut back or use low-fat margirine instead of butter.  Definitely a keeper!

Excellent!  My entire family loves fish and I am always looking for new recipes to try.  This is definately a keeper.  I followed another posters suggestion and added a bit of sour cream to the sauce and it was perfect.  Will be making this again!

I didn't have white wine, so I used balsamic vinaiger instead and it was really really yummy (although probibly not the colour it was meant to be in the original recipe, but still worked really well). My boyfriend said it was his favorite halibut I've ever made.

I thought it was alright - the first few bites seemed very salty to me, which is strange because there's no salt in this recipe. However, the rest was fine, and pretty basic...I'm not a big fish-eater, so maybe I'm a bad judge! I had to substitute trout for halibut, because they don't seem to have it here (Australia)- perhaps that made a big difference.
Easy to prepare, so I'll make it again, when I can get some halibut.

Since there was no direction on how much salt to add, I made my fish way too salty.  It was a terrible waste.  maybe someone out there had better luck with this one.
