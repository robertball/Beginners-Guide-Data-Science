I have made this for years.  I can not eat a steak without it!  The more of a mix of types of mushrooms the wilder the flavor.  I use one package dry brown gravy mix and 1/2 cup water for the demi-glace.  Turns out perfect!

I prepare sauteed mushrooms frequently. I have tried any number of recipes for them, from AR and elsewhere, as well as my own tried and true favorite. But none are finer than this recipe. Rich, deeply complex and full-bodied flavors with a first-class presentation. Using what's available in my area, I prepared this with a blend of oyster, shitake and baby bella mushrooms, veal demi-glace and a red zinfandel (and the shallots, of course).  Since the demi-glace I used was very concentrated and thick, I loosened it up with some chicken broth. Exquisite, a real prize.

Fabulous!  I was looking for a good recipe using mixed dried mushrooms, and this adapted perfectly.  (When rehydrating the mushrooms, I added red wine and a little coarse Kosher salt to the warm water, and saved the resulting liquor for another use.)  Of course, I did tweak the recipe a little to my own taste, as we all do.  I used green onions (didn't have any shallots) and added one small clove of garlic, finely minced.  Also, demi-glace is not a current staple in my kitchen, so I used beef broth and more wine, along with a pinch of nutmeg, and liberal freshly ground mixed pepper.  Since I was working with rehydrated dried mushrooms, I was not concerned that any spices would overcome, as drying intensifies the flavour of wild mushrooms.  The sauce reduced nicely with a longer cooking time, and I did follow a previous suggestion and mixed a VERY small amount of brown gravy mix in some water, and added it at the last minute.  Served with rare/med rare NY Strip steaks, this was a gourmet treat.  I WILL be making this again!!

I served this recipe over the top of pan seared beef medalions and it was incredible.  I will most definitely make this recipe again.  I made a couple of changes to the recipe for my taste and availabity/price of the mushrooms.  I added a couple of extra tablespoons of butter and used 5 ounces of shitake, portabella and grocery store mushrooms each.  I used the recipe for 6 servings and it was the perfect fit.  Thank You

ABSOLUTLEY WONDERFUL!!!!!  I could not find all the mushrooms so I used a 6 oz. pack of potabellas and a 5 oz. pack of shiitake.  I also used a brown grazy packet with 1/2 cup of water for the demi glace.  Very easy and very tasty.

Don't let the list scare you off! This is a fabulous alternative to steak au poivre. We were looking for a Ragout of Wild Mushrooms in Puff Pastry as served by Cole's Chop House in Napa. We took this recipe and used it as a base, then we tweeked it to a Napa standard(i.e. we reduced about 400 ml of BV Coastal Estates Zinfandel to a loose glace). Shallot is so underated, but here they really shine through. For our mushroom selections we used some fresh choices, Oyster and Portobello. Then we added dried mushrooms, Morel and Chanterelle. I think the added reduction really punched up the favors... there's nothing subtile here! Serve this in a puff pastry cup along side a robustly seasoned (Montreal spices) rib eye steak.

This recipe was exactly what I was looking for!  I used the packet of brown gravy and 1/2 cup of water because I didn't have demi-glace.  I also added some crushed rosemary and thyme. My steaks were delicious! I will be making this over and over again.

Sorry, I really wanted to like this a little bit more.  Sometimes I think one of the problems with reading the reviews ahead of time is the hype, some of these reviews hype the recipes up so much that you're looking forward to something soooo delicious, and then when it's not, it's really disappointing.

This sauce was absolutely incredible! I bought all the mushrooms listed with exception of the morels (they are just too expensive!) Also, we didn't have Demi Glace and weren't sure what it was so we wing'd it by using rich beef stock with a packaged brown sauce.  I'm sure REAL Demi Glace would've knocked this recipe off the charts, but the packet gravy/sauce mix still had wonderful results. A definite keeper!

This sauce tasted amazing and it was so so easy to prepare! I did make a few adjustments though to add my own style to it. Sauteed the shallots with garlic and butter since garlic belongs in everything I cook. Used 2 parts crimini to one part each shiitake and oyster mushrooms since that was all I could find at the grocery store that day, and cut them very thin. Took everyones advice and used the packet of gravy mix with 3/4 cup water. Simmered with a bay leaf for some extra flavour. One thing I didn't quite agree with was the cooking times. It definitely took a lot more than 3 minutes to cook the mushrooms, more like 10 and I simmered the red wine for another 10 minutes or so just to remove some of the "winey" taste. All in all this recipe was deliciously yummy over garlic mashed potatoes and roasted chicken. Next time I would add a splash of cream at the end just to add a bit of richness, but that's just me =)

I made this to top some grilled filet mignons and it was AMAZING!!! I only had white mushrooms so I can't wait to try it with the variety. Also used beef stock and a little beef bullion because it's what I had on hand. Used a nice chianti bc did not want an overly powerful wine taste. Amazing!!!

A very useful recipe! However, a comment - morel mushrooms can be extremely difficult to find, either growing wild or at your grocer. They tend to be very expensive! If your on a budget, try using dried & washed morels & reconstituting with cool water for approx. 30 min. drain, reserving the juices, and add to recipe where called for. the reserved liquid can be used to augment the demi-glace.   Chef Mark Christopher

Wow!  This is very good.  I used 8 oz. oyster mushrooms, 3 medium sized portobellos, and a brown gravy mix combined with 1/2 cup of water for the  demi glace.  Excellent!  I will definitely make it again.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I got a great deal on Portabello mushrooms (which we love) so I searched the site for a recipe for sauteing them.  Came across this!  Used scallion (no shallots on hand) and added garlic (of course!) and proceeded to make the sauce exactly as written.  (I DID use the brown gravy mix and water for the beef demi-glaze).  I had already planned on broiling my teriyaki salmon fillet so, although not beef, I used the sauce over medium cooked noodles and added plain steamed Brussel sprouts to finish out the meal.  It was spectacular!  Both my husband and I LOVED it!  And I particularly liked how fast and easy the whole meal was --- from start to finish in less than an hour.  Delicious AND  easy/  Who could ask for anything more??!!!

Would love to give 5, but as I didn't exactly follow the recipe that doesn't seem right.  I didn't have time to prepare a demi glace, so I omitted that completely.  I also used very finely diced onion instead of shallots as I always have lots of fresh onions and never any shallots.
I also used chanterelle and shitake mushrooms only, because that is what I had.  It was terrific!!!  I spooned this over some fresh puff pastry and topped with shaved parmesean cheese and it was heavenly, not to mentioned looked very complex (which is so not true!).  I plan to use this as a dinner party dish soon.  Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent recipe.  I make another mushroom sauce, pretty much like this one, but substitute Marsala wine for the red wine.  Marsala gives the mushroom a slightly sweeter taste.  Ummm, delicious!!  I use this sauce for my Chicken Marsala and also over turkey cutlets.

Fantastic recipe. Just made this to have with some nice rump steaks and it came out great - even with just standard 'run of the mill' mushrooms.

A truly wonderful sauce, this goes excellent with just about anything including pork and chicken.  I served this with a roasted chicken this last Sunday, using chicken demi glace instead of beef.  I could not find morel or chanterelle mushrooms so I used button mushrooms and increased the amounts of the other mushrooms instead.

Followed the recipe as written using a variety of mushrooms I bought at a farmer's market except I didn't have the beef demi glaze, so I found a recipe for that and made it to go in this recipe. It was delicious and my family loved it. I will definitely make again!

Anyone who substitutes the Demi Glacé with gravy and water is NOT making this recipe and should be leaving a review.  It is the Demi Glace, IMHO, that makes this recipe outstanding.  I buy the Veal DG in a jar at Williams-Sonoma.  Only need to use a Tbsp or two as their DG is very concentrated and thick.
