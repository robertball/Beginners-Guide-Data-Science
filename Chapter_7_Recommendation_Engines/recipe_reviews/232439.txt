This recipe makes perfect fudge.  My coworkers were thrilled.   Thank you for posting such a great recipe.  You may want to review some how to cook fudge videos online if you're a beginner like me.  But my second batch was perfect.  Home run delicious!

Very easy recipe for fudge. It does take longer than 5 - 7 minutes to reach the soft ball stage and be sure to stir it hard at the end when you add the peanut butter to make it creamy. I used the full fat evaporated milk and it has a very nice smooth texture. Not too sweet for fudge.

While I was stirring the hell out of this to get it to the right consistency-which took much longer than 5-7-I said to my son. "This better be the best freaking fudge I've ever tasted."
I just had a piece and yeah, it  is definitely right up there with the best.  It's rich and creamy, peanut buttery, sweet, but not sickeningly so. It's more time consuming than many recipes for fudge I've made but it's definitely worth the extra time.

I didn't  use a thermometer, I used a slotted metal spoon and cooked it until the milk and sugar was thick enough to coat the spoon,but also allow for  the mixture  to slowly seep through.  
LIke others have said, you really should have a good size heavy pot because it  will boil over and make a huge mess. I used a 2 qt heavy stainless steel pot and it was almost good enough to have no boil over...almost.
Instead of cooking spray I used wax paper.  I didn't change anything for the ingredients.

Smoothest PB Fudge from scent to swallow.  Use a pot much larger that you will need so this can get its full boil.  Needs fridge to set.  I love this recipe, and will never part with it.   I don't care much for the recipes that call for marshmallow or brown sugar.  This is pure peanut butter delicacy.

I haven't made fudge for many years; I was just looking for something to make this weekend that only used ingredients  I had on hand. I can see why the recipe instructs to use a large heavy bottom pan as the product would boil over if the pan isn't deep enough.   I don't own a candy thermometer, but just used the  soft ball method.  This is a quick and easy recipe.  Delicious!

I think I must of had beginners luck because it was my first time and it turned out. I ended up doing about 13 minutes of a rolIing boil. I don't have a candy thermometer so used the soft ball method. I do think it could use a little more peanut butter.

I have made his several times and is the best PB fudge recipe I have ever made. I have used countless recipes and even made a few of my own, but none of them are as good as this one. The ingredients in this recipe are in perfect proportions. I even made it with only a half a cup of PB (I had already begun cooking it when I realized I was short but continued anyway) and it turned out fine. It just didn't taste that much of PB, but it set up perfectly and my family ate it all. 
If you prefer the creamy fudge just add a jar of marshmallow cream when you stir in the PB and it makes perfect creamy fudge as well. I believe this truly is a no fail recipe. Perfect for the beginning candy maker. I will never ever use a different recipe again.

The closest to my grandmas recipe! Sometimes my mom would use chunky peanut butter which was good, and sometimes she would put cocoa powder to make it chocolate peanut butter fudge.
My grandma would also use the chocolate peanut butter recipe as an icing on brownies. Great! I think that was the beginning of the peanut butter bars....

I must have done something seriously wrong because mine is a goopy mess. Won’t solidify, so I had to freeze it in order to cut it.

Four stars because the fudge didn't seem to set up.  I put it in the freezer and it firmed. I  followed the instructions, making sure I brought it up to the correct temperature by using a candy thermometer. Maybe the spillover had something to do with the problem.   Delicious and creamy texture. Will try to make again.

very tasty, reminded me of my uncle's recipe from long ago, I did boil longer than suggested. Turned out very good, I will make again.
