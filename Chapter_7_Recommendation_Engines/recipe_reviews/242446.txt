This flavor is delicious! I did follow the basic idea but did modify it. I used 2 lbs of ground turkey, 2 eggs, and 1/2 cup of breadcrumbs and 1 tablespoon of garlic powder to get the basic mix. I then seasoned them according to this recipe. For the sauce, you do NOT need 32 oz of both BBQ sauce and jelly! I just used what I had (maybe 16 oz??) of each and that was more than enough! It even allowed for extra after coating the meatballs to then pour extra over the meatballs! They're delicious!

I used precooked frozen meatballs found in the freezer section of the grocery store instead. It was still awesome!

Don't think I'll ever make this unless it's for a party gathering, hence making from scratch is out of the question.  Like the other reviewer, I used frozen meatballs, got mine at Sam's club and like the other reviewer, did not need all that sauce.  Cut that down and since precooked meatballs used, no need for oven cooking - overnight in the crock pot and it was done.   SUPER QUICK AND EASY

Easy and tasty!  Next time, I'll use a little more BBQ sauce in my BBQ:jelly ratio. :)

I pretty much followed the recipe as is and these came out delicious.  I didn't have quite enough ground beef, so used 1/2 pound of ground turkey in its place.  I served them at an office potluck before Christmas and they were a big hit.  Will definitely make them again.

Don't be afraid of the jelly in the recipe! I've made this twice now and my husband & 2-year-old have gobbled it right up. I have also added some hot pepper sauce and served the meatballs on white rice both times which was a good combination.
