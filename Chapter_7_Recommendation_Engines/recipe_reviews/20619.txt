This is one of my basic marinades for all types of meat, poulty & even fish. I also use it to make teriyaki chicken wings which are a favorite at gatherings. I bake 2-3 pounds of wings seasoning them with salt, pepper & a little melted butter. Bake at 350 until done & brown. Then throw them into a crock pot on low with this marinade poured over them. Finger licking good!

I changed the recipe to have a lot more ginger.  One tablespoon of ground ginger.  It smelled really strong but the ginger cooked off.  Made an excellent marinade.  Can't wait to try it again.

Good, not great.  I somewhat halved the recipe for four large chicken breasts, bonein, using these measurements:  1/2c soy, 1/2c water, 2T brown sugar, 1/4t ginger, 1/2t garlic, 2T onion,, 2T sherry.  I marinated them for a few hours then baked in the marinade (what used to be) skin side up.  Covered it in foil for 45 minutes, uncovered last 15.  No one gave compliments, but they didn't complain (as usual) either.  :/  :)  The trick to add water is a good one.  Adding water you get the flavor without the toughness it can cause.  Oh, after baking, I thickened the strained pan drippings with 2T cornstarch.

Yummy! Beef turned out great marinated in the sauce. After marinating the beef in the sauce I reduced the sauce by half and then used it the next night for a stir fry!

I used reduced sodium soy sauce and I used sliced green onion as the onion in this recipe. I also increased the garlic to what my husband calls a "crapton". I marinated my pork in this overnight, then cooked it this morning before it got hot and so I could have some before I went to work. I made Cold Sesame Noodles to go with it. It was quite good, though I think it's missing something. Next time, I'd increase the ginger for sure. Marinating for a length of time is really the way to go for best results.

Very good marinade, good for last minute marinade if you dont have time to marinade overnight (which I prefer).  I also marinaded some mushrooms for a few hours I think, but they were way too salty.  A 1/2 hr probably would be better for mushrooms.

Very good teriyaki recipe!  I omitted the water, reduced the brown sugar to 1/4 c, and added dark Karo syrup for color and a bit of glazing. Used this to marinate a steak, and it was delish!  Boyfriend says this is a keeper!  I agree.

This was pretty good. I made it with a chicken stir fry. It was delicious with the chicken, but the vegetables tasted kind of odd. (It's almost as if the vegetables absorbed more of the sugar than the chicken.) I will use again, probably just for chicken though!

I followed recipe w/the exception of less sugar. I think I cut the sugar too much. I did add more ginger,which was a great addition,as well as sliced green onions,and marinated for about 45min. If I would have had more time I would have marinated longer. Oh btw, I did this with mahi mahi,served w/rice Hawaii style,and it was great.

Teriyaki Marinade Haiku: "Needs some more ginger. I used it on some chicken. Nice with steamed veggies." Scaled it back by 1/2 and marinated boneless chicken breast in it overnight ~ grilled the chicken and ate it w/ steamed mixed veggies and rice, although I think it would've been better with more than just a pinch of ginger, and possibly a teaspoon of hot sauce.

I've been so used to buying marinade in a bottle...but after making this, I will NEVER do so again. I doubled the measurements and took two packages of chicken breast. After washing the chicken, I sliced each piece into three long pieces. I then took a pan to the stove with a little bit of oil, lightly cooked both sides and added them to the marinade. This keeps the chicken moist. I prefer baking and did so for a half hour on convection. I added more ginger, as well as some extra/bigger pieces of onion. When putting the chicken into the trays for baking, I dropped in sliced carrots. It all came out amazing, I had more than enough sauce and I fully plan to make this a lot in the future! Thanks for posting it!

This is so good and easy! I have made it several times and the only change I have made was using orange juice instead of water. Was love this grilled or in the smoker. Use this chicken on Bahn Ma Recipe on allrecipe site as well.

This has become my "go to" recipe for marinade.  Easy to make with ingredients that I had on hand.

I exchanged the water for orange juice and dropped the sherry. I made the liquid equal parts and it was delicious!!!!
