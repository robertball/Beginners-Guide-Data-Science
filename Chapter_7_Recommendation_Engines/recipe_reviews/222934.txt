I just want to thank you! This recipe got my very picky children to eat their rice! We thinned the sauce some so it could be poured over the rice itself and it was a hit! I will definitely make this again!

Delicious and easy! I threw in some onion and tomato that I had leftover, and that tasted great with the other flavors.

Not my favorite recipe for adobo chicken. It didn't have the depth other recipes have. I ended up reducing the liquid and adding other things to it to make it taste good. I added more soy sauce, some honey, ginger...  made it into a thick sauce and brushed it on the chicken that was lacking the flavor I craved. Won't make again.

My family loved this receipe, I did tweak it a bit after making it the first time. I used apple cider vinegar, low sodium soy sauce, added whole garlic cloves, a small quartered onion and two extra bay leaves..It gave it an extra kick.  It even tastes better the next day..

This recipe was not bad. The first time I made it as-is. The second time I made it with apple cider vinegar instead of white and both my husband and I thought it was an improvement. This will probably be my go-to recipe when I just want to throw together dinner since it's so easy and I always have the ingredients on hand. Sometimes I add a few tablespoons of sugar to the sauce to make things interesting. Always spoon the sauce over rice! :-)

This makes a nice, tasty, healthy dish.  I served it over rice with broccoli and water chestnuts.  Everyone enjoyed it and my daughter quickly grabbed the leftovers for lunch for the next day.  I ended up deboning the chicken because if you eat with your eyes, no one would find my dish appetizing.  This is not a reflection on the recipe, but the cook.  It was the ugliest chicken I’d ever made.  I’m not just talking unattractive, I’m talking down-right ugly.  However, the family was blissfully ignorant of its initial appearance and thought it was very good.

This is the adobo I grew up eating. Not like the other recipe that calls for annato powder. Not to say the other is bad. I just never had that type of chicken adobo.

Very good chicken. Did as another reviewer did and cooked it on the BBQ wrapped in foil. I used chicken broth in place of the water, and very low sodium soy sauce.I also took the chicken out of the foil and put it on the grill for the grill marks.The chicken turned out nice and juicy. This is a keeper for me. Thank you moaa for this very tasty recipe..

My family loved the flavor of this delicious chicken. I removed the skin off my drumsticks (about 16) to make it a little healthier.  The chicken was tender and flavorful. I always try to add veggies to all my meals, so I added 3 red potatoes, 2 chayotes, and 1 large onion cut into medium pieces.  Once I had all the ingredients in the pot, I let it simmer for about 40 minutes before adding the vegetables to the top. I mixed a few times during the cooking process to make sure that the chicken and vegetable absorbed the flavor of the ingredients.  It was so good that it inspired me to write my first review! Yum!

First time trying chicken adobo.  I subbed apple cider vinegar, as suggested.  I only had four thighs, but made the full recipe.  Skimmed fat & peppercorns from the broth, added a little water & used that to make the rice. This wasn't vinegary or too salty.  I'd say the rice was better than the chicken. It was pretty bland, but I've noticed other recipes call to marinate it so perhaps that's the key.  'Sure was easy.  :)

i used chicken breast, next time i'll do leg meat or pork. I used the exact measurements and found it to be quite bland and even a bit over cooked,although breast is a little dryer than leg meat maybe a 25-30 min simmer would suffice. i was worried that it may be salty on account of it saying to add water if salty but it totally could have used MORE soy sauce and probably more bay leaf, and unfortunately the traditional flavor just wasn't there. i did add half an onion with the garlic and i will definitely NOT be using this recipe ever again.

Cooked it a little longer, didn’t have peppercorn so I just used red pepper flakes and additional pepper. Only had 6 legs so I halted the recipe.

This was really good. I used apple cider vinegar and added chopped onions. I also removed  the chicken and finished it off in the oven (400 degrees, 20 minutes, turning once) just to get crisper skin on the legs. Just a personal preference. I then cooked the sauce down a little and poured over the chicken and rice. My husband, myself, and my kids (3 & 8) all liked this meal.

I added 2tbsp of oyster sauce to the recipe and it was very juicy. Not too salty at all, it was actually kind of bland so I did sprinkle some salt after on my plate and it made all the difference.

Wow, this was soooooo easy.  I love recipes like.  The only reason I'm not giving it the highest rating is because the chicken wasn't seasoned enough for me.  Perhaps because I used low sodium soy sauce, not sure.  The chicken cooked to perfection _ tender, succulent and juicy.  In the future, I will season the chicken more and add some 'heat' to the recipe.  Highly recommend.

a hit here. removed the chicken from the sauce once it was done and added some cornstarch and water to thicken it to a gravy. tasted great. i added some salt and garlic powder to the chicken legs as they were browning and i believe it helped the flavor a lot. also used low sodium soy sauce

My mother-in-law is native Hawaiian and this recipe is very similar to a dish she makes. Sometimes I use apple cider vinegar instead of white and add zucchini, but the recipe as it is is delicious!

Real good.   I did this in a foil tray on the grill.   When they were all done, I removed from the liquid and grilled just until I had grill marks.   Other than that, I followed the recipe as written.

Per my husband's request, I serve this once a week.  My guys eat enough to feed an army, so I have to adjust accordingly.  I use two family packs of legs & thighs, which lasts two meals.  Everyone in my house loves the flavor and tenderness of the chicken.  It's even better the next day.  Great recipe!

This an awesome recipe! I did add my own touch tho... I seasoned with Garlic Powder and Pepper, doubled the amount of crushed garlic and and a sliced small yellow onion, which I sweated in the chicken grease after browning the pieces, I also added about 1/4 cup Chinese Oyster Sauce in the end. It is Fantastic!

Easy and tasty!  The chicken tasted wonderful.  Also, it was simple to make with ingredients already in my cabinets.

This was awesome. I didn't have peppercorns on hand but I just eyeballed everything else. I'd also browned some sausage to put into some dirty rice, and I sauteed the mashed garlic cloves in the grease. Used a slotted spoon to remove the garlic then used some water to get the yummy bits out of the skillet. That went into the chicken sauce. It was delicious. I like a lot of flavor though, so I probably used quite a bit more soy sauce and vinegar than most people. Thank you. :)

Great recipe! I love that there is a minimal amount of ingredients, at least, fewer than another one I used. The result was fabulous! I also added some baby carrots for a crock-pot soft quality of mushiness. Delicious recipe, will make time and time again.
