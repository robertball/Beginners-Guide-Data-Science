Excellent and easy to make, but with a rather subtle taste. So I prefer to double the amount of malted milk balls and the malt powder.

This requires a lot of tinkering to get a bold,  malted flavor.  I doubled the malted milk powder and, since chocolate malted milk powder is predominantly sugar, I cut back on the sugar to compensate. It still had an only subtle malted flavor and was still too sweet. What I do like about this recipe is that compared to others the chocolate doesn't dominate. However, since so much more chocolate malted milk powder is necessary than is called for in this recipe, I think next time I'll use regular ol' malted milk powder which has no added sugar, then flavor to taste with a squirt or two of Hershey's chocolate syrup.

I altered the recipe, and as suggested  to add more malt powder & crushed malt balls to create more flavor. I added 1 cup chocolate malted milk powder & 2 cups chocolate malt balls. It was excellent! Very creamy texture and tastes very close to Thrifty's 'Chocolate Malted Crunch'! :)

I made this and also doubled the malted milk powder and balls. I add a hefty squirt of chocolate syrup since I wanted more chocolate flavor. It made 2 1/2 qts and tastes wonderful, not too sickening sweet. Definately a keeper. It would be good for milkshakes too!

This was the first recipe I made in my White Mountain Ice Cream maker.  It was perfect.  I also recommend increasing the amount of malt powder and malted milk balls.  This recipe was a winner and will be made again!

I doubled the chocolate malted milk powder and crushed malted milk balls.  I also used half and half in place of the milk.  This ice cream is so incredibly creamy!  Next time I will halve the amount of sugar since I doubled the malt powder and malted milk balls.

Tastes just like a frosty. I did screw up and added vanilla malt powder instead of chocolate. To fix I added cocoa powder. Won't be buying store ice cream again

Only giving 4 stars because made changes.  This is a great ice cream.  I made for our daughter's softball team party.  We wanted ice cream that tastes like the frosty malts you get at the professional ball parks.  I used 1 1/4 cups malt powder and 1/3 cup cocoa.  Perfect!  Everything else I kept the same except I use egg beaters instead of eggs because then I don't have to cook it.  Oh!  And for milk, I used whole milk.  Next time may use half and half for the milk just to make it even creamier.  Outstanding taste!!!

Yummy!!  My husband made this and I thought he didn't chop the malted milk balls enough.  I was surprised that the malted part didn't get mushy.  Good flavor.  We had to freeze in two batches and the second batch was creamier and we're thinking it's because it had more time to chill before freezing therefore, not having to churn as long = less air in the ice cream.  Will do again.

This recipe is very good if you double the chocolate malt powder. Otherwise there will not be enough chocolate flavor. I didn't have enough whipping cream so I used half light cream. I can stop looking for a good chocolate ice cream recipe now. My husband liked the crushed milk balls added in but I didn't.

This ice cream turned out pretty good.  Our grocery store only had vanilla malted milk powder so I added cocoa to the recipe and it tasted great.  We have a soft serve ice cream maker.  The small pieces of malted milk balls caused the hole the ice cream comes out of to stop up so we had to scoop it out.  So just letting you know if you have one of these soft serve ice cream makers too, plan on scooping it out.  It's worth it though.  Enjoy!

Not bad, I prepared as it was written, was alittle much for my little KitchenAid ice cream maker. So if you have the ice cream attachment for your mixer cut the recipe by a 1/3 to 1/2.  I also used skim milk because that's pretty much all I keep in the house and my custard mixture didn't thicken, however, it still made a successful ice cream.  I agree with the other reviews, needs more malt balls and a bit more chocolate flavor, but I will be making again with a few adjustments.

This recipe rocks! That being said, I did take the advice of some reviewers and added more malted milk powder & some cocoa powder. Out of all the ice cream recipes I have tried, I like the texture and consistency of this best. I will continue to make this recipes as is, as well as use it for a base for other flavors & add-ins. It was really delish and a favorite for sure! Thanks!

Chocolate can easily over-power malt, so use plain malt powder upping to 1 cup and add chocolate to your liking. Otherwise great recipe! I did add some whole chocolate malted milk balls 1/2 way through churning.
