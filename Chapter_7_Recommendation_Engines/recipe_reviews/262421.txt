2.4.18  This is so easy to make and fast enough for a tasty weeknight dinner.  The only thing I did differently was to replace a cup of the water with some fresh chicken broth that I had left from cooking some thighs yesterday.  We enjoyed this curry, but felt it was a bit salty.  In the future, Iâ€™ll use all chicken broth (no water), eliminate the chicken bouillon granules, and replace the garlic salt with garlic powder.  Michelle, thanks for sharing your recipe, we enjoyed it.

A smidge too salty but otherwise fantastic! Will make again with only minor adjustments to the amount of seasoning.
