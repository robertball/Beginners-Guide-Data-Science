I prepared this in a 9X13 pan which made it like a deep dish pizza, and it was very good!  I used a spaghetti sauce without meat, as that was what I had on hand and mozzarella cheese.  The whole family loved it!

My husband loves this recipe but I thought it was so-so. Next time, I am going to make a few adjustments. My dish came out a little runny so I will probably add more meat next time. I do not like sausage so I omitted the sausage and I think that's why it was runny. So more beef. I also chopped up an onion and added it and it was much more flavorful. Good quick recipe.

All my picky eaters like this.  I also used 9 x 13 pan, and didn't have the pepperoni, but still good stuff!

This was a good find!  Truthfully, I was afraid to see how this would look when it was done.  It was good regardless.  I did teak the toppings to what we liked on a pizza, and I only used a jar of pizza sauce.  We loved it!  You should try it AND USE A SPATULA TO GET IT OUT!!!!!
