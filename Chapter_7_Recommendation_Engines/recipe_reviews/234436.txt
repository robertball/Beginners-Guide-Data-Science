I make these as appetizers for almost every bar-b-que. My version uses a light shake of "rib-rub" instead of brown sugar and done on the smoker till the bacon starts to crisp up. I make more each time. But, never have any left!

I altered recipe. 1 cup ketchup, 1 cup brown sugar, 1 cup miracle whip salad dressing instead of Worcestershire sauce called for.

I was looking for a quick recipe to bring to a party with ingredients I already had in the house.  I only had precooked chicken jalape√±o/roasted red pepper sausage in the house so that is what I used.  It was the hit of the party. This recipe is a keeper!

These were really good! Made as written, but suggest you watch them in the oven as mine were staring to burn before an hour. Everyone enjoyed them...I just wish I could have gotten a better pic, lol. I would make these again! Thanks for sharing. :)
