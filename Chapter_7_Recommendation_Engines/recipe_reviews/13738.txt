We made this last Thanksgiving (with regular apple cider) and it is delicious! This Christmas, my husband is demanding that we have it again and not try any other glazes. During cooking, the cider flavor gets into the stuffing as well (if you stuff your turkey) and makes it even more delicious! Enjoy!

I used this glaze for our thanks giving turkey but i also added some maple syrup,a spoonful of grape jelly and some Montreal chicken seasoning. The turkey was delicious and had lots of flavor. It will definitely become a thanks giving tradition.

Sounds good, but doesn't really flavor the turkey at all.  The turkey took longer to reach the right temperature than expected, hence the honey glaze ended up burning the turkey even after being covered.  I basted several times, but there was no cider or honey flavor in the turkey or stuffing, just a little bit on the burnt skin.  Will try something that can infuse some flavor into the turkey next time, this one didn't.

A great glaze for a Thanksgiving turkey. The skin of the bird was golden brown with a hint of sweetness. I used this glaze on my turkey that I roasted in a Nesco. I glazed the turkey immediatly and continued to brush on the glaze throughout the roasting process. I also used the remaining apple juice in the bottom of the roaster. Our turkey was wonderful!

Used apple cider, instead of juice.  Also helps to let the butter cool down a bit before basting the turkey.  This gave a good, slightly sweet flavor to the skin.
