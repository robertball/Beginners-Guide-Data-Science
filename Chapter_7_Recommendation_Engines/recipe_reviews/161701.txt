YUM! I do not eat grains or dairy, so this recipe was perfect! I did make a few changes to make it a bit healthier: I used 1/2 cup of unsweetened applesauce instead of vegetable oil, and Eggbeaters instead of 3 eggs. I added extra coffee and vanilla as I  love both, and they turned out great! I didn't mind the texture, and I couldn't really taste the beans. To those who CAN taste the beans: try adding a little more cocoa, coffee, or vanilla next time. The additional flavors really mask the beans.

I have a killer sweet tooth and I have to say these are pretty gosh darn good.  I experimented a little and found that adding about a teaspoon of baking powder gives a little more cake-like brownie if you prefer that texture.  I left out the coffee and I cannot taste any black bean flavor.  Great recipe!

I've had these before and they were excellent however, I would not recommend using special dark cocoa...it makes the recipe unedible.

These are delicious!! I've made them many times over and have figured out how to make them perfectly. I bake them for 26 minutes instead of the full 30 that the recipe calls for, and they are perfectly done! I also use only Ghiradelli sweetened cocoa, and Ghiradelli 60% cocoa dark chocolate chips, as well as walnuts (since I prefer walnuts in my brownies). I also add 2-3 drops of almond extract along with the vanilla extract, and I blend all ingredients in a food processor. The end result is a very chocolaty and smooth brownie where you don't get any bean texture or taste- they are just awesome!

Delicious! I did, however, add, as one reviewer suggested, a small amount of baking powder to make the brownies more cake-like. They were very delicious and there is no apparent black bean flavor at all!

We are brownie conosuiers and my family absolutely LOVED these brownies!! I didn't have instant coffee so I substituted with 3 tsps of strong coffee. It definitely brought out the chocolate flavor and we couldn't taste the beans at all. A little different texture but very similar to fudgy brownies which we love. Will definitely make again!!

I liked these, but must admit to not loving them.. yet. I was hoping for a deeper richer chocolate taste and a bit more of a traditional chewy texture. I will play with this a bit and see what I can come up with.. perhaps more cocoa powder for the chocolate part and for texture? maybe a few nuts of soemthing.. it needs some THING in there just besides the brownie. Something crunchy or chewy... with a bite

I made these for my girlfriends and no one could guess that they contained black beans! Not the same taste as a high calorie double fudge brownie, but still, an amazing brownie considering the ingredients.

Who'd ever think of using black beans in brownies?  My hubby and I are both watching our weight, and since we both love to eat sweets, I was looking for a healthier brownie recipe.  I found it! This was surprisingly delicious!  The only thing I miss is the flaky topping I'm used to seeing when I make brownies from a box.  I followed this recipe exactly, it was moist and very tasty.

I've recently been trying to stay away from flour but I love my sweets and chocolate.  I didn't have the coffee, but I have a feeling it would have taken the very mild hint of black bean flavor completely away.  I used a lot of chocolate chips which I think helped as well.  Great for a healthy twist on brownies.

My kids devoured these. I made them as written. They never noticed that they were "healthy" just slightly different than the box mixes. The second time I made them I attempted to "up" the nutritional benefits and used 1/3 applesauce instead of oil and added a tablespoon of ground flax meal. Also, instead of white sugar I used 1/2 raw turbinado sugar and 1/4 cup agave syrup.I preferred a little less coffee so decreased that to 1/2 tsp. and added extra 1/2 tsp vanilla. These were moister than the original. I am impressed with the idea of using black beans for flour. So many health benefits in this recipe. Thanks for posting!

If you want a healthier lower-fat, high fiber, gluten & dairy free brownie, you'll have accept that you'll be making some taste and texture sacrifices. We had mixed reviews: one daughter loved them and the other said they are the worst ever but asked for more.  These satisfied our brownie craving in a healthful way, but they DO have a subtle black bean flavor and they DO dissolve in your mouth. I did not opt for the optionals.  Update:  I made these again and doubled the cocoa powder and vanilla. I added a tsp of baking powder, and replaced the eggs with 3 T flax meal soaked in 6 T water. I replaced 1/4 cup of the white sugar with turbinado sugar. The bean flavor is much less noticable with the changes and the texture is improved. I will be making these again for my family, but I would not share them with others who are not receptive to "health food".

Surprisingly good! I added 1/2 tsp. baking soda and 1/2 tsp. baking powder and substituted 1/2 cup applesauce for the oil and Splenda for the sugar. I didn't add chocolate chips. Cutting out the oil, sugar and chocolate chips reduces the brownies to only 40 calories each. These are the best low-fat, low-calorie brownies I've ever eaten. They taste even better with a dollop of Cool Whip on top. NOTE: These need to be refrigerated. I had a few left over, which I left on the kitchen table for a few days, and they got moldy...yuck!

WOW! I am so happy I made these.  I seriously TRIED to taste the black beans, but couldn't.  I don't even own a blender to make it smooth, just mashed everything up in a bowl using a potato masher and it worked wonderfully.  Absolutely zero black bean taste or aftertaste.    Hubby really likes them too so he took the rest(5 lol) to work to share.  My tweaks:  used 3 eggs but took out 1 yolk, applesauce instead of oil, 1/3 cup Hershey's cocoa powder, 3 tsp vanilla, 1/3 cup + 10 tsp. white sugar(about half what the recipe calls for!), and 1 tsp. brewed coffee.  I also sprinkled chocolate chips and walnuts on top.  Checked at 25 min., still liquid in a spot or two, so I let it go to 30 min. and they came out PERFECT.  I've always made boxed brownies, NEVER AGAIN!!  I can't wait to make more and share them with everyone!!  I registered just to leave this feedback...I'm so freakin' impressed.  Brownies with fiber, couldn't be more perfect.  THANK YOU!!!

I was very pleased with how easy these brownies are to make.  My family is very picky and loved these brownies.  They were shocked to learn what they were made with.  We made a second batch and added 1/4 cup of coconut and they tasted just like an almond joy bar.  This recipe is an absolute keeper in our house.

This is one of the BEST brownie recipes I have! I have made them several times! I put 1 1/2 t. baking powder and about 1/2 c. milk chocolate chips in the blender also.  They have been requested instead of cake for a birthday- Warm topped with Breyers Natural Vanilla Ice Cream! MMM MMM Good!!  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!  Turn you eyes upon JESUS!!!

Very good alternative to a traditional brownie; provides a somewhat guilt free chocolate indulgence for those of trying to watch what we eat.  I took the suggestion from many previous reviews to use applesauce (3/4c) instead of oil, add baking soda (1 tbs), to use more cocoa (1/4 c +) and more vanilla extract (2 tsp).  I did forget to add the instant coffee, but it still turned out great.  The brownie was moist and fluffy, almost cake like (which I prefer) and you can taste the black bean, but it is not overwhelming and the chocolate taste is upfront.  My GF, who has affliction for chocolate and sweets absolutely was in love with these brownies.  I plan on making this recipe again and am interested to see what the coffee will do for this recipe.  I also plan on using less sugar and substitute ingredients, but for now I don't want to mess up a good thing.  Enjoy!

As wierd as the recipe sounds, these are surprisingly good and satisfying!  I used 4 oz of applesauce and 1 tablespoon of coconut oil in lieu of the vegetable oil.  I also used stevia in place of sugar, and dark chocolat chips.  I had some chopped walnuts on hand, so topped the pan with them.  Super good. I will definitely make these often.  Mine had no bean taste whatsoever! :)

This was an awesome alternative to brownies. I did make some changes to increase the flavor and make it a bit healthier: 1/2 c applesauce instead of the oil, 1/2 c cocoa powder, 3 t vanilla extract, 1/2 c splenda, 1/4 c brown sugar, 2 t instant coffee. I meant to add a tsp of baking powder, but forgot. They were very thin, but still good. I don't know why everyone's complaining about the texture. I didn't find anything wrong with it; it's like a cake-brownie. And no matter how hard I tried, I could NOT taste the beans. My 9 year old step-son despises beans, and he ate the whole pan within 24 hours, even knowing what was in it. Definitely give it a try if you're looking for something healthy to fix a chocolate craving!!

To make it lower fat I followed advice from previous reviewer and added 1/3 cup of applesauce in place of oil. I'd imagine adding the same amount of banana puree would work too. Sugar I replaced with 1/3 cup agave nectar which gave the perfect level of sweetness for me. I wanted it to be very chocolatey so I increased cocoa powder to 1/3 cup. Next time I'll increase even more to 1/2 cup and reduce the chocolate chips to 1/4 cup (to reduce fat). I also sprinked 1/4 cup of chopped pecans  before baking. This was delicious! I ate 1/4 of the cake right out of the oven, yum! This is supposed to be better the next day?! I can't wait to eat it again tomorrow. Will definitely make again! Thanks for the recipe!

These brownies were pretty darn good.  I made them twice.  The second time I made a few changes and thought they were better.  I replaced the oil with apple sauce, increased the cocoa powder (this covered up the flavor of the beans better) and added walnuts.  I also added a little more sugar. These changes made them taste more like regular brownies to me.  I will definitely make these again.  They are also by far the easiest "from scratch" brownies I've ever made.

SO GOOD. I melted two-ounces of semi-sweet baking chocolate squares an put in an extra teaspoon of cocoa powder. Instead of white sugar, I used sucanant (dehytrated sugar cane). I put a teaspoon of baking powder in as well. The brownies came out fudgy and melted in my mouth. Couldn't taste the beans at all! I made sure to puree the mixture to eliminate any texture. Tasted exactly like boxed brownies... only healthier!

If your batter seems a little runny, add 2 tsp. of flour (any kind) to help soak up the extra liquid. It helps make the brownies more cake-like. 

I also tried garbanzo beans as well and they were still tasty! Best recipe for brownies ever!

These are really good! Like the other reviewers, I added an extra 1/4 c. sugar and 1/4 c. extra cocoa powder. I didn't have any vanilla so I used amaretto liqueur instead. I got a bit crazy with the liqueur and ended up adding 1/4 cup o_O but the slight nutty sweet taste was awesome. 

I made these at the same time that I made "normal" brownies from scratch and conducted a blind taste test on my husband. Not only did he prefer these brownies to the "normal" brownies, but he actually though they WERE the "normal" brownies. 

I used dried beans instead of canned, and I wonder if canned beans are the culprit in the "bean" taste others report (they have a lot of sodium, even unsalted). I soaked the dried beans for 24 hours in the fridge, rinsing every now and then. Then I covered them with water and cooked them on the stove until they were mushy (a bit "overdone" than what you'd want for any other dish). 

I blended the beans until they were completely liquified, added in the sugar and other ingredients, and baked. Eating through the pan, even I'M surprised they were made with beans as there is not a single ounce of "bean" flavor, and the texture is almost like rich chocolate cake.

This was good. My husband actually quite liked it but it certainly didn't fulfill my chocolate cravings. I followed reviewer suggestions and substituted 1/2 cup applesauce for the oil and added a tsp of baking powder. It was quite mousse like and I didn't taste any beans or coffee. I'll maybe make it for the hubby but definitely not for me when I'm craving something chocolaty!

These were so yummy! No one can guess they have black beans in them. I love the texture! The only changes I would make would be to add an extra tablespoon of cocoa and only 1/2 teaspoon of coffee. Thanks for this recipe!

I met with my personal trainer Monday and we discussed two things:  my sweet tooth and the need to incorporate more protein in my diet.  Yay, this sweet treat does both!  I upped the cocoa to 1/3 cup as others suggested and I added chopped walnuts to the top.  There's still plenty of sugar in this brownie, but it tasted great and takes care of the sweet craving while providing more nutritional value than a typical brownie!  Thanks for the recipe.  My three kids love them, also!

I wanted to like these - and they were a little chocolately but had a gritty texture, dry, and not that great. Thanks, but no thanks.

I love healthy baking, and I am used to things tasting a little funky now and then. I had high hopes, but this recipe, sadly, was terrible. It tasted like re-fried beans.

I read with interest many of the reviews prior to making these brownies.  Some complained they were to dry, others too wet, others claimed these were perfect.  I am a very novice baker, and wasn't sure what to expect.  I have to say I nailed it first try.  How they are too dry or too wet - from "experienced" bakers is beyond me.  The texture is somewhat fudgey.  I could not taste the beans at all.  Using the optional coffee probably is the reason there was no bean taste.  I was so proud of my accomplishment, I brought them into work for others to sample.  They all loved them - and not because they are all polite people and I am so nice... the compliments were sincere & it was recommended I bring in more for an up coming bake sale - they were the first to sell out and people asked for the recipe - of course I would not give the recipe out (I am not that nice).
If anyone has any doubts, do not worry... make these brownies.  I did mine completely in a blender... and now add more chocolate chips or sometimes carob.  This is a proven winning recipe.

Had to try these and they were surprisingly good!  Even my 2 chocoholics liked them.  Very moist and can't taste the beans.  Based on suggestions, I made a few minor changes.  I used applesauce instead of the oil, added more cocoa powder and 1 tsp baking powder.  I used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/4 brown sugar, and semi-sweet chocolate chips.  Loved mixing it all in the blender, then just pouring it in the pan!  Will likely make again.

If you want the brownies more on the chewy side, I recommend adding 1/2 cup of oats. I used 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce instead of the oil, 2/3 cup egg whites instead of 3 whole eggs, and I added 1/4 cup reduced fat peanut butter because I love peanut butter. Also added 1/2 cup chopped walnuts. Voila! Brownies that are GOOD for you.

Not really a good substitute for brownies. Maybe if you've never had any other kind of brownie these would be great. But I don't think they're really good, they are edible though. Its not the taste of the black beans for me its the texture I think. My husband didn't like them and neither did my twins.

OMG -- I'm amazed.  These are so good! I'm shocked.  I used dry  kidney beans cooked in the crock pot and substituted apple sauce for the oil.  Worked like a charm.  Two thumbs up -- you have to try this recipe to believe it.

Well. I love the idea of using black beans in brownies. But this recipe just didn't work well for me. I made no changes save omitting the chocolate chips, but I should've taken the advice to add baking powder as the texture was NOT COOL. I don't mind moist brownies if it's a fudgy-type moist, but this texture was just weird. The flavour was okay, not quite as chocolatey as it couldve been and a slight bean taste (not much). If I were to make again, I would add 1tsp baking powder, extra cocoa, and the chocolate chips, and work from there.

Added 1 tsp baking powder. The coffee was the magic ingredient!  I made these (as I am gluten free) for a party and they were gone before the regular brownies were. Delicious!

Thought these brownies were really good, but I decided to tweak it a little bit to give it more chocolate aroma & flavor as well as extra protein. I added 5 teaspoons of vanilla instead of the recommended, 2 teaspoons of baking powder, 1/2 cup of cocoa powder & instead of oil I used a 6oz container of Yoplait Honey Vanilla Greek yogurt.

WOW!!!!! I am soo amazed at this recipe. I had this in my box and hadn't made it until, someone dared me....well glad I did. I follow the recipe to the T, but for the optional milk chocolate chips I used the Mint & Dark Chocolate chips instead and did add the coffee. OH WE LOVED!!! It was moist, rich, and delishious. My kids approved knowing full well their were beans in it. I will so keep this recipe in my box and make plenty again. Thanks!

I like it but do I love it? Ummm....well....  I will say  that you really can't get a better brownie that's not made the traditional way.   It has lots of fiber and protein in it.  Use an alternate sweetner (like Agave) if you want to take out all the "white".  Add 1 1/2 tsp baking powder to lighten it up and make it soft and cake-like.  This will be saved in my recipe box for sure.  I feel less guilty eating these.  Thanks for the recipe!

I use this recipe often! 

Minor changes, I like fudger brownies so I use only two eggs. I also grease pan with coconut oil (and use it in recipe instead of vegetable oil when its summer since its a liquid then) 

Only problem is I will eat them all! 

Baking soda does give a caker brownie with 3 eggs so if you like that go for it.

These were surprisingly good! All of my children liked them and asked for seconds. (Of course, I didn't tell them there was anything unusual about the recipe.)    I added 1 Tbs of brewed coffee in place of the instant and 1/2 tsp of baking powder and they turned out great. I will be making them again!

Wow!!!!!! Who would have thought that black beans could be added to brownies and that they could be THIS good?!   I did not use coffee in mine. I used semi-sweet chocolate chips and did not change anything else in the recipe. My kids are 6 and 3 and they can't stand healthy food - or anything where they can taste anything "different" that I try to sneak in. With these, the kids had no idea that they were anything different from regular brownies and both asked for seconds. The brownies were out of the oven less than a half hour ago and already, half of them are gone.   Finally a recipe that is husband approved and kid approved. I'll definitely be making this again.

These brownies were okay, but a little strange.  I made them with Splenda and there was as little bit of after taster with them. I dont know if using sugar would have helped with this.  I did not tell my wife that they were made of beans and she spit it out asfter tasting it. This of course hurt my feelings.   It looked really pretty once it was cooked.  A nice smooth top and bits of chocolate chips.

I think that this is a love it or hate it recipe, I was really hoping to love it and excited to make it, but no. The texture of these is gritty, grainy, not right. Plus, you can taste the beans, the only good part of these were the chocolate chips on top!

Seriously, everyone who cares about their health MUST try this. Reading all the comments, I used 4T of unsweetened applesauce, 1/3C sugar, 2T honey, 1 tsp of baking powder, 1/2C of cocoa, about 1/3 of chopped walnuts. Try not to omit the coffee since it brings out the flavour. (We like our brownies with strong cocoa flavour and not as sweet.) They turned out so delicious and quite "fudgey"! Served with frozen raspberries and I'm sure fresh whipped cream would have made it a lot better. With or without the toppings I would still enjoy, and I am definitely making them again and again. If I really want to indulge, I would add chocolate chips (I omitted the chips because I wanted to see how it would turn out to be). Oh and I had to bake at least 10 minutes more than stated but that might be because I added extra cocoa and additional honey for part of sugar. Just keep checking until your tester comes out clean.

Not bad for a healthy alternative. But if you are expecting this to replace brownies, be warned. The texture is more grainy, less fudgey, and flat. But, with a glass of cold milk, it will surely satisfy that sweet tooth

i made these as is and they were ok.  so i made them again adding 1/3 cup honey instead of sugar and 1/2 cup cocoa powder and reduced the egg to 2.  I really enjoyed these much better.  i like the taste of dark chocolate and the recipe as is is way to lite chocolate for me. i didnt taste any black bean in them.  i asked my husband to try and he said they were good but too cakey tasting for his brownie liking.  i didnt tell them him the base of the recipe was black bean. i blended my black beans in the vita mix. if you dont have just make sure you blend up very well and i am sure you wont have the black bean taste at all!

I do aqua exercise, and took these and Dr. Oz's black bean brownies to the pool for everyone to do a taste test. These won!. I made a few changes to make them healthier. I used 2 egg whites and one whole egg,  3 Tbl coconut oil instead of veg oil, 1/2 cup cocoa pdr as some reviewers did(it was perfect), 1/4 cup granulated fruitose & 1/2 cup Stevia in the Raw instead of sugar, and used a glaze & mini choc chips on top. I baked them in mini muffin tins for 14 minutes. They were a big hit. I will be making them again.

This had the texture of weird cake and tasted a lot like beans even though I had a 15 oz. can instead of a 15.5 oz. can. Luckily my icing made it O.K.

These are GREAT!  I used a little more than a tablespoon of espresso because I didn't have instant coffee and a teaspoon of baking powder like a few others suggested.  I baked them, then went to the store while they were cooling.  I was a bit skeptical when I got home and my whole kitchen smelled like beans but as soon as I tasted them I was impressed!  Even my 21 month old keeps saying "more? more?" lol  Definitely a keeper!

Pretty good for a "healthy" brownie. Best when still warm. I added about 2 tbsp hazelnuts and a few more chocolate chips. I also used Hershey's special dark cocoa.

Really good! Not totally like brownie, but my family loved them.  Considering the extra protein/fiber etc, I think this is a great recipe.  I used a tsp baking powder as suggested by other reviewers, subbed 1/4 real sugar and 1/4 sun crystals for the 3/4 sugar and topped with peanut butter chips.  I used my food processor instead of a blender and it was just surprisingly good, not to mention super quick to make - just dump everything in and puree!

I was hopeful with this recipe since overall it got 4 stars.  However, these brownies were not good at all.  The consistency was good.  I'm really sorry, but all you could taste was black beans.  I checked the recipe several times to make sure I followed it correctly.  I am an experienced baker, so know that this review is coming from someone with a lot of experience in the kitchen.

Not like a brownie at all.  more like crumbly fudge or something. if you want a lower calorie chocolate fix then this will help but not much more than that.

After reading the reviews, I was optimistic about this recipe, but I was very disappointed with my own results. It was not near chocolatey enough and the texture was terrible.  It really needs some cheweyness to make it bearable.. as it is, I won't be making it again!!

Don't waste your time making there brownies, there are much better uses for beans than these.  The texture was way too spongey, they taste like black beans, and leave an awful after taste.  Very artificial.  If you are looking for a brownie just eat a brownie.

Given that they contain an entire can of beans and no flour or butter, these were surprisingly good. They are definitely lacking something, though. The picky child in the house loves them, so they will be made again. I will try adding baking powder and stirring chocolate chips into the batter next time.

Very very impressive. I was not sure how this would turn out, but I actually enjoyed it. It did taste a bit different from what you're used to in a brownie and that's why I deducted a star. But for a healthy treat, this is INCREDIBLE! Thanks Elizabeth for this wonderful recipe.

I have made these several times with the following changes, 3T coconut oil instead of vegetable,1/2 C agave nectar instead of sugar and I added 1/2 C chopped walnuts with 1/2C 68% cocoa choc chips, I also cut down the cooking time so they would be more brownie like in texture. Amazing considering they are gluten,sugar and dairy free!

This was quite interesting. I like the idea of packing more beans into my diet and making a healthier junk food. This said, I could definitely taste the beans but it really wasn't a bad flavor. I loaded the top with powdered sugar because it needed more sugar for my sweet tooth. I will try to add more sugar to the recipe next time but as is, just frost it and enjoy! Thanks for a great recipe!

Love these. I eat pretty healthy put have a sweet tooth so I feel these are a nice compromise with the added protein and fiber. I've made them a bunch of times now. I like to add double the instant coffee (hazelnut is my fav) and the vanilla. I only use 2 Tbl. of oil and they turned out perfect. You can also substitute coconut oil for the olive oil and add chopped nuts on top with the choc. chips.

Make sure to rinse and drain the beans really well!

Also, for easy clean up I line my pan with foil then spray with cooking spray.

Excellent recipe!  This is not like "regular" brownies, but if you want a healthier alternative, then this is definately a happy medium.  I would rate this 5 stars, but my family did not like it (psshh, they eat all the fatty sweets and never gain a pound, so if you are used to/expecting sugary, fattiness, then this isn't for you) for us watching the girlish figure, its great!

I did not like the texture of these brownies. They fell apart very easily and did not taste very brownie-like. I'm not sure if I did something wrong based on the other reviews, but following this as is did not work for me.

Loved this!! I am always looking for healthier dessert recipes & this was a winner! I made these for my boyfriend for Valentines day! He loved them! I made it in a heart shaped pan with red & pink smarties on the top.     I made a few changes to make it "healthier".    I used 1/2 cup applesauce (in place of the oil), 1 1/2 tsp. Vanilla, 1 1/2tsp coffee, a bit under 1/8 cup of Stevia (in place of the sugar), dark chocolate chunks for in the batter. Turned out amazing!!

I wish I could give this a higher rating but I just can't.  No one in my family really liked these...not even after I tried making a simple powdered sugar icing to gloop on top.  Way too much bean flavor for me and the texture was definately different.  I think I could get past the texture if they didn't taste like you dipped a bean in chocolate.  The only thing I did differently was I didn't have instant coffee so I used 3 tablespoons very strong coffee as recommended by another reviewer.  I like the taste of beans and I like the taste of chocolate but I just couldn't do these two together.  There are plenty of rave reviews so maybe I'm just doing something wrong...?

With this recipe to cut down on sugar, I use half sugar and half splenda.  Also, instead of adding the chocolate chips into the batter, I wait until the brownies are baked and when they are hot, I sprinkle the chips on top.  As the chips melt, I use them as a frosting on top of the brownies, spreading the melted chips around.  When they cool, it's like a thin layer of candy on top.  These brownies are very good and I make them quite often!

An amazing alternative for wheat intolerant people. I took the advice of others and added more cocoa and a bit of baking powder; much fluffier and richer. The no fuss blender method is what really sells the recipe though. The only drawback is a slight bean-like texture at the end, but overall the best no-flour brownie I've ever had.

Excellent!  I didn't have coffee, so did add a little extra cocoa.  I really liked the velvety texture!  I also sprinkled some pecans on top with the chocolate chips.  Delish!

While I really did like the flavor, I see why so many others complained about texture; it has the consistency of Jello that's 'not quite set yet'.

I am so impressed! This was really good. I topped it with strawberries and some cream. Even without the topping you couldn't tell it was made out of beans. What a great idea, expecially for the add'l protein and for anyone looking for a gluten free alternative.  Thanks for the recipe!

Update: Made these again using 1/3 c cocoa and replacing white sugar with brown sugar. This improved richness. Next time I'll replace the oil with butter and see what that gets me. Really like this recipe!

I didn't have chocolate chips to add to this and I did substitute apple sauce for the oil. So based on that I am giving it 4 stars. I used what was on hand and I liked it but family was so so . I thini it's a great alternative to the white flour version!

Our daughter was just diagnosed with celiac disease, so tomorrow we tell her.  She has a Grandfather struggling to stay gluten free and at 8 years old she realizes that there are many treats she will have to give up.  I made these tonight, not telling a soul they were gluten free.  They were dense, rich and yummy with only a slight grainyness that no one mentioned.  Tomorrow amidst the tears I hope these brownies give just a little ray of hope that not all is lost and that we can still enjoy treats.  Thanks for a simple, good, no fancy flours recipe.

Yum! These are my new addiction! Two tips: 1) if they taste like beans you probably didn't rinse the beans enough. Rinse until the water runs clear (3 min?) 2). If the texture is "mouse like" they needed to be blended longer so the eggs whipped OR they needed to be cooked longer. I baked these in a muffin pan for 25 min. Perfect! Oh and I adjusted the cocoa, sugar, and vanilla up. I like strong flavors

Tip 1: Make sure to use the beans. water, salt kind cans. Do not use refried or cans that have garlic and other flavorings - do not create a good-tasting product. Just read the lable.
Tip 2: Drain AND rinse beans thoroughly
Tip 3: Flourless baked product will have a different texture. Be prepared for that.
Tip 4: Use your blender for much longer than you think necessary to create a smooth-pouring batter. 

These were delicious as made to recipe as brownies. I doubled the recipe and added 2 tsp. baking powder. Baked in 10 inch round springform pan about 50 min - till pick came out clean. Made it into a black forest type cake with cherry pie filling inside and topped with whipped cream and with more cherry filling. Everyone loved it at my 22nd anniversary party! A definite keeper! Many thanks!

I really did not care for this recipe whatsoever. While it would be nice for a person who canot have certain ingrediants, it was not especially tasty. The texture was of and the taste of the beans was prelevant. I would not recomend this recipe.

The flavor is excellent. The consistency is a little strange. But you definitely could not taste the black beans. Only changes I made were to add 3/4 tsp baking powder and I used semisweet chips.

I wasn't too into these.  The consistency was strange for me.  Like tofu, almost.  They weren't awful, but not great either. My 3 year old liked them, and my husband said "not bad", but also had a problem with the consistency.

Everyone loved them! They had no clue that black beans were in it. I did add about a teaspoon of baking powder as another reviewer suggested and it had a more cake like texture. I also added pecans and a few chocolate chips in the mix. They were great.

Okay, I read all the reviews so I had to try these.  I found it interesting that you could make brownies with black beans.  So I gave it a try.  I have to admit, I didn't really like them.  I couldn't get past the texture of them.  I forgot to add the baking powdered.  I don't know if that would have helped or not.  I don't know if I would try these again.

These are fantastic! I used a 19 oz can of beans, 3 tbsp of apple sauce instead of oil, 1/4 cup dark brown sugar, 1/4 cup honey and about 2 Tbsp pure maple syrup. Next time I'll omit the chocolate chips as I really don't think it added much, and probably just use 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup maple syrup as they're still very sweet (and I happen to LOVE sweet...!) Also added 1 tsp of almond extract. Very impressed with these... they taste like chocolate almond fudge. Will definitely make again and again. Thanks for the recipe!

Sorry.  The texture is off on this . . . husband and I each had one and threw the rest out.  We'll splurge on "fatty" brownies and keep the beans for the main course.

I thought these were actually outstanding!  My motivation was to bring some unexpected fiber and protein into my 8 year old's menu, while still having a chocolate treat.  She even helped me make them and knew there were beans in them from the start.  My 44 year old BF really enjoyed them, too!  Substitutions:  1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce + 1 tsp coconut oil in place of oil.  1 tsp baking powder.  1 cup organic dark chocolate chips sprinkled on top - 1/2 cup just didn't look like enough in my 9" square pan.  Cut baking time down to 25 minutes due to larger pan.  Perfection!  BE SURE TO BUY BEANS THAT DON'T HAVE ANY SPICES ADDED, OR SOAK DRIED BEANS OVERNIGHT.  Eat warm, then refrigerate after cooking, and zap in the nuke for 10 seconds to re-warm.  So easy, and so YUMMO!

I was gonna give these 3 stars because neither my husband or I liked them.  But then my two daughters came home from school and scrarfed them down and raved about them.  Both girls HATE beans.  So, 4 stars for getting my kids to eat beans.

These will definitely cure a sweet tooth, but next time I'll try adding some baking powder and coffee.  They didn't taste like black beans at all, but the texture was definitely different than normal brownies.

Ok, I have no idea what I expected, but I never expected what I got.  These, to me, taste nothing like brownies.  They remind me of tofu, not sure why.  I made these tonight and I kind of liked them.  (I ate 3 already).  My husband hated them.  If you're cutting calories, TRY them!  I'll probably make them again because I have a HUGE sweet tooth and find it difficult to stick to my diet because of it.  I only wish I had some applesauce so I could have cut out the oil.  Definitely an interesting dessert.

I love this recipe!!  I am constantly looking for foods my brother can have that dont have your typical gritty texture.  This is a recipe that will stay with my family for a while :)  These were not expensive at all, I only had to purchase the beans as the rest of the ingredients are in my cupboard.  I followed the recipe exactly, coffee and all and I really enjoy these brownies!  I may add frosting next time as my husband said they were dry but they came out sort of dense like a brownie, not cakie like they stated in other reviews.  I may add baking powder next time, but overall... a very good recipe!

Delicious. I was skeptical. This is the BEST recipe and so easy. The only thing different that I did was substitute brown sugar for the white sugar. I also didn't use coffee because I didn't have any. I can see how it would cut down that bean flavor. I also used semi sweet chocolate chips because I don't care for milk chocolate.If I didn't make them I wouldn't really even notice that slight beany flavor. It didn't bother me though. My advice is NOT to skip out on the chocolate chips. It really makes them seem richer.

Wow, these are wonderful!  I followed the recipe to the "T".  This is a recipe made in heaven if you have to live on a gluten free diet.  It is so much cheaper than those boxed mixes but has more taste, so moist, and really compares to regular brownies.  I'm sure if you can eat wheat, regular brownies taste better but if you can't, give these a try, you won't be disapointed. Thanks so much for the recipe.

Soooo good - I made them once and they were bad, so I checked the ingredients on the can of beans and it had stuff like onion powder and garlic, so I tried it again with a can of beans that had none of the other flavorings in it and they were awesome!  I guess even after rinsing the beans, the onion/garlic flavor sticks around...

I was paranoid that these were going to taste like beans so I added an extra tablespoon of cocoa powder and an extra teaspoon of coffee. These were very good and you could not taste the beans AT ALL. That being said, I think both optional ingredients are very important and wouldn't leave either of them out. The texture is a bit different from a normal brownie, but that's to be expected given the ingredients. Next time I'm going to try using applesauce instead of the oil to make them even healthier. Thanks for the (almost) guilt-free dessert recipe!

Several people I know would never consider giving these a 5-star rating, just because of the black beans. I did not use instant coffee and was able to taste a hint of black beans. For me, the health-woman, I found them to be the best brownies EVER. I loved the texture. Other people, those who would give an honest opinion, said "these are weird, why does it have this texture?" As for me-- my new favorite brownie. Update: people love these! It tends to be the people who enjoy being healthy & like the taste of "healthy." I don't think I'll ever make brownies with flour again!

i love these brownies they are so moist i will never make another brownie recipie again. my extremly picky husband and children loved them too.  (kids 3 & 7)  however i am going to try applesauce instead of oil next time.  i will let you know how it goes.  i added 1/4 cup of mini ch chips into the batter instead of on top cause i always do that with brownie s and i sprinkled half of the top with chopped pecans.  i am going to do rocky road and smores brownies with this recipie too.  thank you so much for this recipie!!!!

WOW!!!!!!!
I made this for my fiance, as he loves black beans, I told him I was making him something special. He didn't even know there were black beans in there! They are a bit different in texture, but not too much. I'm going to try to make them a little more gooey...but awesome nonetheless! Thanks.

I've made these a few times, tweaking things as I went, and finally ended up with product that I love!  The texture of the original brownie was not to my liking...somewhat mushy. My changes were as follows:  1/2 cup pureed pumpkin instead of the oil; extra TBL of cocoa powder; no salt; extra tsp of vanilla; 2/3 cup sugar instead of 3/4 cup; 1 tsp of cinnamon; 1 tsp of baking powder and 1 tsp of baking soda.  I did not use the coffee or chocolate chips.  The result is a cake-like brownie with a delicious chocolatey flavor, and only about 75 calories a piece!

I have made this recipe twice. The first time as written and the second time with a few modifications: 1. substituted ground flax seed for the eggs, mixing 3 tablespoons of ground flax seed with 9 tablespoons of freshly brewed coffee. Therefore, eliminating the instant coffee. 2. increased the vanilla to 1 tablespoon. 3. added a handful of roasted pecans instead of chocolate chips 4. substituted splenda for sugar.

WHOA! I was really not expecting them to taste this good. Didn't tell the hubbs what the main ingredient is and he couldn't guess. Kids all scarfed them down, no raised eyebrows! Feels good feeding them a treat that's better for them - only 3 weight watcher points, too!

I have to admit that these are not the best brownies I have ever had, BUT considering how much healthier they are for you.. they are amazing! I substituted a few things to make them even healthier. Instead of oil I used unsweetened applesauce. Instead of eggs I used chia seeds (soaked in water for 20 minutes to make a gel). I also cut the sugar to about 1/2 cup and used a few more tablespoons of applesauce.DEEEE-LICIOUS!

These are pretty tasty! If I were gluten-free these would definitely be a staple.  My husband was grossed out by them, others did comment on the weird texture.  Also, occasionally I did run into a bit of the bean's skin when eating.  But overall, taste is great, preparation is a cinch, and they're healthy!

I usually double this recipe and ad 1/4 cup of gluten free cake mix for each batch. So if I double the recipe i put twice as much cake mix to it.  Makes it more of a cake texture without all the cake batter.

I have tried different versions of the BBB and these were by far the best. Other peoples I have tried used canned black beans and they came our spongy and I wasnt crazy about the overall flavor. I prepared my own (soaked them overnight and then cooked them for 2 hours at a simmer) which made the BB very tender and moist. The brownies came out very moist, fudgy and not spongy! Very pleased!!

I made these and gave one to my 5 year old and she was non the wiser about the beans. To be fair, you might get a skin every now and then but if you process it well enough you wont have that problem. I used a shot of espresso with the beans when I put them in my food processor and blended it smooth.  They taste best after they have been chilled in the fridge. Also do not cook longer than 30 mins otherwise they will dry out. Please try them you wont regret it.

Never had black bean brownies until now.  They are pretty good for what they are.  The recipe fit the bill since I have a restricted diet, but not a good substitute for people who are free to eat any kind of brownie they want.  Will continue to make these adding more cocoa.  Also, I did not add the baking powder as some suggested, and I thought they turned out "cakey" enough.

AWESOME!!!  SO good!!  My kids actually PREFER these to "normal" brownies!  I love them, they pass the hubby test, all around family fave.  The only changes I made were semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of milk chocolate and raw sugar instead of white.  One time I ran out of sugar and had to substitute honey for some of the sugar and it came out even better...more gooey!  I use a little more than a half cup of chocolate chips, too!!  So EASY to make using the blender!!  Definitely make these!!

What a fun recipe! My whole family loved them - I'll definitely be making these again. My husband is diabetic so I chose not to add so much sugar (I substituted 1/3 c. agave nectar and only 1/4 c. sugar). 

These are not "quiet" brownies - do expect some flatulence because of the beans. Nothing too scary, mostly entertaining!

This recipe is great.  I made a few revision based on other reviews:
1) I used 1/2 cup applesauce instead of vegetable oil
2) I used extra cocoa powder mostly regular and then added some special dark
3) Omitted the coffee b/c I didn't have any instant around
4) Bake Time says 30 mins, but it takes me about 40-45 to cook all the way through
5) Put a teaspoon of baking powder 

Added: walnuts & special dark chocolate chips + chocolate protein powder

Delish.  The first time I made the recipe minus "add on's" and it was good too!

I added 1/2 tsp each of baking powder and baking soda. Otherwise just as presented. The brownies were quite good, although more like devil's food cake than brownies. Perhaps using just one of the leaveners, or adding chocolate chips or pudding will make them more chewy. But the texture was clean, very tender, and the flavor was intense chocolate, no off flavors at all. I used Hershey's Special Dark cocoa powder. These are going right into the dessert rotation at my house. In fact, I think I might double them to make a chocolate layer cake.

Outstanding!!!  Even added a serving of vanilla flavored plant protein supplement!  The texture is a little different than normal brownies, as the brownie never quite "set."  Next time I will try adding a half a cup of flour to see if this will make a difference.

SO GOOD!
I did make some modifications though. It was a combination of previous reviews' modifications actually. I used 2 eggs instead of 3, 3 TBSP applesauce instead of oil, 1/2 cup of cocoa powder instead of just 1/4 cup, and also added 1 TSP of baking soda. Came out delicious and as long as you make sure the batter is VERY WELL blended and SMOOTH then the texture will not be off :)

Good base recipe but looking at the recipe (and previous reviewer responses), I can already tell how bland it would be. 

I did 1/3 of the recipe and used about 1.5 cups black beans, 2 oz of semisweet chocolate (melted), 1/3 cup of olive oil, 1/3 cup blue agave syrup, 1 egg, and 1 tbsp of cocoa powder. Baked for 45 min and it was delicious.

Love these!!  I made them Weight Watcher friendly.  The changes I made.... I used only 2 eggs, 3 TBS of applesauce instead of oil, one packet of Starbucks VIA instant coffee.  The coffee actually brings out the flavor of chocolate more, and highly suggested.  I made this into mini cupcakes and put in 6 chocolate chip/mint chips.   I figured per one little cupcake is only one point!!   REPEATABLE!!:)

I made these as specified, and they turned out pretty good! More like a sort of flat, flourless chocolate cake than a true brownie, but very moist and light. Not surprisingly, we totally got the toots from these. Be prepared. Not good for a car trip ;)

I really enjoyed these, but I'd like to try to improve the texture when I play around with this recipe in the future... I used applesauce instead of oil, and added 1/2 tsp baking powder as per other suggestions. I also didn't have any instant coffee so I used cinnamon to mask the bean taste, and it worked just fine.  I also want to give this a try with stevia or agave instead of sugar, for the ultimate low-cal, high protein snack!!

Loved it.  Substituted olive oil for vegetable oil.  Used 60% Cacao chocolate chips.  Husband knew there was something in it, but didn't know what.  He liked it until I told him it was black beans.  You do get the farts though... :)  Just warning.

Elizabeth your are a genius! You should go into buissnes if you have more recipes like this sumit them to allrecipes I would love to try them! I made this and I couln't belive how good they are I gave one piece to my husband and daughters as soon as they came out of the oven; they finshed it and asked for a second piece thats when I told my husband what was in it, and he couldn't belive it either. I tried the left overs the next day and I could tatste the beans just a little tiny bit:) but that's not going  to stop  me from making this brownies often, I'm sure they are even better with a scoop of low fat vanilla ice cream. I followed other reviewers suggestiuons and doubled the coffee and vanilla extract and also added one teaspon of baking powder and half cup of chopped walnuts, delish! I can't recommend this recipe enough try it you wont be disappointed! Elvira Silva.

Soooo Good!!!!! I had low expectations I admit - and boy was I surprised! Who knew something without flour could be so cake like in texture. And to see it rise that much - unexpected. I was a little worried as I used my Vitamix blender - it turned the batter to soup. I used coconut oil (dairy allergy) and added the baking powder as suggested. I can't do choc. chips or walnuts - so I added in hemp hearts! POT BROWNIES LOL! I just ate half the pan. Better save some for the family :)

Just made this and its so good we have eaten half the pan already.  I added 2 Tbls unsweetened flaked coconut, 2Tbls coconut oil, 1Tbls grapeseed oil, 1/3 cup of combined sipping chocolate & cocoa 1/2 cup erythritol (natural sweetener) 2packets Truvia and 1packet of Splenda.  Baked 30 minutes and put semi sweet choco chips on top as soon as it came out of the oven.  Cover for a few minutes with foil, then spread the chips when they melt.  it looked great and its between a cake and a brownie.  I added a dollop of whipped cream to mine, my mother had ice cream with her 2nd and 3rd piece.  We couldn't taste the black beans at all.
Next time I may add a bit more oil for a better brownie like texture and omit the coconut to see what its like as just chocolate. I hate baking, but this is the easiest baking I've ever done.  I'd give this more stars if I could. Bravo!

These brownies are a great way to get necessary fiber.  I thought they tasted very rich, almost like dark chocolate fudge.  I did not add any coffee and I increased the cocoa to 3/4 cup.  I added pecans.  I didn't taste the beans at all.  My husband was excited when I offered to make these brownies again because he felt full after eating them and he didn't gain any weight!  This is my new brownie recipe.  Thanks!!

The kids didn't even know it was beans!!!!  I didn't let it bake long enough, but it was still great and my husband told me to keep making them this way!  I did make a few changes.  I used a 1/2 cup applesause for the oil, 1 cup sugar, and a about a half a big bag of the milk choc chips.

I give this a  5 star rating for exactly what it is - a brownie recipe that is healthier, but still tastes great. I just made these last night, and they are wonderful. I could not tell they were made from black beans. The only substitution I made was 3/4 cup Egg Beaters in place of the eggs, and they turned out great. This is the perfect recipe to satisfy my chocolate cravings without wrecking my diet, and I will be making these regularly. Thanks for sharing!

I found this recipe a little bland. Next time I make it I plan on adding the chocolate chips into the batter instead of on top. Still, relatively good for a brownie, and amazing for something made with black beans.

I anticipated a chewier brownie so my husband and I were somewhat disappointed.  They also needed something more to give it a more "brownie" taste.  I did leave out the coffee because we don't have any and might try that the next time to help bring out the chocolate flavor as another reviewer suggested.  For a low calorie dessert, however, they were not that bad.  I don't know if I would call them brownies, maybe the name brought about some of the disappointment.

I used powdered Stevia and added about 1/4 cup extra cocoa powder. Buttermilk instead of oil. Delicious warm and cold. I will make these again and again and again.

This was OK but didn't go over well at a pitch-in where other brownies were present.  I made it again after modifying it so people don't expect it to taste like brownies.  A co-worker taste tested this new dessert and loved it.   Here are my modifications: replace the vanilla extract with 2 tsp almond extract or emulsion add 1 tsp baking powder add 1/4 chopped dried cherries add 1/4 cup chopped almonds top with slivered almonds I also used the applesauce substitution for oil that others suggested and used 1/4 cup sugar and 1/2 cup Splenda so it's diabetic diet friendly

Love this recipe. Can barely taste beans after cooking. I taste tested it to get it to my liking before I added eggs. Didn't do the coffee since I didn't have instant and didn't want to make a pot. I added brown sugar to adjust the flavor of the beans a little. Even my boyfriend who apparently isn't a big brownie fan LOVED these!  I used "no sugar added" applesauce instead of veg oil after getting the idea from another recipe. They ended up very soft and almost cake-like for me (probably from my adjustments and the applesauce) and were very good.

I am shocked that anyone was able to taste the black beans.  I didn't even taste a hint of them.  I didn't add the coffee.  Everything else was added just as the recipe directed and they turned out with the consistency of the center of a lava cake, but firmer, and held like a brownie.  My family seemed to like them.

These are awesome! I've always wanted to try this recipe and thank goodness I finally did. The texture is a little different due to the beans, but still great! I followed others' suggestions about more cocoa, vanilla, and adding baking powder. Highly recommended.

I was hoping that these would be better!  The consistency was good- I did not have instant coffee so I added about 1/2 shot of espresso and the chocolate chips.  Mine turned out very moist and gooey, BUT...the coffee and chocolate did not hide the bean taste at all.  It tasted like a fudgy bean dip.  I might try it one more time with some peanut butter and more chocolate chips added to it, as I think that flavor may hide the taste of beans a bit more.

These are good, but not my favorite (I prefer, apparently, to overindulge in the normal flour-based ooie-gooie ones). That said, I still like them. I made it with 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar and added a generous amount of cocoa. And I also added a larger can of beans, which didn't seem to affect them (19 oz can). I primarily made these for the kids and they've devoured them without noticing there being beans in it. Oh, and I did the chocolate chips in it. Pretty good. Five stars because my 2-year-old is prone to avoid anything healthy, so these are great! :D Thank you

I make this recipe every time I have a special occasion because most of my family is gluten intolerant.  I use soaked dried black beans whenever possible to cut down on the sodium level and always use dark chocolate chips for extra texture. I also add a little Baking Powder to give it a more cake-like texture.

I modified this with 1 1/2 teaspoons of baking powder and 1/2 cup of cocoa powder.  I also topped it off with a cream cheese and chocolate chip icing while hot which made a nice marbled finish.  I smelled the beans in the mixture but the final product fooled everyone!

Based on prior reviews, I added baking powder, added baking soda, used applesauce for oil, and used brown sugar for 1/2 cup of the white sugar.  I did Splenda for the other 1/4 cup of sugar and omitted the coffee because I didn't have it.  Skeptical hubby and I both liked these. All we tasted was chocolate. The batter smelled "beany", but the finished product didn't.

Um...these were BAD.  I like chewy brownies, these turned out VERY cake-like, kinda spongy vs gooey.  The flavor wasn't HORRIBlE, but, it definitely needed SOMETHING to kill some taste in it.  I REALLY wanted these to be good---i am going to try another recipe.

I found this because my dh had a least a million cans of black beans & I needed to use them :) I couldn't stand black beans.  This is Fantastic!  Made some changes to make healthier IMHO.  Substitute 1/2 C applesauce for the oil to reduce fat.  Used ener-g egg replacer to replace the eggs.  Used  Splenda (probably could use Stevia but haven't tried it) instead of sugar and used carob powder instead of chocolate and either carob chips or toffee or cinnamon chips to replace the chocolate chips (for someone allergic to chocolate).  If you blend them really well you'll never notice the beans.  I am a major chocolate fan but these are very, very good and great for vegetarians & vegans adjusted this way.  Also a great way to get your fiber!

Great recipe, I added 1 teaspoon baking soda.  Instead of the refined white sugar, I added 1/2 cup of raw honey.  I skipped the chocolate chips, but on my next recipe I will add 1 oz of melted dark chocolate into the mix just to punch up the chocolate flavor.  (When melting chocolate add 1 tablespoon of water to the chocolate)

For being gluten and dairy free, and for being made with beans, these were pretty good! I made them exactly as stated, leaving out the coffee because I didn't have any, and the chocolate chips. They have a very light, flaky and moist texture and are better refridgerated than warm from the oven.

Yummy!  This would be a great alternative to my traditional of adding a can of black beans to a box of Family Size brownie mix and cooking without adding any further ingredients, which is yummy as well but probably a little bit more fattening then this version...you probably could use the applesauce for the vegetable oil and egg whites for the eggs and splenda for the sugar and would really cut this one back and still taste great!!  Will be making this again :)

Made this recipe using only egg whites, the baking powder as suggested and added two ripe bananas and a little cinnamon to the food processor.  Didn't have any chocolate chips on hand so I chopped some baking chocolate.  Wow!!!! This was really good, no one could tell that black-beans were the main ingredient. Will definitely keep this one in the recipe collection.

My one year old son and I loved these, my 3 y/o daughter and husband wouldn't touch them.  Definately adjust the cocoa to 1/3c and the coffee to 2 tsp.

Yummy! Followed the recipe except I put in tiny candy coated chocolate pieces instead of the chips. The texture is light, unlike a traditional brownie, not 'fudgy' and dense, but not unpleasant at all. The outside crisped up just right. The addition of instant coffee lends a nice touch. Kids loved them; hubs didn't complain, but was suspicious :D I just appreciate the healthy addition of fibre without, to my mind, sacrificing much at all.  I'd much rather have these than a totally empty calorie but decadent fudge brownie! Incidentally, I could not taste the beans at all.

My son and I ate these while warm and he wanted more!.. I added peanut butter chips to them; they do have a slightly different texture but hey, there's no flour so what do you expect!.. Pretty darn tasty! :)

Taste good, but the texture is all wrong. But the kids ate it up. Good way to sneak the vegies in the kids w.o them knowing. Def will make again for them. I changed the oil for applesauce to make it healthier and added some walnuts. And my step daughter asked if I can make them again and put raspberries in them. No problem!!!!

I guess for a brownie recipe made with beans these are pretty good. But I did not like the texture that much. I preferred them cold with icing on top - so that kinda goes against making these a healthy treat.

These were so good, husband and daughter approved. I cut back on sugar a little and added some medjool dates. I think I like them better than traditional brownies, they don't make you feel crazed after eating them

The texture is grainy-beany. They were wet looking and not at all brownie like. I tried I really did. It was not good. Maybe I will take a different brownie recipe and add a bit of black bean ala Sneaky Chef. Maybe that will be better.

I forgot to add the salt.  I used 1 T of strong coffee instead of instant, and reduced the oil to 2 T instead of 3.    If I try really hard, I can taste the black bean flavor.  If I just eat it and think it's a brownie, it tastes like a moist, gooey brownie!  With the added benefit of protein and fiber! Awesome!

Awesome for a healthy brownie!!! Definitely takes care of a craving. Some adjustments I made: 1/2 cup vanilla yogurt in place of oil, 2/3 cup sugar, and 1/3 cup cocoa, extra vanilla extract, 3 tsps coffee, a few drops of mint extract, and powdered sugar on top. A very silky and moist brownie, but so much as to be a bit wet and doesn't hold together very well. I personally liked it that way, but next time I will try it with the baking powder to make it more dry and cake-like. The mint extract was a great addition. If you're like me and are health-conscious but tend eat half the pan, this is a good one to make at only 146 cals per 1/8 pan and lots of protein and fiber.

When I first bit into these brownies I did NOT like them, but they did grow on me. They aren't very good warm - they taste too much like beans. But after they've set overnight they aren't too bad. If you know the beans are in there you can taste them but I could ignore it and still enjoy them. Also, if you're one of those people who doesn't like weird textures, they are not for you. But, if you're looking for a healthy, homemade, brownie alternative and you're willing to sacrifice just a bit, these are for you.

The brownies were very good.  The texture is a big different then a regular brownie.  The taste was good and you would never know that black beans were the main ingredient.

Thank you for a gluten-free recipe for brownies that doesn't call for an expensive assortment of exotic flours.  Sure its not like traditional brownies in texture, but putting that aside, these brownies are so rich and chocolatey...  And the added fiber and protein are a bonus.  I've made it several times and I've done what other people have suggested such as adding  baking powder and walnuts.  I whip the whole thing up in my food processor and  make sure to puree the beans real good first before I add everything else.  This recipe never fails to impress me, its like a chocolate miracle.

I'm a professional baker and I must say that this came out very good, I definitely will make them again, although they have a dense texture, they tasted good (no bean flavor at all), and they are healthy. I just loved them, thanks!

I've made them several times and haven't written a review yet.  YUM!  No one would know they had black beans in them.  Moist and just like brownies.  EASY to make in my blender and I used silicone petite bundt cake style baking pans.  Dipped them in melted semi sweet chocolate to gussy them up and oh my goodness!  Great homemade holiday gifts for friends and family ahead! Perfect for the gluten free, dairy free and allergy sensitive group of friends.  Will be making about 100 more...better get busy!

I absolutely can't get over the fact that I just made brownies out of black beans and LOVED them!  I did use the suggestion of other reviewers and added a tsp of baking powder and just couldn't be more pleased.  Thanks so much for sharing a great way to sneak in some healthy!

Delicious way to eat healthier brownies!  I didn't taste the beans at all.  My husband didn't even notice they weren't regular brownies.  Next time I'll reduce their sugar to 1/2 a cup because they tasted very sweet to me.  I did use applesauce instead of oil per my usual in recipes.  Thanks for the recipe!

I tried it without the chocolate chips or the instant coffee, and I absolutely love them! Not only are they easier to make than traditional brownies, but the texture is smooth, and they are delicious! I think when I make them again, I'll make them with either a little more cocoa powder or with the chocolate chips on the top. I am most definitely planning on making these again!

These are a great healthier alternative to regular brownies. After reading a few reviews I made a couple of adjustments. I used 1/8 cup regular cocoa and 1/8 cup dark cocoa and instead of coffee I added about 1 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper and just a small handful of dark chocolate chips. AMAZING! I was thoroughly surprised at how much I like these considering I am NOT a bean eater.

Easy and delicious! GREAT alternative for those with a wheat/gluten allergy. I have also used Garbanzo beans using brown sugar,leaving out the cocoa powder and used butterscotch chips instead of chocolate chips. Also, used dark red kidney beans and put in some cherries and cherry juice left out the coffee and chocolate chips. Topped with Sugar Free cool whip..... YUM!

The best black bean brownies I've ever had!  I've tried several recipes with baking soda and it made the brownie very cake-like.  My husband and I love brownies- ok, we love boxed brownies (brownie mixes): Ghiradelli and Betty Crocker top the list.  Five stars for a healthier alternative.  They can't compare to the boxed variety, but it's not fair to compare a healthier version to an unhealthy one.  These black bean brownies don't have that dense-fudgy flavor, but then again they don't have a long list of artificial ingredients that you'd never find in your pantry either. To help mask the bean flavor, we added two tablespoons of creamy peanut butter and the 1/2 cup of chocolate chips to the blender (to make sure we got a taste of real chocolate in every bite).  We didn't add the instant coffee, because we didn't have it.  The verdict: My three-year olds gobbled them up quickly.  My husband knew something was amiss, but he said they were good.  We'll definitely make them again as a healthier alternative to brownies.  The next time, I'll add more peanut butter and some chopped walnuts.  Thank you Elizabeth for a yummy recipe.

My first attempt at Gluten free baking and I must say these are GOOD! After reading other reviews I did add extra cocoa powder, a dash of baking powder and omitted the coffee but did sprinkle the top with chocolate chips.  Once they were cooked and cooled I put them directly in the fridge for a few hours before cutting them.  The texture and taste was a bit different but nobody I served them to guessed there were black beans in the recipe. Next time I need a gluten free dessert I would definitely try this again...very easy to make which is a bonus.

The other reviews were so good, I had to try these!   The texture alone proves that these aren't your normal, everyday brownies...like stiff mashed potatoes.  Taste would be very bland if it weren't for the chocolate chips on top.  Go for the real thing!!

I have Celiac and  I was expecting a delicious dessert and although the taste was good, the texture was inedible.

A good alternative to regular brownies.  I added extra cocoa, espresso powder, and chopped bittersweet chocolate (both in the batter and sprinkled on top).  I also took the brownies out a few minutes early, but will probably leave them in the full time, next time around.

I made these out of curiosity after a friend mentioned that she had tried black bean brownies. They're delicious, and have gotten great reviews from several friends. I would recommend blending them, as I tried using a mixer for the first batch, and was left with a "beanier" consistency. When properly blended, there is no bean taste. I will definitely be making them again!

I came across this recipe when looking for a recipe to use up cans or beans in the pantry.  I saw it and immediately said "yuck!" and moved onto more mexican recipes and rice and bean recipes.

The next day I was surfing the web for ideas to use up my overstock of cans of beans and I came across a blog with someone raving about how good brownies made with black beans were.  I thought it couldn't possibly be true, but I had everything in the house to do it, and wouldn't be too crushed if I wasted a can of beans, so I decided to make them.  

I read the other reviews and did add about 1/4 tsp of baking powder, and we don't drink coffee in our family so I didn't use any, and I increased the chocolate chips since I had about 1 cup that I needs to use up from the pantry.

Holy cow, I couldn't believe it but these are AWESOME!  I'm thinking that you could use way more than just chocolate chips on top.  Andes candies chips, heath chips, nuts, caramel, pretty much anything would be good on these brownies.  Seriously, try them, I really can't believe it!

Maybe it was the brand of black bean I used (El Ebro), maybe not..this recipe was not for me. I went ahead and added baking powder as another reviewer on here suggested and it did come out cakey-er which I liked. I just didn't like the beans in there. I will definitely try this recipe again, next time I think I will crush the beans up or put them into a blender. It was a texture thing for me. I will make sure to post up when I try them out again. Great tips on here guys! Very helpful.

I made these with high expectations... the results we so-so.  They looked great and had a great fudgy texture but I just couldn't get past the beans.  The batter tasted like beans, they smelled like beans while they where baking and the end result had an unmistakable bean-y taste.  I probably won't make these again.  To be fair I am pregnant so my sense of smell/taste is probably much sharper than usual.  Someone else might not taste the beans at all.

Not your typical brownie.  With that being said, they weren't bad at all, just not a texture I'm used to.  I did opt to use the instant coffee and milk chocolate chips.  Mine baked right at the 30 minute mark.  I took these to work and they enjoyed them.  They cut very nicely with a plastic knife and made for a great presentation.

This is an amazing recipe!  Tastes very good, and they get even better the second day.  

I added a half teaspoon of baking powder to give them a bit more cakey feeling.  I will stir the chocolate chips into the batter next time as the top of the brownies are "gooey."  At 126 calories per piece, you really can "have your cake and eat it, too!"

Made these last night - followed the recipe except I used a small amount of liquid coffee and not instant coffee. The three 12 year old boys in my house LOVED them and asked for 2nds. Granted, brownies aren't a "hard sell" but they couldn't taste anything "not normal" let alone the beans.  Highly recommend!!

SENSATIONAL, as i have problems with caffeine used carob powder and decaf coffee. Apple sauce instead of oil and brown sugar instead of white, didn't bother with the chips. So Moist, delicious and rich. The coffee is a must. Served warm with vanilla ice cream, WOW!! Thanks for posting Elizabeth.

My husband and I are adopting a healthier lifestyle and these were perfect - with a few modifications.  I used the basic recipe from Happy Herbivore:     15 ounces black beans, drained and rinsed,   2 whole bananas, 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa, 2 tlbs. ground coffee, 1 tlbs of cinnamon, 1/2 cup dark chocolate chips, 2 tsps vanilla, 1/2 c applesauce - (taste here to see if it is sweet enough - I did not add sugar) - 1/2 cup instant oatmeal - everything else is the same - fabulous and VERY HEALTHY.

    ¼ cup unsweetened cocoa
    1 tbsp cinnamon
    1 tsp vanilla extract
    ¼ cup raw sugar (optional)
    ¼ cup instant oats

Just the healthy chocolate fix we were hoping for.  I soaked my own black beans for lower sodium, used applesauce in place of the oil, doubled the vanilla and baking cocoa, omitted the coffee, added 1/2 t. baking powder and used egg substitute.  In spite of all those changes, it was fabulous, just took about 10 additional minutes to set up while baking.  Will definitely be using again!

These taste like those flourless cakes, not bad at all, the eggs definitely help the recipe.  i made the mistake of flipping the pan over when they were still warm so i ended up with a mess but they tasted good.

I served these to my very picky 8 year old son and he LOVED them and even had thirds.  No one believed me when I told them they were made with black beans and no flour.  Definately a staple in my family cookbook.

I did what others recommended and did 1/2 cp of cocoa powder, added a little more coffee and a pinch of baking powder. I also threw some if the chocolate chips in the blender to chop up in the mixture.  These were great!

Great! don't taste the beans. I also added about 1tsp baking powder and upped the cocoa and coffee just a bit for flavor. Topped with dried cranberries and pecans. 
Note: waiting till they cool to cut/serve is helpful because otherwise they are very gooey and stick to the pan/scooper.

Awesome with other reviewer suggestions (1/2 tsp baking powder, a little extra cocoa powder, espresso powder and a sugar and honey combo.) Left out chocolate chips as our dinner guest was lactose intolerant...but these would be great. Also swirled in all-natural crunchy peanut butter. This is a must!

Good recipe for a flourless dessert! I don't believe other reviewers that say these taste like chocolate refried beans. I served them to my guests and nobody knew there were black beans in them. I did add extra cocoa powder and stirred the chocolate chips through the batter. I will definitely make them again.

I love them. They are the best brownies. I wanted to use applesauce instead of the oil but was a little scared because I have never done that. But I will try the applesauce next time.

I was looking forward to some healthy brownies, but these are absolutely the WORST thing I've ever baked - and I bake alot! My husband, who will eat anything I put in front of him, couldn't even finish one.  Sorry - 0 stars.

This is a really good recipe for a lighter brownie. I gave it 4 since its not chewy. But its still yummy. Even my boyfriend was surprised it had black beans in it.

After reading many reviews, I opted to add 1 tsp baking powder, substitute 1 tsp stevia + 1/4c brown sugar for the sugar, and skip the chocolate chips (although I may add them next time.) Family loved them and had NO idea about the beans! Perfect healthy sweet tooth fix!

I used dry beans to avoid the "bean flavor" that others had complained about, and everything was lloking great and smelling awesome. I took 1 bite and literally could not force myself to swallow. The texture is terrible and the flavor was not chocolatey enough to fool me into telling myself it was fudge. If I try again I will have to up the chocolate, cocoa powder and I honestly don't know what else to save this one?

I thought these were ok.  They definitely weren't the best brownies I'd ever had.  I added some baking powder like some reviewers suggested.  I think if I made them again I wouldn't do this.  They made the brownies too cake like.  I also added extra cocoa and vanilla and I couldn't taste the beans at all.  This was the first gluten recipe I've ever made though so maybe it takes some getting used to.

this was a great recipe, FAR tastier than the rocco dispirito version which was dry and quite tasteless.
i will definitely make this brownie again! .
oh yes, and like the other reviewer, i added 1tsp of 
baking powder which made the texture more brownie like.
yummers!

Wow...  I absolutely love the ease of this recipe.. not to mention the amazing taste!  I used Hershey's Milk Chocolate Chips and sprinkled chopped walnuts on top (which was the only change I made!).  I do have a tip - the texture and taste  is 100% BETTER when completely cooled.  I was not too impressed when first tasting them fresh out of the oven.  Sneaking a bite the next morning with coffee.... heaven.  A+!

Just made these tonight.  Followed recipe, but added 1 tsp. baking soda.  My GF diet husband LOVED them.  Even better, my picky kids gobbled them up without knowing they were eating beans (they despise them)!

These were surprisingly delicious!  Following other reviews, I only used 2 eggs, increased vanilla, added a few drops almond extract, omitted coffee, and added 1/2 tsp each of baking powder and soda.  I whirred everything together in my food processor, and stirred in about 3 tbsp mini cholocolate chips by hand.  Baked for 30 mins in a glass pan and these were perfect!  My husband had no idea what the "secret ingredient" was.  If you are looking for a healthier brownie recipe def give this a try!

Great!  I made some minor changes - increasing the cocoa by 1 Tbsp, the coffee by 1/2 tsp, added 1 tsp baking powder, decreased the oil by 1/2 Tbsp, and used 1/4 cup each of brown and white sugar.  I was really happy with the results and didn't notice any sort of bean taste.  The texture is a little different than flour-based brownies, but since these don't contain flour, that's no surprise.  My family and I really enjoyed these and I will definitely make them again.  Thanks, Elizabeth!

I thought these were fantastic!  I taste a hint of bean (starch is probably more accurate), but I expected that.  They are guiltless, filling, slightly sweet, and chocolatey enough for those need-something-sweet-now moments.   I soaked 2/3c dry beans overnight and boiled until tender with water and 1/2tsp instant coffee.  I also subbed flax for 1 of the eggs because I didn't have enough.  I added 1/2 cup mini semi sweet chocolate chips and topped the brownies off with coconut prior to baking.

Unfortunately the claim that these "do not taste beanie" is incorrect.  They are plenty chocolatey, and we ate about half of them - but it took us a week, because while they look good, they just do not satisfy a brownie craving.  The texture is fine I guess, but in your mouth - they taste like someone put beans in your brownies.  It is just not right.

these were better the next day after they had cooled. I added in a tsp of baking powder but i don't think it made them any better. Choc chips are a must.

I tried this recipe for my mother who eats gluten free and it was a big hit. Even my 3 and 4 year old daughters who are very picky eaters loved it. First batch I made exactly by this recipe and in my opinion they came out much more fudge-like than brownie-like. On the recommendation of another user I tried adding 1 tsp of baking powder and they came out much more "cakey" and more like traditional brownies. Great topped with chopped walnuts and or chocolate chips (as in the picture I submitted. Will definitely be making these again.

WOW!  Amazing!  I did add one teaspoon of baking powder, to ensure the brownies would rise.  Also, I used a food processor to ensure the beans were really "mashed".  
These were dense brownies, which I prefer to "cakey" brownies.  We could not taste the beans at all.  Just chocolaty goodness!

Without knowing the ingredients, my 9 yr old son had five of the brownies, my 7 yr old son had 2. Excellent. Fudgey texture. I heeded others advice and added a bit more cocoa and coffee to be sure I masked the black bean flavor. It's a keeper!

I just made these.  They are fantastic!  I followed the recipe as is.  Next time I think I might try replacing some of the egg with egg white, and maybe cut back on the sugar and oil to make them even more healthier.

I've read about black bean brownies and was a bit apprehensive about eating them.  The taste surprised me and I will continue to make my brownies using black beans from this day forward.  I will test out some modifications such as reduced sodium black beans and splenda with this recipe to see if I can make it more waistline friendly.

i made this with some changes as other readers suggested. i didnt have vanilla or chocolate chips but used extra cocoa powder, subed brown sugar for white sugar, and used dark coffee instead of instant. everyone from my 2 year old nephew to my husband loved these. not a hint of beans! not overly sweet, which is fine with me, but next time i think i will add nuts and a handful of chocolate chips.

I was intrigued by this recipe so I just decided to try it out! I had a can of dark red kidney beans so I used that instead of black beans - added the baking powder like the reviews... Just took a bite and they're quite good!!! A recipe I would recommend for sure - for gluten free.

Whoa.  This is just a recipe to make black beans taste sweeter.  My kids took one whiff of this dish (before I told them what was in it) and both said, "This smells like CHILI!"  Sure enough...it did...it didn't even smell like brownies.  I am not sure how the other reviewers made this, but I suspect that they didn't use black beans.  
Thumbs down.  :(

I would never know these were made with black beans and no flour!!!  Very good!  I've made them a couple of times now, once with mint extract, which was quite tasty as well.

I like the idea of healthy dessert. The texture is fudgy. I tasted right out of the oven and could taste the beans. I let them sit and firm up in the fridge overnight and what a difference! fudgey and yummy. The chocolate chips are a must.

Ok, I've made these 4 times now, and I've finally come to the conclusion that they're just not worth it. Yes, they are much healthier than real brownies, but they just don't taste very good. I eat quite healthy, but I'd really rather have 1 amazing, full-fat, white flour, real brownie than 5 of these strange brownies. I did try different variations of the recipe to see if I could make them amazing and I couldn't - and I LOVE beans! So I've decided that I'm going to abandon the bean brownie possibility and go for the real thing once in a while. However, I'll give it 3 stars for the concept.

They came out incredible.  I blended everything very smooth and my kids did not even know there were beans in them.  I did not have cocoa powder at home so I took the half cup chocolate chips and blended them in too.  Who needs flour:)

These are um different...I for some reason had high hopes for these cause it was different and like nothing ive made before. I wish i could give a better rating but i could taste the beans and it wasnt very pleasent. no one in the house liked them very much. i made it as is first so i could have a review on the unaltered recipe, then the second time i made them i added more vanilla and chocolate. It didnt help. I also left in the oven longer cause they never seemed to get done. I wont make these again. :(

For something so healthy, they turned out fantastic!  I love then and couldn't taste the black beans at all.  I substituted to the oil for 1/2 cup applesauce.  I had to cook for an extra 15 min and the texture was a little funny - more of a mousse than a brownie.  If you don't mind that then they're great (maybe not as decadent as really fudge brownies but that's only to be expected)

Very good!  I blended these WELL in a Vitamix, which I think is key to a very smooth texture.  I added 4 T. of oil in hopes it would be moisture and less cake-like, 1 1/2 t. vanilla and 1 t. of almond extract, doubled the instant coffee and added some baking powder.  I honestly cannot taste the black beans at all.

I like beans and I like brownies, but not together. I followed the directions, but it tastes like sweet black beans.

I just made these and they taste fairly good.  I didn't add instant coffee, but it still had a coffee/ bean taste.  I will add coffee next time so that it will mask the taste better.  It was very easy to put together in the blender.  It wasn't the same texture as brownies but they were definitely edible.

Oh my gosh I did not care for this cake at all.  The bean taste was incredibly obvious and the consistency was not pleasant.  I could not even finish one whole piece.  I was very excited to make it and then so disappointed with the results.

Interesting texture, probably from the eggs? I didn't add the baking powder the first time, but will next time I make them. Don't expect these to have the texture of brownies as written, it just isn't the same.  We couldn't taste any of the black beans. Make sure to get a can of black beans with NO SALT OR SPICES.   I will make these again. They are good for what they are. I will try with the baking powder next time. Also, may try with the applesauce to replace oil. I did use egg white replacement instead of the eggs, but that's the only change I made this first time.

wow! I was impressed! I used baking powder and extra cocoa and vanilla. And it came out like I didn't even add black beans!!! I couldn't taste them at all! The texture was a little different though. It had more of a spongy texture like a mousse cake or something. I'm giving them to my husband to see what he thinks (fyi- a brownie freak!) and i'm NOT telling him what it is made out of!! :) enjoy!

I was scared to try this but so glad I did! No, you do not taste the beans! I used my magic bullet to blend the ingredients. Next time I will substitute egg beaters instead of eggs and splenda instead of regular sugar. I think the texture is a little grainy and not very creamy but nuts would definitely help. Not sure if there is something low calorie to make it creamier. Thanks for the recipe! Using this one again and again.

I thought this recipe was just ok. I loved the idea and thought it very creative. The brownies were definitly better than I thought they would be, but as another person said they needed something more. The texture was also a little strange. I think next time I may try to mix the chocolate chips into the mix so you don't notice the texture as much.

I was really surprised at how great these brownies were.  I added an extra tsp. of instant coffee and upped the cocoa powder to 1/3 c, just because I was afraid that I would be able to taste the beans.  You could not taste them what-so-ever!  I will be making these again for sure!  I might even try cutting the sugar a little, just to save some extra calories.. They were plenty sweet enough with the full 3/4 c  :~)

If I could give this negative stars I would. I saw all the great reviews and thought, maybe it could be good, but it was just like you would imagine. Black beans in brownies. My mom said that she would rather NEVER EAT ANOTHER BROWNIE than eat another one of these! You could taste the black beans.

Wow! These are SO yummy. I didn't taste black beans at all. I did add the coffee and chocolate chips, and subbed apple sauce for oil. I didn't add the baking powder but I think I will try it next time because the consistency is a little gooey and they fall apart when I take them out of the pan. But my 2 1/2 yr old doesn't mind, he just says, more brownies please!

Wow! Who would have thought? This recipe is fantastic. My kids love these brownies. I added 2 tsp of baking powder and on the top I tossed on some almond slices, white chocolate chips and some dark chocolate chips. Baked 5 minutes longer then in recipe.

I love this recipe because it is pretty healthy, tastes nice and chocolately, and I can feel better about giving it to my kids (and eating it myself!)  It does not have the texture of a regular brownie, of course, but it is definitely a keeper for me!  Thanks for sharing!

These were great! Even my sister in law who despises beans ate some!  (that is before i told her they were made of beans yet she still ate some!) I added a lil more coco powder, sugar, and vanilla just because i wanted to and added 1.5 tsp of baking powder to make it cakey and it was delicious!

I absolutely LOVE these!  I use them as a quick 'to-go' breakfast (which is hard to come by for those who are GF) as well occasional dessert or snack.  My co-worker hopes I have 2 in my bag every morining.  I did add baking powder.  Also, I used instant coffe that had french vanilla flavoring (all I had) and omitted the vanilla.  Think it really added something.  I think I'll try with hazelnut next time.    These are new staple in our house.

I LOVE these brownies! But I am watching the glycemic load of foods (how fast foods convert to sugar in the blood) so instead of the milk chocolate I would suggest dark chips and a natural sweetner like xylitol for the white sugar!

These brownies looked great and smelled good too. But believe me looks can be very deceiving! They were not to my liking. My daughter will eat anything but she did not care for these. My son tried them and also disliked them. He said it had the consistency of toothpaste and baking soda. The only reason I gave it one star is because there wasn't a choice for zero stars!

The flavor of the brownie is good, but you can definately tell the beans are there because of the texture. I was hoping to get my kids to eat these. My 4 year old took one bite and said no thanks. Oh well....worth a try. Not a terrible brownie considering the amount of beans in it. It will be interesting to hear my husbands opinion.

These were so moist, yummy and good, I'll never make any other brownie.  I am very particular about my brownies, too.  One of the reviewers said not to use Special Dark cocoa, but that's what I had, so I used it anyway.  It made for a great dark chocolate brownie.  I was careful not to use more that the specified 1/4 cup, though.  I also added 1 t. baking powder.  I was afraid it would make the results too cake-like, but it turned out perfect.

Sensational! I made these for a gluten free workshop I taught over the summer. I had people from other areas of the workshop coming in to sneak tastes. Nobody believed they were gluten free...and pretty healthy for a dessert!!! I work in a nutrition clinic and all the dietitians here are begging for the recipe.  Excellent! This is really good warm with a scoop of ice cream. I also recommend adding either dark or milk chocolate chips...it makes them feel more like brownies.

I made this without the chocolate chips to cut down on the calories. Satisfied my craving for chocolate! These are better when they have cooled, and even yummier the second day.

My daughter and I really enjoyed this. She was able to help me make it (she is two) and she really enjoyed eating it as well. It makes me feel good knowing I got a little fiber in her today.

These are fantastic!!  I made the recipe as is, only adding 1 tsp baking powder.  Puree well and you won't even tell they are beans.  I've made several pans and they all disappear quickly.  Try this recipe - it is VERY good and VERY easy.

I thought these were wonderful!  True, the texture is not the same as a typical brownie, but it wasn't a bad texture, just different.  The taste was spot on!  My 2 and 4yr old gobbled them up and I didn't feel guilt about feeding them brownies!

I was REALLY disappointed with this recipe!!! My family was saying that black bean brownies are the best. So I made this recipe and they totally didn't like it. The brownies had this really weird texture and a weird after taste and worst of all you could totally tell that there were black beans in there. Sorry about the bad review but I will never try this again!! :(

this is good every time! my kids are on a gluten and dairy free diet so these are perfect for a "treat" in their lunch box. it holds together very well.  I've never used the coffee but peanut butter frosting is a great addition. I also sprinkle a few chocolate chips on after they come out of the oven, they melt right in.  My husband makes these into a "power bar" he replaces the sugar with agave and adds flax, cacao instead of coco and nuts or dried fruit. very different flavor but good if you want something packed with nutrition.

I added baking powder as suggested by other reviewers to give a little more rise to these.  I don't think they were really exceptional or terrible, just a good little something to try that isn't loaded with fat and sugar (two thumbs up on that!).  I did not add any chocolate chips, but think that will make them more chocolately, or even the addition of some nice fluffy frosting.  The texture is a little off compared to regular, which is expected, and I didn't really taste black beans, just not as sweet or as much chocolate flavor as I'm used to in a brownie (I did add the coffee granules to bring out the flavor).  I will make them again for sure with some tweaks.

I give this 2 stars as a brownie, 4 stars as a black bean brownie.  The taste is good, the texture is odd.  I would add more oil.  I almost wonder if the people who can taste the black beans used canned beans that may have had some flavoring or spices in them.  I used rehydrated dry beans, and I can't taste any bean flavor at all.  You can substitute maltitol for the sugar to make these glycemic-friendly also.  I think this is a great recipe for celiacs, dieters, or diabetics, but if you aren't used to those kind of diets, you may find this recipe odd.

These were so easy to whip together!  The only changes I made were to increase the cocoa to 1/3C and add 1 tsp of baking powder, use mini chocolate chips and put 1/4C in the batter and sprinkle the other 1/4C on top.  Definitely use the coffee...it really complements the chocolate flavor well.  I will definitely make these again!

After making these brownies, I am surprised at all the gushing, positive reviews.  These may be good for being gluten/dairy free but they are by no means good in general.

For some reason I really had it in my mind that I wouldn't taste too much bean flavor in this. I was wrong. Having said that, for bean-flavored brownies, these are pretty dang good. Very deep chocolate flavor. I think they would have been even better with the instant coffee (which I didn't have). I did fold in some chopped walnuts before baking. Thanks :)

These were more cake-like, but even more spongy.  I like chewy, dense brownies.  The taste didn't bother me so much as the texture.

There was too strong a flavor of black bean, a slight coffee taste, and they crumpled up so they looked gross after we froze them.

Great for celiacs, but also nice for those of us who are trying to find ways to get enough protein in our diets. I used semi-sweet chocolate chips and skipped the coffee, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly, and these tasted like good brownies. I did keep them in the fridge, since I'm afraid the bean flavor might come out if these are left on the counter for too long.

UNBELIEVABLE!  What a treat!  I was trying to get rid of some extra milk chocolate chips when I came across this recipe.  I'm always on the lookout for good flour-less recipes, so I was excited to give this a try.  My family could not believe these were made out of black beans!  We could not taste them at all.  Thanks for the fabulous recipe.

I deceived my Bible study group by letting everyone eat the brownies before announcing what it was they were eating. ;)  They had noticed a slightly different texture and, to a lesser extent, taste, but had no idea it would be beans that made the difference!  Surprisingly good, though not quite comparable to the classic brownie.

Thank you to elizabeth for posting this recipe way back when - they are SO VERY good, and I have been enthusiastically remaking these for several years.  To the skeptics - these do not "taste like beans".  I have made only these changes -  NOT because the original recipe was lacking, but primarily because we do love chocolate and coffee.  I use 1/3 cup cocoa powder instead of 1/4 cup and 3 teaspoons (sometimes more) instant coffee instead of 1 teaspoon. I also fine-shred about 1/3 of a carrot into the mix (no discernible taste) as carrots are pretty awesome for cutting the tendency for beans to cause gas. (Many years of  successfully using shredded carrots in pretty much ANY recipe containing beans.)  There is a jar of instant coffee in the cupboard kept exclusively for these brownies.   The bonus is that these are gluten-free.

It tastes very good. I used apple sauce to replace oil to lower fat content. My husband did not like them.  He said the chew of a brownie wasn't there.  I however, had to freeze brownies so as to not eat all at once.

YUM! These turned out delicious! I have a sweet almost every night and wanted to try out a healthy recipe and these were just amazing. I did not include coffee in mine. They stay moist as opposed to drying out like some brownies. I do not even taste the beans. They have a pretty rich flavor. Definitely going to make these again.

I'll never make boxed brownies again. These were great. However I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil. Also, these are more the consistency of cake brownies, I prefer chewy. So I added chopped pecans to give me something to chew on ??
Everyone is asking me for this recipe, thank you!

Doubled the cocoa powder, and used brown sugar (packed) because that's what i had. Loved it! Then mom suggested an extra egg because she wanted a more cake-like brownie and that turned out really good as well. Even the time I had to use chia seeds in lieu of eggs it worked very nice.

This is a good base recipe and it can be changed a bit to suit your needs.  FIrst, as suggested a 1/2 tsp of baking powder does help the brownies not become too dense.  Secondly, the vegetable oil could be substituted with a nut butter like peanut or almond butter (coconut oil worked too).  Adds a bit more character. 

And last but not least,  make sure you completely blitz the black beans until there isn't any remanence of the skins (recommend a blender actually)--when this is done, the rest of the ingredients will mix much readily and you won't end up with sweet and bitter areas like I did the first couple of times.

The original black bean brownie and still the best! I use about 1/2 c cocoa and 1/2 c sugar (or 1/4 c sugar + 1/4 c maple syrup), more chocolately and less sweet.

I don't have any dietary restrictions that led me to this recipe.  I just had an abundance of black beans that was trying to get rid of - and who wouldn't want a healthier dessert option anyway? 

I have to say, I like this far more than I thought I would.  The only change I made was to add a teaspoon of baking powder like others suggested. It came out with a sort of denser sponge cake consistency which I was impressed with.  My only critique is that it was a tad on the bland side.  Adding chocolate chips to the top fixed it well enough for me, and I suspect icing would be good as well.  I plan to make this again, but I'll try to add a bit more chocolate flavor to the batter.  Overall, I would make this again if I wanted a healthier dessert, but if I wanted to impress someone, is go with the full fat, fudgy brownies :). Thanks for the recipe!

I love this recipe!!! I use dark cocoa mostly and exchange regular sugar for coconut sugar. I also have need used coffee. I feel like im cheating! My kids luv them and I am happy to have something that won't make me sick from grains or to much sugar!! Thanks be to Elizabeth for posting this. 2 years ago I would have never dreamed going grain free would be possible for me. Recipes like this make it sooo much easier.  Baking these right now. 

*Maybe the person that didn't like the batch they made with the dark cocoa probably would like it better if they cut back the cocoa to 1/8 of a cup instead of 1/4 cup. And maybe refrigerate it over night to let the flavors sink in.

I made this just the way it is listed. I thought they were perfect. Served them to my kids and just told them they were homemade brownies. No complaints. I rinsed the beans well before using them and couldn't taste them at all.

Sorry, but there was no hiding the bean taste or texture and they were soft and mushy.

Great recipe! These didn't taste like beans AT ALL, which I was worried about based on other reviews. It could be because I added extra cocoa powder for a deeper chocolate flavor. These were the changes I made: 

- 4 TBSP fresh coffee (didn't have instant coffee powder)
- Extra 2 TBSP cocoa powder (to balance out extra moisture from coffee)
- 1 tsp baking powder (to improve texture, per suggestions in other reviews)
- No vanilla, because I didn't have any :(

The result was a brownie with a rich, deep chocolate flavor. The texture is different than a normal brownie, but that is to be expected. I used a food processor to blend my ingredients and there were no lumps in the final product. 

Overall, tasty final product. It doesn't compare to a real brownie, but if you think of it as a separate dessert, it's pretty good.

This recipe is great! You have to try it. Nothing will ever replace a true brownie but this was pretty close. I am a baker and I did make changes to mask the flavor a bit just based on my experience. I increased coffee & vanilla to 1 tbs each & used coconut oil in place of veg oil. No one knew they were beans.

Perfect for Celiac's,they were delish and naturally gluten free, I left out the instant coffee and used dark cocoa powder and didn't tell anyone what they were until they tasted them, they were a huge hit!

Interesting recipe, the texture of these brownies were great, soft and moist, would never think that there were black beans in it. I would have liked it to have more of a chocolate flavor, which I thought was still lacking in spite of adding a bit more than 1/2 cup of cocoa powder and the 1/2 cup of chocolate chips.  My other changes were almost a cup of sugar, 1/2 tsp of baking soda, 2 ripe bananas (which I think rather enhanced the flavor) and a Tbsp of coffee.   Will try it again.  - Poonam.

Wow of course it's a different texture and slightly different flavor; the texture is the biggest difference from regular brownies. But after finally trying the black bean brownies I am very impressed! Tastes great and yay that there's no butter and not so much sugar. This recipe could really replace regular brownies for me.

These were awesome. I thought the batter was a little bit thin so I added 1/3 cup of gluten free oat bran. They're so chocolatey and you can't even tell they have beans in them.

I made this exactly as the recipes says. I loved these. I like the fact there is no flour in it.
Next time I will try using apple sauce instead of the oil as one reviewer suggested.

BAD aftertaste.  They look like brownies but even if you can get past the strange texture and convince yourself you can't taste the beans, they really stick with you in a bad way.  I love brownies and I substitute healthier ingredients in them all the time, but won't use beans again...!

This review is for people who are on the fence about making these.

*For black bean brownies* these were very good. I used 1/3 c cocoa powder instead of 1/4, applesauce instead of oil (as I do in all of my brownie recipes), 2 eggs instead of 3 (actually, egg substitute) for a less cake-y brownie, and omitted the coffee and chocolate chips - resulting in a fat-free brownie. I served them to my boyfriend and he thought they were very rich and chocolateyy...then I told them the secret ingredient. After that, he said he could identify the black bean taste (which is true, I could taste it too, but it was very faint) and no longer wanted to eat them. HAH, more fat-free brownies for meeee!!

Overall, very fudge-y, chocolate-y, not-quite-real-tasting brownie. Delicious if you're looking to limit wheat or fat and have a fiber-filled "healthy" brownie. Otherwise, stick to a regular brownie recipe :)

Made this for my husband.  He LOVED it.  I did substitute Splenda for the sugar and followed the suggestion to add baking powder and baking soda.  The brownies turned out great.  Will make this on a regular basis.

HOLY COW THESE ARE AWESOME!! I've tricked my kids, my husband, my parents, my friends.  OK I've tricked everyone I know and they LOVE THEM!! I'll definitely be making these regularly.  The only substitution was greek yogurt for the oil and they were still very moist (almost like fudge).  Highly recommend!

Sometimes I use banana and applesauce in this as well. Egg whites too. I find that I can alter it and it still tastes great as long as I add the chocolate chips (I use semi-sweet). Very versatile recipe

OMG this is so good! My new go to brownie recipe. I did follow the reviews and added more cocoa powder (half cup) and more sugar by adding extra quarter cup.  Used coconut oil as well. They are devine. Thanks for a wonderful moist recipe.

I add 1 teaspoon of baking powder to give it a more cakey texture. I also recommend REALLY blending it well - you can end up with a grainy texture otherwise. Also I top with cocoa nibs, it adds a nuttiness to it as well as antioxidants!

This recipe is quick, simple, moist AND delicious!  I used 3 tbsp of coconut oil and added 1/2 c of both coconut and walnuts to the batter. I also cut the sugar to 1/4 cup with NO discernible difference in taste!  Served this as a birthday "cake" to three others who had no idea that there wasn't a speck of flour in the recipe.  For gluten/wheat-free diets, this is an absolutely wonderful option!!

When my children saw me making these, they were whining and complaining (I guess the ingredients didn't appeal to them).  But, once they tasted them, the pan was gone in no time! They love them! It is now a regular recipe we make.  I add one more egg to it to add extra protein.  I whipped up some whipping cream and served it on top, which made for a delicious topping.

I didn't have any vegetable oil so I replaced it with 1/3 cup melted coconut oil.  it pairs really well with the chocolate.  I took these on a family camping trip and no one guessed that they were made with black beans.  The toddlers loved them and so did the teenagers!  This is one brownie you won't feel guilty having a second one!

I will make these again, definitely a different texture than brownies made with flour, i did add an extra quarter cup of chocolate chips because more chocolate is always better. This recipe is a real plus for anyone who is on a glutten free diet. 
Overall i like this recipe a lot,i think it should be stored in the fridge since it containes beans and beans should stay cold.

These were so good! Didn't taste the beans at all. I did double up the cocoa powder and used brown sugar. I also added shredded coconut to it. My roommate said they weren't sweet enough but I think that's because I used dark chocolate chips instead of milk chocolate. Otherwise they came out fudgey and super rich. The other great thing is they have all the protien from the beans!

These were okay as written (more like cake though), but our family liked them way better with 1 less egg, 1/3 cup cocoa and 1/2 cup dark brown sugar. More "brownie like" that way. The coffee is a great addition!

These are some pretty darn good brownies. Although, I'll admit, I've had trouble with them coming out consistently. I don't add coffee, but maybe I'll try adding a touch of cayenne. For those who say they can taste the beans, make sure you rinse them very well. That should do the trick.

Very good, I took these to work and they were surprised that they were glueten free.  I cut back one egg and added 1/4 cup apple sauce, increased the vanilla and the instant coffee to 2 teaspoons as well as added a teaspoon of cinnamon.

Oh my goodness.... I made these only because I was convinced that there was no way that they would taste good. I was SO wrong! It may help that my blender is a Vitamix, so it pulvarized the beans. I added a tsp of baking powder, a handful of chopped pecans and a sprinkle of toffee pieces to the mix. I'm pretty sure that i will never make another brownie mix again! Sooooo yummy!

I have to admit, I was hesistant to try this, but it was excellent.   I needed a gluten free recipe for a potluck.  I did follow some other suggestions and added more cocoa, and 1/2 tsp baking powder. I had no instant coffee so just left it out.  I put all liquid ingredients in immersion blender, then stirred in the dry ingredients.   One suggestion is to ensure beans are really pureed to get rid of the bits of bean shells, otherwise, when eating the brownies, the texture fells like you are eating whole wheat.

I know it says the milk chocolate chips are optional, but I was pretty surprised to see these in a "dairy-free" recipe. I replaced with non-dairy chocolate chips and they tasted ok, but I'm really unimpressed by the lack of care when marking this as a dairy-free recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly and nobody in my house knew that they were made with black beans. It had an excellent cake like texture and tasted just like a brownie. Still has carbs but the high fiber is there. Will def. make again.

I have made these brownies several times.  I love the gluten-free, high protein, high fiber nature of these brownies, and they are better with some homemade chocolate icing.  Today, however, I subbed COCONUT OIL for the vegetable oil.  Wow!  What a difference!  I have a feeling I'll be making these more often now.

I'm not a fan of this recipe. I've made a different recipe that tasted more like regular brownies. Need to find it again.

love this - I put it in my food processor for about 2 minutes, add 1/2 tsp baking powder and 1/4 c all purpose gluten free flour.  I also add an additional 1 tsp of instant coffee and vanilla. No bean taste and fudge-y. In addition to the milk choc chips after I baked it I sprinkled some semi chocolate chips long the top and closed the lids (use tinfoil) for about 15 min.  Cool. Amazing!

Great recipe! I find lots of sweets to be too sweet and carb filled. Knocks me out! The black beans in this recipe taste surprisingly delicious and don't make me feel like I'm on a sugar overload afterwards. I followed the recipe with these exceptions - upped the cocoa, add a TON of walnuts, cut down the total sugar volume a little bit, occasionally use half Splenda-half sugar. My husband loves them, and I get my chocolate fix! Thanks for sharing this.

These were delicious - they don't have the same texture as a flour-based brownie would, but they were very moist, chocolatey (but I added more cocoa), and had only a very slight bean flavor.  One caveat: it didn't make quite as much as I expected; the batter lay pretty thin in the 9x9 baking dish I used, so I doubled the recipe.  All my coworkers who tried them agreed that while they didn't beat a proper brownie, they were very good for what they were.  Definitely worth a try (and super quick to make if you have a food processor!)

I tried this recipe on a carnivorous, chocolate brownie loving family and they absolutely loved these! Didn't question what was in them but ate almost the whole pan in one sitting! They don't ever do that! Will definitely keep this recipe on the menu. Wonderful flavor and texture.

I followed the directions exactly and was not pleased with the outcome. My family and I found these to be chalky and tasting just like beans covered in unsweetened chocolate.  Even with the milk chocolate chips, they had no sweetness.  They need something to add a little moisture and sweetness.  I wish we had liked them!

Excellent!  I agree with those who say the texture isn't exactly what they are used to with brownies--maybe something between fudge and brownies, but lighter.  I left out the salt, and I used 2 1/2 c cooked dry beans instead of canned, to reduce sodium.  I will try the optional coffee and chips next.

i added cinnamon and 1/4 t baking powder. Was awesome! I think next time I'll make it even healthier by using agave nectar instead of white sugar.

I also cooked and rinsed my own black beans for lower sodium.

Very fantastic recipe, I've found myself making them about every other week as a healthier way to crush my chocolate cravings. I add 1/2 tsp baking powder, increase the cocoa powder to 1/2 cup and typically use 2 tsps instant coffee and avout 1 tblsp vanilla. I recently brought one to my grandparents (which I don't typically do; they're professional chefs and very picky) and they said it tasted like something from a gourmet bakery. They were surprised to find out it was made with black beans and suggested covering it in a milk chocolate ganache. Anyway, they are very delicious and I highly recommend trying them.

We LOVE these! I actually halved the sugar (and made up the difference with Stevia-in-the-Raw), and used coconut oil, instead of vegetable oil. They are delicious! I give them a HUGE thumbs up for taste & texture. The texture is a little different, of course, than a standard brownie, but still really great! Thanks for sharing!

Like many others, I made the following substitutions: 1/2cup applesauce instead of the oil, upped the cocoa powder to 1/3, upped the vanilla to 2t, added 1t baking powder, and used the instant coffee.  I didn't use the chips.  This brings the calories to 106 and the fat to 1.4g.

My cooking time wasn't great (I accidentally turned off the oven part way through and had to restart) so they weren't as dry as they probably should have been but the result was delicious.  I'll certainly be making them again.  Decadent, chocolatey, a hint of coffee, and no bean taste at all.  I can't wait to share them if I can keep out of them for that long.  I wonder what would happen if I subbed out some or all of that sugar since it is so much for an otherwise healthy dessert.

These were really good!  I stirred chocolate chips into the batter, and they were so yummy, I will make them again.  My kids liked them too, even though they are used to eating the box mix brownies.

I really enjoyed these brownies. I've made them twice: once exactly as in the recipe and a second time adding baking powder and soda as well as walnuts. Both times they were yummy, but I liked the second time best. I think the baking powder and soda made the texture perfect and I didn't miss the flour at all! I gave it four stars because I think this tweak takes the original to five stars.

These came out so so dry. I served with Cool Whip which helped, but they were still not very good. Think I will try adding applesauce in next time. Not sure what else to do.

These are really good and easy to make, but much better, imo, with the following alterations. I added about a tsp of baking soda. I used 1/2 cup of honey in stead of sugar and therefore adjusted the baking temp to 325. It then takes about 40 min to bake and comes out deliciously moist. I also left out the coffee, chocolate and vanilla... I once made them for my inlaws and used stevia, but they ended up being really dry :(

These are good considering that they have beans instead of flour.  But they don't taste as good as your standard (less healthy) brownie.  I'm not sure the nutritional profile is good enough to make these worth making again.  I'd usually prefer a smaller portion of a more decadent treat than a slightly larger portion of this.  I should mention that I didn't use the coffee, which might have improved the flavor.  I couldn't taste the beans even without the addition of coffee.

I see nothing wrong with this recipe.  It may not be the gooiest or most decadent brownie ever, but if you're looking for a chocolate fix that's not also an automatic guilty pleasure, give these a shot!  I did add baking powder, as recommended by other reviewers, and upped the cocoa powder to 1/2 cup (I love me some chocolate).  I found using kidney beans introduces even less 'beaniness' than black beans. I also added 2 tbsp cinnamon, which I do with all brownie recipes.

I gave these to my roommates and no one questioned the recipe until they saw the bean cans in the recycle.

2nd REVIEW followed the recipe exact & the consistency was better & cooked through in about 35 minutes. The bean taste was less evident, but for a hard-core brownie lover there's just no substitute for the real thing. This is a good recipe for someone that is trying to stay healthy & willing to compromise on what they consider to be a delicious brownie. Unfortunately, I am going to sacrifice the healthy aspect & stick to the real thing from now on.

I substituted Splenda for the sugar and used 1 Starbucks VIA Italian Roast packet instead of the instant coffee.  I used Torani SF Vanilla syrup in place of the vanilla extract. And I used sugar free dark chocolate chips (non-dairy) to sprinkle on top.  They are delicious!

I tried this recipe exactly as shown minus the coffee.   It wasn't the taste I had a problem with, moreso the texture.  Although when you first bit into them it seemed great once it was in your mouth it crumbled to a very chalky consistency.  Anyone know of some tweak that could help this?

Overall, good brownies.  Not the best I've ever had, but I did not think you could taste the beans - if anything too much coffee flavor.  I will make them again, but this time I will add some peanut butter for additional flavor.

Holy cow, these were so tasty.  My picky husband and daughter even ate them.  I did substitute egg whites.  I doubled the amount of vanilla, and I added 1 tsp. baking powder.  Very delicious!

The texture is a little weird, kind of powdery.  I will make these again, but next time I'll add some baking powder like others have suggested.

Added a little extra coco and didn't use any chocolate chips. Excellent flavour, I dont taste beans at all.

I used beans that were made from scratch (dry) 1.5 cups

This is the best and healthiest black bean brownie recipe I have come across. They are excellent for a small quick snack with a tall glass of milk! I honestly can't taste the black beans, I also added some cinnamon and a little extra vanilla. Even though there is no butter, they are still moist and tasty. They are not the best "brownies" I have ever had, but like I said before in the category of "black bean brownies" they are the best.

While the kids loved it, I (and a few other adults) were able to taste the beans and felt that the texture was a bit strange.

First off, these taste like beans, which I could actually forgive if the texture wasn't awful.  Put them in for double the time stated in the recipe and the inside was still like wet, half-cooked batter, even though the outside had actually burned.  I feel like I wasted a lot of time making this- and I hate cleaning the blender when I don't have to!

I doubled this recipe, as another reviewer mentioned.  I didn't use the coffee and was afraid the black bean taste would come through, but the beans didn't have a taste at all and the brownies smelled so chocolatey.  I used droste cocoa, which I think makes a difference in taste and I added a couple more teaspoons to make up for the coffee. These were the most delicious brownies!  The texture from the black beans, rather than the flour, is so different and good.  Bake them, as they say, just until the top is dry, and they will be perfect.  They are rich, but not heavy.  I put a few chips on top and it makes them look better, but the brownies don't need them for taste.  Also, this is the easiest recipe because everything gets put into the blender and is pureed together.  Thank you.

I enjoyed these greatly--but I am a health nut who doesn't mind when they taste healthy. I went ahead and used 1 Tb vanilla and 1/3-1/2 C. cocoa powder and 2-3tsps instant coffee to richen the flavor. I didn't have any dairy-free chocolate chips so I left them out.  I also added 1/3 cup ground flax to help mgive it a chewier "brownie texture". I am happy with the healthy-ness and allergy-free ingredients in this recipe, I would however, like to experiment more for the chewy brownie texture.

These are quite tasty! I made them exactly as the recipe stated only increasing the vanilla and coffee just because I like the flavors. You cant tell that these are made of beans! These were a big hit. My picky coworker was amazed when she found out these were made of beans! Delicious.

I was looking for a healthier brownie recipe, and when I saw this one, I decided to make it. It was an overall big success, but the instant coffee added a flaky texture, so I may skip that next time. You couldn't taste the beans, although the texture of the brownie was a bit different, probably because of them.

WOW i'm impressed!! couldn't taste the beans at all. changes i made:
used 1/2 cup of cocoa powder
added half tsp more vanilla
added half tsp more coffee
added 3 packets of splenda
blended the chocolate chips right in with the rest of the batter.
this was DELICIOUS. 
only difference between these and 'regular' brownies is that they do taste a bit less sinful.. like they are less moist. i may add applesauce and some more chocolate chips to fix that next time. this recipe is a keeper!

As a vegan and a health food enthusiast I love the taste of all beans. I definitely did not love this. I doubled the cocoa, used applesauce instead of oil and used flax eggs as suggested. I also used dry beans instead of canned. I added the coffee and chocolate chips.  It took about 45 minutes to cook then I glazed it with the icing from the ultimate brownie recipe from this website.  The brownies cooked on the edges much more than the middle.  

They had an unmistakable bean-paste texture and an aftertaste that I had to remove from my mouth immediately. I wanted to love them for health reasons but I won't make them again.

Being from the south I LOVE black beans.  I baked this thinking that I wouldn't be able to taste the beans, but they are ALL I could taste.  I tried this recipe to make a low fat version of brownies.  I suggest modifying other recipes.

These are great. Rating them as a healthy alternative to traditional brownies, not as a competitor, because that's like comparing apples to oranges (or maybe pears?). I also took the advice of some reviewers and added 1/4 t. of baking powder and I didn't have any chocolate chips so I left them out.

Thought these were great. People at work said that if I hadn't have told them that there were black beans in them, they wouldn't have guessed. 

I doubled the vanilla essence and used dried beans which I soaked and then cooked (less sodium). I did find that it took longer than 30 minutes for it to cook - more like 45. It could be my oven though.

Definitely will be making these again! Thank you for the recipe! I followed the other suggestions: rinse the beans & blend for a long long time, used more sugar, used the coffee. Next time I make it, I'll be stirring the chocolate chips into the dough so they don't fall off. Such a good rich-chocolate fix!

These brownies obviously aren't as delicious as your full-fat regular brownie, but for what they are, they taste delicious!  I made these for Sunday School because of a need to accommodate a nut allergy and gluten intolerance, and all of the kids loved them!  I made a double batch in a 9x13 pan.  I needed to bake them for over 40 minutes.  Other than that, I followed the recipe.  Great idea!

I shared this recipe with my mother and she said her and my father just loved it but, when I made it...something must have went wrong. I felt the black bean flavor was overwhelming and they were too moist. If I try this again and yield better results Ill be sure to update my review, in the mean time I am disappointed to say I wasn't a fan.

I omit the instant coffee and they still taste good.  My toddler likes them a lot and they're easy enough to make that we bake them together.  Makes a super moist brownie with hidden fiber and protein.

These are veryyy good considering the ingredients! But, not too good for people who don't like diet recipies.. Also I suggest not telling they are done with beans, cuz people my turn skeptical.. But veryy good! I added peanutbutter and also walnuts. I would add a full cup of splenda or sugar to make them a bit more sweet and also, add chocolate chips to the batter and extra on top to make it more chocolaty and less beans flavor..

I Really was surprised by this! so easy and I'm hard to please chocolate wise, and this did the trick. I used 1/2 cup of apple sauce instead of oil and extra vanilla and coffee. It smells like there's a liquore hidden in there!:) I plan on handing this out this recipe to my friends! (I'd recommend freezing before cutting tho)

I found that these brownies, though stated otherwise, tasted just like beans. I thought they were gross and even tried adding extra coffee to cover the bean taste. Never will suggest!

so delicious! i fed these to men and women and nobody could detect the secret ingredient.

I subsituted 1/4 c applesauce for the oil and used 1/2 c splenda, 1/4 c real sugar.

Cook time was about 35-40 mins, maybe I have a weak oven? Delicious! Will definitely make them again

these brownies would be amazing if I had the ability to completely mix the beans.  My mixer is not the best and left many of them whole!  So some bites were great, some/many were more like chocolately beans, than chocolate brownies.  I also added chocolate chips which was yummy!

If a person had to have a gluten free item these are pretty good, flavor wise. I might add more chocolate chips, mixing them in as well. But they do smell like beans which is understandable, but I doubt I make them again.

I substituted splenda for the sugar and added 1/2 tsp of baking soda.  Decreased baking time to 20 minutes.  The flavor was okay, and the texture was spongey as other reviewers pointed out.  Considering the ingredients, really not too bad.

My husband says these are 3 star brownies because they "aren't gross". However, I liked them!!! I followed the directions but did add baking powder and I used a packet of Starbucks Via for the coffee. They don't taste like beans- but the consistency is a bit off from a traditional brownie.

We love these around here because the higher protein content is so good for hypoglycemics like my husband.  We replace the white sugar with 1 1/2 cups of palm (coconut) sugar so that it has a very very low glycemic index effect.

I either ate a really good piece or a really foul, disgusting tasting peace. The beans were hard to mash and some peaces had a lot of black beans in it. But when it was good, it was good and it sure is a healthier way to enjoy a brownie! (without flour, which I am a bread person!)

very moist and perfect chocolatey taste.  i did double the vanilla and added about 1/4 cup more sugar because i used special dark cocoa powder instead of regular.  just the texture is a little light and airy for brownies, so as long as you don't present them as brownies, then you won't be disappointed.

If you are on a diet, this recipe will sorta satisfy your chocolate craving!  I did do 1/4 c brown sugar and the rest white. Skipped the coffee part, since I didn't have any.  It came out good. Since I knew it had black beans, I (just me, i'm weird like that) could taste the "black beaniness" but it just tasted like a very dense brownie.  My husband thought it was okay but said it needed frosting on it.   The only mistake that I did was incorporate the chocolate chips in the batter and didn't add it last. The chocolate chips sank to the bottom.  It was okay though, just had to scrape it.  I'll make this again!

This is a fantastic recipe for guilt-free snacking.  I use brown sugar for a little extra flavour and chew.  Instead of sprinkling the chips on top, I melt them and stir them in to help bind the brownies.  They are a little crumbly.  I also add some chopped walnuts if there is some in the house.

These are too weird but surprisingly not disgusting. I did not love them though. My husband and I made the recipe exactly as is. I will say they did not have the same texture as brownies. Not gooey, but just kind of packey for lack of a better word. And maybe because I knew, but I could taste a bean flavor. However, if you did not know that they were made with beans, I don't think you would be able to put your finger on what the weird flavor is. But I will definitely try to make again with the baking soda for a more cakey texture and see how they turn out. Not as good as fatty brownies but they may curb that sweet tooth just enough to resist the fatty brownies.

Very yummy!  Moist and chocolaty.  I didn't add the coffee, but it didn't seem to be missing anything.  All I had were semi-sweet chips, too, but they were good.  I'll be making these again!

My kids are bonkers for these!!  They are very moist and taste best after they have cooled.  I definitely recommend adding the chocolate chips.  We've eaten three batches of these in the last week!

wow! amazing! I did mod the recipe a bit but wow! You can't tell at all that it's beans! My kids inhaled them without a second thought! The texture was surprisingly awesome. I expected something to be unappealing but yum!

Oh good god!!  These are wonderful!  I tried them for my hubby and didn't tell them he was eating black beans, he just thought they were gluten free!!  He went nuts over them!   They are so moist!  Now, how can I make them into a cake??

These were so delicious.  I doubled the amount of instant coffee, used egg beaters, doubled the cocoa powder and added baking powder.  I then put a simple Irish Cream frosting on the top.  Took them to the Super Bowl party and everyone was commenting how good they were.....even the men.  When I told them that they were made with black beans and no flour no one believed me!

These brownies are amazing!  Even my husband who is VERY particular said they were good.  I used my immersion blender to mix the batter.  I don't think I will ever make traditional brownies again!

Wow! I was able to enjoy them once I got past the "black bean" thing.  I can't tell you how yummy these are.  The coffee addition makes them extra savory.  I did not add the cocoa powder simply because I didn't have it-I used 1/4 wheat flour instead.  I mixed the chocolate chips in, rather than sprinkling on top & I used refried black beans, haha.  Saved me from getting the blender out.  Lazy.  I know!  :)  I am going to make these again and add walnuts...yum!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I think adding some walnuts would have helped detract from the beany flavor/texture issues I had. For a gluten-free, dairy-free treat, however, these are an excellent choice.   I used semi-sweet morsels due to personal preference, and I did use egg substitute instead of real eggs, so that may have been an issue.  They have almost a mousse-like texture to them.  And while I could take them or leave them, my four year old junk food junkie daughter just informed me that "These are the BESTEST brownies in the whole world!" as she grabbed her second one off the plate.

I was pleasantly suprised with these tasty treats!!! I had some company over, and one of them is a certified NO BEAN EATER. He was braved, tried them, and ended up enjoying quite a bit. He even asked his wife to get the recipe...so I would say that it was a successful lower calories guilty pleasure.

I had to substitute for the egg because of an allergy.  They came out very fudge-y, but were a very good brownie substitute.

surprisingly good! make no mistake, they are not Beacon Hill or Barefoot Contessa brownies, but they are really really good healthy brownies! I will be making these when the kids want brownies, and save the "real" ones for holidays. not that I wouldn't bring these. Thank you for this very unique recipe! My husband even liked them! I used 1 T brewed coffee, 1 T vanilla and 1tsp baking powder. they baked up both fudgy and had some cakey fluffiness too. Brought them to the gym and they got the approval of 3 elite athletes!

I am so surprised, these turned out very good. The texture was a little off, but from the other reviews, a little baking powder should do the trick. I brought the left overs to work and ended up forwarding this email to half a dozen people! Thanks!

OMG these are fantastic.  I had to tweak the recipe a bit as I had a 19oz can of beans.  I added an extra egg, bumped up the cocoa to 1/3 cup, 1 c sugar.  I didn't quite have a enough instant coffee so I added a about 1tsp of cinnamon.  Blended everything up in the processor until smooth.  I did have to cook it for about 33 mins.  My family and I were very skeptical about it, but they gobbled up the nibbles I gave them, even my 3 yr old said "mmm, it good mommy".  Next time I will try some orange flavoring with white chips & orange zest.

Delicious!  Oh my gosh, we keep snitching from the pan just like we do with "real" brownies, but these are so much healthier!  I made the recipe exactly as written - except that I probably added more than 1/2 cup of chocolate chips.  Fabulous!

These had a really rich, chocolate-y taste, but the texture was off. The texture was somewhat grainy and left a weird film in your mouth after eating. Not bad though.

Okay. The first batch I made I forgot the sweetner, and needless to say-they weren't too good. When I followed the recipe, I was surprised by how good they were! Yummy! What a great healty alternative. I did use splenda instead of sugar-still great. They don't have the consistancy of regular brownies. No, they're not chewy. They do melt in your mouth, though. I am saving this recipe!

Certainly not to-die-for, but definitely not bad! They are quite fudgey. I am anxious to try one tomorrow after they've had some time to sit. With a light ganache, they would probably go over even with finicky brownie enthusiasts. NO black bean flavor. I followed it exactly, including the optional coffee and chocolate chips. The instant coffee really does make the chocolate flavor more intense, so I recommend it! **Update: Better a day or two after baking.

These are amazing. Of course they don't taste like a 350 calorie brownie, but they DO taste good. I sprinkled them with a tiny bit of andres candies crushed and used 1/2 cup of sugar, 1/2 cup of sweetened applesauce and no oil. Which makes them only one point on weight watchers. Two if you sprinkle them with chocolate chips or other candy.

I think these are delicious for what they are, a black bean brownie.  I don't taste black beans or feel the skins.  I don't have instant coffee so I didn't add that.  I drained the beans, mashed them with my hand mixer, added the rest of ingredients, mixed until well blended.  I used the choc. chips on top, I think it adds a nice touch.  These are not as fudgy as the brownies I usually make, but they had nice chocolate flavor.  I will make these again.

My family LOVES these!!  I added the chocolate chips and also some heath pieces.  If you are getting too much of an "earthy" taste make sure you rinse your beans in a collander until they don't make bubbles any more and don't use the instant coffee.

These brownies are surprisingly good. I made them and the family didn't know they had beans at all. I did add 1/2 tsp baking powder to give them a light texture. I also added 1 TBSP vanilla extract to boost the flavor, but skipped the coffee. Next time I think it needs more chocolate flavor so I plan to include more cocoa powder.  Overall, a very tasty recipe, I'm amazed I can't taste the beans!

I used Splenda instead of sugar, added 1/3 of a cup of canned pumpkin, one square of unsweetened baking chocolate, and omitted the coffee. These came out looking like beautiful, real brownies! The texture was soft and medium dense. The taste, though? Sort of eggy. It grows on you, though. Would add maybe another chocolate square or the coffee to give it some more depth, or maybe even use two eggs instead of three. My version has 82 calories per square versus the recipe's 127. Will update if I play around with it a bit more.

Oh my goodness!  These are SO good!  Per other reviewers' suggestions, I added 1 tsp of baking powder, but I think I'll scale that back a bit next time because they got too fluffy.  I told my kids I was making brownies with a "secret ingredient" and made them stay out of the kitchen while I was mixing them up.  When they had cooled a bit, I let the kids taste them and, after they said they liked them a LOT, I showed them the bean can.  They about fell over from surprise!  Thanks for a great recipe!!

Whoa! The first word out of my mouth after tasting. My mom made this at my house for herself and when I smelled the black beans after she opened the can, I thought there is no way this could be good. But it was! She has certainly found her recipe for gluten free brownies. Not even the store gluten-free mixes compare to this! But I agree with some others, I think nuts would be a perfect addition to this. Other than that, it's truly amazing!
(How anyone thought of putting black beans in there, I don't know. But it's genius!)

Maybe I'm weird but I liked these WAY more than regular brownies, but I have to admit I never really was a brownie fan. Not until I had these! It's so dark, chocolately, and fudgey. And if you close your eyes, you can almost taste a hint of the hearty earthiness that the black beans give, which just appleals to me so much since I'm a black bean freak. I've made so many healthier sweet treats and never before have I liked one more than the higher fat/calorie version. Interestingly, my family didn't enjoy it as much beacuse of the darker chocolate flavor, but since I thrive on dark chocolate... I devoured it. When I find myself picking it constantly then I know it's a great recipe. Next time I would go with 1/2 ts of baking powder because it rose almost a little too much, but it was still great. I'm also really curious to see how it would be like with 1 TB of baking powder, to make a black brownie cake:)

Surprisingly good!  Mine needed to cook quite a bit longer than the recipe specified.  And I don't like coffee, so I think I might reduce the amount called for next time.  That's just a personal preference though.  I'm excited to try this recipe with other kinds of beans just to see how it works.

Made this recipe with a lot of reservation... how good can a black bean brownie be?? Well, we were blown away by how good they were. Added the 1 tsp baking powder. Will try a little more next week when we make our next batch!

I have a real sweet tooth so I try to find healthier versions of treats to keep around the house and this one works. I like the texture, fudgy, and the flavor. The after taste is a little bean-y but that could probably be worked out with more coffee or vanilla or something. These are not so good I would serve to guests, but good enough for guilt-free chocolate binges!

Interesting texture - not unpleasant. Good flavour but I added an 1/8 cup sugar as it was a bit bland.  Nice, gluten-free square.

Delicious! I changed the cocoa powder quantity to 1/3 cup & added 1 small zucchini which I feel added extra moisture to the brownies - it goes unnoticed but adds extra nutritional benefits. I also omitted the half cup of chocolate chips, but sprinkled around 1/8th of a cup of chopped chocolate on top because that is all I had.

This is the best tasting black bean brownie recipe I have ever found! I am making it again right now, with 3 T of cocoa instead of the 1/4 c because it was still slightly bitter for my kids’ taste, but I still liked it. Thank you for the recipe!

WOW these are good!  I doubled the cocoa, only had garbanzo beans on hand, then added toasted walnuts on top and the hubby couldn't even tell.  He ended up devouring the pan right out of the fridge!

Amazing!
I used 1 T baking soda
I replaced the oil with apple sauce
I added 1/4 c hersey’s milk chocolate chips in the blender; another 1/4 cup on top before I placed it in the oven
Used only 1/2 cup of sugar
Used organic canned black beans and washed them until the water ran clean.
Also, the instant coffee I used was Nescafé exprèsso granules
Baked for 30 minutes. 
AMAZING- no bean taste. I ensured it was well blended.
I used a vita mix and blended for about 3 minutes.

Yummy.  Used egg beaters and 1/3 cup dark brown sugar and 1/3 cup spenda.  I am going to try the  1/2 cup of unsweetned applesauce for the oil next time.

This tasted WAY better than I expected. I think it helps that I used high-fat cocoa powder so that the flavor could really stick to the tongue. I topped my test batch with a dusting of espresso-cocoa sea salt before putting it in the oven, and the final product was divine. I'm definitely going to recommend this recipe to my friends with gluten allergies.

These were great.  I thought it would probably do better with one less egg, but once the brownies settled (after refrigeration) they were perfect.  I added extra chocolate chips, and next time I'm adding walnuts. 

I didn't tell my boyfriend what they were until after he tried them.  They passed the picky b/f test with flying colors.   

I honestly think the black beans add to the rich taste.  I knew they were there, but you couldn't actually taste the beans.  IMO there were not issues with the texture either.  They just tasted like fudgy brownies to me.

I work with a few gluten-sensitive people and was intrigued by this recipe. Everyone was surprised when I told them black beans were used.
The minor changes I made were adding a smidge more cocoa powder than called for, 2 tsp of vanilla and 3 tbsp of strong coffee (I didn't have instant coffee) and 1/2 tsp of baking powder. And rather than chocolate chips, I used peanut butter chips on top......cause peanut butter and chocolate....yum.
I will definitely make these again for my gluten-sensitive friends and family.

I served this brownie to my husband and didn't tell him that it was made with black beans.  He loved it!  And he was very surprised about the black beans.  He took some brownies to work and 2 others wanted the recipe.  
It is an easy recipe and I made it with no difficulty.  It was a hit!

I read the reviews and changed the recipe to have 1/3c cocoa powder, 3tsp vanilla, and about half the sugar. I used coconut oil and also added 1/2tsp baking powder and 1/2tsp baking soda. I had to add a little bit of water to make it the right consistency. I used semi-sweet chocolate chips in mine, as that's all I had on hand. They were the bomb because the brownie didn't have as much sugar.

After tasting these brownies, I think they need more fat. They were dry. I accidentally left them in longer than I should have because I didn't hear the alarm going off, but they are pretty dry. I'll try making them again. ...Make sure not to overbake them like I did! They won't burn, but they'll get dried out and won't be as good.

Loved these with changes and never tasted the beans. Like many, I swapped apple sauce for the oil, added more vanilla and chocolate, and used 1 t baking soda, but I also made a couple other swaps: used 1/4 avocado for 1 of the 3 eggs and replaced 1/4 c sugar with eryrthritol, and added walnuts.

My rating is for the recipe as it is written.  Most wouldn't know it's black forest, but the consistency is still a bit lacking.  Given that it's relatively healthy I forgive this readily.  However, I use this recipe as a base and have made so many variations of what I consider 5 star brownies by adding roughly a cup of almond flour or coconut flour and enough milk to bring it back to the brownie batter consistency.  I like nutty brownies, so I experiment there, too.  I always add baking soda regardless of my additions.  A great starter recipe!

Mixed reviews on this one. The flavour was good, found the skins from the beans were a bit off putting while eating them and the texture didn’t resemble a brownie. Mushy far too soft I kept cooking it well past the time it said but it never solidified. I will probably try it again. Could have been user error ;)

I did not add the instant coffee or the chocolate chips and it was delicious.  I did cook it for exactly 26 minutes and it was perfect.  Thanks for the tip.  My granddaughter who hates breakfast can enjoy these tomorrow morning as there is lots of protein!

I used Swerve instead of sugar. 
Used coconut oil at bottom then a later of coconut chips the poured batter on top. 
I used 1 T Walnut oil & 2 T coconut oil. 
I added ginger & cinnamon. Ginger helps minimize the gas from the beans & the Swerve. 

It fills my need for sugar. Quite tasty.

I made them for a Oscar party and they were a big hit. And then when I mentioned they were gluten free and were made with black beans everyone wanted the receipe. I followed some of the deviations suggested by others, I used applesauce vs oil, I added more vanilla, 2 tablespoon real coffee,  added a little more coco powder and I added 1/2 tsp baking soda and 1/2 tsp baking soda to make them like cake. Delicious!

I love these brownies. They come out fluffy and moist. They rant guilt free but they at least make me feel a little bit better about dessert. Next time I make them I want to try to sweeten them with Monk Fruit and use a Keto friendly oil so that the brownies are Keto friendly.

So easy and so good.  I added the baking powder suggested in another review but will leave it out next time.  
I could not taste beans at all.  There is a different texture as an after thought but great, moist, chocolate flavor.  Even better the next day!

I needed a gluten free dessert for guests.  Made it in the blender -exactly as recipe is written.  Perfect!  2 people even asked me for the recipe after I revealed it was made with black beans!  Tip:  I thought I had let it cool long enough to sprinkle powdered sugar on top, but it melted in anyways and you could not see it.  Sprinkle powdered sugar on top just prior to serving.

You always wonder how these types of brownies taste to the average person, and I'm here to say these surprised me! I'm a regular baker, so these didn't quite match up to some of the more deluxe brownies I've made, but they were good enough I ate a whole row in one sitting! Texture is a bit strange, but the flavor isn't unusual - I couldn't really taste the coffee, though, and I even put extra in (afraid of the bean taste). Considering my lack of dietary restrictions, I probably would not choose to bake these again over other types. It was more of a pleasant surprise that I didn't want to toss the pan, really.

Perfect! I reduced the sugar by 1/4c and they turn out nice and moist. Everyone really enjoys them. For a change I used canned chickpeas and added 1/4c unsweetened powdered peanut butter and turned out great. Thanks for the recipe

I made the recipe as its written, and loved it! My personal feedback is that it's delicious and amazing and I prefer these to the brownie mixes I'd been using. My teenaged daughter and son agreed with me, but my partner thought they were "a little grainy" and said he'd prefer the box mixes. One comment though throughout tasting was how impossible it was to detect the black beans. I fed these to a herd of teens and they had no clue that this contained beans. These brownies are definitely more moist and a little different from regular brownies (both pluses in my book) but people said they just through were "like flourless brownies", which is a good way of describing the end result. At any rate, they're fantastic and my new go-to recipe. I love them.

This recipe was great! I added some coconut before I blended. Next time I will definitely add walnuts because the texture of the brownies is not quite as gooey as a regular brownie, but still delicious. I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil, greased the pan with coconut oil, and used raw sugar.

I might try some mint flavoring with the vanilla next time.  The brownies are wet feeling, but I'm ok with that.  Used applesauce instead of oil (maybe that's why they're 'wet'?) and they are tasty.  These are definitely diet brownies for me, but after not eating sweets for months, they are just the right amount of sweet for me.

I used coconut oil instead of veg, strong brewed coffee instead of instant, and added a dash of baking powder.  Awesomely moist fudgy brownies.  Don't miss the flour one bit.

For what it is, it’s great. It’s not brownies and shouldn’t be thought of as such. It’s black bean brownies and the texture is different but still good.

This is now my favorite brownie recipe!  I've made it a couple of times.  I stir in a half cup of chopped nuts and 1/2 bag of carob chips instead of putting the chocolate chips on top.  I cut the sugar back a little, because I like the rich cocoa flavor over the sweetness.  The texture isn't as dense and fudgey as many brownie recipes, but the flavor is just outstanding.  I've served them to my chocoholic friends and no one guessed they weren't traditional brownies!

No complaints!  The texture really "set" after the first day, and at that point there was no telling that this was a bean product and not a flour product.  I did add a half tsp or so of baking powder, having read the other reviews.  Next time I want to substitute black beans for sweet red beans and the instant coffee for matcha powder.

Started low-carb diet last week, needed a "cheat" over the weekend and these were amazing! Used sugar substitute and figured these to be under 5 net carbs, plus no one guessed the secret ingredient...black beans!

I substituted raw cacao powder for the cocoa. They were delicious and dark chocolate flavor. The texture was good except that they would crumble. I could not get one single nice looking brownie out of the pan. I’m hoping someone can come up with a solution for the crumbling.

These were awesome! Even my picky son liked these. Couldn’t taste the black beans at all. I added slightly more than 1/4 cup of cocoa powder. Used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar. Also used 1 tsp baking powder.

Yum!!! Thank you for posting this recipe! I upped the cocoa and reduced the number of chocolate chips (I really think it needs them but I am on a diet) used the coffee and blended it until it was completely smooth.  I also added the 1 tsp baking powder. Really good! Thanks Elizabeth!

I have made this several times and it is a hit with the kids. I have tried several diff ingredients as coffee isnt something i have on hand or like. I have added extra vanilla  and cocoa. I have added a dash of cinnamon.....tasted and smelled wonderful. Def add the baking powder. Makes a difference.

Loved it! Just made this recipe. I lessened the sugar to 1/2 cup instead of 3/4. Also added melted peanut butter on top (because we LOVE peanut butter). You can’t taste the beans, and even with me lessening the sugar its plenty sweet! So happy with this recipe.

I used canned pumpkin pie mix instead of oil or applesauce, because I had it and I love the flavor. I also substituted pecans for the walnuts, and went with a previous review and used a bit of baking powder. Used good vanilla and no coffee because I didn't think it would work with the pumpkin. They are so good

These brownies are really easy. I have made them twice. Both times I didn't add the coffee. No one can tell there is black beans in it. I sprinkled walnut pieces instead of the chocolate chips. Keeps well in fridge.

I made it according to directions...VERY GOOD.....I did use a food processor to make the bean batter smooth & aerated...no bean taste at all and almost a flour-like texture....thanks for the recipe;  I am trying to incorporate more beans into my diet to follow the GBOMBS diet...also, I topped with chopped walnuts rather than chocolate chips....next time I may double the coffee only because I love coffee flavor...someone suggested using baking powder to make it cake-like....might try this as well...BUT VERY GOOD AS IS!  thanks so much for sharing...

I just made these, and couldn't wait to review them! I had a good feeling about the recipe, having made a black bean - based flourless cake previously which was quite good. I followed the advice of another reviewer, who added a bit (maybe 1 Tbsp) extra of cocoa, plus half vanilla & half almond extract. They were super moist and delicious after baking time of 26 minutes. A new favorite!

Great recipe! I just tweaked a few things and they were perfect:
- 1/3 cup cocoa powder
- 2TBSP coconut oil + 1TBSP vegetable/canola oil
- 1 1/2 tsp vanilla
- 2 tsp instant coffee

This will probably be my go to black bean brownies recipe :) Thanks!

I loved this recipe! Super moist, and not too sweet. I used soaked dried black beans instead of canned beans. Made three batches, it was that yummy! Substituted 1 of the eggs for half a banana once too when I ran out if eggs.

This is my second time making this recipe.  It is very good, my kids enjoyed these brownies and did not detect that they were made with beans.  They did notice a difference from the box brownies I usually make, but they devoured these in no time at all.  I increased to a  tablespoon of  instant coffee and a tablespoon of vanilla extract.

These were great. I had semisweet chocolate chips so I melted 1/4 cup with some milk and added to the batter. I also doubled the coco powder like some others had suggested. I sprinkled with chocolate chips and walnuts. The walnuts added the perfect amount of crunch and contrast to this soft brownie. I will make these again for sure!!

Excellent recipe!! I follow a blood type diet so Black Beans were out for me. I substituted with Pinto Beans.. I love them and so did everyone I gave them to.. Easy Peasy with little mess. I added 1/4 cup of cranberries to the last batch and got a thumbs up. ??  I've made them 3 times already and they disappear really fast. Can't get enough..

I have a friend who cannot eat gluten and this recipe proved to be a winner. Even those of us that did not need to avoid gluten liked it.

Worked great!  I used stevia instead of sugar and coconut oil instead of vegetable.  It's texture is more like a molten lava cake.

Great recipe. Super easy and delicious. It's a healthy way to "cheat." I make  my a little bit healthier with coconut oil and coconut sugar. It still tastes good.

Shockingly good!  My recipe changes were adding 1 tsp. of baking powder, 1 and 1/4 cups of coconut sugar instead of white sugar, topped with 1/4 cup of chocolate chips and 1/4 cup of chopped walnuts.
Thank you, Elizabeth,  for sharing this DELISH recipe! :)

Really good!  We used the Vitamix and the texture was just fine. Will try substituting applesauce for oil, Eggbeaters for eggs and Splenda for sugar next time.

I made these and found them to be very yummy.  Of course they don't taste like normal brownies, since they are not made with flour.  They are more moist than a normal brownie and stay soft even after a few days.

I've been making this recipe for a few years now. I really enjoy it, & I find it's a simple, no-nonsense black bean (bb) brownie recipe. I have always used coconut oil as the oil & to grease the pan. This oil has the right sweetness to accompany the dish. It's been a few years since I made this dish. I'd soaked a load of bb, & I was looking for recipes to use them up. I found a few bb recipes online that had oats in them, & they just seemed liked a lot of effort for my tired, weary head.  So I unearthed this old fave. It's so simple, that my 14 yr old offered to make them. They're tasty.

Definitely making these again! I subbed out the following applesauce for oil, and dates for white sugar!  next time I will add more applesauce for the moisture but other than that nothing else! Even my friends who scrunched their nose were pleasantly surprised! Hubby ate them up!

I've only made these once so far.  They did have a bit of a "beany" flavor, so the next time I make them I will add a bit more cocoa (possibly use a better cocoa-like a dark chocolate).  However, they are very moist and my boys didn't blink an eye at eating them.  So, if this gets some healthier food into them, I will be making these more often.  I think I just need to experiment with the ingredients a bit more.

I read some reviews and made a few little changes to my own recipe. Turns out I was out of cocoa so I just used full pkg of chocolate pudding I found in cupboard. Used 2 T applesauce and 1 of oil. Used no white sugar but scant 1/4 cup of brown sugar and added about 1 T molasses. No salt but touch of cayenne pepper. I am not so much trying to review but need a way to make note of my changes for next time and don't see any other way to add in my personal notes does any one know how I can do this?

delish! here's my revisions:

I added: 
3/4 tsp baking powder
chopped peanuts instead of walnuts (i was out)
2 TBS Hersheys Chocolate Syrup
3/4 Cup coconut flour
1 tsp almond extract....

also I added alot more semi sweet chocolate chips (only after mixing everything in food processor)
 
substitutions:
....instead of oil, i used the equivalent amt of unsweetend applesauce and canned pumpkin 
....a bit less sugar and instant coffee to keep from being bitter. 
....Coconut sugar instead of table sugar////

The brownies turned out just like real brownies. Tasty and chocolatey. Can barely tell black beans are in here. Topped batter with more semi sweet chips b4 baking. Baked for 30 minutes at 350.  They had a distinct almond flavor.  Peanuts gave it some bite and texture. i mixed the batter for a nice long time to make sure the beans were super finely mashed ....VERY yummy. will make again....PS-NOTE::::  the outer edges touching the pan were a tad dry so next time i will only bake for 25 mins.

These turned out fantastic! Only thing I did differently was add a couple mini marshmallows to the top! Definitely recommend making these especially if you want brownies without being totally unhealthy!

Very good flavor and texture. I use Slenda Baking blend and I also used 3 tbsp strong brewed coffee as I didn't have the other. I also added 1 tsp baking powder as suggested in reviews. Another reviewer recommended keeping in fridge as they will mold left out. I didn't like after fridged as they took on a wetness that took away from a brownie or cake sensation. So I will make when they will be eaten that day. Really good recipe though!  Thanks!

These brownies are tasty and easy to make.  The texture is different than traditional brownies, but the taste is still delicious. Great for kids or anyone that wants a healthier sweet.

Loved them! These taste so good but eat them after a while, weirdly they taste so much better after three hours from baking them then right away. You honestly cannot taste any black bean flavor and their gluten free+

Plain ole brownies are so much better than these. I would not make them again. My family is not gluten free or dairy free. We prefer the real thing. There is not comparison between the two.

Wanted a basic recipe for a bean based brownie and this worked out very well.

I made a double batch because I miscalculated on how much Stevia I needed to add in place of the sugar. After that snafu I just kind of winged it. 

I didn't have any more Black Beans so I added a can of Garbonzo beans. 

 I had about a cup and a half of Cocoa Puffs that I threw into the blender just in case it needed some more bulk since I wasn't using sugar. I figured the sugar and the extra cocoa content wouldn't hurt the taste any either. 

I used a total of 3 tablespoons of cocoa since the garbanzo beans don't have a strong  "bean" taste. 

Used 5 eggs in the double batch. 

Added applesauce in place of the oil. I didn't measure it but i think I added a bit more than 1/2 cup which might have been a bit too much. 

Added a teaspoon of Baking Powder to the double batch (thanks to others who suggested this).

Using an 8x8 pan it took about 50 minutes for a toothpick to come out mostly clean in the center. 

It came out moist but firm with a slight cake texture thanks to the Baking Powder. Taste was chocolatey without being overwhelming or bitter or "beany".  If I hadn't made this myself I would not have guessed it had beans in it. 

I think next time I'm going to add a tablespoon or two of peanut butter to the mix to see what it does and maybe make a batch that uses just Garbanzo beans. 

This is a good recipe to experiment with and I will be experimenting with it again in the future.  Thanks.

I made these as a healthier sweet treat option for my son and I. The firs time I made these, I did so according to the recipe. I loved them, but my son wasn't a fan of the texture. The second time I made them, I added about 1/4 tsp of cinnamon, upped the cocoa powder to 1/3 cup, 1 tsp baking powder (reviews say it makes them more cakey), subbed coconut oil , and crushed and toasted some almonds to throw on top before baking.

Both my son and I are in agreement that the flavour changed, but the texture was quite similar. Flavour wise, the second was more complex but I enjoyed both equally, whereas my son much preferred the second.  In the second, the coconut and cinnamon flavours really came out to complement the cocoa flavour very nicely. The baking powder did make it a bit more cakey, but not much different. Actually, they were a little drier than the original recipe. Come to think of it, I think that the texture that he finds unpleasing is unavoidable. I think it is the lack of 'chewiness' that would come with the gluten from the flour (my guess), and these brownies are not chewy in the least.

So, there's the verdict.
Original recipe: me 5/5, son 1/5 - 
With review recommended changes: me 5/5, son 3/5.

Hope that some of you find this helpful!

Love this recipe. I use coconut oil instead of vegetable oil, cacao powder, and finely ground dark coffee (a bit more than recommended). Then I crush up a bar of dark mint chocolate to put on top, and after its baked, I put it in the freezer. It's amazing! The top chocolate layer gets really crunchy and the brownie part (which is much denser than a traditional brownie) turns into an awesome ice cream bar thing - seriously, try it.

These always work best as cupcakes because sometimes the middle of a pan can remain gooey and not in a good way. I have a vitamix and it makes the batter really smooth. Last time I made these I opted to leave out the coffee powder and instead added 3 drops of peppermint essential oil (DoTerra) and they were AMAZING!!! Tastes just like the girlscouts thin mints only soft and moist.

So easy and delicious. Doesn't taste beany if you rinse the beans very well. I used a dark chocolate cocoa, cut the sugar to 1/2 cup and only baked it for 25 minutes instead of 30. SO yummy!

Really delicious.  Because I didn't have any white sugar, I used brown.  I also added a smidge of baking powder as others suggested.  I'm very pleased with this recipe.  :-)

Made this recipe, awesome! Would never guess these were made with beans! Baked in mini muffin tin to make 2 bite brownies, decreased bake time to 20 minutes. They were hit with my toddlers and husband. Will def make again!

These were really good. Great gluten free/healthier brownie option and will make again. Subbed coconut oil for vegetable oil and it added some great flavor. Will add almond extract next time as well.

The bean flavor is practically undetectable - it tastes like a dimension of the chocolate.  They are quite dense, which is my personal preference, so I thought these were great. I added the coffee and chocolate chips as suggested and also added 1/2 c chocolate chips to the batter.

I had taken a shot at these the other day and they are surprisingly tasty. I like the idea of them being gluten free and no starch. They are rich but very good!

It was okay, not great.  I prefer using gluten free all purpose flour. The consistency and flavor are better.

So good! I was skeptical, but pleasantly surprised. I didn't have a few ingredients, so I substituted vegetable oil with coconut oil and instead of coco powder I used chocolate protein powder. So delicious and creamy!!!!

I love the idea of using beans in brownies (PROTEIN!!!).  I can understand that a person with a special diet may have an appreciation for this recipe, because it may be better than nothing.  I personally did not care for it.  The flavor was more of a  'cakey' brownie, kind of a tease for my chocolate craving.  The texture was what was most difficult to get past:  It held it's shape but seemed still crumbly but still moist on my mouth, if that makes sense.  The save in this recipe are the chocolate chips on top (I'm a semi-sweet girl over milk chocolate though).  If I were to make it again, I would put more chocolate chips.

Our family LOVES this recipe! We never add the coffee, but since I was searching for high protein foods that my daughter would actually eat, I add 1/4 cup vanilla (or sweet cream) protein powder. I also make them in my mini muffin pan and we love how they turn out nice and bite sized. I have also used the "flax eggs" as a substitute for eggs when making them for my niece who is allergic to eggs and they are just as wonderful! This is a recipe that my kids ask for again and again!

I just had one of these and I'm trying to stop myself from eating another. They're so good - the consistency is different, but rich (you can look up pictures to see what I mean). I used a few of the modifications in the comments - I increased the cocoa powder, vanilla, and instant coffee, though it could have used more cocoa. I decreased the sugar by 1/4 c. and used about 1/4 c. chopped (bittersweet) chocolate chunks for the topping. I also used a 1/2 c. of applesauce and 1 tsp of oil instead of the 3 tbsp of oil. I didn't have applesauce, so I chopped an apple, microwaved it with a little water, and threw it in the blender. The best part of these brownies is that they don't (completely) cancel out my workouts.

I'm a personal trainer and always looking for desserts that add more nutritional punch.  This does the job and yes, there are bits of skin left which turned my hubby off, but not me!  I top all my brownies with chocolate ganache (remember I work out) instead of the choice chips and no added salt  beans

We made this recipe for a special dinner and it turned out fabulous. We tweaked the recipe by adding 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract and added approximately an eighth of a cup more than the recommended amount of sugar. We also up to the vanilla to 3 teaspoons and baked them for 30 minutes. I used the plane Coco and Ghirardelli milk chocolate chips.  They turned out amazing! Top them with a small scoop of premium vanilla ice cream and you have a true restaurant worthy desert.

Replace the oil with applesauce and the sugar with Splenda, and you have a fairly healthy dessert. Guilt free.

This recipe was great! I love recipes that use ingredients that may seem strange. Sometimes they so totally work! This one works! I did not have instant coffe so I subbed a shot of coffee liquor, and I always use a dash of Cayenne with anything chocolate. No beany, and friends and family loved. I will try the applesauce sub next batch. I'm not using wheat products, so a huge thank you for this recipe Elizibeth.

We used Truvia instead of white sugar and 3/4 cup is way too much.  I'd cut it if you use a sweetener and possibly add something like almond extract.  Omitted the coffee.  I like it and will refrigerate it so it becomes even chewier. Yum.

Pretty good. I made the recipe almost exactly as stated except for exchanging two of the tablespoons of oil for two tablespoons of room temperature (semi-solid) coconut oil. I rinsed the beans really well and used a fresh, quality cocoa. I did not add chips or coffee. The brownies came out moist, slightly cakey, with no bean taste. My 6-year-old was wary when the beans were added to the mix but after tasting them they were rated "almost as good" as regular brownies.

Not the best brownie I've ever had, but considering these are made without any flour or butter, pretty good! I used coconut oil instead of vegetable, and my fiancé is diabetic (which is the whole reason I was making flourless brownies in the first place) so replaced the sugar with stevia. Used bittersweet chocolate on top. He had no idea there were black beans in these, and he is an EXTREMELY picky eater. I think next time I will mix the chocolate chips right in instead of sprinkling on top.

Yum! Where have these been all my gluten free life?? I made these into cupcakes (they made 12 filled 1/2- ish full of batter) baked at the same time and temperature and they were so good. I did add the coffee and I used vanilla my girlfriend brought back from Mexico and the combo was deadly. All of our kids gobbled them up and had no clue they were made from beans. Thanks for the great recipe.

I didn't care for the taste of these. The bean and coffee flavor was too distinguishable, even after adding a little more cocoa powder than was called for. However, these did bake very nicely and really resembled brownies.

Loved these.  I detected no bean flavor at all. Added  1 oz of melted bakers chocolate in addition to the 1/3 of cocoa, subbed applesauce for the oil and added baking powder.  They are  a bit delicate not as durable as box brownies.  Will experiment with more beans in the future.

For protein-filled brownies these are pretty darn tasty. I used the 1 tsp of baking powder as well and it came out with a hearty texture. I wouldn't say these are healthy, because no amount of chocolate and sugar is, but they're definitely a less fattening option (with the protein - which is great for vegetarians like me!).

These are surprising and super chocolately! I didn't have vanilla so I just used a few more chocolate chips. I also added the 1 tsp of baking powder as another reviewer suggested. I tried baking them in muffin pans and they are like little brownie cupcakes! Definitely making again. Especially since my hubby won't have a clue I'm sneaking in beans into his diet!

I don't eat gluten-free, but my new sister-in-law has to, so I wanted to find a gluten free dessert to make when she visits. I also didn't want to have to buy special/expensive flour substitutes since I probably wouldn't use them again. I did a trial run of this, and I thought they were good, but the texture was not something I've ever had before. My mom did not like them at all...and she loves chocolate anything. Don't let that discourage you from trying this recipe out, I think this is one of those recipes where you either love it or hate it, and it's pretty cheap to make so if you don't like it, you won't lose that much money for the effort. I subbed egg beaters for the eggs and I used International Delight Suisse Mocha for the instant coffee. I will definitely make this again, since even though I'm not gluten free, I am on a high fiber diet. And beans are a great source of fiber...and gas so don't eat the whole pan at once! lol Thanks for the recipe! :)

Ok, I was skeptical.  But this was actually pretty good. I read some reviews before making this, and the only change was that I added 1/2 tsp each of baking soda and baking powder.  Will make this again.

Delicious! I added a little more unsweetened cocoa and a little more vanilla as well. Also added walnuts and topped with frozen yogurt. Used cane sugar instead of the white. Family loved, told them that they were " black bean brownies" after they ate them the look of shock came across their faces lol I think next time I will try with applesauce instead of the vegetable oil (have done that to many recipes and always comes out great) and will substituted each egg with 1 tbls of ground flax plus 3 tbls of water. Awesome recipe thanks

Excellent!  This are so delicious!  I added 3 tsp of strong brewed coffee instead of the instant.   I made some last week and am making them again tonight.  They are in the oven.  Can't wait until they are done.

The taste is fine, but mine didn't really bake. They're mush on the inside. The outside is cooked, but inside they're raw. I baked them at 350 for 30 minutes and didn't deviate from the recipe at all. These seem like they would be great if I could get them to cook all the way. I don't know what went wrong. Did anyone else have this problem? Any suggestions on how to fix this? [And yes, I did have the oven turned on. So no jokes about that! ;) ]

Just made these brownies for the first time and am very pleased with how they turned out.  I took the recommendations of some other reviewers and added about 3/4 t of baking powder and used 1/2 cup applesauce rather than the oil.  I topped the brownies with the brownie frosting recipe (also from this site) and am very happy with the results.  Be sure to place the ingredients in a blender or food processor.  I didn't; just used by KitcheAide and I had tiny chunks of beans in the final product.  Not a big deal~still tasted fabulous!

These are great! I followed other people suggestions and used close to 1/2 cup coco powder. I also mixed in the chocolate chips and didn't add the coffee. The only thing I didn't like a ton was the texture. It was a little like a spongy cake, so maybe next time i'll only add 2 eggs instead of 3.

I prepared it, for my family, as directed to the letter. And the flavor was surprising for essentially a chocolate bean pie. But within a couple of hours we all had some unpleasant results. I will NOT be making this again!!

I enjoyed these, flavor got better with each bite. The texture was a little weird, but not bad. I will make these again, maybe with almond butter, or nutella perhaps.

Super easy to make. I have tried this recipe as originally given and I have substituted the oil for applesauce and cut out 1 1/4 cup of sugar for Stevia.  I LOVE them.  My nine year old son loves them. Even my picky husband enjoys them. I have made several batches of these now, they are a staple in my kitchen to help me stay on track and be healthier.

I loved these! Per other reviews I added 1 tsp baking powder and the texture was awesome. I also added less coffee and a little more cocoa powder. I happen to love black beans but my husband does not and he didn't believe that these had black beans in them. Next time I will substitute oil with applesauce. Great recipe

I loved these, however my husband did not like them at all. He didn't object the flavor, but he couldn't get past the texture. He knew something was up after the first bite. Hopefully it improves overnight as some previous reviews report.

This is a pretty good replacement for brownies. It's not identical to a regular brownie, but everyone really liked it. The only change I made was sprinkling almonds on top instead of the chocolate chips. It added a nice crunch.

These are great, especially for those with gluten allergies! I didn't like the first one because I was thinking about beans so it tasted like beans. After that, I just thought "chocolate" and they were great! My husband loves them as well - didn't see that one coming!

Really liked them if you do not want to eat the real thing.  Add 1 tsp of baking powder & nuts and maybe a little more chocolate chips.  Husband said that they were not sweet enough.

I think they are very good, I think I could tweak them to improve the texture so I may try this again. a tad bit of melted chips on top would make like a frosting and intensify the chocolate a little. I will make them again cause I need alot of protien and the beans are great for this and I love black beans anyway!

For a "better for you brownie" these were really good.  I certainly love them, and my oh so picky daughter has no clue they are made with beans.  They were a definite success. I chose to stick to the recipe minus the coffee this round, but next time I may add peanut butter chips to the top for a treat. YUM!

Not Great. If you cannot have flour or grain products, they are far better than having no dessert at all, but they were definitely not great. They had a bitter, beany edge and were not nearly sweet enough. I added a handful of pecans for the last 10 seconds of blending, and used the suggested milk chocolate chips on top, but they were still just ok. Kind of gummy. My son-in-law, who usually loves any kind of chocolate baked goods, politely ate one and did not go back for seconds. They could be decent, maybe with a little more sugar.

This has become THE recipe when I want to make something healthier.  I do substitute Splenda for the sugar because I'm diabetic.  Everything else is the same.  The first time I made them I took them in to work and nobody could believe they were made with black beans.  No other recipe in my collection gets more rave reviews and I always do a double recipe.

love the recipe AS WRITTEN. But I don't understand how others can critique IT when they alter it??? Maybe alter AFTER you try it as is - then you can complain (about tasting the beans).

These are mushy and gritty. These aren't cakey or fudgey, just mushy. These have a few less calories so I thought I would give them a try but I'm going back to the old recipe

Very good but not as good as box brownies. Not bad for a healthy alternative. Would be better with more chocolate chips.

This is too funny.  My kids don't like beans, so I hide the cans.  They love them.  I even served them at church and they were the first dessert gone!  People said they went back for more and there were none left.  (I did add a 1/4 cup ground almonds.)

Pretty good! I made these for my toddler who is very anti-protein.  They are in no way a truly decadent brownie, but for a healthy alternative they do the job! I omitted the coffee and mixed the chocolate chips right into batter.

A good introduction to baking w/o wheat.  My 13 yo daughter and I have made just a few tweaks;  Increase the cocoa to 1/3 C, make the sugar 1/2 C granulated and 1/4 C brown, and add a tad more than 1 teaspoon of butter, omit the instant coffee (We felt the flavor of the coffee was too strong, and gave the brownies an unbalanced flavor.  In wheat-based brownie recipes the addition of coffee blooms the flavor of the cocoa, enhancing the chocolate flavor.  We didn't find that was true, here).  These changes took care of that last remaining "beaniness".  They're absolutely delectable, now!

I went a little heavy on the cocoa powder, a little heavy on the oil and I shaved a dark chocolate candy bar on the top.  This reminds me of a flourless chocolate cake from a fancy restaurant.  I don't think I shall ever make brownies using flour again!

I made these for a family dinner and everyone liked them! Including a family member that won't eat black beans. I did substitute brown sugar for white sugar, and mixed nuts for the chocolate chips. I know some of my friends wouldn't be so keen on these since they don't have that sugary brownie taste, but for my family and me that's perfect. Maybe I'll add more sugar or chocolate when I want to make them have that sugary taste.

Amazing. Added 1/2 t cinnamon and upped coffee granules and vanilla to 1 1/2 t each. Blended in my cuisinart and baked at 340 (my oven runs hot) for exactly 30 minutes. I say it makes 8 servings and each one has 5 WW Points Plus - great!

Just made these, and they are delicious! I also added 1/2 tsp of baking powder like others commented, and since I was out of vanilla, I used maple syrup! Topped them with powdered sugar, and yum yum yum :) will definitely make again. Can't taste the black beans at all!

LOVE THESE! I had to cook mine way longer than 30 minutes per my changes. I used 3tbsp flaxmeal mixed with 9 tbsp water; 1/3 c chunky peanut butter; 2tbsp applesauce; and 3 tsp ground coffee (not instant). I probably added too much liquid, but adding the peanut butter gives them a rich, almost box-like texture! SO glad I found this recipe!!

Crazy good!  I used what I had on hand so oil was Coconut oil, maple syrup instead of sugar - 1/2 cup, 1 tsp of baking powder as recommended, and as the substitution of syrup for sugar made the mixture a bit runny I added some almond flour till the consistency was right.  These are the most delicious brownies - not chewey but cake-like, moist and heavenly.  I can't believe how easy they were to make.  Can't wait to see how they are, cold, tomorrow.  Thank you SOOOOO much!

I added the 1/2 tsp baking soda as others recommended. I also added extra cocoa powder, chocolate chips, and instant coffee powder. The flavor was slightly bean-ish.  To me, it was reminiscent of "an" (japanese sweet bean paste used as filling in daifuku and other sweets).  I gave it four stars because it's a gluten-free and dairy-free recipe that doesn't have weird ingredients (xantham gum? what is that?). It's a decent recipe if you have food intolerances, but not an ideal substitute otherwise.

This recipe turned out great!  I tweaked it just a little by using applesauce in place of the oil, and instead of 3/4 c sugar, I used about a 1/3 c sugar and 1/4 stevia.  Also I added the teaspoon of baking powder a few other folks suggested to make them "cakier".  They turned out absolutely delicious and virtually guilt free!!!

Fantastic!  I made a double batch of these for the Superbowl party, and they went like hotcakes.  No one had any idea they were "special."  Love that they're gluten free.  The only change I made was incoprorating butterscotch chips with the chocolate chips.  Yummy!

I thought this was fantastic!  I did double the chocolate chips to kick up the chocolate.  My kids loved it.  It reminded me of a chocolate torte.  You could put it in a round pan and top it with raspberry jelly and pull it off as a fancy dessert.  I am recommending this to all my friends with gluten-free and dairy-free diets.

Seriously, my sister even said they were better than from a mix, and believe me, she won't eat anything that she doesn't like, she's very honest, but you have to add much more cocoa, sugar and baking chocolate, so this recipe is not a good one,

I can't speak to this recipe exactly as written because I hate coffee flavor. Having said that, when I substituted coconut that had been soaked in amaretto....Heavenly! I followed others' suggestions and added 1tsp baking powder and upped the coca to 1/3C. Everyone absolutely inhales these every time I make them. Also, fresh raspberries on top before baking is DIVINE! Even though I didn't stick exactly to the recipe, I'll give it 5 stars anyway, because people deserve to have this option for brownies. Thanks for the great alternative!

Not bad for a fake brownie :p  After reading some reviews I added extra vanilla, cocoa and instant coffee (about an extra tsp of each).  The taste is great but the brownies themselves fall apart. I think next time I'll either use apple sauce instead of/in place of some of the oil, or I'll take them out of the oven a minute or two early.

These are excellent, considering the ingredients.  I followed the recipe fairly closely (for me anyway). I used brown sugar instead of white (because that's what was on my counter) and sprinkled some chopped walnuts on top along with the chips.  I have a really sweet tooth, so next time I will add some chips and/or more sugar to the batter mixture.

I thought these were fantastic. Didn't taste any bean flavor at all. I didn't have any instant coffee, so I just used a little more cocoa powder. I loved the fudge like texture. I don't like super-sweet things, so I cut the sugar down to 1/3 cup and it was still great. I like them topped with peanut butter chips.

Love these!  And my kid friends don't care that there is beans in them.  I added a little more cocoa , but otherwise stick to the recipe .  Thank you.

The best healthy brownie recipe I've ever come across. I changed it only slightly, using only a half cup of sugar (raw sugar) and added a half cup of stevia. It turned out so well, everyone in my family asks for these all the time. The best healthy dessert that people cannot stop requesting!

The only changes I made were to up the cocoa from 1/4 to 1/3 cup and to omit the optional coffee. I used Bush's black beans, well rinsed. I'm a little surprised so many reviewers have mentioned the lack of bean flavor because to me the bean flavor is very pronounced. They're still kind of good (esp. the choc. chips on top!) so I will keep fiddling with the recipe (adding baking powder, more cocoa or some melted semi-sweet chocolate as others have suggested). It would be helpful if other reviewers specified the brand of canned black beans they used. Maybe that's important. To anyone making this merely because it's GF, there are WAY better tasting GF brownie recipes out there. They're not health food though :)

I followed the recipe with substituting the sugar with Stevia and both my husband and I love it. We will try a few of the suggestions below, such as nuts, B Powder or B Soda, but love it as is. This is perfect for Diabetics with the sugar substitute. I'm sure my kids and Grandkids will love them.

Love these.  I made them exactly as stated but over a flourless peanut butter cookie crust and brought them to a friend who can't have gluten, and he thought they were super decadent and had no idea they were made with black beans!  Admittedly the peanut butter is a good distraction from any hint of black bean taste, but even on their own they're great.  Don't leave out the chocolate chips on top (I reduced to 1/4 cup and used mini chips, and it was fine).

This is the first time I ever made a black bean brownie. I have to say they were very good. They were extremely satisfying. I will be making them again.

I joined the site just so I could review this.  It takes like black beans with a little cocoa.  I told my husband it was a surprise ingredient recipe.  He took one bite & said, "It tastes like tacos."
I cook & bake a lot but because it was a busy day I picked this recipe since it was the simplest black bean brownie recipe that came up when I searched.  There are others with more ingredients that I will try & hopefully they will balance the beans better.  As is, it does NOT taste like brownies.

These are really wonderful! You can't even tell that there are beans in this recipe! They taste like great brownies! I added 1 tsp of baking powder as recommended by other reviewers and they turned out perfect! This will be my brownie recipe from now on!

I'm shocked that a reviewer said their brownies came out dry. I followed the recipe and mine came out too gooey and undercooked. Either 30 minutes isn't long enough or 350 is not enough heat.

Fudgey! No bean flavor at all! Added a lil more cocoa b/c I love things to be super chocolatey... *tried a different recipe that called for white whole wheat flour (which i usually use for cookies and things), and agave nectar. THIS RECIPE FAR better tasting, sweeter and fudgier, will definetely make again SOON! YUMM

I think these brownies tasted okay but definitely not yummy.  A little gritty and even short on sweet.  If I needed to hide protein in a treat this would do the trick but I would rather have a traditional brownie any day.  So I would only recommend this as a healthy alternative.

This is a great recipe - I might add that I have replaced the vegetable oil for applesauce. And for a pumpkinny taste use applesauce w/cinnamon.

Our family LOVES these brownies.  I have a child with feeding issues who is on a very limited diet so I'm always searching for ways to get a little more nutrition and protein in his diet (which is wheat and dairy free already).  I've also substituted carob powder instead of cocoa and they still were delicious.  We all love these - even my husband, who was very reluctant to try them.  I've never used the coffee as we limit caffeine but they still come out great.

These were really good.  There is something different about the texture tho.  Kind of grainy and soft.  Not sure how to explain it but these tasted great. I ate two pieces right out of the oven.   Cant taste beans at all.  These are wonderful with ice cream.  Super easy.

This recipe turned out very dry. My friend suggested using the box brownies and just replacing the black beans for oil and eggs. They were way better.

These were interesting, I didn't have a blender on hand so I just smashed them by hand as well as I could. It was definitely an interesting flavor but they were really light and filling. Give it a try, it's not like they're hard to make and they're inexpensive to make.

These were yummy! I only made half the recipe (with 1 egg) because I wasn't sure how they'd turn out but I was very happy with the result. Next time I'll make the whole recipe. I also added dried cranberries.

Not bad. I added walnuts at end of the blending to have them stand out more and I replaced the white sugar with light brown sugar. I would try these again with some replacements to make it healthier.

First time I ever made brownies. It was ridiculously easy and turned out to me amazingly good. Out of nearly 10 people (some of them pretty finicky) guessed what the main ingredient was! I felt that a 1/4 cup of pecans before blending it added a nice mild crunch to the texture. Also, I didn't have any vanilla extract, so put in a teaspoon of vanilla sugar. I did add in a tsp of baking powder as well, and topped it all with white chocolate chips. Just used an electric hand blender to blend it all together.

Awesome recipe! I used instant espresso powder and dark chocolate chips. It was very fudgy although I do miss some of the bready quality of traditional brownies, these are still very good. I plan on making them again making some more healthy swaps (fake sugar, applesauce, etc.) Hopefully it works! :)

I'm giving them 5 stars but that's for "Black Bean Brownies", not "Super Decadent Real Brownies".  In other words, they're not as good as real brownies, but they're fantastic considering the main ingredient is beans.  My super-picky kids both asked for seconds -- even after I revealed the "secret ingredient"-- and I could feel good about giving them seconds!

AMAZING!  You CANNOT taste the black beans- you must try to believe!  They are a different consistency than regular brownies but taste very good!  Could easily be "hidden" with frosting, hot fudge, etc.  Thank you thank you for giving brownies a healthier makeover!

I followed the recipe except for adding some baking powder as suggested by other reviewers, but it was very spongy and chubby textured. The taste was good, but the texture was off. I will try this again w/o the baking powder and see if that is an improvement.

I personally have not tried these, but my sister-in-law made them (she's on a gluten-free diet).  She said they are really good!  I'm going to make them soon, as my husband has also given up gluten!

Yummy. I didnt have any chocolate chips or the coffee. I'm sure the chips and nuts would make this even better! My husband took some brownies to work. No one believed there was black beans in it. =) Think I'll never go back to brownies made with flour again.

These were yummy! Not the greatest brownie I've ever had, but good and not too crazy of a sugar rush.  My changes were 1/3C cocoa, walnuts, and 1T baking powder.  I will be making these again!  Give them a shot, its a pretty inexpensive and easy recipe.*I also tried this recipe in a mini-muffin tin (28 muffins), baking them at 350 for approx. 20 min.  They turned out great! Gluten free 2-bite brownies!

Amazing! I made my friends guess what the main ingredient was when I told them no dairy, no flours, and they were totally surprised! I made it with my friend in mind who's dairy free and since I'm gluten free it was a recipe for us both! My husband kept making faces as i was making it and to his surprise thought they were some of the best brownies he's had.  He even asked for second helpings when he's not even a dessert fan.  I am so amazed and would never have thought the flavor would have been so sweet and delicious. YOU HAVE TO TRY IT TO BELIEVE ITS SO GOOD!!! thanks for the recipe!

Good, I added a little bit more veg oil, cocoa, white sugar, and  doubled the coffee after reading other reviewer's suggestions.  It doesn't have the same texture of brownies but with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top you can't tell the difference.

It's a brownie with a fine black bean texture.  Yummy but not DELICIOUS, too "light" to satisfy a true brownie craving. I increased vanilla to 1 tbsp, 1 tbsp instant cappuccino instead of instant coffee, 3 tbsps margarine.

My best friend came over for a visit just as I was putting this into the oven. She , myself, & everyone else who tried these thought they tasted just as good or better then brownies made with flour. We couldn't even tell they were made with blck beans. Also I used dried black beans that I had prepared/cooked with jalapeno, empazote, & onion. I thought that canned beans are seasoned a bit too & I had made plenty of beans some for eating w/rice, etc. which I seasoned further & some I knew I wanted to use to try this recipe & sure enough it turned out perfect. I also did use special dark chocolate chips & it was a hit w/everyone who tried it! Thank-you Elizabeth for coming up w/this great idea. I'm just wondering what inspired you to use blck beans in the first place?Thank-you, thank-you! Sooooo gooood!

A bit too sweet and I can still taste the black beans. I made some changes though. I used unsweetened applesauce instead of oil. 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar. And a 9" square pan for about 28 minutes. I also added semi sweet choc chunks on top with walnuts. Next time, I think I will bake a bit longer, and will add 1 tsp of baking powder and eliminate 1/4 cup of sugar for more cake like brownies. Good recipe though!

These were fun and interesting to try. I followed as directed except used mini chips, because that is what I had. I don't think they tasted like bean at all. But they were not chocolatey enough for me and the texture wasn't that great. As for a gluten free recipe, I like the garbanzo chocolate cake better.

These turned out great!  I have a friend who has celiac disease and the thought of never eating cake again makes me so sad for her.  I made her cupcakes once from a gluten-free mix and they were so dry and horrible.  WE LOVED THESE!  She ate like 3 of them in the first 5 minutes.  They do taste better the next day and not straight out of the oven though.  I'm so happy that she enjoyed these and can't wait to share them with her celiac friends!!  I'm going to make them again and see if I can trick my 2 year old into eating them!

I think this recipe is a great starter point. The first time I made the brownies (w. the optional coffee) they had a distinct bean taste.  However, the second time I made sure the beans were completely and thoroughly rinsed, and we added pecans and dried cherries to the mix.  The results were great, no bean taste!  Very excited about this recipe!

These were very good considering they had beans in them. They're healthier. I made them with the optional ingredients and the suggestions from the first reviewer. I could taste the beans, but they weren't a "Eww! Beans!" flavor I was expecting. In fact, it's more like a "BEANS! FASCINATING!" flavor. I like these a lot, and I think the chocolate really goes with the bean flavor and they compliment each other well. After 30 minutes, my brownie was set but when I cut it they stuck to the pan and kind of fell apart. I ended up scraping most of the bottoms off (still really, good), but I wish it had held together better. Perhaps 30 minutes isn't enough for mine? It was still kind of mushy. Nevertheless, this is very interesting and worth making. Chocolate + Black Beans = Love :]

The texture of these really threw me off. They were dry and cracking on top, but the insides were still moist. I think there may have been too many eggs. However, I didn't taste the beans. They taste better with some icecream. UPDATE: These are a lot better the next day. They get 4 stars now :-)

I used only two eggs and added 1.5 teaspoons of instant coffee, but skipped the chocolate chips.  Baked on a 12x9 pan for about 20 minutes.  Was incredibly moist, but I could still tell it was made with black beans.  Still delicious, though, since I absolutely love black beans!  After refrigeration, they taste even better!

Fun & different. More fudgy than brownie in texture. Better after sitting a bit. I used a half tsp of baking soda and Penzey's Cocoa (a bit more than called for). My kids are "on" to me always trying to trick them, so they were very hesitant. One said I had put nuts in, he said he could taste the "skin" from the nuts. The blender really blended the beans up really well, but I guess he could still detect the skin. I'm taking them to work today to see how they react.

There is a distinct textural difference between these brownies and regular brownies.  My kids rejected them outright.  I didn't think they were too bad, but I prefer the recipes that use pumpkin and cake mix to make the brownies.  They are much better received.

I was really, really shocked with how well these turned out.  I didn't have high expectations when I took a look at the batter, but was pleasantly surprised when I tried them!  I've tried using Splenda and egg subsitute as well and they still come out great.

I love these brownies and I make them all the time, but I subsstitute the sugar for splenda and raise it to 1 1/4 cups. These are very tasty and I don't feel like  after eating them like I would after eating a regular brownie, and these are even acceptable to eat for breakfast! Highly recommended

I will definitely make these again! They turned out great and no hint of black bean flavor. 
 I agree that they do need just a little something more, maybe nuts or something like that.

I read the other posts about this recipe saying they didn't taste black beans at all... I don't agree!  I can definitely taste black beans.  That said, I don't thing they're horrible... I wouldn't make them again though.  The aftertaste is ok, the chocolate really comes through after the brownie has been swallowed.
