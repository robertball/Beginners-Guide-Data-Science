I only used about 1 cup of dressing.  Just enough to cover the chicken.  I tossed the marinated chicken in the bread crumbs in a gallon sized ziploc bag and placed back into pan.  You don't want too much italian dressing on the bottom of the pan at this point or it will turn out too mushy.  At end of cooking time I removed foil, topped with shredded parmesan and turned the oven to broil just for a few minutes till nicely browned.  I think this gave it a nice touch.  Very tasty and moist chicken.  Good to serve with a pasta side dish.

Very quick and easy. I would use less dressing.  One cup is probably enough for next time.

This is good.  The chicken is tender and tasty.  I added a little melted butter on top of the bread crumbs to help it get crispy.

This was very good!  I felt weird about cooking the chicken in the same marinade so I discarded the marinade and left a little just to coat the bottom of the pan.  The results were perfect.  I just added about another 20 minutes to the cooking and WALA! sumptuous, tender chicken!

There is no way the chicken WON'T be soggy. I loved the idea, though, and thought the flavor would be there. I marinated the bird bits in a baggie w/ the dressing for as long as I could, then rolled in crumbs. I baked on racks on a cookie sheet so the air could move around the breasts, and they came out juicy and crispy and wonderful! The dressing I used had a touch of sweetness, I wish I'd added a little salt, pepper and red pepper to the marinade but that's not the recipes fault. With my changes we will make this over and over.

Very tender and flavourful. I also added some italian seasoning, and some garlic powder. Instead of breading the breasts, I cut them into strips and cooked them, covered, in the marinade. Yum!

The marinade gave the chicken lots of flavor and it was really soft and tender.  A big hit with my family :)

I have used different techniques to make this recipe, however, they always turn out DELICIOUS! We love this! For a twist I also like to sprinkle the top with parmesan chicken. Thanks :)

I made this for dinner today and really liked it.  The chicken turned out very tender and juicy.  Someone else mentioned drizzling melted butter on the bread crumbs once they are coating the chicken.  I tried that and it gave it a richer flavor.  I also added about a teaspoon of oregano and a dash of Parmesan cheese to the bread crumbs.  I found that the oregano complimented the flavors in the Italian dressing.

I am not sure what went wrong, usually all recipes I use from the site are wonderful, this one was not. I followed the directions, but the taste was kind of sweet due to the salad dressing event though I got rid of the remaining sauce after breading and before I put in the oven. I don't think we should cover it with foil; foil prevented it from getting crispy. I did remove it the last few minutes but still it stayed mushy. My kids didn't like it and I didn't, so I used the chicken to make Chicken noodle soup that is heavenly. That added some flavor to the soup.

Very simple and extremely delicious!  I love Good Seasons Italian dressing mix using balsamic vinegar instead of the cider vinegar; it's the only Italian dressing we eat.  I used it to marinate the chicken for about 3 hours, and my husband raved!

Great recipe although next time I will only use one cup of dressing. My family loved it but the two cups of dressing is too much.

This recipe was very good! though I did make some changes.  I used original bread crumbs, since I didn't have Italian at the time, then after I baked them, I threw them in the deep fryer. Took only a few minutes more and they turned out great!

Thanks so much for this recipe!  It's easy and delicious and the whole family enjoys it.  The first time I made it by the book, but read other reviews and reduced the dressing to one cup. It was superb. Now I get creative. I've made it the "lazy" way - frozen chicken and just added the dressing and crumbs over it in the dish and bake, adjusting the cooking time. Lazy, easy and yummy!  I've tried different dressings too, it's always good.

Amazing!!!! My husband and I enjoyed it.  I do suggest you let it marinate for atleast a day or two the flavor stays on better. I also placed it to marinate in a large bag. I also took others suggestions by lightly covering the pan with italian dressing.  Will def make again

Excellent & easy! I used 1 C of salad dressing instead of 2 and it was perfect. After it was done cooking, I broiled it for a few minutes to brown it up a little.  It was juicy and tender! My husband said the chicken tasted like it had stuffing on it :)

Instead of chicken breast I used chicken thighs and drumsticks.  As easy as this recipe is, the chicken turned out flavorful and moist.  Picky fiance can not stop raving about it.  Perfect mid-week meal.

This recipe was great! My husband and my boys loved it! Even my 4 year old who doesn't eat a lot of meat asked for seconds.  I used 1 cup fat-free dressing instead and it still came out great!  Thank you!

Had this last night and it was so good.  I added garlic, and soaked the chicken in Italian dressing in a ziploc bag for awhile.  Good, will make again.

Made this with 2 boneless chicken breasts cut into strips and marinated with dressing for 30 minutes or so. Then shook in bread crumbs, back in dressing, back in crumbs into pan(no extra dressing in pan.) Topped with little pats of butter and sprinkle of paremasan cheese and baked. Had foil on for first 20 minutes and then cooked uncovered. Delicious! Kids (4 & 2) weren't too happy with it, but hubby and I thought it was wonderful. Anxious to see how the leftovers go!

I was very confused while reading the reviews until I realized the directions didn't say to discard the marinade before baking.  My family usually just takes the chicken and let it soak in the dressing for a day or two and then we toss it on the grill....so yummy.  But as I just bought a new home and don't have a grill yet, I love this baking in Italian breadcrumbs.  I do add extra seasoning to my breadcrumbs: garlic powder, onion salt, paprika, etc.  Oh, and I do use dark meat, not the breast....cheaper and more flavor!

AWESOME.  Very moist!  I was running short on time and only marinated the chicken for about an hour and it was still extremely flavorful!  My son who eats pretty close to NOTHING without being force ate a HUGE breast and kept asking us for more!  He even requested the left overs for lunch the next day!

Five star recipe for flavor, but I only gave it four stars because I think if I had left the entire amount of the italian dressing in the pan, it would have been a soggy mess. I marinated the chicken for two hours, then dredged in crumbs, dipped it back into the marinade and back in the crumbs. It was so moist and the outside was crispy. Perfect for an easy weekday meal!

This was so easy to make and so delicious.  I used bone in chicken breasts but next time will use the boneless so I can eat the whole thing!!!!

This was great! I used this for venison before, but never thought to use it for chicken. I used a lot less italian dressing and cut the chicken in bite sized chunks. I let it marinate for a couple hours. When it came time to bread crumb it, I put the bread crumbs in a gallon sized zip lock bag then threw in all the chicken, tossed it around untill all coated then dumped it back into the baking dish. As I said, I used alot less dressing so there was very little left in the baking dish. We all loved it, there was one problem...I wish I knew everyone was going to stuff themselves with it, I would have made more :)

this was very tender and flavorful.  make sure and pair it with something mellow - because the taste is fairly strong and will need to be evened out with some mashed potatoes or something.

This was so easy and tastes great!  The chicken was moist and had lots of flavor. My family loved it.  I will definitely make again.

The vinegar flavor was overwhelming and covering the chicken while it baked made it soggy. One the plus side, the vinegar made the chicken very tender.

This was a big hit. We love chicken marinated in Italian dressing. I used Italian Panko Crumbs and that made it even better. Served it up with rice pilaf and corn and everyone was happy. It's definitely a keeper.

I made this the other night however it was just OK. No taste what so ever. I even marinated the chicken for more than 2 hours. Will not be doing again.

Way too much Italian dressing.  I only used one cup, but it was still a bit overwhelming.  Came out a bit soggy.  We ate it - and it was okay, but I probably won't make it again.

This recipe was just "OK" for me. I admit I did expect it to be a bit crunchier, and it was just too soft. It did have good flavor, but it just wasn't my favorite.

Easy to make, but I didn't find the flavor to be all that great.  My husband ate it and didn't rave about it, but my mom liked it pretty well, so I'll give it 3 stars. This was just ok and I don't think I'll make it again.  We're pretty spicy people and I think this was too straightforward for us.  Thanks for an easy recipe.
