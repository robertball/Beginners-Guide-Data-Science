This recipe is great, but there is no need for the additional salt because the soy sauce has a lot of sodium.  Also, if you like garlic, use fresh crushed garlic instead. I tend to use ground beef instead of ground pork because the ground pork takes longer to cook, and when I make a huge batch of these, I don't have time to make sure the pork is cooked well and at the same time the lumpia wrapper is not burnt!  My extra ingredient that gives the taste a special twist is to use sesame oil too.  I use sesame oil that's more an asian style, and it has a strong scent, but a lot of people will say it tastes good and ask what that extra ingredient is.  I also add an egg as well.   This recipe is good w/sweet and sour sauce or w/soy sauce and a little vinegar for dipping.Another good sauce to eat with this is Thai sweet chili sauce for a little hint of spice.  OH YEAH ..they're great for freezing in case you have unexpected guests... like the other reviewer said, you don't need to thaw before frying, just be careful of oil spatter.. don't turn the heat too high or it will burn quickly while the middle is still frozen.  If you want to  make  sure the amount of soy sauce isn't too salty for you, don't add it all at once, and you could do what my mom does, throw a little tiny bit of the meat on a pan and fry it and then taste it to get your flavors right.  a tip i got from my cousin is that if you are freezing them, spray the bag or container you keep them in with baking spray  and lay

I love lumpia, but can't find it where I live now.  So finding this recipe was great.  I used all beef because I forgot to buy the pork, but it was still good.  The extra salt is not needed at all.  I cooked some when fresh and froze the rest.  They work great when fried after being frozen.  Just put in hot oil without thawing.  
Next time I may try adding some veggies to the mix for some variety.  These are a lot of work but so worth the time and effort.

I have been making lumpia for years now  using all pork, all ground beef and even all ground turkey for the filling.  The pork filled lumpia came in first for taste with the ground turkey coming in second. Check the lumpia wrappers for mold before you check out in the grocery store. Experience has taught me that the lumpia wrappers either need to be used almost immediately or frozen for future use as soon as you get them home.  They mold easily and I have bought my fair share of unchecked moldy wrappers home. It is really important to only put about a pinkie's worth of filling in each wrapper as these cook up pretty quickly and you want to make sure these are done completely. Sometimes I cheat using store bought shredded carrot and cabbage cole slaw mixture and a half a medium onion for the vegetables. Oh and dont forget to pull all of the wrappers apart before you start rolling (a huge time saver).  Just remember to cover them back up with a dry dishcloth as to prevent drying out while rolling. I always create an assembly line using about 7 wrappers at a time  quickly stuffing, rolling then sealing them. Sweet Chilli Sauce is a must have for dipping.  It can usually be found next to the sweet and sour sauce of any grocery store while the wrappers can be found in the frozen section.  Both can be found at just about any international grocery store. Cook some lumpia now and freeze the rest for a later date.

Aside from substituting onion salt (and reducing the salt content) for the regular salt, and adding 1/4 cup sliced green onions, I made NO changes to this recipe. These are excellent!!! I will DEFINITELY make these again (probably weekly)!!! I also used egg roll wrappers instead of spring roll wrappers (didn't have them on hand at the time).  I have also found that I can brush them with peanut oil and bake them in a 425 degree oven for 25 min to reduce the fat content, turning the lumpia after 10 minutes. The peanut oil also adds a nice flavor when deep fried. Thanks for the great recipe!!!!

My Filipina finance loves this recipe!  Be very careful with the salt though, if you use what the recipe says it will turn out extremely salty...  The salt that is in the soy sauce is already enough.

This recipie is great.  It is just like the ones the ladies in the kitchen (all Filipinos) make for our work pot-lucks.  I had a request from a fellow co-worker to create a chicken version.  Through not authentic, diced chicken with just an added drop of seseme seed oil, cooked just like the rest of the recipe, was great.

My husband has craved lumpia's ever since he left the Marine Corp.....almost twenty years ago.  I decided to make this recipe for him and our card-party guests and it was a HUGE hit!  They always ask if we'll be having these at each card party.  They were served with banana ketchup, which I've never had and had my doubts about.  That, too, was excellent!  My only suggestion for this recipe would be to use low-sodium soy sauce and to cut back a little on the salt.  This recipe is one that I will use again and again, thanks for sharing it Cristine!

It was a hit at my husband's pot luck party! They all loved it! I used ground pork and it tasted terrific!!  I made another batch for the house, I used ground beef it wasn't as great.  I suggest using ground pork.  Also, I'd add about 1 tbs of onion powder and maybe 1 tsp of msg. Lessen on the black pepper..maybe just a 1 tsp.  2 1/2 is just way way too much.

I left out the added salt completely, added garlic and they were great. I divided the mixture in half and added ginger and shredded carrots to one half of it for a variety.  The smaller egg roll wrappers make far more than 20 servings, depending on the size of the serving. Next time I will use less hamburger and more pork.  The hamburger flavor overpowered the pork.  Excellent base recipe to start from.  Thanks.

All I have to say is INCREDIBLE!!! These taste just as good as any restaurants, if not better! I used just the pork, and added freshly ground ginger,cabbage and omitted the salt. They turned out fabulous! The other recipes I looked at were way too long and time consuming. This one was quick easy and oh so tasty! Will definitely make these again and again. Awesome recipe Christine!! Thanks for sharing!

I was really disappointed with this recipe. I followed everything that was in the ingredients and now my whole batch is ruined because it's too salty. I'm so upset. It took me a long time to finish wrapping all those lumpia only to find out that the food is TOO SALTY!!

I love lumpiang shanghai, and this is a good recipe.  However, I definitely only use ground pork because the beef is too heavy, in my opinion.  I also add minced water chestnuts, and that gives a little more texture.  I have used green onions in place of regular onions, too, and either way has been good.

I am filipino and this recipes reminded me of home. I made a few changes though....I used actual lumpia wrappers intead of spring roll wrappers. They're harder to find, but they change the texture. It's a little crunchier and the paper is a little thinner (which is a bit truer to what it should be). However, if you do this you need to use an egg as a way to close the wrapper. I as well only put one tablespoon of salt. Other than that....it was great....

Pretty good - but I felt that the soy sauce completely overpowered everything! I'll try either halving or omitting it next time.

Great!  Very easy to make.  I've made them twice.  The first time I followed the recipe and loved them.  Second time I used ground chicken instead of pork/beef and less salt.  Even thought I was using low sodium soy sauce I still thought the original recipe is too salty.  I loved it with ground chicken and even added the extra meat filling to Pancit...yum!  My local Asian market carries frozen Lumpia wrappers so I used those instead of egg roll wrappers....I am not sure if there is a flavor difference between the two. Another variation...I did brown my ground meat before adding the other ingredients.

Awesome recipe...I gave it 4 stars because the salt intake is a little high for me - but still delicious.
Be sure to add green onions as well.

I used a ziploc bag, snipped off the corner and used it to squeeze the mix out - it'll save you A LOT of time and MESS.  Also, to make the wrapper stick better, make sure to wet it with water as you are wrapping it up.

These were good but the flavors were a little mellow the first time around.  The next time, I let the filling rest in the fridge for 24 hours.  This allowed the flavors in the meat to develop more.

I had a very good friend from Thailand who made these for me once. I begged her to make me some more and she made me about 50 of them, that I kept in my freezer and pulled out whenever... she has since moved away and I lost touch with her, but I stumbled upon this recipe (yay!)... 
I used a Lb of ground beef, and a Lb of ground pork. I followed the recipe exact, but I added 2 tsps. of sesame seed oil, for that nutty flavor, and also added some bean sprouts to the meat mixture as well (because I remember the ones my friend made had bean sprouts in them), and it adds a extra 'crunch'. this is a very good recipe. can't wait to make these again but I will make sure to save enough to stash in the freezer for a quick appetizer  ;)))

These were good!  The only thing I changed was.. I added raisins and sprinkled some cayenne pepper to the mixture.  This gave it a very unique flavor that everyone loved!  Next time I will cook the mixture first.. I like my spring/egg rolls stuffed with mixture.. that's hard to do when the meat is uncooked at the beginning.

Good recipe, I used mild pork sausage for the ground pork and ground turkey for the beef and it was amazing. The pork sausage gave it a nice flavor. I also used egg roll wrappers and i cut them in half and filled with one tablespoon filling. It made quite a bit and used up all the meat.

Wonderful!  I love the sweet carrot to balance the saltiness of the soy.  But I prefer a shred to a grate to give more texture and color.  And getting the lumpia into uniform shape takes a bit of practice! But SO worth the effort!

all I have to say is YUMM. I added some fresh parsley as a Filipino friend does. I think next time I may add a bit of chopped cabbage too.

Easy recipe, but time consuming - and well worth it. This was my first attempt at lumpia..the kids were eating them as fast as I could cook them!  I added some chopped green onion to the filling and used fresh garlic instead of powder (3 cloves) and used only ground pork (my preference).  Didn't use much salt..as the soy sauce has plenty for my liking.  Paired with sweet thai chili sauce - quite addicting!

This recipe was GREAT! BUTTT I did add the 2T. of salt and they were sooo salty no one in my house ate them! I had to add more meat to my leftover meat to be able to cook the rest. BUt I look forward to making them again with less salt :)

Turned out well. I mixed the ingredients in a gallon sized resealable plastic bag and cut a hole in one corner so that I could squeeze the mixture onto the wrapper. Next time I plan to use fresh garlic instead of the powder.

I've made this recipe without changing a thing and they were SO GOOD, I can't say the extra salt made a difference either way. I've also made these using 2 lbs of ground turkey instead of the other meats and they turned out great too!

Delicious!  Try dipping in banana catsup (from your oriental grocer).  Or try with a sweet and sour sauce - not authentic but great!!

The flavor is outstanding and very authentic! The only criticism I have is that if you are indeed going to use spring roll wrappers, you need to brush them with olive oil and bake instead. If you fry them, they are likely to not meet your expectations.

AMAZING!!! way better than our favorite place here!!! I used only pork and lumpia wraps (I found them at my regular grocery store non problem). Thanks for the recipe. I have been cooking Italian food for a few people in exchange for some lumpias but never got them back from them :( well, now I do not need them, I can make them myself!!! they are super easy and super yummy!!!

My Filipino grandmother made the BEST pork/beef Lumpias. Unfortunately, she passed away several years ago.  I nor my mom cant seem to find her recipe. So, I tried out this one.  

I found it to be incredably salty!  I would cut back the salt to 1 TSP at the most.  The sodium from the soy sauce adds to the saltiness anyway.

Deeeeeeeeeeeeeeelicious!
We followed the suggestions of using just pork and eliminating the salt.  Also, we used about 4 tbsp of filling per wrapper (enormous lumpia!) in order to use all the filling with just one package of wrappers.
Very tasty, and thanks!

these were good make sure to use good quality meats. you may want to use salt free soy sauce or they may be a little salty for those who dont care for salty flavors. be sure not to put too much meat in or it will not cook all the way and the outside will burn

Made this for our Filipino night and they were just how we remembered them. The Filipinos used to make these when we had fair on the Navy base in Sicily when i was going up. Yummy blast from the past thanks! I got the spring roll wrappers from a local international grocery store. I did however use all ground pork and no beef.

This was the recipe that was the closest to what I ate when I grew up in Subic Bay, PI.  I love this recipe and Pancit.  Our Maid Lute use to serve 2 types. Fried and Raw. Raw was always done with fresh cooked Shrimp or Crabs. Cooked used either beef or pork or both. Depends on availability at the time.  Thanks for the recipe and stirring my teen year memories.

This recipe is simply delicious.  I made 100 for a church picnic and they were all gobbled up.  Next time, I will try just pork mixture and add in finely chopped celery for a little variation.  It's definitely a keeper!

I am going to have to rate this on filling alone because my spring roll wrappers were horrible. Well, first I tried to make them myself, which was sort of a failed experiment. Then I bought the first ones I saw at the store, which had a taste similar to what Elmer's glue must taste like. So instead, I cooked up the beef and the onion and combined it with the rest of the ingredients. I added 1 tablespoon of roasted red chili paste and layered it between two layers of sliced potatoes in a large round casserole dish. I baked it in the oven for 45 minutes at 400 degrees, covered. It turned out great. The reason I am knocking off a star though is that there is no need for additional salt when you already have soy sauce. I used lite soy sauce alone and it was plenty salty. If I ever get the hang of making spring roll wrappers, I will try this as listed.

Love this dish! I made my variation w/ ground pork mixed w/ shrimp cut into small pieces, omitted the soy sauce and added finely chopped water chestnuts. If you can't find the sweet chili sauce, you can make a sweet and sour sauce using ketchup, a little vinegar, sugar, cornstarch and water mixed over low heat. It was a hit on my office party.

This recipe called for way too much salt. I'm Filipino and my mother loves lots of salt on her food but even she said it was too salty. We added diced shrimp and water chestnuts and omitted the carrots. Carrots can make the lumpia a little mushy due to the extra water. Definitely use real garlic!

I cooked the beef/pork and ingredients minus the salt before rolling them. This is how my dad who is Filipino used to do it.  Turned out so good and flavorful!  This recipe makes 26.  I definitely recommend doubling this and freezing the rest.  When doubling the meat, I only doubled the soy sauce but kept garlic powder and pepper the same amount.  Also, make sure to drain the meat before adding the other ingredients.
To bake:  450 degrees for 10 minutes, flip the lumpia and bake 8-10 more minutes.

This is my favourite type of lumpia and I'm glad that I can make it now for my own family. Knowing that there is soy sauce in the meat mixture, I omitted the salt. I only used about a TB of soy sauce, which was a teeny bit bland, so next time I will use TB. I also used green onion, sliced very thin. As for wrapping the lumpia, I actually used another technique from another recipe on here, where you spread a thin line across a WHOLE wrapper sheet, roll it up, seal the edge, then cut it into thirds (or halves if you prefer larger lumpia). I find that this enable the meat to cook all the way through as the ends are open, and not sealed :) It also makes for cute finger food for parties :) Overall, great recipe! Next time, I'll play with the recipe and try it with shrimp :D

This reminded me of my aunts lumpias growing up! I did add chopped water chestnuts, green onions, lots of garlic, rice wine vinegar & omitted the white onions. Really great and everybody loved them... All 50 we gone in the matter of minutes. Thanks for sharing!

I think one ingredient that is definitley missing is FISH SAUCE! Replace the salt with 1 tablespoon of fish sauce. Also, test your filling by cooking a little in a pan to adjust the seasoning before you roll! I always use a combo of proteins, I've done shrimp and chicken, chicken and beef, pork and shrimp, pork and chicken etc. I like to get one lean and one fatty meat to balance out flavors and textures. Another secret for THE BEST TASTING FILLING IS to add a dash of sweet chilli sauce. The sugar and peppers in it balance everything out! Also be a bit sparing with the soy! 1/4 cup is waaay too much.

This is a great recipe. I would omit the salt, though. You can also add chopped parsley.

This was the closest to my mother's and aunt's lumpia I have tasted.  I would cut back on the salt quite a bit and I tried the spring roll wrappers (rice flour/tapioca wraps) and they did not turn out. I need to find actual lumpia wrappers.

Great recipe I think that beef/pork lumpia is one of the best versions. I usually steam some white rice and add it in as well.

This is a very good recipe.  My grandmother on my fathers side was of Chinese/Pacific Islander and she always made things like Lumpias (we grew up calling them wontons due to the fact that we used wonton wrappers lol) and kim chee just because of the places she grew up and the influences on her cooking.

This recipe is less extravagent than hers but its fairly the same idea.  I always did enjoy her cooking as a kid and even though wrappers to absorb plenty of grease this is a simple recipe that creates a fantastic finger food.

I like to add green onion, lots of fresh garlic (crushed) as well as the powder, and I use pork/beef combo going heavier on the pork.  And of course wonton wrappers :)

Good recipe.  Simple and enjoyable if maybe a little unhealthy haha.

Delicious! I would cut back on the salt, though. I used gyoza wrappers and had tons of leftover filling (probably more than half), so I would either buy 2 packages gyoza wrappers, or make half the filling if you wanted to go that route. They were great little bite sized yummies for us to have while opening Christmas presents!

We loved them.  I used all beef, no carrots, and did not add the salt to the meat mixture.  I did add 1 1/2 cups of slaw mix  that I "salted" the slaw mix.  I used 2 teaspoons salt and mixed it into the slaw.  I put the salted slaw into a colander, allowing it to drain for about 30 minutes and then rinsed very, very, very well.  Served it with Mai Ploy Sweet Chili -- available at most supermarkets.

I discovered lumpia on a Taste Made segment and decided it was something I'd like to try. This recipe is the closest I could find to the recipe from the TV show. It *is* time consuming, but by the time I completed the thirty or so lumpia rolls, I had the hang of it. I went to an Asian store because I really wanted the authentic lumpia wrappers. I didn't realize how amazingly thin these wrappers are. Though they are difficult to work with until one has some experience, the light pastry turns out very well once deep fried. Please note: the amount of salt called for is quite high. I will probably reduce the salt volume to 1 tablespoon at the most the next time I make these. One other tip: Once the grease reaches it's target temperature, turn it down slightly because the temperature will keep increasing with each batch that you fry. With too much heat, you run the risk of burning the lumpia. One final note: the recipe does not state whether one sautes the mixture before placing it in the lumpia wrappers. I did. I was concerned that raw sausage and ground beef may not fully cook if I didn't saute it before loading the mixture in the lumpia wrappers.  I'm anxious to try this recipe again with other ingredients. I have another thirty wrappers in my freezer. I highly recommend this recipe; it's well worth the inconvenience of tracking down the lumpia wrappers.

The basics on this recipe is great, but to the novice you need to be specific on spring roll wrappers. DO NOT use Vietnamese spring roll wrappers as they will not brown. I guess there are regular spring roll wrappers....we'll see.

Great recipe, we added more shredded cabbage and carrots to make the rolls heartier. We used Badia All Seasoning which is the same thing as the Adobe Badia All Seasoning. Delicous and tasty.

Very good, however the soy sauce flavor was a tad overwhelming. The next time I made it I used 1/8 instead of a 1/4 C and added an additional carrot as only one seemed lost after cooking. My grocery store did not have spring roll wrappers, so I used egg roll wrappers. Not traditional, but came out nicely cooked after three minutes in a 375 degree deep fryer. Served with Thai sweet chili sauce. I made this for a housewarming party and they were a big hit! My family also loves them.

This is an easy recipe reminder of how to make lumpia.  I made it over 30 years ago when I was 12 with a friend of my mom's.  I remember using ground beef and we didn't add any salt.  A friend said, "You don't have to cook the meat because the frying cooks it."  However, I remember my mom's friend cooked the meat before we fried it.  I think the hardest part is rolling them up.  Give yourself time to roll them!  They are so worth it!  Even the ones that open during frying are delicious.  None are ever left on the platter when they are served!

I made this for a baby shower.  Doubled the pork, omitted the beef and the salt.  It easily made 60 lumpia (I also cut the wrappers in half) and I could have made another 60 if I had more wrappers.  So either double up on the wrappers or cut the recipe in half.  I served it with sweet chili sauce found in any Asian supermarket.  They were devoured in no time!  Awesome recipe.  Can't wait to make again.

I lived in the Philipines for a few months and this was my favorite snack food. I tweaked the recipe a little by using part of a package of coleslaw mix and fresh bean sprouts for some added crispness and did not add the salt. It was delicious.

It's a good base recipe but I agree with kiko150, insanely salty. :/ I realized as I was pouring in the soy sauce that, in addition to the table salt it already asked for, something just wasn't right... and sure enough on my first test try egg roll it was super salty. Good thing I had only put maybe half the soy sauce and salt at this point, and managed to salvage it by adding another cup of carrots, but it's still a bit salty for my tastes. In my opinion if you can't eat them by themselves it's no good; I couldn't eat them without rice and drenched in sweet chili sauce. I suggest omitting the table salt completely and just do soy sauce? Whatever less than a 1/4th but more than 1/8th a cup is lol. But as I said it's a good base recipe :) I only had two pounds of pork but it still came out delicious, will definitely try half and half next time. Oh I also added finely minced green onions, maybe three or four sprigs.

Recipe is great. TIP: before rolling the lumpia fry up a quarter size of your meat  mixture to taste seasoning level. Adjust if needed.

I have made these many times but I knew the salt ingredient was an error. I also love making them using shrimp instead of meat  and dipping them in Asian sweet chili sauce.  The problem is you want to fry them and eat them right away.  Can't make them fast enough for company.

made these today they were a hit, I couldn't find spring roll wrappers so I also had to use egg roll wrappers, made 32 and had lots of filling left over, went to rest for a few came back upstairs and all but two were gone. so I guess they were a hit

Delicious!  I substituted Johnsonville Italian Sausage for the ground beef and it added a nice flavor.  Yummy!

This recipe is good but called for way too much salt!  Next time I'll be sure to use a little less, but otherwise it turned out great!

I'm by no means a Filipino cuisine cook, but I had some wonton wrappers to use up.  I know this recipe calls for spring roll wrappers but....why not?  These were good, though greasy.  Maybe the wrappers aren't recommended due to the amount of grease they soak up.  Anyway, worth trying!

Was not good at all, many people gave high rating, I dont know why. This is not a recipe I would try again. I suggest only pork no beef as it changes the REAL LUMPIA taste and burns the oil. Suggest alittle small sliced cabbage to each lumpia and more black pepper

Unbelievably tasty!!! I cut back on the salt, but that was the only change I made. Outstanding flavor and very easy to make. I think this has definitely made the dinner rotation in my house!!!

It was a bit too 'meaty' for me...I'm more used to springrolls with more veggetables in it and more spice... Next time I'll try substitue half of the meat for bamboo shoots or vermicelli...

I didn't really follow the measurements of the liquid portion of the ingredients to the exact number (I didn't want to taste the uncooked meat) so I had my dad put in whatever he thought was necessary. Anyhow, it was a big hit in the house. I prefer cutting the lumpia wrappers in 4's to make bite size lumpias so you can just pop em in your mouth.

This was a great recipe, although I recommend not adding any salt because the soy sauce makes up for it.

Mmmm!  Only thing I'd do is reduce the salt, we had to add 1/2 lb of meat to make it taste less salty.  Hubby loves this recipe and it was so easy and quick to make!!  We'll definitely make this again.
