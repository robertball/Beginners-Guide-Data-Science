Easy recipe and good results.  I did change some things though.  I made this with an Oreo crust instead of a Graham cracker crust, ignored the glaze, and I added mashed banana to the mix.

I had a smaller pan so I made some cupcake sized ones.  My son loved the cupcake ones so much we made another batch but only cupcakes.  They were delicious.
