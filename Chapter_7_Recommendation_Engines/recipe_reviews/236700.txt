This was divine!  I added mushrooms and small white potatoes and instead of simmering on the stove for 90-120 minutes after all ingredients were added, I put it in the oven at 325ยบ for 2.5 hrs covered, than .5 hrs uncovered.  The meat just melted in my mouth and the vegetables sopped up all the wonderful flavors as well.  I will be making this my go-to dish for the winter!

This was amazing. I usually make Julia Childs recipe every year on the anniversary of her birthday, but I was strapped for time this year..... It is an all day recipe. This was so much simpler, but was just as good. I did add sauteed mushrooms, omitted the celery,  used Merlot, and after simmering , put the covered Dutch oven in a 325 degree oven for 3 hours. Served with buttered egg noodles and green beans. This is definitely a keeper!

I made this in the slow cooker.  I cut the roast into about 6 pieces instead of chunks and browned them, then sauteed the onions and mushrooms then added the merlot and cooked that down.  Put it all in the crockpot for 8 hours on low and it was phenomenal.  Don't skip the browning and reducing of the merlot though.  I added fresh mushrooms with the carrots, celery and thyme sprigs.  I did remove about half the liquid with a ladle after 8 hours and put it in a saucepan on the stove and  thickened it up quite a bit with a  water/flour slurry.  This step was key.  I added the (very thick) mixture back to the crock pot (knowing it would mix in with the remaining liquid), added a bit of salt and several dashes of worcestershire and cooked for another 30 minutes or so.  Beef was so tender and the flavor was just wonderful.  Keeper!

Husband and I both loved this. Used dried thyme because I didn't have fresh and added a can of chopped mushrooms with the carrots and celery because we like mushrooms. Served over wide egg noodles. Wonderful flavor and even better leftovers the next day.  Good job Chef John.

Delicious! Added mushrooms as well. Offered it over garlic mashed potatoes OR mashed ruttabegga (mashed with butter, cream, salt and white pepper). Both were lovely!

One star for question. Has anyone tried this in slow cooker? I have a Ninja and it has stove top settings, as I can brown meat and saute, then can stay on stove top setting or switch to slow cook, which I prefer.  If suitable to do, how long on slow cook? (low or high)Thanks for your help.

Found! The most delicious Beef Stew recipe ever! Look no further. Delicious and easy! .Added mushrooms and small potatoes.. Tasted sauce as I put it in my roasting pan to place in 325 degree oven and I knew it was a winner - yummy yummy. Super great - meat very tender, tastes and smells heavenly. I will only make stew this way using Chef John's recipe from now on.

Great dish!  Served on a bed of mashed potatoes.  Baked covered at 350 degrees for 2-1/2 hours.  Added 8 ounces of quartered mushrooms.  Then baked for 1/2 hour uncovered.

Very good and flavorful! The meat was fork tender! I added mushrooms which were good and the carrots were little flavor bombs! I wish I had added more! This is definitely a keeper!

The trick is to add plenty of merlot and really reduce it well. The gravy made itself and it was silky smooth.

One word - delicious! Made as directed, sampled it for my review, and then added some sauteed mushrooms at my husband's request. This was pure comfort food. I served it over mashed potatoes with homemade artisan bread. Yum!

Added frozen pearl onions and mushrooms with the veggies.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  It was so delicious and will make it again.

This was awesome!  My first attempt at a French-style recipe. I subbed pork butt for the beef and used chicken stock.  It came out spoon tender. The sauce was delicious. My family was pleased and impressed!

this is good!  I started the process in the Dutch oven with browning the meat and then reducing the merlot then after that I finished it in the slow cooker on higher for 4 hours. Then I took all the juice (broth) and put it back in the Dutch oven and reduced it some more then returned it to the slow cooker. I added mushrooms at the end and let them cook right before we served it over a bead of garlic mashed potatoes and garnish it with carrots that I browned with honey and agave , and parsley. It was a slam dunk! Hands down on of the best meals that I have ever made. Itโs not too often that I can give myself credit but this time, it turned out perfect!!

This dish tasted amazing. I followed the recipe fully except I made my own beef broth and finished it with a little corn starch to thicken it up a bit more. Highly recommend.  Thank you!

This is so good. I added lentils  because I didn't have any celery and it needed something else. Definitely serve over homemade creamy garlic mashed potatoes. I will be making again soon and passing on the recipe. Better than stew!

I didnโt add vegetables; used mushrooms instead. Four star is due to length of prep. Think Iโll try slow cooker recommendations from others.

I would not make this again.  Followed the recipe as written and honestly it was slightly flavorless, and the meat was WAY to tough.  Probably could have added an additional hour at LEAST to the cooking time.  In addition, 3 out of 4 family members had late night cramping after consuming this......

I used a slow cooker and the dish came out delicious. I cooked on high for 4 hours. I also added garlic, mushrooms, and potatoes to make it a full meal. Will definitely make again.

Easy and delicious. Only made minor changes: I did not remove the meat from the pan. Instead, I just added the onion and flour to the meat mixture, and added mushrooms ( just because). Replaced fresh thyme with 1 tsp dried thyme. Served over mashed cauliflower. 

I will definitely be making this again.
I made it again, on Christmas Eve; this time for a crowd of more than 20 people. I tripled the recipe and served it with about 7 pounds of mashed potatoes. Next time I will make 10 lbs of mashed potatoes. Again, I used generous amount of dried thyme 2-1/2 to 3 tsp; 6 cups of 19 Crimes red blend, 3 pounds of carrots, and 3 chuck roasts. I browned the meat in 3 seperate batches in my wock, and then sweated the onion, and cooked 1 pound of mushrooms and the flour before mixing everything together in a dutch oven and simmering it for about 2-3 hours.  Yuuuummm! It was a huge hit with my guests. Thank you, Chef John, for this incredibly easy and delicious recipe.

Insanely good and easy.  I've made Julia Child's recipe and I dare say this one's better.  I used pearl onions and bone broth as my only changes and simmer it in the oven at 325 for two hours.  Served with mashed potatoes and crusty bread.   This ones a keeper, and easy.    I still can't believe how good it was, and I don't even drink merlot, hate it in fact.  But it works in this dish.

I cant  say I made this, because I made it with chicken. It came out really fine. I chopped some garlic with the onions. And I half cooked the carrots before adding the chicken into the broth. Serving it with mashed potatoes.

This is a wonderful recipe as is and can easily accommodate your add ins, mushrooms, cloves of garlic, small new potatoes, etc..  We've served over both mashed root vegetables and egg noodles.

This was a good recipe. Great flavors~My husband and I enjoyed it though my  digestive system wasn't so sure. Don't know why!   I Used a red moscato.  served over mashed potatoes, but leftovers were better next day and we enjoyed it even more over rice.
I'll make it again if hub asks me to.

I used a shiraz cabernet (open already), added sliced mushrooms, excluded celery (none on hand), used dried thyme, and a bit of beef boullion. Served with a buttered baguette. Simple to make. Very tasty.

The quality of the stew was good. I don't typically cook with wine and I absolutely hate the taste of it. I tasted the wine while I was cooking this and what I found was the undertones of the wine really came out in this dish. If I knew my wines I would know which one I prefer to cook with.  Husband and son went straight for the hot sauce... I'll stick to roast.  The flavor of the added veggies was excellent but I would have preferred a different undertone. I used a really cheap bottle of Merlot not knowing any better (it all tastes the same to me lol)

My husband loves Stew and I normally hate it, but this was the best EVER.  I did make some changes and  added a packet of Onion Soup Mix and Garlic with the carrots and celery and put some chopped potatoes in  near the end.   I also cooked it on the stove for 2 hours.  This  pot won't  make it to tomorrow night!!!!  Made  some rice and croissants on the side.  PERFECT DINNER!  Thank you!!!!!!

This was excellent, made it using a sweet red wine instead of the merlot (it was the only red we had available) and it was flavorful and rich. We used fresh herbs and served it with scalloped potatoes, everyone had seconds! Fortunately, enough to save for small bites leftovers.

Positively delicious! Have made this two times, the second for a dinner party. My sauce did not thicken in the last phase of cooking so I used corn starch. This is an excellent and easy-to-prepare recipe.

Thanks once again Chef John. In my old age you are making a cook out of me! Used your basic steps, added things I like and it was really really good. I have tried making stew several ways and somehow it was always kind of bland. 

I am so appreciative of all your videos. Someday I will figure out your love of that Cayenne Pepper. lol

Delicious!  Very easy prep (and quick to get going).  Just give yourself enough time to allow it to simmer and thicken.  I added some cornstarch during the last 30 min. to help with the thickening.  I served this over mashed potatoes as suggested and loved it!

Great recipe!! I actually did not have a Dutch over so I used a regular large pot, and it worked really well. I just had to brown the meet very rapidly, but it worked really well, loved it! Will try again later for sure!
