This is a great pie!  The only thing is that it needs to cook a little longer than the recipe says. I made a second pie the same night, because the first one was so good. The brown sugar topping adds just the right amount of sweetness.

This was very delicious. It turned out well, the topping really makes the pie. Would make it again.

This was the first pie I ever made and it was awesome! I used another recipe for the crust but the filling was incredible.I let the coconut topping broil a  little longer than specified in this recipe to get a crunchy topping. My whole family loved it. A+++ recipe!

Made this pie for Easter this year. My dad loves, loves, loves coconut custard pie and said this was one of the better ones he has ever tasted. We used 4 Jumbo Eggs, 1 teaspoon vanilla and 1 teaspoon almond extracts. Used 2 cups milk/cream (1 cup coconut milk, 1/2 cup heavy cream & 1/2 cup 2% milk) instead of 2 1/2 cups total. Also used a little over 1 cup of coconut in the custard and left the topping at 1/2 cup and baked in a deep dish pie pan. It did take approx 40 min to bake and had to cover the crust after 25 minutes to prevent burning. Excellent and everyone really enjoyed it. Will make this one every Easter! Thanks for sharing.

Ok, so I made a few changes... But only to tweak what I think was already a great recipe.  First, I added an extra yolk in the custard mix, only because I wanted to "paint" the unbaked crust with egg white before I filled it, as another reviewer had suggested, (but then I forgot to do that).  I also substituted one-quarter tsp of almond with for equal amount of the vanilla, to subtly enhance the coconut flavor.  Because I had it in the fridge already, I used a quarter-cup of heavy cream in the milk.  Oh ... I also did not use the broiled topping ... just didn't think it needed it ... but I think the next time I will sprinkle the filled crust with a healthy dose of coconut before sliding the pie into the oven.  My custard nicely filled a deep-dish pan and needed about ten extra minutes of baking time to come out perfect.  Thanks for this great recipe!

This was very yummy! Everyone loved it.  I did have a few technical issues.  I reduced the milk to 2 cups and even with leaving some filling out it spilled over my deep dish pie crust.  I had trouble getting it to set.  I think I would try maybe 1.5 cups of milk next time.  My crust started to burn while trying to cook it longer.  The topping was easy to make and made the pie.  Very unique.

We've tried several coconut custard pies, and this one is our favorite.  The topping really makes it!  (just be careful to watch the pie as you broil the topping, as it burns quickly).

My family loves coconut custard pie but I don't.  After many requests for it, I finally gave in and baked this for Christmas.  Everyone loved it!  I had several requests for the recipe and loads of compliments.  Thanks for this great recipe!

Taste and texture are BAR NONE, the best I've ever had, much less made myself!  I did have to cook the pie an additional 10-15 minutes at a lower temp (350) until the custard set.  I will add a little more coconut to the custard next time, and I will make sure the pie is refrigerated for many hours before broiling the topping and serving.  I enjoyed the topping *very* much.  The brown sugar adds a little different flavor to a pie that can be "boring".  Loved it!

more like...Egg Souffle Pie!, the custard was not sweet enought, even with sweetened coconut flakes. Texture was like a "perfect" scrambled eggs. just not what i expected shouldve. i've made custard pie before but this one was just not creamy enought, even after i omitted 1/2 cup milk for heavy cream. although the brown sugar coconut topping was a nice touch, i will be adding the topping to my usual custard pie recipe, probably won't make this one again. sorry :(

Could NOT wait to make this and then could NOT wait to eat it and now can NOT wait to make it again and share it with my entire clan!!  This is absolutely spectacular.  I made NO changes except baked about 5 minutes longer - perhaps oven variation.  LOVE coconut so lined pie crust with extra coconut and added just a bit more than recipe called for AND used coconut milk equal parts with whole milk in recipe.  OMG this recipe is such a keeper!!

A few changes: 2 C only coconut milk instead of regular milk. 1 C coconut in mixture, 1 C on top! Don't burn top! It broils SO QUICK!!! YUMMY. Made for my father-in-laws birthday-his favorite! It was GONE!!

My first coconut custard pie and certainly not my last. I've made four and they all came out delicious. This is a great simple recipe. Yes custard can be intimidating because no one wants to over cook custard. But as long as you pay attention and are mindful of how your oven bakes you wont have any problems with this recipe. Awesome. Thank you

It's cooling so I haven't had a chance to taste it yet.  I might suggest using a 9" or even a 10" pie pan.  Luckily, I put a cookie sheet under it and that caught a lot of run over which would have made a BIG mess in my oven.

The custard was delicious.  Excellent coconut flavor and nice creamy custard.  The topping does really make it, so don't skip that step.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because my pie crust came out soggy.  I used a frozen crust and there was liquid at the bottom of the pan that made the crust too wet.  I don't know if that is due to the crust I chose or if i did something wrong.  I would definitely try this recipe again.

The milk was way too much for my standard deep dish pie. It turned out curdled. Not smooth at all. The toasted coconut everyone raved about ain't all that. Nothing special at all since most of it just comes off the top.

I make this pie often.  Everyone raves about it, especially the delicious topping. The only changes I have made are: add 1/2 cup less milk and bake about 40 minutes.

i don't like coconut custard pie, but my family does and i made this for them.  they loved it.  one guest was calling dibs on the remainder of the pie after his first bite, so it was way better than the store bought shoprite brand that my family usually has.  thanks for a great recipe.

The taste was great, I was disappointed that there was way more custard than coconut.  Next time I will reduce custard, and increase coconut. Love the crispy top!

I though this was pretty good.  Next time I'll make my own pie shell... :)
I put a little more coconut in the pie just cuz I like it  Turned out great. Also, I had to use two pie shells...maybe that's just cuz the ones I used were kinda shallow. Who knows! :)
Thanks!

Awful.  I followed this recipe to a tee- the night before Thanksgiving.  It needed 10 more minutes, like other reviews said.  Then I put it in to broil the top for 2 minutes and the entire pie burned to a crisp.  My husband and I tried a slice with the burnt edges/top removed and found the custard to be runny.  Two thumbs down.  Awful, awful.

This was a great tasting pie. I served it for Thanksgiving last year & everyone said it was the best coconut pie they ever had. However I did need to increase the cooking time by approx 20 mins.

Yummy!  Cut milk to 2 cups and let it go longer, still wasn't quite as stiff as I like it but what a great flavor.  My husband loved this pie!

This pie was delicious! I added about 1/4 cup finely chopped pecans to mixture and poured into two 8-inch pie crusts. It didn't look very pretty, so I didn't expect my (very visual) husband to eat it. However, he tasted it and loved it- then, went back for seconds!

This is a very nice pie but a little loose for my taste so I used evaporated milk instead.  One can of reg. & 1 can of fat free with an extra 1/2 tsp. of vanilla.  It became a 5 star rating.

Have made many recipes for coconut custard pie over the years, and this is by far everyone's favorite. The topping is fantastic. Bake it in a deep dish pie plate to avoid spillover issues. BEST PIE EVER!

Very good but sweet. Might want to cut back on the sugar a little bit. The coconut and brown sugar topping makes it to sweet or use unsweetened coconut on top

My picky father in law loves coconut custard and I made this for him for father's day.  Everyone thought it was the best pie they've ever had.  The last touch with the sugar and coconut definitely put the icing in the pie!

Glad I read other peoples comments.  Cooking time was definately wrong.  I had to double the cooking time.  Plus, no one liked the topping.  The next time I made this I did not use the topping and used light cream instead of milk.  It was much better.

This recipe was very easy to make. Maybe I expected more from all the rave reviews but I think it lacked something and I am not sure what that is. It was good but, again, I guess I expected more in the way of taste which was kind of bland.

I was kind of leery of this recipe.  Especially since I couldn't find my other 9" pie plate and had to use the 12".  I snuck a small piece out (before adding the topping) and thought 'Meh'.  But the topping totally makes this yummy!  It's crunchy and sweet, smells heavenly, and everyone at our shindig loved it. This was really simple to put together.  There's not much call at our home for coconut anything, but it's something I can take to parties with confidence.  Thanks!

Very tasty! I added a little extra coconut and left the pie in the oven about ten minutes longer than the suggested cook time. I thought it was better tasting the next day, after it had time to set more.

This pie was creamy and delicious.   I made the following changes after reading other comments:  I used 1 cup coconut milk and 1 cup half and half instead of 2 cups milk and also added a 1/4 tsp of almond extract.  I agree this enhanced the coconut flavor and also, I think,added sweetness.   After cooling, I refrigerated the pie for a few hours before the final step.  I kept the shelf in the center of the oven when broiling and it browned perfectly.  Thanks so much!

I followed the recipe except for using one cup of milk and one cup of cream.  I was one of the folks that ended up with coconut quiche.  Perfect scrambled egg texture.  Ugh.  The filling wasn't sweet enough, even with sweetened coconut.  The topping was great!  I will use it on other pies.

I made two pies and they look amazing and taste as amazing as they look. This was a partnership husband and wife baking in the kitchen together. I substituted the 2 1/2 cups of milk with 2 cups of coconut milk and 1/4 whole milk.. I used frozen pie shells and pre-baked them For four minutes before putting in the filling.

I made it exactly to recipe for the Super Bowl and it was good but needed more sweetness and coconut flavor.  The recipe didn’t specify sweetened or unsweetened coconut so I put in unsweetened.  I made it a second time with 1/4 c more sugar, sweetened coconut, and 1 tsp coconut extract.  I used unsweetened coconut for the topping

Only need 12 oz. of milk per pie...used evaporated milk. Put on cookie tray to bake. Did not use brown sugar and less salt .
Bake about 50 minutes at altitude. Watch it at 400 degrees. Then left to cool in warm oven  for 45 mins. with bake off...it cooked the middle that needed to firm up without burning the crust.
I used gf pie crusts. 
Reminds me of Grandmom Addari's coconut custard pies for the holidays.  Yum

Delightful custard recipe. I used a pre-made gluten free crust, doubled the coconut (unsweetened) and did not use the topping, as I did not want the extra sugar. I also needed about 8 extra minutes to get it firmed up. Great recipe, will definitely make this one again.

Everyone loved it....none left.  I overflowed the shell and the egg mixture covered the crust edge, but actually made it better.  I would recommend putting the empty pie shell on the oven rack and slowly adding the mixture. It's hard to cat without spilling.

Made this today. It's already been requested for Easter. Did what other reviewers suggested and used a bit more coconut and less milk. This pie, omg so good.

This pie is delicious.  I cut back a half cup of milk so the filling would fit into the crust, that was the only change. I couldn't rate a recipe if I made up my own. Coconut Custard Pie 11 is on reserve.

This recipe was a hit with my family and at the local library pie sale.  Picture perfect topping.  Wish I had taken photos. I followed the directions but had to cook longer and lowered the temp to 350 until the filling was cooked.

I really liked this pie. My sister made a homemade crust and I made the filling. Overall, it was delicious! Don't worry if its watery before you put it into the oven, it'll harden. Also for the coconut topping, I added just a little less than it required. Thank you Ellen, for posting this recipe. I'll be sure to make it again soon! ~Baker101

I don't really cook much but I wanted to make something special for my Mom on Mother's Day. I found this recipe and "wah - lah"! Now I'm a cook! I used two 9" pie shells and cooked each at 20 minutes with extra coconut in the filling, and a little less milk and sugar. Came out wonderful! THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SHARING!

The pie came out well but needed double the baking time.  In the end, I would have prefer a slightly thicker custard as it was a bit wet. The topping is what really makes the pie.  I will try and use half coconut milk next time as I heard this works well.
