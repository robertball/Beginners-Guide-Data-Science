This is a great recipe. I added a layer of scrambled eggs in the middle. It adds some height and color. I also used roasted red peppers instead of banana peppers.

labor intensive but well worth it!  a healthy slice is practically a meal. the classic combo of prosciutto, spinach and provolone make this a delicious treat.

I would probably add more prosciutto next time. Very good though.

This was good, but had a strong salt flavor, I'm assuming from the proscuitto.  Definitely not a once-a-month meal, more like every 6 mo or so. Next time I think I'll mix some cream cheese into the spinach to make it creamier as well as adding some sliced mushrooms.

A little expensive to make, but tastes great! Warmed the leftovers on medium heat in a skillet for lunch the next day. It gets better as it sits!

I wanted to like this, but something just wasn't quite right ... it was best right out of the oven, the leftovers were unappealing to me.  Won't make again.

I made no changes.  It was way too salty.  I would probably  not make it again because it was so much work and tasted like a glorified ham and cheese sandwich.
