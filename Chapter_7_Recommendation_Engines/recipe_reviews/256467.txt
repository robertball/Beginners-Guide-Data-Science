Another great recipe. Takes a little extra time than usual morning coffee but worth the effort. I substituted kosher salt for sea salt as that's what I had. Delicious again. Thx Allrecipes

Very bad. Tasted like bland butter in a cup with some salt.

I was excited to make this, but it really didn't have a great flavor. Too salty and no caramel taste at all. Couldn't drink even half of it.
