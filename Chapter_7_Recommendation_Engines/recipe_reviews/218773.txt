This was very good for a quick meal! I tweaked it to suit our tastes! I used 3 boneless chicken breasts cut into strips. I doubled the olive oil using 1 Tbls. to brown the chicken and 1 Tbls. to sauté the veggies. I doubled the green pepper and used chicken broth instead of water. I used 3 cloves fresh garlic instead of jarred. I doubled the Spanish olives and the peas. And I cooked the peas with the rice instead of adding them raw on top at the end! The chicken was so tender and juicy with lots of flavor from the adobo and flavored yellow rice! I will definitely be making this more often!

This is a great quick and easy recipe for a speedy dinner. I will definitely make it  again for a quick mid week dinner. But my definite favorite arroz con pollo on this site is the Panamanian one with  the mixed olives , raisins fixed paella style.

I loved this recipe, though I found it a little over simplified for the actual steps needed.  Served with hot buttered Cuban bread and fried plantains; it makes for a well rounded, filling meal. I made it with 2 split chicken breasts and also cooked the olives and pimentos with the rice.

Very good, easy, and versatile. Didn't have adobe seasoning, so I seasoned chicken with garlic and onion powder, cumin, paprika, salt, and black pepper . I also added a 14 oz can of stewed tomatoes that I diced up. Rather than only green peppers I used some frozen mixed peppers (red, yellow, and green) that I diced up. Instead of both pimentos and stuffed green olives, I just used the stuffed olives since they already had pimentos in them. However I sliced them into thirds and cooked them in the pot with everything else instead of just placing them on top of the finished dish. Same goes for the frozen peas, I cooked them along with everything else too. As for the chicken I used a couple boneless, skinless breasts. After seasoning them I cut them into small cubes then quickly sauteed them prior to adding them into the pot with everything.. I diced half a yellow onion and sauteed it with the peppers before adding the chicken. For the rice I used another brand of  yellow saffron rice since our local store does not carry the Goya brand, and I used chicken broth rather than water. Once everything was almost completely finished cooking I added a couple table spoons of sherry, and the bit of juice that was left over from the can of stewed tomatoes, and I folded that into the entire mixture. basically just to give it some additional flavor. All in all it came out great and the entire family loved it, had seconds, and there wasn't a single grain of rice left!

This turned out delicious. We subbed in some yellow and red pepper for the green.  Made it even more colorful (and a bit easier to digest for those of us with green pepper issues.) We also vote 100 percent for using boneless thighs vs. breasts. Much  better flavor that way. The Goya Rice seems pretty important to eventual taste due to the blend of seasonings that add to the overall flavor, but we subbed the rest of the Goya ingredients for the brands we had on hand.

I've made this several times & We love it.  Pretty sure this recipe is foolproof!  I've used chicken breasts & boneless skinless thighs.  I season the chicken with whatever I have on hand .... seasoned salt, pepper etc.  i use chicken broth rather than plain water.  I usually add in a good handful of both frozen corn & frozen peas when I add the rice & water!   I serve it with parm cheese

This is my new go to one pot dinner. Added a spiced green pepper, fresh red bell and artichokes.  Used chicken tenderloin and added the Goya with black pepper as well as Sazon' Goya with the onions.  Trying white fish next time with muscles

Yes! I loved it, and I put my own spin on it, I used 3 chicken breasts, I had boiled the chicken so I didn't cook it in oil. I diced it up then cooked peppers and garlic then ; like one reviewer, I just used chicken broth and it really helped to bump up the flavor! I added Mexican chili powder and cilantro. I used red pepper strips since I didn't have pimentos and I opened a can of green chili peppers to go on top and it was amazing! And my picky son ate a serving and a half! My mother, who I do a lot of cooking for LOVED it!! She couldn't stop bragging! This will certainly be made again. Oh, I also call the the Ricky Ricardo dish since I can't say Arroz Con Pollo. LOL. He  loved for Lucy to make this on the show.
