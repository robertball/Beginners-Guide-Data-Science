Fabulous!  Refreshing and a little different from the norm.  Doubled the recipe and added a few jalepenos.  I let it sit over night and the flavors were great.  Wonderful recipe, will make again and again!

If you just add some imatation crab meat, this recipe will turn into Ceviche. Which is delicious on tostada shells for a fuller version. Try it, you'll love it!!!

This is addicting! Had to pull the bowl away from my hubby so he would leave room for dinner! I made it exactly as directed and we loved it. I think next time, I might add a bit of jalapeno since we like things a little spicy. Thanks witchywoman for sharing this recipe!

I made this recipe awhile ago, it was very good. But, I am making it again tonight and I thought I would use Pico De Gallo in it. instead of chopping up onion, tomatoes, cilantro. because Pico De Gallo is basically the same thing and its ready to just throw in. no chopping required. I think other viewers should try it, as well as Witchy Woman!

This is SOOOOO GOOD! I don't care for cilantro, so I used some parsley instead. Also, I didn't have any red onion on hand, but I did have green onions, so I just used those. I can't believe how these few simple ingredients could make such a wonderful salsa...YUM! YUM! YUM! I think next time I might try adding some finely chopped jalapeno for some extra kick.  Thank You, WW, for such an AWESOME recipe that I know I will be making often...hubby already informed me of that, lol! :)

I have mixed feelings on this one.  I thought it was good, but our guests barely touched it (and didn't comment on it at all...).  I think I will give it another go and see what we think next time.  One issue I do have is the salad shrimp.  Next time, I'll use *real* shrimp and chop them up for a better shrimpier taste. Thanks for a unique light take on salsa, WW!

Very, very nice.  I added a tad of jalapeno because I needed to use it and a bit of extra garlic because I LOVE it.  I had some grilled shrimp left over from the evening before and wow--it was so good in this dish.  Really healthy salsa!

Great recipe! I doubled it and thought maybe the lime juice was a little much, but i added extra garlic and it was perfect. Very light and refreshing- Thank you!

I could not find shrimp salad to save my life.  I called three butcher shops and every grocery store in my area!  So... I made this with a crab salad.  I'm sure it's different than how it should have tasted, but I thought it was still pretty good!

MMM MMM MMM good! Thankfully I had the fixings on hand when I had no idea what to do when I had some shrimp needing to use. TY...this was really really addicting. It totally hit the spot from the ordinary chip fixings. Was light and full of flavor from the cilantro and lime. My daughter asked after I mixed it up to add 2 avocados that I also had linguring around and between myself and 4 girls ranging from 10-15...it was almost polished off. Yummy yum!

I made this twice in the past week and it was gone in the blink of an eye. The only thing I did differently was to add one very large chopped jalapeno - other than that, this is perfect as is. I will definitely be making this on a regular basis. Also definitely let sit overnight so the flavors develop. Oh, I used Tostito's Scoops - I found the other scoops too hard.

This was great. I bought crackers to go with it thinking it would be better as a dip but it truly worked better as a salsa. 
Great as is. But I also tried it a little more spicy by putting about 1/2-1 jalapano chopped finely, finely diced alvacado and just a little tapitio to make the juices a little more flavorful. Either way, a nice, refreshing, cool snack.

Eaten for breakfast, lunch, and dinner on the 4th of July- we couldn't wait until it was "officially" time to serve!  Added in a bit of cumin and paprika, just because.

The whole family loved this! I used 2 kinds of shrimp and added imitation crab meat to it as well. We ate it with chips, in tortilla's, and just by itself. The recipe makes enough to feed an army! We ate it for day's and finally had to throw the rest away. Next time I will cut the recipe in half or maybe even into a 3rd...I will be making it again for sure though!

Can I give it 10 stars??!!  I just made this up for a quick appy tonight since we're getting company for dinner.  It is so fresh and delicious!!  It may not make it for an appy - I keep going back to the fridge for just another little taste. LOL   Love the lime juice and cilantro - Yummy!!

Excellent recipe! I added one jalopeno pepper, and may add horseradish next time. It was different, healthy and looked pretty. I doubled the recipe and it was gone in minutes! I used large sized shrimp and cut them and let it sit overnight. I served it with scoops. Great recipe, thanks witchy woman!

Well WW, this is a winner. The only change I made was to add a finely diced cucumber and half of a jalapeno. Beautiful to look at and a real hit with my guests. They all asked for the recipe :) Thanks again Witchywoman.

This is definitely a keeper!!  I've tried  making my own ceviche before, without any luck.  This is the closest to it yet!!!  The only thing I'd do is cut back on the salt.  Just seemed a little too much for our liking.  THANKS for such a great recipe!!

this was a great addition to our party.  i grilled regular size shrimp, the red onion and some jalepanos.  although i see now that that is not even on the recipe...oops....i doubled the recipe so it took a lot longer for me to make.  had a lot of compliments, light and tasty. i served with bite size torilla chips.  i can't wait to make this again with my fresh tomatoes from my garden.  thanks for the post WW!

I thought this was really good and my friends enjoyed it.  I followed the recipe exactly.  But I think it would be better with some personal touches!  For one thing I would add some celery and a fresh jalapeno even diced up avacado.  The salsa is really alot like shrimp cevichi.  I will make this again...

Why, oh, why??  Why did I wait so long to make this??  This is just so good!  So delicious!  I used jumbo shrimp cut into slices (we have a fish company close by that has the best fish!), and I did add a little fresh red jalapeno.  This is so good that I could easily just make a meal off of it!  Even a breakfast.  You could easily add those great little Persian cucumbers or celery, too.  Thanks, witchywoman!  I'll be making this again VERY soon!

Very simple, but delicious.  I used green onion instead of red and all else was the exact recipe.  Guests really enjoyed it.  I'll definitely make again.

This is the best.  I make it all the time.  I double the recipe, use larger cooked shrimp cut in half after removing tails.  Replace tomatoes with small can of rotel original tomatoes w green chilis (after discarding some of the juice), adds a little heat.  And I don't add the lime juice until rite before serving because I think it cooks the shrimp more and makes them a little tough.  Excellent recipe.  My guests always request it.

I had company tonight and was going to make shrimp cocktail as appetizer, but realized that I forgot to get the cocktail sauce.   I found your recipe and did the shrimp salsa instead and what a hit this was.   I will do this again and again.  It is refreshing and easy to make.  I served it with crackers and everyone raved about it.
Thanks for an excellent recipe
Diane

I am not a cook so use recipes that seem easy so I cant mess it up to badly =).  I used cooked shrimp and was not aware I needed to wash it to reduce the salt.  Ended up making a super salty salsa but I know next time will be a win.  Also add some Jalapeno and it will really rock.  Can anyone tell me what 1/2 red onion measures out to in cups?  I had a giant red onion to work with.

I made this for my husband, since he LOVES any kind of salsa! I took out the garlic and added imitation crab meat and some chopped avocado for a meatier flavoring.  I have made it several times, but this is the best combination!

This is fantastic!  I made it to take to an outdoor concert with friends and they couldn't get enough of it!  I used small shrimp and added 1/2 jalapeno - the only thing I would change would be to use the whole jalapeno next time.  This was the hit of the concert!  Thank you for sharing!

As advertised: very simple, very light and very refreshing. I want to give 4.5 stars because it is super as it is, but MY taste buds say that they expect just a little something extra. I emphasise that these are MY taste buds and would easily understand anyone rating this 5.

My original review is not showing up, so here is another one.  This is crazy good stuff!  I use large shrimp and dice them, other than that I follow the recipe as stated.  Everyone "inhales" this stuff like it's their job! Make this and get ready for the compliments!  Laurrie, thanks for sharing your awesomeness with us ;)

This salsa is wonderful.  I made it exactly as written except I used half fresh and half bottled lime juice as my fresh lime didn't provide me with as much lime juice as was needed.  This recipe tastes fresh and light and is really quite pretty to look at.  I think the recipe would be done a disservice if a yellow or white onion was used in place of the purple.  The purple onion makes it look lovely and gives so much more flavor than another color.  This is easy to make, inexpensive, and delicious,  it deserves so many more stars.

Amazing combination of flavours.  Have to be honest, didn't fully follow measurements.  Just eyeballed.  I did add corn kernels and half a Jalapeno.   I ate it for dinner with a cheese quesadilla and avocado slices.  MMM Will defiantly make again.

Yum! Great flavor...I'm not always crazy about cilantro, but you really need it here. I had to use frozen salad shrimp, next time I'm just going to chop up bigger shrimp that I cook myself. And there will definitely be a next time! I used tomatoes from my garden and probably cut the onion just a bit. I might add a bit of jalapeno next time because I do love heat, but honestly this is GREAT just like it is. Thanks, Witchywoman...wonderful recipe!!

I tweeked this recipe and like lots of us I hate to rate this when I tweeked....with Minimal alterations, first I used a large can of plain diced tomatoes, I used 1 lime for juice, and it had plenty of lime flavor can't imagine using 1/4 cup, and my shrimp I didn't have salad shrimp so just cut up bigger shrimp to small pieces and used vidalia onion and didn't use as much salt and did a dash of sugar. This was gobbled up by everyone and my family asked for this recipe to be a "Keeper".  The juice of the tomatoes I made myself a bloody mary, life was good.

This is really good. You could eat this with tortilla chips or tostada shells, but I usually serve it over a salad for dinner. You will enjoy it however you eat it.

This was pretty good.  It isn't the prettiest dish ever, so my guests were a little skeptical at first when I told them there was shrimp in the salsa, but after everyone tried it they unanimously agreed that it was tasty.

I love this stuff! I tweaked the recipe slightly. I doubled the tomatoes, onions, cilantro, and garlic. Added 1 pound shrimp and a half pound crabmeat. Added the juice from two and a half limes and salt and pepper to taste. Delicious. Wonderful on a hot day!

Yum! Had some left over shrimp and this was a great way to use it. Also used full size shrimp (not salad size), used a shallot instead of red onion, and added in a mild jalapeno from my garden. Would definitely make again.

This is an excellent recipe! I more then doubled it and am so glad I did- as the bowl emptied quickly! I didn't measure and just sort of estimated the amounts as I tossed stuff in the bowl. I did add 2 jalapenos and 2 diced avocados which think made this a 10 star recipe. I served it with chips- which next time, i will make sure i buy chips that are sturdy enough to hold this salsa as mine broke into little pieces.  Thanks so much for sharing a great recipe, this will be a regular addition to our rotation!

I made this as an appetizer for birthday dinner for a special friend. I added chunks of fresh avocado  just before serving. I set out rosemary flat bread for dipping and it was delicious. My friend then made it for a large Mexican Fiesta party and it was a huge hit. I think it would also make a nice main dish for a luncheon, if you served the shrimp salsa inside a halved avocado.

This is sooo good! I've made it several times and tastes great as is or with green onion instead of red and I also love to add red, yellow, or orange bell pepper.

Absolutely loved this, we did it without the onion though...very good and refreshing flavor. The freshly squeezed lime juice made it. Put it on baggette bread......also good on tortilla chips...
will make this again.

This was a hit!  Everyone loves it and it is all we have been eating for the past 2 days!  I followed the recipe exactly.  The only extras I added were 1 diced Jalapeno (1/2 with seeds and 1/2 without) and 1 diced avocado.  Will be making this over and over again!  So fresh and light!

Great salsa!  Made this for our 4th of July party everybody loved it.  I doubled the recipe and added one jalapeno pepper......should have used two for a bit more zip.....also added a dab of lemon juice along with the lime juice.  Will make this salsa again.....might try adding a yellow/red pepper.

This is delicious!  My 9 year old helped my put this together.  We followed the directions as stated.  The amounts given are spot on for flavor.  We ate a good bit of it before we got it in the fridge to chill and it was good without letting it sit.  We will be making this again.  Thanks for sharing!

This was just fabulous!  Simple, but flavorful - especially after chilling for an hour or so.  Followed recipe exactly - I think next time I may add a little jalapeno, as I like a little heat, but the garlic and onion were very nice, too.  A bowl of this, a bowl of Black Bean and Avocado Salad and a bag of Tostito "Scoops", and we enjoyed a lovely light dinner out on the deck at sunset!  Thanks for the recipe! We will definitely make this one again!

It must be good because I keep getting requests. I am allergic to seafood yet I have made this recipe numerous times. I enjoy entertaining and I know many people love seafood. Therefore I like to have some seafood dishes which are easy to make and tasty. My friends love this one. It is extremely easy and does not require me to interact too much with the meat. Therefore there is minimal potential for allergic reaction. I gave it 5 stars since that is what most people say about it. Now when I attend showers or  events they request this dish.

I found the original recipe bland. I added (adjusted for your liking)
 ½ jalapeño diced 
 1 table spoon EVOO 
 1 table spoon red wine vinegar
 1 table spoon white vinegar
 ½ teaspoon cayenne pepper
 ½ teaspoon cumin seed/cumin
I also would use larger shrimp next time. I might even cook and season them myself and then chill them before hand. Although with some minor additions a good simple light recipe.

This is an awesome fresh salsa.  For those who love fish tacos you will love this.  I did add 1/2 seeded jalapeno for spice and 3 garlic cloves as we love garlic.   When I make this the next time I plan to use raw shrimp, cook, then dice.  I am not a big fan of salad shrimp as it does not have as much flavor as regular shrimp.

how can you go wrong with all of these ingredients!  I took this recipe and altered it by - adding fresh cooked diced shrimp, added some finely diced mango, red pepper, and just a bit of honey to counter the tartness of the lime. VERY good.

I saw several people looking for salad shrimp. What they are referring to is the canned shrimp that are very small. Instead, I used 1/2 pound of large frozen shrimp, cooked in the microwave until pink, about 1 minute, 30 seconds. I then cut the shrimp into bit sized pieces after cooling, cleaning and peeling. I also added 2 large stalks of celery and an avocado. Top it off with 1/4 cup sweet chili sauce for some extra zing. This disappeared in my house!

This was sooooo good! I had some small, already cooked shrimp that I wanted to use up in an appetizer, and made this. Yummmm!
Followed the recipe exactly, with one addition: as others have suggested, I minced up a little bit of jalapeño and tossed it in. That added just the right amount of heat. 
The fresh cilantro made this so tasty. Warning, though, 15% of the population taste soap when the eat cilantro, so my husband wouldn't even try it. But it is my favourite herb, so bring it on!

I also made this with the fake crab meat only because I was making grilled shrimp also.  It was a hit for father's day I actually doubled the recipe and it was ate up. The guys loved it. I will make it again with shrimp.

I made this for a birthday party. It was a huge hit! I added guacamole for extra texture and jalepenos. YUM!
I wanted a lighter (salad) than using a mayonnaise based shrimp salad.

This is the BEST.  I've made it 4 times in the last week.  I can't get enough of it.  It's great with tortilla chips or scoops and add avocado on top.  I'd give it 10 stars if I could. Yum!

This is the BEST shrimp salad I've ever tasted, as it is so refreshing.  Followed the recipe exactly, with only one addition which is garlic powder to taste.  Also the amount stated in the recipe is not enough for 12 servings.  Planning a get together next weekend, so will triple this recipe and serve it as an appetizer with the tortilla chip scoops.  Even the leftovers tasted great the next day.

Very refreshing with natural ingredients. Didn't change a thing except for adding the jalapeno pepper. My guests all gave this recipe high fives for the flavor. Easy to put together and I will use it again!

This was easy and delicious! Made to serve 6 (read that it fed 2!). Wanted  it a bit saucier so added 1/3-1/2 cup chili sauce. Served with tortilla chips and fresh baguette. Will make again.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Dear Wife & I made this just the other day. It was delicious and we made a double batch since we both like salsa & shrimp. Makes a great snack while watching tv.

Make this almost every week. I add a lot of jalapeño, cayenne pepper, and paprika because I like it spicy!

This was excellent.  No changes to the recipe are needed.  Next time I'll double the recipe though.  It disappears much too quickly.

Very mild and bland.  I am from Colorado, where things spice up a bit.  I added Tapatio hot sauce the first time.  Not hot, just more flavor.  The second time, I used a homemade salsa, drained so it was not watery, fresh lime juice (1 lime), a diced avocado.  Yumm!  Much better.  

Made for a nice light dinner with tortilla chips.

It was excellent , can't wait to make it again. However I had to make tomato modifications becuz i couldn't find ripe tomatoes around New Years, so I substituted fresh store bought salsa and a can of no sodium petit diced tomatoes and drained them.  I also used fresh sauted shrimp. 
Yum can't wait to make it again in the summer months.

Very easy to make.  Made the recipe as is, no extra spice.  Nice to have a more nutritious dip among all the other ones that aren't so healthy!

I used basil in stead of cilantro which was very good.  I am dieting and the WHOLE bowl of  salsa is worth 3 weight watchers points.  If you serve with Tostitos bite size chips, you can have 24 chips with salsa for 4 points.  The rest of the group loved it without realizing I had made it because of the low calories and no salsa was left by the time dinner was served.  Will definitely make again.

Okay... I had to add many dashes of hot sauce to kick it up a notch. Even after adding that and making sure there was plenty of salt, it was a little on the bland side. I would add jalapeños next time.

This recipe is awesome. When I made it, tho, my shrimp became mushy. I thought it may be from the lime juice "cooking" the shrimp more. I didn't see in the comments where anyone else had this problem. I want to make it again for an Easter app. Any ideas?

I rated it a 5 star recipe b/c it was easy, very tasty, fresh, zing-y, and unique.  I had avocado on the side which was perfect with home baked corn chips (soft corn tortillas baked at 400).  The recipe creator, Witchy Woman, said to add chopped cuke to it next time, which I will try. Thanks WW!
