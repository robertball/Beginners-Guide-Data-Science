This is a delicious recipe which is easy to make.  I chose to substitue Tzatziki sauce (also from allrecipes) for the oil and vinegar dressing, which I served on the side. I also added kalamata olives.  It was great!

I agree that oil is too much though this is quite common for the Greek cuisine. In any case, it needs to be olive oil if you are looking for some Greek twist to it. And there is no need to seed the cucumber - it;s never seeded in Greece (though I guess there might be some difference between the products available in different parts of the world - are cucumbers so ripe that you need to seed them?)

This is a good basic recipe for Greek salad.  I will agree with other reviewers that the dressing proportions are way out of whack. I used olive oil in a 50/50 ratio with red wine vinegar and some mustard, oregano, salt and pepper.

purple onion would have added color, but I didn't have one and used a yellow onion.  Just as good.  I added a  1/2 bunch chopped fresh italian parsley just before I added the dressing.  And used calamata olives (drained and sliced).  And 1/4c VOO and 1/4c veg. oil instead of all veggy oil

I made this for 200 people and it turned out wonderful! I didn't have peppers or white vinegar so I used red wine vinegar instead, I also used kalamata olives with it! It was perfect! Everyone loved it!!

Great!  I used olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  Hit the spot in the middle of winter!

Happy I found this recipe. It was HUGE and hardly any was left.  Yummy.  And I'm not always a fan of salads.

I use whole grape tomatoes, sliced black olives and bottle Greek Feta & Oregano dressing by Kraft along with cucumbers and crumbled or shaved Feta cheese.  Leave out green peppers but use red, yellow, orange and red.  Can also substitute red onion for diced white.

If you use balsamic vinegar with this and 1/8 tsp crushed aniseed, it will have that authentic "Greek" taste you get in a good restaurant.  Think I'm going to have this salad for dinner tonight!

What a great salad. I used the lite Italian dressing on AR in lieu of the oil and vinegar. I also used some fresh parsley and oregano. I didn't have any Feta so subbed Parmesan cheese, also threw in an avocado that needed to be used when I served it. Very lite yet chock full of flavor...actually the salad is great with no dressing. This one is a keeper.

I made a half of batch of this without the olives.  I did cut the oil and vinegar way back than what is called for.  I only used 2 TB of each for a half a recipe and it was perfect.  The first time I made this, as written, the salad was swimming in liquid.  The flavors of this salad are very good, and it is very pretty with all the colors.  I like to sprinkle the feta on right before serving, so that it doesn't break down.  This was served with 'Chicken Paprika' from AR.

Amazing! The only thing I changed was using red wine vinegar and did about 1/2 and 1/2 it with the olive oil. I took it to a dinner last night and it was a huge hit!

What a great 'n easy salad!  I didn't have white wine vinegar so I used red wine vinegar instead and I only used 1/3 C oil rather than 1/2 C ... and because I love olives you can bet that I used lots more!!  Overall, I think our family has a new addiction!

Recipe looks great until I saw the vegetable oil.  Change that to a good virgin olive oil and you have a winner.

I made a lot of changes to the recipe. I used olive oil with pomegranate vinegar, and in greater proportions of vinegar to oil. I cut up English cucumbers and halved grape tomatoes, more kalamata olives, and every color bell peppers. Plus oregano and red onion.

I agree with most reviewers, and used Olive oil (virgin) and lemon juice instead of vinegar. I used an english cucumber which doesn't need to be seeded, however, I find field cucumbers do, as the seeds are big and after a day or so make things slimmy. Nice fresh salad. Thanks for sharing!

This was definitely easy, as advertised. I just wish the dressing had a bit more flavor. Still, it's a good base recipe that I'll keep in the repertoire and tweak in the future.
