Better than Jamba Juice's Orange Dream, cheaper and faster too.  I love it and have it every morning now!

good, but not much flavor, just a hint of banana.

In order to make this tasty, I added real orange segments, reduced the honey (2T is perfect, 3 = too much), and added a few splashes of real cream.  With a title like orange cream drink, you have to add real cream!  Docked it a few stars for not using orange wedges and cream.  DO NOT use your grocery store OJ in a carton!  You want a creamy, fresh squeezed orange taste!  Tasted like FOUR STARS with my revisions!

I thought this was really good, even using OJ from a carton.  Nice creamy taste without the extra fat of real cream.  Only change was I used 1 T honey and it was plenty sweet for me, although I'm sure some people would like it sweeter.

This is nice and creamy.  I didn't have apple juice, so I put in a whole granny smith apple after par-cooking it in the microwave to bring out the full flavor.  I used 2 tbsp of honey, though next time I might even go with 1 tbsp - it's quite sweet.  And I'll try it with extra banana and/or less orange juice next time as the banana flavour is pretty well lost.  I seldom have yogurt in the house so it's nice to have the makings for a smoothie without it.

This was a blast of flavor! It was fairly good even though it was a little sweet for my liking
