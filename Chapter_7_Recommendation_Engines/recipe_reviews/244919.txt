I found this on the sweet side. I used fresh frozen pineapple that I had previously frozen and I'm thinking maybe that was why it was sooo sweet? Or maybe it was sooo sweet because of the fruit punch concentrate? I didn't really care for the flavor combo and it is not something I would consider making again. Regardless, thank you for sharing.
