Made this a couple nights ago for 8 people.  Incredible!  I marinated the chicken for almost 20 hours so it was very flavorful and didn't dry out.  All of it was gone very quickly, and even a few days later people are still telling me how good it was.  Thanks, this is a new favorite!

I added a little brown sugar to balance the salt from the soy sauce. I also just baked it and did not bread the chicken. This recipe was prepared for about 45 people, when dinner was over there was only 2 chicken strips left. I will make this again.

Yuck.  This recipe was like eating sand flavored with orange juice. 30 minutes at 375 is way too long, when you include browning.

My rating scale (cause number of stars is subjective): 1-Didn't like it, 2-It's okay, 3-Liked it, 4-Loved it, 5-Can't get enough of it.

I strongly urge you to try this recipe. It is delicious. Served with sauted mixed vegetable this is not only a relatively healthy meal but will become one of your favourites.

This was a great recipe for grilling chicken.  I only had 4 hours to marinade my chicken before I grilled it...it was AWESOME!!  Chicken was sooooo tender and moist.  I would definately make this again.  Very Good!! :-)  My compliments to Kathy!

I used this with some adjustments and it was delicious! I read previous reviews and decided not to use the flour. I did add some brown sugar as stated in other reviews. I added sesame seeds to the top of my chicken after allowing it to marinate for about 4 hours. I then baked the chicken for about 35 minutes. It was outstanding. Will definitely use again! I only gave the recipe 4 stars because of the changes. Thanks!

Excellient! Use fresh squeezed OJ. Browned the chicken in very hot EVOO then drained on paper towel before putting into oven. Came out perfect. If you had a "sandy" batter you oil was not hot enough!

This was the first recipe I tried at this website.  
It was very tasty, very easy, and I would try it again.
Best served on a bed of steamed rice.
Definately, give it a try.

I was wanting the orange flavoring, but it was over powered by the soy sauce. It was pretty good, not sure if I will make again.

I found the recipe came out a little bland and could have used more flavor, perhaps more spices could be added to help this along.

I went with the previous reviewer's comments of adding some sweetener to the marinade and used several tsps of dark brown sugar.  Also used fresh grated ginger.  I briefly sauteed sweet potato chunks in the same skillet I used to brown the chicken, and then finished roasting them in the oven.  Perfect accompaniment with the orange flavored chicken.  Delicious meal.

Made for my Grandparents today for lunch. I served it over white rice and sauteed vegetables. Just had a hint of orange flavor. Not bad at all, my grandparents thought it was gourmet, but I know I can find something better...

This recipe was good and definately a keeper. I've now made it 2 times. Rather than fry the chiken first I baked at 350 for 30min covered and then 15 uncovered...although that may be a bit long. I doubled the marinade, added a little brown sugar and topped with orange slices while baking.

We loved this chicken.  I did follow some of the suggestions and made a few adjustments of my own.  I used a combo of fresh squeezed tangerine juice and not from concentrate OJ ( I used tangerine zest too).  I did add the touch of brown sugar and garlic, but I also added about 1 tsp crushed red pepper flakes. You HAVE to use high heat when you brown and keep them in the pan long enough for the flour to crisp slightly.  When you bake them, the result of the breading texture is like pressure fried chicken. The extra marinade cooks down, so if you want sauce you need to make extra marinade.  This is definatly a keeper for our house.  Thanks for the great recipe and the suggestions too!!

I skipped the breading step as past reviewers didn't find it went well.  I also added a bit more orange juice to marinade overnight and we found it quite tasty.

AWESOME marinade!!! Love to orange/ginger combination. Great way to add flavor to a standard meal of chicken, veggies, and rice. I didn't bread it or fry it because I wanted to keep it healthy.

Maybe this is a recipe that is best used for grilling - other reviewers seemed to like it for grilling.  Breading the chicken and then adding the marinade for the baking portion just made the crust soggy.  Other suggested skipping the flour - I would agree.  I did have plenty of orange flavoring... too much, but could have added to much orange zest.  Not something I would do again.

Very good taste. I marinated the chicken overnight while the chicken was still frozen and let defrost in the marinade. We grilled it on our boat and served it on buns with mayo. Very tastey and will serve again.

I marinated this chicken over night, then grilled it. It tasted great almost with an asian flavor. I would serve it with broccoli, and rice if I did it again.

Excellent Dish, the only thing I would do is to add just a touch of sweetness to the marinade.

It was good. I followed everything that was said and the only thing my family didn't like was, it was to dry. But the orange taste was good.

After reading other reviews I decided to grill the chicken.  I marinated it over 24 hours and added some brown sugar.  My husband LOVED it - rated it a 10 out of 10.

the chicken tasted good but i would definetly use bread crumbs instead of flour because the flavor was not strong enough.

I thought this would have a more fruity taste.  I also thought it would be more crunchy.  My husband and I didn't care for it...I won't make it again.

This had great flavor but was way too salty. Next time I'll use a low-sodium soy sauce. Or just cut back on amount. The flavors blended perfectly! However,the flour did get soggy. Maybe breadcrumbs next time.. or less oil. Overall will try again. If it still tastes too salty I may ditch it.

ginger flavor completely overpowered this recipe. I was hoping for something more crunchy, but after baking with flour, it was just soggy.

Procedure is well-laid out and works fine; but it's a little more labor-intensive than the end result warrants. It's your run-of-the-mill sort of recipe.

I made this dish to take to a Hawaiian Luau.   It was o.k.   I made a smaller (lower calorie)
version by just baking (skipping the rolling in flour and browning in a pan) and I actually liked that better than the one with the flour.
If I make again, I will do this way....not only does it save calories, it saves a lot of time also and the chicken came out of the oven with a golden brown look.

this was very tasty. i used clementine juice instead of orange and onion soup mix because i didn't have any onion powder. i also added a dash of worcestershire sauce. i doubled the sauce for only 2 chicken breasts and cooked it in a skillet until the sauce was thick. yum.

Instead of flouring and frying the chicken, I just baked it in the marinate and it turned out fine.  It went real well with rice and "sweet and spicy green beans" from this site.
