I have made this so many times, I have lost count.  My daughter (2 and very picky) loves it.  I cut the sugar in half because the blueberries are sweet enough on their own, also I put a few cups of the lemonade in the blender with frozen blueberries, puree it and strain it, gets rid of all the seeds and skin fragments.  But it is seriously, sooooo good.

Pretty easy and very delicious. I used lemon juice from concentrate and only used 2 cups of the lemon juice. I also used frozen rather than fresh blueberries! Hits the spot on a hot day.

I had a lot of blueberries, so I tried this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly and it was 'ok'. If I were to make it again, I would puree the blueberries and strain them into the lemonade. It's also a bit sweet.

I was looking for a truly HOT pink lemonade, and this is it!  I put the blueberries in a saucepan with a little water and heated them up for a few minutes to get them to release their juices.  Then I strained that mixture over my pitcher to avoid the seed problem.  Worked like a charm.  My daughter loved this.  It was sweet (but not too sweet) and refreshing.

This was a fun, flavorful and colorful twist on traditional lemonade.  I used a mix of frozen blueberries and strawberries only because I had already packaged them that way for Hubs' smoothies, but I have to admit I did like that combination.  I simmered them for about 5 minutes in the 1 c. water but didn't add the sugar for the syrup because I was going to use Splenda (I find I don't like its taste once it's heated).  I strained everything into my pitcher - the blueberry/strawberry mixture as well as the lemon juice.  After adding the water and the Splenda I was pleased to find it a vivid hot pink!  I like this.  It's different.  It's a little too tart but as the ice melts that won't be an issue - if you can wait that long.  Interesting, I gave some to Hubs who was working out in the yard.  His remark was, "It's good! I don't know what it is, but it's good!"

This is awesome! First, I couldn't get it to turn hot pink, but after I left it over night with the blueberries, it came out very much hot pink!  I made it for a party and everyone loved it!

This was delicious! I like the blueberries whole myself, my family wanted them strained, so I just used a pitcher with a slotted spout! Great variation on an old favorite !  ENJOY!

AWESOME! I subbed splenda for the regular sugar (same amount) and used frozen blueberries that I boiled with the water/sugar mixture. As this boiled, I crushed the blueberries. I strained that mixture to get all the skin/seeds out and proceeded with the recipe. Also, I didn't have quite enough fresh lemon juice, so I had to make up for it with bottled. This is so tasty and refreshing and I absolutely LOVE the tartness to sweetness ratio! I know I will be making this often! Thanks for sharing. :)

so good, I made my simple syrup with the bluebrries inthe morning and let it steep all day.  The lemonade came out the most beautiful hot pink color. My kids loved it. This recipe is a keeper. Thank you!

Used the juice from some canned blueberries I had left over.  This recipe popped up today and it was the perfect idea to use it up.  Lots of vitamin C and antioxidants in this treat!

Very tasty and like the added flavor and vitamins that the blueberries give it.  I did puree the berries before adding them to the lemonade.  My 2-year-old, my husband and I loved it, my 4 year-old couldn't get passed the seeds and skin floating around.  I tried to strain, but didn't help.  I', sure if I had strained it in cheese cloth everyone would have loved it!

Super good.  I totally cheated though... Put the blueberries, water and 1/2  the sugar in a bowl in the microwave and got them cooking in there.  Filled a pitcher half way with ice and added country time bottled lemonade- then the strained syrup and topped it with water... Added a few lemon slices and the Kiddos LOVED it! :)

This is delicious!  I had some homemade blueberry syrup (made of blueberries, sugar, corn syrup and lemon juice) so I just cut the amount of sugar in half, and reduced the lemon juice....and threw in my syrup.  It was a beautiful hot pink and was delicious.  There is no need to strain the berries before serving as long as your pitcher has a strain option.  The blueberries sink to the bottom.

Super!!! I just loved it. I did do the opposite though. I made the syrup with the bluberries, to break them down, and I added it to the lemon & water.

I love seeing how many people like this recipe! Since posting this, our baby girl has grown into a little lady who adores anything pink and she's the biggest fan of this lemonade. I guess it would have been helpful to add that the reason we make it so sour and sweet is that we serve it over ice and it tends to water it down. I can see how drinking it "straight up" would be kind of puckery! So if you try this recipe, make sure to have it over ice.

I only give this recipe 4 stars because it did need the blueberries pureed and strained (I did so with a stick blender and fine mesh strainer).  Recipe was fabulous otherwise!  A word of warning, for me, 6 large lemons produced 1 3/4 cups juice.

Tasty and refreshing...I used a few fresh lemons and bottled lemon juice for the rest.  I also cooked the berries in a little lemon juice and water (~1/4 cup total) until they released their juices...you could strain the skins out at that point if you wanted.  Tart and refreshing!

I've made this recipe many times over the last 6 years and realized I've never reviewed it. If you don't like the sugar/lemon juice/water ratio, use what you like. Of course what makes this so different, is using blueberries! I find that using frozen blueberries instead of fresh is best. The purple color starts mixing into it right away. I can taste the blueberry flavor. Thanks Candice for such a great idea!

This is good.  I made two batches.  One batch was made as is and I liked it but thought it was too sweet.  My kids on the other hand loved it-so it gets 5 stars.  The kids also put it in the blender with some ice cubes.  The second batch I used less sugar and left out the ice cubes to turn it into granita.  I cooked the blueberries and then strained them before adding to the simple syrup.  Thanks for the recipe Candice S.

This was an easy and wonderful recipe. You MUST strain the blueberries for best results and need not so much sugar.

Good.. but too lemony.. I lessened the sugar like how others said to.. but kept the lemon juice at the same amount! Big mistake!! It leaves a puckering taste in your mouth. But was still good. I added the blueberries to the simple syrup mixture and added the lemon juice to it.. it got a hot pink color, but I didn't taste the blueberries (am I supposed to?). I even added some extra (whole) bluberries and stirred it in! Still not blueberry tast.. I added the strained blueberries..a little taste.. but it wasn't enough! Next time, I think I will let the blueberries just sit in the simple syrup and put it in the fridge so it will absorb all the flavor.

Delightful drink.  This is so fun to watch the lemonade turn pink.  I cooked the blueberries with the water and sugar and then added the lemon juice to that.  I then poured the contents of the pot through a strainer into a pitcher with water and ice.  This way, there was also very little pulp, which my kids liked.  I used Splenda instead of the sugar.  Will definitely make again - love it!

This was totally delicious, I wished I had seen previous reviews about boiling the blueberries with the sugar and water.....man of man, because I ended up heating it up some after I mixed it all because it wasn't that beautiful pink yet and after about 10 minutes...I had to. Now I know to do that. Thanks. Now we totally liked this recipe and we could taste the lemons in this, and I will agree, do not use pre-juiced lemons, fresh is best for this recipe. I've been on a lemonade kick and so far we like this one. It's diffently a great spin on lemonade.

This recipe is fantastic.  I took the other tips and just boiled the blueberries in with the sugar and water. Then mixed in the lemon juice, then put everything through a wire strainer into the water - leaves no pulp or skin and just gives you a smooth hot pink color that the kids love.  The fresh lemons are a MUST use in this recipe - don't substitute lemon juice.  I often cut the recipe in half and it works just fine.  Love it!

I blended 1 cup of blueberries with some of the water then let them soak a bit before straining into the lemonade. More blueberry flavor and deeper color.

VERY good!  I didn't add all of the sugar, but will next time!  We boiled the blueberries and strained them out and it worked perfectly.

I never leave pieces of fruit in drinks after having had a rather unpleasant choking episode as a teen, when a hostess put pieces of strawberry into the punch. I crushed and strained the berries for my own peace of mind.

My version was really good -- I doctored it up a bit.  I doubled the amount of blueberries and blended them / threw them in the Magic Bullet, then put them in with the hot sugar syrup.  I cooked this a few minutes, enough to bring out the beautiful colour of the berries, then I added the lemon juice, and let it cool.  I strained it a bit with a colander that caught the bigger chunks.

Then ... I added a tablespoon or two of rose water.  Voila, now I have Blueberry Rose Lemonade.

I found it worked better with one cup of sugar. I also strained the blueberry guts so it wouldn't get pulpy. Afterwards I squished the heck out the blueberries to extract all that goodness and deep red colour. Only thing I'd recommend is a funnel because I spilled at least 20% of what I made. Overall, it was really good.

I  pureed  the  blueberries and the lemonade turned out more like blueberry juice. But that didn't  really matter cause it tasted great that way. Yum

Love this recipe! I made this for a cookout this summer and it was a huge hit! The only thing I did differently was heat the blueberries on the stove (mixed with a little bit of water) to render the blueberry juice. Then I added the blueberry juice to the drink instead of the actual blueberries. Fantastic!

Delicious!  Loved the taste and especially the fact that I didn't have to add in food coloring to get the pretty color!  The only thing I did differently was to add the frozen blueberries to the simple syrup after I took it off the heat and let them warm up a few minutes.  Then I poured everything into the pitcher through a strainer.  I will definitely be making this again!

I'd give this 5 stars for taste, but knocked it to 4 for the method.  I couldn't get the lemonade to turn pink no matter how much I stirred and even shook with the (fresh) blueberries.  I ended up having to puree and strain to get the color/flavor to come through.  I would cook the berries in the syrup or just puree in the future.  Wonderful taste though.

This was very nice and refreshing.  I used 10 fresh lemons and a small package of blueberries. Strained as much as I could. Everyone enjoyed it. Thanks!

This was okay, but I was in one of those "want it NOW" moods and I didn't have any lemons or fresh blueberries.  So I used bottled lemon juice (Minute Maid, which is not near as good as Real Lemon) and frozen wild blueberries.  I can totally taste the "fakeness" of the Minute Maid lemon juice.  I think if it were real lemon juice it would be delicious!  Definitely trying this again when I have the right ingredients...or at least the bottled Real Lemon, which is a great substitute!  I did add the frozen berries to the simple syrup while boiling, which helped break them down.  Yum!

Delicious! And easy! My 8 year old daughter helped me make this, and it was an instant hit with everyone at the dinner table tonight. I had to use bottled lemon juice and frozen blueberries, as they were what I had on hand, but it was still a fabulous drink, and a recipe we will be using all summer long! Thank you!

The color of this lemonade is so awesome! Mine came out really tart- but that's most likely to blame on the kind of lemons I used. Will make this again!

I'm sorry to say this but I did not like the appearance of this lemonade. I hate giving bad reviews. It was a decent lemonade but the blueberries floating in it and against the glass sides looked like they were curdled. I tried to blend it out but with no avail.

Delicious drink. A little sweeter than I prefer, but that can be easily adjusted by adding less sugar.
