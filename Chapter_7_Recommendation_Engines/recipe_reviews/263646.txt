This is way too dangerous for when that chocolate craving strikes! But I suppose it's not really since it's just a serving for 1 :)  I used white whole wheat flour and cooked it in a 2-cup round pyrex bowl. I'm never sure if the batter will overflow my mugs, so the small pyrex bowl always works great for mug cakes.
