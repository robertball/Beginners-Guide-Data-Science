Recipe was made exactly as written.  I used skim milk (all I had) but did add a little bit of evaporated milk which I had in the fridge to enrich the flavor.  The 4 cloves of garlic differentiated it from the typical potato soup, and it was perfectly in balance with the other ingredients.  It did thicken up a bit too much, so I thinned it out with more chicken stock.  I will start with 3/4 cup mashed potato flakes the next time.  What a nice job those mashed potato flakes did on thickening; I'll remember that for other food preparation.

I tripled the amount of bacon in this recipe and used evaporated milk. After tasting the end result, I did add a few additional spices. This took no time to make which was incredibly helpful to me seeing as I work such long hours. I really don't understand the addition of instant potatoes instead of using more of the red potatoes other than a thickening agent. I don't know that I'd make this again.

I added a can of chicken (left out the bacon), one chopped red bell pepper, substituted milk for rice milk, and I left out the mashed potato flakes. I also upped the parsley ratio to about 1/2 a cup (I had already doubled the recipe). I added basil flakes as well as salt and pepper to taste. I like my soups a little thinner so leaving out the mashed potato flakes was a good call for me. I like the flavor and would make it again.

I made this exactly as written, with the exception of adding some salt as I had used low-salt broth.  We loved it, and I'll be making it again.
