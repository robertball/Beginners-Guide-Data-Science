I made this for dinner over the weekend and it was just okay. We didn't really like the creme cheese product and there really wasn't an Indian flavor to it even though I used Tandoori paste. Something just wasn't right. I like the concept but the overall recipes was blah.

I made this for dinner tonight and it was awesome - everyone loved it. I increased the sauce ingredients by 1 Tbsp each and added caramelized onions and mozzarella cheese to the party. The end result was amazingly good deliciously different pizza.

Made this tonight and my husband loved it. Couldn't get philly garlic cooking Creme so I mixed philly garlic and herb cheese spread with sour cream to get a creamy sauce and used it. Tasty.

I cooked the chicken as a separate endeavor then coated it with a homemade cream cheese/garlic/tandoori concoction (I'm too cheap to buy Cooking Creme) and then proceeded with the recipe. Ooh ooh YUMS. If you are looking for chicken that shouts "Indian" more than tandoori paste will do then it's best to look up and cook Indian chicken then sub it for the pieces in this recipe. Otherwise this recipe is just grand. Also I placed the naan on a baking tray that was coated liberally with olive oil. It adds calories and a thus a little more lip smacking decadence.
