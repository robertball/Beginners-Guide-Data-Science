Sinfully rich, over the top delicious, oh so chocolately, and absolutely fabulous! I mean to try to describe these brownies using just one word may be virtually impossible, just as impossible as it is to eat just one of these brownies- yes, they're that good. If you're a self proclaimed chocoholic or have ever been accused of being one this is the brownie for you. They are definitely worth the time it takes to make these. I followed the recipe exactly and kept thinking, "Will this be enough?". But, these are so rich that the recipe yield is perfect. I highly recommend using the foil liner in the pan. I used Reynold's non-stick and I also highly recommend rinsing/wiping down your knife between each slice when cutting your brownies. The raspberry is awesome, but I might try using chocolate syrup or even some Bailey's next time to change it up. Another hit right out of the park - Thanks larkspur for another great recipe!

I just finished making these and they are delicious! I don't have good luck with chocolate curls, so I melted the chocolate and made chocolate hearts for Valentine's Day. I froze them to harden and set them on the frosting. They look awesome! My recommendation is to remove the brownies to a cutting board for cutting, and be sure to wipe the knife off after each cut. The fudge topping tends to gum up the knife, so this makes cutting easier and the finished result picture perfect!! Thanks for a keeper - I will definitely be making these again.

VERY good!  I did make a few slight changes, but that was only because I was trying to use what I had around the house.  Instead of raspberry jam I used cherry preserves & it turned out very yummy.  Also, I added a little extra vanilla.  The only other adjustment that I made was using milk chocolate chips instead of the mini chocolate chips (again, trying to use what I had around).  Very rich!  Next time I may try adding a bit more preserves/jam to the mix or omit the chocolate chips in order to have a lighter brownie that showcased the fruit flavor a little more. The suggestion for wetting your knife between slices was very useful or else I would have had a mess on my hands. Thank you Larkspur for submitting such a creative & tasty recipe!

I just made these & they are VERY delicious, dense, FABULOUS, superb, quite likely the-best-I've-ever-made, sad-I-made-only-a-half-batch, even-sadder-I-already-promised-to-share-this-with-several-people, though-glad-they-turned-out-so-credibly-great-that-I'm-proud-to-share (-though-still-disappointed-that-I-HAVE-TO), fabulous (oops! already used that superlative!) fudge brownies, with whisp of raspberry flavor!!!! Aaaahhhhhh.....If you're going to halve this recipe (though I think the only circumstance under which you should even think such a thing is if you only have 1 Tblsp. raspberry jam & 1/4 c. heavy cream to whip, which happened to be my circumstance!), half a recipe fits perfectly in a 9"x5.25" loaf pan, & bakes in 25-27 mins. I followed the recipe precisely, and these brownies have the dense chocolate texture of a flourless chocolate torte; they aren't 'cakey', which suits my & my family's preference. The tip about wiping the knife in between slices keeps each slice looking picture-perfect. I garnished each triangle with chocolate shavings & a raspberry.

Wow! These are some rich, decadent and oh so good brownies! The first thing I would like to say about this recipe is, although it may seem like a long one, you won't believe how quickly it came together. I couldn't get raspberry jam/preserves here so I just subbed strawberry jam instead and I put in a generous helping of food colour to get a deep pink frosting. I generously greased my brownie pan so it slipped out easily when cooled. I then took some wax paper and lined the pan with it and dropped the brownie "brick" back into the pan, made up the fudge frosting and put it over, stuck it in the fridge and when it was time for the cream cheese frosting I just lifted the wax paper with the brownie and "hardened" fudge frosting out and I actually piped the cream cheese frosting onto my brownies. Let it rest again in the fridge and finally did the cutting. Definitely need to clean the knife in-between cuts for clean cuts as another reviewer suggested. I kept these in the fridge as soon as they were done and decided to have a slice tonight. The result is a chewy, fudgy brownie with a delicious creamy topping and of course that slight hint of strawberry (raspberry) almost cheesecake-like flavour finishing off this heavenly dessert. I got to admit, even for my sweet tooth...one little piece does go far! Thanks for sharing your recipe Larkspur!

For the top I did a drizzle of melted Raspberry chocolate, like Petit Fours, across the tops of the brownies. They are were so pretty. I did as was suggested and rinsed my knife between cuts, and they came out with no jagged edges. The Raspberry topping is almost framed by the dark chocolate. But, I didn't cut them in triangles. I cut them in 1/4 inch slices, 4-inches wide and then layed them on a dessert plate that I had drizzled with the melted Raspberry Chocolate. The dessert plates I used were white with pink ribbons and light and dark pink tiny roses around the outside. The presentation was stunning. Thank you, for such a beautiful dessert. This is going in my recipe file under, Impressors. Thats where I put my, "Blow your socks off" recipes.

I don't mean to be negative, but this is the first 5 star recipe I've tried from this website that WAS NOT a hit.  I followed the recipe exactly as written and was very disappointed.  Everyone else that tried it agreed, not a very good brownie recipe.

Very good and very rich! I used regular choc. chips, that's what I had on hand. However, I think the miniature ones, as stated, would be better. I cut some into squares, some into triangle...My husband and his friend asked why the triangles and I said that they might be too rich for some. They both shook their heads NO!   I sent some home with this friend for his family, he said - They won't make it! :) (meaning he would eat them all before he got home) Thanks for the recipe Larkspur!

These are soooo good. I didn't do the chocolate curls because I'm not to good at them so I left them off. I could not decide which part was my favorite the brownie or the topping. I did use about a tablespoon extra of raspberry jam and made my own whipped cream since I didn't have any of the store bought. Cut these bigger than suggested. And I cleaned my knife after each cut as was suggested in another review. Worked great. Thanks for the yummy recipe!

Love these brownies.  I made them into little brownie bites with my mini muffin tin.  After they cooled, I spread the chocolate on top, let them sit in the fridge overnight to set up, and then piped the raspberry cream on top in the morning.  I also made the cream the night before and let it sit in the fridge overnight to make it easier to pipe.  The flavor combination is terrific, and they are a perfect bite-sized treat for the teacher's lounge at school.

OMG these are good! They did take quite a bit of time and effort, but I have to say worth every single bit!   Of course mine were Gluten Free, but no one would have been able to tell the difference. ;-)  Larkspur, thank you so much for sharing this yummy treat!

All I can say is that I normally do not like chocolate brownies. These I had to run away from or I would have eaten the entire pan. I had to use blackberry preserves instead, but it did not matter. These were like a little bit of nirvana on a plate. Make sure to undercook the brownies just a bit, as it makes them even more irresistable.

Wow! This is definitely the most delicious brownie I have EVER tasted! After reading all of the posts, I did not use the tin foil liner. I simply buttered and floured the pan and the brownies slipped right out. I did follow other hints, i.e., chilled the cream cheese mixture and chilled the chocolate mixture before using. I didn't have cool whip or other premade, so I used 1/2 cup of whipping cream with 1 tbl of sugar and whipped it up before using. It worked fine. I agree with others that undercooking the brownies is by far preferable to overcooking - they are delightfully chewy. I made these for Valentine's Day yesterday and my hubby was ecstatic. We could have eaten every single one, but I didn't want either of us to be sick (too much sugar). But oh brother, did I want to eat all of them! True they are a little more work than your average brownie...but there is nothing average about these babies. They will knock your socks (and everything else) off! Larkspur, you have my and my husband's undying gratitude for a drop dead, dynamite dessert. Thank you!!!!! I only wish I could give you at least 10 stars.

Very good rich brownies. We loved the fudge layer and cream cheese frosting. The only thing I would change is to not use aluminum foil to line the pan. Next time I will use baking paper or only grease the pan. I'm having a hard time getting it off of the brownies and am finding small pieces in my teeth.

These brownies are AMAZING! They are a little time consuming due to the different steps and layers, but they are definitely worth it! The only thing I would suggest is adding more of the raspberry preserves to the topping if you want a stronger raspberry flavor. Otherwise they are wonderful as is!!

I loved these brownies!  I had to change some ingredients because I hadn't realized my evaporated milk had gone bad (had to use coffee creamer!), but they still turned out wonderful!

This was very delicious, but I'm not a fan of chocolate and fruit so I took out the raspberry jelly in the cream cheese frosting, and used a little milk instead. I will definitely use this again.

These could very well be my favorite brownies.  Moist, fudgy and the topping is just delightful.  And such a pretty dessert, it would be the star of a dessert tray.  I left out the mini chips, simply for economy's sake, and used regular chips instead of chocolate squares, just as good.  I topped with a slice of raspberry and it was even prettier.

I made this for yesterday's dinner - it was fantastic!  I used Strawberry preserves instead [b/c that's what I had on hand] and fresh strawberries on top.  I also made the brownie/fudge part the day before and let it set in the fridge overnight.  The next day I made the topping and even put that in the freezer before dinner.    Worked well and tasted amazing!

WOW--the brownie part of this recipe is out of this world.  Not necessarily brownie-like, but more fudge-like.  I wasn't crazy about the raspberry topping, but that was kind of dumb on my part since I'm not crazy about fruit and chocolate together.  So, if you don't like that combo, this isn't for you.  I wondered, though, if I could put some chocolate or coffee flavor in instead of the raspberry?  Definitely worth trying, I think.

This dessert was a big hit.  It does take a long time to prepare, but each step is straight forward.  The only change I made was I used an egg and a white in the batter, and used the remaining yolk in the fudge layer.  I cut the brownies in 16 pieces and it was almost the correct size for a dessert portion.  It is rich, so it really doesn't take much to satisfy.  The berry flavor is very subtle and perfect!

This was good.  Not the best though.  The brownie part came out too cakey I think.  But, they were still good.  Good tasting.

I made these for my son's birthday. I followed the recipe exactly except that I made my normal brownie recipe instead of the one in the recipe. The only real difference is that mine uses baking chocolate instead of cocoa.  The fudge layer was very good, but we all agreed the raspberry topping was completely wrong. The cream cheese is too sour for the very sweet brownies and fudge, and the "whipped topping" and jam are not sweet enough to overcome the sour/tartness of the cream cheese.  I have made a similar dessert with a layer of raspberry butter cream icing on top which was much better. The payoff was not worth the time consuming prep.

These were great to decorate. I think I'm still shaking from all the sugar and chocolate.

I made these for an office birthday party.  The brownie part was excellent, the chocolate layer was GREAT, even though it didn't seem to 100% adhere to the brownie, when cutting.  The topping was my only "negative".  The taste was great, I just didn't care for the consistency.  Maybe it was me, but it was very soft and I would have liked it to have been a little more firm.  I didn't think the prep was too much, just wish that topping had been a little different.  Everyone loved them at the office, as well as my spouse.

These were by far more than i expected (which was alot according to other reviews!) and thats just what I wanted! Absolutely divine taste, very rich. The raspberry cream topping compliments it all great. I used tin foil to line the pan, as others did, and they came out easily. Can't wait to share with my friends!

I was really excited about this recipe so I attempted to make it for a bake sale at work. I just didn't like how much work it was to make these. I did use aluminum foil in the baking pan, and after I let them cool for a couple minutes I lifted out the aluminum with the brownies in it so it could cool outside of the pan. Then I flipped the brownie brick back into the pan so it was upside down because I couldn't figure out another way to get it back into the pan. When I was making the fudge topping, on my first attempt I ended up with some egg whites in the milk and they cooked into white chunks. Luckily I hadn't discarded the extra milk in the can yet so I re-made the milk mixture. Then I poured it over the brownies and let it cool before attempting the raspberry topping which was a complete failure. I didn't have any frozen cool whip but I did have whipped cream from a can so I figured that would work bu I don't think it did. Then the mix ended up with little chunks of jam that wouldn't break down any more and I ended up over mixing the toping. By then it was clear it wasn't going to work so I just ended up with regular brownies with a fudge topping. They taste good but not much different than any other brownies.

Oh my!  Why have I waited so long to try this recipe???  These brownies are exquisite!  I forgot to add the chocolate chips to the brownie batter and had to sub chocolate chips for the semisweet baking chocolate, but they still turned out delicious.  I didn't read the directions very well and I ended up baking the brownies in a 9 x 13 pan, so I doubled the fudge filling and raspberry creme topping.  I'll definitely make these again!

These went together nicely and looked awesome in the pan, but I butchered them getting them out of the pan.  Also, my first bite had a little piece of foil in it...argh!  Definitely a chocoholic treat, very rich.  I made them for my staff for Valentine's day...they loved them!

These came out beautiful (to look at) AND delicious, I took them to a formal ladies "tea" luncheon/fundraiser and my husband was mad that I only left him one, so I will NEED to make more! I cut them in triangles, as suggested, and that made my tray of treats look perfect!

To start, it went against my gut to line the pan with aluminum foil.  When these were done, I did not know if they were to cool on wire rack directly or in pan...thinking they would cool to the foil, I flipped it onto a wire rack - very carefully, I might add b/c it was cracking and was only about 1/4 inch deep (?) and it still was hard to remove the foi and some adhered... The bakers chocolate either needs to be cut into small pieces before pouring the milk/yolk mixture or to be directly added to the milk yolk mixture while in the pot over low heat b/c it did not fully melt. Third, the topping was impossible to get smooth like some pictures show.  This definitely was not presentable like I'd hoped.  I topped with chocolate chips scattered to hide the imperfection of the frosting.  I did give 4 stars though because the taste was still quite yummy - although none of my guests made any comments either way...

Love these!  I've made them several times and tend to use a box mix (Betty C) for convenience sake.  Also, I increase the preserves to 4T for more raspberry flavor and line my 9x9 baking pan with wax or parchment paper for easy removal and cutting.  Delicious!!  Even better the second day.

These are JUST AS GOOD as they sound. Oh my goodness. I halved the recipe and baked it in a loaf pan. I even burned the brownies a little bit and they were delicious. One of the best base brownie recipes I've ever had, and the other parts just make it so over-the-top delicious you will want to eat the whole pan.

These are truly delicious and decadent and very simple to make.  I followed the directions exactly and they came out perfect.  I was a little worried that the chocolate layer was going to be to thin but if firmed up nice. I will be making these again.  I loved the raspberry but would also like to try this with cherry preserves.  Thanks larkspur for sharing this!

The brownie and filling would be 5 stars (so awesome!), but I didn't really like the frosting.  The frosting tasted best really cold, but then the brownie was hard from being in the fridge and I didn't like that as much.  So, it's a solid 4 stars!

Delicious!! They definitely take some work, but as other reviewers agree, it's well worth it.  I did not cut mine into 32 triangles, but kept them at 16 squares.  As rich as they are, I think that 1 square is a serving.  Instead of using any kind of fruit jam (not big on fruit in my desserts), I used chocolate cool whip and cream cheese.  It worked out great!  Might be a nice substitute for anyone else who is not a big fan of fruit with their brownies.

A super rich brownies. The texture of the brownies itself is good but the chocolate sauce is too rich for the brownies overall it seems overpowering everything. Will make again only the brownies with other topping. Thks for sharing.

WOW! These are so rich its sinful! I took these to a dinner party and they were a hit. Got lots of requests for the recipe. Things I did different: Didn't use the foil, and just cut straight out of pan, used semi sweet cocoa powder, doubled the chocolate chips, and used 4 table spoons jam. Next time I think I will double the fudge layer. And there will definitely be a next time! Thanks Larkspur!!!

These were yummy! My fiance said they were the best brownies ever! We didn't cut them in triangles, just in squares, simply because we wanted MORE per serving, LOL (no, they weren't too rich for us)! Thank you so much, larkspur!

Very easy! I made these for a church dessert auction and was surprised how simple it was--I'm not a master chef at all!  I did not use the food coloring in the topping and would not recommend it--the natural shade of pink seems just right and I think that the food coloring would have made them look too artificial.  They turn out beautifully with very little effort!

These were pretty good but not great. It was fun to do something a little different with brownies but I don't know if I will make them again. I thought the topping tasted like raspberry yogurt.

Yum-azing! These were seriously yummy but took a lot of work lol. Worth it though! I don't do choc curls very well myself, so I just grated some raspberry chocolate meltaways instead and sprinkled them on top. Everyone loved them and they were gone in no time! Thanks for the great recipe!

This was good.  The serving size was just too small for me.  I liked these best after a couple of days in the fridge, the raspberry cream had time to stiffen up & didn't want to slide off the brownie.

A great way to dress up a standard brownie. Cannot believe that the recipe submitter is only 18 years old. Her culinary skills are way beyond her years!

I would give these 10 stars if I could. I followed the directions exactly as written. A little time consuming but boy are they worth it. You can't go wrong when you serve these.

These were good, though I definitely didn't follow the recipe closely.  I was in a time crunch, so I started with a brownie mix.  I skipped the fudge layer b/c brownies are rich enough on their own to me.  I did the raspberry topping as stated.  My only issue was that the topping and brownie didn't adhere super well for presentation.  However, this may not have been a problem had I don't the fudge layer!

I absolutely love these brownies.  I ate 4 triangles in a row and seriously could have eaten more.  I followed the recipe exactly but used 1/3 fat cream cheese (could not tell at all).  Next time I plan to use light whipped topping and may also try using a different brownie base.  Maybe I baked them a little long, but I found the base to be not as soft and chocolaty as I wanted.  But truly, the recipe is 5 stars without changing anything.  Enjoy but make sure you have people to feed them to or you may just eat them all by yourself.

These were absolutely spectacular.  I messed up the sweetened condensed egg mixture, and it was still delicious!  The only thing was the cream cheese made it very difficult to cut, but totally worth it.  yum yum yum!

These brownies were quite good. I typically go for a cake like brownie, but this brownie may have converted me. It was thick and chewy. I did think that the raspberry flavor was not as strong as I would have liked. Maybe adding raspberry flavor into the brownie batter, and more into the cream cheese frosting. I melted chocolate chips and jam together to make a additional garnish on the top. This was an adult treat, as the cream cheese frosting was more complex than kids usually like. But, the frosting was great for cutting the richness of the chocolate. It was a great dessert for the group of adults I served it to. I doubled the recipe, but that wasn't necessary because one small piece was all that was needed to solve everyone's sweet tooth's. And these do get better as the days go on I'm on day three and they are really great.

I made these for my hubby for Valentine's Day.  They are awesome!  Nothing says Valentine's Day more to me than chocolate and raspberry - and these deliver!  I made a similar recipe last year from the Nestle website, but I like these better.  It's the fudge layer that does it for me.  The only changes I made were to double the chocolate chips and add an extra Tbsp. of raspberry preserves.  I was worried that the cream cheese mixture wouldn't be sweet enough, but when paired with all the chocolate, it's perfect.  Highly recommend this recipe!

These took quite a bit of time and effort, but the end result was heavenly!.. I added a little more presentation wise for Valentines Day!.. So pretty!  Thanks Larks!..  Just a thought Larkspur, I may try ending in the chocolate next time so the raspberry and cream cheese is the filling instead of topping and don't hate me, but I think I'd leave out the chocolate chips and try nuts.. A lot of sweet/richness here!...

These were awesome!!!!!!!!!! Very good. I thought they would be richer but they weren't, which was good. I found I didn't need to line pan with foil, I just sprayed with Pam. I've always made boxed brownies, but from now on I think I'am hooked on these. Thanks for the great recipe Larkspur!!!  Oh by the way....my family LOVED them.

These are one of the best brownies I have tasted. Everyone in my family loved them. I followed the recipe exactly, but didn't use chocolate curls and dusted brownies with cocoa powder. The brownie part is rich and moist, but cream cheese raspberry layer is so delicious.

I cheated on the brownies and used the Ghiradelli mix, but I add about an extra 1/4 c of Hershey's special dark cocoa mix to the batter.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. These are just fantastic. BF says best brownies he's ever had. :)

The idea is awesome! The recipe needs tweaking. The chocolate fudge layer turned out like soup. I was grateful that I waited to see if it would start to set before I added it to the brownies. The brownie layer was awesome. Great if you want to know what is in your brownies. If I am pressed for time,  however, I will use a boxed mix in the future. For the fudge layer, I used 2c. chocolate chips and a can of sweetened condensed milk. Heat in the microwave for a minute and stir until smooth. (Much easier, and no "is it cooked?" egg yolk.) After I put the fudge layer on, I placed raspberries on the chocolate. They made for a little tart bonus in every bite. I also used other reviewers suggestions and doubled the amount of preserves in the topping.

Best brownies I've ever made! I'm not a big cream cheese fan, so I just did a very thin layer of the frosting on top that I made with my own homemade whipped cream, and it was just perfect! Great recipe, I will be making again and again...

Yum!  I only changed the topping - used a whole block of cream cheese (what would you do with 2 leftover oz?) and extra jam to compensate.  Used homemade whipped cream.  Have you ever read the ingredients on whipped topping?!  No thanks...  It did make a lot of frosting, but since that was the best part I didn't get any complaints.  I totally realized halfway through the pan of brownies that the brownie recipe itself isn't that stellar, it's the topping and ganache that makes it.  I only cooked my brownies for 20 minutes and they were still a bit dry and hard when all was said and done with.  Would definitely repeat, perhaps using a different brownie recipe.

These are amazingly tasty. I made them as directed except I used real whipped cream instead of frozen whipped topping. The brownie part was moist and rich, the fudge topping was perfect, and the cream cheese in the frosting gave it just enough tanginess to keep it from being cloyingly sweet. The only thing I will change in the future is either adding raspberry flavoring to the frosting or using raspberry flavored chips in the brownies, as I would have liked more raspberry flavor.

I made these for Valentine's Day.  My husband does not like cream cheese so he was not too happy that the topping tasted just like cream cheese.  But when you eat the whole thing together it's divine.  Tastes even better the 2nd day.

My 14 year old daughter made this using a box brownie mix..it was very good. We then made again and doubled the topping for a 9x13 pan and used strawberry jam instead of raspberry and it was even better. Very good and addictive..can't stop at one!!

I loved this recipe. I was making this for dessert for my family. I made the brownie part in a 9 inch round (in the oven- let it bake for 30 mins and pulled it out when the edges looked done- if you let it cook to long the brownies will be chewy) and it was cooling and then company came unexpectedly. Due to time constraints, I skipped the stove part (evaporated milk/ melt chocolate) and just mixed cream cheese (I used honey nut crm chz- the premixed kind for bagels and mixed that with whipped cream from the can and a full shot of Liqueur 43- a raspberry liqueur instead of jelly) I spread it on top of my 9" round upside down brownie circle on a plate and topped it with fresh strawberries and more mini chocolate chips. Wish I had taken a pic. So pretty. It was awesome. Nice to share with the M-I-L... she was impressed at my "whipped up" dessert and nice to have something made to share with company. The brownie was soft and the crm chz/ whipped cream was perfect. RICH. Serve with coffee! TFP!

If you want a more chocolatey flavor, although this recipe is delicious, I would use ghiradehli semisweet chocolate squares, very rich.

Wonderful! Craveable! This is the brownie recipe that my dreams are made of & they dance in my head whenever that sugar craving sets in! I am capable of eating way to many of these. The textures and flavors are awesome together and it is really worth the extra time to make these. Thank you for a truly fabulous  and elegant recipe.

Pretty darn tasty.  Nice dense chewy brownie which I like - only complaint here is I did not like biting into the chips, even tho they were mini ones...just a texture thing with me.  I prefer a smooth chewy brownie I guess.  The next 2 layers were wonderful.

Very good !!! Be careful and use semisweet baking bar, I used unsweetened my first try not paying attention.  I thought it took longer to make but these brownies are well worth it. Also used wax paper instead of foil to line pan.

These are probably one of my favorite dessert recipes I've recently made.  The consistency of the brownie is PERFECT-chewy, soft, moist, & fudgey!  And the combo of the brownie, fudge, & fluffy raspberry topping is a delightful taste in the mouth!!  I doubled the creamcheese frosting, but used a little less cream cheese to make it a little lighter & of course used the neufchatel cream cheese (1/3 the fat) & it tastes JUST AS GOOD!!

Amazing. You really only need a tiny piece. So dense and chocolatey, like something you would get at a bakery, yet so easy. I used strawberry jelly and even though it had seeds it looked and tasted great. The topping is fluffy and kind of marshmallowy-you definitely need to serve these with forks. One drop of red food coloring got it to the perfect shade of pink. Don't skimp on the fudge layer or it will get lost between the brownie and cream cheese, and definitely double the amount of jelly. And if you are in doubt, underbaking these is better than overbaking!

A FANTASTIC recipe.... I made them exactly as the recipe stated (except I was out of chocolate chips)...and it turned out great!  I had rave reviews from family.  It's been added to my favorites.
