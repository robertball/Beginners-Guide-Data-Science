I used the vanilla sugar substitution recommended in the footnotes and it was delicious! A very yummy evening snack that was easy and fast to make. Definitely recommend!

I'm kind of mystified this worked, but it did!  I used gluten free flour and dairy free milk (because: allergies) and it rose  and seems to be the right texture, too.  Mine took about 1 min 45 seconds to double in size.

A great gluten free dessert with gluten free all purpose flour and 1/8 tsp xanthum gum. It turned out really great!!!   My grandson loved it with a dollop of vanilla ice cream on top since everyone else was having strawberry rhubarb crunch with regular flour.  He didn't feel deprived at all!!!!  Other than the gluten free flour and xanthum gum, I followed the recipe and it was magic!!!!
