Very good oatmeal Cassandra. Since it wasn't specified exactly what kind of oats to use, I used Old Fashioned Oats. I didn't have any applesauce, so I mashed up 1/2 a banana and used crushed flax seeds in place of the wheat germ. I also used frozen blueberries since that's all I had. I too am trying to incorporate enough fiber into my diet and this oatmeal was definitely a great start to my day. Thanks for sharing.

So yummy!  I used a frozen berry mix(blueberries, blackberries, and raspberries) the first time I made this, the second I threw in strawberries and bananas.  A little vanilla helps the flavor.

This recipe was actually pretty good, but I did find the problem that some others were complaining about (the blandness):  salt.  You need a little salt to bring out the flavors.  I also used only 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, and it was really good!

I love this.  Sometimes I add flax and I usually slice banana over the top after it's in the bowl to add more texture, nutrition, and flavor.

This was a great change from the usual oatmeal.  I used strawberries instead of blueberries.  This would be great with any fruit and  a very healthy way to start the day. Thanks Cassandra.

Good oatmeal, not great but I'm really trying to make healthier breakfasts on the weekends.  I did, however, have to add more sugar (and a touch of salt).

For this recipe, I use Irish Oats in a rice cooker that has programing for porridge. I add all the ingredients at night, and in the morning everything is ready. I add a pat of butter, or Smart Balance, to give it the salt taste it needs.

I am rating this a little lower than it may deserve as this was my first attempt at eating oatmeal.  I didnt use any sugar as I am on a 2 month detox, but I did add extra applesauce and vanilla.  It had taste although was still a little bland to me.  Might just be because it was my first time.  I am gonna keep trying it to see if as my taste buds change it will get better over time.  thanks for sharing this recipe!

A good starting point for inspiration but I feel the recipe needs some modifications. For me, the finished product was too runny -- next time I would probably decrease the milk and water by 1/4 cup each. As other reviewers suggested, I added some vanilla (1/2 tsp) and an additional teaspoon of sugar to sweeten it to my tastes. Using a bit of fat-free half and half in place of some of the milk adds richness without extra fat.

This was quite good. I used my own homemade organic applesauce and freeze-dried blueberries that I cooked in with the oatmeal. I did cut back on the cinnamon by half again only because I didn't want the cinnamon to overpower everything else. I made a half batch--just enough for me. Filling and just right for a cold morning that's revving up to be a long day. Next time, I'll double the blueberries or use double the amount of another berry, as it would be good with pretty much any fruit, I think. A quarter cup wasn't enough for me. NOTE: I did make this in the microwave. I just mixed everything together and nuked it on high for about four minutes.

I have to agree with TKD JEN my kids hated this and they love oatmeal.I thought it was edible but barely very bland. I guess we'll just have to stick with ripe bananas mashed in it.

My kids hated this - they took one bite and refused to eat more.  I thought it was ok, but really blah.  Too mushy and not much taste.

I used skim milk, substituted ground flax seed in place of the wheat germ, and cooked it in the microwave. It was an enjoyable meal except for too much cinnamon for my taste (and I really like cinnamon). Next time, I will cut it in half.

Tasty oatmeal.  I cut this recipe in 1/2, except I did use 1/2 cup oats.  I only added a tiny bit of applesauce because I didn't want it to have a strong apple flavor and it didn't need any more moisture added.  Happy that I tried this one, but I have had better oatmeal recipes, so I don't know that this one will be a re-do.

I've made this with blueberries, strawberries, and the two combined... it's super tasty, I imagine it would apply to almost any fruit. I use frozen fruits for convenience and it loses nothing in doing that. My mom, who used to gag on oatmeal, can eat this. :)

I was looking for something to warm me up, and found this recipe.  I used old fashioned oats, unsweetened applesauce and frozen blueberries.  The blueberries turned the oatmeal purple when added with them all the other ingredients.  I bet they can be added towards the end to avoid the color change.  I give this 4 stars because the result does seem like it is missing something.  I added brown sugar and loved it!  Next time I think I'll add a dash of real maple syrup instead.

I really liked this. I did it different though. I already had oatmeal in the freezer so I unthawed  that and added a touch of milk and also used blackberries instead on top with a sprinkle of walnuts and cinnamon. I didn't use sugar because it was sweet enough for me.

a good oatmeal but not fantastic. I found the finished product too runny and a little bland even after adding some vanilla. The ingredients are fantastic and I like not adding any salt but I'm on the lookout for the elusive ingredient that will make this oatmeal great.

I'm used to more slushy oatmeal, and sweeter too. It was a bit bland, and too thick. Also, next time I'll put 1 teaspoon cinnamon instead of 2. But I'm sure its pretty healthy.

I really enjoyed this! Next time I will try frozen blueberries but I had a very ripe banana to use! I used quick oats, and my oatmeal cooked in a few minutes, instead of 8-10 min as listed. I also used a little more Splenda; I like sweetness! Will make again!

For my single serving, I cooked the milk, water, and oats in the microwave for 1-1/2 minutes, added the remaining ingredients (except sugar) and zapped for another half minute.
A most excellent breakfast!

Definitely a great blend of flavors and great texture, but, like others said, a bit bland.  I tripled the recipe for my family of five and added 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and about a teaspoon of Stevita brand stevia.  In the end, it was probably 1/4 teaspoon too much of both the salt and the Stevita.  I will most certainly make it again, but add butter for a richer flavor.

I used strawberries instead of blueberries.  This recipe is a nice change (and smells soooo good) from the usual bland oatmeal, plus, it makes two of three servings.  Thanks for the healthy recipe!  :)

I used instant oatmeal with this recipe and it worked out just great. I'm on a high fiber kick lately due to the fact that one of my best buds ended up in the hospital with intensinal problems primarily due to lack of fiber. Because it was instant, I didn't need to add the sugar. Good stuff Cassandra and I thank you for a great lunch today!

I ate the full two servings of this oatmeal for lunch and it was delicious!  I set out to find the perfect oatmeal recipe over the summer and I think I already found it!
