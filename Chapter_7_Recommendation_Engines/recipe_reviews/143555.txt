Hi Shelby, I agree I don't like to use the onion soup mix either.  I searched and found a homemade version here is is..  3/4 cup dried minced onion 1/3 cup NO MSG beef bouillon powder 4 tsp onion powder 1/4 tsp celery salt 1/4 tsp sugar  Directions   Combine all ingredients. You can store it in a ziplock bag or air-tight container. It keeps for quite a while.

Absolutely fantastic. I can't stop eating it! The dressing is phenomenal. Quite a bit of work chopping all the veggies and dicing the chicken, but my goodness is it totally worth it. I doubled the recipe but regret I didn't triple it!

A wonderful summer salad!  A light and healthy salad which stands on its own without the need for anything else on the side.  The dressing has a wonderful flavor although once it's mixed in with all of the vegetables it becomes very mild which is not necessarily a bad thing.  Delicious & fresh!

If I could give this salad 10 stars, I would. A lot of my favorite things (except raw red onions) in one dish. I wasn't sure about mixing dry onion soup mix with toasted sesame oil, ginger and orange juice, but it was delicious! Everyone loved it. I followed the recipe except I used a very small amount of diced Vidalia onion (personal taste), a tiny bit less of the soup mix (was a little concerned about the amount of salt) and a little more orange juice (we love citrus dressings). For the chicken, we have an excellent little pizza/sub shop in the area with the best grilled chicken breast sandwiches. I called and ordered a couple of the breasts (plain - just salt and pepper and grilled) and picked them up on the way home. Easy and cheap! All of the flavors and ingredients just went together perfectly. Can't wait for leftovers tomorrow for lunch. We will have this often. Thanks for sharing!

My family thought this was really good. When I came home the next day all of the leftovers were gone. :( My mom put some of the leftovers on a freah bed of additional spinach and said it was even better the 2nd day. My husband ate his leftovers right out of the container. The only thing I didn't care for was chewing on the bits of ginger and I thought it didn't really need so much oil. Next time I am going to cut the oil in 1/2 and use powdered ginger.  Thanks for great summer meal!

So good! I was nervous about using the onion soup mix cause i am not a fan but i followed the recipe and the results were great. The dressing blended nicely. I will keep this recipe on hand and make it for guests. Not only does it taste good it looks pretty as well.

I very much enjoyed this recipe!  The colors were bright and the flavors were good.  I followed the recipe exactly as written and would definitely make this again.  However, I would make one small change and that is I would try green onions instead of red onions.  The red are good but had a bit of a bite to them and green onions would work perfectly with the Asian flavors in this salad.  Also, I would use a little less sesame oil at first and add as needed.  It was a little heavy on the sesame flavor for me, but that could just be my taste.  Overall, solid recipe!

We love this salad! I have used frozen grilled chicken strips and freshly grilled chicken breast, either way works great.  The dressing is awesome and great color and texture.

I've already made this salad twice in one week, because it's THAT good... once just for me and my husband and again a few days later for company. Other than the spinach, which we used the amount recommended, I added a bit more of each of the veggies, because we like our veggies. I diced the raw chicken up and tossed it with a commercial honey-teriyaki sauce before baking for the salad. It gave it a great flavor. It's a terrific recipe and thanks for sharing.

Can't wait to make this! Just a hint to keep ginger on hand.  Buy a piece and wrap tightly in foil, then peel with a spoon and grate as needed :) Trick I learned from Rachel Ray.

Very tasty!  I doubled the recipe but used HALF of the onion soup mix in the dressing.  Also to save time, I used already prepared roasted whole chicken that my grocery store sells.  I also used ground ginger from my spice supply.  I will make this again!

I made it today. I did not care for it and neither did my husband. Too oily and the flavor is blah. Followed the recipe except for the almonds as I did not have any. Will not make again.

Very, very good!  I made it exactly as written except I used chopped almonds rather than sliced as I couldn't find sliced.  After trying it as written, I thought a bit of crushed red pepper would be a nice touch (but I didn't add it for the kids) so I sprinkled crushed red pepper over mine and my husband's.  This will make the monthly menu!

This was a huge hit!  I added the dressing right before I served it and this kept the salad from wilting.  We had it for lunch and dinner the next night!  Yummy!

delicious! this is definitely a family favorite. What makes it killer though, is to tenderize and marinate the chicken in a little bit of the dressing sans onion soup mix. Then I bake the chicken for 20 minutes at 375. It's very much worth the extra effort!

This is delicious and so very pretty!  Like all salads, it is a little work, but you can (and should) prepare it early, so there are no last-minute things to do, which is a big plus for me.  The only changes I made were to use regular sesame oil (I have not found toasted sesame oil) and used rice wine vinegar.  They were both just fine.  My only change for the next time will be to place the spinach as a bed in the salad bowls, and serve the rest on top.  I found the spinach difficult to incorporate into the salad bowl, even though I used baby spinach. I love the dressing also, and I did use regular onion soup mix.

The first time I made this, I followed the recipe exactly. The dish just didn't have enough flavor.

The second time, I made a larger batch of dressing and substituted homemade onion soup mix. I also threw together a bunch of the dressing ingredients to make a marinade for the chicken. I let both the dressing and chicken sit overnight. WOW, it was so much better this time! Just a tip, though: maybe I used too much dressing, but the spinach got slimy quite quickly. This definitely meant to be eaten right away.

Since everyone loved this I will give it 5 stars too. I couldn't help but smile as I read the reviews. The onion soup mix is loaded with MSG and the reason it is used is to enhance the flavor of food. It gives a lot of people migraine headaches. I was one until my doctor told me I was allgeric to it. If someone could tell me where to find Onion soup mix WITHOUT MSG or what I could substitute in place of it, I would love to try this salad.

I had 5 girlfriends for dinner and they raved about it!  I doubled the dressing and made it 2 days ahead.  This gave it time to meld all the spices and soften the onions in the soup mix.  I made the noodles the morning of , added all the vegetables and part of the dressing.  When it was times to serve I mixed in the spinach and the rest of the dressing. I cut up the spinach before adding.  I used powdered ginger and just a few pinches as it can overwhelm a recipe.  Just fabulous!

I was very disappointed after all the work that went into this salad. No one really liked it. It was very bland and I wanted to add soy sauce, but was out! I did use the onion soup mix suggested by the first reviewer and my grocery store did not have sesame oil. I really doubt whether that would have salvaged it. I added more rice vinegar and sugar and salt.

I love when dinner's a hit!  Yes, this is GOOD!  I changed it up slightly:  I used bacon instead of chicken (and toasted the almonds in the bacon drippings.  Ok, now that's good!)  Other than that, I used the juice from the canned mandarin oranges instead of orange juice and used a little more sugar than was called for.  It was a bit bitter before doing this.  Man, this was really good, and I'll be making it again and again.

I thought this salad was excellent. I wondered about the onion soup mix, but went ahead and made the recipe as written except I added dressing to the individual servings instead of the whole thing so it wouldn't be soggy the next day. It was colorful and flavorful. I'll be making it again.

This is wonderful.  I had to make a slight change as I didn't have dry onion soup mix, so I used a package of dry Italian Salad Dressing mix.  The recipe makes a lot of sauce, next time I will use more pasta.

This is delicious.  Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe.  I doubled the dressing so I could have some to add the next day - the noodles absorbed it.

Mmmmm! This was yummy!  I did omit the oil and used vegetarian chicken.  I have never cooked w/ onion soup mix, but I did love the dressing! Thanks!

So fresh, so delicious.  Dressing could be a little more flavorful, perhaps by adding a touch more ginger.  Of course, we didn't use fresh ginger, so maybe that would have helped.

This was a good side dish with beer can chicken.  I omitted the chicken from the pasta for this reason; and added parmesan cheese. Delicious!

I love this salad! I wouldn't change anything except, I don't mix it all together. I chop everything, of course make the dressing, and put everything in separate glass containers.
At my house we are all on our own schedules so with the ingredients  separate any one of us can build our own salad when time permits!!
It lasts for a couple of days this way also.

The sauce turned out really well; it added much more flavors and smoothed out the texture for a lot of the vegetables. We took away the onions, and added fresh orange juice to the sauce instead of orange juice to bring out a more tangy and fresher taste. I would add more chicken, because after eating only the vegetables and a piece of meat every so often; you sort of want to eat more meat. Our final product contained almost all the colors of the rainbow. It tasted and looked very appealing. I would definitely recommend this recipe to another person; light and healthy that gives you a boost for the rest of the day. It's a feast to the senses!

Really enjoyed.  Dressing was great. Put ingredients in a mason jar and shook vigorously to emusify.  A lot of prep time cutting and chopping, but very good in the end.

I would give it 10 stars if I could.  Only change is that I used a Yellow Bell Pepper instead of a Red one.  Everything else was exactly as the recipe called for.  Amazing flavors.

I really like this. I made half of a recipe but put in some more spinach. I didn't buy red pepper as had some frozen then thought no that would not work for fresh. So id did not put any in, still really good. as have gone gluten free I no longer can get bow tie so used rice based rigatoni otherwise made as listed

This recipe is delicious. It's a meal in one if you use chicken. I made it as a side dish, so I left out the chicken and added salami. The salad dressing is heavenly. Also, mandarins were out of season here in SA, so I used the only citrus I could find; clementines.

I really like this salad, very refreshing and satisfies with all the food groups. Because I am a little lazy by the end of the day, I found a bottled dressing that I think works really well- Marie's Sesame Ginger, found in the produce section, refrigerated. I also marinated the pasta with a bit of the dressing (2 T. or so) for an hour or longer if preferred in the fridge, covered. Great recipe katrinp! I just like shortcuts if they work and this seemed to come very close. Thanks!

Other than omitting the chicken since we are vegetarians and adding a bit of cilantro, I make this as is. People at parties love this recipe. They comment that it is a nice change from more common pasta salads and every last bit gets eaten. Thanks for this recipe!

I didn't have orange juice so I used mandarin juice and a 1/2 teaspoon of orange extract for flavor. I marinated the chicken for a hour in 1/4 cup of teriyaki sauce 1 clove of garlic and 1 teaspoon of ginger paste. and 1/2 teaspoon of orange extract. to mimic flavors of sauce. Baked the chicken in oven for 20 minutes in 350 degree oven. then followed the rest of directions, made the sauce a head of time and let the flavors come together. topped with a few sesame seed for garnish. After tasting the chicken I was very pleased, the flavors was pronounce and woke up my taste buds. The rest of the salad had great flavors. Thanks, Happy Cooking!

Delicious! I let my food processor do the slicing and dicing while the pasta cooked, which greatly reduced the prep time. Also substituted ginger powder for the fresh stuff, halving the amount when switching to powder seemed to do just the trick. For me, there was so much already going on in this recipe that the chicken wasn't really necessary, I think going forward I'll leave it out. Can't wait to make this for a party because it yields a lot and sure to be a crowd pleaser.

This was delicious. I cut the sugar in half and added some of the pasta water to it after I combined all the veggies. Being Italian it was very hard not to add Parmesan cheese but it didn't need it. Even my hubby loved it. Will definitely be making this a lot!

My family loved this dish!  I used green onion because that's what I had on hand, but I know it would be good with red onion as well.  Next time I make it I will use a little less vegetable oil, but even as is this recipe is perfect!

I found this receipt right after I received my first Farm Fresh to You delivery of fruits and vegetables.  My basket had mandarin oranges, juice oranges, carrots, greens and shallots (which I subbed for the spinach and red onion).  I used 1/2 onion soup b/c it was what I had on hand.  Otherwise, made just as directed.  Everyone who tasted it proclaimed it delicious.  Thanks for the great recipe and a chance to use so many ingredients from my basket in one delicious salad.  P.S. Made the dressing the day before I made the salad to divide the labor.

My family loved this pasta salad. I prepared this recipe using the Easy Grilled Chicken Teriyaki from the evening before and "oh my" it was delicious. The flavors married as I expected. I also used Italian dressing instead of the onion soup mix. Thess are two recipes I will combined again and again! --Sharon

Just made this for first time. It was fantastic!! Will make again and again. I marinated my chicken in some of the sauce for 2 hrs before grilling on cast iron griddle. I also left out tomatoes as I thought it would be better without-personal opinion. Also served it chilled the day after making it, and tossed with spinach and nuts just before serving.

I made this exactly as the recipe directs, and it is wonderful, tasty, colorful and healthy.  I will make it again. Be sure to use a BIG bowl, as makes a lot of salad!  I had to transfer it to a larger bowl when I first starting combining the ingredients. The next time I might cut back to 1/2 teaspoon of sesame oil  (it was a tad strong to me), add slightly more garlic and ginger (if you have leftovers, the water in the cucumbers, etc. will dilute the dressing a bit if it sits over night). I would even consider omitting or reducing the pasta, just to make it a lower-carb meal.  And someone suggesting trying shrimp instead of chicken, and that would work, too! But this is a wonderful salad, as is!

great salad! Took a long time to prep everything, and the sauce/ final salad needs salt, so I added soy sauce to taste. Not a salad the average person can throw together with what's in their pantry though, I had to buy just about everything on the list so it got a little expensive, but man... after adding soy sauce.. SO YUMMY!!

I loved this. I make it for summer potlucks at church. It is always a big hit. It is a bit on the salty side, but I have never had any complaints. It is a little time consuming to make. all the chopping is kind of a pain, but the finished product is well worth it.

This is a delicious recipe, though it's a lot of salad, so I would suggest doubling the dressing since it's the most delicious part of the meal, I also tried this with shrimp instead of chicken and it was scrumptious! thanks for adding!

One of the best salads I've ever had.  You will want to make extra of this! I see several complaints about how long this takes to make, but I didn't think this was bad at all.  I do recommend buying a ginger paste (look for the Gourmet Garden tube of ginger in the refrigerated produce section of the store).  I put in a good heaping tablespoon of this in the dressing, and I also put in a couple splashes of extra orange juice.  Next time I will see if I can get away with less oil, but I stuck to the recipe this time around.  I also used grape tomatoes rather than cutting up roma tomatoes.  I grilled a couple of chicken breasts with a peppercorn mix rub and it all went together perfectly.  Will make this over and over.  I know this will be a bit hit at our neighborhood pot lucks this summer!

My husband is picky and didn't like it. He said he didn't like the mandarin oranges or the pasta in it and it was bland. If I put more dressing on it, I didn't mind it. It was light and healthy.

So tasty!!!  I used ginger powder also,  but kept everything else the same for the dressing.  For the salad--I just used what was on hand, and turned out delicious!!  I had some green beans that I boiled and drained and cut into bite-sized pieces, used up a zucchini and made thin slices with it--and also chopped up some cabbages.  My hubby and i LOOOVED it.  I also used the rosemary ranch chicken kabob recipe from this site for the chicken, and surprisingly the flavors don't collide...it tasted awesome and it was easy!  I used my foreman grill instead of a real one.  I wish i could give it more stars too!

This salad was superb. The dressing tasted so delicious that I have to admit that I am suprised that dry onion soup mix made it. The fresh ginger really added an authenticity to the taste, and the left-over grilled chicken that I used blended very nicely with the other flavors. I was looking for something that would stand alone as a dinner to take for a picnic and this was just right. Thanks for the tasty recipe!

amazing!  It is important to only add the listed quantities of ingredients! for example, don't just throw in the whole cucumber, pepper, the approximate amount of spinach...etc.  I did this once and it diluted the taste way too much!!! follow the directions and it is PERFECT!

Excellent! Reminded me of the chopped salad at Noodles & Co. I followed the recipe and scored BIG flavors that really complemented each other very nicely. I loved the orange juice in the dressing--a nice citrusy twist on a standard Asian salad. -I completely forgot to pick up spinach and didn't feel like going out into the cold winter weather to pick it up... while I would have enjoyed the addition, it certainly did not make me feel like anything was missing. **Leftovers were great the next day too!

Great Salad! Lots of work.  This salad was really good.  Everyone that tasted it liked it.  However, it probably was the most time consuming pasta salad I've ever made.  It took me about an hour.  Maybe I'm just not as quick as most.  If you like Asian style salads you will really like it.  The dressing is great!

This was delicious.  The only thing I did differently was to stir some of the dressing into the chicken and let it marinate overnight before assembling the rest of the salad.  It also helps to assemble everything but the spinach an hour, or two, ahead, to let the flavors blend.

This is a wonderful, wonderful recipe!  I made it for my cooking group and they went back for seconds (even though dessert was beckoning them).  I tried with powdered ginger, and it just wasn't as good.  Finely mince the ginger and red pepper and definitely let the dressing 'cure' in the frig for a few hours.

This recipe makes quite a bit of the pasta portion.  I did not mix the spinach in but put some on each of our plates.  Then I spooned the pasta portion on top.  This way, I could store the pasta portion without having the spinach get soggy.  It is an excellent recipe, especially during the summer months.  I didn't have time to make the dressing so I used Paul Newman's Sesame/Ginger salad dressing instead.

This is a really nice pasta salad.  I served it for a luncheon today and everyone was very complementary.  My only problem came because I double the recipe and ended up with two large bowls.  The six servings must be very large!  I will definitely make this again.

This is really really good.  It sounded good to me, but I was afraid that it wouldn't get past my husband and son . . They can be pretty eclectic, but I thought this might just be too different.  Then my ten year old son invited one of his friends to dinner as well.  They ALL cleaned their plates and went back for seconds.  And my husband requested that I find more recipes similar to this for summer dinners!  I made almost exactly per recipe.  Just substituted green onion for the red, and added a bit more orange juice & sugar to the dressing per our tastes.  In the rotation for our long summers.

I've made this twice--the first time exactly as written and loved it. The next time I made it I didn't have time to run to the store and improvised with what I had on hand and it was still great--don't be afraid to experiment. I didn't have any chicken but had a bag of medium shrimp in the freezer, which I steamed and cut the bigger ones in half. I only had cherry tomatoes on hand, so I cut each of them in half. I cut back on the onion and added a little lemon pepper to the dressing. Finally I added a splash of soy sauce to the dressing. It was amazing, and I think it would be just as good with chicken.

This was a GORGEOUSLY FRESH SALAD. So pretty and tasted great. I thought there was plenty of flavor in the dressing and boy does this salad make a TON. This was a very tasty salad on a hot summer night. Only sub was a sweet onion and I used 2 BBQ chicken breasts from a previous dinner.

I served this at my Mother's repast reception and it was a HIT.  I did make some changes, as follows.  I was serving approx. 30 people.

4 tsp white sugar (instead of 2); No cucumber; 1/2 cup diced green bell pepper; 1/2 bag shredded carrots (instead of 1 shredded carrot); 2 cans of mandarin oranges (instead of 1); 4 cups diced cooked chicken (instead of 2); 1 can water chestnuts, drained and cut into 1/4s; 16 oz tub fresh strawberries, drained and sliced into 1/4ths.

Everyone at the reception really loved this recipe! Thanks, KatrinP!!

We really enjoyed this salad. The flavors worked will together and it wasn't overwhelmingly salty or sesame oil tasting. The fresh veggies give it wonderful color.

This was a very good recipe, didn't feel like making orange juice so used one tablespoon concentrate...worked great:)  My kids begged me to make it again for them soon...but they would like more bowtie pasta.

I really enjoyed the dressing on this salad.  Many members expressed concern about the sodium in the onion soup mix, but I felt it blended quite well with the other ingredients involved in the mix.  It is a lot of work.  My big worry was when to assemble the entire salad in fear that the contents would either dry out or get mushy.  I made the dressing and grilled the chicken the night before, and assembled the entire salad the day of our party.  The mixture sat refrigerated for a long time, and it was very good.  However, I must say that the dish tasted a lot better the next day.  In the future, I will make the salad the night before and also possibly increase the amount of dressing to bolden the flavor.

All I can say is "WOW!" I made this yesterday for a Labor Day picnic. It was devoured, so I had to make another trip to the grocery store to get more ingredients for another today! Yum! I made the homemade onion soup mix and used about 1/3 c of the dry mix in the dressing mix.

I love this salad! I'm not particularly fond of the texture of the fresh spinach leaves and will leave them out next time, but the taste is wonderful! I'll be making this for the next cook out. :)

This salad was D-E-licious!  I noticed some reviewers were saying that it was a lot of prep work, but I didn't think it was a big deal and it went together pretty quickly.  I grilled the chicken for mine and it added some nice texture and a deeper flavor.  The dressing was divine!

Made as written and something was missing.  I checked a couple other other recipes and found they called for 2 tablespoons soy sauce and 1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds.  Sure enough that really kicked it up to an Asian dressing.

So good! I made a few alterations. I dont care for raw red onion, so I subbed chopped green onion, I used fresh squeezed orange for the orange juice, and added a little of the canned mandarin juice. also since my husband doesn't like vinegar, I cut that amount in half and it still turned out delicious.

I make this regularly, this is "WOW!" if done right.  A helpful summary of tips: 
First and foremost definitely use 1/3 cup of reviewer Debbie's homemade onion soup mix (a batch includes: 3/4 c minced onion, 1/3 no MSG beef bouillon powder (low salt also if possible, I use Epicure's), a heaping Tbsp onion powder, 1/4 tsp celery salt, 1/4 tsp sugar; the unused remainder stores well in an airtight container). I use this for homemade veggie dips all the time too!
Secondly, at least double the sesame oil, ginger, garlic, sugar in the dressing, to your tastes. Also use orange juice concentrate instead of OJ itself. This all gives the dressing a more intense flavour, which is needed. The original recipe is a bit bland as written. You can use red pepper flakes if you would like a kick to it.
This salad tastes better on day 2. 
Refrigerate  at least for 4-5 hours before serving to allow flavours to meld, but don't add the leafy greens until just before serving so they aren't wilted.
I try to use whole grain pasta if I can find WG bowtie for better nutrition. I usually serve this as a side dish so I don't  include chicken usually. Sometimes I add other veggies like broccoli instead of spinach. 
I can only give 4 stars as written but this is so worth making!!!

everything about this dish is fantastic except the work that goes into it.  i'm not sure how someone, anyone prepped this in 45 minutes.  make sure you are not hungry, because it takes a while to complete.  but soooo delicious.

Made this for a luncheon and received great reviews.  However,the spinach did not hold up for serving the next day.  If the salad is not being served immediately, I recommend the spinach be added just before serving.  You might also prepare all the ingredients and the dressing ahead of time, then combine just before serving.

I followed the recipe exactly as written and took it to a potluck where we had 30 people.  After reading the recipe I thought it would be great for a large crowd.  It made plenty but had little flavor.  Nobody said they liked it and no one went back for seconds.  I felt it needed more salt to bring out the flavors but even this did not help.  Half of it went into the trash.

The first time I made it,  pretty much followed the recipe.  I don't like bell peppers, so I omitted those and didn't add the spinach until I served it, even as leftovers.  I made this yesterday and made these changes.  I used savoy cabbage, it holds up better for leftovers, spinach gets yucky.  I also cut up snow peas to add crunch and color, since I don't like peppers.  To make the dressing a bit more savory, I added 1Tbls soy sauce and left out the sugar.  The orange juice and slices is enough sweetness for me.  This makes a very satisfying meal

I made this and it was sooooo good!  The recipe makes quite a large batch, so might cut it in half next time.

very nice salad, lots of cutting of vegetables, I did add a few hard boiled eggs .  
the dressing was a little strong when I tasted it by itself, but was much better when I tried it on the salad.
my son and I will liked it but hubby didn't care for dressing.  he likes blue cheese

I made this for a crowd and it was one of the dishes I made ahead of time.   Knowing better, I poured all of the dressing on the salad at the time I made it.   Of course the pasta absorbed the dressing and though it was still wonderful, the salad would have been better if I had left half of the dressing until serving time.    Must say it was a fabulous addition to my whole dinner.

I didn't care for this at all - was hoping for bright and refreshing but found the tomatoes battled with the mandarin oranges - not a pleasing combination.

I loved this! It’s delicious and unique from the same old same old pasta salad we always see. The dressing is delicious with a distinct “oriental” flavor and I will probably double it next time. My only critique was that even though I spent extra time with the raw garlic and ginger, I still bit into little bitter pieces that I did not care for. I may try leaving them out or subbing powders in next time and seeing how it affects the flavor. I will be making this again and again though!

The ingredients made this sound delicious. I followed the recipe and maybe that's where I goofed. For all of the ingredients and delicious-sounding dressing, this dish turned out bland. My children gave it a try but just did not enjoy it. I ate it, but was kind of bored with it myself.

This was delicious. it hit the spot and amazed me when I made it perfectly. I had to substitute a little because I didn't have sesame oil. I toasted sesame seeds and put the in the oil while I made everything else. then added the vegetable oil with seeds last. It was really good!

I agree this is addictive. Everyone can't get enough of this salad. The second time I made it I added one can of water chestnuts (diced), sesame seeds and 1 extra tsp of Rice Vinegar to give it a little more zip.

I definitely have this in my keeper file, it was delicious. I used a roasted chicken from the grocery store, a little more spinach and chicken and a little less pasta.  Great for a ladies luncheon or light dinner on a warm summer evening.

Next time, will use olive oil (personal preference).

I made this for my family. I didn't add the onion soup mix but added minced onion instead. It turned out pretty well. I did use canned chicken and ground pepper. My family liked it. I will use this again especially during the summer.

I made the recipe yesterday. Very colorful, needed more salt. Would I make it again?  No. Some went wild over the dressing. I thought it was only OK. I loved that it had so many healthy ingredients. I didn’t use bow tie pasta but used elbow   We aren’t crazy about “big” pasta. Diane Lynn

We really enjoyed this salad.  It can get expensive to make though if you don't already have sesame oil, rice vinegar and sliced almonds in the pantry.  Used chow mein noodles instead of sliced almonds. After putting the dressing together I discovered a partial bottle of Trader Joe's Soy-ginger vinaigrette in the fridge and added that too.   Next time I might just use the bottled dressing to save time.

Well, we are a 4 person family and we weren’t sure how much it would yield (6 servings sounded like it wasn’t enough), so we doubled it—and wow! did it make a lot of food. It’s tasty and filling due to all the veggies, but it could have used just a little more dressing. Very tasty either way!!

This is an insanely good recipe.  All of my kids request it, and it's time consuming, so I hate that they like it so much.  But even though it makes a lot, there's never leftovers.  The dressing is amazing.  Make sure to use fresh ginger, it makes all the difference.  (I usually add a bit extra, we like ginger)

This is a great little pasta salad. The only thing I did differently was to add dried cherries (1/2 cup) to it. I will make this again. I took it to a Fourth of July outing today and everyone loved it.

This is a very good salad.  I loved it.  I cut down the rice vinegar slightly as I don't particularly like it and I just used sliced baby cucumbers instead of de-seeding long ones.

This was delicious. I made a few modifications based on what I had on hand. I used shell pasta, a 50/50 spring mix/spinach, left out the bell pepper and tomatoes (hubby hates raw tomatoes) and used fresh-squeezed Honeybell orange juice and another honeybell orange peeled, segmented and sliced and used a vidalia onion instead of red. I also  added 2 slices of thick cut bacon (diced and browned), toasted the almonds in the bacon fat and drained, then cooked the chicken cubes (lightly seasoned with salt, pepper and powdered ginger) in the bacon fat with about a tablespoon of diced onion, then deglazed the pan with about 1/8 cup of the fresh oj. I then added the chicken/onion mixture to the dressing and refrigerated for about 3 hours. Tossed it all together when it was serving time. Hubby went back for seconds and I actually ate raw onion. I think the only change I’ll make is to use green onions and add halved cherry tomatoes next time. It does make a lot, so use a big bowl. Thanks for sharing. I can see this being a crowd-pleaser.

Very good ! I needed a salad for Lent and the chicken substituted out well with firm tofu (saute in a little sesame oil).  It does require a lot of chopping but worth it.  I doubled the slivered almonds to add some more flavor.

Excellent. Definitely a keeper. I make a lot of salads and this has become a much requested favorite. Family, including picky men, and friends love it!  Holds up for a couple of days too if you keep the dressing separate.  I've made it several times.  My "go faster" tweaks are:  Use Dole fruit cup mandarin oranges, rotisserie chicken (I always buy rotisserie chickens, pull the meat off, and freeze in freezer bags - 2 quart sized bags per chicken -  so I have chicken available),  use pre-shredded carrots, and  use the copycat Lipton Onion Dry Soup mix recipe on this site when I don't have the packages.  Making this now to take to a friend in the hospital.  Thanks for this great recipe!

This salad was delicious, filling and healthy.  The only changes I made included using Rotisserie chicken (for convenience) and substituting pine nuts for the toasted almonds - more costly but  worth the extra money in giving it that WOW factor. Tastes even better the second and third day.  I highly recommend letting the dressing sit for 24 hours.  Perfect for dinner or lunch.  One of my favorite recipes on this site.

This was good! My hubby and I enjoyed it, but my mom and 2yo weren't impressed. I followed the recipe, except I used whole wheat rotini pasta instead of bow tie. I think it got better with every bite

Everything but the kitchen sink...I did add a little celery, broccoli, and mushroom. I think a better dressing would have been some kind of fruit vinaigrette. I used fresh mandarin and it went well with all the vegetables.

A delicious and nearly guilt-free dish!!!!

It does take quite awhile to chop-up everything, but as soon as I tasted it, it was WELL worth it.

A few changes I made:
- I opted to just use store-bought light balsamic dressing.
- Skipped the red onions (don't care for them).
-  Added sun-dried tomatoes.

Things I'll do next time:
- Add sliced avocado.
- More red bell pepper.. it adds a great kick!

It was very good, just not as good as the picture looks.  The dressing was a bit runny and I had to pour some of the dressing back to the bowl as there was too much of it in the salad.  Also, when using a bag of spinach, remember to just put 2/3 of the bag as that is a lot of salad.  Also, just add 2/3 of the Farfalle pasta as well because that too is a lot of pasta.

We make this salad several times during the summer. Only changes I made was  omit the veg oil an replace with 1/8 c of Olive oil.  Also, I dont add the dressing until it is ready to serve.  Dressing is made the night before.

I made this for a get together, and it was well received. I substituted shells instead bowtie pasta, and cut down the dressing amount. It worked great as a leftover, I just added more spinach each time, and more reserved dressing. I will make it again as the flavor is very good.

I thought this was a great summer salad.  Easy.  I ran EVERYTHING thru the food processor and should have made more of an effort to drain & dry the cut veges before putting them in the salad because they seemed heavy.    I put the sauce in a Magic Bullet and mixed it there.   It was really good.   I would make this again, perhaps double the sauce and pour some over the hot pasta, then use the rest as a dressing.

Only changes I made was to use only half the onion soup mix. I used romaine instead of the spinach. It's really tasty and I would make this again for sure. Could easily have this without the chicken and I wouldn't miss it. Oh, also I used a green onion instead of the red. We will be having this often this summer!! Could use any veggies or pasta I think. Was pretty leery of the dressing but it's delish. Don't think I'd want a full packet of the onion soup mix tho

I took this to our Memorial Day picnic. Everyone loved it as an alternative to the traditional spiral pasta salad we usually have. Me kids aged 8 and 11 wolfed it down like starving urchins! The flavors were very good together. I will definitely make it again. Even though the directions say serve immediately, it was very good the next day!

My whole family loved this recipe. I made it as written. Normally  when using canned fruit I buy in water or juice, but decided to go with light syrup for this one and I'm glad I did. The lightly sweetened oranges help balance red onion and rice vinegar nicely. I believe boiled medium shrimp or thinly sliced pork would do well here too. We will have this many times.

I loved this. It was a lot of prep but so worth it. This dish had everything; the proteins from the delicious pasta as well as the chicken and nuts; I bit of a kick from the onions(i used white onion because its what i had) and peppers; the sweetness of the mandarin orange segments; and the freshness of the cucumber and spinach and tomato. This dish was just perfectly put together I couldn't stop eating it. Also I didn't have orange juice so I mixed a little orange extract with water. I'm not sure if that altered the flavor but this was a big hit for me.

I normally do not like pasta salad, but I made this for my son before a big race. Not only did he devour it, my daughter who hates pasta loved it, and my husband could not stop raving!! The only thing I did different was use cherry tomatoes, I will definitely make it again.

I decided to make this at the last minute because I had some left over chicken and some pasta. I did not have any spinach so didn't use that but it was very good.  I also subbed very good olive oil for the other oils.  no onion soup either...sounds like I changed a lot of stuff but read so many others that didn't use the onion soup so just used grated onion and some salt and pepper.

A delicious refreshing salad... I made a few adjustments based on what I had in the pantry and my palate... Used rotini pasta;  just a tablespoon of olive oil;  coconut palm sugar; and two cloves of garlic.  Great option for dinner on a hot summer day!

Loved this recipe. I've made it several times. Followed advice of a former reviewer to sub homemade onion soup mix to be msg-free. I've subbed other fruit and veggies. It's always a hit.

I just made this for dinner and it was a complete success! Probably the best pasta salad I have ever had and it was perfect after a whole day of playing outside. I will make 1 1/2 times the dressing next time it is so delishious!

Just wonderful.  I did add a whole cucumber and sweet onions instead of red.  Added a touch more sesame oil and topped off with toasted sesame seeds.  Family raved over it.  Can't wait for leftovers.

We loved this salad,  My husband usually will have one serving of a salad and that is it.  This salad he had every day until it was gone.  This recipe will be used again and again.  (I didn't make any changes, perfect the way it is!)

After reading the reviews, I made these changes---
>to save on chopping time of veggies, I purchased a container of "Trinity" in the produce dept, and added 1/2 cup of chopped Vidalia Onion; cut baby carrots I had on hand into small pieces
>doubled the dressing recipe, using only 1 onion mix envelope and 1/2 of the oil  (oil goes a long way, you really don't need much)
>made 3 Cups of chicken
>poured 1/2 of the dressing into a bag with the cooked diced chicken, let it marinate for 4 hours before serving
At dinnertime, I tossed it all together and served. It was good.
BUT The salad was SO MUCH better after it had marinated altogether after 24 hours! Next time I make this (and I will), I'll make it exactly the way I did as described here, EXCEPT I will make a day ahead and let everything marinate, adding the spinach when served so it's not wilted.
ANOTHER SUGGESTION, if you don't have time to marinate, skip the dressing and marinating part of the recipe and use "Cardini's Roasted Asian Sesame Dressing" (or your favorite Asian dressing)
**Thanks, KatrinP** for posting the recipe!! Isn't it fun to take someone's recipe, personalize it and make it your own???

This was fabulous!  I made it according to the recipe, but used the fresh ginger paste and the fresh chunky garlic paste instead of all the grating, peeling and pressing.  To make it easy, just buy a rotisserie chicken and shred the meat, rather then cutting into cubes.   And, you might want to double the recipe for the dressing because it is an amazing Asian flavor.  I will definitely make this summertime salad again!

I first made it without the almonds, onion and spinach. It is also great this way too. Next time I made it exactly as the recipe said and it is also great. It is a recipe that you can do a lot with if you want a different taste. My husband is not fond of the dressing so I put a fat free Zesty Italian dressing on it for him and it is very good this way too. Great recipe.

Just cooked this tonight.  WOW.... It was awesome.  When I read the recipe, it tasted great.  But when I actually put it together, it was more than my virtual taste buds expected.  I did change it up just a little.  I sauted the chicken in garlic, soy sauce and a little salt.  I felt the chicken needed as much flavor as the rest of the dish.  I also reduced the amount of oil by half and did not use any sugar.  Everything else was by recipe including the Dry Onion Soup Mix.  Oh, I also used slivered almonds that I roasted in the oven instead of shaved.  Thank you for sharing such a flavorful and awesome dish.  Made a great meal for me and my wife.  Thanks.

This is a yummy salad!! In the summer, all ingredients are easy to find and inexpensive. Used a 1 cup electrical chopper, so prep was fast. Grated ginger, did not chop it. Mostly stuck to the recipe- except deleted onion soup. Used 2 tsp onion powder + 1/2 tsp soy sauce. Other amounts were perfect for me. This feeds 6, but I made it for a pot luck and it fed 18 as a side.

This is very good.  I love all the colors and the salty sweet flavor.  I poached my chicken in water with an added Asian spice.  I will definitely make this again.

Do not mix the spinach in with the pasta if you want leftovers.  Instead, place the salad on a bed of fresh spinach for each serving.  For the person who objected to the diced ginger, try grating fresh ginger on a micro plane grater-- same great flavor without the objectionable texture.

It is delicious and light.

Excellent salad! I left out the red pepper and red onion because of the tastes of a couple of the people eating it. Next time I will make it as written and I expect it to be even better - if that's possible! I added about 1/8 c water to the dressing because it seemed a little dry - otherwise it was perfect! Definitely will make it again!

Followed the recipe exactly except I left out the chicken.  This was more of a side dish to go with our main meal.  We really enjoyed it.   I served it cold (I thought it tasted better after a few hours in the fridge than when straight off the stove) and next time I would try peanuts with it instead of almonds.  Very flavorful!

Absolutely excellent! Only suggestion I would make is there is fresh ginger in the produce section at most grocery stores--it is in a paste form and is wonderful to have on hand!

Great! I have made it without the chicken too and is still yummy.  I have also made it with romaine in a pinch and still works well.

I like Debbie's substitution for the onion soup mix.  I left out the pasta and it was delicious and less carbs.  Using a mandolin speeded the preparation.

I made this recipe tonight and thought it was very good.  I followed the recipe exactly as written with the exception of using ground ginger and ground garlic powder because I didn't want little pieces of ginger or garlic in my dressing.  I also used regular sesame oil because I couldn't find toasted sesame oil and I used seasoned rice vinegar because it is what I had on hand.  I also forgot to add the shredded carrots and didn't even miss them.  I mixed everything together with the exception of the carrots (because I forgot them) and the red onions (because my daughter doesn't like them).  My son wouldn't touch this salad but my daughter and I enjoyed it very much.  Next time I will leave out the cucumber, red pepper and mandarin oranges.  I really enjoyed the overall flavor of the salad with the dressing and will make it again just without those items because I don't care for cucumbers and red pepper and the mandarin oranges didn't go well with the flavor of the salad.

Made this salad tonight as written.  It is definitely a keeper!  As others have stated, be sure to use a very large bowl.  The fresh ginger really makes a difference in the dressing.

I am alergic to MSG, so, I switch out the onion soup mix for a miso soup NO MSG, adds the Asian feel, taste and is lower in calories.  I just blend it in my mixer, with a bit more minced ginger and 1/2 tsp minced fresh garlic.  For my spicy friends I add 1 TBS Picante Bufalo Sauce.  It is very good, smoky and yeah, it's hot so go easy. Thanks for this recipe, love it!

Yum!  Made it as written except for excluding the chicken to make it a lighter side dish.  It was a huge hit with my family and friends who were over for dinner.

Presentation 5 stars; healthy light summer meal 5 stars; flavor lacking.  It wasn't bad by any means, but for all the ingredients and colors I expected a power punch of flavor, and it just didn't deliver.  On the other hand, I believe it would have mass appeal for a church supper, pot luck, etc.  If I made this again for my family I'd cut the amount of pasta in half to let the colors and flavor shine thru.

We loved it.... decided to cook chicken breast on stove top and add onions and peppers 1/2 way through cooking.  Tripled the sauce and poured over top with oranges and pineapple tidbits and allowed to simmer for a while as pasta cooked.  Served hot for dinner with spinach salad!  I plan to try it cold next time!  Wonderful!

My husband and I loved it.  It's healthy, has lots of yummy veggies, and the dressing makes for a perfect blend between the sesame oil and the sweet/sour.  As for the kids, the 15yo thought apples would have been better than the mandarin oranges, he said they were bitter.  The 10yo picked all the veggies out (??!!) and then said she wasn't hungry.  So that tells me she liked it.

This is such a great recipe!! Everybody loved it. My father doesn't like cold pasta salads so I made his in a sprite bowl and add the pasta while it was hot and that even turned out great.  We had leftovers and I think it is going to be even better tomorrow. Thank you so much for this recipe!

I cut back a bit on the oil, and didn't add  chicken, to get the fat content down some.       Does take a while to cut up the veggies.  Overall, a pretty good salad.
