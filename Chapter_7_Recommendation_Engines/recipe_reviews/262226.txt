This is so so good! All the steps take the "instant" out of the instant pot but it's worth it! Since there was only one review I was determined to make it exactly according to the recipe but I accidentally made two changes: I forgot to get broccoli at the store and I may have grabbed some ground venison out of my freezer instead of beef. It was still amazing!! I used my immersion blender on the taters after mashing them to make them extra smooth for the picky eaters who like "Hungry Jack" style potatoes. It went over very well with the whole family :) Thanks for the recipe! Love the Instant Pot!

First time using my 3 quart instant pot, so halved all ingredients except for the ground meat. final result was excellent. Following directions for potato preparation brought the dish to an higher level of flavour. I find myself salivating as I think about having leftovers for supper tonight. I would make it again as long as I have an hour from start to finish.
