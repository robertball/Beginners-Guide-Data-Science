Whoa! Vinegar overload! I nearly fell over after tasting this dressing. I should have cut way back on the vinegar at the beginning, to maybe 1 tbsp. I managed to salvage this dip by adding about 3/4 milk and 1/4 sour cream. The vinegar and the worchestire sauce make this dressing very acidic, so I recommend gradually adding those for taste. In the end, it made a nice dressing for my spinach salad.

This is a great creamy salad dressing, not too sweet, not to tangy!
We usually have it on spinach salad, but it is also good on tossed salad.

Excellent dressing!  Not too sweet and not too tart.  But unless you have a large family, I would suggest halving the recipe (I couldn't get through the entire 4 cups before it went off).

I've made this twice now, and end up quadrupling the Worcestershire sauce, omit the honey and add more brown sugar and add LOTS more pepper.  It is still pretty tame for my taste, but my husband and son LOVE it!

Very creamy dressing with unique (unbottled) flavor.  It is slightly sweet, slightly tangy.  I wouldn't change a thing, although next time I will cut the serving size in half because this did make a huge quantity (and there are only two of us).  This tastes great as a dressing on cheeseburgers. Who knew?!

LOVE IT!!  I didn't have any honey but made it anyway.  Honey may have made it too sweet for me because the family and I thought it was PERFECT!  Will definately be making it again and again!!

Surprizingly good. I'll be honest, I didn't expect my family to like this but we really did. I cut the recipe in half and used lowfat mayonnaise and FF sour cream. Really great with a fresh veggie platter.

Eeeeek!  This was too sweet!  And, I am born and bred in the midwest.  I think it would have been good with just the honey.  I had to try to tone it down so I added olive oil, a little more vinegar, more pepper and worchestershire.  I think I will just experiment and make my own next time.

I eat salad every day, so I tend to get bored with the grocery store dressings. This dressing is spectacular! I've made it with buttermilk instead of sour cream, which made it a little thinner. I love it both ways! Not exactly a low cal recipe, but when I have a craving for something sweet, this really hits the spot!

I was a little unsure about this dressing based on the ingredients and still unsure when I sampled some after mixing.  However, when I put it on my tossed salad, I became addicted!

This is a great salad dressing and very easy to prepare. It also makes an awesome dip for veggie platters.

This is a really good dressing that I made in less than 5 minutes. When you serve a salad, it's nice to say you made the dressing as well. They only other thing I'll say is that I cut the recipe in half, which still makes a LOT of dressing.

Thought this recipe might be a bit much. I halved it exactly, except the vinegar , I used 2 tbls. I had family over for dinner and made a Layered Romaine Salad. Everyone loved it, a few went back for seconds. I think this would also work for a coleslaw slaw, or any other tossed salad. I will definitely be making this again.

Only for those with a serious sweet tooth! Cloyingly sweet ... I used the site calculator to cut the recipe in half, thank goodness.

Am in love with all the recipes I get to see in this website, but i have to say this one, it is just not for me, I did it with half of the quantity because we are only two of as currently, and even with half it was way too much mayo too deal with, i ended up adding limon to sort of cut it off a little and that did not work, then I altered the all recipe and still taste the mayo. :(
