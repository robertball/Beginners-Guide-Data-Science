I had a coworker years ago who would make this "cheesecake" for all work functions. I make this myself during summer now, it's a light and fluffy dessert that is also delicious frozen. The amount of confectioners sugar in the "cheesecake" part can be cut back by half and not even be missed. I also add a couple tablespoons of lemon juice to the filling for a little tartness.

It was very good.  Loved it.  My only problem was trying to figure out how many graham crackers to use.  Is that 20 squares or the whole rectangle as it comes in the box.  I think my cracker layer is too thick.  I used 15 rectangles when it looked like it was going to be too much, I quit.

We used to have this when I was younger, I was nostalgic and trying to find a recipe but this one was WAY too sweet.  The graham crackers did not need any sugar...a little butter would have been fine enough.   I’m also not sure the cream cheese needed any extra sugar with the whipped topping mixed in.  One hint, be sure cream cheese is softened to room temp, mix well and then add whipped topping.

I made this for Easter/Birthday celebrations for my family.  I made  one recipe gluten free using S'moreables and did an apple pie filling.  I also made 9 13 pan with cherry and lemon piefillings.  I did alternating stripes and then swirled the two together.  This reminded us of the Charms sweet and sour pops from when we were kids.

I had not eaten this for decades and forgot how to make it. Actually my grandmother and mother used to make it many years ago. This is it!  It tastes the same heavenly way theirs did years ago.  Thank you for sharing!  xx

I added a little lemon juice as suggested. One thing I would recommend is make sure the cream cheese is mixed in really well with the cool whip. I didn’t and I’d get little chunks of solid cream cheese  in a bite :( I will know better next time. Also I used a store bought shortbread crust and it was delicious with this recipe.

I used to always make this for Christmas & Thanksgiving since 1986, when I lived in Oklahoma & until my house burned down in 2011. I found the recipe on the back of the paper that was stuck on top of the Ready Made Graham Cracker pie crust, I forgot now which brand it was. I have always added a teaspoon of vanilla extract to the mix & a teaspoon of almond extract to the cherries.

made this today, OMGOSH!!! DELICIOUS!!! I rated only 4 stars because I made a couple of adjustments. Followed a couple of reviews. 1. store bought crust. 2. light cream cheese and whipped topping. 3. 1/4 cup powdered sugar and 2 Tbls lemon juice for the filling. will definitely make this again!

I omitted sugar in crust and reduced sugar in white mixture to only 1/4 c and it was perfect. My grandmother made this for us and I have always loved it but this recipe uses glucose-spiking quantities of sugar. Just 1/4 cup of sugar is all you need. Trust me and your waist will appreciate you.

I reduced by 1 star since the recipe uses unhealthy quantity of sugar.

It went over really well. It is a little too sweet for my taste. Next time I make it I will use tart pie cherries on top. May cut back on the sugar slightly.

I have made this before and its delicious but the recipe I make from my mother is simpler and lighter and an icebox type cake. I follow package directions and make 2 boxes of instant vanilla pudding (or cheesecake flavor pudding) then I fold in a container of whip cream into mixture. Then I just lay out a layer of graham crackers with layer of mixture on top then crackers and so on till last layer is the mixture, then i pour the large can of cherry pie filling and refrigerate overnight. It takes me 15mins to make and is amazingly delicious!

This recipe was delicious!! I hadn't made this in years, so I was grateful to find a recipe that used what I used to make my cherry elight from years ago. I added vanilla flavor and a teaspoon of lemon juice. My family loved it!
