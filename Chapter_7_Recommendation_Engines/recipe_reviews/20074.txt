Extra cinnamon adds to the flavor. Less lemon juice makes it better.

We think it's a delicious recipe. The taste is right for those who don't like too sweet muffins (and the others can add honey or jam in the middle before eating). I think cookig time is too long: in my oven 40 minutes max are enough, or they burn on top.

The texture of this bread is very good and it's not too sweet. I ended up using vanilla yogurt instead of plain, added walnuts, and instead of cinnamon and nutmeg, I used lemon zest so that it would have an extra lemon-y flavor. Next time I think I will add more yogurt since the consistency of the batter was a bit thick (maybe I added too many dry ingredients) and I will definitely turn the heat down! I baked it at 370 for 36-37 minutes and the top got a bit burnt! Will set it at 350 next time.

Nice taste, easy, and great for those who don't like sweet bread.  However, had I not added pecans, I don't think it would have been as enjoyable.

This bread is a pretty basic quick bread, but the batter is dry, and with the 50 minute bake time it got a bit overdone.  I made mini muffins, mini loaves, and a regular sized loaf.  The mini muffins were done at 15 min, the mini loaves at 25, and apparently the regular loaf probably should've been 30-35 min, not 50.  I used peach yogurt (all I had) and used 3 6 oz containers.  I think I'd add one more egg next time to make the batter a little more runny and/or add some fruit.  It's good, but there's no overall fruity, lemony, or specific flavors.  Thanks for the recipe!

This bread turned out great.  It had good texture a pleasant flavor and was super moist. I topped mine with a good scattering of Uncle Sam Cereal before baking, that was a really nice topping to it.

I've made this several times and it's always been a hit.  I usually use fat-free lemon yogurt in place of the plain yogurt and lemon juice.  However, I found that 50 minutes is WAY too long.  I set my timer for 30 minutes and then start checking every couple minutes after that.  Not too sweet, so it's great to serve with soup.

Bread turned out great. I used only whole wheat flour, two egg whites  and 1 tsp cinnamon, no nutmeg. Just to make it healthier I may try olive oil next time instead. The bread has a nice dense texture. I sliced it to 1/4" like a party bread and then toasted. Definitely add fine chopped nuts and it's not sweet so you can add spreadable cheese or jelly. Will make again!

This was pretty good.  The texture was wonderful, but it was just rather bland, and I had added extra spices.  It was way better after cooling.

I followed the recipe exactly and the bread browned nicely on top (see photo).  But I didn't really like the pumpkin pie like taste so maybe next time I will skip the nutmeg and cinnamon and add lemon extract instead.

Nice quick bread for breakfast, though not my favorite. I found the taste very light and slightly bland, so it definitely needs some jam spread on it. It's a great way to use up leftover yogurt, though, so I would make it again for that reason. Otherwise, I'll stick with the Colonial Brown Bread recipe found on this site.

I used orange juice instead of the lemon. The bread was ready in just 30 minutes at 350F. The flavor of nutmeg was a bit too strong. This bread is mildly sweet with good texture, but I think it's lacking something like dried fruit of nuts.

Very soft and moistalmost fluffy. Worked well as muffins and as bread.  I added mulberries to half of the batter and both plain and berried bread and muffins had very good flavor.

I doubled the batch, and made some signifigant changes:  3 fat free, low sugar fruit yogurts, no butter, lemon juice, or honey, and all whole wheat pastry flour.  The early browning might be due to the honey in the recipe; reduce your oven temp. by 25ยบ.

We made this with blueberries.  They all sank to the bottom but it made a delicious breakfast for nearly a week!  Yummy hot with butter and honey.

I loved this recipe as muffins!  I baked them for 20 minutes.  Next time I would add some blueberries, nuts, or raisins, but they were really great just as is.

I think it came out great - I added a bit of an oatmeal crumble to the top if mine with some added spices - I think next time I will add more spice to the batter as well.

I added 1/2 t. cinnamon instead of 1/4 t. This bread was good, but I have a similar recipe that's healthier (no butter) so I won't be making this again.

I really, really like the taste of this bread. It's just sweet enough. A really great healthy alternative recipe - thanks a lot! 
I modified it by:
   1. making muffins instead of bread
   2.  added 1 extra tbsp of honey
   3. "heaping" portions of the spices
   4. recipe doesn't call for it but I added 1/8th tsp of ground cloves to the dry mixture and 1/2 tsp vanilla to the wet mixture
   5. added 1/4 cup of ground pecans. 
   6. sprinkled a pinch of ground flax seeds and a pinch of white sugar on top.
   7. forgot the egg!!

Of the modifications, I would add the egg in next time and might add a additional egg to try and fluff it up a bit.

The bread did taste quite bland so it depends what you are using it for. If you were to put butter and jam on it then it would probably taste better. However I was making it because I am on the Candida diet - no sugar or yeast, if I do make it again I might try adding some herbs to infuse flavor. The crust around the bread was flavorful so not all was lost, I cut the middle out and used the upper and lower crust for a sandwich.

I made this into mini muffins, and we liked it.  I only used 1/8 cup lemon juice, and added in a couple of heaping Tbsp. of strawberry jam to make up for the rest of the juice. Next time, I will try apricot jam!

Too soft: better texture after a couple of days. Tasteless: adding pecans or nuts makes a big difference (that what I did). Very nice with jam&butter. It actually takes 50 minutes if a bread maker is used.

Once it cooled, this bread was great!  It is unusual.  It has the texture of a quick bread (nice and moist) but a taste more similar to yeast breads.  It is more bland that most quick breads, but has a great subtle taste.  Will most likely make again.  (Mine took only 35 min to bake.)

Excellent. I used all whole wheat and olive oil instead of butter. I also added about 1/2 cup dried fruit, lemon zest and double the nutmeg and cinnamon.

Dee-lish!! l only had 2T of honey, so I had to improvise with corn syrup (yeah, I know...) and since most reviewers said this wasn't very sweet, I also added 2T of white sugar because I did want this to be on the sweet side. As it turned out, still not all that sweet, even with adding the horribly un-healthy ingredients, but just right for what I wanted :)

I'll be serving this with a "spread" of Chef John's Lighter Lemon Curd. It's going to be fantastic!!

I admit that I just used the basic structure for flour to yogurt ratio and made changes so my review is not in the exact recipe. My first change was to sub dark maple syrup for the honey at 4 tblsp instead of 6. I whisked the butter, syrup, yogurt, lemon juice, added lemon zest, and egg (in that order) then let it sit until it started to rise a bit.  I added the dry ingredients omiting nutmeg and adding a touch more cinnamon sifted into the kitchen aid and slowly mixed in the liquid being careful to not overwork. The batter was wonderfully light and aerated. I then folded in almost 2 cups of fresh local blueberries.  Lowered oven temp to 350 and cooking time came in at 45 min because of the blueberry moisture.  The lemon zest adds a depth of brightness and the whole wheat flour keeps it earthy. Excellent morning loaf.

Although I have a sweet tooth I like this bread because it does not call for cups of sugar like some other breads.  It is a nice, basic tasty bread.  Thank you for the healthy recipe!

The texture was good, but the flavor was lacking.  I added another 1/4 t. of cinnamon, but next time would add 1/2 - 1 t. salt also.

Very easy, and healthier on account of the yogurt and honey.  I'll make this again.

Cooks fast... Baked in 30 mts...the crust got burnt. The bread is quite bland and tasteless. Loved the texture though.

Made mine with all whole wheat flour so it was a bit crumbly but very good, and very easy to make!

This bread was extremely easy to make, but be careful not to let it overbrown - it cooks fast!

Didn't have any lemons, so I used lowfat lemon yogurt, and I love it! I sprinkled a little raw sugar on top before baking for a crunchy crust.  Also, I agree with the other reviewer who noted the baking time was closer to 40 minutes.  All in all, hearty and very tasty!!
