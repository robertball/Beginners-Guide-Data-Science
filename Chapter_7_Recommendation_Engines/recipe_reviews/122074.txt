These are DELICIOUS!! They are delicate and lemony, and just a wonderful cookie.
I used a lemon bakery emulsion instead of extract because I like the flavor better, and baked some with the pistachio topping and some with just sugar.  My toddler loved helping me cut them out with tiny cookie cutters.  5 stars all the way!

My mom and I have been making these little gems for a few years now, ever since I got the recipe from Taste of Home's 'Ultimate Cookie Book'. These have become a favortie w/ everyone we've shared them with. LOVE the combo of the pistachio and lemon...it's great for a change as opposed to the usual types of cookies. Lovely recipe and simple too! :)
