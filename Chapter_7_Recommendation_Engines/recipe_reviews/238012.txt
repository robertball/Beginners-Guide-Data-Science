I'm on a low-carb diet and I made this recipe many times, the original as well as with modifications. Don't expect the taste and texture of store-baked, processed, full of sugar and fat muffins. But for what they are (gluten free, low carb) these muffins are amazing.

You can replace honey with stevia. And banana with pumpkin puree or other type of mashed veggie or fruit similar to a banana. I even pureed a zucchini instead of a banana. Next time, I'm gonna try mashed beats. But half a can of pumpkin puree works best, if you need a substitute.

The best taste is making the original recipe as is (banana, 2 spoons of honey). And it's awesome!

My best variation so far: 3 cups of almond flour, 3 eggs, 2 spoons of honey, half a can of pumpkin puree, the rest of the ingredients as listed in the original recipe. Makes about 12 medium muffins.

Used hemp seeds instead of chia or flaxseed.  Used thawed frozen fresh wild Maine blueberries,  but didn't mix them into batter.  Placed them on top of batter in the mini muffin tins,  then covered over with extra batter. (to prevent wicked blue muffins)   Did not use paper liners.  Just lightly greased tin with coconut oil.  They turned out DELISH!  And moist.  Thank you for sharing!!

This is the very best recipe using almond flour.  I doubled the recipe and added a teaspoon of cinnamon. It was perfect and I'll be making it again and again.
 Thanks so much for sharing.

They were very good.  I used frozen blueberries and cooked for about 3-4 minutes longer than recipe called for and they were perfect.  Great alternative to the standard muffin.  Makes 6 regular sized muffins.

In the top 2 best almond flour recipes I’ve had the chance to make. Moist, dense, flavorful from  the banana and berries—it’s just so full of goodness! These have been my pre/post workout snack , my quick grab and go breakfast—these are perfect, easy and quick to make.  i found that letting them bake for about 17 minutes makes it cooked all the way through. Perfection!

I wanted to make something I could conveniently eat for breakfast- especially when I'm in a hurry. These were totally enjoyable and satisfying. I pretty much followed the exact recipe, but had read a couple reviews that they weren't flavorful, so I increased the flax seed to give it more nutty flavor and instead of just blueberries, I used 3/4 of the banana and a cup and 1/2 of a mixture of blueberries, strawberries, boysenberries and kale (kale was in the bag so I just left it for the nutrients).  Instead of 4 muffins, I made 7 level size. That's it- they were moist and flavorful and 2 for breakfast fills me up. I'll make them again the exact same way.

So moist & yummy. I made it with chia & flax seeds & added about a tablespoon of vanilla which wasn't on the receipe. Next time I think I'm going to add cinnamon & nutmeg for a nice little kick.

Not sweet enough for me. Just too bland. And I doubled the honey. Maybe the blueberries and banana wasn’t ripe enough?  I won’t be making these again.

Family Approved!
I also added cinnamon and nutmeg to the dry ingredients and vanilla to the egg/honey mixture.
So Easy and so good.

Followed the recipe to a tee except doubled to make 9 good-sized muffins and put fresh blueberries in some and diary free mini chocolate chips in some. Taste and texture is amazing and so healthy!

I like that these are so healthy and flavorful too! I doubled the recipe. I only had 3 eggs so I added some applesauce and it worked liked a charm. I used dried blueberries and cranberries  bc  that's what was in the pantry. You can add anything really. Guilt free goodness! :)

I made the recipe as-is except 2 tbsp of flax meal vs 1 tbsp flax + 1 tbsp chia, and I used maple syrup vs honey. Baked it for 18 min vs 15 min, to bake all the way through. These are dense and a bit dry, although they’re more moist than I expected them to be. Biggest downside is they have almost no sweetness to them. The blueberries are the sweetest thing, so make sure to include enough.

I baked at 350 for 20 minutes. 

I ran out of almond meal so only had 3/4 cup
Added 1/4 cup coconut flour to make up for difference
I omitted the chia seeds but did use flax seed meal
Added 1/4 cup apple sauce
added EnjoyLife chocolate chips
Used a whole banana

Moist+delicious I think because applesauce gave it more fluff.

I doubled the entire recipe other than the fruit in order to make a full pan of muffins. Based on other reviews, I added a splash of vanilla (probably about 1 tsp) and I lightly sprinkled brown sugar on top to create a sweet crust. This made all the difference to the flavor. I also added chopped pecans for a crunch and a bit more protein. Thanks for a great recipe!

I won't be making these again. I followed recipe exactly but did not include the flax seed and they are sooo bitter. My bananas were over ripe so I thought this would be a good way to use one. Nope! It needs something more than banana and honey to cover the taste of almond.

I love this recipe, the muffins are moist and loaded with blueberries. Followed suggestion to add cinnamon, it came out great! Also as someone suggested, put the blueberries in after spooning some batter first. The blueberries stay whole and burst when you bite. Yum!

Excellent basic muffin recipe. Very moist, rich and tasty.  I made it as written, except I doubled it and used stevia/erythritol instead of honey. I used large fresh blueberries and lightly smushed them. I used muffin papers and sprayed them with baking spray, which was good because they wanted to stick. The doubled recipe yielded 12 "regular" sized muffins.

Made it twice- first time only lacking flax and second time adding raspberries, vanilla and a dash of cinnamon and one packet Stevia. I think a ripe banana is the key to sweetness. I did Double recipe second time and still great.. No junk and so good. My kids loved them and asked for more.

I have made this twice in two days. My daughters didn't like the "chunks" of blueberries, so the second time I used a little less and pureed them first.  I think that made things a little too liquidy.  Next time if I puree, I need to add some more almond flour.  Since it's fall I want to try to change out the blueberries for pumpkin.

This is an excellent recipe made as states without the flax or chia seed only because I didn't have any. I can't wait to try different fruit! Everyone in the house enjoyed them. Thank you for a gluten free tasty food!

Made these and they were fantastic! I doubled the recipe to make 12 muffins. I used 2 very ripe bananas. Used 2 tsp hemp seeds. Used black strap molasses instead of honey. Baked 20 minutes. Baked beautifully and family loved them.

These were so easy and delicious! I made both a regular and an egg-free version. I used almond flour, not meal (Honeyville), used frozen (rinsed) blueberries, and added a little extra honey and cinnamon. I used 1/2 the suggested amount of banana (what I had on hand). They took much longer to cook than the suggested 15 minutes,  but when they were nicely browned on top, they were cooked through, and tasted delicious! A double recipe of the egg version made 9 huge muffins. Definitely will make these again!

Tasty! I made a few changes: doubled the recipe, substituted 1/2 cup almond flour with Arbonne vegan protein boost, added an extra 1/2 banana and 1/2 cup of applesauce. I love that these are low glycemic, high protein and no added oil.

Made a handful of changes including doubling the recipe and adding 2 T extra honey, 1/2 C GF oat flour, 1/4 C avocado oil and 1/4 C hemp seeds and maybe a little extra fresh blueberries    Baked for 20 minutes @ 350'.   My kids will love these!

I tweaked the recipe a bit to be able to make some breakfast muffins that I could freeze and heat up for busy mornings.  My tweak also defeats the purpose of gluten free but you could probably just double the almond flour.  I basically doubled the recipe with these exceptions 1. I added 1/4 c hemp protein powder by the same producer of the almond flour.  I added 3/4 cup whole wheat unbleached flour.  2. I used 3 eggs and 1 tablespoon of olive oil.  (Ran out of eggs) 3. I used crasins, raisins and dried blueberries to a total of 3/4c instead of fresh blue berries.  4: Lastly I topped each of the 12 muffins with crushed walnuts.  I was purposely trying to increase protein and create a calorie dense muffin that would give me all the energy I needed without making me feel stuffed.  It was delicious.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

One of the better gluten free recipes I've tried! I added more bananas. Nice and moist and not gritty.

Doubled recipe with 2 bananas and less blueberries.  Fills regular dozen muffin tin nicely. Great GF option.

Didn't change a thing. Wouldn't make again, just lacks flavor.

Substituted coconut flour for almond meal.  Added olive oil to compensate for dry ingredients. Still too dry.  Will cut coconut flour in half next time.

Made this - followed vegan recipe to the T, they turned out very wet and sloppy. Would recommend extending the cooking time even if they "turn brown" as it says. Tasted them anyway. Taste is good.
