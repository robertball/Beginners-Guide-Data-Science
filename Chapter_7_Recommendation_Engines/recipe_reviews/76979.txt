This makes a really yummy lunch that's healthy and filling. I followed the recipe to a tee, except I omitted the mint. The honey roasted peanuts are a must in this - they were great!

I enjoyed this salad- quick, simple, tasty & healthy. As a personal preference I replaced the peanuts with toasted cashews- toasting the nuts is a must, or the flavour is lost. I loved how low-calorie the dressing is, but I found the fresh mint and cilantro quite over-powering when left in the dressing. I recommend straining out the herbs after allowing the flavours to mingle. I also added chopped sugar snap peas and baby spinach to add variety to the veggies.

I made this the first time, and we couldn't even eat it.  I made it again thinking perhaps I didn't use the correct quantities, with the same result.  I love Thai food and have eaten and enjoyed many dishes containing fish sauce, but the flavor and aroma of the sauce totally overpowered the other ingredients.

Loved this salad. My husband who is vietnamese was at first a bit skeptical because I don't make asian food very well (still learning). But as soon as he took a bite he inhaled it. He wanted more. So this recipe is a definite keeper. Its very easy to make and I like the idea of not having to cook (which is great when your having a busy day).

Very good.  I used mixed salad greens and added tomatoes to the salad.  Even better the next day.

I thought this recipe was very good. I could not find any fresh ginger that day so I had to use ground. To me, there was too much of a ginger taste, but the rest of my family loved it. I will try it again with the fresh instead and let you know...

was very good. halved the amt. of fish sauce per readers' suggestions, added a bit of zest from the lemon as well which gave it a pop of flavor, toasted some sesame seeds, added a few dashes of sesame oil, and dried orange cranberries for color.  loved the addition of the mint; and I forgot the sugar, after I added it I could tell the difference so don't omit. change of pace from the ordinary. best surprise was the next day, I added a bit of mayo to make a sandwich and it was yummy! nice pleasant surprise. thanks for the recipe.

Good flavors although the ginger was too strong for me.  Had to add more lime juice and fish sauce to balance it out and give it more of a Thai flavor.  Couldn't taste the sweet and salty, only the ginger.  Used rotisserie chicken and doubled the juice. Will make again though.

This was just ok.  Even with a rotisserie chicken, it wouldn't call this a quick weeknight meal.  By the time you shred all the chicken and chop the herbs, grate carrots, wash lettuce and slice cucumbers, the end result isn't work the work.

I love this quick and tasty meal. Try this instead of a fast food busy day dinner. You can make it faster than waiting at a drive thru.

I really like this author and highly recommend her cook books!! This recipe lacked a little something in the dressing but it would be worth playing around with.

I agree with GolferGirl.  I love Thai food, and I have made quite a few recipes from this website with fish sauce with great results.  I thought the fish sauce was too overwhelming in this dish.  I couldn't eat more than a bite.  My husband thought it was ok, but he threw the leftovers out because he didn't like it enough to have it the next day.

So good I am writing my first review ever! Loved the favor and texture combination and cannot beat the CONVENIENCE! A big hit-not to mention better nutrition than what my teens usually eat-  Will definitely make again.

I really didn't care for the dressing at all. The fish sauce was way overpowering for myself and I even tried adjusting the ingredients to make it less. It's really funny because I actually love fish sauce in everything else I make.

Just like Thai style, after it was doctored. These Larb salads are meant to be VERY spicy. I doubled the sauce ingredients and tripled the heat. My husband, who has lived in Thai landed for several years, gave it approval for authenticity and he's very picky.

Tasty & easy.  I replaced 1 tablespoon water in the dressing with 1 T. chili oil (instead of using red pepper flakes), romaine instead of butter lettuce, carrots cut in matchsticks rather than shredded, no mint but double cilantro, and leftover grilled breast - very good even with all the changes.
