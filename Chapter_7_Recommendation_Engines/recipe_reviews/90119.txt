This recipe is OUTSTANDING!  I make minor changes to it and it comes out delicious everytime.  I use one 15oz can of diced tomatoes (w/Basil,Oregano,Garlic flavoring) in place of the Roma tomatoes, I use Romano cheese in place of the Parmesan and I use a total of 1/4 cup of oil instead of the 1/2 cup.  I love it with the turkey sausage but have also made it with grilled chicken.   This is now my favorite recipe!!!!

This is a great recipe and is easy to tweak according to your likes/dislikes.  I also use one can of diced tomatoes (if I don't have any fresh) and I don't add green pepper.  I also don't add as much parmesan cheese as it calls for.  I've used the farfelle pasta but my favorite to use with it is campanelle.  This recipe is a favorite of my husbands.  And mine!

We have a new favorite! If youre looking for a sauage/pasta dish that isn't all smothered in tomato sauce, then this is for you! The boullion and tomatoes make such a light refreshing sauce that really brings out the other flavors! For best results, I wouldn't advise subbing dried basil for fresh, (flavor goes down to 3-4 stars w/dried). Great presentation/colors, too. Perfect for company! Thanks!!!

What a wonderful dish! I presented it in a cooking class at church and received rave reviews. This recipe makes 7 cups and freezes well for the next go 'round. My modifications: bulk turkey Italian sausage, canned diced tomatoes with basil & garlic, zucchini and summer squash, broccoli, cauliflower & carrot mix, can of mushroom pieces, 1/4 c olive oil, green & red bell peppers and an Italian cheese blend w/ Parmesan, Asiago, Mozzarella and Provolone. This dish was 'tha bomb'!!

I made this recipe scaled down to 4.  I took the sausage out of the casing before cooking it, added a small amount of Maderia wine, 1 small diced jalapeno pepper, and about 10 fennel seeds.  My husband liked it which is a true test.  I definately will make it again.

We loved this.  I kind of doubled it, used 2 lbs of penne, and 2 lbs of hot turkey sausage, because my husband has a tendancy to pick out the good stuff from the leftovers.  Also, didn't have any fresh tomatoes on hand, so used 3 14 oz can of diced romas.  Waiting for those garden tomatoes to ripen; and then look out!!! This is going to taste even better.  Used fresh yellow squash and whole basil leaves straight out of the garden, and even with the canned tomotoes, was absolutely delicious.  Can't wait to make it again with the garden tomatoes.

This was delicious, with just the right amount of spiciness. I was a little skeptical about the addition of bouillon granules, but they blended in nicely and really enhanced the flavor. I followed the recipe exactly, although it's one of those that could be tweaked to one's tastes. I might try a variation on it using some different or additional vegetables or, perhaps,chicken instead of sausage. Having said that, both my husband and I loved it as is. Thanks for the recipe. I'll definitely be making it again!

This recipe surprised me with how tasty it was. I was just looking for a way to use up the squash from my garden! I had to use canned tomatoes since my garden is only offering green maters right now. I also left out the green pepper since I don't like it. I used much less olive oil and instead used the juice from the canned tomatoes when I needed more liquid. I can't have cheese right now (and how I love fresh parmesan!), but I don't think the dish suffered at all without it. Don't worry, I got my fat grams by using full-on hot Italian PORK sausage. I highly recommend using fresh basil. Fabulous taste and easy to make with a nice zing - a keeper!

I served this to 6 adults and 2 children.  Even after doubling the recipe, there was not a bite left.  I used half as much pasta as called for, all zucchini (no yellow squash), and hot Italian sausage instead of turkey.  Now I wish those zucchini would keep producing a little longer.

This recipe was OK.  It was very fresh tasting - a good summer meal.  It did not have enough flavor for my family.  If I make it again, I will try adding extra seasonings...

I made this as a side dish and omitted the sausage. It was wonderful. My brother loved it and he is not a fan of vegetables.

My hubby made this for company. You know it's a crowd pleaser when your guests go back for seconds. It was a little too spicy for me, so when we make this again I will use less red pepper.

I made this as written with the exception of the tomatoes.  I used a can of tomatoes with oregano, basil and garlic.  This dish is very tasty and easy to make on the stove top.  I will def. be making this again!

This was really tasty and I will definitely make it again! I used Italian chicken sausage because the store didn't have any turkey. I also added some fresh spinach (just added it with the fresh basil leaves) and some toasted pine nuts (really added great flavor)! I used a 15 oz can of Italian style diced tomatoes too. This was my first time cooking with sausage, and I am thankful for the reviewer who recommended removing the coating! Great meal!

My family loved this dish. We had only a little bit leftover and that was gone the next day. An extra plus is that it reheats well. I did end up changing a few things to accomodate what I had on hand. I used broccoli, green pepper, and snap peas. Also used canned diced tomatoes. Think next time I make it, I might add some tomato sauce to it. Can't wait to make it again!! :)---UPDATE: I've made this twice since then, each time I've needed to use different veggies and wow! each time is better!! I went ahead and added tomato sauce, and I absolutely love it! My entire family loves this recipe! Thanks

I used chicken sausage, 1 (14.5 oz.) can of diced tomatoes and about 1/2 a tablespoon dried basil.  I can not wait to try this with fresh everything.  It was really good with my little changes... I am sure it will be fantastic with all fresh ingredients.

This dish wins on 3 ways: simple, quick, and GREAT tasting.  I only cook meals now and then, but this was still very easy to make with great ingredients and seasoning.  I served it hot.  I substituted out the turkey sausage for tender chicken breasts marinated in italian dressing, which went perfectly with it.  I also used only 2/3 of the pasta - which was plenty.  This fed 4 adults easily, served along with Italian rosemary bread and Shiraz.

We really liked this dish.  Followed the directions exactly...except for a few slight modifications - cut up veggies in small chunks, used a red bell pepper instead of green, had to use sweet turkey sausage (with casings removed) since store was out of "hot" turkey sausage & we added an extra 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes to make up for sweet sausage. Not spicy at all. Very good.

This was really good.  It has a light fresh taste and is so pretty to serve.  The only change I made was to use regular hot italian sausage instead of the turkey (mostly because I couldn't find any turkey sausage).  I made this for my guy, who never eats vegetables and he had three plates full!!!!  Note, this makes a lot so cut in half or you get to eat it for days...which isn't bad either, because the flavor gets better and better.  Thanks for this one, it's a keeper.

This was really good. I did change a few things. Used sun dried tomatoes instead of cherry. Omitted green pepper, used 1/4 cup oil (as suggested) and upped the red pepper flakes to about 2 tablespoons. I also used turkey kilbasa instead of italian sausage.  Very easy and quick!!

A delicious, light, and very fresh meal you can feel good about eating.  Perfect balance for meat and veggie eaters alike. Reminds me of a summer take on the italian sausage soup recipe from this site. Used canned diced tomatoes and lots of Italian Seasoning.

I did not expect this to come out as good as it did...with so many little ingredients and the level of ease this recipe requires. but i was surprised and ended up loving it. it was a hot day and i was lookign for a light pasta dish, i also used campanelle because its so pretty and diced tomatoes. great way to get your veggies in!! also i used chicken, since i dont eat pork.

Great recipe!  I didn't have sausage on hand so I used diced chicken breasts that I sauteed with the garlic and onion- then added red bell pepper strips and used a bag of frozen california blend veggies instead fresh sicne I was pressed for time.  The family enjoyed it very much!  The addition of the boullion cubes was right on- gave the flavor extra depth.  I will be making this again, thanks!

I LOVED this recipe! I made a few tweaks but nothing major. I used hot Italian pork sausage instead of turkey and added some chicken, as well. I also added a little bit (less than 1/4 cup) of half and half to create some creaminess and some Italian seasoning to round it all out. It turned out fantastic!

Very healthy and tasty dish.  I used whole wheat penne pasta, less oil, and only 1/4 tsp. of bullion to keep it even healthier.  I also used a can of roasted tomatoes instead of plum, and i only used two tsp. of fresh basil.  The whole family liked.  Will make again for sure.

This made a ton (served 2 of us, had daughter & son-in-law for leftovers and they took leftovers home to our grandsons). The men in family don't have small appetites either. Everyone thought it was great.  Didn't have fresh tomatoes but used 2 cans diced with juice. Used part red, yellow & green peppers, mushrooms, red wine & some half & half to make enough liquid. Didn't use bouillon. Added parmesan at table.

My bf will not eat many veggies, so I omitted the squash, zuchhini, and tomatoes. I really liked this pasta dish, it was very light and tasty (for me it was 4.5 stars, for him 3.5-he likes a heavier sauce).  My only complaint is that I wish it had a little more flavor so next time I will add more seasoning and probably add all the veggies...he can pick em out ;)

Had a big group and they ALL loved it and wanted the recipe.  I used regular italian turkey sausage, red pepper, canned tomatoes, and extra cheese.  I also didnt have any fresh basil so I used dried basil.  Turned out great, even better the next day, makes a lot too.

Loved it.  I'm not a fan of hot sausage so the sweet sausage was better.  The oil is needed to get up the bits left from cooking the sausage.  Adds extra flavor.  I did use the canned diced tomatoes as other suggested and they worked very well.  I'll definately make this again.

It's a good light pasta.  It's still lacking a bit of flavor.

This was wonderful! I changed it up a little bit. I made it vegetarian and did not use the sausage. I also used crumbled feta cheese instead of grated parmesian. I also used a red bell pepper instead of a green bell pepper.  Delicious!

Pretty good. Instead of Roma tomatoes, I added two cans of diced tomatoes with Italian seasonings. Also, added a little red wine, red pepper slices and ground cayenne. The leftovers look pretty good today and I plan to have for lunch.

Loved this easy weeknight recipe!  I sauteed the turkey sausage until about half cooked, then just added all of the veg and garlic into the same large saute pan.  I used a 14 oz can fire-roasted tomatoes instead of the romas, and added about 2/3 cup caldo de tomate con pollo broth to help soften the veg and soak up the pasta.  I just added about 8 oz tri-color rotini, I like more meat/veg and a little less pasta ratio.  All of that fresh basil makes this dish.  Oh, that and fresh shaved parm on top.  Thank you for a versitile recipe, a keeper for sure!

This is quite tasty and pretty spicy, just how I like it. The recipe says it will be ready in 50 minutes; took me twice as long. Cutting uncooked sausage into 1/2 inch slices is a pain in the neck. It would have made more sense had the recipe suggested cooking the sausage first. The idea that all the ingredients could fit in a large skillet is absurd. They barely fit in a large pot. With whole wheat pasta, it is VERY filling.

I loved this pasta recipe. I couldn't find Italian turkey sausage so i bought reduced fat italian pork sausage which was tasty. I used about 10 leaves of fresh basil instead of 20 because it seemed to be too muich as i was trying it. Additionally, I added skim milk and light cream cheese to make a bit more of a sauce and seasoned with italian seasoning spice, salt, pepper, garlic powder and half a jalepeno. I used everything else in the recipe as stated. I made it with garlic bread and my boyfreind and i really enjoyed it. :) Will make again.

This dish is one of my favorite summer meals! I do make a few changes. Instead of the second 1/4 cup of oil I use a 1/4 of dry white wine, and right before I add the noodles I add about 1/3 a cup of heavy cream to make it just a little creamier. I also use spicy Italian sausage that I grill before adding!

This dish was a huge hit!  My husband came home for lunch just so he could eat the leftovers.  I did not put the green pepper in it because I did not have one(forgot to get it) and I don't think I will next time I make it--it was perfect.  Also, I used Sweet Turkey Brats instead of sausage.

My family loves this dish although I made one or two changes.  I put garlic in everything so I had to add garlic to this.  I also usually use a can of diced tomatoes with the juice drained off.  The only other change was to use Rainbow pasta, because it makes it so colorful.  This is one dish that my son doesn't mind eating his vegtables.

I am an avid marathon runner and use this recipe as a foundation for my carbo-loading dish before each long run.  It is extremely versatile and the flavor is wonderful every time.  Last night, I used the veggies, spices, and tomatoes (diced in a can) plus some asparagus and chicken instead of Italian sausage to make risotto in preparation for my 20 mile run today.  (I am eating leftovers right now.)  It's simple, but delicious.  Thanks so much for sharing!

My husband said this was better than any restraunt pasta dish he has ever had.  I even reduced the olive oil by more than half and it turned out perfect.  The sausage gives it a great flavor....I did however use the sweet Italian turkey sausage because I could not find spicy

So tasty!  This recipe will definitely be cooked more often.  My boyfriend loved it as well!  The Italian turkey sausage was absolutely delicious.  I was snacking on it while the veggies were cooking up.  I followed other people's suggestions and added a can of diced tomatoes with basil, oregano, and garlic flavoring, less olive oil, a mix of parmesan and romano grated cheese and a pack of mushrooms.

This had a really nice flavor and made a ton! I won't have to cook for a couple of days - nice surprise. Next time, I think I'll double the garlic. I was tempted to but held off. I couldn't taste it, though, and I think the garlic flavor would be great. I'll go ahead and give it 5 stars, presuming I'll add the extra garlic next time.

Wonderful!  I took the advice from another reviewer and used a 15-oz. can of diced tomatoes with onions and garlic instead of fresh ones - would do that again.  I also cut way down on the olive oil to reduce the fat - used only 1/8 cup total, and it was plenty.  I omitted the red pepper flakes and was glad I did - using hot sausage was plenty spicy.  I also threw in 1/4 cup of red wine - made it smell so good.  Don't forget to remove the casings from the sausage before cooking!  Thanks for the recipe - this one's a keeper!

This is a great recipe! I used turkey sausage the first time I made it and it wasn't that good so I use beef/pork sausage now. I substituted a pablano pepper instead of the bell pepper, added lots of extra squash since it's one of my favorite vegetables, and used whole wheat organic penne pasta. With the whole wheat pasta, this really is a very healthy dish as well as tasty!

Very good.  I haven't found a turkey sausage that I like so I used Italian venison sausage.  I substituted cheese tortilini and used canned diced tomatoes instead of fresh.  I also took another reviewers suggestion and used Feta instead of parmesian.  Next time I will make it with some type of plain pasta.  I like rich but tortilini was a little over the top.

Wasn't sure how good this would be but made it and was definitely not disappointed. Close your eyes and you'll think you were in a fine restaurant! Very good tasting... leftovers were just as good. Turkey sausage is sooo much better than the fatty version. No loss of flavor and so much better for you.

This was terrific! I have to confess I didn't use turkey sausage though, just regular Italian. Beware: this makes a LOT. I was in a hurry or I would have have scaled it down. It's okay though because my husband will take some for lunch and share it, plus have enough for two more dinners, probably. Wonder how well it freezes? Will definitely add this to the menu.

I made this tonight and it turned out great.  I love that it was filled with fresh veggies, and low-fat meat but it was so tasty.  I didn't do any altering to this recipe except for top it with more parmesan cheese upon serving.  A great meal!!!

This was delicious!! I followed the recipe exactly, except I only used 1 zucchini and 1 squash. The turkey sausage adds so much flavor! I had the taste in my mouth all the next day lol I couldn't wait for leftovers :) Sooo good! This has become one of our favorites!

Great taste.  I didn't have zucchini or squash but everything else was the same.  I used Eckrich smoked turkey sausage. The dish was too spicy for my 7 year old.  My husband and I thought it was perfect.   A keeper but will have to modify when making for kids.

Very good dish, I cut the recipe down to 4 servings, but added a little more veggies and used chicken sausage instead of turkey.  I also diced a Jalapeno pepper in the mix.  Excellent!!!

Delicious!  Used fresh ingredients from the garden.  Great flavor and easy to make.  I used didn't use any olive oil.....I found there to be enough sausage drippings to saute all the vegetables.  Will definitely make this again!  Loved it!

pretty good! I added mushrooms and left out the green pepper. We really enjoyed it, although I added a little spaghetti sauce just because it was a bit dry and I like things a little saucy.

I found this recipe when looking for something to do with some baby zucchini.  I love anything pasta!  I used two spicy Italian chicken sausages which I cooked and then ran through a food processor to grind up like hamburger.  I also used a can of plain petite diced tomatoes instead of the fresh.  Very tasty!

Brought this to a family gathering and everyone loved it!  Made a few changes: Instead of the chicken bouillon I put in a thing of concentrated chicken stock, left out the basil, and used a can of diced tomatoes w/basil instead of roma tomatoes.  I prepped everything in advance (all the chopping and even cooked the sausage) and then it was fast and easy to make once I was there.  Everyone asked for the recipe!

Very flavorful and versatile. You can substitute or add pretty much any veggie you want, or even swap out the protein. I substituted tortellini for the farfalle since that's what I had on hand. The addition of the bouillon helped balance out the tomato sauce--I think it's the key to this dish. I didn't add quite the amount of oil called for since there was a fair amount of fat rendered from the sausage.

This is a family favorite! I made small adjustments as follows: I used mild Italian sausage instead of hot. This was a bonus for my kids. I love garlic so I added 2 more cloves. I add the tomatoes and fresh basil last so they don't get too limp and soggy. I've never added the Parmesan cheese. This pasta dish makes an excellent leftover meal, as well as a cold salad. I've made it not only for my immediate family but for friends as well and it's always a big hit. Love, love, love it!

Very good!  I didn't have chicken bouillon, so I subbed a cup of chicken broth.  I also subbed the fresh tomatoes with a can of italian-style stewed tomatoes.  The red pepper flakes made it too spicy for my kids so I will have to leave it out next time but it was a very tasty meal.

I love this recipe! Because I'm making it in the winter and yellow squash is scarce in the grocery stores, I subbed in sweet potato. It worked out perfectly! The only thing I didn't like was the fact that it didn't keep me full for long but that goes with being 90% vegetable.

This was incredible! Seriously awesome.  I have tried so many pasta recipes trying to find one that was healthy and delicious and I finally did it!  I used Honeysuckle Turkey Sausage-Sweet Italian, 1 can of fire roasted tomatoes instead of the Roma, and red bell pepper since it's what I had on hand.  I also only used 1 each zucchini and squash and it made a hearty meal for 5-6 people.  OH...I left out the bouillon too because I didn't have any.  I can't imagine needing anything to this dish.  well done.

We changed it up a bit - used baked chicken breast, whole wheat spaghetti, a cube and half of bouillon, 5 cloves of garlic, quartered cherry tomatoes, 4 farm fresh summer squash, and a yellow bell pepper - all just what we had on hand.  It was absolutely delicious.  Garnished with extra parmesan cheese.  Could use a bit more red pepper if kids are not eating.

My husband and I both loved this...  I'm vegetarian so we cooked the sausage and set it to the side for just his portion.  I used 15 oz can of diced tomatoes (with basil, oregano, garlic), omitted the fresh basil and only used enough olive oil to sautee the vegetables.

Both my fiance and myself really enjoyed this recipe.  I made some minor changes but I'm sure the recipe would be just as good as written.  Since I was cooking for two, I decreased the amount of ingredients.  I used 2 hot italian sausages, casings removed.  Crumbled the sausage while browning it in a saucepan and then set aside.  I added a little more evoo to the pan with the sausage grease and added 4 cloves of garlic and 1 small chopped white onion, then added 1 chopped zucchini, 1 yellow squash, 2 large chopped tomatos, 1 red pepper, and a handful of chopped fresh basil.  I also added some basic spices, salt, pepper and red pepper flakes.  After a few minutes I added a cup of chicken broth and about 1/2 cup white wine and let simmer for about 10-15 minutes.  Added some parmesan at the end and mixed in 1/2 pound penne pasta.  Will make this again and again!

This is a very good dish.    I made it almost exactly except I used several colors of peppers and that made it look so pretty.    I don't care for bouillon because it has so much sodium, but used natural chicken bouillon.  It is definitely going to be one of our favorites.

WOW!!!  This was so good!  Thanks to my Papa I am now starting to get garden fresh vegetables and was looking for a recipe to use them in.  I did not change a thing from the recipe and was blown away.  This tasted so fresh and I enjoyed making it as much as I enjoyed eating it.  Can't wait to share the recipe with the rest of my family as I won't be sharing the leftovers.  Again...YUM!!! :)

Easy, very tasty and you feel like you've made a good, healthy meal. I followed the directions but added some white wine to the sauteed veggies. It created a yummy sauce.

A first rate dish that allows for plenty of personal modification. A nice way to break the habit of "spaghetti sauce" every time you find yourself looking at a box of pasta and a package of italian sausage.

I've made this several times now and we just love it! I use ground Italian Turkey Sausage and canned tomatoes. We love garlic so I added some extra. This is simple,quick meal that gives you big taste. Thanks for the recipe.

very good.  my roma tomatoes weren't quite ripe, so to add a bit of moisture I added 1/4c chicken broth instead of the granules - worked perfectly!

This is wonderful and easy!!  It does make alot though!  I decrease the oil - use just a couple of teaspoons.  I use 1/2 regular and 1/2 hot turkey Italian sausage but remove it from the casing and crumble as it cooks.  I like it with the red bpepper, use Italian diced tomatoes instead of fresh and add about 1 cup of chicken broth in the final 5 minutes to make it a little saucy...also - add a bit more cheese and extra FRESH basil!  Even better the next day.

This is a great recipe to have for when the abundance of the garden comes quickly. I did make some changes. I had kielbasa, so that is what I used. I also omitted the zucchini (none in the garden) and used regular tomatoes. I think that this could easily be modified to what veggies you have on hand.

Oh, this was super good! I'm not a big turkey sausage fan so it was nice to find a recipe with lots of veggies to acomedate the greasy sausage and still leave you feeling full and satisfied.

This turned out great.  I threw in whatever veggies I had - yellow squash, zuch., mushrooms, red onion, and alot of garlic. I left out the tomatoes and added white wine.  It's a great recipe to play with - thanks!

This is a GREAT recipe!  Okay, actually, I didn't try this one because I changed it so much, but I know from my results this would have been awesome too!  My grocer didn't have basil that looked good, so I used a jar of imported basil pesto instead.  I used canned diced tomatoes, drained since we have a salmonella issue with tomatoes right now.  I also used sweet Italian sausage instead of hot and cut out the red pepper flakes so my 6 yr old could eat it.  Next time, I will probably use less olive oil - but then I did use it while sauteing the veggies and added it all to the pasta with pesto (which already has quite a bit of olive oil).  This recipe is versatile and would work with various combinations of veggies and types of pasta.  Thanks for the idea!  (Hey, at least I didn't give it a low rating based on MY changes!  :)

I thought this recipe was great!  Like other users, I reccommend using a 15 oz can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh ones.  The juice from the tomatoes creat a very nice base sauce for the pasta so you don't have to add any extra oil.

This was so delicious and flavorful!   The only modifications I made were to use whole wheat pasta and to use Morningstar Farms Italian Sausage crumbles in place of the turkey sausage (we're not big "real" sausage fans).  I'm really thrilled that this dish was not only delicious but also very healthy.  Highly recommend.

The whole family liked this.  Next time I will experiment with an alternative to the chicken boullion, which is mostly msg and sometimes gives me a headache.  I'm thinking to try chicken stock for the flavor and for a little more liquid to melt the cheese into.  It could use just a little more sauciness, but the flavor was great and it works with all different veggies (I used broccoli, green beans, and red peppers this time).  I also added a little milk as another reviewer suggested.  I wasn't too sure about this at first and tried it with a little in a separate bowl, but it helped make a little more sauce without affecting the flavor much.

Awe-SOME.  The only changes I made were that I used whole wheat farfalle, and onion powder instead of real diced onion.  This dish is a colorful combination of veggies that work well with the pasta, sausage, and seasonings.  My only complaint is the amount of prep: chopping veggies, multiple steps of mixing together ingredients, etc - but I have a chronic illness and I work, so I get tired really easily.  I doubt this would be a problem for most others.

Excellent.  I used spiral pasta and regular italian sausage, but didn't make any other revisions to the recipe.  Maybe a bit of salt and pepper next time...

Just finished eating this a few minutes ago- used turkey breakfast sausage, basil olive oil, a parmesan/asiago/romano mix, added a red bell pepper, and chopped up more basil for topping. I cook for three picky vegetable haters- they loved the flavor, and it was *all* gone in about twenty minutes. This is definitely a keeper!

Pretty tasty. We used soy turkey sausage so it probably lost a bit of the flavor but it was still really good. We also used about 1 1/4 c parmesan. This pasta is also yummy cold.

Sure, I didn't follow the recipe... but it was still excellent.  I used a can of diced tomatoes with basil and oregano in place of the fresh tomatoes and omitted the basil.  I also left out most of the oil, using only a tablespoon or so to cook the onion and garlic mix.  Overall, it was very good.

This recipe is very good.  I will say it's a little different- as another reviewer said- it's light, but it has a lot of flavor.  It was a TOUCH spicy for me, but that's a matter of personal taste.  I might skip the red pepper flakes next time.  This is a great recipe!

Fantastic!  I improvised and used hot italian sausage and omitted the tomatoes, but otherwise followed it to a "t".  This was a fantastic dish that I served to an entire dinner party.  It met to rave reviews!  Spicy but not hot, flavorful but not too heavy - wonderful dish!

Really delicious!!  I used a chicken chipolte pepper sausage so I left out the red pepper flakes and added the parmesan on top of the serving instead of mixing it all in. I too used a can of diced petite tomatoes instead of chopping. I also added a lot more squash because you can never have too many veggies! This is a wonderful one dish supper. I'll make it again.

Followed the recipe. EXCEPT I could not find fresh basil at our store. I loved it! I will use this recipe again. It's very light. And not too spicy. Just enough to give it a kick.

This was pretty good.....full of flavor and fairly east to make.  I did not have any turkey sausage, so I use sweet italian, and it worked out beautifully.  I reduced the entire recipe to serve 4, and it can't wait to have the left overs.  A keeper that will be done again.

This is a fantasic, flavorful dish. My husband absolutely loves it! The only change I had to make was I found only sweet sausage rather than hot at the grocery store. It still was great! The serving size is very generous so we get more than one meal out of it and also lunches.

I loved this recipe.  It was perfect no changes needed. I loved the sausage it gave the dish the perfect kick. So easy to make even my father loved it and he is not a big vege or pasta fan.

This was simple and delicious. I used regular pork Italian sausage and left out the green pepper. I also added some extra cheese. This is a really good "company recipe". Looks pretty and tastes great!

I loved this, even after being overly concerned that the tomatoes would get cooked down too much.  The sauce was perfect and light.  The only thing I would change next time is either use sweet italian chicken sausage or leave out the crushed red pepper.  I found the heat a tad overpowering from the hot sausage and the red pepper together.

This recipe has become a part of the rotation.  My husband doesn't care for squash so I have used asparagus or broccoli, it always turns out great.  We love it.

Really good. I had a yellow pepper on hand and probably used less oil since I just "eyeballed" the pour. I think you could use other veggies too...like fresh green beans or carrots. Next time I will use less pasta for more sauciness but this is definately good, easy comfort food! Thanks!

Absolutely delicious!  I added some shitake mushrooms sauteed in cooking sherry.  I also used Jennie O turkey breakfast sausage for the meat. Three friends have requested the recipe and I just made it last week.

I used a lot less olive oil to cut back on calories, and added just a bit of the pasta cooking water (though I liked one reviewer's idea of Madiera wine better!). Overall, very good and easy!

What a yummy healthy dish!  I used whole wheat rotini and Italian pork sausage (can't find turkey) but less of it, and dried basil, otherwise followed exactly.  Oh and I felt it needed salt, but I generally salt everything.  This makes quite a lot and is incredibly good - we'll be having it again soon!

I just made it tonight..I thought it tasted really good and i don't usually like a lot of cooked vegetables all mixed in together...i followed it exactly except made with whole grain penne pasta(12oz box which was still plenty) and added 8 oz of sliced mushrooms...my boyfriend ate 2 helpings, he really liked it...he said it tasted like goulash...but it didn't have the red sauce..he's diabetic and i was trying to make something good...SCORE!!!..plenty of leftovers(its only 2 of us), sent some down to his dad who i think will like it...i'd say 6-8 servings depending on how big of a serving..you know us Americans and our big portions!!!

My husband said this is the best Italian dish I have ever made! I loved it but his reaction surprised me!  I had hot Italian turkey link sausage to cook and searched this site for a recipe.  I did not have squash or tomatoes or fresh basil on hand so used a can of fire roasted tomatoes and dried basil.  When all mixed together, I added some provolone cheese then grated Parmesan on top.  Served with garlic toast.  Yummmmm!

Picky family loved it.
Easy to make.
Easy to adjust for food allergies

I was shocked. My family LOVED this! They are total meat and potato, simple spaghetti and Alfredo sauce nothing fancy people. But, they had seconds...and thirds! I thought I'd be eating this beautiful squash dish my self, but everyone was in...glad stuck to the portions on the recipe! No leftovers for lunch today, but so glad I could pleas everyone. As someone with arthritis, the chopping wasn't horrible either, and I left the parm out and scooped it on gluten fee noodles before stirring in the parm and farrelle noodles for everyone else. 

I personally love recipes and food like this, if I was making it for myself, I would have left out the turkey.

After reading other reviews,  I made some changes.  I used a can of tomato, basil, oregano sauce instead of tomatoes. I added a can of tomato soup, I added chicken broth instead of bouillon cube, I used corn and peas instead of zucchini and squash, I added 2tablespoons garlic powder instead of cloves of garlic, I added 2tablespoons parsley, 1/4 cup of milk because I wanted it verysaucy.This turned out wonderful.  I got seconds and thirds. I had to make myself stop eating it. My husband also loved it.  He got seconds but kept coming back to the pot with his spoon and taking spoonfuls.  I will definitely make this dish again.  Any vegetable you like will work because the dish is so versatile.  Ther was a tiny bit left over and I wanted to eat it for breakfast but when I got to the pot, it was empty.my husband got up and ate the rest of the pot in the middle of the night because I am the first one up in the mornings. This one will be made weekly. He has already requested that I make this again. Thank you kathyp100. This is a keeper!! Yummmmmmy!

Absolutely delicious!My substitutions? No green pepper; not a fan. I added mushrooms instead (YUM!)No chicken granules for me, a bit of extra salt and pepper to go with extra Olive-Oil for the pasta at the very end makes this dish one of the easiest, tastiest, and freshest dinner options!

I'm glad to have found this light and flavorful recipe since the warm weather is upon us.  I subbed chicken sausage for the turkey sausage and diced tomatoes for the plums.  While the pasta water came to a boil I chopped everything up and the sauce was ready as soon as the noodles were al dente.  My husband would have preferred more spice, but both my daughters loved the dish as-written.

Excellent!  The only change I made the first time I made it was to put the garlic in later.  I don't like to cook the garlic too much.  The second time I made it, I wanted a cream sauce so I added a little heavy cream at the end with a little corn starch to thicken the sauce.
It was great.

This is a GREAT "starter" recipe- you can pretty much add whatever fresh veg you like or have on hand and the dish will turn out excellent. Since I don't eat pork or beef, I feel like I subject the other meat eaters in my household to a lot of turkey and chicken, which can get redundant. I found this recipe and thought it would be a nice flavor deviation to use the spicy turkey sausage, and it was! They raved about it. It's now a weeknight staple. It makes a huge amount, but freezes well. Just last night I made this and added mushrooms, jalapeno, fresh fennel, and spinach in addition to the listed veggies. I love using so many fresh veggies in one delicious dish! It has a nice spice to it. I added some tomato paste and a tbs of cream cheese to make it saucier.

This was delicious. I used hot Italian turkey sausage for extra kick and a 28oz can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh. So good. This is a keeper for sure.

Made twice. Very good. Use less oil next time. Taste just as good with any sausage.

Excellent easy recipe.  I love spicy, but I have to either use sausage that is not hot or cut down on the red pepper for my family.

This is a keeper although I made some minor adjustments.  16 ounces of pasta ended up being waaay to much, it never would have fit in my largest skillet with all the other ingredients, so I only put half of it in the mixture and refrigerated the rest for another use.  This didn't take away from the recipe at all, I thought the vegetable/pasta ratio was perfect with only half the pasta.  I cooked the pasta a couple minutes less than the package instructed so it could continue cooking in the vegetable mixture and absorb some of the flavor.  I originally didn't want to use all the oil that was called for, but ended up adding it all anyway because I doubled the Parmesan cheese and I don't think it would have melted right without the extra fat in there.  Resist to the temptation to add extra salt until you've added everything in and let it cook a few minutes.  The salt from the bullion and the cheese was just the right amount.

Outstanding.  Easily adaptable to what is on hand.  I used zucchini, squash, cherry tomatoes, onion, garlic and mushrooms.  Only a tsp. bouillon and a dash of white wine.  Delish!

Amazingly delicious, amazingly easy!  Love it!  I added carrots instead of tomatoes (because I was out of tomatoes).  It added an additionally bright color and texture to the mix!  Wonderful.

This dish had really good flavor, but I thought that the basil and tomato were a little overdone by the time the other veggies were done.  Next time, I'll wait a couple minutes (literally about two!) to add the tomato and basil so that it retains a little more shape, giving this dish more of a "fresh" and summery flavor.

Also, I don't like spicy food so I left out the red pepper flakes, but ended up adding some after sitting down to eat.  The dish is not as spicy as I thought it would be (it smells spicier than it is).  This might be because I used a sweet chicken sausage instead, but either way...

Couldn't find turkey sausage so used chicken breast instead. This dish was ok, not very flavorful. No one else liked it and I ended up eating it for lunch 3 days in a row. Won't make again.

Great recipe!!! The entire family loved it. Since I'm not a huge fan of sausage, I used chicken. And since I didn't have any fresh basil on-hand, I made a basil infused water, which actually served more than one purpose as it made for a really yummy sauce.

I added double the sausage, diced tomatoes in a can (basil, garlic, and oregano) not fresh (next time I'll try fresh though!), no green bell pepper, added baby bella mushrooms, basil prechopped out of the squeeze tube, and instead of adding the extra 1/4 cup of oil I opted to use a little of the juice from the tomatoes. Came out great!

Everyone seemed to like.  I liked to add crused red pepper and "No Salt" to mine.  I did not eat the noodles because I wanted whole wheat pasta.  I think it needed more meat, and fresh basil per the amount of veg. that I used.  It did make more sauce than pasta, so maybe cutting back on veg. (not tom.)

Very, very good! We added mushroms and left out the tomatoes and pepper. I didn't have red pepper flakes on hand so used Bourbon Street seasoning. Substituted Mozzerrella for the Parmesan b/c we had it. Still great!

This dish came out great.  I only used 1/4 c. Olive oil and substitued Roma tomatoes with diced caned tomates seasoned with basil, garlic and oregano.  Next time I will definitely add an extra squash, zuccini and a can of tomatoes.  Definitely a keeper.

This pasta dish is wonderful !!!!!!!  I added 3 tablespoons of cream cheese to it right before serving like another reviewer suggested and it was out of this world good.  I also didnt feel like chopping tomatoes so I used canned diced tomatoes (fresh would have been better but in a pinch the canned was also good).  And I used mild pork italian sausage instead of turkey sausage.  Will make again often, cant wait til the summer when I can use fresh veggies from the garden.  Thank You for sharing.

This was very good! I used a can of diced tomatoes with green chilies instead of the roma tomatoes and green peppers just because that is what I had but I thought it was awesome! I also didn't add the remaining 1/4 cup of oil. Will definitely make again.

I just made this tonight & it was fantastic! At the suggestion of others, I cut the olive oil in half, added in 2tbsp of light cream cheese & some mushrooms . It was DELICIOUS!! I will be making this again next time we have guests over... but I can guarantee all the leftovers from this time around won't be going to waste!

Delicious and simple to prepare. I would add more basil next time. I used less than 1/4 cup of the olive oil, and used cayenne pepper instead of the red pepper flakes. Next time I'll add a little cream cheese or heavy cream at the end, just to try it out with a Rose' flavor sauce.

Make this, you won't be disappointed! I added a jar of roasted red peppers instead of the green pepper. Also, I added about 5x the red pepper flakes. Will definitely make again!

This is very yummy!!  My husband LOVED it!  I almost followed the recipe.  

I added a can of tomato sauce along with the second addition of olive oil in order to make it a little more saucy.  

I also used four-color radiatore instead of farfalle because radiatore was the only whole grain colored pasta I could find.  We loved the texture the radiatore provided cause it got soft very quickly and mixed in with the vegetables really well.  

I also used mild turkey italian sausage and left out the red pepper because I have a 2-year old and I figured anyone who wanted pepper could add it to their own.

Thank you for this great recipe!

This was good, the tomatoes were too mushy for my liking. But overall, it was good.

We used a tricolor rotini and substituted chicken broth instead of bouillon. Also adjusted the oil by one half. For crisper veggies, we only cooked them for just under 2 additional minutes. Tomatoes and basil from our garden and farmers market garlic. Your recipe is insanely good. Thank you and more please!

I made some changes by adding asparagus, mushrooms and shrimp.  My husband like things a little richer so I added about 2 tbs of heavy cream.  It was absolutely awsome.  This is a keeper.  My husband and sister gave it a 9 out of 10.

This was yummy...I used the chicken sausage, cut up, zucchini, mushrooms, onions, peppers. I topped with fresh tomatoes (not a fan of warm tomatoes) and feta cheese.

I loved this dish but made some changes and my family loved it!  I used green onions and garlic together instead of diced onion.  I added broccoli and celery.  I used beef broth instead and this dish was wonderful....enjoy.

Local market was out of zucchini and yellow squash for the past two days.  I couldn't locate hot Italian turkey sausage amongst the several other varieties, so instead used "Butterball 'Everyday' Smoked Turkey Sausage" found near hot dogs of local WMT.  All other ingredients were used as directed.  Delicious!  Can't wait till the missing veggies are returned to shelves to make it again!

Delicious!!! I used spicy Italian chicken sausage because it was on sale at the butcher's counter and I also used whole wheat farfalle pasta. I used basil olive oil instead of regular olive oil to bring out more of the basil flavor because I love it so much. This was an amazing dish!!! Definitely a keeper!

I was really happy with the flavors in this dish. I usuall modify most recipes on here but didn't at all with this one. I didn't have enough fresh basil for what the recipe calls for and could have probably used a bit more of that but otherwise I loved the lighness of the dish with that spicy bite with the meat. It will be a new "go-to" pasta dish for us!

I was looking to use up some yellow squash and zucchini and this fit the bill.  Delicious!  I omitted onions based on personal preference and added red pepper (instead of green), mushrooms, and artichokes.  I used dry basil also since it's what I had on hand.  Very easy & tasty!

Served this over leftover rice instead of noodles, and added in cabbage and greens from the garden, as well as tomatoe sauce since I didn't have any fresh maters, (which made it saucy and extra delish!).  I think almost all veggies could go in this... It is an EXCELLENT base!  For summertime freshness and use of the garden and INCREDIBLE TASTE, this gets 5+ stars in my book!

Made this yesterday and loved it.  The only substitution I had to make was ground red pepper rather than the red pepper flakes.  My husband and I absolutely loved this.  Great way to use fresh vegetables.

Everyone in the family enjoyed it. Used Italian sweet bulk sausage and whole wheat fettucine noodles because that it was what I had. It was a great use of all the summer veggies we get from our CSA share and the garden.

Love this recipe and will make it over and over in the future. I happened to have Italian seasoned ground turkey on hand, which we had never eaten before. We used that in this recipe and it was excellent. I subbed red bell pepper for green since that's what I had on hand and I will make it that way in the future as well. So good! This will be my go to recipe in future when I'm making a dinner for friends.

Loved it. It was a light, fun summertime meal.  Used Trader Joe's hot italian sausage, and while my husband loved the spiciness, was a little too hot for me.  Next time I will use a combination of hot & sweet sausage.  Thanks Kathy.

Very tasty!  I wasn't sure if the sausage was supposed to be the sliced or ground kind, I bought links and removed the casing. Added a bit of chicken stock and used the twisty noodles since that was what I had.  We enjoyed this!

This recipe has fantastic flavors and is relatively easy to make.  After making this a few times, it is also very flexible around what types of veggies to use.  If the zucchini and squash are not available a multi colored pepper mix works well.  I do not add the pasta into the skillet, but use it as a base and put the rest on top, keeps the pasta from getting soggy, particularly for leftovers.  It does make great leftovers.  I also increase the red pepper flakes and added oregano to the basil for more flavor.  Family favorite.

I sustituted the squash for portabello mushroom and used pork-based italian sausage because i couldn't find turkey.  I also used the oil from frying the sausage.  We loved it - thanks!

I used ground beef instead of the ground turkey and it turned out really good.  The next time I might try Andouille sausage.

AMAZING DISH!  Made it for a family gathering and everyone loved it!  The vegetables bring out such flavor and the colors are even more appealing.  Frozen vegetables do even work if you don't have fresh, just thaw them before putting them into the skillet.  I did have extra juice so I spooned the vegetable mix INTO the pasta and turkey.  I used Magic's Vegetable Seasoning which was a great addition.

I made this last night and didn't change a thing! I did use whole wheat farfalle. It was FABULOUS!!  My husband is not a huge fan of basil but I put it in anyway and he RAVED about the dish!  Even though you cook everything, it is such a light dish that it is perfect for a summer dinner!  We are going to have an Italian night and invite friends over for this!  THANKS, Kathy

This was a great dish! I used Kielbasa instead of the turkey sausage because that's all I had on hand. I also used a red pepper instead of the green and used mushrooms instead of the squash. It came out perfect! I didn't have any fresh basil leaves either so I used some italian seasoning. With all of the changes I made it was still very flavorful. This goes to show how versatile this recipe is. My boyfriend loved it. I can't wait to make it again!!

This was amazingly delicious!! I followed the recipe to the exact requirements. Just had to substitute red roasted peppers as I didn't have a green one. I read a lot of reviews & was contemplating putting in the cream cheese to make it creamy, but so glad I did not, as the sauce this made was light & delicious. My husband loved it & I will definitely make this again!!

Delicious, & pretty guilt-free.  I added some sliced carrots too and used chicken both with a splash of white wine in the sauce- less sodium that way.  Didn't feel so bad about having the garlic bread with it.  Thank you!!

Made this for dinner last night.  It was very good.  I did get a little carried away with the veggies and probably used more than called for.  Added mushrooms too.  I increased the turkey sausage as I thought 2 oz. per serving was really skimpy.

This makes a ton of food and had great flavor! I used canned tomatoes instead of fresh and probably not quite 1/2 cup olive oil. Delicious!

Just made this tonight and it was very tasty!  I thought it might be a little bland but it was not at all!  My two year old even ate 3 helpings.  The only thing I would do different next time is keep the sausage on the side or use chicken.  I am not a huge sausage fan so that could be why.  The pasta and veggies were wonderful together!

REALLY good, both me an my husband ate 2 helpings.  I didn't have the basil, peppers, or onions this time and it was still awesome. Versatile too, just add your favorite vegetables and protein. (although the turkey sausage is SO delicious) It's such a great springtime dinner!

This dish was really good. We didn't have any basil but it was still delicious. We will absolutely make it again, this time with basil. It very well may become one of our staple meals!

This was pretty good, however it was a bit bland.  Next time I make it I will add more sausage and cut back on the noodles.  I'll probably try using canned tomatoes as well.

Very good recipe! I had quite a mix of veggies on hand and this worked out perfectly. I made exactly as written (my farfale was high fiber though)but added a lot of fresh cracker pepper and about 1/2 tsp salt to get it seasoned where we like it. A good mix of vegetables but, you really could use a variety of veggies and this still be good. I will make again. And will try adding mushrooms and canned (undrained) tomatoes and some white wine, next time. Thanks, for a good heart-healthy recipe KathyP!

This was a great recipe.  I have been looking for other ways to prepare pasta bc the regular pasta with red or white sauce and chicken cutlets gets boring.  This was great and the veggies made it much healthier than the way we normally serve pasta.

This was really just ok for me.  Pretty good for a healthy meal, but it did not blow me away as others seem to have been blown.  I don't know if this has been mentioned, but I have never seen a skillet that could accommodate this much food!  It was a ton!  Luckily I had a large foil roasting pan to "assemble" it all in at the end.  Of course, this also means I had a LOT leftover.  I froze individual portions, and to be honest I was pretty sick of it by the time it was gone.  I probably won't make it again.  Sorry!

I will definitely be making this again! I used a can of diced tomatoes and it worked great. I didn't drain the tomatoes, therefore I didn't add the extra olive oil. I also added a little shredded colby-jack cheese and let that melt in it. I also used some leftover chicken I had instead of the sausage. Great way to get your veggies and you could change the veggies to whatever you like. I think this would be great with fresh spinach, broccoli, asparagus, corn, etc. Thanks for sharing!

Huge hit with all of us - I used 1 cup of chix broth and only used about 3 Tbsp of oil - I think 1/2 cup is a little excessive, either way, this is a keeper and I will definitely make this again.

Made this last night after work, and it was wonderful! The fresh basil is key. The dish is so fresh, delicious, and beautiful. I made it as written, but think you could easily substitue chicken, shrimp, or salmon for the turkey sausage. I served with a salad and a crusty French baguette. Easy, elegant excellance!

The basil flavor in this dish was delicious. Loved it, loved it.  I used lots of mushrooms and basil and didn't have any tomatoes handy so I used a can of tomato paste and that worked really well. Lots of diced sweet onion and garlic too.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This dish is astounding. I used grilled chicken instead of turkey sausage, and went heavy on all the seasonings. That was two weeks ago, and my husband-- who is not into vegetables at all-- STILL has not stopped raving about it. Excellent balance of textures, amaing flavor. Don't use dried basil instead of fresh-- the flavor of the fresh basil is irreplacible. My favorite recipe off this site so far!

This was wonderful!  Thank you.  Such a nice alternative to plain old pasta with meatballs and sauce.  I always use whole grain pasta and it turned out beautifully.  As other reviewers suggested, it's best to reduce the amount of oil - I used just enough to cover the pan and flavor the veggies.  Will definitely make this again.

I really liked this I had everything and thought what the heck try it I would make this again. I didn't have the turkey so I used regular brats(I'm not a big fan of brats but I like this.) I would make this again I also used canned tomatoes. Very good.

My Daughter-in-law made this recipe last week with fresh veggies and it was absolutely delicious.  I now have a copy and will be making it for my husband and I tonight for dinner.

I used bowtie pasta and turkey kielbasa.  Turned out to be a hearty meal with the kielbasa.  If I make this dish again, I'll be sure to use more red pepper.

Simple and amazingly tasty! Instead of bullion cubes I used vegetarian "chicken" stock powder from our local Natural Food Co-op (in Sacramento, California), and chicken sausages from Trader Joe's. I also used all organic veggies, including tomatoes from our garden. Perfect!

This was a great recipe.  The children really enjoyed it.  I made a few changes due to not having all the vegetables on hand.  I used spinach, a whole onion, red pepper, and black beans.  I followed the rest of the directions as listed.

This was really good - I followed recipe exactly except used less oil which you can totally do with success.  Served with some balsamic vinegar sprinkled on the noodles.  YUM!

My husband requested "Pasta with zucchini and Italian sausage" for dinner so I searched and found this recipe.  Wow!  It was so simple that I can't quite figure out why it was so good!  I substituted the green with red bell pepper as well and found a go-to dish that made us both go back for seconds!  Thanks!

Scrumptiously delicious!! I used ground breakfast turkey sausage & yellow pepper. I diced & cooked the garlic, onion & fresh basil together. I used about 6 large leaves of basil. I used canola oil because it was the only oil that I had. I bought canned diced tomatoes, but forgot to add them. This dish tasted perfect anyway, full of vibrant color & aroma!! Thanks to the person that submitted this recipe!!

I changed this recipe so much that I probably shouldn't rate it, but I will anyway.  I didn't have zuchinni or summer squash, but I added small-cut broccoli, mushrooms and frozen peas.  We all went nuts about this and stuffed ourselves.  Like many users, you can vary the veggies and it's still great.

This recipe is to die for! The only change I make is I use red bell pepper in place of green, only because we're not green bell pepper fans. I've made this for friends and family on numerous occasions and I always get high praise. I would purchase this plate if I saw it on a restaurant menu. Five stars is not enough.

This was just okay. I expected it to have more flavor with all the great fresh ingredients, but it was kinda bland...and also kinda dry. I guess I prefer my pasta to have at least  light one.  Also this kind of sausage is tough to slice and eat with the skin on, I would recommend removing the casings and crumbling it when browning it.

This recipe was easy, quick and delicious. We are definitely adding it to our rotation.

It also allows flexibility. The following changes were due to what I had on hand: Rotelle pasta, red bell pepper, Hillshire Farms Turkey smoked sausage, Better Than Bullion (Superior) Chicken Soup paste.

Good job OP! Thanks!

This dish is absolutely amazing!  I substituted chicken sausage for turkey sausage and I used rotini pasta instead of farfalle.  But I thought it had just the right amount of "kick" and even my 5 year old loved it!!  We will definitely make this one again!!

Wasn't impressed with this - too spicey and the flavor wasn't great to me.  If I were to make it again, I would not use Hot Italian Turkey Sausage and red pepper flakes, it was way overpowering with the hot/spicey, and I would need do some changing with the flavor of it.

Everyone in my family loved this, including my daughter.   Only changes I made were using ground turkey sausage, omitted the red pepper flakes and green pepper and did not include as many tomatoes.   We all love this.  Thanks for sharing.

Love this recipe; have already made it twice!  I sub a can of diced tomato for the fresh and skip the bouillon.  The juice from the canned tom's helps make a nice sauce. I also use way less than 1/2 cup oil, and add some tomato sauce at the end.  Highly recommended!

I love this recipe.  Even my children loved it who range from 18 months to thirteen years old.  I ate it three days in a row because I enjoyed it so much.  Usually I end throwing left overs away.  Not this time.  I will be making it often.  I followed the recipe exactly how it was written.

too spicy and i like primavera in a cream sauce. I think I might try it again though, but this time take out the pepper flakes and use halved cherry tomatoes instead of plum tomatoes.

Perfect!  I added more red pepper, threw in some red wine (about 1/4 cup) and also added some artichoke hearts (probably 1 cup diced).  It is beautiful and delicious.

This is an excellent dish. Very colorful, and because it is not heavily seasoned all of the ingredients add a wonderful complexity. The preparation really is not burdensome but I found that the cooking time of the veggies was longer than called for.

This is a really great recipe. I used sundried tomato-basil chicken sausage, extra basil and farfalle (bow tie pasta). I wasn't able to use yellow squash, but it came out great anyway. A very tasty way to incorporate fresh vegetables and herbs into your diet.

This dish is very good, next time I will mix up some of the veggies to fit my tastes, less zuchinni and add mushrooms & spinach.  I cut out half the oil too and used chicken broth.  Will make again, thanks!

The whole family enjoyed this meal!  Followed the recipe, except used red pepper instead of green and omitted the zucchini.  Came out great and the leftovers were equally delicious.

Very good! I did make a few changes. I used sweet sausage and just added a couple of more pepper flakes.1 can of whole tomatoes. which I just squish with my hands. I also added a chopped carrotand lots of locatelli cheese. Locatelli is a type of romamo cheese.
        Thanks

This was excellent!  I used smoked turkey sausage and a can of diced tomatoes in place of the roma's.  This makes a ton and we love leftovers!  Will definitely make this one again - thanks for sharing!

This was excellent! I used much less sausage because I don't eat much meat and omitted the red pepper because I have a little one. I cut the pasta to 6 oz. (scaled to 4 servings) but will cut it to 4 oz when I make it again.

Quite possibly the best pasta dish I've had!  The only substitute I made was using 2 tsp of store bought crushed garlic instead of fresh.  I will definately make this again... everyone loved it!

I used pork sausage, [hot italian] about 2lbs. Followed the rest of the recipe to the letter, and tryed on friends the first time I made this and it was a fantastic hit. Will do this many times again!!!

The boy and I loved this. It reheats really well too! I didn't have the zucchini on hand, but I did add some roasted anaheim chilis and red peppers, which worked really well with this. I also added a can of diced tomatoes because only had 3 tomatoes on hand.

LOVED IT! I adjusted by using regular vine ripe tomatoes, which I think was a mistake---romas might not have been so watery. This was delicious & very colorful.

Great start, but I adapted it some to make a smaller batch. Used 1/2 the squash, pepper (red) & pasta, only 1 to 2 Tablespoons oil & white wine for additional liquid. So delicious!!

Made this for my family tonight and they loved it! So did it. It was fairly easy to make. I didn’t use all the noodles or any Parmesan but that’s just my personal preference. Can’t wait to eat left overs for lunch. Will definitely make again!

This recipe is easy and delicious as is. We use Herbox bouillon so it is very low sodium and hot Italian chicken sausage. Yummy.

Really good, but too spicy! I will cut the red pepper flakes down next time. I substituted chicken for the sausage, a splash of chicken broth instead of the bouillon, and used a 15oz can of diced tomatoes (suggested in another review), both of which worked wonderfully.

Anything all six of my kids 17 down to 2 will eat and ask for seconds off deserves a positive review! We opted to not add as much pepper for personal tastes but otherwise, we stayed true to the posted recipe. It was delightful!

Quite delicious and easy. I made the following changes: added mushrooms, added canned Italian tomatoes, used chicken sausage. I also just cooked the sausage and veggies all together. I just put the sausage in first, then mushrooms 6-8 mins later, and then the veggies 5 mins later. Mixed it all up in one put with the Parmesan and a small bit of marinara. Huge hit!

I love one dish meals and this one is a keeper.  I did use the canned flavored tomatoes and only 1/4 cup of olive oil, everything else as directed.  The family loved it.  Will definitely make this again and soon.  Very tasty and versatile.

The first time I make a recipe, I follow it perfectly, with a few exceptions. I cooked the sausage on my grill because it is cooked before the veggies.  The boxes of pasta they sell here only have 12 oz. The recipe calls for 16 oz. I only used the 12 oz box, but that seemed to be enough. 

This had a wonderful flavor. Its a great summer dish. There are only two of us this time of year, but I made the full recipe. Needless to say we will have some excellent leftovers later this week.

Loved this! Only changed the pasta to penne, added a little more garlic and a serrano pepper diced fine, and I used better than  bouillon because that's all I had, it's a keeper!

This is a perfect recipe.  I made a few changes and add more or different veggies each time. My hubby isn’t a fan of zucchini, so I had half each of these bell peppers: red, yellow and orange to substitute.   Love this recipe.

I substituted chicken sausage or regular Italian sausage because I prefer those over anything turkey. This is basically a sausage recipe. You ca even use chorizo sausage

This turned out really good.  It's important not to overcook the vegetables. I used fresh pappardelle, and used some white wine to deglaze the pan after cooking the onions and garlic. Used sweet yellow pepper instead of green, just a personal preference.  Didn't need the whole 1/2 c of oil, just added a tablespoon of butter at the end. My husband loved it! This is a keeper

I used mild Italian sausage and Rainbow Rotini instead of the Farfalla pasta recommended in the recipe. I also used a whole Valdalia onion and six cloves of garlic. I used only three Roma plum tomatoes but replaced them with 1/2 sweet red bell pepper and 1/2 orange bell pepper. This made it super colorful. Also only used about 1/8 cup olive oil and that was plenty! This was so fresh and well seasoned it needed no extra salt or pepper and we served the shaved paramasean cheese on the side to sprinkle on top at the table. I think this adds to the color and don't recommend heating the cheese in the pasta as the last step of the published recipe instructs. It turned out brilliantly colorful with fantastic flavor! I made this dish that serves eight and fed four of us....it was nearly gone!! I will definitely repeat this!

Made tonight for hubby and myself. This is a keeper! I really appreciate the suggestions of others and incorporated some of them.  Used a 14.5 oz can of stewed tomatoes w/Italian herbs (undrained), broccoli, bell pepper, carrots and celery (cuz that's what I had on hand) in addition to the onions and garlic.  Added some 4-cheese Italian blend and grated Asiago cheese, then freshly ground pepper. I also kept the pasta separate as I knew we'd have leftovers.  To serve, I put some pasta in first, then spooned the veggie/meat /cheese mixture on top. Then I microwaved on high for 1 minute. Give it a stir.  Absolutely yummy!

I was meal prepping for my daughter and I chose this one for its ease (as I was also making 5 other dishes).  It came out great, with lots of flavor.  I wanted to use the turkey sausage, but the regular Italian was half the price, so I went with that.  I also used chick pea pasta, as that was what I had on hand.  It was easy to freeze in single serve ziplock bags.  I made half a recipe and it made 4 bags.  I will definitely do this one again.

Great recipe and was pretty quick to make. I tripled it for my family of 6 (2 adults and 4 kids who are between 2-7). I think I will cut back on the oil next time but I think it was flavorful and everyone finished, which is what I want!

This turned out so great! I made this for a special anniversary dinner for my boyfriend and it was so great!! I ended up cooking everything up earlier but had extra time before dinner time so I put it in a casserole pan and sprinkled some cheese on top and kept it in the oven on 100 degrees for the remaining time while I got ready and it tasted so good! Loved the squash in it as well.

Like others, I did not have fresh tomatoes and used canned. I did not have a bell pepper. Used only 1/4 c oil.  Otherwise followed recipe exactly. We love this. Will keep it in our rotation. What a great used of veggies. Thanks for a great one.

I put a little bit of low fat milk in to thicken the sauce a little, and replaced the bell pepper with white mushrooms because of personal preference. Has so many of my favorite ingredients to cook with and it was delicious - I will definitely make it again!

Loved the inspiration although I changed the following: chicken chipotle sausage, added artichoke hearts and green olives... used less of the tomatoes and zucchini but then regretted that decision.

Fair amount of prep. The only yellow squash available was butter nut and thus  quite hard. I would precook that to give it a running shot. As it was had to cook much longer than ten minutes to get it soft.
Result was marvelous - especially for a novice like me.
The kitchen did look like I'd killed the turkey there by the time I was done.

This was delicious!  I  made a few minor changes, based on what I had on hand.  I am sure this would be delicious as written.  I used a different shaped pasta, sweet Italian turkey sausage, a whole onion, and  dried basil.  The recipe says it serves 8, but I am pretty sure it would serve a lot more.  It seems like a perfect recipe to bring to a potluck.

This is a wonderful basic receipe that I changed to my tastes. Used both sweet and hot turkey sausages. Sautéed   onion  in EVOO  and garlic and then threw in every veggie I had in the house! I used Italian seasoning and crushed red pepper and 1 cup of chicken broth and a can of garlic and basil diced tomatoes... Whole wheat pasta and wow, it was great.

I usually  make double pasta cause my husband is a pasta fiend. Instead of extra oil I use white cooking wine and cream of chicken soup.  Still amazing!

So tasty! I made it by cooking sausage (then set aside). Sautéed a whole onion and garlic in EVOO. Before the onion was completely sautéed, I added squash and zucchini. I added in 2 cans of Rotel (one regular and one mild). Added chicken bouillon and pepper. Then I put fresh basil, fresh parsley, fresh kale, and fresh spinach into the mix. I made tortellini stuffed with cheese (purchased from Costco) and mixed it all up. We topped it with parmesan cheese. Delicious!

Added peaches for a sweet summer twist, which enhanced the flavor quite a bit. Otherwise, while I liked this recipe it was nothing outstanding. I think I'll add some additional fresh herbs next time and probably will add the basil at the end instead of wilting it in.

In 10 years of using Allrecipes, this one is by far my favorite dish.  I love it and everyone around me loves it.  It is my go to dish when making food for a lot of people.  Its easy to substitute ingredients that you like or don't.  Its hard to find turkey sausage, so I use Mild Italian Sausage.  I also use more peppers and less of the harder to find vegetables.  I sometimes make it for myself and eat it for lunch every day of the week, its that good!

Wonderful!  Made changes, but not to many.  Used 1/2 lb (4 links) sausage.  Didn't use all the olive oil.  Just used enough to brown sausage.  Didn't need to add any to saute onion & garlic, and sliced baby bella mushrooms. Didn't have yellow squash. Used zucchini, carrots, red bell pepper.  Don't used bullion cubes.  Added a little bit (maybe 1/4 - 1/3 cup) low sod. chicken broth.  Added a little cornstarch to thicken sauce before adding cheese, pasta and sausage back in.  Used whole wheat pasta. Threw in some toasted pine nuts too.

We loved it. I did do a lot of add ons though. I used veggie bow-tie pasta (because that's what I had). Since it wasn't creamy enough for my taste I doubled the amount of parmessan cheese, added 1/2 cup of milk and 2 tablespoons of cream cheese. I'm not a fan of sausage so I used chicken and seasoned that with salt, pepper, and Cajun. Sooo good! I love this recipe it's a nice base and then you can get fancy with it if you wish.

I used boneless chicken breast, left out the red pepper, and used dried basil. But my wife and I loved it. I will definitely make this again!

Deliciously light and satisfying! I used crumbled basil & chicken sausages (casings removed) and ripe, sweet grape tomatoes (instead of romas). Also used chicken buillion paste (as I don't have granuals) and substituted asparagus for the yellow squash as it wasn't available at my store. I deglazed the pan with a little no-salt chicken broth after sautéing the sausages, onion and garlic (to get up all those yummy bits). Added the basil at the very end (otherwise it gets mushy) and mixed everything together for maybe 3 min over medium heat. Served it with the Parmesan cheese sprinkled on top - what a hit! Hubby absolutely loved it and I did too. Definitely company worthy!

I had made this using chicken sausage also. I don't particularly care for hot sausage so I used sweet sausage. When I don't have fresh tomatoes I use stewed tomatoes,  this works pretty good. I definitely recommend this recipe. One review stated they put a little milk in at the end I tried this and it works well.

This was so good, loved the mixture of veggies. I also added mushrooms like some of the others. Next time I think I'll use a tad more sausage, and I'll put in the onions & garlic along with the other veggies because they burnt immediately. But it still turned out pretty good!

Not only is this a great recipe, but it can be quite flexible too. I did not have any squash or zucchini in the house, so I used fresh asparagus. I had intended to include fresh mushrooms too, but forgot. I had to substitute dried for fresh basil also. No doubt, fresh basil would have made a huge difference, but as it was, even with dried basil and the other  modifications (I didn't have time to get to the store), it was still excellent. Careful to taste before adding any salt. Maybe it's the salt in the Parmesan cheese, but the dish was plenty salty without adding any. Enjoy!

Love this!!  I make it just like the recipe except that I omit the peppers because my kids don't like them and I use a 28 oz can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh and it is wonderful! Occasionally I add other veggies that I may have like fresh mushrooms asparagus or spinach.  My whole family loves it and there are never any leftovers!

This is a pretty good recipe, but I had to modify slightly since my kids and I do not like spicy food.  I omitted the red pepper flakes, bell pepper and replaced hot Italian turkey sausage with herb and sundried tomato chicken sausage.  I also used small box of Pomi chopped tomatoes instead of chopped Roma tomatoes and added black pepper, garlic powder and onion powder.  It was tasty and everyone enjoyed it.

I really like this recipe. My mom uses turkey sausage to make regular spaghetti so I knew I would love the turkey sausage. I actually added mushrooms and I wish I added more basil to the recipe. Other than that, I love it and would definitely recommend it. I also added crushed red pepper which adds a nice kick to it. (Photo is without the noodles added yet)

This was delicious.  I only used 2 tablespoons of oil in the beginning to sauté the onion and garlic and didn't use any more after that.  Also I didn't have fresh tomatoes so drained a can of diced tomatoes but in the summer I'll use tomatoes from my garden.  Thanks KathyP

Great recipe. I used what I had so I substituted carrots and mushrooms for the zucchini and squash, canned tomatoes because I hate cutting them myself, 1/2 tsp of both dried basil and Italian seasoning for the fresh basil leaves, and I only used half of the olive oil since the canned tomatoes added enough liquid. Marking this as a favorite recipe for sure.

I didn't have any chicken bullion so used a couple tablespoons of low sodium soy sauce for flavor, was a fantastic meal, everyone devoured it.

I used apple chicken sausage to tone down the spice and used whole wheat rotini for the pasta.  My kids weren't big on it, but both my husband and I thought it was tasty.

This is wonderful.  Made it with pork sausage and used the drippings to saute the onion & garlic.  Followed the balance of the recipe to a "T".  Hubby  loves it and guests raved.

I made some major changes, so I'm a little hesitant to review this, but I want to throw in my two cents.  Because of picky eaters at my house, I kept the veggies, sausage with sauce, and pasta all separate.  I ate all the components together and enjoyed it.  I reduced the oil a bit and added about 2 oz of cream cheese and stirred in a little milk.  I was very flexible with the measurements and just threw some of everything in until it seemed right.  It turned out great and I'll be making this recipe again.

My entire family loved this dish! I added some ingredients (very little) like roasted garlic, olives and sun dried tomatoes from the Mediterranean bar at our local grocery store, the oils that these bathe in really boost the Italian flavor.

This recipe was great!  My only comment is that there was no way the whole thing would fit into a skillet at the end.  All the vegetables barely fit.  It wasn't a problem though--once the vegetables were done cooking with the bullion I mixed everything together in a bowl and served--no need to cook any additional time.  I did make one change--after cooking the sausage I kept the grease in the pan and used that to cook the vegetables rather than draining and replacing with olive oil.

Really tasty quick week night dinner. I used sweet Italian sausage so it wasn't too spicy for my littles and I did use seasoned diced tomatoes as others had suggested. I will definitely make again.

I make hundreds of things from this website, but have never rated one....no matter how good, till now. Super easy, super fresh, one pan (unless you count boiling the pasta) and it can stay warm for multiple shifts of family coming and going with sports and after school. My husband and kids all had extra helpings, and asked for it again today! Perfect weekday dinner. 

I used canned diced tomatoes with oregano, etc. I added a bit more tomato sauce or you could add another can of tomatoes (we are saucy people) and water. I also used a little red and green pepper. Next time I'll add more veggies as those went fast and probably dice the sausage smaller. The chicken stock granules or past and fresh basil made the difference in flavor. But it was amazing!

I followed the recipe exactly, but probably put a bit more chicken bouillon in it.  My zucchini and yellow squash were not small and my skillet needed to be bigger -- but once this was served to my family, everyone raved about it being the best pasta meal I've ever made!  It's healthy, it's delicious.

My husband had a friend for dinner and this was a hit! I finely chopped everything but left the tomatoes chunky and did not add 2 teaspoons chicken bouillon granules. I also used hot Italian sausage instead of turkey sausage. To add more flavor I used additional spices.

This had a good flavor to it, but I did not put all that oil in it...yuk.  A quarter cup oil is way too much to cook a small amount of onion and garlic in ... and then to add another half cup.  It was fine without all that oil.

This recipe is fantastic!!  The only thing I changed is using sweet Italian sausage instead of hot because of preference.  I have cooked this a few times for family and it always gets rave reviews.  I've had multiple requests for the recipe as well.  I love that the left-overs taste just as good!

This was great but I had to modify it to work with what I had on hand. I used broccoli, regular garden tomatoes, baby eggplant, and a variety of peppers, hot and sweet because I had no squash available. I skipped the red pepper flakes since I used Serrano peppers in the mix. I cut back on the parmesan a bit and added some shredded mozzarella cheese. I only had rotini pasta but it still tasted great. Everything else was the same as called for. You could modify it many different ways and it would still be great.

Very tasty. I did not have zucchini  or squash, but used red and green pepper instead, but basically followed directions for the rest, with gluten free spirals. Have to say quite yummy. Try it, you should enjoy this! 8.5/10

My husband and I both really liked this recipe. I would recommend having everything chopped before starting to cook then you can gauge the doneness of the vegetables better.  I made a few little changes. I added garden green bean and broccoli to the suggested veg. Also changed green pepper to red. I added about 4 oz of low fat cream cheese at the end when mixing everything together. Next time I would add more vegetables and less pasta. Be careful at a the end not to cook too much as veg will become mushy quickly and it's great if they are still crisp. But overall we loved it and will definitely make again.

Wow! This dish was light and delicious. Everyone who ate it (the 6 of us) all had seconds. It was gone within 30 minutes. I don't think that's healthy to devour it so quickly, but it was soooo good! Made just as the recipe said and can't say enough good things. Thanks for the recipe.

I made this for dinner only because I had most of the ingredients and I wanted to try something different. I did not use the chicken bouillon or yellow squash only because I didn't have them on hand. However, we didn't miss it. I used more zucchini and bell peppers...yellow, green and red. I found that the 1/2 cup of oil is too much. I didn't even use that much and found that it was still more than the dish needed. I did use fresh tomatoes but not roma, that is not the tomato plant variety I have in my back yard but I think any type will do just fine. I also made this dish with penne pasta and cooked everything in my cast iron which turned out great. I will defiantly make this again.

This was amazing!! I had to sub a couple things - gluten free pasta, dried basil, extra zucchini for the squash, coconut oil instead of EVOO. We has another family over and tried this out for the first time and everyone was asking for the recipe!

This recipe took a lot of prep. I'm OK with a knife, but needed maybe 30-35 minutes to get everything cleaned and cut. That having been said, the flavor was good, but I was not pleased that some things had become overcooked and rather mushy. I wonder if maybe the pasta should only be half cooked in the beginning, then added at the end to then become al dente. I will make it again, but will ignore the prep/cook times. I'm tempted to make the leftovers into a casserole.

Very yummy!  Makes way too much for 2 people so I will cut it in 1/2 next time and still have leftovers. Made a few changes. I used spicy turkey sausage (and eliminated the pepper flakes, my Mr has a candy mouth),  Also instead of fresh tomatos I used fire roasted garlic canned tomatos. and did not drain. This is definitely a meal for company with salad and garlic bread.

I've been a member for years, and this dish inspired my first review. Delicious!! Such a good summertime pasta, with just the right amount of spiciness. My only variation was I added about a cup or so of chopped broccoli. I also added some salt and freshly ground pepper, but that should be a given. I will definitely be making this again. Thanks for the recipe!

I was looking for a vegetarian pasta dish and decided to give this a try, minus the sausage. It was very tasty! I didn't measure anything - just threw it all together and it turned out great. I used dried onion instead of fresh, and omitted the yellow squash (and sausage, as mentioned). The bouillon cubes were a little hard to dissolve, but keep at it and they'll eventually disappear, adding good flavor. I will be making this again. Can't wait to eat my leftovers!

I followed the recipe to the letter with the exception of using rotel tomatoes with chillies instead of the plum tomatoes, but it turned out absolutely delicious

This was really tasty.  I'm not sure if I used veggies that were too large, but my skillet was full.  I added everything into a bowl and mixed, because there just wasn't enough room.

I did make a couple of small changes, I'm allergic to peppers, so I left out the green bell, and added a couple more Romas and mushrooms to balance.  It was very filling and we'll be eating for lunches for the next week or so!

I used sweet turkey sausage, and omitted the onion. This was really good, but was a little dry for my taste. Next time I will use a can of diced tomatoes in order to make it more moist.

I made this nearly to recipe. I did not put any red pepper in it. Wow, it had great flavor. I was so tickled to have a veggie recipe that complimented and not overpowered the dish. If you don't love squash this is the recipe for you, it is a very delicate taste. Made it to my repeat pile to make again. Thanks so much!!

Very tasty! We ditched the red pepper flakes entirely because we weren't wanting a spicy dish. There is a LOT of food when this is all said and done, so we didn't need any sides. Overall, we loved it and my husband wished he had work in the morning so he could take leftovers in for lunch to show off.

LOVED this recipe--very tasty! As others did-- I substituted the roma tomatoes with a 15 oz can of seasoned diced tomatoes and skipped the Parmesan Cheese.

It took me 2 hours to make this dish but it was well worth the wait!  I had to really cut my sausage down and turn the heat up to get it cooked and my zucchini didn't want to get soft.  Not an issue with the recipe, the medium temperature recommended just didn't work for my skillet.  I had to use medium high and use a cover once I put in the zucchini.  Anyway, the only changes I made were that I used sweet Italian sausage (we don't like spicy stuff!), no red pepper flakes and I used all zucchini instead of some squash.  My son-in-law who hates veggies even cleaned his plate!  Yummy noises abounded during dinner which is the ultimate sign of a good dish.

This was absolutely delicious! My husband is still talking about it 3 days later!  I didn't put the green pepper in due to personal prefrence.  I used dried basil because I can't get fresh basil in my small town.  I used 2 cans of Italian diced tomatoes . I used whole wheat fettuccini .  I also used beef  bouillon  granules because that's what I had on hand. I will be making this again very soon!

I made this as a Vegetarian dish and everyone loves it! This is the second time I made it and I just substituted the sausage with the Trader Joe meatless Italian Sausage. The kids really like it even with the tomatoes and peppers.

The sausage was so yummy and really added to the flavor. I wouldn't do chicken because I think it would be a little too bland.

Very very good! I also finely chopped some spinach I needed to get rid of. Because I basically minced the spinach leaves, we couldn't taste it. So I would say my review is as the recipe follows. We did add a few sprinkles of mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Perfect and quick!

This dish was yummy! I altered a bit due to what I had on hand. I used whole wheat rigatoni instead of the farfalle pasta , a container of Cherub tomatoes for the fresh (they needed to be used), couple TBS veggie broth for the chicken seasoning, added fresh mushrooms that also needed to be used, and did not use red pepper for other palates in the house :)  Thanks KATHY

I love this recipe! It is very tasty and the family loves it. I have made it a few times, as written it is great. Our family preference is less pasta, more veg, only 1/4C oil and a bit less red pepper(we have one spice wimp in the family). Fresh basil is always the best and the freshness of the veggies in the dish is amazing and a refreshing reminder of summer!

I don't use chicken bullion cubes, since they're loaded with salt and MSG (which causes food addiction), so I switched it to a half cup of organic chicken broth. I also prefer extreme flavor, so had to add a 1/2 teaspoon chili powder, a  pinch of ceyenne pepper, a pinch of sea salt and a teaspoon of black pepper. Basically, if it doesn't burn even a tiny bit, I won't eat it. In addition, I didn't have fresh basil at home (the plant died) but did have fresh parsley and cilantro, so I added a half cup of that as well, and as a replacement for the fresh basil. As I always say, "The fresher, the better." It was amazingly deliscious, and enough for 4 with leftovers.

I used sweet Italian Sausage without casing. Did not have the same vegetables, just used whatever that was on hand and it still came out good. Nice simple recipe. The Parmesan cheese and fresh basil is a must. Thanks for posting the recipe.

I made the recipe with sweet Italian sausage instead of the hot style. I cut the oil in half, using only the amount needed to saute the garlic and onions. I also cut the amount of garlic in half. I didn't have the instant chicken bouillon, so I crumbled up vegetable bouillon cubes instead, and I was out of fresh basil, so I used dried. Finally, I omitted the Parmesan as a stir-in, but did have it to sprinkle on top. I will make this again!

Very very good!!! I didn't have roma tomatoes so I used a can of fire roasted diced tomatoes, added the zucchini and mini red and yellow peppers instead of the yellow squash. I also added a couple tablespoons of heavy cream to make the sauce a little thicker. yummy!!! will definitely make this again. Thank you!

This was okay, but nothing spectacular. I think the chicken bouillon gave a nice flavor to the dish, but overall, it was kind of bland. Next time, I'll add some pesto to the vegetable/sausage mix.

Very good recipe. I just made a few small tweaks to make it a truly great meal for me. First, I used regular mild Italian sausage since that's what I prefer. Then sprinkled a small pinch of salt on each of the veggies just before adding them to the pan to draw out their liquid. Then added a few grinds of pepper, and mostly importantly a Tbs or so of lemon juice while the veggies were cooking for that extra bit of acidity and brightness. Next time I might even add some fresh spinach to it too.

This dish was delicious. I had to substitute vegetarian sausage, and a veggie bouillon cube, but other than cutting the oil in half, I followed the recipe. My family loved it, too. Thank you Kathy!

Delicious!  All fresh ingredients and very Mediterranean!  I added a sprinkling of salt - omitted from the recipe - and used chicken broth instead of granules.  And I added mushrooms and toasted pine nuts.  My husband loved it!  It was really good!

This dish turned out great!  I will definitely use again!  I halved the recipe and tweaked it a bit.  I added mushrooms, forgot the basil (oops, but it will tasted great!) and I was out of red pepper flakes so I used a sprinkling of chili powder.  It was the perfect amount of spicy! I only used olive oil to initially cook the onions and garlic.  I didn't add the oil after that but I did add a bit of sour cream that I needed to use up so make it a bit creamy.  It was a very tasty dish and my friends who were over for dinner loved it!

Awesome recipe! I didn't have fresh basil, so I added 1T of dried basil with the garlic and onion. I also cooked the turkey sausage with the onion and then added the other ingredients (canned tomatoes as suggested by another review) along with some red pepper flakes. This recipe was a hit! My whole family loved it, even my husband who hates ground turkey :) Thanks Kathy!!

OMG!  Sooo good!  I made it with some lemon chicken sausage (which cooked up like little meatballs) that I bought at the farmer's market a while back.  I left out the zucchini as we've had it already this week, but used fresh ASPARAGUS and BUTTERNUT SQUASH that was precut in a small bag in the produce section.  Also a RED pepper and a sweet onion in random coarse chops.  Very flavorful and SO pretty.  Could have served the President and been proud!  Thanks to great recipe-crafts persons who make me look good.

I wouldn't call this gourmet but for something easy and quick to throw together, we really enjoyed it!  I tasted it without the pepper flakes and then with and the red pepper is what makes this dish.  Very good for a busy mom!

This sauce is FANTASTIC. I left out the sausage to make a veggie pasta side dish but otherwise made the recipe as written. The sauce is rich from all the oil but still so light and flavorful with all the veggies. The tomatoes and squash release a lot of moisture to form the sauce, I wouldn't mess with those ingredient amounts much. I will make again as written, but depending on the protein I'm serving with I might try and vary the herbs and/or and add some wine.

Made some changes: I removed the sausage from the casing and rolled it into balls and covered them in flour before frying. I used more tomatoes since I wanted a lot of sauce (about 8 or 9 tomatoes total), and used a mix of grated romano and parmesan. I was a little worried since the meat and veggies started looking really ugly about half way through, but all it took was one taste. Will use again (maybe with even more tomatoes) :]

SO YUMMY!! Even my picky boys were munching away~.

I read a lot of the reviews and also made adjustments:
-sweet italian turkey sausage (casings off) instead of hot
-half the amount of oil
-can of diced basil,oregano,garlic flavored tomatoes instead of fresh ones
-half the amount of red pepper flakes (Only cus my kids were being served too. I'm sure it's just as good, or even better, with the hot sausage and all of the pepper flakes.)
-a little bit more cheese!

Definitely will be making this often ;)

Loved it, used farro instead of pasta, it was delicious!  Did not stray to far from recipe, but seasoned to taste.  Also used pork sausage (hot and sweet) and it was perfect.  Great healthy filling dish!  Will definitely make again.

Good, simple summer dinner. I wish the sauce had a bit more of a kick and I will probably add more crushed red pepper if I try this again.

I cut this recipe in half, used mild sausage, yellow squash, and red bell pepper.  Added some sweet onion, also.  Turned out very well.  Served with garlic bread and a simple side salad. Will take the leftovers for lunch tomorrow.  Thanks for posting, KATHYP100

Great recipe! I did make this a vegan dish by using vegan sausage and vegtable broth. I also used a can of diced tomatoes.  I also added Italian seasoning and mushrooms. Will make again.

Wow, I liked this more than I thought I would.  Even my picky 4 yr old ate it!  I used chicken sausage, left out peppers and used mushrooms instead.  I accidently used a whole onion but i liked it.  I added a splash of italian dressing and about 3T of cream cheese to the recipe. The fresh basil helped a lot. I halved the recipe and we still had left overs.

Really loved this! Great flavor and loaded with veggies. I took the casing off the sausage and crumbled it instead of slicing it. Other than that, I followed the recipe as written.

So good! I will make this time and time again - I will most likely sub chicken for the spicy turkey sausage just because we're not big fans of sausage here.  It was a great way to get my toddler to eat veggies he otherwise would not eat plain.  Great recipe!!

I have made this probably 5 or 6 times already and never get tired of it. It has so much flavor! Like a few of the other reviewers have mentioned, I cut the oil in half. It didn't really need that much. I also added a couple of tablespoons of light cream cheese to the whole pot to make it creamy...so good! Of course, what isn't better with a little cream cheese?!

I skipped the sausage because I was serving Parmesan Chicken (from this site) on the side.  This is one of my favorite pasta dishes I've ever had.  My husband loved it, and my dad said it was better than an Italian restaurant!  It makes tons too (more than 8 servings the way I served it) so we had lots of leftovers.  I will definitely be making again!

This was delicious.  The only change I made was to reduce the olive oil to 2 T and add just a little white wine to help dissolve the bouillon.  Oh, I also broke up the sausage instead of slicing it, at my husband's request.  I would not change anything else; will definitely make this again.

I can honestly say this is the best thing I've ever cooked! It was amazing!
I used some Elk italian sausage and instead of the zucchini and yellow squash, I used some vegetables from a frozen vegetable mix.
It seemed like a healthier version of a stir-fry rather than a primavera - which is probably why it tasted so amazing!
I plan on making this recipe frequently in the future.

Only substitution I made was mild pork sausage, as that's what I had on hand. Besides that, this was perfect as is! Normally I don't like sausage as the primary protein, but the loud flavor of the sausage mixed with the mild flavors of the veggies worked really well. My wife wasn't a fan of the red pepper, but I thought it was perfect at 1/2 tsp.

This recipe is AMAZING!!!  I have made it with chicken and Italian Sausage.  Fantastic results both times.  To save time, I use one can of Italian seasoned diced tomatoes instead of fresh Roma tomatoes.  One less thing to chop!  This recipe has been a hit for everyone who has tried it!

I have to admit I did alter the ingredients a little, but this was a fantastic dish!  The husband is not a fan of turkey sausage so I used diced browned chicken.  I don't care for peppers so I omitted the pepper and added diced portabello mushrooms.  It was the perfect dish for this chilly rainy night.  I made breadsticks to go along with it.  Definitely a keeper and in dinner rotation!

This was a great mid-week meal.  We had spicy sausage that had to be eaten, and also added a small bit of low fat cream cheese per another viewers suggestion and it was delish.  I didn't have as much fresh basil and i think it would have made this 4 a 5 but it was still great.  Thanks!!

ive made this a bunch of times and it is always amazing.  Usually add a can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh, the extra liquid helps to make is saucier.  You really can use any veggies you want. Last time i added eggplant, great addition but i would recommend sauteing it a little first since it was still a little tough in the short time it cooks with the recipe.  I have also added tomato sauce before which is also good if you want a thicker sauce.

This was REALLY good! I served it over rice instead of mixing in pasta, and used the fresh veggies we had in the fridge last night (green beans, broccoli, onion, garlic, mushrooms - and used dried basil instead of fresh). I did the oil/chicken bouillon/red pepper flake sauce as directed and it was GREAT! The fiance loved it and had seconds.

AWESOME! I made this recipe the other night and it turned out sooo great! The only thing I did different was add mushrooms and added red pepper on adult plates only. Even my 9 year old picky eater loved it! The only thing i will do different next time it try using a fat free Italian dressing to replace the 1/2 cup of oil so it wont be so fating. Has anyone tried this?

Used mild Italian lean turkey chub sausage.  Broke it up as I browned it.  In order to hold down fat, used only very little oil to saute onions and garlic and added homemade chicken broth, pasta water and wine with veggies instead of bouillon cubes (yuk).  Used canned tomatoes since it is now October.  Kids ate it.  Added hot pepper separately for adults.

Delicious!  I removed the sausage casing and broke up into chunks instead of slicing.  Added mushrooms (sounded like a good addition to me) and cut back on the basil because my husband sometimes thinks the fresh is overpowering.  Very flavorful.  Will definitely make again.  It was so good, I would serve for a casual dinner with family or friends.

Fabulous!  i was a little worried that it wouldn't have a lot of flavor, but i was wrong!  my whole family loved it and i will definitely make again.  i did substitute sweet turkey sausage instead of hot and with the pepper flakes it was still perfectly spicy.  great dish!

This recipe is delicious!  Based on our personal taste, I added asparagus instead of bell pepper and roasted red peppers instead of tomatoes. I used sweet Italian sausage instead of hot. This dish is super versatile. Great way to get the kiddos to eat their veggies.  Can't wait to make it again, this is definitely a keeper!

This was fantastic. It was a great way to get DH who hates vegetables to actually enjoy them.  I did make a few substitutions to suit his taste.  I used Turkey Kielbasa instead of Italian Sausage and I couldn't find yellow squash this early in this season so I used asparagus.  I also seasoned the vegetables really well with a variety of my favorite seasoning so the vegetables could be "dressed" and not "naked" so DH would eat it.  Overall, it was a fantastic starting point to led to one of my new favorite recipes.

Awesome recipe!  I omitted the green pepper and used turkey sausage that I squeezed out of the casings.  I also used quartered grape tomatoes instead of roma as that was what I had on hand.  My family devoured it and was asking when I when I will be making it again.

I thought this was a great easy recipe, especially because as long as you have the basic ingredients you can subsitute or add to it.  Since I didn't have some of the vegies this recipe called for I added what I had on hand which was broccli.  I also used canned diced tomato added white wine + oregeno. Like others I added more garlic and more spice.  I didn't have parm. on hand so I used romano.  This dish was very good and my family ate it up.  I will definatly be making this dish again.

We love this dish!!!   I have made it several times and everytime it is a hit!    I normally halve the recipe, but I keep the tomatoes and chicken bouillon as it reads in the recipe - to make it a little saucier.    You won't be sorry if you give this recipe a try!  Yummy!

This is definitely one of our family favs!!!  I omit the tomatoes just as a personal preference but the spice is just right and we do use hot turkey sausage to add a little extra.  Even the two year old loves it!!

Excellent pasta dish!! Everyone loved it. I used hot turkey sausage and took it out of the casing before browning so that it was crumbled when finished. Broccoli was a great addition.

We love this so much. I do use the can of diced tomatoes (the basil oregano can) instead and dried basil because I didn't have real on hand.  I also substituted a handful of broccoli, peas, and carrots for the veggies.  Next time I will double the turkey sausage.

I did not have any zucchini or squash and almost didn't make it. I'm glad I did!! It's very easy. I decided to go ahead and I followed what many others recommended. I took the Italian turkey sausage out of the casing, ground it, frying in some olive oil.  I decide to use a 1/2 bag of veggies containing chestnuts, broccoli and carrots. I also added red and green peppers. I used a can of Italian seasoned diced tomatoes with extra basil and added whole grain Penne pasta afterward. Topped it off with Parmesan cheese. My husband LOVED it! (and that is what counts!)

Unbelievably delicious! This is going in the line up of summer meals for sure. The turkey sausage makes it healthier and I'm always looking for new ways to use up our tomatos.

What a wonderful recipe! I used a can of diced tomatoes because I didn't have any fresh. I also omitted the yellow squash because I didn't have any. Fresh basil is a must, it gives a really nice flavor to this dish. Served over whole wheat penne and chicken sausage.

This was excellent.  I followed the recipe as is, except decreased the oil to only 1/4 cup, omitted the green pepper and the parmesan cheese.  My picky husband loved it!

Fabulous!  This recipe is fresh and delicious.  I made a few changes for personal preference: I used a can of diced tomatoes (undrained) instead of fresh, I only used 1/4 cup olive oil and I used a red bell pepper instead of green.  I also used Italian seasoned ground turkey, browned and crumbled, instead of sausage.  I loved using the fresh whole basil leaves and all of the flavors of this dish blend together wonderfully!

So easy and so good.  This recipe was light and very flavorful.  I did add a little ground sea salt and fresh ground pepper but other than that, this recipe doesn't need a thing!

Delicious and easy to make.  I used fresh veggies from the garden for the most part, substituted a red bell pepper for green, and it was delicious!

Great summer recipe! I did have to improvise with the veggies, 4 small yellow squash, 1/2 package shrooms, two large slicing tomatoes, 1 small stalk of broccoli. I made too many noodles, rotini, and didn't think before I added and it wasn't as saucy as I would have liked, but completely my fault. Really yummy and easy!

I was looking for a way to use some of my summer zucchini and squash.  We really really enjoyed this light dish!!! I did cut the oil down to approx. 1/3 c., but my husband even thought 1/4 was probably enough. I also added mushrooms and a can of diced tomatoes (I didn't have any fresh roma yet). I think this would be good with fresh spinach too!

This was deeeelicious!!! I did not use peppers but instead used asparagus, zucchini, a few marinated artichokes and mushrooms.  Great flavor.  I also did not have onions, so I used a green onion.  Came out great.  Used diced tomatoes with Jalapenos.

This is AMAZING!!! I've made this twice and everyone always raves about it and wants the recipe! I did make a couple of revisions.I used ground Italian turkey sausage and added a little Italian seasoning to it while it was cooking. I also decreased the bell pepper by half and added a whole onion. I also added two palm fulls of Italian season to it after combining all the ingrediants, as well as adding the entire bag of parmesan cheese. Which I think is 1 3/4 cup. This is def. a keeper!

I used chicken sausage and dried basil, and this was delicious!! Filling and healthy, without a creamy sauce to make me feel guilty about. My husband and my 2-year-old loved it also. Definitely a keeper.

Tastes so good!! I omitted the tomatoes as neither I nor my hubby care for them. I was afraid that the bell pepper would be overwhelming but all of the flavors blended well together.

This turned out better than I thought. The only changes I made were to use turkey kielbasa (as that's what I had on hand) and I omitted the yellow squash as I had a few zucchini that needed using. The dish was filling but also very light. Very easy to throw together too. If I were to make it again, I would add a few more seasonings. Not at all bad as written though. Thanks!

This is so good! I made it as written, but switched up the veggies a bit. Didn't have any yellow squash, used crimini mushrooms. Also added some aspargus and topped it off with shredded asiago cheese. Delicious!!!!!

This was one of the best things I've ever made! I was a little skeptical of the lack of other spices but just the fresh basil and red chili flakes were amazing! I'll definitely be making it again. I was looking for a pasta dish with lots of vegetables and a very light sauce, and this was perfect! It's good with or without the sausage!

THE BEST meal i have ever made! I used 2 tbsp of i can't believe it's not butter instead of oil because I realized at the last minute that I didn't have any.  For vegetables i used peas, green beans, corn, snap peas and 1 can of diced tomatoes instead of the Roma tomatoes. I also used chicken instead of italian sausage. SCRUMPTIOUS!

This recipe is delish! I don't understand what makes it so good... but it really is. We love it. A couple comments - definitely don't use all that oil! I just use a drizzle to coat the pan when cooking the garlic/onions and then another bigger drizzle when the veggies are cooking. The second drizzle probably isn't even necessary; the veggies produce their own liquid as they cook down.  Fresh basil makes it amazing; I've subbed dried basil in a pinch and it's still fine... but better w/ fresh. I also crumble the sausage when cooking instead of slicing it.. but that's a personal preference. This makes a TON of food and the leftovers taste just as good.  Thanks for the yummy recipe!

Easy to make. Made a few adjustments just because it was what I had on hand.  For vegetables used, orange peppers, spinach, onion and zucchini.  Used turkey polsa kielbasa sausage.  This was very tasty and great to have for leftovers.

This recipe makes a nice and filling, yet light tasting meal.  I didn't use hot sausage, as I couldn't find any, but was actually happy I didn't.  I had just the right amount of spice without it.  Everyone had seconds.

Very tasty!  I only used about 1/3 cup of olive oil, and about 1/2 the pasta called for.  I also substituted mushrooms for the bell pepper.  I really like this as an alternative to red sauce.  I also love the fact that it incorporates lots of fresh veggies.  Yum!

Delicious!!  I made this recipe last night for my family.  My 16 year old is always very "honest" with her opinions about my cooking.  Needless to say, she helped herself to a considerable second serving.  Enough said for me!!  I only made one change, I used pork sausage in place of the turkey sausage.  My girls really enjoy sausage for breakfast and I felt they would prefer the pork over the turkey.  Thanks for a great recipe.  It's a keeper!!

Used Italian hot sausage, as I couldn't find Italian turkey sausage, also added asparagus, as I had it on hand.  Loved the recipe.  Would probably cut up the basil next time and add it at the last minute.

A little on the bland side for us I guess. I did add a can of diced tomatoes and a can of tomato sauce. I used ground sausage instead of ring sausage. I like all of the stuff together, I would just like to find a great sauce to top it off with!

Delicious.  This gave me a new love for squash/zucchini, which I can usually only take in very small amounts.  With this recipe, I was picking through to add vegetables to every bite.  I did leave out the red pepper, simply b/c neither of us like that taste.  And I did cut back on the basil for taste, and I cut WAY back on the oil for health reasons and it was still good.

My new favorite! My boyfriend loved it too, and he HATES veggies. I made the changes that others suggested. 15 oz canned tomatoes, but I also added a small can of tomato sauce.  Chicken instead of sausage, and cut the oil just about in half.  The best is the fresh basil, it is the first time I used it, and what a wonderful flavor!

This dish is absolutely delicious!  I used sweet Italian sausage, cut back on the red pepper a bit, and subbed mushrooms for the green peppers. Definately a repeat recipe, so thanks Kathy!

Tastes great and simple to make. I used mild turkey sausage because it was in my freezer, but the red pepper flakes gave the dish enough of a zip.  I also substituted mushrooms for green peppers.

This was very good!!  I am surprised, because it didn't seem like there would be much flavor, but boy was I wrong!  The only changes I made were that I used crushed tomatoes because I didn't have fresh, changed the noodles, added mushrooms, and a splash of non fat milk to make the sauce sort of creamy. Excellent!

Awesome recipe!  The flavors are perfect together.  This is a restaurant quality dish...reminds me a bit of a dish Olive Garden used to serve called Chicken Giradino.  I will definitely be cooking this one again.  It's a great way to use yellow squash and zucchini.  I think it'd be great with mushrooms also.  I took a previous poster's suggestion and used a red bell pepper instead of a green one.  You've gotta try this one!

Such a delicious recipe! I  prefer                                   sweet chicken sausage with the hot pepper flakes. I used drained Muir Glen organic tomatoes instead of the fresh roma. Like others suggested I used only 1/4 cup olive oil. I passed parmesan to sprinkle on to taste and served it over  whole wheat pasta to make this a healthier dish                                         Loved the fresh basil. I plan to make this again soon.

This was awesome.  I used what I had on hand - onion, garlic, zucchini, canned tomatoes, and dried basil.  Red pepper flakes to taste.  And less oil.  It tasted GREAT with homemade wheat noodles. My husband said this recipe made him very happy.

This is a four for me because as is it was bland.  I had to keep adding my fav spices to flavor it up a bit..and extra parm cheese.  I loved the whole concept with the turkey sausage and fresh veggies.it just needed some extra seasoning.  Try adding a few dashes of paprika, kosher salt, pepper, sugar, minced onion..then it becomes quit tasty.

I substituted cubed skinless/boneless chicken breast for the sausage.  I also added a dash of lemon and dill weed for a lighter and zesty flavor option.  Excellant!

I loved this recipe! I didn't use oil. I cooked the Italian sausage with Pam. Then sauteed the veggies in the oil from the sausage. Also, added seasonings to the veggies while sauteing them. Used Calif. Blend veggies. and added mushroons. Also, used the can of diced tomatoes. It was delicious.

Delicious way to use the summer veggies we got at the farmer's market today!  I used purple ruffle basil from our garden, fresh onions from the market, zuke, yellow & red peppers.  I used only 2 tsp of olive oil, added a little chicken broth for moisture, but the veggies added plenty.  Oh, also added Spike seasoning.  A little trick with sausage - squeeze out little 'balls' of the sausage from the casing into pan.  Quick turkey sausage meatballs!

3.5* - good recipe. Had to sub Italian Mild Pork sausage as I couldn't find Turkey. As someone said, it's a good change from tomato sauce-based pasta dishes.

All I can say is...WOW. This recipe surpassed my expectations. Even while I was making it, I was skeptical and didn't think it would amount to much. I was wrong! The recipe was bursting with flavor! I followed the recipe except I used a 15oz can of italian seasoned diced tomatoes and I only used squash (which my daughter didn't like so much). I also used the powdered parmesan instead of grated and sprinkled it over the dish after I put it on the plate. Also, I recommend browning the sausage first, setting aside to cool, then cutting. It was impossible to cut the sausage while it was raw. One last word, I didn't use the whole box of pasta, doing so would've made the dish VERY dry. Half was enough.

This recipe was great!  Of course, I can't help but change it:  I only had Polish sausage, and not enough, so I added 2 chicken breasts.  I also added 2 more cloves of garlic, and used Thai noodles in stead of pasta.  No fresh basil, so I added 2 Tbsp dried basil.  We'll definately make this again.  Thanks!

This is fantastic and simple, however, I changed it up quite a bit. I did not use chicken boullion, squash, or bell pepper. I used broccoli and added toasted pine nuts. Really, you could add just about anything. The toasted pine nuts were the best addition, I think. We all loved this.

This was excellent.  I used canned tomatoes because that's all I had.  I also added fresh broccoli and used whole wheat pasta.  I left out the bouillon because of the sodium.  I drizzled a little extra virgin olive oil on at the end.  I will definitely make this again.

This recipe was amazing! I got the produce from my local farmers market (buy local!). I also added some eggplant, and went light on the bouillon because I'm not the biggest fan of MSG, and I added a little more chili pepper flakes than recommended. Overall a great recipe with an amazing complexity of flavors. Mmmm. I will be making this again.

Yummy!  I halved the recipe for my little family of 3 and it still made a ton.  I didn't measure how much oil I used, but it was probably close to the full amount called for and I wouldn't have wanted less.  I used way more parmesan cheese than called for because we like things cheesy.  I did not have any fresh basil, so I just sprinkled dried basil liberally over the veggies.  Really great, light tasting recipe!

This was great.  I basically halved the recipe, and only used enough oil to saute the onion and garlic.  I added a little water to the veggies while they cooked to dissolve the bouillon and make a bit of a sauce and that worked out well.
